Hello, ciderpeople.


I've been observing the traffic(getting lighter...) for the last week, and thoug
ht I'd throw in a penny's worth.

I have tried to make cider on four occasions.  The first time I was wildly
successful.  The cider was superb -- light apple taste, crisp, and dry.
My last three have been disasterous.  Differences: the first time I used
fresh (from a NJ apple farm) apple cider; the last three were using the
Ironmaster cider kit.  I used Red Star Champagne yeast the first two times,
and the yeast that came with the kit the last two.  On my last attempt, the
cider tasted okay coming out of the fermenter (a bit bland, but no off tastes)
but after kegging it and letting it age a bit it began to sour.  The first
attempt was bottled, and it improved dramatically until it was 3 months old
(actually one bottle lasted almost a year.  Very dry, very clean taste).
The kegged cider went from bland to undrinkably putrid in about a month.
I have made a lot of beer without any problems.  It never sours in the keg.


So, any ideas out there?  Conclusions I draw from the above are that any
aging should be done in glass, and that fresh cider should be used.  Has
anyone successfully kegged cider?
        thanks for any and all help
        (my wife loves cider!)
