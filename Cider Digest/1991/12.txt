Subject: Long awaited excerpts from AHA conference




As promised here are the long awaited excerpts from the AHA conference tutorial 
on Cider making. Paul Correnty gave the talk, and the following was in his
notes:


There are 4 categories of apples to use:
1) Neutral base: 30-50% of total juice. Sweet, low acid apples that provide
sugar and are slow to oxidize. Varieties include: Baldwin, Red Delicious,
Cortland, Rome Beauty, York Imperial


2) Tart: 20-40% of total juice. Medium acid that give zest to the juice.
Varieties include: Jonathan, Northern Spy, Rhode Island Greening, Wealthy,
Winesap (aka Staman Winesap), Granny Smith


3) Aromatic: 10-20% of total juice. For crisp apple bouquet. Varieties include:
MacIntosh, Gravenstein, Pippin, Roxbury Russet


4) Astringent: not more than 10% of total juice. Gives zing & tannin. Varieties 
include: Crab Apples, or wild apples.




(*** Additional paraphrased excerpts follow ***)


The goal is to acheive a balanced blend, not too tart, not too sweet.


Initial gravities in the range 1.043 to 1.052 are typical.
Addition of honey, cane or brown sugar (or any combination) to raise the
gravity to 1.070 is recommended for producing a "traditional New England Hard
CIder."  For each gravity increment of 0.005 add 2.25 oz. of sugar, or 3 oz. of
honey per gallon.


Russets, Baldwins or other thick skinned (or crab or wild) apples are
 recommended as good sources of tannin, which aids in maintaining balanced
flavor.


Wild yeasts which appear on the apple are known as the bloom. They work best at
cool temperatures (40-55F), though ale & lager yeasts work well for low alcohol
cider, and Epernay Wine Yeast for a stronger wine like cider.


Add Campden tablets (one per gallon of juice) and wait 24 hours prior to
pitching the yeast.


Traditional fermentation is done by filling sanitized uncovered vessels
(carbouys, stainless steel kegs, wooden barrels) to the top and cover with
cheescloth loosely. In a week or two the cider will begin vigorous
fermentation. At this point the vessels should be wiped down daily with a mild
bleach solution, and topped off with fresh cider. By the end of a month the
activity will slow and an airlock should be put in place. One cup of natural
raisins (unpreserved) may be added to give a yeast & tannin kicker as well as
provide the active yeasts with additional nutrients. This helps prevent stuck
ferments. The cider will continue to ferment slowly, and clear during the
winter. Optional racking part way through the winter is OK.


Racking off is done in early spring (anytime after the beginning of March). The
still cider then can be quietly siphoned into bottles and corked or capped, 
or aged in oak for a few weeks. The bottled cider should be allowed to rest for
a month or so before consumption. To make sparkling cider add 1 cup of sugar
per carbouy before siphoning, then cap or cork (wire the corks!) and let them
rest six wekks or so before consuming.


If stored at 45-55F hard cider can be kept for two years without deteriorating.

Well that's it. Those are excerpts of Paul Correnty's notes. Paul speaks mostly
of Traditional New England Ciders. I think now many homebrewers are making
similar beverages, but using different techniques, say working with added
yeasts instead of natural ones, and perhaps paying a little more attention to 
the Cider vs. the traditional toss it in the basement and come back in spring 
method (which has it's merits in ease of production, though you need A LOT more
spare carbouys to do it that way!!).


Well try it and judge for yourself.

assume that you are moderate in everything.
you now have an eXcess of moderation, a contradiction.


eXcessiveness is clearly the way to go...
