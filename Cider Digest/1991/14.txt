Ever since summer started ( late May ), my brew partner and I noticed that our
beer quality was going on a downward slope...( we have not had a good batch of
ale since April).  My partner has come up with the theory that the Texas
heat is responsible ( our house temperatures get up to 85 during the day ).
Most of our batches have had either a rubbery taste or some other off-taste.


Anyway, getting back to cider, I have been fermenting my cider at 85-90
and I haven't noticed any off-flavors at all.  Does anyone have any 
recommendations for an optimum temperature for fermentation?  Does temperature
really make any difference?


thanks

Does anyone know what Hurricane Bob means for this year'cider/apple
crop in New England?  I have this bad feeling that there won't be as 
much cider or that there will be too much fruit juice from underdeveloped
apples.
