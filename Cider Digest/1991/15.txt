Temperature makes A BIG difference for beer.
The fermentation temperature you use is yeast strain dependent.
Ales & Lagers should be fermented below 75F to minimize ester production 
(and other off flavors as well). Obviously lager yeasts like colder temps too.


I have had no problem using the Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeasts on meads 
during even the hottest summer days with indoor temps into the low 90s.
I have made most of my meads in the summer, and the temperature seems 
to never have any effect on the Pasteur Champagne yeast.


I think for ciders temperature is also less critical, but depends on how you're
fermenting. If you're going with the Red Star Pasteur Champagne (strong, dry
ciders) then don't worry about it being too hot. If you're with an Ale or Lager
temperatures as high as 85F also shouldn't matter that much (though for beer
they would) since you're not likely to notice an extra amount of fruity tastes
in a cider, where as in a beer you of course would. Higher temps than 85F will
likely interfere with the yeast metabolism more significantly.


If you're gonna use the wild yeasts present in the cider, they perfer cellar
temps of 45-55F, or so Paul Correnty indicated. I suspect they'll do OK as high
as 65F, but probably don't like higher temperatures too much, though I'm
guessing at that.






As for Bob, I have been told that in New England the high winds knocked a lot
of apples down from the trees before they could get picked. This will have the
effect of driving up prices for eating apples :-(, and driving down prices for
juice pressing apples :-)!!, so cider should be less expensive.


As for underdeveloped fruit, I wouldn't worry too much. I talked with Paul
Correnty (who knows lots of growers), and he indicated that most of the apples
were ripe, or close to ripe, and being further inland most of the orchards
didn't experience the type of severe damage that the Cape did. Bob was actually
a pretty wimpy hurricane, doing most of it's damage by knocking trees onto
power lines, but overall a quick trip through Falmouth & the Vineyard last week
showed that while some trees were knocked down and branches broken, the scope
of destruction was nothing like the Carolinas, where whole forests (every tree!)
were knocked over like toothpicks!


So relax don't worry have a Cider!!

No, but there was an article in yesterday's NY Times about the MacIntosh
crop of NY State coming in extra early this year, like RIGHT NOW.  I forget
the reason, but since they're early, they
will be slightly different in taste/color from the normal crop
.
