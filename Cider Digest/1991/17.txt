Subject: Sweet cider sought.


I have a request for any cider makers in Southern New Hampshire or extreme 
Northern mass, near the NH border.  Because of my vision, I can't drive.  
This makes going around seeking good cider to harden rather difficult.  My 
wife is loving, but not adventurous and would drive by a dozen cider stands 
without ntoicing them.


If anyone in the mentioned area finds a cider that is particularly good, 
please post details here, or email to me directly.  Better yet, I'd be 
happy to reimburse  you for a few gallons plus carrying charges.  It'd sure 
be nice to have some cider hardened and ready for Christmas.


Y'know, sometimes I gripe about the cost of brewing beer cider and mead, 
but I just got Beer & Wine Hobby's fresh juice list for winemakers.  Whew!  
The California juices run from $10 to $12.35 a gallon, in six gallon pails. 
 I don't think I'll gripe about cider again.


Dan Graham,


Along came a spider,
and fell in the cider,
and wove funny webs for a week.
