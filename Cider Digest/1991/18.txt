Well Dan, I was going to wait until people in the Wort Processors got their
newsletters before going public with this info, but since you ask for it, here
it is. The Worts will be hosting a cider picnic in an orchard in Westford, Ma.
(not too far from the NH border off Rt. 3). As part of this event advance
orders can be placed with our resident Cider guru Paul Correnty (you've heard
me mention his name here a few times :-), who is preparing a blend of apples
which will be pressed and allowed to settle the week before the picnic and will
be ready to be picked up at the picnic. Full details are below. I'm sure you
can arrange for someone in Brew Free or Die to pick up some cider for you, or
perhaps your wife can make the trip for you.


For you other netters out there in the New England region, you're welcome to
attend the picnic. Please let me remind you that if you contact Paul to obtain
some cider you will need to pick it up at the picnic (or arrange to have
someone else pick it up). You don't necessarily have to attend the picnic
(though we will taunt you if you just show up to claim your cider), but
you do have to either show up or get someone else to if you make an order.
People who place orders and don't pick them up will not only jeopardize 
the future viability of making this cider available for everyone, but risk
penalty (like me sneaking over to your house and contaminating it with
Nasty mutant E Coli bacteria :-) and public censure. Please be considerate of
Paul (who puts in a lot of work to get this together) and others. Thanks.

PS If you plan to attend, and need a map let me know when you send your check in
and I'll pop one in the mail to you. The map was included in the Newsletter,
but is not available in on line form. It shouldn't be to hard to get to though,
since it's on Westford Rd., just a few miles off of Rt. 3 in Westford.

The Wort Processors are organizing a Cider Picnic, to toast the harvest and
pressing of this years Cider by drinking some of last years. In addition to
drinking last years product you'll be able to pick up your order for fresh
pressed juice at the picnic (thus substantially simplifying last year's
delivery task!!). The details are as follows.


DATE:   Saturday, September 28th (raindate Sunday, September 29th)
TIME:   Noon
PLACE:  Anderson's Fruit Farm, Westford, Ma. (map & directions on pg. ??)
COST:   $5 per person in advance (see below for details) RSVP by Sept. 21st


To register for the picnic please make your check for $5 per person payable
to The Boston Wort Processors, and mail it to Wort Processors c/o Jay Hersh,
15 Dunbar Ave., Medford, Ma. 02155, before Saturday September 21st.
The $5 cost of the picnic will include barbeque meats (burgers, hot dogs,
chicken), buns, paperware, and of course your contribution to porta-potty 
rental (no toilets in an orchard that we don't bring ourselves :-). 


We have rounded up 2 gas grills, but will need 2-3 more. If you can bring a
propane grill to this event please call Jay (617-395-4745) and let me know.
If we can't round up at least 2 more we'll have to rent a grill at a cost of
$50 and pass the hat to cover it, so help out if you can. In addition to the
grill this event is a BYO Chair, if you want a place to sit other than
the ground (or a table to eat on as only serving tables will be provided)
then bring your own!! Other great things to bring along are games (volleyball, 
bocce, frisbee, etc.. plenty of room in the orchard). As with the June picnic,
please bring a side dish. If no one else volunteers at the September meeting
I'll coordinate these, so call me at 617-395-4745 to register what you're
bringing so we don't have 13 Lime Jello Molds.


CIDER ORDERS. Paul Correnty is handling cider orders. All orders should be
placed NO LATER THAN Saturday, September 21st. Call Paul to place your
orders, but please CALL ONLY BETWEEN 6PM and 8PM, as Paul has children
and works real early (4AM ugh!!). Pauls' phone number is 508-433-8187,
remember to thank him for all his help in organizing this whole thing!!. 
As of press time the price couldn't be finalized, but due to the Hurricane
a large number of falls (which go to juicing) were on hand and Paul expected
this year's prices to be lower than last years!! 


Please also remember that this is a special juice pressing with a blend of 
apples selected by Paul specifically for making Hard Cider. When you call to 
make your order keep in mind that this pressing is being done specially for 
us and that Paul gets stuck with orders not claimed. Your name will be taken 
when you place your order so that we can disperse it at the picnic. 
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOUR ORDER TO BE PAID FOR
AND PICKED UP!! If you place an order and don't pick it up or have someone else 
pick it up for you you will be subject to derision, verbal abuse, and any
will still have to make good on the cost of your order, so keep this in mind
when ordering.


So see you there, and remember to bring any Cider you have made, as well 
as homebrew!!
