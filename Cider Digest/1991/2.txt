First let me applaud the conversion of this list into a digest.
I had not complained yet, but some of us rely on e-mail for work
and have to read messages as they come in.  The constant stream of
cider messsages was interesting, but distracting.


Now to the real subject.


I am also interested in finding out about "commercial" or ever (shudder)
frozen juice.  I would like to try a few small batches on something
cheap that I can get before apple season gets here in order to improve
my chances with the real thing.  There was a mention of additives
retarding the yeast.  Has anyone got more info?

Chip, where did your girlfriend get Strongbow in the U.S.?  For that
matter, where did she get framboise?

Ok, my turn.


I have to date only made one batch of Hard Cider.  This was really a Cyser
with two pounds of honey added to one gallon of cider.  I am pretty happy 
with the ferment using the Red Star Champagne yeast.  I used sulphites to
sterilize the must, but however I added some after the ferment and thus it 
has a nasty aroma.  This was a test batch and was ment to learn from, 
as I now have.


Anyway, I am now up for makeing a batch of sweet cider.  My basic
approach will be to add in light malt extract to raise the starting
gravity.  (I'm going to skip out on the honey this time).  I want
to raise this high enough to have a failry sweet result, But I 
don't want to end up with Apple Beer!  I wouldn't mind adding sugar
or ending up with really strong cider, but I can't really formulate
a recipy due to my knowledge limit.


So a few questions come to mind:


1)  What is approximate Specific Gravity of Soft Cider?
    (Percentage of fermentables would be better)


2)  How high does a Starting Gravity have to be to have a fairly sweet
    resulting Hard Cider: if using champagne yeast?; if using ale yeast?
    (Say with Red Star Champagne and Whitbread Ale yeast)


3)  Is it OK to boil Soft Cider?  Or will this cause a hazing problem?
    (I wish sterilize with heat rather than with chemicals this time)


Any insight would be appreciated.  Much Thanks!!
