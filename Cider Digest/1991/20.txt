Hi all,


here is a recipe I saved from the Homebrew Digest a year ago...


It made some good cider. Kinda dry, but still had some appley sweetness.
I'm going to try it again, when I make it to Apple Hill...


I'll post a Apple Hill report soon. My Grandfather passed away, so I haven't
had time to make it up there yet. Things should work out this weekend though..

=         For this recipie to turn out well DO NOT use the pasturized
=       apple juice you find all year round in the stores. My batch last year
=       took about 3 weeks before it was totally done fermenting. You will
=       notice an unpleasent smell during this time, but you can ignore it.
=       
=         Boy, does this turn out great!!!

=    5 gallons sweet cider
=    3 lbs brown sugar
=    3 lbs honey
=    2 pkg champagne yeast
=      
=    directions.

=     Using 5 gallon glass carbuoy strain 3 gallons of cider into carbuoy,
=    the finer the mesh the better, pulp will make the concoction smell
=    rank. Strain approx .5 gallon in pot on stove and heat enough

=    in carbuoy and finish filling the carbuoy to just bellow the neck.
=    You will have some cider left over so don't waste it, drink it.
=    Pitch the yeast and stopper the carbuoy with an airlock.  Watch it
=    go, and when fermentation stops, bottle cider in what ever size jugs
=    you want.  Be sure the fermentation process has stopped before
=    bottling.  In 12 oz bottles add .25 tsp sugar, for quarts add .50
=    tsp and for gallons add 1 tsp.  this will add a little carbonation
