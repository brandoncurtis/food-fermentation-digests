Subject: Burgandy cider / basic info.


Monday, I stopped by the only fresh cider place I know of here in the Derry 
area.  They had some single variety cider pressed from burgandy apples.  I 
bought a gallon of the cider and all the apples they had.  It is, without 
any qualification, the best cider I've ever tasted.  The cider is very deep 
in flavor, very tart and rich.  It is not especially sweet, at least, not 
to the taste.  Has anyone used this cider alone or in a blend to harden?  I 
know that the taste of a fresh cider will not necessairly translate to a 
good taste when hardened.


To the request about basic info:  I'm nearly blind, so take my suggestions 
with a pinch of apple peel.


Yes, making cider can be as simple as adding yeast to sweet cider, 
attaching an airlock and letting it ferment.  In fact, much cider is made 
with the natural yeasts on the apples and nothing at all is added.  
Preservatives generally will either hinder your yeast from fermenting 
correctly, or cause nasty flavors in the hard cider, stay away from them.  


There are a lot of variables in cider making, just like in beer making.  
You can go for semi-sweet cider, dry cider, still cider, or sparkling 
cider, or nearly any combination of them.


The moderator of this list has a nice preparation on the subject, he may 
send it to you just because you asked...


Cider is fun to make.  Get a few glass gallon jugs and make it several 
different ways so as to see how different things affect the outcome.  Try 
one with nothing at all, one with just yeast, one with sugar or honey and 
yeast, one with honey and spices, etc.  You get the idea.  Some people heat 
the cider first or use campton tablets to kill off the inherant stuff, some 
done.  Try a gallon of each.  


If you are good about cleaning stuff, and don't leave the cider open to the 
air, you probably won't have vvinegar.  Vinegar happens when acetic acid 
bacteria get into the cider and convert the ethanol molecules to acetic 
acid.  The same is true for any fermented liquid, hence cider vinegar, wine 
vinegar, malt vinegar, etc.


Now a general question:  What is the difference between apple wine and hard 
cider?


Dan Graham,
Along came a spider,
And fell in the cider,
and drowned in his lust...

Tempurature make a world of difference when it comes to
yeasties.  A) they haven't figured out how to build air
conditioners and b) they don't have fur coats 8^).  But
seriously...


It is best to ferment at between 65 to 75 degrees Farh.  The
yeasties work at a good pace then.  Hotter and they work
too fast which can cause the yeast to produce other chemicals
that cause off-flavors (this could be one problem with your
homebrew).  Too cold and the yeasties think it's winter and
start to hibernate 8^).  You want your pets to work at a nice
contolled pace so that they will convert the sugar to alcohol
and CO2 at a rate that their little systems can comfortably
handle it.  


J. Fixx has a good book out about the science of brewing.  It's
about 150 pages of really good information related to this.  Yes, it
is more geared toward the brewer and not the cider maker, but alot
of the information is transferable regarding yeast activity.  If
you have any interest in the science of this art I suggest you
pick up a copy.  (I don't have the book right here, I'll try and
post the exact title, publisher et al soon).

Subject: Sweet Cider Recipy


Hi,


Well I've been trying to formulate recepy that will yield a sweet cider,
I don't care if it is 100 proof, just as long as it's not dry.


So looking at the recipy just posted by robert:


> =    5 gallons sweet cider
> =    3 lbs brown sugar
> =    3 lbs honey
> =    2 pkg champagne yeast


Some quick calculations of the top of my head:


5 gal * 50 pts/gal (cider) = 250 pts
3 lb  * 45 pts/lb  (sugar) = 135 pts
3 lb  * 40 pts/lb  (honey) = 120 pts


505 pts / 5 gal = 1.101 SG


This is said to yield 'Kinda dry' cider using champagne yeast.


So I'm guessing that If I make a cider with a SG of 1.100 to 1.110 and
use an Ale yeast to ferment that this will yield a mildly sweet cider.
(Which should also make it harder to walk :-)  No??


Any thoughts from the masses?
