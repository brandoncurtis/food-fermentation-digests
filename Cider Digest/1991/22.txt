Ok, I've read the recepies (thanks!) and found an unused Sparklett's bottle
to use in place of an HTG carbouy (this will be ok if properly cleaned, 
right ?). Now what I need is a source of unpasturized cider in the SF
area.  Any leads out there ?


Thanks !

[I haven't lived there or bought cider from the guy since '84]


If Goffstown is too far north, just skip over the rest of this
message.


Now, when you're coming out of the center of town, going back towards
Manchester, you take the road on the right before the first road that
goes around the mountain [back to Bedford]..it goes about 1/2mi up the
hillside and stops.  There at the top left, you'll find a house with a
little red barn and an old man with a cider press..probably some of
the local kids are hanging out there too.


Good cider - back from the days when I would just open the bottle and
let it sit out in the fridge for a few weeks until it got slightly
hard.  Good for breakfast!


If someone is intrigued and not willing to take the adventure of
finding the place [Goffstown is small small], I may be able to be
convinced to dig out a map of the place and to try to place the road
myself.


Is the Lucky Dragon still there and the nice Chinese [from Taiwan]
lady still running it?  Her kids must be almost grown now...
