Actually I think if you start with that OG range and use an Ale yeast you'll
get a very sweet cider. I don't think the Ale yeast will ferment more than 0.06
to 0.07 of gravity, leaving you with something at the sweetness range of a
Mackeson Stout. I'd start with a gravity in the 1.080 to 1.090 range, or
perhaps even a little lower.


I made a draft cider last year starting in the 1.050 to 1.060 range with an Ale
yeast, and it finished in the 1.010 - 1.020 range (just like Ales :-)
The DRY ciders finish in the 0.090 - 1.010 range!

Subject: Where cider?


I hope I will be forgiven for a geocentric inquiry:


I live in NYC, and since cider season's a-comin, have started to think about
procuring some of the good and natural stuff from (not too far) upstate NY.
My question is, does anyone have some favorite orchards at which to purchase
fresh-pressed cider, say in the northern Westchester or Catskill regions?


I realize this won't do the non-New Yorkers any good, but it's still a good
idea to disseminate regional info through networks like this, no?


yours in ferment,

Go to your local "natural" foods market.  Molly Stone's has a few
stores, Living Foods in SF proper and also at Androgyno's Park and
Shop in SF and Berkeley.  They all sell one form or another of virgin
cider and some of it is even barely passable.
