For the NYC crowd. 
My family and I used to go apple picking at a place in or around the Catskills
called Masker Orchards. It wasn't too far from New Paltz, probably 90 minutes
or so from NYC. I would call the Sullivan County Chamber of Commerce, or
perhaps NY State Tourist Info. You can probably get info from either of those
places wrt apple picking in the Catskill Region where there are lots of great
orchards (Probably also in the Counties above Westchester on the East side of
the Hudson as well). Masker always had cider pressed, and I bet you'll find
that most of the orchards will press their own, or press what you pick..
