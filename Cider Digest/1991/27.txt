Subject: priming question


Well, my first test batch is merrily slowing down in the basement, and
it's time to think about priming.  I used ale yeast in a simple
pasturized gallon, so I may have some sweetness left.  I have about
2 ozs of the cider left over that I froze because I wanted to leave some
head space in the jug.  Could I pasturize this and add it when I bottle to
get some sweetness and carbonation, or would that be asking for possibly
cloudy cider (which doesn't bother me) or bottle bombs (which really would
bother me)?  Can or should I prime at all?  Should I add the leftover cider
now and let it ferment a few days so it settles and I don't blow up my bottles?


Also, some mead makers artificially stop the fermentation by nuking the yeast
with campden tablets, or by poisoning them with a cup of vodka.  Has anyone
done this?  Was it a good or a bad thing to do?


Who has stories?
