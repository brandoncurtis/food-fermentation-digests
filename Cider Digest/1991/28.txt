Subject: Yeast experiment


I was pleased to see this cider group start.  My wife and I used to find
a cider in a local grocery store here which we enjoyed.  But it's
appearance was intermittent, and we have not seen it in a while.  Since I
have done a bit of beer brewing, I thought I would try cider at home.


The discussions of different yeasts caught my attention, and I decided to
try an experiment with different yeasts, and small quantities of juice.
Since it was not yet time for fresh cider here (everything has been late
this year), I used frozen juice.  




I mixed 84 oZ of frozen juice with three times that amount of
boiled-cooled water.  This produced juice with a specific gravity of
1.050 and a ph of about 4.  I divided this into three 1 gallon jugs and
pitched three different yeasts:




    Red Star Pasteur Champagne, which seems to be commonly used;


    Edme Ale yeast;


    Red Star Epernay 2, a "general purpose" wine yeast




All three showed activity, although the ale split was less active that
the others.  After 6 days the SG was down the about 1.010, and after 14
it was down to 1.004 for the Pasteur and 1.002 for the others.  Clearly
all three yeasts were able to do in virtually all of the sugars in this
juice.


I bottled this with 1/8 Cup corn sugar per split in 20 and 12 oz beer
bottles.  At bottling time, it tasted good with small differences
between the splits.  We though the ale and wine splits had a taste
reminiscent of the those beverages.  The champaign yeast split was the
most neutral.


After 4 weeks in the bottles, we tasted the it last weekend.


I was a bit disappointed in the low carbonation of all three splits.
The Epernay wine yeast and the all yeast splits tasted much like they
did at bottling.  The Pasteur champaign yeast split had developed an
unpleasant sour taste, that appeared on first tasting it or after a
break, but which vanished on the second or third sip.  I am not ready to
blame the yeast for this though until I --or someone-- repeats it as I
may have contaminated the batch somehow during bottling.


Over all, our favorite one was the Epernay-2 wine yeast, I will use that
on a larger batch with fresh juice soon.
