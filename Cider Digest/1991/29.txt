I've found in making meads that you can get better carbonation if you
include some "yeast nutrient salts" with the priming sugar.  That is,
you probably have sugar and yeast (at least in the champagne yeast
version), and what is missing is one or more of the other things
required for the fermentation reactions.  I use about a teaspoon with
a half cup of corn sugar.
