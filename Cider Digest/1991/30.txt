I just received HCD 025 again today, somekind of timewarp
going on out there.  (Must be those damn PEXky people ;-)

IMHO a yeasts 'attenuativness' does not reflect how much sugar it will
ferment but rather what kind of sugars it will ferment.


So no matter what the SG, a yeast will continue to ferment all
of the sugars it can until it hits some limiting factor.  Such
limiting factors include: are there any more sugars left that this type
of yeast can ferment; are there enough nutrients in the wort to 
keep the yeast healthy; are their toxins in the wort which might
kill the yeast.


In beer an ale yeast ferments all of the sugars it can, this doesn't
mean that there arn't anymore sugars left, just ones that an ale yeast
can't process, and thus some residual sweetness.  (Ever hear of 
brewers using Crystal malt to add residual sweetness to their beers?)
These sugars plus all of the other non-fermentables add to the beers FG.


Now, again IMHO, cider has very little non-fermentables in it and
most of the OG comes from simple sugars.  The kind of sugars that
all yeasts can process.  I think (?) glucose, fructose and sucrose
are the main ones.


So anyway your cider must was mostly these simple sugars and the
ale yeast just went to town.

Probably not.

Please feel free to add to or correct anything I said up their,
I would enjoy hearing more about yeast attenuation.

Now onto my own expirements.


So cider is supposed to ferment dry.  Well I would 
like a little residual sweetness in my cider.


So I figure if I boost up the OG of my cider the yeast will
ferment until killed off by the alcohol it producess.  Of course
my long standind question is how high does the original gravity
have to be to get some residual sweetness?


Well last weekend during a 3 hour sparge, I had nothing better to
do.  So I took about 3 pounds of sugar and stirred it up into a
gallon of water.  This yeilded an OG of 1.130.  I then added a bunch
of yeast nutrient and adjusted the pH with acid blend until I got it
in the 5.0 range.  I then boiled and cooled it, added some Whitbread
ale yeast, and stuck it aside.  I wish I had some champagne and wine
yeast around at the time to due a comparison, oh well.


At this point it's still fermenting.  When it finishes I'll let
you know where the FG is, what the % alcohol is, and how it
tastes.  (Just think a pure cane sugar must, fermenting at 80F,
what a flavor profile!-)


Cheers,

"To one and all.  The SunOS product sendmail

We're about fed up enough with this and other problems to consider
replacing the system with something more reliable."


Sorry. Maybe this will get fixed someday.

assume that you are moderate in everything.
you now have an eXcess of moderation, a contradiction.


eXcessiveness is clearly the way to go...
