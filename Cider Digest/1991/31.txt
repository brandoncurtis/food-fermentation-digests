Subject: Apples


There was a talk on cider given at the local winemaking club the other day, and 
although I didn't attend, I have copies of the handouts that were made. On the o
ffchance that some of these might be of interest to the board here are some of t
he main points about ingredients. I can't credit the author because I don't know
 who he is.
  Raw Materials
 1 Use only fully ripe apples
    No windfalls or half-rotten fruit
 2 No modern day apples contain the correct balance of acid and tannin necessary
 to yield a vintage cider.
 3  A blend of sweet and tart is best for fresh cider
   Include astringents (crab or wild apples) in blend for hard cider
 4 Desired blend is
    30 - 60% sweet
    10 - 20% tart
    10 - 20% aromatic
     5 - 20% astringent




 Apple Varieties

I can post if anyone is interested.
