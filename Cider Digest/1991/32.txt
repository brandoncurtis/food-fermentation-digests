Subject: Fermentation and aging times?


Hello!


I've been a passive observer since this group started, but I would now 
like to ask for some advice from those more experienced than I.


I made one batch from farmer's market grade cider, with several pounds of
rasins and sugar.  It resulted in remotly alcoholic cider that was too
sweet to be enjoyed in quantity.  I though that the rasins would provide
necessary yeast nutrients, but perhaps they had some preservatives, or
perhaps I didn't ferment it long enough.


Anyway, I got cider fever the other day, and created a concoction that is
fermenting madly in my garage.  I wish to make a quality cider this time,
and would like to know if anyone has sugestions on how long I should keep
it in the primary, secondary, and bottles?  Here is the gist of the
recipe:


4 gal fresh cider (blends of Red Delicious, Gravenstein, and something else)
1 gal spiced fresh cider
3 lbs mesquite honey
3 lbs light brown sugar
2 lbs corn sugar
1 lb rasins
 
The ciders were labeled "no sugar added, no preservatives", as was the 
rasins.  The sugars, honey, and rasins were heated to ~180F in one gal
of cider.  All was then dumped into my 7gal plastic primary fermenter.  
I used a quart of active mead(left over from the last racking) to prime
the must, and it was fermenting within the hour.  I've skimmed through
most of my making hard cider book, but I missed any reference to time.
Should it be bottled after fermentation is complete like ale, or should
it be given time to sit like wine and mead?  If I put it into beer
bottles and cap it, will it improve with age?  Will putting it into wine
bottles and corking it make a better beverage?  These questions are 
asked in order to bypass the experience gained by bad judgement.
