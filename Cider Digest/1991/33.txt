Subject: stuck ferment




  I am trying to develop a method for making sweet, sparkling cider.
I have run 2 batches on health-food store, expensive, hazy apple
juice.  This time I tried "Hardin Apple Cider" in the grocery
store, which was $3/gallon.  This is a standard clear apple juice.
The label listed NO preservatives.


  well...  the ferment never started.  I pitched some slurry
of wyeast bavarian wheat yeast.  My best guess is that the juice
DID have preservatives, and the label lied.  My questions are:
  1) Is it legal to lie about preservatives on the ingredients list
     in america?


  2) What brands of juice have people sucessfully fermented?
     (I'm just a beginner, i will NOT squish apples until i
     know what I'm doing.)


  3) What brands fermented well AND came out clear???


  4) What preservatives kill yeast?  Since many people use
     camden tablets, i immagine sulfites are ok, but what
     are the chenicals which kill yeast?


  also... a bit of a warning.  The "Hardin Apple Cider" tasted
like s#@t.  I will not buy it again.  However, I would still like
to see if i can save this batch.  At least it will give me
some experience with pasturizing to kill the yeast after
carbonation, and before all the sugar is gone.
