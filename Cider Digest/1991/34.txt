Subject: pasturizing to kill yeast?


First, a request.  All I see here are questions but no answers.  If you
are responding to a question, please post it so that all of us neophytes
can learn.


Aaron Birenboim raised an interesting point (well, to me at least).  I
had never thought of bottling the cider and pasturizing it when it was still
sweet.  It's what people do when they can vegtables.  They heat to kill (and to
seal) then let it cool.


Aaron, is this what you meant?  Has anyone ever bottled and then
heated up to 160-170 F for some time to kill the yeast?  Is it dangerous?
Will the bottle explode from expanding CO2, or do you pasturize right away?
Is it stupid?  Does it change the flavor?  It sounds like it is better than
dumping a load of chemicals in to poison the yeast (and slowly ourselves).
Can anyone describe experiences?


Post please!
