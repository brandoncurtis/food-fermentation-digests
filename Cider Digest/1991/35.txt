My mom used to (and may still) can at home.  Heating the fruits/juices is
done in open containers, poured into sterile bottles, then sealed.  The seal
is maintained by the vacuum that is formed by the cooling of the contents of
the bottle (food, juice, and gas--which is air/water vapor, not CO2).


>Is it stupid?


Yes and no.  Yes, it preserves the juice, but so does freezing; frozen apple
juice can be kept for up to a year.  And while freezing does not kill the
naturally-occuring microbes, it does send them into a state of dormancy.


>Does it change the flavor?


I was up in Sebastopol (about 50 mi. N. of San Francisco; one of California's
primary apple-growing regions) a couple of weeks ago; my SO and I were on a
cider/wine/beer-tasting trek.  One of the places that I stopped at had both
pasteurized (sold in glass bottles) and unpasteurized (sold frozen solid in
plastic bottles) cider.  Both were the same formulation (predominantly 
Gravenstein, with some Jonathan and Delicious blended in).  The big differences
between the two were:


* Color.  The unpasteurized cider was reddish/brownish.  The pasteurized cider
  was a whitish brown.


* Sediment. Not as much in the unpasteurized as in the pasteurized.


* Smell. The unpasteurized smelled like, well, apples.  The pasteurized smelled
  like standard garden-variety processed apple juice.


* Taste.  The unpasteurized tasted like apples; it was light, fruity, and
  exciting. The pasteurized had a syrupy flavor to it.  I suspect that this
  was caused by the heat cooking out the volatiles, as well as killing the
  beasties.  I also suspect that some of the sugars were somehow converted.


My final analysis was that the two juices could not be compared.  Since it
actually cost *less* for the unpasteurized juice ($3.50/gallon -vs- $2.50/half
gallon), I returned to the bay area with six gallons for use in my Holiday
cider.

Most of the cider recipes that I've seen published either recommend adding
Campden tables (Sodium Metabisulphite) or neutral spirits (vodka, usually) to
kill the beasties.  Neither is really poisonous to most people, but some
people are allergic to sulphites, and alcohol is, in some circles, socially
unacceptible.


Speaking of cider, here is the recipe for my Holiday cider.:


        5 gal. unpasteurized and unfiltered sweet cider 
        1 fresh nutmeg nut, ground
        2.5 tablespoons cloves
        10 4" cinnamon sticks
        Juice and peels[*] of three lemons
        48 fl. oz. Maple syrup


[*] I peeled the lemons with a potato peeler, in order to limit the amount of
    pulp.


4 gal. of the sweet cider went immediately into the carboy.  Into a saucepan
went 1/2 gal. of what remained, the spices (in a spice bag), and the lemon
peels.  After simmering for 30 minutes, the lemon juice and syrup were added.
Five minutes later, I removed the peels and spice bag, and poured the solution
into the carboy, then used the remaining fresh juice to fill to neck level.


The initial SG was 1.100, and the stuff has been bubbling away for two weeks
now.  I hope to be ready to bottle by Thanksgiving.
