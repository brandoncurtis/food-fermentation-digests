On a whim, I picked up two gallons of fresh sweet cider at a farmstand
last night.  I had the innocent thought of using up some dry yeast I
had left over from beer making (I have sinceswitched to liquid yests
for beer).  Then, things kinda got out of hand.


I wanted to retain some residual sweetness, so I figured I'd add some
wort made from some crytal malt (my freezer is well syocked with
grains).  Well, while I hand the grain mill out, I threw in some pale
malt grain.  Now, I figured I should mash this stuff and get some
usablesugars out of it so I did a 1 hour infusion mash, spaged and boiled.  


Next, I went back to the freezer to put away the grains, and I found
some light DME; "oh what the heck" sais I, and I throws it into the boil.


So, now I figure I should pasturize the cider, so I adds the hot wort
to it and heat it to 180.  While I'm heating this glop, I clean up some
more, and find six pounds of honey I was saving for a mead....  "Hmmm,
a little of this couldn't hurt... could it?"; I added all six pounds.


Now I'm about a gallon short of filling my carbuoy, so tonight I'll
throw in another gallon or so of fresh cider.


I have no idea what I have created, save that it will be STRONG (O.G.
measured 1.110 at racking to primary)


The total recipe looks something like this:  for 5 Gallons


1.5 # 10 0 crystal malt
1.5 # 6 Row Pale malt
   ===  grains were infusion mashed, sparged, and boiled


2.5 # light DME  (boiled with grain wort)
2 Gallons fresh Cider
6 # honey
1 cinamon stick ground finely


1 packet EDME Ale Yeat
1 Packet Red Star Wine Yeast
   === yeast was started as a slurry and pitched immediately into cooled wort/ci
der


Plus 1-2 Gallons fresh cider added one day into ferment

Subject: my first batch




I recently made my first batch of hard cider and I am pleased with
the results.  I have a neighbor with an apple orchard and he
likes beer.  I had him over for a few homebrews and I got talking
about wanting to make some hard cider.  Well, he gave me 5 gallons
of his fresh cider (he told be the blend but the brown ale good
and I forgot :-) and we split the results.  I made two different
batches, a one-gallon malt batch and a four gallon brown sugar batch.


The one gallon batch:
        1 gallon fresh cider, boiled
        2 cups light dried malt extract
        1 cup 1028 Wyeast (London Ale) slurry


        OG and FG not taken


The four gallon batch:
        4 gallons fresh cider
        1 pound brown sugar
        2 packages dried yeast (the stuff you get from beer kits and *never* use
)


        OG 1.060, FG 1.000 (could this be right?)


I fermented both for 19 days in by basement (~62oF).  I primed each
with corn sugar and bottled.  I did mix 1/2 tsp. of unflavored
gelatin in the priming syrup for the four gallon batch (remember I
am sharing this).


Impressions
The one gallon batch was very cloudy so I kept it to my self.
I did not taste it yet but I plan to in a week.
The four gallon batch was a bright golden color and very clear.
Sweet enough to drink without mixing with soft cider.  Slightly
alcoholic but not tart.
