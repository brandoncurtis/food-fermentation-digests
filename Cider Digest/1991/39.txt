Subject: Sulphurous smells


Greetings,
        This past weekend I started my batch of cider.  The recipe was 4.75 
gal. fresh cider (I couldn't help drinking some) of which 1gal was heated 
to 160F for 30 min. and had 2.5 lb light DME, 1lb honey (clover) and some 
mulling spices tossed in.  I pitched Edme ale yeast at 70F (after aerating 
by stirring) and within 12 hours had a nice fermentation going. 
        Now to my question.  After a day of glugging I noticed a sulphurous 
smell coming from the cider.  I have heard that this does happen with meads 
and it will disappear, but has anyone had this happen with cider?  Should 
I be concerned?


                             Joe

In response to your questions, I currently live and brew in Arlington,
MA; although if plans go as we'd like, I will be moving to a new
brewery in Northboro sometime after the end of January.  


I'm not sure when this "stuff"  (for lack of a catchy name, I'm just
calling it  sticky apple wine) will be ready, it took off like a bat
outa Dan Quales bellfrie and I still have the blow-off tube in it.  I
suspect it will be about three months till it's consumable though. 
I'll let you know when it's done.


I used Red Star "Wine Yeast"; I didn't see a number or strain on the
lable, but I may have missed it.


You mentioned the "wort processors"; is this the club that I've seen in
Zymurgy?  I'm interested if you have any info on it.


Thanks for the response,


/greg
