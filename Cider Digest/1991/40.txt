My one an only (so far) batch of cider (made last spring for my wife,
a hardened fan of Blackthorn Dry) pulled this same sulphurous stunt on
me but my wife swore that the smell wasn't bad, it was what cider was
supposed to smell like.  I took her at her word and, after 5 weeks of
fermentation, we had a very clear, dry, sparkling cider; not the
Blackthorn immitation we were striving for, but good, nontheless.


My advice is, don't worry, so long as the fermentation continues.

OK, folks, here's your chance to put in your ideas:
I'm looking to brew a fairly light (low alcohol), spiced
cider for Christmas. (OK, maybe for next Christmas!)
I was expecting to start with a fresh blended cider,
heavy on the Gravensteins for aromatics, and add little
or no adjunct sugars (DME, honey, etc.) I'd like to 
halt the fermentation with a bit of residual sugar, and
keg- or bottle-condition for moderate carbonation.
Neglecting the spices, I'd say something like a 50/50
mix of Blackthorne's and Martinelli's (sparkling juice).
For flavorings, probably the usual cinnamon, clove,
nutmeg, maybe allspice.


How about the mechanics of this? I've been happily brewing
beer for some years, and have had pretty good luck with
a light, but still flavorful, low alcohol brew. With the
beer, I just let it ferment out, and keg-condition it
under CO2 pressure. With the cider, though, I want to
keep back some sugars, and if I bottle it, I need the
secondary fermentation there, but again, dont want too
great an attenuation...


Thanks!  Dave

Is the sulphurous smell the rotten-eggs-like H2S (hydrogen sulphide) smell?
My reference book, Sweet & Hard Cider by Annie Proulx & Lew Nichols says
that certain strains of yeast, particularly a typical Montrachet all-
purpose wine yeast, can spontaneously start producing H2S during fermentation.
It is curious to note that a typical Montrachet yeast and typical ale
yeast are both Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (although undoubtably different
strains).  If your smell is H2S, then its possible that Edme ale yeast
is one of the Cider-Stinkers.
