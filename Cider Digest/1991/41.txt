  I had a book which suggests that you sugar to taste
(or in your case, stop fermentation early), bottle,
and then pasturize when you have desired carbonation.


  I will be trying this with my present batch.  i'll
share the results.


  BTW, the pasturization method is to place the bottles covered
in water in a large kettle, and bring to about 170F. Hold for
20 Min or so, then cool slowly.


  the only problem i have with this is that i will have to waste
several bottles while checking carbonation.  I am planning on using
a method i'm stealing from a soda-pop recipe.  Put 1 l. of cider
in a plastic soda-pop bottle.  When the pop bottle feels about
as tight as it did when it had soda...  pasturize.

p.s.  sorry about the mixed use of "soda" and "pop".  I just
moved to "pop" country from "soda" country, and i'm a bit
confused ;-)
