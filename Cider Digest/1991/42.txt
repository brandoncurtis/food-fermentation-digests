  Pasturizing cider (or beer or whatever) *is* a good way to stop all
growth, but it is also a very good way to get hurt, especially if you're
dealing with a carbonated beverage.  I've had many bottles explode in the
pasturization process.  It's not really a problem if you have a heavy cover
on the pot, you just get cider/beer/whatver and glass mixed in with the
heated water.  But, the bottles do EXPLODE, in capital letters!  I've heard
a BOOM from the cellar, and gone down to find the ceramic-on-steel cover
blown across the brew-room, and shards of glass (and beer) all over.  I'm
glad I wasn't checking the water temperature!  I'm now also reluctant to
pasturize, but when I do, it's at a lower temp (~140) but for a longer time
(~45 min.), and I'm *extremely* cautious.


  The point is, use a heavy cover on the pot when you pasturize, use the lid
as a shield when you want to see what's happening in the pot, and let the
the bottles cool quite a bit before you take them out.  Don't get hurt.
