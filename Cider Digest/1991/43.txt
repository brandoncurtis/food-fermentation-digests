   I would prefer not to be in the same building with anyone pasteurizing
a liquid that was carbonated to taste at room temperature. As has been
pointed out several times recently in HBD, gas solubility is inversely
related to solution temperature.
   The pressure in an uncarbonated liquid being pasteurized will also go up
(~20% for the gas in the headspace, plus maybe 3-6 psi for the increased vapor
pressure of the liquid), but that's not much compared to forcing 12-24
fluid ounces of CO2 into headspace of 1/2-ounce or so (figures for std.
beer bottles; adjust according to how full you fill soda bottles). Yes, you
wouldn't actually get a 24x jump in pressure because not all the CO2 could
come out of solution with that much counterpressure, but it would still be
enough to be dangerous.
   I don't know how beer factories pasteurize their beer, but I'm pretty sure
they don't do it in the bottle/can.


PS---I suspect you won't want cider nearly as carbonated as soda anyway,
but that's a matter of taste.
