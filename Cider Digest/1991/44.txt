Well, I remember it from my tour of the Olympia brewery that they do
pasteurize in the bottle/can. The bottles go through a hot water shower
on a large conveyer belt. Of course, your end product may end up tasting
like Oly!


On another note, I had a bottle of Grant's Yakima Cider last week. 
At $1.40/bottle I won't be buying a lot of it, but it was pretty good.
Nice smell of apples, clean tasting, semi-sweet, little aftertaste. Some
off 'yeast' flavor, but quite mild - I had to look (taste) for it. 6%
alcohol. 


This was the first hard cider I've had for over ten years (since I was
in Normandy, France). I will have to try and make some soon!
