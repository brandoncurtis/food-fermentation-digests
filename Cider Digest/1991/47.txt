Subject: Botched batch


Hello


This tall tale is about a botched batch of cider.  I wanted to make good
one, as my last year's batch was sickenly sweet and wimpy.  Here is
my new batch:


5 gal fresh cider(various blends)
3 lbs mesquite honey
3 lbs brown sugar
2 lbs white sugar
1 lb unpreserved rasins
5 t yeast nutrient
Montrachet yeast(from 1 qt. mead starter)


Well, it bubbled and fumed for 3 weeks.  Made the whole garage smell
funky.  I racked it after three weeks, and tasted.  It was VERY
alcoholic.  So much so that it burned my mouth.  Also very unbalanced.
Dry as a bone in the desert heat.  I thought I could add a lot of sugar,
making it so alcoholic to kill the yeast, and leaving a bit of residual
sweetness.  I musta got a package of bad-ass yeast.  I didn't measure 
SG or FG(damn), but I estimate the alcohol content to be over 15%.
What to do?!!


To be honest, I paniced.  I grabbed another 3lbs of mesquite honey, 
boiled it in cider, cooled, and plopped it into the fermenter.  To
balance the expected sweetness, I added a cup of lmon juice to raise
the pH(tartnss?).  Weak activity flaired up for a day, then stopped dead.
That was two weeks ago.  I sampled a bit last night, and it was good.
Not great, but good.  The added honey and lemon juice balanced the 
overwhelming alcohol.  It smells great too.  There is still a bit
of astringent aftertaste, but I hope that will go away with age.
I guess what I've created is effectivly cyser, but at least I salvaged
the batch.
