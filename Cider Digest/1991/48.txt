Hi Folks,


I recently found three commercial varieties of hard cider in my
local beer store (Marty's in Newton, MA).


What I found where: two products of Bulmers; the "Medium Sweet"
Woodpecker Cider at 4%, and the "Medium Dry" Strongbow Cider at 5%;
and the Woodchuck "Amber Cider" at 5% of the Cerniglia winery in
Vermont.


Both the Woodpecker and the Strongbow came in 1 liter bottles and
where date stamped August 22nd 1993.  This leads me to assume that
they where bottled on August 22nd 1991 and given a two year shelf
life.  Resonabley fresh if this is true.


The Woodchcuk came in a six pack of 11.5oz bottles and I couldn't
find any date markings on the bottles or six pack holder.


This being the cider season makes me wonder what other commercial
varieties are available in the New England area.  Anyboby know of
others?
