Subject: Attenuative vs unattenuative....




Gee I decided not to cheat (I can read the mail as it comes into the collection
buffer :-), and to wait to try to clarify this until it was sent out.


OK I perhaps am guilty of creating some confusion.


In a previous discussion I was talking about how to avoid getting really dry
cider, and a I don't recall the exact wording I used but I was trying to
basically make the point that Ale yeast will consume less sugar than Champagne
yeast in general. I was trying to explain (based on my experience) how to avoid
getting super dry ciders. I recommended using a less attenuative yeast, ie one
that has a lower alcohol tolerance, and will therefore consume less sugar
before quitting, leaving some sugars left in the resulting beverage.


Apologies if this is improper or confusing terminology.
The comparison I was making was between types of yeast (ie Ale vs Champagne or
Wine), and not for a given type of yeast (say Chico Ale vs Whitbread Ale).


So the advise is to check your initial gravity, have some ballpark of what you
want your final gravity to be, and then select your yeast accordingly.


Other techniques are to use the natural yeasts (I'd like to hear more from
people who've done this), or to fortify with unfermentables (say my addition of
malt extract which contains some unfermentable sugars).


Hope this helps clarify things a little..

I would suspect that the primary sugar present in cider before fermentation
is fructose.  Probably a few complex sugars as well, but I suspect not as
much as in beer wort.


There are two manufacturers of commercial cider in the Chesapeake Bay
area.  One of them is out in the Va. Beach direction, and produces a fairly
sweet but noticeably alcoholic cider with a slight tartness.  Good stuff,
and I believe they are called the "Chesapeake Bay Brewery."  The other one
is on the Eastern Shore, and makes a rather watery and tasteless cider
with a lot of alcohol.  I don't know the name of the firm offhand, but I
believe they also make scuppernong wine which is worthy of use as a carb
cleaner.

I have a Granny Smith tree, and a pear tree of unknown variety, which are presen
tly shedding fruit all over ny patio. Rather than having all this stuff
rotting on my patio I figure I might as well try and make something out of it.
 I can borrow a grape crusher, the question is will this be suitable for crushin

same question for the pears and perry?

Subject: Answers to lots of questions (long and authoritative)


Hello all.  I'd like to throw my 20 cents worth (sorry, inflation) in on
several topics that have been flying about here.  To introduce myself, let me
say I started making cider last fall, and made 2 okay batches, and a bunch of
mediocre batches and flops.  From the mistakes and books, I learned enough to
hopefully avoid most problems this fall.  So maybe the following text isn't
that authoritative after all; at least I tried. :->

1) Wines & Beers of Old New England, A How-to-Do-It History
   by Sanborn C. Brown, The University Press of New England, ISBN 0-87451-148-8


   This is a fascinating look at the history of fermentation in New England.
   It includes cider, of course, because the early settlers could grow apples
   much better than barley.  However, the book does not include lots of
   practical advice for modern cider makers, nor does it discuss proper
   sanitation in any way.


2) Sweet & Hard Cider (Making It, Using It, and Enjoying It)
   by Annie Proulx & Lew Nichols, Garden Way Publishing, ISBN 0-88266-352-6


   A relatively good book.  It discusses lots about cider, including apple
   varieties, growing your own apples, apple cider vinegar, the law on making
   fermented apple products, etc.  It does offer some advice I don't agree
   with, though.  (See below for more).


   (Note: My wife Diana just read this and says that Annie Proulx is her
   cousin; although Diana is currently freaked out by the coincidence, I

   this out, and is therefore unbiased.)


3) Making the Best Apple Cider
   by Annie Proulx, Garden Way Publishing, Pownal, Vermont 05261

   discussion of which apples to use in blending cider.

apple.  "The apples are bright red, striped, oblate, angular, and rather
lop-sided.  The medium to large fruits are firm, juicy, and have an aromatic,
crisp, white flesh.  The juice is rich and vinous, and is good to pick up
more subdued blends."


For those of you in the Boston area, you can hand pick Gravensteins right now
at the Nagog Hills Orchard, Nagog Hill Road, Littleton, MA, (508) 486-3264.
Price: $8 per 1/2 bushel.  (You can't miss the sign on Route 2 outbound near
the Acton/Littleton border.)  And my wife Diana says: "they're pretty good!"

If you wanted to go the kit route, my local homebrewing store, the Modern
Brewer (in Cambridge, MA, (617) 868-5580) has cider making kits with canned
cider concentrate. Alas, the kit is not listed in their catalog, so I can't
give you the price.

To have a wine that is "not too sweet yet avoids the excessive tartness and
'watery' quality that seems to afflict dry ciders is a noble goal.  What you
are talking about here is balance; the same balance that you look for in wine.
After all, hard cider is nothing more than fruit wine.  What you are trying to
balance is the residual sugar, the acids, and the tannins.


To get a good balance, you could go to your chemistry set and put a bunch of
additives into whatever cider comes your way, or you can go for good cider.
This is *my* current problem, finding good cider.  According to reference (3)
above, "There are 'perfect' cider apples, those varieties which have a good
balance of aromatic oils, sugar, tannin, and acid, but they're rare and
becoming rarer.  The Roxbury Russet, Golded Russet, Ribston Pippin, and
Nonpareil were long treasured as fine single-variety cider apples."


Therefore, "Most of the best ciders and apple juices of the world are blends".
"'Wild' apples make better hard cider than 'tame' apples".  "If wild apples
are available, and your cider base is bland and lacking in character, you
can blend in wild apple juice or crab apple juice as you would the juice of
domestic varieties with higher acid and tannin levels."  Reference (3) includes
a list of apple varieties broken down into High/Medium/Low Acid, Aromatic,
and Astringent(Tannin) classifications.  The list is too long for me to
type here today.


QUESTION: DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY WILD APPLE OR CRAB APPLE CIDER
IN THE MASSACHUSETTS AREA?


An Important Note:
   Reference (2), and a lot of Wine/Beer hobby store advice told me to test
the cider and correct (i.e. increase) its acid content before fermentation.
I found that this is not necessary, especially when you use Red Star
Champagne Yeast (see below).




############################## Avoiding Vinegar ###############################


I have a friend that has tried to make cider many times, but ended up with
vinegar each time.  However, I only got vinegar the first time I tried to make
cider, and that was becase I knew nothing about proper sanitation for
fermentation.

Reference (2) above indicates that "acetobacter (acetic-acid-causing bacteria)
is present in *all* juice, and can survive the anaerobic fermentation, ...
sulfiting, and ... revive to launch an assault on the cider *if it has air*."
(The *emphasis* is from the authors!)  They say that pasteurizing will kill the
bacteria.  But they *do not* recommend pasteurizing the original, unfermented
cider.  Instead, they recommend making sure that the cider has a high enough
acid level (low enough PH), that you add sulfites to the juice before
fermenting, and that you absolutely minimize exposure to the air.  They do
say you can pasteurize the feremented cider so it won't turn to vinegar or
to stop fermentation.  (More on this below.)


An Important Note:
   From reference (2), I get the feeling that cider is even more sensitive to
   oxidation than beer.  You probably want to avoid any exposure of your cider
   to air on those grounds alone.


Your equipment can also pollute the cider.  Be sure to use properly sanitatize
anything that will contact the must or fermented cider, by using a B-Brite,
bleach, or metabisulfite sulution.


> From Bob Gorman:
> Is it OK to boil Soft Cider?  Or will this cause a hazing problem?
> (I wish sterilize with heat rather than with chemicals this time)


Reference (2) indicates that pasteurizing cider can "damage its delicate
flavor".  It doesn't say if pasteurizing will increase pectin hazing.  But if
it did, I would avoid using pectic enzyme to clear it up because (2) says that
"studies show that ciders and apple juices clarified by the use of pectic
enzymes are higher in methanol, the result of the demethylation of juice
pectins".

Sulfiting is the process of introducing SO2 as a bacteria and wild yeast
killer to the must.  ("Must" is the term for soon-to-be-fermented juice.
In making cider, it has the same general meaning as "wort" does when making
beer.)  You can get free SO2 into your must in many ways.  The easiest way
for us at-home folks is to use Sodium or Potassium metabisulfite.  A Campden
tablet is 12 grains of sodium metabisulfite.


An Important Note:
   Reference (2) indicates that the amount of sulfite you should add varies in
   relationship to your must's PH (it includes a table to guide you, but
   basically: the higher the PH the more sulfite).  I found that it is very
   easy to get a nasty sulfite odor in your final product, so don't use as much
   sulfite as (2) tells you!  I would use about 1/2 a Campden tablet for 1
   gallon of must.  Reference (2) also says to add the sulfite 24 hours before
   fermenting.  Keep that must refrigerated during that 24 hours!  I've also
   heard advice to add sulfite every time you rack the cider for two reasons:
   To prevent oxidation and to kill off any bacteria that may have fallen in.
   Don't do this!  Just make sure that you rack very cleanly and without froth.

I'm glad you asked that.  There are more kinds of cider sickness than just
acetification.  Reference (2) says that you really want your cider to have more
than 5.75% alcohol in order for it to store well (9% if you don't pasteurize
it!).  The unpreserved cider that I buy at my local farm stand, from Carlson
Orchard in Harvard MA, usually has a 1.044 specific gravity, which is about
5.5% potential alcohol.  (Note that the Carlson Orchard's wife is my wife
Diana's second cousin; how's that for further coincidence?)  Reference (1) says
that healthy apples usually produce cider of about 5% alcohol, but the late
1700's tavern standard was 7.5% alcohol, incresed partly in order to improve
the cider's keeping quality.  So I think you definately want to add some sort
of sugar to keep your cider healthy!

Reference (2) recommends "sugar, boiled cider concentrate, and honey" as
"most suitable for modern tastes."  "The sugars can be cane or corn - white,
brown, or golden.  The darker sugars slightly flavor the finished cider.
The best honeys are apple blossom, orchard, and clover honey, all delicate
and harmonious with apple aromatics.  Buckwheat and goldenrod honey overpower
the cider."


Reference (2) also says "Fresh cider, reduced from one-half to one-quarter of
its original volume by boiling, was called 'boiled cider' and was often
used as a pre-fermentation sweetener to boost alcohol."


Reference (2) says: "If molasses is used, the entire barrel of cider ... will
taste powerfully of sorghum.  Maple syrup ... can do strange things to cider.
(Those who) have tried it ... reported the finished cider has an off-flavor
faintly resembling mold."


Remember that Papazians "Complete Joy of Home Brewing" points out that
brown sugar is white sugar with molasses added.


Reference (2) also says that natural raisins have "served as both yeast and
nutrients to cider for centuries".




######################### Yeast and Fermenting, etc. ##########################


> Bob Gorman:
> How high does a Starting Gravity have to be to have a fairly sweet
> resulting Hard Cider: if using champagne yeast?; if using ale yeast?
> (Say with Red Star Champagne and Whitbread Ale yeast)


Regardless of yeast, you have to chose a few things first:


1) What % alcohol do you want.
2) How sweet do you want the cider to be?


This will determine your initial and final SG.  Then you just have to control
the fermentation somehow.


The following table from reference (2) shows the final SG and its relationship
with the cider characteristics.


     Specific Gravity     Cider Characteristics
     ----------------     ---------------------
      1.000 - 1.005       Dry Cider
      1.010 - 1.015       Semisweet cider with 20-30 grams of sugar/liter
      1.018 - 1.020       Sweet cider with 30-40 grams of sugar/liter
      1.020 - 1.025       Very sweet cider


Therefore, to get a slightly sweet semisweet cider at 6%, you'll want an inital
SG of around 1.065.  (I eyeballed this from my triple-scale hydrometer.)  The
trick is getting the yeast to quit at the right time.  You can do several
things to stop the fermentation:


   1) Add potassium sorbate (also called sorbistat K).  This stuff is
      probably available at your local homebrewing store.  1/2 teaspoon per
      gallon will stop fermentation.  This is the exact same stuff that is
      used as a preservative in store-bought cider.


      This answers:
      > From Don Reid:
      > There was a mention of additives retarding the yeast.
      > Has anyone got more info?


   2) Pasteurize the cider at the appropriate stage.  Reference (2) says
      "place the bottels in a canner or, for the tall quart bottles, in
      a deeper kettle.  The bottles should be in racks and covered with
      water to a level an inch above the caps.  Bring the water to a boil,
      boil for sixty seconds, then turn off the heat and raise the rack to
      let the bottles cool.  When cool enough to handle, lift out the
      bottles carefully, avoiding drafts or stray splashes of cold water.
      Place them on their sides on towels or layers of newspaper.
      Don't let the bottles touch.  The air should circulate around them."


      Amazingly, the above paragraph is about pasteurizing carbonated
      cider.  The idea is to ferment the cider dry, add additional sugar
      to bring it up to your sweetness standards, allow to condition for
      3-4 days, then pasteurize.  If anybody has the guts to do it this
      way and it works without explosions, I'd like to hear about it!


   3) Control the yeast itself.  See below for an idea on this.


> From Dan Hall:
> I pitched Red Star champagne yeast.
> 
> And take Jay's recommendation of a less-attenuative yeast to heart.  The

Well, not knowing about attenuative yeasts, let me say what I found.  I HATE
RED STAR CHAMPAGNE YEAST (at least for apple cider).  The resulting cider
was Dry and Tart.  Do not add any acid to any must which you intend to ferment
with this yeast - I regretted it everytime.


> From Marc Rouleau:

I did try and like Lalvin dry wine yeasts #1122 and #1118.  The #1122 in
particular seemed to leave a little sweetness, even in must that wasn't
fortified with extra sugar before fermentation.  I intend to try ale yeasts
too, hoping that they'll quit a little early.


However, I agree with Marc that it is probably not inability to ferment the
fruit sugars that causes the yeast to quit.  Instead, I have a theory about
why a yeasts stops fermenting in cider: lack of nutrients.  According to
reference (2), "the ... nutrients available (are) minimal in apple juices".  If
you can somehow minimize the nutrients, the fermentation will be slower, but
the yeast will be less likely to finish the fermentation.


An Important Note:
   Reference (2) states that the ubiquitious montrachet all-purpose wine yeast
   is not recommended for cider.  It can cause a H2S rotten egg smell in your
   wine.


Another Important Note:
   Some texts (indeed, even reference (2) above) council you to add yeast
   nutrients (which are basically ammonium sulphate and thiamine) to your
   cider.  I would not unless your fermentation gets complete stuck at a very
   sweet point.  Yeast nutrients will pretty much guarantee a completely dry
   cider.


There may also be a way to reduce the nitrogen in your must to begin with.
Reference (2) talks about how the French make a wonderful sweet cider with a
natural method (no sulphites or sugar fortification).  In the first, very slow
stage of fermentation, the must is left in a "defacation vat", where a brown
scum called "chapeau brun" forms on top and the lees sink.  (Evidently, this
is called "keeving" instead of "defacation" in Britain.)  In every batch that
I made, both these things happened, even though I pitched yeast that was rarin'
to go.  According to the book, "Most of the yeasts, bacteria, and molds are
captured in the lees and chapeau brun.  This process brings about an important
decrease in the nitrogen content of the juice; deprived of nitrogen the must
ferments very slowly and gradually purifies itself, becoming increasingly
likely to give a naturally sweet cider."


This gives rise to the third method of stopping fermentation:


   3) Control the yeast by removing nutrients.  Rack the clear must from
      between the lees and chapeau brun before full primary fermentation
      begins.  This will be tricky to time; you'll have to watch your cider
      closely.  (If you let it go too far, the active fermentation will mix the
      whole shebang up.)  Be sure to keep the cider pretty cool at this stage;
      reference (2) recommends 50-56 degrees F.


      I also think it will be pretty important to control the amount of
      yeast that you pitch.


A fourth possibilty is also raised in (4): Rack and/or filter the cider
at appropriate times to remove the cider from the yeast.  Since I don't
have a filtration setup, and I don't want to rack too much, I'm not going
to try this one.




######################## What Am I Going To Try First? ########################


> From Thomas Manteufel:
> Please list amounts in your recipes if possible.


Here is the first recipe that I'm going to try:


   Jay Hersh's recipe for draft cider, modified with my own details and
   adjusted for my 3 gallon carboy:


   @) If I can, I'll use 3/4 gallon wild or crab apple juice with 2.25 gallons
      of farmstand sweet cider.
   A) Add 1/2 of a crushed Campden tablet to each of the three gallons of
      cider.  Refrigerate overnight. 
   B) Place 2 gallons of cider into a sanitized carboy.
   C) Boil .5 gallons of water or cider with .75 to 1 lb sugar and .75 to
      1 lb of light, unhopped malt.  Cool to 160 degrees F.  Add to carboy.
      (If I cannot get wild/crab cider, I'm tempted to throw in 3/4 teaspoon
      of grape tannin at the end of the boil.)
   D) Top off carboy, but leave about .5 inches free below the start of curve
      of neck.
   E) Pitch 1/3 package of dry Lalvin #1122 wine or 1/4 package of Whitbread
      ale yeast.
   F) Cover carboy with sanitized air lock. Maintain at around 55-60 degrees F.
   G) When chapeau brun is fully formed, rack cleanly to another carboy.
   H) Ferment at 55-60 degrees F (maybe 5 degrees warmer) until desired final
      specific gravity / sweetness, or hopefully it will stop at the right
      place.  Be prepared for blow-off if the fermentation gets wild in the
      initial stage.  The full fermentation might take a month or more, so I'll
      rack after 2-3 weeks if there is a lot of lees and the cider is not *too*
      active.
   I) If the fermentation quit early, I'll add small amounts of sterilized
      yeast nutrient until the fermentation hits the right place.
   J) If it quit at the right place (as I hope), I'll pitch another 1/8 - 1/4
      teaspoons of yeast before bottling so that the fresh yeast will be able
      to carbonate the cider.
   K) If the cider went dry, I'll add 1/2 cup of sugar before bottling, and
      add sweet soft cider before drinking as Chris Woodward suggested.


Here is another recipe for you new cider makers that is very easy to make.  It
worked great for me, and can be done with no equipment but an air lock and
blow-off tube:


   A) Buy a 1 gallon jug of cider.  Let it sit until it is at fall room
      temperature (around 70 degrees, but +/- 10 degrees is OK).
   B) Open the cider, and pitch in 1/3 to 1/2 packet of Lavlin #1122 dry
      wine yeast.
   C) Cover tightly with a sanitized stopper fitted with a blow off tube.
   D) When blow-off subsides, replace blow-off tube with a sanitized air lock.
      Keep fermenting at room temperature.
   E) Cider should be fully fermented in 1-2 weeks.  Rack off the cider or
      carefully pour the cider off of the lees.
   F) Drink the cider still with a little sweet cider.  Be sure to tightly
      cover the cider, and keep it in your refrigerator.  I found that the
      cider really didn't need to age in order to be enjoyable.


      Or, bottle with 1/6 cup of sugar dissolved in 1/2 cup of boiling water.
      Let the cider condition/age for 1-2 weeks.  Enjoy.


For those of you wondering how the cider came out being fermented in a plastic
gallon jug:  I found absolutely no traces of any plastic or chemical taste in
my batch.

Subject: What a concept?


A cider mailing list?  What could you learn from a cider list?  All you
need to make cider is apple squeezin's and yeast. Right?  Wrong, I guess.
How about some malt, maybe crystal malt. What a great idea!  Every cider 
I've had or made has been *dry*.  Crystal, or maybe cara-pils, may be the 
perfect addition.


Re. unnatenauative yeast:  I've used Pasteur champagne as found it too
attenuative (for cider and for mead).  I've got a mead going now with
Montrechet wine yeast, which is supposed to be less attenuative.  Perhaps
the Mont. yeast would also be good for cider?


And, thanks Jay, for another work diversion.
