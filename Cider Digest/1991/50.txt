Greetings,
        I will apologize in advance for repeating questions in past issues,
but I have started reading the digest at issue #47 and don't know if there are
archives. I am a homebrewer working on my first batch of cider and the
following questions came up.


        1)  How to make a 4-8% EtOH batch of cider that is slightly sweet and
            bottle conditioned/carbonated.
        2)  Can any of the large number of good ale or lager yeasts be used
            instead of champagne yeast.
        3)  How important are: pectin enzyme, acid blend, Ca++ levels, pH in
            general?


        If these questions have been answered before please just let me know
where to get the issues in question and yes I have already ransacked the
library and bugged all the 'experts' I know. BTW I am fermenting this first
batch in a 5 gal. carboy with a blow off tube ala homebrew; please correct me
if that's wrong.


Thanking you in advance,
