Well here we are well into Cider making season and traffic is really light.
How many people on this list have made some cider this year??
Anyone care to post their recipes?? I'll try to go get mine from home and post
them next week. Anyone's tried anything they've made this year??


My 3 Ciders (wasn't there a TV series named that??) are all still fermenting.
The Cranberry and the Raspberry Ciders are still bubbling away quite nicely
with the Epernay Yeast I added. The traditional cider using whatever wild
yeasts were in the cider has also settled in for a nice steady ferment.


I am holding the Ciders with the Epernay Yeast at 68F, while allowing the
Traditional Cider to go with the ambient temperature of my back stairwell,
which typically has been in the 55-60F range.


As soon as one of these seems ready for racking I'll start up my draft style
Cider, though I may get impatient and not wait and do the ferment in a
Cornelius Keg.


Well let's all chime in, that way the beginner's & newcomers will have a source
of recipes to work from.
