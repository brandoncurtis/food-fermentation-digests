Hello all.


With very little hands on experience under my belt in the ways of homebrewing,
I gave cider a go this evening.


I bought 4 gallons of pressed apple juice from a fruit farm in Westford, heated
it up to 190-200F for twenty minutes, and then let it cool in a cold water 
bath in the kitchen sink.


After it cooled, I dumped it in a carboy, threw in a Red Star Champagne 
cultured yeast as well as one cup of pure cane sugar.


I've got yeast nutrient handy should I need it, but otherwise I'm hoping for
a slightly sweet product with a bit of kick.  I'll let you in should
it work (and not say a thing if it goes bad :-)
