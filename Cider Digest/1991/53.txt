Subject: First Batch


    I'm making my first real batch of hard cider (that is, purifying it & then
adding yeast, as opposed to just letting it sit as it comes) and I'd like to
get some advice on a few points-well okay, many points.


    First, what are the opinions regarding the different sterilization options?
There's boiling, steeping, and sulfites. I went the potassium metabisulfite
route for this batch, at about 60 ppm.


    Assuming sulfite sterilization, how long should the cider sit before pitchin
g
the yeast? And what about yeast choice? Adjuncts? Yeast nutrients?


    Then how often should it be racked, and is it necesary to perform any furthe
r
sterilizations, or maybe additives for clarification? Finally, how long should I
wait to bottle the stuff, and should I prime it, a la wort, for a carbonated
product? WHEW!


While you're at it, anything else I should know, like yeast selection, sweet vs.
 dry
product, apple blends, etc?


Thanks in advance. For the time, please repond via e-mail, as I don't (yet) get 
the
cider digest.
