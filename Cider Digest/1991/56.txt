If you want a sparkling cider I strongly recommend that you let the cider
completely ferment and priming just before bottling. Bottling before
the fermentation is complete makes it very difficult to control the sparkle.
If you try to control it by refrigerating the cider then you have potential
bombs on your hands. If the fermentation doesn't stop when you expect it to
or the bottles warm up sometime before they are drunk then they can become
very, very dangerous. They might explode. 


Fermenting completely will likely produce a very dry cider. My solution
has been to make a strong sugar water solution and adding a teaspoon or so
when I pour the cider. You can adjust the sweetness to taste. I've also
found that pouring with some cranberry juice or ginger beer syrup (available
at Carribean food stores) makes a wonderfully refreshing drink. Of course,
there are a number of other cordials you might try depending on what you
like best. Again, adjust quantities to taste.


This year I've added some lactose to my cider before fermenting to try to
get something less brut. It's still bubbling so I'll let you know the results
when it's done.


By the way, I sterilize using campden tablets - three to a five gallon carboy.
I agree with the concern about additives but the sulpher dioxide dissipates
quickly. This seems a better option to me than a potentially infected brew.
