Now I know that just acuse it's never happened doesn't mean it can't but..
Dave sez:

I know many people who also successfully use this technique.
I have been making cider for 4-5 years now, have never sterilized, and have
never had an infected batch. The added yeast has always starved out any
competitors.

Last year I made a batch that had a nice rather champagne-like brut
quality with a hint of apples.  It tasted very much like brut when I
tasted it during bottling.  In fact I was disappointed when it lost
some of its dryness during carbonation, but it gets rave reviews.
It's dangerous stuff on a hot summer day - so refreshing.  ;)  I
used Redstar Pasteur champ. yeast and I primed with 5 C cider.  The
cider itself was the cheapest stuff I had seen - no particular blend,
just drops from an orchard - $1/gal in your own jug.


I've moved since then, so we'll see how this year's batch turns out.

So how about an experiment (though perhaps not in MY basement - maybe
just a thought experiment for now): Stop fermentation with campden
tablets at the desired sweetness.  Then if you want a still cider,
you're done.  If you want it to sparkle, test Jay's belief that the
yeasts already present in the cider are less (or differently)
attenuative and prime with cider but don't add any other yeast.  Like
I said, I'm not ready to volunteer MY basement for this, so I don't
expect you too either. ;)
