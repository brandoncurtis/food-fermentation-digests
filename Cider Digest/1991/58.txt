 Here  is  the info on my first cider.
 The recipe is based on one from Jay Hersh.


                4 gal. cider
                1 # amber dry malt
                2 cups cane sugar
                1 cup brown sugar
                2 pks Red Star champagne yeast


  Boil  1 gallon of water.  Dissolve sugars.  Cool and add to cider.  Pitch
yeast.   Transfer to secondary when fermentation is slow.  Keg with 1/4 cup
corn  sugar  and top off keg with fresh cider.  initial gravity 1.052 final
gravity 1.001


  This stuff is very dry and tart.  It is not clear but has a sight haze to
it which may be attributed to the added cider (would gelatin help this).  I
usually mix it with some fresh cider and zooom!


  A  few nights ago I got to try Woodpecker cider.  Good stuff.  Can anyone
pass  along  a  recipe to get a similar batch.  The draft cider that I made
had  the  same  head behavior as the Woodpecker, the problem is the lack of
the residual sweetness.  This cider bit is great, you can make a nice drink
from  some  really fresh ingredients.  Cider is quite a bit cheaper to make
than  beer,  the draft cider was about $9 per five gallons.  Don't take the
beer from me, but give me more cider.
