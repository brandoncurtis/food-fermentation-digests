Yow Rick, glad you said based on and not copied from!!
No wonder it's dry and tart, 2 pkgs Red Star Champagne Yeast??
My recipe used Ale Yeast along with the extract.


For the record, here is my draft cider recipe from last year
(I'm stuck at home recuperating from some minor surgery, so what better to do
than FINALLY type in the recipes from the recipe book)




TO 1 gallon Water add:


        1lb M&F Light DME (unhopped)
        2 cups Cane Sugar
        1/2 cup Brown Sugar
        Dash of Cinnamon


The sugar amounts are as such since it was all I had in the house (hence the
reason I used the DME) it actualy worked out very well, and I plan to repeat
this recipe with only slight modifications (perhaps cut back a little on the
DME and increase the brown sugar).


Boil the above mixture for about 30 minutes, skim the top if you feel like it.
After boiling take this off the stove, and add about 2 to 2.5 gallons of
chilled fresh Cider. This should drop the temperature to below 90F, if not
chill it to below 90F, then add an Ale Yeast, 7-14 grams of Whitbread or some
other quality Ale Yeast is good.


I let this ferment in the primary for 3-5 days, then rack to a secondary and
let sit another 10-14 before kegging. I artifically carbonmated this one, but a
amounts of priming sugar typical for Ales would work well too.






Cranbery Cider


        3 gallons of Fresh Cider
        12 oz Ocean Srapy Cranberries, chopped in the blender
        1 pkg Red Star Epernay Yeast


Toss all ingredients  into a carbouy at room temperature. Put on an airlock and
go away. Rack after 2-3 weeks and go away again. After another 2-3 weeks bottle
and go away for a few months! Drink in the spring, Yumm!






Raspberry Cider


        3 gallons of Fresh Cider
        4 x 6oz packages Red Raspberries, chopped in the blender
        1 pkg Red Star Epernay Yeast


Toss all ingredients  into a carbouy at room temperature. Put on an airlock and
go away. Rack after 2-3 weeks and go away again. After another 2-3 weeks bottle
and go away for a few months! Drink in the spring, Yumm!






Traditional NE Cider (my variation)


        Toss 3 gallons of a good blend (see my notes on types to blend which are
taken fropm Paul Correnty's AHA Conference talk on Cider) of Cider along with 4
cups of cane sugar into a carbouy. Shake until the sugar dissolves.
Put a blow off hose into the top of the carbouy and let stand at room
temperature. After a few days (or even weeks) the yeast willtake off and things
will start moving in the carbouy and blow off will rise up from the cider.
Be sure to empty the blowoff jar as needed. Eventually things will settle down,
then put an airlock on and take the blow off hose off. Place the carbouy in a
cool dark place (45-55F). 


In the futture:
After 2-3 months you can rack this off to another
carbouy At this point you can rack onto some unpreserved raisins which will 
add yeast nutrients and sugars and kick in a secondary ferment. 
Let this go for a month or two more and then bottle. You can prime at bottling 
time if you want a sprakling cider (use bottles that can handle some pressure
like American Champagne bottles), or unprimed for a still cider.


Well I'll let you know how things proceed.
