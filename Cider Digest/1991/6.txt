Kudos to Ted S for a very informative piece, comments as follows...

They also overpower fruit meads :-(

I have used small amounts (1-2 cups) of brown sugar with no bad effect.
I wonder where the sorghum taste would come from (and what does sorghum taste
like anyway??) I suspect that this may not be "modern info" but perhaps more in
the way of traditional lore. Any comments Ted or anyone else??




I'll try to remember to find my notes from Paul Correnty's cider talk at the
AHA conference (Paul was really enthused to hear I'd created this Digest :-).
I'll dig out my recipe book and post any recorder cider recipes I can find in
it and any notes to go along with them.

Thanks for the advice Dave!  I haven't tossed it, but it is bottled.
I think your absolutley right that aerating will allow the SO2 to
escape.  I first noticed this affect when finishing a half emptied
bottle which had spent a few weeks in the back of my fridge.  Basicly 
I had tried the first part of the bottle but couldn't finish the rest
andI stuck it away until a braver day.  The second half had significantly
better aroma, less sulphur.


My current plan is to taste a bottle every few months to see how it
ages.  (I beleive the flavor should improve due to the honey used).
When pooring I'll heavily aerate and stick the second half away again
to let it air out as before.


Thanks again.

I was reading a source that says the apples used for cider should have no 
bruises on them or else it could make the batch go wrong.


The guys at the Anderson Fruit Farm say that they use exactly those kinds
of apples to make their cider (can't sell the bruised ones I guess). Is
there really a problem with this?


And thanks to Ted Stefanik for that piece he submitted.

 I have been brewing for over 20 years, and wine for the past 10. Being a
member of the Massachusetts Wine Co-op who owns a stemmer crusher, I would
have to say that this device is not suitable for crushing apples.


 If you are speaking of the same device, it is a motorized cylinder into which
you dump the grapes directly from the lugs they come in. It removes the stems
from the grapes and shoots them out of the center of the cylinder into a waste
container, then gently crushes the grapes which fall into a container placed
below the machine. The juice is pressed at a later point, the time being
determined by color, tannin, etc which comes from the skin.

Subject: Champagne Yeast


In my experience, Red Star California Champagne yeast makes a nice slightly
sweet cider.  Red Star Pasteur Champagne Yeast results in a much drier result.
The CC yeast is a bit harder to find, though.

Subject: variants for balance


   At the WBUR-benefit tasting last night I looked at the ingredients of
ciders and talked to one of the people involved. A Vermont brand (very
slightly fizzy) made sweet hard cider by filtering out the yeast from
fully-fermented juice and adding ~10% (my guess from the stated alchohol
content) fresh juice; has anyone tried this? The Strongbow label listed
fermented apple juice and carbonated water among the ingredients; has
anyone tried carbonating a strong finished batch by mixing with plain
seltzer, or by pressurizing a keg? What were the results?

Well,


If any of you are near Sacramento California, your only about a half hour
away from some incredible apples in "APPLE HILL", just outside of Placerville.


There are a number of ranches, with some variety. There are 20-30 large and
small orchards, and all are in a touristy kind of cooperative. Most all sell
apples and cider.


I discussed what I was doing with the owner of one orchard, and she gave me
recipes and advice. She thought it was real neat brewing the stuff. She even
gave me a half gallon of extra cider so I'd have something to drink while
I was brewing!


I'll get my bike out and take a ride up there and see if anyones open yet.
If so, I'll get the map and literature on the area, and find out the varieties.


It's real nice up there, cause a lot of places sell apple sauce and preserves
and pies and all kinds of goodies. It's a neat place to take the family for
a fun fall afternoon!

Help!   Three issues in a row, I have been unable to read the
digests! Our mail system is not 'rn', so the user interface is
different, but I've never had this problem with email from
any other source...  My CS was able to recover the first two,
and I've just told him about the latest, but I really can't
expect manual intervention twice a day, forever! Is there 
*anything* odd about the way you're sending the digests?
(By the way, I've been getting the Homebrew Digest OK for years)
