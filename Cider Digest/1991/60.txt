 sweet, sparkling cider remains a mystery to me.  the preferred method
is kegging and artificial carbonation.  another method is to sweeten,
and pasturize when carbonation is sufficient.  this is dangerous...
exploding bottles are common.


  my idea...  i plan to make a nice sparkling, sweet cyser by
adding a syrup of honey, malto-dextrine and crystal malt.  All three
of these have some unfermentable sweetness.  Walt (bless his soul ;-)
at the homebrew store suggested "Empernay 2" yeast.  (i forgot the
brand)  This yeast is rumored to be rather un-attenuative, and
should leave some sweetness behind.


   I plan to set off 1 gal of this stuff this weekend (11/9).
I will certainly post the results.
