I've been making beer and wine for a couple of years now and I'd like to
try a cider recipe.  I had a similiar experience to Jay's opening intro
to this digest last year.  I put together a 1 gallon batch of cider as a
trial.  I sweetened it a bit with some cane sugar and then added
Champagne yeast.  After two weeks I transfered to a secondary and let it
clear.  The stuff tasted horrible!  Tasted like unblended applejack but
was not quite as high it alcohol (obviously).  I tried mixing some of it
with fresh cider and drinking it but ended up pouring it down the
drain.  I'd really like to make something like Woodpecker.


Anybody got a recipe I could try, I'd like to start out with a 1 gallon
batch.  Having it end up sweet is obviously a problem.  I can only
bottle, not keg.  Anybody ever try bottling, waiting a week, uncapping
and adding sulfites or something to kill the yeast and retain a
sweetness?  With good bottles couldn't you just bottle while there is
still some sugar left and when the CO2 builds up high enough the yeast
will just go dormant kind of like when you make homemade soda?  With
homemade soda there's still alot of sweetness left after the yeast
carbinate it.  It's kind of explosive so you have to treat it nice but
wouldn't that work?


If these approaches have not been tried I'm not willing to experiment
until I have a success under my belt.  Any other recipes which might be
reasonable for me to try?  I'd like something slightly sweet, it does
not necessarilly have to be sparkling.
