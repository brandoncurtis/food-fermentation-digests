Me and my housemate have made about 5 batches of cider using the "add a very
small amount of ale yeast (M&F last year, Red Star this year) to a gallon
(minus 1 glass so that we don't need a blow off tube) of fresh unpasteurized
cider,  and then let it sit for a week.  Last year we actually bottled the
product in beer bottles, I think we'll be lazy and use 1/2 Liter pop bottles
this year (at least so far).  At this point, it got put into the fridge, and
since we usually drink it within a month (depending on how school/research
is going), it usually stays good.  


We are also pretty lazy about transfering the product, and once in a while,
with really sterilizing the new containers.  The end product is usually
carbonated a bit more than woodpecker, and is a bit drier (though it usually
has a better hint of apples, and is still what I would call sweet, most
people who've tried it have also thought it that).  As long as it is drunk
and not aged, it seems to work pretty well.


Plus, by using the plastic jugs that it comes in, you have 1 less container
to clean...

Subject: Sweetening


There's been some discussion on this list recently about how to sweeten the
final cider.  I'd like to toss my $0.02 worth into the ring . . .


I usually make it in 1-gallon jugs by adding some sugar and a started ale
yeast, sticking a fermentation lock in the top, and letting it go.  I like
a moderately dry cider, peronally, but have acheived a sweeter version for
friends who prefer that simply by adding more sugar in the beginning. 
Specifically, for myself I usually use about 1/2 to 3/4 cup (cane sugar)
per gallon, but for a sweeter mix I have used up to 2 cups per gallon,
resulting in something that made my teeth hurt but that some of my friends
greatly preferred to my "normal" batches.


Judging from gravity readings (which I don't have in front of me, so I
can't quote numbers, sorry), I think that the ale yeast shuts down from
alcohol content after processing _about_ 1 cup of sugar per gallon, so
anything past that will remain unfermented and sweeten your end product. 
Of course, YMMV.


It's also worth noting that dissolving 2 cups of sugar in 1 gallon of cider
takes some effort.  If you're going to try this, I'd recommend heating the
cider to help dissolve the sugar.  


On a not-very-related note, I've also had good luck in giving the cider
pleasant cinnamon aromatics by tossing a couple of whole sticks in for the
duration of the ferment.  Very little difference in taste, but it sure
smells nice!  :)
