I also have a 1 gallon batch going.  I used Red Star Champagne yeast, what's
the difference between using Champagne yeast and ale yeast for Cider (I'm 
currently enjoying my first batch of (extract) homebrew, so I'm a novice at
this whole thing).


I've heard that Cider can be primed with corn sugar, cane suger (o.k. for
priming cider but not beer), or even some fresh (i.e., non-alcoholic) cider.
So, what's best, and how much should I use...if I put 3/4 of a cup of corn
sugar in 5 gal of beer, then I should put 3/20th of a cup in 1 gal of Cider???

I've made sparkling cider and cyser (sort of - only a wee bit o honey)
and both times primed with cider.  (I have friends who are allergic to
corn.)  To be safe, I tried to duplicate the levels of carbonation
that would be achieved by 1 C corn sugar, so I weighed a cup, and got
about 5.25 oz.  I estimated that one gal of the cider I had contained
about 18 oz sugar (assuming all the excess gravity in the 1.045 cider
was sugar) and so I used 5 C cider / 5 gal batch.  [NB: these numbers
are from memory, so apply an adequately large grain of salt.  They may
not be too far off though - I've been reviewing my records in prep for
bottling this year's.]


The level of carbonation seemed a bit low, and certainly my brut cider
lacks the body to hold it, so I didn't get the desired effect of
slightly undercarbonated champagne.  (I was really disappointed since
it DID have that character at bottling time.)  That doesn't stop me
from enjoying it though :) and the straight cider is rated highly
dangerous in hot weather by my friends.  It seems so light and
refreshing...it just tastes like more.


I don't think I'll boost the priming much until I get champagne
bottles, though.


Enough rattling.  Now a question:  how do you folks bottle/store still
cider?  crown caps?  corks?  I'm thinking of some "traditional" cider
and haven't decided on still or sparkling (and probably won't until I
taste it).
