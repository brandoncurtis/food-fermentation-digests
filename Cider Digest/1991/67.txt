Subject: Epernay yeast, sodium benzoate


Aaron writes:"Empernay 2" yeast.  (i forgot the
        brand)  This yeast is rumored to be rather un-attenuative, and
        should leave some sweetness behind.


The yeast is Red Star Epernay II and normally works as mentioned (FG ~1.012).


This year, my apples set little fruit, so I was forced to $buy$ cider from a roa
dside stand. I started some raspberry cider:


        2 gal apple cider SG 1.060
        16 oz crushed raspberries in water to make 1 qt. 
        6 oz corn sugar added to raspberries to bring SG to 1.060
        1 packet Red Star Epernay II yeast started in 8 oz of SG 1.100
                                           corn sugar/ water


I failed to notice that the cider "contains .1% benzoate of soda to preserve fre
shness". Fermentation started, then stalled at SG 1.055 after 5 days. My questio
n is: how do I overcome the preservative?

Subject:  Priming Cider


I'm just a beginner myself, but my first batch of sparkling cider worked out
well.  My response to the two questions:  Ale yeast v. Champagne yeast-Ale
yeast can only tolerate around 12% alcohol, and this corresponds to around
1 cup added corn or cane sugar to one gallon of cider.  So, if you add more
than one cup/gallon, the cider will be sweet.  Champagne dies around 18%.
If the yeast dies before you prime, it won't sparkle, but it will be sweeter.
I like to target my cider around 12% so it will be slightly sweet, but still
sparkling.  As for priming rate 3/20 cup/gallon is right on, same as beer.
Here's a tip:  Use cane sugar for all your added sugar, since, as all you
beer makers know, cane sugar adds a cidery taste to your beer and will do the
same thing to cider.
Good luck with it!
