Hi, 
 I tried the recipe that Jay posted a bit ago. Basically
 it was 1 gal water boiled for 30 -40 minutes with 1 lb
 malt, 2 cups cane sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I added
 this to 3 1/2 gal. cider purchased from local orchards.
 I cooled it down to somewhere around 70F and pitched 14
 grams of whitbread ale yeast. I did not proof or start
 the yeast. This is all in a 7 Gal glass carboy. The
 original gravity was about 1.05. It was put in an area
 that stays about 65F to ferment.


 After 12 hours it was bubbling throught the airlock at 
 a rate of 2 per minute. After 24 hours it was more like
 6 per minute and there was a cake starting to build on
 the surface. By this morning 36 hours all signs of 
 fermentation has ceased and the cake was gone off of the
 surface. This does not seem right. I have placed a 
 heating strap around the carboy. This will take it up
 to more like 75F by later in the day. 


 Any suggestions if this is a normal ferment or what I
 might do to restart things?


 Thanks,
