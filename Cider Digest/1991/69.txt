Subject: Bubbling away. . .


That batch of cider I started up a few weeks ago is still going.  Essentially,
I put 4 gallons of cider in a carboy with one cup of cane sugar and a pack
of Red Star champagne yeast.  


It's got a good color and after three weeks, it is putting out a bubble every
minute and a half (or so).


I was thinking of throwing in another cup (or more) of cane sugar and some
yeast nutrient - any ideas on that are welcome.


Also, I was going to put the cider in a secondary when it stopped, but this
secondary has, as I recently discovered, a rust spot on the bottom.  It's a
sixty-year old glass carboy my grandfather gave me and after soaking the
inside for a few days in bleach, the rust spot became visible where there once
was dirt.


I've since decided not to rack to a secondary (I don't have anything else 
except a priming bucket) unless anyone feels this rust spot won't make a 
bit of difference.
