"Sweet & Hard Cider" says "The apples must be washed before milling to remove
leaves, twigs, harmful bacteria, insects, and any spray residues.  Any rotten
or moldy fruits must be thrown out, and brown spots should be cut out of
otherwise sound apples."


"Wines & Beers of Old New England" says "It is worth nothing in passing that
worm-free apples are essential for pies and applesauce, but for cider the
worms make no difference if you are using a hand press.  A hand press does
not put enough pressure on the apples to squash the worms and the pomace
acts as a filter."
