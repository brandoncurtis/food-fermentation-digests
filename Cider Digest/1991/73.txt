I think all of my posts are suffering from "subject and subject" disease 
in the subject line :-)


I went to Grossman's and bought a jug of Muriatic Acid (or some such spelling)
and, amazingly enough, didn't get any on myself or my clothing.  I filled
the bottom of my old carboy with it and within the space of an hour, Mr.
Rust spot had vanished.


BTW - someone told me to get that acid. It's a diluted (though still strong)
HCl.


As for the cider, I took a taste test.  No bacterial infection, and the first
thing that came to mind was the time I was in Portugal and bought five liters
of wine (in one of those plastic wicker jugs) for a dollar and drank it on 
the beach with four travelling companions.  


In other words: dry and strong.  But it did have a residual apple aftertaste.


What I've done now is added a gallon of water with four cups of cane sugar. I
boiled and cooled it before I threw it in.  Within 24 hours, the yeast was
reactivated and going at it - this following four days of inactivity before
I added the sugar-water.


So we'll see.  Maybe it'll be worth drinking so long as it doesn't bring
me back to Portugal and make me climb a mud cliff in the rain at night. . .
