Well folks I went and bottled the Raspberry Cider, and the Cranberry Cider
(the ones made with the Red Star Epernay Yeast). I had a hard time getting 
a gravity reading. I only made 3 gallons, so there wasn't enough depth in the
bottlin gbucket to get a reading there, and my hydrometer always seems to 
want to stick to the side of the test jar. It did appear that the gravity was
below 1.010.


Each of the Ciders still had a fair amount of residual sweetness and a nice
fruity flavor. The Cranberry as could be expected was a bit more tart than the 
Raspberry. I will probably drink some at Thanksgiving, but will stick the 
rest down in the basement to age a while.


I'll keep you posted on these and the Tradiitional Cider. I will probably put up
the draft Cider now that I have free carbouys again :-)!!


All in all though I would say the Epernay worked well and seems to be a good
alternate to the Pasteur Champagne in that it apparently ferments to a less dry
product (though sugars from the fruits may also have helped yield a higher post
ferment sweetness).

I bottled my 1st batch of cider last friday nite.  My recipe was: buy a gallon
of "natural" cider (unfiltered with no preservatives), open it, take a taste,
add a packet of Red Star Champagne yeast, and insert fermentation lock.


Well, at bottling time the specific gravity was ~1.000 (no suprise), but I
kinda hoped/expected it to clear.  It didn't taste like Woodpecker (the only
reference that my tastebuds can recall), but it was definitely drinkable (IMHO).
I bottled it with 2 Tablespoons of cane sugar, and ended up with 9 bottles of
cider.


So,


 - how long should I let it set in bottles (beer is drinkable in ~2 weeks)?


 - should it clear, or is "cloudy" cider acceptable/expected?


 - in my next attempt with a similar 1 gal of natural cider, if I use ale yeast
  (Red Star?? -- do they make ale yeast??) and add some sugar to end up with
  some residual sugar, should I use brown sugar, (white) cane sugar, or ??,
  and how much sugar should I add??


All comments &/or suggestions are greatly appreciated,
