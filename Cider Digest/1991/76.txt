I've made a couple of batches with Red Star Champagne yeast.  A small batch
that I made with pasteurized cider and bottled back in early September has
still not cleared; I don't hold much promise for it doing so any time soon.


My Christmas cider, on the other hand, cleared almost completely within eight
weeks of inoculation (five weeks primary fermentation followed by three weeks
in secondary).  It's been in the bottle for three weeks now, and what little
sediment there was in the bottle I attribute to pilot error (not being as
careful not to agitate the lees as I should have been).  This batch was made
using unpasteurized cider.  Again, storage in a cool place has accelerated
the clearing.
