I don't know about Berkeley, or even Alameda and/or Contra Costa counties.
The best answer is to go on up to Sonoma. Around Sebastopol are lots and lots
of apple orchards, and many of them have farm stands that sell apples,
fresh pies, and cider.


Once you're up there, you can get a free copy of the "Sonoma County Farm Trails"
map from just about any place that a tourist is likely to stop. This
publication lists all sorts of agricultural points of interest, and
includes quite a few orchards. Many of them are still open on weekends.


It's about a 45-minute drive from Berkeley through beautiful country.
There are also literally dozens of fine wineries in the area (pity).
And finally, Great Fermentations in Santa Rosa is a very highly
regarded brewers' supply store. This is a great way to spend a Saturday.


Belatedly answering the call for results:


My wife and I were up in Sonoma a couple of weeks ago on a wine-tasting
expedition, and while we were there we stopped at Hallenbeck's Orchard
(Gravenstein Highway, Sebastopol) and secured six gallons of fresh raw cider.


We immediately drank one gallon, gave another away, and sterilized the
rest with 2 campden tablets.  Three days later we pitched Wyeast Irish
Ale (1084) and fermented at 50 F.  It has been working *very* slowly,
but a test glass two days ago showed it to be still sweet, with a light
carbonation and a touch of alcohol.  No gravity readings, but it's
quite drinkable straight from the primary.  We might just rack it once
to let it settle for a day, then drink it down!


I'll repost in a couple of weeks with the "final results." I think I might
set aside a couple of gallons and play with them: add some DME or spices
or whatever.


Salud'!

I live in Berkeley and got my last batch of fresh unfiltered juice 
from Auburn :)


Places I'd try would be Berkeley Bowl, Monterey market, Live Foods (I think)on
University or Andronicos.


Has any one tried using Frozen apple juice?
