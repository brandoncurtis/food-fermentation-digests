  Jay mentioned a cranberry cider.  I have a very similar recipe
fermenting now.  But it is VERY slow.  


  I borrowed my mom's vegetable juicer to juice the cranberries.
I made a cranberry melomel from 42 oz cranberries and 3 lb honey
for a 1 gal batch.  i used about 1/4 tsp nutrient since i figured
the cranberries would provide nutrient.  This batch is stuck
after about 3 days of very slow fermentation.  I used red-star
empernay 2 yeast in both the cranbery melomel and cranbery cyser.


  oh...  the cyser was about 2/3 gal juice, juice from 18 oz
cranberries, and about 1.3 lbs honey.  no nutrient.  used
the other half of the rd-star empernay 2 yeast.


  why won't my cranberries ferment?  one person noted that
cranberries tend to "keep" rather well.  do they contain a 
natural anti-fungal agent?  did ocean spray use a preservative
that i missed on the label?


  oh**2...  i tested the pH of the stuck melomel... it was 3.5.
is this low enough to harm empernay 2 yeast?


   thnaks for any ideas...
