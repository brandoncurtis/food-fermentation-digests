Hmmm. I wouldn't say my Cranberry Cider fermented really fast. Actually 
I thought it went sort of slow, but there was steady activity, and it did 
finish. I used the Epernay from Red Star. I wouldn't worry too much.


How much yeast did you add, and did you aerate the mixture (must ??)
before pitching? If not you may just have a smaller colony size, but as long as 
it is healthy it will keep fermenting.


You could try starting another pack of yeast in warm water, then add it to 
a small amount of unpreserved cider or corn sugar (I'd recommend cider though).
When it appears active, toss it in with the slow ferment. This should give it a
kick.

Help!  I'm trying to Relax and all, but I've got some serious concerns
about my first batch of cider.  I attempted to make a sparkling cider
with a recipe I got from the Cat's Meow.


This is the recipe I used:


5 gallons       Fresh Cider 
3 pounds        Light Brown Sugar
3 pounds        Honey
2 packages      Pasteur Champagne Dry Yeast
                (Red Star)


After eleven days, I racked it to a glass carboy.  13 days later I racked
it again, and bottled 10 days after that.  It was primed with 1/2 gallon
of fresh cider and 1/2 pound of honey.  The final gravity was 0.993 (no
O.G available).


After about 3 weeks in the bottle, there is no sign of carbonation.  Is this 
a problem?  As I said, this is my first attempt at cider, how long should
one expect to wait for carbonation to develop?  If there is a problem, is
it correctable?  Is opening each bottle and re-priming a viable solution?


Any advice would be welcome, and probably help me to relax.  :-)
