Greetings:


This is my first post to the cider digest, and since I've not read any of
these digests yet, I'll assume that the format is similar to the HBD.  I
want to ask a question that I posed to the HBD last week, so my apologies
to those who've read it previously.  I was disappointed in the less than
overwhelming response there, and so would like to ask some questions about
apple mead, cyser, to those more in tune with apple fermentations. 


I want to make a cyser, that is, a mead with with some apple cider.
Although I've never made any kind of mead before, I've looked through all
my books and through the Cat's Meow to learn about the secrets of mead
making.  (Actually, I've been saving posts regarding meads for quite a
while, now.;-)  Unfortunately, I found only 1 recipe for cyser.  Maybe I
should break down and get a book on mead.  So I want to ask a few questions
of anyone with experience making a cyser. (Get ready for a long series of
questions.) 


1.  Is apple juice as good as apple cider for a cyser?  It seems like apple 
cider is kind of hard to find around here.  Could I use fresh apples?  How, 
what kind, how much?


By apple juice, I mean a clear liquid apple product, presumably packaged with 
some kind of preservative.  I include frozen concentrate in this classification.


Here, by cider, I'm referring to a product I fondly recall from my childhood 
in New Jersey.  This stuff is not so clear, it seems to have some small pieces 
floating in it, and fermentation is usually perceived (by taste) before 
a gallon is fully consumed.  As I recall, it was only available in October 
and November.  I just can't find this stuff anywhere in Utah.


2.  Is a sweet mead, with more than 3 # honey per gallon, most appropriate? 
If not, what is the <optimal> amount of honey per gallon?


3.  What spices/herbs blend well in a cyser?  Cinnamon, ginger, tea, hops, 
orange peel?


4.  Does an ale yeast work well?  Suggestions?


5.  Are acid blend and yeast nutrient necessary ingredients?


Obviously, I'm asking oodles of questions, but I want my first dabble into 
the ancient art of mead making to be a success.  I feel inspired by the two 
guys listed in the most recent Zymurgy, who won the "Mead Maker of the 
year" award, (or some such title,) based on their first attempt at a mead!!!


Thanks for all your help,


Chuck

Subject: How to clear 




I am on my first batch of sparkling cider and am using unfiltered apple juice.
The murky brown liquid is fermenting away with a lot of yeast sediment.
Does anyone have some advice on how to clear it? Gelatin? Polyclar ?
