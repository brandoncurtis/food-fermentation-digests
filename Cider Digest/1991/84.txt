Here are a few more data points.


I made four gallon test batches of hard cider this fall.  I made four
because that's the amount my brother gave me (for free).  The apples
were nothing special - ("mostly red, and not too wormy" my brother told me
when I asked what kind they were) the cider was slightly sweet and
unfiltered before I started.  Each batch was pasturized for 1/2 hour @
170F before pitching.  I used Whitbread Ale yeast for all four batches,
repitching over the yeast from the previous batch.


1 - Straight cider.  No added sugar.  IG - 1.040.  TG - 0.998.  Fermentation
took about 2 1/2 weeks.  A lot of the proteins settled out and this cleared
nicely (as did all the batches).  The taste is very tart, not sour.  It's
like (is) a very dry apple wine, almost Champagne.  It's kind of rough right
now, but may mellow.


2 - 1 gallon cider, zest and juice (1/2 cup) from two oranges.  1 cup cane
sugar.  IG - 1.052.  TG - broken hydrometer.  Fermentation took about 3 weeks.
The taste is almost as sweet as the original juice, but the orange imparts
a slight "metallic" taste.  Okay taste, but not great.


3 - 1 gallon cider, 1 pound clover honey, 1 cup cane sugar.  No gravity
readings.  Fermentation only took 2 weeks.  The taste is not as sweet as the
original cider.  It is like a dry apple wine.  This would probably be better
with aging.


4 - 1 gallon cider, 1 pound clover honey, zest and juice (3/4 cup) from two
oranges, and 1 1/4 cup cane sugar.  No IG.  TG - 1.038.  Fermentation took
3 weeks.  The taste is complex.  It is possible to taste elements of the
honey, apple, and orange in progression.  None dominates, so I can't really say
if it is sweet or sour.  So far, it is everyone's favorite.  Guess I'll make a
bigger batch next year.

I've not made cyser or cider (yet), but have made many batches of mead.
I find tea to be a very useful addition to mead, both for the tannin and the
acid, but it might not be as useful in cyser---particularly not if you use
a tart apple juice.  (Good luck finding a tart apple juice unless you
press your own!)  My temptation for a cider would be to add no spices--you can
always spice after brewing if the flavor is weak.


For meads, I've had the best results going for a strong dessert wine (5lbs
honey/gallon water) using a white wine yeast.  It takes a lot longer than
a weaker mead using an ale yeast, but the results are worth it to me.
[Caveat: I prefer port to beer---people with other tastes might prefer to
make a 2 lb/gallon mead with ale yeast.]
