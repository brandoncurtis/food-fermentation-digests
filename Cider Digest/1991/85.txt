Subject: Re:  Sodium Benzoate vs. yeast


I submitted a request for help on starting some raspberry cider involving cider 
that had been *preserved* with .1% benzoate of soda. The first and second attemp
ts used Red Star Epernay II, a yeast that had been very good with raw cider. Not
hing: no bubbles and the SG sat at 1.058 for three weeks.


The folks at Steinbarts, the local homebrew shop here in Portland, said "just ke
ep pitchin". Well, about 2 weeks ago, I threw in some Telford ale yeast and now 
fermentation has (slowly) begun, dropping about .008 per week.


I'll let you know where fermentation stops - I hope in the mid-teens, so we don'
t get too dry. (Hard to get too dry around here :-)
