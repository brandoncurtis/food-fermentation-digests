Subject: My cyser recipe


Thanks to everyone who responded to my query regarding a cyser recipe.  I
received many more responses from my post here, in the cider digest, than I
got from the same post in the HBD.  I found this kinda' surprising, since I
assume the HBD is a superset of this forum.  Make what you will of that. 


Anyway, let me give a brief summary of the responses I got.  Mead makers sure
are an eclectic crowd; they don't agree a whole lot on recipe formulation. 


Nearly everyone straightened me out about using an apple juice with no
preservatives.  To press my own apple juice might be a little too much,
especially since I don't own any of the necessary equipment. 


I asked about optimal rates of honey addition, and got answers ranging from 1
#/gallon to more than 5#/ gallon. 


Best spices?  Everyone has his favorite. 


Yeast?  Either ale, champagne, or epernay yeast are preferred! 


Acid blend and/or yeast nutrients?  Yes, maybe, depends on personal
preference, or no.  Depends who you talk to. 


Thanks to everyone, my recipe formulation was clear.  As mud.  ;-) Here's what
I'm going to do: 


For two gallons, 
7 lb honey 
1.5 gallon pasteurized apple juice (w/o preservatives) 
~1/2 gal water 
2 tsp. yeast nutrient 
3 sticks of cinnamon,
chooped up 
3 whole nutmeg, chopped up 
Champagne yeast 


Boil Honey and H2O for 10 minutes, skim off scum if possible.  Heat off. Add
spices and yeast nutrient.  Sit for 20 minutes. Add to apple juice. Cool. 
Pitch rehydrated yeast.  Agitate like hell (for aeration). 


I think I'll do the initial fermentation in a 5 gallon carboy, and after a few
weeks, transfer to 2 1-gallon cider bottles for the duration of the
fermentation.  This way, I'll have my carboy free for brewing (beer).  I
anticipate temperature being a small problem.  My apartment is quite cool
during the winter, around 60F, and apparently, meads like to ferment at warmer
temps.  Oh hell.  I just hope that the yeast will make it.  Geez, I should be
brewing beer, now that my apartment is at lagering temps, instead of in the
summer, when it's around 75-80F.  I'm always getting this stuff backwards. 


Cheers, 
Chuck

Subject: white spots


Hi,
 On 11/16/91 I started a batch of hard cider. I boiled some
 malt, brown sugar and white sugar with water, cooled and
 added to cider and pitched some yeast.


 By 11/25 it had stopped bubbling and I racked it to a 5
 gallon carboy. There was only about 4 gallons of cider so
 there was a substantial gap between the surface of the cider
 and the stopper in the carboy. I let this sit while I
 foolishly drove to Minnesota over Thanksgiving and watched
 it snow. 


 Yesterday I decided I should get around to bottling it and
 went to take a look at it. It is by the way in a dark closet
 at 64 degrees F give or take a couple degrees.


 On the surface of the cider are a number (15 or 20 I suppose)
 little white spots. They are a very pure white and not very
 large. The largest would be smaller then a dime.


 The question is what is it and is it harmfull and how do I
 avoid it in the future. I did not add any campden tables to
 the cider before I started this time. The next question 
 is is it fixable. Perhaps boiling the cider before I bottle,
 recognizing of course that this would mean a still cider.


 I would appreciate any insights you folks might have.


 Thanks,
