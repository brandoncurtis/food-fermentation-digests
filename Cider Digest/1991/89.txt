Are you saying it doesn't seem like cider vinegar?  I know cider
vinegar is pretty cheap, but if you have any use for it, why not save
some?

Subject: Sparkling sweet cider??


Well,


I'm about to try my second 1 gal batch of cider, and would like to end up with
some residual sweetness AND still have it carbonated.  I know this has been
discussed, but I'm confused...


If I add a couple cups of sugar/honey and use an ale yeast, the yeast will 
choke and die when the alcohol level reaches some limit (~8% ??).  I could
bottle that and have a sweet, still cider.  But if I want it carbonated,
I would have to add yeast that would withstand the high alcohol (champagne
yeast), but if I bottle that the yeasties would "go to town" on the residual
sugar, and I would have grenades.


Isn't there an easy way to get a sweet sparkling cider???

Subject: Cider Kits


Dan Roman mentioned a "cider kit" from Ironmaster.  I have no experience
with that particular one but Wine-Art, in Canada, produces a concentrate
based cider kit that I have used twice.  They seem to target it at their
winemaking, rather than beermaking, customers.  The kit includes ~2 litres
of apple concentrate, a package of winemaking chemicals and a packet of
champagne yeast.


For my first attempt with this kit I followed their instructions with the
exception of substituting an ale yeast.  I diluted the concentrate to 23
litres, added enough corn sugar to take the OG to ~1.050, tossed in the
chemicals (with some reservations :-) and pitched the yeast.  Unfortunately,
this batched developed an infection after about 1 week in the primary and had
to be dumped.


The second batch worked much better.  I decided to treat the process
as though I was making beer - almost.  I diluted the concentrate to ~8
litres, added the corn sugar and heated it to ~70C to sanitise.  After
cooling I pitched a starter of M&F ale yeast.  I did this batch as a
single stag fermentation with a blow-off tube for the first couple of
days.  Everything went fine, although the fermenation lasted 5 weeks.
The final gravity was ~0.998.  Primed with 1.25 cups corn sugar and
bottled in 0.5 litre bottles, the cider cleared crystal clear and
light golden in colour after a few weeks.  It is very dry, definitely
sparkling and quite high in alcohol, a pretty far cry from the English
draft cider that I was shooting for.  Nonetheless, we are still
enjoying the tail end of this batch some 6 months after bottling.


My first attempt at cider from freshly pressed juice was bottled last
week.  That batch was sweetened a little with pale DME.  Perhaps when
it has had a chance to age and clear I'll post a comparison of the
two.
