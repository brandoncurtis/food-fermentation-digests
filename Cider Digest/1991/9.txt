Howdy ciderheads!


Quite astonished how many of us are out there; this list seems to be really
taking off.  Definitely a good idea to have made it a digest.


I wanted to tell you all about my last (and second) batch of cider, which I
made in June.  Now, I want you to understand that I have the highest respect
for the sophisticated discussion of specific gravities and fermentation
temperatures and yeast DNA-subtypes that tend to occur in HBD and probably
here too--I hope to one day understand all that stuff.  However, I have a
tale to tell of foolish daring and unexpected success.


I decided about two weeks before I took the biggest exam of my life last
June that I'd like to make some kind of alcoholic thing to contribute to
celebrations with my classmates.  So I threw caution and good taste to the
winds and bought a 1-gallon jug of Grand Union brand "apple juice" (just wait,
it gets worse) and <gasp> a packet of standard bread yeast at my local market.
The apple juice, by the way, was full of sodium benzoate, but did the yeast
and I care?  Hell no!  I opened the jug, poured off about a cup, poured in
a vague but large amount of white and brown sugar (at least 2 cups of each),
threw in the yeast, and popped on a blow-by.  It bubbled happily for about
ten days, then stopped.  I tasted it and it was yeast and dry as a bone.
I filtered it about a zillion times (the only painstaking thing in the whole
process, I wanted to get that yeast taste out), and then filled the jug with
fresh apple juice to sweeten it.


Well, what I ended up with was plenty strong and really tasty!  My friends
loved it, the jug was passed and emptied in half an hour.  I'll always use
fresh, unadulterated cider when I can, and I guess champagne yeast is probably
better, and I know I should sterilize equipment and record SGs and all that,
but it's nice to know that the process works even with the worst of materials.
It's almost as if whoever's in charge of the universe wants cider to be made,
ay?  The cards are stacked in our favor.


peace,
