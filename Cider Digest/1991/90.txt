Dave,
 It was vinegary in that it was sour. There were also some flavors
 that were almost metalic it quality. The smell was not exactly
 like vinegar but that is as close a description as I could come up
 with.


 I did in fact toss it. Two reasons really, one I do not in general
 trust off flavored food or drink and two frustration. I am able to
 make consistly good beers so I believe that my sanitation
 procedures are fine and so forth, but I have not been able to come
 up with a cider that I like or that turns out.


 I guess I will try again later. What irks me is that I do not have
 any real understanding of what went wrong with my procedures. When
 I started making beer I tossed some batches also but I was able to
 identify and thus correct whatever caused the problem. No doubt I
 will think about it and try another batch at some point.


 Thanks for the suggestions.

ps. I tried to send this directly to bashful.lcs.mit.edu but my 
    mailer responded with a host unknown and I could not find the
    machine with nslookup.
