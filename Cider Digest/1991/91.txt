Sorry, I haven't been following this discussion but I'll throw in a comment
anyway. Some months ago there was a discussion about sanitation and
sterilization. I sterilize my cider with campden tablets and have yet
to have an off batch. Jay countered that he never sterilizes his cider
and has never had an off batch either. Great, do whatever works for you.


Now, like I say, I haven't been following this so don't know if you sterilized
your cider. If you didn't then perhaps this is a case where the wild beasties
got you. Since you make beer successfully then your problem most likely isn't
with your equipment. Next time try sterilizing your cider with campden tablets
and see if you have any better luck. And don't give up.
