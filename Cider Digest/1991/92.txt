Here is a wonderful, seasonal drink:




               Mulled Cider


        1 Gallon Sweet Apple Cider
        1/2 Cup  Brown Sugar
        2 or 3 Sticks Cinnamon
        1 tsp  whole cloves
        1 tsp  whole allspice


Pour cider into dutch oven or some large pot.  Add brown sugar and spices
(I use a hop bag for the spices).  Cover and heat to boil.  Reduce heat and
let simmer for about an hour.  Remove spices.  Consume.  


This is a nice warmer when comming in from the cold.  We make up two gallon
batches and keep it in the fridge and reheat via the microwave.  Tasty stuff...
