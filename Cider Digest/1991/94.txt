   This can also be done with hard cider.  I made a cider using
nothing but apple juice and chanpagne yeast.  I stabilized,
then added a tea of honey, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.


  I added the boiled (sterilized) tea to the cider at bottling.
The stuff came out crystal clear and absolutely delicious,
(although the alchahol level was a bit low.  next time I will
add honey or cane sugar to the base cider)


  It tastes GREAT cold, but simehow it looses its charm hot.
I think the tastebuds need an attach of cold to numb them a bit
for all that spice.  I will also cut spice amounts in the future.

Here is my recipe for holiday cider:


        5 Gal. Apple Juice (Gravenstein/Jonathan blend)
        6 c.   Maple Syrup
        7/3 T. Whole Cloves
        1/2    Whole nutmeg, grated
        10     4" cinnamon sticks
        3      lemons (juice and zest)
        2"     ginger root, peeled and grated
        1      pkg. Red Star Champagne Yeast


        Simmer 3/4 gal. apple juice, spices and ginger (in spice bags), syrup,
        and lemon juice and zest for 45 mins.  Add simmered mix to 4 1/4 gal.
        cider in carboy.  Pitch yeast and top off with more apple juice.


         9/15/91       Initial SG = 1.100.
        10/19/91       Racked. SG = 0.998.  Topped off with more apple juice.
        11/10/91       Racked. SG = 1.002.  Added 3/4 c. corn sugar, and
                      bottled.
        12/14/91       Public debut.  Good sparkle, mildly yeasty (not careful
                      enough with my secondary racking), complex flavor,
                      some spice in the nose, too much alcohol (my calcs say
                      that the alcohol content is about 15%, but it tastes
                      much stronger).


In general, I'm pretty pleased; almost everybody who's tried it has been pleased
as well.  It'll be interesting to see how my "Twelfth Night" batch (same basic
recipe but substituting 3# Mesquite honey for the maple syrup and montrachet
yeast for the champagne yeast, and adding the juice and zest from three oranges
to those from the lemons) turns out; the initial SG of that batch was 1.065,
so the alcohol will (hopefully) not mask overwhelm the palate.


Cheers,
