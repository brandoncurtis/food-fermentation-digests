I added gelatin and it cleared to something that looks a hospital sample.
Thanks to all who send suggestions.
I used epernay yeast and the cider tasted drier than I expected.
One half is primed with sugar and the other with sugar, hibiscis tea, spices,
and honey.They are now aging in the basement.
The other experiment with raspberry and apple juice went awry and had to be
tossed out. The raspberry sediment got moldy and the whole thing smelled
bad after the 4th week.(was ok before)
I will post how they turned out in a couple weeks.
