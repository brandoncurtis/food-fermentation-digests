Hmmm... 


It's been way too quiet out there.
Surely some of you must have bottled and/or tasted your ciders lately.


Paul Correnty, cider guru, was over at my house the other day. He had 
one look at the clarity of my NE Traditional Cider (ferment with wild yeast)
and said "Bottle it!!", so I did just that last night. It tasted great.
I had kept about a quart of the same cider out in the freezer. 
I defrosted it a few weeks ago intedning to drink it, but I didn't 
and it began to ferment slowly, so I used it as a primer, figuring if it
didn't prime it would still probably clear OK  the way the cider I added
it to had done. So I'll either get a still or a sparkling NE Cider 
depending on how the priming works out.




I haven't tasted either of the fruit ciders I bottled early lately.


I just got a new book on Cider. I can't recall the authors, but it had a 
bright red border on the cover around a picture of some folks loading up an
apple press. It looked pretty good with plenty of info on apple varieties
cider making, cooking with cider, distilling, etc... I hope to get a chance
to read it real soon.
