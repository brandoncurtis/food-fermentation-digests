I haven't had much luck either, but then I didn't pasturize or did anything
to the apple juice other than pitching the yeast.
 It looked and smelled and carbonated the way it should,
 but has some strange taste to it, it was probably infected. I left the bottles
sitting in the basement. The bad taste may go away, or it may not, It will keep
the inside of those bottles out of dust until I brew again.
 I will probably try making cider again when I have more time.
