Subject: My cyser results




   I recently bottled a cranberry cyser.  I used about 3/4 gal health-food
store cider (pasturized, i think), 1 lb. crushed cranberries, and
about 2c honey.  I boiled the honey with some water for about
40 min, skimming scum.  Then i added the cranberry mush abd allowed
to cool (thus patsuerizing the cranberries).  Pitched red-star
empernay 2 yeast.


  After about 3 months, the stuff cleared & stopped fermenting.
I tasted it...  dry.  Has anybody else got dry results with
empernay 2???  perhaps it was a wild yeast.  It looked like
a blush or rose wine.  tasted like that too, but a bit drier,
and more tart.  So, i added 1c honey, boiled, to sweeten.
After 1 more month, the honey haze is falling out, and
it tastes quite nice.  Must people would mistake it for a rose wine.


  oh... i forgot to mention.  Before sweetening i stabilized it with
sodium benzoate (sp?) for about 1 week, THEN sweetened.


  All of my ferments have been VERY slow.  I have 5 more gallons
of cider, 4 months old, and they are STILL fermenting.  dang.


  I'll post my results as they come through.


  For my next cider, i will attempt a sparkling sweet cider
by adding at least 2c/gallon cane sugar adn using empermay 2
or an ale yeast (of low attenuation).
