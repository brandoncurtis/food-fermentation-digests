Subject: the cider that I made...


Hi there:
    I made an excellent cider from a, gasp, cider kit!  I bought it at
    boots when I was over in England for my summer vacation.  It took
    about a month to a month and a half to fermenent in a carboy, and
    then after bottling, about 2 months to carbonate.  The finished
    product was clear, sparkling, dry and delicious.  Much the same
    as strongbow cider, and such.  Sadly, I haven't been able to find
    a suitable kit to make cider from around here (Newfoundland, Canada),
    and I am not really sure that cider can be made from apple juice 
    (from a box)...


    Any ideas on making cider, when one does not have access to a
    apple grove, or unpasturized apple juice.  BTW, I think the apple
    juice from the boxes are heat pasturized, and not chemically
    pasturized.
