Well, my first batch is fermenting merrily away right now.  I didn't do
anything exotic - just a gallon of unfiltered, unpasteurized, un-anything
apple cider with an ounce of a powdered wine yeast that I got from Great
Fermentations of Santa Rosa.  (I don't remember what variety the yeast was.)
Is this likely to turn out all right?  Will the cloudiness of the apple juice
settle out, or will it remain murky?


Also, the ciders I've had in the past (Taunton Blackthorn, in particular) have
been too sweet for my liking.  Does anyone have recipes for a somewhat tart
hard cider?


Relaxing, not worrying, but having to settle for a homebrewed beer,  :-)

Help!  I need apples, more specifically apple trees.  Can someone tell me
where I might be able to get English tree varieties mail order?  I have
a number of garden companies in the area selling the same old two or three
varieties that everyone else has.  No Cox's anywhere.
