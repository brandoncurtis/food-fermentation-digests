Subject: adding lactose




Hopefully this isn't a stupid question, but is there anything wrong with 
adding some lactose to a batch of cider to increase the residual sweetness?


There has been some discussion in this digest about adding various sugars
(honey, molasses, etc) to increase the sugar, and using a less attenuative
yeast, or trying to stop the yeast, but wouldn't it be easier to just add
some unfermentable sugar such as lactose??  Several of the sweet stout
recipies in the Cat's Meow 2 (Mackeson clones) call for 4 to 12 oz. of 
lactose for a 5 gal batch of beer.


Has anyone tried this??  It may not be correct for an "authentic" cider
(whatever that means), but my only concern is would it have any undesireable
side-effects such as adding an "off-flavor"?


I've got a gallon of natural/organic apple cider, a packet of M&F 
ale yeast, and a pound of lactose...I think that I'll throw in the yeast
and a couple ounces of lactose and see what happens....
