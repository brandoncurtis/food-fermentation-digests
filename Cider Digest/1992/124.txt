Subject: special batch of cider


   What were people's experiences with the batch of cider especially
pressed for hardening last Fall? I ran two half-batches, one with
Whitbread ale yeast and one with natural yeasts; both of them were
fortified to OG 1.07 (mix of brown and white sugars) and ended at
.996!---very thin, alcohol dominating assortment of weak flavors (some
not very pleasant). Does this sound like an infection? How long did other
people let their ciders go and do you have any intermediate data points
(SG at end of vigorous activity, as it cleared, ...)?
