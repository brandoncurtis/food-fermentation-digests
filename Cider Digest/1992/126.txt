Don't boil your cider!!!


I heated mine up to 190 F and kept it there for twenty minutes. I had
no nasties and was able to avoid breaking down the cider through 
boiling.

Hey All!  Well, I be a newcomer here, and had a couple questions
that hopefully the seasoned experts may be able to help out with.
I have been homebrewing my own beer for about a year and a half now,
so I understand a lot of how the fermentation works, and what the
tools of the trade are..but...  


1)  Where is a good source for "pure" Apple Cider?  I am a city boy
   in Denver, Colo. and don't really know where to try and find some
   good cider.  I would imagine that using the wonderful store-bought
   Apple Cider products is all but out of the question...is this true?
   Would plain apple juice work?!  Or would there be too many off-flavors
   with these store bought varieties.


2)  I see some people say to use Champagne Yeast, and others say ale yeast.
   Will the Champagne yeast just yield a higher alcohol content and more
   carbonation, or what is the real difference and reason for each of the
   yeasts in Cider making?


3)  Are there other kinds of fruit cider that could be used to make hard
   cider? or just Apple?


4)  Any good books you could recommend on Cider making?


5)  Lastly, any good tips, or obvious things to avoid while making a first
   attempt at hard Cider making?


Thanks for any help!!  (I need it...;-)

        I made a batch of cider last fall and I am just trying it now, 
fantastic (burp) is all I can say. It is actually a semi sweet sparkling cycer.
Here's the what I did.


Started in the beginning of Nov. 1991


        5 gal. unpreserved cider + 5 campden tabs, let stand for 24 hrs. Heated 
about one gal. on the stove and dissolved 4 lbs. clover honey (did not boil). 
Filled 5 gal. carboy with cider/honey, saved extra cider (displaced by 
honey) to add later after blow-off. Aireated (siphoned loudly + shook carboy)
Added 2 pks. EDME ale yeast, 5 cloves and two sticks of cinnamon. Fermented 
at about 65 deg. F (quite vigorous for about a week) added saved cider as 
needed. (don't fill the carboy to the top, during vigorous fermentation ale 
yeast needs the surface area at the top to work well)  After the initial 
fermentation had subsided I racked into a secondary. About each month I 
reracked off the sediment at the bottom, by March the cycer was crystal clear.
Added 0.5 cup corn sugar and bottled. 


        I am no expert but the above method worked quite well for me. Hope this
helps.

P.S. I think I added one or two tsp. of yeast nutrient in the beginning.
