>2)  I see some people say to use Champagne Yeast, and others say ale yeast.
   Will the Champagne yeast just yield a higher alcohol content and more
   carbonation, or what is the real difference and reason for each of the
   yeasts in Cider making?


chanpagne will ferment out real dry.  i prefer ale yeast.  If you add
fermentables (honey, sugar) ale yeast will leave some sweetness.


>3)  Are there other kinds of fruit cider that could be used to make hard
   cider? or just Apple?


pears are common.  And if you want to try currents, peaches, plums,
or anything else, please do , and give me a bottle!  However, 
most of these beverages might be called "wines".  I have had
perry (pears) and japanese plum wine, and loved them.


>4)  Any good books you could recommend on Cider making?
   not in my opinion.  keep reading the list in the fall.
   I have got much better advice here than in my 2 books.


>5)  Lastly, any good tips, or obvious things to avoid while making a first
   attempt at hard Cider making?


sweet, sparkling is a bitch to make.  try dry sparkling of still sweet first.
If your cider is dry you can stabilize (potassium sorobate) and
sweeten before bottling if you can take it still.


BTW:  I plan to use "smartcaps" on still beverages in the future.
Without carbonation... there is no yest reproduction going on to
consume any O2...  so the "smartcap" will get the O2.
