Yow! Don't boil that cider! Either heat it to just 170 deg. for 1/2 hour,
or use sulfites. Here's an excerpt from a submission I made last year, 
detailing sulfite use:


Starting with 5 gallons of local, unpasteurized cider, I added
potassium metabisulfite to sterilize it. I chose sulfite sterilization
over boiling because I've heard boiling cider can change its flavor.
Among sulfites, there's potassium sulfite ("Campdens tablets"), sodium
metabisulfite, and potassium metabisulfite. People avoid sodium
metabisulfite for the same reason they avoid salt (high blood pressure,
etc.). Among the wine makers I consulted, they unanimously recommended
potassium metabisulfite. I don't really know why.


The solution of sulfites was made as follows: 5 level tablespoons are
added to 1 quart water, and dissolved. Then, 1 teaspoon of solution is
added per gallon of cider. This gives a concentration of 65 ppm, a good
(I've been told) level to use.  An alternate method is to use 1/8
teaspoon sulfite crystals to 5 gals. cider, for a 30 ppm concentration.
Opinion varied as to the optimal concentration to use. Somewhere
between 30 and 70 was the concensus. (I got the higher number from a
chemist/brewer, so I used that one.) Clearly proportions can be reduced
on the solution, in case you don't want/need a quart of it!


Once the sulfite was in, I put a damp cheesecloth over the carboy
mouth, and let it stand (without a cork) for 2 days. The theory here is
the sulfer can escape as a gas after doing its sterilization bit. After
48 hours, I added 2 packages Red Star champagne yeast, after
rehydrating it (I think). I shook the carboy well (to aerate the cider,
since yeast needs lots of oxygen to start growing), then added an
airlock and let it sit.


What I ended up with was a dry, fairly high alcohol cider that was GREAT!
Despite adding corn sugar when bottling, there were no bubbles. AS for how
to make it sweeter, some try adding so much sugar up front and an attenuative
yeast such that the yeast gives up while there's still sugars left, but I've
heard that all you end up with that way is a cider that'll knock you on your
ass. Another way might be to add unfermentable sugars, or just add 'em at
the end (after, say, sulfiting again to kill the remaining yeast).


Better luck next time,
Dave
