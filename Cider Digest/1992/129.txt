Hey All!


Haven't gotten anything from this list in a while, and I finished by first
attempt at hard cider, and thought I would post about it...


I just took a 1 gallon jug of pure Apple Cider, took out 2 cups, added
1/2 teaspon of cinnamon, and then added wine yeast....  It took off
fermenting crazily for about 5 days, then it slowed (I used an air lock
on the top of the 1 gallon jug).  At that time, I racked it to a sanitized
bucket, then back into the jug, replaceed the cap, and refrigerated.


What I ended up with was a VERY dry, low (no) carbonated drink.  Can you use
a hydrometer with this stuff to determine it's alcohol content? like
you can with homebrew beer?  


The cinnamon didn't take like I had expected, and there is not much
of a cinnamon taste.   I didn't replace the two cups of cider that I
removed originally.  If I would have put it back into the jug, would
the ending brew been a bit sweeter?  


FInally, what are "Smart Caps"?
