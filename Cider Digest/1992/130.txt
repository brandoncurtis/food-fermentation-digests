I made some cider many months ago(almost a year).
It was pure unfiltered apple juice with 1 cup of brown sugar and
eperney II yeast.
After they were bottled for a couple weeks I opened 1 bottle and
It tasted awful, it was however a sweet sparkling cider
with the right color and smell. So I left the bottles in the
basement with the cider as bottle holders and gave up on cider.
I opened another one last week and it was drinkable(very fizzy), except
when the sediment was kicked up.
Anyone out there had the same experience or know what the sediment is?
I might try making cider again this year.
