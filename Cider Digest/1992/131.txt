        Absolutely.  Use the hydrometer to measure your sugar level and
potential alcohol before you begin and after you rack.  Because cider
has virtually no unfermentable sugars and wine yeast is almost 100%
attenuative, what you will probably get is very dry unless you measure
at intervals and interrupt the fermentation.


        If you want it carbonated, prime with a little sugar or more cider
and bottle it in champagne bottles (this is what I do).  One pound of sugar
in 5 gallons (s.g. arround 1.008 going into the bottles) will give you
a wicked 5 or 6 atmospheres of pressure.  If you don't want you friends acting
like their attending a weapons test, you might want to use a little less. :-)


        If you want it sweet, treat it with a little potassium sorbate to
stabilize the wine, and then add a little sugar or cider to sweeten to taste.

        I haven't tried cinnamon.  However, American apples are very low
on two things, acidity and tannin.  I always add 3 grams of tannin to each
5 gallon batch (yes that's ONLY 3 GRAMS!).  The difference is unbelievable!
I also have to avoid sulfites like the plague because of the danger to
asthmatics (my teenagers) so I ferment a high acid must and let it mellow.
I use food grade tartaric and malic acids in equal proportions to bring the
acidity up to around .9% titrate equivalent to tartaric.  The malic acid is
what mellows out to latic acid.  Sounds like my cider works is more like
a chemistry project but friends, family, and co-workers all rave about
my Champagne Cider!


> FInally, what are "Smart Caps"?


        Hmmm.  Check the brewing digest on this one.  They've talked about
Smart Caps for capping beer bottles.  Beyond that I know nothing.
