I don't know about Cyser, but I have used buckwheat honey before 
for meads and DO NOT recommend it. It is a heavy honey with a
stronger flavor, and as such I have found it not very good
for making fruit meads.


As far as the choice of honey contributing to trtness, no that is not the 
case. The tartness arises from all the sugars being fermented out. In general
the tartness will mellow some, but not significantly in my experience.
Either fortify further at the start in future recipes, or perhaps
add an unfermentable now. The two choices that come to my mind are
lactose (as you mentioned) or malto-dextrin. I can not speak from
experience on how effective using either of these might be. Perhaps
someone else can provide a clue on whether these, or other suitable 
unfermentable sugars can be added post-ferment to balance tartness??
