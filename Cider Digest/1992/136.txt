  I'm new to this list so please forgive me if this has been
covered before. I just recently made my first batch of hard cider
trying to keep it as simple as possible. To 1 gallon of cider I
added some ale yeast left over from a previous batch of beer, shook
the jug up to aerate and put a fermentation lock on. I let this
ferment out (SG 1.040, FG 1.004) and then primed with about 6 oz.
of unfermented cider and racked to 4 plastic quart bottles. I let
this condition at room temp. for about 5 days until the bottles were
nice and firm and then moved them to the fridge. The result after
2 weeks in the fridge is very nice and sparkling, quite dry (which
I like) but it is still very cloudy. Is the cloudiness a by-product
of pasteurization or is all cider like that? Should I try to find
unpasteurized cider? Use some sort of gelatin perhaps?

Thanks for the tip.  I was going to use buckwheat honey in my next mead.

for the tartness to mellow.  I used yeast nutrients in my 4 month old
batch, and I'm guessing I will have to wait another year or more before it's
drinkable.

I suggest the malto-dextrin.  I have used it in several beers, with 
good results.  malto-dextrin is hard to disolve, so add it to a few cups
of boiling water, let cool, mix and bottle.


Then forget about it for a good long time. -- but next year, let us know
how it turned out.
