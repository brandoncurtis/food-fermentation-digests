About that cyser: We bottled it last night and it already tastes
amazing. An extra month of procrastination paid off. If anyone cares,
this was 8 lbs buckwheat honey in enough cider for 5 gallons, with
some cinnamon -- chewed up and spat out by champagne yeast. The cider
was unpreserved but filtered glass jug type; we mixed several brands.
When we tasted it, it was just slightly sweet, and the tartness had
mellowed. (Still had a slightly nasty green-mead aftertaste.) We
didn't prime with anything.


Cheers, etc.
Jake.

Subject: Cyser!


So, it seems that I have a friend who has an apple orchard, and whose
neighbor keeps bees.  Hmm... what ever shall I do?


I'm planning to make a cyser, and the current plan is to use freshly
juiced apples (said friend has a press) and honey.  The honey will
probably be an orange honey, unless I hear screams to the contrary;
the apples will probably be windfall Jersey Macs for the first batch.
Also, I recall seeing a recipe in the homebrew list some time ago which
called for brown sugar, so I was thinking of perhaps some of that or
perhaps some molasses.


I plan to pasteurize the (wort? must? what's the correct word here?)
.. something like 170 F for half an hour? ... then pitch with either
an ale yeast or a champagne yeast.  Why the ale yeast?  I was thinking
that warm-fermented ale yeast esters (banana/apple) should add flavor
interest, and perhaps leave some residual sugar when they conk out from
the high alcohol levels.


I assume I should correct the pH of the (wort? must?) down into a wine-
like range ... say 3.5 - 4.5 ? ... perhaps with something like citric
acid (read: orange/lemon juice) or tannic acid (read: tea, probably
just orange pekoe).  I'd rather do without sulfites (which is why I
plan to pasteurize).


Does this sound crazy?  Any suggestions?
