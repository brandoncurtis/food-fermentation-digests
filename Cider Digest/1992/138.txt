Subject: amount of primer


Howdy,


This will be my first batch of cider this weekend, following Jay's guideline 
of ~1 gal generic wort (1 lb light extract, 2 cups corn/cane sugar, 1 cup 
brown sugar) with 3.5 gallons fresh cider, and an ale yest. I can hardly wait 
to get going. 


My question is this, and pretty basic: For a bottled sparkling product, how
much corn sugar to prime? I know it's ~3/4 cup for beer, how different is it
with cider? Since I'm using ale yeast, would it be the same? 


As long as we're on the subject, how much primer if I keg it?


Thanks, and Cheers,


  Mitch
