Subject: Re: Cider yeasts


My statement about yeast "falling from the heavens" in cider
making was, of course, complete nonsense, as Jay Hersh pointed
out. The unreliable source was a book about the history of
Somerset cider. I've now gone and read the scientific reports of
the old Microbiology Department here at Long Ashton Research
Station, which state that cider yeasts came originally from the
surface of the fruit, but are now usually introduced from
culture. The reports do point out, however, that in a cider
factory with a continuous brewing process (and the customary poor
sanitation), the local flora in the factory is at least as a
source of yeasts as the apples themselves, particularly as the
factory yeasts have been acclimatized to the conditions.


Continuing on this theme, Jack S. says he plans to culture yeast
from the apples for making cider. This is probably not a simple
task, since there will be many different yeast species on the
surface of the fruit, some of which may produce a very
unpalatable drink if used to ferment the juice. The Long Ashton
Report of 1971 describes eight different yeasts isolated from
apples, including varieties of S. cerevisiae, S. uvarum and members
of other genera (ie. not Saccharomyces). The standard yeast used
in the cider brewery here is an isolate of S. uvarum. The authors
also tested the effects of inoculating apple juice with a mixture
of S. uvarum or S. cerevisiae with one of the other 'wild' yeasts
(e.g Candida pulcherrima*). They concluded that the resulting
cider had in many cases a 'more full flavour' than with the
single Saccharomyces yeast alone (which explains why cider
produced using a single cultured yeast is inferior to that
produced from yeasts present naturally on the apples), but that
some combinations were unpleasant, with acetic or sulphurous
tastes. If you culture from apples without a knowledge of
yeast identification, chances are you'll get a very different
drink from that made with a commercial yeast, or with the natural
mix of yeasts on the apples.


Incidentally, you can probably buy cultures of all these wild and
cultivated yeasts, at a price, from your national yeast
collection. Over here, a single dried ampoule costs 19 pounds from the
National Collection of Yeast Cultures in Norwich.


* N.B. These scientific names may have changed since 1971:
taxonomists like to change the names every few years to convince
themselves that they're at the cutting edge of science and to
confuse the rest of us.

  This is a recipe for a strong British cider called scrumpy.
  It is really strong.  One glass and the world begins to glow.
  A second glass, makes it all go.


  12# of mixed apples.  Be sure they are clean and with no
        belmishes
  1/2# raisins 
  1/2# raw meat
  1 gal. water at 70 degrees
    tradition calls for bakers yeast but I recommend a
     champagne yeast 


   Chop all ingredients.  Then grind the apples and raisins. A
  food processor is helpful.  Toss the ingredients into the
  water and stir.  Add the yeast and seal the brew bucket with
  an airlock.  Each day, stir the ingredients by swirling the
  ingredients in the closed bucket.  After the first fermenta-
  tion slows, about 8-10 days, move to a secondary fermenter.
  If you like a dry cider, add a second dose of yeast to the
  secondary fermenter.  Seal with an airlock.  Let sit until it
  the fermentation slows to a very slow, almost imperceptable
  bubble.  Move to a carboy to get out more of the particulates.
   Let it sit for about a week and bottle.


  The scrumpy will need to mature for about four months before
  you will want to even try it since it will give off a strong
D unpleasant smell and almost vinegary taste.  The longer it is
  allowed to mature, the better, smoother and drier it will get.


  It is wonderful served cold when mature.  I have let it sit
  for a year and it is quqite fine.
