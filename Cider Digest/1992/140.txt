Subject: well it's about apples...




    Once there was a farmer who was feeding apples to his pigs. An
    efficiency expert happened by and, seeing what the farmer was
    doing, said, "Old man! Why are you holding the pigs up to the
    trees and letting them eat your apples there? Would it not take
    much less time to simply shake the tree and let the pigs eat where
    the apples fall?"


    The farmer thought for a moment, and then answered him, saying,
    "What do pigs know of time?"

>1/2# raw meat


Like I asked before on HBD:
What is the raw meat for?
What kind of Raw meat?
Is this serious?

Subject: Goodale Orchards


I was biking in the North Shore area of Mass. last weekend and stumbled across
Goodale Orchards in Ipswich (on Argilla Road, near Crane's Beach).


They have terrific produce (lots of pick-your-own stuff including apples,
blueberries and raspberries), press their own apples for cider, and have a
bakery on the premises which puts out outstanding fruit pies and cider
doughnuts (yum).


I was surprised to see that they also are a bonded winery.  Actually they're a
cidery, producing two hard still ciders, one dry and one slightly sweet.  The
two ciders are 7% alc/volume and cost $6 for a 750 ml bottle.  I didn't buy
any, but will the next time I'm in the area in a car.


I had never heard of Goodale Orchards before or seen their hard cider for sale.
Has anyone in the area ever tried  it?
