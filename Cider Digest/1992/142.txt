Most of us reading this have most likely come across the topic of 
nutrition and beer in the HBD before.  These threads inevitably (not that
there would be any bias :-) tell us that beer is better for you than
most other forms of food - especially if you don't filter the yeast.


All that aside, I was wondering tonight about the nutritional value of
cider.  The old saying goes "An apple a day keeps the doctor away,"
and I'm curious if people feel this applies to cider in any way.  I can
see some of the same arguments/reasons for homebrew being good for you 
being relevant for cider as well.


For instance, unfiltered cider would most likely have a degree of yeast
which would give a smattering of the Vitamin B complex.  Then there is the
protein in yeast as well.  Unfiltered cider, furthermore, would likely
have citric acid (Vitamin C).


The alcohol could be of some concern:  a strong cider would have to be
drunk in moderation.  Yet I'm sure that most of us are aware that 
studies show a consistent and low level of alcohol consumption might
reduce the risk of heart failure.


Anyway, I'm curious.  Any comments on the above?  Anything to add?




Cheers,
