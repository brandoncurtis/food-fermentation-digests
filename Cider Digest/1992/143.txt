   I wouldn't automatically junk a feature of a recipe that somebody says
has worked for them.
   I would also note that when I was in England scrumpy had a rather rough
reputation, although it wasn't clear why...maybe the meat gives it an
acquired taste.

   The old saying about apples/doctors refers primarily to the fact that
whole apples are believed to reduce constipation; fermented cider, in which
the pommace drops out if it isn't filtered out, is unlikely to be much
help here.
   The vitamins in yeast \might/ be some help---IFF the yeast is drunk
(most of it stays on the bottom of the bottle). The amount of protein you
get from yeast is insignificant next to the RDA. I hadn't thought there was
any significant citric acid in apples (there's a reason it's called "citric"
acid); anyway, vitamin C is ascorbic ("anti-scurvy") acid, which isn't
the same thing (I don't know how different they are chemically). Vitamin C
is also very fragile---I was told to use it in biochemical experiments as
an anti-oxidant, since it would react with oxygen before anything else
could. Aerating cider to get a vigorous fermentation would lower the C
level (don't ask me how much), as might any handling of the cider (note
how fresh-pressed cider is \brown/, like a cut-open apple exposed to air).
