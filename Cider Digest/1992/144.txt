I wonder if this effect might be due to something else which is broken down
by the yeast.  My minimalist cider-making algorithm goes like this:


1) Take a 1-gallon jug of unfiltered juice
2) Pour out a pint and drink
3) Add yeast and fit with a fermentation lock
4) Wait about a week
5) Refrigerate and drink, including a fair amount of yeast slurry


Step 2 always gives me the trots, but Step 5 never does.
