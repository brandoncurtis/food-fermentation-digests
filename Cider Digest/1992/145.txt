Fair enough, but I was put under the impression that the meat was thrown
in only to continue activity in the batch - activity most likely from something
other than fermentation.  My recommendation was made to prevent the addition
of off flavors (really off flavors :-)

When I lived in England for a while, I made good with a Cornish guy (Scrumpy
comes from Cornwall, the southwestern end of England.  It's considered the 
boonies by many).  The impression I got about scrumpy is that it's rough 
since it is both highly alcoholic and thick with particles.  I don't, however,
remember anyone saying that they use meat in today's scrumpy.

I stand corrected.
