I missed the first part of the scrumpy thread, so I'm a bit confused
about the "meat" business.  Scrumpy as I know it is a rough cider from
Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. It is (or was when I was last down that
way in the mid 70's) cloudy and extremely potent.  The cider bar I 
frequented in Newton Abbot would not serve more than 2 pints to people
they were not familiar with, as it was far stronger than the stuff most 
people knew (Strongbow, Woodpecker, Blackthorn, that kind of thing). 
It was also extremely cheap, about 5p per pint at a time when a pint 
of regular bitter would set you back about 15p to 20p, and nearly the 
same for "regular" cider. The cheapness and strength of scrumpy were
often used to explain the reputed "slowness" of people who hailed from 
the southwest.

Greetings,


I've had a batch of cider in the carboy for a week and a half now, and I 
thought it would have stopped fermenting by now, due to an ale yeast I've used
on a number of homebrew batches. The OG was 1.050, and I wanted it to finish
sweet, hence the ale yeast. The recipe was 3.5 gal cider, and added to that
was a gallon (boiled) of 1 lb malt extract, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup corn
sugar, 2 sticks cinnamon, and 4 whole cloves. The yeast was rehydrated Edme
(11.5g packet). (recipe is a permutation of Jays)


The gravity is now at 1.012, and is just bubbling away (~10 bubbles/min in
the airlock) like it won't stop. Any idea when it will? Are the apple sugars
easier for the ale yeast to ferment, or do they produce less alcohol, enabling
the yeast (which usually conks out at 1.010 on an ale) to work longer? 


Enlighten me please, this is my first cider batch.


Also, how much corn sugar to prime, for a sparkling product?


Cheers,


  Mitch

Subject: apples




  I just moved to a plavce which has an apple and a crab-apple
tree.  The apple tree should produce some nice, big, red
apples.  right now they're medium sized and dropping like flies.
They are actually edible, but quite tart.  Should I try to save
these (perhaps by freezing) for cider?  Also, can crab-apples
be pressed in your usual apple press (i plan to rent one).


  Is there some measure of acidity by which i can guage my addition
of immature and crab-apples.  I have no idea of what kind of apples
this tree produces, so the cider mixture percentages published
in my cider book are of no help to me.




  Also... how nasty can apples get before they are no good,
even for cider.  I'm getting a lot of bird-pecks and an
occational worm.
