Sorry if any articles submitted saw a slight delay.
We recently made a chane on our main mail node from
one major vendor's hardware to anothers, and of course 
Unix being the highly portable environment it is 
everything worked perfectly without a hitch after the move.


NOT!!!!


the problem wasn't so much that things didn't work, as that
they didn't fail spectactularly, and of course the cider 
digest is often quite, so I had no way to know of the failure.


Well now everything is back up and running (knock wood),
and cider making season is rapidly approaching, so let's
talk it up.


To Mitch Gelly, hmmm, when I've fortified as you did, 
I did get fermentation ceasing at about 1.015, so I would suggest
you toss things into the fridge to see if you can halt or slow the ferment
before it runs away from you.


I had been using Whitbread Ale, and was careful not to let things
get too aerated so the yeast would not be as vigorous. I haven't
used Edme in ages, so that's an obvious difference for your results
varying, and perhaps you also aerated more thanI did.
