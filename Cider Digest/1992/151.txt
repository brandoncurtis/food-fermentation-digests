Sorry for delays in processing submissions recently.
We changed our main mailer machine, and did a vendor switch.
We switched from a Sun machine to a DECstation, let me tell you
Unix is not Unix....


On Sun the cron jobs have user specific crontab files telling
when to run a given user's cron job, so cron essentially becomes
the user and assumes the components of the users environment.
On the DEC machines there is a single cron job, and for some
dumb reason certain basic shell commands run differently within 
cron thanthey do from in a shell script. This means that when testing 
digest scripts by hand to see if they worked there was no problem, 
but when run as a cron job, they failed, and most annoyingly they
produced no error messages indicating why they failed, they just 
failed silently, AAAARRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!


So after much sleuthing we seem to have determined the problems 
and corrected them, and the scripts appear to be working correctly now.


I am leaving for vacation and won't  be back until Sept. 1st.
In the meantime things should run OK in autopilot, but no 
subscription requests or unsubscribe requests will be processed
during the next 10 days.


Cider season is upon us, so I want to hear some chatter....
Brewing season has returned as well, get to it....
