Mitch;


I have used the same ingredients you mentioned, with the exception of
the spices.  I've also used corn sugar in place of DME to yield about
the same OG.  M&F Ale yeast was used.  The fermentations have run as
long as 5 weeks (in cool weather) and the product has been quite dry.
I primed as for beer, with 3/4 of a cup of corn sugar for a 23 liter
batch.  The result is a sparkling, dry, light golden cider that my
wife (a non-beer-drinker) just loves.  Since dry was my goal, I'm
pleased.  


Based on my limited knowledge of cider chemistry, I have always
assumed that very small amounts of sugars other than fructose are
derived from apples.  Since fructose is completely fermentable by
almost any yeast the result is going to be dry unless there are lots
of unfermentable sugars from the addition of DME or something.


Jay's suggestion about less vigourous agitation to try to limit the
yeast's access to oxygen and thereby reduce its fermentary vigour is
interesting.  Is there anybody willing to do side by side experiments?
It's still too hot here in Vancouver for me to even think about room
temperature fermentation.

Subject: Meat in Scrumpy


Soon after arriving in Jolly Ol' England two years ago, I decided to 
investigate the intricacies of the plumbing system in our typical house in 
an affluent London suburb.  Only the cold water tap in the kitchen comes 
directly from the water main...all the rest are gravity fed from a cistern 
in the attic.  More like a horse trough.  One peek under the loose-fitting 
plywood cover convinced us to brush our teeth with bottled water!  Perhaps 
the meat in the Scrumpy recipe is just an attempt to bring US water up to 
traditional standards.  (BTW, I like an occassion Scrumpy.)
