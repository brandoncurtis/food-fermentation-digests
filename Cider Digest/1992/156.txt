Subject: My Cider Press


The press that I have is:


Correll Cider Press
24791 Warthen Rd.
Elmira OR 97437


Sorry, I do not have a phone number handy, buy I just wrote him a
letter (although calling information might also work as Correll is his
last name).  I purchased my press from him directly last year and have
been very pleased with it.  I believe that he makes 3 different sizes
and 2 different quality levels.


I bought the "cheap finish lo-capacity" and let it live in the corner
of my family room.  It is not as nice as the solid wood one, but it was
significantly cheaper.  I was able to make 10 gallons of juice in a
very short time.  Sorry I forgot to time it, because I was having fun :-)
He claims that his press does very well at press-off  w.r.t.  through-put.


I have only seen these for sale at a fruit stand in eastern washington.
He get busy this time of year, so you might want to call  him and find out
what the scoop is.  I have no no connection with this man other that being a
very happy customer.
