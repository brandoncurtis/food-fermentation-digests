Howdy folks,
        I am new to the Cider Digest, but have been an avid
reader of the HBD for some time now.  I have been brewing
beer and mead for over 2 years now, although I have not 
progressed to the stage of "real brewing" yet, at least
in the eyes of one vocal HBDer.  Anyways, I feel my
brewing techniques are sound, and would like to undertake
a batch of Hard Cider.  
        Consequently, I am looking for recipes.  I have
two ideas in mind.  The first cider I would like to try
would be be a sweet cider; sweet as in not dry, but not
sickening either.  The second, and this may or may not
be possible, would be cider which included some malt
to give it a little more body, but not enough to put
it over the edge so it tastes like a beer.  Has anyone
tried this?  I am Nuts, or will this produce the 
nectar I imagine it will? 


Good Day.
