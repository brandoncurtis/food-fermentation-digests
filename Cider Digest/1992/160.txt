Subject: Presses, "cider" apples?




  I am interested in buying a cider press.  Somebody published
a list of several merchants selling a veriety of "wine" or friuit
presses.  They ranged in price from about $80 for a "plastic"
press... (i doubt this would be sturdy enough for apples)
to about $350 (i bet this could handle apples).  Anybody know
how i might find out which presses might be ok for apples?
Are they common at flea markets?  Could I build one?
What might a nice wine press look like?
Cider press?


  I think some wine presses look like grain mills.  They have a screw
which shoves grapes into a confined space.  I always pictured a cider
press as looking like a printing press, (a plate with a screw & wheel
on top), which had a "plunger" that fit into a slotted bucket.


Is this right?


Anyway....  All this interest is because I just moved, and i have
an apple and crab-apple tree now.  Many neighbors have apple trees,
and many would willingly give me apples if i give them a cut of the
cider.


BTW:  Can i make apple sauce or apple butter from the discarded pulp?


OK... now the big question.  Has anybody ever seen a proper english
cider apple?  My next-door neighbor has a HUGE tree.  perhaps 40'
tall and about 15' in RADIUS!  It has many bushels of small, green, 
tart apples.  They are perhaps 3" in diameter, bright green,
and have little brown "dots" on the skin that actually stick out...
you can feel them quite easily.  I found them to be quite edible,
but very tart.  (but i like tart apples... like mcintosh... i hate
red delicious)  He finds them too tart for anything.  I think they
would be fine if they were sweetened in pie.... but i digress.
If they are so tart that they tend to make you pucker when you eat
them, will they be too tart for cider?  I hear that english cider apples
are very tart.  I really hope they might work for cider, AND i can
find a press.  If so, i'll have to "Acquire" quite a few more fermenters
for the cider from that huge tree!
