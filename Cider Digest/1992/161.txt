OK everyone, this should be the announcement to end all announcements :-) :




WHAT:          Cider Picnic


WHEN:          October 3, 1992


WHERE:         Anderson Fruit Farms, Westford, MA


PRICE:         $5.00 a head to be paid in advance!! (Please)  This includes
               a porta-potty, food, plates, tables, charcoal, and other things
               to get a picnic rolling.


FOOD:          While food is included in the cost of the cost above, everyone
               is asked to bring a side-dish.  And guess who gets to 
               coordinate it?  ME!  We need salads, deserts, and other 
               side dishes to make this more than a burger/sandwich-only
               affair.


CIDER:         I have been set straight on this issue, so contrary to
               my last post,  Cider juice orders (apples only this 
               year) are to go through Paul Correnty - NOT ME.  Paul
               may be reached at home at 508-433-8187 or his work
               number which is 617-433-8187.  Paul is available for 
               both cider advice and price questions.  He estimates that
               it will cost $3.50 a gallon, but won't know for certain
               until the day of the picnic.  So you will pay Paul on the
               day of the picnic.  NOTE - I recommend you try Paul at 
               the office.  He goes to bed EARLY (8PM) and gets up in the
               wee hours of the night.


QUESTION:       Who is feeling generous?  Paul would like to get corn on the
               cob this year, but needs to borrow someone's Cajun Cooker.  He
               has the pots we need, but not the cooker.  If anyone is
               willing to donate one for the day, it would be most appreciated


OTHER:         Paul says that he will take checks for the cider orders.  He
               will be at the meetings (Worts and BFD) to take your order.




The only thing not set in stone, or so it seems, is a time for this all
to happen on Sat. 10/3.  I am open to suggestions: Does 1PM sound OK?  


Lastly, you can make your "reservations" for the picnic by calling me
anytime until 11 PM at 617-484-0948 or 617-489-5127.  The second
phone number has an answering machine on it and is the general "house"
phone.  So use that if you can't reach me on the first.


Otherwise, I may be reached at gkushmer@jade.tufts.edu and I check my
messages pretty regularly (sanity need).  


Cheers!

Subject: Tart apples - an opinion


Concerning Aaron's tart apples:




I would guess that a high attenuating yeast (such as Red Star Champagne) 
would take out a lot of the tartness.  I don't know that I can explain why,
but it seems that champagne yeast takes out anything resembling a sugar
molecule and converts it to alcohol.  I would guess that at least part of
the tartness is a sugar molecule combination and that conversion to 
alcohol would take some of the tartness away.


But don't take my word for it ;-)

Subject: Cider Presses


I happened across my press at an antique store in Iowa (Gutenburg?) 
a couple months ago.  $75.00!  They called it a "lard press", although I 
found the words "and fruit" on it as well.  It's cast iron, about a foot 
in diameter and 18 inches tall.  It works perfectly (lard is apparently 
an excellent preservative for iron), AND it looks great beside the 
fireplace.
