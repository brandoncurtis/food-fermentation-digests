Actually greg my experience is oppposite of what you said. 
The more attenuative the yeast, the more tart the final product
since more sugar has been consumed and thus there is less to 
balance the tartness. Red Star is one of the most voracious of
the yeasts I've tried. The Epernay 2 is much better.


If you look at the Mead article in the current Zymurgy they have
a chart with some relative comparisons of various mead yeasts
(they're general Wine and Champagne yeasts which cider and mead makers
use too). The Epernay 2 seemed top perform very well if you're looking
for a yeast that will leave more final sweetness and fruitiness.
