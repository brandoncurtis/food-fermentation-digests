Dan asked about camden, and vinegar.


   camden : 1 tablet per gallon, wait 24 hours, pitch vigerous yeast starter.


   vinegar:  yes this is a bacteria, but it is an aerobe.  This means
             that if you keep O2 away from your cider, you should 
              be relatively safe from vinegar.  You might get
              a vinegary cider like woodpecker, but not vinegar.


              A good, strong yeast starter should consume up the O2,
              and saturate the cider with CO2 this inhibiting acetobacter
              fermentation.


             What kind of fermenter did you use?
              What kind of fermentation lock?  The old sterile cotton
              batting will allow O2 to difuse and make vinegar.


             I would realluy like to know how you got vinegar.  I have
             been TRYING to get vinegar out of my mediocre cider, but
             have been unsuccessful.  I got an acquarium pump and
              0.2 micron air filter in the hopes that the aeration will
             help my little acetobacter "mother" grow.


              BTW:  How much alchahol can acetobacter tolerate?  Perhaps
                    my 7% or so "stretched" cider is too stronk for healthy
                     acetobacter.
