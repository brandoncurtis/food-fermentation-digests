   Is there any reason not to allow for some natural cider fermentation,
then pasteurize, then pitch yeast?  Seems this would allow for some of
the complexity of the natural yeast, but stopping it before it got too
wild, and before it got too vinegary.

I used the same equipment I use for beer, and I don't have any infection
problems with my beer, I must assume it's the cider that was the
source.  Oh yeah, glass carboy with standard plastic 3 piece fermentation 
lock.  I used ale yeast (Red Star maybe?).

I think you may be onto something here, the cider that I used had enough
sugar in it to produce 5% alc. according to the hydrometer.  Actual
alcohol based on FG reading showed between 4 and 4.5%.  I did not add
any sugar.


My wife has been using the apple vinegar, but we've got a lifetime
supply now and I'd rather not make anymore!  I'm definitely going to
take the camden route this time.  


One more question on the sterilization, should I leave the carboy 
uncovered for the 24 hours to let the camden evaporate off?  I'm going
to do this one it two 1 gallon batches this time in case I still have
problems!


I did not get vinegar when I boiled the cider but I lost alot of apple
character.


While I've got you all here :-) another general question, my wife wants
something a little sweeter (like Woodpecker which IMHO is ALOT sweeter).
Could I use a wine perservative like Potasium Sorbate to kill the yeast,
add sugar, and artificially carbinate in my beer kegging equipment, then
bottle the stuff?  Would it clear in the bottles then and how much
pressure should I apply while it's in the keg for the pressure to hold 
up in the bottles after going through the bottling process?  Anybody try
this?  I suppose I could skip the bottles but I don't want to tie up a
keg (beer is the #1 priority still, cider is around #3 as far as the
kegging equipment goes).
