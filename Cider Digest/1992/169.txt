dan asked ... how do you let the camden rest...


I put it in a carbouy with an airlock.  I dunno if this is the suggested
method, but my yeast starter survived.  I'll let you know the taste
results in a few months ;-)


I have stabilized with pot. sorobate and sweetened.  works fine.
I'd suggest either fructose or honey for sweetening.  WARNING:
If you boil-sanitize the honey, it will have a protein break and
cloud the cider.  i'm judt drinking clouded honey cider.


i found fructose at the health food store.  Its really great for
sweetening ANY fruit-flavored beverage.  I'm not kidding here...
it also makes Cool-Aid taste MUCH BETTER!!!!!!


  I'll sweeten with fructose next time, so i do not get that protein
haze.

What the hell, here's my $0.02 on cider sterilization. I've made a 
couple good batches as follows:


Starting with 5 gallons of local, unpasteurized cider, I added
potassium metabisulfite to sterilize it. (Campdens tablets are potassium
sulfite. Also available is sodium metabisulfite. The wine makers I
consulted unanimously recommended potassium metabisulfite. I don't
really know why.)


For a 65 ppm solution, 5 level tablespoons are added to 1 quart water
and dissolved. Then, 1 teaspoon of solution is added per gallon of
cider. I weighed it out, and 0.68 grams per 5 gallons cider is 65 ppm.


I have yet to try but have been told 30 ppm is sufficient. An alternate
method to produce that desired concentration is to add 1/8 teaspoon 
sulfite crystals to 5 gals. cider. (Opinion varied as to the optimal 
concentration to use. Somewhere between 30 and 70 was the concensus. 
I got the higher number from a chemist/brewer, so I used that one.)


Once the sulfite was in, I put a damp cheesecloth over the carboy
mouth, and let it stand for 2 days. After 48 hours, I added 2 packages
(maybe rehydrated?) Red Star champagne yeast. I shook the carboy well,
then added an airlock and let it sit. 6 rackings later (& many months)
I added 1 cup corn sugar & bottled. It did not carbonate, was not
sweet, and disappeared rapidly! 


Questions bit:
- -----
This year's batch I think I'll add honey (to taste) before I bottle 
and let it bottle-condition like that. The stuff was so clear, I question
how much active (or even dormant) yeast is left in suspension. Does
anybody have a guess? I'm thinking that the pre-bottling sulfiting
you're suggesting may not even be necessary. Is the honey too fermentable,
i.e. will all sweetness disappear? If that happens, I suppose I'd have
a cyser, needing lengthy aging for the honey to mellow?


Dan, what's use #2 for the kegging equipment? By the way, I grew in Ramsey,
NJ and used to roller-skate in Woodcliff Lake.
