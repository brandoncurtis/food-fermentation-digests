Dave,


My #2 use for the kegging equipment is soda, almost exclusively root
beer.  Cider is a very seasonal thing for me and I suppose that's true
of most people.  I work right across the street from Tice Farms, so the
cider is quite fresh!


I think what I'll do is put in the campden, let sit with airlock for 2
days while my ale yeast starter with boiled apple juice works.  Pitch
that and while it's fermenting try to figure out what I want to do with
the final product, sparkling or still, sweetened or not.  BTW, thanks
for the fructose suggestion Aaron.


I suppose I could experiment a bit, there's still alot of time left in
the cider season.  Three one gallon batches might be fun.

I'm a new subscriber (last week) to the Cider Digest, and since I work at
DEC I don't have the ftp capability to pull older issues out of the archives,
so please forgive me if this has been discussed before.


Background-
I am a U.S. Civil War reenactor and I'm looking to produce an authentic cider
that would have been commonly available during the Civil War, 1861-1865. I will
be planting a mini heirloom/antique apple orchard (+ peaches & cherries )
next spring, but I have to decide now which varieties to order.


Request-
I'd like to know if anyone has an early- to mid- 19th century recipe for cider
which specifies the varieties of apples used, such as " X gallons of Roxbury
Russet, X gallons of Grimes Golden, X gallons of Winesap..", etc. 


A documented date for the recipe would be a plus.




If anyone can quote a recipe or point me to one I would greatly appreciate it!




Thanks!
