Subject: Ciders Wanted!


I'm planning on having a cider-tasting party around Halloween this year,
and I'm trying to collect as many brands as possible. So far I've obtained
the following :


    Blackthorn Dry          Bulmer's Woodpecker
    Grant's Yakima          Woodchuck (from Vermont)


I may also have a chance to pick up some Seven Sister's Cider (from Idaho)
in the next week or so.


My question is, what others are available (either in the Northern California
area, or by mail order)?  Would anyone be willing to act as an agent and
obtain a good regional brand for me?


Many Thanks!

  Its harvest season, and my one small tree produced
over 3 BUSHELS of apples!  Now my question....  How much
juice should i expect from 3 bushels of apples???
I have only 2 carbouys right now (one is tied up with lambic).
Will i need more?  (they are 5 gal.)
