Subject: question


I have some grocery store cider brewing right now - I believe it has
been pasteurized but has no preservatives. About 12 ozs of it is from
a can of treetop apple juice. My question is, when it's done
fermenting and is ready for bottling in a couple of weeks, I will
probably sweeten it slightly with a little bit of sugar syrup. Do
I need to add stabilizer to keep it from beginning fermentation again?


Also, if I use homemade cider from my trees (no pasteurization), won't
it turn in to vinegar unless I add some Campden for 24 hours to sterilize
it before adding yeast?


What is corn sugar?  Where can it be bought?  Are we talking about corn
syrup here?


Thanks.

>But I was thinking, if beer yeast is not as attenuative, why not use
it in cider?


I have in fact done this with good results. I have made a draft
cider the last 2 years using dry malt extract as a gravity booster.


This year I plan to forgo the malt extract and instead take a portion of
the cider, and boil it down. This will remove water, thus concentrating
the sugars. I will add this back into cider that has not been boiled
and ferment that with an Ale yeast.


I've never heard of anyone using hops in cider. Personally I wouldn't
want any bittering or hop aromatics in my ciders, the apple aromas are
what I'm after.

Subject: cider yield




Using a food processor to shred cored apples (quite fine) and then
pressing the apples against a strainer, I got a little over one wine
bottle's worth from a 2 gal bucket of apples. I don't know if a press
would yield more - I would guess about the same. Extrapolating, I would
guess I used about a peck and there are 4 pecks in a bushel, so my method
would yield close to a gallon per bushel. I'm guessing you're looking at
2 - 3 gallons for 3 bushels.


I used a little red delicious (10%), some Mcintoshes (a bit green yet and
very tart - 20%) and mostly golden delicious bordering on sweetness but
just slightly green and tart (70%) from my dwarf trees, and the apple
cider is fantastic. Not having a press, I can't really make enough to
justify fermenting it but it's great for drinking as is. Tree-ripened
apples beat the heck out of those grocery store ones.


Anybody know how to build a small ciderpress?

If the apples are crushed well I usually get a gallon
per 1/2 bushel.  Therefore I would expect you should get
5 to 6 gallons of cider.  Your milage may vary, void where
prohibited, see your dealers for details.
