Hmm. How does this compare to apple jack, where some or most of the
water in the hard cider is removed by freezing? I would guess that you
lose a lot of flavor by boiling the cider to reduce it, though maybe
reducing only a portion of the cider would be an okay compromise. But
freezing after fermentation I guess would concentrate too much of
those other, nastier products of fermentation.  (Phenol alcohols?
"Esters"? I don't really have a good grip on what these things are.)


Does anyone have experience with these two methods of making cider
harder?


Cheers,
Jake.

I was wondering about his myself.  how about a store bought juicer?
has anyone tried this?  are they more/less efficent than a press?


I am also looking for a good way to get the oil out of hemp seeds;
something like a sunflower press.

Yes.

Maybe, mine did, I will use Campden or the equivalent from now on.

Corn sugar is NOT the same as corn syrup.  Corn syrup is slightly
carmelized.  Corn sugar can be found at home brew shops.  You can also
get it from major food distributors but only in 50 lb bags.  For small
quantities a home brew shop is probably your best bet.

Corn sugar is dextrose, try the brew shops. You should be able to buy any size
quanity you require, from 1/2 lb to 100 lb bags.


Don't use corn syrup, it contains artifical flavours - e.g. vanilla
