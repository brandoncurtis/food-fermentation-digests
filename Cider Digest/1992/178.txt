I looked at the juicers too. My bet is you would be constantly
stopping and cleaning the very fine strainer, which would be a
pain for anything larger than a glass of juice. I'm wondering
how well they work.

I take it you're making some very hard cider.

Scott Bauer implied that ciders are availible by mail order. He listed various
brands that he had obtained. I have not seen any cider for sale since 84 or 85
and then in New Orleans. If there are mail order sources, could somebody post
them, please ?


Since apples grow poorly this far south, the only juice I can get is from a
store. Apples grow poorly because of heat and warm winters ( probably other
factors too), thus, it is hard to ferment anything except in Dec to March
when it is cooler. How sensitve is cider to warm temps ? Is it a function of
the yeast as in beer ?
Next, does cider have to be force carbonated ? or, can you add a little juice
or malt extract to prime and then bottle. Also, I noticed that someone said it
took a long time to ferment cider, 3 weeks ?, ferment out ? long maturation
time as in mead or barley wine?
Just a few questions to ponder.
(also, too hot to grow rasberries, it kills me to read about guys picking
2 or 3 pints on a whim to put in their brews. at the store, when in season,
$2.99 a demipint.)

the difference is I am concentrating the cider to bump up the initial
gravity of the must, in apple Jack the water that is removed increases
the relative alcohol content, I am simply making a high sugar content
syrup from the cider rather than fortifying with malt or other sugar,
so there really is a difference here.
