A pot pourri here.  I have not tried boiling to concentrate, but one
potential problem is that you are not only concentrating the sugars, but
also the (non-volatile) acids in the sweet cider.  You should watch out
that the fermented product does not become unbalanced by the higher
concentration of acid.


As for sterilizing, I have not had any problems just taking the raw
unpreserved sweet cider from our local farmers market, and adding yeast
to it directly.  No off flavours or vinegary taste.  The only problem has
been a touch too much acid in the final product - which I hope to cure
by using ale yeast rather than champagne yeast this year.


Priming.  I just use corn sugar, same as if priming homebrewed beer.

Well, I've one batch of cider under my belt.  Talk about newbie - I also
only had two batches of beer done too.  Anyhow, I got 4 gallons of cider
from a local orchard - dumped it into my plastic fermentation bucket and
pitched one packet of Red Star something-or-other de Mousse wine yeast.
It fermented for about 2 weeks before I tasted it - TART.  Methinks to
myself, "Well, the yeast will eventually ferment as much as they can if I
keep adding sugar.  The left over sugar will give it some sweetness."
So I dumped 4 lbs of corn sugar into the bucket and put the lid back on.
About two weeks later I tasted it again - TART - but not toooo bad.
I wanted to start a batch beer so I bottled.  Some bottles were primed
with a teaspoon of cane sugar (cane sugar makes beer "cidery" but this
was supposed to be "cidery" right?  Besides, it was all I had hand)
and some bottles weren't.  Well now, almost a year later, ALL of the bottles
"sparkle".  There are a few (the ones I primed) that can only be opened
cold or gusher results.  The apple wine (learned a lesson on how yeast
contributes to flavor) still tastes great and might even be improving
though there is no apple flavor to speak of in my finished product.
My next batch will use Ale yeast and maybe even some malt extract.

There is a farm in Westford, MA, that my parents have used for years to
send apples in the autumn.  It is Anderson Fruit Farms and their 
phone number is 508-692-6581.


I don't know if they will ship cider (apple juice) but someone could
give them a try if they are desperate enough.


And, no, I don't have any affiliations with them (etc.)

I've recently checked out a book from the local public library:
 Sweet and Hard Cider Making It, Using It, & Enjoying It
 by Annie Proulx and Lew Nichols
 1980 Garden Way, Inc.


It has a wealth of information about cider, the history, processes
for making, recipes, etc.


I'm wondering if anyone else has read this...It seems like a great
how-to-do book!
They mention kits for making your own crushers and fruit presses.
Anyone out there have any experience with this?


About two weeks ago I purchased 7 gallons of sweet cider from a local
orchard in Acushnet, MA and followed the recipe from the Cats Meow
for NE Cider, execpt I used Pasteur Champagne yeast (the recipe called for
wild yeast). The cider has been fermenting now for these two weeks,
everything seems to be order. Any experience out there for Cats Meow 
recipes?

Subject: wheat beer yeast in cider


Hi,
 Have any of you tried using a wheat beer yeast in making cider. I was
 thinking about it last night and it seems like the spicy flavors usually
 associated with those yeasts might go well with a cider.


 I`ll probably give it a try here sometime this fall.
