Subject: What type of sugar should I use?

I have been making ciders by following a recipe in "The Art of Making
Wine", a book from the 70s that is still in widespread use.  It
instructs me to add enough sugar to bring the SG up to 1.060.  The book
doesn't recommend any type of sugar.  I've been using cane sugar
purchased from the grocery store.  Will there be any significant
difference if I use the dextrose that is sold at my local homebrew
shop?


Also, is there a wine makers digest?  I have some questions on
maintaining correct SO2 levels in wine as it matures.


Thanks,
Tom
