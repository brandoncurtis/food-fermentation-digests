In  Cider Digest #182 Jack gives instructions for his press, and I thought
I'd add this small addition. It makes cleanup a lot easier if you use a heavy
cloth of some sort to hold the apples while they're getting pressed, rather
than pressing directly against the wood. The press I go to uses what looks
like burlap for this process, and removing the remaining pulp is simply
a matter of picking up the cloth, dumping it into the bin, and hosing it
off. The never have to pick bits of apple gunk out of the working press.


For those of you in Ohio, it's Hobby Horse Hill press just east of
Bellefontaine. Pressing starts today. I've been going back there for about
4 years now, he buys all sorts of apples and mixes them together to get a
really good flavor. It's also the oldest still-running wooden cider press
in the state. 


The batch of cyser from 3 seasons ago is just starting to come into it's own.
2 years in the cask, and 1 in the bottle. Mmmm...
