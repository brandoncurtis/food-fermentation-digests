I have made up a small test batch of cyser, using 1 gal of nice sweet
cider and 1 lb of wildflower honey, fermented with a champagne yeast.
It was bottled after 6 months in glass carboy, and it is now just under
1 year old.  A test bottle was tasted, and proved to be rather acidic
and a bit "raw alcohol" tasting.  Suggestions?  Phil Hultin.
