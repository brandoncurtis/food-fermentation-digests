Subject: Some observations

Last year I was given 5 gallons of raw cider from my neighbor who has
an apple orchard (sells soft cider, apples, honey, ...).  I made five
gallons of hard cider (a Jay Hersh recipe) and bottled in champagne
bottles.  What started off as brown, cloudy, sweet cider turned into
light, clear, carbonated ROCKET FUEL!  The ale yeast I used didn't
stop as I had hoped.  I think it was Cooper's dry Ale.


Actually, the first few sips are quite good, like a apple-ish Brut
but after a half of glass, I'm ready for something sweeter.


After a few batches I have a few observations:


If the hard cider is too tart, mix in something sweeter.  I've
used soft cider for that appley taste.  I've used Sunkist
lemonade to make a refreshing lawn mower drink and powered
sugar and club soda for something more bubbly.


Don't use hops;  save them for your beer.  I want this appley.


Don't boil the soft cider.  I've heated up a quart or two to
disolve other ingredients (honey, cane sugar).


I have not had success using dried malt extract in cider.  YMMV.


Don't use champagne yeast but some Ale yeast.  I've used both liquid
(London #1028) and dry.


Expect a lot of trub in the primary fermenter.  All those yummy, cloudy
apple particles feed the yeast and fall to the bottom.  Makes great
compost slurry.


Cider needs time to mellow.  My best ciders are over a year old.  Brew
some now for next fall.


I find cider is a nice alternative to homebrew.

Hello,


Is there a quick and easy way to make naturally carbonated, sweet cider, 
similar to WoodChuck from Vermont?  I like mine dry, but my SO likes hers
sweet!
TIA!!

I built one using this basic idea, and I have some comments
and questions. 


1) The flavor of my first batch has a definite pine taste,
   which doesn't make it undrinkable but nearly so. Is this
   why real presses are made of oak? I'm not sure how to get
   rid of it. I'm hoping that with use and age, the pine
   flavor will diminish. Maybe I will soak the bottom part
   of the press in water for a while, or mash up some
   apples and leave em sit for a day and then discard.
   Any recommendations?


2) The presser board that just fits inside of the box, that the
   threaded rod pushes into, cracked in half the first
   time. I replaced it with a piece of 2x10. 1x just isn't
   strong enough. Also, the threaded rod tended to screw
   right into it as it was tightened down so some kind of
   metal piece is needed on the top of the board. Also, the
   threaded rod tended to walk away from the center as
   pressure was applied. I recommend some 1x strips to form
   a little square around a metal plate or washer in the
   center of the top of the presser board. Something like:




              _____________
             |             |
             |    _____    |
             |   |  _  |   |
             |   | |_| |   |
             |   |_____|   |
             |             |
             |             |
             |_____________|




3) For the top I used 2x pine instead of 1x. To keep it in
   place when turning the threaded rod to press the apples,
   I attached a small gate latch (the "tongue" part) to each
   side of this board.


   The other part of the latch is screwed into the outsides of
   the press box itself.  Then I put the "tongue" of the
   latches down over the ring part, insert a stick or piece
   of rope in the ring, and start pressing.


   There are many different sizes of these at any hardware
   store. They come with all the screws needed. Make sure the
   latch screws in the sides of the box are short enough that
   they don't protrude into the box. If too small, they might
   not stand up to the pressure when pressing. I think my
   latches are the 2  1/2" size.
