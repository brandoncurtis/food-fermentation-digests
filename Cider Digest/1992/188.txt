i just rented a wine press, and is used a stack of pressing
boards.  The bottom one touches the fruit and is largest.
subsequent boards get smaller, and there is a metal piece on
top.  The stack of boards is roughly the same height as the press
is deep.  This way, there is an "arch" to evenly distribute
pressure, and a long torque arm can be used, since the arm will
not get lower than the top of the "basket" as you press.

Lalvin is a brand name of a yeast "manufacturer" here in Canada. I use their
yeasts regularly with good success. Anything I've bought has always had the
Latin name of the yeast strain printed on the outside. You are probably
misreading this as "Institute de Champagne". I suspect you have champagne
yeast. I use it for my cider with no problem. It does produce an extremely
dry cider however so I've started adding some glucose edge off. Glucose
isn't readily fermentable so some residual sweetness remains.  I prime
with about .75 cup of dextrose when I bottle and end up with a nice 
sparkling cider with a very apply nose.


While on the subject of additives, last year I added 800 grams of strawberrys
to 5 U.S. gallons of cider with absolutely wonderful results...good apple
taste and nose with a touch of strawberry. I'm definitely going to repeat it
this year and also try a batch with raspberries.
