Most wine recipes I have call for bit of sugar syrup (even for
dry wines) and stabilizer added before bottling to stop
continued fermentation and exploding bottles. The recipe I'm
using for the current batch calls for adding a little bit of
sugar before bottling.


1) Should stabilizer be added to cider before bottling?
   Without it, is a sparkling cider automatically produced?


2) Must cider be bottled in Champagne bottles? Will wine
   bottles break or something?


3) Can champagne bottles be corked with a regular wine corking
   machine, or must some special device and cork/cap be used?
   
3) Will Grolsch bottles with the porcelain caps suffice?
