I've never heard of stabilizer, so can't help you here. If you add sugar to
a cider that has fermented completely, or if you bottle before it's fermented
completely, then you'll get sparkling cider.

If you're going for sparkling cider, use champagne bottles or beer bottles.
Still cider will work fine in wine bottles.

Dunno about this one, I use bottle caps.

Works fine for me. I generally use regular beer bottles or Grolsch bottles.
Note that you should replace the seals on Grolsch bottles every so often. I
got a bottle of "Pils im Stein" beer the other day, which comes in an
earthenware crock with a Grolsch-style cap. Way cool, and I'd convert over
to them for cider except that they're so damn expensive.
