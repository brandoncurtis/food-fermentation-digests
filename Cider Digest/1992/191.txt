I wonder if the readers of cider digest, and especially the
organizers, feel the way I do about the way this is currently
being run.
Instead of sending out a digest whenever one or two messages
come in, so that I get 2-4 digests/day, would people object
to perhaps only issuing a digest once a week or so, so that
there are several messages in each issue?  My email box is
getting terribly cluttered as it is.
The distribution schedule could be changed, if more frequent
postings began to occur.  There is a market for cider digest
(witness the thread on cider going on in homebrew digest just
now!)  but maybe a bit less often?
