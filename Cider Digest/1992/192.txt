I quite agree with HULTINP@QUCDN.QueensU.CA's suggestion to reduce the frequency
of the cider digest distribution.  Once/day would be more than enough.  Once/wee
k
would be too infrequent, since people _are_ interested in the answers to their
questions.  My vote is to distribute once each day (assuming submissions!).

I prefer to get it every day rather than once a week. More
interesting than the boring meeting notices etc I normally
get.

Hi all,


I feel that until the number of submissions increases to about 9 a day,
a digest should be produced every two days.  after 9 a day is exceeded,
once a day is perfect.  A week is too long because usually people are 
looking for answers to questions.  If it's going to be once a week, i 
might as well email directly to the individual asking the question instead
of sharing with the other ciderheads.


Humbly,

   How long does it take for a "standard" cider recipe to ferment out?
Let's say, 1 gallon of cider, 1 lb. of sugar (of whatever type), and
1 package of rehydrated dry ale yeast, kept at 70 degrees.


   I like the digest the way it is.  As cider-making is seasonal, it's
important to have timely answers/discussions.

        I'd be happy if the digest was sent out once a day instead of
multiple times per day, but would prefer it more than once a week.
That's my two pints worth ... :-)

          I'd agree with this to a point.  It would greatly decrease
        the value of having such a digest if it were once per week.
        If someone asks a question, it could well not get out for
        a week, and then any answers sent to the digest wouldn't
        appear for ANOTHER week.


          How about once per day?

you never get more than 2 on any given day since the cron job
that mails the digest only runs twice a day.


I am perfectly willing to reduce this to once per day.  Note
digests are only sent when there are submissions.


If you think your mailbox is cluttered try processing subscription
requests.


I do however not like the idea of caching submissions since it will
require my having to work on the digest control scripts,  something I
have no time for.


As a last resort if folks are that unhappy they can unsubscribe
or better yet someone else could own the digest (its easy to complain
when someone else is on the hot seat to do the work)

Hello,


In cider digest 191 HULTINP@QUCDN.QueensU.CA writes:

        I haven't seen that many cider digests come for me to say 2-4
per day.  There have been a few days like that but very sporatic.
I have received far more homebrewer digests and they only send out 1 per
day like clockwork.  By the digest numbers, I haven't missed any for
a long time either, so they are coming in just as they're sent out.


        I would not object to limiting to 1 per day but 1 per week would
introduce too much latency into discussions.  If you have a question, a reply,
a follow-up, and a remark you've shot the better part of a month just for
four exchanges.  It would certainly put a damper on any active discussion here.


        If we only had one per week, you would not get this reply for a
week and wouldn't be able to respond for yet another.  Not good.  Not good
at all.  Slower than the Post Office.


        With this digest AVERAGING right around one per day, it's certainly
not a major source of clutter in my mailbox.  Besides, I use "elm" and
break them all down into myriad little mailboxes.

        Definitly a market for this digest, and I'm starting to see more and
more individuals from HBD showing up here (I'm one...  Hello Jack...).


        HBD is also gatewayed into rec.crafts.brewing in the news system.
(No I'm not suggesting gatewaying the Cider Digest, just mentioning the fact.)


Conclusion:


        I still see more HBD than Cider Digest, so I don't think the frequency
is too high, just a little irregular.  I would not object to limiting one per
day but would object to one per week.
