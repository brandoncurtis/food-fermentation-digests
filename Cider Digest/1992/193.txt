I would be happy to see a Cider Digest in my box every day but I think _one_
message a day is plenty.  HBD is one a day, and I like that format.


One, every other day, would also be ok, but sometimes you want to get help
quick, and the round-trip time would be ~4 days in the bi-daily case.


Just my $2 x 10^-2 worth.

Subject:      Preservatives


I can get a hold of almost generic cider in the grocery store.
The label says it contains:  Apple cider from concentrate.
Nowhere on the label does it mention preservatives.
Am I safe in using this stuff?  Seems like if it contained
any kind of preservative, they'd have to put it on the label.
I was thinking of using this generic cider with some 100%
apple juice concentrate to get the gravity up.  Maybe throw
in some brown sugar.


Ideas? Suggestions?  (on the preservatives or recipe)


Darren
