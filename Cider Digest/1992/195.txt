I for one would like to see it continue as is especially since there is
low volume.  It seems to me I don't get more than one a day at most and
certainly not the 2-4 digests/day you seem to be getting.  Did you check
the dates of the digests?  Maybe your mailer is a little slow?  After
all, messages are grouped together on CD as they are on the HBD,
they are not sent out individually as the come in like other SIGs.
