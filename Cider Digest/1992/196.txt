I am very interested in the second half of the first batch you talk about
here.  I am very inexperienced, but find it hard pressed (no pun intended)
to find a veteran with good suggestions about sparkling sweet cider.


I have a few questions:


1) how much is "a *small* amount of preservative"
2) what type of preservative did you use?  I have BHT at home, will this do?
3) you said "very sparkling." does this mean the the fermentation of the
   last 2 cups of sugar was slowed, and not stopped.  if so, what happens 
   to the unopened bottles in two months?


Thanks,
