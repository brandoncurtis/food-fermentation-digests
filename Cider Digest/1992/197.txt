Well, I'm about to try my 1st hard cider.  Hey, gotta start somewhere.
I'm listing my recipe below.  Anything I should change or add?


2.5 gallons apple cider
 48 ounces  100% apple juice concentrate
  1 pound brown sugar
  1 quart Whitbread ale yeast starter


I'm not sure the amount of brown sugar is acceptable, this is just a guess.
In the Zymurgy article on cider, it talks about adding tannin for acidity.
Will lemon juice work?  Seems like lemon juice would be ideal for adding
tartness to a cider.

Subject: Problems starting cider fermenting


I recently bought a case of 4 gallons of Apple Cider, unpreserved, no sugar,
from Trader Joe's.


I took a gravity reading, and it was 1.050, and I said, "I can ferment this
just the way it is!"


I rehydrated a packet of ale yeast in 110F water for 10 minutes, then pitched
into a 1 gallon jug.  I added a pinch of Yeast Nutrient, and put an airlock on.
As an afterthought I took a pH reading, and it was at 4.5 or below. (my paper
is 4.5-7.5 range, and it was very strongly on the 4.5 end)


After no activity in 24 hours, I tried adding some vigorously fermenting
beer wort to the cider.  5 hours later, nothing.


I'm wondering a few things:
1) Do I need to oxygenate the cider, as it was probably pasturized, and hence
   has no dissolved O2 that my yeast wants for aerobic activity?


2) Do I need to buffer the cider so the pH is closer to 7.  If so, what with?


3) Is there something else I should do to this off-the-shelf item to make my
   cider get off the ground, and start fermenting.


Thanks for any help...
(I have 4 more gallons waiting to start...oh, joy!)
