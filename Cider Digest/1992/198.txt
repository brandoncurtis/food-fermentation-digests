Do you always rehydrate your yeast at 110F ?  My personal feeling is that
this is too hot. You may have killed your yeast.  I believe the Yeast
Special Issue of Zymurgy recommends 100F.  Since you added fermenting
beer wort to the cider, I expect your cider to start soon.

well after many complaints from my girlfriend about the draft cider
I made last year tasting like malt I took a different approach.
I boiled 2 gallons of cider down to 1/2 gallon and added this to
2 1/2 gallons of cold cider.  The final mixture was 70 degrees
and I pitched the ale yeast right away.  It is now bubbling happily.
I will keep you posted on developments.

Summary of what came before, plus some extra info:


I took 4 and a half gallons of generic, unpreserved apple cider from my local
supermarket. Sg of the juice was 1.052.  I did not bother
fortifying.  I pitched Red Star Champagne Yeast, and allowed the
fermentation to complete.  My notes say the final sg reading was
1.002.  I added 3/4 cup of corn sugar for priming, and 1tsp of
citric acid crystals.  I bottled 2 and a half gallons in beer bottles.  I
then added 1 and a half additional cups of sugar to reach near the
desired sweetness, and the *2 CAMPDEN tablets* to arrest the
fermentation, and then bottled immediately.  So the sweet batch
had roughly 2  cups of extra sugar added to 2 gallons of
fermented cider.  


I received the following questions in response to my original posting:

   I am very interested in the second half of the first batch you talk about
   here.  I am very inexperienced, but find it hard pressed (no pun intended)
   to find a veteran with good suggestions about sparkling sweet cider.


   I have a few questions:


   1) how much is "a *small* amount of preservative"
   2) what type of preservative did you use?  I have BHT at home, will this do?


as I filled in above I added 2 CAMPDEN tablets.  How did I decide
to do this?  I went to my local home beer and wine making supply store
and said what should I do to arrest the fermentation of my
cider---but not right away, so that if I bottle it it will still
become carbonated.  The reply was 1 CAMPDEN tablet/gallon.  If you
have some other preservative I reccommend asking your local
homebrew dealer.


   3) you said "very sparkling." does this mean the the fermentation of the
      last 2 cups of sugar was slowed, and not stopped.  if so, what happens 
      to the unopened bottles in two months?


I  think you are correct that the fermentation of the last 2 gallons
was slowed and not stopped.  It has been at least 2 months since
bottling (but not 3), and none of my very few remaining bottles
has exploded.

   I saw your post. A couple of questions:
   ....
   How long do you let it ferment ?
   ....
   DB


(The .... are questions that Danny also asked and were answered
above).  As for the  how long did I let it ferment... Since I was
planning to add the sweetner after the first fermentation, I did
not feel it was necessary to keep close track of the fermentation.
So I waited until the activity subsided, and then kept taking sg
readings until they completely stabilized, which was at 1.002.
This took about 2 weeks in a 70 degree basement.
