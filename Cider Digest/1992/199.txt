I am trying to ferment my first cider and am at a point of cluelessness. 
I pressed 7.5 gallons of cider and added 1.5 Campdens per gallon.  I
waited two days and then pitched an active ale yeast.  This was Sunday
evening and there's still nothing happening.  Am I over estimating the
power of Campdens?  How can I rectify the situation and get this stuff
fermenting.  The books I've read say natural fermentation will start on
it's own when the Campdens dissipate.  Does the stuff need to sit in an
open container?  Should I aerate it to speed things up?


Send ideas/suggestions private email please.  Thanks in advance.


BTW, I have some pear juice thats doing the same thing.
