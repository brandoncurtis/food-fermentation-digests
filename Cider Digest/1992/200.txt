I've been told I should add tannin to my cider. The Zymurgy article
on cider states that tannin gives the cider backbone and structure.
My cider has already started fermenting (6 hour lag time!).
Can I add this tannin later with a little pasteurized apple juice?
How late can I add the tannin powder?

Ok, if you can't tell by my questions, I'm kinda new at this apple stuff.
What I'm wondering is, what is the difference between apple juice and apple
cider (I'm talking about the kids-stuff cider you can buy at the grocery
store, not the hard cider that we are all trying to perfect).  Are they made
using different blends of apples?  Does it matter which is used for a base
for hard cider (of course it has to be unmodified with 
preservatives/additives)?


On a side note, now that kiwi fruit is on sale for dirt cheap, does the idea 
of some apple-kiwi cider appeal to anybody?  Or should I just stick to eating 
the little limeys by themselves, and wash them down with some good cider?


Any input would be appreciated, email or post.


John.

I've nearly finished my first batch of cider and I have some questions.  It's
been fermenting about 1 week now, and the cider is nearly done.  My question
is, will the cider clear up on its own?  How long will it take?  I started
with freshly pressed cider (unfiltered) and after the 1 week of fermentation,
it is still cloudy.  Do I need to filter it?  I have noticed that some stuff
is settling to the bottom of the fermenter.  Another question, I'm going to
sweeten it up when it's finished (cane sugar) and add some potassium sorbate
to arrest the fermentation.  How much sugar will it take for 2 gallons?  The
raw cider was fortified with 2 cans of Granny Smith concentrate.


Is there a good book on cider making that someone could recommend?  One
with many different recipes?


P.S. How about some experts out there posting some different recipes for us
novices.  I've only seen a couple so far.  


Thanks,

I don't know if any of you who want sweet sparkling hard cider have
kegging equipment or not but I'm trying an experiment this year with
half of my batch.  Half the batch is just going to be primed and bottled
like beer which should give me something quite tart.


The other half I will use potassium sorbate (?) wine perservative to
kill of the yeast, add sugar, then carbonate in my kegging equipment.
After carbonated (artificially) I plan on putting it into bottles.  I
plan to carbonate it a little more than I desire to make up for any loss
during the transfer.  I'll let the list know how/if it turns out.


My only concern is the clearing of the cider with dead yeast which would
probably take longer than usual.  I'll probably use some speedy
bentonite for that.
