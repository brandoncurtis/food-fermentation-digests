   Well, i am still pressing apples, although i got 10 gallons
this weekend.  I did some analysis on my two apple sources as follows:


   My red macintosh-ish looking apples:
           O.G.  1.044
           acid  0.4 % as tartaric
           pH    3.9


   My neighbors little yellow bumpy apples (brown dots stick out of yellow
        skin) :
           O.G.  1.072
           acid  1.4 % as tartaric
           pH    3.2


   Those tittle bumpy yellow things sure have a lot of everything!
It looks like a blend of slightly less than 1 gallon of "yellow"
apple juice with just over 4 gal of my "sweet" juice will give
me the desited acid level of about 0.55 %.  


   Obne question:


        I took acidity AFTER sulphiting.  Will the camden effect the acid
   titration?  (do it form H2SO4 or something?)


Also..  like chris i'm having a tough time getting ferments going
after camden addition.  The first 5 gal batch i pressed showed no
activity 1 week after pitching (which was 2 days after sulphiting).
I aerated a bit, and re pitched.... i got minimal activity.
Now its going full guns... almost 3 weeks after the initial pitching!


  I also have 1 gal of concord wine which i started with pasteurized 
concord juice.... no action 1 week later.  Do the sulphite gods hate me?
Might i be doing something wrong?   How can i ensure a helathy ferment with
the 10 galons i made this weekend?  (I have starters going all over
the house!)


  Oh...  just for grins, I am doing most of the cider with WYEAST
european ale, since it is low-attenuation.  I will be doing 5 gallons
on S. Delbreuckii (the bavarian wheat wild yeast) for a clove flavor
cider.  (it sound good to me!)

Can somebody please post (or email) a copy of the oft-quoted "Zymurgy article
on cider"?  Apparently this is a highly respected source of info.
