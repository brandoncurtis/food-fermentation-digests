Colleagues:


On sulphiting:  the more acid the must, the less sulphite is required.  For 
readings below a Ph of 3.5 or so, one tablet for every TWO gallons should be 
plenty.  Also, with really high quality yeast like Wyeast, the wild yeasts 
should be pretty well overpowered, and with decent, well-washed apples, I've 
had good luck omitting the sulphite entirely.  But yes, sulphited juice is 
scary for a week or so.  Best advice I've had is to make sure your yeast is 
truly active, pitch it, and leave everything the heck alone.
