That must be hard on the arms...  :-)

rather than using (gasp) aspartame/Nutrasweet, get some malto-dextrin
from the local brew shop or health food store.  This is sugar that the
yeastie beasties have a real hard time breaking down.  you'll have to
boil it into some water or cider to get it to disolve (better wait 'till
it's cooled a bit after the boil, so as to not break it down.)
I believe you can add it either in the initial batch, or at prime time.


Works wonders in my beer!

Well, I think I found what works best for me as far as sweet sparkling
cider is concerned.  I need to let the final product age a bit more to
remove some of the ale yeast residuals but here is what I did:


After fermentation in the secondary was complete (FG 0.998) I added 1/2 a
teaspoon per gallon of potatasium sorbate and let it sit half an hour.
I then added cane sugar at the rate of approx. 2/3 a cup per gallon
which was to my taste.  That amount of sugar gave me a sweet cider with
a hint of tartness, a little less sweet than Woodpecker.  Your mileage
may vary.


Anyway, I then kegged it and applied CO2 to artificially carbonate.
After it ages in the keg a bit I plan on moving it to bottles simply to
free up the keg for other batches (I've only got one keg right now).


As I said, this method works fine and although I had to resort to
chemicals, I do the same thing for wine anyway so I figured it was no
big deal.




For carbonating my dry sparkling cider I simply add fresh boiled cider
before bottling.  I used sugar when kegging because I was not sure if
the "yeast clearing" process would be seriously affected or not.  It
appears to have cleared quite well though so I don't think that's an
issue.  It would water down the alcohol level though.
