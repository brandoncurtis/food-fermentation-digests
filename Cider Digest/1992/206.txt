For those of you within driving distance of Northboro MA, Tougas Farms has a
sale on fresh cider @ $2/gallon.  They have a bumper crop this year and
have a lot of cider.  Of course, no preservatives.


They also have a petting zoo and pick-your own apples and other stuff.


They are near the church street exit off of rte 290 (from boston, take the
pike to 495 north to 290 west and get off at church street, you will see
a sign pointing towards it near a farm stand for Davidian farms; theirs is
$3.50/gallon).

ps - Julios Liquors on rte 9 in Westoboro now has a small homebrew section,
and the owner is willing to special order at cost if he doesn't have to
stock or hold it.
