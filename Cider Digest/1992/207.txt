I understand that it is posible to use gelatin as a clarifing
agent in cider.  Can anyone give me specific instructions on
how to use it?  I have some Knox unflavored basic (powdered)
gelatin at home.  I also have about 5.5 gals of cider that's
ready to go in the bottle.  Do I just pour the stuff in the
fermenter and mix it in and wait a few days for it to settle out?
Do I mix it with water first?  Do I heat the mixture?
How much, i.e., how many packets?


Please post your replies, as I'm sure there are others 
who are interested.
