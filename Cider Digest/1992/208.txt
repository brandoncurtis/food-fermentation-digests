I brew beer mostly, and I use gelatin whenever I need to clear
the beer. I used to use this special gelatin from the brew store
but the unfavored knox seems to work too. I had this murky cider once,
(made with unfiltered juice) and gelatin cleared it to a clear yellow.
Use about a tablespoon per 5 gallon of wort (or cider), add it to
a cup of boiling water and stir until it is all dissolved. I usually
let it cool down a little, but you can also use it cool, pour the stuff
into the fermenter gently. Then wait about 3/4 days and you will see
this gummy stuff at the bottom.
Good luck,
P.
        I understand that it is posible to use gelatin as a clarifing
        agent in cider.  Can anyone give me specific instructions on
        how to use it?  I have some Knox unflavored basic (powdered)
        gelatin at home.  I also have about 5.5 gals of cider that's
        ready to go in the bottle.  Do I just pour the stuff in the
        fermenter and mix it in and wait a few days for it to settle out?
        Do I mix it with water first?  Do I heat the mixture?
        How much, i.e., how many packets?
        
        Please post your replies, as I'm sure there are others 
        who are interested.

   Well, i am still pressing apples, although i got 10 gallons
this weekend.  I did some analysis on my two apple sources as follows:


   My red macintosh-ish looking apples:
           O.G.  1.044
           acid  0.4 % as tartaric
           pH    3.9


   My neighbors little yellow bumpy apples (brown dots stick out of yellow
        skin) :
           O.G.  1.072
           acid  1.4 % as tartaric
           pH    3.2


   Those tittle bumpy yellow things sure have a lot of everything!
It looks like a blend of slightly less than 1 gallon of "yellow"
apple juice with just over 4 gal of my "sweet" juice will give
me the desited acid level of about 0.55 %.  


   Obne question:


        I took acidity AFTER sulphiting.  Will the camden effect the acid
   titration?  (do it form H2SO4 or something?)


Also..  like chris i'm having a tough time getting ferments going
after camden addition.  The first 5 gal batch i pressed showed no
activity 1 week after pitching (which was 2 days after sulphiting).
I aerated a bit, and re pitched.... i got minimal activity.
Now its going full guns... almost 3 weeks after the initial pitching!


  I also have 1 gal of concord wine which i started with pasteurized 
concord juice.... no action 1 week later.  Do the sulphite gods hate me?
Might i be doing something wrong?   How can i ensure a helathy ferment with
the 10 galons i made this weekend?  (I have starters going all over
the house!)


  Oh...  just for grins, I am doing most of the cider with WYEAST
european ale, since it is low-attenuation.  I will be doing 5 gallons
on S. Delbreuckii (the bavarian wheat wild yeast) for a clove flavor
cider.  (it sound good to me!)

Can somebody please post (or email) a copy of the oft-quoted "Zymurgy article
on cider"?  Apparently this is a highly respected source of info.

My experience with cider is that if you let it sit long enough, it will
clear on its own.

Subject: clearing


I've added some gelatin finings to my cider in preparation for
bottling in a week. I took a taste - high octane without much
cider flavor. To improve it before bottling, I'm thinking
seriously of cutting
it 50-50 with some fresh-squeezed cider that has cleared and
had some Campden added to it - to improve the flavor and
lower the alcohol content per pint. Then I will add a touch
of sugar syrup or dissolved honey and bottle it in Grolsch
bottles for some, hopefully, sparkling cider.


Anybody tried cutting the hard stuff with regular cider right
before bottling? Is this a crazy idea?

Subject: Gelatine Finings


To use gelatine as a fining agent:  One 10g package of unflavoured
gelatine per 5-6 gallon (19-24 litre) batch.  Add the gelatine gradually
with stirring to about 250 mL of hot water (I use water from the teakettle
allowed to just come off the boil), stir until it is all dissolved.  Cool it
off, and pour it into the cider or beer or whatever.  Stir it in, and let
stand for about 1-4 days to clarify.


I frequently do this at racking time, put the gelatine liquid into the
fresh fermenter, and then siphon onto the gelatine so that it mixes pretty
well as it fills the fermenter.


If you are having clarity problems with cider, I recommend the use of
pectinase ("pectic enzyme"), which will do a super job of removing the
heavy haze most of us have seen in the early stages of cider making.


Cheers!  Phil.
