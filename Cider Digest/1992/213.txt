Subject: Cider sale ($2/gallon) in Northbor, MA


For those of you within driving distance of Northboro MA, Tougas Farms has a
sale on fresh cider @ $2/gallon.  They have a bumper crop this year and
have a lot of cider.  Of course, no preservatives.


They also have a petting zoo and pick-your own apples and other stuff.


They are near the church street exit off of rte 290 (from boston, take the
pike to 495 north to 290 west and get off at church street, you will see
a sign pointing towards it near a farm stand for Davidian farms; theirs is
$3.50/gallon).


/greg


ps - Julios Liquors on rte 9 in Westoboro now has a small homebrew section,
and the owner is willing to special order at cost if he doesn't have to
stock or hold it.

Subject: Inexpensive cider press?


I went to apple country a couple of weekends ago (around Los Angeles, 
that's Oak Glen in Yucaipa), and stocked up on apples and a couple of 
gallons of cider. One of the gallons I "made" myself, in a small cider 
press on a small apple orchard. (I put made in quotes because all I 
did was turn a crank which chopped up the apples my wife was tossing 
into a hopper; the orchard owner did the actual pressing.) The mill 
and press were on a cart about the size of a gas barbeque, which made 
me wonder about buying a home-sized kit for pressing cider. It's hard 
to find raw cider in L.A. short of the two hour drive to Yucaipa, and 
we both love fresh cider, so, does anyone know where I could buy a
small cider press, and about how much it would cost?


(If you couldn't tell from my question, I'm new to this list. The 
gallon of "U-Press" cider is now in a closet with some ale yeast; we'll 
see how it turns out. By the way, in case no one's thought of this 
before, the batch of apples that went into the cider included a few 
pears.)
