I have unsubscribed the bad address. Some machine somewhere has this
message queued up and re-trying. The digest uses a standard format in 
which mailers are provided an error address. Someone somewhere is not
using the error address and is instead bouncing the mail to the digest.
They seem to be under the impression their machine has no problems,
but I havce checked and the problem lies outside of my software
and hardware control. I am continuing to contact the folks at the
offending site, hopefully this will stop soon.

I understand that it is posible to use gelatin as a clarifing
agent in cider.  Can anyone give me specific instructions on
how to use it?  I have some Knox unflavored basic (powdered)
gelatin at home.  I also have about 5.5 gals of cider that's
ready to go in the bottle.  Do I just pour the stuff in the
fermenter and mix it in and wait a few days for it to settle out?
Do I mix it with water first?  Do I heat the mixture?
How much, i.e., how many packets?


Please post your replies, as I'm sure there are others 
who are interested.

This undeliverable mail from uucp@zoo.toronto.edu is getting to be a little anno
ying. Anyone know what is up with it? Is it possible to remove them from the 
list so the rest of us don't have to read every digest over again? This is
my only gripe about the list and it is a minor one at that. Other than that
I think Jay is doing a fine job.


As to making cider, I have made several quckie gallon batches and I have a 
5 gallon batch aging right now. I used 5 gallons of apple juice and champagne
yeast. I tasted it last week and it is pretty good but I would like it to be
a little sweeter and have more body. I think a few digests ago someone
suggested that maybe using wheat would do the trick. Anyone tried this?
