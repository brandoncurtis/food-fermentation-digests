I've got a gallon of local cider going in the basement right now.
It's been filtered, and maybe pasturized, but no preservatives have
been added.  Here's the timeline so far:


Sep 15 - remove 12.5 oz cider from gallon and replace with frozen
concentrate (also no preservatives).  Add a package of english ale yeast.


Sep 18 - still not much action.  Added 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient.


Sep 20 - head has formed.


Sep 23 - head falls.


It's still bubbling away.  How long does it take for a gallon to
ferment out in a situation like this?
