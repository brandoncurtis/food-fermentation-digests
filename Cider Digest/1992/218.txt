Yeah, buy a gallon of cranberry or apple juice. They come in glass jugs, and
size 8 stopper fits an Ocean Spray bottle perfectly. I've got 5 of them sitting
next to me here (I'm really at home now) bubbling away, next to the 5 gallon
jug.

        Buy apple juice in glass bottles.  They work great.  I have some
that I've been using for cider and mead.  If you don't want to make
cider out of the juice that comes in them (it's not the best but it work
OK) you can always drink the AJ first.


        I have been told that buying 1 gallon glass bottles separately
is pretty expensive -- you pay more for the empty glass than you would
for the glass with juice in it.  Makes no sense to me, but there it is.
Good luck,

What about a one gallon juice jug from the grocery store?  Stoppers with
and without holes are available from good homebrew stores.  I got mine
from New England Beer and Wine Hobby.*  Just buy a gallon of apple juice
or cran______ or whatever.  If you need the jug NOW, pour the juice into
a different container, such as a pitcher.
