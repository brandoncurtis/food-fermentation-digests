Michael - if all you are looking for is a one gallon vessell, then your
local supermarket has what you need.  Buy one gallon of apple juice or some
other liquid, clean it out, and le voila - you have a one gallon container.


On-campus food services as well as kitchen staff at a Greek house might 
also have containers they chuck in the bin.


Finally, homebrewing supply stores have one gallon glass fermenters.


Good luck,
