I picked my 1 gallon jugs out of the local recycle company's clear glass
bin...best of all...I didn't have to work through a gallon of juice to get
the jug!  Recycling in it's simplest form!

Good day all...
        I need a pretty easy recipe for cider that will be brewed in those
one gallon glass jugs that we have been hearing so much about lately.  I'm 
extremely new at all this do-it-yourself alcohol creation and would like to
get started in say...twenty minutes.  *laugh*  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.


Thanks.
