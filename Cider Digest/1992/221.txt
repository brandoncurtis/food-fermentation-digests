Easiest recipie I know of:  Get some fresh pressed apple juice with 
no preservatives or additives in it.


Clean (sterilize if you like to play safe) out a glass container.


Add the juice to the container.


Wait.


There is a natural yeast on apples that ferments juice well enough if
left alone.  Eventually, after the fermentation slows down, you should add
a fermentation lock on top.


And that should do it.

The easiest thing is to buy the gallon of pure juice(no preservatives), 
toss in some yeast (rehydrated or liquid), and put on an airlock and hope 
for the best. Add a little more time and you can also "sanitize" the juice,
either by sulphites or pasterization.

Good day all...
        I need a pretty easy recipe for cider that will be brewed in those
one gallon glass jugs that we have been hearing so much about lately.  I'm 
extremely new at all this do-it-yourself alcohol creation and would like to
get started in say...twenty minutes.  *laugh*  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.]
