Subject: A thoroughly uninteresting cider

Twenty days ago, I put down my first gallon of cider to ferment, and
last night I thought I'd taste it to see how things were going. It was
still a little cloudy, though it had stopped bubbling about a week
before. I siphoned off a dram, sipped it, and was struck by... well,
by it's almost complete lack of taste. There was a slight yeasty taste,
and a faint hint of something which might almost be apples, but by and
large, it had no flavor.


To be honest, as I sat there continuing to taste it, taking bigger and
bigger sips, working my way to the bottom of the glass, I began to
enjoy it more. The thought occurred, "If this stuff were cold, I could
drink it like spring water." Mostly, I think, I was so relieved that
the cider was actually drinkable that I was willing to overlook how
thoroughly uninteresting its taste was.


My questions, of course, are, where did the flavor go, can I get it
back, and how can I keep it in future batches? Any advice would be
appreciated.
