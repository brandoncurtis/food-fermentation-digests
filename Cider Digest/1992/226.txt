        First, some details about the year old batch that I wrote about in 
digest #224 that had an off flavor.  I didn't sulphite the cider or treat 
with any other chemicals, and I think it was pasturized.  The cider tasted 
perfectly fine before fermenting, although I assumed that it was not tart 
enough.  It was what someone refered to the other day as "yummy" cider.  
Finally, the fermentation temperature was somewhere between 60 and 70 F.
        Rick Cavasin points out that the off flavor could be from "uninvited
guests".  That could be the case, but I thought that it was strongly
recommended (by the guru of cider, Paul Correnty) to ferment with whatever
naturally comes with the juice.  Maybe my local microbes are not as good as
his, or maybe I accidently introduced something at home.  
        Of course, as Rick suggests, it could be the yeast.  The flavor is
definately not phenolic (cloves), and I don't think that it is fusel alcohols,
although I have no experience with them.  One thing that I do know about Edme
is that I have never gotten this taste in the beer that I have made with it. 
It is a strong enough flavor that I don't think that it would be masked by the
flavor of beer.
        Well, I'm still not sure what went wrong with that particular batch,
but what's done is done.  Thanks Rick for the suggestions.  Next time I will
probably sulfite and use a different yeast.
        Now, I am pleased to say that this year's batch is going well.  It's
been about 5 days since I put the actively fermenting cider into the fridge. 
Low and behold, it is clearing.  It's just at the level of sweetness that I
want, i.e. sweet.  It still has a bit of a yeasty taste, but I will give it
more time.  Actually, I will take Hank Luer's suggestion and chill it to just
above freezing and then rack it.  I will probably not sulfite it since it is
only a gallon and I expect to keep it in the fridge (and it probably won't be
around long anyway).


                             Thanks for the discussion,


                                    Joe

I've used Potassium Sorbate with great success to shut down an active
fermentation in both wine and cider.  For this year's cider it worked
well and I've gotten many "tastes like Woodpecker" comments.  Big change
over previous failures I've had.  I used the Potasium Sorbate to kill
the yeast, added a little extra sugar, then artificially carbonated in
my kegging equipment.
