In discussing wild yeast at JCM, Rob Bradley asks about pasturization
effects on cider taste.  One easy test for immediate effects is to
take a jug of unfermented cider, pasturize a bit of it, and then
chill this sample to the same temp. as the remaining cider.  Now taste
them.  Is there a noticable difference?  A 15min at 160F pasturization
on the cider I bought this fall produced no marked change in flavour.
Someone with more refined tastes might not agree.  Also, this doesn't
rule out potential changes in the taste of the final product.  A useful
test might be to take two samples of the same cider, sulphite one and
pasturize the other, then ferment them identically.  Then do an A/B
test on the results fermented under identical conditions.
