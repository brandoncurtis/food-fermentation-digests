Subject: Metallic taste from aluminum cooking pots?

I elected to try pasteurizing my last (second!) batch of cider, and
the resulting product had a slight "metallic" taste - could this have
been from the pot?


It's possible that it's not - I used a half gallon of food-grade apple
concentrate to up the gravity, and that might be throwing of the
flavor.


I tried using cinnamon, and the bubbles from the airlock smell great!
