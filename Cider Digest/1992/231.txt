A desperate plea for help .....


I making my first batch of cider; I have encountered a problem.
My cider has appeared to stop fermenting after just a few days.  I used a
recipe from Zymurgy. Instead of dry champange yeast I used liquid yeast. The
cider I got from several local orchards in the Norhtern Ill. area (none of it
with preservatives in it).  Is there anything I can do to save this batch?
Can I get some yeast nutrient and repitch new yeast or is all lost?
I should note that I have been making beer from 5 years now, so I made sure that
everything was sterile.  I added both corn and cane sugar to raise the specific
gravity to ~1.070.


  Thank you in advance for any and all help that I recieve.

Cider brewers,


I would like to support Michael Perreault's request for recipes, 
pointers, instructions, etc. as I have also had some very explosive 
results with my first experiments. There are obviously differences beer
and cider brewing.  Please share these with all of us in the cider            di
gest (as opposed to email) so that we can all learn.  Thanks.

Subject: the first few batches this year...




        I've been preparing a few batches of cider this year (the less said 
about last year's attempts the better).  I'm trying various combinations
of sweetener and yeast in order to make some comparisons.  The results to
date:
        All my cider is from Merrill Farms (Ellsworth ME) or Cold Hill Press
(Penobscot ME), mostly macs, cortlands, and delicious.
        Batch 1 was lager yeast, with cane sugar.  Its been in the bottle
about a month now.  A taste test the other day showed it still to be fairly
bitter still (though some friends loved it).
        Batch 2 was ale yeast, with cane sugar.  Similar age.  Its not as
dry, a bit smoother, perhaps less character.  I'm not a good judge of char-
acter, nor can I distinguish a lot of the fruity, toasty, etc flavors that
other people speak of.
        Batch 3 is still fermenting: all natural, no added sugars, no added
yeast.
        Batch 4 is still fermenting: honey, with champagne yeast.
        Batch 5 is still fermenting: corn sugar, with sherry yeast.


        I'll let you know how it all comes out...
