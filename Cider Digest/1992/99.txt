Subject: SINGING OF THE CIDER


Howdy ciderheads,


     Thought I'd share a bit of cider lore with you.  My girlfriend, a grad
student in colonial American history, told me about this.  In 17th and 18th
century New England (and maybe elsewhere), the term "singing of the cider"
was used to describe the low-key fizzing sound made by the fermentation
of cider in the colonial kitchen in its open container.  The interesting
bit is how this noise, and hence hard cider itself, saved some women from
being convicted on witchcraft charges!


     According to my source, a frequent defence of a "goodwife" against a charge
of witchcraft was to present evidence of her adherence to her domestic "duties,"
e.g. cooking, cleaning, and yes, cider-making.  Jill (my girlfriend) cites
court testimony from the 1710's in which a neighbor of a woman accused of
witchcraft testifies to having entered her (the defendant's) kitchen one day
and seen "soup on the fire, and everything in good order, and heard the
singing of the cider."  The woman was acquitted, of course!  It seems that no-
one believed you could be evil if you fulfilled the roles dictated to you,
or at least if you made cider!  So think when next you quaff your homemade
cider of the noble history of the drink, that saved our long-departed colleagues
from the gallows.  Brew on!
