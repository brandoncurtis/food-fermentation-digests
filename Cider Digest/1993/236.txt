Hi All,
        I've got one quick question... I made a batch of (Rather late) holiday
cider that was due to be bottled (I actually think I keg it but thats beside
the point -- any comments?) about a week ago.  It is still showing active 
fermentation even as we speak -- for two months now.  When it finally decides
that it is done, I would like to clear and prime it with honey as was suggested
around these parts some time ago.  I hope this will give my house mates and I
a nice clear sparkling cider, ON TAP!
        Anyways, -on to the "Quick" question, It's one of procedure.  I have
6.5 gals and I plan to rack about 1L off and boil it with pure honey, let  cool
to just under boiling and mix it back into the cider bulk.  Then I will fill
the SS keg and the remainder will be bottled.  Was it ever decided in the
previous honey thread, how much honey would be needed to carbonate 6.5 gal of
sparkling cider? what temp to allow it to cool to?
        Any comments would be appreciated, Thanks,
                                      Wayde. 9106857@SSCvax.CIS.McMaster.CA
