Hello all of you,


I am looking for information on what the perceived sweetness (compared to
sucrose) is for some products which are present in wine/cider (and perhaps also
in beers). I am thinking of products like: 
 - alcohol (in the range of 4 to 15 % vol.) 
 - glycerol (in the range of 0 - 20 gr/litre)


I have some ideas about the sweetness of other products (like glucose, lactose a
nd
maltose). Perhaps other people have even more information on other products (not
mentioned).


Because sweetness is not a linair scale, I have putten some info of the
concentrations of the products. So if there is some info about this non-linair
process, I am also very interested.


Hope somebody can help or point me to some articles/papers.




All the best,




Victor
