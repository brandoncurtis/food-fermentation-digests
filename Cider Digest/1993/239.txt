Greetings!


My first cider is happily working away.  I decided to do the first one very
simply, and just used some organic apple cider with some re-hydrated Red Star
Champagne yeast.  No heating or other preparation of the juice.


It has been two weeks now, and it is still chugging away.  Time to start
thinking about the next step.  What is eveyones favorite methode for priming
a cider.  I wish to make it sparkling.  I plan to bottle in champagne
bottles except for one bottle which will be a plastic bottle, in order to
keep an eye on carbonation.  Corn sugar?  DME?  Apple juice?  How much, about
1/4 cup per gallon?  (I am doing a gallon)


Also, how long do you generally let it age after bottling?  Inquiring minds
want to know!

Subject: Stopping Fermentation


On the latest batch of hard cider I've made, I decided to pull a gallon
or two off the fermenter, and stop it where it was, since my wife likes
it sweeter than tart. So I added potassium sorbate, at the rate specified
on the package. It was a 1/2 oz. package and was stated to be enough for
10 gallons. So for each gallon I added a tenth of that amount, or 1.4 grams.
Given that 1 gallon of water weighs 8.33 lbs., this would be a solution 
(by weight) of 1.4 / (8.33 * 454), or 370 ppm. Does that sound about right?


Well, a week after adding that, the cider's still fermenting happily away!
Anyone know what I've done wrong?
