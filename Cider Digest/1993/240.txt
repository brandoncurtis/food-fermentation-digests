Congrats on your first cider.  I've only made one cider and I used Red Star
Wine yeast (sumpthin' or 'nother de Mousse).  I used 4 gallons of cider right
from the orchard and added 1 pound of corn sugar per gallon (I was hoping the
yeast would poop out and leave me with a sweet cider - wrong).

I racked the cider into 12 oz beer bottles.  Some I primed with 1 teaspoon
table sugar - others I didn't.  After several weeks all were sparkling, some
more than others.  :-)  The non-primed ones have very very little CO2.

I drank most of my batch over the last year - I had about 2 six packs left and
wanted to let a Christmas guest try it - boy, it was great!  I was bummed that
I hadn't saved more.  Sample some, but make sure that some survive over a year.
The wait is worth it!

Dave added potassium sorbate to stop a fermentation and produce a
sweeter cider.  It is my understanding that p.s. will not stop an active
fermentation, only prevent a new one from starting.  To use p.s you must
let the fermentation complete itself, then add p.s. and your sweetener.
Thus the product remains sweet since a new fermentation cannot start
with p.s..  I cannot speak from experience but this is what I have read
in books and on the net.

Hello all,
        I'm not very experienced (only about 10 gals of cider so far) but the 
info I've gotten (from my local brewing store and _The Art of Making Wine_)
is that potassium sorbate is only good for preventing fermentation from
restarting (ie. if you're sweeting a wine/cider after it's finished fermenting).
It will not stop a fermentation that is currently active.  I believe _The Art
of Making Wine_ says the only way to stop an active ferment is via 
pasteurization (sp?) (terrible way for those poor little yeasties to die 
wouldn't you say?).  Hope this helps (and is correct, anyone?).
