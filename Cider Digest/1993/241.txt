Subject: Re: Stopping Fermentation


Well, thanks to Alan and Corby for the advice on potassium sorbate. Would
then one of the sulfites used for purifying the cider prior to fermentation
be appropriate also for stopping the ferment? Potassium metabisulfite is
what I've used, at between 35 and 70 ppm, to initially sterilize the apple
juice.


Question #2. Does anyone know what strength solution one should use
potassium sorbate at? And, for a parts-per-million concentration, is that
by weight, volume, what? Inquiring Minds want to know!
