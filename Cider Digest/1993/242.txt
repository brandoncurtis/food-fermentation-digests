Corby - another thing you might want to try is adding a high alcohol
spirit such as vodka.  If you get the percentage up, the yeast will be
unable to reactivate.


I had to do something similar a while back to prevent an infection.  I had
four gallons of cider (Epernay yeast) sitting in a carboy with a blowoff
tube in the basement.  Well, one night the basement got _really_ cold and
I hadn't yet insulated. So the water in the blowoff container, which had
some mold on the sides of the container, got sucked into the cider.


I took about 150 mls of vodka and added it to the cider to prevent anything
from taking hold.  I think it worked 'cause I just bottled it and
I didn't notice any off flavors (tastes a little green though).  At least
it was done fermenting pretty much when the water got sucked in.


Cheers,
