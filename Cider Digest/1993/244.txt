Mark Taratoot asks a few questions.  I hope my musings are worthy
of the digest; I'm never sure when to leave it to e-mail...


CYSER: I made a cyser with 1 galllon natural cider and 1 pound honey.
Like mead, I expect it will take a long time to round out, but I
have high hopes.  OG 1082, racking gravity 1002, topped up with
10 oz. honey must at 1040 (effective OG is thus 1085).  Bottled
last night: FG 1000.  It's very tart and has some astringency.
I expect the apple and wildflower tones to improve with aging.
I used no acid blend or nutrient.


NUTRIENT: I went on record (on the HBD) promoting the use of nutrient
in cider.  I still think it's a good idea when using filtered cider
from the supermarket.  I did a controlled experiment, with and without
nutrient, using supermarket cider, and the nutrient batch fermented
quicker and drier.  The same was true for a batch with potasssium
sorbate (although attenuation was low in both cases).  My impression
now, having made more batches, is that natural unfiltered cider needs
no nutrient whatsoever.


ACID: Acid blend, insufficent tartness?  I guess it depends on your
taste and the cider you begin with.  I've found I get too much
tartness, if anything.


QUESTIONS: Does anyone know if commercial ciders such as Woodpecker
use yeasts with low attenuation, or do they stop the fermentation
artificially?  Does anyone have a good system for stopping
fermentation early for a sweeter cider?  I have had no luck using
low attenuation ale yeasts (e.g. Wyeast Irish) or adding extra
fermentables.  Good natural cider always seems to end up near
1000, no matter what.


Cheers,
