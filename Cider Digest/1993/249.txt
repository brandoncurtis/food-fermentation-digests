Hi All,


     Just this weekend, I got a chance to try my first cider.  It was called 
Woodpecker.  Anyway, how does this cider compare with ciders that you can brew
yourself ?  It seemed kind of watery and had a hint of "rotten apple" flavor.
I understand that that "rotten apple" flavor was just the apple fermentation,
but is that it ?  I kind of expected something a bit more pleasant.
