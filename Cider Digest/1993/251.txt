     Huh?  I think Woodpeckers is a somewhat different sweet cider but
very good just the same.  If I could make a sweet cider like Woodpeckers,
I'd be real happy.


    One must remember that bottled beverages that come from far, far away
suffer monstrously from time and temperature.  I don't know what the
supplies are like elsewhere but here in the Chicago area it's quite
fresh.  I've even had it on draft in a number of places.

I now have my second batch brewing. My first batch was really great
stuff. I used a formula someone posted here, with a twist. I bought
a gallon of grocery store cider, no preservatives, removed 12 oz. of
it and added a can of Treetop frozen concentrate. (Couldn't find the
Granny Smith stuff.) I added a package of Whitbread Ale yeast, shook
it up real good, and let it ferment like crazy.  After 6 weeks or so,
I added some gelatin finings.


Then I mixed it 
with another gallon of fresh cider I squeezed from my own 
apples (a wonderful tasting blend of 80% yellow delicious, 10% red
delicious, and 10% slightly green Mcintosh - for people squeezing 
their own, this blend is the best cider I've ever tasted). Then I 
bottled it in Grolsch bottles.  Two weeks later I opened a bottle 
and half of it gushed out - too much carbonation and too yeasty tasting.
So I poured/gushed it all out into 2 gallon jugs, added some finings and 
fermentation locks, and racked it off a couple of days later into Grolsch
bottles. Ended up with about 14 pints. I refrigerated it for a week 
and took it to my sister's at Thanksgiving, where it disappeared in
two hours - it was very nicely carbonated but not gushing out. 
Everybody loved it - it Was delicious if I do say so myself.
Sort of like an apple flavored champaign. Not real sweet, not real dry.


By cutting it 1:1 with fresh cider, the alcohol content was probably
only slightly higher than beer.




This batch I'm starting out with my home-squeezed cider, using much
less yeast. After the stuff has cleared, I will prime it with
apple juice concentrate. Haven't figured out how much yet, but the
last batch was too carbonated (unless you want to refrigerate it
and drink it within a week.) I'll bottle it in Grolsch bottles.


A few weeks after bottling it's ready to drink.

As I recall, Taunton (gigantic English cider company)
has at least three brands: Woodpecker, Strongbow, and 
Blackthorn, which are described respectively as sweet, 
medium dry, and dry.


It seems to be easier to find Woodpecker and Blackthorn
in this country--I've rarely if ever seen Strongbow on
sale in this country.
