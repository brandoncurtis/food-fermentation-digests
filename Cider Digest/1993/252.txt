   arthur says he's seen Woodpecker and Blackthorn, but rarely strongbow.
   Around here (Boston), I see Woodpecker often and Strongbow fairly often,
but I've never seen Blackthorn (no, I haven't searched extensively for it).
   Marketing. Purchasing. Go figure....


   I have three batches of Correnty's Special Blend getting very close to
bottling. Two were raised to ~1.070 SG (one sugar, one mixed sugar and
Granny Smith juice concentrate) and have been clear for some weeks; the
other got ~.5# dry malt extract (simmered in CSB to dissolve) and is still
hazy. I know some of you use DME to ensure some residual sugar; have any
of you had clarity problems? Has it made any difference to the taste? (I
haven't tried tasting any of these yet, but I figure the taste now will
only approximate the taste after several months' bottle aging anyway....)
