My use of DME was always in the manner which Arthur suggests,
i.e. boil the DME down in water, then add the fridge temp cider
to the DME.


I used 2.5 gallons cider to 1 gallon water with 1lb DME in it
last year and the year before.


Due to comments about the malty flavors from one or two frequent
guests I chose a different approach for the draft this year,
which was to boil down 2 gallons of cider to 1 qt volume
and add that into 2.75 gallons. Theoretically this boiled 
portion would have had pectin haze, but in fact I encountered
no haze with this approach, just lucky I guess, though long periods of
cold conditioning may have some effect.

Yesterday I wrote:
        The guy at the wine-making supply recommended throwing in a little
        pectin extract.  When should I do this?  And why?


               ^^^^^^^  I meant enzyme.  (Is this make the cider clear?)


Whoops.

Subject: Cider Availability, Correnty Blend


Another cider available here in the NorthEast is called Merrydown.
I find it quite enjoyable.


I racked the first of two 5 gallon batches of this years "Correnty Blend".
Yum, yum, yum.  Thanks Paul!  This was a cyser made with Montrachet wine
yeast.  Very attenuative (OG ~1.112, FG 1.003, 14% v/v).  Still hazy though.


Tonight I'll rack the other batch, I can't wait, yum, yum, yum. :-)


Cheers!
