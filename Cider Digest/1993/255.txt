Can someone post a formula for figuring out the alcohol content
based on the specific gravity of a gallon of cider. I want to know
if this cider I'm brewing is gonna float like a butterfly or sting 
like a bee. Thanks.

Greetings all,


        I have 3 gals of cider sitting in 1 gal jugs at home (it was originally
8 gals back in December but that stuff just tastes too good heated up with a 
little brown sugar and cinnamon and 5 gals got drunk before they could be 
bottled :-).  At any rate I would like to bottle up what's left with a little 
sugar in hopes of getting a sparkling cider.  Fine, so here's my question:


        They've been sitting in the gallon jugs for about 2 months now; is
        there likely to be enough viable yeast still in suspension to produce
        carbonation or should I add more yeast when I bottle them up?




               Salute!
