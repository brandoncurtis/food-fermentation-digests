I *finally* performed the first racking of one of my ciders.  It  a basic 
still cider (taken up to ~1.075 with a mixture of white sugar + 
Succanat, sulfited, and fermented with an English ale yeast culture).  
The juice source was the 1992 version of Paul Correnty's special pressing 
that many of us bought from Anderson's Orchards in Westford, MA last fall.  
I also added about 8 oz of organic raisins  two months ago.  It has been 
slowly fermenting in my cool basement all fall and winter.


The cider recently cleared;  at racking the OG was 1.003.  Paul - it tastes 
wonderful!  There is a lucious apple character to this cider in both the nose 
and flavor, more so than I recall from the 1991 version. There is also an 
appropriate sweetness and, of course, noticeable alcohol. I'll bottle it in a 
month or so, but I recall that you did some experiments with letting the cider 
sit on oak last year that added some complexity to the final product.  Would 
you care to elaborate on your procedure, or is it a Correnty family secret?


Still to rack:  the same cider, prepared in the same way to the same OG, but 
not sulfited ----> fermented with the natural apple yeast.  Paul, do you 
suggest that I stopper this up after racking to encourage a malo-lactic 
ferment?  Any other ideas?  I still remember your wonderful NE barrel cider 
from last year!
