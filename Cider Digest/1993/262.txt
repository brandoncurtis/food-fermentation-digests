Cider Fermenters,
I have read several posts that mention "Correnty's Blend." What exactly
makes this blend of apples so special?


I fortified 3 gallons of Carlson's Orchard (Harvard, MA) apple cider with
about 3 cups of corn sugar and pitched some Whitbred yeast. It has finally
cleared this week after about 2 months of fermentation/clearing, 6 weeks of
which have been in a secondary. Those of you who live in this area may know
of Carlson's cider; any ideas on how this (my first) cider will turn out?
How will it differ from a "Correnty Blend" cider? In general and for the
benefit of readers in other parts of the world, are there certain types of
apples which should be avoided/sought out for fermentation?


Lastly, I infer from Steve Stroud's post yesterday that Paul Correnty 
is on this list. Will you be pressing another "Special Blend" next fall?


Thanks for any advice you may be able to share,
Eric

Subject: Acidity adjustment


This year's batch of cider was tested for the first time last night.
Unlike previous years, where there was quite a pronounced acidity,
this cider is smooth, but perhaps just a bit too smooth.  I would
appreciate suggestions about how to go about adding just a hint
more acid, how much or how to calculate how much etc.


BTW, this one was done using an ale yeast, Wyeast 1028, which is
supposedly "less attenuative".  However, it went quite nicely
from OG 1.040 to SG 0.996 at a cellar temp of 12C.  Still, the overall
effect is more balanced than when I used Lalvin wine yeasts in
previous years, although as I said, less acidic too.


Cheers, P.
