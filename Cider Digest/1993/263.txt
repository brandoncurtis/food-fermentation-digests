OK, I've been reading about Correnty's Magical Blend since I've
been reading the Cider Digest.  I live in Washington.  Sure, we
grow a lot of apples here (actually in Eastern Washingon, and
I live on the West side), but I can't seem to get any magical
blends.  To make matters worse, I don't own a press (or have
access to one), so even though I might read about interesting
blends in places like Zymurgy (summer '92 I believe), I can't
do anything about it.


Last year, on the way back from skiing, I found a roadside stand
where someone was selling some freshly pressed (same day) cider
alledgely made entirely from Johanagolds.  It made a pretty good
cider, so of course I kept my eyes open each weekend on the way
back from skiing this year.  No cider!


Finally, last week, I tracked down the local cider mill that
supplies all of the Seattle area stores.  What they're turning
out now is 40% red delicious 40% golden delicious and 20%
Granny Smith.  It doesn't taste bad, but how are we supposed
to turn out an outstanding cider without magical blends?  Does
anybody ship magical blends?  Does anybody know where I can get
good blends locally?


Thanks for any suggestions.
