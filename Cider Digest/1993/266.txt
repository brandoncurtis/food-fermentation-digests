A question about using gelatin for fining:


I've rarely used gelatin (don't normally need it in my beer making)
but have recently found it necessary for a couple of meads and some
ciders.  In one mead, it worked well, and in another, it did not
seem to make any difference.  My main concern is about a Perry I
tried to use it in.  The Perry has been persistently cloudy for
months despite a number of rackings (the must was pasturized, I
figured I'd try gelatin before pectin enzyme).  Recently, I racked
it, and then topped up the jugs with gelatin solution (as per
directions).  After a couple of weeks, the bottom halfs of the jugs
are full of a fluffy, easily disturbed precipitate, and the upper
halfs are reasonably clear.  Unless this precipitates settles more,
I won't be able to rack the perry further.  A couple of ciders that
were sulphited rather than pasturized have produced similar precipitates
*without* the addition of gelatin.  Do I simply have to be patient
and wait for this sediment to compact?  Is something very wrong?
Cheers,
Rick C.
