While I have little cidermaking done recently, I have been quite involved
with ordering and preparing to plant apple trees.  I want to put in a very
good word for the folks at Miller's Nurseries in upstate NY, who seem to
keep in stock a wide variety of obscure and seldom-seen apple trees.  I
called them up asking about Cox's Orange Pippins, and not only did they
actually know about them but they offered to send me one. 


Can anyone here put in some pointers to a beginning apple grower?  This
is the first time I have ever put apples in, although as a child I grew
up with relatives who had quite a sizeable orchard.
