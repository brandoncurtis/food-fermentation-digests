My first cider batch of the year...


        6 1/2 gal fresh apple juice (Twin Hill Farms, Sebastopol)
        Light Malt Extract
        Pumpkin Pie Spice
        Grape Tannin
        Wyeast Pasteur Champagne Yeast.


        10/13/92              Pitched yeast; OG 1.066
        11/21/92              Racked; IG 1.010.  Acidy, some phenol.
        3/2/93               Racked and spiced with tea made from 1 t.
                             pumpkin pie spice in 1 c. water.  Acid and
                             phenols in pre-spiced cider mellowed greatly.
                             IG 1.000.
        3/14/93                      Added tannin tea (1/4 c. of 1 t. grape tann
in
                             in 1 c. boiling water), primed, and bottled.
                             FG 1.000.  The spice flavors from the tea were
                             barely discernable, and did not cover the apple
                             flavors.


I didn't cook the malt before adding, so the cider is a slightly cloudy golden
color.  Still, my best cider to date.  Pity the two cases are already spoken
for... ;-)


Prost!
