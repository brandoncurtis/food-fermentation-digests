Subject: Bottling gravity and yeast slurry

Couple of things I've always wondered about:


I just racked my 7 gallons of Correnty-II blend (the one with the Russets in
it) and it is slow to ferment out. It is only down to 1.012. Since I want it
to sparkle anyway, can I just bottle it? What's the highest gravity you can
safely bottle without fear of a cider bomb?


Also, does it make sense to save cider yeast slurry? I have access to people
who can professionally isolate and freeze yeast (thanks, Seth!) and I really
like the results of the natural apple yeasts. I've never made cider with
anything but the yeast in the fruit and from the raisins I add. Is there any
point in saving last year's yeast? I also have the slurry from the Correnty-I
blend.


Opinions, please. Especially you, Paul.
