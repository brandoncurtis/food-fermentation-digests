Dear Homebrewers:


Having once lived in the south of England and fell in love with English 
cider (hard cider), I want to find out if anyone else out there has 
tried to brew their own.  I'm looking for good recipes for "dry" 
English-style cider, not the sweet overly-carbonated [I think] stuff 
like the Vermont Woodchuck cider.  So, if anyone is interested in the 
idea, I can offer a few suggestions, but so far I have stuck to brewing 
from a Boots Country Cider kit -- which is very good, by the way, but 
only available in England.  Please send any info to me at 
BCULLIN@auvm.american.edu.  Thanks.  Bridget
