Have any of the digest readers ever attempted to make Birch Beer?
I would like to try, and have a few questions:


  - what time of year do you tap the tree ?


  - how long can you tap for without harming the tree ?


  - what should the starting gravity be (I am assuming you boil the sap
    to increase the gravity).


  - is sugar or honey added ?  How much (I know this is related to the
    specific gravity question)?


  - type of yeast ?  


  - add yeast nutrients ?


  - should I do anything to the tree before plugging the tap hole ?


  - should I add the green, flavorful "stuff" which is under the top layer
    of bark?




Thank you.
