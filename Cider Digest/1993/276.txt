GOAL:
To make a Hard Cider?


PLAN:
I made a 1 quart yeast starter from Wyeast #2112, a California Steam Beer
Lager Yeast (that ferments well up to 62^F).
I added the starter to 3/4 gallon of Apple Cider, affixed an airlock, and
it's now fermenting in my basement (at 60^F).


QUESTIONS:
1) How long should I excpect the fermentation process to last?
2) What would an ideal fermenting temp. be for such a concoction?
3) Is my result going to be a Hard Cider, or a (strange) Lager Beer?
4) I plan on conditioning the fermented result with either 1/6 cup of Corn
   Sugar, or 1 to 2 cups of Apple Cider - and then bottle it.  First of all,
   is it necessary to do this conditioning?  If it is, what ingredient is best,
   and how much should I use (for a 1 gallon batch)?
5) How long will such a (lager) cider last in bottled form?
6) Should I have submitted this query to rec.crafts.pyrotechnics?
