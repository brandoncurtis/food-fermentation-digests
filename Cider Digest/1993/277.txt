So, this year I scale up my production, and for the first time
I run into a problem.


I have 10 gal. of cider in my cellar, which was made from the same
sweet cider feedstock I have used for the past two years.  I did
not attempt to sterilize it, but pitched Wyeast 1028 to it, and
fermented at 15C since last November.  In previous years I have
used dry wine or champagne yeasts.


The problem:  Despite fining with Polyclar, the cider is still
very cloudy.  I have used pectic enzyme in three separate doses
and it has produced precipitate, but the cloudiness persists.
Also, there is a thin white film over the top of the liquid.
There are no detectable off tastes (yet).


Any diagnosis?  And, more important, any guidance?  RSVP by email. P.
