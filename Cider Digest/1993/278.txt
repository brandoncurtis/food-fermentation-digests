Funny, my cider also has this.  Since this is the first time I've
tried making cider I didn't know if it was normal or not.  I've just
been ignoring it, and figured I'd syphon carefully to not get the
floating "scum".  It was fermented with the wild yeast (i.e. just pour
"President's Choice" (tm) "cider" into a sanitized jug and add an air
lock).  The apple flavour is very strong with a bit of residual
sweetness.  The alcohol content is about 3% (I think).  


FWIW, my cyser (apple-mead) never developed a scum.  Sure tastes good
too! (No joke: I've been offered ridiculously large sums of money to
part with bottles of the stuff.  If it were legal I could make a tidy
bit of money on the side making and selling cyser.)

Subject: Cider Receipe Request


This is my first post and I have only been a member for the past week.
So I was hoping someone could help me out with any cider receipies they might
have using unfermented cider, apple juice or even apples. E-Mail would be
appreciated.
