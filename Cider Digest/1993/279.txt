Greetings.


I have read of something called "Flowers of Wine" that
are supposed to look like a fine white powdery-ish
layer floating on top of the fermenting must.  It 
metabolises alcohol into carbon dioxide and water.  I am
not sure if this is what is floating on your cider.  
I have 5 gal of Cyser that had a fine layer similar to
the one that you describe.  But there is still alcohol
in it (so far).  I am not worried about it.

Hello Fellow Cider Fanantics!


I have just subscribed to this and so am apologizing in advance for any
erronious information I have asked for that many others have before:


What I'm looking for is an easy recipe for a fairly dry or tart cider with
some carbonation [but not like champagne] which doesn't have to ferment for
months [i.e. one that is finished fermenting in about a week], and which you
don't have to wait for it to condition in the bottles [or kegs] for months and
months to make it drinkable. Can anyone help me out? I'm not above using kits
if they work quickly and don't taste heinous.


Also, I only recently got e-mail and I cannot for the life of me figure out
how to access ftp. I want to look at old issues of Cider Digest, so I won't
have to bore anyone in the future, but I can only seem to get to the list, but
not able to open them to read them.  Help, please.


Any suggestions, etc can be mailed to me at BCULLIN@auvm.american.edu




Thanks, Bridget
