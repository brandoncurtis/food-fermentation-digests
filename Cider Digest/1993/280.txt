Subject: Making my own cider?

Greetings!


I'd like to start dabbling in hard cider making.  I've made lots of beer,
some mead, and some wine, so cider seems like a natural combination of
all of the above.


I live out in the "middle of nowhere", so I have access to fresh apples (in
season, 'nach), and I've seen in the "welcome" file which varieties of
apples to use for various flavorings.  My question is this:


How can I juice apples myself, without getting a pectin haze in the final
result?  (I assume this would be a possible problem)?  The orchard that is
closest to me refuses to sell "un-stabilized" cider.  For grins, I dumped
a packet of (rehydrated) ale yeast in a gallon of their cider and yes,
it in fact does kill the yeast.  (I needed to use up the last of my
dry yeast anyway, and I'd rather do that on one gallon of apple cider than
on a batch of beer!)


So, what equipment should I get for juicing the apples?  Is there an antique
tool to do this (preferable), or a modern one?  How active is this list?


Thanks for any info,
