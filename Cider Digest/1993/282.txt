I am surprised that you find this works. The usual preservative in cider
around Boston is potassium sorbate; I don't know what its boiling point is
but it certainly isn't driven off by boiling the cider it's in. (I expect
that it would decompose, rather than boil, if you got it hot enough.)


Potassium sorbate, if used, must be listed on the label. I suppose you
could find sulfited cider, in which the preservative might evaporate
(as the results of Camden tablets do) if left out. But I don't recall
seeing such in this area....

Subject: Using a Juicer


Well, this is my first posting to this forum. It should be a simple one
for all the cider pros. I received a 'juicer' (one of those trendy
electric shredder/centrifuge machines) for xmas and have been using it
quite regularily. I find that it makes short work of apples and produces
excellent apple juice. Can I use my juicer to prepare fresh apple juice
for cider making? If so, should the apples be fairly fresh and hard or
should I let them soften (or freeze-thaw them) prior to making the juice?
Finally, would pectinase be of any value after using a juicer to prepare
my cider or is it generally more desirable in pulpy juice from a press?


note: the apple juice from a juicer is very clear once it settles and
      doesn't develop a haze when chilled.


Thanx all and take care.

Not very, I am afraid. Let's change that! :-)


For starters, I am a moderately experienced beer brewer who fell in love
with cyder whilst on an extended working stay in England. I have found no
good sources of hard cider in the States, thus I've made my own on two
occassions (5 gallons each time). These two experiences were definitely
hit-or-miss, but none the less encouraging! 


I've got several books that address the subject of cider/hard cider:


The Good Cider Guide: Traditional Farmhouse scrumpy
by David Kitton (Alma Books/Campaign for Real Ale 1987)


Making Cider
by Jo Deal (Argus Books revised 1985)


Making the Best Apple Cider
Garden Way Bulletin A-47 (Garden Way, 1980)


Tritton's Guide to Better Wine & Beer Making for the Beginners
by S.M. Tritton (Faber reprint 1973)




I've got several ideas for extended cyder discussions (threads):


+ Historical background/stories
+ "cyder" versus "cider" versus "scrumpy" (whaddayacallit?)
+ sources of apples/trees (especially the antique/historical varieties)
+ books/magazines/other publications dealing with cider making/hard cider
+ sources of equipment
+ equipment modification, etc.
+ survey of commercial hard ciders available in North America
+ hard cider recipes
+ food recipes calling for hard cider


SO LET'S GET THIS LIST FERMENTING!!!
