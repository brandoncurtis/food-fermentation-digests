I have been expermenting with making a couple of batches of hard
cider and have found it very fun.  My first batch, 1 gallon, I
added blueberries to, about 1 pound, and it turned out great.
The only problem was that I wanted to drink most of it before I
bottled it!  I ended up with only 2 champaign bottles from that
batch!  However, my next batch I only used cider.  I added some
honey and brown sugar and let it ferment.  Both of these batches
seem to have finished fermenting in about 1.5-2 weeks.  Is that
normal? Or should it take longer?


I have also started a batch using a port wine yeast.  I am going
to attempt to make some apple jack from this.  I have heard of
the "freezing method" and was wondering if any of you out there
knew of a good way to extract the ice crystals.  I have heard
that a salad spinner can be used, but I really don't want to buy
one just for apple jack.
