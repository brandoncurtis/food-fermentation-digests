I can't speak for Jay, but I don't know if it is exactly polite to
use his mailing list to speak about making an illegal substance.  "Apple
Jack" is something that falls under the Bureau of Firearms and Tobacco
'cause it's not something you just ferment.  It's closer to distilling
in their eyes.


You may want to keep that in mind before you actually try making any.

I made apple jack by accident when I set the temp. of my beer bar wrong.
the funny thing was I did not know that was what I was drinking. Till 
the keg of hard cider we were drinking ran out . I said wait a minute 
that was 5 gal of hard cider
I can't be out all ready when I pick up the keg there was a soled block 
of ice frozen
in the keg. But still that was the best cider I ever had.....
