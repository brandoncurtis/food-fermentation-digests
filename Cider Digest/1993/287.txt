Hi:


I am just about to bottle my first cider.  Does anyone know if it
is OK to re-pitch the yeast sediment at the bottom of the secondary
into another batch?


The yeast I used was a Vierka wine yeast.  I let it ferment
for a week before I racked it to the secondary where it has been sitting
for about ten weeks or so.  It is now clear, though not quite
crystal.


I will post the recipe if it turns out well.


Thanks in advance.


Paul Anderson.
