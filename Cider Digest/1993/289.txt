Howdy,
        Recently I decided to buy several 2 liter glass bottles full of Apple 
Juice, and make them into cider. So far, I have only made one bottle, and it
seems to have turned out quite well. I emptied a little juice to make room for
the honey, and being stupid as we all are whilst making things for the first
timel, I did not measure the honey. All the same, it got to the stage that 
it became very difficult to dissolve the honey in the slightly cold juice.
After this was done I added a Vierka lagar yeast and continued the fermentation
in a fridge at 16 degrees. Overall, I have made a few mistakes. It tastes quite
nice, but rubbery! Not sure why, but I did have a rubber stopper attached to
the top. I should have racked it off the yeast sediment earlier, but it has
cleared quite well. It has now fully fermented, and is sitting in the pantry
at about 24 degrees celcius whilst I wait for a friend to return my bottle
capper. One question remains, to carbonate or not to carbonate !!!!!


PS : I would just like to comment on the excellent quality of talk in
this mail list. I hope Cider/Cyser making will become more popular.
