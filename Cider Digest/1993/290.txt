Hello all!


I just finished my 1st attempt at an "all homemade" cider [i.e. not from a kit]
Here's the basic recipe (from memory):


4 gallons unpreserved store-bought cider
1 quart "Oregonberry" juice
1 can treetop frozen apple juice concentrate
3 cups cane sugar
1 lb honey
camdem tablets - crushed
champagne yeast


It fermented for about 9 days - original gravity 1.052. I then racked it into
the secondary and added 12 oz frozen rasberries which I thawed and pureed. I
also added some pectin enzyme for clearing.


For bottling, I used 1 can frozen seneca granny smith concentrate and 1/4 cup
corn sugar for conditioning/carbonation. Final gravity = .994


My questions are: what does everyone think?  I had no idea if the concentrate
would be enough for conditioning, but will I have exploding bottles with the
added corn sugar?  Also, how long will it take before it's drinkable? It's
probably wishful thinking, but I had hoped it might be ready within 3 weeks.


Anyway, any suggestions, etc would be appreciated.


Thanks, Bridget
