          Hi Everyone
          
          I couldn't wait for the apples to be ready this year so I went 
          ahead and made a gallon of cider using frozen juice from the 
          local supermarket. It has turned out to be quite good, if 
          somewhat tart. Here's the recipe:
          
          4 tins frozen apple juice concentrate (I used Welch's. It's a 
          Canadian brand and costs about twice what the cheapest brand 
          does, but it's a much better quality juice.)
          
          Complex B vitamin tablet
          Champagne yeast
          Cup cold strong tea (Tetley's) for the tannin
          
          I was a bit worried in case there were preservatives in the 
          concentrate, so I boiled it for about 15 minutes. When it was 
          cool, I topped the concentrate up to about a gallon added about 
          half-a-kilo of inverted white sugar as syrup, the crushed 
          vitamin pill and the tea and sprinkled the yeast on top. It took 
          off after a day or so and fermented down to just below zero. 
          (Sorry, I forgot to record the Original Gravity!) That only took 
          two days - the house is a bit on the warm side this time of year 
          - and I racked it into the secondary for a month. It is crystal 
          clear and I have bottled it with about 2tbs invert white sugar. 
          I had removed about a wineglass worth before priming and it 
          tasted tart but clean and very appley (is that a word?) Can't 
          wait till it gets a bit fizzy.
          
          Who else is at it? Or are you all waiting for the fall and the 
          new (cheap) apples?
