Howdy y'all!


        Well, I am working on my first cider as well and it seems to have
just finished fermenting.  There is only one problem:  it is *way* too tart!
I was hoping for a nice, wonderful, sweet cider on the order of Woodpecker,
but this stuff is like biting into a granny smith (not that I don't enjoy
that, but I wanted something sweeter).  Any advice from you net.wisdom people
out there as to how I can give it some sweetness?  I plan to rack it over to
another carboy and let it clear before bottling.  I also would like to prime
with some corn sugar or brown sugar to insure that it has some fizz.


Eagerly anticipating your replies ...

Oh yeah, um, what I say is my opinion, um, what I think are my own ideas, uh,
Allen-Bradley has nothing to do with them, uh, yeah.  That's about it.
