The following recipe was posted to "rec.crafts.brewing":


        Buy a gallon of apple juice.
        Drink a few glasses to make room.
        Add 2 lb sugar and yeast, let ferment to completeion.
        Prime and bottle as if it was beer.
        After it clears in about a month, you will have some good apple "champag
ne"




I was looking for comments/suggestions of this recipe.
In particular, what type of "sugar" should one add to the cider?


Thanks in advance.
