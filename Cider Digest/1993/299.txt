Well, I can't smell and taste your cider to know for sure, but I had a
similar experience with my first batch. I used honey, brown sugar and
spices and it took a LONG time to finish fermenting. When it did
finish, it smelled like weak vinegar and tasted sour. I thought it had
gone bad, but figured "what the heck" and I bottled six 12oz bottles
worth (I threw the rest away). I tasted it about a year later, and it
was delicious! Kind of like a dry white wine with the aroma of apples, 
honey and spice. I kicked myself for throwing the rest away!


So, unless it's REALLY off, I'd suggest bottling it and waiting for
six months to a year. (Then if it IS vinegar, have a huge salad party
or make vast quantities of pickles!)


Good luck,
AD

Well, if it's truely vinegar then there's not much to do other than open a
pickle factory. However, I have had batches of cider in the past which
tasted pretty darn awful within the first month or two and then six to
eight months later they tasted super. What kind of sterilization did you
use?
