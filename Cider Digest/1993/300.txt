Regarding the notes on sour cider, my first batch of cider was 3 gallons
of apple juice and 2 gallons of pear juice. When it went into the bottle
it was pretty horrid stuff. It tasted sharp and with a strong finishing
flavour of rubber. Now 8 months later it is not so bad. Really rather
 drinkable. I would agree with the advice of the others who have posted
and let the cider mellow out the time.
