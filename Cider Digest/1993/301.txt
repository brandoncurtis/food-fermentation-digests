          Here's another tip for sour cider.
          
          Try adding a tablespoonful of fruit-flavoured pancake syrup to 
          the glass before you pour. No kidding, it gets a slight haze but 
          nothing a frosty glass won't disguise. And you won't have to go 
          through the heartbreak of dumping it all down the drain. My 
          favourite is peach!
          
          The syrup contains potassium sorbate so it's no good for 
          bottling as it would inhibit the yeast and therefore the 
          production of CO2.
