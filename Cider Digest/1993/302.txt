Another tip for sour cider:


Sometimes my New England Barrel Cider comes out too tart for some people's
tastes. So I occasionally doctor a few bottles as follows. Open the
fermented cider (carefully, if it's sparkling). Drop in a single clove and
about 1/4 to 1/2 inch cinnamon stick and four saccharin tablets, then recap.
That's right, saccharin tablets. Before any of you purists get on my case, I
would rather adulterate my cider with saccharin than use a poison to stop the
fermentation. At any rate, the cider is sweetened and the sweetener does not
ferment. And the spices are delicious. The above quantities are for a 750cc
champagne bottle so adjust as necessary. Two weeks is enough time for the
spices to take efect. This is so popular that next year I will spice a
number of bottles at bottling time and sweeten to taste.
