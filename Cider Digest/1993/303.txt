I am curious to know from the readers of this list what varieties
or blends of apple varieties you have had the greatest success with in
making cider.


Has anyone tried crab apples?


Lastly, does anyone know where to get apples or juice from the tannin
rich cider apples such as Foxwhelp, Bloody Butcher, Court Royal,
Sweet Coppin, Tremlett's Bitter or Brown's Apple??




Thanks

        Hurm? What poison?


        I doubt if anything used to stop fermentation, in reasonable
concentrations, is any more (or less) dangerous than saccharin.
