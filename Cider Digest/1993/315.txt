The referenced mail message was received by "duncan", a user who is 
no longer with the company and for whom we have no forwarding address, 
which means there is no one there to read your mail!  This mail appears 
to have been directed to the following address(es): 


    BOGUS


Please verify that you actually mailed the person whom you were
intending to mail.  If you mailed a group alias, you should contact 
that alias's owner and explain to them that the alias contains an
ex-employee.  If you have further questions, please address them 
to notes problems.

my apologies for the repeated messages from this source.
internet mail hasd a convention called envelope reply address
it is the address to which error messages of the type are supposed to 
go to. Every once in a while I run into a system which does not
implement this convention and sends to the digest reply-to address
causing error messages ot show up in the list. 


having had many business dealings with convex I know that their mailing 
list administration is not to be envied. I have sent the postmast mail
and hopefully this will stop soon. Sorry for the bother, and as you might have
guessed I'm back from my trip.
