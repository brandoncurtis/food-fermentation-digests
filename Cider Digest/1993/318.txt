Greetings everyone.  I'm a newbie at the hard cider making and I've
a few questions before I start my first batch:




        I've been looking through a good number of the back issues and
I've seen a lot of references about different types of yeasts being
used to produce different types of ciders (eg, dry vs not-dry, etc).
I get the basic idea of "ale yeasts won't tolerate as much alcohol as
wine yeasts, thus dying off early and leaving a sweeter cider", but
then people start mentioning "Empernay 2" yeast, and few others that
aren't obvious to me.  Could someone give me a quick low-down on the
kinds of yeasts and what each of them do?


        Second, I've read about "blow-off tubes" being used during the
primary fermentation while others simply take a glass or two of soft
cider out of the jug before adding yeast to it.  I've never seen a
blow-off tube before, what does it look like?  How much foam does the
typical primary fermentation cause in a 1-gal jug?  About how much
soft cider should I remove from a 1-gal jug to avoid having to use a
blow-off tube?


        Third, how long does cider remain drinkable after bottling?
Assuming it was fermented with an Ale yeast, would it last a year at
75F?  If it would be easier, how about a Time vs. Proof table or
formula?
