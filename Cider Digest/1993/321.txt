I have seen a deluge of requests to the list submission address
recently, both subscribe and unsubscribe requests.


Folks, please get with the program. Perhaps the internet should establish 
an etiquette test before issuing accounts to people.


As a reminder the convention is that for a list named




        somelist@someaddress


subscription and unsubscribe requests go to


        somelist-request@someaddress


that way the requests go only to the list administrator and the
dozens, hundreds, thousands, or millions of users receving whatever
list you are participating in don'thave to know that Joe Somebody
wants to get off the list.


So please, please, please cooperate. it is enough of a hassle 
to run the list let alone having to get gripes or pointers to 
folks who send requests to the wrong place. Remember I don't 
read the digest regularly, and requests send to the submission
address may not get seen at all. And frankly I am getting tired of 
having to deal with this kind of stuff and have considered nuking
this list completely (it is for some reason the most troublesome of 
the lists I administrate).
