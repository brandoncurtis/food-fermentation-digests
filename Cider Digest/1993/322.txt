While  I  agree  100%  with the  sentiment  expressed by  our esteemed
moderator regarding administrative messages, I  find it poetic justice
that his message appeared twice in the last digest!


                      ;-) ;-) ;-)
                                    reb

To all those who wrote me, thanks. I appreciate your comments.
Hope the worthwhile content of this list will pick up again
now that cider season is just around the corner.


And an administrative warning. Please be aware that we will
be moving our physical location (and electronic address)
in the next few weeks. Expect possible disruption of service, possible
duplicate messages, and other e-mail based glitches while we relocate
hardware, software and network connections. 


For those not already aware the new address (now in effect) are


        cider@x.org                  submissions only
        cider-request@x.org           subscribe/unsubscribe etc 


While the from lines of the messages may not accurately reflect this
address change please be aware that these addresses are working and are the
ones you should be using. Please report nay problems to the request
address.




        Jay
