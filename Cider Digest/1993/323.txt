Greetings all.


        I have been reading rec.crafts.brewing for about a month now and I
have seen references to keeping the wort away from light while it is
fermenting.  In several of my wine books they also mention keeping the
bottled wine away from light to let it age properly (something about the
sun's light killing or changing something in the wine).  I've been keeping
my first batch of cider in a brown paper bag in my pantry and i've been
visiting it every morning and every night to watch the various stages of
fermentation and to make sure it doesn't bubble over.  Although I believe
the amount of light that gets to it is both minimal and not direct sunlight,
I still have my fears for it.  Is sunlight a big problem in cider/wine
making?  Should this be locked up in my dark basement instead?




And speaking of wild yeasts....


Is there anyone else in the Midwest (MN & surrounding states) that has
experience in using the wild yeasts present on the apples to make 
their cider?  Does the cider turn out good or sour or ???
