Subject: Lactic infection in my cider


I pitched a batch of five gallons fred meyer bottled cider plus two cans
granny smith concentrate (seneca, i think) with edme yeast a few weeks ago.
Upon racking to cornelius keg, there appeared in the cider jellylike blobs,
although the cider tasted fine. I avoided racking the blobs, and let it
force carbonate for a week, and have been chilling it for two days. The
cider is maybe a little hazy, and quite sour. It is alcoholic, by human
metabolic test :-P, and the final sg was 1.004. COuld I have the infamous
"rope" that Miller talks about in his beer book? Should I choose to
(over)indulge I would be loath to wake up in the morning with muscles that
feel like I tried a triathalon without training. Please advise.


Thanks,
Bill Newcomb
