I've tried three yeasts: 


        Epernay
        Natural
        Red Star Champagne


Of these, the Epernay is the least impressive (but makes good cider
for non-discriminating visitors).  The natural worked beautifully, and
the Red Star is wonderful.  However, if you use the Red Star Champagne,
then be certain to put in adjuncts.  


Otherwise you get something _very_ dry.

Subject: Mead yeast for cider??


Ladies and Gentlemen,


The topic of yeast has come up lately so I thought I might ask a question
myself.  I have been considering my first batch of the year and have been
considering using a starter of Yeast Labs "Sweet Mead" yeast that I have
sitting quietly in the cellar.


Has anyone tried usinf mead yeast for cider?? Is it recommended??


Thanks in advance for your imput.

Hello cidermakers!


I'm looking for a source of cider presses/grinders--please email me if you
know of one. Also, Ijust have to tell you the name of the pear cider I made
last fall.  It came out wonderfully, made just as you would apple cider. 
Ready?  "Perry Maison."  


Anyone tried to make plum cider?


Thanks!
