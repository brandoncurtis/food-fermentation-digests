   Try the Oak Park Farmers Market on I believe East and Lake.  I know it is


1 or 2 blocks north of the "L" and a few blocks west of Austin, in a big church
parking lot.  There are usually several stands selling cider and some with hone
y but the honey is expensive.  They usually know what type of apples the cider
is from, too.
