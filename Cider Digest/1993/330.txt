        I am interested in getting an apple grinder & press.  I have contacted
a number of places that sell them from the list posted to cider digest sometime
ago.  Prices are generally around $450 which is a bit much for me.
        I would like to know if anybody has built their own grinder and press
and if so, could you please send me some construction plans and comments on
how well your equipment works.
        Thank you very much.
