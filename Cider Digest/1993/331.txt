In #328, dhholscl@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu (David Holsclaw) asks:

This is exactly what I am planning to do soon. I have made two sweet meads
with the YeastLab stuff, and they have both been just that - sweet. Granted,
they both started out around 1120-1140, but finished around 1050. You can
get cavities from drinking it ;->


It's the least attenuative yeast I have ever seen in a mead, so I thought -
hey, great cider yeast ! I will not get to try this for a couple of weeks, but
I will post results. Most of my ciders have been unfortified at the start, and
have finished out MOST dry. Might add a few pounds of honey. Last years cyser
was my best mead/cider ever. Sorry, I should cross-post to mead-lovers.


David, if you or anyone else tries this yeast on cider before I get to (or
has already), I would love to hear results also. 


Cheers,


Mitch
