Subject:      Yeast Survey


Thanks to all those that contributed to my informal cider yeast survey.
The results are as follows:
2 votes wine yeast
6 votes chapagne yeast
2 votes mead yeast
5 votes beer/ale yeasts
1 vote  native yeast


The comments were very consistant. The chapagne yeasts produced a drinkable
product that was invariably too dry. Many brewers added back sugar in one
form or another but the most common was concentrated apple juice. Red Star
chapagne yeast was a popular choice but made a very dry cider which could be
"horrid" if the cider were too acidic.


Favourable comments were recieved for Whitbread Ale and Wyeast Irish
(a Guinness-like stout yeast) yeasts as well as a german wheat beer yeast.
The Wyeast Irish was reported to produce the ever elusive "appley" aroma.
Seria Nevada yeast was also recommended.
One unfavorable report was received regarding Cooper Ale yeast which may have
been responsible for a very nice vinegar.


YeastLab's Sweet Mead yeast is being put to the test as we speak and the one
vote for native yeasts was very favourable. Indeed,the native yeasts were
responsible for a prize winning brew.


Thanks again for everyone's comments.

PS. What's Mother Nature waiting for? Bring on the apples!
