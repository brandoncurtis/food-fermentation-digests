Subject: Where can I find Cider Recipes?


Howdy All,
        Well after my first attempt at cider which flopped, I thought I would
try a simple recipe. I have access to apple juice and a selection of good
yeasts, such as wyeast. One question, how do manage the acidity of the
cider? What acids do I add, and how much?


Regards,
Luke

Is this just a start of season thing, or has anyone else noticed that the
prices of fresh cider seem to be noticeably higher this year?  I've seen it
consistantly now at about the $3/gallon range, which seems about a dollar high
for my area (lots of orchards).


I know it's supposed to be a bad year for apples, but really now.
