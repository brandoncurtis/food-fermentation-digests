Subject: How to make Cidre Doux???


Hello fellow cidermakers,


My name is Michael Niemann and I am new to the cider digest, in fact, I am
new to cider making.  I have been brewing my own beer for three years now
and I am very pleased by the results so far.  So I have some experience in
concocting my own alcoholic beverages.  


Early this summer (too long ago) I had to nice opportunity to visit
Brittany in France again after 15 years.  I fondly remembered both Calvados
and Cidre and my memories were surpassed by the actual tastes I got to
sample.  I wondered why such a tasty beverage like sparkling Cidre Doux was
unavailable in the U.S. given its low alcohol contents and its great apple
aroma.  Being a homebrewer now, I decided to take matters into my own hands
and make my own.  Hence, my subscription to the cider digest.  After
perusing much of the digest archives (by no means al of them), I found that
there was prcecious little information about making that type of cider.  As
a matter of fact, I appeared to me that most people were interested in
boosting their alcohol content.  So, after this longwinding introduction,
here is my question:


Does anyone have information about making Cidre Doux, i.e., a sweet,
sparkeling cider with about 3 - 4% alcohol content??


Any info will be appreciated.

P.S.  I have the info on the Proulx book which I will get.
