Usually, when  you want to make a lower alcohol cider, you use an
ale yeast.  You'll have to go back through the archives and find a 
yeast that people have tried and enjoyed.


My personal experience with making a lower-alcohol (when compared to 
champagne yeast) cider was with using natural yeast.  Apparently,
there is a yeast that grows naturally with apples.  If you crush the
apples, put the juice in a clean carboy and wait, then you'll get 
a natural product that tastes very appley.


Good luck
