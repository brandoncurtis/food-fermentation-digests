In #334, Micheal (michael.niemann@mail.trincoll.edu) asks about cidre
doux.


Michael, I assume your "edu" means you're in the US.  I have recently
had a Norman cidre doux called "Purpom" which is 3.4% alc/vol.  It's
quite doux (sweet) and has a good appley nose.  I don't think it's
easy to get, but I believe it can be ordered by the case in the New
York area.  If you want more info, e-mail me and I'll tey to dig it up.


It is hard to make low-alcohol, sweet cider.  The most obvious way
is to stop the fermentation (either by filtering or by sulfiting)
while there is still a signicant SG.  But then how does one carbonate?
I *guess* that commercial cidre doux is done this way, and then
carbonated artificially.  After all, the French are not above
"stabalizing" even their very finest Bordeaux and Burgundy with
sulfites. 


In #333, Greg (gkushmer@Jade.Tufts.EDU) suggests:

I've tried both.  Side by side, in fact.  A local place (Jericho
cider mill) makes great sweet cider with a robust natural yeast.
I let one batch go spontaneously as the control group and pasteurized
the other (15 min at 150-160F) to kill the native yeast without changing
the flavor too much.  I then pitched a Wyeast Irish ale culture.


The reuslts were similar: FG of 1003 with the native yeast, 1004 with
the ale yeast.  OG was 1045, so a little over 5% alc/vol for both.
This is off-dry cider, but still quite dry to the palate, like "sec"
cahmpagne (as opposed to the bone-dry "brut").  Not only did the ale
yeast give me an extra point in the FG, but it has superior aromatics,
*despite* the pasteurization.


For cidre doux, I guess you want a FG in the 1012 region.  I'm not
sure any ale yeast will give you that, but you might try Wyeast 1337
(European Ale) or 1007 (German Ale).  These are relatively
non-attenuative strains that don't give too much by way of fruity 
esters.


Cheers,
