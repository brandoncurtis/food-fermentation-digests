 Hello all, I a novice cider maker.  I have been brewing beer for 
five years and now want to venture into cider.  I live in New England
and want to take advantage of the fall crop.  I have local accesss to some
excellent cider.  What I need is some advice.  Some questions:


1. What types of yeast do you recommend?
2.  How long is the ferment?  Do you do a single or primary/secondary
ferment.
3.  I've heard you have to add sugar at end to prevent too dry a product
is this true?  
4.  basically I'd live to produce 2.5-3 gals of a semi-dry product from
local cider mills in Westford, MA.  can you offer some guidance?


Thank you in advance.  my e-mail address is matthew.whiting@channel1.com


Cheers and my your cup never run dry.

Things have been kinda quiet lately so this should get some
traffic going.  I've made the aquaintance of the boys at the
local cider mill, so I can get fresh pressed, unpreserved
cider from them with a fairly accurate idea of the blend of
apples that went into it.  Unfortunately, because of the size
of their batches, I won't have any input into what the blend
is.  So I thought I might try augmenting their blend with
small amounts of home pressed (I've got a small tabletop
press) 'specialty' apples (crab? spy? russet? granny smith?).  
I've got the rest of the process
pretty much down, but I don't really have a good idea of
what sort of blend of apples might yield a cider superior 
to what I get from the generic blend they use (probably
macs, empire, delicious, that sort of thing - I'll find out
exactly what went into the pressing when I pick it up).
Of course, I'll be restricted somewhat by what's available
here in Eastern Ontario (Ottawa Valley).
I may ferment a series of 1 gallon batches, each with a 
different blend, or I may ferment a five gallon batch of
their cider, and a bunch of one gallon batches of pure
specialty apples, and blend the finished ciders to taste
....hmmmmmm.


Suggestions?


 Cheers, Rick C.  (looking for cheap pears to repeat the
wonderful perry I made last fall)
