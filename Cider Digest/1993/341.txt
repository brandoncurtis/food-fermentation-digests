Sorry to send this to the digest but I get the message that my computer
doesn't now Compuserve and the mail to Kevin bounces back.


I would also be interested in the responses you receive.  Just so I am not
mooching, here is some info I have on cider mixes.


I just started my first cyser  5 gallons cider
                               5 pounds honey
                               juice of one lemon (for acid)
                               1/2 cup chinese jasmine tea leaves (unboiled)
                                    (for tannin and flavour/aroma)
I didn't boil anything and pitched with ale yeast (I wanted to try the natural
yeast in the cider but after 3 days of absolutely no activity I pitched some
yeast I had left over from making beer - I have heard that the wild yeasts
give a sweeter, more aromatic cider).  After a week of primary fermentation
I racked and the stuff tasted wonderful.  It is bubbling slowly now in my
basement.
This is my first attempt at cyser, so I can't really help you much.
I have added concentrated apple juice (Seneca Granny Smith) and this was great.
One can to the gallon worked nicely.  You may also want to try Ocean Spray
cranberry juice concentrate.  One box to the gallon.  This stuff was
fantastic.  I am thinking of dividing my cyser into 5, 1 gallon batches and
adding stuff to several of them.  I may add more cranberry (2 boxes?-- pretty
strong alcohol!) because I really like the taste.  My first attempts with cider
 I did not add anything and the stuff was way to dry and horrible,  but I think
 that the honey alone will work well.  Oh, I should add that the cranberry
stuff had the most gorgeous red color, a beauty to see and taste! (no I'm not
affiliated in any way with Ocean Spray!).
I am curious about what stuff you may add (inthe way of adding acids or tannins
etc., not sugars) because of those first horrid attempts.


Good Luck

Regarding Cyser making:
   Last year I made a cyser with 5 gal cider, 5 lbs honey and some 
acid blend (2 tsp malic, 2 tst tartaric).  I did not boil but used
5 campden tablet equiv. of Sodium bisulfate, and pitched rehydrated
Red Star Champagne yeast the next day.  The results from this batch
were a little dissapointing so I thought I'd share my experience and
ask for additional advice.
   1)  I will not use RS Champagne yeast again as the result is too dry.
   2)  I don't think acid additions are necessary, or at best should be
      determined from a titration kit.  The cyser is quite tart.
   3)  There is a pronouned sulfur nose that is very distracting.  It 
      does dissapate after a while in the glass, but wow it comes on
      strong.  I was told to leave subsequent apple fermentations in 
      the secondary longer, plus use multiple rackings to help dissipate
      the sulfur odor.  Are sulfur odors typical of apple fermentations?
      This batch was siphoned to secondary after 14 days, then bottled
      after 24 days with 3/4 cup corn sugar.
   4)  Has anyone used boiled cider instead of honey as an extra source
      of fermentables?
Hope this provides some guidelines on what NOT to do, and initiates some
discussion on what TO do.

Hello all,


last week, I decided to undertake my first attempt at making cider.  I
followed a recipe in the Cat's Meow (the homebrew recipe book) which I
reduced to one gallon (rather than the five it called for).  I sweetened it
with brown sugar and honey in the recommended amounts and rehydrated the
Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast, pitched and nothing happened.  


In  my homebrewing, I am used to seeing fermentation activity after 24
hours.  After two days, there was still no visible activity (the airlock
was still), so I pitched the rest of the yeast (I had only used 1/2 of the
package).  Now it is over a week later and, except for a little bit of foam
(really, very little) there still is no activity.  Should I wait?  Should I
toss it and start over?  Should I add more yeast?  BTW, the cider was from
a local cider mill and the label indicated that it contained no
preservatives>


Any advice will be appreciated.
