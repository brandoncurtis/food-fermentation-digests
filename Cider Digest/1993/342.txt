Subject: Help - fruit/vinegar flies!


I've noticed some small flies (vinegar/white/fruit?) around my 
glass carboy (a NE cider recipe from the Cat's Meow).
I have a three piece air lock on and it's 
tightly sealed. Some of the flies got inside of the airlock
but none appeared have made it inside the cider. Have they layed eggs
or somehow infected the whole batch with germs resident
on there body? I don't want to open the batch for racking or bottling
without risking contamination. Any hints (like useful insecticides)
I should be thinking about before I open the carboy? I tried adding 
just a little bit of bleach to the airlock as some sort of stopgap
measure. Should I toss the batch and write it off? It's been in the
carboy for quite some time now and I'd hate to loose it (or have
5 gal of not too good vinegar).
