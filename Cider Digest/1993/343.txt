I had about 30 of those go after my mead.  They either drowned or
were overcome by the CO2.  I just sanitized another airlock and
replaced the old one.  Dont toss your batch!  You should be ok
as long as none get to the cider.

Don't worry.  I've had fruit flies in my airlock at various times.  They
never make it past the water barrier because they drown.  This has happened
to my wheat beers and my alt beers.  As a matter of fact, I currently have
a batch of wheat beer and a batch of cider in my basement and the fruit
flies are in the beer airlock, not in the cider airlock.  When you remove
the airlock, make sure that you don't spill the water into your cider.  But
that should be the only issue.


Good luck

Subject: Annual Ciderfest picnic


Greetings,
  I was just added to the Cider mailing list (hi everybody) and have
been reading over some of the past digests.  In digest 267 Paul
Correnty talks about an annual Ciderfest picnic at Anderson apple
orchards in Westford, MA.  Is there a Ciderfest picnic planned for
this year?  Has it already happened?  Thanks in advance.
