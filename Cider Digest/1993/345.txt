I was told of a great way to get rid of fruit flies.  They cannot fly
very fast, so you can suck them up with a vacuum cleaner hose.  It works
best if you find them "sitting" on an object, but you can get them in
flight to.

Subject: administrative requests




I have received several requests from people to unsubscribe in which
they have failed to provide the address from which they were subscribed.
You can not assume that the reply address included in your message is
still the same as that which you originally subscribed to.  Internal
configurations change, mail gets forwarded, some people use redistribution
points and are not even directly subscribed.  Please take more  care
when making these requests.  It is a real pain to have to constantly
send mail to ascertain the address under which someone is actually
subscribed in order to process a request.
