          Greetings,
               I've never made a cider before, but I'm quite curious
          to do so.  I brew beer quite often & whenever I'm
          formulating a recipe a little voice in the back of my head
          says,"Now! Do it! Make a cider!".  But as usual, I ignore
          most voices: spoken or tacit.  However, now that I just
          froze while riding my bicycle to work I have decided I must
          finally create some warming, high-strength cider.  I've done
          some reading on the subject, but I still have a few
          questions:


          1.   How do I prevent the cider from fermenting ALL the
          sugars and leaving me with an extremely dry cider?  Should I
          be monitoring fermentation with a hydrometer and then stop
          fermentation with Campden Tablets?


          2.   How do I make a "sparkling" cider?  I would assume that
          I prime my bottles just like with beer, but how much priming
          solution and should it be dextrose or something else?


          3.   I have a package of Wyeast Chanpagne yeast.  It's about
          5 months old (refrigerated), so I want to make a starter
          solution before pitching it.  I assume I don't use the DME
          that I'd normally use for beer.  Should I just pitch it into
          a jug of apple juice which has previously had a Campden
          Tablet in it.  Is any boiling required?


          4.   How long does it take for a Campden Tablet to finish
          sublimating, i.e when can I pitch my yeast?


          5.   I have some apple juice and honey.  How would I use
          these to create a pseudo-Champagne?


          I appreciate any and all help you can give.


          Cheers,
          Andy Anderson
