I've not tried it myself, but a book I have says you need _a lot_ of
pressure to juice apples.  You might try freezing them first.  The book
also says that traditionally the apples were cut and ground into 'cheese'
which was left to brown for a day, then pressed.  I have done something
similar to this and it seemed to work pretty well.  I cut them and beat them
in a bag with a hammer, added a campden tablet, and let it sit in a covered
bucket till the following evening.  The result was fairly liquid, but I
fermented the whole thing, fruit and all, (with added mill-bought cider)
for a few days.  I then strained,
and pressed the solids (in a bag) in a small grape press, and fermented
the rest of the way in a glass secondary.  I believe I got most of the
good stuff out of the apples.  It was a lot of work.  If you try freezing
some first, let us know if it helped.


By the way, the above was my first attempt at cider, and was pretty bad.
If any one else has heard of or used this old method (of browning the
apples first) let me know how it came out.  I have been using mill-bought
cider with no added apples since then, but would like to create an
'authentic old-style' cider in this way.
