I've seen a recipe for Scrumpy which has you cut up or mash the apples and
add some sulphite. You then ferment the whole thing for several days. After
about a week you strain it off into your secndary fermenter and then proceed
as normal. This produces a darker colored and rough flavored cider. This 
process seems very close to what you did. Perhaps the old recipes that you 
have seen are really for Scrumpy.


I was planning to make this from the apple from the tree in my yard. However,
I was unable find time to do it before the apples went moldy. Oh well, there 
is always next year.


FYI, I've seen Odwallo Apple Juice (fresh, unpasturized, not from concentrate) 
in the San Francisco Bay Area CostCo's for about $3.50/gal. I've been lately
experimenting with this. In fact, my first attempt with homebrew cider was when
a gallon of this juice was forgotten in the back of my refrigerator for over a
month. I had a very good sweet sparkling cider. After that I was hooked. Forget
brewing beer, I want cider.
