I plan to do just this. Yesterday I bought a couple fresh pressed
gallons from a local apple grower. I plan to add lager yeast to one of
the gallons and let the other ferment spontaniously. I also bought a
gallon to drink as is.


The apples are mostly red and golden delicious, according to the grower.
This brings me to a question: would it make any sense to add some lemon
juice to adjust the acid content? Your opinons are solicited.

I made a NE cider based upon the recipe in Cat's Meow II over this
last weekend. As follows:


        4 gallons cider - a Macouns and MacIntosh blend from
        Peter's Family Orchard, Acushnet, MA - no preservatives
        and un-pasturized
        5 and 1/3 cups cane sugar
        Placed into a plastic fermentation bucket with lid and 
        airlock
        O.G 1.074 at 62 degrees F


After 4 days, absoultely no activity! I'm trying to rely on wild
yeasts, but also I'm afraid of making rope or vinegar. I'm
also thinking about the recent scare and E. coli infection outbreak 
in SE Mass from people drinking un-pasturized cider, this reportedly from 
rabbit/deer/rodent feces contaminating the drops used for making 
cider. Did the cider mill wash the apples too much and remove all
the wild yeast? I didn't want to wait much longer so I pitched
Epernay II yeast this morning. Epernay II, from Great Fermentations,
Santa Rosa, CA, is supposed to be for fruit wines. 


Does anyone have any comments? Was I too impatient? I have yet to make
a cider with wild yeast!
