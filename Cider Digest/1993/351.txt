Subject: Re: (wild) yeast


One thing that prevented fermentation could be the complete absence
of yeasts, bacteria and the like. There is an alternative to pasturizing
or adding preservatives: filtering. With a filter medium that is
sufficiently effective you'd even filter out bacteria and yeast. If
this was the case the juice would have been brilliantly clear.
A way to get a 'rather clean' wild yeast is to pick a clean apple
from one of the trees. You could check for mouldy spots or rotten
parts, or insect holes. If the apple looks fine it will probably have
a decent amount of yeast and not too much other stuff. Just toss the
entire apple in the juice, don't bother crushing it, you just want
the outside.
