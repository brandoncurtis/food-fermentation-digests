Subject: My plans this fall




Howdy. Time to quit lurking as I've been doign for some time now, and
tell all about my fall ferments. We had our annual fall cider picnic this past
weekend (thanks to Greg Kushmerek and Paul Correnty for making this happen).
At it I was able to pick up 20 gallons fo that wonderful Paul Correnty cider
blend. Some of you may know that the fellow who sewpt all 3 places of last years
American Homebrewers Asocc. Cider Competition used lastyears Correnty blend.


This years blend was both inexpensive at $3 a gallon, and far sweeter than 
last years (1.050 as opposed ot 1.045 last year) due to the dry year we had in
New England. It is very heavy tasting  with some nice astringency as a drinking
cider goes, but I'm sure will make a wonderful hard cider, as I have found that
what makes a good drinking soft cider does not usually make a good hard cider.


Also I found a place (Macks in Londonderry, NH) that sells the renowned Mutsu
apples (originally from Japan) and makes a drinking cider from them.
The drinking cider is wonderful. It is exceedingly aromatic, with pear and
peach notes, very fruity. It has a nice balance between sweetness and tartness,
and is quite drinkable. Perhaps the nicest soft cider I've had. The apples 
themselves are great eating as well.


So my plans for this fall (already underway actually) are as follows.....






Traditional New England Cider
- -----------------------------


6 gallons Correnty 1993 blend 
9 cups of cane sugar


Toss into carbouy, shake, leave on the back porch to ferment until Spring.


OG 1.075






East meets West
- ---------------


2.5 gallons Correnty 1993 belnd
2.5 gallons Mutsu (from Macks)
5 cups cane sugar


Toss into carbouy, shake, leave on the back porch to ferment until Spring.


OG 1.070




Blueberry Hard Cider
- --------------------


12 cups hand picked New England low bush blueberries
5 gallons Correnty 1993 blend
1 packet Red Star Epernay 2 yeast




Toss into Carbouy, let ferment at room temperature for 6-8 weeks.


OG ~1.050




Spiced Draft Cider
- ------------------


boil down 2 gallons Correnty blend to 1/2 gallon
add cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, allspice, ground ginger to tastge during boil


mix with 3 gallons cold Correnty 1993 blend 
Add 1 packet Red Star Ale Yeast 


OG 1.065


Toss into Carbouy, let ferment at room temperature for 2-3 weeks
Siphon into keg and force carbonate. (this came out really great last year)








Hope this gives folks some ideas. Happy Fall.....

Yes, worry.
Try aerating after racking it (once or a few times).
It's important to get the cider off the yeast at once. The ale yeast
might have been the problem here.
One of the easiest ways of aerating is to use an aquarium pump and just
let it bubble away. It might be a good idea to have sufficient sugar
and nutrients available while you're doing this so you'll get a nice
new fresh young yeast population. If this doesn't work you could try
activated carbon filtering, but you'll lose color and taste as well
that way.
Best thing to do as soon as possible is to rack it!

I had the same smell in the  first couple days, but it disappeared.  So,
keep in mind the motto of the homebrewers:  Don't Worry and have (in this
case) a glass of cider.

Subject: Fall Cider Recipe


Hi All:


I am relatively new to making cider and have a few questions for those with
some experience. (I've only made one small batch of cider so far).


I purchased 5 gallons of fresh pressed cider on Saturday.  I put it in my
basement till I could get to making the batch.  It's a fairly constant 62
degrees down there.  I am going to make the batch this morning.  When I
checked the jugs of cider this morning,  Fermentation had already begun I
guess with the natural yeast.  I unscrewed the caps a little to let the
pressure off.


My first question - Do you think that it is O.K. to go ahead and use this
cider?


I am going to use the recipe from the Cat's Meow II on p. 11-3 Which is
essentially the following recipe:


5 gallons fresh apple cider
3 tsp acid blend
1 tsp yeast nutrient
2 1/2 tsp pectic enzyme
1 cup corn sugar
1 1/4 tsp sulfite crystals
1 pack dry ale yeast (Red Star)


Recently I've seen some discussion on the HBD re:problems using Yeast nutrient
so I was planning to eliminate this ingredient.


Q - Will the cider still turn out O.K. if I don't use the yeast nutrient?


I am hoping to produce a sweet, sparkling cider.


Q - NET wisdom appears to support the use of ale yeast so that when a certain
alcohol level is reached, the yeast will shut down fermentation.  Is this
correct?


If so, when I bottle this stuff, will there be any yeast left to allow me to
prime with corn sugar to get some carbonation?




Any comments/suggestion would be greatly appreciated.


TIA,


Don Trippeer

Subject: 1993 Apples


Midwest (and other) cider-makers:


My original gravities on the five or six varieties I use for my blend are
about ten-thousandths down from last year (1.040 vs 1.051 or so).  And
pressing yields are up substantially:  nearly 4 gals. per bushel now vs.
about 3.1 in '92.  My apples are from Southern Wisconsin and I assume this
is due to the extremely wet weather we've had this year.  I'd be interested
in results from others on the Digest, both in the Midwest and around the
country -- for those of you who buy apples rather than must, how's the crop
look this year?
