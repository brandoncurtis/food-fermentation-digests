Subject: Sweetening Fermented Cide


I recently made Hard cider using essentially 5 Gallons of Fresh apple cioder, 3
lbs. Brown Sugar, 3 Lbs Honey, and 2 cups of Light DME.   Also, I used Red star
Champagne Yeast.  My question, is this.  Is there any way to sweeten this
concoction?  It is very tart, but good.  Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
Does anyone recommend the use of Lactose, and if so, how much?

| I'm not sure I'd agree with Ralph Snel's comment to worry.
| Hydrogen Sulfide is what I recall is the origin of rotten eggs smells.
| typically if you smell this it means it is being liberated from the
| wort/must/cider as a fermentation by product. I have found that with some lage
r
| ferments I've done in the past that a healthy yeast might produce this, but
| eventually the sulfide source exhausts, or whatever reduction process
| that accounts for this finishes and the liberation of the hydrigen sulfide
| ceases and the smell subsides with no residual smell retained in the beer.


I'll second that.  I just racked a steam beer/lager to secondary.  In the
primary, it stunk heavily of sulfur and, I admit, had me worried.  However,
the smell has subsided and the beer is clean and dry tasting - no sulfur
whatsoever.

Replying to Hitchcock on "long" cider:


What I mostly try to achieve in cider is the French style of wine-like, 
relatively low alcohol, aromatic beverage.  This involves emphatically
NOT adding any form of sugar, honey, concentrate (yuk!), and a long sec-
ondary at relatively low temperatures.  (I've become a firm believer in 
the absolutely crucial role played by temperature in brewing -- I did a
"true," 12-week, mostly below-40 degrees lager last winter and it was
outstanding.)  My cider last year had about 14 days of primary at 50-55
degrees, only one racking, and 4 months at 46-52 degrees.  It was marred
by too much tannin (I had access to some lovely Dolgo crab apples and
overdid it), but otherwise was clear, clean, dead still and has been long-
lived.  In at 1.051, out at 0.998, the alcohol is just about right.  With
a suitable mix of apples (or a wet year) one can get the O.G. below 1.040
for even less booze.  Go for it!


 . . . And to Geo. K on apples:  Thanks; nice to know that all the world
was not under water this summer (I'm in Iowa).
