In #357, Trevor Keough complained about a stuck fermentation. Trevor,
tell me that starting gravity of 1.200 was a typo! If not, wow! If that
ever was able to ferment out all the sugars (which I doubt any yeast
could do, at least those known on this planet), it'd finish above 20%
alcohol. If that indeed is the original gravity, then 1.100 is about as
low as that batch is going. Split the batch in half and dilute it with
water to equal the volume of cider. That'll take it to an SG of
1.050, and hopefully the yeast there will rouse back to life and finish
the job.
