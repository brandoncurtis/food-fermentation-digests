Hello everbody,
        YES! My initial posting of  a SG of 1.200 was a typo as pointed out
previously. It should have read 1.0200. 
        As to how to measure the SG go get yourself a hydrometer. They are 
available in any brew supply shop. Just make sure that you get one to suit your]
needs, either a beer or wine hydrometer depending on the job.




Cheers
Trevor Keough

I made the plunge last week into cider after 6 years of making beer and 
about 9 months of making wine.  The recipe I used was a combination of what 
I've read from The Cat's Meow II, this digest and a couple of wine-making 
books:
     4 gallons of fresh cider (They said it was from a blend of locally 
grown apples - no specifics)
     4 teaspoons acid blend
     4 teaspoons pectic enzyme
     4 teaspoons yeast nutrient
     4 teaspoons cinnamon
     50-50 mix of brown and cane sugar to bring the O.G. to 1.082
     2 packets of Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast


Questions:
1.  Was the acid blend necessary?  One wine book said "yes", the other 
"no".  I don't have an acid test kit yet, but I will probably pick one up.  
What is the ideal level for cider?  I have read that wine must should be 
adjusted to a ph of 3.3 - 3.8, and I assume this is true for cider also.


2.  I did not add any tannins, as both books said it was not necessary for 
apples.  Any comments?


3.  I am hoping that the use of the brown sugar will leave some residual 
sweetness.  Is this true, or will it completely ferment out?


4.  Is a target O.G. of 1.082 too high?  I was shooting for a potential 
alcohol level of 10%  What is common?


5.  I plan on making this a sparkling wine, adding 3/4 cup cane sugar at 
bottling.  Is this in the ballpark?  Comments?


6.  I have read that cider will clear on its own in time; however, I plan 
on adding bentonite at the first racking to quicken the process.  Does 
anyone have any experience with this?  I have had very good luck with it in 
wines.  Would sparkaloid (?) been a better choice?


7.  What kind of time frame am I looking at?  I was thinking it would take 
quite a while with that starting gravity, but primary fermentation has been 
vigorous, bordering on violent.


8.  A friend told me that I should have waited to add any spices to the 
secondary.  Should I plan on adding more to get a spicy flavor?  I thought 
4 teaspoons was an awful lot to add...


9.  Any general comments?


As always, thanks in advance

Subject: Commercially available ciders


Hi:


Here in Ithaca, NY, I can buy three commercially produced ciders
in my local beer store:  Woodpecker, Woodchuck regular, and Woodchuck
amber.  Not such a wide selection, considering that the same
beer store stocks 100 different beers.


My question is:  what other ciders are available in the US?
If you have a chance to reply, please include as much information
as possible.  For example:


Name of cider:
Name and location of brewer:
Where sold:
Price (for what quantity):
Style (dry, sweet, etc):
Carbonation (still, sparkling):
Approx alcohol content (mild -- strong):


Finally, if you got a chance to taste it, let me know what
your opinion of it was.


Send all responses to me, and I will post a summary later.


Thank you all in advance.

Subject: Sweetening Cider


With regards to sweetening an already fermented cider which is tart,
most have recommended adding sugar until it can't atke anymore.  At what
% alch. will the yeasties begin to die off, rather than continue
fermentation.  I'm currently at approx. 13.50 %, but want a sweeter
cider.  And, how about Lactose as a sweetener?  Anybody try this?  Look
forward to hearing from you all.

Subject: Fermentation slow to start.


Greetings,
  I recently started my first batch of Hard Cider but the cider has
been sitting for several days and fermentation has yet to begin.  Here
are the details on what I have done so far.


  I have two 1-gallon jugs that I am using as carboys.  I bought 2
gallons of unpreserved apple juice from a local apple orchard.  To the
first gallon I added priming sugar to bring the SG to 1.064. To the
second gallon I added priming sugar and honey to bring the SG to
1.070.  I then added 2 campden tablets per gallon and let it sit for
24 hours.  After that I dumped a package of Ale yeast into 1/4 cup of
water at around 100 degrees F and let it sit for 15 minutes before
dumping half of the yeast mixture into each of the carboys.  I
attached airlocks to the carboys and let them sit.


  I pitched the yeast on Sunday evening, it is now Friday morning and
I haven't seen any bubbles come through the airlocks yet.  Have I done
something wrong or am I just being impatient?  If I have done
something wrong what can I do the get the fermentation started?  Thanks
in advance for any advice you have to offer.
