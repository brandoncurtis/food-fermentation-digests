Subject:  re:Fermentation slow to start 


Troy complains of a slow start to his fermentation.


Based on my experience, I'd say the campden tablets are to blame.
I've had very slow starts after using only one tablet per gallon
(and waiting the requisite 24hrs, etc.) and haven't used them since.
If I do anything about the wild beasties (I'm doing some experimenting
with not doing anything this year), it's pasturization.


What I would do is aerate your cider a bit to dissipate any remaining
excess SO2 (pour half the contents of each jug into a sanitized container
of some sort, shake what's in the jugs vigorously, exchange what's in
the jugs with what's in the container and repeat, or something along
those lines). Then I'd repitch with fresh yeast.
Like I said, I don't like the whole sulphite thing at all.          
Cheers, Rick C.
