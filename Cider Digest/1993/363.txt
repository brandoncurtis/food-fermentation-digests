I've been reading this list for about a year now, and there are a few
things I still do not understand, so I'm gonna start asking questions
for a change.


I am on my fourth batch of cider this season, and I have never used campden
tablets, sulphite, or the like.  I have no clue what they are for. would 
someone please enlighten me?  I have the tablets, but I have only used 
them in my airlocks.

I also want to say that I really enjoyed reading about peoples failures.
You can learn more about the art from bad batches than from good ones.
(plus it makes me feel better when I have a dud.  ;-)

Subject: yeast nutrients


Recent discussion has centred on slow starts for fermentation and the
problems with residual SO2. Could the problem stem from inadequate
nutrients other than sugar. Could the nitrogen be limiting? Does anyone
have a suggestion or comment about yeast nutrients?
