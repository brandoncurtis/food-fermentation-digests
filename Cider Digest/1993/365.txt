Subject: Cider this year


Hi everyone.


I'm feeling a little guilty reading all of these interesting posts and not 
contributing anything of my own.  Therefore, I thought I'd post an FYI on 
what I'm doing this year for fermentation (consider this post a data 
point(s)).


This year I'm experimenting with completely natural fermentation.  I have two 
batches going: a natural cider with approx. 3 1/2 lb. of sugar and the 1993 
Correnty blend of apple juice (S.G. 1.050 w/o sugar -- didn't take one with 
the sugar).  I essentially put 5 gallons of juice in a carboy with the sugar 
(didn't even boil the sugar as I have in the past) and stuck a blowoff tube 
on it.


My other batch is the same blend of juice with 6 lbs. of honey.  I only put 
in 4 gallons of juice and the carboy is pretty full with the mix.  Again, I 
added no yeast, nor did I put in any nutrient or sugar.  I didn't even heat 
up the honey.


For me, this is an experimental year.  Last year I made a Cyser with 4 
gallons of 1992 Correnty juice, 6 lbs of honey, and a pound of sugar.  I 
brought the whole mixture up to 190F and let it sit there for 20 minutes.  
For me, the product is very satisfying (although my housemate, a mead fan, 
believes it's too harsh -- but what does he know ?  ;-)  


What made me decide to go natural was the fact that I took five gallons of 
the same juice and fermented it out without sugar or honey and it came out 
wonderfully.  I may take the cyser from this year and add more honey and some 
yeast -- but I haven't made any decisions.  So far it's all fermenting very 
pleasantly away and making my basement smell like an apple warehouse.


Cheers,

Colleagues:


The discussion on sulfites is a good one and I can't resist putting my $.02
into it:


  1.    Last year I ran a sulfite/no sulfite comparison with two carboys of
        identical must pitched with Wyeast Champagne.  At bottling 5 months
        later I could detect NO difference in looks or taste between the two.
        And not in the seven months or so since either.


  2.    The sulfited must took a very long time to start to perc -- two to
        three weeks, as I recall (my records are at home; I'm in the office).
        But ferment it did, and quite vigorously.  The trub produced, which
        I used to make bread, was indistinguishable from the no-sulfite batch.


  3.    I like to ferment the primary at relatively cold temps -- 55-60 degrees
        if possible.  I've found that pitching yeast into a starter batch of
        a pint or so of must and letting it get to the cierd equivalent of
        "high kreausen" (that weird word above should read "cider"; I can't
        backspace more than a line on this antiquated editor) is very helpful
        in getting a good ferment going quickly.  And it's an awfully good
        check for your yeast, too.


In the future, I don't plan to use sulfites again since I don't use "down"
apples and get them pressed at a super-clean commercial facility.  For those
of you who are used to wort fermentation, be patient:  cider ain't beer, its
rythms are very different:  basically, everything is stretched out.
