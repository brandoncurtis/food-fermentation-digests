Subject: Honey or sugar?


  I've been experimenting with fermentables for cider and it seems to
me that the ciders made with honey (cysers) have given better results
by far than the ones I made with cane sugar. The cysers are quite
drinkable soon after bottling, while the sugar ciders are fairly vile
for several months. The cysers clear shortly after fermentation stops,
while my sugar batches never clear completely. I use pectic enzyme
with both. The only advantages to the sugar ciders seem to be that they start
quicker and cost less. I notice that most of the recipes posted use
sugar, am I doing something wrong?


Thanks,
