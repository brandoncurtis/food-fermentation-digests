Okay, I know it's not the best way to start, but I had a bad experience with
some cider that the farm-stand guy said was all-natural. It was only after
I'd pitched yeast into the 5-gallon batch - twice - that I noticed the cider
jugs included on the label - in small letters - "contains less than 1/10 of
1% sodium benzoate". After a month waiting for something to happen, I threw
out the whole thing. Then just to see if I could get anything going, I mixed
up some frozen supermarket apple juice (specificaly labeled "no
preservatives"), adding extra frozen juice and some sugar to get to 1.070,
and a packet of Edme Ale 
yeast (already started in 100o water with corn syrup added). It started
bubbling almost violently within a day. But that was a month ago. It's still
bubbling, slowly, (about 1 bubble every 15 seconds) and appears to be
clearing a little, but not much. How long should I expect it to continue like
this? Should I rack it off the yeast to another container? What would be the
advantages/disadvantages of racking? How much longer 'til it might be ready
for bottling? Should I add a little sugar at bottling for a light
carbonation? I'm hoping for a cider that's more beer-like, like Woodchuck,
rather than a wine-like cider. Anyone have any hints?
