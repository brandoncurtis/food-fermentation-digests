I am currently fermenting a batch of cider (almost three weeks now).
Right now, it's a bit cloudy.
What can I do to ensure that this cider will clarify?

          I found it strange when I first registered in Cider Digest (back 
          when there were only two messages a month!) to read postings 
          that refered to apple juice as cider. I wondered why anyone 
          would use cider as an ingredient of cider. See? Told you it was 
          confusing ... As this is an international forum, it seems 
          logical to reserve the name cider for the end product only.
          
          re: Pam Day's posting - Help!
          
          Why would you include Irish Moss in your recipe, and where/what 
          did you do with it?

Brad Richards writes that he is/was having trouble getting his batch of cider 
to ferment.
   Well, I'm no expert, but I did have a similar problem.  I believe the 
culprit is the addition of sodium metabisulphite.  My cider took 5 days to 
show any signs of fermentation, but after a few more days, it was working 
nicely.
   The only problem that now remains is a semi-irritating sulphur smell.  
Oh-wwll.
   I hope this info helps.  By the way, my cider has been in the bottle for 2 
weeks and is pretty tasty, as ling as you don't try to smell it.

Okay, I know it's not the best way to start, but I had a bad experience with
some cider that the farm-stand guy said was all-natural. It was only after
I'd pitched yeast into the 5-gallon batch - twice - that I noticed the cider
jugs included on the label - in small letters - "contains less than 1/10 of
1% sodium benzoate". After a month waiting for something to happen, I threw
out the whole thing. Then just to see if I could get anything going, I mixed
up some frozen supermarket apple juice (specificaly labeled "no
preservatives"), adding extra frozen juice and some sugar to get to 1.070,
and a packet of Edme Ale 
yeast (already started in 100o water with corn syrup added). It started
bubbling almost violently within a day. But that was a month ago. It's still
bubbling, slowly, (about 1 bubble every 15 seconds) and appears to be
clearing a little, but not much. How long should I expect it to continue like
this? Should I rack it off the yeast to another container? What would be the
advantages/disadvantages of racking? How much longer 'til it might be ready
for bottling? Should I add a little sugar at bottling for a light
carbonation? I'm hoping for a cider that's more beer-like, like Woodchuck,
rather than a wine-like cider. Anyone have any hints?
