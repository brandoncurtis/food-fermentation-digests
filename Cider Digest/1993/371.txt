My 1st batch of cider started at 1.070. It's been bubbling away for about a
month now. It's clearing some, but still isn't really clear. Now the SG reads
1.010. I don't want a really dry, alcoholic cider. Is there any easy way to
stop the fermentation, clear the stuff, prime & bottle for a little
carbonation?y

        I'm a cider newbie also.  After some advice from this 
journal I went out a tried a batch.


1 gallon fresh apple cider from a Wstford orchard
1 cup of brown sugar
1/2 packet of cider mulling spices
2 packets of Red Star Ale yeast


I simmered the cider for 30 mins.  then added the brown sugar 
and spices and simmered for another 15.  Cooled the cider 
pitched yeast after rehydrating them.  I used ale years to give me a 
sweeter product.  I let ferment for 3 weeks.  One in a 3 gal carboy.  
last two in one gal jug.  I added a tablespoon of corn sugar at 
bottling to give it a slight carbonation.  It been aging four weeks 
now.  I'm cracking open the bottle, I bottle whole batch in a gallon 
glass jug.  I will report on results.
