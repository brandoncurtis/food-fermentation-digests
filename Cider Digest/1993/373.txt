        I pressed some apples about two weeks ago, added some honey and
yeast and the fermentation has been proceeding along very well.  Right now
I have a good amount of yeast sediment on the bottom of the fermenter.
What kind of racking schedule should be followed for cider.  I saw in one
book that the cider should be left alone until it fermented to dryness, then
checked for acid content, and depending on the results, either rack or let
sit for one additional month on the sediment.  Any other recommendations?

Greetings cider lovers!


I was in Boise this weekend and had the oppertunity to try another
commercially available cider.


"Seven Sisters Apple Cider"
$4.29 for 750ml.  5.5% by volume.  P.O. Box 2126 Sandpoint,  Idaho.


This was a very light cider.  Seven Sisters makes three flavors:
Apple, raspberry, and cherry.  All are made with apple cider and are
5.5% by volume.  The cider came in a regular wine bottle with a regular
cork, but there was a tiny bit of carbonation (not enouhg to make
the bottle dangerous).  Not much apple flavor at first, but
it got better with the second glass (perhaps from the cider "breathing
in the open bottle?).


Just thought y'all would like to know.

          Hi Pam:
          
          Thanks for replying! I too make my own beer and yes, I add Irish 
          Moss in the boil to assist with clearing. I was wondering if you 
          had boiled your apple juice like wort to incorporate the moss. 
          many people on the Cider digest say not to boil. Personally, I 
          always boil store-bought juice as it inevitably contains 
          potassium sorbate. An evil sounding name but it is perfectly 
          harmless except it inhibits yeast growth, which is what it gets 
          paid to do ... a quick boil (a minute or two)destroys its 
          preserving property and allows the yeast to take off rapidly.
          
          I grew up in England and the (home made)cider was always allowed 
          to ferment on natural yeast. It takes a year or more, but it 
          always clears and it manages to get to around 8% alcohol. It is 
          served `still', i.e. not fizzy, down in the west country - 
          Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, etc.;- and it tastes a bit like cold 
          tea and apples. It's very easy to drink and neophytes often fall 
          down after a single pint! 
          
          The west country folk claim to have been making cider since 
          Joseph of Aramathea (he of the Holy Grail fame) set his staff in 
          the ground somewhere near Stonehenge and it turned into an apple 
          tree. I just love those apocryphal stories, don't you?
          
          To answer your Q. re cider clearing, yes, in my experience it 
          will always clear given enough time. To ensure a really 
          sparkling glint to it you might want to use pectinase when you 
          pulp the fruit. It's an enzyme that destroys the pectins which 
          could leave a haze in the cider. You can get it at any 
          winemaker's shop for less than two dollars.
          
          good luck with your cider. I wish I could taste it, too
          
          waes hael,
