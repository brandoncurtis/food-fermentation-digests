My first batch of cider is in my secondary fermenter and looks to be ready 
to bottle by this weekend.  I used an ale yeast to leave some residual 
sweetness, and because that's what I had available at the time.  My 
question is - what are my options regarding how/when I bottle?  I presume 
that I could add some priming sugar then bottle as I would one of my beers, 
but could I also just transfer the stuff to gallon jugs and refrigerate 
before serving?  Other possibilities?  And, what are the plusses and 
minuses regarding the various options?  I expect to take some of it to a 
family Thanksgiving gathering, but they may not be able to drink all 3 
gallons of it (or I may want to save some for later).


Thanks in advance for the help!

I tried e-mailing to Paul Correnty this am to get more info about the
publication "Zymurgy", but was bounced.  Can you help?
