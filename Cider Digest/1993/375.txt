Howdy All,
        I have decided to have another try at cider. My first attempt was
rather yuk! It had a terrible rubbery taste. I think I caused this problem
myself, since the rubber bung I bought was too big I shaved it down to size.
BAD MOVE! The bung must have imparted its smell into the cider.
        Anyway I am using a very simple recipe.


Simple "First Time" Cider.


4.5 liters (1 Gallon) Apple Juice.
1/8 t Tannic Acid
1/2 t Citric Acid
1/4 t Yeast Nutriet
1 sachet Champagne Yeast.


        I decided to very the recipe and add 1/2 cup of corn syrup. After
the cider had fermented out I intend to rack it 5n}and add 100grms of 
lactose to make it sweeter. I have noticed that many people are having troubles
making a sweet cider, have you tried lactose.
        Could someone please tell me what acid blend is? I know it a blend of
acids but WHAT acids and in WHAT amount. Acid Blend is not very well known
in Australia.


Regards,
Luke

Steve, how about plastic 2 liter bottles. I used these with my last 
batch of beer, and they worked great.  they can hold a lot of pressure, 
wash easily, and are available everywhere.  you'll get one or more uses 
out of them *before* they get recycled.  IMHO perfect size for your
gathering, and you can bring home what doesn't get gulped.


try to use plastic caps as they are stronger.


you can also check carbonation by squeezing the bottles.  soft bottles
are flat.  watch the hard bottles when opening them. :-)
