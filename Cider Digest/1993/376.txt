Dear Cider Group:
        
        Please continue my subscription at the same address, which is: 
reedr@bcc.orst.edu


        I subscribed to this group around Nov. 1 and received a couple
weeks of postings, all with the heading "Are you sure that you
want....".Well, I sure do want to receive more postings from this group. 
Our bulletin board software is very difficult to access, and the direct
e-mail is wonderful.  Thanks a lot for the postings that I have received. 
I toured Spain and France during the first two weeks of November and I
plan on contributing a few words to this group about it.
        Thanks.


                             Ralph Reed

Subject: first batch




I bottled my first batch of cider last night after a 13-day ferment,
racking once.  The final gravity was down to 1.000! and the liquid was
still rather cloudy (though this doesn't bother me).  I used 2 packets of
dry ale yeast, in an attempt to produce a higher final gravity than
champagne yeast, but got a rather tart, dry, final product.  Other than
adding lactose, what other steps could I take to produce a sweeter final
product?


Following the suggestion of Dan in Digest #374, I filled a 2 liter plastic
pop container in addition to my glass bottles.  When I checked it this
morning, it was firm!  I am now nervous about the survival of my bottles.
I believe that fermentation was virtually complete - the airlock was
only bubbling ~once a minute.  I used 1/2 cup corn sugar for carbonation.
Should I expect trouble on this one?  This procedure has worked well for me
over nearly 20 batches of beer - does cider behave differently?  I don't
want to have to open and recap my bottles, but I certainly don't want any
glass grenades either.


Any suggestions will be welcomed.
