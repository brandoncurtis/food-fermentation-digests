Howdy!  This is my first post here.  I noticed a lot of hullaballoo about
cider becoming too dry and the subsequent remedies via lactose or extra
sugar priming, etc.  I have made a few batches of cider that use less
attenuative yeasts and had resounding success.  Of course, I can't recall
the numbers right now, but I used Wyeast liquid cultures.  One was Irish
ale yeast, and the other was British ale yeast.  The british ale yeast is
the same one used in Whitbread ale.  
        The Whitbread batch came out dry and very effervescent, most
people who tasted it described it as champagne-like.  I loved it.  It came
out at about 8.5% alcohol.  My wife could only drink 1/2 a bottle before
falling asleep.  She wanted a sweeter cider with a lower alcohol content.
        The Irish ale yeast is much less attenuative in my experience. 
The yeast fell asleep at about 4% alcohol, leaving all the rest of the
sugar.  It is a little too sweet for me, and luckily I bottled it right as
it was slowing down.  Two months later, it is lightly carbonated and
slightly reminiscent of a vouvray.  The only problem is a little
cloudiness.  I suppose that time would erase this, if I gave it a chance.
        Cheers!
