When I started a recent batch of cider, the hydrometer broke, and the bottom
fell to the bottom of the carboy. OK, I guess I shouldn't have been using the
hydrometer directly in the carboy, but I figured I could strain out the
pieces of glass, etc. after fermentation. But when I recently racked it to
another container, the yeast and stuff that had collected on the bottom had a
black color, and the stuff tasted funny. Also, in the yeast etc. on the
bottom, there were small black pieces, the size of grains of sand, that
smeared black stuff on your fingers when you picked them up. What I'm afraid
of is the black stuff was the weight on the bottom of the hydrometer, the
weight is lead, the whole batch is probably toxic, and the ounce or two I
drank will further diminish my already limited mental capacities (as attested
to by this whole episode). Anyone have any thoughts on this? Should I throw
the whole batch out? Am I gonna die (well, eventually, I know the answer is
yes, but what about prematurely)?
