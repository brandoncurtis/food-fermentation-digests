OK, the batch of cider with the broken hydrometer & metallic smell/taste is
history. If it was lead from the weights in the bottom of the broken
hydrometer, any chance that could've infiltrated the polyethelene (sp?)
bucket it fermented in? Do I need to do anything other than normal sanitation
procedures to make sure I won't be poisoning future batches?
