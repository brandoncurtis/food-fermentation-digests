I'm no chemist but I would at the very least soak and rinse the bucket out with
 a good acid solution.  Maybe straight vinegar and a clean cloth to wipe the
sides and keep them wet for a while.
I would then soak the whole bucket for a long time with a hot bleach solution,
following the instructions on the bottle of bleach for sanitizing.
Perhaps some chemist out there could give us a clue as to what chemical is
best for putting lead into solution and keeping it there.
