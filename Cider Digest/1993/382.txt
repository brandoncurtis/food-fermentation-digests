Hello All,
        My advice is to throw the bucket away. Lead is not very 
reactive and chances are that you won't be able to dissolve it
out of any small scratches etc.. As a result it could leach out into
many successive batches in ppm amounts, not that it would be enough
to do you much harm, but it is toxic. It's also just not worth the 
aggravation, primary fermenters aren't expensive, save the brain 
cells you're likely to burn out worrying about it.


Pam
