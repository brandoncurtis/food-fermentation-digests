All these responses are great, but they pre-suppose that my assumption that
the weights in the bottom of the hydrometer is correct. Does anyone know if
the weights in the bottom of a #300-1 hydrometer (no manufacturer indicated
in the instructions, but came packaged in a Crosby & Baker kit) actually are
lead? Could it be something else? If it was something else, what are the
implications of that?

If you decide to keep the lead-contaminated container, you should wash and
scrub it well with soap and water, and then with acid.  Use dilute
hydrochloric if you have it (be very careful) or lots of vinegar if that
is all that you have.  Then rinse it many, many times.


                      just a suggestion,
