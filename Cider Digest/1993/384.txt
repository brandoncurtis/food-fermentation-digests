If you are concerned about lead contamination, and don't know if the little
shot weights are or aren't lead (they probably are though), why not just
buy a home lead test kit and see if you get a positive indicator?


These kits are widely available for testing for lead in paint, soil, plates,
etc.  It's pretty much a "go/no-go" test, but it will detect whether or not
lead has leached into the plastic (it won't give you a conc though).
