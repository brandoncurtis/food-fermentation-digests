I'm stuck here in Southern California about 500 miles away from the nearest
apple orchard, yet extremely anxious to try making a fresh batch of hard
apple cider. Can anyone out there recommend somewhere in LA to buy fresh,
preservative free, cider? Or, is there a way to ship 5 gallons or so? I'd
gladly exchange all the oranges and avocados I can find for just a few
containers of cider. Thanks.
