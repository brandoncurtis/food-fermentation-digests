Subject: Apple orchards in Southern California

Marco Bario was lamenting the lack of apple orchards in Southern California.
If anyone else is interested, there are quite a few orchards in the
Tehachapi area, only about a 2 hour drive from the greater Los Angeles area,
three hours at most.  The season is around September-October; I did not get
a chance to buy any apples or juice from there, but at least one orchard, I'm
told, has installed a large juicing machine.  You may wish to contact the
Tehachapi Chamber of Commerce at (805) 822-4180 for more information.
