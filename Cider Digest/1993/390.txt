Subject: how to get rid of yeasty taste?

OK, I started my first batch of hard cider about 7 weeks ago (first
batch of any fermented beverage, actually).  I've racked it twice
and the fermentation seems to have stopped.  It's fairly, but not
completely clear.  I'm concerned that I can't tell how the stuff
tastes because of an overpowering yeast taste that masks everything
else out.


Is this normal?  I've read other peoples posts where they mention
a good taste to the cider in less time than this.  Am I just
jumping the gun here or do I need to add finings or have I done
something horribly wrong or what?


In case it matters, I used fresh cider, some spices, 1 campden
tablet per gallon (its a 5 gallon batch) sugar (SG 1.06), some
yeast nutrient and montrachet yeast.


I'm working from a position of extreme ignorance, so any help, hints
or suggestions would be most welcome.


Thanks,
