        If you satisfied with the gravity its at, throw it in the refrigerator.
A good cold snap will drop the yeast out of suspension. If its chilly outside,
try the garage or back porch. Once you do this, however, further fermentation
is unlikely. If you're planning on bottling you might try this with a test
sample. If you like it, prime and bottle and after carbonation is OK, then
throw it outside.


        On a slightly different topic - 


Why does anyone use campden tablets? I just don't see the need. I don't like
chemicals in my drinks and I can't help thinking that it cripples the yeast.
These stories of campden tablets followed by yeast which takes 3 days to show
visible signs of fermentation make me shudder. Why not pitch a large quantity
of healthy yeast, let them fight it out with the nasties and take over? My
ciders have all turned out fine and meads as well. I pitch frozen fruit 
straight into them following the onset of fermentation and they do fine. I
understand that winemakers use campden tablets so perhaps that's where the
folklore started. Anyone have a good explanation?
