There is also Oak Glen in Yucaipa, just east of San Bernadino along I-10.
Caution must be taken in making assumptions about the raw cider one buys
at the stands along the road there, however, as the less than one tenth of
one percent sodium benzoate in the batch I had downstairs for a month
went unnoticed until too late.

I just bought a copy of the Proulx book
"Sweet and Hard Cider". My initial exposure
to this book was a loan the local public library.
But I really wanted my own copy.


The version I got from the library had some nice
color photographs of apple varieties and an
outstanding bibliography. However, the latest
one that I purchased has omitted this stuff. 
I can understand the expense of the color plates 
when it comes to cost saving, but removing 
the bibliography is going to far. 


If you're going to purchase this book
you should check it out first!
