Hello to all,
        I hope everyone is having a great Xmas break and that the new year
brings nothing but great cider to all. A little while back I put on a 
batch of sparkling cider from a kit which was a gift. It contained the 
apple concentrate (2.0 l) yeast etc. After following the directions and 
anxiously awaiting the finished product, I was none the less disappointed
when I discovered a strong yeasty taste. 
        I was relieved to find someone else on the net had a similar problem,
and even more so to
 hear that a good cold snap should kill of the yeast
and stop fermentation. I have done this with several bottles by placing them
in the lower part of my fridge for a week but the yeast flavour still remains.
How cold should I let the cider get to ensure that the yeast is completely
dead? Should I leave it for a longer period of time in the fridge before
drinking? Any ideas or sugestions would be appreciated I have 3 dozen
left.
