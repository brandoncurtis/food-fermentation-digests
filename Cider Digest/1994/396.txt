Just a quick note in response to Trevor Keough's problem:  In general, 
a "yeasty taste" is not normally due to the presence of yeast _per_se_, but
rather due to byproducts that aren't supposed to be there.


The question comes up now and then among homebrewers or winemakers who've
gotten an off-taste and wonder if they put in too much yeast.  The answer
is invariably "no"...because the yeast population after you get a batch
going is at least a couple orders of magnitude larger than what you start
with.


The relevance to Trevor's problem is that it's not really an issue of
letting the yeast die off, nor settle out.  It may be a matter of letting
some off-taste of a byproduct age out.
