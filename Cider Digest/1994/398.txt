Stephen Butts asked me to publish the '93 Correnty blends (the '92 blends
were published here last year). I called Paul and got the following:


The first batch, distributed at the Wort Processor/BFD Cider Picnic at
Anderson Orchards in Westford MA was:


   50% Anderson blend (Paula reds, Macintoshes, Golden Delicious, Red
   Delicious and Macouns, proportion unknown). This was Anderson's regular
   drinking cider.


   25% Baldwins


   15% Northern Spy


   5% Rome


   5% Stamen Winesap


   I measured this batch at 1.052+ OG.


The second batch was smaller and not widely distributed. I think only six
people got any of this. It included the standard drinking cider blend from
Kimball's Orchard in Pepperell MA on the NH border. Kimball's blend was 6 or
7 varieties of mostly dessert apples and some Puritan, Spencer and Macintosh.


   40% Kimball's blend
   30% Roxbury Russet
   25% Baldwin
   5% Wolf River (a huge apple with a snappy taste like a R.I. Greening)


   I measured this batch at 1.051 OG.


I am a big fan of russet apples. They're ugly looking (sort of a fuzzy
greenish bronze) but they are interesting to eat and cook with and make
great cider. The sugar content is so high they have to be balanced with
less sweet apples or else the cider will be too alcoholic and ferment out
too dry.
