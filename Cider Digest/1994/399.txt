I don't know the technical differences between ciders and wines, but I
have had some fantastic apricot wine, made by a tiny winery in Pasadena,
CA, which has gone out of business. I'd guess you could make an orange
cider in much the same way as apple cider, but expect the shelf life to 
be very short -- at least that's the case for citrus wines.

I am curious about filtering equipment and would like to hear from anyone
who has tried to clarify hard cider with a filter. What sort of filter did
you use? What size of membrane? Where did you get it? Cost?
Did it work? Alternatives to filtering?


Thanks
I'll post a summary of people's experiences as it may be of general
interest.

I find this very interesting. Proulx's book mention cider apple varieties,
in particular Kingston Black. The blends listed above seem to be table, 
dessert, and pie apples, which I know do make for very good cider.


Northern Spy has a very good reputation as being an all-around good
apple, the standard. 


I'm wondering about the cider varieties sold in some of the nursery
catalogs such as Sonoma Antique Apples and the Grootendorst Nursery?
