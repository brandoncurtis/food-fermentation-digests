As I understand it, it isn't nasties that do in citrus wine. It's 
just that after a while the chemicals in the wine break up, and
it loses its flavor. You could still drink it, it just wouldn't
taste very good. I think the same sort of thing happens to Nouveau
Beaujolais wine as well.


Anyone know how long apple cider will last, assuming it's not
consumed?

Subject: priming/bottling question


OK, so I put my cider down in the basement after fermentation
was finished because I heard that lower temperatures help clearing.
Its nice and clear now, and I want to bottle, but I noticed that
my basement has been getting pretty cold lately and brought down
a thermometer - 42 degrees!


My question is - do I need to add more yeast when I bottle in order
to get a sparkling cider?  Would the combination of cold temps and
no sugar to eat have killed all the yeast off?


In either case, how long after priming and bottling does it usually
take for the cider to become sparkling?  Will it become sparkling
if I leave the bottles down in the basement or does it need a higher
temperature?


Eagerly awaiting enlightenment,
