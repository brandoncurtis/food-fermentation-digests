This really isn't a cider recipe, but it's close. I have a batch fermenting away
 now. It makes 1 gallon.


Orange Wine:
12 oz.    Frozen Orange Juice
1/2 pt.   White Grape Concentrate, or 1 cup Light Dry Malt
7 pints   Water
2 1/2 Lb. Sugar
1/2 Tsp.  Energizer
1         Campden, crushed
1 pkg.    Sherry Yeast (This recipe is from 1976, modern yeast packets are made 
for 5 gal. batches.)


Pour juice in primary. Add sugar, pour over water (warm) and stir in all other i
ngredients except yeast. Cover Primary. After 24 hrs, add yeast. Cover. Stir dai
ly, and check S.G. When S.G. reaches 1.040 (3-5 days), siphon juice into glass s
econdary. Attach airlock. When ferment is complete (S.G. 1.000, about 3 weeks), 
add clearing/fining agents, and when clear, bottle.
I have no idea if this recipe is any good, but it's one of the few I've been abl
e to find using oranges.

What's the problem with using cheesecloth to filter? Does the gelatin affect the
 taste of the end product at all?

It's very difficult to kill all the yeast, especially if you used
a cultivated kind (compared to a wild yeast).
The spores of the yeast can survive for several hundreds of years
under good conditions. Maybe even longer. A couple of years ago
a spanish 18th century shipwreck was discovered with undamaged
bottles of wine on board. Laboratory investigation of one of the
bottles showed that there were 'living' spores present.


If you want to be sure to get a sparkling cider it is a good idea
to add a fresh yeast culture (and some sugar if needed) when
bottling. If you don't it might take several months before the
dormant yeast finally decides to wake up. Moving the bottles to
a warmer place will definitely help though.


Cheers,
