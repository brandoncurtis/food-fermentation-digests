Subject: Fining with Gelatin

In response to a couple of notes regarding clarifying my ciders,I usually
dissolve about 1 tsp. gelatin in a about 3/4 cup water (let the gelatin
hydrate in the water for 30 min. or so at room temp, then boil) & stir gently
into the cider as I rack it into a glass carboy for 2ndary fermentation. As I
understand it (and I'm sure there are lots of folks out there who understand
it much better than I do) the gelatin gloms onto all the little particles of
yeast, apple, and other stuff that makes cider cloudy, and helps assure that
it all settles out to the bottom of the carboy, leaving sparkling clear cider
on top. So the gelatin doesn't end up in the final bottles, and doesn't
contribute to the cider's flavor. (Hopefully it doesn't take down any of the
cider's flavor components with it - maybe the sophisticates here can a
dd their 2c on that issue).
