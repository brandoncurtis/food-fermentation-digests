I have a gallon of cider that's well on its way to becoming vinegar. It's very
good vinegar but I've moved it well away from the rest of my brewing
operation! One of my friends tasted it and said it has the same infection that
Belgian brewers have in lambic beers. He also said there's a Belgian
beermakers bulletin board just like the Cider digest. Can anyone tell me how
to subscribe to it? E-mail direct please.

Maybe my very limited ( 4 ciders - 2 natural yeast, 2 ale yeast)
experience accounts for my question, but so far I've seen absolutely no
reason to use fining agents. I've simply left the cider in a secondary
or tertiary carboy for a couple of months and it has always become 
crystal clear. Am I more patient than others or have I just been lucky
so far? 


I haven't tried to make a sparkling cider yet; is this where "early"
bottling and fining agents would be employed?

Subject: Alcohol Bite




I just recently made a batch of cysers.  It has
been fermenting for about a month and a half and
close to being able to bottle.  I have two 
questions
        1: How much of a priming sugar should I
add, ie corn sugar, ..., to get a sparkling
cider/cyser.  I have about 4-5 gallons of 
liquid.


        2: Any suggestions or ideas on how to
slightly mask the alcohol bite (taste).  I 
currently stand around 11% alc. and a spec.
grav. around 1.015


        If you need more info just mail me and
I will post more, just tell me what.


Thanks in advance,  Please reply by email or
posting if you think it is viable.


        Thanks Again,
