I'm working on a cyser right now, and I thought I'd let people in on
what's happening.  This isn't a request for help, just an FYI.


The base started with 4 gal. Correnty-blend '93 and six pounds of raspberry
honey (from an apiary in Maine).  I used a natural fermentation and
it chugged merrily along for a month or so.  When it settled down,
it clarified amazingly fast.


I started this in October, and let it sit until December when I finally
racked it to secondary.  I added to it a semi-frozen sludge of raspberries
(organic) I'd picked this past summer.  While I didn't have a scale, I'd
put the weight at 5 or 6 pounds.  I added with it another six pounds of
the same honey, four tsp. of yeast nutrient, and some raspberry sugar
(1/2 pound).  For yeast, I pitched Red Star Champagne (Uberyeast, as
a friend likes to call it ;-).


It took almost two weeks, but it's going again.  The natural yeast had
attenuated highly, so the Red Star took its time getting active.  Let
me say now that while I've sanitized things, I did not treat the fruit.
If there's something living in it even after freezing, then I've got
a lot of cooking vinegar.  


Should be interesting.
