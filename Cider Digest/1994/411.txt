Hello All,
        I've finally decided that I probably should do something
with the 5 gallon carboy of cider that been occupying a corner of
my kitchen since early Oct.. The question is what? It's about 5 1/2
gal., it had 2+ lbs. of honey in it and was fermented with champagne
yeast. I look at it occasionally, and as of the other day it still
hasn't cleared much. There's alot of crud on the bottom (I did rack it
off once in Nov.)  & it does bubble once or twice an hour. Any 
suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated! You can e-mail me
directly @ day@a1.tch.harvard.edu  .


Thanks in advance,


Pam
