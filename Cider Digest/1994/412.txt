no, the question is when!  get to it!  sitting that long still
won't affect the taste that much, and it looks ready to bottle..

If you are worried about it clearing, just boil a teaspoon of agar
(or gellitin if you are not a vegitarian) in a cup or two of water,
and add it to the cyser.  it should clear in a few days. rack, bottle,
wait that long year, and drink.  :)

Let it sit and age.


I don't even rack unless I need a roomier carboy for a second 
fermentation.


Just keep it at 60-65F out of the way and leave it.  Cider
is the easiest thing to nurture!
