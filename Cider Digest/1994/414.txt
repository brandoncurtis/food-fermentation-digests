Howdy folks. Now that I've been making cider a few years I have some older
stock (well less than a six pack actually) that I tried the other day. While it
was brilliantly clear it seemed to my recollection the flavor had changed.
While before it used to have a nice dry/sweet balance it now seems that it has
soured some. This cider was a New England traditional fermented with wiuld
yeasts and bottled 2 years ago. It scored in the high 30s in the AHA cider
competition when entered.


So I am wonderinng if anyone else especially those who ferment with wild yeasts
have experienced negative flavors developing as a result of aging. I had
previously found my ciders to be similar to meads in that they required at
least some aging to taste good/mature rather than harsh and had expected them
to handle long term aging well so I am surprised at the apparent development of
sour flavors in this cider and am wondering if I need to reconsider my approach
and treat it more like Ales and consume it fresher and not alow long aging.
