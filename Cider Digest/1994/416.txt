I've been following the New England Cider recipe in
Cat's Meow. I'm at the point now where I'd like to
rack onto the raisins. 


My question is...
Is this really needed? What am I going to gain from 
the raisins:
        - A secondary fermentation
        - Raisin wine
        - Another type of yeast
        - higher alcohol content
        - ?


Also, if the general consensus is that raisins should be
added, what type of raisins should I add -Sultana, currant,
or the regular run-of-the-mill supermarket raisin.
Any hints or comments appreciated...
