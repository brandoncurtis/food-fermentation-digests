Subject: first day of spring, time to bottle




yesterday being the first day of spring I went ahead and bottled 11 gallons of
cider.  Six gallons was a traditional New England fortified with cane sugar to
a gravity of 1075 and left to ferment with the wild yeasts.  I split this
batch, which had a final gravity of 1000, into two halves.  The first was just
bottled straight.  The remaining 2 gallons I added a little under 1/2 cup of
caramelized cane sugar to, an idea I stole from the makers of Woodchuck cider.


The straight  New England was medium dry, the caramelized version slightly more
 sweet, and of course a little darker in color.




The other batch was a 50-50 blend of the Correnty blend (a local chef and club
member Paul Correnty makes a custom blend for the club) and a farm stand
drinking cider made from exclusively Mutsu apples, a sweet and very fruity
variety grown in New Hampshire originally imported from Japan.  It had a final
gravity of 1006 with a starting gravity of 1075 as well I believe (I will have
to double check my notes).  It was quite a bit sweeter than the straight
traditional New England in the other batch but was no sweeter than
commercial ciders such as Woodpecker or Woodchuck.


Overall I am very pleased with this years batch.
