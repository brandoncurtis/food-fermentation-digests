Hello everyone,


I just thought I'd add my own 2 cents about what I've been doing with my ciders
[and variations there of] for the past few months, so here goes!


Back in November I started a mead/cyser. I don't have my brewbook with me, but
here's the basics. 4 gallons farm cider, 6lbs honey, 1lb brown sugar, ginger,
water and 2 packets of Redstar champagne yeast. I think it fermented for about
3 to 4 weeks, no secondary, bottled with 3/4cup cane sugar and let it sit. We
tried in in early January - very alcoholic and sharp, but not too bad. Then I
have been trying a bottle each month until now, and they were still too sharp.
Just this past week I cooled down a whole 6pack and it's really nice. Very
clear and just enough carbonation, not too dry: In short, a success I'd say,
and it only took 4 months total. It will probably mellow and get better during
the next few months, but I am satisfied with it as is.


After a couple rather mediocre batches of cider, I finally tried the old stand
by of letting the wild yeastie-beasties go on their own. This was store bought
cider, but no preservatives, etc. 4 gallons, 6lbs total of a combination of
cane and corn sugar as I had no honey or anything else, a bit of dried ginger,
and cloves, and that's it. The original gravity was about 1.06, it only took
1 week to ferment out to .996 and only 3 weeks in the bottles to condition,
and it tastes great. The only thing I forgot was to add pectinase for the
bottling, so it's a bit cloudy, but otherwise very tasty. Now a warning: I tend
to like my ciders on the dry side, so this may be a bit too dry for some of you
but I was amazed how well the wild yeast worked and how quickly.


Sorry to keep rambling, but I might as well get everything said while I'm at
it!  Currently I have a batch going with 4 gallons cider, 2 cans apple concen-
trate, 1/2 gallon berry juice combination, frozen raspberries and blackberries,
ginger, honey and cane sugar. Again, I let the wild yeast do their stuff and
again the original gravity was about 1.06 and after 1 week, .997. I racked into
a secondary and it had tons of sediment. But what worries me is that it smelled
"skunky." I've let it go for another week and the gravity is still .997. Should
I ignore the smell and hope it mellows with age, add more sugar, dump the whole
thing or what? I plan to bottle it this weekend, so responses would be greatly
appreciated.


Well, that's all. Sorry to ramble on but I thought some of you out there would
be interested in my attempts. My motto is "the faster, the better" with cider.
I don't want to wait months for it and so far, I've been satisfied with my
quick batches.  Let me know what you all think though. Oh and one last thing, I
am going to Scotland in a few weeks. I know they aren't much for cider, but do
any of you know if there are any good brands up there, or should I just hope to
get Blackthorne or Strongbow?
                      Thanks a heap!
                                    Bridget
