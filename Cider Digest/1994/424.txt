Mike,


your problem is either the choice of yeast or not high enough starting gravity
or alternately too low an amount of unfermentable sugars.


For my draft cider I use an ale yeast however I still boost the gravity into
the 60s by boiling down some of the cider to concentrate the sugar.  In the
past I use dry malt extract but that added a beer flavor which I enjoyed though
my then girlfriend did not.


Even with a cider makers blend and the natural yeast my traditional New England
cider is fairly dry.  Final gravity of 1.000 so sufficient unfermentable sugar
can still leave a fairly dry product even with a higher starting gravity (this
started at 1072 or there about).  Certainly with more  tenacious yeasts like
the champagne wine or wild yeasts I have used the final  dryness can be too
much.  Of course you can always sweeten to taste at serving time.  I have had
to do this with past efforts.


To Justin:


I caramelized my sugar by adding a very very small amount of water to it
and then carefully cooking it in a pan for 7 to 10 minutes at medium to high
heat.  Caution: do not add water to the hot caramelized sugar it will boil
violently upon addition and can spatter and cause severe burns.


The advantage is primarily in coloring the wort.  There is a little bit of
sweetness and some caramel flavor but mostly a color change.




Just a note: I will be traveling on business and vacation and will
unfortunately not be able to continue follow up on this discussion.  My
apologies to anyone this inconveniences.  I will return towards late April
should anyone have specific follow-up questions for me then.
