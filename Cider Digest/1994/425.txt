Subject: carbonating with sweetness


Tonight I bottled a cider with OG 1.050 and FG 1.008. I chose a less
attenuative yeast - Wyeast European - in hopes that some sweetness would
remain (rather than the super-dry batches I've had in the past). In tasting,
it still has some residual sweetness, but I assume the yeast pooped out
because the alcohol level got too high.  I then went about my usual beer
carbonating practice of boiling up 2/3 cup corn sugar and adding it to the 5
gal. batch just before bottling. But it's ocurred to me - if the yeast
actually stopped 'cause the alcohol level got too high, there's no reason to
assume the yeasties would start up again to add CO2 to the finished product.
Are mt assumptions right? Anyone have any thoughts on this subject?
