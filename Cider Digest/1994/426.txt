 over the next several weeks I will be traveling and will be in and out of the
office.  Therefore I will not be able to process subscription requests or
handle any other administrative details of the digest.  Therefore if you wish
to unsubscribe you should either do so immediately or you will have to wait
until late April.  If you are informing others about this list please indicate
that their subscription request will not be processed for several weeks should
they choose to subscribe rather than waiting.
