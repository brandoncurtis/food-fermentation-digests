Hey,
    nr (I don't know who this is!!) asked about bottle conditioning with
corn sugar to add some carbonation when the yeast may already have pooped 
out due to high alcohol concentrations.
    It may work, but my last batch proved to be a miserable flat failure 
when I attempted a similar feat.  I used 5 gallons of cider, 5 lbs. of 
clover honey, cider mulling spices, and some wine yeast (which I now 
forget the name of--it's been a while).   The damn thing bubbled away for 
about 6 weeks--the alcohol conc. must have been through the roof.  After 
secondary ferment, I bottled with 1 cup corn sugar, and let it sit for a 
while--and to this day, NO CARBONATION AT ALL!!!!!
     Since you have a real low alcohol brew, you may want to try adding a 
more potent yeast at bottling time with a starter culture along with the 
corn sugar--that may give you the boost you need, and hopefully, high 
carbon dioxide pressures within your strong glass bottles will not allow 
the new yeast to metabolize all your sugar away.
   But if you get bursting bottles, don't blame me.
            --bryan

Well, I've finally gotten around to scrounging up enough champagne
bottles to bottle my sparkling cider.  The only trouble is that it's
about a year and a half old.  Does anyone have any feeling for how
the yeast (Lavalin (sp?) champagne) might be doing?  Am I best off
preparing a new slurry and racking with that pitched in?


Thanks,


Jim
