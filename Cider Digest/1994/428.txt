Subject: Sparkling Cider


In the two years or so I've been watching the Digest there have been a number 
of discussions about how best to achieve a sparkling cider, with far more 
failures than successes reported.  It's important to remember that cider is 
NOT beer, cider is, essentially, wine, and it responds better to wine tech- 
niques than to those common to beer-making.


First of all, cider is slow, much more so than beer, with long, gentle 
fermentations.  Everything takes more time, and time is well-rewarded. I sus- 
pect that in many cases a primed bottle of cider may take 6 months to a year
to become carbonated.  I don't believe it's alcohol-attentuation that is the
problem, especially with wine or champagne yeasts (after all, wines ferment
out to 12-14% or more).


For quicker results, however, I have had some success with the following:
bottle the cider sometime before the fermentation really tails off, and keep
it relatively cold.  As you might imagine, this is tricky, and thick bottles
are required.  But the cold make the carbonation slow and more CO2 is 
disolved, and this reduces the pressure.  A major drawback is the sediment 
produced -- cider clears very slowly and early bottling captures much of the
crud, which boils up when the bottle is opened.  Champagne-makers solve this 
by fermenting with the neck of the bottle down, freezing the sediment, popp- 
ing it out and re-corking, a bit past the ability of most of us home brewers.
But if you time things right, chill thoroughly and open the bottle very care- 
fully, you can keep cloudiness to a minimum.
