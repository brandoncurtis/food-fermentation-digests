Subject: Don't boil pressurized bottles.


        The boiling of pressurized champagne bottles is dangerous because of a 
build-up of pressure.  This happens because of two reasons.  One, the 
solubility of a gas in a liquid is less at higher temperatures.  (Notice 
how a cold can of Coke will foam a lot more when it is poured into a warm 
glass.)  Two, increasing the temperature increases the pressure of a gas.  
(Try taking a beer out of a hot trunk in the summer and opening it.)
I think that many people are very casual about the pressures involved in 
making, for instance, champagne.  The pressure is about 6 atmospheres or 
almost 90 pounds per square inch, all incased in glass!  
        I make bubbly at home and I try to retain a certain amount of 
healthy paranoia. It is a good idea to handle bottles while wearing some 
type of glasses, especially when they are warm. In the champagne industry, 
they always plan on a certain amount of breakage, as much as 50% back in 
the early days of Champagne and more like less than one percent these days.
        An eye doctor acquaintance here in Oregon told me that two of the 
largest sources of injuries that give him business are racquet balls and 
"champagne" corks.
        Enjoy!
