Subject: Radiation to Pasteurize?


I know this is a pretty esoteric idea, but I'll share it with you
anyway.  Would it be possible to avoid the dangers of heat pasteurizing
carbonated cider by using those ultra-violet sterilizing lamps?  I
understand that the wavelengths of light they produce tend to kill
off things like yeasts.  - Just a thought.
