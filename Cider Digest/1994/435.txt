I see two problems.  1) u-v doesn't penetrate glass or water very well,
necessitating a long exposure time.  2) U-V will not just kill the yeast
but cause many chemical reactions.  Most of these will probably be very
harmful to the cider's flavor.  After all, uv light is one of the main
reasons wines and beers are fermented and kept in dark conditions and
opaque containers.
Your idea will probably sterilize the cider just fine.  But I'll bet the
stuff will be undrinkable.

Does anyone have any experience with trying to flavor ciders? 


Say Cinnamin or Ginger?  


Any thoughts.   I was considering experimenting this fall and wondered if
anyone had allready made any mistakes I might want to avoid?

It won't work. The problem is that you want to irradiate through glass,
which has the nice property of filtering out all the dangerous wavelengths
(or at least most of them). You'd probably mutate the yeast a bit, but
you won't kill it. Then there's the water also, which to a lesser degree
filters the UV.
It'll probably work with hard X-rays, but it's noting I'd like to have
in my garage.

I believe I remember learning in some physics class or other
that regular glass doesn't pass UV radiation.


Clear plastic soda bottles might work.


BTW - the poster that said I was courting disaster by heat pasturizing
mentioned champagne bottles.  If I was using beer bottles would that
make a difference?  Does anyone know which type can take more pressure?
