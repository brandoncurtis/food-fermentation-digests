Subject: Clearing with gelatin


Some time ago, I read that gelatin could be used to clear
hazy cider.  So, I figured I'd bite.


This last fall, I made a spiced (cinnamin, allspice, cloves)
cyser.  It had a rich dark color, but was slightly hazy.  Then,
I went and bought some knox unflavored gelatin, dissolved a
teaspoon or so in warm water, and dumped it into my jug.  I
swirled it around a bit to make sure it was distributed.


>POOF<  VERY cloudy cyser! 


This was over two weeks ago, and I don't see any improvement.
I was under the impression that things would clear within
a few days.  Did I do something wrong?  Is my definition of
gelatin different than what was intended?  Should I have
used cooler water to dissolve it?  Should I add more, or
just be patient??


Thanks,
David Robinson

Just be careful with cloves.  I made a spiced cider with cinnamon, ginger,
nutmeg and clove, but when it was all done, all I can really taste is the
clove.  Even the apple taste has been overpowered by it.


BTW - for some strange reason, about a month after ferment started, all
the spice flavor seemed to dissapear.  The stuff tasted very harsh, but
there was no spice.  After 2 or 3 more months the spice smell and taste
came back.  Has anyone else seen this?

There are UV lamps available which are capable of sterilizing water. These units
 are completely self-contained with the liquid passing through a pipe. In the
middle of the pipe is a quartz rod housing a UV lamp. I use this setup every day
to sterilize water, both salt and fresh. The water can flow through the system
at 16 litres\min with 100% effectiveness. A system such as this can be easily 
modified to sterilize your cider when bottling. I have never tried this but
reading some other entries to the digest I agree that the flavour may be altered
enough to make it unbearable.


Just my $0.02 Can. or $0.015 US
