I have never tried crearing my ciders, but I often use
Knox unflavored gelatin in my wines.  I use 1/2 pouch in
1/2 cup warm water for a 5 gallon carboy of wine.  It
works due to the gelatin being heavier than the wine, and
settles to the bottom.  If the gelatin is lighter than the
cider it won't help.  Other techniques include egg whites
as finnings.
