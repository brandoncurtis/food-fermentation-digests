I've used 1 tsp. gelatin (dissolved in about 8 oz. water, lightly simmered 30
sec. or so, so that the gelatin/water mixture is perfectly clear) in 5 gal.
cider batches with no problem - they clear beautifully, usually within 3-4
days, at most. I did make a beer with approx. 1 tbsp. gelatin, and it was a
mess. So I guess the lesson is don't use too much ...
