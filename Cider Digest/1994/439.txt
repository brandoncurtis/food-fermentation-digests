I recently entered a cyser in a local homebrew competition. Becaues I like
the taste of cider, and I'm not as big a fan of honey flavors, I used about 2
pounds of a mild honey to five gallons of sweet cider. The OG was only a
little over 1.060. Although it did relatively well in the competion, all the
judges sheets came back saying "more honey". Would I have been better off
entering it as a cider, claiming the honey was just an incidental adjunct?
Would that be allowed? For my tastes, I wouldn't want any more honey in it
(but then, I brew to my tastes, then try to figure out what style category
fits afterwards....
