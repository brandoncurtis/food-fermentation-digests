competitions are often a crap shoot.  The less well defined a category is the
more this is so.  So for a broader category where substantial variation can
occur there is much more leeway for subjective opinion of the judges.


Obviously cyser which to my knowledge has no minimum requirement for the
honey/cider ratio (i.e. when is it  mead with cider in it versus cider with
honey in it?)  Has a lot of variability, therefore much room for subjectivity.
In these circumstances it probably helps to convey some notion of your intent,
assuming this gets relayed to the judges, then they can use this to score how
well you achieved your goals, of course that will still only be a small part in
that you can always claim "yeah I meant it to turn out this way" so you can't
ever really eliminate subjectivity.


For more info on the judging process I suggest trying judge-request@synchro.com
which is a discussion list for BJCP judges

With only two pounds of honey in five gallons of cider, I would still call it
a cider. I have made a few cysers, the last having 12 lbs of clover honey to 
five gallons of cider, and I thought it still did not have enough honey
character. Damn tasty, though. I do not have the current AHA style guidelines
in front of me, and there *is* a cutoff point where after so much honey you 
must enter it as a cyser, but I am pretty sure that the amount you added was 
well within cider range.


What kind of yeast was used, and what was the FG ?

btw, glad to see the list is still alive ;->
