Hi all.


I've been homebrewing beer for about 2 years and finally decided to try a 
cider
my recipe follows.


8 cans Safeway generic apple juice concentrate (non preserved, blah blah)
water to make 4 gallons
.75 lb honey
1 lb brown sugar
2 pks champagne yeast (red star)
O.G. 1.060


procedure: heated the frozen concentrate and water to 90 degrees. added 
honey and sugar. Waited till chilled to 75 deg. pitched yeast..
now fermenting in glass carboy (no primary plastic) and bubbling like crazy. 
I noticed that the now fermenting 'wort' is quite a few shades lighter than 
the original concoction. This is probably due to the presence of yeast in 
suspension (??). Smells very alcoholic..(yay!). My question is: will the 
added sugars leave any/enough residual sweetness, or would adding lactose at 
kegging time yield better results? I do have a fridge dedicated to storing 
cornelius kegs. My experience with lactose is just with stouts.
