I seem to remember the WSU agricultural site in Mt. Vernon, WA
(About 1hour N of Seattle) was heading up a cider apple test
site.  I don't know if they sell to the public or not.  Even
if they don't, they are trying to develop and support WA cider
growers.  They would at least be a good resource.

Try Perkins Orchards in Sedro Wooley (206-856-6986), located on Highway 20, 
about three miles east of town. They've got something like 200 varieties.
Nice folks who have a pretty good idea what makes good sweet cider. Highly
recommended.
 
Cloud Mountain Farm in Everson (northeast of Bellingham) have Elstars, 
Spartans, Jonagolds, Melrose, Mutsu and Idareds (and maybe small amounts
of others). Last year they sold #2 grade fruit for $8.95/22 pounds. You
might do better than that at wholesale. They're at 6906 Goodwin Road, 
telephone 966-5859.
 
There's a huge fruit stand on the main highway just west of Leavenworth
with a nice selection of varieties. I got "culls" from them last year 
for .15 a pound. Sorry I don't remember the name, but it's either German 
or Swiss. As you drive east, it's on the right (south) side of the road.
 
Washington Tilth has published a directory of "Organic and Sustainable
Growers" that includes about 50 apple growers. Many of them are limited
to Grannies and Red/Golden Delicious, but you might find some other
varieties. Call Tilth at 527-9216 for a copy of the book.
 
If you know the varieties you want (and maybe if you just want "exotics"),
the Seattle fruit wholesalers might be able to help you. Talk to Sue Verdi at
the Pike Place Market (her high stall is on the street side, about halfway
along the main arcade--if you can't find the stand, ask for directions). Or
call Charlie's Produce (625-1412) and ask for their apple buyer. Both of 
these folks are in touch with a bunch of growers.
 
As of right now, there don't seem to be any orchards growing true European 
cider apples for sale, but this may change--the folks at Washington State 
University and Oregon State U are trying to encourage a commercial hard cider 
industry west of the mountains. 
 
There are a few people experimenting with commercial hard cider production,
but they're either getting fruit from experimental orchards or their own
trees. 
 
The biggest problem is convincing the growers that they will be able to find
buyers for their fruit--they're more interested in finding a new market 
for their Jonagolds and Grannies. Justifiably, they're concerned about 
committing to varieties that only a few people want--if the ciderheads
disappear, they'd be stuck with fruit they can't sell. Please get in 
touch with me by direct e-mail (johnross@genetics.washington) and tell me
how much fruit you're planning to buy--I'm trying to keep a list of 
potential buyers.
 
I think the hobby cider makers can help move some growers toward cider
fruit. Two dozen people buying three boxes each are just as good as
one cidery buying a ton and a half of fruit.
