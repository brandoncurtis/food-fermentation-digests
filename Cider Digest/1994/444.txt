 The Mount Vernon Research Station does not sell fruit. Several people
 (including me) are using their apples for experimental varietal
 production, but that's about it. And within the next couple of years, the
 genetic stock for the European apples is probably going to move down to
 Corvallis, Oregon.
 
 As I said in my earlier posting, we've got a pretty good idea which
 varieties will do well in western Washington; now we need to find some
 growers.
  
On a related topic, Dr. Bob Norton, the retired apple expert at Mt. Vernon
organizing a cider tour of England and Normandy. If anybody reading this is
interested (this fall), please let me know by e-mail and I'll pass your
name to Dr. Norton. The research center is not on equipped for e-mail.
