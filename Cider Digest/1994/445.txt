Subject: Force Carbonation/Counter-Pressure Bottling

I'm a first-time cider maker, after putting together a really fine
custom-crush here in Vermont last fall.  I bottled five gallons of cyser
several weeks ago and I've five gallons of cider fortified with corn sugar
remaining to be dealt with.  My plan is to keg it.  My questions are these:


I typically keg my homebrews at a carbonation level of about 2.5 atmospheres,
using the nifty Byron Burch forced carbonation chart that made the rounds a
few years ago, courtesy of The Beverage People News.  For a reasonably
sparkling cider, what carbonation level should I shoot for?  Also, what has
been the experience of people who have counter-pressure bottled sparkling
cider from a keg?  Is there any reason for it to be trickier than doing the
same with beer?  Do you lose a lot of the carbonation?


Advice, tips, anecdotes would be appreciated.  Post here or E-Mail me:
