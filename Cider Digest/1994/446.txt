Subject: Acid & Tannin levels

As I get set to ferment my next batch of cider, I'm wondering about the
wisdom of the digest regarding the optimum levels of acid blend & tannin to
add to the must before getting fermentation underway.I use a locally-produced
commercial (soft) cider, but I've found that previous batches without added
acid have tasted kind of "flabby" .... Nothing like the Woodpecker or
Blackthorne profile that I'd like to create.
What do other cider-makers do with regard to adding tannins and acid? What
yeasts do you like (I use Wyeast #1338, 'cause it's less attenuative than
others...)? Any other helpful secrets?

Subject: Forced Carbonation


Let's try this again.  I posted the following a week or more ago and have
received no responses.  Does anyone have any suggestions, comments, etc., re
the following:


I'm a first-time cider maker, after putting together a really fine
custom-crush here in Vermont last fall.  I bottled five gallons of cyser
several weeks ago and I've five gallons of cider fortified with corn sugar
remaining to be dealt with.  My plan is to keg it.  My questions are these:


I typically keg my homebrews at a carbonation level of about 2.5 atmospheres,
using the nifty Byron Burch forced carbonation chart that made the rounds a
few years ago, courtesy of The Beverage People News.  For a reasonably
sparkling cider, what carbonation level should I shoot for?  Also, what has
been the experience of people who have counter-pressure bottled sparkling
cider from a keg?  Is there any reason for it to be trickier than doing the
same with beer?  Do you lose a lot of the carbonation?


Advice, tips, anecdotes would be appreciated.  Post here or E-Mail me:

Thanks!
