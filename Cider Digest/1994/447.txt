Hi,


for my first batch of cider, I would like to make something similar to
Woodpecker.
From what I have read, I should use an ale yeast.  My question is, does it
make any
difference which ale yeast I use, or should I just use whichever is
cheapest.  Any
other advice would also be welcome.  Thanks.
