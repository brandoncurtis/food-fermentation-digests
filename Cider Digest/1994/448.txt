Dear Cider Heads:


        The cider I started last fall has finally reached the desired level of 
carbonation.  The high f.g. gives the cider a pleasing sweetness, and it is, 
IMHO, a surprisingly good first attempt.  


        Technical Details:
Cider from a N.H. roadside stand,
s.g. increased with cane sugar
Correnty II Cider yeast
Neither tannin nor acid blend.
Racked onto 1lb. raisins after 2 months
Primed with cane sugar and bottled after another 4 months


        Though pleased with the results, I was hoping for a little more tang (an
d not 
the stuff the astronauts drink :-)).  This year I hope to use cider from the 
Wort Processor's cider picnic.  Will their addition of more "Cider" apples help 
the final flavor profile, in this respect, or is the missing ingredient tannin 
and/or acid blend?


TIA

while I don't recommend the Red Star Ale yeast for brewing beer, I have used it
with very good results in my draft ciders (a low alcohol cider which I force
carbonate in Cornelius kegs).  I generally think any of the dry ale yeasts on
the market will serve the purpose well.  I don't really think you'd need to go
to the extra expense of using a liquid yeast for a cider, though if you were so
inclined I'm sure you'd achieve good results with most of them as well.
