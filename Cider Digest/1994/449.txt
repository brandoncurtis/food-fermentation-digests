I've made a few batches of cider, with the idea of achieving a
Woodpecker-like taste. The first thing I've learned is: You can't really make
Woodpecker at home. If you look at Woodpecker's ingredient list, you'll see
that they apparently brew something stronger and dilute it with carbonated
water. As I understand it, they use commercal techniques that really can't be
duplicated at home. That said, you can make a relatively low alcohol cider
with ale yeast, but I've found that the yeast you use can make a lot of
difference. Basically, an attenuative yeast leaves you with a super-dry
product - not necessaily bad, but not at all Woodpecker-like. That's what
happened to one of my early batches made with Edme dry ale yeast (probably
one of the least expensive yeasts at the local homebrew shop). Since then,
I've settled on Wyeast #1338 European Liquid Yeast, which reportedly is the
least attenuative of the Wyeast products - so it leaves more sugar behind,
resulting in a medium-sweet cider that's closer to Woodpecker. Some of the
other Wyeastss may work, too (they're apt to be among the most expensive
yeasts), but #1338 is the one I have the most experience with. Good luck.
