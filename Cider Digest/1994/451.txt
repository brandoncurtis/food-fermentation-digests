Sorry for taking up the space, but:


I subscribed to Cider Digest on 6-17, but no digests received yet.  Have
any digests been sent since that time, or is activity just real low?


I'd like to know if I need to re-subscribe, or if everything is ok.


Could someone please let me know directly?  Reply to aa4ga@mcimail.com


TIA
