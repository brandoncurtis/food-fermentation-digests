I have a problem.


I'm very fond of cider -- but it does fairly nasty things to my innards,
sending me off to the bathroom frequently and uncomfortably.  So, I don't
drink cider, except a taste at a time.


This is unfair!  Can anyone suggest a way that I might avoid such discomfort?
Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  I do fine with almost all
other foods and beverages, including beer, wine, and fresh apples.
