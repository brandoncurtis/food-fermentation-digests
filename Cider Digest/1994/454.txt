Subject: Cider vs. Juice?


Admittedly I'm relatively new to cider-making, so this might appear to be a
newbie question (which, in fact it is).  I ahve made several batches of hard
cider in the past 6 months, all of which either used store-boughton apple
juice or apple cider.  In the ingredients section, they are listed as either
100% apple juice or 100% apple cider.  I profess my ignorance as to the
difference between the two.  Can anyone enlighten me on this?  Coming into
the fall, fresh cider is readily available, but the rest of the year it is
not, so I'm forced to use one of these two alternatives.  Thanks in advance
for your help.
