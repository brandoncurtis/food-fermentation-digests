Subject: Apple Juice or Apple Cider?


Being quite a newbie in the cider world (I'm planning to make my first batch
this weekend), I have a rather basic question: What is the difference between
"apple juice" and "apple cider"?  I always thought they were the same thing,
but then I noticed that often a particular manufacturer will make both kinds.
The lists of ingredients don't help: usually one says "pure apple juice" and
the other says "pure apple cider".  If there is a difference, which is better 
for making hard cider?  (I can probably guess the answer to that one.)  


Thanks for the remedial help!
