Subject: re: Cider vs. Juice?




a couple of folks have asked this question.  Here by way of answer...


in America there is apparently no discernible difference.  Most often
cider refers to unfiltered juice, like the kind you find at farm stands.
However one often sees clear filtered stuff in grocery stores labeled as cider.


My understanding is in England only alcoholic "juice" is referred to as cider.
The unfermented stuff is always referred to as  juice.


By way of choosing which to use, many people here use the filtered store bought
variety for lack of access to the fresh pressed farm stand type.  My
understanding is reasonable results are achievable.  Being here in New England
where the farm stand stuff is readily available I've only ever used that, and
custom blends as per the recommendations in the introductory mailing (Paul
Correnty is a member of our local brewers club and for the past several years
has provided us with custom blends).


I suppose this list is overdue for a recipe compilation, but I just don't have
time to sort the archives or solicit recipes for compiling.  Besides what would
we call it, Apple is almost as hard to rhyme with as Orange :-)
