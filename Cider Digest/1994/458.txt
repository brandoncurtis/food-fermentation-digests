Hi,


I just finished my first batch last night.  I took 64 oz. of CLEAR apple
juice, removed one cup of juice, and put the rest in a 2 liter pop bottle
with 1 packet of Red Star Ale yeast.  It fermented for about a week.  When
it finished, there was about 2 inches of "crud" (dead yeast???) on the
bottom and the rest of the cider was cloudy.  I poured it through some
coffee  filters, added back the cup of unfermented juice, tasted it, and
put it in the 'fridge.  The sweetness was about right (for me) although it
could use a little more apple flavor - next time I'll try better
juice/cider.  This morning when I looked at the bottle, there was more
"crud" on the bottom and the cider is still cloudy.  So now my questions
are:


1)  Why is the cider cloudy???  Is it just suspended yeast or something
else?  Is this the source of the "crud" on the bottom of the bottle.


2)  Will it clear if I just let it sit in the 'fridge?  If not, what do I
have to do to get it to clear?


3)  Do I even have to worry about this???  Tasting it doesn't seem to have
hurt me.  On the other hand, a friend of my wife's, who makes cider as a
demonstration for her college microbiology class, warned my wife than
drinking live yeast would produce (unspecified) "problems".  She has scared
my wife sufficiently that she won't drink the cider if she thinks there are
still yeast in it (that is, if it is still cloudy).




Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
