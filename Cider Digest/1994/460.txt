Cider may be cloudy due to suspended yeast, proteins, pectin or just crud.
The only problems associated with live yeasts (that I know of) might be
diarrhea,
or other gastro-intestinal upsets.


                               The only thing I can say is
                                -- if it tastes good - drink it.
