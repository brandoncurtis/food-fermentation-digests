With Fall around the corner, it's time to once again think about making cider. 
Two New England homebrew clubs, the Boston Wort Processors and Brew Free or 
Die, are holding an annual cider picnic.


This is the source of the vintage "Correnty Blends" of which you may hear once 
in a while on this list.  I've used two blends, and this year promises to have 
some great apples.  Paul Correnty told me that he's already stashed away some 
Wolf River and Gravenstein apples.  The rest of the crop is looking
magnificent this year with the ample rain and warm weather we've had in New 
England.


If you're in driving distance of Westford, MA (near the intersection of Routes 
3 and 495) then you should consider coming.  The following is the information 
as I've taken it from a club newsletter.  


1994 Cider Picnic Announced!
by Greg Kushmerek


What do homebrewers brew when they're not making beer?  
If it's autumn then this homebrewer is making cider!   Mark it in your
calendar -- it's time for the Cider Picnic.




WHAT:          Cider Picnic


WHEN:          October 9, 1994 (Columbus Day Weekend)


WHERE:  Anderson Fruit Farms, Westford, MA


PRICE:         $5.00 a head to be paid in advance!! (Please)  This 
                        includes a porta-potty, food, plates, tables, charcoal,
                        and other things to get a picnic rolling.


FOOD:          While food is included in the cost of the cost above, 
                        everyone is asked to bring a side-dish.  And guess who
                        gets to coordinate it?  ME!  We need salads, deserts,
                        entrees and side dishes to make this more than  a
                        burger/sandwich-only affair. Call me at (617) 484-0948
                        or send email to gwk@world.std.com.

    I use pectic enzymes to clarify my cider, though as far as I know, it's just
a mattter of aesthetics wherther you have suspended yeast and a cloudy cider. I 
add
add them after the fermentation is complete and 2 or 3 daus whoops days before b
ottling
bottling.  You also might try using wine yeast strtains, like chanmplagne yeast
whoops champagne yeast, which seems to settle better
