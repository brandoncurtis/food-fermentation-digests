Subject: Getting Rid of Pectins


In a recent posting, it was suggested that adding pectin enzymes 2 to 3
days before bottling will help clarify the cider by breaking down the
pectins. This sounds reasonable, but is there any desirable flavors
contributed by the pectins that this will also get rid of?


Just wondering...
