todd- a couple of days ago I suggested adding pectins er pectic enzuymes
to clarify.  just ead another book that touted lots of racking off the lees and
sediment and i just started a couple more batchies in which i tried this,
by chilling the must and decanting it into another container and leaving the
settled sludge behind. stuff is still setling, now that ive pitched the yeast,
but the quantity seems considerably reduced. i also read somewnere
that pecitic enzymes somehow produce a little methanol in the cider, which
would seem undesireable. but im just learning too- love to ttrade notes.
