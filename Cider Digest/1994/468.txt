Subject: Yeast Nutrient Question


  As a fairly new home brewer here in apple country in upstate New York, I'm
planning to do a batch or two of cider during the fall apple season, but I
have a couple questions.
 
  Only one recipe in the cider chapter of the Cats Meow mentions yeast
nutrient.  I know it's necessary for mead, does apple juice have sufficient
nutrients without adding any?
 
  Ale and champagne yeasts are mentioned in various recipes.  Is ale yeast
as quick in fermenting cider as it is with ale wort?  Is champagne yeast
slow and steady with cider like it is in mead?  What are the differences in
the character of cider made with these yeasts?  What other yeasts do people
use with cider?
 
  What apple varieties and blends do people recommend?
 
  That's enough for now, TIA.
 
                                ...Tom
