Subject: weak hard cider




Hello,


I'm new to this digest, and I see a lot of great recipes to try out, but
one question I have is this:


One of my favorite ciders when I was over in England was Strongbow cider,
I think it was about 5 or 6 % alcohol.  (I also like Woodpecker cider -
it was 3-4%).  Many of the recipes I see are for hard cider - is this over
10% alcohol ?  Does anybody have any recipes for making weaker cider?


I'm sorry if this question has been answered a hundred times already - in
that case please don't post this question...

I recently made up a batch using the Red Star Cuvee des Blancs yeast,
and a small bit of honey added to the cider.  The odor resulting during
fermentation, though, is pretty vile.  Any suggestions?  This is the
first time I have ever used this yeast, and while the smell isn't as
bad as that from the Montrachet, it's certainly not what I would expect.

No! don't do it!  I used nutrients once, and it makes everyting taste
terrible.  yuck.  You really don't need it.  Just let the yeast do it's 
thing.

no, the cyder will take much longer.




Is champagne yeast slow and steady with cider like it is in mead?  
What are the differences in the character of cider made with these yeasts?  
What other yeasts do people use with cider?
 
I like to use Weis beer yeast.  the champagne yeast is very common, and
people like it, but the alcohol get's a little high for my taste.
