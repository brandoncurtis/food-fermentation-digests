Subject: Steilacoom Cider Squeeze


The umpteenth annual Steilacoom Apple Squeeze will take place on Sunday, 
October 9, from 10 am to 4 pm on the main street of Steilacoom, Washington, 
just south of Tacoma.


About 24 presses of varying size and age will be avaialable to grind and 
press your apples. Bring your own fruit and containers. There is no charge.


There are usually several local groups (churches and like that) selling 
food. These are local folks--not the usual street fair food booths that set 
up in a different place each weekend.


Most of the people who come to this thing are turning their backyard apples 
into juince. If there's enough interest, maybe it would make sense for 
Western Washington ciderheads to jointly buy some cider apples from the 
Skagit Valley or elsewhere. Please send me e-mail if you're interested.


Even if you don't need apples pressed, the Apple Squeeze is a fun way to 
spend a Sunday. Come around an say hello--I'll be there running an antique 
press with a new stainless steel catch basin.
