What! You go all that way, tasting all those great ciders and you can't=20

You get the word out about the right variety of apples and encourage=20
growers to put a few trees of cider apples in the back-fourty to supply=20
us thirsty cider drinkers with the right ingredients!


On the subject of apple varieties, my last year's experiment was on this=20
exact topic. I have included a copy of the report which has been submitted
to the Canadian Amature Brewers Assoc. Newsletter for publication.

Based on the results of this experiment, my recommendations for a cider=20
made with Ontario grown apples is as follows:
60% Golden Russet (for flavour)
15% Jersey Mac (for colour and sweetness)
15% Northern Spy (for sweetness and clarity)
10% Paula Red (for acid balance)

There was a case a few years ago where a British lottery winner
was discovered to have spent all of his considerable winnings.
When asked how he became broke, he blamed it on the good cider!


A question to the Washington state members:  Where would I find
cider apples in this apple growing mecca?
