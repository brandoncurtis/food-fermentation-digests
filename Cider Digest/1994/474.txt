Subject: Quebec cideries


A few weeks back, someone submitted a piece on their visit to Quebec 
cideries.  I read it and deleted it, thinking "when the hell am I ever 
gonna go to Quebec???" (I live in Virginia).  
    Well, I took a spontaneous road trip to Quebec last week, and spurred
by the article, I spent a day cruising the Eastern Townships, stopping at
a bunch of cideries, and tasting, touring, and asking silly questions. 
    I won't bore anyone with details, since I'm sure I'll just be
repeating what was written the last time. 
    But I would appreciate it very much if someone (the author perhaps)
could forward me a copy of the original submission so that I can compare,
and perhaps add anything I saw/tasted that was not in the original
article.  YUM! 
   By the way, if anyone goes up there, you must visit Coteau St. Jacques,
in St. Paul d'Abbotsford, where Marc-Andre St Jacques gave me a great
tour, stuffed me full of apples and tastes from his fermenting barrels at
various stages, and then showed me the best way to sneak up a privately
owned mountain adjacent to the ciderie so that I could have a nice
mountain picnic without getting in trouble.

I've been wondering about bottling my ciders recently - usually I use brown
12 oz. beer bottles, but for some strange aesthetic reason, green bottles
seem more appropriate. I know that brown is virtually mandatory for beer,
because certain lightwaves can affect the hops, but is cider similarly
sensitive? I entered a cider in a competition earlier this year, and got a
negative comment from a judge because it was in a green bottle (despite that,
it won a second-place in its category). Can anyone shed any light (no pun) on
ciders and light sensitivity?

In Cider Digest #473 M.A. MCClelland asks:
>I recently bought a huge old grape press (for grapes), and am now
>wondering if I can also use it to press apples for cider, too.


I`ll have a more definitive answer next week (after I try it myself this
weekend), but from several sources I`ve learned that pressing apples into cider
is a two step process.  The first step is grinding the apples into pulp, using
an apple grinder.  The second step is to then extract the juice from the pulp
using a press, such as a grape press.  Usually the pulp is held in a nylon
straining bag during pressing.


Apple grinders can be obtained for about US$175 from several sources, including
Happy Valley Ranch (913.849.3130).  If you purchase one, be sure to inquire
about mounting brackets (which would be a pain to fashion yourself).


I`ll probably have more to say about this after I try out my new (to me) press
this weekend.
