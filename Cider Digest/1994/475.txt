Stanley F. Anderson's book "The Art of Making Beer" has a chapter on cider
which includes plans for a wooden press using a hydraulic jack to provide the 
pressure. He credits the design to the Summerland Research Station of the 
Canadian Department of Agriculture, adapted from a design originally published
by the New York Agricultural Station, Geneva N.Y.


My copy of the book seems to predate ISBN codes but was published by Longman
Canada Limited in 1971.  I have seen the current edition in local brew stores 
recently so it is apparently still in print.

Subject: re: Using grape presses for cider


Scanning through Anderson's book, mentioned in my previous post, I found
instructions for the use of a grape press which I will quote shamelessly
without permission:


"The grape presses sold at winemaker's supply stores will effectively handle 
apple pulp if you have only a few score pounds to press.


The typical press, made of hardwood or enamelled steel, has three main parts: 
a basket-like container, a screw-driven plunger and a tray to collect the 
expressed juice. Such a press will take 20 to 40 pounds of apple or pear pulp 
at a time.


1. Raise the screw to its maximum height and remove the plunger.


2. If you are using a small press, place the pulp in a nylon straining bag. 
For bigger presses, use nylon press cloths to wrap the pulp. (Cotton or linen 
cloths can be used, but they are harder to clean than nylon, wear out sooner 
and release the juice more slowly than nylon.)  Make sure that the top of the
bagged pulp is level, then replace the plate.


3. Apply pressure SLOWLY until you feel a fair resistance, then wait five or
ten minutes while juice runs out the bottom of the press.


4. Screw down a little farther and wait again while more juice runs out.


5. Repeat the pressing and waiting until no more juice is obtained.


6. Raise the screw, remove the plate, extract the dry pulp and, if you have
enough apples, empty the bag or press cloths and refill for another run."


Happy pressing! .....Geoff.

Count me in as one of the interested people for a wine/cider press.
I have a small, thin Brittish book by the name of "making cider", written
by someone whose name I don't remember, that has a few descriptions of
cheap and easy cider presses. Basically a heavy square wooden frame with
a basket on the inside and a hand driven hydrolic press to do the squeezing
(one of those you put under your car).


Here's an attempt to describe in ascii what I remember of reading a few
years ago:

Please keep me informed of any other designs.
