Subject: Oak chips


The subject of oak chips with certain wines comes up frequently on
rec.crafts.winemaking, but I haven't seen it here. Are oak chips
desirable to add to cider? I know most cider is aged in barrels like
wine, is cider aged in glass missing an important quality? 


Thanks,
