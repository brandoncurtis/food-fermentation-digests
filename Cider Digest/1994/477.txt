Ciderers,
I would like to attempt a sweet sparkling cider this fall; any yeast
strain suggestions? A strain with a known attenuitivity would be a bonus.


thanks...

Subject: This year's cider


I can hardly move, but living in central New York, with its countless old
and abandoned orchards makes it worth it. Spent most of Saturday picking up
nineteen bushels of drops of four kinds of old apples and two kinds of
pears [apples included Tompkins King (3 bu.), Greening (3 bu.), Cortland (7
bu.), Rome (2 bu); pears were Seckel (1 bu.), and a nameless one,
originally from Switzerland, very high in sugar and in TANNIN (3 bu.)].
Yield about 60 gallons of juice with nice balance of sweet, aromatic, and
puckery. Lacked acid. Transferred to my primary fermenter, and added four
gallons of sour cherry skins, which I had put in the freezer in July after
pressing juice for sour cherry wine. This topped up the acid balance just
fine, and gave a needed hint of bitterness.  After making up a starter of
Red Star Cote de Blancs yeast, I added same and we're off to the races.
Should be great.
