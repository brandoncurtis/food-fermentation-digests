Where does one get a 60 gallon primary fermenter?       :-)


What becomes of 60 gallons of cider?

Hello all,
        Can anyone out there provide me with some info on getting 10-20
or so gallons of cider? I'd supply containers (carboys). I pressed my
own last year for 5 gallons but I have a small press & it would take all
day to get as much as I'd want. Not to mention the expense of getting
apples, even drops aren't cheap anymore around here. 
        I remember someone mentioning an orchard in Pepperell, MA 
(Correnty, ?) last year. I live in the next town over (Dunstable) & would
be very interested in getting some cider from them if possible.


TIA


Pam

**************** Cider Press *************
A few years ago I made a press.  It cost me about
US$20.


The bucket was made from a 7 gallon plastic pail.  I used
a 0.5 inch drill and perferated it at a 1 inch grid.


The frame was made from scrap 2x3 (inch) pine.


For the press I bought a 1 inch x 3 foot threaded rod,
5 nuts, and 2 @ 4 inch washers.  (one of the nuts is larger
than the rod and can twist freely within)


I paid a welder $5 to weld 1 nut onto each washer, and the
large nut onto a metal plate.


I drilled 2 holes into the washers and metal plate to allow
mounting.


The pressing plate was made of plywood coated in polyurathane,
with a 2x3 mounted across for support.  The large nut and plate
were mounted into the 2x3.


The cross member of the frame had a hole drilled into it.  The 
washer & nut were mounted on the underside of the crossmember.


The remaining 2 nuts and nut/washer were used to fasten the 
prying lever to the threaded rod.  The lever is a 2x3 with a hole 
drilled through it.  The washer is mounted on the bottom side
and the nuts lock the lever down from the top.

It has worked for 5 seasons so far.

Subject: Pears & Presses


I`m pretty new to this mailing list, and I`ve seen a couple references to using
both pears and apples in cider.  Could someone provide a comparison between
"pure" apple cider and the apple/pear beverage?  If I want to experiment, are
there particular varieties of pears that I should seek out or avoid?  Any other
hints?


Also, I mentioned last week that I was going to use my new (to me) 16 inch
grape press to make cider.  We tried it out last week, and it worked great.  We
first ground the apples using a grinder that I bought from Happy Valley Ranch,
then pressed the pulp using the new press.  This cider is now happily bubbling
away.


Thanks,
