Of interest to NE region....


ooops just a little too late. We (Boston Wort Processors) had our annual
cider picnic this past weekend at an orchard in Westford (Andersons).
Paul Correnty of Pepperel is the club member who arranges for this special
pressing. It is a custom blend intended for making hard cider. Unfortunately it
is all gone I believe.


The good news is you can probably still go up to Anderson's (Exit 32 from Rt 3
take Westford road westbound towards Westford go about 3-5 miles or so its on
your right) and get some cider. I don't have their number.


Alternately you can try Mack's in Londonderry NH (603-432-3456). The press a
variety of blends, Jonamac (Jonathan and Macintosh), Mutsu, and others.
Last year I blended the Correnty mix with Mutsu cider and it came out great.
I'd expect you might be able to find some pressed cider made from varieties  
reasonable for hard cider making there still....

Hi all!


New to this digest but I am an experienced brewer, BJCP judge and a mead
maker.  I recently got into making ciders and I have what might seem
like an obvious question:


What's the difference between cider and juice and why?


I'm going on the assumption that the only dumb question is an unasked
one....  etc.


Thanks for the help!

His notes on making a simple cider press are great. They make me ask: Why
didn't I think of doing it like that? It's so simple.


A couple of questions regarding its use:
  1. Are the crushed apples just placed in the pail or do you use
     a nylon (or similar) bag around the apples or just at the top?
     The sides of the pail taper slightly so the seal wouldn't be the 
     best all the way down.


  2. How long does it take for a typical press? That is, how slowly do you
     or can you screw down the plate?   


  3. About how many gallons do you get per pail full of apples?


  4. Does anyone have an equally simple idea for cutting up/crushing the
     apples?




Once again, it's a great idea - I'll be making one soon, in time for our
next harvest in 4-5 mnths.

Mark Hibberd had a few questions about the press I described
yesterday.
1) Crushed apples can flow through the drilled holes, a nylon bag helps.
   When used for pressing grapes there is no problem.  The tapering of
   the pail is ~ 0.5 inch.  There is a gap when the plate is high in the
   bucket, no big deal.
2) I turn the handle 1 revolution, then wait a few minutes.  Toward the 
   bottom of the pail I wait ~5 min, less at the top.
3) I press about 50 - 70% of the initial volume into juice.
4) I have not tried to make a crusher.  Freezing the apples allows them to 
   shatter into a pulp.

Dan Drumm asks:




Where does one get a 60 gallon primary fermenter?       :-)


What becomes of 60 gallons of cider?


One cuts the top off a "blue barrel." The Seneca Juice Company of Dundee,
NY imports vast quantities of apple juice concentrate from Argentina, which
comes in 60-gallon blue plastic barrels. People around here use them for
all sorts of things, from floats for rafts to humongo trash cans. I use one
with the top intact to transport my juice from the cider mill to home, and
another with the top cut off for a primary fermenter. My secondary
fermenters are eight 6 1/2 gallon insulated glass carboys, with airlocks.


Fermentation update. This morning, when I went down to beat the ferment
into submission, the froth threatened to overflow the barrel. Probably a
good idea not to put more than about 55 gallons in at a time. The cherry
skins I added, however, float and make a very nice fermentation cap. I put
a large piece of hardware cloth over the towel that covers the top of the
barrel, to prevent a re-occurrence of the time an inquisitive cat almost
became an undesirable flavor note.


As to what I DO with 60 gallons of hard cider, what would YOU do with 60
gallons of hard cider? Use your imagination. As you say, I have lots of
friends who are willing to help me think of things to do with it.


PS: Before the advent of chlorination and other ways of purifying potable
water systems, hard cider or beer was the normal quaff of choice for all
and sundry. Sounds like a nice tradition.
