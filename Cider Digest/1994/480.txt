In cider digest #473, Dick Dunn asks about cider turning a grey yucky color.
I have had similar experiences, namely when my cider, bottled in 2 litre
plastic jugs, has been opened and closed a number of times.  This leads me
to believe that some sort of reaction is going on between the cider and the
air, though I'm certainly no chemist.  Beyond that, I can offer only my
condolences - it really is a horrible color.  Maybe you just have to drink
it all at once.

I'm new to cider brewing with only two batches (one
aging, the other fermenting), but an experienced Beer
Home Brewer.   Does anyone have any recipes
duplicating the taste of Woodpecker or other good
English ciders.  TIA
Bob
