Subject: are cider apples essential?

Are special cider apples required for making a good cider?  I ask
because I just read that Woodchuck (a New England cider maker)
makes its ciders using just regular Macintosh apples.


I suspect that they do some adjustment of tannin and acid level
as well as adding some caramel for their dark cider.  But does
anyone know if they use any other apple varieties?

          I'm fermenting my first batch of cider now and I have a few
          quick questions.


          1.  Do I need to "prime" the cider prior to bottling like I
              do with my homebrew?


          2.  What is the shelf life?  Will it sour quickly?


          Unfortunatly I don't live in an area known for it's apple
          orchards (So. Maryland) so my sources are going to be
          severly limited.  I was given two gallons of cider that
          started to ferment before I could get to them.  I added
          three gallons of pastuerized but not preserved cider.  Plus
          I boiled two quarts of water with brown sugar, honey and
          some cinnimon (sp) sticks and added that.  Finally I started
          a packet of English Ale yeast and added that also.  That was
          two days ago and my bucket is happily bubbling away.


          If I can expect the shelf life to be in excess of several
          months, I don't mind driving to Virginia and buying real
          cider and doing it right.




          Thanks in advance

Subject: Fermentation times


I am fermenting my first attempt at cider.  It is a recipe of three gallons juic
e and 3 lbs honey boiled in one gal water.  I am using wyeast chico ale yeast.  
It is fermenting slowly but consistantly.  I get one blurp in the airlock a minu
te.  It has been in the carboy three. weeks. A week ago I rack off to another ca
rboy and the cider did not taste fermented at all.  How long is a normal ferment
 for this stuff?  The average temp is around 70 degrees F.

Subject: Strawberry Cider


I just made a gallon test batch of a hard strawberry cider, and after tasting
it during bottling I wanted to pass the recipe along. It was fantastic after
only  1 month in the secondary. Great strawberry aroma and light strawberry
taste in an amazingly mellow cider.  I don't know the blend of apples in the
cider but I was told by the guy at the orchard that it definitely was a blend.
Enough rambling, here's the recipe (as best I can remember):


1 gallon fresh cider, unpreserved
1 1/2 lbs. frozen strawberries
1 1/2 lbs. brown sugar
1/4 tsp. grape tannin
1/4 tsp. yeast nutrient
1/2 tsp. acid blend
1 cup yeast slurry from a porter (I think it was originally a dry yeast)


sorry, no S.G.'s taken (I do that crap for a living and this is supposed to be
fun)


Combined all ingredients and pasteurized at 170F for 1/2 hour. Cooled to RT and
pitched yeast. It finished fermenting in  two weeks.  I racked and allowed 1
month to clear. Yield 3 1/2 quarts (I drank the half quart immediately). I'm
getting five gallons of cider tonight and will try scaling this up. This stuff
will go fast.


On another note, I have a line on a ton of choke cherries. Anyone ever combine
these with cider? If I don't hear anything I'll try them in a one gallon batch. 
Whats the worst that can happen?

I've got more information than that.  I had a gallon, to which I added a
bunch of oak chips.  It turned very dark and the foam rising off it had
dark gray/brown parts.  I also ran a separate half-gallon test, no oak, and
it didn't turn color.  I skimmed out some of the foam and part of the oak
from the gallon after a while.  As it fermented, it got lighter; it's just
about a normal color now.  I'm still puzzled but less concerned, since it
has lightened up.


I have seen cider darken slightly, as Dan describes, after being opened and
exposed to a lot of air.  This *seemed* to be something different.
