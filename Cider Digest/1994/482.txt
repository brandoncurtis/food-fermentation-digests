Subject: Contaminated cider??

  Well, I think I've finally broken my lucky streak and created a
contaminated batch of cider.  It was started on 9/10 by adding 2 cans of
 Seneca Granny Smith concentrate to 5 gallons of cider obtained from a local
orchard without preservatives.  Added 5 campden tablets, waited 24 hours and
pitched 2 packets of Red Star Champagne yeast.  Racked on 9/22 (SG .995).
The air lock's been bubbling ominously every few minutes ever since.
 
  When I checked it Labor Day weekend, it had a bit of scum floating on top
which I removed some of with a sanitized strainer.  More scum last weekend -
removed what I could.  Still more this weekend with some big (about 1 inch)
bubbles in it.
 
  I skimmed it once more about an hour ago and added 10 crushed Campden
tablets.  I'm not sure where to go next or whether it's worth trying to save
this stuff.  Any suggestions?  Anyone had a similar problem in the past?
 
  TIA for any help...           ...Tom
