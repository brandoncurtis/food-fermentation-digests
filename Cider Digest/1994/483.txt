Let's see: a ton of cherries in a one gallon batch, that'll be one helluva
cherry taste you'll get :)


But no kidding, I've done a similar thing, but first I made cherry juice
using a steam extractor, and used fermenting cider as a base. I added the
juice and water and lotsa honey to make a mead. It fermented out ok, it's
about a year old now and I haven't tasted it for a while. It was just great
early this summer, but I'm sure it's still improving.
By all means, give it a try and combine them with apples. I found that
I like it best when there's some residual sugar. Cherries and apple go just
great together.

Cider from a single apple type can make good cider. However it seems that
the best ciders are made from blending several varieties. Try 80% sweet
cider from macintosh, red delicious  etc, and 20% tart cooking shuch as spy,
granny smith etc. The actual varieties are not really as important as
getting a good sweet base with a strong apple falvour and hint of tartness


Later, rich1@netcom.com (Richard Soennichsen) asks about fermentation times.


I would expect it will take 3 or more months to ferment out your cider - be
patient. Check the gravity - you should get to 1.000 or less, especially
with honey added. Your yeast might stop a little higher because of the
alcohol, which will leave a nice sweet cider. Anything above 1.015 I would
consider a stuck fermentation and suggest you repitch with a good starter of
fresh yeast and some nutrient. But give it time, a typical slow ferment
might only change the gravity a point or two a week.


If you are fermenting in glass, you can shine a strong flashlight into the
carboy and see minute bubbles rising up even when there is no apperent
activity in the airlock. Study the top few inches for a minute or two.

In digest #482, Tom asks about the scum on his cider.


I have seen a thick brown scum on the top of most of my ciders. When the
krausen dies down it will all sink to the bottom. Don't worry about it. I
just leave it there, although sometimes I rack a week or so after it has all
dropped down.


I think all you have is little bits of apple from the raw unfiltered cider.
The best check is to taste a sample during feremntation. It should be sweet
with a little harshness.

I've been reading the CD for over a year now but I have never had a
source of fresh cider here in Texas.  (Pointers to such welcomed,
BTW!)  Almost two weeks ago I picked up three gallons of fresh cider
from an orchard on the western slope of Colorado.  I've had the cider
in my fridge since then.  I don't know what apples were in the press,
although I did ask and got a non-answer.


I'm looking for an easy way to turn this cider into my first batch.  I
would like to end up with a sweet cider---maybe I'll do half still and
half sparkling.  I want to keep this simple since I don't have tons of
time right now.  I've seen the discussions about natural yeast v.
campden tablets followed by yeast.  I don't know which way to go with
this cider.


Should I just dump my cider into a carboy and hope for the best?
Or should I toss in some campden tablets then pitch some yeast?  If so,
what yeast should I used?  I'm worried about the attenuation of Red
Star pasteur champagne yeast since I would like a sweat cider.  I was
thinking about using a 1056 starter since I've always had good luck
using it for beer.  Alternatively, I was thinking about using a sweet
mead yeast---like Yeast Lab M62 sweet mead yeast.


Should I fortify my cider with concentrate or sugar before pitching?  I
don't have an OG of my raw cider yet since it is still closed awaiting
a plan for fermenting.


Suggestions, ideas, or pointers to other information welcomed.  Thanks!

While out driving this weekend, I stumbled (no not literally :-) ) onto a 
winery which produces sulphite free products of quite decent quality.  I 
remember reading about people who are looking for these types of things and 
decided to pass the info along.  The owner explained that they are one of the 
only wineries in the world that carefully washes their hand picked grapes 
before crushing to eliminate the need for sulphiting to kill all the nasties. 
His prices are not bad and he does ship.  The address and phone are below.

Subject: Pear Cider (Perry)?
Date: Sun, 16 Oct 1994 18:38:24 -0700


Anybody have any experience making coder out of pears? Somebody just called
me and said he's got a tree-full of pears "sorta like Barletts, but not as
sweet."


I've blended a few pears into my apple cider when I've had them, but I've
never made a straight perry. Unless somebody tells me differently, I'll run
the pears through my cider press and use some of the working hard cider
gurgling away in my cellar as a "starter" for fermentation. I'm assuming
that I can treat the pears more-or-less like apples.


I'd expect to get a cider that's on the sweet side, but it might ferment
into something interesting. Since it's free fruit, I've got nothing to
lose.


Anybody want to offer any advice?
