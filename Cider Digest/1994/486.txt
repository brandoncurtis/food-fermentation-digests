I want to make an english style scrumpy and have two questions:
1) Should a make a yeast starter (like I do for my brew) with liquid ale 
yeast? Is that a waste of time?


2) Is it impossible to make a good cider if I don't plan to pick, blend, 
and press my own juice...I live in New York City and can't get to the 
country.
