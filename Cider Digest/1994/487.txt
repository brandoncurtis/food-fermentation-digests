                      Pear Cider Recipe Help
A while ago I read a recipe for making hard cider and flavoring it with
frozen juice concentrate. My wife is EXTREMELY fond of Wyder's Pear Cider
and I was going to take a crack at something emulating that. Please make
any suggestions to my guess at a recipe below:


5 gal fresh pressed cider
camden tablets to pasturize
1-lb honey
1pk dry champagne yeast
1tsp yeast nutrient
2 cans frozen pear juice concentrate


1 1/2 lb corn sugar


Add crushed camden tablets to cider. Let sit 24 hr. Add honey and pitch
yeast w/ nutrient. Let sit forever and a day (until fermented and settled
adequately). Rack clear cider to secondary. Add juice concentrate. Let sit
another month or so. Boil sugar in 1 pt cider. Prime and bottle.


Big questions:
 1) When to add juice concentrate? As above or differently?
 2) How to prime? Last batch primed simularly was flat though recipie used
5lb honey and produced 26proof hard cider!!


Thanks ahead for your help.
