Scott Majdecki asks for help with his pear cider recipe in cider digest #487.


The following should help:


   1. 1 1/2 lb of corn sugar for priming 5 gallons will make hand grenades!! 3/4
 cup will 
be sufficient for sparkling cider. The reason your previous attempt did not carb
onate was 
probably due to stuck fermentation (due to high alcohol). The yeast you used may
 not have 
been alcohol tolerant. Any honey or other sugar used in them ferment will not he
lp 
carbonation as it will already be converted to alcohol.




   2. I would add honey and juice concentrate to the cider before adding the cam
pden 
tablets. This way you will pasteurize everything before fermenting. 


   3. If the cider you use is pear cider, I'd recommend the addition of some gra
pe 
tannin. If it's apple cider, it would depend on the type of apple used and the t
annin 
levels found in it.


Good Luck,

PS - I've never tried Wyders Pear Cider so I may be way off base on #3 :)
