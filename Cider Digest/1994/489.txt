I have a dilemma.  I started a batch of cyser recently that used some
locally pressed apple juice with some cover honey added in for
strength.  It is a one gallon batch, nothing impressive.  The problem 
is, some of the juice was drank before I started, and so I had only
about 2/3 of a gallon, to which I added some store-bought apple
"cider" only to see (too late!) that it had some potassium sorbate
added for "freshness".  I knew I was in for trouble, but decided to go
ahead and pitch my yeast and hope for the best.  


Well, it has been a week now, with no activity.  Is there anything I
can do to save this batch?


TIA,


Eric

I would like to try my hand at cider-making this winter, but really have no
idea what I'm doing.  I have never made cider, beer, or wine, so I am looking
for someone who would be willing to hold my hand through the entire process
(via private e-mail).  Please contact me if you are willing to help.


Thanks!
