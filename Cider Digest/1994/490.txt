That shouldn't be enough sorbate to completely prevent fermentation.
I'd tried a new starter and maybe warm the cider a litlle, say to
75-80% until it begins. Next time RTFL, Garrison!

Don't panic! Yes, there's something you can do.
I've had a similar problem, "100%" juice, and nowhere on the carton that
besides the 100% it also included some other stuff. Well, it did. I had the
same problem as you: no fermentation. Sorbate doesn't kill the yeast however,
it just prevents it from multiplying.
I didn't know why the stuff didn't ferment, so I used the standard trick
for getting it started properly: get a good starter, add an equal volume
of juice when the starter ferments properly, wait untill you have good
fermentation again, and repeat untill all the juice is fermenting. In my case
this took about a day between each time I added juice. It worked however.
Be prepared to get some strange smell in the beginning, reminding faintly of
garlic (that's how I found out I had sorbate in the juice). The final result
was however not very good in my case. I don't know if that was because of
the sorbate or if it just had to do with the dubious source of the juice.
It fermented though.

Subject: preservatives


In digest #489 Eric Garrison wrote about sorbate in cider.  I made an
apricot mead once and the apricots had preservatives in them.  It took
me about five applications of yeast over two weeks, some of the time I
even started the yeast in warm sugar water, before the mead started off.
My advice is to keep trying.  One thing you can do is to start off the
yeast in with sugar water and a small amount of the cider to acclimate
the yeast to the preservatives, and add more and more cider as the yeast
grows, finally adding the yeast/ cider to your main batch.
