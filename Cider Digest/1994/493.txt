Subject: digest seeks new home

having founded and maintained this digest for several years now I find I am in
a position where continuing to maintain it is becoming increasingly difficult.
Therefore I am looking for a volunteer who is willing to maintain this digest.


The digest is presently set up to run on Unix systems although someone with
sufficient knowledge of mail could support it on any system they choose.
Presently the digest is set up to send only when there are submissions in the
queue, but no more than twice daily.  However judging by participation levels
(which are very seasonal) only sending the digest once per day  when there are
submissions would certainly not impact discussion.


I'd hate to have to pull the plug on this.  While it isn't an incredibly high
volume discussion group I've found it both helpful and entertaining over the
years and readership has grown slowly but steadily paralleling the increase in
interest in cider making, and I'd hate to see such a good forum end.


Please contact me directly if you think you might be able to support the
digest.  I can provide assistance and software (at least for Unix based
systems) for running the mailing lists.




        Jay
