For those who are interested, Paul Correnty's cider blend, as distributed
this Fall at the Wort/BFD cider picnic, consisted of 40% Gravensteins and
60% of a blend of Paula Reds, Macintosh, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious and
Ida Reds. He is putting together a small blend of 3 parts Rome, 1 part
Roxbury Russet, 1 part Baldwin, 1 part Rhode Island Greening, 3 parts
Winesap and 3 parts of a blend of Gravenstein, Red Delicious, Macintosh and
Spencer (a cross between a Mac and a Golden Delicious).


The first blend came in at 1.045 and the natural yeast was very slow to get
started but finally took off OK. The second blend gets picked up on
Saturday. Sorry, it's not generally available but I will report my results
here for those that may be interested.


I can't believe that I'm actually making 30 gallons of cider and cyser this
year. Well, 29 gallons of cider/cyser and one gallon of cider vinegar (on
purpose, really).
