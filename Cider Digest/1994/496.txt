I have read Proulx's book.  In it she talks about pasteurizing cider if you
wish to add sugar at the end of the fermentation to create a sweeter beverage
but not have exploding bottles.  But she isn't very clear as to how long one
might boil the bottles or after how many days of bottle priming to do this.


So,


1. how much additional sugar beyond priming sugar should I add at bottling to
have a medium-dry cider?


2. how long should I let the bottles ferment before killing the yeast through
boiling?


3. how long do I need to boil the bottles to kill the yeast?


If anyone has an answer for this novice, I would appreciate it. Thanks.
