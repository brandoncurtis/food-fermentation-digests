I have 20 gallons of wonderful custom blended and fresh pressed cider
fermenting in my cellar.  Two carboys were pitched with an ale yeast and two
were treated with a single Campden tablet each and allowed to ferment on the
wild yeast.


While all four carboys are fermenting actively, they all _reek_ of rotten
eggs.  My question is this:  is this cider going to be any good?  What can I
do to solve this problem?
