relax.  Almost every cider I've made with wild yeast vented sulfur at some
point.  Just let it keep fermenting.  The sulfur gets scrubbed with the carbon
dioxide rather than staying in the cider.  Give it several weeks before
panicking.

Subject: sweetening cider after it ferments.


In Cider Digest #497 Scott talks about sweetening cider after it ferments.
I also have the same situation, I fermented 3 gallons of apple cider down
to .996 with Lavlin (sp?) champagne yeast. It is now kegged and in a fridge,
has nice apple aroma, but is much too dry! A local brew shop recommended
"stabilizer crystals" which are supposed to kill the yeast when the cider
(or wine) has fermented down to your taste. I'm going to add some to my
cider to kill the yeast and then add a little corn sugar to bring the 
sweetness back up. Anybody else every do this??? Comments or (gasp) flames
welcome. I'll let you know how it works.

Of course I must apologize.  Although my "cider problems" entry was correctly 
placed, the Woodruff entry was (or at least should have been) intended for 
the Mead-Lovers digest.  Sorry 'bout that...


Gotta go easier on the bottles of mead/cider/homebrew while reading the 
digests...

Concerning rotten eggs -- just wait.  Initially, some yeasts produce a
fair amount of sulpher, but this gets scrubbed out in the fermentation
process.


(I mean 'sulpher aroma' BTW.)

Subject: Rotten egg smells


SDD6 reports a hydrogen sulfide-like smell from his fermenting must.  I have
often noticed such a smell early in the primary ferment, with and without
Campden tablets, although not at "reeking" levels.  In my own case, this 
has always dissipated almost completely by first racking and entirely by March
or April when I bottle.  I would hang on for a while and hope for the best, 
especially if the ferment is strong and everything else is OK.  Let us know
what happens.


By the way, when I use metabisulfite, it's one tablet per gallon, not per
carboy.
