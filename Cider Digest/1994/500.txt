I started a cider about a month ago.  I racked it once, but had to leave
town for sometime and was unable to rack again.  It was still active, but
I did not worry about it because I was sure it got infected.  My last two
batches of beer made in the same manner and with the same equipment have
been infected and I assumed the cider would be too. :(  But thankfully it
is not. :)  But it has been sitting on dead yeast cells for a while and
has that bitterness from the yeast.  My question is:  Will this go away or
mellow out if I age it for a long time?  Or is it doomed to be a vile
bitter cider no matter when I drink it?   Should I bother to bottle or
just dump it because it is unenjoyable now?
