        I made  a batch of cider last year that smelled like rotten eggs during 
the ferment but turned out just fine.  I'm sorry that I cant provide many 
details.  I bought a cider 
kit at Boots in the UK during a year abroad.  Since it was only a silly 
kit, I refused to take notes.  Well, it turned out great and no egg 
smeel.   Good Luck.

  A while back I asked for help with a contaminated batch.  I finally got a
reply from Ron in Saginaw MI (rsielonski@aol.com) who says:

  I'm still fighting this problem, the campden tablets at least slowed it
down, but the stuff is still floating on top and an inch or so down.  I'll
post again later.
 
  On another note, I've got a batch that I made a month ago with 5 gallons
of good fall cider, mostly Macs (SG 1.050).  I added 4# honey and 3# dark
brown sugar for an OG of 1.096.  I used Red Star Champagne yeast.  It
fermented for 3 weeks, then stopped.  I thought it was stuck, so last week I
stirred it to rouse the yeast.  While it was open, I decided to check the SG
 - It was at .993.  This is going to be sipping cider.  The taste was pretty
harsh, but 6 months should mellow that, then I'll consider bottling it.
