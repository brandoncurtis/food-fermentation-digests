As Jay's note says, I've taken over the Cider Digest starting with this
issue.  Some of you will recognize me as also being custodian of the Mead-
Lover's Digest...I figured since I already handled one digest, it would be
easy enough to add a second.


There will probably be some slight changes in format of the digest, simply
because I'm using different software than Jay was.  If these cause heart-
burn for anybody's un-digesting tools, please let me know.


I expect to have information about a new archive site for the digest in a
week or so.


Many thanks to Jay for his interest and efforts in getting the Cider Digest
going in the first place and keeping it running smoothly for so long.
