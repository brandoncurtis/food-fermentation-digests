I just wanted to send in a quick note of thanks to Jay Hersh for 
serving as the cider digest administrator.  I also want to thank
Dick Dunn for providing the digest a new home.  I know Dick has
given the Mead-Lovers Digest a good home.


These digests are a great source of information and I feel that the
administrators often don't receive the credit due them for providing
these services to the rest of us.  I also want to extend my thanks 
to the host entities (companies, corporations, universities, etc.) that
allow the administrators access to the computing resources to host these 
digests.


Thanks!!!

I made a trip to the mountains in Southern California a couple of months ago
to pick up some fresh cider.  I was fortunate enough to find a place that
was pressing the very same day.  Fresh from the press cider at $4.50 a gal
(since I brought my own container).  I was happy to purchase a 5 gal carboy
worth.  
  I split off 1.5 gal of cider for a 3 gal batch of cyser and used the
remaining 3.5 gal for a cyder.  I fortified it with 1.5 gal of water that
had 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup DME, 1 cup of corn sugar.  The gravity was the
same as the unforified cider(1.048).  after a week of fermenting with London
Ale yeast, I added 1 lb of DME and 1 lb of corn sugar with a tad of brown.
I was hoping to boost this up to a starting gravity of 1.070.  \
  Well, to wrap this up, after the ferment was complete, I bottled some and
kegged the remaining 4 gallons.  I tasted the last few drops in the bottling
bucket and it tasted vinegary like.  While I am afraid I have an infection,
I was also wondering if maybe this is what pippen apples taste like when all
of the sugar is removed.  Can any one tell me if I have 5 gallons of cider
vinegar or if maybe this will mellow and become a nice cider with time.
  By the way, the cyser turned out great.  1.068 to 1.000.  A very clean 
taste.  Almost bland.  Carbonation will make this.
TIA,
Dirk

Subject: English cider-apple varieties in the US (fickle climate)?

Has anyone tried growing any of the traditional English cider apple varieties
in places the US where there are severe winters?  I'm mainly interested in
the bitter varieties that aren't normally found here.


My concern for our location here (right at the eastern edge of the
Rockies) is actually not so much how cold our winters are, as how fickle
our weather is:  Our last snow can be any time from March to May, so an
early-blooming tree would get zapped most years.  On the other end, our
first hard frost is usually in October, but it can be anywhere from mid-
September to late November.  The typical information for "which trees to
plant" is given in terms of "climate zones" that are based on lowest winter
temperature--but that's almost meaningless here; growing/bearing season is
what matters.


I've seen brochures from a couple of US nurseries that offer English
varieties, but I don't know which places are reliable (any suggestions?)
and I also can't tell whether these would be practical, easily maintained,
or more a matter for an interesting experiment for a serious gardener.
(I'm no better than an average gardener, and I don't want to end up with
trees that take a lot of care but only bear a few apples every other year.)

Hello, all!!


Is it too late to find any "unpreserved" cider anywhere?  I'm thinking 
about the farmer's market....


If anyone has any ideas, let me know.  Thanks!


Jason

Ray,
 
Got your posting on CServe yesterday and had to reply... about Hopping
cider.  I tried it and it worked well.  My thought process went something
like this:
     - I'm not sure I can brew cider strong enough to be self sterilizing
     - I'm using a beer yeast anyway and adding malt extract to beef up
       the final sweetness
     - So what the heck, I'll try hopping it.
 
I can't find my notes, but I beleive that I used 1 lb of dry malt extract
for 5 gal of cider (all boiled 1/2 hour for sterilization), 2 oz of some
mellow hops like goldings, and Wyeast 1007, German Ale Yeast.
 
The result was something fairly sweet, not bitter at all, and enjoyed by
everyone who tried it.
 
Have fun
