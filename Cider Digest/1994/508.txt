Chris Cesar: I've made root beer with corn sugar and it is great.  But, like
you I have wanted to make soft drinks with nutrasweet.  In a 4 gallon batch,
how much nutrasweet do you add initially, an how much corn sugar do you add
for priming?  The resipe on the box says 8 cups of sugar are needed for the
batch.  How much is for priming?


BTW, thanks for all the great ideas on sweetening cider.  This was very
helpful to me.

Sorry for the delay in posting.  I'm about a week behind in all of my digests.


A couple of sources to check on the hardiness of various apple varieties
would be the Colorado State University Extension (specific for Boulder or any
other location in CO) Service.  They have offices in most of the major cities
in the state.  You can find their number in the phonebook.  In Colorado Springs,
they are listed in both the white pages and the blue State Gov't pages.


The second source (valid for the Western US) would be to check the
Sunset Gardening book (not its real name, but I'm at the office).  They
will list numerous varieties along with their climatic zones.  I would
think that they would have some English varieties included.  If you don't
have the Sunset book, you can find them at most gardening shops, nurseries,
book stores, libraries, etc.


Hope this helps.

Several days ago I bottled my first batch of cider.  I used my homebrewing 
bottle filler (which is one of those simple plastic tubes with a metal plug 
at the end), and had a really difficult time keeping the cider from 
occasionally bubbling and foaming while it was going into the bottles. 


I've never had this problem with homebrew, so was wondering if this was a 
result of having used a champagne yeast (Red Star), bottling a low gravity 
liquid (it was 0.98), or if this was normal.  The cider had finished primary 
fermentation in mid October, and had been sitting in the secondary for almost 
two months with no activity.


Will this affect the taste?  Thanks for your insights!

The best source of information on available cider apple varieties is: Fruit,
berry, and nut inventory: an inventory of nursery catalogs listing all fruit,
berry, and nut varieties available by mail order in the United States. It was
edited by Joanne Thuente and published in Decorah, Iowa, by Seed Saver
Publications in 1993.  This edition listed 1000+ apple varieties giving brief
descriptions, histories and uses of many. It also listed several hundred
varieties of pears, including many traditional perry varieties. If an apple
variety is unavailable (after an exhaustive search of commercial sources) the
USDA apple germplasm repository at the New York State Agricultural Experiment
Station in Geneva, NY, may have it in their collection of 1200+ varieties. I
work at the NYSAES and could check at the repository. Generally, bud wood is
available only to researchers, but something could probably be worked out.

MANY thanks to several folks for pointing me at sources for info for
English cider varieties...and sorry for not acknowledging sooner.  (The
substance called "free time" seems to be a mythical quantity these days.)


prh4@cornell.edu (Peter R. Hoover) mentioned, among others, Golden and
Roxbury Russet.  From the notes I've studied, it seems like Roxbury Russet
would be a good candidate for me.  Anyone have experience with these?


Greg Appleyard [appropriate name!] <gappleya@uoguelph.ca> mentioned:

Our problem is not how far north we are(n't), but the erratic climate.
If you compare us to Europe, I think Boulder is at about the same latitude
as Madrid.  But we're also high; I forget the magic formula that claims to
convert the effect of altitude into the effect of moving north.  Still, the
problem is that we commonly have daytime highs into the low 80s (F) in
February, two or three months before the last snow...so plants sometimes
wake up before they should, and if they're not constitutionally late
sleepers they'll try to bloom long before it's safe to do so.  If I could
specify a trait, it would be a tree that doesn't think about blooming until
it's had ten days without frost...

I haven't had a chance to contact the NYSAES yet; I'll post something when
I do and get some info.

I've checked with them; no info so far--although the fruit and wine country
in Colorado is on the other (west) side of the Rockies.
