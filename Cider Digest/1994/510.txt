I have a really nice dry apple cider.  The taste is right on.  Trouble is,
its not carbonated enough to my liking.  I added 1/2 cup of corn sugar
(boiled in water) to the 5 gallon batch at bottling.  I have a hard time
finding a place in the house that stays above 60 degrees F.  Can I add sugar
to the bottles and recap for added carbonation or should I leave well enough
alone?  


Also, The cider is a bit cloudy.  I used sulphites in the past and always
produced clear cider.  I used no sulphites this time and its cloudy.  Does it
just take longer to clear without sulphites? 


If anyone has an idea about re-carbonation or the cloudy cider problem, I'd
appreciate your post on the Digest.  Or you can e-mail me.  Thanks - LOU

I'm 2 months into the process of making a 3 gallons of cyser.
I racked it to a tertiary vessel two nights ago.
To eliminate head space in the tertiary, I added some unfermented apple cider.
I thought the cider I added was 100% cider, but it turns out that it contains
Potassium Sorbate.


Prior to racking, the cyser was somewhat opaque.
One day after racking & adding the cider (that contains potassium sorbate),
the cyser became much much clearer, with a very appreciable amount of stuff
that has fallen out of solution (and is resting on the bottom of the carboy).


Is this stuff yeast, etc.?
Did the potassium sorbate kill the remaining yeast?
Is there anything I should do to ensure my cyser is not completely ruined
(ie., bottle)? 




Thanks for any help.

The Cider Digest is moving to a new email address within the next month.
I'll still be taking care of it; this is just a domain change.  If you
maintain any sort of FAQ, list-of-lists, or the like, that lists this
digest, please get in touch with me.


The old address will remain active for a while...I expect several months of
overlap; I'd just like to get all the info out on the net ready to tune
into the new address as soon as possible.


thanx,
