I hope I'm not repeating bandwidth, but, Jan. issue of Mother Earth News
has  articles on beer, cider and wine making. It also gives a list of good
cider apples and sources for apple presses.

In digest #510, Lou asks if adding more 
sugar to his cider would help. Well Lou, 
you really should let your cider carbonate 
at a warmer (65-70) temperature. I usually 
add 3/4 cup sugar, so you might get away 
with adding a little more. In my 
experience, cider is very slow to 
carbonate, even at room temp. This is 
usually not a problem though as it needs 
to age a good long time anyway for flavor.

In CD510, Philip DiFalco <sxupjd@fnma.com> asks about his cyser:


> Prior to racking, the cyser was somewhat opaque.
> One day after racking & adding the cider (that contains potassium sorbate),
> the cyser became much much clearer, with a very appreciable amount of stuff
> that has fallen out of solution (and is resting on the bottom of the carboy).


That will happen regardless of any extra additions of cider, etc.


> Is this stuff yeast, etc.?


A small portion of it can be yeast, but the vast majority of it is the apple
'sediment' in suspension. My cysers and ciders will eventually clarify in the
secondary, but when racked to a tertiary, quaternary (?), etc, will become
brilliant overnight. 


> Did the potassium sorbate kill the remaining yeast?


Hard to say, but by the time you are in the tertiary there is not a lot of
yeast left around.


> Is there anything I should do to ensure my cyser is not completely ruined


If you were going for a still cyser, then it will be just fine. If you wanted
a bottle conditioned sparkling cyser, then you may need to pitch more yeast
with the priming sugar. 


It does not sound like you will have a problem, though. You said you had just
'topped off' the batch with the sorbated cider, implying to me that it 
probably was not much. Just go with it. If it tastes good, drink it !


Cheers,

Hi,


I am getting ready to try to brew some cider, and I am looking
for some basic instructions.  I have heard varying things, and
I am interested in the way to make cider from apple juice that
I bought in the store (unpasteurized).  Could someone please 
point me to an ftp site, or book or just tell me how to go about
it??  How long does the cider sit in the primary fermenter (I 
will be using a carboy)?  Then what?  Seconday fermenter or just
straight to bottles?  Then how long does it have to sit?  What
temperature should I be maintaining throughout this process?


Thanks very much for any information!!

I have a small orchard near Washington, VA (about 65 miles from Washington,
DC). About 5 acres and 26 different varieties of apples. I am interested in
making (hard) cider on a small commercial scale. I have equipment, buildings,
capital, but no expertise. If there is someone in the area interested in
forming a partnership for the making of hard cider (I assume we would need
some permits for commercial operation), please contact me here or at
altonprs@imsys.com or write Philip Johnson PO Box 191, Washington, VA 22747.


Thanks for your attention.

Hi.


SXUPJD writes about a rapidly clearing cider after racking and
topping off with sorbate.


I have seen many times in my own creations that almost as soon as you
rack, the mead/cider/wine becomes clearer and a sediment forms on the
bottom of the carboy.  It almost seems that if you had waited an extra
couple of days, the stuff would have been much clearer and racking would
have resulted in a clear product without the sediment.  My theory is that
there is a continuum (sp?) of gravity in the carboy.  There is more sediment
in the lower part and less sediment in the upper part of the carboy.
When you rack, you take the stuff with the least sediment.  Then a new
equilibrium forms so that much of the sediment drops towards the bottom
and you have a clearer product.  If you rack again, you get an even 
clearer product (and often a new sediment formed almost immediately!)


As I understand, sorbate will prevent fermentation, but will not
stop an active fermentation.  So, if you use sorbated cider to
top off a fermenter, it should not be a problem.  Is there truth
to this? Anyone?


Hope this helps!
