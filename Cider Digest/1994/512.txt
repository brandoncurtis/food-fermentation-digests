Karen (and other beginners),


There is an excellent homepage set up by ericg@indiana.edu (still on
the list Eric?). Check out URL


   http://www.astro.indiana.edu/personnel/ericg/ferment.html


You'll find everything you need to know about getting started,
equipment on a budget, yeasts, sugars, etc.


Cheers,

If you are looking for a warm place to get a bit of fermentation, try putting
the bottles on top of the fridge.  This is often the warmest place in the
house; I know my cats spend most of their time there, and cats are useful
heat-seeking tools.
