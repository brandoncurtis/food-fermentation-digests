I had high hopes for a cider which I began last week, but now I'm 
beginning to worry.  The cider contains 10 liters of apple juice (no 
preservatives) from concentrate plus 1 kg brown sugar.  OG 1.082.   My 
starter contained about 0.5 liter of 2X strength apple juice to which I 
added 1/4 pkg Red Star Cote des Blancs wine yeast.  The starter grew 
fine, and by 24 hours after adding to the large batch, there was 
tremendous activity in the blowout hose.  So far, just like previous 
batches.  But previous batches were not as ambitious alcohol-wise.  I 
bought the wine yeast because I wanted a high alcohol content and 
champagne yeast happened to be sold out at the time.  I reasoned that any 
wine yeast should be able to get to 11% alcohol with no problem, right?  
Well, after 6 days SG was 1.045 and the bubbling has slowed down 
considerably.  This means 5% alcohol, 6% to go.  I expected the 
fermentation to be vigorous until at least 80-90% of the sugar was gone, 
not 50%.  Is this destined to be a very, very sweet 5-6% alcohol cider?  
Is there any reason why champagne yeast should be better than cote des 
blancs wine yeast?


Thanks,
