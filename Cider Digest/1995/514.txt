 Lenny Garfinkel asks in cider digest 518 
if his cider should have fermented 
vigorously for 80 - 90 % of the 
fermetables. Well Lenny, most of my wines 
do exactly as your cider is doing, 
starting hard and then a slow, consistent 
ferment for a month. I wouldn't worry (but 
then again, I never do :)  )
