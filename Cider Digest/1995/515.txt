Subject: What to do?

I just started my first batch of cider, and I'm worried.


I started out good...1.060 SG, and fermenting beautifully by the second
day.  I checked out the SG over the next couple of days, and on the
third day I hit 1.020.


So I tried to rack to secondary, per instructions, and it was bubbling
right through my fermentation lock...I waited over an hour for it to
calm down, but it continued unabated.


So back into the primary it went, for another night.  The next day,
fermentaion was way down.  So much so, that when I racked to the
secondary and attached the fermentation lock again, it didn't move the
liquid in the lock at all.  No bubbles.


The cider was still bubbling nicely.  No where near the vigor of the day
before, but I could still see plenty of bubbles coming up.  But still no
bubbles in the fermentation lock.  The liquid is not even moving!!!  How
can that be?  And what do I do now?


Help!!!
