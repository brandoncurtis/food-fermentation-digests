The Mead and Cider Digests will both be taking a short break.  The next
issue after this one will be in about 8-10 days...so don't worry if you
don't get anything for a little bit.  All incoming postings will be held;
subscribe/unsubscribe requests will be processed before the next issue of
the digest.  It'll just look like a long gap between digests...fortunately
they're pretty quiet right now.

If the cider is bubbling, there's gas escaping SOMEPLACE, assuming you don't
get a huge HISSSSS when you pull out the water lock. So there are several
possible answers:


        a) You have an incomplete seal between the jug/carboy/whatever and 
        the water lock, and the gas is escaping around the sides of the cork.


        b) There's a leak someplace else in the fermentation container.


        c) You don't have enough water in the fermentation lock, and the gas
        is bypassing it.


Fortunately, the gas escaping from the cider will keep any airborne nasties
away from your cider, so it should turn out okay.

I wrote in an earlier digest that I had several ciders fermenting on
different yeasts and they were all emitting a very strong rotten egg
stench.  As I had never seen this before on the West coast, I was quite
worried.  Replies from the digest ranged from "ignore it, it'll go away" to
"chuck it now".  I'm happy to say that I ignored it and it basically went
away.


In retrospect, I consulted several wine references on the topic of hydrogen
sulfide.  I found that it is a common problem in low nitrogen musts, as the
yeasts are forced to break down protein (which contains sulfur) to release
nitrogen.  The best cure is to add diammonium phosphate yeast nutrient as
soon as hydrogen sulfide is detected.


Vigorous racking will then volitilize the gas from the partially fermented wine.


All of this made sense, as I had routinely used yeast nutrient in the past.
This year I forgot to add it...
