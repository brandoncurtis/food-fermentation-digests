Subject:  Priming with concentrate

Regarding the recent questions on priming and whether concentrate can be used
to make cider -
I primed my last batch of cyser (4 gal cider, 6 lbs honey) with pure
unsweetened apple concentrate at the rate of 48 oz per 3 gal. After 7 days
it has a nice apple flavor, some sweetness, and a nice fizz.  I would expect
there would be no problem making cider from this concentrate.

Jeff Luck asks


"I'm also interested in a sweet cider but 
would prefer not to use
saccharin or aspartame.


Maltodextrin seems to be a good candidate 
for this use."


Jeff, another good sweetener that won't 
ferment is lactose. Maltodextrin can have 
an annoying "plastic" taste. I don't 
know if you'll be able to taste it 
though at the levels you would use. The 
English use lactose to sweeten some of 
their beers. I have added malt 
extract before fermenting to get some 
residual sweetness. This does jack up the 
alcohol however. You could always kill all 
the yeast, add whatever sweetener you 
wanted and force carbonate, but that would 
require a keg. Whatever you try, let us 
know how it turns out.

My root cellar's temperature is about 40^ F.


What's the best temperature for cider's primary & secondary fermentation?
And, what are these temperature extremes?


Thanks.

Hi Don. Saw you note on the cider-list,
Dont Panic! and dont throw your cider in the field!


I too have seen the white/grey floating scum that grows bubbles 
occasionaly. I am not sure what the stuff is exactly but in a couple of 
cider making manuals I have read something similar was described. It is 
an aerobic mold which cider-makers call "flowers", dont ask me why. It 
can handle the alcohol content of the cider (or beer) but will only grow 
in aerobic conditions. I have had it on one or two batches after I have 
racked and let air into the fermenter.
 There are two options to avoid this from happening, 1) purge the air 
from the fermenter with CO2 after racking, 2) put the racked cider/beer 
into a smaller secondary fermentor and minimize/eliminate the headspace.


The mold does not alter the taste of the cider (that I have noticed) but 
may make it cloudy. Yeast that doesnt settle out may also make the cider 
cloudy. To help with this problem, try bentonite, great stuff!
 
Good Luck
Greg

This may not be related in any sense other than the film, but I had a batch
of last fall's cider that seemed rather sharp so I decided to try a malo-
lactic fermentation.  Wyeast sells the ML culture in liquid packages.  (Go
ahead and tell me I shouldn't do this to a cider!  I thought it was worth
the experiment.)  Anyway, I ended up with a film a lot like you describe.
With time it's acquired a faint web-like or lace-like pattern to the film.
The cider itself is nearly cleared, and as with Don's, a bright color (not
darkened).


Of course, since the stuff is still sitting in the carboy, I can't say
whether this is the ML culture itself or something that got in when I did
the last racking before adding the culture.  It's had me curious for a
while now.


In any case, the advice others have given is wise: Don't throw it out yet!
Taste it, and give it a chance.  (Young fermented beverages of all types
can be deceiving.)
