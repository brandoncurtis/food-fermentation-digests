Subject: sweetened cider survey

There has been much talk here recently about the sweetness of cider. Some 
people want to stop fermentation before dryness and other want to sweeten 
the bone dry cider.
 
I propose a survey on the matter.


1) Do you prefer to stop fermentation to maintain sweetness or do you 
prefer to sweeten the cider after fermentation (or "I like it dry thanks" 
none of the above).


2) How sweet do you like your cider?
What S.G. do you consider too sweet, too dry, just right?




Send replys to gappleya@uoguelph.ca
and I will compile the results and post them.

A couple questions for the experts about my first cider batch (I'm trying
for a dry cider: 
1)  Should I use bottled, unprocessed apple juice or fresh cider from the
grocery's refrigertor?  (Both are without preservatives.) 
 
2) What's the best way to make a yeast starter (using a 5g packet of dry
pasteur champagne yeast). What temp should the starter - and the cider -
ferment at?  Do I need to use an airlock in the starter?
