In the book "Sweet and Hard Cider" by Annie Prolux (and somebody else - I forget
who) this method is mentioned.  It says to immerse the bottles (standing up) in
water and bring the water to a boil.  Boil for 60 seconds, then take off the
heat and remove the bottles laying them down on a towel to cool.  They make a
point of saying not to let the bottles touch while cooling, I don't know why.  I
haven't had a chance to try this method, and I am also concerned about glass
grenades.  Has anyone out there tried this method?


I also read somewhere that to pasturize, one need not boil the bottles, but
bring them up to about 140 F for a short time.  I remember several temperatures
were mentioned, the higher the temp, the shorter the time it takes to pasturize.
I figure, the lower the temp, the less chance for an explosion, but the longer
it has to stay at that temp, so it may change the taste.  Any opinions?

Greetings.


Leonard Garfinkel asks about sweetening a fermented cider at bottling and 
preventing the bottles from exploding.  One possible way to do this is to 
take the bottles and put them in a canning jar with water.  Also have a 
"dummy" bottle in the water.  This bottle should be filled with water and 
corked with a cork or stopper with a probe type thermometer going through 
the stopper and into the liquid in the bottle.  The thermometer guage 
will then indicate the temperature of the liquid IN THE BOTTLE not in the 
water bath.  Anyhow, bring up the heat slowly until the thermometer in 
the dummy bottle reads 170 degrees F.  This should pasturize the cider.


Of course, if you want a sparkling cider, you should wait until the cider 
is sufficiently carbonated before pasturizing.


Hope this helps.

Good cider from clean presses will begin to ferment naturally under 
the same conditions that yours underwent. If your jugs have already 
begun to bubble and froth, and they smell fruity, then I'd expect 
everything's fine. Let the beasties do their work, and you'll have a 
sweet-tasting, lightly alcohol drink in no time.

I have a question about preparing cider prior to fermentation.  I want to
kill off any wild yeasts and use store-boughts - I want to try something
more sure and stable before I go for a natural product.  However, I know
many of my friends are allergic to Sulfites, and cannot tolerate any drink
with them in it.


My question is this - what's the best non-chemical way to sterilize cider?
I thought of boiling, but that will probably take out some flavor.  Would
pasturization work?  How hot, and how long?  Any other ideas?  (I know this
is a many-answered question - people still debate boiling Honey, and there
are people who claim both sides is the only way.)  Please keep in mind not
everyone has access to something like a filtration system - I'm a beginning
homebrewer with a stove, some simple chemicals and nutirents, and a glass carboy
.
