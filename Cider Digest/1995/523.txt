As I understand it, the initial application of sulfite to the juice
doesn't contribute much, if any, sulfite to the final product because
the sulfite goes out of the juice over time. (I forget if it just goes
into the atmosphere, or breaks down into other compounds).  Anyway,
according to my books, the final concentration of sulfite should be
very low by the time the product is consumed.


I make my cider and wine with only the initial sulphiting.  My mother,
who is asthmatic (sulfites trigger asthma) and allergic to pretty much
everything, has no problems when she drinks my wine whereas drinking
commercial wine causes her a lot of problems.

I've never done anything other than pitching enough yeast to overpower the
natural beasties - e.g. 1 or 2 cups of relatively thick yeast slurry. Of
course, the ciders had been frozen prior to my using them - that could
weaken any wild yeasts that may have been present (but I'll yield to the
digest's experts on that point).


My ciders have done pretty well in local competitions, and this is an easy
method, as long as you're patient enough to build up your yeast starters.
YMMV.

You actually *share* your cider? I say let 'em make their own. :-) 
But if you insist on being kind to your fellow man/woman, you won't 
have to do much more than pitch your store-bought yeast. Generally, 
wine yeasts are much more resilient than their wild cousins; when the two 
battle it out in a carboy, the store-boughts almost always win. There 
are other sources of contamination, but if you have clean equipment, 
chances are you can make a tasty product sans chemicals.

Forgive me for repeating, but I really want to know what the 
technique is for force carbonation. Until now I've always thrown in 
more sugar at bottling time to naturally carbonate. Thing is, 
squimish drinkers generally shun the resulting sediment (however 
little it may be). And I don't feel I have much control over the 
resulting carbonation. 


I'd ask my local wine-making supplier, but I don't really trust him. 
(He once gave me a recipe for champagne that started with Welch's 
grape; he assured me that it would taste great, but it ended up tasting 
like Boone's Farm.... Anyone want a bottle?) Unless this fellow see a 
direct connection between a question and a profit, he dismisses it. 
Which leads me to another question. What's a good mail order service 
for cider makers?
