    A while ago someone posted a question about using apple juice to prime a
sparkling cider instead of using sugar.  I don't remember anyone replying to
this, so since I ran across an answer recently, I'll share it.
    Warcollier's "Principles and Practice of Cider Making" (1949 english ed)
suggests using around 20% unfermented juice to prime your cider with.  Of
course, this can be a little iffy since juices vary in sweetness by so
much.  Still, it's something to start with.  I tried it on a few bottles a
couple of weeks back, and none of them have exploded - yet.
    The text also says that the acid found in apples is Malic Acid.  If so,
then why do many recipies for hard ciders recommend using acid blend, which
is only 40% Malic Acid?  Hmmm.

I have tried making several batches of cider now but have had limited 
sucess.  I would like to stop fermentation before all the sugars are 
gone, leaving a sweeter taste in the cider. 


I was just wondering what the best way of doing that would be.  I have 
heard that Campden tablets would do it.  Well I tried that but nothing 
much happened.  


Please help, none of my friends want to drink the very hard cider I've 
been making so far.






Thanks in advance

I have been reading the latest thread about heat pasturizing your cider.
Is it necessary if you have used camden tablets initially. What other
beasties do I need to worry about killing that aren't already dead from
the camden.
