        If Acid Blend is 40% Malic, what else is it made up of? We
can't get "Acid Blend" here in Australia. Only the seperate acids,
and I've been asking for a few months for someone to tell me how
I can blend acids to make the same as "Acid Blend".

Subject: Sparkling cider etc.

I'm a wine and cider maker living in Victoria, British Columbia, 
Canada.  I've been making cider for a number of years from the 
local apples (and doing o.k. in competitions), but have always 
had the overwhelming dryness problem in my sparkling ciders.  
Not wanting to add unfermentables for sweetness, I've been 
searching for alternatives (I liked the ale yeast idea as I've 
always used champagne yeasts).  I think I found the solution!!
I recently traveled up Vancouver Island and 'discovered' a small 
cidery - Merridale.  The owners' name is Al Piggott and he makes 
his cider with European apples.  It's excellent stuff and even his 
dry sparkling isn't bone-searingly dry like mine.  He uses 
champagne yeast (Pris de Mousse), but I believe the difference 
is the apples.  He's quite outspoken, but knows whereof he 
speaks - he says don't use dessert apples or Macs, Delicious or 
any of their descendants (hence Spartans etc. are out).  His 
recommendation is to go to old orchards and get fruit from them 
- his reasoning isn't lower nitrogen, but that old fruit trees tend 
to have smaller crops, hence more flavor/per apple.  I'm going to 
try his method - especially the fruit selection bit (I know you all 
can't do this) and I'll let you know in the fall how it goes.
A couple of BTW's. 
He supplied a number of the trees for Washington State's 
orchard.
He doesn't think very highly of Proulx and Nichols. book.
He's grafting a German, French and two English cider apple trees 
for me - it being spring planting time up here, so I'll have 
excellent fruit in five years or so.
He's talking about producing concentrate from his trees 
sometime next year - I'll find out and report on it's availability 
when/if he does it.
Sorry to be so long winded, but I'm pretty excited about all this.

Campden won't do it. In fact, I don't know of any additive that will. 
(You might prevent renewed fermentation, but you can't stop one in 
progress.) The best--and surest--method is pasteurization.
