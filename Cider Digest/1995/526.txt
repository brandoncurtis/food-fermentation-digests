I finally got around to making some long-needed changes in the formatting
of the digest--stuff that has to do with the table of contents, initial
separator, trailer, etc.  I hope that:
  a) this will fix the digest for those of you using auto un-digestifiers
  b) this won't break it for any un-digestifiers that now work
Let me know (at cider-request@talisman.com) if the new format causes new
problems.

I've had good results using sodium benzoate (often sold as yeast
stabilizer). The best way to use it is to ferment completely out,
add the sodium benzoate to kill the remaining yeast, then sweeten 
to taste. I've done this often with meads (which also tend towards
dryness) and have never had any problems with renewed fermentation.

Al Piggott probably makes the best commercial cider of anybody in the
Pacific Northwest (and I don't mean to be damning him with faint
praise--it's good stuff).


But he's one of those "experts" who says, "my way is the only correct way,"
which is more than a little extreme. He certainly knows his stuff,and he's
brought more good cider apples to this part of the world than anybody else I
know about, but I think he may be overstating things to say that zero table
fruit is the only acceptable approach.

Hello all


I am a homebrewer looking to expand my horizons.  Recently I purchased a 1 gal 
jug of apple cider hoping to make a small batch of cider to see if I like it.
Can you hear the questions coming?  I'm interested in knowing if there is a 
cider.faq available or how_to_make_your_first_cider files out there?


I like sweeter drinks so I thought I'd use an ale yeast, but I don't 
know what else to put in.  Cinomin, spices,...


I recieved my first cider digest the other day and someone mentioned (sorry 
deleted the name) that they wanted to know about how to stop the yeast from
fermenting all the surgars out of the cider.  Would something like Polyclear
take the yeast out of suspention?


TIA

I'd love to be able to get my hands on some straight malic acid for making
ciders. I use acid blend (which I believe contains citric and one other
acid, which I don't remember offhand), but I believe using straight malic
acid would enhance my apple flavors.


Use malic acid and be happy - that's my recommendation.


Tom
