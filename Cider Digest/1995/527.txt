    Greetings to all!  As one who has become tired of emptying his wallet for
cider, I have decided to try to create my own.  I have no homebrew beer
equipment and just want to get started, not grow trees, and all that, but I am
looking for information in the form of books, anecdotal sources, whatever,
with the information of rudimentary equipment, average costs, and startup
info, so that after my soon-to-occur birthday, I can use whatever proceeds
thereof to purchase the equipment and begin to make that wonderful bevarage
which we all enjoy.  I thank you in advance for helping a new person out and
look forward to enjoying cider soon... Thanks, Peace, Will

The bulk of "Acid Blend" is tartaric acid, and while there may also
also be a small (5%?) amount of citric in there as well, I'm not sure 
on that, either. 


It [acid blend] is supposed to mimic, more or less, the ratio of acids 
in grape juice, although that is pretty arbitrary to begin with, and 
depends on ripeness, variety, etc.   In fact, a distant memory tells me 
that there are (or at least were) more than one "acid blend"; `A' and `B',
which had different ratios of the component acids.  I have no idea what
those ratios might be.


I don't know whether apples have tartaric acid in them or not, (I'm still 
a cider newbie),  but I'd use that as my criteria on whether to use acid
blend or a custom mix.
