I have followed the latest discussion on acid blend and am curious about 
why and when to use it.  I have made several batches of cider, (from 
apple juice concentrate, no preservatives--no orchards in my 
neighborhood), and the results were good.  Might they be better with acid 
blend?

Regardless of some opinions to the contrary that have been cited on this
list, I think that *Sweet and Hard Cider* by Annie Proulx and Lew Nichols is
an incredibly informative, well-written book.  Your local bookstore can order
it from Storey Communications.  The price is $12.95, and well worth it.

   Hey there, I;ve been reading the digest for a while, but this is my first
post.  It's been a real help for me, as I'm something of a novice at this
(I've done 3 batches, I also brew beer).
   
    Anyway, I've got 2 questions.  1st-  What exactly is the "acid blend" used
for, and what exactly is it?  


     2nd- To make my cider, I've been buying fresh, unpasteurized apple cider
from a health food coop I belong to, pasteurizing it (heating it to 170degrees
for a few minutes, not boiling it), then pitching some yeast.  When I used
champagne yeast, and added no sugar, it came out way too dry.  This time I
pitched a wine yeast, and added 12oz container of Seneca Granny-Smith Juice
concentrate for 1 gallon, and it came out quite a bit better (Though still not
perfect).  To carbonate, I'm just adding ranulated sugar when bottling.  I'm
aiming for something close to Woodchuck Dark&Dry (Amber is too sweet).
     So, should I be adding sugar instead of concentrate for sweetness? 
Should I be using an ale yeast?  Should I be using Champagne yeast and just
adding more fermentable sugar?  I'd like something with a respectable alcohol
content (at least 5%, pref more).  I know that it can be sweetened to taste
after fermentation, but I'd rather figure it from the start, and I'm vegan, so
lactose (unfermentable) is out.
     Also-  how long should I let the stuff age for in a secondary?






Thanx in advance

Leftover bit from a couple digests ago...

In a word, no.


You can't really get the yeast out of the cider just by precipitating...that
can get rid of enough yeast to get a very clear cider (although with a bit
of time it will usually fall clear of its own accord).  However, experience
with both cider and mead says that even when it looks sparkling-clear to
the eye, there's still enough yeast to continue a fermentation.


(It is possible to filter enough to get rid of yeast...but that is very
severe filtering that will also remove solids which contribute to taste.)

There are various blends of acids used for wine, mead, and cider.  This
whole discussion might be somewhat off to the side for cider makers, since
it's usually unnecessary to add acid to cider.  Be that as it may...


The three usual ingredients of an acid blend are tartaric acid, citric
acid, and malic acid.  You can remember these as (loosely) connected to
grapes, citrus fruit, and apples, respectively.  (If you've read the
ingredient lists of commercial candy, you've probably noticed that citric
and malic acids are major parts of imitating the flavors of citrus fruits
and apple, resp.  Botanically, all apples are in genus "Malus", if that
helps you remember anything.)


An "acid blend" as you'll buy it in a home wine/beer supply shop will be
made up of some combination of tartaric/citric/malic, but there's no con-
sensus on the proportions.  Here are a *few* from the examples I've encoun-
tered, just to indicate the range:
  * "winemaking blend" in the proportion 3:2:1 of tartaric:malic:citric.
  * suggestion for meadmaking 1:2:0 of tartaric:malic:citric.
  * "mead acid blend" in the proportion 1:5:4 tartaric:malic:citric.
  * various country wines: citric only, or tartaric only.
