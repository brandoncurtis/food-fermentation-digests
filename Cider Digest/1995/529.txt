Hello all,


I just created my first batch and I am looking for some feed back.  I bought a
gal. of unfiltered cider (didn't say unpasturized assume it was?).  Left it in 
bottle and took a large pot and slowly heated the cider.  Kept it at approx. 160
to 170 for 1 hour.  I took some water and boild 1/2 lb. light brown sugar, 1/2 
yeast nutrient and 2 cinamon (broken up) sticks.  Then I added it to the cider
which was still in the hot water.  Hydrated 1 pack of Red Star Champaign yeast.


Any coments on procedure or improvements in recipe welcome.  I have another gal
of unfiltered apple juice and want to work the bugs out on the first batch. 


TIA
