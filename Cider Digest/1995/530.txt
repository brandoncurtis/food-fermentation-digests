Subject: Apple Varieties -- how to identify by taste/aroma?

Being a "new" cider person, there are large gaps in my knowledge.  I'm
hoping some of you can help fill in a small portion of the void.


Largely out of simple curiosity, [but also because I've just made room 
in the yard for a couple of semi-dwarfs :-)], I'd like to get some 
info regarding the "varietal traits" of common, and not so common for
that matter, cider apples.   Now, having had only a smattering of 
commercial ciders, I may be reaching for something here, since I don't 
know that the varieties are all that different tasting to begin with,
but that aside...


I have the Proulx and ???? book, as well as another book on fruit
trees that describes apples, and the nursery catalogs I've asked for
are starting to come in, but I'm just not finding the descriptions
to be very inspiring, in the way that descriptions for wine grapes
tend to be.   However farfetched "cedar, tar and black pepper" may be, 
it is a tiny bit more helpful than "good cider apple".


So, can any of you help, either with personal descriptions of your 
favorites, or perhaps some course-like list of apple varieties and
commercial ciders that to a good job of showing off the traits of same?
[e.g. CiderJack --> Frobs' Orange GravenRusset, with a hint of...]
Pointers to published info would also be [most] welcome, as I rarely 
turn down the excuse to buy another book. :-)


Granted, a printed description can never replace the actual experience
of tasting, so to that end, I'm hoping to find a few sources around the 
DC area for cider apples this fall [last year I just bought pressed cider 
from the farmers' market] in order to run my own "tasting trials".  If 
there's anyone who can recommend any place in particular that stands out, 
I'd appreciate the tip.
 
Thanks, 


Steve
