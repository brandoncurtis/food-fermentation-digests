I have just planted a small orchard of antique apple trees, on semi-dwarf
rootstocks: 4 Roxbury Russet, 2 Golden Russet, 1 Winter Banana, 1
Spitzenburg, 1 Sops of Wine, 1 Cox Orange Pippin, 1 Granny Smith, 2
Calville Blanc, 1 Sheepnose. Anybody have any ideas, suggestions, based on
actual experience, as to a "proper" blend of juices for a good hard cider
from these resources?? I won't need the recipe for about two years, so
you've got a while to think.

Hey Cider folks!
     After that little nudge from our digest manager, I couldn't help but 
ask a question.
     Has anyone tried to make a blueberry flavored apple cider by adding 
farm market blueberry syrup (with whole blueberries) to a secondary 
ferment.  Or any other type of fruit flavored apple cider by adding 
syrup.....
       thanks all,
              bryan

After contemplating Proulx and Nichols recomendations
for cider made from Kingston Black, I recently ordered,
received and planted this variety, on MM111 rootstock.
The tree arrived in excellent shape and is already 
budding out leaves.


Sonoma Antique Nursery and also Proulx and Nichols lists 
this variety as being hard to grow. I'd really like to 
try a cider made from homegrown cider type apples, so
it seems that it might be worth the effort. 


Does anyone else on the list have experience with
growing cider type type apples such as Kingston
Black, or can you recommend others such Nehou, Dabinett, etc.




Any comments on the use of MM111 rootstock ?

Thanks for your message today that there have been no submissions 
recently.  I was concerned I'd messed up something in my ignorance.


Question:  I recently bottled five different ciders which I had 
started in early January.  Some were fermented with the natural 
bloom, some with wine yeast.  Each one fermented down to about SG 
998-1000, was racked at least twice, was fined with liquid isinglass 
and partially filtered before priming with frozen concentrated apple 
juice.  Three of these have carbonated but two are still flat.  Any 
suggestions?   Does anyone reinoculate with yeast at bottling?

                      (the maniacal professor)
                      
Eventually I'll learn how to use this damn technology correctly!!!
         But don't hold your breath.
