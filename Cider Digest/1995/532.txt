My first post to this forum....


Hi all.  My zymurgological partner and I have recently found 
ourselves interested in ciders, apples, trees  and all the other
associated aspects of this beverage having found that it only 
takes a few trees to produce an enormous quantity of fresh apple 
juice (or fermentable material depending on your viewpoint).  As
usual, we seem to be way more excited about the possibilities 
than our spouses.


Enough Blah,  Blah, Blah....


What I really want to know is are some of you into trading 
scions (much like trading yeasts I suppose)?  Or know of people 
or organizations that sell scions.  I have found a few good 
places that sell trees and have purchased a few cool numbers.


I know that it is way too late to graft this year, but am 
particularly interested in trading varieties such as Dabinett, 
Kingston Black, Tremlett's Bitter, Foxwhelp, Wickson, Sweet 
Russet, Roxbury Russet, Yarlington Mill, Medaille d'Or, Kinsei, 
Hunt Russet (the list goes on and on)....basically any highly 
regarded cider apple variety.   Eating apples are not a bad
thing either.

You bet!  Last Thanksgiving, my mother made an apple-cranberry pie, 
and the flavor was fantastic.  This got me to thinking about adding 
cranberry juice to my apple cider.  So I added two 12-oz cans of 
cranberry juice concentrate to a 5-gallon batch of cider at bottling
time, and reduced the priming sugar from 1 cup to 1/2 cup.  I just
used store-bought preservative-free cranberry juice (Seneca brand).


It turned out pretty well, with a pronounced cranberry flavor.  If
anything, the cranberry flavor was too strong, overpowering the
apple.  And it tasted nothing like the pie.  :^(   But that won't
stop me from trying again!


Brew on,

Does anyone have any experience with kegging cider in soda kegs? I have 
several batches and would like to keg them up. Any hints, tips, and 
suggestions would be appreciated.


Thanks,

Hi,


I need some advice!  I have some cider that has been going for
quite a while in the carboy, but seems to have stopped fermenting
and the SG is still too high to bottle.


The cider started out at a specific gravity of ~1.087 and is now
down to about 1.040.  It seems to be staying at 1.040.  I checked
it about a week before I racked it to another carboy and it was
at 1.040, and then a week later when I racked it the sg was still
at 1.040.  I think it has stopped fermenting.  There is a small
ring of bubbles around the top but no visible bubbling and the
airlock doesn't seem to be bubbling (although I must admit I haven't
been sitting with it for very long watching).  


I realize that if I bottle it at 1.040 I will be making cider
grenades, so I want it to ferment more.  I did use champagne
yeast, so it should have been ok to ferment out further.  It has
been brewing since 3/20.  My batches have been taking about a month
to ferment out. 


Should I add more yeast, or just wait and see what happens?
Is there any risk of contamination if it isn't fermenting but just
sitting in the carboy?  Thanks very much for any advice!!
