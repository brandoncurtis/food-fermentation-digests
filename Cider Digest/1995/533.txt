My first post to this forum....




What I really want to know is are some of you into trading
scions (much like trading yeasts I suppose)?  Or know of people
or organizations that sell scions.  I have found a few good
places that sell trees and have purchased a few cool numbers.


I know that it is way too late to graft this year, but am
particularly interested in trading varieties such as Dabinett,
Kingston Black, Tremlett's Bitter, Foxwhelp, Wickson, Sweet
Russet, Roxbury Russet, Yarlington Mill, Medaille d'Or, Kinsei,
Hunt Russet (the list goes on and on)....basically any highly
regarded cider apple variety.   Eating apples are not a bad
thing either.

My response:


I just planted my cider orchard (14 trees [4 Roxbury Russet, 2 Golden
Russet, 8 others] about which I posted a few days ago). No scions yet. But
a non-profit organization, the Seed Savers Exchange, c/o Kent Whealy,
Decorah, Iowa, maintains about 500 varieties of heritage apples, among many
other heirloom fruits, nuts, and vegetables, and is in contact with
numerous individuals around the world who do trade scionwood. Call
information in Decorah to get his number. Good luck.

Hi, Perry. I have always kegged my cider. Do you make and keg beer? If
so, do your cider the same way. I couldn't tell from your post if you
have kegged before.


The only problem I have had in the cider-making area is the cider comes
out too dry. I have 'solved' this prob by doing the following:


Wait for the ferment to finish.
Transfer cider to the serving keg.
Chill to serving temp (mine is around 45F).
Add a large can of concentrate to the cider.
Force carbonate at 12 lbs for a few days.


NOTE: Since more fermentables have been added (concentrate), cider must
      be kept at a low enough temp so the yeast beasties don't go crazy
      again.


If the above didn't answer all your questions, feel free to e-mail me.
I love talking about making beer and cider; to say nothing of making
and consuming. /////Brad
