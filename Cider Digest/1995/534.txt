I would be interested in trading scions, but I just
started my cyder orhard with two trees - Kingston Black and
Northern Spy. I won't have any scions until early spring 
or late winter next year. Would this listserver be the
appropriate forum for starting such swap list?


It would be interesting to hear from others about their
experience with Yarlington Mills, Nehou, Dabinett, 
Tremblett's Bitter, Foxwhelp etc. varieties.
and trade scions.


Another source is the Seed Savers Exchange located in
Decorah, Iowa. This organization is devoted to saving 
old garden variety seeds and the members might also
have cyder apple scions for trade. 
 
I know that cyder apple scions are also commercially 
availble from the Southmeadow and Sonoma nurseries.
I'm sure there are other sources.
