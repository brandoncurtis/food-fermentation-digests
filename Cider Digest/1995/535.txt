(It's not a listserver _per_se_, but nemminedat.)  Sure, why not?  It's not
as if we can't spare the bandwidth.  Probably the thing to do is to use the
list as a rendezvous point, then take it to email once you've located the
folks who are interested in swaps to keep the one-on-one stuff out of the
main digest.  If this swapping became a major interest, I could probably
work out some ways to focus/distribute the info here to make it easier.
Speak up on the digest if you've got ideas/suggestions.

Could I encourage everyone who contributes info on varieties to try to
remember to tell us *WHERE* you are?  (It's often not evident from email
address.)  I tend to get a bit wrapped up in "the climate thing" because
our weather here is so wacko (e.g., Feb was warmer than May has been so
far)...but I imagine many folks who want to grow their own cider apples
will find that the question "What will grow and produce in my area?" is
almost as challenging as "What makes good cider?"

Recently I started a 1 gallon test batch of cider.  It's getting near ready
to prime.  How much corn sugar should I use?


Thanks!
