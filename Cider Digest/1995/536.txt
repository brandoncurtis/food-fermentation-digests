I have a question about those who are swapping cider apple varieties.
What about the rest of us?   I am sure there are a few others like me
who have space for a tree, and would like to grow some of their own
cider apples, but have only a "plain jane" apple tree now.


Could we perhaps purchase/talk/smile our way into this deal?


Just a thought.

I would like to express an interest in the apple grafting discussion
proposed recently. What with trading scions, discussion of grafting
techniques and orchard keeping questions I'm sure we could keep a
discussion open and the Cider-lovers digest is just the place to have it.


I have just begun to venture into the world of apple trees. I have just
started grafts of Trembletts, Yarlington,  and Chisel Jersey. It will be a
few years yet before I have any material to trade but I am keen to do so
at that time. I have started 5 small trees (wild-winter hardy) and grafted
all over them. Time will tell how good a grafter I am.


I would be interested in trading for Kingston Black and Foxwhelp in a
few years time.




The moderator's comments about geographical location were wise, so I'll
mention that  my  trees are kept in southern Ontario near Toronto.
(A job assignment takes me to Saskatchewan for a bit, but I'm sure the
apples will grow without me).


Questions for all...                                       My answers
1) do you use grafting wax?                           yes
2) how do you rap (protect) your grafts         hockey or electrical tape
3) what percentage take for you?                  10-30%

I would like to ask some questions about cider in general from the aspect of
a homebrewer. Is it as important to rack the cider (must?) off of the primary
yeast to a secondary fermenter as it is with beer? What yeast strains outside
of champagne yeasts and the wild yeast on some apples make for good cider?
Thanks in advance

Well, I racked the gallon batch today.  It's been five days in the primary
and down to less than a bubble/min.


Turns out I need not have worried about the growing yeast cake.  There is a
dome in the bottom of the bottle, which combined with the inward rounding of
the walls made it look like there was far more yeast than there was.


There was definitely alchohol present, and the flavor was apple/yeasty.
 (Duh, considering the amount of yeast still in suspenion.)


Now to wait for it to clear!
