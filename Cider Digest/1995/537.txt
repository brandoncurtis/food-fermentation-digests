Before we all get carried away with the idea of a scion wood swap, let me
point out that both the US and Canada have very serious worries about
importing agricultural goods without proper permits. It can be done, but it
requires jumping through some pretty specific hoops that may not be
practical for the kind of informal activity we're talking about.


Therefore, I would strongly suggest that those of us on each side of the
border limit our swapping activities to others under the same flag. Will
make our lives a great deal easier.


Also, another source of scion wood is the tree fruit enthusiasts, who may
not be specifically interested in cider. Those folks (at least here in
Western Washington) have a series of events each year, including a scion
wood swap meet and sale. There are hobby growers who have dozens or even
hundreds of varieties in their orchards. 


And finally, it's worth checking with your county extension agent about
local or in-state sources for scion wood. In apple-growing areas, the ag
agents (even in urban/suburban areas) can find out what's avialble nearby,
and if there's any kind of research going on that you might get involved
with--if a research station is investingating new apple types for your
region, they may want to find some off-site locations to test their varieties.

Subject: Roxbury Russet?

Does anyone have specific experience with Roxbury Russet?  I'm interested
in both cider quality and characteristics of the trees.  I've read what
Proulx and Nichols have to say (which is what led me to consider this
variety in the first place) and some nursery/orchard info...now I'm looking
for a little more depth from someone who's actually used them.


About cider: Does this variety really work (as I've occasionally read) for
a cider by itself (no blending)?  Any notable or nasty characteristics?
What sort of starting gravity do you get from the juice?


About the trees:  The "numbers" suggest they'd be hardy enough for our area
(Boulder, CO--40 N and about 1600 m elev, rather dry, main problem being
erratic seasons) and able to produce in a short season.  How's the resist-
ance to fireblight (our most common apple problem here)?  Susceptible to
anything else in particular?
