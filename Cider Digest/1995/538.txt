Does anyone have a good recipe for a sparkling cyser using frozen
concentrate?  Real (fresh) juice is simply too expensive to learn on!

Dick Dunn asks about Roxbury Russetts.


I love these apples. They are weird in appearance, kind of a greenish
bronze, a little on the small side and with slightly fuzzy skins. They are
fine for cooking and eating and make excellent cider by themselves or in a
blend. A sweet Russet cider is very sweet indeed but delicious. Because of
the sugar content, Russet cider will ferment out very dry and strong so use
a blend of other apples or at least a yeast that is not too attenuative.


Commercial growers in the East have moved away from Russet production
because of their relatively low yield per tree. It is hard to find them but
I have a source here in southern New Hampshire. Don't know about scions or
the tree's ability to grow in Colorado. But they are great apples and I hope
you give them a try.
