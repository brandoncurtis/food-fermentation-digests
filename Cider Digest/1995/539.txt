Subject: Russett Apples

I have a "detail" question about Russett apples, and varieties of them.  A
couple messages on the Digest have discussed Roxbury Russetts.  Does anyone
know whether how similar these are to Golden Russetts?  I have a good local
source for the Golden variety, so I'm curious about whether they are a
reasonable subsitute for Roxburys.  Are there other varieties of Russetts that
we should also consider using?


Thanks,
/Don

Before we all get carried away with the idea of a scion wood swap, let
me point out that both the US and Canada have very serious worries
about importing agricultural goods without proper permits. It can be done,
but it requires jumping through some pretty specific hoops that may not
be practical for the kind of informal activity we're talking about.

Much as I hate to be the bearer of bad news, John Ross is correct about
the difficulties in swapping wood across borders. I have inquired about
the regulations for importing scion wood from the United States into
Canada and found that it IS possible however...


1) you need an import permit (available from Ag. Can. Plant protection
Division, permit Office, (613)-952-8000)


2) the permit costs $17 to $35 depending on what inspections are
required.


3) The scion wood can ONLY come from certain registered nurseries
that are on the virus index programme (call above # for list). There are
only 12 or so states with nurseries that qualify.


4) Importing scion wood that is not certified as virus free from any-ol'
orchard is NOT permitted. Virus -free certification requires a multiyear
process of meristem culture and is being done at one research station in
BC. Obtaining scion wood from Europe has the same restrictions and
must come from specific nursuries.


Shipping wood within Canada is apparently possible but for the health of
your trees and to protect the health of the apple industry in your region it
would be best to get virus-tested material from a nursery.


Therefore John Ross is wise in suggesting that international swapping of
scion wood is not only impratical but I would add hazardous to the apple
growing industry in North America. Free trade may not be such a good
idea afterall!


Swapping of scion wood is still a good idea but it would have to be done
locally.


Sigh.
