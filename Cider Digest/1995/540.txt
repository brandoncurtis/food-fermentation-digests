Subject: Wyder's

A new (to me) brand of cider showed up in the local store--"Wyder's".  They
have a "dry draft" cider and pear-cider.


What are the impressions of other folks who have tried these products?


I'd have to say I was pretty thoroughly unimpressed...they're both quite
sweet to be called "dry", substantially carbonated, and while the fruit
taste is true, it's more like simple fresh fruit than something that's been
fermented/aged/matured.  If I were to judge them as apple-soda and pear-
soda, I'd give them high marks...pleasant enough, just not what I want.
Considered as real cider or perry, they're too sweet, too simple, and too
fizzy for me.


After looking at the fine print on the label, I was a bit more put off...
the ingredient list for the apple cider goes thus:
        cider stock  (wozzat?  Is this the real-cider part?)
        carbonated water
        apple concentrate with natural flavors
        citric acid
        potassium sorbate & sulfur dioxide as preservatives
This isn't quite what I'd consider a cider recipe!  I'm puzzled at the
carbonated water (rather than just carbonating the cider itself).  Some-
how carbonated water followed by apple concentrate says they're watering
down the cider, then building it back up.  And the "natural flavors" and
citric acid leave me wondering.  It doesn't seem like you'd have to add
acid to a proper cider blend, and I'd think you'd add malic instead of
citric if you did.  Who knows what hides behind "natural flavors"?  I kind
of like apple as the "natural flavor" in cider.


Maybe I'm being overly critical of Wyder's, since I don't really know what
happens in other manufacturer's workings when cider-making meets industrial
large-scale processes.


Again, I'm curious what other folks' reactions are to these two "ciders".

Golden Russetts make excellent cider by all accounts. If you have a source,
go ahead and use them. See the descriptions of Golden and Roxbury Russetts
in Proulx and Nichols.

I just finished a batch of cider (from concentrate), that turned out
MUCH drier than I wanted it.  It's more like apple champagne than cider.


Is there any cut and dry answer as to what I did wrong?  I'm wanting
something sweet and sparkling; I'd like to get as close to Woodpecker as
I can.


This is my first batch, so any tips or pointers are appreciated!
