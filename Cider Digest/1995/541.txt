Some comments I've received of late indicate curiosity about the focus of
the digest, particularly the shift toward horticulture, apple varieties,
trading scions, and the like.


I should point out that the Cider Digest tends to be strongly seasonal.
Mostly, folks aren't talking about making cider now because there's no
fresh juice available (apparently we have few southern-hemisphere readers),
so the apple-growing discussion fills the void for now.


As usual, if you want to see discussion pick up on some aspect of cider,
you know what to do.

I know of at least one major US brewery that uses this same process.  They brew
a concentrated beer, and then dilute it with carbonated water.  The advantage
of this process (according to this brewery) is that allows more efficient use
of their brewing equipment, since they get a greater quantity of finished
product.


It sounds like Wyder's is doing the same thing:  by using carbonated water they
can stretch the capacity of their plant.

Myself and a friend made a large batch of cider last fall and we are 
having problems activating the primming sugar and I am hoping 
someone out there can tell us what we are doing wrong.To minimize 
oxidation I mix the primming sugar(regular table sugar) with 
champagne yeast,yeast nutrient and enough acid to raise the acid to 
.6%.Then we add 1 teaspoon of this dry mixture to each bottle before 
siphoning into the cider.Each time we have used this method we have 
very little or no carbonization.Has anyone experienced this before?Any 
suggestions on a fix to this?Or is there a better way of priming?

It's interesting that in the same digest that this lament appeared, a
critique of Wyder's cider as being too sweet was posted as well.  As far as
sweetening a dry cider, you can always just add sugar to it, providing that
either 1) all fermentation has ceased and all yeasts are dead or 2) you
prevent additional fermentation by some other technique (cold storage, for
example).  Try reading up on how champagnes are sweetened.  On the other
hand, you might consider altering your conception of what cider should be,
and give your "too dry" product another taste or two -- it sounds delicious
to me!.
