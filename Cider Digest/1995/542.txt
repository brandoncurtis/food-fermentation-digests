I've heard of beer makers doing the same thing...You didn't
mention what the alcohol level on the Wyder's was(I've never heard
of it, but maybe I'll look around a couple of places)--but I'd
assume it's pretty low.
Some beer makers will brew a really strong(say 15% or so) beer,
since it stores significantly better than, say, 2 or 3% beer.  Then
it can be diluted for sale.  I remember hearing somewhere that some
major breweries(ie. Anheiser-Busch and the like) even do that!
