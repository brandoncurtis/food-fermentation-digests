Concerning John Faulks' request for "The Art of Cidermaking":


I'm assuming that's the one Paul Correnty authored.  If so, I can say
that this is a well written book with very good information.  It was
the top seller at the AHA national conference in Baltimore this year.


I have a copy (autographed even ;-) and find it very accessible.


Now -- the reason why I say 'biased' is 


        1. I'm a member of the Wort Processors (the club in the
           dedication in that book).
        2. Paul is a good friend of mine; we drove together to
           Baltimore.


That aside, I mean what I say about the book.
