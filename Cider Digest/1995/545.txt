Like Greg Kushmerek, I have hesitated to comment on Paul Correnty's excellent
book on cider and cidermaking because I know him personally. But make no
mistake, this is a very valuable book. Paul completely demystifies the
process of making quality cider in an efficient and easy to read style. The
book is much more to the point than Proulx and Nichols, which I also
recommend, but which covers a lot of material that may not be of general
interest. Paul gives lots of recipes  and his enthusiasm for the hobby is
contagious. He knows more about apples and cider than anyone else I know and
he got me started in making and judging cider.


Buy the book, you'll be glad you did.


Other than being a friend of Paul's and donating a recipe, I have no
connection with the book, the publisher, etc.

I skimmed through a copy of "The Art of Cidermaking" by Paul Correnty at the
Planet Beer conference a couple weeks ago.  I didn't purchase it because the
target audience appeared to be beginning cidermakers, and I felt that it did
not provide much *new* information that is not already available either in
other books or via this Digest (except perhaps some interesting recipes).  If
you're looking for your first book on cider making, however, it's probably a
good choice.

A word of warning to those of you who add raisins to your cider.  When the time
came to add raisin to my last batch, I decided to use currants in stead.  They
were in the cupboard, and I figured "How different can they be, they taste about
the same?"  Everything proceeded as normal until bottling time, when I 
discovered that currants are just enough smaller than raisins as to occasionally
travel though my racking cane and clog up my bottling wand.  Needless to say,
bottling was a total pain in the butt, with much swearing and spilling.  Be 
warned!

      Hello from a newbie cider maker.  A few ?  First can anyone give a
good average gravity for apple juice for my suds
program?  Does cider require, or is it a good idea to use yeast nutrient?
My first batch was 18 cans of concentrate (sencea)
6 lbs of light brown sugar.  10 cinnimon sticks and 10 whole cloves.  The
yeast was Lavlin Ec-1118.  The O.G. 1.090, secondary 1.020, third 1.018.
this over a one month period should the cider finish lower?  What about
finnings and pectic enzyme, use them or not?  Thank you for all you're help
in advance.
