In my experience, fresh apple juice is usually around 1.05 +/- 0.005

I usually make my apple wine starting at 1.09.  My cider, I don't add any sugar
to.  They both usually finish at 0.995 or lower, (I sweeten the wine a little
with apple concentrate).  I usually use Prise de Mousse yeast, which is fairly
attenuative.  I use liquid pectic enzyme (5 drops per gallon) and have never
had to use finings for my cider or apple wine - its usually almost crystal
clear within about 2 months - much faster than most of my other fruit wines, I
have no idea why.


This is a personal taste thing, but IMO if you're using cloves, you want some
sweetness in the final product.  To me, a dry cider/mead/whatever that has
cloves in it tastes very hot and harsh - even when its a few years old.

Sales of commercial fermented cider are exploding in the United 
States.  According to Impact Databank, from Shanken Communications, 
sales have taken off in the 90's:
1990   115,000 nine liter cases sold
1991   172,000 
1992   223,000
1993   357,000
1994   606,000.
In Great Britain, cider sales account for about 5 percent of the 
total alcoholic beverage market, so there may still be alot of room 
for more growth in the U.S.


Please participate in an informal cider survey.  E-mail your 
responses to UJYC69A@prodigy.com
1.   If you buy commercial cider, where do you get it and where do 
you drink it?  How much do you buy, how often and at what price?
2.   If you sell cider, who buys it and how do they find you?  What 
do you charge, is the business profitable, and how did you get 
started?


Thanks for your input!
Brent Peters
