I am a experienced homebrewer, but new to cider making and I was wondering if
anyone knows the names and addresses of any companies that sell cider presses?
Recommendations on types, models, experiences, ect. are helpfull.  The only
company I have ran across so far is the Happy Valley Ranch in KS.  Has anyone
had any experience with that press? Please send info to Russ Kamzierczak
(74721,766.compuserve.com).  I am located in Eugene, Oregon so any suppliers
located on the west coast are a plus.


Thanks Alot,
Russ

Could anyone tell me if and where there is a cider FAQ or a *How to Make
Good Cider in 3 Easy Steps* type document? I have made cider once and cyser
once with good results. It is time for me to gather more cider knowledge
and move my cider making ability up to the intermediate level. TIA.
