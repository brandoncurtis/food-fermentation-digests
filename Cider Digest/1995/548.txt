hmmm, I was just browsing a homebrew site on the ol' WWW and I noticed
some guy used my email address to post a recipe!


I figure he got it from this list so he will likely read this note.


I'd just like to say that I don't appreciate his actions and to warn others
who may be more sensitive about their address that this sorta thing is
happening.


Just goes to show how open this electronic world is becoming....

Subject: Ciders in Cornwall

I recently spent some time in Cornwall England.  In addition 
to the gorgeous country side and rocky coastline, it's also 
CIDER country.


I prefer sweet cider to dry, so I pretty much ignored the dry 
stuff like "Strongbow".


Local farm cider or "Scrumpy":  I found this to be very 
disappointing.  Generally this was a still cider, that was 
very low on taste.


A commercial version of farm cider, (does that make sense), 
called "Scrumpy Jack" is widely available on tap.  This is a 
medium sweet sparkling cider.  I found this to be a decent, 
slightly tart cider.  It might be better cold, but cool is 
the best you can do England.


"Blackthorn" makes a Dry, CiderMaster, & Sweet cider.  The 
dry is the most commonly available.  The CiderMaster and the 
Sweet are both medium sweet sparkling ciders.  I never had 
both at the same time, but from one day to the next I 
couldn't tell the difference between CiderMaster and Sweet.  
The Blackthorn is a little tougher to find, but it was my 
favorite.  I found it to be very crisp, slightly tart, with 
good flavor and carbonation. #1!


"Woodpecker" is quite common both in bottles and on tap.  
This was the sweetest of all the ciders.  Not quite as crisp 
as the Blackthorn and a bit sweeter.  All in all #2.


"West Country" seems to be a Safeway brand clone of 
Woodpecker.  Very similar, but I never had it cold so can't 
make an accurate comparison.  The hotels don't have ice 
machines or any practical way to chill things.  The label 
indicated "3.5% alcohol.


"TNT Dark Star".  The label indicated "Premium quality, 
strong amber cider, 6% alcohol".  It comes in a unique opaque 
glass cylinder, 275 ml with a thick foil pull top.  This was 
a sparkling medium sweet cider.  The flavor was robust but 
also included a hint of molasses and rotten apple taste.  
This may have been due to drinking it warm.  It definitely 
packs a punch.  The empty bottle would make a nice vase.




                 -----------------


A short note on "Mead".


As the proud maker of one mead so far, (It turned out 
wonderful, like a sweet Chablis at 1.020), I looked forward 
to trying the Cornish Meads.


I only found two, both from the same maker.


"Cornish Mead Wine".  This was a still mead at 14% alcohol.  
It had a very very strong honey aroma, almost sickly.  It was 
extremely sweet with musty overtones.  I trashed it.


"Cornish Liqueur Mead".  Still and 17% alcohol.  Same as 
above plus a very HOT taste.  Trash.


These were obviously packaged for tourists.  Very 
disappointing.
