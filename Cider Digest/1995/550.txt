I remember enjoying some hard ciders, fermented over
time by wild yeasts.  I was wondering if theres a way
to spice up a plain cider base with cinnamon and raisins
without boiling and risking killing the wild yeasts.
Or, is boiling the spices in not a danger to the wild
yeasts?


Are there natural yeasts in commercial raisins?  I guess 
I'm trying to figure out the best way to cultivate these
wild yeasts to create a mild fermentation.  Again, I'm
going for more of a "hard cider" than anything over 3%.

I recently inquired about information regarding cider mills and recieved very
little response.  I also had several people ask for me to post any information I
recieved.  Well, the only info I was found out was about a company called  Day
Equipment Co. out of Ohio.  If anyone else has any further information on cider
presses, grinders. adresses, recomedations on types, used grinders for sale or
even build it yourself plans I and other cider makers would appreciate it.
Thanks again for your help.

I just noticed that the info that's going out to new subscribers is an
old, unfinished version of the file that's *supposed* to be going out!
(It's roughly the electronic equivalent of giving a long presentation to a
group of people, then discovering you had a piece of spinach between your
teeth the whole time.)  I wish I could say the cider made me do it, but I
was probably stone-cold-sober when I screwed up.


So, if you've subscribed recently and you're wondering if we really know
absolutely nothing about yeast or fermentation, or what ???XXX??? has to do
with legality...Sorry about that!  It's my botch.
