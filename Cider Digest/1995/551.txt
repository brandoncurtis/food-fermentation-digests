They're expensive, but Correll Cider Presses are among the best currently
being made. Sizes range from Junior (2-3 quarts per squeeze) to Jumbo (2+
gallons per squeeze), and prices start around $350 and go up from there (my
price list is a couple years old--they may be higher today).

**************** Cider Press *************
A few years ago I made a press.  It cost me about
US$20.


The bucket was made from a 7 gallon plastic pail.  I used
a 0.5 inch drill and perferated it at a 1 inch grid.


The frame was made from scrap 2x3 (inch) pine.


For the press I bought a 1 inch x 3 foot threaded rod,
5 nuts, and 2 @ 4 inch washers.  (one of the nuts is larger
than the rod and can twist freely within)


I paid a welder $5 to weld 1 nut onto each washer, and the
large nut onto a metal plate.


I drilled 2 holes into the washers and metal plate to allow
mounting.


The pressing plate was made of plywood coated in polyurathane,
with a 2x3 mounted across for support.  The large nut and plate
were mounted into the 2x3.


The cross member of the frame had a hole drilled into it.  The 
washer & nut were mounted on the underside of the crossmember.


The remaining 2 nuts and nut/washer were used to fasten the 
prying lever to the threaded rod.  The lever is a 2x3 with a hole 
drilled through it.  The washer is mounted on the bottom side
and the nuts lock the lever down from the top.

Subject: What Yeast To Use?
From: Jonny Miner <woof@eskimo.com>

I'm a newbie to cidermaking and am unsure about waht yeast to use.


I want to make a sparkling sweet cider and have read that ale yeast is 
the was to go. The question is which one? I'm a little ppartial to Wyeast 
but will use dry in a pinch. What can you recommend?


Thanks,

Boiling will definately kill any wild yeasts. I'd recommend simply dumping
your spices in with the primary or secondary ferment, because your must will
be sitting on the cinnamon long enough for the oils to blend with the cider.

So long as the raisins are sun-dried and are not treated with preservatives,
they'll probably serve as both yeast *and* nutrient sources.

I need some suggestions on how do reduce those lovely round apples into 
good pomace for pressing cider. Last year, we froze our apples as we 
acquired them, then thawed (mostly), squished with a wooden post, and 
pressed. This year we are planning on more cider, plus we only got about 
2 Imp. gallons per bushel (some of the apples didn't thaw completely). 
Some of this may also be our converted grape press, not ideal for cider 
but all we've got right now.
With freezing, they certainly squished easily, but we didn't have room 
for even an ice cube in the freezer until pressing time. 
        Can you buy an apple grinder, and where might one be found? We 
can't afford a large equipment investment right now. Any and all 
suggestions greatly appreciated. 
Thanks,
Maureen

Hi, Russ. When I read your original request I said to myself,
'Self (That's what I call myself), I'm ago'n to sit back and see what
kind'o response this gets'. Of course I hate talk'n with a drawl to
myself. I had just printed out a list of 800 numbers to homebrew supply
stores and something caught my eye.


Mayer's Cider Mill in New York at 800-543-0043.  I called and talked with
Dave. He had me fax him a request for the info at 716-671-5269.  In a
few days the info arrived by snail mail (home addr in the fax request).
They have a small grinder/press that looked pretty neat. You could get
it assembled or in a do-it-yourself kit. After looking at the info I
totally forgot to post to either you or the digest (looking down at
my shuffling feet in embarassment). Please forgive me.


That storage paged out --- New storage paged in:


I did a simple cider a couple months ago and don't know if I'm pleased
with it or not. I tend to like a sweeter cider so I chill it early so
the ferment will stop a little short of complete. My usual concoction
is 5-gal of apple juice and some wine yeast.  This time I used 4 gal
of apple juice and 1 gal of canberry/apple/white grape mix. Not a bad
taste but it's very cloudy. When I say cloudy, I mean it looks like
you've added some pink coloring to some milk. I know I have a minor
foaming problem due to a serving hose that's too short for the pressure
being used.  If you shut your eyes, it tastes just fine, but the look
of it will damn near turn you stomach. Anyone else seen this?
AN APPLE A DAY......................    Cheers, Brad
