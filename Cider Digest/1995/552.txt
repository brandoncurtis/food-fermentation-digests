G'day,
 
I'm a newbee to cider brewing ( and brewing in general) too. It was 
suggested to me that for residual sweetness that a stout or irish ale 
yeast was the way to go. Someone from the Uk-homebrew mailing suggested 
the Wyeast irish ale yeast (I think) would do the trick. I don't know, 
but thought to pass the info on.

I think I messed up the address, let me try posting again:

>>yeasts?


The whole point of heating is to kill wild yeasts so that a known commercial
yeast can be substituted.  If you want to use the wild yeasts, then simply do
nothing.  The wild yeasts will do their thing.  Spices can be added to the
unheated cider during the ferment, or you can make a tea of a small portion of
the cider and heating just that with the spice.  After it cools, add the "tea"
back to the main batch.

There are wild yeasts in raisins, but if you don't kill off the ones in the
original cider that really doesn't matter.  Keep in mind that wild means
unknown.  You can't be sure of the results and you can't guarantee a mild
fermentation (i.e. low attenuation).


My favorite thing to do during cider season is the following:


Pick up several gallons of fresh unpreserved cider that say "Keep Refrigerated".
The first thing to do is don't keep refrigerated.  Set it out on the counter for
couple of days and let the wild yeasts do their thing.  When it shows good
activity, (don't blow up the jug <g>), transfer it to a 5L minikeg and bung it
up on the counter for about 12 hours.  Then put it in the refrigerator for about
3-5 days.  Now tap it and drink.  At this point it will be sweet, sparkling, and
0.5 to 1.0 % alcohol.  I even let the kids have it at dinner.  It won't keep,
but boy it's good while it lasts.  Drink fast and do it again. 


Good Luck

G'day!


Just in case anyone's interested, the uk-homebrew homepage has a 
cider/perry page under consruction. There's some interesting stuff, with 
more to come. Check it out! (I forget what the address is, but you can 
get to it from beers,wines and spirits of the net)

I recently picked up a wonderful book on apples ("pome tome"? :)
by Joan Morgan and Alison Richards called "The Book of Apples",
which, in addition to a rather extensive catalog of dessert and
cooking apples, included a chapter on cider and a small directory
of cider apples.  I'd recommend it to anyone "into" apples in some
fashion.  Mine now lives on the coffee table. ISBN 0-09-177759-3.


Anyhow... 


In perusing said cider apple directory, I found that Dabinett,
aside from a generally good review flavorwise, has a trait that
seems to make it ideal for backyard orchardists with limited
space, namely that it is self fertile.  There was another variety
that also had this trait, but I don't recall what it was.


Given that I have yet to locate varieties that I thought I wanted
earlier, and that Dabinett seems to be ideal for my situation, I'm
seriously thinking of giving the other of my two tree slots over
to a medlar, and going with Dabinett for cider.


I'd like to hear others' comments, if there are any to be had, on 
the tree, the cider, or both.


Thanks,


Steve

The NY Agricultural Experiment Station has plans for building a small fruit
juice press, which appears to be suitable for crushing apple pulp (not whole
apples!).  The plans are contained in publication SpR 8, "Homemade fruit juice
press,  Downing, 1972".  The cost is 30 cents (US postage stamps are suppose to
be ok for payments under one dollar).  Mail your request to:


        Bulletins
        Jordan Hall
        New York State Agricultural Experiment Station
        Geneva, NY 14456


Checks and money orders should be made payable in U.S. dollars to
"Communications, NYS Agricultural Experiment Station."


Their list of publications is available on-line as a MS Word document.  The URL
is:


        ftp://aruba.nysaes.cornell.edu/pub/COM_SER/catalogb.doc


There are a couple other publications that reference hard cider, but I did not
find any of them particularly useful for home cider makers.

     I have about 100 pounds of French homegrown pumpkins and want to make a 
big batch(say 50 gallons) of mead and not have to mess with the strainer 
bag. Also I have never used acid blend, tannin, yeast nutrient or campden 
and not known any better. Do I have to use these? I always use ale yeast.


     I also am brewing a cyser(two gallons apple juice, 1/2 gallon honey) 
and plan on adding pumpkin after the initial fermentation like I have done 
raspberries earlier this year, has anyone done this?


     Thanks in advance for your advice and experience.
