Subject: wild yeast cultivation

After reading Greg Appleyard's great posting, I am all fired up about
cultivating some wild yeast for my next batch of cider.


In the past, though, when I have tried to cultivate out of the air, I
have gotten molds growing on top of the "starter".  I can see how if you
crush your own apples, you would get a high concentration of wild yeasts
from the skins to start the fermentation before anything else could take
hold.  I don't have a press, though, and generally just buy juice, and
when it is in season, "apple cider" in jugs.


What can I do to cultivate my own wild yeast?  Any tips from those that
have done this before?


Thanks,


Eric

Hi all


I thought I'd write to announce the existence of CAMRA's second Kent 
cider and perry festival. For those of you who will be in the UK at the 
time it's on Saturday 14 October from 11am to 8pm at the Museum of 
Kent Life, Sandling near Maidstone. Contact phone no. is 01622 
763936. The site is just off junction 6 of the M20 (Forstal Road) and is 
served by half hourly busses from Maidstone and Chatham. There 
will be a wide range of ciders and perries and also an oppertunity to 
taste genuine cider apple varieties.


Now to digress. I went to the Brogdale Horticultural Trust open day on 
Saturday 16 September. The Trust contains the UK National Fruit 
Collection which I was able to see around. They have 2,300 varieties 
of apples (mind boggling), the largest collection anywhere in the 
world. This includes a great many cider apples. Now here's the good 
news. They are open year round and sell their apples. There are only 
two trees of each variety, so there aren't a great number of apples for 
sale. The trees fruit at intervals such that there are apples for sale 
over 10 months of the year changing regularly every week. They 
certainly sell enough so that you could make a gallon or so of cider. 
If you can't make it to Kent then you can also get the apples at 
Fortnum and Masons in central London.


Their shop also sells apple juices. Uniquely in my experience, the 
juices are made from single apple varieties which are clearly marked 
on the bottles. They are unfiltered and unpasteurised, being simply 
vacuum packed to preserve them. All you cider makers who want 
good apple juices but can't press apples should pay a visit! It's a 
great place to go and see, I can recommend it. The address is:
Brogdale Horticultural Trust
Brogdale Road
Faversham
Kent ME13 8XZ
Tel. 01795 535286 or 535462
Fax. 01795 531710.


Usual disclaimer. I have absolutely no connection in any way with the 
Trust, they just impressed the hell out of me!

G'day!


I'm a newbe to brewing, (with my second attempt at cider just about ready 
to bottle).
I've noticed apple jack mentioned. Please excuse my total ignorance, but 
what the frag is apple jack?


Sweet water and light laughter until next,
Rabbit.
