 G'day!
 
 To those of you who personally replied to my question re. apple jack 
 (there was quite a few), and to any one who replied last issue,
 thanks mates!
 
 I'll have to check on the legality downunder, but I suspect it's a no-no.
 
 Sweet water and light laughter until next,
 Rabbit.

Isn't salicylic acid the active ingredient in aspirin?
Guess it helps against the hangover while you're drinking :)

According to Gillian Grafton at her Cider and Perry homepage,
http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/GraftonG/cider/cider.htm, "Apple juice cannot be
sterilised by heating since the pectin esterase enzymes in the juice are
destroyed by heat, thus the resulting cider will not clear."

Mike asks:
>Do I have a really "out-there"
technique?  Am I the only person who brews cider this way?


in regard to concentrating his cider.  The answer is no.  I have utilized a
similar technique with excellent results for several years.


What I have done is boil 3 gallons down to 1/2 gallon and add that back in to 
3 1/2 gallons cold cider, and then add an ale yeast.  This produces a draft
cider of relatively low alcohol content very similar to woodpecker or woodchuck.


Your approach boils the entire volume.  Drawbacks are higher energy usage, a
need to chill the post boil cider, and driving off volatile aromatics in the
entire volume.  Benefits are that by boiling you probably kill off all or
most bacteria, wild yeast, and other contaminants.  However I have found
that not boiling the full volume hasn't been problematic, the added ale
yeast always starves out competitors, so I believe my approach has some
minor advantages, but this is homebrewing and whatever works for you is fine.

Subject: Calville Blanc Apples ?

Like many readers of this list I'm planning to plant an apple tree specifically
for making cider.  I've been reading the Miller Nurseries catalog and noticed a
variety that I have not seen mentioned before.  Quoting from their catalog:


Calville Blanc:  The preferred cider and cider vinegar variety.


Does anyone know anything about this variety?  A hurried glance through Proulx
and Nichols didn't find a reference (though I may have missed something).


Btw, if you're thinking about buying trees for a cold climate you may want to
look through the Miller catalog.  It's loaded with old varieties, all grafted
onto hardy root stock.  Examples include Golden Russet, Sops of Wine, Cox
Orange Pippin, Gravenstein, Winesap, Northern Spy, etc.  Their phone number is
800-836-9630.

>I have never heard of salicylic acid being used in this way.  Can
anybody enlighten me?


I believe this is the active ingredient in aspirin.  It is a preservative
which has been employed for at least 100 years.  I have read accounts in a
compilation of Brewer's Guardian a London publication, from 1875 or
thereabouts, in which the French were trying to boycott importation of
Bavarian beer claiming it had been adulterated with salicylic acid.  The
Germans claimed it was rogue importers adulterating the product so it would
store longer.  Unfortunately subsequent years were not available in the
library's collection so I don't know the outcome although apparently the
French were  in an anti German mood and were using any excuse to try to
remove German products from their markets.

Hi, our access provider (Colorado SuperNet) had e-mail problems when I
sent this originaly, so I don't know if it made it or not.  My

I have been a subscriber to this feed for quite awhile and to be honest
with you  I have mostly just breifly skimmed over most of the articals I
have recieved. 
 
    I have never brewed cider before but as the season appoches I would
like a recipe for cider of the dry varity.  Preferably a simple one using
perhaps bought juice.  Apple's and apple juice is very readly avialable
around my area and is fairly cheap.  The are many orchards near me with
many varities of apple's and juice. 
 
  If you can help me out please e-mail me at the address below.  Please
remmember I am an idiot when in comes to the cider making thing so keep it
simple.  However if you need any help on how to drink cider this I do have
some experiance with. 
 
Thanx

Subject: Gunga Din
From: Ron Sielinski <sielinr@cris.com>

A new beer & wine store just opened in my hometown (Saginaw, Michigan, USA),
and they sell a surprising variety of beers and wines. And three ciders. The
first two are easy to guess: Woodchuck and Woodpecker. The third may be a
new entry on the market: Gunga Din Cider from St. Julien Wineries.


I'll cut to the quick: I was disappointed with the Gunga Din. It sparkled
like ginger ale, but its taste was mostly just thin. (Actually, it reminded
me of one of my own bland ciders, a batch of unfortuneatly significant volume.) 


My first taste of commercial cider was Woodchuck's Dark & Dry, and that
taste has become my goal in cider making. Now, I typed that last sentence
with some trepidation. I half-suspect that I revealed my low-brow tastes,
like the fellow who logs into alt.crafts.brewing and asks the collective how
to make Coors Light. (Supporting evidence: I read in *Beer* magazine that
Woodchuck uses a single variety of apples, which goes counter to everything
I've heard or read from "real" cider makers.)


Anyway, it got me wondering. I'd like to hear other people's tasting
experiences. What commercial ciders have you drunk, and what's your overall
impression of them? If people e-mail would me directly, I'll do my best to
compile the survey for publication (as difficult as the task of collating
people's disperate opinions will probably be). Considering the global nature
of the Net, be sure to tell me where the cider is available (or, at least,
where you bought the cider), so I can break the survey down to countries if
I need to. 


Cheers,
Ron

Subject: Cider Apples Available

Please read this carefully.


Washington State University's experimental cider orchard may soon have a
small quantity of high-tannin cider apples for sale. The orchard has a few
trees each of about fifteen varieties, including Michelin, Chisel Jersey,
Cow Jersey, Sweet Coppin, Harry Master's Jersey, and others. The mixture
includes sweet, bitter sweet and bitter sharp varieties.


The price of these apples will be $15 per bushel box (about 40 pounds), plus
shipping. 


This is NOT a commercial orchard. The proceeds of this sale will support the
WSU Research Center's activities. Please remember that shipping outside of
western Washington can be quite expensive. 


This is a one-time opportunity. One of the cider makers who normally uses
this fruit is not able to do a press this year. 


We are also interested in demonstrating to commercial growers that a market
exists for these "exotic" apples. 


Depending on the number of people who want the apples and the size of the
crop, we will try to make these apples available to as many people as
possible. Most likely, each person will be able to order no more than one or
two boxes of fruit.


If you are interested in obtaining some of these apples, please send private
e-mail to johnross@halcyon.com. Do not send a reply to the Cider mailing list.
