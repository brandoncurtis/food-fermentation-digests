A couple of digests ago I posted an article containing a traditional
local recipe for hard cider that contained salicylic acid.  I asked
if anyone knew what purpose that ingredient served.  Drbeer responded
that it is a preservative.  Further research confirms this.
Salicylic acid was commonly added to wine as a preservative years ago,
but is no prohibited.  Apparently it is toxic.  This information
comes from _The Technology of Wine Making_, by Amerine, Berg, and 
Cruess, AVI Publishing, 1967.  Do not use the recipe as posted.


Do NOT use salicylic acid in cider making!

      Hello I'm a relitivly new cider maker, one my second batch now.
I have been reading the cider and perry pages with intrest, which leads
me to my questions.  I have been making cider from store bought
concentrate, I know but thats all I've been able to find.  Do need to add
malic acid to the cider that I'm making?  How about tannin?  Will
i still get a malio-lactic fermentation?  Is it best to let it age in my carboy
or in bottles?  One this batch I am using muton and fision ale yeast.
Is there a cider yeast out there?  When I do find a source of apples
what is the best way to grind them?  Do I grind them seeds stem and all,
or take the seeds and stems out?  Thank you all in advance.

Hello all! I'm new to this forum, and am sure this question has been asked
ad nauseum, but here goes anyway: I want to make cider this year--I can get
fresh pressed cider, no added anything.


1. One type I'd like to make is with natural yeast. Can I simply toss 5-gal
into a carboy and top with a fermentation lock? (BTW, I'm an experienced
homebrewer)


2. Another type would use either Champagne Yeast or Ale Yeast or one of
each. Any caveats? And is there a FAQ somewhere on whether to boil or not to
boil--I'd assume that boiling would eliminate much of the aromatic nose, but
assure sterility. However, I like the idea of concentrating a portion of the
cider and adding that to the whole. What kind of nasties do you tend to get?
Lactobaccillus? Others?


3. When adding yeast, what kind of headspace is necessary in the carboy--do
you get the kind of kreusens that we homebrewers get? I really have no idea.


4. What about time frames and transfering to a secondary, do you  use
secondaries?


5. PLEASE NOTE: short, terse answers are both expected and desired. I'm not
looking to make world-class cider, only a crude kind of pagan punch.


6. How about the titles to some really good books on the subject so I can be
better prepared next year.


Thanks in advance, and I appologize for not getting it together much
earlier, but I've been spending WAY too much time building my new brewery
and I forgot what month it was;-)

>From my studies in organic chemistry I remember salicylic acid being the 
ealier form of the product now known as aspirin. I also remember that 
they stopped using it becuase in excess it can cause internal bleeding 
(usually of the stomach lining) and besides is wasn't a very good pain 
killer anyway.)


Thats my dose of phosphor for the day, enjoy!

With the cider season upon us again, it's time to start planning out what
experiments we would like to do this year.  Since I'll have probably 10-15
gallons of fresh cider after our little pressing party, I thought I'd try a
cyser this time.  Did one a few years ago from store-bought ingredients and
it was horrible.  Any tried and true suggestions?  Like how much honey per
gal, etc.  TIA,
