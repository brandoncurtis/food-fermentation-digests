I believe aspirin is acetosalicylic acid ... but I think salicylic
acid IS what they put in wart-removing medicine.


Someone mentioned that it is now outlawed in wine ... but even if it
weren't, there are lots of things used in commercial production that
are only safe if very carefully controlled amounts are used.  I don't
have that kind of attention span, so I steer clear of them.

        A little more information on Saliyic Acid or whatever it is. I'm 
into herbs and stuff, and that compund shows up in White Willow Bark 
which was an alternative for Aspirin that doesn't give an upset stomach. 


Well anyway, this is a Cider digest, not herb digest!


The season is upon, fresh pressed Cider. I was thinking about using Ale 
yeast. I'm new at brewing cider. Tried once, but failed. I have had some 
good brews, mead, wine. I wasw wondering what yeast to use. I have both 
Montrachet, and Doric Ale Yeast my box of brewing wonders. Maybe I'll try 
both?!


To that person wondering about cyser...look through the Mead digest. 
There is a couple of threads on cyser every once and a while. There was 
even a prize winning recipe. In their archives I know there are some recipes.

A note from the Digest janitor...
It's now been more than a year since I took over the digest from Jay Hersh
(to whom, many thanks for getting it going and keeping it going prior to my
tenure).


It's quite time to let the old x.org addresses die--they haven't really
been valid for a year now, and that seems like a long enough grace period.
When sending mail to/about the digest, please use
        cider@talisman.com            for articles for the digest
and
        cider-request@talisman.com     for admin requests ((un)sub, etc.)


Don't use cider<anything>@x.org.


If you happen to come across a mention of the Cider Digest (in a Web page
or whatever) that gives the old x.org address, I'd appreciate it if you'd
drop me a note with whatever info you can glean, so I can try to contact
someone and get it updated.  Thanx.

Hello!


Have a couple questions before I try my next cider batch.  I bought some 
pennsylvania 100% cider but it has potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate 
added.  I understand potassium sorbate is put in the cider to kill the wild 
yeast.  Am I correct? and will this also kill any yeast I put in this cider 
to ferment?  I also want to know how to maintain some residual sweetness in 
the cider.  The last batch fermented out completely and was nice and dry but 
lacked sweetness.  What should I do?


Thanks


Regards
