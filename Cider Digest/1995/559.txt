Hi all,


Well, this year's batch (56 gallons) is bubbling away in the primary
fermenter. Made from 3 bushels crabapples, 3 bushels incredibly astringent
hard pears, 14 bushels mixed Greening, Cortland, Northern Spy. Added two
gallons of sour cherry pits and skins from the freezer, left over from
making cherry wine a couple of months back, and 10 pounds sugar. Starting
gravity 18 Brix. Quantity way down this year, but taste is outta sight,
probably due to the drought we've had all summer. My well is still dry, but
it looks like the winter will be suitably wet. Happy cidering all!

I'm writing about cider for the Washington Post. Please let me know if
you know of any new ciders on the market since I last wrote on the
subject last spring, and feel free to give constructive criticism based
on the articles I wrote by myself and with Greg Kitsock on cider for
Beer, The Magazine, Ale Street News, etc. In particular, I'd appreciate
contacts at commercial cideries, especially the newer ones.


Is Wyder's currently being made? I know Iain Wyder left the company,
and I heard they weren't doing well without him. What are the new
ciders? Hornsby's (Gallo?)? Others?


Thanks everybody, Jim

Here's a newbie question. What is cider anyway? When you go to the 
supermarket, there is always apple juice and apple cider next to each other 
on the shelf. Both are non-alcaholic. What is the difference between these 
two?

        This is my first cider and it seems to be fermenting really 
rapidly. I have done sucessful meads, and I have a question. At the first 
initial two to three days when this started fermenting I smelled a faint 
hint of that rotten egg/sulphur/stink bomb smell. After about a week it 
has gone away and I can just smell alcohol/cider smell. Very weird. Can 
anyone tell me what this is? and what kind of chemical reactionc occurred?


                                           Thanks, Pete
