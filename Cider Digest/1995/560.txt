Peter Matra <stalkwol@cloud9.net> asked about a sulfur smell coming from
his fermenting cider.  It otherwise seems fine.


I have never encountered this with a cider before, but this is a very
common reaction with several strains of lager yeast.  My last Oktoberfest
lager kicked up a very strong sulfur smell for the first three days of
primary fermentation.  I used a Wyeast lager yeast, but I don't remember
which one.


You didn't mention what type of yeast you used (wine, beer, wild), but
yeasts kicking out sulfurous odors is common for several strains.  I
wouldn't worry.  Your cider should be fine.

This is common for most yeast during the early stages of fermentation...
obviously something to make you sit up and say "WTF???" but, fortunately,
nothing to worry about.  As Peter notes, it goes away.  Here and there, I
have seen it in beer, wine, mead, and cider...ecumenical yeast flatulence.


One thing you might want to consider--not from the H2S smell in particular,
but just general practice--if the fermentation seems to be going like gang-
busters, you will probably improve your lot by cooling things down a bit.
If your fermentation room is near a window or a door (and it's cooler out-
side than inside!), open up and let some cool air in.  The fermentation
won't stall or stick if it's currently going wild and you cool it just a
bit.  What you gain is a reduction in esters and odd tastes.  In most
cases, better results come from slower fermentation as long as the fermen-
tation doesn't stall due to low temps...you'll prefer the lowest temp that
keeps things perking along.
