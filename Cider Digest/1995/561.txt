  It's funny how I'm in the same discussion on the mead digest. How long 
do I keep my cider in the carboy? A month, two, or till it clears up?


Has anyone ever used ale yeast? I'm trying two side by side. One with 
Doric Ale Yeast and the other with montrachet.

Thanks everyone for their reply. The smell has gone away. I'm usually a 
lurker.

Hello 
     I have a cider (my second) That I just racked to a secondary after one
month. My recipe:
                        6 cans sencea concentrate
                        3lbs light brown sugar
                        1Tbsp nutmeg
                        10 cloves crushed
                        10 cinnimon sticks crushed
                        Ale yeast


Well I tasted and mesured gravity at .992.  The taste is very asstringant.
To many cloves I think.  What is the collectives opionion on adding more
apple juice concentrate?  Or should I just relax and ride it out?  Thank you
all in advance.

Conventional wine-making practice suggests adding yeast nutrient (such as
diammonium phosphate) to a hydrogen sulfide producing fermentation.  The
stink is produced by yeast breaking down protein to supply nitrogen, and is
most common in low nitrogen musts.  While ignoring it might not cause a
problem in the future, you might end up with a cider which smells like the
inside of an innertube.

I have been making cider for some twenty years and have just recently (the last
two years) run into a problem.  My cider is fermented with wine yeast and
nutrients to acheive 12% alcohol.  I then clear the cider a bit by gravity only
and bottle it with 1 tsp. of sugar per 12 oz. bottle to get a sparkle in the
bottle.  For all these years I have gotten just what I was shooting for; but the
last two years I got little of no secondary fermentation.  I lowered the alcohol
content to 10% this year thinking that perhaps I was killing the yeast at 12%.
Smaller batches (6 gallons vs. my large 55 gallon run) have done fine at 10%.  I
would love to hear from anyone on this matter.
 
On another issue, my partner and I make labels each year for our cider.  On each
we use a relevant work of art having to do with apples and a piece of poetry.
If anyone has any apple poetry or prose, for that matter, that might be suitable
send it along to this digest or to me directly.  I hope everyone's cider is
fermenting well by now.  The Philosopher's Cider

I was trying to follow Papazian's recipe for cyser in the book he
co-authored on mead. It says to use apple juice (I used cider) and put
campden tablets in it, then add honey and wine yeast (I used champagne
yeast). I was skeptical of the campden tablets, but that's what the man
said, so ...


So now I have 3 gallons of cider/honey mixture not fermenting in the
basement. I used fewer tablets than the recipe called for, but I noticed
that Zeigler's cider already has preservatives. What do you think? Have the
preservatives killed the yeast? Is this batch hopeless?
