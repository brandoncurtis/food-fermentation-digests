The following isn't new to the Cider Digest, but it's been long enough that
a lot of readers probably didn't see it the first go-round:


According to *The 1993 Encyclopaedia of Food Additives*, "Like sorbic acid,
potassium sorbate . . . deteriorates if exposed to sunlight or to
temperatures over 100 deg. F."


So if you ever end up with cider that contains sorbic acid or potassium
sorbate again, you might try heating up the cider to drive off the
preservative.

I picked up the following from rec.crafts.brewing, and it works wonderfully:


I print beer, mead, and cider labels at 4x actual size using my ink-jet
printer at home.  My artistically-inclined partner then draws an
illustration with black ink over pencil onto this original.  We then take
this original to a copy center, and have it reduced and duplicated to have
four labels per 8-1/2" x 11" page.  We then cut the individual labels to
size.


To adhere the labels to the bottles, we use milk.  Yes, milk.  Actually, we
use reconstituted instant non-fat dry milk ('cause it's cheap).  Soak the
labels for a minute or so, until the paper begins to absorb the liquid.
Then, place the wet label on the bottle.  Using a small, cheap paintbrush
(like the kind that are three for $0.99 at K-Mart), brush the outside of
the label with more milk,  and work out any wrinkles.  Let dry.


The dried milk will hold the label quite well.  To remove the label, soak
the empty bottle in warm water for five to ten minutes, and it will float
right off.


The only drawbacks to this method are: 1) You can't ice the bottles in a
cooler: the labels come right off when they get wet. 2) You can't use them
on bottles which have raised patterns in the glass (like Grolsch or IBC
Root Beer bottles).

Several people have given ideas for labels.  Here's my 2 cents:


I use a page layout or graphics program that handles text very well, such as
PageMaker or CorelDRAW! to design my labels.  For wine bottles, I put 4 to a
page (Portrait-oriented paper, divided into quarters), and for beer bottles
I use 6 to a page (Landscape, 2 rows, 3 columns).  I set up guidelines to
divide the page up, and put a border inside these guides, and fill in the
label with text and clipart.  I can then copy the label and paste it 3 or 5
more times, and print it out.  I use either white paper if I'm going cheap,
or parchment-like paper form the local copy store for fancier bottles.  I
use a glue stick or rubber cement to put it on.


Some tips: use the full page, and don't leave unused paper - it's extra
cutting you don't want to do.  Use the non-printable area on the page as the
margin on your label (i.e. - leave a .25" gap between the drawn border and
the edge of the label itself on all 4 sides).  If you want straight cuts and
need guideines, put in short, very light dotted lines on the guides between
the labels at each end - these will be nearly invisible when cut along.  Cut
with a papercutter, or an x-acto and a steel ruler on a matt (Scissors are
not straight enough, but I'm a perfectionist for labels :).


I have some files people can copy - ask me and I'll e-mail you a .cdr (4.0)
or a .pm5 file with my Big Red Cyser label on it.  (I went to Cornell, the
"Big Red", where I was indroduced to Woodchuck Cider and Home Brewing - It's
only fitting I give it some credit! :)


As for Ale Yeasts: I tried Glenbrew's Secret Brewer's Yeast, and I am leery
of the results.  It has a very medicine quality, and is so strong I don't
enjoy it.  Aging 5 months has helped a bit, but I'm not sure I'll use it
again.  I'm trying Windsor London Ale Yeast right now - I'll give a full
report and recipie when it is done.   Being introduced to Woodchuck since I
don't like Beer, I prefer my ciders at about ale / beer strength, as opposed
to wine strength.

        Well I just racked my cider and checked the SG and tasted it. The 
SG was 1000, and tasted very watery, no sweetness. It wasn't good at all. 
Is that because of the yeast? I can't think how regular cider that 
tasteds so good can taste so watery and nasty later on! Well I'm getting 
more cider and trying natural wild yeast and also montrachet or champagne.

>I have had a good deal of trouble finding truly preservative free cider.
Even the local orchard (Tices' Farm in Montvale, NJ) has been using
potassium sorbate in the last few years. I have found that I can get these
ciders to ferment with higher pitching rates. Extra aeration also seems to
help, although I don't know whether the preservatives are driven off, or the
extra Oxygen helps start the yeast in spite of them.


Meantime, anybody know of any fruit juices or extracts to enliven this
year's ciders?


I would appreciate any tips.


Thanks.
