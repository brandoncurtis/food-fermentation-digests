        I'm asking how to with the natural yeast. I poured my cider intoa jug.
It has no preservatives, just fresh pressed. Question...do I need to do a 
starter with cider or anything? Do I just let it sit there? and how long 
will it take for the yeast to take off? Thanks.

I am writing with a proposal for those looking for cider without preservatives.
The idea is to make your own cider.  For those without an orchard, like myself,
this might seem impossible;but it is not.  Every year I collect between 2000 and
3000 pounds of apples within twenty miles of downtown Madison Wisconsin;  in
Maine and New York State, I did the same.  These apples are free.  I simply ask
people who have old apple tree on their property if they use there apples; 90%
say "no" and are happy to see them put to some use.  Of course, I return the
favor by giving them some cider in return.  To find a press for these apples,
you need only to call a local orchard and ask if they would press them or if
they know of an independent press in your area.  The cost here of pressing
apples is 60 cents/gallon (85 cents if you need gallon containers).  The great
thing about this way of gettin cider is that you meet lots of nice people; you
get outdoors in the fall with friends picking apples; you scout out the apple
trees in the spring (by watching for blossoms).  And the trip to the press each
fall becomes a ritual.  A side benefit is that we get a wide variety of apples,
some (from abandon orchards) are very old varieties, some are newer types.  I
think even people who live in urban areas could do this if they made scouting
trips to the country at various times during the year.  Making cider becomes a
year round activity.  And, you never have to put bad stuff in your cider.  Hope
your cider is fermenting well, The Philosopher's Cider.
