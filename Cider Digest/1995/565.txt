I can't remember,  but I thought that I read that potasium sorbate can be
removed from treated cider.  The process was to bring the cider to high
temp.  170?  210? - I can't remember.  


The problem I have is that I have just become interested in making some hard
cider for next year but the apple orchards are mostly done for the year and
only have treated cider left.  I did manage to get 4 gallons of fresh cider
from one small orchard but that cleaned them out!

Sorry for the sloppy reply, am still an E-mail newbie.


I thought it worth mentioning that there are now preservative free, non
frozen, apple juice concentrates available in the local (Tenafly, NJ) Grand
Union, in the juice aisle. They seem to be mostly available with berry
supplement flavors, which have added a nice color to my latest batch. Young
as it is, the flavor is not yet present in the finished cider. Time will tell.


Thanks for keeping up the newsletter. Much enjoyed by the LaFronz fmily.
