One possibility is to find an orchard who does custom pressing--you supply
the apples and containers, pay a small fee, and use their press.  Another
reader of Cider Digest in my area (Central New York State) mentioned via
private e-mail that there is an orchard around here that only charges $0.40
per gallon of finished product.


Alternatively, you could buy your own press.  They list from $150 up.  The
January 1995 issue of _Mother Earth News_ had a special section on
cider-making, and a mini-catalog of commercially available cider presses.
A copy should be available at your local library.  If you live in a rural
area, you may be able to find somebody selling an old cider press at a
garage or barn sale, too.  An acquaintance picked one up for $50 at such a
sale.


As for removing the preservatives with heat, I tried it once several years
ago, and it simply didn't work.  I ended up dumping it down the drain,
because although the preservatives kept the yeast from growing, it didn't
seem to hinder mold...  This was after two weeks in the carboy, with _NO_
visible activity, and repitching yeast three times.

Peter Matra asks about using natural yeast in CD #564:


Cider with no preservatives will "take off" in a day or two at room 
temperature. I might think about adding honey or sugar to get the OG to 1.070 
or so, but you don't need a starter.


Good luck - it will work, but I have had mixed results.

I have been brewing cider for a few years with good results. All
batches have been crystal clear. This is my 2nd attempt at
making perry. While the alcohol and flavors have been pleasing, 
it does not seem to clear despite racking and filtering several
times. Is this the nature of the product or would something
like isinglass or the such be in order? Any suggestion greatly 
appreciated.
