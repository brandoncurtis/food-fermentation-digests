Pears contain astringent tannins which continually precipitate out 
over the life time of the perry, this is what causes the cloudiness 
you describe. Cloudiness is a normal characteristic of a good perry, 
I would advise that you don't filter out these tannins. Rack the 
perry several times, but those tannins which remain in suspension in 
the juice contribute quite a lot to the flavour so if you do filter 
the perry you risk reducing the taste.

Would pectolase clear it up? Just a thought.
Now for a question that's been bugging me for some time. Wild yeasts may 
be fine and dandy, but what about the possibilities of pathogenic yeasts 
and bacteria in the brew?
TIA

     I'm normally a happy lurker, but I recently tried my hand at a batch
of hard cider and am just curious: what did I do wrong and what the heck
is this stuff in my carboy?


     According to my notes, here's what I did:


        *10/14/95*
        Hard Cider, 3 gallons


        3 gallons unpasteurized, freshly pressed cider
        1 lb dark brown sugar
        1 lb light brown sugar
        1 lb clover honey
        1 tsp yeast nutrient
        15 drops liquid pectic enzyme
        1 packet Red Star Pasteur champagne yeast


        - Heated up 1/2 gallon cider to dissolve sugar, honey and yeast
          nutrient.
        - Dumped into 3 gallon carboy, added rest of cold cider (drank what
          didn't fit).
        - Dumped in yeast right from packet and shook vigorously to mix
          everything up and aerate.
        - Set up carboy with blowoff tube.


        O.G.: 1.078


        - "Blew off" wildly after about 12 hours and then continued for
          about a week.  When the foam died down, I put on an airlock.


        *11/12/95*


        - Racked to secondary (actually racked to a 5 gallon carboy, then
          back to the 3 gallon, after cleaning it out).


        S.G.: < 0.990 (the hydrometer went right to the bottom of the
                       flask)


     The resulting liquid is, obviously, VERY alcoholic.  There is an slight
apple flavor, but no nose.  While not what I was looking for, it should make
a very powerful snakebite, mixed with a light red homebrewed ale.


     At any rate, what did I do wrong?  I also brew mead from time to time,
so I thought I needed the yeast nutrient.  The pectic enzyme was recommended
by my brew shop owner.  I also noticed quite a bit of "cold break" after a
few hours in the carboy.  Did I go overboard and give the yeast too much to
do?  Did the extra sugar not stay in suspension long enough?  IMHCR?

I'm interested how everybody knows when to bottle, and what they bottle 
the cider in. I'm ready to bottle...I think. My cider took off naturally 
very fast and I think it is ready. Does anyone put sugar in the bottle?

Greetings as I'm new to email but 5 years into cider.  Question about 
using campden tablets in cider but using wild yeasts. Do I use a lower 
rate say 1/2 tablet/gal or none at all. I'd appreciate any experiences or 
advice.
  
    Also, I use about one tablespoon of sweet-n-low (sodium 
saccronate) per 5 gallons at bottling to balance the tartness. 
Nutri-sweet is not supposed to be stable at long shelf life.  Tastes 
great! Any other suggestions besides filtering out yeast, pastuerizing, 
or refrigerating?
