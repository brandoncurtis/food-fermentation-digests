I take hydrometer readings periodically (every two or three days).  When
the specific gravity is unchanged on two successive readings, it's time to
bottle.


I bottle in beer bottles (various sizes, from 6-1/2 oz "splits" to 22 oz
bottles), glass soda bottles (32 oz), green glass Coke bottles (16-oz), and
Grolsch bottles (16 oz).  The majority goes into 12-oz beer bottles,
because these are the easiest to come by.  All bottles (except the Grolsch
bottles) are non-screw capped, and take a standard crown cap.


I usually mix in 3/4 cup of corn sugar into the 5-gallon batch at bottling
time.  This gives the cider a very nice sparkle in the bottle.  I add it to
the whole batch so the carbonation is the same in all bottles.


Happy brewing!

Dear Cider digest:


        I have seen a number of posts in the last couple of years that 
ask about when to bottle, whether to add sugar, and how to make sparkling 
cider.  It seems that a number of people are unclear about the process, 
so I would like to list a few items:
1.  Sparkling cider, bubbles, pressure etc. happens only when:
        A.  A beverage that contains unfermented sugar is put in a 
        sealed container (bottle).
        B.  Viable yeast in the bottle ferments the sugar and produces 
        carbon dioxide, which produces the pressure.
2.  Unless a person has a reasonable knowledge of the concentration of sugar 
present when the bottle is sealed, then the person is basically 
performing an experiment in hand grenade production.
3.  To know the sugar concentration at bottling, it is necessary to know 
if any sugar is present before any sugar is added.
4.  The safest way that I know to do all this is to ferment the beverage 
to dryness (no sugar remaining, as determined by a sugar test--ask your 
brewing supplies store--, or at least by no detectable sweet taste in the 
beverage.  Then add a measured amount of sugar and be sure to mix 
thoroughly so that you don't have some bottles at half-strength and some 
that are double.  I suggest that you use a recipe from a published 
source, whether it is in grams per liter, pounds per gallon, cups per 5 
gallon carboy, or whatever.  There are formulas for converting grams of 
sugar per liter to pounds per square inch.  
5.  Even professionals, like the famous Champagne makers of France, will 
have an occasional explosion because of defects in the glass.  Because of 
this, always treat the bottles as if they could "go off."  That is, do 
not shake warm bottles and hold them up to your eyes, etc.  I recommend 
goggles for handling, moving, and close examination of large suplies 
of bottles.  I've been making beer and sparkling wine for 16 years.  I'm not 
paranoid; just respectful of the possible hand grenades that I am 
producing.  By the way, I've had about two explosions and no injuries in 
those 16 years.
6.  An eye doctor in my town told me that two of the largest causes of 
eye injuries come from racket balls and from champagne corks.
