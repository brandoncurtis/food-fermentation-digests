I have a cyser (2 gallons cider, one gallon honeyed water, basically
following Papzian's recipe in _Making Mead_) that has clarified nicely
after a prolonged fermentation. I want to bottle it as a sparkling
beverage, but I'm not sure when I should bottle. Right now it is quite
astringent and needs to age for a while. Should I age it in the carboy, or
let it age in the bottles?

a note from the digest janitor...


Awfully quiet around here!  I've given up expecting to be able to predict
how much traffic the digest will get based on seasons or whatever.  I guess
you're all busy tending to the fermenting cider from this year's crop...
but need I say that if you've been meaning to ask something of the Digest,
now's a nice quiet time to write something.
