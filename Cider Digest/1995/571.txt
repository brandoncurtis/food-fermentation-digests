I have made cider only a couple of times but am about to jump into it full
out. I have read a couple of books on the subject and feel pretty comfortable
with the basics of cidermaking. As I am a professional brewer however, I am
completely in the dark  about what un-fermented and fermented cider can and
cannot touch. I have heard that there are metals that cider cannot come in
contact with. I assume copper, aluminum and lead are among the metals. I also
assume that pH has everything to do with that. There is a difference in pH
between fermented and unfermented cider. My question is three part: 1- which
can't touch which?  2- why not?  3- what would happen? 
I would appreciate an answer that covers all three parts of my question.
Everytime I get an answer to this question it is vague. I just need to know!
 Kurt I think you can answer this one for me.

Ruth:


Change your yeast.  Champagne yeast has a tendency to make a bone-dry
product.  This can be nice, but if it's not what you're looking for, try a
beer yeast.  I have had very good luck with sweeter ciders using Red Star
dry ale yeast.


Champage yeast has a very high alcohol tolerance.  It will not peter out
until all of the sugar had been eaten up unless you make a _very_ sweet
must.  Ale yeasts top out at 10% alcohol or so.  If there are remaining
sugars once this limit has been reached, the yeast will not consume it.


For my next batch of cider, I'm planning to use Wyeast sweet mead yeast.
I'm not planning to start it until after New Year's Day, but I'll let y'all
know how it comes out!

Any cautions/advice/experience out there on using a stainless steel tank as a
primary fermenter for cider?  The tanks I'm looking at were originally used
to store milk.


Thanks in advance!
