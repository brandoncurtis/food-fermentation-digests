Dear Dann:
        As to your tripartite question;m 
1) Unfermented ciders shuld not contact copper, or cast iron or carbon steel.
2) The pH of the cider will aid ind dissolving metal ions fromthe metals,
this causes a discoloration of the cider.
3. Your cider can/ would trun green from copper ions, and can turn black
from oxidation of iron ions.
4. Brass would probably be OK if it has been passivated in a bath of 2 parts
acetic acid and one part hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. Othewise it could
dissolve lead from the brass and copper. Be cautious. Stainless Steel is OK
to use with ciders.
Ph of sweet (unfermented) cider can range from 2.9-5.4 depending on the make
up of the must. High acid musts need to be reduced somewhat, and a low acid
must should be acidified somewhat.  
I'd suggest refering to Sweet and Hard CIders by Proulx and Nichols as a
good general beginning.

I'm adding oak chips (from the brew shop @ .50/oz) to 5 gal of cider.  
How many oz should be added for how long?  I heated some cider to 160 
degrees F and soaked the chip 20' to reduce the beasties then added them 
to the carbouy.  Is this advisable or necessary?  Maybe I should have 
added the liquid and left the chips out.  Would that give enuf oak flavor?


If any of you have killer recipes for flavored cidre, I'd be interested.  


Thanks all.   Jim Booth, Lansing, MI
