Kathy Booth asks about oak chips:




I've found that in winemaking, approx 4 grams per liter of oak chips
in a white will give something with an oak content that reasonably 
approximates commercial wines that were barrel fermented.  


IMHO, this would be a bit much for a cider (actually, I've since come to
the conclusion that it's too much for wine, too, but that's another
story :).  I'd start at maybe 1 g/l, wait a couple of weeks, taste, and
add more if necessary.


I just rack the wine onto the chips, but I don't know if this is "safe"
for cider.  The flavor is extracted within a couple of weeks.


Also, assuming that the "barrel fermented chardonnay" type effect is 
what you're after, make sure that the chips are toasted, and not just
raw wood.  The more desireable flavor components develop from changes
when the wood is toasted.  Raw chips taste like raw wood.  


Chips from Barrel Builders [no address handy, but they are in Napa, CA]
are pre-toasted. I've also had some from brew stores that were raw.  I
toasted them under the broiler.  A dark burnt umber color is best.
Don't char them to the point where your are making charcoal.


Good luck, and keep us posted on the results.

I'm posting this to a wide range of places to ask the help of homebrew shop
owners, clubs, individuals, etc., in getting the word out on a mistake in the
New England Homebrewer of the Year Competition poster that was sent out to
the New England regional homebrewing community a few weeks ago.


The correct contact SnailMail address for the Green Mountain Homebrew
Competition, slated for Saturday, May 11, 1996, in Burlington, Vermont, is:


Tom Ayres
c/o Green Mountain Mashers
P.O. Box 9492
S. Burlington, VT 05407-9492


The post office box AND Zip Code were misprinted on the poster.  If you have
any of these posters in your possession -- or know locations where they are
posted -- I'd greatly appreciate it if you would correct them accordingly.
 Thanks!!!


Cheers,


Tom Ayres

New reader here.


I plan to have a Cider Web page ("Cider Space") up sometime this week. URL
http://WWW.teleport.com/~incider. I'd like to see this site become a
depository for cider related materials/information.




I'm the Oregon Rep. for Seven Sisters Cider, so I hear some good gossip.
This is the latest; Budweiser is coming out with a hard cider Jan 1.! Also
Time magazine is running a feature on cider the last week of December.
