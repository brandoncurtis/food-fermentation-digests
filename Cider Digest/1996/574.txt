                 Attention fellow beer and cider enthusiasts:


                          The Boston Wort Processers
                           present The Second Annual


                          BOSTON HOMEBREW COMPETITION
                      Hosted By Commonwealth Brewing Company
                     Boston, Massachusetts, Febrewary 24, 1996


                          See http://www.rsi.com/wort/


The Second Annual Boston Homebrew Competition (BHC) will be held on Saturday,
Febrewary 24, 1996, in Boston, Massachusetts.  Full competition rules, style
guidelines, entry registration and bottle label forms, and judge and steward
registration forms and information can be found on the Boston Wort Processor's
WortPage at http://www.rsi.com/wort/.  Folks without WWW access can request
that hard copies of the forms be mailed (or ASCII versions emailed) to them by
contacting Dan Hall at hall@buffa.enet.dec.com or (603) 884-5879.


CIDER MAKERS!  The 1996 BHC now accepts your cider entries.  Many of the same
folks who judge cider at the AHA National competition (including cider guru
Paul Correnty) will be judging the cider category at the BHC.  This is a great
way to get quality feedback about your ciders at less than half the cost of
the AHA National competition.


The 1996 BHC is registered with the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP)
and will be hosted by Commonwealth Brewing Company, Boston's oldest brewpub.


The competition organizers promise a professionally run competition with
timely feedback for all entries.  All entries will be judged by BJCP
Recognized, Certified, National or Master judges and supervised apprentices
under BJCP competition standards, rules and regulations.


In addition to the first, second and third place winners in each category,
a grand prize will be given to the competition's highest rated beer judged
in a Best-Of-Show panel.  Results of the BHC (with the exception of cider
entries, this year) will also count towards the New England Homebrewer of the
Year (NEHBOTY) competition. 




                ****COMPETITION RULES AND ENTRY INFORMATION****


Anyone may enter, but entries must have been brewed at home not using a
commercial operation.  Entry fee is $5.00 per entry ($4.00 per entry if
entering five or more beers.)  Brewers may enter more than one beer per
category, but only one beer per sub-category is allowed, and only one winning
beer in each category will count towards NEHBOTY.  Checks or money
orders for entry fees should be made out to The Boston Wort Processors.


Brewers must submit three (3) qualified bottles for each entry.  Qualified
bottles must be 10 to 16 ounces, any style, with no raised glass lettering,
silkscreening, labels or other distinguishing marks or characteristics.
Caps must be plain or blacked out.


The deadline for entries is Saturday, Febrewary 17, 1996.  Late entries will
neither be judged nor returned.


Registration forms must be attached to each bottle with a rubber band.  NO TAPE!
Recipes are not necessary, but the competition organizers reserve the right to
request a recipe after the competition. 


For return of beer evaluation forms, a self addressed stamped envelope (SASE)
of appropriate size must be included with one postage stamp for each entry.


Ribbons will be awarded to all beers placing first, second and third provided
the entries receive a score of at least 25 points.  A special Best-of-Show
ribbon and prize will also be awarded. 


Categories will be collapsed as necessary to comply with NEHBOTY rules and
regulations and to facilitate judging.  In all cases, judges will be given
complete information to evaluate each beer to the proper style.  All decisions
of the contest organizers will be final.
