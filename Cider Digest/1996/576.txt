Hello all,


I have a problem with some cider.


I made a totally natural cider. Three gallons of fresh-pressed juice from a 
local mill into a three gallon carboy - no nutrients, no yeast, nothing but
the juice.


It fermented out nicely over the next 3-4 months. I racked once, and after
about 6 months it cleared. But I had to fiddle with it...


So, I added some gelatin to try and clear it a little better.


As I poured in the gelatin, the whole mixture (cider + gelatin) turned a 
pure milky white. It is now opaque.


It has been a month now. It doesn't clear, it doesn't settle.


What have I done?


What can/should I do to correct this horrible looking stuff? (It smells OK,
nice apple aroma.)


Any and all advice/suggestions would certainly be appreciated.




TIA,
Chuck

I recently got a catalog from Miller nurseries.  It contains a very large
number of fruits, and especially a very large variety of apples including
many heritage varieties.  Probably over 25 or thirty varieties in all, maybe
more.  I expect that many readers here who grow their own fruit or have been
considering doing so would be interested in this catalog.


The toll free number for Miller nurseries is 800-836-9630 and their address
is 5060 West Lake Rd., Canandaigua, New York 14424
