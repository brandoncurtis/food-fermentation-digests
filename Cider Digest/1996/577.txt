Funny, I tried the same thing on one batch I've got going here.

That also happened to mine right away.  But...

In mine, the whatever-it-is coagulated over a few hours and mostly settled
out within a day or so.  I can't say that the result, after it settled, is
brilliantly clear, but it's somewhat clearer than it was before I screwed
around with it.


It sure looks like the amount of gruk I got out is way more than can be
explained by the original slight lack of clarity...it's got to be mostly
structure from the gelatin.


> What have I done?


In my case, I decided that what I had done was to violate a cardinal rule:
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"  Looks like the idea of gelatin fining
may be a homebrewing or mead-making thing that doesn't carry over to cider,
but I'm curious about the difference between Chuck's experience and mine
with respect to eventual clearing.

Hi!


I'm going to try a batch of cider this week-end using Wyeast #1968 London
ESB.  Has anyone else tried this yeast for a cider?


I had no cider to start the yeast starter culture, so I brewed a pint of
specific gravity 1.030 beet wort (unhopped) as a starter.  This shouldn't
noticably affect the flavor...should it?


Anyway, your feedback would be appreciated.


Happy brewing!

I would like to inquire whether anyone knows of an intensive cider making
course in the United States. 
Much obliged, Magunda@aol.com
