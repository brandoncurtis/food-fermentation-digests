There are several cider makers you can directly order cider from. Neither
are in Woodchucks style, but you might be happy anyhow. The two I have
talked to are both farmhouse ciders (traditional style) from New England.
Both use fresh pressed apples, & premium varieties such as Golden Russets.
Tell them Morgan sent you.

I don't have the URL right off, but a place down in Florida called Hogtown
(Brewer?) sells a number of US, French and English ciders. I found them by
searching 'cider' on Webcrawler.

Until this week-end, I swore by Red Star active dry ale yeast.  It tended
to finish out at 8-10% alcohol by weight, and left a nice subtle sweetness
and some complex fruity esters.  Edme dry ale yeast works okay, but it
doesn't add the... complexity (for lack of a better word) that Red Star
adds.


This week-end, I tried Wyeast #1968, London ESB.  It's only been a week in
the primary fermenter, but it's already developing a nice complexity.


I haven't had the guts to try a natural fermentation.  I guess I still
remember the thick and chunky "hard ciders" that I accidentally "brewed" in
the back of my 'fridge before I started homebrewing.


Anyway, good luck!

        To keep cidre from getting too tart, one solution would be to 
pastuerize it.  Has anyone bottled and carbonated their cidre and then 
pasteurized it?  Did the carbonated bottles pop their lids at 160 
degreees F?  How low a temp can you use and kill the yeasties?   120?  130?
Would it be better to use a low temp and longer time or higher and shorter?
        Any references or experiences would be appreciated.  Cheers Jim Booth

Dear Cider Digesters,


You'll recall that I had a totally naturally fermented cider, that had a
slight haze, which I decided to "fix" by adding gelatin. The cider turned
milky-white and would not settle out, not even when chilled.


I posed the question to the Digest and the overwhelming response was to add 
tannin to the cider (Michael Ferdinando did recommend adding pectic enzyme, 
which I had already tried to no effect, but did not mention.)


Last night I dissolved, according to the directions on the label, a little
more than 1/2 tsp grape tannin in hot water and then added to the cider. The 
effect was immediate!


I swirled it into the cider and immediately great "flocs" of what I would
call coagulated protein, if I were making beer, came out of solution. It
looked sort of like the same stuff that comes out of solution sometimes
after you pitch your yeast when using Irish moss.


This morning the cider is bright crystal clear, and there must be a good
inch of the coagulated protein on the bottom of the carboy.


Many thanks to all who helped me with this problem, However, I think the
best advice of all came from our trusty janitor, Dick Dunn,  who said:


> In my case, I decided that what I had done was to violate a cardinal rule:
