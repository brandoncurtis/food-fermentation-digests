I'm still fairly new to brewing in general (3 ales, 1 mead, 1 braggot, 2 ciders)
so maybe I'm missed something along the way, but why (and this question is open
to anyone) would you want to kill the yeast?  The only reason I can come up with
is clarity.  Which, I mean, is fine but I was just wondering if there was some
other reason that killing the yeast in a cider was necessary.

Again, a novice question: I've had my first batch of cider sitting in bottles
for almost 2 weeks carbonating.  I assumed 2 weeks because that's how long I
leave a beer.  How long should my ciders carbonate in the bottle?  How long
should I be fermenting?  With both batches I let them go 2 weeks, racked to a
secondary and went 2 more weeks, then bottled.  The first batch will be at two
weeks in the bottle this weekend and the second batch I will bottle this weekend
(after 2 weeks in the secondary).  Is this about right?


Thanks,

OK, my first batch of cider didn't quite turn out like I expected (not that 
that is a big shock or anything).  I started out simple so don't flame me 
for taking the easy route.  Anyway, I took 1 gallon of Tree Top brand 
apple cider and added 1 packet of Lavlin 1118 champagne yeast.  I let it 
ferment for 2 weeks and then racked.  I let it go for appx 2 more weeks 
(2 weeks, 3 days) and then bottled.  For bottling, I racked into a clean 
jar and added 36ml of corn sugar (boiled in 4 oz of water) for 
carbonation.  I then bottled and let it sit for 2 weeks.  I've opened several 
now and they've all been still.  It's not a bad drink (it's kindof like a light 
apple wine) but it's not what I was going for.  I wanted a sparkling cider.


Any comments or suggestions?
Thanks,
Tracy
