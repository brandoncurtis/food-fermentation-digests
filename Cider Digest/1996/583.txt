David Prescott asked about how long beverage can stay in the bottle before it
turns.
I have no idea what you consider to be fairly decent tasting beer or cider
but as someone who makes beer for a living I wouldn't expect most beer to
taste all that great after even six months. There's nothing published in any
book that says India Pale Ales actually tasted good to soldiers in India.


Oxygen will slaughter the flavor of any beverage in less than an hour. That's
the number one killer. Unless you can guaranty no oxygen then fresh is always
best.


I hope someone can answer the other half of the question as I am also
interested.

Like many recent posts on this digest, I too have been brewing beer 
for a few years and recently attempted (for the first time) a cider. After 
looking through Cat's Meow at the various recipes, I compiled the following:


5 Gallons Apple Juice (no Na-Benzoate)
2 Lbs Brown Sugar
1 Lb Honey
1 Cup Sucrose (didn't quite have enough brown sugar)
Dry EDME Ale Yeast (1 packet)


Several recipes in CM3 and other places recommended boiling for a short 
while (15 min) so I did and all seemed well. This stuff fermented madly 
for nearly 2 weeks, then slowed to a more steady rate and seems about 
finished (2 weeks later). I have a feeling that I "pectinized" the cider
by boiling, as it is extremely cloudy and shows no signs of settling. I'm
wondering how (if) I can clear it some, but I'm unsure whether the cloudiness
is due to yeast, pectin, or both. Any suggestions on what I should do 
next? Also, will cider "skunk" if overexposed to light like beer?


I took a taste as I racked it to a secondary and was pleasantly 
surprised. One last question I have is whether it's ok to prime 
with frozen apple concentrate (just an idea), and if so, how much 
for 4.5 US Gal. Thanks in advance. This is my first post here as I only 
recently subscribed. Yet another great forum to get info on a great hobby!


Best to you all

Many thanks to all that provided input. I am still looking for a good cider
recipe and can't find one in any of the books I have looked in. Will keep
looking or may just take a stab at a concocked batch.


Cheers
