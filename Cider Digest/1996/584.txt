Todd Kirby asks what to do about cloudy cider (possibly due to
pectin).  There are inexpensive pectolytic enzyme preparations
that will clear your cider if pectin is the problem.  If they
do not clear the cider, then my guess is that you still have
suspended yeast -- be patient.


Todd also asks about the possibility of cider being "skunked"
by sunlight.  Not to worry - the skunking of beer by exposure
to sunlight is the result of a reaction involving constituents
derived from hops.  No hops, no skunking.  Of course, that
doesn't mean that exposing cider to strong sunlight won't do
something else undesirable.
