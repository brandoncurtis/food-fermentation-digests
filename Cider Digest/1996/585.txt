Greetings!


I'd like to give a try to an easy cider (1st time).  I'd 
appreciate any simple recipes, especially those that can solve 
the out of season potassium sorbate dilema in store-bought 
ciders.  Also, I'd prefer a sweet (ale yeast) taste, carbonated, 
if possible.  Private e-mail ok.


Thanks!


Tim Spencer
