I was sad when the subject cider digest had only one posting, so I am 
sending this along.


I have made two ciders, both derivative of grocery store stuff.  the 
first was a one gallon job that I added blue berries to.  Yum, Yum.  The 
second was a five gallon job.  It turned to vinegar almost as soon as it 
fermented.  Much sadness and gnashing of teeth followed.  Is it the 
nature of acetobacteria to attach during fermentation, or was I just lucky?

In regards to Todd Kirby's questions regarding the cloudiness of his cider,
he may want to consider some other things that we are have learned or are
trying. In addition to the use of enzymes to remove pectin, apple
processors also use an enzyme to remove starch. Starch in the juice will
also cause a haze. If you don't want to use a starch enzyme, you need to
"sweat" the apples after picking. During this period of "sweating", the
apples get soft which makes them easier to crush. During this time, the
starch in the apple is converted to a form of sugar. This increases the
sugar level of the apple before crushing and eliminates haze due to starch.
The higher sugar level also results in higher alcohol levels after
fermentation.

I started brewing Cider last year after drinking a great deal of Blackthorn
Cider when I was in England for vacation.  Although I have been pleased with
my first few efforts, I would like to produce something more like Blackthorn.
 So far I have used Champagne, Montpillier, and Ale yeasts.  The Champagne
was definitely too dry and the the other two are good but still don't give
what I'm looking for.


Also, a local brewery, New Glarus Brewing (in Wisconsin) has an Apple Beer
that I would like to copy but I'm not sure where to start.  It tastes as if
they add Cider to some hopped malt.  Any ideas on what proportions to use in
trying to produce the cider-beer or which hops to use would be very
appreciated.


Thanks,


Craig
