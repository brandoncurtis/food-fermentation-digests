        I'm planning to travel to Montreal this summer for a vacation.  I
believe there are a number of cider producers in the area just outside the
city.  Can anyone recommend which offer the best tours, and of course the
best cider.
        Thanks.

Hello, since oxygen is the killer of apple cider flavor, would it make sense
to leave some apple pulp in the fermentation vessel?  It seems that the pulp,
in turning brown, is reacting with oxygen in the air and prevents the juice
from getting oxidized.  Can the yeast convert the starch in the pulp into
sugar?


E-mail replies appreciated.

In regards to Tom Kenny's cider turning to vinegar, it is advised to use an
airlock during fermentation and to keep the juice away from areas where the
flavor may be adversely affected. Once the fermentation is finished, the
juice need to be topped off and sealed. If you use some fresh juice for
topping, it can serve to add a little sweetness to the final outcome.
Temperature can make a difference also. Yeasts and little bugs are not very
active in colder temperatures so try refrigeration or cool storage after
fermentation.

The New Glarus Apple Jack, a great apple beer indeed. Perhaps the best one I
have ever tasted, commercial or homebrewed. More than a beer with an 
acetylaldehyde nose, as some seem to be.


A balanced blend of ale with apples. I could not tell you the hops, but the
beer is basically a mild brown ale with cider added post-fermentation. The
proportion is approximately 2/3 beer to 1/3 cider. 


I can find out more if you like. It's been a while since I've been out to the
brewery. I only live 15 minutes from New Glarus, but only manage to get out
that way about every three months or so !


Cheers,


Mitch

What the big cidermakers do is tricky. What happens is they start with high
OG juice (added sugars), ferment the juice to dry (usually with champaign
yeasts-quick,clean,high alcohol), kill the yeast, then add in more juice
(or carbonated water) to hit the desired ending gravity. Then powdered
mallic acid is added to raise the 'tartness' of the cider.


The reason commercial cider makers do this is for economic and storage reasons.

As a beginer, I'm looking for a cheap way to begin my quest for great cider.
 Of course, I want the obvious- great taste and alcoholic content.  I would
be grateful for any hints or suggestions that anyone might give me.  Thanks
