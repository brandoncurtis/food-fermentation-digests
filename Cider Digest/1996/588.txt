you will have to page down towards the bottom some but there is a list of
Quebec cider makers including some notes on a brief tour of one we took a
while back.  This was previously posted to this list so I'll only provide
the URL here.

Cider List:
I  know how to make a decent top-fermented beer.  Decided to try to make
 a dry cider, as my wife isn't super-fond of hoppy beers.


Bought me 5+ gallons of cider from an orchard.  Followed advice of beer
& wine shop & added champagne yeast to otherwise untouched liquid in
primary fermenter.  Fermented.  Added whatever they sold me to 
precipitate solids.  Bottled the extremely turbid liquid after fermentation 
completed.  Let sit for several months.  Got EXTREMELY alcohol-tasting,
 not-quite-right-on, absolutely clear  well-carbonated stuff.


Dumb question:  what have I got?  A bacterially-contaminated cider for
lack of proper pretreatment?  Just a flavor I wasn't anticipating?  Right. 
I did not RTFM.  Don't have one.  (Got LOTS of books on beermaking.) 
Can one be suggested by Older & /or Wiser Heads?


Thanks in advance.
Gene

Hello all-


I just put my second gallon batch of cider in the bottle today.  I was at 
the grocery store getting some more cider for my next batch and they have 
some orange juice that is fresh squeezed in the store and doesn't have 
preservatives.  So I bought a half gallon and pitched some Australian ale 
yeast in it.  It had a O.G. 44.  Has anyone else tried orange juice or 
have I just lost my mind?!? 
 
Cheers,  
Jason Henning

Are there any other cider makers in the nothern Virginia (DC) area?  I
would enjoy meeting you via email.

Fascinating.  Thanks for the info.


Does this mean that the carbonation isn't a function of fermentation, but 
simply pressurizing the end result, or using carbonated water?

In Cider Digest #587 Morgan replied to my original message:

If I want to try replicating this type of procedure, what is the recommended
way of killing the yeast?  Do I have to boil the fermented cider?  Is there a
better approach?
