        I agree with the warnings about glass grenades.  Getting the 
carbonation right has been the most difficult aspect of my cidre 
production. 


        I use out of use glass Faygo bottles with screw on lids or flip 
top Grolsch  bottles, and if over carbonated, relieve a little pressure 
without opening the lid. 


        My cidre ferments to dry, then I add 1 to 2 Tablespoons of 
Sween-n-low to balance the flavor.  This is sugar equivelent of 1 C 
sucrose (at 1T/5gal). 


        I would like to use the alternatives to saccrin (sweet-n-lo) but 
they are beyond my industrial capabilities to produce sweetened sparkling 
cidre.  I mix the 3/4c sucrose and the 1T Sween-n-lo with enuf cidre to 
produce 1 T/bottle.  This I add to each bottle before siphoning in the cidre.


        Nutri-sweet is not recommended for processing which is why I use
 saccrin. The product is infinitely more drinkable than the unsweetened 
sparkling cidres.

Hello All:


For what it's worth: As a brewer/meadmaker of several years now, I've finished 
my first two ciders, with interesting results I thought I'd mention here


Each batch was five gallons of raw cider from Bartlet's in Richmond, Mass. 
Each was in the primary for 14 days with only a little nutrient (2 tsps). 
Although this took place at different times, temperatures here in Vermont 
varied considerably throughout the late winter.


There were only two differences between batches: #1 aged in the secondary for 
14 days and was made with 10 grams of MUNTON yeast. #2 was aged 29 days and 
was made with EDME yeast. #2 was made well after #1.


The result was that #1 came out relatively smooth and tart, not overbearingly 
so. Even after several weeks of aging in the bottle, it is more tart than #2, 
which came out noticeably less tart and a bit more full-bodied. Both ciders 
are good!


My initial take on all of this is that the edme yeast produces a more 
full-bodied and less tart cider. I'm not sure that the extra fifteen days in 
the secondary would make THAT much of a difference.

Hi, All:


two new ciders have turned up in recent months around here. They're both 
pretty good:


JOHNY MASH, imnsho, is the better of the two. It is tart and strong and made 
in western (Berkshire County) Massachusetts. Alcohol content is around 6%. It 
goes for under $7.00 (!) a six-pack.


CIDER JACK is also in the 6% range and is made in Middlebury, Vermont (also 
home to the excellent Otter Creek beer people). It's a little less tart and 
ful-bodied than the Johnny Mash. However, it has more life in it than the 
Woodchuck Cider. It claims to be made from both French and North American 
ciders (although in what incarnation it's difficult to say). Cider Jack seems 
set up to compete with Woodchuck on its own turf. It has an odd, kind of 
pretentious woodcut of a field-working kind of guy with a big, flexed bicep 
with an apple in it. Looks like something from Stalinist Russia, while 
Woodchuck has the old-time New Englandy look. But the results for Cider Jack 
are OK. A little more expensive than the Johnny Mash here.


FWIW, both apear to be truly independent of larger parent companies.

> Did Paul Correnty have a custom press this last fall?


Yes, several.


As to the apples that he used: I know he used mac's, gravensteins,
wolf river, and red delicious.  I think he also had some spy apples.


I do not know the proportions.


> Is anyone on the list still using the yeast extracted from the

I've used a natural yeast strain for three years now (both cultured
and from the apple skins that went in the press).  The culture is
available to members of the Boston Wort Processors or to anyone who
gets Paul's juice in the fall.  I don't know which orchard originally
provides the strain (probably one in Westford, MA), and there is a
good chance that the strain I use with the apples each year may very
well be different depending on the apples that Paul buys from
different orchards.


Nevertheless, the Worts have the Correnty II strain in a club yeast
bank (in cryogenics right now ;-).  I last used it with a cyser.

That's all good and fine, but I'm looking for something sweet, not dry.


But I like your idea for controlled carbonation.  I suppose it won't work 
if there is too much alcohol for the yeast (then it won't matter how much 
sugar you put in there (until it starts to, by it's own volume, lower the 
alcohol level).  In that case, I guess adding juice (side note; what's the 
difference between apple juice and unfermented apple cider?) to lower the 
alcohol level, and increase the sugar level is probably the thing to do.




Then, Kurt Schilling wrote:

I suppose I could do Option 3, but instead of sulfiting, pasteurize it.
That would kill all the yeast, and I would have to add more yeast to it.
I would probably also have to prime it, not just with a little concentrated 
sugar, but also enough juice so that the alcohol level goes down enough 
to allow subsequent fermentation.


Is there any need to use sulfites after pasteurization?  I can't see any...


Thanks to all for all your help with this.

my experience with corn sugar for priming beer is that measuring by =
volume can be a very inaccurate way to get a desired carbonation level. =
6 ounces is fairly standard for beer priming, yet this may range from =
3/4 cup to 1 cup by volume depending on how it 'packs' in the measuring =
cup. my suggestion would be to purchase a small postage scale for =
measuring priming sugar by weight to improve the repeatability of your =
corn sugar additions.

        Seems like a rather difficult topic!, so I'll have a try at it.


        How's about using some low-alcohol yeast (ale, lager?).  Ferment
until the little beasties stop fermenting, then bottle.  There should
still be fermentation that goes on after the yeasties go dormant, since
there will always be a few million yeasties who can ferment to a high
alcohol level.
        This way, a very slow, tailing-off ferment will carbonate the
bottles...
        BOOM! Baby, BOOM!
