The debate about methods for creating a sweet cider reminded me of the =
method for bottling soft drinks at home. Soft drinks are made by mixing =
about 5 pounds of sugar in 5 gallons of water with champagne yeast and =
soda flavor extract (root beer, cola, you name it). Once the sugar is =
dissolved you bottle immediately, let the bottles sit in the sun for a =
few hours then put in the closet (basement, where ever) for storage.


these do NOT go BOOM. Why not? I have no clue, except that perhaps the =
pressure buildup in the bottle stifles further fermentation. There was =
similar thread on the Homebrew Digest about yeast activity in general, =
and I recall that pressure has been shown to slow yeast activity. But =
does it stop it altogether?=20


Perhaps this would provide some clues as to how a similar technique =
might be applied to making sweet cider.

I was considering crossposting this to Mead Lover's Digest, but I decided not
to, especially considering they'll both be erotic for a couple of weeks.  
Good thing the CDA isn't being enforced yet.

How do you pasteurize it?  Rack it into a brewkettle and heat it?  At what
temperature does the alcohol begin to evaporate?  What's the risk of a flash
fire with this procedure?  I was in a big flash fire when I was about 11, and
I thought it was really cool, but I'm not really up for another any time soon.

This might seem like a dumb question, but do "lactose-intolerant" people have
a problem with the lactose that you can buy at the beer store?  I'm interested
because my girlfriend is somewhat lactose-intolerant (she can drink a glass or
two of milk a day, but even that sometimes upsets her stomach a bit), and she's
the one for whom I'd brew sweet cider.  (I prefer it dry, but can take it 
either way.)  I was considering splitting a batch, putting lactose or something
like it in half of it.  (I may go ahead with the Nutrasweet someone mentioned
here awhile back, though.)  So, how much lactose would I want to add?  How
much is that relative to the amount in a glass of milk?  (Or is it something
else in milk that really bothers lactose-intolerant people?)


Is there some other (affordable) unfermentable sugar additive I could use?

Who here has pasteurized after bottling?  Any pointers?  (I would worry
that this would up the CO2 pressure dangerously, for instance.)


Thanks!
