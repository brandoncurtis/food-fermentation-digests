        I've heard stories myself about exploding bottles of rootbeer.  I 
never let mine last that long, so I have no personal experience with 
rootbeer grenades.  However, I did have a cider mega-bomb!  I stopped up 
a one gallon jug of cider temporarily to use the air lock on beer.  I 
intended to put another air lock on the cider but forgot.  In fact, I 
forgot about the cider!  Thats what I get for putting it in one of those 
"warm, safe spots".  Anyways, about a year later I was reminded of it 
when I heard a huge explosion in the garage and was greeted by the smell 
of cider.  What a mess!  Don't ask me why the stopper didn't shoot off.  
I know that a one-gallon carbouy isn't as strong as a beer or champange 
bottle, but am unsure if I want to risk it(my cat still wont go near the 
washing machine I hid the cider behind).  I like the idea of in bottle 
pastuerization, and will try it to see if it affect the flavor.

        There is some Potassium salt that provides sweetness, however the 
FDA won't let us have it.  I wouldn't use Nutrasweet because it imparts a 
funny flavour.  I tried it, but if you must also, try a glass first. 
Northern Brewing supplies (Wi, I think) sells enough aspartame for five 
gal of rootbeer for $3.  Lemme know if You can't find them and I'll post 
the address.
        Anyone use sorbate-K to stop fermentation and then 
force-carbonate in a keg?  I may try that as soon as I get another keg.

I have a distinct advantage here in that my local brewstore makes 
vinegar and has a pasteurizing machine, its basically a water heater 
with a wort cooler coil attached, that water is kept at 160 by the 
heater and is constantly circulated thru the coil. I place the coil into 
a bucket with the cider and let it go for an hour.
>  At what temperature does the alcohol begin to evaporate? 


I can see some chem majors argueing now, but I believe its above 190, I 
just turn the heater off on the pasteurizer and begin to circulate well 
water thru the coil while its still in the bucket and cool everything 
off, any alchol that came out of solution is soon back in.

using the above procedure none, on a stove? I have no idea.

if you pasteurize use table sugar, add to taste.

This is the best idea, but takes a while. bottle like normal and 
immediatly put the bottles into your brewpot filled with hot water and 
put it in the oven set for 169 -175 degrees, let it go for an hour, it 
will be still but it'll be pasteurized also.

Even if overcarbonated bottles don't blow, they boil and gush sediment off 
the bottem to throw a yeast character that dominates my cider. Not 
desiring hefecidre, I bottle 
in Grolsch bottles and if over-carbonated, will release a bit of CO2 
without opening until the excess pressure is drained away.


If anyone wants to know of my experience in using Sween-n-lo to solve th 
too dry cider problem, they can email privately.


         The excellent travel series FAT MAN IN FRANCE (PBS) told of how 
French white wines used to be too dry/sour for popular consumption.  So 
Cacais (sp) used to be added as a flavoring at serving.  As with 
Berlinner Wiesse, adding sweetner at serving in an ancient tradition.

I've asked a couple people privately, and it seems common practice to drink
cider within a week or two of fermentation.  I'm wondering if anyone has tried
to age their cider longer and what sorts of effects this has.  


Thanks,

I've made root beer before and used this method.  I can say that they most
certianly do go 
Boom,  maybe because I sed brown sugar and there are more nutriunts for the
yeast to eat.  
I think that yours did not because plain table sugar does not have a lot of
nutrients and therefore
does not ferment out to completion

Why not use Malto-dextrin found at your nieghborhood brew shop?
I use this for more residual body but it does add sweetness.

I make sweet cider the same way as I make sweet coffee or tea. Pour your strong 
dry cider into a glass, add a teaspoon (or two or three..) of your favourite 
sugar and drink. This is not as stupid as it sounds!

It seems I have a cider which is stuck after 4 days of fermenting. 
It had an OG of 1.047 and now sits at 1.030 with hardly and
activity.
It is fermenting at a constant 62 degrees.
Here is the recipe I used:
3 gal. Pasteurized apple juice (not from Concentrate)
1 lb. X-tra light DME
1 lb. Malto-dextrin (for a sweet taste)
and used Itish Ale WYeast.


Boiled DME, Malto-dextrin for 60 min.  Cooled to 70 deg. then added
to apple juice and pitched yeast.


Any help is appreciated.  I might add more yeast.  However I know
I haven't reached the alcohol level for the yeast to quit yet.


TIA

I have an idea for a sweet, sparkling cider.  Somebody please tell me if you
think this won't work.


When bottling the cider, add a *little* more priming sugar than usual (I
usually use half a cup for a 5 gallon batch).  Bottle in Fischer or Grolsch
type bottles.


When you're sure the carbonation process is done, open each bottle and add a
little sugar syrup mixed with sorbate or benzoate to prevent a renewed ferment
and close the bottle back up.


I figure that opening the bottle will release some of the carbonation, but not
much if what I've observed is correct.  Since a little extra sugar was added
when priming, the cider should be a little more carbonated to start with so if
things are done correctly, it should even out.  I don't think the initial extra
pressure will matter much since the bottles can withstand the pressure caused
by 3/4 cup priming sugar, and I don't propose going that high.


Can anyone think of any reason the sorbate or benzoate shouldn't keep a renewed
ferment from kicking in?


This could also be done with crown caps but then the cap would have to be
discarded and a new one put on (or would it?).


Opinions?
