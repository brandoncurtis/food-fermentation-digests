Hi, I have two batches of cider fermenting now.  One batch is made from
pure home-made fresh apple juice (must have spent about $50!).  It
did not impart any sulfur-like smell in early stages of fermentation.
I have another batch that is mixed home-made apple juice and store-bought,
supposedly no-preservative apple juice.  It has the familiar sulfur smell,
as I've noticed in earlier batches made from store-bought apple juice.
Have others noticed this sulfur-stage?

Joel,
        I see a couple possible snags here.  First, Sorbate-K prevents 
renewed ferm. by keeping the yeast from reproducing, thus you have to 
make sure all the yeast has fallen out of solution.  Somebody correct me 
if I'm wrong.
        Secondly, by adding the extra sugar you may get gushers.  I would 
say that if you do this, chill the cider to near 0 C. so that it doesn't 
gush and you will also lose less of the CO2 in solution.
Hope this helps,
BrewWard

Hey,
        I'm having a problem with my cider carbonating.  I put in the 
same place along with me beer, but it seems it is taking forever.  Beer 
brewed at the same time is done and the cider has barely a bubble to be 
seen.  I added the same amount of corn sugar.  Does cider take longer to 
carbonate as it does to ferment?  Is this because of less nutrients?

I've sweetened my apple wine without a renewed ferment, and since I don't
filter, I have to believe that there was still *some* yeast in suspension.
I use Benzoate rather than sorbate, but I don't think that would make any
difference.


>Secondly, by adding the extra sugar you may get gushers.
Would adding the sugar in the form of a sugar/water syrup still cause a gusher?
I was under the impression that it was the grains of sugar that caused the
gushing by giving the bubbles something to form around.

I had my first explosions of cider after i substituted corn sugar with
Maple Syrup to prime my bottles.  Has this every happened to anyone before?
Does Maple Syrup cause more activitiy or do you think I was just careless
in my measurements?

Hi


Any brewers in Linkoeping, Sweden reading this?
Since I don't know any brewers here I would like to 
get in touch with a couple.
Please drop me an e-mail if interested.

hello!


This is Bill from Sonoma Cyder, a fledgling hard cider company attempting
to get on its feeble legs this fall.


I attended a winemaker's class at UC-Davis extension in April. During a
discussion on white wines, one of the winemakers said that they will add
saccharin (sp?) to add a little sweetness. Maybe this might work with
cider. My guess is that some commercial cider makers add apple concentrate
for sweetening. Another way to add sweetness is to retain some fresh juice
by freezing it unitl the main juice is fermented. At that time, you can
thaw the juice and add it to your cider, put it in the bottle and let it
ferment in the bottle. If you are very accurate with your measurements and
technique, it may be possible to ferment down to desired sweetness and then
pasteurize the juice in the bottle to stop the fermentation and retain some
sweetness and CO2. I am told that champagne makers will open a bottle
periodically to see how the bottle fermentation is going so they know when
to pasteurize the bottle.


Recently, we mixed two-thirds pear cider with one third fresh apple juice
and bottled it. The specific graivity was 1.015 at bottling. After a couple
of weeks, we started tasting the stuff. The pear cider is almost watery
tasting so the apple juice added some more flavor to the juice. The juice
had developed some spritz but it was very minimal. It was like drinking a
very clean white wine with some apple characteristic and lacking the
alcohol hotness. It did have alcohol and you could feel it after a glass or
two.


We are attempting to make a very natural style cider and we are debating
the level of clarity that we need. Some of the cider still has some solid
parts (the lees) at the bottom of the bottle, even after racking. Some of
our neighbors said that they like the flavor of the lees and that it would
bother them to see it in the bottom of the bottle. This is Northern
California though and people are into unfiltered apple juice anyway. Any
comments from the rest of you as to aesthetics versus flavor?


Aloha for now!
Bill
