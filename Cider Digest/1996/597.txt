I have had good results with using caramelized sugar added at bottling time
to sweeten the cider.  I don't however make carbonated cider, just still.  I
understand that woodchuck, a commercial brand, uses a similar technique.  I
actually got the idea from seeing caramelized sugar listed as an ingredient
on their label.
