        Isn't caramelized sugar just as fermentable as regular sugar?  I 
don't know anything about the ingredient.  I did have an idea.  Has 
anyone ever added chalk(CaCO3) to reduce the acidity of their cider.  I 
would think that would make it sweeter.  I won't  be able to try it for a 
while, but would like to know other's experiences.

Does anyone have experience (good or bad!) to report on the few cider
grinder/presses available in the US?


I seem to have been able to get the most info on the Happy Valley Ranch
setup.  All the characteristics look good...but does anybody have one and
care to comment on real results?  Are there others that I should be con-
sidering first?


[I've been somewhat haphazard in getting apples or juice, and in the grind/
press for apples, so far.  I'd like to make this all more predictable and
get higher quality.  Suggestions appreciated.]

   Turn off the tube.  Hang up the phone.  Get out of the car.  Log off.
   Get out and live for real!

I recently brewed two 9 gallon batches of cider.  Both were fresh cider 
with additional sugars for summer fortification.  Whitbread ale yeast was 
used in one batch and dry champagne yeast in the other.  Both batches 
were sulfited prior to pitching the yeasts (primed in 1 pint starters).  
The champagne yeast was very clean and with strong apple tones in the 
off-gas while the Whitbread reeked of sulfur.  Haven't bottled yet, so 
I'm not sure of flavor differences yet.
