I've made a number of cider batches with several different yeasts and
occasionally one will really stink of hydrogen sulfide.  In my experience,
this is MUCH more common with ale yeasts than with wine yeasts (although
I've tasted excellent ciders made with ale yeasts).  In all of these cases,
I'm referring to side-by-side fermentations of the same must.


Does anyone else share this experience? Does anyone have an explanation?

Some yeast strains naturally produce a significant amount of hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) gas during fermentation. I have never used Whitbread yeast, so
I can't comment on that one. However, this smell is common when making cider
(and lager beer) and in my experience it always dissipates with time. Last
fall I made a cider allowing the endemic microflora to produce a spontaneous
fermentation ("REAL" cider). This cider produced the most H2S I've ever
witnessed with any fermentation, and it smelled really bad for at least two
months. I figured it might not turn out. After another month it cleared and
smelled OK, but there was still a hint of H2S. Once I bottled it, the smell
was gone and it took first place in the cider category at the local competition.

The nicest presses I've sen are made by Correl in Oregon. Very expensive
(the small ones start around $350 and go up from there), but very well
designed and well made.


I don't have the address right at hand, but perhaps some other digester can
supply it. Or try directory assistance for Springfield, Ore.

I almost bought a complete set-up (grinder/press) from Happy Valley Ranch.
Then it occured to me that it might be worth while to see if I could buy
anything second hand.  Sure enough, I found a used grape press (brought over
from Italy many, many years ago) for a good price.  I never found a used
grinder, however, so I ended up buying a new one from Happy Valley Ranch.  The
fact that I live near the wine and grape regions of NY state probably increased
my odds of finding used pressing equipment.


Depending on the quantity of apples that you plan to press, you may be able to
build your own press.  I bought some plans (for less than a couple bucks) from
the NY State Agriculture Experimental Station in Geneva, NY.  They have a web
page, which I'll look up for anyone who's interested.

Happy Valley Ranch is the type of press that I own and I don't have 
any complaints about it. I highly recommend getting a wood sealer for 
it though. I put it off for a while and just used mineral oil to seal 
it and the wood started to get discolored and everything. It's a 
really nice press though!
Have fun!!
CHEERS!!!

I made a batch of cyser last fall that I was hoping would turn out to 
have a sweetness similar to Woodchuck. A goal it seems alot of people are
shooting for. It may have been dumb luck, but I got my sweet cider. I 
started with a high gravity, 1.095 and I used ale yeast. The yeast pooped
out after 2 1/2 months at a gravity of 1.065, so I pitched more ale yeast
and I got a final gravity of 1.024. The only downfall I can see to this 
is that it has a very high alcohol content, around 10% or so. If anyone 
wants the details and/or the recipe I used e-mail me at Day@a1.tch.harvard.edu 
FWIW, I kegged this, force carbonated it, and let my friends have at it 
this past Monday, and now my keg is almost empty.


Cheers,

I purchased the Happy Valley two bin press last year. I think it's called the
Rancher model or some such. About $700. With several friends we were able to
press about 20 gallons in a couple of hours with apples from my small
orchard. It is very tiring work and it helps to rotate the positions (feeding
apples, turning the grinder, positioning the jugs, cleaning the second bin).
The press did an ok job, but did not hold up well--several grinder teeth were
damaged. I really cannot highly recommend this machine. Instead, get a copy
of Fruit Grower magazine and look in the classifieds in the back. There are
several companies offering presses. Would like to hear what you decide on and
how it works.
