Although I don't know the URL for this page, I have found plans for an
inexpensive press on the web.  The plans are on Gillian Graftons homepage.
at http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/GraftonG/cider/homepage.html


If you do get a chance to look up URL for the NYSAES, I would be intersted
in it.  TIA Glenn

Regarding the questions of cider presses:


This is Bill Rhyne from Sonoma Cyder where we are using a Happy Valley
Grinder/press. It was recommended by other local cider people for small
batches. We crushed 1600 pounds in two afternoons with good results. No
electricity needed, just strong arms and a good nights rest.


For larger operations the Good Nature Company in Buffalo, NY or the Day
Equipment Co. in Indiana offer commercial mills/presses/grinder set-ups.


As for yeasts experimentations, we tried some lager yeasts and it stank and
tasted awful. Champagne yeasts offer better results. It might be
interesting to try a Reisling yeast if one can. If I try it, I will let you
know.


Regarding Sonoma Cyder, we recently are bottling 3 barrels of our first
batch to test the commercial waters. It is a blend of apple and pear cider.
Anyone want to try a bottle and give us feedback?
