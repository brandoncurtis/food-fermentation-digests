In response to yeasts for cider the comment about reisling yeasts is
a good one.  I have tried one available from Yeast culture kit
company called DL-47 (a release from Lalvin) which does wonders for
the quality of the product.  It is very clean (no harshness) and will
work quite well at low temps. down to slightly below 50 F.


        However, it is only available on slant so you will have to
make your own starters.

Has anyone received their score sheets from the cider contest that was 
 held as part of the AHA National Homebrew Competition?  Just curious...

I just noticed that the web page for the NY State Agricultural 
 Experimental Station has moved.  It's now located at:


http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu


These folks have one of the best known apple breeding programs in the 
 United States.

Just to keep this exhaustive thread going...I have found a way to make 
sweet cider.  I simply ferment the cider as usual, and then keg it.  When 
some friends are coming over, I pull out a 2 liter PET bottle and fill it 
3/4 full.  The remainder I fill w/ sugared apple juice.  It lacks the 
carbonation I like, but have have a fitting that allows me to force 
carbonate in the PET bottle.  Simple(enough), and sweet.
