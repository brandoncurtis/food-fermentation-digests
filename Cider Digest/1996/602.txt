Folks - I hope the digests will be back to a more normal schedule--that is
to say, back to only slightly erratic depending on volume of submissions,
rather than being wildly erratic for no apparent reason as they have been
for the past month-and-a-half.


Thanks for your patience--or if you weren't patient, thanks for not beating
me up over it!

I have just opened one of my raspberry ciders. It was very clear with sediment
on the bottom of the bottle.  Once opened volcano city and cider that looks like
mud.


I am conCIDERing inverting the bottle freezing the neck like slush. un capping
letting the slush out then recapping after top off.  any other ideas.

Been wanting to try this combination of cider and ale brewed together, so 
I set three test bottles aside.  Not bad.  Took it to the hb club 
meeting and it was well received by a wide array of tastes. Sort of like 
the beer and lemonade mixtures or beer and 7-UP. Light and refreshing for the
thrirsty.


The British army used to serve it to the troops and one mutiney occured 
because of the dilution of the strength of the brew.


Unfortunately I've mislaid the reference to what it is called.  I lent my 
cider book that had the details and it probably won't return.


Does anybody remember the historical name for cidre and ale fermented 
together? Are there recipes out there you'd recommend?  


Cheers,  jim booth, lansing, mi
