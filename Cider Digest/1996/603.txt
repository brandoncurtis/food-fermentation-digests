I think it's called braggot.


Or is that malt and honey...?

Hi.


Some advice for novice cider brewers, as well as the more experienced brewer
who has the occasional bad batch of cider. I've found that some of my earlier
batches of cider, which turned out fairly unpleasant to drink, make great
marinades and sauces for cooking. In fact, you could probably substitute
cider for white wine in any of a number of different recipes with great 
success.


So don't let fear of making bad cider stop you from brewing. Chances are, 
even if it's undrinkable, you can still put your product to good use.

Heya,
        I am planning on making a berry cider this summer.  I want to try 
it w/ and w/o apple juice.  I'm also concidering using elderberries, 
blackberries, salmonberries and huckleberries.  I don't plan on using 
them all together.  What I need is some help with how to handle fruit.  I 
don't have any fruit pressing material.  All along I've been just getting 
my apple juice from the store and adding yeast to it.  I love the 
resulting low alc% cider.  So, how can I do this w/ berries?

You could uncap all the bottles, and pour them into your bottling 
bucket.  Then just start over with the correct amount of priming sugar.  
How does this stuff taste?  Either you primed w/ too much sugar, didn't 
ferment fully, or you got an infection.  If its the latter, don't 
bother.  I rebottled a cider (I forgot to prime) and didn't notice any 
spoilage from oxygen.

        I've had overcarbonated ciders and I now use Grolsch bottles.  I 
can slip a bit of gas if the sediment boils off the bottom.  Also screw 
on caps can be opened slightly and then tightened.


        How to solve the crown cap bottled gusher problem?  I never did! 
Super chilling helps as does lifting the edge slightly to have an 
extended pressure release. Cheers...Jim Booth, lansing, mi
