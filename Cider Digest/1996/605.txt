Subject: Cold Cider - Slow (Dead?) Ferment

G'day. A week ago I put down another batch of Bride's Surprise Cider. The
only thing I didn't think about was that it was COLD downstairs where my
fermenting vessel lives - it's been floating at about 6-10 degrees Celsius.
There's been very little activity (none, actually) in the airlock, unlike
the last batch, so I've brought it upstairs, plonked it in front of the
heater and tried to bring it back up to around the 20 degree mark. However
it still looks pretty still. I have two questions:


1) If the wort chilled down to about 6 degrees within hours of pitching, is
the yeast likely to be dead?


2) Would the results be foul if I tossed in some generic beer yeast that
I've got on hand, to kick the process back to life?
