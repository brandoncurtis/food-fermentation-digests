Robert:

No. Yeast is pretty hardly; you can generally freeze yeast and not have it
die (though I can't say this with confidence about all strains). However,
when you pitch, it's best to have enough *active* yeast to get your must
(not "wort") going. At 6 .C, your yeast are probably sluggish at best. 


The problem you have now is revitalizing the yeast you have in suspension
without revitalizing the other nasties that are also inevitably in
suspension. I'd raise the temperature to somewhere between the 15-20 .C
mark, then repitch more active yeast.


Also, as a matter of standard procedure, you should also think about
pitching your yeast into starters, which are just smaller batches of must,
waiting until that batch is active, and then pitching the entire starter
into your must. That way, your concentration of active yeast going into your
must is high enough to dominate the nasties and ensure an active fermentation.

When pitching store-bought yeast, my preference is for ale yeast: you get a
less sharply alcoholic drink than you would with wine yeasts. 




Cheers,
Ron

Re: Cold Cider and fermentation


6-10 degrees does not appear to be to cold but it depends on the type of
yeast. Some yeasts prefer warm temperatures and some like cooler
temperatures. The yeast package will tell you what the characteristics are.
We have done cool fermentation and it can take 3-5 weeks but the results
seem better than fast fermentations. We are using champagne yeasts though,
not beer yeasts.


Need to know specifics, I guess.


Good luck!

Hi Folks,


What would you call a very stong mead made using champane yeast
that has had additions of:
 
1. 1lb of light malt powder
2. 3 gallons of Apple Juice
3. 1lb raisons
4. 1/2 gallon cherry juice
5. 1/2 gallon grape juice
6. Some Ginger - added to secondary for 3 weeks




I probably will name it the kitchen sink brew. So far it is 
smelling great and is tasting real nice. Probably ready in 
a couple of weeks. Any Offical type name for a mess like this?
