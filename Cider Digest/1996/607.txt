This is definately a melomel, except for the malt extract (which I would 
have left out, myself).  The ginger would tend to place it in the 
category of metheglyn, but I am guessing that the amount of ginger was 
small and had little effect on the end result, which was primarily 
influenced by the fruit juices.  I have never made a melomel with all of 
these ingredients at the same time, but I have used each of them 
individually.  I like an apple methegly with cinnamon and cloves in 
addition to the ginger, myself.

Thanks to everyone who responded to by plaintive bleat about my cold cider.
The consensus was "it's probably ok, just slow, so leave it alone". I have
done, and will bottle this weekend - a quick gravity test a few days ago
showed that the yeasty beasties have been doing their thing in a desultory
sort of fashion.


What have I learnt from this?


1) If you're going to leave cider to ferment somewhere cold, get the yeast
of to a good start first to help it along.


2) Don't panic - if you're taking care to avoid infections, it doesn't
really matter how long the process takes.

FWIW, I've recently done a couple of batches, including five gallons of cider, 
nutrient, and ale yeast (munton and edme). Primary was two weeks, and 
secondary was one month. It's a traditional English cider, and comes out great 
every time except that it's always a little tangy for my tastes. 


A few months ago a fellow from Wales posted here his suggestion that the 
solution to difficulties sweetening cider can be solved by bottling and 
stirring in a teaspoon when it's served. Although I've always aimed to have a 
product can be served straight from the bottle, I've decided that this is the 
best way to serve this kind of cider. It is also the easiest. I no longer have 
the Welsh guy's address, but hope that he reads this. It's been a real hit 
here with my cider-snob friends and relatives. Try it out!
