I'm glad someone found the advice useful! I prefer my cider absolutely bone dry,
but most people want it sweetened by varying degrees - this is a flexible 
solution. Unfortunately, many of the small cider producers in the UK add 
artificial sweeteners to their Ciders before serving - a hideous practice IMHO.
