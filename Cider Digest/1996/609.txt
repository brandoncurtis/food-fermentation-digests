I just managed (after unvoluntarily making a few bombs) to make
a really nice Sweet and Sparkling Cider.  When I bottled, I put
the regular priming sugar at the bottom of the plastic bottles.
After a week and a half to two weeks I released the pressure 
from the bottles and quickly screwed the caps back on.  I then
added to the bottles a parts of a sugar syrup (sweetness depending on 
your taste).  After a week or so I chilled a few and it was nicely 
carbonated and sweet.

Jeez guys if you want a sweet cider do it the simple way. Use a yeast that
doesn't eat everything. I have successfully used a wine yeast to make
several meads and ciders that turn out with a good body, no unpleasant off
tastes and a very nice balanced sweetness with an Epernay II dry yeast culture. 


If you want a bone-dry (yuck) cider you can re-ferment half of it with
another yeast. Simple.


good luck, Gord

Many thanks to all the folks who wrote to me concerning the making of
cider.


I had never even heard of cider before.... I made my first 2 batches
in the last 4 weeks.  Wow!!  My friends really liked the rasberry
cider, and even the remaining bottles of the first batch of plain
cider (the rest were grenades).


Why isn't there more traffic on this digest?  Cider is great!!!


Thanks again.

O.K.
Dear Gillian


I'm interested about the cider world, but particularity on (cider
fermentation or apples fermentation) by concentrate. Normally, you
make cider from apple juice. But I want to make cider from
concentrate.


I would like that you send me information about it, if you can.
But basically, I'm trying to make it industrially or in mass
quantities. I need information of requeriments and processes.


Thank you.
     Bye
    Jose Luis Aladro A.
