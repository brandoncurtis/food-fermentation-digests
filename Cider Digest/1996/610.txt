Gord,


So you have a wine yeast that will ferment a cider from 1055 down to 1010 and 
stop of it's own accord? Really?

I have six apple trees and 75-99% of the apples have minor to major damage from
the coddling moth larvae.  (75% if this year's organic coddling moth batttle is
successful).  If I crush the apples will the insect damage make a horrible
taste?  Otherwise I will have to cut out the damage from each apple.

Hi. I'm new to this newsletter, and I know I don't know much, but here is my
method of making sweet sparkling draft cider:
- -Ferment 4 gal apple juice with Champagne yeast, pectinase, and yeast
nutrient.
- -Rack and add potassium sorbate stabilizer. Wait half hour.
- -Add Sparkeloid and 1 gal apple juice plus 1 to 2 cups honey (warmed in some
of the juice). Wait 1-7 days to clear.
- -Rack to keg or PETE bottles and force carbonate @ 2-2.5 vol. 
You can use whatever juice you want, but I won the AHA National silver medal
in 1995 with regular grocery store jugs of pastuerized juice. I make this all
year round with consistent results and all my friends love it. It's way
better than Woodpecker.


Cheers,
Scott Christensen

Hi


Sorry for the request, I'll keep it short. John (?) Ponsford 
contacted me about a cider apple called Ponsford. My mail system 
crashed and took out his message with some others too. If you're 
reading this and know Mr. Ponsford, please ask him to contact me 
again.
