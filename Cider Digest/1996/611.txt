This is a non-message for the digest, just to let you know that it's alive
and well but lacking material.


If you've got something to say, now's a good time to say it.  Don't feel
obliged to write...the current lull is perfectly normal because of the
seasonal nature of cider.  We're all sitting here, with last year's cider
all done and either in bottles or mostly gone, but waiting for this year's
harvest to begin.


Things should pick up in a few weeks.  Bear with us.
