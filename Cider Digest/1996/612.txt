Is it possible to over-ferment cider, and thus get a yeast bite?
My guess is that if you're using a low alcohol-tolerance yeast 
(like a lager yeast), it's not, because the yeast will stop 
fermenting, not because it runs out of sugar, but because there 
is too much alcohol.


In Christ,

Hello,
        You may think that we've beat this subject to death, but I would 
like to add something I don't think anyone has mentioned before.  I found 
this herb sold as stevia.  It's supposed to be super sweet (1tsp.=1 cup 
sugar) and it is non-fermentable.  I haven't bought any yet, but a friend 
told me about it.  Any insight?  I wanted to try it first, but it 
wouldn't be fair to withhold info. :)

Dick...I publish What's On Tap, a newsletter covering craft beer, but in
the last year I've gotten very interested in cider and, among other things
(being an inveterate list maker) I've begun compiling a listing of all the
commercial cider makers in the U.S. A year ago, that was easy. Today, it's
harder.  There are some neat people making cider out there, farmers with
antique apple orchards who have been making cider as a hobby for years,
city folks who have been doing the same thing in the kitchen, others who
visited the south of Englanfd or France and discovered that cider is more
than apple juice _  as well as the inevitable entrepreneurs who want to be
tomorrow's Jim Koch of cider.
        Anyway, I'm looking for names, addresses, phone numbers,  if
possible of commercial or soon-to-be commercial cidermakers. Also, will
send (no charge) anyone who asks my listings so far.
Thanks. Bill Brand/What's On Tap/Berkeley, CA.

Hi All


I've been thinking of putting in a coupple of apple trees for cider 
making purposes. 


Do any of you out there know of any good varieties (that are 
available in Australia)? I have heard that a mix of eating apples and 
crab apples makes a good cider too. Has anyone else heard this? I 
have a crab abble tree that produces lots of fruit and there's only 
so much crab apple jelly a man can eat ;-)


Cheers
David Martin

I have a vertical hydraulic log splitter that sits behind a tractor.


Seems like it would be very easy to develop a press that uses this for
pressure. Anyone done anything of the sort or have plans for such a thing?


I'd like to make a press what would use the splitter; I'd just place whole
apples in the fabric package (what's it called) instead of pulverizing first
 I've seen it done that way and it looked like it was working just fine.
Any reason not to do that? What sort of fabric is best for this task ... a
canvas?

Its Labor day.  We were traveling the southern areas of our great state of
Michigan in search of the best cider apples.  Yes, there are orchards that
tend Roxbury Russets, Cox's Orange Pippins, Kingston Black, Winesaps and on.
One has to look HARD but they are available.  So, upon stopping at the Fenn
Valley winery (anyone had Fenn Vally Wine????), we picked up a brochure
regarding Tree-Mendus Fruit farms in Eau Claire, Michigan.  They list a web
site as follows:  http://park.org/Pavilions/FoodAndMarkets.  Careful of the
capitol letters, UNIX I believe.  Anyhoo,  these people will ship apples
anywhere and will accept VISA and MC.  Bonus.  We called and the prices are
a bit steep i.e. $1.28/lb. approx.  Order number is 1-800-957-4735 except
Tuesday.  Finally, standard disclaimer - I have no connection with these
people, never been there, but I am going to check them out this fall for
those certain apples.


Kevin Sprague, Grand Rapids, MI - Have planted 50 trees.  50 more next year.
Hope to be in business in a couple of years. Cheers.  Rat and Pond Cider Co.

I have the good fortune of living in an area that produces both apples 
 and wine grapes.  I was thinking about making a champagne like 
 beverage based on a blend of apple and wine grape juice.  I have 
 access to juice from champagne grapes, which I would blend in a 1:1 
 ratio with cider made from dessert apples (the grape juice ought to 
 substitute for the other types apples, right?).


Before I jump into this, I thought I would consult with the experts on 
 this list to learn if anyone has tried this before.  I could not find 
 any discussion about blending apples and grapes in any of my cider 
 books.  Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.


Thanks,
