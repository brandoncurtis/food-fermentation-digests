I thought I'd had the digest set to send an issue automatically while I was
gone.  Seems I set things up but didn't activate them.  Sorry for the delay
since the last digest.


There is some halfway-plausible excuse--I was off in England drinking...er,
tasting...cider, plus visiting the Cider and Perry Festival at Brogdale,
about which I hope to write here soon.


We now return you to your irregularly scheduled broadcast...

I have no idea, and I'm not clever about this sort of thing,
but I have a horizontal log splitter that runs off
the hydraulics on my tractor (an ancient but faithful Ford
801), and would love to see any information you get about using 
such a thing to power a cider press.

Hi All
Pickleman asked about an herb called Stivia for possible use in 
sweetening cider.  Stevia rebaudiana is a native of Paraguay. 
Stevioside is found in the leaves and stems of this plant and is 300x 
as sweet as cane sugar according to the Merck Index.  It has been used 
as a non-nutrative sweetener in Japan, South Korea and Brazil for years 
but has not been approved for use in the US. Use of the herb is,I 
believe, not regulated as the pure substance seems to be here in the 
States.  The Merck makes mention of B linkages so I can assume that it 
is not fermentable.  I've never tried the herb or the active stuff 
myself but it seems like a good possible candidate from here.
Coincidentally,  I heard an NPR broadcast with Scott Simon a few weeks 
ago concerning this very critter.
Cheers!
  --Steve

Has there been any evidence of clear bottles harming cider? I understand
that Seven Sisters uses/has used, and I am looking for technical info on
this. Any ideas?

Whoops, one more thing. From whom did you get that info - you mentioned an
ag station in England, I believe. Tell me more if you would, this is
interesting.

I'm a biochemist and hobby cider maker in the south of England. Some years
ago I wrote a series of six articles on small-scale cidermaking for a UK
hobby magazine called Home Farm.  Since this didn't  have a very wide
circulation, and the copyright in the articles is mine, I've put them on
the Net.  You can get at them via my home page at

Hope some people out there might find them useful!
