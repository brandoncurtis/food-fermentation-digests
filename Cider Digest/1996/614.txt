I've been bottling cider in clear glass soft drink bottles (mostly 16-oz
Pepsi and Coke bottles) for years, and have never had a problem.  A couple
sat out in the sun for a few hours this summer, and there was no
degradation in flavor.

Hi,
        I did finally try a stevia cider.  Actually, I made a tea w/ the 
stevia herb and added it to a glass of cider.  It tasted pretty bad.  
appearantly the herb in leaf form imparts a slight bitter taste along 
with its cloying sweetness.  Not at all what I like to taste in cider.  
The tea also had incredible body.  I may have to try some of this in 
beer.  I think it could make an interesting sweet stout.  As for cider, 
back to the drawing board.

I've been making cider for quite a few years now, but always
bottling the results.  A beer making friend of mine has 
offered me one of his kegs to store/serve some of this years 
production.  We've had no trouble with beer in these kegs and 
I know stainless is used extensively in winemaking, but 
because of the higher acidity in cider, could there be some 
sort of leaching (metallic taste) problem using cider in these 
kegs?

The raw apple cider I can get most easily is lacking in tannin.  I bought 
a small container of grape tannin at a wine and beer making store.  Does 
anyone know how much powdered grape tannin to add to five gallons of 
cider to perk it up without ruining it?


Thanks,  John Gilmour

In conducting a cider tasting, we felt that the American Homebrewers Cider
styles list was limited, so we came up with a more inclusive list for cider
styles. Please let us know what you think of it, comments, corrections,
etc. Its posted on the Cider Space web site at


http://www.teleport.com/~incider/ciderstyles.html


Thanks,
