I am going to attempt making some hard cider this fall. What I would like to
know is:


What experiences does this group have with using cider with preservatives,
specifically sorbates? I have purchased preservative-free cider for my first
attempt, but I would like to know if any of you have had success with cider
that has preservatives in it.

Well, I bought a bunch of unpreserved, unfiltered plastic jugs of
"cider" from a local orchard, gave it champagne yeast, and got VERY
turbid results from the primary fermenter.  I added pectin, a touch
of white sugar, and put it up in Grolsch bottles.  It precipitated
out ALL the solids, making a gorgeous, well-carbonated straw-colored
fluid that was VERY alcoholic (about 7%, if my math is right),
tasting little of apples.  I was shooting for something like the 
cider one gets in England (my wife doesn't like very hoppy beers), 
and got something I didn't quite expect.  I posted a note to this 
list reporting on it, asking what I got; the answer came back:  
cider, of course, just the kind that gets you very drunk very 
quickly.  I also put a gallon jug in the fridge & let it alone to do 
its own thing.  Got cider there, too, but the wild yeasts produced a 
less-drinkable result.

Re: grape tannin, how much?


I would have to agree with the comments made in the last digest by D.
Prescott. Powdered grape tannin is powerful stuff. It is far better to err on
the side of caution because too much grape tannin will cause your cider to
taste like a 2 by 4. 


I would go with 1/8th tsp per 5 gallons and see if you like the taste. The
idea of starting with a quart of cider was a good one but I wonder if you
want to add the tannin before or after fermenting. 


I have always added the tannin prior to fermenting and I would think it
difficult to judge the effect of added tannin in fresh juice on the final
fermented drink.

Seeing the posts on stainless, I was wondering if it would be OK to
use my immersion chiller to cool down cider (I want to kill yeast
without using sulphur)?

Subject: "Off" flavors in cider batches

I have been making cider for 4-5 years now and I have a consistent =
problem. I get a "fruity?" (hard to define) taste/smell in the batches. =
It is most noticable when I first open a bottle. The smell dissipates =
after a couple minutes but some of the taste remains. It is slight =
enough that most people do not notice but since I drink quite a bit of =
hard cider I do. I have only tried other commerical ciders, not anyone =
else's homebrewed varieties. The result is that I do not know if this is =
endemic to homemade hard cider or if it is something in my process.


In my batches I have used a wide variety of apples. I usually add some =
acid blend and grape tannin if the mix is not tart enough. I have used =
Red Star Champagne yeast but I now have switched to Epenary II or Wyeast =
Ale yeasts. Low acid blends tend to have this smell/taste moreso but =
even high acid blends have it to some degree. It seems to me that my =
second batches that are put down in November are better than the earlier =
ones put down in September. My basement is in the mid sixties before =
winter sets in. I have wondered if this is too warm. My guess is that =
either I am being too picky or I am experiencing some other process in =
my cider such as the yeast autolyzing. The problem is subtle enough and =
I am not experienced enough to make any definitive call on this. Any =
comments are welcome.

Heya,
        I am on my 4th batch of cider.  I just pitched the starter, and I 
know the time to adjust the must is now.  I have reserved some juice for 
testing.  I've read that pH of juice is usually 2.9-3.3, so I couldn't 
see added gypsum or CaCO3 for that reason.  I have an acid test kit, and 
think I'm now ready to use it.  The kit has recommended levels of acid 
for different wines, but this cider will only be about 6% alc.  Should I 
raise the acid level to .60% as it suggests for fruit wine?  I would like 
this cider to be as sweet as possible.  How do I add CaCO3 to the cider?

I didn't get any answer to this, so I'm sending it again...

RE: Maceration and tannin


This is Bill Rhyne from Sonoma Cyder (a nano-cidery..smaller than micro).
We have been reading from an English translation of a French cider making
manual written by Warcollier. In France, maceration of milled apple pulp
was a common practice but it is a labor intensive practice so some cideries
have skipped.


The maceration time can vary from 12-24 hours depending on the kind of
fruit that one has. Also, an apple with high tannin levels should not be
exposed to air during this process as it will oxidise (sp?) and it will
result in loss of tannin in the final cider.


One of the main reasons maceration is performed is to increase the yield.
During maceration, the broken tissues progressively soften, a proportion of
cells die, and the cell fluids are released.


We tried it last year with some pippins and some golden delicious. The
pippins have a lot more tannin than the golden delicious, they keeved well,
and they had plenty of acid. The juice was very clear. The Goldens had less
tannin (less discoloration when exposed to air), did not keeve or clarify
as well, but they had plenty of sugar, a nice aroma, and tasted pretty
good. The Golden juice was very hazy but pretty. We blended it with the
pippins in different proportions and a 60%golden/40%pippin blend with
residual sweetness tasted excellent.
This year, we are trying a batch of Greening apples and then we are going
to purchase more varieties that are available here in Sonoma to evaluate
their cider characteristics.


To summarize Warcollier's writings in this area, to make good cider you
need high  sugar, acid, and tannin, and maceration helps the different
parts of the apple get to know each other before going to press.


Aloha!
