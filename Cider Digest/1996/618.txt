Subject: help ID this cider apple?
From: rcd@raven.talisman.com (Dick Dunn)

I managed to get some true cider apples from an orchardist who has been
experimenting with them but didn't have tiem to pick them this year.


One variety has me puzzled--I'm pretty sure he's got it mis-marked, but I
can't tell what it really might be.  He had it marked "Dakinett" and I
would have assumed that was just an obvious slip from "Dabinett" except
that the characteristics don't match the information I have on Dabinett,
nor does the fruit look like Dabinetts I've seen.  Can anybody identify
this one?
OK, the mystery apple:
  * obviously a cider apple, a bittersweet.
  * said by this orchardist "to bloom a full two weeks after everything
    else...I don't know how it gets pollinated!"  In Colorado, with our
    potential for late frosts, this is something he would obviously note
    with interest and care.  This really doesn't fit Dabinett.
  * color: deep red.  (This also doesn't fit Dabinett.)  Slight streaking.
    Occasional slight russeting at cavity.
  * fruit size/shape: small-to-medium (1.5-2.5"/4-6cm dia., around 2-3 oz/
    60-90 g typ), round, slight lobes at apex, fairly shallow basin,
    narrow cavity of average depth.
  * quite aromatic--a handful of apples will perfume a room


There's a good chance he may have gotten the tree from Southmeadow.


Any guesses or hints?

I suppose it all depends on your definitions of "sweet" and "natural".


I regularly make a 5-gallon batch of semi-dry cider.  All I do is boost the
sugar content of the must with honey or by concentrating it by boiling off
some water.  Then I use an ale yeast, such as Wyeast Irish Ale or Red Star
dried ale yeast.  It ferments to about 8-10% alcohol, leaving a hint of
residual sweetness.


If you want something as sweet as a late-harvest "ice wine", or a wine
cooler, then, no, this won't work.  My cider is usually comparable in
dryness (and alcohol content) to a semi-dry white wine, like a
Gewurztraminer (sp?).


I'm going to try a batch this week-end using some recultured Wyeast German
Ale yeast form an Altbier that I made last spring.  I'll let y'all know how
it turns out.

I'd like to make a cranberry cider this year.  I've already 
started the cider and would like to 'cheat' by adding frozen 
cranberry concentrate to the cider (along with enough sugar to 
keep the SG up).  The ingredients on the concentrate I'm 
looking at are: Water, Sugar, Cranberry concentrate, cranberry 
juice and Ascorbic Acid.


What will Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C ?) do to the cider - stop 
the ferment? add off-flavours? make it bitter?


Anybody have info on this?\


On a sidelight - It's a pleasure to see the knowledgeable 
answers coming from Andrew Lea - I really appreciate his 
insights.

I was wondering if anyone has had experimented with heating bottles of 
cider in water to kill all activity of yeast and bacteria.  I am curious 
if this would cause a haze to develop if the cider has finished clear. 
Also is there a taste change that delvelops when doing this.  I have a 
feeling that since nobody is talking about this that there must be some 
reason that it does not work well. I had a vision of adding fresh cider 
before bottling letting it ferment until I've reached the carbonation I 
want and then heating the bottles in water to stop all activity.

I was recently offered a supply of apples and I'd like to
beg/borrow/rent/swap/share a cider press if anyone has
access to one. Would also be interested in plans to construct
a small press if anyone has any ideas (for next year?)


Thanks in advance,


Hal

Subject: Cider - residual sweetness
From: "Kevin Sprague" <homebrew@ix2.ix.netcom.com>

Hello all!


It is cider time.  In the throws of building a home press (per Oct. 
issue of Mother Earth News) and trying to finish it in time to press 
apples.  I have a thought for the collective regarding ending up with 
a sweet cider. 


Per the Homebrew Digest (I brew beer also), I has been stated 
numerous times that upon racking from the primary to the secondary,  
yeast settles out of solution very rapidly due to changes in 
volumetric pressure.  If one were to rack a few times successively 
over the course of several days, could one not cause the majority of 
the yeast to settle out of solution thus ending with a sweet 
cider????


Anyone had any experience with this method of making sweet cider? 
Maybe a physics pro or someone could comment on the pressure change 
phenomenon.
Kevin

I don't recall reading about this in past issues, but how long 
can a batch of cider, with an alcohol content of around 6% be 
expected to stay good. Judging from my beers, I would guess 
about 11 months to a year at the outside. Anyone know better?

The October/November 1996 issue (#158) of "Mother Earth News" has a couple
articles about apples that might be of background interest if you're think-
ing of growing your own apples, plus an article on constructing a cider
press.  (There's no specific discussion of (fermented) cider.)


The cider-press construction article boils down to using the commercial
Happy Valley Ranch hardware--grinder, top and bottom brackets and press
screw--with home-made wood parts.  I think it's an OK article, although
I found a few strange ideas.  For example, they suggest coating the wood
parts that will contact juice with vegetable oil (because they don't want a
wood finish that might contain toxic resins, etc.).  My experience says
that vegetable oil is going to turn rancid eventually and that will leave
you with an unpleasant refinishing job.  But anyway...you might have a look
at the article; just keep your eyes open.


(I don't know that Mother Earth News has much distribution beyond the US
and Canada.)
