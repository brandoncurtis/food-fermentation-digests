I'm interested in the use of SO2 as a stabilizing agent; however, I'm
allergic to sulfites and have a severe reaction to them.  Is SO2 a
sulfite, and if so is there an alternative?  I'd _really_ like to be
able to drink what I make without a trip to the hospital!


Thanks in advance,
Danielle

I have used cranberry & cranraspberry concentrate in several batches 
of cider. It turns out terrific, and the final product has a beautiful
rosy-orange color to it. Technically it's more a cyser than a cider, I
use honey, brown sugar & raisins to boost the fermentables and to leave
some residual sweetness. Anyone who wants details can feel free to e-mail
me. I kegged & force carbonated last year's batch & served it at a 
cookout on Memorial Day, needless to say my homebrew was ignored and the
the cider keg was dry by the end of the day.

     To All -
     
     Recently I made a cider and during the first racking I sampled a bit 
     to examine the flavor.  I made the cider with 3 gallons of fresh 
     pressed cider, 2 cans of apple juice concentrate and 1 cup of brown 
     sugar (initial gravity about 1.070).  I also added pectic enzyme and 
     yeast nutrient.  I fermented with the natural yeast found in the 
     cider.  The fermentation took off rather quickly (after about 3 days) 
     and went for about 10 days.  The gravity after fermentation was about 
     1.015 (which doesn't really bother me). The taste of the cider is 
     terrible, though.  There is a residual taste similar to burned 
     cardboard.  Is this common when using wild yeast.  Should I just let 
     it sit and see what happens.  After about two weeks in secondary, the 
     cider has cleared rather well, but I haven't tasted it since my 
     initial taste.

In CD619, Dick Dunn asked about a source of Stainless Steel hardware.
I thnk that your best bet would be McMaster Carr, P.O. Box 4355, Chicago IL
60600, tel 708-834-9600.  They carry a buch of stuff that yo may find
useful.  No affiliation, etc...

To whom it may concern,


=09Contact these people if you want to try stevia as a nonfermentable=20
sweetener.  They sent me a baggie for=20
nothing just to try it.  I found that it has some grassy note to it as=20
well as sweetness.  It may work in making a sweet stout, where the hops=20
have their own grassy notes that would overpower that of the stevia, but=20
as far a cider is concerned, I'm still searching for a acceptable sweetener=

I have used the method of pastuerizing live sweet cider in the bottle after a
few days of carbonating, as discussed (618, 619). This was years ago when I
first started making cider, and I can tell you it is a thrilling procedure.
The first time I did it,  I lowered the bottles in a rack into fairly hot
water and proceded to heat over stupidly high heat until they began to
explode. I lost 4 or 5 of the 12 I heated, and decided not to do the rest. I
opted rather for refrigeration and quick comsumption. 


Some weeks later after regaining my nerve I tried again, this time with fewer
bottles and gentler heat. I lowered the bottles into warm water and heated
over low heat  until the first one exploded then turned the heat off. A
couple more popped soon after. The water temp was 133 F, quite a bit lower
than the 68-75 C suggested by Mr. Lea in the last Digest. I don't know for
sure whether the yeast was all killed off or not, since I refrigerated these
as well. 


My conclusion at the time was that it might be possible to succeed at 128-130
F, and hold for a longish time. I never tried it though; I bought some soda
kegs instead and now force carbonate everthing. If you try this, WEAR EYE
PROTECTION, etc.


Good luck,

I've got access to frozen apple juice (recently-pressed, no preservatives
added) and would like to try a natural fermentation, i.e. I won't pitch any
yeast.  Will there be viable "wild" yeast in the frozen juice, or does
freezing the juice wipe them out?  Any advice?
