This year I found that the cider my local orchard was selling contained some 
(less than .01%) potassium sorbate preservative. I let the cider stand 
refrigerated for about two weeks to let the preservative dissipate (this was 
actually close to the expirartion date stamped on the jugs). I mixed up a 5 
gallon batch with 2 packs of Lavlin 1118 champagne yeast and the cider took off 
with no problem. It has been about a week now and the process is looking much 
like that of previous batches with unpreserved cider. And those batches came 
out great.


Good Luck,


Bob

Subject: increasing fermentable sugars

I'm just breaking into the craft of cidermaking, and I found a recipe for a
pretty basic cider.  I'd like to increase the fermentable sugars in my next
batch, but I was looking for some suggestions of ways to accomplish this.
One idea I was  presented with was to boil the fresh cider down before
pitching your yeast (say from 7 gallons down to around 5).  It was also
suggested that I might add raisins or some other fruit, which would both
increase the sugars and add a unique taste.  Does anyone have any
suggestions as to which of these is better, or any other ideas for me?  I'd
appreciate it.

Cider colleagues --


An informal report on apples and cider-making conditions in southern
Wisconsin for 1996:


Sad to say, a pretty bad year for apples here.  We didn't seem to have a
bee pollination problem that was predicted to occur as the result of the
bee-mite infestation, but an early freeze last fall stressed nearly all
the trees of my favorite cider-specific varieties such as Cox's Orange
Pippen, Colville blanc d'Hiver, Cornell Sours, and the like, and there
was none of these available this year.  However, the summer was mild with
enough moisture, so I got 18 gallons from five bushels of Cortlands, Russets
and Northern Spies.  I added to this the juice from a bucket of Dolgo crabs
to boost the tannin -- not my favorites, but none other available this year.
Sugar was OK at about 1.045, so I look forward to a quite drinkable if not
terribly distinguished product come March or April.  Happily, since I like
to keep cider in a long secondary and then age it for at least 6 months, I
have 90% of my '95 vintage available and about 20% of the '94.  So aside 
from the greatly added complexity and smoothness afforded by waiting, the
availability of cider from good seasons of the past enables me to withstand
problem years.  Glad to hear that conditions elsewhere were better.


For folks in the N. Illinois/So. Wisconsin area, I will try to get on the
ball earlier next year and report on the crop sooner.  I have a pretty good
notion of where decent apples can be had in the area, and I would be happy to
point these out to those interested via E-mail, below.  Good fermenting to
all!

I know my cider is 'fresh'...just bottled it tonight.  But like
I usually do with my beers, I decided to drink a glass of it as-is
to see how it was.  My first impression was good, that it turned out
to have good balance of flavor etc., and that it didn't taste too much
like wine (OG 1.045, FG 0.998).  I boiled 3/4 cup corn sugar in a cup
of water, primed the cider with it, and bottled it.  Since I was in a
hurry, I didn't bottle every last drop.  There was about 3-4 cups left
in the bottling bucket left that I put into a pitcher and then into
the refrigerator.  After a couple of hours of cooling, I had another
glass..and was met by a mild SO2 smell (eggy smell) when I opened the
pitcher and a bit from the glass I had poured.  I assume that this is
normal and will age out of the cider over time.  Is that so?  I dumped
the 'fresh' cider and decided to wait on the bottles.  I'm planning on
opening them around christmas or so (8 weeks from now).  Should I expect
it to be ok by then?


Thanks,
Brian


PS: This is my first attempt at cider.

 I'm a newbie to the Cider Digest and am in need of a recipe for sparkling 
 cider.  I am currently fermenting 5 gal of Apple/Pear juice sweetened with 
 3 lbs brown sugar and 3 lbs honey:  starting gravity was 18 brix.  I need 
 to know when and how to prime and bottle my creation.

My previous post left out the vitals for some reason, so here goes 
again.  Like I said, I didn't have any luck w/ stevia for a cider 
sweetener, but I am still working on it.  I may try an alcohol extraction 
instead of boiling to avoid the bitter and grassy flavors I found.  This 
is where I got the supplies.  No affiliation yadda yadda, just nice folks 
I'd like to send business to. --

Just to keep everyone up to date re:using concentrates with 
Ascorbic Acid:


I added 500 ml of cranberry concentrate containing ascorbic 
acid (reconstituted to 1.070) to a 4 Litre jug and topped up 
with actively fermenting cider. All is well - it is still (5 
days later) fermenting nicely.


The experiment went so well I've also tried 500 ml of 
Raspberry concentrate and 500 ml of Peach concentrate in two 
other 4L jugs.


No idea yet if 500 ml is the correct amount for flavour/colour 
but will keep you informed.  I'll probably add lactose to 
offset the cranberry astringency.

Can anyone comment on freezing dry yeast.  It seems that I had to 
purchase a large quantity (500g can) of Lalvin (sp.) S6U yeast to perform 5 
gallon test batches of cider.  Once I opened the can it is open.  
What can I do with the remaining yeast to keep it useable??  I have 
placed it in freezer bags and put it in a tupperware container in the 
refrigerator.  Any comment.
