An expert that recently posted to rec.crafts.brewing stated that e. coli
can live in beer and similar anaerobic environments such as cider.  The
"no know pathogens can survive in beer" quote comes from people who may
know of some risk but choose not to verbalize it because they want to
popularize beer brewing at home.  They feel safe because there are no
records of anyone ever having gotten an e. coli infection from beer.
It important to note that the environment in beer and cider does inhibit
the growth of most bacteria, and that includes e. coli.  Infections would
most likely be low at the most.  AND, since most bacteria in the e. coli
family are not harmful (you already have them in your gut), the risk that
you get one of the few that present you with a risk of death is extremely
low.  Apple juice and cider coming from windfalls have higher risk of
carrying e. coli bacteria if the orchard is a multi-use orchard acting as
a stock pasture at the same time.  Apple juice, because it is a good 
growth medium, has a much higher risk of having an e. coli infection than
cider.  The bottom line is that beer and cider makers probably don't have
to worry much about it, but you should always practice excellent sanitation
measures, which includes not using downfalls from orchards where animals
roam and not doing things like handling fresh uncooked meats while
setting up your cider or when handling apples (etc) or when brewing either.
David Miller in "The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing" specifically states
that e. coli strains of bacteria are anaerobit and can live in environments
like brewed and fermented beer (just in case anyone wants a published
reference).  I'm not aware of any publications that state something similar
for cider, but it is not very different than fermented beer as a growth
environment.

How cold will champagne yeast ferment down to?  60F?  40F?  How about white
wine yeast?
Thanks,
