We wouldn't?  Why not?  I pasteurized my first batch.  Best batch I ever 
brewed (okay, I've only brewed two batches, and the second one isn't as 
good as the first).


Now, if they start requiring preservatives, that's another story, of course.

Does anyone in this group have information on the effect of potassium
metabisulfite on E. coli?  Also, might this treatment be an acceptable form
of "pasteurization" from the standpoint of either the CDC or the FDA?

My Lalvin Champagne 1118 batch is having a hard time at 62 degrees.  
Fermentation is very slow, though I double-pitched (twice the normal 
amount of yeast), aerated well, etc.

I'm starting to wonder if my memory was serving me right or not, because
the quote you have stated above certainly sounds familiar to what I
was remembering, but it clearly takes an opposite stance to what I was
thinking.  I'd be getting pretty picky about terms if I argued that
"no longer function" meant "dying" or "dormant".  I'm sure that if Dave
meant "dormant", then he'd have said so (especially given his statement
about 'no known pathogens can survive' and all that.)  I'm going to go
double check the book myself, but for now I'm going to stand humbly
corrected until someone else can show that E. coli can indeed survive
in beer.  Thanks for doing what I should have, Timothy...you took a
careful look at the text to verify things a second time!


As far as cider goes, I would expect that if beer is safe, then cider
would certainly be safe since the final pH of cider is going to be
in the mid-3's to the low-4's, which even lower than beer's range of
the low- to mid-4's, and since Miller mentioned pH (not something else)
as the environmental change that prevents E. coli from being able to
function.

Every one of my three children has, at one time or another, expressed
interest in what I'm drinking, and sometimes I'm drinking something
with alcohol when then they do this.  I've always let them have a sip
or two.  Usually they only want a sip or two, but sometimes I have to
give them something else to distract them.  I don't think I'm being
even the slightest bit irresponsible doing this.  I want my kids to
have a healthy attitude about drinking, and therefore I'm avoiding
making alcohol a tabu.
