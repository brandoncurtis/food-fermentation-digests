Dick;


It's in the nature of our Goverment to Take Action.  Regardless of it's
relation to the cause/event.  It looks awful good in the polls don'tcha
know!  (I'm minded of a recent editorial cartoon...  it shows a poor sod
stripped to his skivvies going thru a CAT scanner, while his luggage is
being torn apart.  To one side is a Congressman saying, 'You can't blame
Flight 800 on mechanical failure!, We just mandated all this cool new
anti-terrorist stuff!'.)


But, back on topic;   I'm planning on making some mulled apple juice for
gifts this christmas, (For my non drinking friends).  How best to preserve
it?  Boil then bottle?  Campden tablets?  Both?

Some time back, I asked what I'd gotten after having fermented 5 gal.
of unfiltered cider bought @ an orchard, amade from an unkown mix of
apple varieties with champagne yeast.  I double-fermented it, pitching
some clarifier between fermentations, primed it VERY slightly & put it
away in Grolsch bottles.  It became beautifully clear and extremely 
alcoholic, almost too "bite-y" to drink.  I was advised to let it sit 
for a year.  A year has passed since bottling.  I cooled one & poured 
it.  Magnificent.  Pale yellow, superb carbonation, faint apple nose, 
very dry & champagne-like.  Gonna do it again, as soon as the 
fermenters are done with the ale & it gets put away in kegs.
