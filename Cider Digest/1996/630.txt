I have recently put most of my attention towards cider brewing, but have
come up with one small problem. I can make a lovely dry champagne type
cider, but can not for the likes of me, make a sweet cider. I have been
using bottled apple cider as a base, and adding sugar in various amounts. I
have tried using ale yeast in hopes that it would stop fermentation early,
and leave some sugar behind. The last batch I made fermented out to 18%! The
yeast strain was suposed to be good to only 8%. I figured that I could stop
the ferment early by dousing it with potassium sorbate or campden tablets,
but then how does one create a sparkling cider (short of bursting CO2
through it)? Finally, I can't quite grasp the idea of being able to sparkle
a cider after it has fermented out. If the cider has reached it's peak
ferment range, how can adding sugar to it at bottling time casue it to start
again? Soooo, anyone with a method for making a nice sweet, sparkling cider,
will get my undevoted praise.
