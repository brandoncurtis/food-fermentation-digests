Derek wrote that he was having trouble getting cider to finish sweet. I
have found that by using Wyeast's sweet mead yeast is one way to achieve
this. Last year I made the below recipe and then carbonated it with CO2,
[40*f@15 lbs]. If you would rather bottle condition I would recommend 1\2
cup corn sugar for 5 gallons to achieve the same results.


14 Gallons fresh cider
1.5 gallons honey


Pasteurize the cider and force chill. Add raw honey. Add yeast doubled to
3/4 of a Gallon. Ferment at 65*f for three months. Secondary for 3 more
months. Artificially carbonate and bottle.


I don't have the gravity reading with me, but after a year it is very
drinkible.

I guess it depends on your definition of "sweet."  Mine tends to come out
with the sweetness of a semi-dry Gewurztraminer, but sometimes it gets
drier than that.


I use ale yeasts, which tend to poop out at 10-12% or so.  I then bottle,
somethines adding a little sugar _solution_ to the cider.  This slightly
lowers the alcohol concentration and adds a tad more sugar, so it comes out
with a light sparkle.


Anyway, I've (so far) never had a bottle grenade.


YMMV. Good luck!

Cezanne and Morgan Miller write in Brewing Techniques July/August 96
about French Cidre making using calcium chlorate at 500ppm to remove the
pectins in a process called defecations.  This apparently limits yeast
growth and results in a sweeter low alcohol cider with a fresher apple
flavor.  


Has any of you tried this process and does it lend itself to kitchen
fermenting techniques?  I assume we need pail type fermentors because a
hard mineral crust forms.


Any experiences or advices are welcome.

RE: Derek Scott's sweet sparkling wine question


This is a tough one. Our winemaker at Sonoma Cyder is experimenting with
different processes. We are fermenting the cider dry, bottling with a
dosage, and pasteurizing after the dosage (primer) is fermented to the
desired sweetness and sparkle. Sounds simple in theory but it requires
control over the variables--temperature (fermenting and pasteurization),
rate of fermentation, consistency in technique, etc.


She recently bottled some samples for some brokers to taste. One sample was
not pasteurized and the other was pasteurized. It was tasted about 10-12
days after bottling. The non-pasteurized had started to ferment again so it
was sparkling and less sweet (as expected). The goal is to know when to
pasteurize to stop the fermentation. This requires monitoring and a large
enough batch of bottles from which to draw samples. The pasteurized version
had no sparkle but retained the sweetness due to the dosage. It had a
flavor close to our target, a French cider made  by Herout et Fils. So we
are getting closer each batch. Right now we are fermenting batches of
locally grown Sonoma apples--Greening, Johnathan, Granny Smith, Pippin,
Black Twig, Baldwin, and Arkansas Black (from two different growers). It is
interesting to compare the difference between the same apple grown by
different farmers. I have no conclusions to offer yet as we are still in
the process.


For those that would like more information on cidermaking, Andrew Lea (one
of the Incider group) has posted his paper, "The Science of Cidermaking",
on the net. It is very comprehensive and up to date. As I looked through my
other articles that I had gathered, I found that I had another one that he
wrote on the production of fresh apple juice for a textbook on juice
production. So we have an apple scholar in our midst. A lot of questions
can be answered by reading his paper. (It is about 50 pages in length.)


That's all  for now!
