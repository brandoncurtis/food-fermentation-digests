Simple request:  Don't spam the digest!  It won't work anyway; it will get
caught before it goes out.  It just annoys me.  Also, I treat an obvious
spam from a subscriber as equivalent to an "unsubscribe" request.


Basically, anything having to do at all with cider is welcome here, and
anything not having to do with cider is not welcome.


Questions/comments on this?  Send me email; I'll respond.

        I prepared a batch of Cranberry-Apple cider this fall, using a
recipe I found on the net.  I ground up 24 ounces of fresh cranberries,
added them to the bottom of the carboy and then added 4 gallons of
fresh-pressed apple juice from a local orchard.  The juice had been
pasturized, but no preservatives added.  I then added a gallon of juice
that I had pressed myself...using about 6 different types of apples.  I
let this juice sit for a week in a plastic 1 gallon container, until the
container was completely "puffed-out", in other words, the juice inside
had started to ferment.  I added a package of Champagne yeast, and let it
go.  After two weeks I racked it, and after two more weeks I bottled it. 
I saved the remaining inch or so of cider/yeast that was left in the
carboy and added it to 5 gallons of pasterized apple juice.  I added 2
cups of white sugar.  
        Okay, the first batch of "FAT RAT CIDER" (the cranberry/apple) is
extremely fizzy...but very sweet.  I am curious though, has anyone had
success using yeast from a previous batch? Is this a bad thing? I have
racked this batch of cier off, and will be bottling it sometime around the
2nd weekend in January...the first taste shows it to have a pronounced
apple aroma, though a very dry finish.  Should I use "fresh" yeast for
each batch?
        Any advice, input would be greatly appreciated.


        Thanks in advance

I just racked my first batch of cider
and tasted it in the process.  I used
a champagne yeast and it turned out
very dry.


Is there anything I can do to sweeten
the taste.  I was considering adding
camden tablets to kill off any other yeasties
and then adding some pasteurized juice
to lighten things a bit.


any suggestions?

On (date) I wrote to the affect of "Help, my cider won't clear".
I attributed it to a too high alcohol content killing the pectin
enzymes (added for clearing).  Upon reflection, I now doubt 
this is the root of my problem.  After all a batch of cyser
(made from the same juice ) cleared and it has a much 
higher alcohol content than cider.


What else, besides pectin, might cause haze in cider ?   And
how (what method, treatment) can I use to remove it ?  I read
a reference on rec.crafts. winemaking to starch haze in apple
wine and beer being cleared with amalase enzyme, but how do
I tell if it's a starch haze in my cider ?  Experiment?  What about 
filtering?  Winemakers seem to do this for their brew.  Anybody
tried filtering their cider ?


Any and all suggestions/advice welcome ! Email me if you're shy
about burning bandwidth.
