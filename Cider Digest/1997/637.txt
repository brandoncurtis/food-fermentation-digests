Dylan says:


"I just racked my first batch of cider
and tasted it in the process.  I used
a champagne yeast and it turned out
very dry.


Is there anything I can do to sweeten
the taste.  I was considering adding
camden tablets to kill off any other yeasties
and then adding some pasteurized juice
to lighten things a bit.


any suggestions?"


OK. I know that my infrequent contributions to this digest make 
me sort of a one-trick pony, but it bears repeating that 
sulfites only stun yeast fermentation. Sorbates only stun 
refermentation, and can produce off-flavors in situations where 
malolactic fermentation haven't occurred. Sorbates used for 
sweetening should only be used in the presence of sulfites. 


I've had my best success with adding a tad of sugar with a 
spoon when I serve the cider. It sounded weird to me at first, 
but has come to make a lot of sense to me. Most of my guests 
seem to prefer a drier cider (to my surprise). I like it a bit 
sweeter to emphasize the apple taste. I never have exploding 
bottles. This idea originally was posted by a fellow in Wales 
whose name, in my ignorance, I can't spell.


I think next year I will use concentrate to beef up the cider 
so that a wine yeast will leave behind a resideual sweetness.


All the best!

I just tried drinking my first batch of cider.  The flavor is good but it 
is so acidic that it is painfull to drink.  What did I do wrong?  Is 
there anyway to save this batch?

I think Bill Rhyme is correct when he suggests that Hornsby's has a apple
wine base . I know of several wineries in Washington State making
commercial cider, and one of the wine makers told me that he makes  an
apple wine from apple concentrate and diluted it with juice or concentrate 
to get the alcohol content and flavor  he wanted. From the wineries point
of view, this is a good way to utilize their equipment  when they do not
need it for wine.

Dick...


I understand that Gallo makes Hornsby from apple juice concentrate. May be
other stuff in there, don't know. They NEVER return my phone calls.
Frankly, I don't like it at all. Scott Bauer's cider tasting was excelent.
Only place I'd truly disagree with his tasters would be Herout. It's a
blend of Normandy cider apples, made by a cidermaker in France. Our tasters
found it outstanding in the summer of 95.


My guess is that he got a sample that was far out of date. We found it  had
an intense apple aroma, but was very dry on the palate with  just a teasing
hint of sweetness. At the time it was the best cider I'd ever found in
America. Since then I've sampled a number of American-made ciders that are
its equal. Wm Brand/What's On Tap .

Can you please help me locate via the net, phone, or letter,  information on
purchasing or building a cider press ??.  I have had only limited success so
far.


Your help is appreciated,  Thank you.     -  Paul

I use potassium sorbate wine stabiliser,  then add a gallon of pastuerised
juice and 1-2 cups of honey to sweeten a 5 gallon batch. This works very well
and avoids the sulphury flavors associated with sulfites.
