The best new presses I've seen come from Correll in Oregon. Not
inexpensive, but very high quality.

Reminder regarding recent slow digest schedule:  The digest only goes out
"when there's enough material".  It's actually a sort of sliding scale: The
less material, the longer 'til it goes out, although even a single short
article won't sit around forever.


So...while there's no need to send something just to break the silence, now
is a good time to speak up if you've been halfway thinking of contributing
or asking something.
