With regard to Mr. Dunn's quest for still, dry, English style ciders
available in the US, the West County Winery has 1 or 2 styles of this type
of cider available. Check Cider Space for a link to their web page with
descriptions of their ciders. They also ship.


Goodale Farms near Ispwich MA also has this type of cider available.  They
are also listed on Cider Space.  I do not have the phone number handy, but
if someone needs it email me.  Goodale's cider registers a whopping 12% a/v.
I do not know if they ship.  Both of these ciders come in a 750ML wine
bottle complete with a cork.  


On another note, it seems that the federal laws concening carbonation levels
in alcoholic beverages versus taxation has something to do with small cider
makers levels of fizziness in their products.  Another good (IMHO) cider is
produced by Nashoba Valley Winery.  This cider has been carbonated.  Very
slightly, however.  These people bottle in 22oz brown glass with a crown
cap. They also ship.  The contact number is 508-779-5521.  They are located
in Bolton MA.  


Hope this helps.

There is a place in Colrain, Massacusetts that sells an 
excellent dry still cider, and several other ciders as well. It 
appears to have won them a few awards. Dick, I'm sorry, but I 
can't for the life of me remember the name. I think its west 
mountain winery. THe town of Colrain is too small to have a 
chamber of commerce you could call, but you should try the town 
offices, since it's a VERY small town and anyone there would 
know about it. The area code down there is (413). I've stopped 
off there a couple of times and can vouch for it. It would 
appeal to purists.


I hope this helps!

Hi all,
        I recently went to visit some folks in Washington (my home) state.
It seems everyone in the area has been infested with apple maggots.
Needless to say, I was disappointed since I had brought 10 one-gallon jugs
to collect some juice.  I got to thinking though on the way home, would it
be so horrible to press apples that had been infected?  I was thinking of
cutting the bad spots and worms out and pressing the remaining apple.
Some of the worms are too small to find.  Any harm in doing this?

The oldest written references to cider making which I have ever seen come
from Pliny the elder (AD 23 - 79) in his 'Natural History'.  Books 12 - 27
contain a smattering of descriptions of winemaking from grapes, and of
cider and perry making from apples and pears respectively.  It is quite
clear that all three beverages are quite distinct in Pliny's mind, so they
must have been well established in the Mediterranean basin 2000 years ago
and presumably for a lot longer than that in practice. It's nearly 25 years
now since I checked these out in the Loeb Parallel Text (Latin/English)
version published by Heinemann (London) but I should think that the
Classics section of any good University library would have them!
