It's "West County Winery". They have a number of excellent products
including a cidre doux from French cider apples (grown on their farm
in the Berkshires).

I was planning on taking a half batch of cider and adding apple juice to
make it sweeter and give it a stronger apple flavor.  What should I add
to stop fermentation?  I read one article that suggests 1/2 campdem
table and 1/2 tsp sorbistat-K (potasium sorbate) to stop fermentation.
I already have those two chemicals, so that is what I am planning on
doing.  Does this sound correct?

Howdy cider people!


I am getting ready to bottle my first batch in wine bottles with #9 corks
because I intend to sit on it for awhile.  It's a real cider.  Is there
anything beyond basic good sterilization of the bottles and such that I
need to worry about?  Do I need to boil or otherwise sterilize the corks?
Much obliged.

Well call me a hair-splitting purist if you like, but there's no way that
can possibly be  cider!   The maximum SG of apple juice in even the best of
years is 1.070, giving a natural alcohol level of 8.5 - 9% as absolute
tops.  (Incidentally the maximum legal level for cider in the UK is 8.5%).
So that 'must' has been fortified with at least 25% added sugar before
fermentation. Do we really want to encourage this sort of thing?  Cider is
inherently a fairly delicate beverage, and to go so high in alcohol is
bound to unbalance it.  What are we drinking the stuff for, to savour and
enjoy it or just to get smashed?  If you want that level of alcohol AND
plenty of gutsy flavour to balance it off, you should be drinking a solid
Cabernet Sauvignon up to 13.5% or a nice flowery Gewurztraminer......or am
I simply a lone traditional voice here swimming against the tide?  After
all the UK industry has done wonders in the last 10 years selling a 25%
original  juice 8.5% alcohol beverage and they've now convinced a whole
generation of punters that THAT'S what cider is!!  (AND they have the gall
to call these products  'premium'  ciders - what a misuse of the English
language!) Will you people across the herring pond be following the same
sad road?
