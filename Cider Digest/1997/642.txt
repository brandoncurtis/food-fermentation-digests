Assuming that these are cork "corks" rather than plastic stoppers you should 


boil the corks for 2 reasons


1) to sanitize
2)  to soften them so they will be easier to insert into the bottles.


Also if you have the same kind of corker that I have (big double handled 
thingie with a steel ramrod that pushes the corks thru a plastic chamber) 
you will want to rinse the corker off after each bottle. If I dont do this I 
tend to get little cork bits in the bottles.


if they are plastic "corks" you might want to rinse them in a plain 
sanitizer (whatever you normally use) instead of boiling them.

I don't dispute Andrew's comments on heavily fortified ciders. I just had
to mention that here in central NY we routinely produce ciders from
late-harvested golden russets with SGs in the mid 1.070s.  These are
flavorful apples and can carry the alcohol quite well (after a year in the
cellar).

Concerning cork preparation for bottling:


I have had good results soaking the corks in hot water with bisulfite added. 
The corks are sterilized and softened making insertion easier.

Concerning the alcohol content of cider:  I agree that 9% is/should be the
natural limit for cider.  I have made cyser with alcohol levels as high as
18%--but I use it for a dessert wine.

One farmhouse cidery which hasn't been mentioned is White Oak in Newburg,
Oregon. They are still pretty small, but the cider is wonderful. I enjoy
West County ciders alot and White Oak is different from them. It is the
Imperial Stout of american ciders, it's big, very big.


White Oak is owned by Alan and Kelsey Foster. Alan is an orchardist and is
raising over 80 varieties of cider apples and perry pears. They will be
releasing bottled product as soon as labeling is approved.


Their Phone # is 503-538-0349
