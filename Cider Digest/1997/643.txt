Here, here! Well said. One of the things that attracts me to cider is
how nature has endowed it with its own natural level of pleasure i.e.
5-6% alcohol. If you leave it alone, it works. To add sugar to make it
"whopping" does just as Andrew says: it creates a medium by which one
gets drunk. Bad business.


Not true for a Gewurz, though. Take a cue from what the juice tells you.
Cider is apple juice after nature has had her way with it. Lets not mess
it up. Any more thann we have to. 


And no, those of us who care on the West side of the herring pond will
do our darndest to make sure that what we end up calling cider is just
that: fermented juice from press apples grown locally. Count me in as
one of the traditionalists!

Excuse me if this was discussed recently, but I just found a series of ciders
from ACE in California.  They had an Fermented Apple Cider, Fermented Honey
Cider (apples and honey), and Fermented Pear Cider (main ingredient being
"cider stock", with no mention of apples or pears).


Any information out there on these products would be helpful.  Are they mainly
a marketing gimmick or is this a good product?  And what is "cider stock"
anyway?


Thank you,
John DeCarlo, jdecarlo@juno.com
