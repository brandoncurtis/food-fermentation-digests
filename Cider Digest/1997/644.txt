I've had the Fermented Pear Cider from ACE and hated it.  I have 
never had a perry (and I guess I can still say that) so I bought the 
pear cider.  It taste exactly like one of those tart Jolly Rancher 
hard candies.  I dumped out the whole bottle.  YUCKKKKKK.  Is there 
and "real" commercial perry out there?

They are a small (well, certainly by the standards of Gallo/Hornsby's...
or Bulmer's) producer of cider -- essentially a micro-cidery.  Based in
the Sonoma County region of California (Sebastopol ?), when they started
they were using locally produced apples.  I have no reason to suspect they
are not still using local fruit -- though I agree that the "cider stock"
listing is a bit suspicious.


I think they produce a pretty good product.  Especially given that the
local apples are probably not the best for making cider from....  I had a
chance to taste the apple on tap last week -- quite a bit better than
the bottled version (quality above what that difference usually provides.)

After hearing everyones wonderful sucesses with cider, I thought I would
be more of a comfort to the silent ones who, like myself, didn't do so
well this year.
You are not alone!


This year I put so much time into building a grinder and a press that I 
rushed through the process of pressing, and took very little care in
cutting out the bad parts of the apples.  The result?  not quite cider,
not quite vineger, but bad (spoiled) enough to make it undrinkable.


How can I complete the vineger process?


What can I do with 5 gallons of of vineger?  There must be a use for it.

Re: Ace Apple Cider, produced by California Cider Company, San Rafael, CA.


It is a rapidly growing cider company in No. California (approx. 250,000
gallons for 1997 target) that was founded by Geoffrey House, a former  US
distributor of Taunton's Dry Blackthorn Cider. According to a recent news
article, Geoffrey started the cidery after he lost the Dry Blackthorn line,
or something like that. It is sold in kegs, 22oz., and soon 12oz. bottles.
My brother read the label off of a keg in his warehouse and the pear cider
listed the ingredients as fermented apple juice with pear flavoring, CO2,
etc. Overall, I think that they are in it for the long haul. Anyone know
anything else?

I posted this question to the Mead Digest, but no replies. I think it
applies to cider as well, so I am posting here in hopes of a response,
enlightened or otherwise...


I recently clarified a mead using Sparkalloid. It remains in the carboy,
having clarified rapidly. This was in part an experiment to see how well
this works. I must say it works quite well. My question, though, is how
long can a mead or cider (or beer for that matter) be left on the sediment
after clarifying without affecting the flavor of the product? And does it
depend on which clarifying agent is used?

This is a bit off topic, but bear with me. The state of alcoholic beverage
regulation is in sad shape in Mississippi, and we need all the support we
can get. Senate Bill 3010, which legalizes brewpubs, emerged from committee
this week. It should hit the floor for a vote soon. Those who support this
bill should contact their Mississippi Senators and Representatives. Feel
free to email me for more information.
