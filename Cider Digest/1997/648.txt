Hey Gang!!!!


        I need advise..... I have finished the secondary fermentation phase
of my cider (2 5-gallon jugs with a cork have been sitting for about 2
monthes now).  I'm ready to bottle.  The big question is:  Am I allowed to
add up to a cup of sugar syrup or some sweetener prior to bottling to
sweeten the batch?  I'm sure the yeast is dead by now.  No activity for
weeks... so no need to worry about explosions I wouldn't think.  Is it okay
to sweeten at this late a stage?????????


                                    BAM

Hello,
        I have a qestion concerning aging mead and cider.  I, in the past,
considered the age of a drink to be time since it was bottled.  Is this
correct?  I ask because I has found wide variation in the time a mead or
cider takes to ferment.  I have had ciders take from 2 weeks to a little
over a month.  Mead usually goes for a month or two, but I just finished
bottling one that took over 7 months.  It seemed to go on vacation
sometime around the 3rd month(still very sweet) and then restarted a
couple months later.  No sign of infection, and its almost dry now.  So
how old is that mead?  I bottled it less than 3 weeks ago, but it was
brewed last spring when the daylight savings time changed.

Andrew's gravity figures for 1912 were absolutely amazing!


Seeing those figures, I was wondering whether there is such a thing as 
a "gravity profile" of juice running off from the pulp. We sometimes 
leave a pressing overnight an get an extra 10% or so of juice out of 
the pulp. I have not measured the Gravity, but does anyone know 
whether this would be significantly weaker/stronger than, say, the 
first 10% run off?


Cheers,
