Ernie Sargent: I second Steve Butts, although I think he may
overestimate the time required. My cider always tastes
thin when I bottle it. I take out a bottle to sample regularly
and I usually begin to notice an improvement within weeks,
not months, and cider 3 months in the bottle is usually getting
pretty good. This year's first batch in the bottle (one of my
husband's) was decidedly unpleasant at bottling, yet five
weeks later was getting rave reviews from a pair of guests, who 
managed to run through a quarter of the 5 gallon batch by downing
seven bottles at our house and cadging another six pack to take
home. I'll be lucky to have any left after six months to see if
Steve is right. 


This past weekend I bottled my first attempt at raspberry cider.
This stuff smelled irresistable when I racked it off the lees
about ten weeks ago, and tasted rough and acidic but very
robust and fruity. Now it's quite disappointing -- thin,
and it has a somewhat "grassy" taste and aroma. But I'll bet
by May the guests at my daughter's First Communion reception
will be clamouring for more.

     I was preparing to bottle my lastest batch of cider when I noticed a 
     thin white layer of something floating on top of the cider.  I've 
     never run across this before.   It covers the entire surface area the 
     cider.  Is it some type of mold?  Can I save the 5 gallons of cider?  
     It appears to taste OK and fermentation stopped about 4 weeks ago.  
     Any suggestions from you knowledgable folks out there?
     
     Mike
