Mike:


I have not encountered this phenomenon with cider, but I have encountered
it with my attempt at a lambic.  I used Wyeast lambic culture ( I forget
the #), and one of the side-effects is a thin, milky white layer of
something at the surface.  Did you do a natural fermentation?  It is
_possible_ that you got a wild yeast strain that mimics this effect.  Of
course, it's also possible that it's mold.  I have been told that a fungal
infection in fermenting liquids has a musty, moldy aroma that's hard to
miss.


My suggestion: if it smells and tastes okay, then bottle it and see what
happens.  If it smells musty or moldy then dump it.

Sounds very much like a Film Yeast (Candida or Pichia) to me - particularly
if it seems a bit 'greasy/flaky/powdery'.  These things grow if there's
access to air, and eventually will oxidise away the alcohol to CO2 (not
stopping at acetic acid) and remove the flavour too.  But if you catch it
early it's OK.  So my advice is to bottle it PDQ, perhaps adding 100 ppm
sulphite to be sure.  If you want to keep it longer in bulk, add the
sulphite, top up to the brim with boiled water and close off TIGHTLY.  As
the French say: "L'air est l'ennemi mortel du cidre".  Film yeasts are one
of the reasons why!

As if I didn't already have enough windmills to tilt...Is anyone out here
sufficiently conversant with perry to provide a gentle introduction to what
pear varieties are used for perry?...and, perhaps, any additional informa-
tion on where to find such pears?  What are the criteria?  It's sad enough
that cider is in such neglect here in the US...at least when you say
"cider" and then qualify with "hard cider" [sigh], people get the idea. 
But perry is really unknown.  If I say perry to my acquaintances, the only
recognition I get is based on the name of an ex-boat-salesman who works
for the printer manufacturer who employs them.  Sigh...
