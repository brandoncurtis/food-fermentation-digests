I'd be patient before dumping (unless carboys are at a premium).  A couple
years ago, one carboy of cider developed a somewhat oily scum and became
noticably cloudy about six months after transfer to the secondary
fermenter.  I'd given it up for lost, but didn't get around to doing
anything with it for another six months.  By then it had fallen bright.  It
tasted remarkably good and had even lost a nasty hydrogen sulfide aroma
which had lingered for quite some time.  One of the best carboys from that
pressing!


The bottom line is that you can't be sure which bugs you're dealing with
based solely on the appearance of the wine.

That would be Acton and Duncan,  "Sweet and Hard Cider."

I think this all begins with elderflower 'champagne' which is a beverage
made over here by steeping elderflower heads for a couple of days in a
sugar / water/ lemon juice mix, straining, and then allowing to ferment in
bottle by the action of the wild yeasts from the elder florets themselves. 
It's light and refereshing - just what you need in May / June when the
elder is flowering!  It doesn't keep more than a couple of weeks. 


The key is that the elder flowers themselves have a pleasant floral terpene
aroma which adds a nice flavour to a light beverage.  Commercially, elder
flower extracts are made by steeping the flower heads in strong acidified
sugar syrup (60 - 70% by weight) for a few days and then keeping the syrup
(which is too strong to ferment) in bulk until used for blending off into
carbonated juices or even into light alcoholic beverages such as cider and
perry (or custom-made carbonated alcoholic bases usually prepared from
imported grape-juice).  There are several commercial products on the UK
market which now contain these extracts, but I don't know who trades in
these extracts, if anybody (I would guess perhaps William Ransom Ltd).  I
know at least one major UK user makes his own. 


You have to be careful though to select a strain of elderflower which is
fragrant rather than 'catty'.  All are collected from the wild, so far as I
know, and are not cultivated (at least in the UK, though elder is
cultivated in other parts of Europe principally for the dark black berries
which are used for food colouring).  This is all from the European elder
(Sambucus nigra) - I've been told that the North American species of elder
(e.g. S. canadensis) are poisonous in flower and fruit but that may just be
an old wives tale!   I think the European elder leaves contain cyanide in
quite high levels and were used by Victorian entomologists to kill
butterflies in the field before taking them home and mounting them!

One place to start is Dr. Graftons "Cider and Perry Page"   at:
        http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/GraftonG/cider/homepage.htm
There is a fairly extensive list of perry pears. Getting these pears may be
more difficult .
A cross reference Grafton's perry varieties with the Fruit, Berry and Nut
Inventory, Second Edition, edited by Kent Whealy and Steve Demuth for US
sources.   Alan Foster, White Oak Cider, Oregon  is making some  perry and
putting in some trees. He does his own nursery work, so must have or know
where to get bud wood for some varieties, maybe Corvallis.

I thought it might be helpful to give you the accession numbers and 
cultivar names of the Perry Pears held at Corvallis.
PI 231806  Normannischen
PI 506378  R 9
PI 541123  Barland
PI 541124  Barnet
PI 541151  Bakeney Red
PI 541156  Butt

PI 541273  Thorn
PI 541287  Yellow Huffcap
PI 541305  Brandy
PI 541317  Red Pear


Barland. A favourite perry pear with a peculiar flavour of its own.


Butt. A medium-sized, conical, gren fruit which makes a strong rough 
perry. Mid-season to late flowering. Hardy and prolific. Fruit ready 
mid-season.


Taynton Squash.  Another good perry-making pear, small, russeted over 
dull yellow with rosey cheek. Hardy and prolific. Flowers early and 
fruit is ready early in September.


Descriptions taken from Fruit Growing  N. B. Bagenal 1946.


There are collections of Perry Pears in Australia in the hands of 
private collectors and I myself have some that I have collected from 
an old Orchard near where I live from Pear trees 150 years old. I 
have yet to identify which varieties they are however I am fairly 
certain one of them is the Red Pear and one day I hope to make my 
first batch of real Perry.


Best wishes
