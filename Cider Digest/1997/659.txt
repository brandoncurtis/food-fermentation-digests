I've eaten elderblossom fritters for years, with no ill-effect, tho'
they can taste kinda odd if you get one of the "catty" plants. I've also
tried both elderflower and elderberry wine, made from wild-growing
plants here in the southern US. Both were nice, esp. considering it was
a first try at fermentable comestibles. ;)
    Incidentally, as far as I know the elder is the only plant from
which you can get both a white and red wine from the same individual
plants. If instead of picking the flowers, you "brush" then off the
umbels (if you try it, you'll know what I'm talking about), then the
berries will go ahead and develop. I've also heard that elderberries are
tastier if they are first dehydrated, and then rehydrated just before
use in hot water.
    As far as elderflower (otherwise known as elder blow) extract, you
might try a natural foods store, or one of those places that sells
natural cosmetics. "Elderflower water" is a useful cosmetic; just make
sure there are no unpleasant chemicals added.


Cheers,
Diana

Steve Daughhetee wrote this in response to a question about white film in
cider and a "large paperback book with a red cover": "That would be Acton
and Duncan,  "'Sweet and Hard Cider.'"  I am not familiar with this book by
these authors, but I am familiar with "Sweet and Hard Cider" by E.A.Proulx
and L. Nichols, a wonderful and informative book which answers the same
description.

In reply to my questions about elderflower extract, Andrew Lea wrote:


" This is all from the European elder
(Sambucus nigra) - I've been told that the North American species of elder
(e.g. S. canadensis) are poisonous in flower and fruit but that may just be
an old wives tale! "


For what it's worth:


I don't have this on any good authority, so don't quote me (or start eating
wild elderberries) but I believe the old wive's tale stems from confusion
with the pokeweed plant, which vaugely resembles elderberry and contains
toxic constituents.  There are, however, several species of Sambucus that
are found in N. America, all of which, to my knowledge are called
elderberry. There may be one or more that are poisonous.


Locally, elderberries are reputed to make an excellent [dessert] wine.  I
know a fruit grower who has a small patch of cultivated elderberries and
most of his customers are old wives who used to be able to find lots of
elderberries (wild?) when they were younger but no longer can.


Thanks for the info on elderflower extract, Andrew.
