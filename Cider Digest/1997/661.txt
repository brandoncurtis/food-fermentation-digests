If anyone plans to holiday on Vancouver Island this Summer - a nice 
place to visit -  there is a chance to visit a ciderworks and taste cider 
made with traditional English and French cider apples at Merridale Cider. 
I believe their tasting and sales room is open every day. They are 
signposted on the main highway north of Victoria. Their product is only 
available locally.

I'm a little bit concerned about the low volume on the digest right now.
We don't need so much material that people have trouble keeping up with it,
but we're down around the rate of one submission per week.  (Yes, I know
this is a quiet time of year for cider.)  The traffic is low enough that I
have to push out single-article digests just to prevent people from sending
me notes asking whether the digest is still alive, etc.  I don't know...
maybe the folks who are interested in cider at this time of the year are
busy in the orchards.


I would appreciate any comments you've got on the present state of the
digest.  Send them to cider-request@talisman.com and I'll consider/summarize
unless you specifically intend that they be published in the digest.  I
would like to hear some choice among opinions like "leave well enough
alone", "provoke some discussion about <x>", "start posting material from
source <y> as in-fill", etc.
