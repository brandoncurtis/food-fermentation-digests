There are two parts to the responses to my questions in the last digest
about the low traffic:
  * Almost all of the responses I got directly to me said "Leave well
    enough alone."  That's cool...I've had lots of practice at doing
    nothing, so I'm good at it, and that's what I'll do.
  * A handful of people were encouraged by the mention of low traffic to
    post some questions they'd been pondering.  And those, of course,
    will elicit a bunch of responses...so we'll probably see the digest
    get busy for a little while.
Thanks for the input.

Mr. Dunn,


        My name is Dave Chamowitz and I am a burgeoning cider brewer.
Actually, I have yet to brew my first batch.  Anyway, my experience with
Cider Digest has been a very educational one.  I have saved every Digest,
and when I start brewing in the fall, I have every intention of referring
back to my archives to get at all of the advice that has been put forth.  I
think the Digest is in great shape, even if the issues have been coming
somewhat thinner of late.  Thank you, Mr. Dunn, and everyone who has
contributed their knowledge to this forum, for helping amateurs like me get
their feet wet.

Does anyone know of northern USA sources of traditional English cider
trees? I know of a source in Sonoma, CA, but doubt they will be much
concerned over  Minnesota cold-hardiness requirements.

Colleagues:


I visited Merridale cidery just last month.  They have made some compromises 
for the commercial market (some filtration and added sugar, I believe), but
it's the best commercial cider I've had in North America:  beats the heck out
of Woodchuck et al.  They have a "traditional" Scrumpy made with a large pro- 
portion of crabapples which is worth a try.


You would be well advised to call ahead:  when I was there they were open but
the shop was manned by a young kid who didn't seem to know much and in fact
seemed somewhat threatened by my eager questions about Ph levels, apple 
maceration and so on.  I bet the owner would be more forthcoming, but I didn't 
get to meet him.


They supposedly have distribution throughout British Columbia, but I could not
find the product in a large Vancouver provincial liquor store.  Good luck!

        First, I don't mind low volume on the digest.  Second, I've been
meaning to ask this during a lull for some time.


        I don't have a degree in botany, so I have only guesses as to what
scion wood is or how grafting works.  My guess is that scion wood is
some particular part of the tree from above the ground and that it is
attached to the root system of a strong variety by some method more
sofisticated that Elmer's glue and tape.


        I understand that the goal is to get the fruit quality and/or
quantity of the scion's variety while getting the health and hardiness of
the root stock.  Beyond that I don't know.


        So, are there more reasons to be grafting?  What is scion wood?
Can I make my own (if I had more interesting varieties of apples)?  How
do you do the graft?  Should I have used the word "cultivar" instead of
"variety" :)

Dick was concerned over the very quiet digest, so I thought I would post
a question.


When a local homebrew shop went out of business, I became the owner of a
can of cider concentrate. It's similar in size to a can of malt extract,
and has a green on white label. I believe it's called something like
"Normandy Cider Concentrate" and the contents are supposedly from
France. (I don't have it with me so this is from memory.)


I was thinking about making a cyser with it (that is, an apple mead).
Does anyone have any experience with this product?

I'm a newcomer to the cider digest and have been lurking in the shadows, but
I do appreciate the low volume.  Granted, one submission a week is a bit
thin, but I like knowing that I'm connected to the wisdom of others without
being overrun by dozens of daily postings.  I also subscribe to the homebrew
digest, and although full of useful info, its a bit much.  The cider (and
mead) digest is a nice change from the HBD.  Like most of you, I don't have
time to read hours of E-mail!


If it helps stir up some discussion, I'd like to know what blends of apples
(or juice, cider) people have had success with.  I've understand that three
seems to be the magic number, the relative quantities of each depending on
the type, acid/sugar content, etc.  Calgary isn't exactly in the apple belt,
so selection is limited to what the grocery stores are stocking.  The 6 foot
ornamental tree in my backyard produced 400 medium size green fruit last
year, but they are TART!  Probably not the best choice. 


Thanks
Rob.

     Just in the interest of creating some bandwidth on this list, I'll ask 
     a question.
     
     I recently brewed a concoction made from 1 gallon of store bought 
     apple juice (100% juice no preservatives), 1 12 oz can of frozen grape 
     juice concentrate, and 8 oz of maple syrup. I fermented it with 
     champagne yeast in the 1 gallon glass jug that came with the apple 
     juice. It turned out  nicely (smooth), except for a brownish-red 
     color. I took it a meeting of our local brew club, who are mostly beer 
     brewers, and they loved it.
     
     I guess my question would be, what would you call this concoction. I 
     shudder to call it a "cider" in the real sense, because I didn't press 
     my own apples and added other ingredients. I don't know if you could 
     call it a cyser, because I used maple syrup instead of honey.
     
     Just curious if there was a technical term for this, or for any apple 
     based products combined with other ingredients. I know mead makers 
     have a long list for different varieties of mead.

I am interested in Cider Digest subscribers' success with cider recipes.
I am sure we all have access to the same books, but which recipes have
you tried that work well, and "glorify the apple"? 


We are hosting a cider tasting and cider food tasting at Butch's Dry
Dock in Holland, Michigan soon and we are looking for a few good
suggestions. We, of course, love crepes, and will be creating some of
our own, but what else (especially finger-food and snacks) goes well
with cider?


You local folks, send me an e-mail and I will let you know the specific
date!

     I hope everyone is busy with their cider!  I am curious if 
any one knows the history of Tennessee/Western North Carolina
concerning production of  Hard Apple Cider.  I know that one area
of East Tennessee, "Shady Valley", had several large scale orchads 
that had large scale production in the 40's and 50's.  Does anyone 
know about this area and its history?

Hello again CD ers...
Just went back to my old home of Burlington, VT last weekend to pick up some
more of my stuff (I've moved to an orchard in Central Mass) and was greeted
by a pleasant surprise:
Back in January I cleaned a bunch of fruit out of the conventional cold
storage wjere I used to work and pressed them...Why let them just rot???
Sugars were very low (SG ~ 1.03) as were acids (pH ~4), but twenty gallons
were extracted and bottled up anyway.  Added campden, champagne yeast, and a
bunch of honey, and never bothered to check the sg afterwards.  Time went
on, two batches (ten gallons) went bad, some kind of mold took over.  This
was not a surprise because the cooler was full of rotting fruit (it's a
research orchard, not commercial).  15 gallons of the juice was entirely
from Liberty apples which produced an excellent cider for me last fall.  The
rest came from a mishmash of what hadn't yet rotted...I call it my "mongrel"
blend


Anyway, I went in and checked on it last weekend and low and behold the
batches were done, and Saturday I bottled up five gallons each of Liberty
and Mongrel...and they are great!  Very high alcohol content due to poorly
measured sugar spiking ( and helpful considering the inoculum level of
creepy crawlies I started with), but very satisfactory flavor, although a
little light on tannins......Here's to a batch turned good!!!


One final note:
I am i the middle of planning my own cider orchard in central Vermont.
Varieties (for now) are Liberty, Wealthy, Red Astrakan, and Ribston Pippin,
all on semi-dwarfing M7 rootstocks.  Anyone out there have experience
growing cider fruit on dwarfing stocks??? I would like my next trees even
smaller, i.e. m9 or M26

Hi All


I've just bottled my latest batch of cider and have a litre or two
that I couldn't find bottles for. I am planning to turn this excess
into Applejack by partly freezing and removing the ice untill it
doesn't freeze any more. I have tried once, but I seemed to be taking
out as much alcohol in the ice as i was leaving behind. Has anyone out
there done this? Could you give me some pointers on technique? Do I
need more cider to start with (the original is only about 4%).


Many Thanks In Advance
