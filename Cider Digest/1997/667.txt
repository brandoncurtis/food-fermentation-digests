Subject: Commercial Ciders
From: Derek Bisset <derek_bisset@bc.sympatico.ca>

The economics of commercial ciders mean that the raw materials, apples or 
juice, have to be available for a very low cost. Cider sold here to the 
pub trade has to be available at a competitive cost with other drinks and 
with no variation. 
(I have heard the criticism made of a local producer " his quality is 
variable"although the critic accepted that in winemaking variability  is 
a virtue)
Regular supply and low cost raw materials mean that concentrate is more 
viable than fresh apples. It can be bought cheaply , stored and made up 
when required.
Drinkers also become accustomed to a bland product over time. 


In all this quality and individuality of product come very low on the 
list of priorities for the market.The commercial cider maker is driven by 
the market even if he wants to make a "good" cider.
I have heard an English cider maker, Dick Sheppey of Taunton, say "I 
can't sell cider like my grandfather made".
French cider makers in Normandy say they need to up their return from 9F 
per bottle to 16F to make production worthwhile.
But in the last few years I have seen consumers change preferences from 
factory made Baby Duck sparkling wine to small growers vineyard produced 
Riesling. An apple show in Vancouver every year attracts thousand who are 
rejecting Delicious in the stores. In- pub brewing is on the increase and 
so on... all suggesting a sea change from buying low cost standardized 
brands to an interest in variety, and hopefully, quality.
Quality will cost but we appear ready to pay for it in other things; we 
only have got out of the way of paying for it in food.
The Normandy producers I think have a good approach, associating their 
ciders with champagne and the image of quality. Julian Temperley in 
England is doing a similar thing getting reviews in the Times for his 
cider. Our local producer says that he, unwillingly, must produce a 
diluted bland product for the pub trade after years of trying to sell 
cider made with a fair proportion fo cider apples if he is to stay in 
business. Using only cheap reject market fruit for that purpose will 
allow him to use his cider apples for a separate quality line of 
champagne cider which he will have to sell at a price more associated 
with wine than with commercial cider.
      None of this confusion about the commercial product will I hope 
stop small producers from planting cider apples and making good cider for 
themselves. It's just that they won't be very likely to make a living 
doing it.

I am writing in regards to Richard Anderosn's posting on the Cider Tax
reduction. I was at the meeting in Seattle where this tax proposal was
introduced (as was Richard). I latter came to my attention that the present
bill would eliminate the tax exempt status of many small cidermakers. Many
of us at the IBS conference on cider probably wouldn't have supported this
bill if we had known. While in many ways this bill is a good one, I can't
support it until the cider exemption for small producers is reintroduced.

If any of you have happened to visit the FTP site wherein the diegst
archives may be found, no doubt you've noticed that there are over 600
of them, each in zipped format, which must then be unzipped to be most
useful. If you are wanting to look for specific information, it can be a
real hassle. (Not that I'm complaining...I know that archiving all these
digests probably has to be done that way.) But I went ahead and
downloaded and unzipped 'em all, and pasted them together so that an
entire year's worth of digests are in one document. Makes finding info
*much* easier, so I thought other folks might be interested in having
them, without all the work. If so, feel free to e-mail me, and specify
if you want them as text or zipped up.
   (I wrote Jay asking if this procedure is a problem. I didn't hear
back, so I'm assuming it's not. Mea culpa if I'm violating one of those
unwritten internet codes. <g>)

No.  My reference to "delicate" for the full-dwarf really should have been
something more like "brittle", I suppose.  They pretty much have to be
staked anywhere, and in an area like ours susceptible to high winds they
just don't seem like a good idea even with staking.


I can't decode, from the (limited) info I've found, any particular corre-
lation between degree-of-dwarfing and fireblight-resistance.  It's more
that each rootstock has a different degree of fireblight resistance.


I'll defer to someone with more knowledge to provide more info on
fireblight.

Dick, from what you wrote it seems that the larger growing the rootstock
the more resistant the tree. Is that the case? How does fireblight work,
and is resistance in the rootstock the key to having a crop of apples?


I assume there has been a considerable amount of research done in this
area.

David (&cider digest),
Good to hear from you, even if it was just to put me to work.  To the best
of my knowledge, the bulletin you mentioned is still available fron Geneva.
The Geneva Station's publications are ordered through:


       Beverly Dunham
       Communications Services Bulletins
       New York State Agricultural Experiment Station
       Geneva, NY 14456
       Tel: 315-787-2249 / Fax: 315-787-2276 / e-mail: bbd1@cornell.edu.


Ask for G817. Propagating fruit trees in New York. Way, Dennis, Gilmer,
1967 (1.00)


Look for more ordering info and other publications  by visiting the Geneva
Eperiment Station home page at:


http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/


then Press Releases and Publications, then Research Publications and Order
Information.


This site also offers info that may be of interest to people on this digest
such as these from Food Science and Technology:


SpR 32  Hard cider workshop. Downing, ed., 1979 (1.00)
SpR 8 Homemade fruit juice press. Downing, 1972 (.50)
Misc Production methods in champagne, sparkling wine symposium. Hardy, Pool,
       Henick-Kling, 1989 (5.00)


or Entomology and Plant Pathology publications (e.g. disease resistant
rootstocks/cultivars)


Other bulletins that may be of interest from the Cornell Cooperative
Extension "Catalog of Publications and Audiovisuals":
"The Home Fruit Planting" (1989)(homeowners)  and "Training and Pruning
Apple Trees" (1992) (intended for commercial growers but probably of some
use to serious backyard orchardists).  I would suggest that people who are
interested in adding to their libraries write for the catalog because it
includes price and ordering information, and other bulletins, etc. of
interest.  Request this catalog by contacting:

A quick response to Brian, who asked about pressing:


If there is farmstand sweet cider for sale each fall in your area, someone
around there must be pressing it.  Here is southern Wisconsin it's a cottage
industry:  there are many small orchards that press their own using relatively
small-scale equipment and there are some backyard, parttime entrepreneurs who
have built their own hydraulic system and press for small and medium sized
farmers who don't want to fool with it themselves.


I bet the same is true in MI.  The guy I use here does 50-gallon runs, but was
quite happy to run my 20-25 gallons of custom apples for just a few bucks more
than his standard price.  I suggest you ask the smaller growers in your area
whom they use.  If they press themselves, they may well do a small run for you
if you buy at least some of their apples.  I have not yet invested in any
pressing equipment and don't plan to:  my presser is clean, state-inspected and
gets nearly 3 gallons per bushel, much more than a manual press can achieve.
And best of all, I can give him any blend of apples I choose.  All-in-all, buy- 
ing the varieties you want and paying to have them pressed seems to be an 
excellent compromise between using the often-bland juice made from the apples 
the farmer didn't sell and doing the not inconsiderable effort involved in
grinding, pressing, cleaning with your own operation.  Works for me.
