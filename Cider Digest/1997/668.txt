After the sterling recommendation for Woodchuck Granny Smith, I rushed
out to get a 6pak to confirm the opinion.  Well, it tasted much like
Granny Smith apples and when offered to my neighbors along with
Woodchuck Dark and Dry, the GS was preferred.  I won't put it up as my
favorite commercial cider but it was better than many of the sugared,
caramelized competition.

Diana writes and asks about the Cider Digest Archives. I wonder if
they could be set up like the Mead, Homebrew Digest, and JudgeNet
archive sites, particularly with the neato-keen search engine 


   http://hubris.engin.umich.edu:8080/cgi-bin/dothread


that's on Spencer Thomas's beer page:


   http://realbeer.com/spencer/


That would be ideal. While we're at it, how about adding the lambic
digest and the MALTS-L list, too?


I know this would be a lot of work, and I certainly don't expect it
to happen tomorrow, but it might be a good idea to keep this in 
mind for the future...

Timothy Smith at Washington State University has a developed a Fire Blight
Risk Estimation Model based on several criteria.    You can get this

As Richard and Terrence have pointed out, the cost of apples in making a
quality cider is going to be higher than using concentrate.  Another big
factor driving up the cost of using fresh-pressed apples is the limited
season.  Even a well stored apple starts losing its fruitiness and its
pH starts going up while in storage.  We have found that we can't press
much later than. February and still come up with a quality cider.  That
means all our cider for the year has to be made in a five month period. 
We need twice as much capacity and carry nearly twice as much inventory
as a same-sized maker using concentrate.


I think that for quality cider to make it, there is going to have to be
a seperate market segment from six-pack draft ciders, with a seperate
package.  While cider is like beer in its alcohol level and benefits
like beer from carbonation, it's  like wine in that it's made from fruit
with all of the complexity and variability that fruit brings. Cider is a
seperate beverage from the two and stands on its own.  Does anybody have
any ideas on a package that reflects that?
