Subject: Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Benzote

I was wondering if anyone can answer the follwoing questions regarding potassium
sorbate and sodium benzoate.  


1)  Which of the two is better for preventing fermentation after sweetner or
concentrate has been added back to the cider? 


2)  How much do you add per 5 gallon batch (volume and weight)?  I have
potassium sorbate in granular form and sodium benzoate in 0.25 gram tablets.


3)  Is there any maximum exposure concentrations and  long term health effects
associated with the two compounds?


4)  Will either of the compounds have an effect on taste.


I appreciate any and all answers.

The trick is in finding the right package that is familiar enough to be
comfortable to folks who might try something new, but different enough
from beer and wine that it creates its own distinction as cider. I doubt
it exists - if its too clever you end up looking like Zima or something
you would pick up at Stuckey's - if its too familiar you risk getting
lost in the shuffle if you are relying only on the package.


Our strategy is to first get people thinking about cider by approaching
them on the most familiar grounds possible, both in the package and more
importantly, in the selling. Yes, maybe our Goldfinch Cider is not
"true" cider by some cidermakers' definition, but it creates an
opportunity to teach about the apples, the styles, etc. Once the
"beachhead" is established, then the more exciting and elaborate aspects
of cidermaking can be brought to market to an already-interested group.
And here is where the package isn't the issue so much anymore. Once
people know and understand cider, they will be able to approach it as
cider, regardless of the package, and you'll be able to use a package
that suits the cider and your practical bottling needs. You are no
longer stuck trying to do both things at once: creating a market while
not confusing people with a package that implies that it "is like wine"
or "is like beer". I still have friends who call Goldfinch "ale" or
"cider beer" but it doesn't bother me. I think it makes the challenge
more exciting! Just think, we're restoring an entire drink to its
rightfull place in America, so it takes time. We have decided to start
with Goldfinch, meet people where their palate is now, teach them as
much as possible, and introduce more ciders as we can, and as they're
ready.


I am interested in your thoughts.
