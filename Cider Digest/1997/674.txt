Hi
I am looking at making scrumpy and would like any help that people can
offer, I have found a receipe at Cats Meow, but this involves raw meat.
Would this be correct?
Has anyone made some, how did it turn out?
Thanks all
Faulkner

Subject: Re: cider apple trees


Eddie asked about planting a cider orchard in the deep south.  Here are
a few nurseries that specialize in Southern apples (this list courtesy
of "Old Southern Apples" by ? Calhoun -- a terrific book.)


Classical Fruits (Hoyt Adair, Alabama) 205-974-8813
Calhoun's Nursery (Book author, North Carolina) 919-542-4480
Lawson's Nursery (2730 Yellow Creek Road, Ball Ground, GA, 30107)
Neighbors Nursery (Alabama, does not ship) 205-546-7441


For other information on cider orchards, I refer Eddie to my old standby
"Sweet and Hard Cider" by Proulx and Nichols.


On another topic, I would like to put my two cents worth on the
relevance of orchard and growing topics to a cider discussion group.
Cider making is far closer in spirit (sorry for the pun) and technique
to wine making than it is to brewing.  As anyone familiar with wine
making knows, the type and quality of the fruit is the principal
determinant of character and quality in the final product.  Rather than
apple growing being a "sideline" to cider making, growing apples is at
the heart of the process.  The only real question is whether it makes
sense to grow cider apples yourself.  If you're lucky enough to have
access to suitable apples from elsewhere, there is a strong argument in
favor of letting someone else deal with fire blight, irrigation, birds,
etc.
