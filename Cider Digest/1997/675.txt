Deciding to test my favorite web search engine, I found a really 
cool site on the internet.  Cat's Meow.  It includes a whole list 
(apparently 26 cider recipes in all (and scores of other beverages 
(including cysers, meads, and lots of beers, too)) of recipes for 
cider, including one recipe for Scrumpy (which I had previously 
never heard of, and so I'm no help except for this reference).  
The recipe they give does include raw meat.


Link to the recipe is:  http://realbeer.com/brewery/cm3/recs/11_13.html


And a link to the whole database is:


http://realbeer.com/brewery/cm3/recs/00contents.html


I hope this helps.


In Christ,
michael

This would have a shred of truth in it (which can be said of the worst
among us as well) but it's mostly folklore.


The alleged source of the "raw meat in cider" idea was the supposed prac-
tice of tossing a piece of meat into <xyzzy-fermentation> when it stuck
(stopped fermenting before it was done).  The not-entirely-implausible
underpinning of this practice was that if the fermentation stuck due to a
lack of nutrient, the protein in the meat would contribute enough to get it
started again.  I would like to think there are better ways, even if they
involve rather synthetic-appearing urea-based additives and such.  After
all, what is urea but...oh, never mind...


Other than that, "scrumpy" is a pretty vague term for a sort of cider.  It
might be pretty rough (not delicately filtered and aged), and it might be
fairly strong (strength boosted with other sugars), and served young, and
possibly somebody's trademark here and there.
