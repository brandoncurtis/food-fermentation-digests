Hi,
    I have made several ciders now and I
have been following recipes and
embellishing a little here and there.  I
wanted to try a clone and was wondering
if anyone out there might know of one
for Woodchuck cider?  I would greatly
appreciate it if someone could submit
one to the digest.


Thanks,


Chris Usrey
