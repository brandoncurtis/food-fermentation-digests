Ron,


What temperature was it when you noticed it kicking off again. I'm no 
expert, having only recently gotten seriously into cider making, but it 
sounds awfully like malo-lactic fermentation taking place, which is good. 
It is usually described as another stage in the complete cider fermentation 
process which occurs in the spring (ie after it warms up a bit - I think it 
is around the 16 deg celsius mark that it kicks off) following the autumn 
of the first fermentation. The second phase converts malic acid into lactic 
acid, and the cider is smoother as a result.

   If we're serious about cider, we're going to have to deal with the 
   trendy aspect; we'll see the cider-equivalent of "wine coolers" 
   (actually, in one American brand we already have).  With luck, we might 
   find a way to turn it to our advantage in promoting real cider.




Dick,


Following on from some discussion recently on Cider Digest about cider economics
and marketting, it seems to me that the only way 'real cider' is ever going to 
gain ground is by grabbing a niche somewhat similar to 'boutique beers'. 
Certainly if people with the knowledge such as cider makers on this list don't 
sieze any opportunities for getting into the debate then the industrial brewers 
will certainly treat ciders as kiddie drinks and fruit tingles (an Australian 
fizzy sweet, oops, candy). There is no necessary reason why a trend can't be 
positive for a change. Boutique beers a a good example, despite the name. Until 
about a decade ago almost 100% of beers in Australia were indistinguishable 
bat's piss. Over the decade the big breweries had gradually bought out all 
smaller breweries and then got rid of any variation. New smaller breweries 
started to set up some very different products that cost a little more, and now 
most pubs in Australia realise that they have to offer a wider choice. Of course
the economics of cider apples still has to be addressed.

Dear Folx,


Info on Paul (sp.?) Correnty?? Met a person from the Boston area recently
who's got 300-year old (!!) apple trees, and wants to do something with
them. Please e-mail to me directly at prh4@cornell.edu. Thanks.

This sounds awfully much like a classic malo-lactic fermentation to me.


What happens here is that specialised bacteria (Lactobacilli or
Leuconostoc) get to work on the malic acid in the cider and convert it to
lactic acid, thereby making the cider smoother and losing CO2 in the
process.  This typically occurs in spring as the temperature rises, just as
Ron describes.  It used to be believed that the cider and the blossoming
trees were somehow in sympathy and working together!  Today, sadly, we're a
bit more prosaic!


This is usually beneficial unless the ciders are very low in acid to start
with.  The gravity will not now change since the yeast fermentation is long
finished and it's acid, not sugar, that's being metabolised.  You can
probably bottle the ciders in this state and they'll be naturally sparkling
without so much danger of explosion!

(Wine makers of course often inoculate deliberately with special cultures
to encourage the malo-lactic fermentation)
