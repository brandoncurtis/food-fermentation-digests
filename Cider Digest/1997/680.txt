If you're submitting an article to the digest, please try to arrange that
it be in plain ASCII, not in some quoted form.  In particular, avoid
"quoted-printable" if at all possible.  Since the digest itself is in plain
ASCII, anything that arrives in another format must either be repaired here
or sent back to you for editing.  I realize that some of you (such as
Compu$erve users) are at the mercy of the poor software your ISP provides
for mail, so I've begun trying to repair quoted-printable articles here if
they're not too much of a mess.  But it's time I'd rather not spend.


(Also, be sure the text is limited to 80 columns.)


thanks,

Hello all,


My husband and I are preparing for our second year of cider
production. Last fall, we waited too long to locate good apple
sources, and were forced to fall back on the product of a local
orchard which produces for the fresh sweet cider market (a mix
of Golden Delicious, Winesap, and Stayman). This mix produced
a perfectly drinkable cider but this year we'd like to try to
locate some traditional cider apples if we could. We live in
central Indiana, and would be willing to drive up to four or five
hours away. This would get us as far north as about Lansing Michigan.
Does anyone on the list know of any likely sources we could
investigate? We do not have a cider press yet, so we would need
to buy from someplace that could press for us.


Also, we planted some cider apple trees this past spring 
(Trembletts Bitter, Ashmead Kernel and Kingston
Black) and will probably have extra scion wood when it comes 
time to prune. If anyone is interested in trading, let me know.
