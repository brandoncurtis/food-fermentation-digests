You would think by now there would be some reference books on cider 
making with all the interest there appears to be in the topic.
When I go to my local brew supply store, there is a full shelf on 
beermaking; all references within the last ten years or so and one book 
on cider: Proulx and Nichols "Sweet and Hard Cider" published in 1980 by 
Garden Way. 
There are yeasts available in the store for beermaking by the dozen and 
none for cider. Wyeast, Oregon liquid yeast supplier, has recommendations 
out for winemaking and beermaking but nothing for cider.
The local beer competition had cider stuck in with fruit wines this year.
No one appears to be producing apples for cider makers.
Any ideas on getting cider makers heard and their needs met as well as 
brewers have done?
