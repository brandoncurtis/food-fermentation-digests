Subject: A taste for Woodpecker
From: "John R. Bowen" <jbowen@primary.net>

Andrew Lea, I'm sure you were directing your remark at Woodpecker, but 
please don't chide participants like Kevin Rooney who want to make a 
cider like Woodpecker.  Many of us have only been exposed to a few 
commercial ciders and none of your undoubtably great ciders.  What we 
are saying is really: "How can I make a cider at least as good as 
Woodpecker, because it is better than anything I have had before.  If 
I can make one that good, then this is worth the effort.  Its a good 
standard for a novice like me, and if I can learn to make and 
appreciate something much better, then I will".


I remember learning to drink wine (after leaving a teetotaling 
household).  I started with the sweeter rotgut because my palate (and 
my wallet) couldn't appreciate anything better.  But it was a start 
and I quickly grew.


No, I don't know the recipe for Woodpecker, but what can I make that 
will please me a much as that, or more?  ( A rhetorical question; 
please don't send recipies).

I am also a homebrewer, who was not happy with his cider results - until some 
folks on this list told me to leave the stuff down in the basement for at 
least a year.  I did.  The result was worth waiting for.  What was rough and 
alcoholic became champagne-like, dry, clear straw-colored, excellent 
tiny bubbles.  I was told that champagne yeast (which is what I used) just 
takes longer to work its magic, and they were right.

Greetings,


Has anyone experience using oak chips or oak sawdust in place of aging in
oak barrels (for those of us still working with 5 gal. carboy size lots)?
i.e. types of material (Oak-mor ?), duration of exposure, amounts, etc.

Actually, I'd kind of like to hear the ingredients in woodpecker if you put
it that way....care to share?

Subject: Second batch
From: bruce dykes <bdykes@intac.com>

Okay, I'm going to be starting my second batch of cider in about a week.
My first batch produced a remarkably low grade carbonated vinegar.


My plan for the second batch is to go to my local apple orchard/farmer's
market, and buy four gallons of their freshly pressed and unprocessed
juice in standard US 1 gallon glass jugs.


I'm thinking your standard carboy airlock should fit the jug mouth,
meaning all I have to for my basic cider is pour off some cider to make
some headroom, add my yeast of choice, and let them do their thing.


My next questions concern going on from there. First, should I use a
secondary fermentation? If I want to make it sparkling cider, is it as
simple as adding priming sugar, how much, and what works best? If I
wanted to flavor the cider with spices (cinnamon and allspice being the
obvious choices), when and how would be the best way to impart the
flavor, steeping in cider before the primary, or reserve some to add to
the secondary? How well do sweetening adjuncts such as honey, maple
syrup, or malt extracts play in the cider making process? Am I just
overly complicating everything before I've even brewed a successful
batch?

In Digest #684, Henry Ciderman asked about the development of a cider
vocabulary.  Anyone seriously interested in vocabulary development in
fermented beverages should get to know about the 'Beer Flavour Wheel' which
was developed here in England at the Brewing Research Foundation in the
1960's, and later converted into the 'Wine Flavour Wheel' by Ann Noble at
the Enology Department at UC Davis (see
http://wineserver.ucdavis.edu/VEN7.HTML).  See the following sites for more
info about the Beer wheel
 http://realbeer.com/brewery/library/FlavW.html
http://byo.com/Back/wheel.html
(although despite what they tell you about its history it really WAS
invented here in the UK!!)


The basic concept is that dozens of carefully evaluated terms are ranked
around three concentric 'hubs' and aligned as if in the spokes of a wheel


The inner hub contains primary terms e.g. fruity, vegetative, nutty, woody,
floral, spicy etc.  The middle hub contains sub-terms for each of these
e.g. sub-terms for fruity might include citrus, berry, dried fruit etc..


The outer wheel contains the individual sub-terms e.g. dried fruit breaks
down into strawberry jam, raisin, prune, fig.  Any wine can then be scored
by relating its flavour intensity for each spoke of the wheel (there are
about one hundred spokes on the wine wheel)  You can download the wine
wheel from Ann Noble's web site (see above) tho it's an Adobe File so
you'll need an Adobe Reader to view it.  =




There IS also a corresponding cider wheel, which was developed a few years
ago by the National Association of Cider Makers Analytical Committee, of
which I'm a member.  When I get a moment, I'll try to re-type all the terms
in tabular form (a straightened-out wheel!) and put them on a web page.
I'll give you the address through the Digest when I've done it. For the
moment, though,  anyone who's seriously interested in formal tasting
vocabulary should check out the wine and beer wheels!

Subject: Help! Can't get sweet!
From: "Jonny Miner" <woofhead@classic.msn.com>

I've tried two batches of cider and both have come out with almost no 
sweetness. The first had an OG=1.070. It came out tasing STRONGLY alcoholic. I 
reduced the OG on the second to 1.056 and got pretty much the same result; 
almost no sweetness and an overpowering alcohol flavor. I'm using Wyeast Irish 
ale yeast and storebought juice. Is there a recommended unfermentable form of 
sugar I can add for sweetness? If so how much? Is my gravity still just too 
high?


Thanks for the help,

Dear Cider Digest,


        Does anyone know of a source of good ale yeasts in the
Charlottesville, VA area?  I hope I can get apples at this stage of the
game, but I have been thwarted by an inability to find the yeast I need.
Thanks for your help...
