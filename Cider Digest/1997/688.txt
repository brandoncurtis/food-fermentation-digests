Dick Dunn raises some interesting points in his caveat on Ian Merwin's
proposed Cider Makers Association.  Some of these issues might be
addressed by narrowly defining what cider is, rather than who's making
it.  As far-fetched and romantic as it might seem, I don't feel that we
should exclude even large conglomerates that are genuinely interested in
promoting "real" cider.  It's just that that there aren't any
currently.  If we can create an organization that truly exists to
promote "real" cider, then I personally don't care where the money comes
from, as long as the goals of the association aren't compromised.  By
the way, I feel that a professional association is a good idea, although
it will require a great deal of donated work on all our parts.

Just a brief note of explanation on a comment I made in the last digest...

Let me clarify that I meant the reason you don't want these folks is *not*
because they have lots of money, but because they're not making real cider.
(If somebody made a bundle of money selling real cider in the US, I think
we'd all be happy to see it happen.)

I've not taken the course, but I have a high opinion of Peter Mitchell and
I visited the college only last week - they have a new regional development
grant to become a centre of excellence for the UK cider industry and altho
small at present, things are really taking off there!  I've never heard
anything critical about what he offers and I've heard some very
enthusiastic reports.  They offer several different courses so you'd need
to check with Peter just what's on offer.  Phone him on (44) 1386 552 443
or fax (44) 1905 754 760

Dick has done his part continuing to maintain this list which I founded many
years ago.  I haven't contributed much lately but can provide a contact to
the BJCP (beer judge certification program) which is the largest judge
certifying body in North America to coordinate feedback from the cider
community into the requirements for certifying judges (I'm codirector of the
BJCP exam administration).  I believe the BJCP is also working on a cider
score sheet.


I encourage efforts to create such an organization and would be happy to
participate.

Subject: An apple source
From: "John R. Bowen" <jbowen@primary.net>

For those of you looking for apple tree sources, I have just received 
a catalog from Ed Frackler's Rocky Meadow Orchard & Nursery near 
Louisville, KY.  He does't list any specific old cider varieties, but 
he does have a paragraph on cider production and suggests some current 
varieties.  He clearly is receptive to cider making ideas, and has 
some thoughts on Asian Pear cider, too.


He does carry the Hewes Virginia Crab which he says has been long used 
in cider production.  This might be a good planting for those with 
little space and the need for ornamental value, too.


He usually has scion wood of many varieties not listed in the catalog, 
and might have some other interesting things if you ask.


I believe he also sells fruit locally and would be a good source of 
interesting varieties for those in his area.


I have no affiliation, but have been a customer and gotten good advice 
in the past.

Subject: Malolactic fermentation
From: "John R. Bowen" <jbowen@primary.net>

I would like to learn more about malolactic fermentation.  I have two 
ciders, the first from summer apples that started with a gravity of 
about 1.040 and titrable acidity  of about .7% (tartaric).  Gravity 
raised to about 1.06 with honey.  Cote des Blancs yeast.  It is now (2 
months, 75F) fermented out to below 1.000, the sweetness is gone, and 
the sourness remains. It doesn't taste very pleasant or appley.


The second is just starting, from crabapples.  Gravity about 1.05, 
acids 1.8% (tartaric).  Cote des Blancs yeast.  I thouhgt I might 
blend some with the first batch, but the acidity worries me.


In neither case did I treat with sulfites, pasteruize, or do anything 
to inhibit the wild yeast or bacteria except innoculate with the Cote 
des Blancs.


So the questions are:  Are the malolactic fermentation (bacteria?) 
ALWAYS found on USA apples, of just often, or rarely.  Is there any 
need to innoculate with a commercial culture?  Is the acidity of the 
first batch unreasonably high, and is there any hope for reducing the 
acidity of the crabapple batch?


It seems that English ciders are usually fermented around 50F, my 
basement usually runs 65F in the winter.  What about temperature 
effects?


TIA for your advice.

Subject: Golden Russets

The common wisdom seems to be that Golden Russets are the best bet for
cider in Ontario. Does anyone on the list know of a place in South Cenral
Ontario where I could get a bunch? 


Also, I was told by someone selling sweet cider at our local market that
Golden Russets are poor juice producers. I suspect, as I have heard no one
else mention it, that he was BSing me. What is the bushel to gallon ratio
for these apples?
