Hello,


this may sound like a stupid question, but I'm not a native English speaker, and
I can't find this expression in my dictionary: So what is a "hard cider"?


TIA, private email welcomed

I think David Johnson has a good idea here.  I am a NAFEX member and 
there are certainly areas of common interest between us cider types 
and the fruit grower types of NAFEX.  I recall several letters in 
Pomona that would have been appropriate posted here, and probably some 
the other way.  Perhaps if I get a few minutes I will drop a line to 
Jackie Kuehn, the Pomona editor.  And any others of you who know of 
NAFEX could do the same--make it a groundswell.


For those who might be interested in NAFEX membership, the address is:
NAFEX, 1716 Apples Rd., Chapin IL (USA) 62628.  Membership is $8/yr 
($12 outside USA) including 4 issues of Pomona.

My readings in winemaking about malolactic 
fermentation indicate that malic acid, the source 
of sourness in cider is best temperred by MLF
(malolactic fermentation).  MLF is insured by the
introduction of malolactic bacteria culture either
before primary fermentation or after the completion 
of secondary fermentation, if the wine/cider is left 
on the lees ( the bacteria need the lees as a food 
source).  It is important that sulfite levels are at a 
minimum, so your brew is a good medium.  Malolactic
bacteria may be present (and dormant) on any apples
but to insure MLF I would innoculate with an introduced
culture.  Presque Isle Wine Cellars(email: prwc@erie.net 
or www.erie.net/~prwc) is a source of MLF cultures.  Keep
in mind that MLF requires warmer (than typical wine cellar/
storage) temperatures.  That is why natural MLF is associated 
with the spring season.  You might warm your cider to primary
fermentation temperature and hold it there for a couple of weeks 
under airlock. If fermentation resumes it's most likely natural 
MLF at work.  If not; experiment with and introduced culture.

Cider Makers,
        I have a batch of cider and a cyser in the carboy. I want to let 
them age in the carboy for awhile but one of my cider books said one 
shouldn't let a cider sit on its lees with a pH over 3.6. Both are around 
3.8. Should I wait for them to clear and then rack to another carboy for 
aging?
        Also, I can see myself making perry in the future when my pear 
trees come into bearing. What are the tricks to this? I saw a mention 
about them being difficult to clear. Pears seem to be a fruit that 
wouldn't be easy to balance because they don't seem to be very acidic.

Now that we know that Woodpecker isn't "real" cider, and I am well 
into making by first batches, I occurs to me that I have probably 
never tasted good "real" cider and may not even like it.  So before I 
tie up too many more carboys, is there a commercially available 
bottled "real" cider or reasonable qualit  in the USA, especially one 
that I would be able to find in a good midwest bottle shop?  
Everything I have seen to date contains fruit flavors and malic acid, 
at the least.


TIA
John
