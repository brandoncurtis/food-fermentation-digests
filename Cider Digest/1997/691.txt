Subject: Infinite Pears & Scrumpy

Questions:


        I'm new to cider making & brewing.  I have just received an infinite
supply of small european pears.  These pears have a wonderful aroma, 
are fairly sweet, but are gritty in texture even after prolonged cooking.


        It occurs to me that they would make good perry or pear cider.


Q1.     Not having a fruit press yet, I was wondering if I could use
a variation on the the same technique as for scrumpy:  
A.  Freeze the fruit to break up the cell structure.
B.  Run it through a grinder to break up the chunks.
C.  Add appropriate yeast (or let it ferment from the local inhabitants.)
D.  Once the action has settled down, filter through cheese cloth to
get the big chunks out.  
E.  Transfer to a clean container.
F.  Let freeze on the porch, skimming the ice off the top with a strainer
each morning.
G.  Bottle the stuff that doesn't freeze by the time it reaches 0 F.


Q2.     When working with whole fruit, instead of juice, should it be
cooked?


Q3.     It seems to me that a lot of the fruit isn't touched by this process
before the yeast poison themselves in their own alchohol.  Is there merit
in diluting the remaining pulp, and restarting the culture?

Concerning the post about whether or not the individual would like cider:
Not to worry!  Try it!  You'll LIKE it!

Hello Cider buddies!


I have a couple of questions. Has anyone had experience with Good Nature
apple grinder/presses? They are in New York state. I am in California and I
asked one farmer/juicer who said that he got better results with his hammer
mill type of press that with the Good Nature press. I imagine that some
presses are better for certain apples than others. Any ideas?


Second question, has anyone tried to pasteurize cider using a microwave? Is
it possible to scale this up for commercial purposes for large batches?


Lastly, a Rhyne Cyder update: We hope to be in Cost Plus World Markets (4
locations in the San Francisco Bay Area) and Beverages & More (S.F. Bay
area) by the end of October. Sales out of the Ravenswood Winery tasting
room are going well. We are working on a batch of Gravenstein apple cider
right now. That is all for now!

People making cider in the Ohio area will be glad to know that Hobby Horse Hill 
is open again this year (they nearly got shut down last year by the health 
department 'cause they don't pasteurize, but calmer heads prevailed).  They're 
probably the oldest running wooden flatbed press in Ohio, and will do custom 
pressings in addition to their own pressings.  The batch I picked up yesterday 
was made with Jonathan's, Paulareds, and another whose name I don't remember. 
 I've had really good luck in previous years with their cider.  Send email if 
you need the address, directions (they're waaay out in the boonies), or phone 
number.

I thought cidermakers in Sourthern New England might be interested to
know that Pine Hill Orchards is going to have some Golden Russets later
in the month, at cider apple prices,   Call the orcard at 413 624 3481
for details.
