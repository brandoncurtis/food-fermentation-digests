Hi Im new to cider making and have a simple question.
I see most of the cider recipes are 8%, is there anyway to crank it up to
15 or 20%

Hi all I just found this list and have a couple of questions.


I have 6gl of fresh local cider SG 1.050 with out adding any sugar.
I sulfited to 50ppm and added pectic enzime. I am going to pitch some
Wyeast #3056 from harvested from a batch of Wheat I just racked to
secondary.  I plan to siphon off some of the cider befor pitching the
yeast, and hold it till fermantion is compleat then add it back befor
bottling to sweeten the cider.  Question 1; How much of the cider should I
hold back so that when it ferments out to very dry I can raise the gravity
to 1.002 or 1.005 knowing that the cider is now 1.050?  Question 2; Do I
have to wait for Malto Lactic fermentation to compleat befor adding the
cider or does MLF only convert Maltic acid to Lactic acid in?


Thanks Dan

Another source for malolactic cultures is Wyeast Laboratories, located 
 in Oregon.  Most home beer making supply stores stock their yeast 
 cultures, and will probably order malolactic  cultures upon request.

The phone number is incorrect- the real number is 413 624 3325.  And
Pine Hill Orchards is in Colrain, Massachusetts, the northwest corner of
the state.  Sorry.

Concerning freezing and skimming ice until ambiance reaches 0 degrees:  A great
idea that should make some potent rocket fuel---but illegal.  It's my
understanding that unlicensed brewers/vintners, etc., such as us are prohibited
by Federal law from concentrating our product in any way, such as distilling or
freezing and removing the ice.  Of course, what you do is your business, but be
careful about posting it.


If I am mistaken about this, I'd be happy to hear so.  Some of my cysers and
meads would be great in a more concentrated form.


Never Thirst,


Dione
