(I'm having a hard time finding any positive way to react to this.)


What's the point?  Are you interested in making cider, or just looking for
a way to get cheap booze?  Do you care at all what it *tastes* like?


If you have 8% cider, you can get something around 19% if you just add 1
part 100-proof vodka for every 2 parts cider.  Is that what you had in
mind?  (I hope not, but if so, please don't waste *good* cider on it.)


OK, I suppose I should be more forgiving about the question.  I suppose I
*would* be more forgiving if this hadn't started off with "Hi, I'm new, how
can I get more alcohol?" without any consideration of what cider is about.

I am amazed at the number of apple trees with unused apples in this 
area.  Those of you who are using commercial juice or concentrate 
might want to look around now for free apples, figure out some easy 
way to crush or grind, press or not, and make a little interesting 
juice.


I live in the vast western suburbs of St. Louis, MO.  Within a mile of 
my house I have located:


1.  Two interesting crabapples (I had to taste 28 to find two I liked) 
that I picked and processed to blend with my summer apples. The owners 
were glad to have them out of the yard and off the driveway.


2.  A fairly large golden delicious that I could have picked, had I 
the time, and shared the apples with the owner.


3.  Two unknown varieties ripe about now, located on an abandonned 
farmstead, now on undeveloped industrial property. Ask the 
groundskeepers for permission.


4.  Two other trees of variety unknown to me, ripe now, with a rich 
winelike flavor and a slightly acidic afterbite.  Good eating and, I 
bet, good cider.  They are in residential yards, dropping on the 
grass.  I haven't time to get them, but I would bet I could have all I 
could pick for free, a couple of bucks, or a future delivery of some 
cider.


5.  Another on a street right-of-way next to a golf course.  Not yet 
ripe, so I can't assess it.  But I bet I could pick it without asking 
anyone.


6.  And three or four red delicious that I wouldn't bother with.


All of these are unsprayed, essentially organically grown, usually 
from badly overgrown and unpruned trees.  There is a certain 
satisfaction in locating these unused assets, tasting them, saying "I 
think this would be good", and using them.  Certainly the quality 
control of using known percentages of known varieties isn't there, but 
a sense of adventure and the satisfaction of the hunter-gatherer sure 
is.


And who knows, you might even make a new friend or two.  Look around 
and give it a try.


John

Sure, but not with plain apple juice. You'd have to add honey
(technically making it "cyser") or sugar. I'd also use a yeast that can
handle lots of alcohol, like a champagne yeast. I think they can get up
around 15-18% alcohol.
        Man, I hope I'm not one of a zillion folks posting this. :)


Cheers,

Dan, I find myself a little perplexed.  It seems to me that the 3056 
will be quite capable of taking the cider to dryness AND eating up any 
of the the additional juice you add to sweeten it later.  How do you 
propose to stop the action of the yeast (and the wild yeasts) so the 
extra stuff you add won't be fermented in the bottle?


Another question on the 3056.  Are you using it because you already 
have a nice healthy culture from your beer secondary, or are you 
trying to get that banana/clove flavor in the cider?  A local brewer 
told me he had tried 3056 to get the flavor, and it wasn't formed.  He 
speculated that 3056 needed something from the wheat malt to form 
those compounds.  I am currently fermenting a gallon of cider with 
3056 and a little wheat malt, and the banana seems to be coming 
through nicely.  While using 3056 from your secondary is not the same 
as from a fresh starter, please let us know if the banana/clove is 
present in the cider.


I have read a little more about the malo-lactic fermentation since my 
last questions.  It is reported to be tricky, sometimes occurring, 
sometimes not, being encouraged by a long exposure to the lees and mid 
70F temperatures, extremely sensitive to sulfites, starting and 
stopping, unpredictable to start by innoculation, and generally a 
pain, culture wise.  So even if you wait, it may not occur.


I don't know if you need to wait before bottling.  I have heard that 
it isn't that strong in CO2 production and won't make bottle bombs, 
but I don't know from experience.


John

I started a new cider and have put the in-progress log on my web for your 
entertainment.


   <Ok, it's a slow hobby and the entertainment value is limited>


Ingredients:
     4 Gallons of fresh cider deep frozen first
               In a previous attempt to deep freeze yeast for reuse, I could
               not get a viable culture. So I figure deep freezing will knock
               out the wild yeast well enough to avoid sulfiting.
     3 lbs. of Raisins
               To add tannin and because I like raisins.
     10 12 oz. cans Granny Smith frozen concentrate
     Wyeast #1338 European Ale
     Pectin Enzyme
     O.G. 1.085

Diane askes about concentration via freezing.  My daddy use to (note he
died in the 1970's -BAF&whatever) skim ice from the pear cider stored on
the back porch. Unfortunately,  exposure to O2 is a problem and vinegar
notes do develop.  At least my long abandoned efforts to emulate my
father, using 2 L pop bottles produced an unfortunate twang of vinegar.

In Canada I've not heard anything against it.  Cider, wine, and beer
are pretty much open territory, unless you *sell* the stuff.  Then
the gov. want's it's take.  I think here you can even run a still,
and make up to X gallons of hard liquor a year -- same proviso --
no selling.  X is an absurdly large number, I think close to a barrel.

Wyeast 3056 is an ale yeast I believe. Mike will probably get better 
results with a champagne yeast. I have used Wyeast 3021 Pasteur champagne 
yeast. I have also had good results with Wyeast 3632 Dry Mead Yeast.
     I have tried Wyeast 3184 Sweet Mead Yeast which is supposed to leave 
residual sweetness. It may do with mead but id didn't with cider.
