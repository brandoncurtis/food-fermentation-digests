        With the recent discussion of the new Proux & Nichols book, I
thought it would be a good time to get help with the last one.  I was
reading the book in the library and was somewhat curious about their
approach to sweet carbonated cider.  I don't remember if they did this
with hard cider or just wanted  to make bubbles in sweet juice, but maybe
it doesn't matter.  The directions described putting the carbonated
bottles in a pot of water and raising the temp up to 150 F or so.
Carbon Dioxide is less soluble in warmer liquids, so wouldn't this risk
exploding bottles?  Anyone try it?  Does the new book go into more detail
on this?

        Has anyone tried using sorbitol to sweeten cider?  I looked it up
in the chemical references I have and couldn't find any info on it's
metabolic activity.  I suspect it's at least partly fermentable, but I
need to find something other than lactose to use?

I have 5 or so batches of cider fermenting along, each made from 
apples from different sources.  I was going to blend that from 
crabapples with that from dessert apples at completion, as I have no 
idea how they will taste.  But now I am wondering, is there any 
benefit to having the extra tannins and acids from the crabapples 
present with the dessert apples DURING the fermentation, as opposed to 
just blended to taste later?


Thanks.

I suggest that you add the desired amount of sugar and let it ferment. 
It certainly wouldn't hurt to add a packet of cultured yeast, but it
probably isn't necessary.  This juice obviously has found a yeast that
is quite happy with the current mix of juice and nutrients and will
probably do quite well on its own.


I once had a related experience.  For a Twelfth Night celebration, I had
made some wassail (which I make as a heavily spiced apple metheglin).  I
made two batches, one alcoholic and the other not.  The alcoholic batch
was finished that night.  The next morning, I decided to warm up the
remaining non-alcoholic wassail to serve with breakfast.  It was heated
to a near boil (steaming well, but no bubbles).  What remained got put
back into a carboy and taken home.  I figured, due to the re-heating,
that there was no active yeast in there.  In a few days, when I had some
time, I would add some more apple juice and honey, throw in a yeast
starter and let it go.  The next day, however, when I got home from
work, I found the stopper on the floor across the room and the juice in
the carboy was fermenting better than I have ever managed by adding an
active starter.  It wasn't the BEST metheglin that I have ever made, but
considering the lack of effort required, it was certainly worthwhile.

Concerning sparkling cider:  a physician whith whom I work tells me he obtained
( or emptied) a pony keg of beer while in med school then filled it with cheap
white wine.  he reconnected it to the Biermiester rig he had and***sparkling
wine on tap!  The Biermiester is a refrigerated cabinet that holds a keg and
CO2 cannister and the necessary regulator and plumbing to have beer on tap. 
Apparently this force carbonates anything coming out of the spout.


This may not be acceptable to some cider lovers who may desire only natural
carbonation, but it does work and you get sparkling cider.

Matt, this is wrong, and dangerously so.


The pressure from contained carbonation won't cause the yeast to go
dormant--that is, not at any pressure you want to be dealing with inside
a glass bottle.


And while champagne bottles are made to take a fair amount of pressure,
fermentation can still produce enough pressure to explode them.

Realize that, although a champagne bottle is quite strong, it *IS* possible
to overcarbonate (by fermentation) enough to break it, and if you do, the
force of the explosion when it finally happens will be greater, hence more
dangerous, than what would happen with a weaker bottle.


Certainly, don't bottle carbonated cider in a wine bottle.  (Unless you've
got pretty tight corks, it'll push the corks instead of exploding the
bottles, but either way gives a result you don't want.)


Beer bottles can handle reasonable carbonation, and champagne bottles can
handle about as much as you could want, but you've still got to watch the
sugar control or you will explode even a champagne bottle.
