So  - I was wondering - can I add more yeast right before bottling to
stimulate the consumption of the sugar - or would this result in a hazy brew
with yeast at the bottom of the bottle? If so, do I have to use the same
yeast? Would yeast nutrient be any better? Or, am I simply tempting fate by
adding more fuel and possibly creating future bottle rockets?


Please let me know - I've got a batch ready to go!


Thanks-

Dear Mark,


Sounds like you're rapidly approaching the manufacture of apple champagne,
which is what I make year after year. Time-consuming and laborious, but
glorious. I ferment to dryness and rack off, leaving the yeasts behind,
then pitch with sugar and a higher-attentuating live yeast culture and
bottle in champagne bottles. After 1.5 years on their sides, I riddle,
disgorge, and dosage the cuvee to produce a fine apple champagne. Try it,
you'll like it!

Some queries:
Andrew Lea recommends plenty of racking when attempting to make a sweet 
cider using wild yeast and having the fermentation take place in a cold 
place. We have 200 gallons of diverse cider apple juice fermenting in a 
suitably cold place. The juice was taken straight from the press to the 
barrel and roughly filtered. When should a first racking take place? Is 
there an upper limit to the number of times that racking can be 
profitably undertaken? Assuming that you have cider/juice to top up the 
barrel.


Is there a cheap way of detecting whether malolactic fermentation has 
taken place?


Thanks Eddy Hefford

Re: Pasteurization in the bottle


At Rhyne Cyder (Sonoma, CA), we are pasteurizing in the champagne bottles
at a temperature of 150-160 degrees F. The first time, we did not
pasteurize soon enough so the sweet juice of the dosage had fermented more
than we had hoped and the carbonation was greater than intended.
Consequently, we lost a couple of bottles during pasteurization due to
pressure build up. The next time, we caught the cider before all of the
sweetness was gone and we were successful. The cider had a very nice
sparkle, apple aroma, and balanced flavor. We are using crown caps, no
corks as of yet.


For those readers in No. California, we will be on the shelves of Beverages
& More, Cost Plus, Food For Thought, Real Foods, as well as some
neighborhood stores in San Francisco. Check it out!


Aloha

There have been several requests posted here in the past for information
regarding sources for heirloom apple trees, and I am happy to report that one of
my favorite growers is now shipping.  If you are interested in old apples, and
in Southern apples in particular, please write Maurice Marshall at:


Marshall's Apple Trees
Route 1, Box 202-A
Camp Dogwood Road
Pinnacle, North Carolina


You can also call Maurice at 910-351-5326.


The fall planting season is not over, and Maurice's trees are shipped with some
soil still on the root ball.  If you pick them up at his place, they will still
be potted up.  I have had excellent luck with his material to date, and his
prices are reasonable.  Say "hello" for me when you get in touch with him.
