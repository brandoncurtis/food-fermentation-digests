I have found that a very good (and natural) sweetener is fructose (fruit
sugar).  It is available in the UK in small quantities from health food
shops and in bulk from manufacturers.


Its advantages are that it is very sweet, so you don't need very much,
and it dissolves very readily.  The only real disadvantage is that it is
fermentable, but I use it for sweetening just before dispatch.  Half an
ounce will take the dryness from 5 UK gallons of my 1996 mainstream
cider now that it has mellowed.

Peter,


Riddle?  Disgorge?  Dosage?  I suppose I could go buy a book on making
champaign and look these terms up, but.........

I'm just starting out with making cider.
Can someone explain some lingo, like "racking" etc. to me?


I heard some friend of mine mention making cider this summer & she
mentioned adding champagne yeast and sugar (table I suppose) to cider (or
was it apple juice?) and Vwalah!!


Before I thought of consulting the web for info, I just thought: "I'll let
this 1/2 gallon of cider sit out at room temperature for awhile, add some
sugar, hope the natural yeast does the trick & hope for the best.  Then, to
my chagrin (after reading the obvious dawned on me) I noticed the
preservatives on the label!


I got another 1/2 gallon of unpreserved cider & wonder if I can make
something cheap, easy, alcoholic, nice-tasting, all in the plastic gallon
container it's in?


Curious,
Gabriel

Eddy Hefford asked as follows:


>>Andrew Lea recommends plenty of racking when attempting to make
>>a sweet  cider using wild yeast and having the fermentation
>>take place in a cold  place.When should a first racking take place? Is
>>there an upper limit to the number of times that racking can be
>> profitably undertaken?




You must follow the gravity drop at least weekly.  If it's greater than 5
degrees per week then you should probably rack immediately to try and slow
it down somewhat.  If it won't - give up and let it go to dryness anyway!


But if it is slow enough, rack at about 1.030.  Then again at about 1.020.
If it's then stable for a month or so, you're OK.




That's the book wisdom.  Here's a table of my gravity drop on 'keeved'
bittersweet cider a couple of seasons ago.  You' ll see I was lucky  and
only had to rack the once - but my trees are all organic with no nitrogen
input so they are naturally slow fermenters:


Date            SG
 3 Dec          55
10 Dec          55
17 Dec          55
24 Dec          54
1 Jan           52
7 Jan           51
13 Jan          44
20 Jan          37


This was a warm spell and I was getting a bit worried things were
going too fast! but then..
27 Jan          32
4 Feb           31
17 Feb          26
At this point I racked
18 Feb          21
25 Feb          21
18 Mar          20
24 Mar          19
Adjusted acidity up by 0.1% (to bring pH down from 4 to 3.8),
added 100 ppm SO2and bottled with crown caps.


This has improved in bottle, is now 2 years old, naturally carbonated, with
enough sweeetness (about 1.015) to balance everything off.


>>Is there a cheap way of detecting whether malolactic
>>fermentation has  taken place?


Yes, using paper or thin layer chromatography.  But you probably need some
lab experience to make it successful, and there is some capital outlay on
the chemicals and glassware.  For Americans, the method is given in
Cornelius Ough's paperback book "Winemaking Basics" (Food Products Press
1992).  For Limeys, I'll send you a photocopy if you e-mail me your postal
address.
