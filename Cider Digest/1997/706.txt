Concerning wild yeasts.... does flash pastuerization destroy the wild yeast?
If so, at what temperature are the yeasts rendered destroyed??

For dark cider I would add dark ( as opposed to light)  brown sugar, at the 
rate of 1/2 lb. per gallon of juice; ferment to dryness; charge with the corn
sugar for sparkle.
I use brown sugars to fortifiy the alcohol content of my  cider ( purists,
please be tolerant).  The darker the sugar, e.i. the greater the carmel content,
the darker the finished cider. Carmel, cooked sugar,  is added to refined or
white sugar in the manufacturing process to provide coloration and retain
moisture. Corn sugar is ground finer therefore an equal volume of corn
sugar would be of greater mass, but you are agonizing over a very small
difference in masses when considering charging doses. At these amounts,
1tsp.+/-, per bottle I doubt that enough carmel would be present to color
your cider sufficiently.
