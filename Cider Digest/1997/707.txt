Conditions used in the apple juice industry to kill wild yeast at packaging
 are typically 10 - 30 seconds at 95 degrees C or 15 - 120 seconds at 85
degrees C.

[This may be kind of "off in a corner" but the digest has been *so* quiet
I figure it's OK to venture it.]


I've got a small apple grinder/press (Happy Valley Ranch, if it matters).
While I'm generally happy with it overall, I've been fussing a lot over the
details.  One particular area that bothers me is the wood parts which have
contact with the juice.  Now, HVR admonishes (correctly) that you need to
finish these parts with a good food-safe finish.  Still, unless you use a
finish that is entirely impenetrable, you're going to pick up some character
of the wood.  I have noticed it particularly in the first juice I get out
of pressing.


The HVR press uses maple, as far as I can tell, for the press basket, top
plate, a slatted tray that the basket sits on, and the sides of the juice-
collection tray.  I believe the tray base is birch plywood.


[slowly ambling around to my question...]  I'm embarking on an experiment
to replace as many of these parts as possible with white oak, on the basis
that if I'm making the sort of cider I'd give oak contact anyway (in a
barrel if I could, or with oak chips in fermentation otherwise), why not
make it so that any wood character the cider picks up from the press be
that of oak?


Still, I intend to finish the wood with a food-safe varnish--to protect it
as much as anything.  (I could be talked out of finishing anything except
the bottom of the juice tray.)


Does anyone have thoughts on this approach?  Please poke holes in it if you
can, or suggest different ways of going about it.
