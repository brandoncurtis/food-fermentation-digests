Subject: Pectic Enzyme

What are the pros and cons of using pectic enzyme in cider and at what
point should it be added?  


I have always added enzyme as early as possible when I got my apple
juice usually at the same time as the Campden tablets.  In reading Jo
Deal's "Making Cider" calls for 1 t/gal of Pectolase at pitching of
yeast.  Is that the same as pectic enzyme?  Should pectic enzyme be
added at pitching?

P.S.  I just started 16 g of my 1998 cider.

Terence Bradshaw was asking about fermentation vessels:


I use a 25 litre plastic bin, with a tap and a grommet in the lid for a 
bubbler.


It works like a charm.


I have been concerned about using clear glass demi-john's, is the clear 
glass an issue??  I recently managed to pick up a brown glass demi-john, 
would this be better to use?

Westons in that but I hope no one from Westons is reading this._
