A brief reminder to folks submitting articles to the digest:  Articles
should be just plain text, with line lengths under 80 characters.


Don't send images; no jpg, hqx, bin, exe, doc, zip, uuencode, base64,
BinHex, html, or any combination of them.  If you've got fancy material,
put it on a web page; send simple text to the digest and give the URL for
the fancier stuff.


I will deal with quoted/printable, but it takes me extra effort to clean it
up, so avoid it if you can.  It's a boneheaded format but it's been forced
on people by overbearing software and ISPs, so I deal with it grudgingly.


Thanks, folks,

What commercially available ciders available in the US are true enough
to the UK traditions to be used as a standard? My apologies if this
subject has come up recently, but the extensive taste testing reported
last week underscores the issue for me.


I have made dry ciders now and again for over 10 years. The first batch
I tossed out because of the excessive sharpness. Then I found out about
malo-lactic fermentation, now exhibit more patience toward the process,
and am relatively pleased with the results. However, it is quite dry,
with few recognizable 'apple' qualities, and no doubt quite different
from the traditional English farmhouse ciders that sound so good.


I can research the traditional apples and  methods at libraries, but
still have not found a cider which tastes like the description of the
farmhouse ciders. Most of the US ciders taste like apple pop with a
yeast aftertaste.  Making Woodpecker my model would be the bland leading
the bland, but the only other British version I've seen in Minnesota is
Weston's, and last week's tasting trashed it also.


Maybe I'm just too fussy, but there has got to be something better out
there. Suggestions?
