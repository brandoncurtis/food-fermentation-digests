On my 12/24 shopping forays, I stopped at a pub for refreshment and they
had Doc Smith cider on tap.  It was served bitter cold in a heavily
frosted mug and as such, was well almost drinkable.  It occured to me
that the domestic ciders that are too sweet to tolerate at 50 degree F
are probably made to drink at 35F.


What temperatures do most cider makers like their craft produced ciders
served?


What temperature do you prefer the industrial grade apple products
served when pubbing?

Would like to trade cider mats (coasters) with other collectors.  I have
over 30 different ones from England and the U.S.  Contact me at 
capshew@otherside.com.

What's wrong with an American brand as a US standard?
America has along tradition of cider making.  Reference the
historical passages of Proulx & Nichols' "Sweet&Hard Cider".
Prohibition ended the commercial ventures and nearly eradicatated
the cottage cideries in the States.  If you need a "taste model"
use Woodchuck or whichever of the US brands that are trying to
revive the trade of American cider.


If you're serious about wanting a "traditional English farmhouse" cider
as a model I suggest a tour of the West country there in the late fall.
A travel agent provided me with a brochure of orchards and cideries that
provide samplings of their product.  Many of these ciders never make it
farther than the local pub.  The brochure was promoted by a cider producers'
association and the listings were all of members.  Apparently there are many
more "farmhouse ciders" since a shop girl in Cambridge told me " that back 
home in Somerset you couldn't give cider away as every farm made it".

Hi Everybody,


I am new on the Digest and fairly new at Brewing.


I have made 2 batches of Cider, one is carbonated, and the other is still.
Both have been sitting now for about 6 - 9 months.  The other day I opened
one of each and they are extremely Dry.  The carbonated one isn't very
carbonated either.


I was wondering if there is anyway to Sweeten a cider once it has been made,
and also what you need to add to a cider to make it a sweet cider when you
are making it.  Any help people can offer me on this would be greatly
appreciated.


Sean
