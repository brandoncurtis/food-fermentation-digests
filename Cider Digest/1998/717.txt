<< I can, however, endorse what Andrew said about Dunkerton's. They also
 operate from Herefordshire, but are a very much smaller company and
 produce very high quality ciders.  They make a single varietal bottled
 cider from the famous Kingston Black apples, which is a superb drink,
 but I don't imagine it is exported to South Africa or the USA.
  >>
Ivor Dunkerton makes quite a few single variety ciders, infact, 
(largely from their own orchards) which
provide a very good opportunity to observer the differing characters of
apple varieties made by the same method and maker (as well as a very
good perry). In my experience they are all excellent but, as Roy says, they
are unlikely to be exported in the near future.

<< Well, this is not exactly true. I *do* expect some beers to taste "malty"
 (though not necessarilly like 'barley' since beer is made with malt
 predominantly, not raw barley) and I *do* expect to be able to discern a
 certain "grapeness" in my wines. FWIW I *do not* expect my wines to taste
 like alcoholic grapejuice though.
  >>
According to a reputable source, (Keith Thomas of Brewlab, University of
 Sunderland), "malty" flavours in beer are derived entirely from yeast
fermentation biproducts and not actually from the malt itself at all.
Very few traditional westcountry ciders have any noticable apple 
flavours.

 traditional temp. for serving in England?
  >>


Keg ciders tend to be served too cold.
Traditional cider is often served at room temperature (often just from
a polycask sitting on the bar)
Ideally I would say at "cellar temperature" (ie 12 C or 55 F) but it seems
to survive a larger variation than beer.

        Has anyone made a cherry/apple cider? If so, any info would be
greatly appreciated, ie what yeast was used, etc.  Thanks in advance.

I generally prefer my cider (and beer) at room temperature, ~65 F.  My
rule of thumb is to serve a potable at the temperature at which it was
fermented...

Cider fans,
    I am posting this on behalf of a friend. He has a relative who is a
pilot . This pilot apparently flies to Sweden, England, and France on a
regular basis. He has offered to bring back some bottles for my friend.  He
would like recomendations on commercial ciders as well as where to buy them.
I must admit that my own motives are not pure. This friend has been generous
enough to share with me in the past. I am hopeful the pattern continues.
