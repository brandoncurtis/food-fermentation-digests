 My sister started a 3 week trip to London yesterday.  
 
 "Let me know what cider I should bring you back," was her parting
 statement.
 
 Any recommendations about what I should request of her?  I doubt 
 she'll have the chance to leave the city much, nor hit any obscure
 markets.
 
 Any thoughts on customs issues on the way back in the states?

Really good bottled cider is difficult to find without visiting the actual
cider
makers.  If she can find any try anything by Dunkerton's
and any of the the "Traditional Methode" (ie Champaigne ciders)
especially that made by Bollhayes (for a west-country style cider)
& Gospel Green (for an East of England style).
On a slightly more commercial style (which can be found in some
Tesco's supermarkets) try any of the new single variety ciders made
by Thatchers.

Eckard Witte asked last week


>>Could you make a sweet cider with that low alc without adding
>>any chemicals? It's not the stuff I like to drink: Not because
>>of the low alc (wonderful!), but because of all the chemicals.


The answer is yes, by cold arrested fermentations, and the mainstream
French cider industry has invested heavily in huge refrigerated
fermentation vats and centrifuges so that they can and do produce naturally
sweet ciders.  French law (unlike English) specifically forbids the
addition of any 'chemicals' in cider, I think, except citric acid and SO2.
I can't believe that the mainstream French industry (which is two-thirds
owned by Pernod-Ricard) would be deliberately flouting that!  So by and
large French cider is a lot closer to the 'real thing' than most of what
you can buy in Britain.
