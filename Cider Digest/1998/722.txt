Subject: How much fruit whole vs. pureed?
From: Vicky Rowe <vrowe@us.ibm.com>

Got a question for the collective:


I'm making a cyser from 4 gal red delicious/yellow delicious/winesap
cider I got at the farmer's market. I've added 3/4 lb brown sugar, 4.5
lbs wildflower honey and pitched with Pasteur champagne yeast. This
will be a raspberry cyser (I made one before, but with juice concentrate)
and I have a large amount of pureed, pastuerized, seedless raspberries
which will be placed in a mesh bag and rack the cyser onto for
secondary.


I know the cyser primary will ferment out pretty dry, having done it
before. I am going for a final product that is full bodied, deep red,
and of medium sweetness, not cloying, but just a little *sweet*.


I also have a raspberry mel in primary. 5 gal batch with 10.2 lbs
tupelo honey, using Wyeast sweet mead yeast and yeast
nutrient.  Going to use the same technique, rack the must onto
a bag of pureed berries in secondary. I would also like this
to be medium sweet (mainly *not* dry).


The questions are this:
How much raspberry puree should I add?
What would be an equivalent amount of smooshed whole berries?
Is there a difference in how much pureed vs. how much berries?
What pitfalls am I missing here?
And finally, what are your opinions on oaking (using toasted
oak chips) this for added flavor? What about amounts


Any help would be appreciated, as I am winging it with these recipes,
making it up as I go along.

Hello Everyone!  I've made only a few batches of cider, but the constant 
fount of information from this digest has been extremely helpful for my 
plans.  Unfortunately, as I've mentioned in a previous post, I live in 
South Florida, which really has little access to real unfermented apple 
cider, or even a wide range of apples...


Recently I finished fermenting a batch of cider that used juice that had 
ascorbic acid added...I will never do that again- it is rather sour in 
taste...I think that it would be okay if it is sweetened up; is there 
any way to sweeten it without kicking in another fermentation?  I have 
some lactose but I've never used it in anything...


Have y'all ever used lactose?  How much should I use for 5 gallons? What 
about other inert sugars?  I've also thought about pasteurization, but 
it sounds like a lot of work...


Any advice on the above, or other suggestions on how to save my sour 
cider would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Cranberries again!

I'd no idea cranberries would arouse such interest.  My comments were a
space-filler for the dull days of winter as much as anything!


It does seem from people's very differing experiences that we still have
quite a lot to learn here - not only about the natural variation between
cranberry types, but also about the sensitivity of different fermenting
yeasts to benzoic acid.  Certainly it's known that some spoliage yeasts
(e.g Zygosaccharomyces bailliii) can romp away in the presence of high
benzoic levels, but most fermenting yeasts are generally presumed to be
quite sensitive - perhaps it isn't true.  We do occasionally see soft
drinks infected with wild yeasts which are tolerating the levels of
benzoate normally added as a preservative.  Perhaps cranberries also bring
their own benzoate-tolerant yeasts with them?


Incidentally the only reason I got involved in this problem at all was for
a jam manufacturer whose cranberry jelly had been rejected by government
analysts on importation into Asia.  The analysts claimed that benzoate had
been illegally added as a preservative - the jam manufacturer denied it,
and that's when we discovered the high natural levels of benzoate and
vaccciniin in his fruit stock.  Always something new to discover!!

Collective,
There has been a discussion in MLD and I thought I would copy my idea here
and more ideas. I've been thinking about making a batch of sweet cider buy
heating up the cider to about 160F and then cooling it to force carbonate.
I'm not worried about all the oxidization and other gremlins that might
occur, I just want to try a gallon and see how it affects the flavor.  The
discussion in MLD has been reassuring as they say that all the alcohol
can't be removed by boiling.  Anyone try this? (I've heard it done in the
bottle, but the possibility of explosion scares the hell out of me).
