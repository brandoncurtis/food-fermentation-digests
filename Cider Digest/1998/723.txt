Many yeasts I think work until they poison themselves with the alchohol
Champagne yeasts go further than most this way.  If you keep adding
sugar eventually, you will get to a point where the yeast are too
sick to turn it into alchohol.  In the interests of maintaining
a reasonable flavour, you may want to instead use a yeast that doesn't
go to such a high proof.  


In order to carbonate it however you need to make some of the sugar
available again.  You might try adding various forms of sweetener
until fermentation stops, and you have it just a touch sweeter
than you want, transfer to another container, the dilute it some
with plain water.  This will drop the alchohol concentration 
so that the yeast that are semi-dormant because they're pickled
will febbly come back to life to carbonate your cyser with
their last gasp.

I think that lactose would do just the opposite of what you want.
It has very little sweetness to it (milk has a lot of lactose
in it, but doesn't taste sweet.)

     New to the CD, although I've made my share of cider....
     Might you be familiar with the term 'keeving' in regards to cider
making?  I'm looking into the French cidre making and noted it's low
alcohol.  It appears to be from letting the must sit for a bit, and
pectins forming a cap on the must, then siphoning the juice from under
it.  Also referred to as 'debourbage' or even 'defecation'.  Might
this be something I could do at home?  And how does this affect yeast
metabolism?  Addition of sugars, etc.  I'm looking for more
information on this.  Sorry, but I'm ftp impaired here.. :-(


TIA!
