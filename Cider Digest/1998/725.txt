Asked about Lactose - my last batch of cider seemed totally undrinkable, it 
was exceptionally sour.


I added (in 250g batches) lactose until it tasted a little better, and then 
bottled.  I ended up adding +/- 1kg of lactose to +/- 25litres of cider. 
 When I opened the first bottle on Saturday, it was a whole lot better, not 
SWEET, but certainly not as sour as it had started off.

I use proper English/French bittersweet cider varieties, but I appreciate
these are almost unobtainable
for people in North America.
********************


The lack of proper european cider apples in North America is a recognized
problem for hobby cider-makers.
I have created a website which I hope can facilitate some exchange of apple
varieties among hobby orchardists and cider lovers. The purpose of this
site is to bring together people who share an interest in growing and
preserving different varieties of  apples. The intention is to encourage an
interest in varieties of apples which are uncommon or commercially
unavailable.


People who own apples trees and would like to provide grafting material to
other collectors can post the varieties available. People who want to graft
and grow uncommon varieties of apples can also post their requests.

Trade of living apple wood, scions and seeds across international borders
requires a federal government permit, but it is not impossible. Traders in
apple material should be cautious not to spread diseases within North
America, however, with due care, hobby cider-makers can finally grow a few
trees to support their cider habits.
