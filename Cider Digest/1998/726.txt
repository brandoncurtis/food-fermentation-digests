Folks-
About Greg Appleyard's website for cider variety information-The USDA Malus
Germplasm Repository at our Cornell/Geneva NY Experiment Station has some
bittersweet and bittertart apples among its 4000 accessions.  They have
many of the traditional English cider varieties, including Michelin,
Dabinett, Ellis Bitter, Ashton Bitter, Brown Snout, Brown Thorn, Filbarrel,
Margil, Kingston Black, Foxwhelp, Somerset Redstreak, Medaille d'Or,
Tremlett's Bitter, Hereford Redstreak, Chisel Jersey, Yarlington Mill,
Bramley's seedling, etc.  Most of these are available as budwood, by
arrangement with Steven A. King (315) 787-2339.  This is a good time of
year to obtain dormant budsticks for bench grafting.  Bear Creek Nursery,
in Northport, Washington also has many of these varieties for sale as
benchgrafts or one-year budded trees. They already offer a good selection
of "antique" dessert apples, and are interested in collecting and
propagating hard cider varieties.
In my opinion, the most serious lack of budwood now is the hundreds of
excellent French and Spanish bittersweet and bittertart varieties. Perhaps
someone in Quebec has some of the French varieties? I have been working
with the Malus Repository collection curator to expand our collection of
these varieties, but it is a slow process that involves prolonged
quarantine of all imported plant materials, and a considerable amount of
red tape.  In the meantime, we can all help to determine which of the
traditional European cider apple varieties will survive our formidable
winters and pest complex in America, and which of our traditional American
cider varieties are best for hard cider blends.  It seems certain that some
of the millions of newly recruited cider drinkers in Canada and the US will
progress through this first generation of carbonated, artificially flavored
and sweetened mass market ciders into the more subtle but enduring
pleasures of tannic, dry, full bodied varietal ciders that usually require
bittersweets and bittertarts.  When that time comes, we need to have those
apples growing!

An update on the cranberry mel:  I racked and added one quart of
knudsen's Just Cranberry."  Very tart!  It took two TBS of CaCO3 to
bring the pH up from 2.8 to 4.0.  It's still fermenting merrily!
