 After doing a bit of research, I came to the conclusion that the
European cider varieties defoliate too late to survive Zone 4 winters.
I'd REALLY like to be proved wrong on this point.  
I have since turned my attention to varieties that are climate
appropriate, however I can find no published information on tannin
levels for American varieties. Lacking a spectrometer, my queries have
come to a halt. Has anyone come across any such information?

I have just brewed my first still cider, and wanted to know how much, if
any bottle conditioning was necessary.


Basically, I took 3 gallons of non pasteurized apple juice, added 4lbs
of light brown sugar, 1lb of dark brown sugar, some ground cinnamon and
cloves and put in the primary for 1 month while it fermented, then I
kept it in the secondary for 3 months.  I have just bottled it last
weekend and it tasted great, though it was quite strong.


Any advice on the length of bottle conditioning, or if it will get
better over time will be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,
Mike Cukrow
