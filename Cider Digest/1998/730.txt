On the weekend I bought a type of apple called 'Fireman' from our local organic 
orchard, and when I tasted it those around me were alarmed that I described it 
as bitter. I got the impression that they didn't associate the word bitter with 
part of the flavour profile of apples - tart, yes, astringent, yes, but bitter? 
This included the person selling at the orchard. I imagine that even orchardists
don't necessarily know or understand what is inside an apple.


Has anyone heard of this variety, and can they confirm my taste experience, and 
whether they might be suitabole for cider (which I suspect, perhaps in blend 
with other varieties)?

I'm curious about a possible alternative to sweating fruit before
milling, especially where large quantities are involved.  Has anyone
tried using a reverse-osmosis machine on fresh cider to concentrate it? 
In Vermont there are some maple sugarers who have such units which pass
sap across a membrane which does not allow the sugars and flavoring
compounds through.  Then this sap can be boiled off with higher yields
and in less time.  Since sugarmakers don't use this equipment in the
fall, I thought that we may have an opportunity to try it out.....
