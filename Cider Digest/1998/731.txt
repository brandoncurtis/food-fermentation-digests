Cidermakers,
    I am getting ready for spring planting and wanted to know about the
hardiness of classic cider varieties. I live in southwest Wisconsin right on
the border of USDA zones 4&5 . Our typical winter will have a few nights
where the temperature will drop to -20 deg F (? -29 deg C). But nights
of -10 deg F are more common. My orchard site is near the top of a hill but
the winds aren't too bad. The neighbors down the hill tend to get a lot more
frost damage than I. Andrew Lea was kind enough to suggest Dabinette which I
was able to locate at Southmeadow.  I visited his web page and perused the
info there on cider varieties (his page is definitely worth a visit). I also
came across an offering for Herefordshire Redstreak in the Bear Creek
Catalog. Any info on this variety? They had offered Kingston Black a few
years ago but it is not in there new catalog. It makes one wonder why. My
concern is that I would be dooming a tree to struggle and die in my location
or I may have ripening problems.

Sorry if this is a dead horse, but I don't know if the question was ever
resolved on this digest. Therefore -
More info on the message I forwarded before regarding fermentation effects
on E. coli:
