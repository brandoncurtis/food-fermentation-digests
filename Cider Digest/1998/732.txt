Subject: Hardiness of English varieties

We have had Yarlington Mill, Bulmer's Norman and Tremlett's Bitter for
several years near Georgian Bay in Ontario, borderline Zones 4 and 5.
One winter was cold enough to kill a few Mac/M25, about one-half of our
Mutsu/M26 (=Crispin),  and almost all of a few Gravenstien/M26.  These
English varieties appear to be as hardy as most of our commercial
varieties here. They are, however, very biennial in bearing.
