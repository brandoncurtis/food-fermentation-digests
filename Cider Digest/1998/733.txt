I finally made it 55 miles west to visit Grand Rapids MI and had a
chance to try Black and Fagan's "Goldfinch" cider.  My compliments to
the cidermaker as it is a very fine balance of tart, sweet, dry and
astringent.  It heads my list of commercial ciders and their
advertisment goldfinch photo/placard hanging in the bar, is a work of
art I want to acquire for my rec room.  I'll even remove a beerbabe (St
Pauli's) to make room.   cheers,  jim booth, lansing, mi


ps   a cidermaster? a fermenter?  whats the equivalent of brewer?

I have just come into possession of 10 pounds of fresh-frozen red
raspberries. I would like to make a dry raspberry cider. Does anyone out
there have a recipe I could have.


Thanks in advance...
