Subject: Using Syrups?

        I was wondering if anybody out there has had any experience with
Fruit Syrups (such as those made by Monin) in brewing cider.  I would like
to try making a cherry/apple cider using the fruit syrup, but I don't have
any idea on how much to use, etc.


        Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: American Cider Apple Trees?

Last weekend's spring-like weather prompted me to cut down my two 
 uninteresting apple trees.  Now I need to fill the empty space!


I need help deciding what apple varieties to plant.  I have room for 
 two trees, and I would prefer to go with traditional American cider 
 varieties (but I'll listen to other ideas).  I already have a good 
 source for Golden Russet juice, so that obvious choice is out.


I have yet to find a definitive reference for American apple varieties 
 (like Morgan&Richards is for British apples), but I have tried to 
 makes some guesses based on the descriptions in the Miller Nurseries 
 catalog.  Does anyone have opinions about the following varieties:


Arkblack/Black Twig, Calville Blanc, Cox Orange Pippin, Duchess of 
 Oldenburg, Gravenstein, Pound Sweet, Red Astrachan, Roxbury Russet, 
 Sops of Wine, Spitzenburg, Wagener, Winesap, Wolf River.


Are there other varieties that I should be considering?


Thanks,
