RE: apple flavor


Apple flavor can be affected by the yeast, the apples, fermentation
process, time in the bottle, and so on. One of the things that we have been
doing that seems to get nice results is a second fermentation in the
bottle. The aroma that would normally be lost during primary fermentation
due to evaporation is captured in the bottle. When we open a bottle, the
carbonation contains some of that natural aroma that suggests an apple
product. We stop the  second fermentation by pasteurizing the package with
the cap on the bottle. That retains the aroma and some natural sweetness.
So far, we have also found that people don't know too much about what to
expect from apple cider except that they want it sweeter. Those people that
drink wine are more receptive to our blend as we are trying to make a fine
sparkling beverage that balances acid/sweetness/natural processes, etc.


For those of you in the San Francisco Bay area, Rhyne Cyder will be pouring
our cider in the wine tent at the Apple Blossom Festival in Sebastopol on
4/26/98 from 10am-5pm. On May 2nd in Berkeley, we will be at the Oak Barrel
wine and beer making shop "home brew tasting" from about 1pm-5pm.


That is all for now!!
