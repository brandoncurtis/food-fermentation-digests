With my third batch (a success, despite a convoluted fermentation 
process) rapidly vanishing, and with thoughts on batch 4 (using 
some good store-bought juice that I found) starting up, I thought 
I'd better check with those better in the know about a practice 
of mine.


In my first two batches, I stashed a couple bottles away, with the 
idea that I would someday take a bottle from all my batches, and 
compare them.  I'm planning on stashing a couple bottles from this 
batch as well.


Is this a bad idea?  Am I wasting of cider?  I havn't opened up any of 
the old bottles yet (batch 1 was back in fall/winter '94, batch 2 was 
in late spring, '96, and batch 3 was last fall, '97).  Am I likely to 
find them terrible-tasting?  The first and third batches were rather dry.  
The second batch was a little bit sweeter.


In other words, what's the shelf-life of cider?


In Christ,

Are there any cider contests coming up in the New England area?

Looking for any general advice/comments --
The best sweet cider I can easily get my hands on is a "flash frozen"
Gravenstein juice which I find quite tasty right out of the jug.  I'm new to
cider, & have put some of this into a robust cyser and (blended) into a New
England style cider.  SInce both are still in secondary, I don't yet know
they'll come out.
Anybody have any experience using this variety on its own for cider?  Any
particular blends recommended for Gravenstein?  Thanks!

There has been much talk about E. coli in apple cider these days and one
past reference in the cider digest to the lack of survival of this pathogen
in fermented cider. Does anyone know of research work that has looked at
the survival of E. coli in fresh cider that has been treated with sulfite?
Or in grape juice for that matter. There is a fairly large market suppling
grape juice to winemakers and these folks could be facing the same problem
us cider makers are in getting fresh juice that has not been heat treated.
Thanks.
