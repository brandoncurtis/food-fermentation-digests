Not long ago I finally got round to bottling some of my 1996 cider.  It
tastes fine, except that it is refusing to carbonate in the bottle (the
last bit of yeast must have all settled out).  I suspect I will have to
innoculate the bottles to finish it properly.


I have had a batch from around 1992, which was not a particularly good
summer (wet and cool) here in southern Ontario, which we ignored for about
4 years, after which it was much better.  I've had bottles from other
batches taste great after a few years in the bottle.


I guess if you made it well then it will keep and improve for a long time.

Cider digest:


Here is an excerpt from an article recently posted on a USDA apple bulletin
board from Dr. Mosbah Kushad of the University of Illinois:




"Commercial preservatives like sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate were
tested for their effect on E. Coli O157:H7 in unpasteurized apple cider.
0.1% Potassium sorbate had very little effect on E. coli, while 0.1% sodium
 benzoate was more effective in reducing the contamination.  The best
 results were obtained when both preservatives were combined. "


I recall other posts (a couple of which I previously relayed to the Cider
Digest, others I can't relocate) that made it sound like the only sure ways
to completely destroy E. coli in cider are pasteurization and fermentation.
I'll keep trying to find something specific on sulfites.

1. Cider should be drunk within five years, I feel, but should be aged
for one before consuming.  It is always interesting to taste ciders as
they age, however, and I don't see a problem with saving a few bottles
of each batch for a day ong in the future.
2. Two cider competitions I know of:
American Homebrewer's Association National competiton:
see http://www.beertown.org/AHA/NHC/index.html


Northern New England Regional Home Brew Competition

RE: Cider keeping qualities


>From what I have read here and else where, cider that has been sealed to
prevent exposure to oxygen will keep for a long time--years. I had some 10
year old cider a couple of years ago and it was very tasty. This assumes
that the cider is good to start with and good, clean technique was employed.


RE: Gravenstein: In Sonoma County, many Gravenstein apples are grown and
they are used mostly for juicing and canning. We have found the juice to
have plenty of sugar and lots of acid, and low pH--all good for fermenting
purposes. One problem is that they are early harvest(July-Augustin
California) so you need to be ready for them. They are not keepers from
what I understand so you need to juice quickly. If you don't have
refridgeration, they will start fermenting immediately given the warm
temperatures of August. Our batch last year went dry on 8 days. Before
bottling, we blend it with our other batches. We like the results.
