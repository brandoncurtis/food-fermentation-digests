Subject: Follow up on apple flavor
From: "David Johnson" <dmjalj@inwave.com>
Date: Fri, 8 May 1998 20:25:38 -0500


Cidermakers,
    I want to thank those who responded here and privately to my questions
regarding apple flavor. It seems that there was a majority opinion here
that I added too much sugar . It seems reasonable to cut it back next time.
some of my books say ,however, that a cider with less than 5.7% alcohol is
risky and a stable unpasteurized cider should be at least 9%. Another says
to bring the OG to above 1.060. What Is safe?
    There were also varying opinions about treatment of the juice. There were
opinions against both sulfiting and about pasteuizing. Does one have to
ferment "wild" then. It seems somewhat risky. Or do you just pitch a very
large amount of yeast (a "killer" strain). I am kind of chicken about using
the wild yeasts. One of my texts suggests using campden tabs to stun the
natural flora and kill bacteria. It then will take up to 2 weeks for the
natural yeasts to begin fermenting.  Is this a common practice? Is it
really that easy? 
    There was also concensus that I should wait. Time will help with some of
the flavor. I can expect that some of the stronger flavors will fade and
the apple flavors will come to the front in a few months.This is consistent
with comments I recieved when I entered my cider as a New England style
cider in the Bidal Society contest in Kenosha, WI. It scored a 32. 
Comments included "Nice Apple aroma with some spiciness... brown sugar
noticable...acid high and lingers long...  A well made cider" but the main
criticism seemed to be the "hot" alcohol and acid that the judges felt
would age out. One of the judges is fairly well known in judging circles. I
figure I did OK.
    Again, thanks for the help!
               Dave
