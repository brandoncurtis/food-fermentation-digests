Dave Johnson asks about stability of cider at less then 5.7% EOH.  I've
gone below that without problems and even bottled my leavings from an
effort at applejack as cider lite and it was satisfactory.  


The wisdom of the craft should probably prevail over my limited
experiences though and I usually try to get my OG to 1.055.

General question for the pomologists out there:  What determines when a
particular variety of apple blooms, when the fruit ripens, etc.?  E.g., is
it photoperiod, temperature,...?  Is there anything that a grower can do
to influence this to a useful extent?  (tree siting or some such)


Motivation:  What, if anything, can we do to give particular varieties a
better chance for successful harvest in the face of uncooperative local
weather/climate?
