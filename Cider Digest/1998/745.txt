Richard,
What is your pomology text, and (to everyone) what pomology texts do
people use in learning pomological type things without formal training?
TIA,
Rod

Just last week I bottled my ciders - a still fermented with ale yeast,
and one with champagne (the "quite dry" sparkling I referred to back in
December).


I kept the 2ndary fermenters as cool as feasible, leaving them in the
garage until mid-December (when temperatures outside ranged toward 0
degrees F), then placed in a cool area in the house where the
temperature ranges 55 - 60 F.


I cannot really tell if the cooler temps had any effect. The sparkling
cider, reached SG 1.000 within 10 days of being brought inside. On the
other hand, the batch fermented with ale yeast was observably going
until 4 weeks ago, SG at bottling was at 1.010. 


This was my first experience with ale yeast, and the results are quite
different from the champagne batch. The residual sugar are evident in
tasting, and I would characterize it as having more body than the other.
It's also less harsh, leading me to believe that malo-lactic
fermentation took place only in the ale batch. I definitely will ferment
with ale yeasts from now on.


A final note:
I was recently made a gift of Dunkertons Dry, fresh from across the
'pond', and sampled it last night. It has quite a bite, that would
primarily be the tannin, I presume. I believe I'll have to sip it awhile
to form a suitable opinion of it, but definitely prefer it to most of
the draft styles available here. In the meantime I am resigned, as Marc
Montefusco advised, to enjoy the process.
