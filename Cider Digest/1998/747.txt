I agree, this all sounds very troubling. I have never dealt with 
Southmeadow. Have you tried getting the varieties you need from Sonoma 
Antique Apple Nursery in Sonoma CA? At first I was worried about buying 
from a nursery located in a climate so different from mine (central 
Indiana) but we have been dealing with them for three years now and 
every interaction has been absolutely positive, and the trees are 
growing great! (Except for the one my dad girdled with his weedwhacker, 
but that's another story.) We have purchased Trembletts Bitter, 
Yarlington Mill, Kingston Black, Ashmeads Kernel and Foxwhelp from 
Sonoma, and one year when they were unable to fill an order in the 
spring for a particular variety we had reserved the previous fall, they 
both refunded our money and sent a 2 year old tree of another cider 
variety completely free! We have also bought rootstock and scion wood 
from them, and given the fact that we were complete grafting novices 
when we started, the fact that any of them took at all (I think we're 
batting about 30%) is a testament to the quality of the raw material.

You have certainly picked a good one to start with.  Ivor Dunkerton
is a superb cider maker, and his Perry has just won the Perry
section of CAMRA's Champion Cider and Perry of Britain competion.

I have not had any experience with Southmeadow. I have ordered trees from
Bear Creek Nursery for the last two years and have been very pleased with
the quality. Their addresses are:


Bear Creek Nursery
PO Box 411
Northport, WA 99157


BearCrek@plix.com
BearCreekNursery.com


The trees arrived when requested, were in excellent health, and had 18-24
inches of growth the first year.
