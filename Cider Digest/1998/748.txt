I've dealt with them once and I was happy with the trees I got.  My problem
was that they don't (or at least didn't, two years ago) offer the choice of
rootstock I need.  Most of what they offered was on MM 106 or 111.


Where I am, fireblight can be a serious problem, and I don't believe either
of those rootstocks are particularly resistant, which is why I've been
seeking out M-7 and its successors.

Same here.  Bear Creek will also do custom grafting (a solution to my
rootstock problem, at the cost of an extra year for the tree to grow).
Their selection of traditional English cider varieties is limited.


I like the folks at both Bear Creek and Sonoma Antique...they are
interesting, interested, and helpful.

After reading the note from Jim Luedtke about the Dinkerton's Dry cider he
got from England, I am beginning to question the quality of what I have been
making.


The ciders I have made (both dry and sweet), turn out like very smooth white
wines rather than having any kind of astringent bite to them. Those that
have fruit added to them seem to end up with a mellow intense fruit flavor,
much nicer than any fruit wine I have tasted. Am I doing something wrong???
(I really like the ciders I have made.)

As our orchard grows, we are thinking about the kind of equipment need
to make juice. Can we draw some ideas on equipment? It's going to be a
pricy proposition as we look at the Goodnature  equipment  and
traditional hydraulic  rack and cloth presses.   We are looking at an
integrated wash, shred and press operation to do about 50 gal/hr. Has
anyone worked with the Italian or German air/water bladder presses?  I
realize this question may be of little interest to the majority of Cider
subscribers, but think that there is wealth of information and ideas in
this community to help us out as we work through this.
