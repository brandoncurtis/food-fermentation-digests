I am very new to this digest/cider making. My wife does not like beer(which
I brew) so I wish to brew something that we may both like.
Where do you guys get your apples? I'm thinking growers would be the best.
Does anyone know of a place to get apples to press in the Oregon/Washington
area? Thanks in advance.

Your first sentence, and your parenthetical last sentence contradict each
other badly!  If you are making a brew that you really like, why would you
think you are doing something wrong?  I may be in the minority but I think
the biggest part of any craft, whether brewing or anything else, is to
please yourself first!  Look at the swill that they call beer that is made
to appeal to the masses.  No body, no character, just a yellow beverage
designed to get frat boys drunk.


Your last sentence only proves that you are doing everything correctly!
Keep up the good work!


If you are looking for something a little less wine like, look into using
an ale yeast.  I use Wyeast European ale yeast.  Gives it a nice flavor.

This is only barely relevant to the digest, but...


Does anybody know of good sources for info on pears--varieties, tree
characteristics, etc.?  I'd be delighted to know about perry pears, but
I'd settle for finding some good, comprehensive sources on pears in
general.  I'd love to find a book that does for pears what Morgan/
Richards does for apples.


Also, some specific questions:  Does anyone have info on the pear varieties
Chanticleer, Cleveland, or Aristocrat?  A local nursery says they can
supply these, but I can't find info on them.

Tim- When you make your cider, what apples are you using?  The blend is
everything.  The astringent edge comes from apples with that edge in them.
We use a small amount of crabs and older bitter type apples.  Also, the
level of acidity influences the any tannin present in the cider.  Acid
seems to "propel" the tannin.  Our cider is fermented in barrels, so that
astringence is slightly "framed" by the influence of the oak at the end of
the palate.  When the apples are harvested can influence that too.
MacIntoshes harvested a litle prematurely can provide some pretty good
astringency, also.
Hope this helps

The astringent flavour comes from the bitter-sweet and bitter-sharp
cider apples used almost exclusively
in westcountry ciders such as Dunkertons

Tim,


IMHO if you like the cider that you are making then you are 
definately NOT doing anything wrong.  Whether or not it tastes like 
commercial cider it obviously IS what you like to drink, and, I 
presume, what your friends like as well.  You may want to experiment 
with other techniques that would give you a result more like some 
commercial ciders just to see if you like them also, but don't give 
up on the proven success of what you are doing now.
