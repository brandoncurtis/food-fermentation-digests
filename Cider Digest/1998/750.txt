There are plenty of sources for apples in Washington. Mostly table fruit,
but if you look around you can find more than just Delicious and Grannies.
Many of the orchards in the Wenatchee and Yakima Valleys are happy to sell
fruit "out the door" if you visit before they've sent everything to the
co-ops and other packers. If you ask for "cider fruit" or "culls" that may
not look perfect enough for the supermarkets, you can sometimes find mixed
varieties at a good price.


I've had good luck with two growsers in Peshastin (between Wenatchee and
Leavenworth): Riverbend Ranch  (9534 Saunders Road), and the big fruit
stand on the main highway just east of Leavenworth whose name I've forgotten.


West of the Cascade Range, your best bet is probably the Skagit Valley,
north of Seattle. Perkins Orchards in Sedro-Wooley has something like 250
different varieties.


For other growers, pick up the "fresh produce" maps that the various County
Extension Agents publish. 


Finding European-style high-tannin cider apples is more difficult. There
are a few growers playing with these, but their production is limited, and
most of it goes into their own cider.

The only time I went to an orchard to get juice, it was a disappointment.
They would only sell juice with potassium sorbate (preservatives) in it, 
so it was worthless to me.  Of course it was a big touristy outfit, with 
lots of people there to pick apples and buy things in their gift shop.


I've always just bought juice in markets (if I can find good tasting juice 
w/o preservatives).  My latest batch has 4 gallons of Whole Foods (CA natural 
food chain, which is known in NE as Bread and Circus) juice, with 3 cans of 
Senecca Farms Frozen Concentrate Granny Smith (to give it just a bit more of 
an edge).  It's still in the secondary, but initial tastes suggest that this 
could be my best batch ever.

Dick, 
Andrew Lea reported in Cider Digest 657 from April last year:
"The standard book on the subject is 'Perry Pears' by L C Luckwill and A
Pollard, published by the University of Bristol in 1963 and altho it ought
to be long out of print the nurserymen Scotts of Merriott , Somerset, TA16
5PL claimed to have copies in stock as recently as 1994!"


And I would say that perry pears are only second in relevance to the
cider digest after cider apples! They certainly belong here more than
anywhere else.

This doesn't really answer the question of where to find apples to press,
but I recently ran across a very good place to get sweet cider.
Lattin's Country Cider Mill and Farm, 9402 Rich Road S.E, Olympia, WA
98501 (360) 491-7328


Can't say how good a cider it will make yet.  I picked up 15 gallons of
sweet cider to try out with a couple of cider recipes.  The Cyser is about
ready to rack so hopefully I'll have some sort of idea how it may turn out
.... 


The cider is pretty impressive in and of itself, they press once a week.  
They receive weekly shipments of apples from Eastern Washington.  If
you've got a spare afternoon and are in the area I highly recommend a
visit to see the works.  You'll get your ear talked of but I think it's
worth it.

 It is by the beans of Java the thoughts acquire speed, 
 The hands acquire shaking, the shaking become a warning.

The Oregon/Washington area is fairly big, If you are south in Oregon,
check out the Hood River area, where there are orchards of Newtown
Pippins which I think might be a good start for a hard cider. The
Willamette Valley south of Portland should give you weekends of pleasant
searching.  North of Seattle in the Skagit and Whatcom  valleys you will
find the same, small orchards, many varieties. Go east to Yakima, Tri
Cities and Wenatchee and you will find a massive dessert apple culture.
Are these good for cider? hard to say, a challenge for you.  There are
some small pockets where true cider apples are grown,  seek them out.
Enjoy, this is beautiful country.
