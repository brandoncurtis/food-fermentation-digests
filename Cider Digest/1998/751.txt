Subject: Are Macintosh or Pippin Good Cider Apples?

I  have 5 apple trees which produce loads of apples in September/October.  They
look like Macintosh, Pippin, Yellow Delicious and a red one I can't identify.
Even If I could use some of these for cider, how could I press them?  I have
made many homebrews, so once I had the apple juice I could make cider with no
problem.

I make cider from juice I buy locally, but like to add some crab apple
juice to perk it up.  I'd like to plant a tree or two in my yard to supply
apples and be attractive ornamentals at the same time, but don't know what
variety to plant.  This is what I would like:  a tree that produces apples
about an inch or so in diameter, or a little less, with appropriate levels
of tannin and acidity, and which has a nice shape to it -- and by this I
mean a tree that has a spreading rather than an upright growing habit.
Does anybody know of such a tree, or a reference source that would help me
find one?
