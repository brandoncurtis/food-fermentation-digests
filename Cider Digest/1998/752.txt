I think Dolgo crab will satisfy most of those needs.  Growth habit depends
on various factors but pruning should help.

Have a look at the very comprehensive web site put up by Dr Gillian
Grafton of Birmingham University on: 


        <http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/GraftonG/cider/homepage.htm>.


There is a big section on perry and perry pears.

RE: Greg Schaem, regarding MacIntosh and Pippin apples


>From my research, both of these apples offer cider making potential. I
talked to packers in Watsonville, CA.  that said that they ship MacIntosh
apples to Texas for juicing purposes. Martinelli makes excellent juice with
about 40-50% Newtown Pippins from the Santa Cruz-Watsonville area. We
fermented some Marinelli's apple juice one time and it came out quite nice.


It is important to look for apples that have good acid and sugar levels as
well as flavor. Pippins offer this and some tannin.
