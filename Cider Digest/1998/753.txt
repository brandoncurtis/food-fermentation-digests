Hello ,


I made my first batch of cider and while it tastes good, there's no
carbonation (and there is supposed to be).  I let it sit for the amount
of time called for in the recipe.  Does anyone think this is salvageable
or should I just hope my next batch works out? It was suggested that
maybe if it sits longer, the carbonation might occur.


Thanks  


D.R. Ferron

Well, let me preface this with saying that I am a VERY inexperienced cider
maker (this is my first batch), and I'm not sure this is the place to ask
this as I may have made a wine instead of a cider for my first try.


I am making a 5 gallon batch, which I did the primary fermentation in a 6
gal fermentation bucket and then racked into a 5 gal carboy.  The juice was
made up of 5 qts of fresh apricot nectar and the rest of the 4.5 gallons was
a mix of Gravenstein and other apple juice.


The primary fermentation went well (it took only 4 days), and now it's in
the secondary fermentation stage and it's been about 8 days since I racked
it into the carboy.  I tried a bit of it this morning, and although it
tasted good, it had an off smell in it.  It was kind of like a natural
rubber smell, or a  slightly sulphery.  It definately came from the cider,
and was not the air in the secondary fermenter.  I was wondering if anyone
knew if that was normal.


The specifics:


Yeast: Pastuer Champagne yeast (Red Star I think?)
Starting Gravity: 1.075
End of first fermentation: 0.995


At this point I added 5 qts of Granny Smith apple juice to top it up to
about 2 inches below the top of the carboy, and it started spitting up like
it was going through primary fermentation again for about 2 days.  The
granny smith juice had a SG of 1.050.
