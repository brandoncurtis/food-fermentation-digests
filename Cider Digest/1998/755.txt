I had a batch (two carboys) which I didn't bottle for at least a year
(1996 apples).  The original yeast had settled so hard (or died, I don't
know which) that even with priming as described above, it never
carbonated.  Eventually I had to innoculate each bottle with some yeast
from a bottle of 1997 cider.  Now it's carbonating and tastes great. (It
tasted good flat, but better with fizz). 


I have found that cider can take up to 8 weeks to bottle condition
fully, unlike beer which is usually conditioned in about two weeks.

Some of you may be aware that HP Bulmer,
who own Inch's Cider of Winkleigh, Devon, have anounced
that they are to close Inch's down.


Bulmers only bought Inch's a couple of years ago, they have
made no real attempt to give wider distribution to Inchs ciders
and are now closing it altogether.
Inch's still make a range of distinctive and high quality traditional
Devon ciders, from genuine cider apples.
Bulmers concoct low quality, almost entirely keg 'ciders' from
apple concentrate, sugar, water and additives


Inchs are the last cider maker of significant size in Devon - only the
craft producers will remain if Inchs is closed.


If you care about quality ciders, please write and protest to:
HP Bulmer Ltd
The Cider Mills
Plough Lane
HEREFORD
HR4 0LE
UK


Thankyou.
