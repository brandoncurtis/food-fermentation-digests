Subject: Traditional Cider Varieties for Mid-Atlantic States?
From: Daniel Leep <leep@magpage.com>

Do the traditional English cider cultivars such as 'Kingston Black',
Dunston, Tremlett's Bitter, etc., produce a decent crop in the
mid-Atlantic states?  I'm considering planting several of these varieties
in Delaware.  But I  would be interested in others experience with them
before I start planting.


I read in Annie Proulx and Lewis Hill's book that in Colonial times, New
Jersey was reputed to produce fine ciders.  Does anyone know what
varieties might have been used?


I'm looking for apples suitable for 'vintage' ciders.  Alternatively I
might plant crabapples, perhaps 'Dolgo' as somebody previously suggested,
for use in blending.


Any other suggestions of high tannin, high acid apples suitable for 
Delaware's long, hot and muggy growing season would be appreciated.
Thanks.
