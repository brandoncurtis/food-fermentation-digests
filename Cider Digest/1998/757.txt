i have brewed beers for several years now but have recently been introduced to
ciders and love them. after talking to the owner of a local orchard in eastern
nebraska have been invited to come on pressing day and get 10 gallonsto be
divided among myself and a couple brewing friends . besides learning what
variety are in the mix does any one have suggestions?. we were thinking of
making 4 different types of 2.5 gallons usimng different yeasts. since it will
be 1-3 days after pressing to brew do we need to use sorbate or something to
kill wild yeast. ? a basic cider faq would probably help a lot. thanks in
advance for your help.    i especially liked the ones i tried in france if
that is any help. but can't recall specific names ect.

Hi, all!


I've been lurking the list for awhile now. It's always great to read your
questions and tips.


My question is this: does anyone know of a comprehensive list of commercial
cider producers in North America? Perhaps, I'm a masochist, but I'd like to
know what I'm missing!!! I'd like the list to contain Business Name, Product
Name(s), brief description(s), & cost(s), Press Master, Address, Phone Number,
and email/web address. If such a resource isn't out there, maybe I could build
one with some help of the list members. If such a list was a web site, one
could have a form for submitting new products. 


Short term, my goal is to have some information with which to go to my local
beer distributor and say "get this". 


Long term, this list might grow into a world-wide database of cider producers.
English, French, Australian, etc. Plus, I'd like to know some of the history
of these Presses. You know, "so-and-so was assistant to Mr. X for 5 years at
Thirsty Cider before he struck out on his own and started producing Wicked
Windfall..."


Does this sound interesting to anyone else?
