Best place to start is CiderSpace.  They may not have all the info you
want, but they have made the best attempt to get it.  They have been
working on this for a fair while...you should definitely start there rather
than trying to re-invent any part of the work.

RE: F. Snyder's commercial cider makers


Morgan Miller's Cider Space has a fairly comprehensive list of cidermakers.
As for our cider company, Rhyne Cyder, people may contact us at:


Attn: Bill Rhyne, Rhyne Cyder, PO Box 560, Sonoma, CA 95476,
1-510-235-6530(office) http://www.rhynecyder.com. Depending on your state's
regulations, out of state retail customers can order cider from the
Ravenswood Winery tasting room (1-707-938-1960)
http://www.ravenswood-wine.com. We are in 60 stores and restaurants in the
San Francisco Bay Area, such as Cost Plus World markets, Beverages & More,
Whole Foods, Oakville Grocery, Dean & De Luca, Postrio Restaurant, London
Wine Bar, Food For Thought, etc.
We are small scale in production at this time (1998-~1000 cases).
Another local company, California Cider Company, is ramping up and should
be available regionally, if not nationally, soon.


Good Luck!!

" we were thinking of
making 4 different types of 2.5 gallons usimng different yeasts. since it will
be 1-3 days after pressing to brew do we need to use sorbate or something to
kill wild yeast.    i especially liked the ones i tried in france if
that is any help. but can't recall specific names ect."


 For heaven's sake don't add sorbate!  If you do that you'll never get the
added yeasts to ferment!  Best thing is to add S02 instead to knock out
wild yeasts - about 50 - 100 parts per million.  Wait at least 24 hours and
then inoculate with what you want.  Or, if you like French cider, just add
50 ppm SO2, add an airlock, and.... wait.  The natural but benign yeasts
will eventually take over but it'll be 2 or 3 weeks before you may see any
sign of anything happening.  Then hopefully you'll get a nice slow
fermentation which will take a couple of months to finish in the cold.


Finally, forget all you know about beer and brewing!  Cidermaking is quite
different.  Get yourself a good winemaking book and follow that.  Cider
should take months to make, not days!!  Brewing concepts are not helpful
here!

the US!!

WOODPECKER CIDER GROUP UNCORKS WOODCHUCK DEAL


Friday, 7 th August 1998


Strongbow and Woodpecker cider maker HP Bulmer is expanding in the US with
the takeover of the Green Mountain Cidery (corr) company.


Bulmer, which has faced falling profits at home as the cider industry has
been squeezed by competition from cheap imported lagers, is paying 14.4
million dollars (L 38.7 million) for Green Mountain.


Woodpecker and Strongbow are already popular with American drinkers and
have a 9% share of the fast-growing US cider market.


But Green Mountain, which is based in Vermont and makes high quality cider
under the Woodchuck brand name, will give Hereford-based Bulmer a much
bigger presence in the US.


Woodchuck's 17% market share will be added to the Woodpecker and Strongbow
sales and the new owners plan a big investment programme for the business.


Last year, Green Mountain made a profit of L 381,000 on sales of L 34.7
million.


Bulmer chief executive Mike Hughes said: ``We are committed to expanding
our international business which, with brand distribution in over 50
countries and manufacturing operations in Europe and Australasia, currently
accounts for over 20% of group profit.


``This acquisition creates a step change in Bulmer's presence in the fast-
growing cider segment of the US long alcoholic drinks market.''


Last month Bulmer reported a 26% fall in annual profits, down from L 330
million to L 322 million, and the closure of its two Inchs' Cider plants in
Devon.

Greeetings cidermakers,
  I am back with the further info on the varieties of cider apples and perry
pears available from the Cider Hill Nursery. 
  Cider apples include: Breakwell Seedling, Bulmer's Norman, Chisel Jersey,
Coat Jersey, Crimson King, Dabinette, Dymock Red, Ellis bitter, Foxwhelp,
Golden Russet, Harrison, Harry Master's Jersey, Herefordshire Red Streak,
Kingston Black, Magog Red Streak, Medaille d'Or, Muscat de Bernay, Muscat
de Deippe, Porter's Perfection, Spitzenberg, Sweet Alford, Sweet Coppin,
Taylor's, Tremblit's Bitter, Virginia Crab, Wild Apple, and Yarlington
Mill.
  Perry Pears include: Barrland,  Barnet, Blakeney Red, Brandy, Butt,
Gelbmostler, gin, Hendre Huffcap, Normannischen Ciderbirne, Red Horse,
Romania Perry, Tayton Squash, Thorn, Winnals Longdon, Yellow Huffcap.


  All are one year whips at $12 each plus 15% for boxing and shipping.
Various rootstocks. Minimum order 6 trees.  They will also do graft, grow
and deliver trees for the following year as a special order. They have a
number of other varieties available for custom grafting and are willing to
use scion wood from other sources.
  Is there a good source of information on these varieties? After all there
is more to variety selection than the fruit itself. We all have things we
would like in a tree such as disease resistance(fireblight?), ease of care,
bearing habit, etc. Does anyone have experience with these trees?
