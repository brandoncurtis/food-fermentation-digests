Cidermakers:


As a wannabe, I recently purchased 5 acres of irrigated land in 
southwest Utah and plan on establishing an cider apple orchard on at 
least one acre; at 5000+ ft above sea level.  Any feedback on the tree 
types good for that area?  What is the address for infamous "Cider Hill 
Nursery?" And is anyone aware of a good nursery in Utah that I can buy 
stock from?  Thanks...ww

After having to toss out my last batch, I started a new batch.


I found that a local Whole Foods had an organic juice that was a store
brand.  I bought 5 gallons.  I also purchased 5 cans of frozen concentrate.
Got home and put the entire concoction together and cam up with a starting
gravity of about 1.053.   I added Wyeast european ale yeast and let it go.
I never got the huge foamy head that I have experienced in the past.  The
head would get about 2 inches, and then drop, then back up and then down
again.  I let it sit in the primary for 9 days.  When I transfered to the
secondary I took another reading and got a gravity of 1.000.  I had
fermented it out entirely in about a week.  I made a trip back to whole
foods and bought more concentrate.  I sorbated the brew and dumped in some
citric acid to keep it from going brown.  I added the concentrate and
brought it up to 1.030.  Nice and sweet.  I got 48 12oz bottles and about
1/2 gallon.  The bottles are doing great, the bottom has a layer of
sediment, and the solids are settling nicely.  The 1/2 gallon is in the
fridge being 'sampled' almost daily.  I am hoping that the bottles will
settle out in about 3 or 4 weeks.  It is probably the strongest brew I have
done.  If the hydrometer can be trusted, this batch is about 8% alcohol.

Hello folks,
  I had the good fortune to sample some commercial apple beverages. The one
I have a question about was called "Wild Country Cider" and was labeled as
being from Normandy. My guess is that this is not tremendously
representative of the style. It was carbonated and sweet in the finish. I
did not notice any tannins in the finish. There was little acidity either.
As you can tell, I was not impressed.
  I was much more impressed with some ciders I tasted at the Wisconsin state
fair. Bayfield Winery had a raspberry hard cider that was quite nice albeit
at a hefty ABV of 10%. They also had a apple wine. That was quite nice
also.  I have also managed to obtain a bottle of cyser from White Winter
Winery in Iron River, WI. But haven't had a chance to try it. Their website
is     www.WhiteWinter.com

Greetings,
  I have done some research into Perry pears. From the characteristics I can
find on these It seems that one of the best pears for perry would be Rock  
AKA  Brown Huffcap. I don't seem to be able to find this variety. Any
suggestions? How about English sources? Are import restrictions impossible
or just difficult ? There seems to be little on their growth
characteristics either.
        Dave
