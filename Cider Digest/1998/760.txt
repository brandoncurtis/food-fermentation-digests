Perry Makers,
  I am planning on adding a couple of perry pears to my orchard. I have 2
varieties of dessert pears already and plan to use them for base. Does
anyone know which of the varieties I mentioned in my previous post might be
the best? There seems to be no guidelines about how best to use sharps and
bittersharps in
perry. Would you use them as you blend cider apples?(10-20% tart, 5-20%
astringent, 10-20% aromatic and the rest as base/neutral). Butt also sounds
interesting as one of 2 Bittersharps in the available varieties.I have
already devoured the info on the Real Cider and Perry page. One thing that
bothers me about the info there is that they mention that a high citric
acid content lends itself to acetification. Yet some of the more highly
rated perry pears (like Gin, Taynton Squash and Yellow Huffcap) are high in
it. Do you think it would be good to ask some of the commercial perry
makers about variety selection? A lot of the smaller breweries can be very
helpful. I guess it can't hurt to ask. To return to my earlier comments
about Rock one of my correspondent quoted from Luckwill and Pollard's
"Perry Pears", it is said of Rock : "medium acid, very high tannin,
extremely astringent and alcoholic, good to excellent quality, specific
gravity of juice may be over 1100." I was wondering if this pear might work
best as part of a blend even though it is rated as having "excellent"
vintage quality. I was also wondering if it might work as part of a cider
blend, would it then still be cider? I am still looking for a source. I am
looking for comments to help me decide if it is worth the effort. 
  
I welcome any comments,
Dave

Greetings,
  I got my list of perry pears from Brogdale. Rock is not there. The pears
that are there that are not included on the NCGR list are: Green Horse,
Hellen's Early, Judge Amphlett, Moorcroft, Oldfield, Parsonage, Sweet
Huffcap, and Wassenbirne. Does anyone have info on any of these varieties 
other than what is on the Real Cider and Perry page? The most interesting
sound like Moorcroft, Oldfield, and Parsonage. Wassenbirne is kind of a
neat name. I think my wife is lucky that we aren't having any more children.
  If you are interested, I downloaded their list of cider apples. The
catalog is available on their website at
         http://www.nfc.u-net.com


  It looks like I am not going to be able to find "Rock" preserved anywhere.
I will try not to get petrified over it.
        Dave

Where is the Cider Hill Nursery?  It sounds like they have some really
interesting cider stock. I have been trying to bring in some Crimson
King and Major stock  from Brogsdale(UK) with no success. I am finding
it difficult get the source certified through an export  agency
authorized by USDA  with a post entry quarantine permit.  Has anyone had
any experience with this? I have been corresponding with Horticultural
Research International, East Malling, Kent with no success.

Cidermakers,
  This may quickly be assigned to my growing list of less-than brilliant
questions. I have been looking at adding some trees to my orchard. Some
varieties have been described as particularly prone to scab (this includes
both pears and apples). Is this a problem for the vitality of the tree or
for fruit destined for the crusher? I am not sure that it would make much
difference to me if the fruit just looked bad. 
        Dave

I've expanded my Cidermaking Web Site in the last few weeks and I've now
added three new pages which describe my own orchard, my own milling and
pressing, and my own fermentation and storage - OK I know this sounds like
blowing my own trumpet but I thought these things might be a help to others
who are going down the same road.  I'm not in it commercially so I'm happy
to tell people what I do, particularly if other small scale cidermakers
with their own web sites are doing likewise (yes there do seem to be one or
two)!
