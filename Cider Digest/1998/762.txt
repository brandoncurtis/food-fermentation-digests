I have subscribed to Cider Digest for a little while and now is my first 
time to make a contribution.  To introduce myself, I am based at the ADAS 
Rosemaund Research Centre, about 6 miles from Hereford, England.  We conduct 
research on cider pomology funded by the cider industry and growers (through 
the National Association of Cider Makers), although at present our funding 
is quite limited (we are not on the same scale as Long Ashton Research 
Station used to be!).  ADAS is a private limited company, although we were 
owned by government until privatisation in 1997.


On the subject of scab, as raised by Andrew Lea in Digest #761(Hello Andrew, 
nice to hear from you in a different context!), the main reason for 
controlling it in commercial cider orchards is that it reduces yield.  Some 
work by the Field Officer of the NACM, Liz Copas, proved that some years 
ago.  I agree that its cosmetic effect is not important.


The question of sourcing cider apple trees has also been raised.  Whilst it 
is true that the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale hold many varieties, 
I believe that Bulmers in Hereford have a larger collection.  They may be 
able to supply outside of the UK, subject to the usual plant health 
licensing restrictions.

Subject: Buying Cider Apples in the UK.

Can anyone recommend a source to buy a few sackfuls of cider apples in the
UK? This is for a beginner to experiment in the art of cider-making, after
a prolonged tour of various web sites and public libraries for information
on the subject, it is time to put the theory into action.  I guess I havea
fairly sweet tooth, I've just had a bottle of Thatchers Dabinett, which I
much preferred to the dryer Kingston Black. So anywhere I could get hold of
some bittersweets would be useful.


Also, I planted some Dabinett(e?) trees on M9 rootstock in my
'mini-orchard' last year, along with Taunton Maid, Ten Commandments and
Crimson Victoria which I all got from Brogdale. Realistically, is M9 too
small for a decent crop? I was trying to cram as much as possible into a
small area. I read with interest Andrew Lea's details of his orchard, where
I beieve he used MM106 (although judging by his measurements he planted
more wisely than I did) which I imagine are both more vigorous and heavier
croppers.


I intend to plant a few more trees this autumn, are there any 'rule of
thumb' metrics on crops from various rootstocks? eg 1*M26 = 2*MM106=3*M9 as
a wild and inaccurate guess?

Cidermasters,
Below is some correspondence I recieved while looking for a source for
perry pears. I thought it would be of interest to others here. I had asked
about sources of perry pears and comments on why certain varieties might
not be available.

Glad to hear you are interested in decent cider - not the industrialised!
Your best source of apple trees is Bulmers Orcharding Division, Plough
Lane, Hereford, UK.  They also sell Perry Pears.  Most of the old varieties
are available.  The reason why varieties might go out of favour is that
they do not produce enough fruit which makes them commercially unviable.


I suggest Moorcroft and Thorne - other varieties might be equally as good
but they may not be grown in our area, so I have no knowledge of them.
With regard to apples, I know Kingston Black do well in New England and
they are the best.  There are so many useful types - Foxwhelp, White
Norman, Darbinett, Sweet Coppin, Sherrington Norman, Strawberry Norman,
Yarlington Mill and so on............
Good Luck

Does anyone have information about cider contests? I am familiar with
only the American Homebrewing Association's, and am looking for more.
Are there any that are especially good and qualified to judge? If not,
who wants to start one? Lots of good cider to drink! It would be a
tremendous help to the art of cidermaking!
