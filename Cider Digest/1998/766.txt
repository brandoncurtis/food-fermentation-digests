The American Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has issued 
some new regulations on sweet cider due to the concern about 
harmful bacteria in unpastuerized apple cider.  This raises 
a couple of questions about fermented cider.


1.  Does fermentation negate harmful bacteria?


2. Does fermented cider have to be pastuerized to be sold 
commercially in the U.S.?


3. Does the FDA or the Bureau of Tabacco & Firearms
regulate fermented cider sales in the U.S.?

This last weekend I drove about 20 miles to a roadside stand that had been
selling unpasturized cider with no preservatives.  Unfortunately, they had
switched to pasturized cider with 1/10th of 1% benzoate of soda.  Since I was
there, I went ahead and bought 5 gallons.  I added about 2 lbs of honey which
brought the OG to about 1.060 and added a little bit of lactic acid and grape
tannin.  I then pitched cotes de blanc yeast, waited about 36 hours and had no
activity.  So I pitched some Edme yeast, which in my experience can live
through damn near anything.  Still no activity.  I have just made a starter
from 100% pure apple juice with no preservatives and plan to build that up to
about a liter and then pitch.


Any other ideas?  Should I just start giving away very sweet cider to all my
friends?  Does anyone else have experience with preservatives in cider?

Rod,
         I have already sent the copy back to the NAFEX library. It was not the
actual book, but a photocopy of the original. I can certainly understand
that they wouldn't risk sending out the original. Because it was a copy, I
didn't have a page with a publisher. All I have is that it was published in
1886. The full title was "Apple and Pear as Vintage Fruit" by Hogg & Bull.
I believe that a lot of the information from the Real Cider and Perry Page
came from this.  I suspect copies would be hard to come by.
