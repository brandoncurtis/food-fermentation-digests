I, too, waded through the new proposed regulation, and I sent the
following as comment:

I was assured by way of a response that my comments were filed and will
be reviewed when they revise the reg for final issue. Good idea to
respond now, and thank for your work, Mike, in getting all of that sent
off!


Good cider is worth fighting for.

And what happens in a good year with a lot of fruit sugars when the alcohol
content goes over 7%? My most recent cider was made with a variety of cider
apples, dessert apples and crabs, after a hot  and dry summer (quite a bit
of fruit sugar, I don't have the original SG to hand) , and when fermented
to zero resulted in a 9.something % cider. Presumably any smaller producers
of vintage ciders are going to have to dilute their product to meet the tax
office definition!
