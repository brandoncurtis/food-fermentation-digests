We have that problem in England, where some ciders (particularly
Kingston Blacks and those matured in fresh rum or whisky casks)
can come out well over the 8.5% limit we have.  The maker has to
then either water it down or break the law (or pay duty as for wine which
is massively higher).  A similar line also exists at 7%, above which the
duty is charged at a higher rate.

David Johnson lamented in Digest #768...


>there was a thin layer of white material on the surface
and no activity through the blow off tube. I thought it was mold, but since
I didn't have time to clean it up, I left it for a few days.  Now there is
slow activity from the tube.<


I think this is a film yeast, especially if it's at all powdery flaky or
waxy - unusual to get it coming  in to a must before the fermenting yeast,
but these things do happen.Yes it's a wild yeast but no, not the sort you
want at this stage.  Suggest abandoning this attempt at a 'natural'
fermentation, and now just pitch in an active wine yeast starter and let it
go.  You'll not get what you were aiming for, but you should save 5 gallons
of perfectly good juice as it converts into 5 gallons of dry cider.  Film
yeasts are slow to spoil and I would guess no lasting damage will be done
if you act now!

I'm a relatively newbie brewer ( 4 batches of beer done and 9 meads
underway) and
was wondering if anybody knew of a neutral-flavored yeast with low alcohol
tolerance
that might be good for making ciders ?   By low I'm talking about 4.5-9%

Subject: Pressing questions

Hello everyone!  Thanks for the excellent and often lively discussions 
of the fine apple and its' nectar...they have been very illuminating and 
useful for my plans...


Unfortunately, I live in South Florida, where no self-respecting apple 
grows...We down here must make due with imported domestic apples like 
Braeburn, Macintosh, Granny Smith and the like...and worse...there is no 
cider that doesn't have the additives and preservatives in it when 
sold...Of course, there is the Florida Apple- the orange, but it just 
isn't the same....


So I was wondering...I've used Seneca's Granny Smith juice to make a 
respectable apple cider, but I'd like to increase the flavour and aroma 
complexities as much as possible.  A few weeks ago, I purchased an 
antique "berry press"- a cast iron press capable of holding about a 
gallon of fruit and pressing with a metal screw in a galvanized steel 
hopper.  It is incredibly strong and sturdy (yet old- dates to the 
20's).


My question then is, how much juice yield will I get from a couple of 
pounds of apples at a time?  Is there a good apple to use for good 
cider- especially one that is not too expensive?  And if I use a base of 
the Seneca juice and blend it with the pressed juice, what can I expect 
from the final product? Also, as my intention is to produce a five 
gallon batch...are there pressing procedures that you would advise I 
follow?




Thanks from any who has answers, I appreciate the time and knowledge!

Agreed.
The definition really could have been made a lot more generous--say 10% abv
limit--as long as it doesn't permit any "boosting" of the strength.  In
other words, you can't go adding sugar, fructose syrup, white grape juice,
etc.  As long as the starting ingredient is apple juice, period, a limit on
alcohol content is almost academic.


There is a slightly sticky other side to this, though:  I've heard that in
a bad year, producers add sugar to the must just to get the alcohol up to
a reasonable level for a stable product.  If you want to allow this, so
that producers don't end up shutting down for a year if they can't get
apples with enough natural sugar, it adds more complication.  You don't
want to do anything that would encourage producing the "rocket fuel" high-
alcohol barely-apple ciders.  Maybe the law could allow as much as 10% for
fully-natural ciders (made only with apple juice, *nothing* else), and 5-6%
for ciders made with added sugars.
