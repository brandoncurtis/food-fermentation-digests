RE: Leo Demski's questions about apples in Florida and press yields.


Leo may want to try the Braeburns/MacIntosh/Granny Smith apples and see
what kind of results that he gets. Gallo's Hornsby is made of 85% Granny
Smith and 15% Gala according to a local sales representative. The main
thing isto have enough acid (~5grams/liter), low pH (~3.8), and sugar for
the basic components to make a drinkable and safe cider. I have been eating
Braeburns recently and they taste very good--fairly acidic and sweet. I
haven't fermented them though.


As for press yields, I would plan on 100lbs of apples to fill a 5 gallon
carboy. Commercial presses have higher yields but a handcrank may give
possibly a purer yield because it doesn't press as hard.

If you're interested, the Great Lakes Radio Consortium interviewed Black
& Fagan Cider Co for a story airing this week, and you can hear it from
their web site if you have the right doohickies operating on your
computer. The site is www.glrc.org. Click on Listen to GLRC, then it is
the second story on the list.


After the interview, Ms. Nelson stayed and had a private tank tasting.
She is now a cider lover!

Cider makers,
  Thanks to those who were able to give me help with my yeast problem.
Shortly after I posted here, I noticed that the layer I was discussing
seemed to be a beige color and as activity picked up it appeared to be
carried up with the CO2 that was beginning to be generated. Before activity
got to the point that it broke it up, I racked to another carboy from under
this "Chapeau Beige". I probably should have said somewhere in here  that I
was conducting my initial fermentation in a 6.5 gal(US) carboy, so there
was quite a bit of surface area. The second carboy was 5 gal. In this
vessel the cider came right up to the neck. I intended to pitch a healthy
culture of wine yeast(a "killer" strain), but having none on hand had to
order some. The nearest shop to me is 50 miles away, so I ordered some.
While I was waiting, fermentation picked up to the point that I had to
re-place the blow off tube because it was so vigorous. At this point,
fermentation appears much more what I am used to. What I smell is similar
to what I have smelled with wine yeasts... fruitiness with a little sulfur.
I checked th gravity today and it was down to 1.023. The top layer has not
reformed. I feel a little more comfortable. I seems to taste OK. I intend
to let it ferment out now. Is there anything special I should do at
bottling? I probably will bottle this sparkling.
  I read somewhere that Golden Russet is a bittersweet. Of course I can no
longer find the reference. Has there ever been any kind of effort to
classify American varieties on a more objective basis as the British have
done? Reading the American literature is difficult because one quickly
loses whether they are discussing sweet or hard cider.
  Today, I pressed some apples. I had one bushel each of russet and winesap.
>From this I got 4.5 gal. of juice. OG was 1.064, pH 3.6, acidity .55-.6%. I
used 5 campden tabs and plan on using D47 for yeast. As I was pressing, I
though about something I read in a cider text that suggested leaving the
pomace under pressure for a long time. Being "pressed" for time, I left the
pressure on for only 20 mins. each. What would the reason be for this
advice? better extraction? Or is there some flavor components that require
a long time under pressure to extract?
        Dave
