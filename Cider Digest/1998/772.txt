RE: David Johnson's questions about pomace under pressure for a length of time.


This concept in not familiar to me but the concept of letting pomace sit
covered for a while (6-8 hours) before pressing allows for maceration of
the pomace. Cell walls breakdown, juice is let loose, and flavors are mixed
together so that when you press, you get better yield and better flavor.
Temperature needs to be low so that the stuff doesn't start fermenting
before pressing. We experimented with this process at different lengths--6
hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours. Although we did not do a thorough scientific
evaluation, our general impressions were that 6 -8 hours was an optimum
time for our situation. It adds  more handling to the process so technique
needs to be clean. This is very time consuming though so most of the large
scale manufacturers do not do this. At wineries in No. Cal. though, grapes
are left in bins after being crushed to extract the flavor from the skin of
the grape. Cellar workers "punch the cap" to stir up the mix, eventually
the stuff is pressed so juice is separated from the the skins. Wine grapes
ferment to higher alcohol levels than apples so the high alcohol level
kills many bacteria that might cause a problem in lower alcohol levels,
such as cider juice.


It comes down to time, space, equipment, raw material, labor, money
constraints, and flavor goals to suggest how far you  may want to take your
process.


Good luck!!

A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting our Digest Janitor, Dick
Dunn, and his wife when they visited Andrew Lea at his home in
Oxfordshire.  We talked a lot about cider, a little about computers, and
enjoyed an excellent lunch provided by Andrew's wife Jo. 


Not only did we talk cider, we (naturally) drank some. I provided some
of my 1997 Royal County dry, which received complimentary remarks from
such acknowledged experts, and we sampled two of Andrew's excellent
products.


It was good to put a face to an anonymous e-mail contact, and I trust,
Dick, that you and your party had an enjoyable time in Britain.


As they say in Scotland, 'Haste ye back'.

I've been making hard apple cider for a couple of years and just had a
chance to try a perry made bythe Nashoba Winery in MA.  Wow!  I immediately
wanted to try making one for myself but I can't find bulk pear juice for
the homebrewer.  I could get a 50-gallon drum from a commercial supplier or
pay $2 per quart at a natural foods grocery store.  What do most people
do, press their own?  Can anyone help me out here?


Thanks
Jeff
