I just purchased a couple of gallons of raw, no-preservatives-added
cider from our local apple growing area (Oak Glen, California).  I thad
started ferment when I had purchased it.  I currently have them stashed
in the back of our fridge.  I keep our fridge in the 33 degree F range
and these jugs are working away still, at that very cold temperature.  I
burp them every couple of days--real scientific, eh?  They taste great! 
Not much discernable alcohol, but the flavor is balanced, and is one
that I really like.


I bake bread and have found that long, cool to cold fermentations of the
bread dough turns out a superior product in the loaves, which have
wonderful flavor and keeping qualities.  I am guessing that the cold
fermentation of ciders has the same effect on flavors, preserving the
"appleness" of the juice.

I am a Master Food Preserver with our local Cooperative Extension
office.  We are given, as a very handy tool upon graduation, a roll of
pH paper in the 3.0 to 5.5 pH range--they have other ranges also, I am
assuming.  It is called pHydrion Paper and is made by  Micro Essentioa
Laboratory Inc., 4224 Avenue H, Brooklyn, New York  11210.  You can
write them for a catalog.  My container says they specialize in pH
products.  This is nice stuff, very handy for canning--should be handy
for brewing also.

The requirement for cidermaking is to be able to measure pH to at least 0.1
unit over the range pH 2.8 - 4.5.  I''ve never seen any pH strip
(colorimetric) indicators which would give this level of accuracy.  But
there are now plenty of cheap pH meter 'sticks' which are available from
laboratory supply houses for about GBP 30.  Since these are all made in low
labour-cost countries in the Far East I would imagine the US prices would
be < $50. The one I have was made by Hanna in Mauritius.  You can buy soil
pH meters even cheaper in gardening stores but they are far too
insensitive.  If you want to economise on the calibration buffers you can
miss out on the pH 7 one and just do the pH 4 since this is close to the pH
of interest.  That's what I do.  A Laboratory Quality Systems Manager would
have a fit but do I care?

The following message was posted to the Homebrew Digest. I'm posting
it here (JudgeNet, Cider-Digest, Mead-Digest) in order to spread the
information as far as possible, since many people might be interested
in this that don't read the HBD. Note that the AHA does include cider
and mead categories in its annual competition, and articles on cider,
mead and judging are printed often in Zymurgy.

Ladies and Gentlemen:


        The American Homebrewers Association's Board of Advisors
(BOA) has an open seat that we'd like to fill. In order to fill this
opening on the board, the existing board will nominate a slate of
three to five people as candidates for an election by the general
membership, the first time that the general membership would be
so involved. Anybody on the board nominating a candidate will be
prepared to champion that candidate, telling the rest of the BOA
why their nominee is to be considered for nomination.  The BOA
will discuss the potential candidates among ourselves and decide
on a final slate. This final slate will be submitted to the general
membership for a vote early in 1999.


        Nominated candidates will be asked to confirm in writing
that they want to be candidates. They will also be asked to write
something to be posted on the AHA website about why they should be
members of the board. Although any AHA member can be considered for
the BOA, we need representation in certain areas of the country. We
expect geography to be a significant factor for this vote.


        Although the AHA members-only website will be the forum
for the election, we will post notices to other beer-related Internet
sites that this is going on and that members should visit the site
regularly for an update.  Nominees and voters must all be AHA members
in good standing. We will ask in our postings that individuals and
clubs share this information with members who are not computer savvy
and don't have access to the Internet.  Those members can ask for
help from another member who is good on computers or, if they can
handle a computer but just don't have one, they can use the PC's
located in many public libraries to access the AHA website.


        A postcard ballot will be included in an issue of
Zymurgy. Voters can pick their choice, sign the ballot (security in
case ballots get stolen. Who votes for who will not be published.),
put a stamp on the card and send it in. I will count the ballots,
or if the BOA prefers, and if someone else on the BOA wishes to
volunteer, we'll send the ballots to them. The person receiving the
most votes wins and, if the process is completed in time, will be
sworn in at the next national conference meeting, in Kansas City.


        IN THE FUTURE, we will develop a way to take nominations
from the general membership. This process is evolutionary. We will
learn from this first vote (or maybe the first few votes will
be handled this way) and make sure that the voting system works
well. Then we add on a method to get nominations from the general
membership.


        Please refer to the Board of Advisors by-laws at the AHA
website: http://dionysus.aob.org/members/ahabylaws.htm


I wish everybody good health and good cheer!
Ed Busch
Co-chairman, AHA Board of Advisors

I may have been over hasty in my earlier remarks about simple methods for
measuring pH.  It seems that narrow range pH papers and indicators ARE
available, at least in England, from the Merck Co (formerly BDH Ltd).  I'll
check these out and report back!!
