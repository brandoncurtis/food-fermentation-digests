Subject: Preserving wild yeast culture

    This year our family bought a
farm that has dozens of naturally plant apple trees. Most did not set
fruit well as they have not been tended but one did very well and
resulted in about 6 bushels. We built a press and crusher from idea's we
gather from the Cider Digest and Gillians Grafton's web site. I must say
that I was quite pleased with its performance . We let the apples sit in
a cool corner of our drive shed for 3 weeks before  pressing , resulting
in 5 to 6 gallons of very aromatic juice . Wild yeast fermentation
seemed an interesting change from our past brew experiences and after 50
days,  we are now ready to bottle. My question is, since we are are so
pleased with our results is there a way to preserve the wild yeast
culture .                                                 Thanks, Larry

Besides making cider, I also enjoy collecting cider 
advertising.  I have some old glasses from the Clarksville
Cider Co., St. Louis, Mo.  The glasses are thick 
glass with a stemmed base and hold a little less than
4 ounzes.  Does anyone have any historical information
on this company?

I would also like to trade cider coasters (mats) to improve my 
collection of more than 380 different world cider coasters.

Hi there,


can anybody tell at how many degrees minus Cider with an alcohol content of 6 
persent start freezing. I couldn't find any formula or advice. Can you?
Thanks, Knut

(in context of earlier posting about HVR press basket strap weld failing...)


I had pulled the apple grinder off my Happy Valley Ranch press for end-of-
season maintenance.  On remounting it (a chore because it requires deforming
the heavy mounting brackets by tightening mounting bolts) I sheared one of
the mounting bolts, and a second was about to go.  No, I didn't gorilla the
bolts, but I do insist anything that heavy with moving parts be securely
anchored.  Judgment:  under-design again.  I replaced them with SS.


"Freedom of the press belongs to the person who owns one"...but right now
I'm feeling somewhat enslaved, thank you very much.

Magunda@aol.com asks:
> Can I copy archives of the Cider Digest? Please advise. Thank you.


Depends on what you mean by "copy".  If you want to make a copy for your
own personal use--e.g., copy from the archive to a local disk or some
such--there is little that anyone can object.  However, if you want to make
copies for distribution to others, especially for remuneration (whether or
not it comes down to "profit") then it's a very different matter.


What it comes down to is this:  Every person who writes an article for the
Digest owns the copyright in that article.  (An explicit copyright notice
is not required--Berne Convention.)  By the same token, the Digest itself
holds a collection copyright on the digests.  There is an obvious right of
distribution granted as far as sending the digests to subscribers, and to
archiving at the designated archival site and retrieval from it.  Beyond
that, it is very touchy, and in practice the issue is that anything which
would arouse the ire of the copyright holders will put you in trouble.


There are, to be sure, some murky areas in the copyright status of articles
due to the initial distribution mechanisms.  The Right Way to resolve the
issue is to consult with everyone involved and ask permission if you're
going to try to do something akin to redistribution.  If you do otherwise,
you may coast along just fine or you may find yourself in a hornet's nest
of legal complications (and not in the role of the hornet:-)

With the interest expressed lately concerning pH measurement
let me contribute the following which was recently posted to the

Subject:        Tip:  Use of pH Meter during Acid Testing!
From:   "NomDeNette" <ZenKoan@hotmail.com>
Date:   Sun, 22 Nov 1998 20:11:38 -0500


Hi All:


I just picked-up this outstanding tip from the Spagnol's web sight.  I have
never seen it mentioned on our ng...


"There is one other great use for a pH meter and it relates to the acid
testing kit. If you measure the pH of the wine being tested, it will be
exactly 8.2 when the colour change occurs. Instead of watching for the
colour change, dip the probe into the solution, keep feeding in sodium
hydroxide until the pH meter reads 8.2. Then stop and figure out how much is
gone from the syringe. Voila, you have your titratable acidity, ready to be
recorded in your by now bulging notebook. "


WHAT A GOD SEND FOR THOSE OF US WITH A METER!  Especially for testing reds,
where the color change is so hard to determine.  Now;  No more guess work!


BTW; wanting to see how this worked with a red, I just tried this method on
some of the just released 1998 Georges Duboeuf Beaujolais Nouveau.  I ran
the test three times and got IDENTICAL results all three times. (FYI: TA =
.62% and pH = 3.46).


Finally; please note that it is important to have a very accurate pH meter
(to within +/- .01 pH) if you are going to use it for this purpose since the
juice's pH rises drastically & rapidly  as you approach the end-point.
Moreover; a very accurate meter is also required for determining sulphite
additions.


In other words; it is not recommended to invest any money in a meter which
has an accuracy of less than +/-01 pH.


For the complete Spagnols text regarding this tip, please see:

Hope this was helpful.

I acid test fresh juice using an inexpensive titration kit
and then balance the acid usually adding malic acid to
obtain a content similar to white grape must, 0.65%.
This consistantly produces a nice tartness in the finished
cider.
