With meticulous care I pressed some Granny Smith apples and sulfited with 150
PPM per gallon. I added Pasteur Champagne yeast into a sterile carboy. A
couple of days later the juice turned milky and a white froth formed. The
smell at first was yeasty and then it changed to more of a sulfury(H2S)
stench. The apples may have had wax on them because I bought them late in the
season from a natural food outlet. Anyone know the diagnosis and treatment?
Thanks a ton. Matt Merliss.
