"Black Cider" huh? I feel a lawsuit coming on . . . It would be a
combination civil suit (name use) and a tort (assault on innocent
consumers' tastebuds). 


Back in my own corporate marketing days, this is the kind of product
strategy hooey we would revert to when we didn't know what we were
doing. Invent a product category, then declare victory over it. It's
quite shameless. It helps if the product subcategory nicely relates to
the difficiencies of your cheapest-to-manufacture item ("New Burnt
Carmel Flavored Cider! Made Exclusively From Our Special Imported
Concentrate!")


Even if this is some long lost super-double-dog-dare cider sub-category,
which only the $ of Koch could afford to resurrect, what difference does
it make IF IT'S NO GOOD?!


BTW, you should have seen my FIRST reply. My wife made me delete it.

The Cider Digest finishes this year with 525 subscribers.  This is off a
bit from what it had been (close to 550 a couple times this year).  There
were 69 issues this year.  The number of issues and the total size are both
down a bit from last year.  I suspect that some of this is due to the
erratic/slow publication this fall.


The size of the list--just over 500--seems small to me.  It's about half
the size of the Mead-Lover's Digest, which in turn is a tiny fraction of
the size of the Homebrew Digest.
