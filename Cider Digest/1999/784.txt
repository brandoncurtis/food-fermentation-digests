Hi all,


I found a site on the web that sells/ships White Oak cider. White Oak is a 
Newburg, Oregon based cidery that makes traditional English Farmhouse 
cider. 


Cidermaker Alan Foster grows 80 varieties of Cider apples on his 10 acre 
farm. This is one of my favorite ciders and is as good as any traditional 
English cider I've had.


The URL is:

Cheers!

Not sure how many people have woken up to this one, but Matthew Clark (the
second biggest UK cidermaker and holders of brand names like Taunton
Blackthorn, Showerings K, Gaymers Old English, Coates Somerset etc etc.)
are now being taken over by Canandaigua winery from upstate New York.
Remember, Bulmers from the UK now own Green Mountain (Woodchuck) in the US.
 So we have an interesting situation of reverse holdings in both countries!
 Will be fascinating to see what Canandaigua do in the UK.  They have no
exposure here at present, and may perhaps use Matthew Clark as a
distribution chain for their products.  Likewise, will they start to market
UK cider in the US?

We had something like that trying to establish in the market a few years
ago (though I never saw any).  It was highly coloured (of course all UK
commercial ciders are artificially coloured anyway, but this was much more
so).  It looked like a dark beer, so eventually the Customs and Excise
stepped in and forced the UK National Association of Cidermakers to define
a maximum colour for cider in analytical terms.  It certaintly had no
traditional counterpart but it bombed so far as I know anyway.


Re cider sweetening (in Digest a couple of issues back):


1.  You can use aspartame but it's not stable in ciders.  It slowly
hydrolyses so after weeks or months in store it will lose its sweetness
(the same thing happens in soft drinks but nobody keeps them, for long).


2.  Pasteurising sweetened carbonated cider in bottle works fine (as Bill
Rhyne does it) but beware of the risk of exploding or cracking bottles if
you do it on a domestic scale. We did it in steam-heated tanks of hot water
at Long Ashton but there were always a few breakages every session.. So be
prepared with gloves and goggles.

But Small is Beautiful, Dick!  Don't worry about the numbers - the Cider
Digest is great.  The truth is that there probably aren't a huge number of
hard cider makers out there - but for those that are, it's really
appreciated.   What I do think, though, is that those of us with
cidermaking web sites should do our best to link to everyone else and to
ensure we have a Cider Digest link on our pages too!




Happy New Year to All

I was looking at a recent article in Restaurant Business(Oct 98) which
was talking about the resurgence of interest in cider. They described
several drinks, one made with beer and cider called Snake Bite. Another
made with stout and cider called a Black Velvet. Perhaps this is where
this marketing gem came from.

"Black Cider" seems to me to be a ploy by Koch and his junta to increase
the market for (his) cider.  What self-respecting bar-hopping kid would
drink *cider* with his mates, especially when their all drinking Guiness or
Heineken Dark or whatever the newest Dark Beer of the Week is?  Well,
he'd be drinking Black Cider, of course.  
Koch thinks that cider is mainly drunk by Women and wants something a
bit more macho to appeal to the Men.  This may fit the bill nicely -- unless
one sees through the ploy or are concerned with the politics of what one
eats and drinks (like I am) or are a purist.


Just my $0.02.
