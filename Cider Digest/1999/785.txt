I can recall Guiness marketing from the late 70s that had something similar,
except that IIRC it was Guiness and Cider in their brochure that was a Snake
Bite and Guinness and Champagne was Black Velvet. All this from my youthful
days when we drank Bulmer's Strongbow Draught with a dash of Angostura
Bitters, or in winter before going to work night shift at a local mines
Strongbow with a nip of Stone's Green Ginger!


And while I am at it I might as well report on my second 'real' cider, of
which I opened my first bottle on New Year's Day (about 8 months from start
to finish). Last season was very bad for apples - a combination of drought
and a long summer with many lifecycles of pests such as co
dling moth at the local certified organic orchard. As a result the season
was very short and the only available juice was pressed from a variety of
dessert apples such as Romes and Golden Delicious (seconds that were left
over at the end of the season), some windfall Yarlington Mills and maybe
about 15% crabs from my own tree. I fermented with a champagne type of
yeast, pitched after natural fermentation had already started, and it
produced a 9% cider. When opened the carbonation was very champagne like -
quite a bit of reasonably soft fizz when first poured, settling down to a
steady rising bubble. The flavour is very pleasing - dry, with only a slight
hint of perhaps a little too high a proportion of crabs. Certainly
sufficient impetus to make more ... This year if sufficient juice is
available (my own trees are currently less than a year old) I intend to try
both a natural fermentation (following Andrew Lea's encouraging website
information) as well as an inoculated one.


And yes, Dick, I agree with Andrew comments concerning the quality rather
than the quantity of the Cider digest. There may not be a huge number of
cider makers, and many of us are hobbyists, with some wishing and planning
to make it an occupation, but it is a high quality bunch of interested
people that you are brining together and as a result expanding the
opportunities for development.  Keep it up, and enjoy it!


Happy New Year
Rod

The membership maybe down, but the content level is excellent. One of
the things I have noticed over the several years that I have
participated,  is that there is a increasing level of interest in
traditional cider. I see the Cider Digest moving on from the industrial
mode of how do I make a alcoholic beverage from apples to a post
industrial mode of how to make a superior cider.

Black Velvet is a combination of Guinness and Cider, pulled separately by
the barman into the same glass.  It's been around in the UK at least since
I was a student in the mid - 60's.  Don't know when it started!
