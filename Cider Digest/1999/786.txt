As an extract beer brewer, I decided to try my first batch
of "Hard Cider!"  After fermentation in my primary carboy, I
transferred over to my secondary.  The cider seems to have
settled out pretty clear, and I'm wondering how long I
should keep it in the secondary before bottling?  I intend
to add some corn sugar at bottling time in the hope of some
mild carbonation.  Any advice is appreciated, especially
since most of the newsgroups seem to shy away from this fine
beverage!!  Thanks in advance!!

Does anyone know of a good professional/commercial cider maker in the
Sacramento, CA area.  I am planning the program lineup for the Home Wine
Beer Trade Association's (HWBTA) annual conference and would like to have a
cidermaker speak. The HWBTA is a group of homebrew/wine shop owners from the
US and Canada.  


I have made some very tasty ciders but am not experienced enough to make a
comprehensive presentation on the subject.  Any help the digest subscribers
can provide is very appreciated.  


BTW, my secret cider ingredient is Wyeast or Yeast Lab's sweet mead yeast.
It is very alcohol tolerant, leaves residual sweetness and lots of apple
character in the finished cider.

In Cider Digest #776 of 18 November last, Andrew Lea wrote (in message
5/8):


"Incidentally, here in the Oxfordshire/Berkshire corner of the UK, Roy
Bailey and myself are experimenting this season with a French enzyme
which promotes reliable 'keeving' - a means of clarifying and removing
nitrogen from fresh juices so they can undergo exactly the sort of long
slow (4-6 month) wild yeast fermentation which we're looking for in this
context. We'll keep you posted!"


This experiment is now fairly well advanced and, as far as I am
concerned, has been highly successful. I have produced an illustrated
report which Andrew has checked, and this has been posted on our website
at:
        <http://www.westberks.demon.co.uk/lvcider/ferment.htm>


I hope that cider-makers will find the conclusions of interest.
