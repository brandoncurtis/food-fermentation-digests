I have been filtering and artificially carbonating my cider for the last 
several months, great results. Does anyone know the shelf life one can 
expect with this method. Seems to be good so far .

I bottle my cider as soon as it is clear. If I want to make carbonated
cider, I dissolve 200 gramms sugar in 10 liter cider, add champagne yeast
and fill into champagne bottles, closed with those special plastic corks
with metal wire. I start fermentation in a warm room, after a week or so I
put the bottles in my (cold) cellar and let them rest for some months upside
down. I ice the top of the bottles, remove the corks with the iced yeast and
close again.
(excuse my bad english, I hope I used the right words)

I generally keep my ciders in the secondary 2-3 months, though I have
only made 3 so far (2 are still bottle conditioning so I don't know how
they turned out yet).  The first one, after bottle conditioning for 6
months was very good - after a year, excellent!

Hello to all,


I've recently started making my own cider and would like to explore
cooking with cider.  I've had little success looking for recipes on the
web--anybody have some ideas for me?


Your (hard) cider recipes would be greatly appreciated!  I am especially
interested in main course items.  Feel free to respond to me directly or
through cider digest.


Cheers,
