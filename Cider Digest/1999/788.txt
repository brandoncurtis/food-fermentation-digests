I have the great fortune to be married to a professional cook. Regarding
cooking with cider, the first suggestion was to look up the cuisine of
Normandy, which uses cider extensively.Southern England is a possibility also.


Suggestion two was The American Country Cook, by Pat Katz.


As a general rule, marinate the meat in cider for one or two hours with
whatever seasonings you fancy, pat it dry, and either roast or pan fry.
Doing this in a plastic bag saves both wash-up and uses less cider.


To make a sauce with it, you want to remove the meat from the pan, heat the
pan over medium-to-high heat, pour in some cider (this is called de-glazing)
and reduce a bit, scrape off the sticky bits with a heat resistant spatula,
and moisten these with either meat stock, chicken stock (if you are cooking
chicken) or heavy cream. Reduce this by half, or until it looks like sauce.


A recent delightful meal involved roast pork loin;  rubbed with Dijon
mustard, sweet pepper relish, fresh ground pepper and about 3 ounces of
cider. Belle de Boskop apple sauce on the side, a mix of sushi rice and long
grain wild rice, and some veggies. Unfortunately, our cider isn't ready yet
- - had to make do with wine.

I've got 2 batches of cider (1 plain, 1 raspberry) that are clearing
nicely...    They've 
been in the carboys since October and before bottling I'm considering adding
some 
apple juice concetrate for a more "apply" aroma and taste.  Has anybody done
this?
Pros or cons ?   I'll be sorbating/sulfiting at bottling to keep
fermentation from
restarting as I'd like a slightly sweeter cider. 


Regards,
Trask

In general, I've heard that conventional wisdom is to rack from
primary to secondary after fermentation settles out (order of one
month for me), and then to bottle on a high-pressure spring day (why?
dust?).
I believe that lengthy secondaries are in general a good thing; if
there are rough-tasting components created during primary fermentation
(higher alcohols and esters etc., I think), these have sometimes
dramatically mellowed with time either in secondary or the bottle.


I started a carboy of cider in October 1993 from that fall's apple
crop, and likely racked to secondary in December 1993 or so.  I
bottled it in September 1998 (nearly 5 years later) and it was quite
good.
I started 3 carboys in October 1994, and bottled those also in
September 1998.  2 were excellent (a cyser and a "maple mead", the
latter being 1.5 gallons grade B maple syrup and 4 gallons cider), and
one was a bit acetic (airlock had dried out due to neglect - don't do
this).  The acetic one is becoming less acetic in the bottle, and is
now reasonably pleasant.

This works in beer since the yeast has used up all fermentable
sugars.  If your cider is low-gravity (straight pressed cider), this
should work and give you a dry sparkling cider.  In my ciders above,
the OG was probably 1100 or more, and the yeast (natural orchard
yeast) gave out long before fermenting everything.  I'm pretty sure
adding corn sugar would not have resulting in carbonation, but I
didn't try.  The maple mead is like a dessert wine, really, and I like
it still.


It's quite possible that a lower-gravity cider (say from 1035-1060)
would not benefit from long secondary so much, and would not be as
robust against spoiling organisms.
Also, the degree of care against oxidation you'll need when racking is
much higher for cider than beer, in my experience.
