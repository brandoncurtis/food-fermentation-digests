My supplier of fresh pressed apple juice has informed me that she will be
adding preservatives next year. Being spoiled by this supply for many years,
I've never explored 
any alternatives. Does anybody know of a supplier of fresh pressed juice in
the greater Chicago/Northwest Indiana/Southwest Michigan area? Thinking
ahead...TIA, Charlie

Greg Troxel asked (Digest 788) why rack and bottle on a high pressure day.


In Northern Europe, high pressure days in winter / spring  are usually cold
and clear rather than damp and rainy.  So


(i) the feel good factor for the cidermaker  is better!


(ii) the temperature is lower therefore keeping more natural CO2 in
solution thus more sparkle eventually in bottle


(iii) the high pressure also keeps the CO2 in solution and prevents
sedimented yeast from picking up gas bubble 'balloons'  thereby rising up
into the body of the cider and making it cloudy


That's the reason for this homespun wisdom!

Hi
After a very successful first attempt at making cider. I realize that I have
a Bartlett pear tree in my back yard. I have for a number of years take a
significant crop of table quality pear from this tree, . I have done this by
spaying only twice in the spring and then culling the tree so that I produce
only quality rather than quantity.  It now February and the time that I
should be pruning the tree (a must for pear). 
What I am coming to the list for is advice on how to grow pears for perry 
1.)     what sprays not to use
2.)     How long leave the pears on the tree
3.)     How to extract the juice
        and how to make perry. 
        1.) A good recipe
        2.) Does and don'ts
4.)     Amount of juice to expect from a bushel of Pears


And any other useful information. The list will be willing to share.

Donald Yellman <dyellman@primenet.com> described his very clever disposal-
grinder setup.  I'm certainly game to try it myself since I've not been
happy with the texture I've been getting from the grinder on my press (too
coarse) nor the yield (almost always under 50% in terms of juice-weight:
original-apple-weight).  I've got some questions, which I'll post in hopes
the answers (from Donald or anyone else who's tried this) will be of
general interest.
  * The SS interior is an obvious Good Thing for sanitation, but do you
    find that there are little corners, holes, crevices that are hard to
    clean of apple pulp and bits?  Are we talking here about a device that
    can be kept clean enough to produce food-quality output?  I don't ask
    this in the sense of formal regulations so much as I want to know if
    you can get it clean enough to produce fresh juice for short-term con-
    sumption or freezing (as opposed to relying on the fermentation step
    for dealing with pathogens).
  * What is your processing rate?  You mention having to stop periodically
    to cool the motor, but you were also talking in terms of a dozen
    bushels (say five hundred pounds) or so.  For a lot of us, this isn't
    going to be an issue since we just don't press that much at a time.
    For me, even if I did that much in one day, it would still be cyclic
    since I'd grind-and-press, repeat.  I wouldn't grind everything at
    once.  So, how fast can you grind a bushel of apples?
  * Do you notice any heating of the pomace after you've been running for
    a while?
  * Is there any problem with clogging?  One of the characteristics of the
    design of a disposal is that it's meant to run with a lot of water
    flow, which you won't have.  Have you tried pears?  That might be my
    reference point for possible clogging.
  * Most disposals come with a flexible shield for the top, intended in
    normal use to keep debris from being ejected back out of the disposal.
    (These shields also narrow the effective opening.)  Do you use the
    shield, and if not, do you have any trouble with blow-back?
  * How is it with seeds?  Does it tend to break/cut a lot of seeds?

Any thought about mounting the disposal so that it will feed directly into
the press basket of a small press?  That would require a downward
discharge, of course.


One other little note:
>      The internal parts of even the cheaper garbage disposals are all
> stainless steel...


Looking around at lumber/home-improvement store stuff (a lot of which is
low-end), I saw several with galvanized interiors.  Don't think I'd want
that...zinc and apple juice sounds like a bad idea.  Caveat emptor--be sure
it's stainless before you buy.
