Hi All,


I've been a Homebrewer for some time now, but I'd like to give Cider a
try.  I believe I've got most of the equipment already, but I could
use some help in creating a relatively simply 1 gallon test batch.


Can I simply get a gallon  of Preservative-Free apple cider from the
local health food store to start with?  Or should I wait until we make
our yearly trek to the mountains and get a gallon of freshly-pressed
cider?


And will a glass gallon container (such as what the cider comes in at
the health food store) be good enough to use?


Many thanks in advance,


tom

Muscadet de Dieppe can be found in the Geneva Malus Catalog. This
catalog can be found starting with =
http://www.ars-grin.gov/gen/apple.html. The WSU Research Station at Mt.
Vernon also has several of these trees. Nick Botner also lists it. His
address was posted in an earlier response.=20

Jeff Peters asked:
>Oh, by the way...I saw a
recipe for Scrumpy that called for raw meat during the fermentation
process (?????) was this a joke?
<
No it's not a joke.  Traditional apple juices from big old trees are poor
in nutrients. Adding the meat helped the fermentation along  by feeding the
yeast with amino acids and vitamins.  Today you can add yeast nutrient to
do the same thing.  Though it should be said that many of us contributing
to Cider Digest are interested in long slow fermentations that take  4 - 6
months to finish, since we believe a certain quality can arise that way!

order it at INRA Editions (http://www.inra.fr/). It's huge (771 pages) and
expensive. Over 300 varieties are meticulously described and there are
numerous photographs and drawings. Published in 1997. In French...

I can't find it via the INRA on-line catalogue but I've requested the
printed version.  That book sounds terrific.  There's never been anything
that comprehensive, for cider, in English.  The most recent cider apple
book was Bulmers Pomona which runs to just 35 cider cultivars. Sob,
sob....!!
