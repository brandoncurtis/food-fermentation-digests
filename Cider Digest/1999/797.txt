What do you mean by expensive?  Here in Australia we are used to paying
excessively for quality books. Having recently bought Temperate Zone
Pomology for A$145 it would be useful to know what the list price of this
publication is.


Thanks

I have just found a reference to Bore and Fleckinger's Pommiers =E0 =
cidre
"Vari=E9t=E9s de France" at


http://www.village.tm.fr/Lib/Html/A_3507.html


which lists the price as 540 Francs.  This equates approximately to =
A$150 or
US$90.=20

I just recieved a word from NAFEX member Lee Elliot, Cider Hill Nursery,
1852 Woodson-Winchester Road, Winchester, Il. 62694, phone 217-882-2047. He
sent me his catalog and has the following French varieties : Muscadet de
Dieppe, Muscadet de Bernay and Nehou, plus about 2 dozen English cider
varieties.

Andrew,
Try this web address :

(all on one line)
This has worked today (March 2). It will bring you to a search engine. You
can then type "Fleckinger" under Auteur and this will bring you directly to
the Bore and Fleckinger book.
I must say this site is strangely built. Last time I had seen it, the book
was easy to find under the new releases, but it's not there anymore.


About English varieties, you surely have "The Book of Apples" by Morgan and
Richards, where 70 varieties, mostly English, are listed. But the
descriptions are extremely short and don't compare with the information
that can be found in Bore and Fleckinger.

My first batch of cider cost me all of $10 to make.  I purchased a gallon
of preservative free non pasturized cider, a small container of nutrient, a
Wyeast smack pack and an airlock.  I opened the jug, poured out about 1/2
cup of cider dumoed in the yeast and nutrient and threw on the airlock.  2
months later, cider!  Now, with this you have to remember that you are
going to have a lot of blow off from the airlock and will have to clean it
almost every day.


Still the best batch I have made.

Nice selection of apples here:


Sonoma Antique Apple Nursery


http://applenursery.com/


Table apples, bittersweets, cider apples.  Nice selection of other
fruits also.

I recently purchased several new storage containers for cider. They are
consturcted of High Density Polyethylene(HPLPE). This is FDA approved
material but it has a heavy resin smell. Any ideas as how to remove the
smell?

Is the Bulmers Pomona still in print? Where can you purchase one?
