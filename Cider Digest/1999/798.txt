Subject: Fermenting apple juice

Hi,


I'm pretty new to fermenting cider.  My experience is limited to
fermenting a couple gallons of juice I mixed up from frozen
concentrate. It tasted pretty good until I racked it the final time
and sealed it for storage; I must have contaminated it.


What are the collective's views on using frozen concentrates this
way?  I really want to get a batch going and don't have access to
quality cider right now. This seems like a cheap, convenient and
effective alternative to me.


Opinions will be appreciated!


Matt

The Bulmers Pomona was published in 1987 for HP Bulmer and Co (to celebrate
the centenary of the company's formation) by Fourth Estate Ltd, 113
Westbourne Grove, London W2 4UP.  At the time it was claimed to be a
limited edition (though my copy isn't numbered).  I've no idea whether it's
still in print - people interested could perhaps enquire via the Bulmer
website.  It contains thirty-five colour plates of cider apples painted by
Caroline Todhunter - facing each plate is a brief description of each
variety by Ray Williams (who was at that time the Long Ashton cider
pomologist but is now retired)


Its ISBN is  0-94779-536-7

Hi All


Does anyone know of a source for good cider making juice in Australia?
Preferably somewhere in NSW/ACT or that will do mail order.


I have tried making ciders with both juice concentrates from homebrew
shops and regular supermarket variety un-preserved apple juice but
would like to try some juice from real coder varieties if such things
can be found here in Oz.


Cheers
Dave
