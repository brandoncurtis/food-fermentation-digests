Dave (and any other Australians for whom this info might be useful),
Around this time of year I do the annual trek out to our local (Canberra)
certified organic orchard where they have a few Yarlington Mill trees.  The
last few years the harvest has been down a fair bit, due to drought last
season and a late frost this season, and they usually do juice for
cider-making that is part Yarlington Mill and a mix of dessert varieties
(seconds).  Last year I added a couple of buckets of my own crabs to
compensate for the dessert apples, and this worked really well. This year
they are probably only going to have enough for a couple of 100 litre
pressings for cider (I currently only make 25 litres at a time), and the
first such pressing will occur next week.   If you are able to get down to
CBR to pick it up (I don't think they do mail order) you might like to call
them - Pialligo Apples (02) 62489228 or mobile 015 263 835.  If you are
interested in growing cider varieties yourself Keith Robertson, who is in
Victoria and as far as I know still subscribes to this list (Keith - you
still there?) may be able to help out.  This is the path I have chosen (I
now have about a dozen successful varieties grafted last winter/spring and
growing in a plot in the back yard - only now I need my piece of land to
plant the trees on sooner rather than later... 
Let me know if you are coming down this way for juice.
Rod

        I can't speak for everyone, but I often use frozen concentrate
myself.  Sometimes I use it to add more apple flavor to a batch of cider
and sometimes I use it as the sole source of apple juice for making cider.
It is the most widely available form of juice and many manufacturers are
increasing the number of apple varieties that go into the juice.




        I have a question for the collective as well.  I still haven't
made a really good cider yet.  Many of them are harshly acidic.  I tried
dumping a small amount of calcium carbonate in, but it only seemed to have
no effect on the harsh acid (although the cider did seem slightly more
bland if that makes any sense).  I hear that there are some acids in cider
that seem more harsh than others.  Does calcium carbonate selectively
react with the less harsh acids?  
        Also, I noticed that by diluting 2 gallons of apple juice with 2
gallons of sugar water(1.5 lbs/gal and 4 tsp. of acid blend, I get a much
more palatable drink.  Can anybody think of what I find so offensive in
apple juice?  (Serious replies only, please.  I've already heard the
answer, "Maybe you're diluting your juice because you don't like apple
flavor." from many of my friends.)  The thing is, they like my cider as
well.  It tastes more like many of the large-scale, US-made commercial
brands (Woodchuck, Ace, Hornsby's) than any homemade cider my friends have
produced.  I should mention that I prefer Woodchuck or Wyder's to many of
the drier, American-made ciders(Widmer and many small companies I have
forgotten).  It seems like the undiluted juice can't be sweetened enough
to mask the harsh acidity I speak of without becoming cloyingly sweet.
Any ideas?

Subject: Questions About Regulations for Apple Cider
From: "Michael O. Hanson" <mhanson@winternet.com>

I have heard that makers of apple cider are or will be required to add
Potassium Sorbate to their products.  Is this
true?  If so, do you know of any exceptions to this regulation short of
pressing my own cider?  I have made
fermented cider and mead with very good results using apple cider purchased
from grocery stores and would like to
avoid pressing my own apples if possible.


Thank You,

Dear All,


I am a new subscriber to the Cider Digest but planted my first cider 
apple trees in 1984 so have been knee deep in apples for a number of 
seasons now.
Because of the limitations on importation of budwood for disease reasons, 
Australia appears to have a fairly limited range of cider cultivars. My 
collection has been put together mainly by inspection of lists of 
collections held by agriculture departments and comparison of those lists 
with cider cultivars quoted in cider publications of one sort or another.
This note is written with the hope of finding other cultivars in 
Australia that are held, or known of, by cider devotees in Australia. 
Please contact me if you know of cultivars other than those listed:


Dabinett        Improved Foxwhelp   Somerset Red Streak   Stoke Red       
 Sweet Coppin
Bulmers Norman  Browns Apple        Yarlington Mill       Kingston Black  
 Reine des Hatives
Brown Snout     Tremletts Bitter    Breakwells Seedling   Michelin        
 Sweet Alford


and can anyone confirm that the following are true ciders, or whether 
they have simply been used in a cider blend?
Frequin Rouge   Cimitiere du Pays   Eggleton Styre


Harvest about half completed for this summer - going great!

Re: Matt Birchfield and fermenting from concentrate.
I have used "house brand" frozen apple juice to make a very good apple pie
cyser and another to make a sparkling cider.  It makes a very drinkable
product.


I did learn that using raw cider from Dixon Farms (New Mexico) produced a much
better cider.
