In response to Chuck's "French cider hunt".  Chuck I was just in France last
month and had no problem locating cider.  I can't give you brand names because
it was that common I found.  The first bottle I sampled was at a ESSO gas
station and from there I found it almost every place I went.  Good luck and
enjoy!

I've just received a request from Gary Moulton at Washington State
University: please don't send him inquiries about the cider event scheduled
for next month in Seattle . When the schedule and other information become
available, we'll post it on Cider Digest.


Thanks very much.

How much (if at all) does cider benefit from aging? Is there an optimum 
time, if so?  While I'm asking, has anyone had any experience in aging 
cider in oak barrels or with oak chips? Thanks in advance!

Okay, so I started my first batch of cider two days ago, and yesterday I 
was watching it ferment when I thought: what keeps this from becoming 
apple wine? I'd never thought about it, but the steps were really no 
different from normal winemaking... so what should stop the alcohol 
level at 5 or 6%?  I checked the handful of cider making pages that I've 
found, but I could find no distinction. Help a poor newbie, please?


Thanks, all-


Jake

I have been reading with interest all of the Cider Digests since I subscribed 
over a year ago.  There is a wealth of information for amateurs like myself 
who are just starting out.  I guess it's my turn to ask for help.  I just 
finished my fourth batch of cider.  Actually the first two were vinegar.  The 
third was very drinkable and I had high hopes for the fourth.  It started 
with a very active 5 gallon primary fermentation under a champagne yeast, and 
continued in a secondary for approx. 3 months.  At bottling, I added 3/4 cup 
of corn sugar.  Two weeks later I wanted to make sure everything worked so I 
sampled a bottle.  No carbonation!  I would appreciate any troubleshooting 
suggestions.  Alcohol percentage is ~8% and I filtered with a wine filter as 
before.  I'm stumped.
