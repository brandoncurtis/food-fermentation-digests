Has anyone tried freezing must from early fruiting apples to mix with the 
must from apples that fruit a couple of months later? If so, what effect does 
the freezing have on the smell and taste of the cider? How long can you 
freeze and get away with it?? Thanks. Magunda@aol.com

Regarding the yield of apple cider. Our big old press, circa 1898, with a 
pressure of 100 tons gets them pretty dry.We average for each bushel of 
apples a yield of  about 3 to 3 1/2 gallons. With a bushel of apples weighing 
approximately 48lbs that would be a  yield of about 6 to 7 gallons per i00 
lbs of apples. Hope this is of some help.

Oh dear. I forgot that not all transports accept non-ASCII symbols, so
my contribution to Cider Digest #804 was garbled.


It should have read:


'I find that a 56 lb (25 kg) bag of apples normally produces between 3
and a half and 4 gallons of juice, depending on the season and the type
of apples.


That's British gallons, of course.'

We are making our own cider for a few years now. By the way, here in
Austria we don't call it cider, we call it "Most" - but it has the
same long tradition as cider making in the UK. Because of the lack of
old cider apple varieties we have to use "normal" eating apples,
mostly Golden Delicious. The cider turns out quite well. For storage
we use 50l aluminium pressure barrels. And every year we have the same
problem: the first mug of cider out of the barrel is nice, smooth and
fruity.  We always cover the cider with CO2 as soon as we open the
barrel. But nonetheless the cider starts changing. A week later it has
got a kind of sharpness it hasn't a few days ago. And from week to
week it gets sharper and rougher. The cider is always under pressure,
covered with CO2 and there no significant layer of dead yeast in the
barrel. No infection , too - as far as I can see. And we are wondering
what happens. Maybe one of the cider "gurus" on this list knows what
happens!?
Last, but not least:I appreciate this cider forum very much,
especially the friendly way discussions take place!!
Greetings from Austrian cider lovers,
