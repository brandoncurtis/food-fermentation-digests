Dick Dunn says, responding to a post on whether it is feasible to freeze 
early season sweet cider & mix & ferment it with late season juice:


<< I haven't tried that, but let me suggest a different approach:  Ferment
 your earlier apples and hold the cider (in a carboy or whatever) until you
 have your later apples.  If it matters to you to ferment with natural
 yeasts, this solves the problem that the freezing would kill the yeasts. >>


I just made a good batch of naturally fermented cider using flash-frozen 
sweet cider.  It took a day to defrost the jugs, & three days later the jugs 
were puffed up & ready for the carboy. . . I think a lot of the yeast survive 
freezing, it's just pasteurization or preservatives that'll get em.

Thanks for your sudden answer - but I fear that your suggestions don`t
solve our problems.
=46irst of all, we have one stainless steel barrel with cider - and the
same happens with the cider there. From the day on you take your first
glass of cider out of the barrel it starts to change and gets rougher
and rougher.

The malo-lactic fermentation - as far as I understood - is related to
the rising temperatures in spring. It starts when the temperatures in
the cellar  rise in spring or its directly following the fermentation
in autuumn if the temperatures are high enough. But this changes are
not correlated to the time of the year, it doesn`t matter if we open
the barrel in December or in May.
But - the next thing I will do is measuring the acidity....
Well, the changes are not as bad if you empty the barrel as quick as
you can - before the cider tastes like the "scrumpy" ones we got to
know in Devonshire.....

Hi all, I'm a new member to this list.  I started making cider because I was
disappointed with only having a choice of 2 brands on the shelf in the
stores.  I finished bottling my first batch 3 weeks ago using a Blackrock
cider (New Zealand) kit (It comes in a can with a yeast sachet) in a sealed
plastic brewer.  No probs with making the cider - takes a lot longer than
beer.


3 weeks later it is not fit for drinking.  I know that the cider will taste
better the longer I leave it - but when can I start to enjoy it?  I'm not
sure if I am doing something wrong, but I want to make sure before I start
my next brew.  I have the same base to work with but I intend to include a
sachet of dry amylase to give the  cider a dry flavour.


Blackrock is the only base that I am aware of in South Australia.  There
used to be an English version but the state of the Aust $ has made the base
prohibitive to import.  I have also been told that only dessert apples are
around if I want to start from scratch.


Sorry for the long post.  Appreciate any helpful comments.

Subject: 5th Annual Boneyard Brew-Off

The Boneyard Union of Zymurgical Zealots of Champaign, IL 
would like to announce our upcoming 5th Annual Boneyard 
Brew-Off taking place June 11-12, 1999.  We will be judging 
all 1998 BJCP beer, mead, and cider categories.  This is an 
AHA sanctioned competition as well as a qualifying event for 
the Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing (MCAB) II (see
http://www.hbd.org/mcab for more details).  Points will also be 
awarded for Midwest Homebrewer of the Year.


The main judging will start at 9:00 am on Saturday, June 12th.  
Standard AHA rules apply: we will need three unmarked 
10-16 oz brown or green bottles, with bottle ID forms attached 
to each bottle with a rubber band, a completed entry/recipe 
form, and $6 for each of the first entry, $5 for each subsequent 
entry from the same brewer(s).  Entries must arrive between 
MAY 26 and JUNE 5, 1999.  We will accept walk-in entries 
from judges at 8:15 am on the day of the competition 
(June 12th) as long as the completed paperwork and fee arrive 
by June 5th.


Our special category again this year will be the "No One Gets 
Out Alive High-Gravity Brew-Off".  In this category, we will judge 
any beer with a starting gravity over 1.070 purely on the basis 
of drinkability and octane.  For this category, we only require 
two unmarked 6-16 oz brown or green bottles.  We will allow 
any high gravity style, but if you wish the beer to be also judged 
in another category, you must separately enter it in that category.  
No fortification is allowed.  The winners in this category will not 
be eligible for best of show, but will receive a special award.


Entries should be sent to:
Boneyard Brew-Off
c/o Piccadilly Beverage Shop
505 S. Neil St.
Champaign, IL 61820


For additional information, contact the competition organizer 
Brian Paszkiet (bpaszkie@uiuc.edu or (217) 352-2438(H) or 
(217) 333-9033(W)).
