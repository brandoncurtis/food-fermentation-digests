Laird's makes a "blended applejack" that's 65 percent neutral spirits,
and when they blurb it "subtle hint of apple" they aren't kidding.
They also make an "apple brandy" listing no neutral spirits.  I dunno
whether under U.S. liquor law this means it has none, but in any case
it has more of a flavor.

Okay folks; I have a cider that's been in the secondary (racked a number of
times), I'm about to bottle it and I'd like it to be carbonated. I know how
to carbonate beer, but is the method the same for cider? I did my first
batch of cider which I primed with 3/4 of a cup of priming sugar (made into
a syrup) added to my bottling bucket. It produced no carbonation whatsoever
after two weeks. I was told to drop a few morsels of yeast into each bottle
and wait longer. This sort of worked but gave the cider some floaties of
yeast which wouldn't settle on the bottom. What did I do wrong? Or...did I
not wait long enough? I had assumed that after four months and a number of
rackings that the majority of the yeast would have been gone...any help
would be appreciated!

The smoky / hammy flavour may give us a clue - this is usually
asoociated with ethyl phenol / ethyl catechol / ethyl guiacol arising
from bacterial breakdown. Maybe it IS a bacterial infection creeping
back up the tap?

Claude Jolicouer asked me to expand my comments on frozen apples.  My
experience has been


1.  The apples must necessarily be fully thawed before pressing.  They
are then very
sloppy, and difficult to handle, the cell structure is lost, and they
press out to a turbid pulp rather than a juice.


2.  On thawing, all the enzymes start working madly with all the
enzymes.  The pulp is then biochemically unstable, the pectin strucure
is lost and the polyphenols oxidise to a nasty brown slurry!


But that's only my experience, especially with bittersweet cider apples
at relatively high pH.  It may be less so for more acid fruit.  If it
works for you.. go for it!!

Wild yeasts do vary in their production of volatile sulphur compounds,
especially if SO2 is used in the fermentation.  With some luck this will
have disappeared after fermentation. You can treat with small quantities
of copper sulphate to bind it if it's still present when fermentation is
complete

I've been making naturally conditioned ciders in bottle for about 4
years now and this is exactly my observation too! After about two years
the subtle qualities start to decline from the plateau too, I think.

Eddy Hefford asked

pH 3.8 is a pretty good place to be for most ciders.


In the same bulletin, John Wilkinson asked

This is the way a modern laboratory would it (although colour indicators
are absolutely fine too).  The point for neutralisation of
malic acid with alkali is strictly pH 8.1, but anywhere between pH 7 and
9 is OK.

The question has come up in my house as to just what the difference between 
Cider and Apple Jack is.  If anyone knows and could inform me, it would 
certainly put an end to the debate.


Thanks,
