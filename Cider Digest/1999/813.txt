Ran across this article on the Lallemand website. I am glad to see 
cider getting some more attention.
http://www.lallemand.com/brew/inferment/Articles/Article%20Cider.html


Here are a few thigs I extracted from the article:
Pectinase arabinase should be considered to avoid arabane haze later, 
especially if pears are to be introduced into the cider formula.


The cider maker is in control and has the option of quickly removing 
the yeast at the end of fermentation to maintain the light fruity 
character of the juice or to allow the cider to remain on the lees to 
bring out yeasty notes and further complexities. If the cider is to 
remain on the lees, there should be an initial racking to remove the 
bulk of the sediment. The remaining lees should be stirred 
occasionally, weekly or monthly, to bring out the full benefit of 
aging on the lees which releases proteins that help soften the 
tannins.

I'd like to pose a question to the list about browning reactions in the
processing of apples, and in the making of cider.  Could anybody explain
the particulars in terms of biochemistry on how this takes place, and how
the process is controled or prevented?  I'm also curious to what degree
the maillard reaction plays a role in browning reactions in apples and
cider.


Thanks for any help!
