Cider-lovers


I sent this message to Cider Digest on 24 may, but I don't think I ever saw
it appear.  Dick, did a Cider Digest disappear recently - I don't recall
seeing a number 812?


Resent message:


Recently I started drinking last year's cider, which was started in Mar/Apr
98 and bottled in October. I was rather intrigued to discover the cider had
thrown a sediment in the form of a fairly firm (a bottle brush will remove
it) film on the bottom of the bottle (the bottle has been standing upright)
and it looks something like a similar sediment you occasionally get in some
wines. I have always referred to this stuff as tannin.  Does anyone know
what it really is, and has anyone else had it in their cider?

Re: Paul Haaf's question about "Natural Fermentation"...


Just a guess, but I think that Woodchuck means that their product is
actually fermented apple juice, and not a mixture of water, sugar, apple
flavoring, and neutral spirits.   That's what comprises most "coolers"
(note they no longer call themselves "wine coolers") these days.


Just makes you want to make your own even more, huh?

RE: Paul Haaf's question about "naturally fermented"


My understanding of "naturally fermented" based on reading the BATF manuals
in the US is that you can use this term to describe a cider or wine product
that has an alcohol level due to the fermentation of the sugars that were
available in the fruit's juice. No sugar was added to increase the alcohol
level. We (Rhyne Cyder) have fermented California apples with final alcohol
levels of ~5%-9% but no sugar was added. The variety of apple, the amount
of sunshine, and the level of ripeness can affect the apple's sugar level.
Some people want to make an apple wine with a higher alcohol level so they
add sugar to get the product up higher-12 to 14%. So the term is meant to
inform the consumer as to the cidermaker's practices.

Paul Haaf asked about the terms "naturally fermented" and "cold filtration."


These descriptions along with terms such as "draft" cider are all commercial
marketing driven and have nothing to do with basic cider production.  In
fact the terms "cold filtered" and "draft" were "stolen"  from the copy of
the industrial beer marketing gurus.


I believe the phrase "naturally fermented" began in the mid eighties on the
west coast.  Consumers had a difficult time understanding that cider
contained alcohol.  Back then at least 98% of the population thought the
beverage was something one consumed along with a favorite breakfast cereal.


The UK company, Taunton was persuaded by its west coast importer to modify
its label to read "fermented cider.  The next producer to come along decided
that "naturally fermented" read better and soon most of the small companies
were using the phrase.


"Cold filtered" was a description used by the industrial beer people to help
fight the claims of the real beer revolutionaries.  Then as now most
commercial beers were pasteurized.  Micro salesfolk were successfully using
the "non pasteurized" label to hurt the big boys.


In an attempt to minimize these inroads, sterile filtration rapidly became
an industry standard with filtration set at 0.45 microns.  This level
enabled brewers with ultra clean plants to forego pasteurization as a
preservative measure.   Wanting to differentiate from the "inferior"
pasteurized products of competitors, clever marketers decided that cold
filtering - something all brewers have done almost as long as they have
filtered - had a sexy ring to it.  Thus was cold filtration born!


The cider marketers very quickly grasped the concept!

Hi there,


since a while I am importing small amounts of cider from a small but
excellent New Zealand cider maker.
He started in the late eigthies and has well established his name over there.
It already earned him several awards of the NZ Fruit wine association.
