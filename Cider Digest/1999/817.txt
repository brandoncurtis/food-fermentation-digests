Re: apple wine versus apple cider


My simple understanding of cider vs. wine is that cider is naturally
fermented apple juice and apple wine is fortified cider with a higher
alcohol level by adding alcohol or sugar to increase the alcohol level, up
to a maximum of 14% alcohol by volume.


According to the BATF 1995 Code of Federal Regulations Book 27,Section
4.21. Page 19, "Fruit wines which are derived wholly (except for sugar,
water, or added alchohol) from apples or pears may be designated "cider"
and "perry", respectively, and shall be so designated if lacking in vinous
taste, aroma, and characteristics.")


This is  a USA perspective and I am sure that the Europeans will have a
different spin because of our different histories with alcohol.

UK/Australian info:


Any cider with an alcohol content above about 8.5% is usually
considered to be "apple wine".  Cider normally is expected to have 
an alcohol content in the range 4 - 8.5%

This is a heck of a good question.  I have wondered about it for the last
forty-five years.  My guess - and it is a  guess is that a true cider is
result of fermenting 100% unadulterated apple juice. On the other hand if
apple juice is chaptalized with the addition of pure dry sugar or with apple
juice concentrate then the resulting product with a higher than normal
residual alcohol will be apple wine.


Many years ago I formed my own opinion as to why this might be the case.  I
served my apprenticeship with a cider maker who produced something called
VAW (vintage apple wine)  This "cider" was approximately 15% alc/vol.  The
VAW could be sold as "wine" or diluted with juice and water down to a more
respectable level of alcohol.
Many years ago in Quebec the farmers illegally produced and sold at the farm
gate a delightful high alcoholic "cider" using this same approach.  In the
late fifties when that Province legalized cider making the commercial
producers of the day continued the tradition of producing a high alcohol
(circa 10.5% alc/vol.) product.  However they called it "cidre" and not
"vin"
Have I confused you?

We have attempted to make apple cider vinegar but are having problems with
the finished product.   We ferment the cider without yeast in a carboy (5
gallon) then once cleared we rack the hard cider to two 5 gallon carboys
and introduce about a cup of apple cider vinegar.  Our product is dark in
colour but contains residue not gelatinous like "mother" but floating
residue (where this comes from I don't know).  It also does not taste quite
like vinegar.  Any suggestions!
