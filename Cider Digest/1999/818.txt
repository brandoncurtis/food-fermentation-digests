If you use a "vacation mailer" (a program that auto-responds to email when
you're on vacation), it should be set so that it does *not* respond to any
address ending in "-request".  This is a long-standing rule for how these
auto-responders should work.  The intent is to keep your "I'm on vacation"
mail from being sent to a mailing list.  Otherwise, if I don't catch the
message from your auto-responder, it gets sent to about five hundred people
around the world who certainly don't care that you're on vacation.  (I have
never been able to construct a reliable filter at my end that would catch
all vacation-mail responses.)


If you're at the mercy of an ISP with a bad auto-responder, badger them
until they fix it.  There's no excuse for a vacation mailer not to honor
the "-request" rule, and it's quite rude to send vacation notices to
mailing lists.


(I'm yapping at all of you because I got a small swarm of vacation replies
to the previous digest.)

In a message dated 99-07-09 23:08:35 EDT, you write:


<< We ferment the cider without yeast in a carboy (5
 gallon) then once cleared we rack the hard cider to two 5 gallon carboys
 and introduce about a cup of apple cider vinegar >>
There is really no such thing as fermenting cider, or anything else "without 
yeast".
Maybe you didn't add any commercial yeast, but unless some wild yeast snuck 
in, no fermentation could happen. Fermentation = yeast.
NOW , apple cider vinegar, or any other commercial vinegar, is not never ever 
a source of live active vinegar bacteria. It has been pasteurized, 
sterilized, before being marketed. It has to be. Live vinegar bacteria is not 
stable, it can continue to work, and is capable of making something very like 
fingernail polish remover. When your vinegar is finished, after saving a 
starter culture for the next batch, KILL the bacteria with heat before giving 
it to your friends. This is why it is always better to make vinegar in 
batches, and then harvest, instead of making it continuously by dribbling 
leftover wine into a culture.

To all those who came up with answers on this question for me, thanks.  It 
clarified a lot for me and now I know what to tell people I'm putting in 
their hands.  Not that they'll complain either way.  It's free and it tastes 
good, they don't complain.

I had a few problems with making a vinegar mother when I started. I put
fully fermented cider in a carbouy in a dark warm place, added some vinegar,
covered the top with muslin and waited. Six months later I still did not
have something that I wanted to put on my chips. I threw that lot away and
repeated the process and this time it produced a wonderfully repugnant cider
mother which has been working fine ever since.


I suspect that the cider I initially used might still had some residual
sugar in it which did not help and also to use less cider and more vinegar
to start with. Another point is that a lot of commercial vinegar is
pasteurised which is unlikely to help the process.
