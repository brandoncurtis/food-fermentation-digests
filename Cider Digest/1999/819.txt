There's a reasonable description of how to make vinegar 
online at


http://chattanooga.net/~cdp/vinegar.htm


Note that most recipes use three parts wine/beer/cider to 
one part mother of vinegar.  Other proportions will also 
work, but it make take a **long** time to finish 
(assuming that you don't kill the bacteria by exposing it 
to a high concentration of alcohol).  You also need to 
pay attention to the alcohol content of the 
wine/beer/cider.

I've just got myself a copy of the following (British) book published very
recently.  It's available through Amazon.


MICHAEL POOLEY AND JOHN LOMAX
REAL CIDER ON A SMALL SCALE
ISBN 1854861956  (1999)
Publisher NEXUS SPECIAL INTERESTS
Price (pound-sterling)5.95


It's a good read, well-written and also has a plan for making a small
fruit press.  I personally would recommend it as a very sound introduction
to small-scale cidermaking (and not just because he refers to my book in
the reference list!!).  A trifle 'new-age' but follow it and you'd not
go far wrong, in my opinion. It's a useful addition to the very brief
list of cidermaking books which are now in print.

Subject: How do you drink Cider?
From: Richard Anderson <baylonanderson@csi.com>

In April, I attended a Cider Workshop in Seattle. During the session on
marketing hard cider, one of the attendees remarked that one challenges
which needed to be met when distributing cider to be resold by the glass
was educating the resalers on how to serve cider. Now I  know that the
individual making the remark had some (strong) ideas on this subject,
this got me thinking.  I like to drink cider at cool room
temperature(approx. 45 - 50F), served in a tall white(6-8oz) wine glass.
One thing I particularly like is holding it to the light and enjoying
the straw/amber color.  I would be interested on what others think. How
should cider be served?


This is not idle chatter but a desire to gather some ideas on how to
market a natural dry cider from our Westcott Bay Orchard.
