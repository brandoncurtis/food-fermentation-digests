While browsing on barnesandnoble.com today I noticed another new book
that's going to be published in August:


Cider, Hard and Sweet : History, Traditions, and Making Your Own
by Ben Watson


>From the description, it appears that this is a more general book,
discussing the history and background of both forms of cider, as well as
how to make different styles (French, farmhouse, etc).

If anyone is interested, I perfer mine around 38-42F (3-6C) and highly
carbonated (4-5 units CO2).  In a pint glass.

I wouldn't drink a cidre plat (flat) in the same glass as a cidre bouche
(sparkling). For a cidre plat, I use the same as you - a tall white wine
glass. For a cidre bouche, I like mostly the "flute a Champagne", which is
tall and very narrow.
When in camping or in other unhandy place for fancy glassware, I settle for
a Coke or a plastic glass and it does the job all right...
As of temperature, I think ideal is a little more than half an hour in the
refrigerator, taken from my cave which is at a temperature of about 60 deg
F / 15 deg C. I guess the temperature would be around 50-55 F / 10-13 C.

Wout Klingens <wkling@knoware.nl> and I just took a (too short)
week-long trip through Brittany (France) looking for mead and
cider. We found both in great abundance and variety. I found
my favorite to be what I call "Breton farm cider", which is a
hearty, cloudy, bottle fermented, slightly carbonated nectar,
although many other varieties, clear, cloudy, still and sparkling,
were available from both Brittany and Normandy.


The Bretons serve their cidre in plain coffee cup, the kind that
are shaped like a half of an orange with a handle. However,
when I ordered in a bar they would usually serve it in a tall thin
wine glass. Last Sunday evening, while waiting for a restaurant
to open I ordered a cidre for us both and asked for a "grande".
He brought it in two .5L beer glasses, like the pint glasses you
see Guinness served in. The cidre was usually served slightly
chilled.


Cidre on tap was served in many bars and restaurants and
when I asked them to show me what they were serving it from,
they showed me that it came from a standard beer keg.


Most supermarkets carried several brands/kinds of cidre and
Wout even found some in a plastic 1L bottle just you find soft
drinks in. In bars and stores it was generally very inexpensive.
At one Breton farm where the made and sold cidre, I got three
750cl bottles for 40f, about $2 a bottle!


It was wonderful...

Surely part of the answer to this depends on the style of the cider, just
as the serving temperature and appropriate glass for wine depend on the
type of wine.


I would serve a sparkling cider colder than a still one, but in any case
I'd choose a temp in the neighborhood of what I'd use for white wine.


Richard, calling 45-50F "cool room temperature" is likely to confuse.  In
the US in particular, "room temperature" tends to mean 68-72F; thus "cool"
will be taken to mean low-to-mid 60's (like "cellar temperature" as you'd
serve a good red wine).


A clear glass or crystal shows off the color of the cider, and yes I think
that's important.  I've seen photos of antique cider glasses that are
narrow, fluted stems, rather elegant, sometimes elaborately cut and/or
etched.


In a purely mercenary sense, presentation of cider is important because it
indicates something about the status and therefore the perceived fair price
of the drink!  You won't get $10/bottle for cider served in a mug, but if
the presentation is more like a Champagne, the status and the price go up.
