One of the first concerns with any old barrel is that if it's old enough,
it may have dried out.  If the barrel has held liquid, then dried out, you
may have a lot of trouble making it tight again.


I would think the first step would be to try to re-hydrate it:  Fill it
with water and see whether it leaks.  Give it a while to absorb water and
swell before you conclude that it won't close up, but don't be surprised if
it keeps leaking.


I'm of two minds whether you should add Campden tablets to the water right
away.  On the one hand, if the barrel has been around for a while, it might
need a good dose of sanitation.  On the other hand, this would soak a lot
of SO2 into the wood and it might take a while to leave.

It depends, first whisky barrels are usually charred to mellow the
whisky. If you want to use them for wine or cider remove the top hoop,
top and remove the char with a wire brush. If the staves are really dry
and loose you may want to soak it first see if it worth the effort. I
restored an dozen or so barrels a number of years ago for a small family
wine cellar and we used them for a number of years with good results.
While cheap, whisky barrels are a high maintaince item and require
cleaning before and after each cycle. I am under the impression that
they are no longer available for reuse.
