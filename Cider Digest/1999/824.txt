It would be delightful if SO2 were that persistent. Unfortunately, the active 
component is a gas, and will escape rather than soak in. And once the salt, 
KSO4 or NASO4 is rehydrated, I'm pretty sure it loses the ability to produce 
more gas, so even if it drys out and leaves crystals it will be inactive.  


Whiskey, however, does soak in. We had a commercial barrel-shaver who got 
into quite a bit of trouble a few years back, for pressing out the booze from 
shavings and selling it. I think he got about a liter per barrel. Some people 
of a certain ethnicity got used to the flavor and would add about a fifth of 
bourbon to their red wine....

Dear friends, I have made cider for many years--in New York, Maine and now
Wisconsin. I have always used apples picked after the first frost--late fall
apples.  This year, for the first time, I am making some cider from late
summer apples.  I am wondering if anyone can advise me as to what
differences there might be.  Can I expect good quality hard cider from
apples (4 or 5 varieties) picked in late August?  (I would be more specific
about the varieties but I don't know what they are-- these are from old
abandoned orchards.)
Reagrds, Jim
