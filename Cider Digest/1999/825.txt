Hi Group,


I am buying an old house with an apple tree in the back yard.  It's
not in very good shape (needs a proper pruning) but has an enormous
amount of apples on it.


Two questions:


1 - How can I tell what variety of apples these are?


2 - Can anybody tell me the best (correct) way to prune the tree or
point me toward a Web site that can?


Thanks in advance,


Matt

my local orchard is going to start pasteurizing all their cider this year due 
to the e-coli scare. i was planning to get 5 gallons from them this fall and 
ferment it. can i still do this or will the process  interfere with my hard 
cider plans/ thanks  marc

  Apple season is just around the corner
here in the southeast.  To insure a supply of fresh,
unadulterate, unpasturized juice for cider this year
I designed and will soon construct my own small
press. I thank the many members of this digest 
for theirs ideas and insights, many of  which were
incorporated into my press.
    But before I can press those apples they need be
chopped.  So I turn again to y'all with more experience
than me to ask where can I obtain a chopper/ grinder ?
The discussion of utilizing a new garbage disposal was 
interesting and has much merit but I had more in mind
a supplier for a grinder similar to the machine incorporated
on the old basket & screw presses of yesteryear.
     Has anyone bought an apple grinder in the last few years
and if so where did you obtain it from?  All ideas and sug-
gestions are welcomed.
      Thanking y'all in advance... Mike Smith
