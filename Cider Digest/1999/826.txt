Re:    pasteurization (JPullum127@aol.com)


Frankly pasteurization will not be a problem provided you use all the
precautions  normally taken with fermenting from concentrate.  I would look
for a pH of 3.4 or lower.  I would inoculate with a good commercial yeast
 I would suggest a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain as a safe and dominant
choice) and I would also add yeast nutrient.  One advantage could be less
need for sulfiting.
A much better idea would be to convince your local cider mill to sell you
the five gallons fresh before he runs it through a pasteurizer.  You can
point out there is little risk of e-coli surviving the rigors of
fermentation.
I have in fact fermented thousands of gallons of  flash pasteurized  apple
juice.  I cannot say it was the best but it certainly was drinkable - fruit
characteristics were lacking somewhat.
Another negative - pasteurizing is a fairly exact science - if your supplier
is not practiced he will have a tendency to "overcook" - this causes a
bitterness from the caramelization.
The bottom line - try to convince him that you need fresh juice!

my local orchard is going to start pasteurizing all their cider this year due 
to the e-coli scare. i was planning to get 5 gallons from them this fall and 
ferment it. can i still do this or will the process  interfere with my hard 
cider plans/ thanks  marc


Marc,
I would avoid using pasteurized cider for fermentation.  Ask the local 
orchard if you can drop off a carboy or keg to fill when they make cider
again.  Have them fill your container before any treatments are done.
This has worked with me in the past.

Do you have a schedule of cider conferences/competitions?
Where can I get a list of past attendees and competition placings?


Thank you Samgow@aol.com

My favorite local cider place has just put in a "flash" pasteurization 
setup.  They claim that a big prize winner (first?) in a cider
competition in New Mexico had used this type of pasteruized apple
juice.  They are also going to sell un-pasteurized juice if one calls
ahead to order it.


The pasteurized may be a better way to go, if you wish to control your
yeasts.  


However, I'd taste the juice before buying to avoid "cooked" flavor and
make sure that the process used was truly a "flash" pasteurization with 
very quick cool down, to insure the best quality juice.


Or try calling ahead to order un-pasteurized juice?

Re: Orchard in Danger:


I received many responses to my SOS about the orchard in danger. I spoke
with the owner, and he has allowed me to write the following list, and to
include his name and address.  
 


The James McCannell Orchard
556 Algoma Avenue
Box 34
Port McNicoll Ontario
L0K 1R0
705-534-7384


Port McNicoll is located on the south shore of Georgian Bay, 150 km north
of Toronto. The following is a list of apple varieties in James&rsquo;
orchard. The majority of James' apples came from the Museum Orchard in
Vineland Ontario in 1984. When James heard that the Ontario government had
ordered the orchard cut down, he went there and took as many cuttings as he
could, and grafted them to his trees at home. When he ran out of space, he
finished by grafting 26 different varieties on to one tree. They all took!
This is an amazing tree to behold! He has since removed some, but the tree
is still producing 18 different varieties of apples! For any additional
information on the trees and varieties, and the availability of cuttings,
please contact James directly.


Alexander, Baldwin, Baxter, Ben Davis, Blenheim Pippin, Blue Pearmain,
Bottle Greening, Cabashea, Canada Red, Chenango, Collingwood Greening
(Rhode Island), Colvert, Cortland , Cranberry Pippin, Duchess, Fallawater,
Gano, Golden Bough, Golden Delicious, Golden Russet, Granny Smith,
Gravenstein, Grimes Golden, Haas, Hislop Crab, Hubbardston, Kentish
Fillbasket, King, Lady, Macintosh, Maiden Blush, Mann, Margaret Pratt,
McMahon, Milwaukee, North Star, Northwest Greening, Ontario, Primate,

Melba, Rescue Crab, Ribston Pippin, Rome Beauty, Roxbury Russet, St.
Lawrence, Scarlet Pippin, Seek-No-Further, Snow, Spitzenberg, Spy, Stark,
Swayzie (Pomme Grise), Sweet Bough, Tolman Sweet, Twenty Ounce ( Cayuga Red
Streak), Viking, Wagener, Wealthy, Winesap, Winter Banana, Wolf River,
Yellow Bellflower, Yellow Transparent, York Imperial.


If anyone in Canada wants cuttings, now is your chance.


Thank you all for your interest,
Elizabeth

Marc,


You will have to pitch a yeast on pasteurized cider.  I have found various ale
yeasts (e.g. Whitbreads) do very well.  Sherry and champaign yeasts will
ferment to bone dryness and can be primed for sparkling cider, if that's what
you like.
