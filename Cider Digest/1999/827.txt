With our local appling season upon us, I was wondering about the methods
of pasteurization.


With milk I had been told that there are 2 methods:  The first, to
bring  the milk up to a high temperature for a very short period of time
and then cool rapidly, and the second, to hold the milk at a lower
temperature for a longer period of time.  With my tasting, the low
temperature pasteurization tastes better.


I wish to "ciderize" my fresh juice by partially fermenting it in the
refrigerator to a flavor I like (not worried about alcoholic content). I
will check to make sure the pH is in proper range for water bath canning
and then put it in sterilized glass quart jars, cap with sterile lids
and rings and then process in a low temperature (low as above under
"second method") hot water bath to preserve it without refrigeration.


I am familiar with home canning procedures, both pressurized and
boiling/simmering water bath.  


1.  Am I correct in assuming that the low temperature pasteurizing will
preserve a better flavor?


2.  What is the best temperature and time combination to do this canning
in a "low temperature" hot water bath?


3.  Do I bring cold cider gently up to pasteurization temp and hold it
there or do I heat the juice in a pot first, jar it and then place in
already heated water?


4.  Can I use non-screw type beer bottles, cleaned, sterilized and
sealed with new pop-bottle/beer style caps to do this water-bath
preservation?


5.  Is there anything else I need to think about to do this?


Thanks for the help. . .

Hi,
I just bought a house that has a pear tree. I have no home brewing,
wine-making or cider-making experience, but I'd like to try making some pear
cider. So basically I need to know everything--equipment, techniques,
ingredients, recipes--for turning pears on my tree into a glass of cider in
my hand. 
 
Is there a definitive book on the subject? Two books that I've found online
that look promising are "The Art of Cider Making" by Paul Correnty, and
"Cider: Making, Using & Enjoying Sweet & Hard Cider" by Proulx and Nichols.
However, both of those appear to focus on apple cider. Is that a problem if
I want to learn about pear cider, or do the same principles apply?
 
The main questions I have at this point are: 
How do I identify what type of pear tree I have (European or Asian)?
Does the type of pear matter for making cider?
When do I harvest?
How do I juice all those pears?
 
 
Thanks for any help,
Brian
