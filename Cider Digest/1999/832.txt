"The Art of Cidermaking" by Paul Correnty (Brewers Publications, Inc. 1995) 
is a pretty unintimidating way into the hobby. Check your local homebrewing 
shop (yellow pages under beermaking or winemaking supplies) or order through 
a bookstore.  The homebrewing shop can also be a terrific resource for 
information -- even if the proprietor doesn't know much about cider, (s)he 
will know about equipment, sanitation, etc.  Good luck & welcome!

Kevin:


The folks on this list tend to get into the small, nit-picking details 
about cider-making.  If this was an automobile discussion list, the 
discussions would be about adjusting engine timing, rack-and-pinion versus 
power steering, and whether or not anti-lock brakes are safer than 
standard brakes.  


This is not to say that such discussions are not interesting, but they 
don't help much when you just want to learn to drive!


Making cider is fun and easy.


Let me say that again: making cider is fun and easy.


You'll need the same equipment as for beer- or wine-making.  Many such 
kits are widely available.  They should include:


1 7-gallon food-grade plastic bucket with airtight lid.  The lid needs a 
hole bored in it.  This is your primary fermenter.


1 5-gallon glass carboy.  This is your secondary fermenter.


Siphoning hose (flexible plastic tubing with a clamp-lock)


Racking cane (rigid plastic tube)


Water-lock (device used to release excess gas pressure from the chamber 
without letting air back in)


Rubber stoppers for above-- one for the carboy, one for the bucket.


Hydrometer (device used to measure density of a liquid)


Bottle brushes


Bottle caps or corks


A supply of bottles-- beer bottles or wine bottles both work fine.


Bottle capper or corker


Sanitizing solution (household beach is cheapest and works fine)


The whole set-up should set you back about $50 - $75.  This is a one-time 
expense, unless you accidently break equipment.


Ingredients for five gallons of cider:


5 gallons of unpreserved sweet apple cider.  Unpasteurized is 
best, but pasteurized is OK.  Be absolutely sure there are no 
preservatives in the cider, particularly sorbates.


2 packets active dry brewers or wine yeast. 


Procedure:


1) Wash and sanitize your plastic bucket with a bleach-water solution.  I 
use about half a cup of bleach per three gallons of water.  Rinse with 
plenty of clean water.


2) Pour your cider into the bucket.  Open up the packets of yeast and 
sprinkle them on the surface of the cider.  Wait about five minutes, then 
stir the cider vigorously with a sanitized spoon.


3) Put the lid on the bucket and attach the water lock.


4) Wait five days.  You should observe the cider foaming up, the 
water-lock "blurping", and the aroma of fermentation.


5) Wash and sanitize the carboy.  Rinse with plenty of clean water.


6) Siphon the cider from the primary to the secondary fermenter.  Leave 
the sludge at the bottom of the primary.  Attach the water lock.


7) Wait about a month.  You now have hard cider.  Bottle and enjoy!


Cheers!
