Quick question: picked up a bottle of imported cider from the LCBO in
Ontario, the name escapes me right now. One thing I noticed is there was a
distinct aroma and almost taste of what appeared to be bacon??? Couldn't
figure it out. Weird...will get the brand soon...

Well I ground apples Saturday.  We wound up with about 30 gallons of cider
and I began my foray into cidermaking.  I make beer regularly, but just to
be safe, I only began with 10 gallons of cider in my fermenter.  The cider
was a very nice blend of several apples, kings, transparents,  ida red,
gravenstein, and one from out in my field which is very tart and wonderful,
but I have no idea what it is.  It is a very late apple, bright yellow with
kind of a red crown and or red freckles over a good portion of it.  It is
also very tart, gave a nice depth to the cider.  Anyway, I sulphited with
potassium metabisulphite, pectic enzyme.  Added 10 lbs sugar to bring it up
to 1.075.  Let it set over night and pitched about a quart of actively
bubbling starter made with montrachet last night.  By this AM, it was
beginning to get a nice cap on it, so all looks well. 
I'll keep you posted.

I also heartily recommend Paul's book.


Here in New England, virtually all the homebrewers are also cider,
cyser, and in some cases, mead, makers. The Boston Wort Processors and
Brew Free or Die have a big cider picnic every year where we pick up
this year's juice and sample last years ;-)  Every year, I get someone
who has never made cider to give a cider making demo. It's always a big
hit. After just a few minutes, the newbie has a batch of cider in the
fermenter ready to take home. Anyone who thinks it's hard to make cider
gets convinced by these demos. This year, our official "cider virgin"
made three gallons of classic New England Barrel cider in under five
minutes! Into a sanitized carboy, she put 1.7 cups of mixed white and
brown sugar and three gallons of fresh cider. Installed an airlock, put
some water in the airlock, capped it, took to her car to take home. You
can make it more complicated than that if you want to, but you sure
don't have to.

England Cider" to see a more thorough discussion.

I'm looking at an ad from a local liquor store.  The stuff on sale is
divided into categories, of course--gin, rum, tequila, wine, etc.  Cider
falls under the heading "Non-Alcohol, Ciders, & Wine Coolers".  In fact,
the sale items do proceed from some plausible ciders through Hornsby
"cider" and Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers at the end of the list.


Cider looks to be in the Rodney Dangerfield role here.
