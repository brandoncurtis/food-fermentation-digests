Jeff Peters asked about the 'bacon' flavour in French cider.  This is
typical of good quality naturally conditioned bittersweet ciders which
have undergone a malo-lactic fermentation.  The lactic acid bacteria
break down the non volatile phenolic 'tannins' in the cider to give
volatile phenols like ethyl phenol and ethyl guiacol.  In small balanced
quantities they are a definite and positive quality factor in ciders. 
In too high a concentration they are a definite and unpleasant taint.


Moderation in all things!!

Cidermakers,


Dick Dunn ponders the heading "non-alcoholic"
being applied to cider.  In South Carolina, wine
less than 14% alcohol, beer less than 5% and
other items ( don't recall that hard cider is
specifically  mentioned in the regs) are listed
as "non-alcoholic" . I presume this is so they
can be sold in the grocery store. Cider is
available in the grocery store, so I presume
it too is classified as non-alcoholic.  Due to
the higher alcoholic content, sake has to be
sold in the same store that sells distilled liquors,
as do many aperitifs.


I'm glad I'm not a politician and lawmaker.

My name's Dave Matthews and I'm the Editor of CAMRA's new Cider Guide, a
guide to Britain`s cider makers and where their cider can be found.


I would like to include features on cider in other countries, and so am
looking for people to write them. If you are interested, please email me
on 1bethan@talk21.com, and we can discuss details.


Cheers,

Subject: how best to add sugar?

I've just pitched the yeast into my first batch of cider and am waiting
anxiously for the bubbling to begin.  The must has a S.G. of 1.050, which
I'd like to bring up a good bit, but I'm wondering what the preferred
method of adding sugars is.


As it's my first attempt at cidermaking (or fermenting anything, for that
matter) I'm not inclined to be particularly experimental, and plan to use
plain old granulated cane sugar.  Should I simply dump the appropriate
amount of dry sugar directly into my carboys, or would I be better off
cooking-up a simple syrup and allowing it to cool before pouring in?  Or
does it make any difference at all?

Not at all.  I ponder cider being lumped into a miscellaneous category
_with_ non-alcoholic beers and wine coolers (which _are_ alcoholic).
It's not the matter of alcohol or not, since 2 of the 3 items under the
heading are alcoholic; it's the matter of cider ending up in the "well, we
don't really know what to do with this" category.


Cider has a long way to go in the US in terms of understanding and respect.
