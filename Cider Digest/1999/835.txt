Caton, at 1.050 S.G., I wouldn't add any sugar. Actually, my lower limit is
about 1.048 and I would only add sugar to a juice that has a S.G. lower
than that number to bring it up to about 1.050.
Although most of my batches naturally have a starting S.G. between 1.055
and 1.065, I have made excellent ciders with S.G. around 1.048-1.050.
If you really insist in increasing the sugar content, I think it is better
to make a syrup than to dump in the granulated sugar. I also think it is
better to add dextrose than granulated sugar. However, if I have to add
sugar, I would do it before starting the fermentation.

Cidermakers:


Caton asks about the method of adding sugar.
Always boil the sugar in some water and cool it.
There are two reasons.


 1) sugar is loaded with bacteria, which are inactive,
but upon dilution can infect a brew.


2) Believe it or not sugar will not readily dissolve
in a fermenting brew without stirring. I know this
from experience. And you do not want to shake
up a fermenting mixture or it may overflow.

I am responding to a post on the Cider Digest about adding sugar to cider.
I would mix the sugar with enough water to dissolve it, bring the mixture
to a boil, and allow it to cool.  There is a risk of carmalization.  Also,
you may end up diluting your cider by adding water.  The
alternative is to have some risk of contamination if dry sugar is added
directly to the cider.

Hi Group,


Is fermented cider is like beer in that nothing that can hurt you can
live in the final product.  This question comes the day after
beginning the ferment of 5 gallons of fresh pressed cider with it's
own yeast.  I didn't sulfite, pasteurize or anything.


Information will be greatly appreciated.

A S.G. of 1.050 seems quite respectable to me, for a cider.  Otherwise, you are
looking at an apple wine, or a cyser, both of which are good choices, as well.


> ... plan to use plain old granulated cane sugar... or would I be better off

I would use either a simple syrup (for apple wine), or honey (for cyser), and
then mix one part of this with two parts of your already fermenting must.  Once
that is thoroughly mixed it can then be added to your carboy.  This will allow
for an easier and more thorough mixing in the carboy so as not to have all of
the sugars sink to the bottom.


In the future, it is easier to add your additional sugars before pitching the
yeast, unless you are trying for a high gravity (> 1.100), high alcohol wine,
in which case syrup feeding throughout the fermentation is the best way to
proceed.

Greetings all!
Woodchuck has brought out a new cider which they call "colonial". My
wife tasted some and was impressed with the flavor. It appears that the
big change here is the fact that they used oak in fermentation. I plan
on adding about an ounce of american white oak for about a week to a
cider and a cyser this year. I have used this amount in the past with
beer and gotten flavor just at my threshold levels.  I figure it will be
more prominent in cider. I would be interested in anyone else's comments
on the use of oak and oak chips in cider or cyser.
