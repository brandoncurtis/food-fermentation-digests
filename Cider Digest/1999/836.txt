Subject: There shouldn't be any health risks in fermented cider.

Fermented cider is like beer, in that nothing dangerous will grow in it
once fermentation is well underway.
Alcohol will kill pathogens.  Yeast can also outcompete other bacteria that
may cause health problems.  This is one reason for pitching as active a
yeast as possible and getting fermentation started as soon as possible
after pitching.


The reasons for sulfiting or pasteurizing cider prior to fermentation have
to do with preventing the growth of bacteria that can cause off flavors.
Beer is not sulfited or pasteurized prior to
fermentation because of the relatively long boil times required for hop
utilization.  It would be redundant to sulfite or pasteurize beer prior to
fermentation.

If you are going to add sugar (as in sucrose - white granulated table sugar) I
seem to recall the desirability of boiling the sucrose with a little citric acid
so as to convert it into an invert sugar, which I think is supposed to be more
easily fermented than plain old sucrose. Does anyone else know whether this is
the case, or can supply the more detailed chemistry involved? I seem to recall
it having something to do with dextrose and laevulose.  (not that I'd add sugar
either)


Oh, and AFAIK, if you add honey it is a Cyser.

Subject: Keeving - magic enzyme?
From: Tim Bray <tbray@mcn.org>

I recently went back and re-read Roy Bailey's Web article about the keeving
experiment.  If I read the chart aright, the batch that proceeded the
slowest was the only one that received a full dose of the unspecified
"enzyme" that was procured from a French source by Andrew Lea.  The batches
that received less enzyme, with calcium chloride, fermented slower but
ended up at the same SG as the "control" batch.


So, it looks to me like the CaCl2 does not have much effect - whereas the
effect of the enzyme is pronounced.  My question is: What is this enzyme,
and is it available in the USA?  Is it similar to the "pectic enzyme" used
for canning?


Thanks,

Greetings,


For those only on the Cider Digest, I am Phil WIlcox I have been brewing for 4
years or almost 100 batchs of Beer, Mead, and one Cider. So, while I am new to
Cider making I am no stranger to fermentations.  This however, is not true of my
new friend Ed. Ed owns a successfull mature orchard about 15 miles outside of
Jackson, MI. His winter "project" is to set up a small commercial Cider
operation.


The first thing I did for Ed was send him to the best homebrew shop around and
have him purchase all the books he could find on the subject. He found three,
and was reading them by the next time I saw him. He also has put alot of bushals
of apples into cold storage so he can take them out and press them this winter
after he has the "Cidery" all set up. This tells me that he is serious about his
"winter project."


Ed, has offered to host a brew club meeting at the Cidermill and have us help
him do experiments in cider makeing this winter. This is all I personally have
invested in this endeavour.


I made one batch of Cider 4 years ago, A raspberry cider at that. This past
Friday I started a 5 gal batch by combining the following:


5 gal Cider from Ed's Orchard
2.5 tsp pectin enzyme
1 tsp yeast energizer
1 tsp grape tannin
2 tsp Acid blend
10 gm Windsor Ale yeast (properly Proofed)
O.G. 1.051
I would have oxygenated, but was out of O2, so I just shook like hell...It was
happily bubbling away the next morning.


I am considering doing some splitting of this batch and adding some raisons to
one, and a l/2 lb of brown sugar to another.


How did I do?


I have been on the web searching for infomation that will be of help to and
found this excellent site in England.
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/left.htm
Its really a web published book IMHO. An an awesome one at that! Thankyou Andrew
Lea!!

In short, we need your help. What can i as the homebrewer do to help Ed the
Most?
Can anyone recommend a series of ciders I should try to make in order to feel
comfortable with the spectrum of ciders?
Can anyone tell me where I can find the legal restrictions to starting a
commercial cidery in Michigan?
Is there anyone out there who has started one themselves?


With sincere thanks and hope,
