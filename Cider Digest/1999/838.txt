I see no reason to "sterilize" your apples prior to pressing, and in fact
question how you would even do so short of a 30-minute chlorine soak
(blechh!).  Many of the apples I use in my cider are windfalls, some even
in grazed areas with cow or horse patties sprinkled about.  I would not
serve a commercial sweet cider made from said apples, but the magic of
fermentation will kill off any pathenogenic bacteria (E.coli 0157:H7) that
may have existed in the juice.  I should point out now that I do not use
fruit that have feces directly on them, but just rolling through the grass
is a vector for said bacteria.  If you plan to sulfite the must before
fermentation there should be no need for complicated washing procedures:  a
good rinsing with a hose and sorting out of nasty ones while loading them
in the grinder should suffice.
As a matter of fact I used the apples collected in the pasture orchards
descibed above, pressed on a twenty-year old press which has NEVER been
sterilized, fermented without any adjuncts (including sulfites, cultured
yeasts, etc.) in glass carboys and a 55 gallon juice concentrate barrel.
Some folks on the list would cringe at this, but since I've started using
exclusively natural yeasts and unmanaged apples, my cider has turned out
much, much better.  I want to stress that the yeasts which I believe are
doing the fermenting are present on the press and racks primarily, which is
the reason for not sterilizing them.  I also must say that said press has
three open-topped 400 gallon vinegar vats directly behind it.  Am I worried
about acetification in my cider?  No, because I do not allow oxygen into
the cycle.  
Now onto the scab question:

Good job in looking up the life cycle apple scab.  Now for what it does to
your trees and cider.
Apple scab (Venturia inequalis) is a very important and economically
devastating disease in nearly all parts in which apples are grown.  In my
are (Northeast, Vermont specifically) it is the #1 pest management priority
of commercial growers.  Its primary damage is done by reducing the cosmetic
value of the fruit.  This has no effect on the fruit's cider qualities
whatsoever.  The other effect it can have is a general weakening of the
tree resulting in reduced yield, slower growth, and possibly a reduced
lifespan.  Should you start spraying Captan willy-nilly over your trees?
Absolutely not!  Apple trees will do fine without spraying, generally,
especially large, established ones.  The fruit you get may be scabby and
wormy, but it will also be free of spray residue.  I am not against
spraying- I am a commercial orchard manager myself and tend to many
client's home trees.  I just do not feel that harsh chemicals belong in
people's backyards applied by less-than-well-trained applicators.  Just
like a good deer rifle, pesticides (organic and inorganic) are an important
tool in wildife management, but they must be used with respect.  Especially
in California.
So I would use your scabby apples with abandon, and if you are really
interested in maitaining a spray program on your trees, learn the facts as
you have wisely done with apple scab.  Any further questions on pest
biology will be happily answered.

Hi Tim!


The fact is that apple seeds (and seeds of peach, cherry, apricot, pear,
plum, and citrus fruit) contain small amounts of hydrocyanic acid. For
peach the concentration is 2% to 4%. The poison is released when the pits
are crushed.


"Dworkin" on MLD quotes "Suicide and Attempted Suicide", by Geo Stone as
saying apples contain about "0.6 mg hydrogen cyanide (HCN) per gram of dry
seed. Since the lethal dose of HCN is estimated to be about 50 mg, you need
around 85 grams (3 ounces) of dry seeds" to kill yourself.  (Stone also
claims the poison will dissipate if the solution is exposed to air.)


IIRC, John Kingsbury's "Poisonous Plants of the US and Canada" cited the
example of the only documented death of a human from eating apple seeds.  A
grown man ate a cupful of toasted apple seeds in one sitting & died of
cyanide poisoning.


Some older recipes for cherry wine instruct us to crush the pits to add a
little "kick" to the wine. Apples presses don't chop up the seeds the way
your disposal does.  If the juice smells or tastes of almonds you're
getting some cyanide released into the juice.  You can have a sample tested
if you're worried.  But a cupful of seeds diluted in 11 gallons of cider
probably won't hurt you.


Regarding your windfall apples -- do you have deer in your yard? --have
your dogs s--t near the tree?  I'd discard any damaged apples, & wash the
rest of the drops in a weak bleach solution, & then rinse in clean water.


Warmest Regards,


Cindy

Subject: Why unpasteurized Cider?
From: Matthew Comstock <mccomstock@yahoo.com>
Date: Thu, 2 Dec 1999 09:50:50 -0800 (PST)


Greetings.
Bottled my first batch of cider last night.  It was a breeze of a
batch.  I simply boiled 2.5 pounds of honey in a gallon of water for a
couple minutes and added it to 4 gallons chilled, store-bought, Indian
Summer apple juice.  Blasphemy?  The Juice was preservative free and
had ascorbic acid added, but was not a 'made from concentrate' juice. 
But it was pasteurized.  I often see recipes where people make a point
of using "unpasteurized" juice or cider.  I was looking at a low
gravity cider and I pitched a couple packs of Nottingham.  After a
short lag time and a couple days of fairly active of fermentation the
stuff kept bubbling slowly for about two weeks.  The stuff going in the
bottles last night tasted great.  Anyway, could someone point out the
difference between using pasteurized or unpasteurized juice -
especially where I am trying to avoid spontaneous fermentation by using
*my own* choice of yeast.  Preservative free seems more important. 
Thanks for the info and sorry if I've asked an oft repeated question -
just signed on.

Tim Bray asked about the cyanide present in apple pips (which comes from
the breakdown of a glucoside called amygdalin).  The only data I can
find puts the level at about 1 part per million - trivially small!  It
is much higher in kernels from apricots and almonds.  Indeed there is an
official European limit on the cyanide present in almond paste which I
think runs at 50 parts per million. So absolutely nothing to worry about
in apples or cider!

 Tim Bray asked about the effect of apple scab on cider.  In my
experience it has no effect (unless so severe that the trees are
defoliated, of course!).  A lot of traditional cider Pomonas have
pictures of fruit showing typical symptoms e.g. see picture of Foxwhelp
from the 19th century Herefordshire Pomona at
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/scab.jpg


It could even be argued that some infections stimulate the fruit to
produce flavourful secondary metabolites to fight the organisms and may
therefore even benefit the cider!
