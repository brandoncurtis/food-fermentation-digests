Subject: Digests across the Y2Khasm

Regarding the digest and concerns over Y2K potential-problems:  I think
we're OK here and upstream.  However, since the digest is not a daily event
anyway, and since it is non-essential in the grand scheme of things, there
won't be any digests until after the Y2K boundary to allow a time period
for the world to settle.  The next digest probably won't appear until 2
January even if everything is cool, or as long after as it takes to get a
few articles.  Given the usual publication schedule [*Schedule*?!?], this
should be a hardly-noticeable delay, and it will keep us out of the way of
more important matters (and problems).


There were no other articles waiting for the digest at this time.
