        My son and I added a half a medium length ginger root to a 6 pound
skrumpy must that turned out quite well. Just enough ginger to add zip
without overpowering the cider.

     Howdy Melissa:
      I saw your post to the Cider Digest.  Ginger and apple...it's a great 
flavor marriage.  I made a cyser with ginger last year.  Bottled it this fall
for drinking at the holiday season.  Three pounds of honey dissolved in a
gallon of fresh juice,  one ginger root peeled and pureed, premier cuvee
yeast, fermented to dryness, bulk aged a year, added a bottle of Chaucer
Sweet Mead at bottling for sweetness and body.  Result: a very intense
licquor, best as an afterdinner drink, an excellent medicinal for sore throat.
Next batch?  I'll do it again increasing the honey for residual sweetness & 
more alcohol content.
      Advice?  Be careful with the ginger...it's a powerful herb!
Mike Smith
