Some time ago, I investigated on the different ways to express titrable
acidity.


Acidity kits sold in wine supply stores in North America use a N/5 solution
of Sodium Hydroxide for titration. If you use 1 ml of this solution to
neutralize a sample of 1.5 ml of apple juice (or 10 ml in a sample of 15
ml), then the titrable acidity can be expressed as:
        10 g of tartric acid / litre or 1 % acidity
        6.5 g of sulfuric acid / litre (0,65 %)
        8.9 g of malic acid / litre (0,89 %)
Tartaric acid is the standard american scale for wine. In France, they
usually use the sulfuric acid scale. The malic acid scale is sometimes used
for apple juice.


Note: Wine testing kits normally provide a syringe to measure a sample of
15 ml of juice and also to measure the quantity of sodium hydroxide
solution, which can be around 10 ml per test. If you buy yourself at a
drugstore a smaller syringe - I use a precision 1 ml syringe that is
normally used for insulin - you can use 10 times less solution per test and
still have the same precision...

Thanks to Dave Burley for some great info. There are, however, some 
additional points I have discovered. 
A. Different acids taste different. Ciders contain mainly malic with 
some citric, and sometimes lactic acids. While malic acid is the one 
that most cidermakers will recognize on their palletes, it varies quite 
a bit from the taste of citric (more sharp) and even more from lactic 
(much less sharp). The acid in wines is tartaric (60-90%) with most of 
the remainder being malic with some citric or perhaps succinic, pyruvic 
and other minor acids. Almost any fermented beverage will also contain 
at least some amount of acetic acid. All these acids taste differently 
and the unique combinations of them have a large effect on the flavor 
of wines and ciders. In addition to the above is the fact that citric 
acids tend to be metabolized by fermentation and thus lost in the must 
while lactic, succinic and pyruvic acids are increased to some extent 
by the fermentation process.
B. The level of alcohol and residual sugars in the beverage will 
greatly change the perception (taste) of the acids present. Generally, 
higher alc. and sugar levels compliment higher acid levels. This is why 
most wines (11-14% alc) have much more acid than beers or ciders and 
why sweet or slightly sweet wines and ciders can and generally do have 
more acid than their dry counterparts.
   The point of all this to me is that making great cider or wine is 
not like making kool-aid and if you really want to become an "expert" 
then you must make and taste lots of it over a period of years. I could 
think of worse!    Bob Sorenson
