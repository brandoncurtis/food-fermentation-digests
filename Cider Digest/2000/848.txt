I am located in the Williamette Valley some 50 miles south of Portland, Or.  
Could anyone direct me to  information on the growing and purchase of perry 
rootstock in the U.S.?  Is there anything currently published on perry pears 
and the process of making 'Perry'.  My web searching has turned up the 
Gillian@Grafton web site and nothing further. Pretty well written but I am 
interested in getting some trees.


Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Has anyone run across a comprehensive directory of apple cultivars
(preferably online) that attempts to provide numerical values for
acidity, sugar content, and tannin levels?  The more I read, the more
I'm finding the traditional labels of "sweet," "sharp," "bittersharp,"
"bittersweet," etc., confusing because different companies and authors
sometimes classify the same cultivar in different categories, or use
potentially ambiguous terms such as "mild subacid."


(p.s. Thank you to those of you who responded directly to my request
last month for cider cultivar suggestions for USDA region 5.  I would
have thanked you more personally, but my e-mail system crashed,
deleting your online addresses.)
