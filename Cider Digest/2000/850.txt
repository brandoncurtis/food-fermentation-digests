Re: Perry Pears


You can obtain some perry pears from Cider Hill 
Nursery in Winchester Illionois.  Lee & Mary 
Elliott have a limited supply of 2 year old cider and
perry apples.  The evening is the best time to call
them at 217-882-2047.

Cider Hill Nursery, 217-882-2047 has 12 perry pear varieties listed as of 
November 1999.


Nick Botner in Yoncalla, OR (541) 849-2781 Has a bazillion pear varieties, 
including some perry cultivars, but you might have to wait to have them 
grafted.


Those are the only sources I have for vintage perry pears.

I don't know of anything on-line although there are various lists in old
books and papers which somebody could some day collate.  My recollection
is that 'Processed Apple Products' edited by Don Downing (AVI
Publishers) had quite a lot of data relevant to North America (but I
don't have a copy by me as I write).


One problem is that all these parameters vary quite widely year by year
although of course there are general trends which are 'real' above the
statistical noise.  Another problem is that the methods for measuring
tannin (much less so for acid and sugar) are not very accurate.  Most of
the data up to the early 1980's is based on the Lowenthal permanganate
titration which was first used over a century ago.  It's OK for what
it's good at, but is rarely used now and if you use a different method
you'll likely get a different answer (up to 2 fold error in some
cases).  Also the tannin itself can truly vary by the same sort of
amount depending on the weather and the nutrient status of the tree. 
Worth noting too that whereas a true bittersweet e.g. Dabinett can be
around 0.5% tannin, a regular dessert cultivar measured by the Lowenthal
can be < 0.01%.  That's one major reason (apart from texture) why cider
bittersweets are so special and so very different to most other apples.  


The old Long Ashton classification of cider cultivars by Barker (1903)
was simply that sweets and bittersweets had acids < 0.2%, while sharps
and bittersharps had acids > 0.2%.  Likewise bittersweets and
bittersharps had (Lowenthal) tannin > 0.2%.  The sugar level was never a
part of the classification as such since all were assumed to have high
enough gravities for the purpose.

Hi All,
Does anyone have a "mother of vinegar" culture that they wouldn't mind
sharing?
A drop or two placed on a clean piece of filter paper, wrapped in tinfoil
and sent in the mail would be perfect.




If you can spare a bit, please Email me at greg.appleyard@usask.ca
and we can make the arrangements. 




Many thanks,
Greg

Subject: this isn't perry!

A friend pointed me at the Ace Cider web page (www.acecider.com).  One link
off the home page is labeled "our perry".  The product itself is labeled
"Fermented Pear Cider".  I've had it and didn't much care for it, but
that's not the point.


The web page describes it as fermented apple juice to which pear essence is
added after fermentation.  This is not perry at all, and I don't feel that
either the label or (especially) the home-page link is reasonable.  I don't
see any excuse for "perry" or "pear cider" to be made from any fruit but
pears.
