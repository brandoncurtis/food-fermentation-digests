Greetings,  I was wondering if someone would have some insight on 
pasteurization of cider.  I am interested in making a cider of low 
alchoholic strength with some residual sugar and was wondering if the 
use of heat instead of chemicals was practical?
  BTW, the ACE apple cider sold here in Utah not only has natural 
flavorings and citric acid added, but also contains ARTIFICIAL 
FLAVORING1
  A truly disgusting product that is not fit for dog shampoo (in my 
opinion).    Thanks to all......Bob

Hello
        I've come to the list for some advises. I would like to sweeten some
of my cider just a touch. I think my cider is great but I like it so dry
that it is dusty. Basically I would like to take the "edge off". Or in other
words go from dry as dust to just dry.  
So, the question is 2 part, what is a good sweetener for cider and at about
what amount should I add for the first time. I realize that is a matter of
taste but I just need a reasonable starting point. 


Thank in advance

Thank you, Mr. Lea, for your response to my question.  I appreciate
the variables you cite.  And I would be remiss, sir, if I did not
mention that your wonderful Wittenham Hill Cider Page website,
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/frameset.htm
has been a major contributor to my interest in the subject.


You perfectly illustrated my predicament (or my ignorance, depending
upon your point of view) when you wrote: "The old Long Ashton
classification of cider cultivars by Barker (1903) was simply that
sweets and bittersweets had acids < 0.2%, while sharps and
bittersharps had acids > 0.2%.  Likewise bittersweets and bittersharps
had (Lowenthal) tannin > 0.2%."  That is interesting and useful
information.  Now if I could just find a comprehensive list showing
which varieties average +/- two-tenths of a percent...
The book you mentioned, 'Processed Apple Products' (ASIN:0442221177)
edited by Donald L. Downing (AVI Publishers), is out of print,
according to my search of Amazon this morning.  I will try to find a
copy.

These are the 1999 stats on the apples we processed at Westcott Bay
Orchards. TA is expressed as tartaric. As you would expect, the Bittersweets
such as Yarlington Mill and Dabinett have a high pH but produce a juice
which is thick with tannin. The Cox's, Northern Spy provide acidity. Next
year we hope to have several rows of Porters Perfections, and a row each of
Yarlingtons and Chisel Jerseys to add to the blend.

Like Andrew Lea, it is my understanding that the Don Downing book is a good
source of this type of information for North American apples, It is however,
fairly expensive and not easy to find in the library system. If you can
initiate a state wide search you might find it. I was not able to. I sent
Mr. Downing a note, but he was unwilling to share anything more than the
book title.
