Subject: Ace Ciders / Cider Tasting Notes
From: "Michael L. Hall" <hall@galt.lanl.gov>

I am making, slowly, a collection of notes on commercial ciders.
These include all the information on the bottle label, tasting notes,
and then a semi-objective rating. I say semi-objective because, while
I am a National BJCP judge and have judged beer, mead and wine
objectively in competitions, I have less experience with cider and
more importantly, I judged most of these ciders separately, which
doesn't allow you to compare between ciders and gives other variations
due to your body/mood changing from day to day. Also, this was not a
blind judging.


That said, after all the discussion of Ace Ciders I thought that the 
info I have on the labels might come in handy. I am including the
entire list for your enjoyment. I would be interested to hear other
opinions of commercial ciders.


Cheers,
Mike

Subject: Degorgement
From: Tim Bray <tbray@mcn.org>
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 2000 14:12:08 -0800


Having read what descriptions I can find of the "degorgement" process 
(Methode Champenoise), I am keen to try it on my experimental batch of 
cider, which I bottled too soon.  Has anyone on the list actually done 
this?  It sounds incredibly messy.  How cold does the ice-brine have to 
get, how hard does the cider freeze in the neck of the bottle, does it come 
shooting out under the pressure of all that carbonation or do you have to 
dig it out, etc.  How often do bottles break while doing this?


I bottled before the cider had completely cleared and now have a pretty 
thick layer of yeast in the bottles.  Opening a bottle causes all that 
yeast to rise and make a terrible-looking mess, not to mention the strong 
yeast flavor in the cup.  The cider has a lot of carbonation - too much, 
actually - and so if I lose a little during the degorgement it won't be too 
bad.  I assume you need to top up with fresh cider, or some fermented 
product from a sacrificial bottle, after the degorgement.


So, I would love to hear your experience with this method if you have tried it!

Tim Bray

Subject: Apples for Zone 10?
From: Tim Bray <tbray@mcn.org>
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 2000 14:46:11 -0800


Well, all the discussion of apples for Zone 4 was interesting, but I have 
the opposite problem:  my orchard is located about one mile from the beach, 
in Mendocino County, California.  The climate is transitional between USDA 
Zones 9 and 10; we get a few light frosts in December-January each year, 
minimum temperature probably about 25 F.  But we also get warm spells in 
mid-winter, when the daytime temps get over 60 F, and our typical daily 
range is from 38 to 58 F.  Frost tolerance is not an issue - chill 
requirement is!  There are no nearby weather stations that have chill hour 
accumulation data, so I have to extrapolate from daily temperatures, but I 
am guessing that we get between 300 and 500 hours of chill in an average 
winter.   (This winter?  Maybe 200...)


On the other hand, we have long cool summers, and most crops ripen about a 
month later here than inland.  Winter Banana, for example, ripens late 
October to early November; Yellow Bellflower in late November.  I think the 
neighbor's Gravensteins were ready in early October.  In this regard, our 
season is more like England than New England.


In all my references on cider apples, there is very little information 
regarding chill requirements.  Is anybody else growing cider apples in 
low-chill climates?  Is this a hopeless cause?  Should I cancel my order 
for Stoke Red, Sweet Coppin, Noel des Champs, Brown's Apple, King 
David?  Grub out the Kingston Blacks?  (OK, just kidding.)


In the absence of any information, I am going ahead with planting a few 
trees each of 30 or more varieties, in the hope of stumbling into some that 
will do well here.  If someone else has already gone through this exercise, 
it would be great to hear about it!


Thanks,
Tim Bray

Carolyn, your best source of information, if you can find it, would be
"Perry Pears", by Luckwill and Pollard, University of Bristol, UK, 1963.
The English varieties available from Corvallis are described, but not the
French, German and Romanian. However, this book is sold out but I heard
there were plans to make a reprint. Maybe also you could find a used copy.
Try www.amazon.com.


I was lucky to get my copy some 5 years ago. I guess it was one of the last
copy of the original print. If you wish, you may contact me and I could
rewrite a summary of the descriptions, or make a few photocopies for you.
