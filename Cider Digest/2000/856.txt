I have a batch of cider bubbling away in the fermenter.  Nine cans of
frozen apple juice and one can grape juice concentrate (makes for an
interesting color).  Sulfated and chilled and then about 700 ml of a
wyeast cider yeast starter.  Took about 10 hr to start bubbling away.  
Now for the question, what temp should I be fermenting at?  I can
probably achieve a range of temps from 80deg to 50deg.  Where should it
be.  Right now its at 65deg, my beer fermentation temp.

Oh my!  I didn't see you mention Spire Mountain Cider.  Lovely stuff. Brewed
in Washington. They too make apple and pear. Both are delightful.

Hmmm...

I've never measured the temparature. I use a mixture of ca. 500 g salt
(normal kitchen salt) and ca. 2 L water. I put it into the deep freezer
(or, if it's cold enough, outside over night), until it's one ice-block,
break it into peaces and put the bottles in. During degorging this mixture
becomes warmer - you will see it when it's too warm: Your cider won't
freeze any longer, and you have to freeze the mixture again.


> how hard does the cider freeze in the neck of the bottle,
Sorry for my bad english, but if this means "How much of the cider should
freeze?" the answer is: a little bit more than the yeast - if it's _only_
the yeast you are in danger to get a mess, if it's to much - well, that
doesn't really matter, but you could better drink it.

It comes out shooting.


>  How often do bottles break while doing this?
Here: never! But I use only thick and heavy bottles for this, original
"Champagne bottles". And I always wear leather handcloves and thick
clothes when doing this, and I move the bottles very carefully - I don't
care about a broken bottle and some lost cider, but I care about my
health.

That's what I've read. In fact they use liqueur as far as I've understood.
My experience: You won't have a chance to top up. First time I've ever
tried this I had to clean the whole kitchen: I opened the bottle, and
nearly _all_ of the cider came shooting out. But perhaps this is because
my cider has even more carbonation: I take only ready, cleared cider, add
some sugar and a special "champagne yeast" for a second fermentation.


This is how I do it now: 
1. In the cellar or outside, not in the kitchen!
2. Old clothes 
3. I open the bottle, don't care about the old cork, having the new cork
ready at my hand. I wait, till the ice is outside, and try to close the
bottle _immediately_ when the first liquid shoots out. After that, my
bottles are never filled up to top (some are only filled 2/3), but I never
had any problems with that fact. I let them rest for a couple of months
(the longer the better, it seems), and it's a very fine and clear
sparkling cider.


You surely know, that you have to keep the bottles bottom up for a couple
of weeks or even months before degorging, so that all of the yeast
moves to the top. To force this you have to shake the bottles often.


And if this doesn't work right at the first time, don't be afraid: I've
read that in the Champagne these are two real professions: for shaking the
bottles you have to learn 3 years, for degorging you have to learn 5
(five!) years.


Good luck,
Eckard

Gang:


Previously  I posted requesting:


"I am looking for an image of an old cider press that dates to 1800 or
before. "


I would like to amend that request with:


I am seeking images showing a portable,
one-man operated press from before 1800.  


Thank you,


        Very truly yours, Kevin(the fluffy bunny)Mathews
