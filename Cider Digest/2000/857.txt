Send ONLY articles for the digest to cider@talisman.com.

    When subscribing, please include your name and a good address in the
    message body unless you're sure your mailer generates them.

NOTE: This is a "place-holder" digest, intended to let everyone know that
the digest still exists even though there's no traffic.  If you would like
to see the digest discontinued, please remain silent.  Otherwise, please
submit some material of interest!  With a subscription list of 550 people
and no traffic in ten days, I estimate that the average reader only has
something to say every year-and-a-half.  This is not enough to sustain a
plausible digest.
   If your cider, as well as the cider of everyone you know, is perfect,
then why are you reading here?
   If your cider is less than perfect, then why aren't you asking questions?
   If your cider is perfect but you neighbor's isn't, then why aren't you
offering answers?
   Apologies to the few folks who are our frequent contributors.

I know it's that awkward time of the year when nobody's making any cider
because there's no new juice, and the only folks who are busy about cider
are out pruning trees and such...
...BUT...
...Do we really have *nothing* to say?


It worries me, as reader as much as janitor, that there's been nothing
coming in other than hideous spam that gets tossed away.
