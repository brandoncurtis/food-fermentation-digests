Folks,
   i've decided to try making apple cider.
and although i have some experience with brewing beers, it seems
like a good idea to take a sort of "practice run" before  jumping  into
using the really fresh juice, later in the year.
the question: can one make an acceptable cider, at this time of year,
using last season's stored fruit?
home is in Vancouver, so there are plenty of apples available;
although suggestions for sourcing good varieties would be welcome!
   any advice / recommendations greatly appreciated !
regards
peter g

"Brian Lundeen" <blundeen@rrc.mb.ca>
asked: Any thoughts on what sort of blend would make
for a decent cider?


In the past I have used crabs to augment the mixed dessert apples (incl.
Macintosh, Snows, pink Ladies and Golden Delicious) last year the quantity
worked out to be about 2 gallons of crabs (fruit, not juice) into the press per
25 litres of juice coming out the other end. I don't know the actual quantities
of apples that made up the juice. Based on last year's experience I'd reduce
that quantity, so I'd mix put about only a gallon of crabapples with the rest of
the apples to be juiced per 25 litres. The cider was pretty good but had a
distinct taste of crab apple in it, which wasn't unpleasant but also wasn't what
I was looking for. I have found that a straight blend of dessert apples can work
fine, but risks being a little thin, flavourwise that is.


and "Sean Cox" <sean_cox@gdt1.com>
asked: has anyone found bears to be a problem for their trees?


Bears!!! Quelle Horreur! I thought cockatoos were bad enough, but at least they
don't threaten to tear your innards out if you challenge them to a territorial
duel!

it definitely ferments dry.  I have some going right now, about 6 gal of
frozen apple juice.  I keep feeding it more and more frozen apple juice
concentrate and the yeast happily eats it all up.  I did a 600 ml
starter, fermentation started in about 24hrs.

For sure bears can be a big problem. They simply love apples. If they just
ate them, it wouldn't be so bad. The main problem is that they are not
exactly delicate when they pick the apples - they break the branch... One
year, it was really bad, and I had to bring all the apples down so the
bears wouldn't climb and break the trees - I lost a good part of the
production but the trees didn't suffer too much. Now it's not as bad as I
have neighbours that have dogs and the bears don't appreciate too much.


On the subject of varieties for zone 4, you may read my message in digest
#854 for cider apples that appear hardy in zone 4. I also like very much
Cortland - it's good to eat, good for juice and makes good cider, doesn't
have much problems except some scab but this is not a concern for cider,
and it is a good reliable producer - bears just love them... I would surely
plant 1 of the 3 trees as Cortland.

I always use Champagne yeast. Most of the time, the Lalvain EC-1118.
Sometimes also, I use the Redstar Champagne. At bottling, to get a
sparkling cider, I like to use the Redstar Prise de mousse when I can get
it (supply is scarce for Redstar yeast).

Strongbow is a very common brand in the UK. Here it is a mass produced,
sweetish, rather fizzy drink which is not held in high regard by real cider
producers. Not necessarily the same thing that you found in the Czech Republic
of course! Plenty of people seem to drink it though.


Decent ciders are not commonly found in pubs in the UK in my experience,
although you occasionally see some of the Bulmers or Westons range. In
Nottingham, where I live, we had until recently a bar called "Applejacks" which
actually specialised in ciders and perrys. Unfortunately it closed down late
last year. Sold some rather more interesting ciders too.

Sean Cox was wondering about cider varieties for zone 4. Sean, check out the
digest from 3-21-00, where Claude Jolicoeur discusses what varieties he
believes to be hardy in Quebec at about zone 4.


Brian Lundeen wondered what varieties to use when no cider varieties are
available. I'd say get the most balance blend you can between acid and
sweetness and add some crabs for a bit of tanning. You might also try some
augmenting your juice with grape tannin, or a small amount of some
astringent fruit. That's been my method the past 5 years. A couple of years
ago I added wild black cherry juice (not much, about a 2% addition). The
cherry was extremely astringent, presumably because of tannins. Anyway, I
think that batch turned out to be the best yet. I imagine that chokecherries
which I'm sure you must have around(?), would do the same thing.

Strongbow Cider - English style, named after the Anglo-Norman knight who
was invited to Ireland by one side of a local political dispute in the 12th
century; this was the incident that let the English into Ireland.  I have
had it in English pubs, but have never seen it in America.  It is a
Bulmer's`product; didn't they name one of their big tanks "Strongbow?"  You
might find more info at the Cider Surfer Arms:

You should check with the folks at Cummins Nursery in Geneva, NY.  They are
very knowledgeable and have a number of cider varieties available.

RE: Yarlington Mill fresh juice flavor, cider apples in CA, store bought juice


We (Rhyne Cyder) fermented a test batch of fresh pressed Yarlington Mill
and it looked like Guiness and tasted like Lipton tea and apple juice
together. The final product was very nice though with nice depth of flavor.
We got this apple and some Nehou (small quantities only available right
now) from Terry Harrison's Sonoma Antique Apple Nursery in Healdsburg, CA.
The Nehou fermented to a cherry red color. Very interesting in appearance
and taste. Tim Bray may want to talk to Terry about his experience with
California as he sells these old varieties and he grows them in his orchard.


As for other juices to ferment that are available in the stores, we tried
Odwalla's apple juice once but the acid was too low and the final fermented
flavor was not pleasant. We had better success with Martinelli's Apple
juice, which includes a large percentage of Newtown Pippins from Santa Cruz
county as part of the blend.


Have a good day!!

Rod McDonald asked about the difference between cider made from dessert
apples and cider apples.
I have had the experience of making cider for several years from dessert
apples and over the last four years being able to add more and more
juice from newly planted cider varieties, including Yarlington
Mill,Dabinett,Michelin and Chisel Jersey. The difference I have noticed
is a gradual improvement in the drinking and keeping qualities of the
cider. When I made cider from dessert apples only, I always seemed to
develop some off flavour or odour that I found unpleasant. As I was able
to add more cider apple juice, the problems simply disappeared and a
clean earthy character developed in the cider.I have recently had ciders
made from straight Cox's Orange in one case and a very sour green cooker
by another amateur. Both had the off tastes I now associate with
non-cider juices.
The only cider I made previously which I thought relatively good
contained a lot of crabapples. The main difference between that cider
and cider now made with cider apples is the richer colour and the full
body given by the tannin in the cider apples.
I would consider blending the Yarlington Mill juice with the dessert
apple juice. Generally a blend gives a better result than a single
variety cider.
On another subject, from the Bellingham area, it is an easy and pleasant
trip over to Vancouver Island where Merridale Cider near Victoria is
using a proportion of cider apples in theri commercial cider production.

Hi there,


last weekend a friend of mine and me finally had the pleasure to try the
result of a lot of work.  We recieved the the higher energetic form of
what used to be our cider from a small destillery.  And I have to say they
did a great job.


So what interests me know is if anybody has any hints for maturing it?

Sean:
In terms of cold-hardy cider varieties I would recommend Yarlington Mill
and Ashmeads's Kernel specifically. This is based on reports from Steve
Woods at Poverty Lane Orchards in Lebanon, NH who grows a lot of vintage
cider apples. By the sounds of it you will need to do a soil test first
and lime accordingly. Due to several reason's, including short supply at
the nurseries, I don't think you should plant this spring. You will need
one season anyway for the lime to start working, and I recommend digging
planting holes one year in advance and mixing in plenty of compost. This
will also give you time to mull over you variety choices and place an order
in the fall.

Yes, bears like apples, but not nearly as much as deer. Follow all the
usual precautions used for deer (hair bags, soap, egg spray, fencing), but
keep your rifle handy during bear season...

Tom: I have had my best luck using wild yeasts from a press that has gone
unsterilized for over twenty years!!! Yes, I have used packaged yeasts,
too, but you should stay away from the bread yeast . Generally not
considered too good for cider.....
That's my piece....still have 40 gallons to bottle off when I find the
time (too bad it's fishing season now)...
