Subject: Pruning Advice?

Having moved to a new home, we found ourselves with a nice pear tree in
the backyard.  Fruit produce was low last year but it's in flower again
and hopefully will do better this year.


I know next to nothing about caring for fruit trees.  Could someone
give me some advice on the benefits of pruning and the best way to
do this?  Thanks in advance for any help!

Maybe so. I'll have to try it again. As I said, these were all tried
on separate occasions, so the comparison numbers may be bad. The text
comments are probably more accurate.


I would really like to sit down and do a blind side-by-side tasting of
the various commercial ciders. If I do, I'll post the results.

Yes, I find that I tend to prefer ciders that taste like apples,
rather than like white wine. I don't like overly dry, acidic ciders.
I like medium dry to sweet, lots of apple character, malic and woody
notes, golden ciders. I guess that puts me in the Norman style too.

The Herout Fils and the Wild Country were definitely my favorites of
the bunch, but I can't get them locally. Thanks for the tip -- I'll
try to find the Duche' de Longueville "Muscadet de Dieppe".

Good point.

A couple months ago someone at Wyeast told me that their 
cider yeast came from France, and is indeed a cider yeast 
(not a wine yeast).  They expressed interest in the wild 
yeast that is often used in some areas of the US, but I 
have not had time to try to find a good batch of cider 
for them to experiment with (any volunteers?).

Since we will be judging meads and ciders at our competition, I 
thought this announcement might be of some interest.


Brewers, start your kettles!  Judges, mark your calendars!
 
The 6th Annual Boneyard Brew-Off will be held on June 10,
organized by the Boneyard Union of Zymurgical Zealots (B.U.Z.Z.),
Champaign Illinois. Entries will be accepted May 26 through
June 5 in all 1999 BJCP categories (beer, mead, and cider). 
We are also continuing our tradition of a No One Gets Out
Alive High-gravity category, with a hedonic judging of any
beer or mead with a starting gravity over 1.070.
 
Details are available on the World Wide Web at
<http://www.uiuc.edu/ro/BUZZ/contest6.html>. Entry forms
will be available for download, and snail-mailed out to
regional clubs and judges, in the next week or so.
Judges can sign up now on the web.
 
To receive a hard copy of the materials, send us your
mailing address.

Subject: Fermenting bittersweets
From: Andrew Lea <andrew_lea@compuserve.com>

Rod MacDonald, Bill Rhyne and others have mentioned fermenting single
variety bittersweets like Yarlington Mill and Nehou, and then being
surprised(?) by the result.


I'd just like to say that this was never really the purpose of
bittersweets.  Nobody in their right mind makes single variety
bittersweet ciders, since they are totally unbalanced to drink and of
such high pH that they're very prone to bacterial infection and hence
horrible off-flavours.  They are / were always intended for blending
with other more acid fruit.  Preferably this is done before fermentation
but otherwise as soon as possible afterwards.


That's why the very few bittersharp cider cultivars (e.g. Kingston
Black, Stoke Red, Foxwhelp) which can make a tolerable single variety
without blending have acquired such a legendary reputation (justified or
not!).


And before anyone tells me that there are a number of purportedly single
variety bittersweet ciders springing up on the UK market now - get real,
people!!  You think these guys haven't heard of malic and citric acid
from a bag, and glucose syrup from a tanker??  That's how they can blend
it off to make it balanced and pleasant to drink!

Subject: Strongbow

Phil Wilcox,
Yes we do have Strongbow here in the U.S., I had a pint of it at a pub called 
Biddy McGraws in Portland Or.
I thought it was pretty good as commercial cider goes, far better than any of 
the American pop ciders I've tasted, much drier than most.
Jo Deal in her book Making Cider (1976) states that Bulmers LTD. Hereford is 
the largest cider produccer in the world and that their most widely 
distributed product was Strongbow and that in 1975 they built a 1.6 million 
gallon tank and named it Strongbow. It was (still is?) the largest container 
for alchoholic liquid in the world.

Stuart Ing asked,
About the new Wyeast Cider yeast, I just bottled a batch that was 100% Golden 
Russet. I started it on Nov. 30, S.G.1060 it didn't blow much and fermented 
steadily right along. It had cleared by Jan. 13 and was very dry already 
S.G.904 .Last week I racked it onto 16 oz. commercial apple juice conc. and 4 
oz. cane sugar, bringing the gravity back up to 1001 and bottled . It was 
cristal clear, had good color and tasted like it will be very good in a 
couple of months. Ask me later and I'll let you know.
