The digest has been delayed a bit (as I'd warned) due to both the janitor
and his usual backup being off in England, diligently researching cider.
That done, the digest will return to its usual unpredictable schedule.

I've been using honey regularly for some years.  I find it increases head
retention slightly, smooths some sharp flavours (this depends on the
apples you use).  With a good quality light honey some nice and subtle  
additional flavours.

Interestingly enough, there's a pretty significant movement among the California
wine industry to produce blends.  After spending a lot of energy developing a
whole notion of varietal labeling and marketing, perhaps to distinguish the
'upstart' CA wines from existing French wines, it looks like we're going
full-circle and understanding why the French produce blends.  California
vintners now use the term 'meritage' to describe French-style blends, and
I believe the Meritage direction is yielding some very interesting wines (to
name a few, Franciscan Magnificat, BV Tapestry, Joseph Phelps Insignia,
Opus One, Lyeth, Ravenswood Pickberry Vineyard) as well as some very
interesting Rhone-clones (Io).


Sometime for giggles, try tasting a winery's Cabernet Sauvignon next to their
Red Meritage; at Franciscan, I did exactly this, and it was quite
interesting indeed.


All of this digression is to say: don't fret about blending.  Next time someone
asks, you can talk about a Continental approach and so on... :-)


I'll have to visit next time I'm in the area.

Honey can make a big difference, especially if it's good honey, as 
yours will no doubt be. We blend honey with many fruits and we and our 
customers notice a much improved bouquet. I think the essence of the 
honey "carries" or "projects" the other aromas to the nose. 
The honey is a more complex substance than sucrose and so will take 
longer to mature.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, we do not heat our honey or use 
sulfites and haven't failed yet to make a great product. We think heat 
compromises much of the aromatic components and use as natural of a 
product as possible.

I am a Chef at a local country Inn, and have recently been exparimenting
with the flavors extracted from my herbal, fruity, and spiced ciders and
meads.  I thought perhaps we could keep May in business, instead of the
projected down time for your digest.  If members are willing I could
answer questions on techniques of brewing cider, give my own recipes for
my consumption and cooking pleasures.  
     My passion for food has driven me to search out many different
combinations of tastes and flavors. In which I have recently combined
both (my) business and pleasure to come up with some really exotic, and
(home) out of the cupboard , grab and brew tastes & ideas.


                         sincerely,
                         Chef Houser

Subject: Pruning Advice?
From: Tim Bray <tbray@mcn.org>

Terry Bradshaw's advice is good.  I would emphasize that it is probably too 
late to safely prune a pear tree now, because of the danger of fireblight, 
depending on where you are and your local climate.  Pears are very 
susceptible to this deadly disease and pruning in the spring can spread the 
infection.  Wait until late fall or winter - January is considered the 
ideal pruning month in many areas.  If the tree is nicely shaped and not 
too dense, you may not need to do much.


If it has watersprouts (vertical shoots arising from branches), don't prune 
them, snap them off.  Pruning them will cause a bazillion more to 
appear!   You can do the same thing with suckers around the base - just 
snap them off.


Hope this helps,
Tim

Well, maybe we have a problem of definition... what is an "English" 
style?  I would certainly have thought that the most popular English cider 
was, almost by definition, an English style.

Never seen it over here (California), will look next time I cross the pond!

Certainly they have been pasteurized, and probably filtered, but they are 
closer to what I remember having in Normandy than anything else I've had here.

I'm with you there.  Alas, alackaday.

Well, technically speaking it will make a "cyser" rather than a 
"cider."  Honey being rather different from "plain" sugar, it will make a 
difference; honey has an assortment of sugars in it, some of which are not 
particularly fermentable, and of course has its own flavor and aroma, some 
of which will survive fermentation.  You can get lots more information from 
the Mead-Lovers Digest, courtesy of our beloved Dick Dunn.


  "Cider and Juice Apples: Growing and Processing" by RR Williams is an

Is this a technical publication?  How does one obtain this reference?  I 
tried several book searches but came up empty.

Subject: Alternative to Pasteurization?
From: "Roger Flanders" <flanders@probe.net>
Date: Mon, 22 May 2000 09:01:24 -0500


Under "Developments to Watch" on page 107 of the May 29, 2000,
"Business Week," is a brief article about how University of Florida
researchers are working on an alternative to pasteurization for
orange, APPLE and pineapple juice.  If their method proves practical
(read: economical), it sounds promising for those of us who have
trouble finding unpasteurized apple juices and sweet ciders for
fermenting.


The researchers mixed orange juice "with highly pressurized carbon
dioxide."  This mix was then "shunted" through a tube, where, upon
exiting, the juice is "separated from the gas, killing any nasty
microorganisms, such as salmonella or E. coli."  According to
"Business Week," the resulting juice "is indistinguishable from
fresh-squeezed" and without the "slightly-cooked" flavor resulting
from pasteurization.


Is there anyone on the list acquainted with the research who could
expand on this?

Andrew Lea said (a few digests ago) that no-one in their right mind would
ferment single variety bittersweet ciders. I wonder then how is it that BTP
Barker (from Long Ashton) in his 'Cider Apple Production' (1937) describes the
vintage qualities of 'Yarlington Mill Jersey' as "Cider of good body, aroma and
flavour usually. A superior all-round variety" (p. 73)?


Maybe there is a mid-point between the two perspectives that can be teased out?
P'raps Barker's use of the word 'usually' is the key?
