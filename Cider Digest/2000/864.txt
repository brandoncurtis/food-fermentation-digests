That remark is open to misinterpretation!

I have to say that I find some of the popular commercial ciders which
sell well and win prizes somewhat bland. But then you and the others did
comment that evening that Royal County, my cider made from a blend of
all types of apples, is better for drinking with a meal. I would agree
with that. Great with bread and cheese!

No, I loved it! (Well perhaps just a teeny bit too sharp, but preferable
to the sugary apple juice so widely marketed as 'cider'.)

Here, here! I have made a single-varietal this year from the fruit of
one tree growing in a garden. It is much less tart than Royal County,
and different from the last pressing from this tree made two years ago,
but it is distinctive and that, to me, makes it worth producing. You
should be prepared to experiment with any apple that looks interesting.
For instance, for several years I have been  trying to make a single
varietal from two wild trees growing on a disused railway embankment
near here, but I have finally had to accept that the fruit is just *too*
full of tannin to work - unless, course, one kept the result for several
years, and then who knows. So that particular supply now goes into the
blend.


While I'm writing, I must say that the day spent with Dick, Diane,
Charlie and Andrew was one of the most interesting and enjoyable I have
spent for a long time. This is the second time I have met the Dunns over
here, and I think they should make their visit to Britain an annual
event - and bring Charlie, who has a sense of humour akin to my own!

I was under the impression that he was using them in cooking rather than 
selling them as alcoholic beverages.

Bill Rhyne's Comments: Dana is correct about the popularity of blending
more than he knows, as our cider maker at Rhyne Cyder is my sister-in-law,
Benedicte Rhyne, and she is also the enologist and assistant winemaker at
Ravenswood Winery. She got her Masters in Enology from the university in
Burgundy. She grew up Provence and did a internship at Petrus where she
studied blending. Back 1990-1991,  she came over to work at Ravenswood
Winery and to work on their Bordeaux-style wines, such as Pickberry and
Rancho Salina. A lot of her job is involved with preparing the blends for
bottling. It was her and my wife's idea to ferment the apples from our yard
back in 1994 and that resulted in us pursuing the idea of making a
"French-style" sparkling hard cider made from Sonoma County apples. I think
that we are evolving to our own style though which is a little of what ever
works. She just got back from visiting family in France and she was able to
visit Duche de Longueville factory, as well as some small farmstand
producers. I have had a chance to debrief her yet.


Rhyne Cyder update: We entered our first cider judging this past May at the
West Coast Brewfest 2000 and they gave us a First Place ribbon. They said
that it reminded them of Belgian Lambic ales, some people said it had
"woody notes", all agreed that it was refreshing, especially in the 100
degree heat of Sacramento.


Aloha!

Dick, in my humble opinion this is obvious. Every commercial producer 
of cider and wine is concerned about selling their product. If you are 
selling product in the US, then you are selling to people who clearly 
value packaging over contents, for the most part. You can observe this 
same taste in popular culture and politics especially.


  But your last question remains unanswered; how to impart some 
distiction to a good blended cider?  Good question.

I make cider, and have done for a long time. I can only agree with
Andrew Lea, making cider only from bitter sweets is madness. The art of
cidermaking is the craft of blending apples. We make two single variety
ciders out of Kingston Black and Stoke Red, both bitter sharps. Julian
