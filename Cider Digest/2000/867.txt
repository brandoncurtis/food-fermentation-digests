Richard and Susan Anderson. Thanks for your comments. I plan on planting a
small cider orchard for my own use next year but worry that my Zone 7
location in South Carolina will be a problem.  Where exactly do you live?
Zone 8 as you noted is pretty warm for apples as I understand it. Maybe a
communication problem as to what you mean by Zone 8?

As to why I just subscribed... I have been a homebrewer for awhile and have
beer and wine batches behind me.  I just made up my first batch of mead last
week.  Wanted to learn more about making cider... to sort of keep things
mixed up and new in the hobby.  I subscribe to HBD as well.  I have lots of
questions, of course.


I assume I could begin a batch of cider from store bought apple juice?

It's because cider season is almost upon us! At least, that's why I
joined. While I am a long term and involved home brewer, I don't read
Zymurgy. I just love cider!


So while I'm here, I can see that y'all take cider as seriously as we do
beer on the HBD (Homebrew Digest), and so hope you can tolerate a couple
of  newbie style questions:


I made my first batch last year. We used a 60/40 mix of Golden Delicious
and Jonathan's, respectively. It was good at Thanksgiving (still WAY
underdone), and absolutely fabulous at Christmas. Folks were practically
fist fighting for it! We saved about 1/2 and bottled it, using 3/4 cup
corn sugar per 5 US gallons. My questions are:


1) It is under carbonated slightly. Is 3/4 cup a reasonable amount? Next
time I would like to prime it using juice. Anyone have a formula to
figure how much juice of what SG? I have that for brewing, is it the
same?


2) Most of the real "apple" flavor is gone. It's not as if you can't
tell what its made of, but it used to be a sock in the mouth of all
kinds of apple flavor. Is this variety of apples, or simply how it ages?


3) I think I am going to drink mine while young this year. However, I
imagine I could use campden tablets to halt fermentation, and then force
carbonate. Is this dangerous i.e.. bottle bombs? Or can fermentation be
reliably terminated? If so, can anyone point me in the right direction
for achieving this?


4) I notice that very unusual (at least for my area)  apple varieties
seem to be the norm here. I have access to TONS of apples, but of the
more common varieties. Any database I can consult about apple types?


TIA,

It was probably because you plugged it in the Homebrew Digest on June 19th.

Hi cider makers, I must be oneof these newbies, looking forward to an
interesting diversion to my beer brewing exploits.
are these 12 all from South Australia? loads of us just collected a whole
heap of juice from an Adelaide Hills crushing, now we are cider buffs! Are
there any Aussie cider digest subscribers who know which apple varieties
are best? it seems that every apple available here is an eating variety
e.g. delicious, royal gala, granny smith, fuji......
are tart, aromatic and astringent apples available here (South Australia)?
my 18 litre batch using 14 grams of ale yeast is fermenting nicely, has
dropped from 1.058 to 1.030 in 4 days at an average temp of 16 C (60 F).
which yeast do you cider experts use if you want a 'not so dry' cider, I've
avoided EC-1118 (champagne) for that reason and have read that an ale yeast
will do this, what do you reckon?

        I was wondering if you could describe the in-bottle pasteurization
process in detail for us.  I've tried this a couple of times the way Bill
Rhyne (Rhyne Cider, mmm...good stuff) describes it, I think.  Basically,
I've been putting the bottles in  room temp water and heating to 170F
(76C), hold for 1 min and remove (wearing gloves, goggles and leather
jacket).  The only problem is I haven't quite figured out how to deal with
the next batch.  The water is alread 170F, how long do I leave the bottles
in?  I have had enough physics and chemistry to know how to calculate
this, but figured asking for a ballpark figure might save me a lot of
time.

In response to Andrew Lea's view on shelf life of cider. 
I found an astonishing improvement in cider at 2 years,
although it varies from bottle to bottle. Using pure 
juice fermented by naturully occurring yeasts, I have
found that unbearable acidity and dryness softens 
toward a more balanced cider, occasionally excellent 
in quality. Even cider already balanced in ph and
sweetness develop more depth and subtlety. Opening 
a bottle is always an adventure, the whole family
can debate the merits of each one. After two and 
half years I haven't yet found a detectable loss 
of quality in storage.
