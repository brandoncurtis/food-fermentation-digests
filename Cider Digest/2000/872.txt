Subject: Non-fermentable sweeteners
From: John DeCarlo <jdecarlo@mitre.org>

Hello,


I did not notice any discussion of using stevia as a non-fermentable
sweetener.  (I can't say it qualifies as artificial, since it comes from
the stevia plant.)


As someone who cut out sugar and was wary of artificial sweeteners, I
have come to enjoy the use of stevia for coffee, tea, baking (so far,
mostly in recipes where the sugar isn't playing some other role in
volume or the like), etc.


However, I just taught a class in home soda making and found some soda
recipes that use stevia and just enough sugar to feed the yeast.


Has anyone tried this to sweeten cider?


Thanks.

True, but then I didn't say I was rational ,did I??


But seriously I do draw a definite distinction between sucralose which
is an out and out synthetic (since chlorinated sugars simply don't occur
in nature), and sulphite which is not.  Sulphite is a natural breakdown
product of sulphur-containing amino acids and of natural sulphate.  We
have enzymes in our bodies to metabolise sulphite, and many fermenting
yeasts produce up to 50 ppm without anybody ever adding it (see
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/ciderbind2.pdf for
details).  Besides which, it's been added to wines for certainly
hundreds of years, and possibly thousands, for its many beneficial
effects.  None of that is true of sucralose, useful though it may be. 
So to my way of thinking they fall into two very different categories!
