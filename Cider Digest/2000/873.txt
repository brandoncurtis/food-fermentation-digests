Just for interest, Digest readers in Britain and Europe should note that
Stevia is not permitted for sale anywhere in the EU due to doubts about
its toxicology. The following links (you need Adobe Acrobat to read the
second one) describe why:


http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/bulletin/no120/stevia.htm


http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/out34_en.pdf


Sucralose (Splenda) is not yet on sale in Europe but that's largely due
to the slowness of the regulatory committees and it almost certainly
will be soon.  It already has a provisional E number (955).

Hello All:


I am looking for a source of Rock (a.k.a. Brown Huffcap) bud-wood or
scion-wood.  I have a strong preference for a source in the USA, as I have
no desire to perform the required quarantine pushups.


I have been enjoying the many posts.


Best regards from Eaton Rapids, Michigan.

        I tried using a stevioside extract (not sure of the purity
since it wasn't listed on the label) without much success.  If I added a
lot of the white powder I gained a metallic taste in the cider.  If I
added a little the cider just wasn't sweet enough.  My tastes have changed
and since I prefer a drier cider now, the stuff that previously wasn't
sweet enough may now be to my liking.  However, since Splenda
(sucralose) is so easy to get and use, I have just continued with it.
