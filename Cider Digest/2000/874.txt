This looks like being a bad year for Kingstom Black apples in the SW of
the UK. Does anybody have any to spare? We need them for our Apple
Aperitif and are happy to pay =A3200 per ton . The Somerset Cider Brandy
Co . www.ciderbrandy.co.uk

Hello Cider Digest


This is note from Bill Rhyne in Shanghai, China. In addition to my 
activities with our business, Rhyne Cyder, I teach marketing for a business 
school in Oakland, CA with contracts to teach MBA programs in China. Earlier 
this month, I awas in Xian, Shaanxi Province. I learned some interesting 
statistics. China produces 1/3 of the world supply of apples and Shaanxi 
Province produces 1/2 of China's output.Shaanxi produces 3.5 million tons of 
apples. The other area that I have taught is in Jinan, Shandong Province 
where the apples and wine grapes are grown around the Yantai peninsula. 
Bulmers has established a joint venture with a brewery in Qifu, Shandong 
Peninsula--home of Confucius. I have seen Strongbow for sale in the pubs in 
Shanghai but the bartenders say that they don't sell very much if any of it 
yet except to Englishmen who visit.


I don't have the names or spelling of the Chinese apples that are grown but 
there are  a lot of Fuji's. I have seen apples from New Zealand and 
Washington (the ubiquitous Red Delicious) in the market places. I have tried 
only a couple of the apples so far for fresh eating. Nothing outstanding. I 
had some Rong Apple Juice in a tetra pak though that was like liquid fresh 
apple. It was really tasty.


After Shanghai, I go to Tianjin and Beijing, then back to Sonoma, CA. for 
more fermenting and selling of cider.


That's all for now.

I have been talking it up with an orchard owner who has his own press, and
I think we will be able to do a club press similar to what the Boston club
does. Though we have shared a few cider's together, he really talks about
apples in a different language than I have learned here on the Cider
Digest. Many Thanks to Dick and Andrew for the education. My question lies
in what apples to use in a custom blend. His short list looks like this,
there are 30 other varieties that are not listed.


Cortland
Fenton Red
Golden Delicious
Idared
Johathan
Lodi
McIntosh
Northern Spy
Ozark Gold
Red Delidious
Rhode Island Greening*
Rome Beauty
Snow*
Stayman Winesap
Steel red
Tolman Sweet*
Wealthy*
Wolf River*


*are antique varities


Thankyou in advance for any suggestions.

Digest readers may like to know that the official UK National
Association of Cidermakers website has just become active at


http://www.cideruk.com/


Worth a look for some nice piccies and current info, and you can
download their Cider 2000 booklet from it.  Very mainstream as you would
expect, and a bit coy about fermentable adjuncts!!
