Thanks, Andrew - will check this out!


Speaking of websites, though - whatever happened to CiderSpace?  It 
disappeared a couple of years ago and I thought it was supposed to be moved 
to a new site.

This is marginally cider-related...but has to do with a (cider) apple tree
and I know some of us here are trying to grow cider apples.


A few weeks ago, I noticed that one of my young trees had been attacked and
lost a bunch of leaves to a pest which, upon examination, I found to be a
tomato hornworm!  I'd never heard of anything like this, but I figured that
maybe it was a desperate critter _vs_ a tree young enough to be abnormally
vulnerable.  I dutifully dispatched the hornworm to an alternate reality.


Since that time, I had noticed that this same little tree had some tips
that looked like springtime new-growth ready to emerge, which sort of made
sense as a recovery from being attacked and losing a lot of foliage.


But yesterday when I was mowing around the trees, I saw a *blossom* on this
tree!  Now, I'm in the northern hemisphere...we are at the end of summer
and around here we're perhaps a few weeks from our first frost.  Is this
tree just temporarily confused, or is there something I should do to it to
help it find its way back to reality-as-we-know-it before winter arrives?
