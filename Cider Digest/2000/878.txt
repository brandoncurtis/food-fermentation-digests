this site  this years inventory of trees for sale by the end of October.

I've been a subscriber to this forum for about a year and have learned
quite a bit.  This will be my third season of cidermaking and I have a
question for the group. This year I'd like to try and replicate a vintage
English cider apple juice blend but I, like most others in the U.S., only
have access to juice from common domestic varieties grown in our local
orchards.  These varieties include Golden & Red Delicious, Fuji, Johnathan,=
 McIntosh, etc.  Has anybody had success approximating vintage English
cider apple taste by adding supplements like tannin powder and malic acid
to domestic apple juice?  If so, may I ask what unit weight per unit
volume of supplement to juice you used (grams/gallon or the like) ? 
Thanks in advance.

Look for R.R.Williams "Cider and Juice Apples: Growing and Producing". I
think you can order this book from The Hereford Cider Museum at Pomona Place
in the UK. I think it may be the most current book available.

Looking through the logs, I find a number of apparent failures in
submissions to the digest...because people have (as far as I can tell, but
I think it's accurate) tried to submit a reply with an inept mailer, ended
up quoting an entire previous issue of the digest, and had it discarded at
this end as bad-mailer barfback.


PLEASE, if you're trying to submit an article, take some care not only to
create a plausible reply, but look it over AFTER you create it to be sure
your mailer hasn't auto-bungled it for you.  If you send a five-line reply
to a hundred-line digest, it WILL be discarded as an error, and it's your
problem.

hard-cider and cheese making at home. sweet and hard cider and cheese
tastings (all free),  and local restaurants will be featuring food based
on apples and cider.  Franklin County is in the northwest corner of
Massachusetts. For more information see ciderday.org
