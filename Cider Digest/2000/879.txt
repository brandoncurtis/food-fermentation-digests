I have planted what I believe will give me a fairly good blend of apples for
my smallish cidery for my locale.  I now have 3 Kingston Black, 1 Elstar, 1
Queen Cox, 1 Karmijn de Sonnaville, 1 Red Gravenstein, 1 mature King, and an
elderly, but still in good production Winter Banana.  I also have a few
pears including a Bennet<Bartlett>, Comice, Buerre Bosc and The last
european pear escapes me at present.  Most are dwarf or semi-dwarf and all
are healthy.  That is the current orchard news.
Ciderwise, I am still scrounging for apples for the next year or so.  I just
ground a few gallons of cider last night and I am going to try keeving for a
french style cider.  The majority of the apples were fairly tannic and
acidic but sweet as well.  No, I did not do any acid tests so I dont know
what those numbers are.  OG was around 57 so it is sweet enough.  I added my
salt and calcium carbonate and it is out in the walk in cooler with nice
cool weather ahead.  I am hopeful.
What does everyone else have going?
Chad

I have only ever bottled cider in plain unthreaded bottles, but I've
accumulated some twist-off bottles that I could put cider in.  Will a
crown-capper used on these form a proper seal?  I tried it and the cap
was superficially water-tight, but I'd like to check that it's good
for long-term storage.


Thanks,

 I am a neophyte cider maker in Ohio. Just moved to the inlaws farm, where 
there is space to plant trees and a few already in the ground. I am looking 
for a good source for a reasonably priced cider press. Any suggestions 
welcome.

Reynold Tomes asked about replicating English cider blends using ordinary 
American apples. I don't know about replicating, but I've had some success 
making cider of that style by adding 1-1 1/2 tsp. powdered wine tannin per 
5gal carboy, as suggested by Paul Correnty in his book The Art of Cider 
Making. (good little book, lots of pointers but ignores the existence of 
cider apples) If you don't use too many Red Delicious you shouldn't need 
extra acid, dessert apples mostly have plenty already.
