Dick, until the web shots get put up, could you do an ASCII diagram to go
along with your write-up? ;-)


Cheers,

    Does anyone out there know where I might purchase a copy of Downing's
"Processed Apple Products, or does anyone have a copy they would be willing
to sell? If so contact me (John Emmett) at jlemmett@earthlink.net.  Thanks
for the help!

As Dick Dunn says in his sig, "simpler is better."  Here's an easy 
recipe I've used several times with good results.  


Get 2 or 3 gallons of unpasteurized cider from your local farmer's 
market.  Put it in a carboy.  Put an airlock on the carboy.  Wait a
month or two until the airlock stops bubbling and the cider has
cleared.  It's not necessary to measure the specific gravity, but if
you do so, it should be around 0.995.  Bottle and cap the cider.  
Wait another 2 months for the cider to age.  Enjoy.

If you have not already done so, get in touch with your local 
homebrewing group, the Oregon Brew Crew, www.oregonbrewcrew.com.  That
is usually where the cidermakers hang out.  They'll be able to point 
you to the best homebrew store in the area.  Some of the members may 
even have extra equipment they will sell.  Also watch your local 
usenet news forsale group.  Used brewing equipment occasionally turns
up on such newsgroups.


Good luck, and let us know how your first batch turns out.

Dick, thanks for the account of a very successful sounding pressing 
operation!  I (and I'm sure many others) would be very interested in 
a more complete description and specifications for Greg and Steve's 
equipment.  I'm especially interested in the grinder design.


Thanks.

In digest #881, I posted, "... I checked the gravity yesterday, it was
.800".  A member of my homebrew club pointed out that I must have been
mistaken.  Sure enough; I should have typed 0.998 .


Anyhow, to follow up on that post, I have since racked the cider off the
primary yeast to a secondary carboy and moved it into the garage where the
temp. has been averaging in the low 40s.  The cider is starting to clear
(very slowly) but I haven't retasted it yet.  I'll probably wait until the
end of the month and repost my findings.


The saga continues...
