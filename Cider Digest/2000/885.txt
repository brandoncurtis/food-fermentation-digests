Lots of postings from brand new cidermakers on the Digest just now. I
think some of the problems people describe are because they're thinking
like brewers!  Cidermaking is much closer to winemaking and that's the
philosophy you need. Slow cool fermentations, no heating of 'must'
(which doesn't need sterilising like wort), etc. Also you have to face
up to the fact that in most ciders (unlike beers) it's very difficult to
retain any residual sugar at the end of fermentation.  I think that's
why some beginning cidermakers become quickly disappointed, especially
when they compare what they've made with the commercial ciders which
are sweetened and then pasteurised to preserve them.


This may sound a trifle arrogant but perhaps they'll find my website of
some use - especially the 'Science of Cidermaking' 6-part series, and in
particular Part 3 which tells how to make straightforward dry cider and
Part 4 which shows how much more difficult it is to make a sweet one!
Also there's a link to an online version of the out of print Ag-Canada
booklet on Juices Wines and Ciders which is good reading for a beginner.
Amongst other things, this shows how to make carbonated sweetened and
pasteurised cider at home, and also gives plans for a home-made mill and
press (another recent Digest topic).  This booklet was re-formatted for
the Web by the Squeeze on Vancouver Island, which is also an apple /
cider site worth looking at in its own right
(http://mars.ark.com/~squeeze/index1.html)


Someone asked about beginner's books recently - in addition to Proulx
and Nichols I can recommend a British book by Michael Pooley and John
Lomax (Real Cidermaking on a Small Scale) and an American one by Ben
Watson (Cider Hard and Sweet).  Both are described on my site and are
easily
obtained from Amazon (which is where I got mine!)

Interesting experiment.  I would, for the sake of experiment, continue to 
wait and see what, if anything, happens to the cider.  My guess is that 
there are not nearly enough wild yeasts floating around in your field to 
generate a spontaneous fermentation.  More likely, the mold spores will 
outnumber the yeasts by a sizable margin, so eventually you will get 
patches of mold on the surface of the cider.  Mold is less temperature 
sensitive than yeast, so at low temps it may get started long before the 
yeast does anyway.  Either that or some bacteria will take over.  If you 
get mold, you can just skim it off and pitch yeast - the yeast ferment will 
eliminate the mold problem.


For comparison, I tried a spontaneous ferment last year with apples from an 
old, neglected orchard.  No fermentation occurred after 16 days, so I 
skimmed off the mold and pitched Montrachet yeast.  Worked fine and the 
cider is very drinkable, if you like a dry champagne.   Further research, 
including discussions on this Digest, leads me to suspect that the yeast 
inoculation for a spontaneous ferment may come more from the grinding and 
pressing equipment than from the apples themselves.


I do not really understand why you would sterilize the fresh must, which 
would be much more likely to have a substantial population of yeast in 
it.  Sure, there will be unwanted bacteria present on the apples too, but 
those will also be floating around in the air - where the yeast might not 
be.  The chances of getting a yeast fermentation, as opposed to a bacterial 
contamination, seem much greater if you do not sterilize.


Have you done this successfully with beer?  I thought this method only 
worked in Belgium, where the native microflora  are suitable.  (And even 
there, the results are not necessarily favorable, if you're not accustomed 
to the sour taste of lambic...)

Lots of people recommend champagne yeast.  It seems to be a very robust 
yeast, it ferments just about anything, and it produces a fairly "clean" 
product; doesn't impart much taste or odor of its own.  It will, however, 
produce a completely dry cider, eating up all of the sugar.  I used it and 
ended up with a cider that is very much like a dry champagne.  The 
drawbacks are that it ferments off nearly all the apple aromas and flavors.


My cider tasted thin and sharp when first bottled, too.  It also had a 
nasty yeasty taste.  After aging and disgorging the yeast, however, it is 
much better.  Your cider will almost undoubtedly improve with age.  I would 
give it 6 months or so.

Subject: Hardy yeast
From: Shroom <shroom@theriver.com>

In my latest purchased batch of (unpasteurized) cider, I kept one gallon
aside for just drinking, placing it in the fridge.  About 3-4 days after
receiving it, I noticed the plastic "milk jug" it was in was bloated,
and the cider starting to sparkle.


It's now been 10 days, the ferment is almost done, and it tastes GREAT.
My question is, if I extract the yeast slurry from the bottom to keep as
a yeast culture for future batches, how do I store it?  Keeping it in
the fridge doesn't seem to stop it fermenting, in fact it seems to
prefer fermenting at 34-35 deg F.  I know that dumping it into a sterile
sugar solution will keep it for a few weeks, but I'm afraid it'll
ferment that too and cause a glass bomb.


Ideas/suggestions please!

Eric, I built myself a powered grinder that works well. The rotor is
stainless, built from a piece of 6 in diameter pipe by 6 in long, on a 3/4
in shaft, with teeth welded on the cylinder. The housing is good quality
3/4 plywood - actually, it is a 20 year old BC fir plywood that I
recuperated, much better quality that what we can buy now. The motor is 1/4
HP - this is a bit weak and should be replaced by a stronger one - 1/2 HP
should be fine with this size of rotor. I have a 8 in pulley on the rotor
and a 2 in on the motor shaft. An automotive V belt works fine for power
transmission. I have put 2 ball bearings with oil seals to prevent the
apple juice to go in the bearings. Takes less than 5 minutes to grind a
bushel. Unfortunately, I don't have a real plan I could pass on to you, but
I hope this will give you ideas.

 I just want to let you know that the great book on ciderapple trees "
Pommiers a cidre" is available for US$ 52, which is a lot less than what
was reported in Cider Digest #844. I bought my copy from Amazon.fr,and
to say that I am impressed with the book is an understatement.342 french
varieties described,most with color pictures and technical data.

We are do a bit of our cider relying on natural yeasts. The objective is to
have a long slow fermentation. The temperature in our facility is between 45
and 50F, which according to the literature is what it should be. It took
nearly a month after pressing before we were able to measure any drop in the
SG. It seems to be perking along just fine now. As for adding commercial
wine yeast it depends, some white wine yeasts work well at 40F, while others
suggest a higher working temperature. In this regard we used a commercial
yeast on some of the cider which seems to be behaving much the same as the
natural yeast. The finish product will be the real test.

Which is best for cider pressing - crushing or grinding?   Exploring 
different designs for preparing the pomace, it seems to me that these are 
the two fundamental methods.  What are the pros and cons of each 
method?  How many ways are there to skin this cat, anyway?


As I remarked previously, I'm having more difficulty coming up with a 
good/cheap/easy/effective design for an apple grinder (or crusher) than for 
a press.   What types of equipment have you used, how well did it work, 
and  what would you recommend?

As far as keeping it simple, I find the wild yeast works well with the
addition of
1 cup of raisins and 4 oz. of honey per 5 gal carboy, air locked of coarse.
It seems
that when your cider was warmed to kill off the bacteria the beneficials
were also
wiped out.  If you want immediate results pitch in some brewers yeast and
soon it will
begin to boil! good luck.

Hi group,
I noticed on the CAMRA website that Westons in Herefordshire took Champion =
Cider of the Year honors in 2000 (and 1999).  I 'd really like to try some =
of their traditional still cider but our local (Kansas City, Missouri =
U.S.A) distributors and retailers don't carry anthing other than Hardcore =
and Woodchuck.  Weston's website indicates that they cannot currently take =
nternational orders.  Does anyone know where I can obtain some Weston's =
cider here in the U.S.?  Thanks in advance.
