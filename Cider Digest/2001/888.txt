I recommend and have purchased blueberries from the following nurseries:


Nourse Farms in MA has best pricing http://www.noursefarms.com/


Miller Nurseries in Canandaigua, NY http://www.millernurseries.com/


St Lawrence Nursery, Potsdam, NY http://www.sln.potsdam.ny.us/


Raintree Nursery in WA state http://www.raintreenursery.com/


I too highly recommend Cummins' Nursery. Jim Cummins developed at the NY
State Ag. Expt. Station a number of new, disease resistant apple rootstocks
that are available for grafting or as young trees:

I have a small orchard and cider mill.I make both sweet and hard cider.I
would rate my cider as quite good .As I do research on cider I read
names like KINGSTON BLACK,FOXWHELP,SWEET COPPIN,GOLDEN RUSSET,ROXBURY
RUSSET....and so on.These sound very interesting and people say these
are the BEST cider apples.I use Macs,jonathon,Spys,Idared ,jonagold and
a few others.Will these old standouts turn my good cider into GREAT
cider?Should I spend the time and money on them.Are they that
outstanding?Does a good cider apple make a good sweet cider apple?I live
in Michigan.                      Thanks

Most people say that pasteurisation before fermentation is not a good
idea.  It tends to 'set' the pectin and make it difficult to clarify and
gives poor sticking fermentations.  Even large companies don't do it
except in unusual circumstances.  Yes fermentation effectively destroys
E. coli.   Hard cider should always be fermented and stored cool but AIR
rather than HEAT is the real enemy of cider in bulk storage.  Think of
cider as a white wine rather than a beer and you'll be on the right
lines!

Regarding the note in CD 882, about Greg/Steven Jordan's apple pressing and
their equipment - I finally remembered to put the snapshots up, in
http://www.talisman.com/cider/pressing.html


These are scanned snapshots so they're rough, but I think they give you
some ideas of the equipment.  Thanks to Greg for taking the pictures and
scanning them.

The archives at www.talisman.com/cider will retain the digests for 2000 as
well as 2001 for a while yet...I didn't want to chop off last year and leave
only a couple digests available in single-digest form.  (I.e., it's not a
bug, it's a feature:-)
