Jay, I bought a Jaffrey press 13 years ago. I guess it is the same model
you write about. Since I live in Canada and there is plenty of maples
around here, I only bought the kit which included all the hardware and the
grinder. I built the wood parts here with the help of a friend carpenter.


I must say I have mixed feelings about it. The grinder was, in my opinion,
quite cheaply made and I had to modify and adjust it before it worked
correctly. I since built a new electric grinder that performs a lot better. 


As of the press itself, there are a few design flaws, in particular the
point of contact of the screw on the piston doesn't hold the pressure - but
this can easily be corrected with a piece of hardened steel. I think it was
overpriced considering the quality and the design. However, I still use the
press - so it's not that bad... Maybe I am too difficult (I am a mechanical
engineer and designer and I don't like to see bad mechanical designs).
Please also note that these flaws might have been corrected since that time.

Thanks for the appreciation, James.
Here in Quebec, the 2000 season didn't let me gather interesting new data
on hardiness. The same varieties that had previously fruited fruited
again... One thing that appear more and more obvious is that Muscadet de
Dieppe and Stoke Red need a lot of time before getting into production - a
bit like Northern Spy.


I hope the varieties you selected go well in Minnesota - Please let us know.

James, No offence, but you make me glad I do not live in Minnesota. But I am
most interested in how your cider cultivars fair. What rootstock did you
use? I am sure that many other who live in the colder zones would be
interested in this and any cultural practices you use.

While I won't argue at all with Dick's comments about it being
unfortunate that in the US unfermented juice is called both apple
cider and apple juice, these words have distinct meanings, at least in
and around the towns west of Boston.  In my town there are at least 5
commercial orchards, and several neighboring towns have a number as
well.


My take on the generally accepted meanings of the words:


apple juice: a product which is almost always filtered, e.g veryfine
in bottles, or whatever in 12-oz frozen concentrate.  Available
year-round.  Kind of industrial, definitely no live yeast and contains
preservatives.


apple cider: The stuff you want to take home and ferment; what you get
from pressing apples and doing very little else.  Available mostly
from September to around Christmas/January, usually in gallon or
half-gallon plastic milk containers (LDPE?), often labelled from the
orchard of origin.  Sometimes pasteurized, sometimes not.  Typically
with potassium sorbate, but occasionally not.

Dear Jay H,


I have owned a Jaffrey cider mill and press 
for several years.  The equipment is very 
sturdy and has performed without any 
problems.  I did make a square wooden 
rack to go under the basket for drainage.


I have gotten better yields since I began 
using a food disposal to grind the apples
finer than my Jaffrey model.  I still use the
Jaffrey press for the pommace pressing.


Good luck,
Bob Capshew
