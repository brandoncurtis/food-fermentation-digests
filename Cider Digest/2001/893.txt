Hello group,
Just for fun I'd like to topwork an old, standard size Red Delicious apple =
tree in our backyard with a few antique and cider varieties such as Golden =
Russett, Roxbury Russet, Kingston Black, Ashmeads Kernel, and Ribston =
Pippin.  Is anybody interested in selling some grafting scionwood for any =
of the above varieties? =20


Reynold Tomes

my email was down so I only saw the few replies after Feb 26th, if you sent 
one early and you have feedback I need to know then please send it to 
drbeer@doctorbeer.com. Thanks for the other feedback I did see. Based on 
this I'm going to go ahead and buy one this summer, but now I think I might 
skip the model with the built in apple grinder and go with the disposal 
solution...


cheers,

Today's edition of the Rochester (NY Democrat & Chronicle had an article
about a local firm that has developed a UV system for killing bacteria
in cider.  The article is weak on technical details, but it might of
interest to members of this list.


The URL (below)  is pretty long, so it may get broken up by your email

I also found an old article on the web site for the New York

Subject: "K" brand commercial cider

A store here in town recently started carrying "K" brand cider, made 
by Matthew Clark Brands, Bristol, UK.  The label claims it is "Hand 
crafted in England with the light and refreshing taste of Somerset 
apples."  I think it tastes pretty good, if a bit on the sweet side.  
It's a good bit sweeter than the draft ciders I had in the UK.  But it
strikes a nice balance between of sweet and tart, at least to me. 
I'm curious what the reputation of this brand is in the UK.  Hope I 
haven't sullied my reputation too much by admitting I like it!


Previous to this, the only commercial ciders we could get here were 
Hornsby's (I protest that this swill is even called cider),
Woodchuck, and Woodpecker.  So it's nice to have another choice.
