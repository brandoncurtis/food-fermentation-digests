Dick,


While I have not personally done business with them, Cummins Nursery in
Geneva, NY, (http://cumminsnursery.com/) has been mentioned several
times here on the Digest.  They will graft trees to your specification
(root stock , etc).  If you are not in a hurry, this sounds like the
perfect solution for folks like you who live in harsh climates.

Dick Dunn asked:


>I'm curious what you'd find for house-brand juice/cider in a Safeway in
>England.


Safeway US and Safeway UK have been quite separate since 1987 with only the
name in common but neither management nor shareholders. I've haven't
checked out the following for sure but they will probably follow the pattern
of the other large UK stores and will probably sell:


1. A house brand fermented cider (possibly more than one, at different
alcohol and sweetness levels).  This will be labelled 'Safeway Cider' in
various styles and made by one of the large UK cider mfgs on contract. Will
be packed in PET or glass.


2. A house brand clear apple juice made from rediluted imported apple
concentrate, UK-contract-packed in a Longlife Tetrapak carton (clear
plastic or glass are rarely used here for juice).  This will call itself
'Safeway Apple Juice'


3. A much pricier house brand of cloudy apple juice, which will be
contract pressed in the UK from UK pressed fruit.  Also packed in a
Longlife Tetrapak carton and labeled 'Safeway English Fresh-Pressed
Apple Juice' or similar.


4. Possibly a juice similar to 3 in the short-life chill section of the
store in a clear plastic bottle (and sold at a higher premium yet).


4. A range of branded ciders and juices at typically higher price than
the 'own label'.


There would of course be no confusion in anybody's mind as to the
disntinction between Cider and Juice - here the two are mutually
exclusive and word Cider is never used to denote 'rough' juice.

Dick, you didn't mention which rootstock you are looking for.


I have gotten cider apple trees from Cummins Nursery 
(http://www.dabney.com/cumminsnursery) on M7 and G30; they have others as 
well,  including a fully dwarf stock.  Jim Cummins is extremely 
knowledgeable and can help you evaluate varieties and rootstocks.  The 
trees I received were not as well-developed as the ones I get from Sonoma, 
but the price reflected that so I was happy with the value.


I have also ordered some trees from Lee Elliott at Cider Hill Nursery, but 
have not yet received them so cannot comment.  He is a fairly small 
operation and you need to get your order in early as he sells out 
quickly.  (217) 882-2047


I just received trees from Miller Nursery (1-800-836-9630), who have some 
of the older varieties including some reputed to be good for cider.  They 
have them on standard or "semi-dwarf," which in their case appears to be M7.


There is an apple nursery near me, Garcia River Nursery, who does some 
cider varieties - Kingston Black, Foxwhelp, Rhode Island Greening come to 
mind.  I don't know if he ships or not.  He mostly grafts onto M111, 
though, like the Sonoma folks.  (707) 882-2523


Hope that helps!

Russets planted two years ago are just beginning to bloom!

Dick, the following seems like an advertisement, and perhaps it is, but
there does seem to be some difficulty in locating cider varieties.  If
you judge inappropriate, of course we couldn't take offense at the
information not being put out.  It might be that simply noting our
website and that we do make a number of cider varieties would be
sufficient.  Any how:


We usually put our cider varieties on either Malling 7 or Geneva 30, but
occasionally have some  on Geneva 16 or M.26, surplus from custom
orders.


For spring 2001, we still have several traditional cider varieties
available, usually in 1/2" or 3/8" calipers, usually just a handful of
trees.


Bedan on M.26 and M.7
Brown's Apple on M.7
Bulmer's Norman on M.7 + some 5/16" grafts on G.30
Court Royal on G.16
Domaines on G.16 and M.7
Ellis Bitter on G.30 and M.7
Frequin Rouge on G.16
Kingston Black on M.26
Major on G.30 and M.7
Margil on M.7
Medaille d'Or on G.16
Pitmaston Pineapple on G.16 (5/16 whips only)
Stembridge Cluster on M.7
Stoke Red on M.7 and G.30
Sweet Coppin on M.7
"Tremlett's Bitter" (not correct ID) on M.7.


Most of the varieties above will be back next year, mostly on M.7 and
G.30.  Following are additional for 2002:


Binet Rouge
Brown Snout
Brown Thorn
Chisel Jersey
Claygate Pearmain
Coat Jersey
Crimson King
Dabinette
Dufflin
Grenadier
Harry Masters Jersey
Marin Oufroy
Mettais
Michelin
Muscadet de Dieppe
Nehou
Noel des Champs
Porter's Perfection
Reine des Pommes

Interesting that this came up just now. As I was trying to find info on
disease resistance I contacted John Ross and part of his response to me
included this list:


Sonoma Antique Apple Nursery
4395 Westside Road
Healdsburg, California 95448

Washington State University used to have a program that offered certified
virus-free scionwood for a huge list of apple varieties, including half a
dozen cider types. Of course, "virus-free" is not the same as disease
resistant, but it's a start. Their Web site seems to be offline, but you
might want to try this in a week or two:
http://www.nrsp5.wsu.edu/nrspcp02.html or write to:

Washington State University - IAREC

I would also add the following sources I have run across:


Inner Coast Nursery
Bill and Elena Wheeler
Box 115, Mansons Landing, B.C., V0P 1K0
(250) 935-6384
http://oberon.ark.com/~innersea/


Big Horse Creek Farm
P.O. Box 70
Lansing, NC 28643
http://www.bighorsecreekfarm.com/


NORTHWOODS NURSERY.
(I haven't gotten their catalog for awhile, but they used to have some cider
varieties)
28696 S. Cramer Road
Molalla, OR 97038
(503)651-3737


The only people on this list I have personally done business with are Cider
Hill and Northwoods. I have done business with Bear Creek and am truly
disappointed to find they are out of business. They were a class operation
and a pleasure with which to do business. Are you sure Dick?


Others may be able to add some comments here.

In regard to Dick Dunn's comments on the scarcity of retail suppliers of
variety/rootstock combinatios:
 I would,myself, be willing to "help out" fellow amateur orchardists
with scions of varieties and rootstocks that I have. I know that there
are other people who would do the same.
 Now all we need is a person willing to collect the names of these
people, the varieties they have and post an inventory list.
 As for grafting a scion to a rootstock, it is so simple that anybody
with an interest in this hobby should definetely learn to do it.

From: peter g <peter.g@telus.net>

Folks,
    so tickled was i , with Pat Maloney's last post , that a decision was
made to consult my 1886 copy of Noah Webster's Unabridged
Dictionary to see how the word was in use 115 years ago in the USA.
the 5" thick, leather bound tome returned the following:


Chuff, n. a coarse, heavy, dull, or surly fellow; a clown --- Shak.
Chuff, a. surly; ill-tempered; irascible.
Chuffily, adv. In a rough, surly manner ; clownishly
Chuffy, a. Fat or swelled out, especially in the cheeks.


    interesting how the usage has evolved , but ...
lo, and behold ... on the very next page ...


Cider, n. a drink made from the juice of apples.
    (notation) The word was formerly used to signify the juice of other
fruits, and other kinds of strong liquor, except wine ;  but it is now
appropriated to the juice of apples, before and after fermentation.


so the word "cider" was used ( in the US anyway) to describe both
fresh & "modified" apple juice, according to Webster, way back then.


there's probably a stellar etymology & date chart for both words
at  www.OED.com ; anyone have a subscription ?


regards
peter g

Last fall I gave a go at my first cyser.  Its been in the carboy for 6
months now, racked once and it has cleared up beautifully.  My question is,
how long should a cyser stay in the carboy before bottling?  I've read that
because the honey is a more complex sugar that it takes longer for the taste
to mellow before bottling.  I've tasted it the other day and it definitely
still needs more time.  So how long should it age in the carboy?  And once
bottled, how long should I leave a cyser before serving?  Thanks,
 
John Conwell
