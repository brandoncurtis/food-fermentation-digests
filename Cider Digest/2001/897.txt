I'd second Preben's comments about doing your own grafting.
As total beginners, with encouragement and supply of budwood
from friends, we planted out 140 M111 rootstock winter 1999,
grafted in early spring and had wonderful success - 5 failed
grafts (all regrafted/budded successfully).  It was very easy
and rewarding and the trees are up to about 1.5-2 m now (we're
growing them as standards).  


The best advice we got: use a very sharp knife, and keep 
everything clean. We wipe down with methylated spirits between
trees to stop any virus transmission (although we don't
believe any is present in the materials we have).


The main variety is Kingston Black but we've put in some of 
every cider variety we can find, plus some eating/culinary 
varieties.  We're still adding varieties as we get them.  
Cockatoos permitting, we hope for a small crop next season.
