Just found a cider brand called "K" from Bristol in a local (Laansing, MI)
store.


Claims to be "The Ultimate in Quality" and is "handcrafted in England with
the light and refreshing taste of Sommerset apples".


How does it rank among the knowledgeable, as I've not tasted many ciders in
England?


cheers, jbooth

All of our local garden centers have stopped carrying
Imidan which I have found to be very effective for controlling
plum curculio on apples, pears and other fruit trees.  Does
anyone know of a U.S. mail order source for the home
orchardist?

I had read here and heard from another subscriber that Bear Creek Nursery
had gone under, and outside evidence supported that (phone disconnected, web
site down). Earlier in the year, I place an order for 10 rootstocks on which
to graft Chisel Jersey and Yarlington Mill obtained from Washington State
University. I did not get a confirmation of my order from them, so had
written off the money, and scrambled to find another source.


Having seen Cummins Nursery's website, I ordered Budavosky-9 rootstocks
from. Cummins was very prompt, I think I had my order within a week of
placing the order. Good quality, and consistent stem size, which makes the
grafting easier. I grafted that weekend, and heeled in the benchgrafts until
last week, when the soil dried out enough to permit planting in my nursery
bed.


This past Saturday, lo and behold, my order from Bear Creek appeared on my
doorstep! There was no explanation for the delay, nor any information about
the nursery's status, just a packing slip. I hope they continue the
business. Anyway, they upgraded my rootstocks from P-22 to P-22 as an
interstem on Antnovka (sp?), so I'm excited to try them out next year. 


However, I now have 20 more rootstocks than originally planned (I had to
order 20 from Cummins to meet the minimum). I may be looking to get rid of a
few of them over the next year, so stay tuned.


On a cider-tasting note, I purchased a six-pack of a cider new to my eyes.
The brand is 'K', it markets itself as a draft cider. Made in the U.K. from
hard cider and Somerset apples - the usual adjuncts (malic acid, water, etc)
apply. Although it's too sweet, there is a definite tannic note to this
brand - I think it's a good alternative to Woodpecker.

Well, "K" finally made it out this far (not to Hygiene, which doesn't have a
liquor store, but to nearby Longmont).  See Andrew Lea's comments in CD 894
on the pedigree.


Having tasted various UK major-brand commercial ciders, as well as some good
English real ciders, I'd have to say that K is at least as good as many of
the major commercials, perhaps better than most.  It is too sweet, but not
horribly so, and although it's fizzy, it's not grossly overcarbonated...one
could drink it in polite company without fear of startling one's companions
with a huge eruction.


I guess I'd say "less bad than most".


There's a minor annoyance that the designer image of the bottle is created
by a substantial plastic wrapper (covering the entire clear twist-off bottle).
Not nice for recycling, although you can pop the wrapper off the glass easily
enough.


It's also a bit stronger than you might like for quaffing...for example, it
is 50% stronger than "Strongbow" (one of the few other English imports we
get here, and I say that with apology to our English readers).  I feel that
cider is better off around 5% (alc v/v) than around 7%, especially for
commercial ciders which are boosted in strength by artifice of manufacture
rather than from naturally high-gravity juice.  I like to think of cider as
a beverage which happens to have mild intoxicating properties rather than
as an intoxicant which happens to taste good.
