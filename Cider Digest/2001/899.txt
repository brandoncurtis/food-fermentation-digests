Bob,


Try these guys:  GardensAlive! (812)537-8650.


I remember seeing that  they sold Imidan for integrated pest managment
in the past.


All the stuff I have tried for bug control and plant fertilizers are
great.


Good luck,

(Sorry to bother the general populace with this)


There have been occasional failures in delivering to hotmail.com.  When they
happen, they are total (can't deliver to anybody at hotmail.com) and there
is no apparent reason, nothing related to general network problems or fail-
ures elsewhere.


SO...if you're receiving the Cider Digest via hotmail, beware that you may
fail to receive digests now and then, and there's nothing I can do about it.

Our janitor writes:


<< it's not grossly overcarbonated...one  could drink it in polite company 
without fear of startling one's companions  with a huge eruction. >>


Mr. Dunn may wish to clarify that noun at the end of the sentence.  Although 
I believe I understand what was meant before the typo struck, there is 
another possibility -- one that provides both an excellent visual and 
additional hope for Bob Dole. . .

This year was my first attempt at making cider.  I couldn't get my hands on
any fresh pressed juice, so I had to settle for a decent blend of
pasteurized juice from a local health food store.  I made a plain cider, a
New England cider and a cyser, 5 gallons each.  I was really worried about
the New England and the cyser because when I racked them off their lees the
mouthful I got starting the siphon made me gag.  It was horrid, but I
figured I'd give them a shot anyway.  


After bottling I had a half a bottle of each left over so I decided to give
them a shot.  To my surprise, they were both drink worthy right then, both a
very fine still cider.  I had been told be several people that since I was
using pasteurized juice that they wouldn't clear very well and the taste
would be off, but they couldn't have been more wrong.  Both are beautifully
clear and wonderful to the palate.  I just wanted to share and say thanks to
all those here who gave me advice over the past 6 months.  


Salute!
John
