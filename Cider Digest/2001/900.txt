Pardon the ersatz erudition in substituting the arcane "eruction" for the
more traditional (but less compact) "eructation"...
although you must admit that even a slight and occasional misinterpretation
could give quite a boost to cider's reputation!

No typo at all...just word-games.  Ask the OED.

check with your local FS, (farm service) or as your local commercial
orchardist where he gets his chemicals. usually you get much better
prices and a full line of chemicals.  I pay about $9 a lb for Imadan 50
wp. and its delivered free, however my FS man wont mail because of DOT
regulations.

Dear fellow ciderists,


What filthy minds some of you have!  "Eruction" is a perfectly good and
precisely appropriate word -- look it up in your Funk and Wagnalls.

I'm a new subscriber, just moved to Western NY about 2 years ago and have
recently planted a cider orchard.   By the end of next week it is expected
to grow a bit more to about 90 varieties of apple, with emphasis on cider
and antiques (Jim Cummins assembled the lion's share of the varieties, with
most of the rest coming from Sonoma Antique Apple Nursery and Southmeadow
Fruit Gardens).  Now I'd like to find out what cidermakers (amateur or
professional)live within a short drive of the Buffalo, NY area.  It also got
me to wondering if anyone has ever undertaken to compile a geographical
directory of subscribers.  If not (and, if others don't find it to be too
intrusive) perhaps others might find that to be of some interest.  Any
thoughts?

I'm revisiting this "K" cider discussed in recent digests.


The background is that we'd had a bottle of a Tremlett's Bitter (the blend
also contains russets), from West County, with dinner...and that was
excellent.  It's the sort of cider that makes you feel glad, and a little
bit special, to know about real cider.  Ever look at your empty glass and
tip it way up to see if you can get one more drop?  That kind of cider.


But later that evening I found myself not surprisingly wanting a bit more
cider.  So I opened a bottle of K.  Alas, after that I still found myself
wanting a bit of cider!  With the memory of that good West County cider
clear in my mind, I'd take a sip of the K and wait for the real cider
taste...and nothing happened so I'd take another sip...I think K is a sort
of shadow of what a cider might be like.  If you've not had a real cider,
or not had one recently, you can taste K and your imagination will try to
fill in what's missing.  If you've had a good cider recently, K just
barely reminds you of what it's missing.


<Sigh>...I don't want K...or Strongbow or Woodpecker or Woodchuck or
Hardcore or Cider Jack.  (And Hornsby's is really beneath rejection.)  I
want a real cider.  I want to be able to buy locally something like West
County, or Burrow Hill, or Hecks, or Dunkerton, or...


I think it's useful for US readers of this digest to look around in liquor
stores and think of analogies among cider, beer, and wine.  The ciders in
stores today are analogous to American lagers...a few undistinguished,
over-processed, thin, fizzy products.  There's no equivalent of the micro-
brewery for cider, except in a few very tiny markets...and there's
certainly no Anchor or Sierra Nevada of cider, nothing approaching a brand
with high standards and national distribution.  Wine similarly has its
giants but also its "boutique" (hate that word) wineries.  The US wine
scene has room for Gallo but also a lot of serious independents like Ridge,
and even some, er, "idiosyncratic" winemakers like David Bruce can get wide
distribution.  But cider sits in an odd corner, next to bad company like
Hooch and Purple Passion and the wine coolers and other get-drunk-quick
concoctions.


We've got a long way to go.  Yes, we can make our own cider, but that's
only part of what it takes.
