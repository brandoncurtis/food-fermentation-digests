Subject: thoughts on K
From: "David Johnson" <dmjalj@ckhnet.com>
Date: Sun, 20 May 2001 12:24:46 -0500


I guess I missed some of the recent comments about K. My 2 cents 
on the subject would include the comment that, although I only had 
one bottle, it was much less carbonated than the majority of 
ciders Dick mentioned. Possibly it was just the single bottle that 
I happened to get. It seemed to show how much the Woodchuck, 
Strongbow, ... could be improved just by decreasing the 
carbonation. 


It makes me think about what is the purpose of carbonation in my 
cider. There is a certain visual appeal to a sparkling beverage, 
but this is probably less important in cider than beer.  It also 
serves to tickle the palate and lift the scent of the cider. Since 
so much of what we taste is really smell, this is quite important.


Further, since temperature affects the level of carbonation, 
serving temperature cannot be seperated from the discussion. I 
think that ciders are often served too cold. At colder 
temperatures, the perception of sweetness is decreased. It seems 
that serving a cider less cold would enhance the perception of any 
residual sweetness. Yet if we served many of the commercial ciders 
at a warmer temperature, the level of carbonation would be even 
more distracting.


I think the concepts of serving temp and carbonation have been 
discussed here before, but I guess this experience helped me 
realize that overcarbonation in cider really is a flaw (IMO) and 
that I should think about serving cider at warmer temperatures. 


I have a couple of batches of last season's cider to bottle (my 
bottling has been delayed by a building project that has delivered 
a lot of dust to my work area). Perhaps I will bottle it with 2 
different levels of carbonation.


Has anybody really tried this?


Other comments?

Subject: Australian Lady Williams Apple

G'day,


This is probably a Aussie related query I guess. Has anyone used Lady
Williams juice for cider. It is quite a sharp apple and I am curious. Any
Ideas??


Thanks

A while ago someone asked what the full Oxford English Dictionary (OED)
definition of 'cider' was.  I've set it down below. It looks better in
HTML which you'll find in a blind link at 
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/oedcider.html   I
was surprised it does not include current US alternate usage to mean an
(?unfiltered) unfermented apple juice.


Also, since people have been so uncharitable as to question Dick's use
of the word 'eruction' recently, I've added that too.  It follows the
cider....naturally!

CIDER


ME. sidre, sier, etc., a. OF. sidre (now cidre), corresp. to It. sidro,
cidro; Sp. sidra fem., OSp. sizra.
Although the phonetic history of the word in Romanic presents
difficulties, there can be no doubt that it
represents late L. sicera (med.L. cisara, cisera), Gr. , a word used by
the LXX, the Vulgate, and
Christian writers to translate Heb. shkr intoxicating liquor, `strong
drink', of the O.T., f. shkar to drink
deeply or to intoxication. It is not clear where or how the phonetic
change from sicera to sidra took place;
but perh. the intermediate link was sizra (sitsra, sidzra): cf. F. ladre
from Lazarus. In common use cidre
had already acquired the sense of `fermented drink made from apples'
before it was taken into English.
But the earlier sense of `strong drink' generally was retained in
translation of, and allusions to, the
Vulgate; and in this sense the word had often forms much nearer to the
Latin, as ciser, cisar, cyser, seser:
these forms are not used in the sense `cider': see SICER.] 


  1. a. A beverage made from the juice of apples expressed and
fermented. Formerly including fermented

Subject: Hawkins Amber Cider
From: peter g <peter.g@telus.net>
Date: Sat, 26 May 2001 19:49:54 -0700


hi folks,
    at the Liquor Store, here in Vancouver, today i encountered a new
product offering : "Hawkins, Premium Crafted, Amber Cider" .
6 x 341ml, twist-top clear bottles, 5.5% alc/vol, CA$9.95 plus litter.
made by Hawkins Cider Company , in Oliver, BC (Okanagan region?).
attractively packaged (boxed six-pack) offers "This traditional amber
cider is crafted using only the finest ingredients. The result is an
exceptionally smooth drinking, full flavoured cider with a fresh clean
finish. Enjoy responsibly!"
i was actually pretty excited to find another choice here in BC for
apple ciders.  then i read the ingredients list .
"ingredients : cider, fructose syrup and/or invert sugar, apple
concentrate, carbon dioxide, natural and artificial flavours, potassium
sorbate, ascorbic acid, sulfites."
    i decided to buy a box anyway ( ya hafta try it huh?!), and then set
to work  inquiring about the company. turns out that Hawkins is
actually a subsidiary of Vincor ( Vincor makes "Growers" ciders ) and
the product is marketed by Atlas Wines. i wondered if they had plans
to add any other ciders (maybe a 7% version), or packaging in 1 or 2
litre PETs, but mostly i was curious about the first ingredient ... does
"cider" mean "apple cider"? or are there other fruits involved?
(other than in conjunction with the word "concentrate" in the
microscopically small-print ingredients list, the word "apple" only
appears ONCE on the packaging, crammed into the bottom left hand
corner of the main facing ... almost an afterthought. so i was curious.
    anyway, i did contact the company (Vincor), where they assured
me that Hawkins is all apple cider. no other fruits involved , but the
drink does contain honey, and caramel colouring. just why these two
additions don't appear on the ingredients list is unknown, but i had
them double check ... they're both in the product.
for those who may have other questions , there's info at ...
1-800-665-2667 or 250-498-4981
    so there it is ... taste ? sort of a lightly carbed, sweetish apple
juice with a splash of vodka, flavour. an apple flavoured drink that
includes alcohol. 
not exactly what i had in mind, or what the label implies.
    i prolly won't go out of my way to buy another box.
[fwiw]
regards
peter g
