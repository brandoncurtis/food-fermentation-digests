Could you use the Champagne method to remove the lees?  If the cider is 
cooled to the proper temperature (4 centigrade, I think), and the removal 
is done carefully, you can control the amount of carbonation that is 
lost.  What kind of bottles are you using?

A while back someone asked about sources of trees for cider apples.  In 
addition to the sources I mentioned previously (Sonoma Antique Apple 
Nursery, Cummins Nursery, Miller Nursery), I can now recommend Cider Hill 
Nursery.  The trees I received were *huge,* with very sturdy trunks and 
well-developed roots; some already have the basic branch structure 
developed.   They have leafed out and appear to be growing nicely.   If 
they adapt to my climate, I could get production in a couple of years!
