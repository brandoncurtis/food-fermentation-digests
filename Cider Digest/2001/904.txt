A borrowed heading, but all in a good cause.
My latest incarnation of cider press - Mark V if I remember correctly -
has now acheived some sort of fame on the net.
Visit the website www.supplierpipeline.com and click on the rosy red
apple at top left!
Powered by (muscle and) two 4WD jacks it gives a pressure of 7 tonnes
and a good aerobic workout at the same time. Pressing plates are 500 *
500 mm.

Subject: SO2 and low temperature tactics
From: David Pickering <davidp@netwit.net.au>

In searching for techniques to bring an early stop to my cider
fermentation (see Cider Digest 902 - any words of advice anybody?) I
came across a publication "The Principles and Practice of Cider-Making"
by VLS Charley from 1949, which is a translation of "La Ciderie" by Prof
G Warcollier (1928).
He quotes a "normal" dose of sulphur dioxide as 1.5oz of K.M.S. per 100
gallons. I guess KMS is potassium metabisulphite but that is a guess,
and I suppose a French gallon is the same as an English one ie bigger
than a US gallon. How does one get rid of the SO2 odour from the cider?


The book has lots of interesting info on the state of the cider-maker's
art circa 1928-1949. Lots of encouraging things then a full chapter on
"Disorders of Cider". I think I'll read that properly when and if I have
problems with ropiness or green cider.


There were also some hints that low temperatures of around +1 to -1C
(ummm... 34 to 30F ?) may be a means of halting fermentation and
preventing spoilage in the incompletely fermented product I am trying to
produce - dare I say a Scrumpy style with lots of fruit. Has anybody
gone down this road?
Lower temperatures than these, eg down to -4C, can apparently be used to
concentrate the cider by removal of ice that separates out. The book
quotes French work with a start point of sg 1.010 and 3.75% alcohol and
the strongest of the fractions produced as 1.016 and 5.95.
The book later quotes work from Long Ashton using a single freezing to
- -12C that gave increases of:
                            sg          acid        tannin   alc%       
sg         acid        tannin   alc%
Knotted Kernel    1.008   0.37     0.23      5.25         1.016  0.61   
  0.40      8.55
Sweet Clusters    1.018   0.26     0.18      3.02         1.039  0.54   
  0.34      6.02
Woodbine             1.010   0.39     0.14      4.32         1.019  0.65
     0.27      8.15


Not a bad concentrating job - hope the table is still readable after
going through all the email systems.

I will be arriving in Bath area July 13 with my wife and granddaughter (14 yrs)
and traveling north by car to Blackpool, York and then to fly out of Glasgow
July 27.  I love cider and cider making but will have very limited attention of
my traveling companions to indulge myself attending to the craft.


Recommendations of events and places to visit would be appreciated, and also Bed
and Breakfasts.  Both those cider related and memorable for a 14 year old girl. 


wassail and TIA, jim booth

Subject: watering trees?
From: rcd@talisman.com (Dick Dunn)

I've got a few dozen trees of various cider-apple varieties, all still young.
I'm thinking about how to irrigate them over the long term.  (Hoses or
buckets, as I've used so far, are _not_ a long-term solution!)


Cutting furrows for a row-type flood irrigation just isn't an option.  I've
been thinking that some sort of drip arrangement ought to work, but I can't
get a good handle on what sort of drippers, and how many per tree, I should
use.  Anyone with advice or experience, especially for dry climate?


(This is on the fringe of standard Cider Digest topics.  I think most
replies should go via email unless they are of unusually general interest.)
