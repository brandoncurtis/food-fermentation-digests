One good site to check for information on agricultural chemicals like
Roundup is:    http://ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet/. I think you will find
that it is a fairly safe product to work with since it binds tightly with
the soil and has a fairly short half life. However if you can use
alternatives like mulching so much the better.

The reason for that is that by French food law, ciders described as
'Brut' can (and often do) contain up to 28 g/l sugar.  They are 'brut'
in the context of French traditional (i.e. part-fermented) cidermaking,
but not 'brut' in any absolute sense!

 My recollection is that in Normandy and Brittany they are often
drunk with pancakes (crepes, galettes) which have a sweetish dough even
when they contain savoury fillings - so the cider doesn't overwhelm the
food.  But mostly I think French traditional cider is drunk on its own.

Yes, there IS an official AICV Cider Flavour Wheel which is a part of
the AICV Analytical Methods Manual.  Whether or not they would let
anyone outside of the AICV have a copy is another question!


Go to


http://www.aicv.org/overview/html/frame2.htm 


and then check 'publications' on the sidebar.  That gives you a form
where you can make a request.


Good Luck!

Concert tour puts edge on alcoholic cider
marketing


By Mary Chao
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle 


(Friday, July 6, 2001) -- Canandaigua Wine
Co. is trying to boost its K alcoholic cider
among urban minorities by linking the brand
to rhythm-and-blues artist R. Kelly. 


The K cider business is the exclusive
sponsor of Kelly's 34-concert tour that will
stop in 29 cities including Detroit, Miami,
Los Angeles, Boston and New York. 


Test-market results showed K cider was
well received by minorities between the
ages of 21 to 30 in urban areas, said K
brand manager Jon Guggino. 


"We wanted to associate the brand with an established urban artist,"
Guggino said. "We want to make his fans fans of K cider." 


K is a hard alcoholic cider made with apples from the English
countryside. It was launched in the United States in March. 


Sales of K have exceeded the company's expectations, Guggino said,
selling 180,000 cases since its U.S. launch. 


Alternative alcoholic beverages such as hard lemonades and
fruit-flavored
wines are currently very popular with young people, said Tom Pirko,
consultant at Bevmark LLP in Santa Barbara, Calif. 


Pirko also said promoting beverages through music venues is a good
way to get the message out. 


"You have this cry out there saying, 'Give me something different,' " he
said. "Minorities want to maintain their own identity -- they're looking
for something new."

Subject: Grolsch bottles

I use Grolsch bottles exclusively for beer, but find that 16 ounces is
often too much cider to drink at one time, so I use 12-ounce beer
bottles for my cider.  Bottles from store-bought beer are made of
very thin glass; I do not recommend them for anything that is going to
carbonate in the bottle.  Use returnable bottles, the glass is much
thicker.  Your local beer distributor might sell you some returnables
for a few dollars per case.  If not, you'll have to get them from a
homebrew shop.  Homebrew shops also sell Grolsch-style bottles, but
usually they are pretty pricey.  Here in the USA, the Applebee's
restaurant chain carries Grolsch and will let you take the empty
bottles home.  Or just make it a habit to pick up a 4-pack of Grolsch 
at the grocery store each week and pretty soon you'll have all the 
bottles you need.


I have found one of the best sources of Grolsch bottles to be former 
homebrewers who want to clean out their garage!  Another good source 
is a homebrewer who is now kegging rather than bottling.


Grolsch bottles won't easily fit into the average cardboard 6-pack 
carrier, but they do fit perfectly into the Negra Modelo carriers.


As for cleaning, I find that the automatic dishwasher does a great job
of cleaning and disinfecting.  I fill the soap dispenser with liquid
bleach, set the controls on the hottest water setting, power scrub,
heated drying cycle, and an hour later the bottles are ready.  Too bad
the bottles I use for winemaking won't fit into the dishwasher, but
they are too tall and must be sanitized by hand, what a pain.

Cider Colleagues --


OK, while we're waiting for this year's apples, I have a question:  in your
opinion(s), what's the best drinking glass for cider?  Neither my favorite
beer nor wine glass quite does justice to this beverage that is oblique to
both.  Thoughts?
