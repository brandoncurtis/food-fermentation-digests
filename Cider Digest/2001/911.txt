Stephen Butts asked (Digest 910): what's the best drinking glass for cider?


My personal preference for sparkling cider is a champagne flute, or a type of
glass called (in Australia) a 'lady's waist' which is slender, tapered and has a
heavy glass bottom. This type comes in a number of sizes (5, 7 and 10 oz, as
well as small ones for spirits), and I prefer the 7 oz. You occasionally come
across some nice ones in antique shops, but they are still available here new.
They are well balanced. For still cider I prefer a wider larger wine glass (the
type you normally use for a fuller-bodied red).


Of course, when I was younger and more foolish I wouldn't have gone near a glass
as small as a 7, but those were the days before the www when I thought Strongbow
was a good cider!

The Normans typically drink cider from bowl-shaped ceramic vessels (wider 
in the middle than at the base or rim).  Kind of like a small soup 
bowl.  From memory I would guess the typical size would hold at least a 
pint if filled to the brim, but usually they are filled about half to 2/3 
full.  The size is such that you get a nose-full of aroma as you 
drink.  I'm pretty sure this is the ideal vessel for cider - Normans have 
this stuff pretty well figured out!   (Although I am interested in what the 
Asturians use.)


Out here in California, I use a short wide glass (It's actually a 49ers 
glass) that holds about 12 ounces.  It's about 3 inches wide and 3-1/2 
inches tall, and it swells in the middle.  It would be better if it were 
wider, and perhaps not as tall.  But it serves the purpose better, IMO, 
than any wine or beer glass.


Cheers,
Tim Bray

My own preference, especially for tastings, where several kinds of cider are
being served to many people, are the small, 6-ounce, straight-sided wine
glasses. As with straight-sided champagne flutes, this shape prevents the
rapid loss of effervescence -- though naturally carbonated cider in my
experience does not lose its sparkle as quickly as force-carbonated cider.

OK, while we're waiting for this year's apples, I have a question:  in your
opinion(s), what's the best drinking glass for cider?  Neither my favorite
beer nor wine glass quite does justice to this beverage that is oblique to
both.  Thoughts?

For the best glass, my vote is for a 12 oz. footed beer glass or ale glass.
Medium height of 6 1/2 to 7 inches, a solid base with heft to match a good
cider. Wine glasses are ok but are bit wimpy. For a point of reference look
at the Libbey catalog http://www.libbey.com  for Specialty Footed Beer
glasses.

An amazing new percussion duo, Ugarte Anaiak, made its debut at the
Vancouver Folk Music Festival july 13-15. They are reviving a forgotten
Basque instrument.
What has this to do with cider? To quote the program notes: " The
txalaparta is a traditional percussion instrument." "The instrument is
derived from the apple cider production process. The workers would stand
inside large wooden vats of apples using poles to crush the fruit, which
caused hollow tapping sounds on the floor of the vat. To relieve
boredom, they made it into a fun activity by echoing each other's
increasingly complex rhythms.  Need we say that this was also a
traditional time of celebration?"
These guys are anything but boring. The instrument consists of three saw
horses with slabs of lumber, marble and steel, resting on foam strips.
It is struck with wood rods similar to a pestle. Unfortunately their CD
is not out yet.
