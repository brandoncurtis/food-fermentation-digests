Thank-you for the replies, both on and off-list.  A couple of the
off-list replies said that sorbate inhibited bud formation on the
yeast.  That is, it did not euthanize them, it just provided birth
control.  


I firmly believe that all progress is due to people who refuse to be
reasonable.  So I made a 100% malt starter wort and left my yeast on it
for twenty four hours.  Then dumped to cider.  The cider started
bubbling.  Yeah!!!  Three days later the soluble solids have dropped by
a whopping 1.5%  Cider is picking up a snotty mouth feel
(polysaccharides?) and a strange mid-tongue taste.  I will let it run
for another week, in the name of science, and then probably end up
dumping it.

Of course Dick is absolutely right.  The acids in true grape verjus
would be tartaric and malic (generally more malic than tartaric if the
grape is really sour), and the acid in true apple verjus would be mostly
malic.  Those 'fixed acids' have a very different taste to the
'volatile' acid (acetic) of vinegar, and anyone who had experience of
both the true verjus and the fermented-vinegar verjus would easily be
able to distinguish them.  Also, those fixed acids would stay around
during cooking and would not be lost.  But in vinegars (certainly in
most cider vinegars I've ever analysed), the fixed acids have been
mostly metabolised away and surprisingly only acetic is left.  The
practical consequence of which is that when you cook with vinegar, most
of the acid is lost if you heat for any length of time in an open pot.
