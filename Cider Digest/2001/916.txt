In July, my wife, 14 yr old granddaughter and I traveled to Normandy FR and
England and I attempted to indulge my self of cider within the limits of my
companions needs.


In Normandy we were visiting locals and enjoyed a Channel side meal of cider and
mussels.  They happily ordered a pitcher to share with me, and this is notable
in that it is unusual I can get others to forgoe the white wines and join
me in cider.  The locals initiated the order.


In Bath England the liquor store had an impressive array of cider choices but
distressing familiar brands.  I selected the most expensive 2L bottle (it was
an unfamiliar brand of Bulmers I believe at 7% but was bland}.


We headed north to Hereford arriving late Sunday evening and checked into a 
pub/B&B for a delightful local cider brand (fruity, crisp and clean, supper 
and a 3rd story walk-up bedroom without screens. All was delightful except 
for a few moths that found our lighted open windows and greatly distressed 
the 14 yr old. I swiped my Bulmers clear glass serving glass as a souvenir 
(but left a super generous tip to the owner/waitress to cover it).  


Monday we headed for the Bulmers Cider Museum, got on a narrow road and lost a
side view mirror glass from our rent=a=car.  Stopped and knocked on the door 
besides the parked car, paid the occupant 20L for his mirror and on leaving 
noticed all the broken glass was mine as his mirror glass had long been gone.


Found the museum and enjoyed seeing the old apple mills, presses, vats, casks 
and bottling lines plus marketing items as labels, bottles, posters, etc.  They 
distill apple brandy there so we watched the still perk (a real thrill for the 
wife and grand-daughter) and headed to the gift shop and ampily rewarded them
for being open.  


Bought a 5x7 picture of a horse drawn apple mill for 50 cents or so and came
home and spent $60 framing it.  I'm saving the apple brandy and the
brandy/cider liquor blend for our next tasting group.


We headed out toward Birmingham with Dave Matthew's CAMRA cider guide in hand
to try to find a local producer listed but failed.  Kept on toward Birmingham
and the Cadbury chocolate factory (wife pay back time) and saw 
a roadside sign selling cider and wheeled over.  A tasting proved it was quite
rough stuff, really funky but I bot 2L anyway.  I think it was for cheap drunks.
However, blended 50/50 with the bland commercial stuff from Bath, it improved
both IMHO and took me through the next several days. 


So, we headed for Ironbridge George and north Wales and the Lake country.  
cheers,  jim booth
