Regarding fermentation prior to pressing, I've done this with fruit wines just
in a bucket covered but not necessarily air-locked (layer of CO2 protecting
against oxidation/infection etc.) Would that be the method you would use for the
ground but un-pressed apples? What about for larger presses which grind straight
onto the cheese building frame (which is how our local organic orchard presses
juice). Presumably you would need a container to put the cheeses in (which means
much larger containers for the pulp fermentation than used for the juice). Is it
feasible to ferment in the cheese, especially in terms of inoculating the cheese
with the yeast? Or would you need to build the cheese later with the fermenting
apple pulp?


Ideas? Instructions? Experiences?

Dave,
The kits sold in wine supply stores give a result as tartaric acid
equivalent, which is the US standard for wine.
In France, the acidity is expressed in equivalent of sulfuric acid.
For apples, the acidity is sometimes expressed in equivalent of malic acid.
The relation between these 3 is:
1% acidity as Tartaric = 0.65% as sulfuric = 0.89% as malic acid.


By the way, if you have bought the same type of kit that is sold around
here, the instructions probably suggest to use fairly a big syringe to do
your titration - and the bottles of chemical won't last long... You can buy
a precision syringe of 1 ml (normally used for insulin) for very cheap at
any drugstore and divide all volumes by a factor of 10 - your chemical will
last 10 times longer and the precision is not affected much. The only risk
is that the pharmacist might think you are a junkie - when I explained to
my pharmacist what I wanted to do with those syringes, he looked at me in a
sort of funny way... but he sold them to me.

This table below should help.  You can read the corresponding acidities
for each tartaric acid reading, or use the first line for conversion
figures.  For example, to change a TA figure from tartaric to malic,
multiply by 0.893.  For citric, multiply the TA in tartaric by 0.933.

David Daly has a kit that reads out tartaric acid concentrations and he asks
about conversion of these units to malic acid concentrations.


My math tells me the following are equivalent:
1.0000 % (wt/vol) malic acid
1.1194 % (wt/vol) tartaric acid
7.3135 ppt (parts per thousand) sulfuric acid


I'd appreciate someone double checking my figures.

True, but I am advised by Kevin Minchew of Tewkesbury that in some years
Kingston Blacks will produce a cider of about 8.5% alcohol by volume
quite naturally. I was told by another cider maker in Somerset that the
original orchard of these apples in the village of Kingston St Mary was
cut down by the local women because they were fed up with their menfolk
getting legless every night on the very strong cider made from these
particular apples.


On that subject, last year (2000) was a terrible one for apple and pears
here. We had a miserable summer and a very wet autumn. All the fruit I
used was way down in sugar content, and the result was lacking in full
flavour. This year, however, looks like being a cracker!


We have had a hot, sunny summer with just the right amount of rain, and
no frosts during blossom time. Plums and damson are very abundant and
sweeter than I can ever remember. Blackberries are very prolific and
big. Most apple trees I see are bearing a huge crop, and I am confident
that the sugar level will be high. This (real!) first year of the new
millennium could be a vintage one for British cider and perry.


I am sure Andrew Lea will confirm this.

The conversion factor is 0.893.  In practical terms, measure and
calculate as tartaric and just multiply the figure by 0.9 to get to
malic.  Not a huge difference, actually.
