Andrew,


Lallemand yeast producer suggests rehydration of dry yeast for 10 -15
minutes in 100-110F water NO SUGAR and immediately add this to your must.
This prevents cell rupture due to osmosis from the sugar solution and gets
you the highest number of viable cells.

I have a friend in the Swindon, Wiltshire, area who is looking to buy a small
cider press complete -  scratter, press, cloths, etc. He can collect.


As he is not online I have promised to pass on any information. 


Needless to say, this request is aimed only at the Southern UK!

If you check out my website you will find details of making a press from
a design which probably originated at Geneva NY, but at various times
has been republished by Ag Canada, by the Long Ashton Research Station
in the UK and in the Proulx and Nichols cidermaking book.


I made one about 10 years ago at about 1.5 times the published scale. 
I've used it for many seasons with an 8 ton bottle jack and it works
just fine.


Simple, effective and highly recommended!

Ok I apologise being so full of questions! Cannot cure myself of the need to
know everthing!
*


Now I am chsing up milling info as well.
I have seen the mill on the canadian ag site with the large hopper etc and
thought I could make that no worries but I do not think it would be any good for
other fruit, particularly grapes as it would be too fast etc. Am I right?


Having said that does anyone of you  guys who make cider and fruit wines use a
mill which is suitable for both or do I need to resign myself to having multiple
crushers/mills?


Thanks again for all you help!

G'day all again,


Further to my query for press plans which I received heaps of links (thanks!), I
wanted some idea of why a multi layer cheese type set-up would be
different/better than one of the basket types.


I also need to consider that I will be using it for all kinds of fruit pulp, eg.
pear,grape,stonefruit as well as apple.


Interestingly (well, to me anyway) I noticed that nearly all of the designated
"grape" press plans used a hand screw type of deal, whereas most of the "apple"
only types advocated for the most part using hydraulic jacks. Any comments on
relative efficieny of either.


Thanks so much for all your help.

G'day all,


I also received a query for a perry pear growers database to be set up as well
as the cider apple growers, so I have set aside a page for that as well. Links
are below.

Hello,


I'm new on the mailing liste. I live in Belgium and will try my first batch
of cider the following weeks at the north of France. I'll made it the
traditional way used in France (No addition at all, cuvage, defecation,...).
It's just to experience with the complete process. I don't think I'll get
very good cider. I just have some varieties of "pommes a couteau" what you
call dessert apples I think. I'll tell you about the results...


I'd also like to experiment about getting some very low alcoholic sparkling
cider and no alcoholic sparkling apple juice. Has anyone knowledges about
this?


For the first, I'm wandering if bootling fresh cider (apple juice) and then
wait for the correct CO2 pressure before pasteurization is OK? I guess some
problems of clearance, maybe a champagne method will partly solve the
problem.  For the apple juice, I don't see other way than artificial CO2
addition. And the pasteurization has to be done at the end, after CO2
addition.  Any opinions out there?


Thanks

Hi Mark.


I built a press in time for last year's "crush".
It consists of an inexpensive hydraulic shop press, some
thick plastic press plates, and a catch basin.


The press itself cost about $120 from Harbor Freight.
It's got a hydraulic car jack mounted in a frame made
from bolted-together cold-rolled steel:


http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=33497


The press plates themselves were made from 1/2" thick high-density
something-or-other plastic.... the same stuff
that they make cutting boards from.  I used a router to
rout some chanels to direct the juice flow.


The collection basin is the top of a rectangular plastic
storage box.  It fits between the press's uprights and
has a 3/4" high lip around the edge.  I drilled a hole in
one end.  I assembled a base for it from a couple hunks of
plywood laying about the shop, which I bolt to the press.
When I get handy with stainless steel, I'll make a good catch
basin out of sheet.


Total cost was probably close to $250, mostly because the
plastic for the press plates wasn't cheap.  Good quality plywood
painted with food-grade paint would be ok, and cheaper.


On the other hand, I needed a shop press anyhow...


A slightly wider one with a 20 ton ram would allow you to press
more pommace in one run.  We find that we can get about 2.5 US gallons
of juice per press load.


These cheap chinese presses are painted with some awful
paint, so clean it off well before starting to prevent paint
chips from falling into the juice.  I use a funnel with a
piece of cheesecloth as a filter just in case.




Eric
