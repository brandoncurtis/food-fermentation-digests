I hope this was just a translation error...

Hi -


I recently wrote in about my first cider - I followed a recipe in the
Cats Meow database and had to wait several days for fermentation to
begin after apparently adding too much sulfate. Fermentation finally
began and the smell from the air lock smelled 'normal' - that is, like
apples. It's been a little more than a week and the air lock is just
barely bubbling - but now the odor from the air lock is very sulfury. I
know that in beer brewing some yeasts throw off some pretty nasty odors
that dissipate over time. For this cider I used Red Star Montrachat
yeast. My question is - is this odor 'normal' for a cider made with this
yeast or is it the sign of trouble?


Thank You,
Carmen

re the posts about rehydrating dried yeast, I've developed a 'ritual' that
works well:  after rehydrating per packet directions [quite warm, not hot,
water for about 10 min til disolved], I add about a litre of 'room temp' fresh
juice to the yeast slurry [8 packets of yeast for a 50 gal batch] and leave it
til it starts to 'roil up', then add the minibrew to the very cool juice I'm
starting.  I ferment in 50 gal plastic barrels and 250 gal plastic tanks as
cold as possible, and decided that the 'thermal shock' wouldn't make for happy
yeast.  haven't had a failure with this method.  don't know about using
straight suger or syrup.


Mark, the equipment for apples and grapes does differ.  grapes aren't shredded
like apples, but go thru a pair of rollers just close enough to 'pop' the
berries.  proper grape crushers usually include a de-stemmer.   the small scale
grape presses are hand screw things because much less
pressure is used over a longer period of time.  apple structure allows rapid,
hard squeezing.  the rack and cloth style press is more effiecient for the
faster, larger volume pressing of apples and pears, the basket style press
[without cloths] works better with grapes and their comparitively large volume
of skin.  the grape press is aimed at 'wringing out' the fermenting pulp, which
will have already given up the bulk of it's liquid thru fermentation.  on a
larger commercial scale there are "bladder presses" that will handle both types
of fruit, but the initial crushing is still different, and of course they're
less effecient than a good hydraulic rack and cloth press for apples.  my setup
can get a litre from as little as 3 lbs of crisp, ripe apples, without taking
excessive care.
