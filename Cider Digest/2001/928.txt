Just curious if anyone is using an antique screw-type press.  I've had
*most* of a press for many years, but have lacked the baskets and cloths,
as well as a complete mill/grinder.  I've played  with a buddy's complete
press, driving the mill with a John Deere hit 'n' miss engine.  It made for
a great brewclub Saturday event, although we finished well after dark,
pressing 52 bushels of fruit


Does anyone have a spare mill?  Does anyone know of a source for plans (or
complete) for baskets and liner cloths?  And what the heck _is_ the proper
term for these items?

i am writing from australia, and it is very hard for me to obtain cider
apples so at the moment i am stuck with using store bought apple juice and
using cultured yeasts. up till now i have been using lager yeast but am
wondering if an ale yeast would be better? i would like to try just leaving
the juice to start fermenting on its own but i'm not sure this would work as
fruit juice manufacturers pasteurize the juice,etc. or could it work? i have
had very positive results from my approach which is just  21lt. apple juice
fermented in a normal plastic fermenter  with a packet of lager yeast,
racked and matured/stored in a 21lt. food grade plastic container. the
resulting cider is dry, and am also interested in knowing how to add more
sugar during fermentation and arrest the ferment so as to produce a
sweet/medium sweet cider.

As a relative "beginner", I have a question about the use of UV pasteurized
cider.  I am planning on using a champagne yeast for fermentation and am
wondering if UV pasteurized is OK to use (no additional chemicals are
added).  In my (single) past experience, I used non-pasteurized cider from a
local orchard.  However, the UV pasteurized type is becoming much more
available.  It has been my understanding that heat pasteurized cider does
not work well due to the change in taste that occurs during heating.  Thanks
for any advice!

According to Professor Cornelius Ough's book 'Winemaking Basics', yeast
growth will stop at around 30 psi pressure of carbon dioxide.  Actual
fermentation takes a higher pressure to inhibit, at around 100 psi. 
This level is just about the tops for which a heavy duty champagne
bottle is designed.  Presumably this is why the 'methode champenoise'
actually works - a sweetening syrup is added at final bottling
but any stray yeast cells which are present after disgorgement are too
much inhibited by the pressure to be able to grow or to referment the
added sugar.
