which is just  21lt. apple juice fermented in a normal plastic fermenter
with a packet of lager yeast, racked and matured/stored in a 21lt. food
grade plastic container. the resulting cider is dry, and am also interested
in knowing how to add more sugar during fermentation and arrest the
ferment so as to produce a sweet/medium sweet cider."


I make my cider from store bought juice all the time (Mott's 100% Juice -
no preservatives). I add some sugar, a pack of Champagne yeast and some
pectin enzyme. When finished fermenting, I add a bit of sweetness by 
throwing  in 250 grams of lactose per 23 litres of cider. Lactose does not
ferment and I find it takes a bit of the bite off the cider. I also add
1.5 cups of sugar for carbonation prior to placing in beer bottles.  It
all works just fine for me. Cheap and easy too.

Hello:
I have several batches of 2001 cider going right now with several different 
yeasts used, primarily wild.  I purchased separately some Russett juice3 
which I have in two carboys, each to which I added a different yeast: 
Wyeast sweet mead (I forget the number) and Wyeast 3632 dry mead.  Both 
musts started out with an SG of 1.062 on November 3 without any addition of 
sugars.  The sweet mead yeast-inoculated batch is down to 1.030, one week 
later (11/3).  The 3632 inoculated batch has dropped 1.005!  This is one 
week later!  Has anyone used this yeast and did they you have a similar 
experience?
TB
p.s. Mr. Dunn: could you please cross-post this to the mead list?  I just 
re-subscribed with my new e-mail.
