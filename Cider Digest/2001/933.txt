Hey.. I know it's bit late in the year, but I'm wondering if anyone
knows a good source of apple juice with appropriate varietals in
Southern or Central California. All of the apple orchards I've seen
around here tend to sell Empire or Fuji juice both of which have a
fairly lousy total acidity.

Last saturday, Jacques Pepin, the TV chef had a TG hour long
special that included a segment on bottling his home brewed
Normandy style cider. However, they served commercial wines
with their meal.

 Hi Everyone,
I finally got round to reading several Digests that had built up in the last 
month or so. I saw repeated mention of the use of champagne yeast to make 
cider. I know some cider books recommend it but, in my humble opinion, DO NOT 
EVER USE CHAMPAGNE YEAST! Everybody I've talked to that's made much cider 
agrees, while we have made some acceptable ciders with it, they all would 
have been better with some other yeast, any other yeast almost. Champagne 
yeast gives a fast strong ferment, which makes a harsh cider. Slower 
fermentation is better because it leaves more bouquet and sedulity.
I'm not sure I have a favorite yet, I'm still experimenting (I'm on batch #60 
currently) , but I would recommend starting out with Cote Des Blancs or an 
ale yeast, those have always worked well for me.
Respectfully, Shaun Shepherd

Regarding the tire bladder press...


Maybe its the cider talking here (one of my 2
year old bottles has a great apple flavor so I've
enjoyed a few cups) but I gotta say that the tire
bladder thingy I just read in the digest takes
the cake.  


I thought potters (and I am one) were the
cheapest souls on the earth (making tools from
discarded guitar strings and old plastic lids)
but cider makers have gone one better: cheap
tools that are technologically advanced!


I guess like attracts like.  How many cider
makers are potters, or vice versa??


Cheers!

Subject: Phenol in Cider?

Well, this was a nasty surprise.  We brought back two bottles of Lecompte 
Cidre Pays d'Auge AOC from the duty-free shop at Charles deGaulle.  Opened 
one for Thanksgiving, expecting a treat, and instead encountered a definite 
phenolic taste.  There is little aroma - either good or bad- but the 
medicinal taste is unmistakable.  And not pleasant, either; it gets worse 
the more you drink.


I looked through my cider books and can find no hints as to the cause of 
phenolic taste in cider.  Anybody else encounter this, and have any idea 
why an AOC cider would suffer such a defect?

Dick,
I really can't believe I didn't think about this before, for 2 reasons: 1-
I work with these pneumatic things every day, and 2- I am a mechanical
engineer in the real life - so I should think about those things... I use
these bladders as pneumatic actuators to apply pressure on experimental
setups in my university lab, and we have a couple of spares. You can be
sure I will have a pressing setup that will use one of them next fall... 
A quick calculation tells me I should obtain the same pressure I now get
with my screw press with only 40 psi air pressure in the bladder, easily
obtainable with a hand air pump.
The main problem I see with this is that these actuators are quite costly.
The last time I bought one for the lab, it was around 300$ CDN (200 US).
Used ones are not easily found because they are most often used on trucks,
and when they change them, they are useless: too worn out and leaky.
More on this next fall.

My note on aged cider a few digests back provoked a few comments...


To Arun, I send all my concoleances for this good stuff that went down the
drain. We should always taste before. It occured to me also to have
undrinkable young cider that became excellent after 3-4 years. It had been
partly made with a wild crab that had a very special aroma of bananas. But
it also contained a lot of tannins and the taste transformed a lot with time.


Bob asked if I sometimes add sulfite.
Very rarely, Bob. For 2 main reasons: 1- my apple mixtures are usually on
the sharp side and a cider that contains more acidity is much less prone to
disorders. And 2- I use sound apples that have been hand picked on the tree.
Once in a while, I add a bit of sulfite to the juice, when the 2 conditions
stated above are not met for a reason or another.
I do rince my press and equipment with a sulfite solution, but the quantity
that remains in the juice is negligible.

Andrew, on the question of if a naturally yeasted cider will keep better
than one that had added yeast, I'm not convinced. I have some difficulty to
believe that a good yeast would make the cider spoil sooner. The 1992
bottles I still have were done with Champagne yeast. I guess I will have to
taste them soon to find out.
On the other subject you brought, I agree with you that the best cider will
never taste the same as a good Champagne, but no other "Methode
champenoise" wine does either... In my opinion, there is some magic in a
good true Champagne that simply can't be matched by anything else.


And I would also like to thank "RJ" and Andrew for taking a bit of time to
answer my question on Sparkolloid.

To be fair to Dick and Dave, their lateral thinking is actually not
quite the same as the commercial bladder presses (Willmes or Idropress,
in which the bladder runs the whole length of the mash).  Having seen
the pictures of the bladder itself, it almost cries out to be
incorporated into a novel press design of its own! Given its profile, I
would guess you would need to retain the press plate but just ensure the
bladder was a snug fit inside the basket, and fix some form of top plate
to counter Isaac Newton's 'equal and opposite reaction'.  Presumably the
system could be operated just with a foot pump and would then be totally
'green'!


Do I detect the beginnings of a new cottage industry here?  Too late to
patent it it now - you've gone public!

Ben, I've had ciders in bottle for five years on their own yeast.
They're still fine but they never go biscuity!  I wish you luck but I
believe the problem is something more fundamental relating to the
different biochemistry of grapes vs apples and it's something we'll
never be able to do anything about!
