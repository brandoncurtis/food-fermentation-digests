Hello


I've been following the discussion about champagne yeast with interest. 
Lallevin has convinced me to try DV10 this year instead of 1118.  I
start the fermentation with the addition of some fermaid k ad well to
make sure that it gets the opportunity to ferment fully.


It's too early to tell whether the DV 10 will leave a smoother mouthfeel
or not.  Unfortunately, I didn't do a control group with 1118 this year
so I will only be able to compare this year to last.  It won't be a fair
direct comparison because my fruit gave me a better juice this year.


However, it is certainly obvious that it ferments differently.  I'll
report more later in the new year.

The usual problem here is that people do not realise how much acid there
can be in an apple juice, often getting up towards 1%. Once the sugar is
all fermented away that acid becomes really exposed and people -
especially brewers - are shocked by what they find. (In a beer there are
always residual unfermentable oligomeric sugars - not so in ciders - and
the acid in a beer is ten times lower than in an apple).  If you cannot
choose low acid apples in the first place (difficult for most people),
then the only option is to add sugar (or some other sweetener).


I suggest you sweeten your cider back to around SG 1.010 to 1.015 and
then be prepared to drink it within a few days or to pasteurise in
bottle to keep it. Details on my website.  Once you've got that sugar /
acid balance right you'll be surprised how drinkable it'll become!
