While we are doing milestones, I would like to use this 1001-st digest 
to thank all the past posters to the digest.  Unlike wine or 
beermaking, there are no "advanced" cidermaking books, and so this 
digest is the indispensable resource for the serious cider-maker.  
Without it I would be nowhere compared to where I am.  In particular, 
I'd like to thank our leading authority, Andrew Lea, for his past and 
continued involvement in the digest.


Toward the perfect batch by digest 1500!


Scott

Another opinion. Cider takes time, like wine it takes time to develop
character. Be patient and allow your fermentations to take on the structure
and flavors of the juice from which it was made. Think of cider as being the
inner sole of the apple. Like string theory, it is the apple universe turned
into a complex structure and flavors so like and unlike the original
product.


Susan and I have done several presentations this fall, having the audience
sample the apples we use, sweets, bittersweets, bittersharps and sharps and
how they become cider. The connections are remarkable, how these typically
chewy, tannin flavored and sharp tasting apples make a remarkable, enjoyable
cider like our Vintage Cider. Enjoy the journey.


Thank you Dick for keeping the Digest, and putting up with our poor grammar,
spelling and lame email products we use.

You probably wouldn't be too excited about the "cider kits" sold in homebrew 
shops in the UK, usually with the beer kits or between them and the wine 
kits. The typical kit is a 1.5kg can of mostly concentrated apple juice 
(with some sugar and occasionally caramel). I think that (as with beer kits) 
the instructions are generally to dissolve the kit in hot water with 1.5kg 
of sugar, top up to 22 litres, and add the packet of yeast.


On the other hand, the result can't be any worse than some of the nasty 
stuff sold as "cider" here. (In contrast to some of the very good cider 
available if you look for it.)

Hey all,
        I'm planning to visit Northern France in a few weeks and was
wondering if anybody could make recommendations for things to see that
would be interesting to cider maker.  I'm really at a loss for cider
info.  I know the French produce great cider in the Normandy area, but how
would one find out more?  Any english tours?  Brand recommendations?
