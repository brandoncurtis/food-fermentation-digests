Pretty typical.  I don't care to use champagne yeast anymore
as it ferments far too dry for my taste.  Ale yeast will leave
some residual sweetness.  I've also had good results with the 
cider yeast from WYeast (#3766).  Someone here in the homebrew 
club suggested mead yeast.  Not a bad idea.  I have not tried 
it yet, though.


Every year I also do a natural fermentation.  Just put 2 gallons 
of cider in a sterile carboy, put an airlock on it, and see what 
you get.  Some years are better than others, but it's always fun 
to see how it turns out.


You may also want to try smaller batches until you find a recipe 
that works.  If something goes wrong, it's much less painful to 
pour out two gallons than five!  The disadvantage is that if it
turns out really good, two gallons disappear pretty quickly.

Thanks very much for the advice. However, I again tasted the cider and found 
it very much to my liking. So, I bottled it! In fact, as it ends up the cider 
is about 7.5% and really packs a punch. It is still not as sweet as I would 
have liked but I really do like this stuff.  My question is: Is this stuff 
safe?  I put the bottles in my cellar where I plan to age it a bit (if I can 
keep my hands off it). Should I have waited to bottle? And  how long should 
it age?


Thanks again One and all

In addition to Andrew Lea's excellent observations about Matt's comments
below, here's another 2 cents worth.
As a winery owner, I see many hundreds of folks from all over the world.
Mostly, the Europeans are receptive to stronger, more complex, even
quirky wines and ciders. Mostly, Americans are looking for one
dimensional "nice" wines and ciders (I call these "Barbie").


Of the Americans who aren't so easily scared, there are two types; the
first are those who have traveled widely and have developed versatile
pallates, the second are those who have grown up in the country on food
and drink that is homemade.

I'm in Eastern Massachusetts and all the apple farms are in Western Mass,
and I'm too lazy to drive 75 miles to get 10 gallons of apple cider. That
leaves me buying gallon jugs of prepackaged cider from the city farmstands.=
 Since I can't play with different apple blends to get different flavors,
I'm left with adjuncts.


I decided to experiment with my very first batch of cider, which  probably
wasn't a great idea, but in any case I added about 1/4 cup of cider spice
(spices used to make mulled cider/wine) to the juice as I transferred from
the primary to the secondary. I'm probably going to leave it in there for
3-4 weeks, and then bottle.


>>and it tasted quite sour, but not vinegary.  Will this
mellow out?  If so, how long should I expect it to sit


Well, I'm on my first carboy of cider, and I had the same problem about a
month after i pitched yeast - a harsh aftertaste.  Although everything
I've read indicates that is a temporary problem that solves itself, given
enough time.


>>in the secondary and then the bottle?  Are these
typical results for cider made with champagne yeast?


I'm using wyeast's cider yeast, and the brochure explicitly states sulphur
smells during fermentation.

Today I received a list of 500 varieties of apples available as
scionwood. On this list is Campfield. From everything I've ever read
this apple is suppose to be extinct. I was just wondering if possibly
it's not, or is someone just trying to take advantage of cider lovers
who would love to find this apple.

Is there a way to calculate PH if you know the acid of fresh cider by
titration? I've been told you can't but it seems there must be a way if
you assume what the acid is from freshly pressed cider.

Does anybody on the List have experience using lager yeast to ferment 
cider?  How well did it work?  What is its alcohol tolerance?


I note that White Labs now offers a cider yeast.  Has anyone tried this?
