hello-
new to cider making and im wondering if it is possible to resweeten a cider 
that has fermented too dry after fermentation has occurred and if so what 
techniques can be used? also wondering when is it best to bottle the cider, 
after fermentation has visibly ceased and you rack off the sediment or should 
it be kept in a seperate carboy and bottled a later date letting the cider 
age a bit? also wondering if it is possible to use pasturized cider? i have a 
regular supplier of un pastuerized but im sure his supplies wont last all 
winter.
thanks- brian

The great puzzle here is that this yeast is unknown in England! I am
really intrigued to know what it is.  My guess is that it might be the
Australian Wine Yeast AWY350 which I mentioned here a little while
back.  It's listed in the UK yeast culture collection as a cider yeast
(we promoted it heavily for that purpose in my Long Ashton days) and it
certainly forms compact bottoms.

This is true, and for this reason the brewer's concept of 'attentuation'
has no meaning in wine or cider fermentations where all the sugars are
technically fully fermentable (unlike wort). Having said that, it is an
empirical sensory fact that some wine yeasts (especially of the
so-called Champagne strains) do seem to produce much dryer dry ciders
than others.  Whether this is truly due to residual unfermented (rather
than unfermentable) sugars is a fact yet to be established,  so far as I
know.

I have a few extra bushels of cider apples to sell if anyone is close
enough to come pick them up.  These are #1 fruit and $18 a bushel.
Spitzenberg, Nickajack, Newtown Pippin, Wickson crab, Porter's
Perfection etc,  also Goldrush and Fuji.  Am located 50 miles west of
Springfield , Illinois.
