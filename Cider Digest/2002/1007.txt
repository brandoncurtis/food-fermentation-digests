There is a rare cider book for sale on Ebay.  It's 'Vinetum Britannicum: or, 
a Treatise of Cider' published in 1676.  Former owned by Robert Hogg.  
Interesting to look at...  See auction #1971983907 or search under 'cider 
book'.  I have nothing to do with this book but though it would be on 
interest to this group.

OK, folks, this issue of the digest is super-small because there's only
one article submitted in a week+.  I'm sending out the digest anyway
because that one article needs to get out (if it's not already too late)
and so that people don't start worrying that they've been unsubscribed
or that the digest has fallen off the edge of the earth.
