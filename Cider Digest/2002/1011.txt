Some of the cidermakers in the Northwest are working with the research 
center at Washington State University to produce and analyze some varietal 
ciders using the cider apples grown at Mount Vernon. It's too early to have 
any useful information from that project, but it's in process. If there's a 
standard method for measuring tannin, please let me know and I'll share it 
with the people who can apply it to these ciders.


I know there are others from the "upper left-hand corner" reading the Cider 
Digest. Maybe one or more of them knows more about this than I do and will 
share more details.

Just a note on tannin and keeving.  For the record, I have not yet 
keeved.  But I did make an interesting observation this season.


This year my regular sources of apples (in central New York) were 
rather sparse.  A friend has several old and large pear trees and 
they bore heavily (must have avoided the killing frost).  These trees 
bear a very small, high Brix, and extremely astringent fruit.  It is 
a pure astringency, without any bitterness.  Legend has it that they 
were planted in 1950 by a Swiss farmer for brandy production.  We 
don't know the actual variety.  I shook down 18 bushels of these 
pears (a small fraction of the total available).  I also picked seven 
bushels of Golden Russet and three bushels of Ida Red apples.  At the 
mill, I blended all of the apples with three bushels of the pears. 
Then I pressed the remainder of the pears, along with two bushels of 
a more flavorful pear from a local tree.


The most immediately striking result was the juice which issued from 
the press tank.  Both juices were relatively clear, without the usual 
haze found in freshly pressed juices.  There was a very substantial 
quantity of sludge at the bottom of the tank.  This sludge rapidly 
settled to the bottom of the juice containers, forming heavy lees.


In the past, I have used approximately half as many tannic pears 
(relative to apples) in my blend and have never experienced this 
"self fining".  Even the smaller amount of pears contributed a 
significant level of tannins to the final cider.  I have never 
pressed the pears on their own before this season.  My hunch at this 
point is that there is a threshold level of tannins required to 
achieve precipitation of the lees.


Both the cider and the perry have significant tannin levels at 
racking.  The cider is quite balanced, while the perry is rather 
overly astringent.  The astringency has dropped considerably since 
pressing, but I would still like to lower it more.  I am considering 
egg white fining, and I would appreciate some experience anyone would 
like to share on the matter.


Thanks.

A long hot humid growing season here in the US does have an effect on
tannins but I think overcroping the tree and resulting bienial bearing
is the greater problem, not enough tannins, carbos, to go around for too
many fruit.  Try thinning your trees to one fruit per cluster, 8-10
inches apart, learn to use chemical thinners (sevin, NAA)  Will upsize
your fruit and Quality of fruit.

Folks-
Several comments on recent postings:


The time of ripening for European bitter varieties in most regions of 
the US (excepting those with cool maritime climates) should be 
considerably earlier than those reported for Southwest England or 
Normandy/Brittany.  Our plantings of these varieties in the Finger 
Lakes region of New York-typical growing degree days or cumulative 
heat units around 2500 degrees (calculated to base temperature 
threshold 50 F), usually frost free from early May to mid 
October-have ripened about one month earlier here than they do in 
western Europe.  Even the latest maturing varieties-such as Medaille 
d-Or, Brown Snout, Chisel Jersey and Porters Perfection-usually ripen 
by the third week of October.  So if you are in a region where Fuji 
or Northern Spy will ripen properly, you should have little trouble 
ripening the late- maturing European bitter varieties on the tree. 
Be prepared for substantial pre-harvest fruit drop as you wait for 
these cider varieties to ripen, and consider mulching or letting the 
grass grow beneath your trees as autumn approaches so that the drops 
will land on a clean soft surface instead of in the mud!


On the topic of rootstocks: For many practical reasons we generally 
prefer dwarfing stocks such as M.9 or Bud.9 for dessert apples, and I 
began growing the traditional bittersweets and bittertarts five years 
ago with the assumption that these should also be grown on dwarfing 
stocks.  As these trees came into production I began to question the 
wisdom of that assumption. Many of the cider varieties appear to be 
very sensitive to heat or photo-oxidative stress  of fruit that are 
fully exposed to sunlight, even under the relatively cool growing 
conditions of upstate New York.  The past two growing seasons we have 
had a foretaste of global warming, experiencing several weeks of 
temperatures in the mid-90s (F), and there has been substantial heat 
and sunscald damage to many of the cider apples on dwarf trees with 
open canopies.  Since red or blush fruit color is not so necessary 
for cider as for fresh market dessert apples, and high fruit color is 
a primary rationale for the narrow stature and open canopy of dwarf 
trees, I am beginning to think that we should consider growing the 
traditional European cider apples on semi-dwarf trees (M.7 and CG.30 
would be my preferences for the Northeast USA) with reduced pruning 
and a more dense canopy, more like pears than desert apples.


On the tannins east vs. west question: Even within a single variety 
and growing region there is substantial variation in total tannins 
from year to year.  For desired astringency and other qualities in 
your cider blends, I suggest you try to keep your tree nitrogen 
levels on the low side (below 2% leaf N on a dry weight basis).  This 
will concentrate the sugars in fruit, promote a slower primary 
fermentation which should minimize the stripping of desirable 
fruit-flavor volatives by CO2 bubbles.  Low N supply will also reduce 
fruit size, which inevitably increases the tannin content of your 
juice because smaller fruit have a higher surface-to-flesh ratio, and 
most of the tannins are in the skins.  Smaller fruit resulting from 
low-N supply will also reduce preharvest push-offs of fruit set in 
doubles or triples on a spur, which is a tendency of many 
bittersweets and bittertarts.  During the first several years after 
planting, when you are growing these tree to fill their allocated 
space, it is usually advantageous to supplement nitrogen, minimize 
weed competition, and irrigate to maintain shoot growth during the 
summer.  Once your cider trees begin to bear fruit you can reduce or 
eliminate fertilizer N except on the least fertile soils, consider 
maintaining a close-mowed sod beneath the trees, and be sparing with 
irrigation (this is called regulated deficit irrigation, and there 
are publications explaining how to do it in places like California or 
Washington where irrigation is essential) during the months 
approaching harvest. These are all common practices in vineyards 
striving for high quality wine grapes, and if you are growing apples 
for high quality ciders, the wine-grape growers mind-set may be more 
appropriate than the dessert apple growers mind-set.

Jason MacArthur asked, in CD 1010, about  English and French varieties that
withstand cold, as he lives in Vermont.  I live in Minnesota which may be
even colder. I planted Kingston Black, Trembletts Bitter and Ellis Bitter,
all on M-7 rootstock, in the spring of 2000. In December of 2000 we had an
unusually early cold snap.  On Christmas Eve it was -35F with only 2 - 4
inches of snow.  It was COLD.  The weather was cold for a considerable
period both before and after.  It is normal to get well below 0 F but not
until the middle of January, and not that cold. The Kingston Black and Ellis
Bitter survived.  The Trembletts Bitter froze out entirely.  That same year
we planted some Gala and Dayton.  They also froze out.  Minnesota varieties
that were planted the same year survived.  The cider varieties and the
Dayton came from Jim Cummins nursery, the Gala from a different nursery, so
the nursery is not an issue.  In 2001 the Kingston and Ellis were lethargic.
The leaves looked good, but not much growth took place.  In 2002 they both
took off, growing like weeds.  Theses two varieties, at least, appear to be
able to withstand severe cold.  For background, my orchard is planted on a
very gentle slope.  The soil is light but good organic topsoil down 2 - 3
feet, then breaking to coarse sand and gravel mix. There is very little
clay.  It is irrigated with drip irrigation.  Most of our 6000 trees are on
M-26, Mark and M-7, and all are doing very well, so I think the variety is
the issue, and nothing else. I look forward to hearing about other's
experience with English and French varieties in cold areas.

Dick,  it will be a couple of years before I can contribute to this
answer but I'm in a coastal area (Annapolis, Md. quarter mile from the
Chesapeake bay) and have just started a cider specific orchard
consisting of two Karmijn de Sonnaville's, four Ashmead's Kernel's, two
Kingston Blacks, a Harry Master's Jersey, a Fox Whelp, two Medaille d'
or's, a Brown's apple, a Dunkerton Late Sweet, a Dabinett, and of course
a Cox's Orange Pippin.  I should see token fruit on several of the
scions in a couple of years (I'll pluck any blossoms I see this coming
season)  I already have one Hewes crab and a Spitzenberg, a Milo Gibson,
a Sunrise+, a Sasha X Red flesh.  Part of the plants went in late fall
this year and the majority of the rest will go in in March (with the
exception of two additional Hewes Crabs I'm having grafted up and will
not be in receipt of until fall 2003.) and I'm also going to get
exhaustive soil testing done (haven't done it in several years but the
area where the orchard has gone into was a field I had put some 40 tons
of topsoil and horse manure into for garden purposes about 5 years
ago.)  I also have a full weather station here and meteorological data
for almost ten years in this location. (for those of you that don't know
... this region is humid and sticky most of the year except dead winter
when it's just humid and cold). Several of your list members (Jim
Cummins not the least thereof) have excellent stock in cider varieties
and I know for a fact he got some fruit off of his Kingston Blacks this
last fall.  I'm sure he could be persuaded to test for tannin in his
stock, as could the folks at Big Horse Nursery down in the Appalachian
Mountains of North Carolina.
I've had an impossible time getting apples around here for cider to make
my Cyser and hard cider from, and have had to use McCutcheon's
commercial product for the past several years (crab apples are
impossible to find in this region ... the green grocers try to pass
"lady's apples" off on you as "crab apples".. which is only slightly
less incorrect than trying to claim pool and snooker are the same
sports. - sigh -

My father wants to put in some fruit trees in this spring, and I have been
given permission to slip a cider apple tree or two in among them in exchange
for doing the selection and ordering.  There will most likely be 4 or 5
apple trees, at least 2 or 3 of which will be apples for eating.    My
initial thought is to put in a Kingston Black with a dessert apple that will
blossom at the right time for pollination, but I am open to suggestions. 
Can anyone think of a combination of cider tree(s) and eating apple tree(s)
that would pollinate well?  Taken a step further, if the eating apple
happened to also be a good blender for cider then that would be good as
well.  The location is in west-central Illinois on the line between zones
4 and 5 (10" or so topsoil over clay, but Jonathons have done pretty well
there).


Also, if anyone has a source for good trees I would be interested in that
also (on or off list).  Cummins Orchard in NY seems to have everything, and
since the total number of trees will be 11 or more the price will be good.
I am also considering ordering scionwood from the great collection at
Washington State and grafting, but that would probably put the cropping a
year behind and be less reliable.  Any comments on eating/perry pears
appreciated also.  Thanks,  Chad Brown

In the last CD, I thnk it was Dick Dunn who wrote:


"And the US covers such a variety of climates...I'm not sure what common 
factor there would be.  (Are English apples bitter that the folks over 
there still drive on the wrong side of the road?:)"


I had been doing some poking (as an amatuer) into evaluating climate as part
of site selection.  I based my comparisons on the methods of John Gladstones
as printed in 'Viticulture and Environment' and some subsequent articles.
Gladstones examines grape growing in the context of about a dozen
environmental parameters.  these can be determined for specific sites, or
estimated from regional data.  I trolled the info for the southern half of
Lake Michigan from the NWS and NOAA databases.


I put the data from about 30 monitoring stations into a database and then
had Arcview GIS software draw me color coded contour maps.  This method is
aimed a grapes - but apples have a similar growing season here in the
midwest.  I anycase, it allows comparison across diverse areas.  Of climate
at least - not soil or ecosystems.  Gladstones has some tables of other wine
growing areas - I have not checked for Northern France. (I'll have to put it
on my to-do list :-)


When I was doing my research, I found that several states have put
comparable data on the web.  Virginia for instance.  And a student somewhere
used to have the Niagara region on the web.  It would be nice to have info
on some of the English apple growing regions.


If there is interest, I can put the maps I made on the internet.

I too will be planting a cider orchard in Vermont next year, and have 
already ordered the trees.  My overseas varieties include Bedan, Brown's 
Apple, Brown Snout, Michelin, Dabinett, Foxwhelp, Kingston Black, and 
Tremlett's Bitter.  I am also including several Russets and a number of 
eaters including Sweet 16, Keepsake, Black Oxford, Blue Pearmain, and some 
others.  I am just outside of Montpelier, VT at 1500 ft elevation.  I based 
my choices on advice from my nurseryman, Jim Cummins, and talks with some 
area growers with experience with these cultivars, especially Steve Woods 
at <http://www.povertylaneorchards.com/>Poverty Lane Orchards / 
<http://www.farnumhillciders.com/>Farnum<http://www.farnumhillciders.com/> 
Hill Cider.  I also have a decade of experience growing commercial and 
research fruit in the region, and so extrapolated some from there where 
local information was lacking.  I am not expecting all of my varieties to 
perform well here, but I can always topwork the undesirable varieties at a 
later date.  Were I to place my order today, I probably would include 
Yarlington Mill.
I haven't directly answered the question however, as I have no experience 
with anyone growing these at such a high elevation in Zone 4.  A perusal of 
the list from Farnum Hill may provide some insight for the varieties you 
are looking at.


Best of luck!
