Greetings all;


I have a problem and need advice.  I have made about 30 - 40 gallons of 
cider this year from a variety of apples.  Most of these are fermented 
on the pomace and not pressed until after primary fermentation slows. 
 All natural yeast's and little to no sulfite.  Two of the varieties I 
made cider from yielded less than a 5 gallon carboy's worth and after 
the pressing and residual primary completed its course, the process 
"stuck" and after a week a thin layer of white mold began to form!  I 
did a little reading and learned that having a large head space volume 
can be one of the factors causing this.  I mixed together the two small 
batches into a 6.5 gallon carboy, added two cups of cane sugar and some 
sulfite (50 - 75 ppm) and after a few days the fermentation took off 
again.  I recently (three weeks ago) racked off the lees a nicely 
cleared amber colored cider with good aroma back into a 5 gallon carboy. 
 Now, ready with sterile bottles, I get ready to pull this carboy out of 
it's nice cool cave (under the steps in the laundry room) and to my 
dismay find the very small head space covered with a layer of this same 
white mold!


What should I do?  Can I save this batch or is this destined for 
"dewatering" or worse...drain flushing (I need clarification on the 
reference/connection to sex).


Thanks in advance

I have been watching this list for some time now and I'm impressed by
the breadth and depth of knowledge shared here.    I am getting back
into cider making after a few years off.


I am using apple cider purchased from a local orchard ( a blend of Fuju,
Limbertwig, Stayman, and Pink Lady ).  The cider is pasteurized and
contains a small amount of potassium sorbate.  I have tried batches with
and without SO2 or yeast nutrient.   I have used packaged wine yeast and
liquid English Cider Yeast.  The starting gravity is around 1.048.    I
start the yeast in a pint of cider and there is activity but after I
pitch  I don't see any activity for days.   I am attempting to ferment
at around 62 to 69 F ( 17 to 20 C ).


Any suggestions as to why my fermentation is not proceeding?

Hi All,
Dan Spoelstra wondered about freezing juice to ferment later. It's worked out 
fine for me. I've fermented some that was left over from the previous season 
even a couple of times. I have also sulfited and refrigerated early juices 
like Gravenstein for use in November.
He also wanted to Know what to plant to go with his desert apples for cider. 
Bittersweets is what his cider needs. I recommend Yarlington Mill and Nehou 
or Dabinett, they seem to grow and produce well and be fairly disease free 
hereabouts. For a bittersharp I think Virginia Crab should be tried.
Good Luck,

One three-gallon carboy, which I was just thinking it would be time to
bottle, has gone and un-cleared itself.  Storage hasn't changed.  Its
history is: fermented, racked, sorbated and sulfited, added some fresh
juice, sparkalloided, sat for a few months.  A month ago, it was clear.
Now it's still clear near the bottom, but cloudy in the top two thirds
- -- pretty sharply stratified.


(A sibling carboy, by the way, got the other half of the racking from
the primary, but skipped the sorbate-sulfite-juice.  It's still clear.
And darker in color, maybe with the sulfite; I didn't notice if they
used to be the same.)


All that comes to mind is a fermentation picking up crud, too slow to
show bubbles or pressure in the airlock.  This would likely be bad news
now.  Any ideas what's happening in here, or what to do with it?  Right
now I'm inclined to let it sit some more.  When I do go to bottle it
I'll see if it's gone nasty.
