Hello all,


I am new to the list - a member of the Growwine list
refered your list as a good place to talk cicer and
apples.


I am looking for scionwood to graft this winter,
namely Roxbury Russet, Ribston Pippin, Yarlington Mill
and "Pomme grise",  from a source in Canada.  Any
suggestion as to other cider apples that would grow in
the Eastern townships of Quebec a zone 4)? 
Apparently, Yarlington has survived the terrible
1980-81 winter in St.Jean, but I do not know about the
other cider apples.


I found some nurseries to carry them, but I want to
graft on some real dwarfing rootstock so I need my own
scionwood.


Sincerely,


Martin Pare,
Eastern Townships, Quebec, Canada

Sounds like a film yeast.  It will only grow in the presence of air.  If
you rack and bottle the cider it shouldn't re-form in bottle, but you
could add sulphite to be quite sure.  In future, use a good air lock at
all times and maybe use sulphite when fermenting too. Film yeasts can be
tolerated in small amounts but they tend to destroy flavour if allowed
to proceed unchecked. Sulphite will knock 'em out.

Almost certainly the sorbate is the culprit.  This is added to the juice
as a yeast inhibitor and is obviously doing its job! Sulphite will also
synergise its effect.

Curious!! If it's cloudy at the top it almost sounds like it's got a
bacterial infection and is going acetic where it can get at the air.
Does it smell vinegary?  Otherwise has it got very cold at all, which
might either stratify it and/or shock out a haze? Or perhaps you've
added too much Sparkalloid?  It is possible to overfine and create new
hazes!

My family and I have a 100 acre farm in Central Ontario (zone 5b)
Canada.  We have a couple of dozen apple trees which would have been
bearing fruit this year had they not been so badly attacked by rabbits
and deer last winter.  They are coming back but this year I made cider
from bought apple juice.  It is still fermenting slowly.


We have 3 pear trees which seem unaffected by many of the diseases which
mar the apples.  After reading an article in Zymurgy about perry, I
thought that perhaps pear trees would be the way to go.  The next
problem is where to find a source for varieties of pear trees suitable
for perry.  Any suggestions?


Thanks.

There lies your problem.  Pasteurized cider is fine to ferment with, and 
sulfites can certainly be used in the process.  Potassium sorbate, however, 
will not allow your cider to ferment.

I have had this occur before, particularly when I "oaked" a cider by adding 
a handful of oak chips to the nearly finished product for bulk 
aging.  Although I steamed the chips in hope of sterilizing/sanitizing, it 
appears that some creepy-crawly got through.  This happened with two 
batches.  I carefully racked the cider at battling time to another clean 
carboy, leaving the floating mold behind.  This is done easiest by using a 
small diameter racking cane that will not "stir up" the cider as it's 
racked.  I the added 50 ppm of sulfite and bottled.  This is the only time 
I have ever sulfited at bottling.  One carboy was bottled into corked wine 
bottles, the other kegged.  Both are gone now, so I don't know how they 
would stand up to the test of time.  Your best bet may be to bottle with 
sufite and drink it soon or give it to friends.  Mine tasted great, by the 
way, possibly the best batch I've ever done.

Drain flushing to me means what it says...dumping it down the drain.  Some 
may make some connection to 'releasing the swim team,' though

Subject: Tasting results

Last Friday night I participated in a cider tasting where we sampled some 
20 ciders, both commercial and homemade.  Of the ciders, all were what I 
would call "real" cider, i.e. no Bulmer's products or the like were 
offered.  The results were a little bit surprising in some respects, yet 
not so in others.  I plan to do a full report soon to offer to the digest, 
but until then, allow me to suggest to any cider makers out there with 
commercial aspirations that a bone-dry, super tannic, classic English cider 
may not be the product to offer the American palate, even one experienced 
with cider.


Expect the results to be posted before long...

Methinks your must itself is infected. Either flush it, or pasteurize or
filter it, and re-inoculate with a desirable yeast strain.


Do you have a bottle of something not infected with mold to culture good wild 
yeast from?

Your problem is probably due to potassium sorbate, which is a
preservative that prevents yeast reproduction.  I don't know how to
correct the problem other than to start over with sweet cider that does
not contain potassium sorbate.
