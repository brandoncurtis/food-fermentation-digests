This is interesting because after tasting a cider brought back to the US 
from England I experienced just such a 
beverage....dry....tannic...acidic......in my opinionl, it was to die 
for.  I've tried the commercial alco-pop ciders here in the US and a few 
homemade ciders but nothing compared to this.  I'd venture a guess that if 
I could really learn to make a cider this good my fermeters and cellar 
would look much different than they currently do.


To each his own.

Martin, I have all those mentioned plus others in my zone 4 small orchard
in the county of Charlevoix (80 km NE of Quebec City). They all do quite
well except Roxbury who might not have a long enough season to mature,
although it appears hardy.
Others that do well are Brown's apple, Bulmer's Norman and Breakwell's
Seedling. Some English cider varieties that don't seem to like it here are
Porter Perfection and Stoke Red. I also test a few others for which I can't
yet give an opinion: Chisel Jersey, Brown Snout, Muscadet de Dieppe,
Medaille d'or, Tremlett Bitter, Reine des pommes.
You may write to me off list (in French...) if you want more details.

Martin, I have imported a few years ago 6 varieties of perry pears from the
Corvallis facility in Oregon - they have a fantastic collection of pear
cultivars. These haven't produced yet at my place but seem hardy. This
year, I am making my first perry from mostly Golden Spice pears, a variety
which is generally available in Canada and which appears suitable for this
use - it contains much more acidity than most pears, is quite bitter and
presses readily. In a few months, I will be able to tell you what it tastes
like. You may see a picture of Golden Spice, along with a few other pears
that I grow, at the following WWWeb page:
http://www.gmc.ulaval.ca/pers/cjoli/tmp/pears.htm
I too find that pear trees are much less affected by insects and sickness
than apple trees.
You may also contact me off list for more details...


Claude, Quebec.
