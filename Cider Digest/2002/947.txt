        There are a number of fermentation by-products that are normally
very dilute in wine.  Methanol, acetaldehyde, 2,3 butanediol, and heavier
alcohols also known as fusel oils.  Most are metabolic products unrelated to
alcoholic fermentation.  Pectin breakdown and fruit acid digestion account
for a lot.


        All are toxic to some extent - so is ethanol for that matter, but
they are dilute in wine - maybe 1-2% of the ethanol amount.  Heavy alcohols
are usually very intoxicating compared to ethanol.  I understand that Soviet
era Russians would spike vodka with n-propanol (not iso-propyl 'rubbing'
alcohol) for the extra kick.  But things like n-pentanol are extra toxic,
too.


        Since these materials have different boiling points than ethanol, a
distillation can sort them out.  Lighter and heavier fractions can simply be
discarded.


        A fractional crystalization (freeze distillation), however,
concentrates ALL non-water components equally.  Ethanol and other compounds
alike get left behind.  Hence apple jack's reputation for potentcy AND
hangovers.


        Simply letting it air for a while would let things like acetaldehyde
(which gives Budweiser ITS kick) evaporate off.  The alcohol dehydrogenase
enyzme prefers ethanol over methanol, so competitive excluse keeps _low_
levels of methanol from being toxic.  (The liver works on the ethanol, while
the kidneys flush out the methanol.)  But there's no way to remove the
higher order alcohols other than distillation.

Sir,
I don't know if this comes under potential materiel for the Cider Digest
but if so I would very much appreciate it if you could include the
following message.


We are looking for a cidery to contract manufacture a hard cider product
to test market under our own label.  We are looking for a dry cider of
up to 6.9% alcohol.
One of us is a lawyer familiar with ATF and state authorities.  We will
take care of all legal requirements related to contract manufacturing.


If you have extra capacity and an interest in further discussion we
would like to get in
touch with you and can be reached at (917) 692-1193 or at
palm70@aol.com.
If you are not interested in working with us but would be willing to
share your experiences bringing cider to market, or if you could
recommend another cidery who might be interested, we also would much
appreciate a chance to talk to you.


Thanks,
Si Hyland
Brandywine Cider Company

Hello everyone,
   I am looking for a good cider press or plans, if anyone has one, to




For anyone interested I have a Goodnature SX 200 for sale.  You can look
at the press on the website: www.goodnature.com/juice/sx200.html


Its been barely used, located in Central California

Mike:


I have used pasteurized juice (uh "cider") without any noticeable change in
the alcohol content.  There was a flavor difference, of course, that can't
be helped.  The only thing I can think of that would affect yeast
performance is either pH problem or they actually used preservatives in
their juice.

> David,

While I am no microbiologist, I have fermented, distilled and tasted
ciders and their distillates produced under different circunstances and
can offer some qualitative feedback on fusel oils, etc.
First of all, Methanol is a toxic chemical added to alcoholic solutions
in order to render them poisonous to humans. This is done in the hope
that  1. people will not drink "rubbing alcohol" or other nonbeverage
alcoholic products and 2. people will purchase tax paid products that
the government has licensed and recieved money for.
Cider and other fruit based fermentive products do contain undesireable
compounds, chief among these are fusel oils. To put it loosely, these
fusel oils are to calvados what turpentine is to ethanol, or what a
headache is to inspiration.


Two factors will affect how much  "bad stuff "is in the distillate; 1.
how old the cider is: When cider is properly aged it will either convert
(chemically) or drop out (sedimentation) most of the "bad stuff" and 2.
the conditions under which the juice was fermented; when the yeast is
stressed by excess temperature, inadequate nutrition or the presence of
too much sulfer or nitrogen it will produce byproducts that will
adversely affect cider and it's distillate.
So, one way to avoid "bad stuff" is to properly age cider before
distillation (subjective) and the other is to discard the heads and
tails of the distillate (which takes a fair amount of experience).


Regardless of what the Annie and Lew book says I would relate a friends
recollection of "cyderheads" while living in England. These were the
poor souls in England who were overly devoted to the benefits of
"cidre". They tended to posess red eyes, foggy speech, foggy memory and
a large appetite for cidre;  perhaps these folks  are in dire need of
proper dilution. : )
