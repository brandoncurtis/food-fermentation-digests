I have reread my note to you all re making cider from the pasteurized
Calif juice and find that I should have added to my original note
several additional facts.


The problem batch was my second batch made from pasteurized juice here
in Calif.  (I'm working on a small scale as we are only here temporarily
and I'm using one 6 gal glass carboy.) The first batch came out alright
and tested out at 5-7% alcohol and was consumed.


The second batch was fermented for 6-8 weeks and there was visible
fermentation going for almost that entire period of time which
ultimately slowed down to the point where I assumed that it was done and
I should bottle it.


My ultimate taster-my wife- told me that the new stuff had no alcohol in
it and upon my tasting it and then testing it for specific gravity I
found that there was no noteable alcohol level- as I recall < 2%.


I have since had to either drinking it as regular apple juice- not bad
but not cider- or try the freeze processing of my New England ancestors
which from what else I read on the page (not being a chemist or
microbiologist)is either not good for me or would give me a hell-of-a
hangover ( none felt to date).


We have since moved on and are now processing a 3rd batch again from
pasteurized juice . If this batch does not stop fermenting by mid March
when we must head back to PA I will need to stop the hoped for
fermentation and bottle it for transportation in gal. jugs. How does one
stop fermentation and hopefully salvage a drinkable product?


Thanks
Mike Tomlinson

are information/hobby type lists similar to this one and not commercial
orientated or encouraged.

Cider in Northamptonshire, UK...help please


Does anyone have any info on this? Any tradition? Local apple varieties? 
Real cider makers in the area? I can only find that two varieties in the 
national fruit collection have Northants origins ..Lord Burghley and Eady's 
magnum. Are these any good for cider?


Any info very welcome

We are in the midst of putting together a business plan for our gradually
evolving cider company and have reached the market trends section, which
remains blank.  We've dug out some fairly interesting data on cider from
the Beverage Marketing Report and are debating whether to blow the couple
hundred bucks it takes to retrieve the full analysis.  However, this data
deals exclusively with the sweet fizzy stuff that the report lumps in with
the wine cooler market.  They do indicate a signficant drop in sales of
this kind of cider and predict something of a move to a dryer, "more
sophisticated" cider.  That's encouraging.


Does anyone know of any other significant market research concerning our
kind of cider?

I can't see any reason for pasteurization itself to inhibit yeast -- there
must be another problem with that particular juice.


I normally use UHT (aka "long-life" or sterilized) fruit juices for my
dubious winemaking because they don't contain preservatives, which would
prevent fermentation.


Fruit juices and milk packed this way keep unopened at room temperature for
months because of the sterilization process. I'm not sure if these products
are available in the USA; they weren't when I lived there.
