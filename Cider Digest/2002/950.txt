I have been asked by the Slow Food organization to round up some artisanal
ciders from the Pacific Northwest for a big food event they are planning for
June 14-16 in Portland.


The last time I asked for help from this list, I received three good leads
(Westcott Bay Orchards in Washington, and Ford Farms and Traditional Co. in
Oregon), and I wonder if there are other good small cidermakers out there we
should be including.


I'm defining "Northwest" as Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, and maybe
Idaho and Alaska. I've recently seen a posting from Idaho, and will contact
the Steury Cider Co. But any other leads would be welcome. I already know
about Merridale Cider in B.C.


If anyone out there in the Northwest is making (or is drinking) a good
artisan cider that is commercially available (not a "draft"-style cider),
please contact me directly off-list.


I think the exposure and the promotion that Slow Food recently helped
Western cidermakers get in San Francisco was quite valuable, and this event
in Portland should be equally helpful. The festival is being run by the Slow
Food chapters in Washington and Oregon, and is a small version of the
organization's big fair, the Salone del Gusto, held every two years in
Turin, Italy. This one will focus on Northwest foods and producers.

Hello,
   I live in California and I want to plant some trees specifically for
cider.  I have room for 3-5 trees and would like to get some suggestions for
which trees make the best cider.  I keep hearing that blending the juice
works best... ok well which trees should I grow to blend the juice?  My
father and uncle farm several hundred acres and they already grow Fuji and
Granny smith apples.  In fact they also grow 3 kinds of apple pears too (do
people make hard cider from those?).  We have good winters here in the
valley so hours of cold shouldn't matter.  It also gets hot in the summer
some days over 100F.  Please let me know what trees I should look for.  I
might have to plant whatever I can find this year and make a special order
next year so I would like to know what you would ideally plant what you
could plant from popular varieties.
Thanks,
Alex
