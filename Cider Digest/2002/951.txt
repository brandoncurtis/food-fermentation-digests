Tree planting season is about to begin here in upstate NY, and I have the
ok for 2 or 3 Pear trees.  We're in zone 5.  I plan to blend, but, like I
said, can only have so many varieties.  Any ideas as to which trees might
be optimal.


Thanks

Last year a neighbor had a tree loaded with red 
crabapples.  I managed to get enough to press 
almost 3 U.S. gallons of must.  The color was
deep red from the start and remained so until I
added some priming sugar during bottling this 
weekend.  The color changed from red to orange. 
I also added a little bit of fresh yeast to encourage 
a sparkling effect.  The cider is very dry and still has 
quite a lot of acid.  If it's not drinkable, I can always
add to other ciders with low acid.


I was wondering if anyone had tried making a 
straight crab apple cider and how long it takes to
mellow.  I've seen ads for crab apple cider from the 
1870's and 1890's but can't find any information
about the process.  If anyone has any experience 
or knowledge about crab apple cider, I would love
to hear about it.

I suggest Harry Masters Jersey, an English (Somerset) bittersweet cider 
apple, if you can get it, because it is high in tannin, flavour, body and 
sugar, and low in acid. I think the dessert apples you name have, for the 
purpose of cidermaking, little tannin, flavour, body and sugar, but plenty 
of acid. Many other English bittersweet cider apples would do the job, but 
Harry Masters Jersey is the best I can think of. I don't know about the 
climate, but I think the variety itself will not be a problem as long as the 
rootstock is appropriate. A bush rootstock will deliver quicker, but a 
vigorous one will give better results in the long term.
