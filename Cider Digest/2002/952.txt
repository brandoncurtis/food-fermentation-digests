Hi there:
   I have been following the discussions lately about Perry Trees with great
interest however I am completely in the dark as to what they are like.
What is the Latin name for them that I would ask at a nursery?  
  Our farm which is located on the top of the South Mountain range in Nova
Scotia and is in zone 5 with weather conditions same as those in the Annapolis
Valley.  There, we grow Granvensteins, Johhne Gold, Mackintosh and Blemheims
(an old fashion type of Russet).  Would Perry Trees do well here? 
  Thanks for any help.

I don't make a straight crab-apple cider - at least not a fermented one -
but I do use Dolgo crab apples in my blends.  Straight Dolgo juice (I
hesitate to call it 'sweet' cider) carries quite a kick.  I find that it's
about 16 Brix and 14 g/L acid (as tartartic acid - that's how my method is
setup).


The other thing that I notice about Dolgo cider is that it doesn't brown.
It stays a nice light yellow.  I suspect that it has a lot of ascorbic acid
protecting it from oxidation, but that's not the only possibility.


You say that you're getting good color extraction from these crab apples,
although it sounds like it might not be stable.  Can you find out what
variety of crab they are?  They sound interesting.

We had a couple experiences with that from a tree where we used to live...
one that we made and one that a friend made during a bumper-crop year when
we weren't up to dealing with 50 lb of large-marble-sized fruit:-)


These were large for crabapples...say mid-way between a grape and a brussels
sprout.  Deep red, and the color came through to the juice.


I've planted a couple of Dolgo crabs here since we moved, and the fruit
from them seems very similar to that old tree we used to have.  It's very
tart, but compared to most crabapples it's delightful.  You can actually
pick a crabapple and eat it.


The way it ended up with the old tree, I made a small batch (1 gallon) from
those crabapples.  I bottled it in nips (6+ oz).  When I have a cider that is
boring/"flabby", I add one of these bottles to give it some tartness.


With our newer trees, the little Dolgos that we know are Dolgos, I used
those in the blend for one of last year's ciders, and they were a very good
conttribution.

The only thing I can think about making a pure crab cider is that I would
*really* want to be sure to get it through a malo-lactic fermentation!
