I'm not sure about putting crabapple wine through a malo-lactic
fermentation.  I've done some HPLC on blends with Dolgo and measured
significant amounts of ascorbic acid.  I don't recall what the citric acid
level was.  Those acids can make off notes if worked on by ML bacteria.


I don't know if anyone has studied the types of acids in crab apples -
especially broken down by variety.  I'm sure the labs like Vinquiry could
analyse it precisely.  The TLC kits available from PIWC and elsewhere whould
probably offer some guidance, too.


If I've wandered off into chem-geek acronym land:
HPLC - High performance liquid chromatography - can be used to sort out and
quantify sugars, alcohols and acids, depending on the detector used.
TLC - Thin layer chromatography - separates acids and pigments onto color
bands on a sheet of paper.  Can tell you if something is there, but not
really how much.

Perry trees would probably do fine there. They do OK in my orchard near
Quebec in zone 4. Their origin is a bit obscure, but some could be hybrids
between Pyrus nivalis and P. communis. Others could be of one or the other
of these species.


However, I am not aware of a canadian nursery that sells them. To get mine,
I had to get an import permit - I got scion wood of 6 varieties from the
National Clonal Germplast Repository, 33447 Peoria Road, Corvallis, Oregon
97333, USA. They also have a WWW site:
http://www.ars-grin.gov/ars/PacWest/Corvallis/ncgr/ncgr.html
 
The varieties I have are Blakeney Red, Gin, Hendre Huffcap, Thorn, Winnal's
Longdon and Yellow Huffcap. At the NCGR, there are about 15 varieties to
choose from, most of them English, but a few French/German/Romanian if I
remember well. If you have good contacts in England, there are many more
over there.

Subject: Priming Query
From: "Russell B. Farr" <rustle@iinet.net.au>

Hi,


I'm a new brewer (two beers) and am looking towards cider as well. 
I've spent today reading through the 1998, 99 and 2000 archives in 
search of an answer to what may or may not be an idea.


I've read about the pros and sons of priming bottles with sugar and 
honey.  I'm curious about the effectiveness of priming with other 
fruit juices, such as pineapple and strawberry.  Would these work, 
i.e. provide a suitable amount of sugar for carbonation and not 
upset the acidity. 


Anyone had any experience with this?  Anyone know how much 
juice to add, in order to avoid bottle bombs?  Thoughts on a 
pineapple and honey blend?


TIA!

What ever happened to Cider Space?  A couple of years ago I heard it was 
"shortly" going to move to a new URL, but never have found it again.


There used to be a page that discussed the various tribulations of going 
into commercial production.  Anyone know if that is still accessible 
somewhere?


Did anyone ever get a copy of the business plan from Black & Fagan?  I 
wrote to Black but got an odd reply saying that his wife told him not to 
waste any more time on it...
