I wish I could accommodate you. I don't own Warcollier's book; I have had to
get it through Interlibrary Loan from a university library (I think it was
UMass-Amherst) when I have needed it for research.


I also have had no luck finding it through Internet used-book searches. But
the ISBN probably does not exist, because at the time it was published in
England (1949) I doubt that ISBNs were assigned to books.


While we're on the subject, though, I have been looking for a copy of the
excellent book Perry Pears, published in England in the early 1960s by Long
Ashton, I believe. I highly recommend this book, from what I've seen so far.
Does Andrew Lea or anyone across the pond have a clue as to who might have
copies for sale. I believe someone gave me the name of a woman at Long
Ashton Research Station to contact. If I find that note, I'll post it.

I guess ISBN numbers didn't exist in 1949... Your chances are rather with
old book databases.
I tried abebooks (http://dogbert.abebooks.com/abe/BookSearch) just to see -
there is one copy of La Cidrerie by Warcollier (the 1928 edition in French)
and none of the 1949 English translation by Charley.
You can try others like Bibliofind (http://www.bibliofind.com/) or
Bookfinder (www.bookfinder.com).
For my part, I consider myself as very fortunate to have these 2 books at
the University library here in Quebec. And since I work at the University,
it is almost as if the books were on my bookshelf! But if there is a
university near you with some agriculture program, go and have a look -
they might have the book.

Regarding his own efforts at French-style ciders, Andrew Lea is, as usual, too
modest.  I have had the opportunity of personally sampling one of his success
stories: it was superb, and was the hands-down winner at a sampling I conducted
last year of some 25 commercial and amateur ciders.

To Terry Bradshaw:


Can you point us to the study(ies) which show the effect of fermentation on
bacterial populations? I have been asserting this point to various
parties without being able to prove it.

Subject: Crab Apple Acidity
From: Rcapshew@aol.com

Last year I made used 4 different crab apples in cider.
The small green Prairie Crab (Malus ioenensis) is about
1" in diameter.  These were crushed in blends and would
probably make very little juice if made separately.  They 
are probably high in acid and tannin.


I made cider from Hewes crab which was an old favorite
of Thomas Jefferson.  These apples are fairly large and 
sweet for a crab apple.  The acidity after racking recently
is 0.525.  The taste is great.


Another straight cider was made from an ornamental crab
from a nearby hotel.  The crab was red with orange flesh.
Unfortunately they did not know the name of the cultivar.
The acidity was 0.675 at racking.   The taste is very 
good already.


The last crab that I used was a red crab with red flesh from
a neighbor's tree.  As I mentioned in an earlier Cider Digest,
the cider turned orange after adding a little priming sugar at
bottling.  The cider has now returned to red.  The acidity has
an incredible 1.875.  If this doesn't mellow, I will use it in future
blends.

Subject: another cider press

I see that "Country Home Products" (the folks who make various mowers and
cutters and related implements in the US under the "DR" moniker) has a
"fruit and cider press".  It's a typical large basket press design, and it
looks not unreasonable.  The background on DR/Country Home Products is
reasonable, but there are various aspects of the advertising on this cider
press that raise my eyebrows up to my hairline.  (At my age, that's a long
way!)


Has anybody used one of these presses?  If so, could you please give us a
report on its effectiveness, strength, etc.?  I'd be particularly inter-
ested to hear of some comparison against the older standards of the small
basket press--the Jaffrey and Happy Valley Ranch presses.

Hi,
My name is Carrolyn and I am a very amateur cider maker!  I started my first
fermentation about a month and a half ago. The primary fermentation went
well.  I transferred  the ferment out of the primary fermenter about 3 weeks
ago and put an airlock on for the malo-lactic fermentation.  At first it
seemed to be excreting CO2 but then stopped.  I figured maybe it was too
cold, it was about 13 degrees in the basement.  So I carried the secondary
fermenter upstairs and now it has been in the downstairs hall at about 17-18
degrees, but has not bubbled CO2 out the air lock yet ( it has been about 2
weeks).   Is this normal?  Do you use two fermentation vessels for cider
(1+2)?
Thanks,
Carrolyn
