I suppose this is a longshot, but nothing ventured...


I've long been a fan of Quebec ciders, and would very much like to try
making cider from some good Quebec juice pressed from proper cider apples.
The ones I have access to here in Manitoba simply don't give the proper
taste that I'm looking for. Does anyone know of a source for Quebec cider
juice?


Thanks
Brian

Hmm... I for one welcome the emerging artesian
cider movement!  Now if I can just get a
well-driller to drill me my own artesian cider
well, I'd be all set!


;)

Dick,


What seems like a straight-forward question is actually not at all, and
you'll probably get a different answer from each person who answers. What
follows is my opinion, and mine alone...


You have to go back to the early 70s, when CAMRA was founded to protect
cask-conditioned ale. In those days it was simple - good beer contained live
yeast, poor beer did not. There was no need to look any further into the
production process, and sadly CAMRA has yet to move on from those simplistic
days. That's not to say that there are no people in CAMRA who want to look
at factors such as beer quality, but while policy is decided at an AGM
populated by the die-hard fanatic, nothing will change.


CAMRA's cider group, 'APPLE', is a minor sub-division of the overall beery
scheme of things. They have to follow the general policies of the Mother
group, and a break away is out of the question when you consider that
traditional cider and perry benefit from being sold at each of the numerous
country-wide CAMRA beer festivals throughout the UK. APPLE have made efforts
to differentiate between the 'industrial' Real Ciders and the 'natural' Real
Ciders, but this has proved ineffective without a similar classification for
ales (full malt or not, etc).


Does that answer your question?

Hi, I'm new to the Cider Digest.  I am developing a home apple orchard 
and got intrigued about all these strange-sounding cider apples which 
led me to learn more about making cider, etc.  It has quite fascinated 
me and I am planting a small cider apple orchard this spring.


The subject of this note is that I have been trying without much luck to 
track down "real" ciders available in the US.  I have made a list of 
everything which I know is available in the US.  Some of them I found 
from the digest archives, so if it was mentioned here before, its 
probably on my list.  It is at


  http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/US-ciders.htm


One of the goals of this list is something I can take to the excellent 
wine shop in town to try to get them to special order some stuff.  So,  
I have also recorded importers.  Additionally quite a bit is available 
by mail-order and I have recorded that as well, even though it is 
apparently illegal in many states?  Please let me know if I missed 
anything, I will update the list (its not in this email because I don't 
want to immortalize my mistakes).


I have thus far tracked down several very nice French ciders, but 
nothing from the US or England.  My favorite so far is the Etienne 
Dupont 2000, which to me tastes like a Belgian wheat beer with an apple 
tang and considerable blue cheese aftertaste.


Cheers,

I agree that Dave has done a good job.  I *really* wish I'd had his book
before our last trip to England.


BUT be sure you understand Dave's definitions.  #2 says "100% juice" but
in #1 there's no premise of any minimum juice content.  And yes, Dave did
verify that to me in email...#1 is basically CAMRA's definition of "real
cider".


I agree with Ben that to take a purist's point of view, it would be OK to
exclude ciders which are force-carbonated or pasteurized...BUT ONLY if the
standards ALSO require that the cider be made with apple juice!  Dave's #2
category is strict-but-OK; it's #1 (from CAMRA) that has the giant loophole.

There are a couple difficult-to-estimate considerations I see here:
  * If CAMRA weren't involved, would some other group arise?  It can be
    difficult to get that sort of an organization started, and they can
    easily be co-opted if they're not extremely careful about their ground
    rules.  So is CAMRA's APPLE occupying the niche of "cider advocate"
    and preventing the birth of an organization which would actually
    promote good cider?  Or is it doing a job that nobody else will take
    on, on the assumption that an ill-conceived or unbalanced advocacy is
    better than none at all?
  * What is the effect of labeling industrial ciders with only a small
    amount of juice content as "real ciders"?  That is, is this doing more
    harm than good to the cause of quality cider?  I think that you can
    argue that it hasn't done much harm, but only because CAMRA/APPLE
    apparently hasn't been especially effective and thus the label "real
    cider" doesn't carry any weight in the public mind.
