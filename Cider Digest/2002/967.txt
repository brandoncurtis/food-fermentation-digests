Subject: ATF cider definitions

Concerning ATF regs:


>  Also, that a
>cider must be less than 5% alcohol.


And:


>Wine, by definition, starts at 7% alcohol.  Hard cider maxs out at 5%


Where are these limits found?  I have been corresponding with ATF, and they 
have not indicated anything like a 5% abv limit for cider.  (Of course, 
they have also very helpfully forwarded me a lot of material which turned 
out to be out of date, so maybe I'm just not getting the right info.)


There is a special tax rate for hard cider, which is defined as a still 
wine of less than 7% ABV, made primarily from apple juice or concentrate 
with no other natural or artificial flavors.  Those restrictions are 
applied solely for the purpose of the special (lower) tax rate - you can 
make any kind of cider you want, but if it doesn't meet those criteria then 
it does not receive the special tax treatment.


This is a big issue for cidermakers in the US, by the way, as the tax rate 
for a sparkling wine is MUCH higher, and the permit requirements are more 
onerous.  If your cider is naturally carbonated, you are supposed to pay 
something like $3 per gallon in Federal excise tax, versus a rate of $0.226 
per gallon for still cider.  Ridiculous.


Of course, I still have yet to figure out what the definition of 
"sparkling" and "carbonated" actually means: it is given as more than 0.392 
grams of CO2 per hundred milliliters.  That's 3.9 grams per liter.  But I 
have no idea what that corresponds to in physical terms - is that the 
saturation point at a certain temperature and pressure?

 From pure Baldwin juice, or a blend?


I'm curious because Baldwin apparently is a low-chill variety that might do 
well here.  If it is good enough to make a varietal cider, then maybe I 
should plant more of it.

Andrew Lea is much more qualified to give you the whys and wherefores from a
chemical perspective, but here's my pennysworth of knowledge:


1. Sulfite added to juice before fermentation suppresses the activity of
wild yeasts like Candida and Kloeckera, etc.


2. Unless you've oversulfited your juice, 24 hours should be a decent
interval to wait before pitching a Saccharomyces yeast strain. These yeast
strains have been selected for sulfur tolerance; in fact I find that red
wine strains like Pasteur Red and Montrachet are particularly tolerant
(though they aren't usually used for cidermaking).


3. Sulfite also suppresses bacterial activity, as you suggest. Acetobacter
should not be a problem if you uncover the top of primary fermenting vessel
only while the cider is in its most vigorous initial fermentation phase --
at that time, the fermenting must needs oxygen, and the copious amount of
CO2 produced should guard against acetobacter infection. After things settle
down, of course, you need to top up the vessel and put everything under an
airlock filled with a sulfite solution.


4. I don't always use sulfites. In fact, I usually make at least one
"control" batch, and my 2001 wild cider is the best yet. But I also have a
very high-acid must (around 0.9 acid), which protects against bacterial
infection or other problems. I have also made some pretty funky wild cider.
And, when I do use sulfites, I generally use sparingly (50-60 ppm. per
gallon) adding them only before fermentation, and at no other time (racking,
bottling). This is because, in my understanding, the initial sulfiting does
its job (suppressing the wild yeasts and giving a "competitive advantage" to
the commercial yeast) early on, and then it "metabolizes" (my unscientific
term) or chemically binds in the fermenting cider -- which means that, if
you tested the finished cider, I suspect you would find little or no free
residual SO2. Andrew may well correct me on this point.


5. As to malolactic fermentation, some commercial cidermakers try to avoid
this at any cost -- though it can sometimes sound like the Holy Grail for
home cidermakers. I'm pretty casual about MLF; sometimes it happens,
sometimes it doesn't. I tend to encourage it whenever possible by leaving
cider on its secondary lees, because my juice is so acidic. But I have not
found that sulfites added before primary fermentation affect MLF, which
occurs later if at all, in bulk storage or in the bottle, after the added
SO2 has become bound to other compounds in the cider.


6. Unlike wine, in which you want to protect the must during racking and
definitely halt fermentation before bottling by stabilizing with sulfites,
minor bottle fermentation is not a problem with cider. In fact, many of us
like to add a dosage of sugar at bottling to make a fully fermented cider
effervescent. (Another reason not to exclude the use of sugar in "real
cider"?)


7. Finally, as has been said ad nauseum elsewhere, the use of sulfur in
winemaking -- of which cidermaking is an offshoot, in my mind -- has been
common since at least Roman times. Though they also used lead plumbing,
which I wouldn't recommend. . . . My decision has been to use sulfites
sparingly and only prefermentation, unless I suspect some problems in my
cider. Even my use of sulfites in wine has gone down since my first year of
production.

A lot of confusion regarding the action of sulfite in ciders and wines
arises because its chemistry is really complex. It _does_ stun/kill wild
yeast, it _does_ stun/kill acetic and lactic acid bacteria and mould,
and it _does_ generally leave beneficial Saccharomyces unaffected.  But
there are exceptions to all these statements if it ain't properly
handled.


 For instance,


A. The action of sulphite is highly pH dependent. This is because it is
not sulphite which does the job, it is the so-called molecular S02 which
is in pH-dependent equilibrium with sulphite.   There are relevant
graphs in a paper on my website (Ref 2) but,in summary, at pH 3 it is 6%
in the required form while at pH 4 it is <1% in the required form. Hence
100 ppm sulphite at pH 3.8 gives a molecular SO2 of about 1 ppm which is
just about enough to stun most non-Saccharomyces yeast and bacteria. At
higher pH you really can't get enough of it into the required form so,
pragmatically, pH 3.8 is taken as the upper limit of its effectiveness
in a juice, cider or wine.  At a lower pH it is exponentially more
effective and indeed will even inhibit the 'trained' Saccharomyces
yeasts.  So if you add 150 ppm SO2 at pH 3.2 you have 4% i.e. 6 ppm
molecular SO2 which is enough to inhibit even a good strong fermenting
yeast for several weeks, maybe for ever! But at a higher pH the lag
phase for a newly pitched fermenting yeast will only be a few days. 
Hence the effective SO2 dose must _always_ rely on a knowledge of the
 pH (Refs 2,3). Otherwise you are shooting entirely in the dark!


B. Sulphite is rendered ineffective by 'binding' to carbonyl
components in fermenting beverages, which lock it all up so that no
molecular SO2 can be formed (Refs 1,2). The principal binder is
acetaldehyde.  In a fresh juice before fermentation begins there is no
acetaldehyde so this is not a problem. But if you add sulphite to an
active fermentation, the yeast will already be making plenty of
acetaldehyde (hundreds of ppm) and this will simply bind up the sulphite
immediately and it will have no inhibitory effect on the active yeast. 
The same would be true  were there plenty of acetobacter present
e.g  a vinegar plant in full cry.  Strong binding compounds (di-keto
sugars) are also produced in _juices_ made from poor quality fruit
 which has any mould or bacterial infection and these can negate 
the effect of sulphite totally,which is therefore a good reason 
for using  washed and graded fruit at all times!


C. Sulphite is also oxidised chemically to sulphate by the air and
therefore rendered ineffective by this means too. But this effect is
slower and and may take several days to occur in an unstoppered
container.


>

> sugar? 


No, for the reason given in (B) above.  But you can add it (typically 50
- - 100 ppm) to a fermentation which has finished, where the acetaldehyde
level is back to normal, and so the SO2 has a chance to do its job. 
Here it will very effectively prevent storage infection by film yeasts
and bacteria.  It also acts (in a purely chemical sense as a reducing
agent) to prevent oxidation and darkening of the cider. But it goes 
without saying that all stored ciders should be well closed to prevent
 extra air getting in. SO2 is not magic and it can be oxidised away by
 mechanism (C) if care is not taken to restrict access of air.




So, the rules are, if using sulphite:


ONE.  Add it _before_ fermentation, at a rate appropriate to the pH.
Then wait 12 hours before pitching to allow the wild yeasts and bacteria
to be killed (if you want a 'pure culture' cider), or be prepared 
to wait a couple of weeks if waiting for wild Saccharomyces to multiply. 
 [Or add sulphite at a lesser rate if you want some non-Saccharomyces 
to establish, but that is a story for another time!]


TWO.  Add it after fermentation is finished, to stabilise cider in
closed containers for storage.  This will inhibit film yeast and
bacterial growth and will prevent oxidation, hence preserving
'freshness'.


THREE.  Do not ever add it to an active fermentation, or to juice 
from poor quality (rotting) fruit..  It will simply get mopped up
 and will do no good at all!




Sorry to be so long-winded but I hope this helps!
