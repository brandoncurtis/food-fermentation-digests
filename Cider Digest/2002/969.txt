We have found Baldwin to make a nice, balanced single variety  cider.
It has acidity and a bit more tannin than most dessert varieties.  In
our area, it was the apple of choice for traditional cidermakers.  We
get our Baldwins from trees that are 75-125 years old, and I think that
helps.  This year we will start harvesting some trees we recently
planted  and I am looking forward to comparing.


The tree has a very strong tendency to biennial bearing, though some
growers have them producing annually.  It seems resistant to the
multitude of perils apples face here.  The "wild" - uncultivated
Baldwins frequently bear decent fruit, occasionally enough for a batch
of cider with a very concentrated flavor.


Not everyone seems to like Baldwin for a cider.  For example Proulx &
Nichols described Baldwin Cider as "flat and insipid".  At worst, it can
be an excellent blending apple.  We made two batches of  Redfield from
the last harvest, one blended with straight Baldwin, the other from
assorted dessert apples.  The Baldwin had more depth.


I have no idea how they would do in CA, but it would be worth testing.
It makes good pies and eating, and stores well if the cider doesn't work
out.

FWIW, just one data point from one person (one couple, actually), we had a
Baldwin cider and found it to be bland and uninteresting.  The particular
cider was exceptionally well made and there was nothing explicitly wrong
or bad-tasting about it.  You wouldn't turn up your nose or toss it away,
but you wouldn't ask for a second glass.

I've dug into the literature a little.  I'm sure there are nice little
graphs around, but I couldn't find them.
But given the solubility of CO2 at 20C and 1 bar, and some notes that CO2
follows Henry's law up to about 100 MPa (big pressure!), I have figured
thusly:


At room temp, in an open container, about 1.7 grams of CO2 will go into
solution under a CO2 blanket.
At 3.9 grams CO2, the balancing pressure to keep the gas in solution would
have to be about 2.25 bar absolute, or 19 psi-gauge.


Champagne runs 5-6 bar gauge, or 75-90 psig. That would mean 10-12 g/L CO2.
This is also the figure the you get for about 20g/L of sucrose added to a
dry wine at bottling. (Give or take a 'real world' fudge factor).


So if you flipped the 3.9g CO2/L limit for still wine tax rates over on its
head, you would get a sugar addition at bottling of around 7g/L, or the
equivalent of that in residual sugar, or freedom to use a CO2 pressure
bottle filler up to about 20psig without worry.


The pressure should change by about .4 psi per 'C. 


Does that make any sense?

Subject: Alcohol change from priming?

I wonder if some of the more scientific-minded 
people on this list can give me a definite answer
to this question, since the replies I have had so 
far have varied significantly.


What I'm trying to find out is how much alcohol 
is produced by bottle carbonation.  If I add a
teaspoon of Dextrose to a 750ml bottle of cider 
(or half a teaspoon to a 375ml bottle), how much
will the alcohol rise?


I've thought of measuring the SG after priming, 
and adding the potential alcohol from that to
the potential from the original SG, but I'm not 
sure if it that simple.


Here's the deal - a batch of cider starts out at 
1.050 SG, and ferments down to 1.000, so its
alcohol level should now be 6.4%, right?  But 
bottle carbonation after priming will take that up
a bit more.  I tried the rec.crafts.brewing 
newsgroup, but got two replies, one saying 0.1%
increase, and one saying 0.5% increase.  I'd like 
to get an answer I can trust, so that I can
tell people how much alcohol is in the home brew 
I give them.

Been there, done that, got the crossed eyes...  Finding the nitty-gritty 
specific to cider is quite difficult.  But I believe you are correct as to 
the ABV limits.   I have heard back from people at both FDA and ATF, who 
tell me that cider under 7% ABV is under the jurisdiction of FDA, not 
ATF.  There still seems to be some confusion about whether still cider can 
be produced outside a winery and escape licensing and taxation...

No kidding!  I'm familiar with this kind of research - in the environmental 
regulation field - but still found it quite frustrating.  Most of the 
information I could find that was specific to cider was related to 
labeling, or tax rates; nothing about licensing.


As noted above, I have been told by ATF and FDA representatives that cider 
under 7% abv is under FDA jurisdiction; yet there is a Federal tax category 
for hard cider (with anything more than 0.5 % abv).   This category was 
created in 1997, when it replaced the former exemption for "farm" 
cider.  The presence of this category would seem to imply some ATF 
authority, would it not?


 From what I can make out, I could produce a still cider on my farm without 
first getting an ATF license; all I would have to do is get the label 
approved by FDA.  Anything other than a still cider, made primarily from 
apple juice or concentrate, and you have to get a winery license and pay 
higher tax rates.


I still don't know how much carbonation 3.9 g/L really amounts to.  The 
kind of cider I want to make is lightly carbonated - "bouche," as the 
Normans call it, "kissed" with a sparkle of tiny bubbles, but not really 
effervescent like champagne, beer, or soda.  Guess I'll have to make some 
and have it analysed.


Cheers,
Tim

Subject: ARGH!  Ace'd again!

Some of you may recall a posting of mine last June about gushing bottles of
Ace brand cider.  In the discussion that followed, "we" sort of came to the
conclusion that of the two possibilities--a fermentation that re-started in
the bottle, or contamination--contamination was the more likely.  This was
because the bottles were not _just_ over-carbonated, but that they tended
to "gush" (empty about half the liquid from the bottle when opened).


Well, I hadn't forgotten the incident but I had apparently forgotten the
connection to the brand, so when I was hunting around in the store for a
possibly-less-offensive-than-most commercial cider, I guess I had a "senior
moment" and bought another pack of Ace cider.  (This is their regular
cider, not one of the "flavored" types.)


Same result as last summer!  Gushed like a small geyser!  Fortunately, I
opened the first bottle in the garage where the bottle opener is wall-
mounted above a large sink, so clean-up was minimal.  But the bottle was
less than half full after it stopped gushing.  I had done all the right
stuff: the cider was cold and had been sitting quietly for a day or so.
I opened the remaining bottles and studied the results.  Two bottles were
actually plausibly OK--fizzy but within reason, and the cider was clear
(not brilliant but no haze).  The other four bottles were all geysers,
hazy, and with a sediment that broke up and rose on the bubbles after the
bottles were opened.


And what's going on here?!?  It couldn't be the same bad batch as 11 months
ago.  It raises a lot of questions in my mind...such as:  Is it a generic
problem with Ace cider?  How do they keep selling this stuff?  And what
does this tell us about the "average consumer" understanding or appreciation
of cider?


Anybody else try Ace recently?  If so, was your experience similar or
contrary to mine?
