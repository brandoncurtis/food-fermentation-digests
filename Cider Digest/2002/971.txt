G'day All,
Just seeking opinions on oak use in cider production.


Does all cider benefit from oak contact?


Must cider be aged in oak barrels or even fermented in oak barrels for that
matter?


Has anyone successfully used oak battens or "beans" in fermenters
(stainless, glass, HDPP) or maturation tanks that is equals to barrel
contact?


Thanks for your help. I am trying to see if oaking is as important in cider
as it is in wine etc.

I just heard that Vigo Ltd, the premier UK (and export) supplier of
equipment to small-scale cidermakers, is moving to bigger premises from
27th May.  Their business is doing so well they need more space!

Exactly what is the weight of glucose (dextrose) in your teaspoon?
You have to know that accurately before you can begin.


Anyway, let's assume for the sake of argument that it's 5 grams.


Then 5 g of glucose (or sucrose) will give a typical yield of alcohol of
around 47% i.e. 2.35 g. In 750 ml of cider this equates to 0.31 % by
weight (w/w). But alcohol is always conventionally measured by volume so
that becomes 0.4 v/v.

It is that simple, but the numbers are very small and you would be
unlikely to measure them that accurately.  For instance, adding your 5g
per 750 ml is equivalent to adding 6.67 grams per litre.  From the
published sugar tables (e.g. in the Proulx and Nichols book) this works
out at a difference of just 0.003 in SG. (and 0.4% v/v in potential
alcohol).


Incidentally, in the context of the other current thread on this digest,
you will also get about 3 g/l of CO2 from this added sugar. Which is
about 15 psi of gas pressure, or one atmosphere over saturation.  But
that of course is why you're doing it in the first place!!

Regarding my second encounter with gushing bottles of Ace Cider...
first, Bill Rhyne wrote:

I'm actually in Hygiene, Colo, but yes, almost the same altitude as
Boulder.  The difference in atmospheric pressure from sea level to us is
about 20%.  That's not nearly enough to make the difference, and consider
also that we have all sorts of carbonated beverages--Champagne, most micro-
brews, etc.--coming here from near sea level, with no problem.


The overcarbonation of the Ace Cider was at least a factor of 2 more gas
than should have been there, and was accompanied by whatever other factors
cause gushing as contrasted with just high carbonation (microbial contami-
nation generally, it seems).

I tried careful chilling and very gentle handling.  No noticeable diff.
Tahoe is about 6500 ft elevation, same ballpark difference.  But Bill,
there is a BIG difference between "a little more sparkling" and "empties
half the bottle when you lift the cap"!


Next, Jeffrey House <jeffrey@acecider.com> responds on behalf of Ace Cider.
Although I have some questions about Mr. House's response, I have to say
that it's nice to get an answer directly from the source!

Yes, one of the reasons that I had decided to try Ace again, after for-
getting last summer's mishap, was that I was going by ingredients on the
label, and Ace doesn't seem to be using the "half fermented sugar-water"
approach that most other national brands use.

That might explain the problem I encountered last June.  But I think it
does not quite explain the problem this month.  I would like to think that
the product turns a complete cycle in substantially less than a year.

OK, to start, I can understand the problem with wholesalers (and retailers)
not following through.  It's a vexing problem because the producer just
can't get out there and fix it.  But there are several opposing problems.


First, I purchased this at the second or third largest (I'm not sure)
liquor store in the state.  I should think they wouldn't still be selling
a batch that was known in June 2001 to be contaminated, on into May 2002,
eleven months later.


Second, even though I can sympathize with the problem of getting the dis-
tribution chain to pull bad product, I believe they need at least a little
bit of help in doing so.  I have a passing familiarity with methods of
date-coding (stamps, label notches, and the like), and I can't see ANY date
codes on Ace cider.  How can a retailer pull bad product if he can't tell
the good from the bad?  Maybe there's something on the cases, but even
then, how do you tell once it's on the shelves, and how will I as a
customer know when the product in the store is from the contaminated
batch?


Next, I'm having trouble reconciling "stringent microbiological analysis"
with that sort of contamination.  How did it slip by?


Finally, the nature of the refermentation does not fit with malo-lactic
fermentation, at least not as I understand it.  Malo-lactic should _reduce_
the acidity/harshness, not increase it.  It should not produce gushing.
And it should not produce a lot of CO2.


I think there's more going on here than we understand so far.
