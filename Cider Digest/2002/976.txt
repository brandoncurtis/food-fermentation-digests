Thank Andrew on the Aussie yeast info. Please keep more of that sort of info
coming. What a great resource you are to the cider community!!


Further on yeast strains, I was curious to see if anyone has experimented
with Sach. Delbruekii strains that are typically used with wheat beer, as it
has unique qualities that may prove interesting for cider.


Back n to natural yeast now, Andrew, would you consider it worthwhile to
isolate and culture up useable quantities of Hanseniospora valbyensis yeast?


Thanks,

Andrew,


You mentioned here and on your website that you use low level sulphiting to
encourtage natural Hanseniospora valbyensis yeasts etc to grow happily. At
what levels of free SO2 would you recommend for this?


Thanks,
