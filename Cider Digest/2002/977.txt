Mark Ellis queried websites regarding apple growing.
The following should be of interest for Digest members in general and
for Australian conditions in particular.
http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/2879    Pome index 
http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/10691     Apple growing 
http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/7281    Apple rootstocks
All are authoured by Dr Jill Campbell who has just retired from NSW
Agriculture. She had her initial apple training in Britain and then came
to Australia to assist us poor colonials.
Check the 'Pome index' in weeks to come as there should shortly be a
webpage on cider.
Bear in mind that choice of cider cultivars when planting out an orchard
may require some compromises. It is better to add in a few less
desirable (for cider) trees as pollinators and ensure good pollination
than to squeeze in only the good cultivars and mess up the pollination.
It should be possible to use some of the crab apples that have had
attention recently, not only for the tannin in the fruit but also for
pollination purposes.


Modesty forbids mentioning who assisted in the creation of the cider page.
Thank you also Andrew Lea for assistance in trying to track down
cultivar photos in a hurry!

Hi All,


I have seen references to cider apple, and perry pear
varieties list not only acidity but aloso tannin levels. How
on earth is tannin measured and is it possible for the
layman to accomplish?


Many Thanks
