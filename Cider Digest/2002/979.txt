Since my cider orchard is now a bunch of non-producing runts, I am going 
to pick some apples locally at the U-pick places this fall to make 
cider, and am marking my calendar now for the ripening dates so I don't 
miss 'em.   Unfortunately, they don't have Roxbury Russet, Golden 
Russet, etc.  They do have the following which I have heard associated 
with hard cider making: Jonagold, Stayman, Mutsu/Crispin, Ida Red, 
Empire, Rome, Cortland, Jonathan, Summer Rambo.  Are any of these 
particularly good, or bad?  The first three seem to have the best 
reputation from what I've heard.  They also have a bunch of the "new" 
apples which I've not seen classified as good (or bad) for cider: 
Suncrisp, Pink Lady, Cameo, Honeycrisp, Holiday, Fortune.  Are any of 
these good cider apples?
