Subject: Sulphurous originators?

G'day All,


Just about finished fermenting some cider which was an
experiment with dessert  apples just to see how things would
turn out.


Lot 1 was 80% Granny Smith and 20% Lady Williams
Lot 2 was 90% Lady Williams and 10% Granny Smith


Most people would be familiar with G.S but probably only
Aussies would know L.W. which is quite an very late acid
apple and keeps for months, basically picking it after the
leaves fall and sweetens after extended storage.


Anyhoo, before racking, Lot 1 had a heavy sulphorous head
space in the fermenter, whilst Lot 2 was sweetly aromatic.
Both Lot's were fermented with Saccharomyces bayanus (Lalvin
EC-1118).


Which leads me to the question. Are there juice
characteristics endemic to certain apple varieties which
effect yeast so as to produce these sulphur compounds? I
thought that this action came from certain yeasts only??


Will be interesting to see any discussion on this.


Regards
