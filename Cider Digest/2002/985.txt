One trick I have used successfully to slow down a particularly fast
initial ferment is simple evaporative cooling. Put a large (preferably
scrap) T-shirt over the carboy; place in a tray of water. You can, if
needed, enhance the cooling with a fan.

Thanks for the helpful response, Drew (and, others who replied by email).

I haven't been able to any precise records of soil temperature in 
different parts of the US, but I did find several references to 55F so 
that is probably a good guess of what I can achieve.  Warcollier 
mentions the need for refrigeration to achieve the best fermentation 
temperatures.

That sounds like a good possibility.  I also saw plans to in effect use 
a fridge as an A/C unit: cut an opening in the closet in which your 
fridge with the main door opened (or removed) could be tightly fitted 
against.


Someone emailed me about plans for a basement root cellar design they 
saw which sounded familiar to what I was doing.  Indeed a root cellar 
has a similar purpose.  In searching the web, I found a design which had 
a cold intake pipe coming in from outside to bring in cold air to the 
floor, and a high pipe by the ceiling which bled off hot air (see 
http://www.organicgardening.com/library/rootcellar.html ).  If I can get 
myself to punch a hole in my house, this could provide some natural 
A/C;  if it gets too cold the pipe can be closed.  Also my vague 
knowledge of heat-rises-cool-falls is that if it were hot outside the 
cellar would not warm up much because the hot outside air would not 
descend the cool pipe.


Cheers,
Scott

Subject: Tannin addition for that "faux European cider apple" effect
From: Scott Smith <scott@cs.jhu.edu>

I've been making my recipe for cider this fall and am going to be using 
apples without significant tannin and so am planning to add grape tannin 
powder for the "faux cider apple" effect.  In reading the digest 
archives, 1 1/2 tsp per 5 US gallons seems to be the most commonly 
recommended figure, with a minimum of 1/8 tsp/5gal and a max of 5 
tsp/5gal (the latter recommended by Paul Correnty back in '93).  I 
believe part of the reason for the wide discrepency is that tannins 
precipitate out during aging, and the people who don't believe in adding 
so much may not be aging their ciders very long.  Of course taste 
preferences also differ.


Now, doing some calculations, assuming you want to add .15% by weight of 
tannin (to bring it up to a level more like the .2% found in European 
cider apple must, assuming .05% tannin in the dessert apples), you get 5 
gals = 18.9 l = 18900 cc * 1.070 g/cc  = 20000 g * .15% = 30g =~ 10 tsp 
(right?), which is a lot!   According to Andrew via the digest archive, 
half of measured apple tannin is polyphenols which are not tannic; so, 
assuming powdered grape tannin is all tannic polyphenols (I have no 
basis for this assumption), that gives 5tsp/5 gal as a target addition 
amount to give a reasonable "faux cider apple" effect.  This is more 
than most additions suggested and I'm not sure why.  My guess is the 
methods and taste target of the standard US cider recipe are somewhat 
different than that of a traditional European cider recipe.   Apple and 
grape tannins could also differ in other ways (e.g. bitterness based on 
the mix of tannin types) so less grape tannin is tolerated.  Anyway I'm 
just guessing; any ideas?


In white wine recipes, I have found figures of 1/2tsp to 1 1/2tsp tannin 
added per 5 gals quoted; white wines are low in tannin. Mead recipes 
seem to range from 1 tsp to 2 1/2 tsp per 5 gals added.  Jackish, 
"Modern Winemaking"  mentions that a young red wine has the tannic taste 
equivalent of 1/4tsp tannin powder added to 8oz water, which is 20 
tsp/5gal.  This is a lot, but a lot of tannin precipitates out of red 
wine during aging.


I would appreciate it if anyone had a story of adding an amount of grape 
tannin that they felt was "too much", even after 6 months or more of 
aging, or of getting a nice result from a large-ish addition.

"Also, I am interested in planting more suitable trees for future years.  I 
noticed on Mr. Lea's (excellent) website that there is a nursury in 
Winchester, Illinois that lists several good cider varieties.  Anyone who has 
purchased from this nursury is invited to give me their impression of the 
product and service, online or off."


I have been very pleased with Cider Hill Nursery based in 
Winchester, Illinois and run by Lee Elliott.  He has first 
class trees and service.

Re Richard and Susan Anderson's query on the confusion over Brown Snout
/ Browns Apple.
Brown Snout is small and has a distinctive russetting at the flower end
- - hence the name. Once seen always remembered.


You can check the two at the NSW Agriculture website
Brown Snout at http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/11585
and Browns Apple at http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/11584

A correction, regarding my comments on Brown Snouts should have read "not" a
good candidate for a single varietal cider. I tend to post late, and as
Susan points out my editing reflects this.
