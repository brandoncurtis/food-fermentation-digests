Subject: Tim's MLF

Oh dear I'm sorry to hear Tim's experience was less happy than mine. But
I think it is true that if the cider is in any way faulty (other than
naturally high malic acid)  at the beginning, then MLF will not help
it.  


The other thing is that I wonder how good Tim's culture was.  Fifteen or
twenty years ago the only MLF cultures available were universally
regarded as disastrous.  Perhaps some of these are still on sale?  I
would personally only go for a top quality culture from someone like
Lallemand or Chr Hansen, i.e. companies who are immersed in the subject
and have themselves contributed to the rapid strides in MLF technology
which have been made in the last decade.


On the basis of my (admittedly just one!) experiment this season I am
now totally committed to the idea of an MLF culture.  But before that,
and on the basis of what I'd picked up from all manner of people in the
wine and cider industries in past years, I would have been very
negative.  So, try again next year Tim, and I hope you have better luck!

There is another vital point too which is not so obvious. And that is,
you must have a low nitrogen juice to keep the fermentation speed down. 
This is achieved by (a) choice of 'vintage' cultivars which take up less
nitrogen than other trees and (b) maintaining low nitrogen inputs.  The
presence of grazing cattle or sheep will also help by reducing the total
nitrogen level in the orchard.  And of course you must not add any 
vitamins or yeast nutrient to the juice.  I have a piece called
'Nitrogen the Forgotten Element in Cidermaking' on my website.

I would tend to agree with this too. I think you need enough pectin to
form an adequate 'clot' after the action of the enzyme (whether added or
not), to give the 'chapeau'.  There seems to be a sort of 'critical
mass' here.  That I think is one reason why traditionally the apples
were allowed to stand for a day or so between milling and pressing -
this allows more pectin to diffuse out of the cell walls into the juice
to do the job.  The subject is very complex.  It was studied by my old
boss Fred Beech at Long Ashton in the 1950's for his PhD - sadly and
inexplicably it was never properly written up in the scientific
literature for wider dissemination.  I guess by that time keeving was in
its final throes in the UK anyway (apart from the mad craft hobbyists
like us who have 'invented' it again!).

This is quite true - fortunately I and many people here in NorthWest
Europe do not find the natural occurence of benign fermenting yeasts to
be a problem. Perhaps there is something about the growth of cider
apples in a Mediterranean (Californian) climate which is less
favourable?  The process is reliable enough in Northern France that a
large proportion of the mainstream French factory cider industry uses
'keeving' and refrigerated fermentation with natural yeast to produce
their commercial ciders.  They have developed some interesting and
up-to-the minute technologies to allow them to do this but the
fundamental processes have not changed.

Earlier this year I asked for advise regarding visiting 
SW England and cider country with my wife and granddaughter.
We did end up in Somerset County staying at Wells and
were able to visit Heck's at Street (thats a town).  
They have a number of single variety ciders they ferment
in old wooden barrels, and young Mr. Chris Heck was kind
enough to describe his cider processing and natural
fermentation.


At the Tourist Information office, I picked up a
pamphlet titled "Somerset Cider and Apple Juice" that 
listed 28 cider makers with directions and several
paragraphs about each.  The publication also listed
historical information and technical information about
apple and cider production.


Because of the wealth of SW England sight seeing, I didn't
attempt to take my wife and 11 yr old granddaughter to other
farms, but I did drink the local ciders where ever possible.


The farmhouse varieties were a bit funky for my taste and
I preferred to blend mainstream ciders with the funkier
farmhouse varieties.  I didn't think the single variety
ciders improved the product but I brougt home a bottle
of Kingston Black to open at a Wassial Party I plan
mid January for my drinking buddies.


Thanks to those that responded earlier with suggestions.

G'day Crowd,


OK its time to get serious with pH . I have to source a
reliable and good value (read cheap as possible!) for money
meter. Anyone have opinions over best worse etc.


Thanks all.

Thanks for the great post on your visit to Normandy, Derek.  You made no 
mention of the use of Calcium Chloride or KLERCIDRE or any other 
keeve-assisting agent; is this true?  I had thought that this was always 
used.


The main thing I wanted to bring up was the "Frequin Rouge" variety of 
apple.  According to Bore and Fleckinger (the standard reference on 
French cider apples, unfortunately out of print now), there are in fact 
many apples known as Frequin Rouge.  The Geneva repository for instance 
seems to have two of them, "Frequin Rouge" and "Frequin" which has 
alternate name "Frequin Rouge Amer".  Bore and Fleckinger list only 
"Frequin Rouge Petit".   And, even though Frequin Rouge is on the 
AOC-recommended list, they don't mention that in their listing of 
Frequin Rouge Petit, making me think they could find no clear Frequin 
Rouge (for all the other recommended varieties they mention them as such 
in the listing).  Any insights into this?  Note there are many other 
"Frequin" apples which are quite distinct and listed separately in Bore 
and Fleckinger, e.g. Frequin Audievre.
