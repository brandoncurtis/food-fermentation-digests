RE: Blending; Gravenstein juice suggestion for home cider makers


I agree with Andrew Lea's comments about blending the apples before juicing
instead of after fermenting. We will ferment single varieties to learn about
their characteristics but we have no problem with blending at time of
crushing and juicing as long as the apples have met our criteria for flavor,
ripeness, acidity, pH, etc. Juicers and apple farmers will often suggest to
us their favorite blends that they like for juice purposes, for
example--50/50 Johnathan and Golden Delicious, etc. That is why we tell
people we have a "rolling recipe" because it varies from harvest to harvest.
That is the fun!


Right now is Gravenstein season in Sebastopol and I was talking to a juicer
that supplies us on occasion. They said that they are packing gallon jars of
Gravenstein for Trade Joe's store label. I haven't analyzed the batch but
our experience has been good with this juicer's stuff. For home cider makers
in search of apple juice to ferment but who live out side of the apple
country and near a Trader Joe's, you may want to buy 5 gallons or so and try
a batch. Usually the acidity is good. This juice is usually crushed,
pressed, "heat treated" (heated to 140 degrees F) or maybe pasteurized so
most of the flavor and stuff is all in still in the bottle. They usually
don't filter it so it is the cloudy brown color.


Take care!

Nehou is a funny old fruit all right. Not really a 'typical '
bittersweet at all, for all that it's really high in tannin. It crops
very early and is very soft and oxidises like the clappers - just as
Bill says.  When I was at LARS in the 70's we used it as a test apple to
judge the effect of mechanical harvesting on fruit damage and phenolic
levels. It did not stack up well but it was useful as a 'worst case'
scenario to compare the possible adverse effects of mechanical
harvesting on cider fruit.

For research purposes and for purposes of documenting, videotaping and
photographing existing  hard  cider orchards and producer operations and
processes I would appreciate any possible information of those who are
currently involved with hard cider in the southeast. I am also
interested in training that is currently available. For example, the
local community colleges have begun offering certification programs in
the growing and management of grapes and the making of wine and there
are several universities that offer wine production courses of
study..might there be anything out there for the production of hard
ciders. For that matter, is there even an association of those who are
currently growing hard cider apples and producing hard ciders? Clarence
