Hello all:


        I have been "lurking" since June and finally have some questions which I
cannot find and answers to in the archives which I have just finished
reading.  First, though, I would like to congratulate and thank Mr. Dunn for
doing such a fine job - this is an excellent resource for all those seeking
to create quality craft ciders.  Secondly I would like to thank all the very
knowledgeable contributors for sharing their experiences.


        Now to my questions:


    1.  Can anyone give me information on an apple called "Crow Egg"?  I have
found a small orchard near my home in east central Illinois that several old
variety apples I want to use in this seasons cider and one of them is "Crow
Egg".
    2.  Are there any cider makers in Illinois who know where I might find a
place to do custom grinding and pressing?  I am working on making a press of
my own, but I am not sure my budget will allow me to obtain all the
necessary materials this year.
    3.  A major reason this years budget is so small is my upcoming trip to
England which happens this March.  I will be centered in Eastbourne and
would like to take a day or two to visit any cider makers who would have me.


Thanks in advance

G'day All,


I am chasing around the web looking for decent mill designs, and
guess what? There are very few to be found. The only real decent
one I have found is the Canadian Ag. Dept one at
http://mars.ark.com/~squeeze/ag-can/ag-book.htm     which is
interesting but I wanted to look at a few different ones. So
then,  I am looking for schematics/plans in particular of
centrifugal or rotary hammermill types.


If anyone can assist me I would be particularly stoked!


Thanks in anticipation.

I have located a very old cider press made by Palmer Brothers Engines of
Cos Cob, CT. ..probably around the turn of the century, that is 1900.
This was used until the requirements for pasteurization for fresh cider.
Supposedly, this machine would process around 500 gallons per day. It is
identical to the many machines which I saw around England, but I am sure
that at 4000.00 being the asking price there must be other machines of a
more current design that would comply with today's new laws at a better
price. Suggestions?


On another note, anyone out there with experience with Fieldcraft
topgrafter grafting machine?


Lastly, In setting up a cottage industry sized cidery including
pressing, filtration, testing and bottling where does one best turn for
equipment?

There's a cider event coming up in early November that sounds like a good
one:  "Franklin County Cider Day(s)" is the weekend of November 2-3.
Franklin County is in north-western Massachusetts.  The primary organizers
are West County Cider.  You may recognize Terry Maloney, West County's
cider-maker, as an occasional contributor to this digest.  Ben Watson
(author of _Cider,_Hard_and_Sweet_, and also an occasional contributor
here) is doing a session on ciders from the US northwest and northeast.
