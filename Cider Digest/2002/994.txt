Beach mentions Crow Egg in THE APPLES OF NEW YORK.  It is described as "...a
sweet apple which is still occasionally found in very old orchards but is
now practically obsolete."  Considering this was published in 1905, it's
interesting to see that it's still around.  The season is listed as October
and November.  Beach continues: "Some esteem it highly for dessert.  Downing
calls it not very good in quality.  The old trees are productive."


The "not good in quality" comment seems to reflect Beach's apparent bias
toward fruit likely to be accepted in the marketplace given consumer
expectations and the distribution and storage infrastructure of the time.
Many good cider apples fare poorly when evaluated as dessert fruit.


You'll find more information about Crow Egg at the Big Horse Creek Farm
website (http://www.bighorsecreekfarm.com/descriptions1.htm), including some
information on confusion between Northern and Sourthern Varieties (the
Southern is described as identical to Black Gilliflower).


Alan Foster (White Oak Cider) has it in his orchard
(http://www.crockettdesign.com/WhiteOakCider/WOurOrchard.html) and might be
able to tell you more about it's qualities in cider.  As a sweet variety, it
wouldn't surprise me if those who have experience with it suggest blending
it with sharp and/or bittersharp varieties.  I have several Crow Egg trees
grafted last Winter but won't be able to give informed opinion on cider
quality from this variety for some time to come.

A post script on Crows Egg:


VLS Charley mentions Crows Egg in THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF
CIDERMAKING:   "Apples from Britsh Columbia, Nova Scotia and Tasmania were
examined at Long Ashton with regard to their suitablity for cider-making."
Under the heading of Tasmania, Crows Egg was described as sweet cider, soft
and lacking in body.  If the fruit produced from this variety in Illinois is
comparable to that grown in Tasmania, this may give you a better starting
point in selecting varieties you may want to blend to improve
acid/tannin/sugar balance.

I have tried pressing my cider, then put into gallon jugs and freezing
until later, thaw out the jug and siphon out the top quart that is
mostly water, this greatly increases the flavor and body of the
remaining cider, then either ferment or use as sweet cider( I like sweet
cider just as well) Have others tried this method and is there a better
way to reduce the amount of water in cider? Lee Elliott

MarkE in Oz - you won't find a better design for an apple mill than the CDN
one, which in fact is a 'rotary hammermill'. . . for apple/ pear juicing
this design is the only design. . . I've been using a slightly larger,
heavier version of it to smack the lifeblood out of very many thousands of
pounds of fruit for 19 years, w/ the only 'repairs' being to turn the
'blades' around, as they tend to sharpen themselves over time. . . this
hammermill gives just the right crush for maximum yields . . . mine's 100%
stainless, xcept for the bearing  pillow blocks.


Clarence W. Walker - at 4000$, your looking at a good deal . . . the
pressing equip really has nothing to do w/ pasteurizing . . . if that rig
can do 500 gallons a day it's as good as anything made today [for the same
labor input], as long as it doesn't have black iron or mild steel parts to
corrode into the juice . . . if ya wanta look at the 'latest and greatest'
- - go to http://www.goodnature.com/juice/index.html and request a qoute . .
. if ya wanta set up a complete 'cottage industry', look into making your
own plant and equipment, come into a nice inheritance, or win a lottery.

I've got a question on something I've been wondering about for a while. Are 
there any visible physical manifestations of malolactic fermentation?
For two years running I've seen some turbulent activity in my carboys of 
cider when S.G.'s were nil, and the cider otherwise almost totally at rest. 
Time of year mid or late summer.Lees is roused, and a fair amount of bubbles 
are produced.
                                           Thanks

G'day All,


If any kind soul could advise where I can source some decent
artisan cider, local or import ( actually particularly imports)
in Australia, it would be greately appreciated.


Many Thanks

In response to L. Kammerer's quest for a custom presser, I don't know of
any.  But having grown up in Indiana, next door, we always had the Amish
press our apples.  The Amish blacksmith was also the cidermaker.  Are there
any Amish communities near you?

No idea mate, but when I cycled from Auckland to Invercargill 3 years ago,
(Kiwi, not Oz, admittedly) and I can assure you that I visited a pub at
least daily, I never saw a drop of cider.


Perhaps you are being called to start a tradition by making some yourself?

Hi


WANTED:  small commercial scale apple grinder and press - new or used
and preferably from within Canada - or at least within a few hours drive
of Nelson BC (=3D2 hours north of Spokane Wa).  Does anyone know if
there are Canadian distributors for apple presses?


thanx,  Jarrod B
