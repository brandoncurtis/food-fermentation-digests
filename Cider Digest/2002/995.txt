Hello Lee,
what you described is in fact the first step in making 'apple jack', known in
Normandy, France as calvados.  What I do is fill plastic 2 or 3L bottles
(distilled water jugs) half-full with hard apple cider (alcoholic), and freeze.
Freezing to solid takes about 1 week!   Then up-end the jugs and let them rest
on and drain into 1 qt glass canning jars.  The stuff draining into the jars is
the concentrated alcoholic apple juice, and a large colourless block of ice
stays behind.
You can drink the juice, or distill once to get brandy.
John

Just had a query raised in another forum about whether baker's yeast can be
used for brewing cider.  My assumption is that it would be no good, but I
thought I'd put the query here in case I'm wrong.

Are there any extensive pear collections in the the US other than the
Corvallis Germplasm repository?


I'm already aware of Nick Botnet/Spearheart Farms.


I've been trolling Hedrick's Pears of New York for perry varieties.  168
names later, I'm drooling at the thought - but have only located 2 'new'
ones in the Corvallis collection.

Hi Lee:  You could try freezing the cider without thawing.  I make
applejack from apple wine by placing the wine in the freezer until
frozen.  When a solution freezes, a relatively pure ice phase forms,
concentrating everything else (alcohol, sugars, etc.) in an unfrozen
component.  Then I remove the frozen container from the freezer and pour
the unfrozen liquid before the ice begins to melt.  I can convert a 12%
alcohol wine into a 25 % apple jack using this simple technique.  A
problem that you may have with sweet cider is that the solutes will be
more dilute than is the case for apple wine.  This may result in the
unfrozen component getting trapped in the ice and making it difficult to
remove.  If this is the case, try warming the freezer.  If you have
complete control of temperature, you could control the ice/unfrozen
component exactly.  Unfortunately, such is not the case for most home
freezers.  If the solution will not pour and you cannot warm the freezer
any higher, you might try freezing the solution with a fat wooden dowel
in the middle.  After everything is frozen, remove the dowel.  This will
create a well in the the middle of your container that may be more
efficient at capturing the unfrozen component.  Good luck.
