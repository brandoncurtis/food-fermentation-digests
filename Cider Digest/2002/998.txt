Dear unknown corresondent,


Please use your name when writing, much more polite.


Sounds like you could have bottled your cider a little too soon.  Most likely
the foaming you experienced was just CO2 saturated cider from the recent
fermentation but it could still be active.  A stable reading on your
hydrometer ( difficult to do with CO2 foam) over a week or so period may not
be sufficient to believe the fermentation has stopped., especially since you
had some flukey fermentation behaviors and you did not comment on your
temperatures.


Best thing to see if your fermentaion is truly finished is to measure the
sugar content with a Clinitest kit ( not Clinistix) available from your
pharmacy or a wine hobby shop or through the mail order houses. It should read
zero at the end of the fermentation.  This is really the only way to tell for
sure quickly


Likely your cider will be petillant ( sparkly) which is nice.OR if you bottled
it too soon you could end up with bottle bombs, so check it carefully over the
next few weeks by popping the top of a bottle to see if it is stable pressure
wise. You can reseal the bottle if you don't want to drink it.  Clinitest will
confirm if you are finished fermenting.
