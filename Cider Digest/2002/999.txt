Hello All, 


I started a cider about a two weeks ago and have some concerns with it.


I used 4 gallons un-pasteurized cider (nice mix of apples) 
from local orchard.


2 packs of Coopers Ale yeast ( and one more packet added-thought the 
yeast died-really slow starter)


fermented like gang busters after 12 hours w/huge krausen
temperature was (67degrees)
 OG. 1058


tasted after one week and it was really sharp/acidic.  I don't feel that
it was infected with acetobacter, as it had a different taste than that. 


I wanted to bring the acidity down (sweetness up) to counter the sharpness, 
so I added a pound of honey.


Does anyone have any other advice or suggestions for curing a cider that is 
to acidic/sharp.  Or should I just be patient and let nature take its
course.  
I am not sure of the specific gravity currently.


Cheers, 


Stefan Berggren

I likes the SF Chronicle article.  425 bottles - and I thought _I_ was a
small operation :-) 


While we're thinking of cider news articles:

TOWN OF BRIGHTON -- The dream of creating and marketing his own wine has
come true for Charles McGonegal.


He and his wife, Milissa, are the owners of AEppelTreow Winery, which is
open for business on weekends at Brightonwoods Orchard....

Just started my first batch of cider over the weekend. Used peptic enzyme
to clarify which did a great job. I'm ready to pitch yeast. Should I rack
off the trub first or just leave it there until racking after the initial
fermentation.


Thanks!
