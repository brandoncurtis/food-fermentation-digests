Subject: Tartaric/malic acid
From: Fred L Johnson <FLJohnson@portbridge.com>

Jason asks how to convert malic acid concentrations to tartaric acid
concentrations.


Tartaric acid content = 1.1194 * malic acid content


The ratio of tartaric acid content to malic acid content is simply the ratio
of their respective molecular weights (150 for tartaric acid and 134 for
malic acid).  


Of course, what one actually measures in the solution is the content of
ionizable hydrogen.  Ionized hydrogen donated by these molecules is measured
by titration with base, and since both tartaric acid and malic acid
molecules contribute only one hydrogen ion each (as compared to sulfuric
acid, which contributes two hydrogen ions for molecule), the titration of
tartaric acid and malic acid are "equivalent".  Of course, by stating the
acid content of a solution as the "tartaric acid" content, one is actually
expressing that if the ionizable hydrogen in the solution were contributed
by tartaric acid alone (and it never is except in a pure solution of
tartaric acid), that hydrogen would be coming from X amount of tartaric
acid. 


(I think I've said too much, and enough to cause more confusion.  Sorry.)

I am certain that this is not a new idea, so I present this with the hope
that someone who has experience with this would provide to me some guidance.
I wish to make a sparkling cider in the bottle that is not completely dry. I
propose to let it ferment to completion, priming the cider with fresh juice
(or perhaps dextrose), bottling the cider, allowing the cider to carbonate,
and interrupt the completion of this conditioning fermentation by placing
the bottles into very hot water  for a prescribed amount of time to kill the
yeast.  


Can anyone prescribe how much to "overprime" to provide the residual
sweetness, how long to allow the yeast to condition the bottle (3 days?),
how hot to heat the bottles?


Of course, if I'm creating bottle bombs, please stop me!

Simply multiply the results obtained as tartaric by 0.893 to express
them as malic.

Yes that relationship is always true in a general sense.  Check out

some empirical data of mine on this topic.

But surely the reason for that is that with Zinfandel nearly all the
tannins are in the skin. So you don't get to taste them as you swallow.
To extract them you have to do normal red-wine vinification, i.e.
ferment on the skins - otherwise from the free-run juice you get a
lowish tannin white wine.  Whereas with Nehou (or any apple), the
tannins are present almost as much throughout the flesh as they are in
the skin and the volume to surface area is also much larger than in a
grape anyway.

I'm not convinced there really are such chemical differences (there are
differences due to oxidation but that's something different again). 
Mostly they are human perceptual differences due to the presence of
sugar and the lack of alcohol (both of which influence perceived tannin
taste). Binding of tannins to cell wall pectin in the intact fruit may
also have something to do with it. Measuring subtle changes in tannins
is extraordinarily difficult. HPLC will take us a litle way but... The
two leaders in this field are Ann Noble at UC Davis (for sensory effects
of tannins) and Veronique Cheynier at INRA, Montpellier (France).

I think this well worth rememnbering before people get too carried away.
Over the last 30 years or so, the tannin levels in most UK ciders have
dropped significantly, to the extent that there are very few on the
market with any overt tannin taste at all (although it is important to
have some 'subliminal' levels or the mouthfeel becomes very thin
indeed). So we have a generation of cider drinkers who do not expect a
tannin taste and do not like it when they get it!

Unfortunately it doesn't work like that for apples. There are no
significant tannin differences between free-run and press juice (for
reasons given above).  If anything, the tannin level during keeving
*drops* due to oxidation, and it can be manipulated specifically for
that purpose by spreading the pulp in a really shallow layer, but it
never goes up.  It might do so if you fermented on the skins like red
wine but that is another question!

Happy New Year to you and all your contributors. And thanks for your
response to my submission. It was not really addressed at you of course. I
am glad have created some debate.


I guess the real issue is whether elaborate techniques of cider making are
worth the effort. Isn't there a danger of missing the wood for the trees?  I
agree an elaborate scientific understanding of fermentation etc is
useful..but I bet the evidence that the interventions which are derived from
this knowledge actually work reliably is very scanty. Perhaps there is an
international database of "evidenced-based" interventions in cidermaking
which have been tested in controlled trials and shown effective? We all know
one or two the cider makers who could have PhDs in pomological fermentation
science but whose cider is pretty awful.  And then there are many experts
like Andrew Lea who cider is quite excellent.


Your point on exploding bottles is a good one - I now have a much cooler
stone barn and have learnt not to bottle too early when I have added sugar. 


On Keeving - Andrew's summary is interesting. I tend to think of Keeving as
synonymous with racking off but this is only one small part of it - I guess
the term refers to the whole "french technique" starting with letting the
grass grow in the orchard to starve the apples of nitrogen. 


Andrew - why does low ph make keeving difficult?

I am curious about corking my cider (will be a sparkling cider) with wine
corks. I plan on using a #9 1.75 (high grade cork) and leaving a small
amount of cork above the lip.  Then making my own wire hood likethe ones
explained in Cider by Annie Proulx.  I will be using champagne bottles and
belgian ale 
bottles so I know that they are sturdy.  I am wondering if the cork will
provide sufficient closure to prevent loss of CO2 when second fermentation
takes place.  Has anyone ever tried this with Belgian ale bottles and or
Champagne bottles?  There does not seem to be a lot of information out there
about peoples experiences.

If your cider has 1% acidity expressed as tartaric acid, as given by
standard wine titration kits in N. America, this is equivalent to 0.65% as
sulfuric acid or 0.89% as malic acid.
Malic acid equivalent is most often used for cider and sulfuric acid
equivalent is generally used in French wine making books.
For your 2nd question, yes, generally, higher titrable acidity means lower
pH. But, as you say, there is no exact conversion factor between pH and
titrable acidity. A while ago, I made some tests and plotted measured pH vs
%titrable acidity. A fairly good fit was obtained with the following formula:
pH = 3.585 - log T
where log is base 10,
T is % acidity expressed as tartaric.
15 points were used for the fit (scientifically speaking, this is a much
too small sample). Titrable acidity ran from 0.4 to 1.8% and pH ran from
3.86 to 3.39. Maximum error between the curve and the measured points was
0.15 on the pH scale.
I make no garantee on the exactness of this formula...

It would seem to me that acid content and ph are the same thing
(directly proportional) Is that so and if so can you convert one to the
other?  If must had a %tartaric of .60, would that equal a certain ph?

Am I wrong in thinking that you can check calibration of a hydrometor by
putting water in it. Shouldn't plain water read exactly 1000 spec.
