Subject: French Cider Yeasts

As I understand the process, there is a succession of five major 
fermentative bacteria in the French Process, as identified by Loic Bertholot 
of Cote Albret Cidre, in conjunction with INRA, near Rennes.
Whilst they still make use of the wild yeast for the fermentation the cidre 
is checked with some vigilance to ensure that, over its 4 month and 13 
degree celsius, fermentation, the succession is progressing as required. If 
there does seem to be a delay Loic innoculates the cidre with the required 
bacteria.
So the fermentative bacterium are known, the succession sequence is known, 
the appropriate cidre characteristics for succession are known, now we've 
just got to get Loic (or others) to tell us what the bacterium are.


I know that this doesn't help you but it is interesting.

A response to Dick Dunn regarding tannins analysis. Because of the
chemical diversity of total phenolics, there is no method by which total
phenolics can be precisely quantitated. The Folin Ciocalteu analytical
method has been generally preferred, usually with an arbitrary standard
such as gallic acid. However, there must always be an intrinsic error of
the reactivity of non phenolics (especially RS) constituants with the
tungstate reagent. It can be relatively important in cider of low
phenolic content.
When I have done tannin apple measurements with Rhyne Cyder I used the
optical absorbance at 280 nm as a measure of total phenolics. This gave
me some kind of a comparison between apples without too much
interference. Because we do not have any anthocyanins in Cider it helps.
In wine you apply a correction of 4 to the non phenolics absorbance at
280 nm. I do not know what it would be for cider but figured if it is a
nominal correction it did not matter to me as I was doing it for a
comparison point of view. I am not familiar with the index of
permanganate but I can only assume that you would run in the same
problem since the ananlysis is based on oxydo reduction and RS is a good
reducteur. Hope this helps and answers your question.
Thanks for reading.

Dick's comments on tannin measurements in issue 1018 prompts me to add my 
nickel's worth and also include the assay results from the current cider 
trials at Mt. Vernon, Washington.  I believe there is great value in 
measuring sugar, acid and tannin in cider apple juice to see how they compare 
with data taken from the same apples in other parts of the world.  I want to 
know how my Kinston Blacks grown near Puget Sound compare to those grown in 
Sommerset and whether my cider has a chance to equal the best from the 
premier cider regions of the world.  On the other hand, if my Harry Master's 
Jerseys have half the tannins of SW England's, then maybe I would use twice 
as many in my blend.
I think the methods for measuring sugar content (brix, specific gravity) and 
acidity (pH, titratable acid) are pretty standard throughout the world, 
although attention needs to paid to acidity as to its type (sulfuric, 
tartaric, malic).  For tannin I vote for the permanganate titration method. 
The procedure is as easy as titrating with sodium hydroxide for acidity and 
the results are precise and repeatable. It may not measure "true" tannins, or 
all tannins, or whatever, but it is what was used at Long Ashton. There's 
over 80 years of data available there.  If this method is used, the results 
are directly comparable.  We don't need to reinvent the wheel here, we just 
want to know if our wheels are as fast as their's.
Anyway, below is the first data from the WSU research station.  Hopefully we 
can add to this every year and also expand the number of varieties. An 
interesting note is that the cider apples this year have roughly half the 
tannin of the LARS apples. I'd like to thank Andrew Lea for providing the 
instructions for the permanganate titration, they worked perfectly.  The data 
will be easier to read if it is pasted into a spreadsheet or table.
