Subject: "The Botany of Desire" by Michael Pollan

Just finished reading the apple chapter of Michael Pollan's
"The Botany of Desire."  I'm sure that some of the reproductive
issues surrounding apples are obvious to those who are closer
to the orchard, but I found it all to be mind-blowing.  I 
see that I missed a public appearance announcement back in
digest issue #922 (back in Oct 2001), and was wondering 
whether anyone went to the appearance and heard the guy speak.


Highly reccomended for anyone interested in the genetic and
breeding history of the apple, and even for those who aren't.
I wasn't, but found it impossible to put down once I'd started.


Any other readers and reactions out there?

Stefan,
I have found that if you sweeten your cider after it's done fermenting, and 
the yeast is ALL DONE, adding a can or two of apple juice concentrate works 
wonders.  Just my findings. Your mileage may vary.
