That seems to conflict with Warcollier.  I thought keeving required a 
pretty low temp, around 40 F, to succeed?  (Because at higher temps the 
fermentation starts too quickly.)  Am I wrong?


Cheers,

Bacteria, or yeast?  Or both?

We were fortunate to have Michael Pollan up here
in western MA in late 2001. He is an excellent
speaker, very engaging and down to earth, yet
full of great info. Highly recommended.

The cold weather has done a great job clarifying my cider. I'm ready to
prime and bottle for sparkling cider. Is there enough residual yeast in
solution to carbonate the bottled cider, or do I need to pitch some more
yeast in? Just wondering how much yeast falls out due to flocculation and
racking.




Thanks,

Hi all,
Has anyone had any experience with, or got an opinion on, malt extract as an 
additive to hard apple cider.
I will be running a couple of trial batches in the near future with the 
intent of evaluating the colouring, residual sugar and flavour that various 
levels of the extract add to the cider. I will be using (non Australian)AJC 
only.
Any thoughts, apart from how I am prostituting a fine traditional product by 
putting it together out of a can?
Thanks,
Patrick Murphy in the Land of 'Oz.

I'm trying to start again with the plan of putting sources of cider apple
varieties (tree stock) on the web site associated with the digest.  So far
I've got one source confirmed (see below) and one potential supplier who is
already sold out for the year.  I'm waiting on more info; I'll put it on
the page as soon as I have it.


In the meantime, if you know of a reputable supplier of trees for cider
apple varieties, or if you ARE such a supplier, please contact me with the
following information:
name
mailing address
email address
phone
web-site, if you have one
where you can ship
what varieties you have available, on what rootstocks


Please send this information to cider-request@talisman.com


As soon as I have complete info for you, I'll put it on the web site.


Now the part for the rest of us:  If you are looking for cider apple trees,
go to www.talisman.com/cider/sources and you'll find whatever cider apple
tree sources we have to date.


This is a commercial thing, which is why I don't put it directly on the
digest.  I can't recommend these sources, although I won't put up a listing
for a source for which I've got negative responses.  I'm just trying to
make cider apple trees more available, in order to promote cider.

You might enjoy listening to these radio interviews on realaudio:

The first covers the book "The Botany of Desire," but the second covers how 
the beef industry works (which I found much more interesting).
