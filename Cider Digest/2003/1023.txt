I live in a cold part of Australia - I am planting a number of cider
trees including Kingston Black and Stoke Red.  I have read that in
particular these 2 varieties require very high chill requirements to
break winter dormacy and both may have problems in breaking dormacy in
all but the coldest apple growing districts in Australia.


Can anyone tell me what winter chill hours are required for these 2
varieties.




Regards

 Hi Dick,


  I enjoy the cider digest very much. There is a lot of good and useful 
information for the small cider makers like us.


Hear at Clydes we make between 4-7 thousand gallons a year. we sell most of 
it in plastic half and one gallon containers. We have been making Hard cider  
for over 100 years.


Someone posted an article on adding a malt to cider and I didn't see any 
reply's. I have been wanting to do this for years and never gotten around to 
it. So if any one can give me some advise it would be appreciated. I now it 
is not a traditional thing to do but were always trying new things.


            Keep up the good work, A lot of us are reading but to lazy to 
respond.


                                 Thanks. Harold miner

I have made some dynamite cider this year, equal parts of Spitzenberg,
Cox Orange and Wickson crab.  Where in the US is there any contests I
can enter some of it? Should I call it apple wine and go for fruit wine
catagory at some of the wine competition? Have not heard competitions
talked about much on the digest. Any interest here? Lee Elliott Apple

For those of you seeking inspiration or just needing a good drink, try to find,
or persuade your local liquor store to stock, the ciders and and poires
(perrys) from Eric Bordelet in France.  As an aspiring cider-maker, I find
these incredible creations alternately uplifting (urging me to greater heights
as a ciderist) and daunting (how could I possibly make something this good?)
There are a few different products available: Sydres Brut Tendre, Doux, and
Argelette on the cider side, and Poire Authentique and Poire Granite
representing the perries.  They're all good: I think the Sydre Argelette and
Poire Granite are truly great.


Incidentally, there was a discussion here a while ago on the benefits of
keeving, or in the normally more mellifluous French language, defecation.  The
reason for using this temeperamental process become abundantly clear with your
first sip -- all right, gulp -- of these ciders.


Our local Virginia distributor (Dionysos) has stopped carrying the Bordelets,
but I know they're available around Boston and probably NYC.  In Maryland,
where I live, the distribution system is antiquated and inflexible (importing
wine from other states is, I believe, a felony), but you may have more luck
influencing your local distribution networks to come through for you.  Go
ahead, order a case if you have to.  It'll be worth it.  My only caution is
that that these products, like most ciders, are not long-lived.  Fortunately,
the bottles are dated, and we just downed a 1999 that was still alive.

I do have a question.  In his section on the composition of the apple,
Warcollier contemplates an extract made by macerating apple leaves in a
sugar yeast solution.  He suggests that the yeast secretes an enzyme that
decomposes the glucoside in the leaves, producing an aromatic compound and
a fermentable sugar that in turn gives a rich apple flavor to cider.


We make "cherry wine" each spring, actually an apertif, based on a similar
principle.  We macerate young fresh cherry leaves in vodka, then add them
to a good fruity red wine and let it sit for 6 months.  The leaves give an
intense cherry flavor, so Warcollier's musing rings a bell.  However, he
also mentions that, good as the results are, they had not resulted in
commercial application as of 1928.  Has anyone tried this?

Subject: Pruning a tree on a budget
From: Michael Vezie <mlv@pobox.com>

I've got an apple tree in my backyard that is in dire need of pruning 
before Spring.  I don't have a large budget for this, so am wondering 
what's the best and most cost effective way to prune it.  Should I buy 
the tools and do it myself?  Should I hire a professional tree person?
Or is there some other option?  I posed a question on the same general 
topic last fall and got some good tips on pruning, but am now wondering 
whether hiring someone to do it is worth the money, or if I'm better 
off doing it myself (keep in mind that I have no tools, so would have 
to buy those, too).

Greetings all,


Earlier this winter, I noticed that my Stella cherry tree had gotten
"buzzed" at about 6' off the ground (no matter, it's an experiment).


Just in the past few weeks, I've noticed that both my Empire and
Freedom apples were chewed up at the same height (all planted last
spring).  The only thing around here big enough for that is moose.


Anyone have hints for keeping the damn things away?  (At least until
I win the moose hunting lottery.)  Getting the very tops of one's
saplings chomped is so not good, I'd like to hear if anyone else has
managed to deal with such evil beasts.
