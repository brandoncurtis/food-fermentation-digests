I write this as someone who has managed commercial orchards in the past and 
presently manages and conducts research at the University of Vermont Hort 
Research Center.  I am also planting my first home orchard this 
spring.  That said, and trying not to go too far into non-cider-speak, I'll 
offer my opinions.
First, read up on scab biology.  The New England Apple Pest Management 
Guide, due for a new version soon, is a great start: 
http://pmo.umext.maine.edu/apple/PestGuidePDF/2000-2001NEAPMGdirectory.htm 
. Then step back and realize that you are growing coder fruit in your 
backyard and a) are not concerned about a commercial crop and b) do not 
want to be blasting fungicides willy-nilly.  Clean up the orchard as best 
as you can:  rake leaves and burn/compist, spread compst on the ground 
afterwards to smother and help break down remaining leaves.  Sprinkle lime 
or wood ash on the ground each spring...in New England it's generally a 
good idea anyway and it will also help to break the leaves and spores down. 
Prune your trees to allow for good light and air penetration. If you choose 
to spray, use something relatively safe like a sulfur product, but not just 
any sulfur.  Most are junk, and wash off with each rain or even dew. In my 
semi-organic block I use a product called THAT Sulfur from Stoller, Inc. 
(http://www.keylate.com) applied at 6 pints per 150 gallons of water.  This 
would equate to 0.64 fl. oz. per gallon when applied in a backpack 
sprayer.  Generally a semi-dwarf tree at a height of ten feet will require 
about a half-gallon of water to spray to wetness. The most important times 
to spray for scab management are from green tip until a couple of weeks 
past petal fall, and this material will hold for about a week between 
applications unless an inch or more of rain occurs.

Back to cider-speak.  MLF can be really tricky to achieve, and I'm no 
microbiologist  but I don't think 75 ppm of sulfite is an awful lot.  The 
scale in Proulx and Nichols' book ranges from 50-200 ppm depending on 
pH.  You may want to try one of the MLF cultures available from brewshops.


All for now,

From: "Vintage Virginia Apples LLC" <fruit@vintagevirginiaapples.com>

Dear John,


My description of Harrison is largely from A. J. Downing, The Fruit and
Fruit Trees of America, New York, 1846.  The source of Harrison today is
probably similar....the third edition of Fruit, Berry and Nut Inventory
lists two sources, Lee Elliott and Rollin Wooley's Orchard Lane Nursery from
which I got it...I think Rollin got it and Mr.. Elliott may have as well,
from Tom Burford who found it some few years ago growing in New Jersey
(this from him in conversation)....He did fruit it and described it as a dry
fleshed apple that produced an inordinate amount of juice when pressed.  It
also kept exceptionally well.  It is not an eating apple, as many of the
cider varieties are not.  I think it is interesting to grow these American
varieties which I think will have a renaissance as interest in ciders grow.
Presently the dialog that takes place on cider varieties is largely devoted
to the famous European, especially British and French varieties like
Kingston Black, Michelin, Nehou, etc.etc.  That is understandable as most of
the serious cider production and consumption in the world seems to have been
located there for the last century and we all turn to serious work like
Andrew Lea's for instruction....but the vast seedling apple orchards of
North America produced thousands of trees grown largely for cider when that
commodity was a critical dietary staple as well as an important commodity
for barter and was produced on virtually any farm of substance in the
country.  Many of these have been lost to cultivation as cider consumption
declined in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries here....but it
is an intriguing idea to think of what may be produced with blends of some
of these.  I am not aware that any of these have been classified as sharp,
bitter, etc., which again is so regularly applied to the British cultivars.
There is much work to be done, needless to say.    All of this takes an
inordinate amount of time.  You are putting in trees that will take at least
four to six years to give you an appreciable crop with which to
experiment....I hope to have apples from our Harrison trees for the first
time this year.  There are very very few commercial producers of fine cider
in this country...a few in New England, a few on the West Coast...but one
hears of other fledgling or planned enterprises--I am aware of a couple in
Virginia--the most serious and far along to date is Diane Flynt's farm in
southwest Virginia....She has trees in the ground for experimenting, but her
real production will be a few years off.  She attended the Cider Making
short course at Pershore last year, but I understand funding has curtailed
that--even in England--and she has visited a number of other cidermakers in
this country.  My brother has pressed away and fermented a number of our
apples with varying (and some quite good} results, but considers himself
rather completely a novice.  We have hosted what we call a CiderMaker's
Forum here in the fall as part of our series of seminars and workshops and
plan to do so again....November 22 is this years date.  We had Gabriele
Rausse,  perhaps the dean of Virginia's winemakers who is developing a bit
of cider production at Monticello as part of its horticultural program, as
our keynote speaker last year...we also featured a roundtable discussion of
those making cider on their experiences and I brought in all the serious
ciders I could reach for tasting--some of the French, Murdo Laird's from
California, a couple of the Farnum Hill ones that I could get....We hope to
expand on this as an annual event.
Well this has become a rather lengthy rejoinder....but perhaps it will be
helpful..

  Charlotte:


  Do you know what type of cider apple the Harrison is?  The description of
it on your website doesn't actually address the apple's flavor
characteristics.  Would you happen to know if it's a Sharp, a Sweet, a
Bittersharp or a Bittersweet?  I have a feeling that the few people I've
found who are growing this apple (Blue Ridge Cider and Nashoba Valley
Winery) may have ultimately gotten their stock from you and are soon to be
pointing me back in your direction for info.


  Any additional info greatly appreciated.  Thanks again.

According to apple and cider historians, the Harrison was one of the 
mainstays of the US cider industry in the Northeast, especially around 
Newark, NJ (times have changed.)  It's listed as extinct in Calhoun's 
Southern Apples, but Tom Burford claims to have rediscovered it, and it 
is now available from a few specialty suppliers.  I have two trees n my 
own orchard, and aside from stem length (the historical Harrison had a 
very long stem, mine don't) it matches the description very well.  It's 
not a very tannic apple, but it seem to have lots of sugar and a good, 
but not overwhelming, flavor.  Too early to tell if it's a) really 
Harrison and b) as good as they make out.

Yes.  As the pH drops the sulphite becomes more effective because more
of it shifts in equilibrium to the 'molecular' form which is the only
lethal form able to penetrate cells.  See my paper 'Sulphite Binding in
Ciders' for PDF download at

If you don't know the pH you are really shooting in the dark with
sulphite addition. Also, 0.08% is very _non_acidic!  Are you sure you
don't mean 0.8% malic?  At that acid (0.8%), the pH is likely to be
around 3.2.  That is quite low for MLF to begin, whether or not any
sulphite still remains.  Usually MLF begins once the weather warms up so
I would wait until June or so before worrying. If you want predictable
MLF you can add cultures nowadays which are pretty good. I did this last
year (reported here previously) and I recommend that route.

Thanks Eli,


I'm sure I can find a few references going back to the 1890's, possibly
even back to John Evelyn (1664).  It will take a little while to put the
dossier together but I think it would be worthwhile!


(Or just unutterably sad, depending on your viewpoint!)

In addition to the competitions listed by Charles, another big 
one is the Sunshine Challenge, organized by the Central Florida 
Home Brewers (www.cfhb.org).  These are the same folks that put 
on the annual Meadlennium competition every January.  The Sunshine 
Challenge is May 16-18, 2003.

I have no affiliation with Cummins Nursery, except as an occasional 
customer, and hope that this does not tread on being considered a 
commercial on this list, but:


Cummins nursery currently has a heck of a surplus sale going on for 
English/French cider trees.  Orders will probably have to be made soon to 
ensure timely shipping.  I say this not necessarily to suggest that people 
dig up the best bargains they can, but more to encourage Cummins to 
continue grafting these varieties.  If they cannot sell what they graft, 
they won't graft them in future years.


Find them at http://www.dabney.com/cumminsnursery/freebie.htm


Again, sorry about the seeming "commercial."
