(If you get the Mead-Lover's Digest, you've already seen this.)


A couple things about digest operation, first one is important:  If mail
to you bounces because your account is over quota, I'll forgive it *once*.
But if two consecutive digests bounce, or if I see repeated bounces in a
short interval, I'll treat it as failed mail and unsubscribe you.  The
number of over-quota bounces I have to deal with lately is getting out of
hand, particularly from the "throwaway" accounts at free mail ISPs.  I
understand that with the amount of spam, it can occasionally get away from
you.  But I also understand that the cost of disk space to store a typical
CD is perhaps US $0.00001; mail quotas at any reasonable ISP should be
generous.


Second, for those of you submitting articles:  I've long insisted on
articles fitting in an 80-column window.  Unfortunately, as the number
of crippled mail programs in the universe increases, more people seem to
find it more difficult to configure their mailers to do conventional text
wrapping.  So I'm going to try re-wrapping lines on articles where the
text looks like it needs to be flowed, see how much work that adds, and
see if it screws up anything.  To help me out, if you know how to control
your mailer, please do so!  This is especially true if you want your
article to appear in the Digest the way you wrote it and intended it.
(I recommend breaking at about 72-75 columns to allow for the "> "
attribution markers.)  I'll continue to reject articles with long lines
if the text is tabular or the layout appears to matter.  I will also reject
articles that get RE-wrapped, where each longish line gets turned into a pair
of one normal line followed by a short overflow line.  I'm not going to try
to repair that sort of damage...too much work and too much risk of screwing
it up.


NOTE: if your article gets munged up in the process of my reformatting,
please tell me; I want to know if what I'm doing is hurting rather than
helping.


Now, back to cider, OK?

Folks -
I really should have held Terry's article from the last digest, as it was
over the line to "commercial" (as Terry was concerned).  Mind you, it's
certainly not anything against Cummins; it's that the digest shouldn't be
"playing favorites" with one supplier over the others.


sorry,
Dick

Greetings from Poland


We are planting a small patch of applles in Poland and decided  to start
producing cider next year. We all know it as consumers. Now we look for
recipes, and it`s not such a problem to find them. The problem starts, when
we want to get to accesories, especially profesional ones. We have had our
own wines for many years, but now, we want to try the cider. Not the same
technique, not the same problems. We would like to sell it in the nearest
future, so we need proffesional equipment (norms, rules etc.) If You could
help us in any way, we would be greatful.

Hear, hear!  I have long thought there must be mileage in developing or
rediscovering specific North American cider cultivars rather than just
following what we Europeans happen to have done.  Just because it suits
us doesn't mean it will necessarily suit you!


Forget you ever heard of Tremletts Bitter or Kingston Black, and all
power to your collective elbows!!  Hey Ho for the Harrison and its kin!

G'day All,


Had a interesting day crushing 2 different fruit types.


Batch 1 was a blend of our own seedling perry pears from 10 different
trees. Interesting bunch to say the least.


Batch 2 {for something a little different} was a single variety of dessert
style Nashi (Asian) Pears (very Buerre Bosc like), but one of the brown
skinned cultivars. You should have seen the colour of the juice. It was
like toffee colour. Amazing. Not bad juice either, but pretty short supply
of acid though. My main use for this will be blending to sweeten up the
other blend depending on who is drinking it, if you know what I mean ;-)


Anyway, just though I would let you all know what is going on here in Oz in
Autumn!

weeks and has kindly offered to bring some cider back for us to drink
back here in the states.Thanks in advance for your suggestions and so
much good information on cider and apples. Dan in Reno

Subject: What is Real Cider
From: "Mark Ellis - Artisansrus.com" <mark@artisansrus.com>

G'day Cider folk,


Well the discussion rages on ukcider about how to best define "Real Cider"
or whether it should even be called "Real Cider", which in itself follows
the CAMRA  principle of "Real Ale"


Well as a Aussie, maybe I have a unique prospective???? ;-)


Now I know certain countries have a need to observe commercial intricacies
regarding the literature of certain of products, and indeed this must by it
definition take precedence to all other considerations.....


So.......


I recommend;


I seem to have struck upon a system that might work, well maybe.


Traditional **** Cider -  Methode ****


The traditional part being inclusive that the product maintains 100% juice
, with no non-apple sugar additions. May or may not have preservative
additions. May be still or be naturally carbonated without any non-apple
sugar additions.


The **** part would be the regional definition. i.e., British, French,
Spanish, German, American, Aussie blah. That way the somewhat narrow
construct which define cider for the various.


Example A. - eg. [just pretend now] The Maestro, Andrew Lea, produces a
product called "Olde Gold" Lets say a Tremlett's and KB blend as a
Champagne style seeing that it has been a superb year and that sugars where
very high and the product is deserving of the style. So it would read on
the label;


Traditional British Cider - Methode Champenoise


This would cement the notion that Traditional Cider would be pure apple
juice [whether concentrates or not is a different issue entirely], and that
it uses apple juice (where carbonation is desired) to provide a sparkling
product..


Just thought this up so would like to encourage discussion re. same.


Catcha

Subject: Pear choices

Hey y'all.


First, thanks Dick for all your janitorial work on this digest.  
Thanks also to all the contributors of questions and responses.  
Signal to noise here continues to be great, even after all these 
years.


Now about pears:


I recently bought a house with several fruit trees.  Among them
are a Bartlett and a Chojuro (Asian pear).  The trees are
probably about ten years old, planted in about 1994.  They have
been quasi-neglected for the past five to seven years.  As I
develop my pruning scheme, I thought I might try to develop a new
scaffold or two of a good perry pear.  I am fortunate enough to
live in Corvallis, so I suspect I can get scion wood if I really
want it.


I generally make meads, but sometimes make cider and cyser.  I 
want to use some of my pears for a nice pear mead.  Two 
questions:


1.  Am I nuts to use Bartlett pears for a pear mead?  What about 
Chojuro?


2.  I would consider grafting some additional scion onto my
existing trees.  I'm wondering if anyone has any input on what
pears you might want if you were limited to two to four main
branches total.  The Bartlett is on dwarf rootstock, and the
Chojuro is on semi-dwarf.


In the near future, I will be posting this message (with some 
more mead-focused content) to the Mead Lovers Digest.  The other 
questions really aren't appropriate here.


Cheers!
