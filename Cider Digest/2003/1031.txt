Hi again


I'm all for bottle conditioned cider, not only is it good to drink but also
keeps indefinitely so might be easier to get into pubs as you don't have the
problem of manageing cider going in a cask that isn't consumed quickly.


You can't however call it "methode champenoise" or the French will sue you.
"bottle conditioned" will do.

Subject: Old trees/New trees

  Do old apple trees produce better cider?  Not too long ago one
  experienced cider maker told me he "doesn't trust" the fruit from young
  trees.  A few days later another old time cider maker and orchardist
  scoffed at this notion when I asked him about it.  He argued that the
  variety and the terroir are of the utmost importance, and that the age
  of the root system are not that important.  I am wondering if any cider
  makers have experience or opinions regarding this question, specifically
  those who live or have traveled in traditional cider making regions
  where the art is still alive.  Are old trees being replaced by younger,
  smaller trees?Also, a question regarding apple scab- how damaging are
  scabby apples to a cider's flavor?  Do infected trees produce lesser
  quality cider fruit?   I hope everyone's cider is tasting good,  Jason

Subject: "vintage": Can this misusage be saved?
From: rcd@talisman.com (Dick Dunn)

In Cider Digest 1028, I mentioned a class of English cider apple...
>...These are the varieties

> varietal cider.


I want to pick up something I only alluded to in that note:  that the use
of the term "vintage" has shifted.  There's a problem.


Current usage is, as I indicated, a tag for varieties suited for single-
varietal ciders.  Several of the current best and most common cider/apple
books--Proulx & Nichols, Watson, Morgan & Richards, for example--use the
term this way.


Unfortunately, the "classical" usage is different.  It refers to those
varieties which have particular characteristics suitable for cider-making,
but doesn't imply single-varietal ciders.  The term "vintage"was coined (or
appropriated, if you will) by Hogg and Bull (yes, those are the real names!)
in the late 19th century, to refer simply to particularly good cider
varieties.


And thus the problem:  There are lists of varieties which are tied to the
classical usage of "vintage".  People have picked up those lists and
associated them with the modern usage, leading them to think that certain
varieties are suitable for single-varietal ciders when in fact those apples
are way out of balance.


The change in meaning seems to have happened relatively recently in cider
history.  I've been swapping notes with Andrew on this topic off-list for
a while now.  Andrew dug up the following explanation from Beech and
Pollard, _Cidermaking_, 1957:
    "Vintage quality is not to be confused with balance of flavour as
    defined by acidity, sweetness, and astringency - these are easily
    determined by chemical analysis as well as by taste. A cider can be
    balanced in flavour and yet lacking vintage quality; conversely a
    vintage cider may be out of balance - for example, a cider made entirely
    from vintage sharps would be excessively out of balance and would
    require blending with ciders lower in acidity.  One of the arts of cider
    making is to blend the fruit varieties or ciders made from them to give
    a cider balanced in flavour and at the same time to bring out and
    combine the particular qualities of the varieties.  No blend of
    indifferent fruit varieties will give a vintage cider although the blend
    can be adjusted to give a drinkable product for everyday use."
Andrew notes that Beech and Pollard worked for B T Barker at Long Ashton.
Barker led the work to classify and analyze the "vintage" (classical sense)
varieties at LARS over quite a few years, and published several lists of
what were considered vintage varieties.  Barker's work is the reference for
these English varieties.  (See Copas' _A_Somerset_Pomona_.)


So now what?


The current mis-use of "vintage" probably has to go, somehow.  Even though
the Barker work is "older", it's still the ground-work for the term.  That
usage is also being carried forward in current books, such as _Fermented_
_Beverage_Production_ or _A_Somerset_Pomona_.


But can we get rid of the current usage and revert to the older, or are we
stuck with putting the term "vintage" on the shelf?
