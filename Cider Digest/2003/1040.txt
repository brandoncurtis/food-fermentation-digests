As some of you know I have relocated from my orchard in PA to the CA 
coast in Santa Cruz- wine county! One would have thought from the east 
coast that there might be a number of  cider makers here as Watsonville 
( about 15 miles south) was and still a major producers of apples-.i.e 
Martinelli's is located there. But No! Very few people I have met have 
even tasted let alone make cider.
My wife and I -( she allergic to most wines- sulfites??)-had no choice 
but to experiment and have had great results.
    For whatever reason in the east I was unaware of White Labs English 
Cider Yeast #wlp 775. A great yeast that keeps/enhances the apple 
flavor. This in combination with the only available juice- unknown 
pasteurized blends from Bartellis or "Santa Cruz organic apple juice" at 
$5/gallon ( versus $2/gallon in PA for known varieties) and different 
amounts of sugar ranging from none to whatever percentage my PA Dutch 
recipes call for have resulted in our ability to go to the best 
restaurants, offer a taste and then swap bottles for dinner. Great 
artisinal cider is an unknown here.
    So far I cannot get the numbers to work to make it a business 
venture. Maybe if I would send tanker trucks of PA apple juice to CA it 
would but I suspect that we wouldn't get across the border without some 
major taxes being added to our costs.

Hello Everyone,


I was hoping someone can help me with a bit of advice.
I'm interested in priming a standard 5 gallon batch of
a cider with apple juice or apple juice concentrate.
So far, I've only used cane sugar in the recommended
ratio of 1/2 cup/5 gallons, which I've found to have
inconsistent results. My main question involves how
much juice to add to the bottling bucket, as I haven't
been able to find any info on this. Also, if using
apple juice concentrate, should I simply thaw and add
to the bucket, or should this be hydrated first? Any
advice would be greatly appreciated. (If it makes a
difference, the cider was fermented from an unknown
blend, with malic acid and tannin powder added to
bring those levels up to the acceptable range. The
starting gravity was 1.049, the finished gravity is
1.005, the yeast used was sweet mead, and the cider
was treated with a clearing agent, Crosby and Baker's
Super-Kleer, rich is a combination of kieselsol and
chitosan, two days ago.)


Thank you for your help,
