 Congratulations---- almost a clean sweep for the USA at the Hereford
Cidermuseum Cider Competetion, in the UK. First for the Boston Beer Co
in the Dry , Medium  and Sweet, and  a near miss for the US  in the
bottle fermented class. We have a serious competition in Somerset at the
Bath and West Show it would be nice to see you there next May. Julian

 I have found a good source of used wooden barrels in southern Maine if
your interested in traveling that far. The number is 207-883-6378. He is
located in Scarborough, Just south of Portland. The best time to call
him is after 5 weekdays or on weekends. He also has a big selection of
metal and plastic food grade barrels.

There's no simple answer to the tasting question. I've fermented 100% Golden
Russet juice before, and the specific gravity and sweetness at the outset is
great (even the acidity was decent). Yet, fermented out, it is relatively
one-dimensional and uninteresting -- great mouthfeel, but boring taste. (I
could have predicted that by drinking the sweet cider -- it's good, but the
rich sweetness overwhelms the other elements.) It's great for blending with
the high-acid seedling apple juice that we have, though.


My advice would be to look for a juice that sounds like what you already buy
- -- something that you like to drink, that has the depth of taste that
late-season apples like russets lend, plus a sprightliness or "brightness"
of decent acidity that many apples (like the fine Esopus Spitzenburg) confer
to the juice. If your fermented cider tastes thin and "flabby," it would
probably be good to try and get a juice pressed from some European
bittersweets or bittersharps, or from wild apples or even russets or dessert
varieties like Liberty, which have a bit more tannin in their skins.


When you say that your finished, fermented cider lacks "apple flavor," you
may well be missing that crucial balance of the three elements (sweetness,
acidity, and body) more than actual taste.


I would suggest trying an experiment with a gallon of the same juice, from
the same orchard you buy from now. If you want to avoid stopping
fermentation before it's completely finished -- which is probably the best
method for retaining residual sugar and flavor -- I would add extra sugar to
the juice to bring up its specific gravity before fermenting. Then I would
go out and buy a sweet mead yeast and use that to ferment the juice. Mead
yeast, unlike Pasteur Champagne, Epernay/Cotes des Blancs, and other common
white wine yeast strains, tends to not work well at higher alcohol levels,
and will generally leave a residual sweetness.


You might or might not like the flavor characteristics that the yeast
contributes, but if so, you're only out a gallon of juice and a packet of
yeast.

To let Oz cider buffs know -  Henry's at Harcourt in Central
Victoria has opened for business with cider & perry.  They are at
219 Reservoir road. Harcourt (03)5474 2177 - open for tasting
& sales Wednesdays to Sundays.  I think his current brew
(mainly Pink Lady I think) is very good - I tried it last week.  They
have also planted a lot of traditional cider varieties, so we can
expect that some interesting stuff is on the way.

That is very intriguing!  Hogg's description (the Fruit Manual 1884) is
as follows:


"Fruit small, 2 inches wide and the same in height; ovate , flattened and
irregularly shaped. Skin pale yellow streaked with red  next the sun,
and covered with a few patches of grey russet. Eye open with flat
reflexed segments. Stalk short. Flesh soft and woolly, but not dry......
A most excellent cider apple... a dry soil with a calcareous subsoil
being considered the best adapted for producing its cider in perfection"


Well it's difficult to tell if it's the same apple or not! On the other
hand the name Hagloe is so unusual (and refers just to one tiny parish
in Gloucestershire) that it seems unlikely it would have been mistaken
for anything else.  Though the Russian connection is obscure!  And
certainly in the UK there's no way it would be mature by July /
August.    Anyway a few specimens are still alive and kicking on its
home patch, even if no more than a curiosity
(http://www.orchard-group.uklinux.net/glos/apples/index.html).  Another
(UK) correspondent has told me that the grafts take very badly, which is
a pity since I would be interested to grow it because it would suit my
soil here very well.


Many thanks for the info, Thomas.

      The comment by Jack Feil about putting cider on the wine shelf is 
worth noting I think
.    For too long cider has had the image of being a cheap drink available 
in large quantity . The only economical way to produce cider like that is 
to use cheap ingredients and a cheap process . We aren't going to get 
quality cider in the marketplace unless we are willing to pay at least jug 
wine prices and give commercial cider makers a chance to produce a good 
product . I have heard some commercial winemakers say that they would be 
quite happy to produce a good cider in their wineries , and could , if they 
would get a decent price but that they can't hope to get juice from 
selected cider apples , make cider only once a year (unlike microbrew beer 
which can be made anytime ) and use a wine like process , including 
bottling and not go under doing it .
     Cider drinkers are waiting to see good cider burst on to the North 
American marketplace as good wine and microbrew beer  have done . If apple 
growers and commercial cider makers are going to do it we are going to have 
to pay them .

Recent postings regarding cider definitions, brings to mind one definition
that I dislike, that being "hard cider". As many readers know, in Europe
"cider" is the juice of fermented apples. Only in North America has it been
changed to "hard cider" by lore, literature and federal law pertaining to
its manufacture. In my view, "hard cider" sounds like the kind of stuff that
happens by accident, apple juice left on a back porch; the sort of stuff the
old farmer made, good for a hang over, good for a funny story but not a
particularly good drink.


Why change? First of all, according to the New Oxford Dictionary the
definition of "cider" is fermented apple juice. All the precedents to the
word suggest that is it a fermented drink.


According to Warcollier, "hard" cider is cider which contains unacceptable
levels of acetic acid.


Do you want hard water? serve hard time? or sleep on a hard mattress?
Literally, "hard" and "cider" are a lame linguistic coupling.


It seems to me if we want to get beyond the point where the most available
ciders are a bland, sweet, carbonated drink with some apple content by
chance, there needs to be a effort to get rid of the "hard" and proclaim
"cider" as fermented apple juice, that it can be dry or sweet, that it can
be still or carbonated etc. Any ideas on this? or am I just raising the
wrath of those who believe that we should adhere to our provincial
mythology?

Not only do they have all the tools you need for your orcharding, but in 
Conway MA, they're just about in your back yard.  They have fresh, used 
bourbon barrels for around $125 I recall.
