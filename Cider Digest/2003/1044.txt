As a maker of apple juice for about ten years, and an experimenter with 
cider for three, the issue of special competition brews is something 
that really irritates. I have been to the National Fruit Show (UK) 
apple juice competition (and the great taste awards), and tasted the 
winning entries. These can only be described as wonderful, but also 
fraudulent, as I have no doubt that the same juices are not available 
for the public to buy, and in fact, often the winners of these 
competitions produce some pretty poor juices for the public to buy, and 
yet promote them as winners. I am sure that this is an issue that the 
wine industry has faced, and I can only imagine that the safest way to 
sort out this problem is for a sample to be taken from a retail outlet 
supplied by the juice or cider-maker, at an unspecified time by an 
unknown person. However, the logistics of this are frightening. It 
would be worthwhile for the organisers of any serious competitions to 
communicate with the wine fraternity, to find out how it should be done.

UK Cider Competitions.
 Following the surprise outcome of the Hereford Cider Championship-- almost
all the prizes being awarded to the Boston Beer Co-- a few cynical
cidermaker makers are fuelling the rumour of foul play.  It would seem
that one of the judges, there were two, made the cider for the Boston beer
Co!
However the Bath and West Cider Competition was a huge success, 200 entries
from the UK, Spain, France, Sweden and Finland, a judge, well respected in
the UK wine trade, and the Supreme Cider Award going to a small tradition
Somerset cidermaker Perry Bros of Dowlish Wake. Nearer the time we'll be
happy to organize enties. Julian@ciderbrandy.co.uk

Hello, I'm sure someone out there has an answer to my question. I've read
a lot about making cider and have my first two batches ready for
bottling. I used wyeast cider yeast in one batch and wyeast Chablis for
the other batch. I started both at the same time and used the same juice
,all Jonathon that was well sweated, my finished product is completely
fermented with an alcohol content of 8%. The batch where I used the
Chablis yeast is very smooth while the Cider yeast batch has a noticeable
but not unpleasant bite. While I don't know the reason for the
difference, I assume that the Cider batch didn't convert as much of the
malic acid to lactic acid as did the Chablis batch. Does the type of
yeast used for the primary fermentation have an effect on the secondary
fermentation ? I have not seen anything about that in my readings.


              Thanks, Jack Feil

I'm putting together a presentation for the upcoming American Homebrewers
Association Conference and would like to poll the CD for some information.


I wanted to mention some (fermented) cider oriented gatherings/events, and
realized I didn't actually know of many.


I'm aware of the West County Cider Day(s), over in Colrain, MA. I've heard
that Vintage Virginia Apples organizes one.


Are there any on the Pacific Coast? Great Lakes? Canada?


Has anyone been to several, and would care to compare/contrast them?

I'd like to consider moving up from glass carboys to larger
containers for the possible producion of cider for sale.
In a visit several years ago to the UK I noticed that many
people were using plastic drums (~ 50 gallons?) for
production and from a cost perspective versus oak barrels
that makes sense.  I bought a food grade 55 gal drum last
year and cleaned it with baking soda and still, after the
fermentation stage, got a cider that tasted like plastic.
Possibly I didn't know the proper specs for a plastic
barrel.
Several years ago while visiting an orchard in western Mass
I noted that the cider maker was using a cube shaped plastic
container that, as I recall, he said was ~250 gallons in
size but I have not been able to track down a source for
this type of container
Used oak barrels at at least $150 used and Kraus's catelogue
wants $530 for a 28 gal new French Oak one. ~50 gallon
plastic drums are ~$35.  How about beer barrels which are
made from stainless steel I think - I haven't explored
finding them or their price?
Can anyone enlighten me on what I might use and the pros and
cons of each.
Thanks
