I just want to thank everyone who responded to my post.  It seems that 
there is a consensus here, DON'T BOIL YOUR APPLE JOUCE!  I will try 
another concentrate batch and report the outcome.  Hopefully, the flavor 
doesn't come up.  Thanks again for the great support from this list 
(it's the most congenial I've joined yet)--cam

Apropos the previous (and only!) note in the digest queue...although we may
be congenial, we are occasionally taciturn to a fault.  Having only one real
message in the last nine and a half days, I'm taking this occasion to push
out a Cider Digest, remind everyone that we still exist, stave off the
impending inquiries of "did you unsubscribe me", and perhaps even embarrass
somebody into contributing (he ducks).
