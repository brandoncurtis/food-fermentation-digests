As Claude suggested bigger in not necessarily better with cider apples, so
thin for the health of the tree rather than the size of the fruit. Typically
we hand thin to two/three apples per cluster on those varieties which are
not prone to biennialism. On the biennial varieties we do the same and
completely remove alternate clusters as Ian suggests. However to date this
task does not seem to be worth the effort particularly with Browns and
Porters. They either crop or are barren and unfortunately they all seem to
be on the same cycle so we are left with either a good crop of sharp apples
or virtually nothing. My question is, given the strong biennial nature of
these varieties could you reverse the trend by completely removing the bloom
on a "on year" so the tree would bear the following?  The strategy being to
get half the trees to bear each year. A half crop would be better than
nothing, and make thinning less of an effort when a tree is "on". Has anyone
tried this?

I would tend to agree with Prof. Merwin. In fact, when I wrote that one
should thin just enough to prevent alternance, I meant "Ideally, this is
what we should do". But personnally, I don't do any thinning because I
think it is too time comsuming and it doesn't help much with varieties with
strong alternance tendency. I rather try to control alternance with
pruning, but this doesn't work very well either. And, as we all do cider,
we don't have to produce market quality apples - the small percentage of
perfect apples can be put aside for consumption and the rest go to the press.

I think on some varieties, thinning can help (and pruning also) to regulate
the production, but on some other varieties, nothing will.

I have a question here - what do you think of true Champagne? Would you say
the sparkling hides defects? It is true that a "cidre plat" can be
excellent, but a naturally sparkling "cidre bouche sec" is more festive. A
bad cidre will be bad, sparkling or not. I think both have their place,
just as white wine and Champagne also have their place.

A good cidre should taste good, wether it is cool, cold or hot... On a hot
summer day, I prefer it cold, but during a cold winter evening...

Well, I must admit that, obviously, we are not talking about the same type
of extractor. The one I tried is one of those 30$ extractor that you can
use to make juice from carrots, turnips, cucumbers, etc... What I didn't
like with the apple juice is that there were a lot of particles mixed with
the juice (a bit like "orange juice with pulp"). Also, there was a lot of
foam on top of the juice. I didn't like it. Another problem was that this
lack of homogeneity made it difficult to test the density and the acidity.

    The Normandy cider apple producers still maintain a research station at 
Sees . They were still doing research and producing annual reports a few 
years ago although I haven't found out what they are doing recently .
     They did several years research on chemical thinning reported on in 
1994 . The work was done on local varieties such as Petit Jaune , Douce 
Coetligne etc . They were specifically concerned with biennial bearing
They reported disappointing results with chemical thinning in their report 
. Their comments in conversation suggested that biennialism is inevitable 
with the varieties prone to it , becoming more pronounced as the trees age 
and apparently determined by local growing conditions . They were 
recommending that experiments to control it end , being fruitless so to speak.
      My own experience is that there are big difference in varieties and 
it would be best to concentrate on the ones that show the tendency least .
      I have Muscadet de Dieppe going from a heavy load one year to no 
apples at all next while Yarlington Mill seems to give a consistent crop 
each year . I think it will take years of local observations to make 
recommendations on varieties . Being a fourth or fifth generation cider 
maker would have its advantages .

Well I for one would agree. A 'naturally conditioned' glass-bottled
crown-capped cider (with a little of its own yeast necessarily present)
lasts at least 2 -3 years in my experience. During that time the flavour
may change and will even improve quite a bit due to the continuing
biochemistry, remaining a very drinkable proposition.  Eventually
autolysis and a certain 'tiredness' sets in!


The judgement rather depends what your 'control' is, of course. 
Evidently a cider which is bottle conditioned in glass will be fine for
years. If in PET it will still tend to oxidise fairly quickly because
oxygen can permeate the plastic, so its lifetime is only a few months.
If in a barrel of course it can go seriously acetic in just a few weeks.
The control which I've never done as a true paired comparison is in
pasteurised bottle (preferably with SO2) to compare with bottle
conditioned.  Under such circumstances the cider cannot 'mature' but it
will certainly remain good and stable for a year or more.
