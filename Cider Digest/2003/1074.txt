sidre (now cidre), corresp. to It. sidro, cidro; Sp. sidra fem.,

presents difficulties, there can be no doubt that it represents late
L. sicera (med.L. cisara, cisera), Gr. , a word used by the LXX, the
Vulgate, and Christian writers to translate Heb. shkr intoxicating
liquor, `strong drink', of the O.T., f. shkar to drink deeply or
to intoxication. It is not clear where or how the phonetic change
from sicera to sidra took place; but perh. the intermediate link
was sizra (sitsra, sidzra): cf. F. ladre from Lazarus. In common
use cidre had already acquired the sense of `fermented drink made
from apples' before it was taken into English. But the earlier
sense of `strong drink' generally was retained in translation of,
and allusions to, the Vulgate; and in this sense the word had often
forms much nearer to the Latin, as ciser, cisar, cyser, seser:
these forms are not used in the sense `cider': see SICER.]

Ira,
I have done it with early apples like Yellow Transparent: freeze them in a
freezer, take them out about a day before pressing, and press WITHOUT
milling. If you mill them, you will make a mess, but slowly pressing whole
apples works quite well, and the yield is actually increased.

re: wood finishes for presses


I was NOT impressed with the epoxy that HVR was distributing for a while.
Although it was fine for the body of the press, it peeled off the grinder
after the first year.  Mineral oil is the best treatment by far, as far as
I'm concerned.

There was (at least!) one thinko in my note in CD 1073--I said:
>...Titebond II, which is a PVA.  Would a PVC glue like Gorilla Glue be OK?


DOH!
Gorilla Glue is polyurethane, not PVC.  I know better, honest I do!
Speaking of that, I'm working on replacing the grinder cylinder in my
HVR press...I'm making it of white oak glued up with Gorilla Glue.  So
I've already placed my bet on glue safety, that it should be OK...although
as I said, there is almost negligible glue surface exposed compared to the
finish.

Dick:

True.  See:
http://www.popularwoodworking.com/features/finish3.html


>(Boiled linseed oil is a notable exception: It is known NOT to
>be food-safe.)


Where did you hear that?
Linseed oil has one big advantage, as I see it: It penetrates into the 
wood, rather than forming a surface film, so it doesn't flake or 
chip.  Second big advantage is that it is easily renewed.  It is true that 
it contains certain metals as drying agents, but these are in such small 
concentrations as to be negligible once the finish has cured in the wood.


Its chief drawbacks are that it takes a very long time to fully cure 
(probably a month), and it provides very little moisture protection.  This 
is both good and bad: it means moisture can get into the wood, but it also 
means it can get back out again.  One disadvantage to film-building 
finishes is that they can trap moisture inside the wood.

True.

I wouldn't recommend _any_ finish, actually - the conditions are so adverse 
that you're better off using a rot-resistant wood, like white 
oak.  (Barrels aren't finished on the inside - why worry about your press?)


If you feel you must use a finish, go with epoxy.  It is by far the most 
chemical-resistant and moisture-resistant finish, virtually inert and 
immune to acids or bases.


>I've seen a suggestion to use mineral oil...which would certainly be food-

Waste of time and money.


>I've seen a suggestion to use vegetable oil...which is a **terrible** idea

True.

A good two-part epoxy, properly mixed and applied, is going to be pretty 
resistant to any kind of chemical attack.  Malic acid isn't very corrosive 
- - we drink it, after all! - and 7% alcohol isn't a particularly strong 
solvent.  Epoxy is used in chemical applications where it is exposed to far 
harsher environments.


Polyurethane finishes are also going to be pretty inert in that 
environment, but they probably won't hold up as well as epoxy.  Moisture 
will get behind the finish, though small cracks or pinholes, and either 
cause the wood to mildew or cause the finish to peel.  Or both.


>Similar questions arise about glues, and again the matter of "food safety"

>The only waterproof wood glue that's actually certified for food contact

I'd use it.  The stuff is impervious to water, and non-reactive when 
cured.  (It's not PVC, it's polyurethane.)


>  Barring anything explicitly toxic in the formulation,
>I'd think glue couldn't be much of a problem, since the exposed surface of

Exactly.  And the amount of material you could leach off those surfaces is 
extremely small, so the glue is literally the least of your worries, from a 
toxicity standpoint.  The phenols in the wood itself are probably more 
toxic than anything you'd get from the finish or the glue.  (Recall that 
wood has antiseptic properties... that means it's toxic to a certain degree!)


The 7% alcohol in the finished cider is probably more toxic than whatever 
might leach out of a finish you put on your press.  Not to mention the 
hundreds of other organic compounds present in cider, many of which 
undoubtedly are toxic in large enough quantities.  Remember, "the dose 
makes the poison."  (What do you suppose causes hangovers?)


The whole issue of "food-safe finishes" is a hoax, in my opinion - a type 
of modern myth, like the cat in the microwave.  Misplaced concern.  But 
that's just my opinion...  FWIW.  I come at this from two different 
perspectives: 17 years of professional consulting in hazardous materials 
management and environmental engineering, and 3 years of professional 
furniture building.

after 20 years of small scale juice pressing, my 2c is that the only really
functional surfaces for juice contact are stainless steel, HMD
polypropelene and fiberglas, w/ wax being a functional coating for wood
surfaces that come into contact w/ the apples.   press racks are easily
made of HMD polyprop sheets, grooved 1/2 thru in opposite directions each
side.   oil of any kind will get eroded iinto the juice over time.   in
cases like the grinder drum being wood, it's most likely a hardwood [oak]
that isn't absorbant, so shouldn't be a problem w/ no finish - same for the
"staves" of a basket style press.   as for glues, I can't imagine any glue
standing up to the particular acidity of apple juice over long periods.  
the only type of paint that will survive for extended periods is the 2 part
epoxy finishes that are meant for metal.


don't be fooled by the term "food safe" w/ regard to the acidity of apples,
particularly the varieties most desireable for cider making - the
"authorities" who invented that concept think all apples are as low acid
as modern table apples.  make sure your equipment is of appropriate 
materials to start and don't worry about finishes!!

Hello Folks-


I am in the midst of researching a thesis topic related to a crucial aspect of 
quality cider production. I would be extremely grateful to hear from any 
interested parties on the subjects of:


1. Gauging apple maturity (by objective or subjective methods).
2. Storage practices ('sweating' or otherwise).
3. Determination of the optimal time for juice extraction. 


I have found only brief guidelines for these processes in the cider 
literature, most comprehensively from Ben Watson and Andrew Lea: Harvest when 
optimally mature, "use immediately" (Copas) or store under cover for a few 
days to a few weeks (depending upon cultivar), firmly pressing with thumb to 
determine when apples are ready to mill... 


The focus of my research is on the 'classic' cider apples of England such as 
Kingston Black, Dabinett, Stoke Red, and the like, but any and all 
observations or suggestions would be most welcome.

Subject: wood finishes and glues; orchard pests

I made my wooden apple grinder and press about 20 years ago. The grinder
cylinder is laminated ash, with an epoxy finish. As I recall, the epoxy
was from a fiberglassing kit. Other parts received Watco Danish Oil.
None of the parts are exposed to moisture for extended periods. Both the
epoxy and Danish Oil finishes have held up well, with no visible
loosening or flaking of the epoxy. 
 
These finishes were purported to be non-toxic once fully cured. Since
the juice remains in contact with the press parts for a relatively short
period, and since this is for personal use only, their reputation of
non-toxicity is, at this point anyway, sufficient for me. 
 
In my (tiny) orchard, I've had problems with various pests this year.
Deer:  a two-wire electric fence seems to be sufficient to keep a doe
and 2 fawns from turning my cider trees into bonsai. Crows: I've caught
them a number of times in late summer in the apple trees, knocking down
fruit, and pecking holes in hanging fruit.  Wasps and Hornets: These
guys just love that the crows break through the tough apple skin - the
wasps can hollow out an apple in just a few days. Codling Moths: With 8
weeks of high temps and no rain, the moths are just itching to propagate
an extra generation or two. 
 
Fun, eh?

Hi Drew:  I saw your letter in the Cider Digest requesting entries for
the North American Cider Competition.  I gathered from your letter that
this competition is only for commercial producers.  Have you considered
having an amateur competition also?  It is from the ranks of amateur
cider makers that the commercial producers of tomorrow will arise.
Today, there is not to my knowledge a good North American cider
competition for amateurs, only bits and pieces thru various groups like
the AHA (American Homebrewers Association) and Winemaker magazine.
Regards, Giles.

Robert:  I have keep high alcohol ciders like NE style for years with
only very slow deterioration.  I think your problem may be that there
was some bug in your cider at bottling.  You might try adding 1/4 tsp.
of metabisulfite at bottling to control these problems and stabilize the
cider.  Regards, Giles.
