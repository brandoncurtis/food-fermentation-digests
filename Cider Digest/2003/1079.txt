The orchards make their ciders with an eye towards fermentation, which
results in a nicely balanced, tangy sweet cider. They can be used as is or
fermented. We plan to have a listing of the apples that will be used posted
on  www.ciderday.org the last week of October, in the "Notes for Fermenters"
section on the schedule page.

I recently planted several malus coronaria in a native species land
restoration project. This is apparently one of the few (only?) native north
american apple species. Does anyone know its potential for use as a cider
apple?

This time I will take the role of the newbie, and get all gushy about the
apples I'm trying out.


We plucked the first few apples of our new cider collection.  These were
sourced from Lee Elliott down at Cider Hill.  Grown in SE Wisconsin, just at
the edge of the Lake Michigan influence.  I have a question about one of
them, I'd like some verification that it is what I think it is.


As I expected, our hot summer (relative to the English Channel) left most
varieties with only a hint of soft tannins.  Several with high billings in
the books were pretty bland.  But there's at least one really tasty one.


Domaine - sweet, densely fruity, noticable soft tannins
Major - sweet and boring (very conical, pink color, looks like a Chenango
Strawberry, without the green)
Crimson King - full sharp.  I'd eat this one any day.  Not crimson, but
several other varieites at our orchard are very bleached out this year, too.
Binet Blanc - sweet, boring if not for a hint of soft tannin.
Coat Jersey - conical, but not strected out in the 'sheepsnose' shape.  Very
striped, but so muted in color it comes across bownish-ugly.  Texture like
dense styrofoam - not actually edible.  Sweet, but powerfully tannic.  Hard
tannics - like dandelion milk.
Chisel Jersey - sweet, very perfumed, scent and flavor like a sweet resinous
wood.  Maybe a but citrusy, like broken lime leaves.  This is the one that I
wonder about the ID.  Morgan and Richards says conical.  Ours are fairly
oblate, dead solid red and have a pretty pink stain under the skin to about
.5cm.  Otherwise very creamy, fine grained, but dense flesh.  Does this
sound like Chisel to folks who have it?


I'm photographing our entire collection this year - about 140 varieties.
I'll get it posted to our website one of these days.

Something about this finally clicked in my head.  Why do you need rivets?
The typical tub or basket has a couple of metal hoops to which the wooden
staves are attached.  I gather that in your case they're attached with
rivets through the staves.  But why not attach them with screws instead?
You can get short pan-head stainless screws that drive through from the
outside of the hoops into the staves to hold them.  After all, you don't
need great strength in anchoring the staves, since the prevailing pressure
in operation already presses the staves against the hoops.


This also reminded me: Someone recently asked me why the staves on a basket
like that are tapered toward the outside.  That is, the outside of the
stave is narrower than the inside; you might almost think that the staves
were attached wrong-side-out.  But consider: if the press manages to force
pulp between the staves (if you're not using a press bag or if it's of less
than herculean strength) you don't want it to compress the pulp into the
gap between the staves.  Anything that gets into the gap should be able
to push free once it gets to the outside...keep the pulp from compressing
and keep the gaps open to let the juice out.
