I would vote for nylon screen as being both small pore and durable. My
stuff was not hardware window screen however. If you can find a store
that caters to camping and hiking, get the "no see um" ultra fine bug
net. It is tough; and designed to exclude the midges that see regular
mosquito net as a stunt flight obstacle. Throw in either the washing
machine or dishwasher to clean.

I ordered my Somerset Pomona in early September from The DoveCote Press in 
UK. No problem shipping to USA at printed-matter rate, no backorder. Arrived 
within a couple of weeks. Final charge on the MasterCard bill $20.84, which 
included book and shipping. Can't beat that. Great book for the apples of 
their interest. I've annotated my copy to note varieties available from 
Cummins Nursery and Nick Botner.

This may sound really weird but I found it by accident several years ago.... 
  I use swim suit liner for my press bags.  It's the white open weaved stuff 
normally found on the inside of a guy swim trunks.  A roommate stitched one 
for me in when I was in college and now my mother has made a number of them 
for my father as well as a number of other press owners.  It's very tough 
and stands up to years and years of being run thought the washer machine.  
It's not something that is found at the run of the mill fabic store but you 
can find it at a good outdoor fabic supply place.  Mine came from The Rain 
Shed  (541) 753-8900, 707 NW 11th St, Corvallis, OR 97330

In case anyone's interested, there seem to be a couple of copies of
Charley's classic 'Principles and Practice of Cider-Making' available
through www.bookfinder.com just at the moment, at around the $150 mark.
Type <cider-making> (be sure to include the hyphen) into the Title box.


This book is Charley's 1949 English translation of Warcollier's 'La
Cidrerie' from 1928.  Vernon Charley was head of the Long Ashton cider
section until the late 1940's when he left to set up the post-war
production of Carter's Ribena blackcurrant syrup at a new factory in
Coleford in Gloucestershire. Carter's was taken over by Beechams in the
50's and eventually became a part of the 'consumer healthcare' division
of the pharmaceutical multinational which is GSK.  The Coleford factory
is still a part of GSK, Ribena is still produced there, and the stone by
the entrance door is still the one laid by Charley with his name upon it.
