(If you're on the Mead-Lover's Digest you'll see this twice.  Same message)


If you decide to use a challenge-response mail filter (spam blocker), it is
YOUR responsibility to handle the unblocking.


(If you don't know what "challenge-response" means...)  This is a style of
mail protection in which an incoming mail message to you triggers an auto
response to the sender, asking the sender to do something special--send a
particular reply, go visit a web site and click on something, answer some
questions, that sort of thing--before any mail from the sender will be
delivered.  It's intended to block spammers who won't go through this
rigamarole.  (It mostly doesn't work, but that's an off-list topic.)


I will not work with challenge-response mailers.  Between the mead and cider
lists, there are over 1600 subscribers.  I cannot give personal service to
each one.  I also have to deal with my own spam problems at this end, and I
like to make cider and mead occasionally too!  Anyway, I am not about to go
romping about web sites, answering silly questions, and generally playing
games, to ensure that YOU can get the digest mail that YOU requested!


Note that this doesn't mean that you can't use challenge-response mail
protection!  It only means that YOU have to take care of unblocking or
white-listing (whatever you want to call it) the digest mail.  If I get
a challenge from your mailer, I will unsubscribe you and mark your address
as not to be resubscribed until I get an assurance that you've fixed the
problem.


If I seem grumpier than usual, it's because I am.  Nowadays, any fool can
write spam-blocking software; many fools are apparently trying to do so.


If you're concerned about this policy, or have questions, contact me OFF-
LIST(!); use cider-request@talisman.com (the admin address for the digest).

I think I have that one too.  This is the first year it fruited, and it 
produced a _very_ large, round, red-streaked over pale brown apple, with 
soft flesh and very little flavor.  It was mildly astringent and browned 
rapidly.  It also ripened early, falling off the tree near the end of 
September.  Disappointing.

G30 has done great for me on some varieties (King David and Brown's 
especially), very fast-growing and somewhat precocious.  Definitely use it 
instead of M7 if the option is available.  Roxbury Russets on MM106 have 
also been very precocious and productive; I have good loamy sand, so 106 
does well here.  MM111 makes a great tree but takes at least one or two 
extra years to produce.

I just noticed a new product for adding tannin.  It is made in France 
and is designed for use in fine winemaking.  One variety, Grap'Tan S,  
is extracted from the skins of grapes, not the seeds.  Grap'Tan V is 
condensed tannins (skins and seeds both i presume).  Grap'Tan PC is 
from the seeds.  This stuff sounds like a step above the usual tannin 
powder, which often has a bad flavor profile.  Has anyone used it?  I 
will be using it this year in my cider (still no European cider apples 
from my trees, so I make more faux European cider apples).


http://www.ferco-dev.com/home.htm -- the company making it, with 
descriptions under "products".

cellars, the only source of smaller quantities I could find in the US.

Having brewed beer and grown apples for eating and cooking for a number
of years, cider seems like the next adventure for me.


I live in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area - USDA Zone 4.  Winters here
are hard on fruit trees.  Our orchard is made up mostly of hardy
introductions from the University of Minnesota, a few old-time apples
from Russia, and some apples from Maine and the surrounding area that we
still consider experimental.  We have 40 fruit trees.


I'm looking for suggestions on hardy cultivars for cider and perry.

I'm looking to experiment with a long slow fermentation period (4-5 months)
this winter by maintaining a low temperature (approx 45 F) in the cidery
(aka the garage). I'd like to experiment with natural yeasts and several
cultivated yeasts. So far, I've settled on a champagne yeast and an English
cider yeast. Any suggestions for other cultivated yeasts? I'm curious about
a strain used for a Riesling-style white wine that is supposed to tolerate
temperatures as low as 40 F. Any comments and/or suggestions would be
greatly appreciated.
