Subject: Rotten Egg Aromatics - Wild Ferment

My apple juice took off on its own after 24 to 48 hours at 70 F with an 
airlock in place.  I did not pitch cultured yeast.


I had added 1/4 teaspoon potassium meta to my carboy right before it was
filled from a local orchard's press.  Original gravity was 1.054.  I don't
know the pH or TA.  I added no yeast nutrients/micronutrient.


I think I know the answer to my question but would like experienced 
cidermakers to confirm.  It smells of hydrogen sulphide/rotten eggs.  Should
I assume the bad yeast and bacteria took over the ferment?  Is it a lost
cause at 14 days into the ferment?


Also, is there a minimum original gravity I/we should aim for with 100% apple 
juice?


Thanks,

When you see the first mold spots.  The sulfite should prevent that, by 
making oxygen unavailable, especially if you added it after putting the 
cider into the carboy.  If the sulfite concentration is just right, the 
cider should clear after a couple of weeks.  If that happens, rack the 
cleared juice off the sludge before fermentation starts, and you can get a 
nice slow ferment.


It took almost a month for fermentation to start in my cider last spring, 
and even when it did the rate was very slow.  It stopped when off-dry, at 
about SG 1.01, but then restarted in the bottle.  The resulting cider was 
very nice.


If mold spots develop before fermentation starts, rack the cider (the mold 
should stick to the inside of the carboy) and add more sulfite, or give up 
and pitch yeast.  But you have to catch it before the mold growth goes too 
far, or it will ruin the cider.  For me, this is the main reason to use 
sulfite: it suppresses mold growth long enough for the yeast to become 
active.  This is also the reason to be careful with sulfite dosage: I don't 
want to suppress the wild yeast, just the mold and bacteria.


Did you press your own juice, or get it from a mill?  Juice from a cider 
mill should have a large yeast population and start fairly quickly; but if 
you pressed it yourself, your equipment won't have much of a culture built 
up, and you only get the yeast that is on the apples - a pretty small 
population.  Takes it a while to get going.  At least, that's been my 
experience.

Well it depends on the temperature and the pH of the juice and the 
initial yeast load.  But it might take as long as 3 weeks before 
anything happens.  So long as the juice remains under an airlock, the 
effect of the sulphite *should* be that mould does not grow in this time 
as the yeasts slowly multiply!


Good luck!

        Ira froze fresh cider in plastic milk jugs for later use, I do
the same with no leakage or breakage. Perhaps he did not leave  enough
air space at the top or it's possible the jugs were exposed to ultra
violet rays from the sun and were somewhat brittle. I have some frozen
cider over two years old and it's still pretty good, however after about
six months the aromatics noticeably start to dissipate and after a year
are all but gone yet the cider is still sweet and drinkable and I did
ferment ten gallons and it turned out just fine. As reported before in
this forum, the aromatics are lost in the fermentation process so losing
aromatics in freezing for long period of time shouldn't make any
difference.

There are at least two reasons why your wild yeast fermentation is slow
getting started.  The first is that you added sulfite to your cider.
Wild yeasts are not adapted to sulfite as are cultured yeasts.  Whenever
I do a wild yeast fermentation, I always leave out sulfite.  Another
potential problem is that wild yeast can be slow getting started.  You
could wait longer to see if your fermentation starts or you could pitch
a cultured yeast into your fermenter, which is what I would probably
do.  Next time, don't sulfite your wild yeast fermentations.

Jen asked about wild yeast fermentations.


Jen,


I'm not sure why you sulfited the juice. That inhibits
the 'early' yeasts and allows only Saccharomyces to
grow. Depending on the conditions (temperature is
really important) it can take a week. Make sure you
discourage mold growth by stirring daily, keeping the
insides of the fermenter clean, and maybe blowing some
CO2 on it. My fermentations usually start in 3-4 days,
but I don't sulfite. Other yeasts  (Klebs, Kloeckera,
whatever) probably dominate my ferments for the first
but, until the alcohol and Saccharomyces take over.


I also make wine this way. If it doesn't start and I
get too nervous, I rack something out of secondary and
pitch that. Is your pH ok? I get fast starts at 4.0
but much slower as the pH goes down.

Thanks to everyone who answered my question on Sturmers.


Three questions: firstly, I made some cider 6 months ago (in the Aussie 
Autumn/Fall), but didn't measure the OG of it. Is there a kind of "average" 
original gravity (OG) of apple juice? I suppose it varies somewhat with 
varieties, but how much? I used Sturmers, with ~5% dark red crab-apples 
(dunno what they're called) in a few batches.


Secondly, what does malo-lactic fermentation do to the favour of cider? 
Some of my batches have been a little too acidic (compounded because they 
were also quite dry) and I'm wondering if this secondary fermentation will 
reduce the acidity? How long would M/L fermentation take (for example, in 
one batch which used wild yeasts and was completely untreated)?


Lastly, what are some of the ways to make sweet cider? I ignorantly thought 
adding heaps of sugar would a good idea once- luckily I'd bottled in 
unbreakable champagne bottles, but it painted the roof once the cork was 
off! Anyone have sensible methods?

For Immediate Release




Seattle, November 8, 2003: The Northwest Cider Society has recognized six 
American and Canadian cidermakers as award winners in its First North 
American Cider Competition.
The competition was the first of its kind in North America, treating cider 
as a distinct category, judged by cider specialists, rather than an 
extension of a beer or wine competition. All of the winners are small 
"artisan" cideries, who produce their ciders from fresh fruit.
The judges tasted a total of 30 ciders made by producers across the United 
States and Canada. The award winners include:
Gold Medals:
Merridale Traditional Cider, made by Merridale Ciderworks of Cobble Hill 
British Columbia, Canada
Oliver Beanblossom Hard Cider made by Oliver Winery of Bloomington, Indiana
Westcott Bay Vintage Cider, made by Westcott Bay Orchards of Friday Harbor, 
Washington
Silver Medal:
White Oak Traditional English Style Cider, made by White Oak Cider of 
Newberg, Oregon
Bronze Medal:
Rhyne French Style Sparkling Hard Cyder, made by Rhyne Cyder of Sonoma, 
California
Certificates of Commendation:
Irvine's Vintage Blend, made by Irvine's Vintage Cider made by Irvine's 
Vintage Cider of Vashon, Washington
Merridale Cidre Normandie, made by Merridale Ciderworks of Cobble Hill, 
British Columbia, Canada
Merridale Cyser Cider, made by Merridale Ciderworks of Cobble Hill, British 
Columbia, Canada


The competition's judges were Peter Mitchell of Worcester, England, a cider 
production consultant and trainer; Dick Dunn of Hygiene, Colorado, an 
amateur cidermaker and organizer of the international "Cider Digest" online 
community; and Jon Rowley of Seattle, a food and beverage consultant.

Excellent reference and nice brief history of cider making in that area.

I'm not much more experienced, but I let one go for almost a month last 
year before it took off naturally.  I had to remove a bit of mold at 
one point from the top.  This year I am still waiting for bubbles, and 
I expect I may wait a long time, because we had some fresh juice from 
the same pressing in the fridge, and it didn't have any fizz to it 
several weeks later.  I laid some CO2 on the top of the vat to minimize 
oxygen contamination.


One thing I did unusually this year was to cut out all the bad bits of 
the apples quite carefully.  I wonder if I was perhaps a bit *too* 
careful and cut out all the lovely fermenting bits, too.  What happened 
was my daughters were putting the apples in the grinder, and I had some 
time to kill while they were doing it so I was doing a real nice job 
cutting out the bad-looking bits.


I also am fermenting grapes for the first time this year, and the 
grapes were not picked over too carefully before stem/crush so plenty 
of "bad" fruit got in.  They immediately took off in a strong natural 
fermentation: from start to dryness took five days.
