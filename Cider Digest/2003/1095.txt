Terry ... that's a beautiful piece of equipment for sure but my immediate
reaction is that I see no specifications for the amount of pressure
'supported' in a bladder type press.  (I looked at them briefly myself).
The typical well pump produces 4 - 7 gal. / min so you can figure the
amount of water pressure. If you look in a brewing supply store most of the
'wine presses' will have a disclaimer "not for use with apples" because a
great deal more pressure is needed to extract apple juice from the chipped
up apples (pomace) than grape juice from grapes.   I'd certainly pose
the question to Dick Dunn and Andrew Lea as well since both are far more
knowledgeable on this than I am.  We threw up our hands on the matter and
are presently redesigning from the Canadian brochure, a six foot tall rack
and cloth press.  Dick Dunn will have the CAD drawings and .jpg capture
files from the CAD output  for it when we are through (as well as a picture
of the actual press we construct).

Terry asked about bladder vs rack and cloth presses . I have had both for 
several years and I find I go back to the rack and cloth these days..
I have a water pressure operated Italian bladder press I am very pleased 
with . It  holds about 66kg of fruit and produces 38L of juice which I 
calculate to be about 57% effciency . It works very quickly with about 
fifteen minutes from loading to most of the juice pressed out . It is easy 
to clean and easy to set up .I actually found myself surprised this year 
that I went back to rack and cloth .
The main reason for going back was that I do fairly small amounts of fruit 
and try to keep track of varietals . The bladder press requires a full load 
and I found myself unwilling to bring it out for a small or partial load . 
The rack and cloth is more flexible and will do any size of load . The 
bladder press is awkward to unload , particularly if you are going for 
second run .
Otherwise , they are comparable . The bladder press requires a cloth also 
since the screen is designed for grapes and apple pulp leaks through . The 
juice from both is clean and pulp free .Speed is about the same .
If I was starting again , the cost of a bladder press vs a simple rack and 
frame would put me off .And ,if I were to build my own rack and frame I 
could make it to a size suitable for my fruit production .
On the other hand if I had large runs of fruit and had help I would use the 
bladder press for its simple and quick operation .
              On another topic , could I draw Alistair's attention to 
Merridale's (Cobble Hill) recent success in the Pacific Northwest Cider 
Competition . Check out the apples Merridale are growing . I believe they 
are a major factor in the production of good cider .

Yes I've done this on a small 'kitchen scale'.  (You can also do a
genuine secondary yeast fermentation in the pressure vessel). The
problem is that you lose quite a bit of CO2 as you bottle and it tends
to fob out of the bottles.  Best results are achieved if you can cool
the whole pressure vessel to just above freezing to keep as much of the
CO2 in solution as possible.  However you do it, it's quite messy unless
you can do counterpressure filling as is of course done commercially
(not easy at home!).  Perhaps someone has managed to streamline it for
home use?

Peter Johnson asked about kegging cider...


I have a good success for the last 3 years kegging a good portion of my
cider. I use pop kegs (Cornelius/Firestone) kegs which are approx. 17 imp
gallons capacity. I found one of them by the side of the road (honestly! was
missing lid though) and the other I got from the local Pepsi bottling plant.
The CO2 tank was rented from Pepsi also, paid a deposit and get a refill for
around Ca$20.


The guys at Pepsi were very helpful, bought a refurbished keg and
replacement parts (lid, poppet valves etc).


I had a surplus 2 stage CO2 reg already, this is an expensive part.


I have tried both kegging with some priming (glucose) and just CO2
overpressure alone. Using CO2 alone seems to work just as well.


I have read, a lot of info on temp, CO2 pressure, and the resultant degree
of carbonation and I do try and follow instructions, but often I do a quick
carbonation to get some drinkable stuff. In those cases I transfer some
clear cider from carboy to keg (and BTW, having a CO2 supply is great for
purging air from a "not quite as full anymore" carboy), purging the
remaining air with CO2, and then over-pressuring to about 60psi. That
pressure soon drops (a few hours) as the CO2 is dissolved. Shaking the keg
helps. Then I try and maintain around 25-30 psi to create a sparkling cider.
I find with my variety of cider, a good sparkle tastes better than a more
moderate one.


Anyway, I dispense with a home made tap (lab tubing then a stainless ball
valve and a bit of bent stainless tubing). One can find proper taps at home
brew shops. Dispensing pressures can be lower than carbonation pressures,
say around 15 psi or even lower. The cider foams a bit but settles down
quickly, its not like Guinness!


I think its a great way to dispense cider.


Then again one can make a "counter pressure filling" apparatus to dispense
the carbonated cider into bottles. There is lots of info on the web
describing this for beer. I have yet to try it. I find, for whatever reason,
my primed champagne bottled cider clears up well and the yeast sediments do
not stir up upon opening.

I usually carbonate my cider by kegging it. I find that my cider
ferments out too dry for me, so I put 4 gallons of fermented cider
with one gallon of fresh unfermented cider into a keg and carbonate
it. This adds back some sweetness and apple character to the dry
cider. If you keg it, you don't worry about a fermentation starting
again -- just blow off the pressure.


This may be unorthodox but it works well for me...


Cheers,

In CD#1094, Terry asked about using bladder presses for cider.


I'm interested if anyone has any experience trying this.  The models I have
seen typically have a maximum pressure of about 40 psig.  I just did some
figuring, and find that the rack and cloth presses I've used (and built in
one case) run about 80-100 psig.  So I would be concerned about low yield
from a bladder press. (I'm used to 3.5 to 4 gal/bushel for apples)


Those numbers (if at all accurate) tend to support what I've heard about
using rack and cloth presses with things like cherries and grapes - it's way
too easy to over press berries and stone fruit. You end up getting a _lot_
of fine sediment that you then need another way to remove.

One thing to remember when carbonating your cider is to keep it cold, this
keeps the CO2 from boiling off as a gas. It also make bottling easier since
you do not have to deal with a lot of foamy cider. Low 30's seems to work.
