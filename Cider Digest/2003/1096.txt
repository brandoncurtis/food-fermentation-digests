Thanks all for the input.  I am still planning on the rack and cloth, 
especially since I already have racks and cloths to use.  That bladder 
press looks easy, but I was having trouble imagining it working with a 
partial load, as well as how I would dump the pummy. My plan for the r&c 
press is to get ahold of a 20-ton shop press and make a press bed on it.  I 
may use a second pneumatic jack for extra stroke length and speed of 
operation.  I expect I'll chop my 28 inch racks down to 22 or 24.  The 
eventual plan is to make two moveable press beds on casters so that I can 
work on one cheese stack while squeezing the other.  I would like the final 
beds to be stainless, too, but for the first season I'll go with a wood 
box.  I remember reading here (from Andrew Lea?) of a recommended rack 
pressure of 50-100 psi.  I have been basing my press rating and rack size 
on that number.

I can't really say that I use 'corny' kegs specifically for carbonating, 
but they work for that and are an indispensable tool for my needs.  I 
picked up a kegging system a couple of years ago to serve beer at my 
wedding party.  I sprang for the tank, regulator, and two kegs.  At the 
time I was working at a bar and the owner started kicking me a soda keg 
every week or two and by the wedding I was up to six. We served four beers 
and two ciders and had a helluva time, but I digress.


Since then, I have collected fourteen of them.  I use them for transporting 
sweet cider from the mill, as they do not break like carboys.  I use them 
for secondary, especially when fermenting in plastic.  The main reason I 
acquired so many was to rack off a 55 gallon barrel.  I also use them for 
bulk ageing, as well as serving.  I don't intentionally carbonate but I 
apply 10-20 psi to seal the lid, then bleed off.  When on tap, I use a 
shutoff to keep pressure out of the system unless I'm pouring.  The cider 
does pick up a little sparkle, but not much.  I haven't made the push to a 
nitro system.


Kegs can also be used to filter in a closed system.  Two kegs can be daisy 
chained by connecting the 'out' tube to the 'in' tube of a second keg with 
a canister filter between the two.  The second keg is pressurized (say at 
30 psi) before connecting the two together.  Then the first keg is 
pressurized at 15 psi.  CO2 can then be bled out of the receiving keg until 
the flow starts...this is basically a counterpressure system.  If multiple 
filters are used I could even see it possible to make a naturally sweet, 
sparkling cider this way...Maybe I'll try it this year.


I guess my point is, whether or not you'll be using them for force 
carbonation,  fve-gallon soda kegs are a wonderful all-around tool in the 
cidery.

I use a bladder press for both grapes and apples.  The important technical
factor is the psi that the press will tolerate.  Mine operates at 40 psi
which is tremendous pressure.  It is very effective and simple to use.

I can see from the archives that this question has been banged around
before, a couple hundred Digests ago, but I'd like to revisit it.  I'm
giving a presentation at an upcoming conference, and am bound to get asked
about it.


What distinction do we cidrephiles (both producers and enjoyers) make
between cider and apple wine?
Merely degree of chaptalization? (Cider being none to ~8% ABV, Apple wine
being 10+% ABV)
What about some kind of character distinction?


My own cider is in the slightly chaptalized category. I do label as a
sparkling apple wine, because my method is so labor intensive that I'm
looking for a higher price point - and (sadly) I don't think the word
'cider' has the reputation. Yet!  But that's the only reason for the wine
designation.  I call it cider, or cidre otherwise.


To me, the distinction, if only based on degree of chaptalization, is
arbitrary.


I like to think of ciders as being distinct in being light, crisp, and
having a distinct tannin character (ML modified, or not) - and 'apple wine'
as being heavier, more muted, and trying to be something more like a
Reisling than aiming to stake out a unique place.


Other thoughts?

I had done some measurements and figuring a while back.  A typical basket
screw press (HVR, Jaffrey, etc.) will give you between 40 and 60 psi on the
fruit.  Keep in mind that the larger the press area (cross-section of the
plate being driven downward), the less pressure on the fruit for the same
amount of leaning on the pole you use to turn the screw.


Following are some notes based on various poking-around, asking questions,
thinking about press designs.


Yes, you can design for higher pressure, but from what I can tell, you
don't gain a lot over 60 psi or so...at least, not unless the rest of the
press design creates good channels for the juice to get out.  Long before
you get to higher pressures, the issues will be quality of the milling and
distance the juice has to travel to escape.  The latter factor is why a
rack-and-cloth press has it all over a basket press arrangement.


As for water-pressure-driven bladder presses:  Typical home water pressure
(and you can get this from a well pump) will be in the 40-60 psi range.
That just happens to be a convenient range for water out of the tap:  below
that and it's too slow; above that things start to spray and splatter and
fittings like to leak.  (Yes, I've seen home water pressure a lot higher
than 60 psi.  I've also seen aging copper supply pipe split along a seam!)


The interesting characteristic of a bladder press is that the size doesn't
matter to the pressure driving it; it just takes longer to "inflate" a
larger bladder.  There aren't any high working pressures in the system,
unlike a hydraulic-cylinder arrangement.  (That's not to say that a
hydraulic system is a worry.  As long as it's made right, there's nothing
wrong with 2000 psi in the driving cylinder.)


John Campbell mentioned the press he's building.  He and I had talked off-
digest about this; perhaps it's worth my trying to reconstruct some of the
thoughts (and John can fill in the good stuff I'll surely forget).  If you
are contemplating a rack-and-cloth setup driven by a hydraulic cylinder or
a bottle jack (very cheap but effective!), here are some considerations:
  * Pressure on the fruit is system force divided by area of a rack.
    So for example a 10-ton bottle jack and 15-inch-square racks gives a
    little under 90 psi.  An active hydraulic system you'd figure just
    the way you expect: use cylinder bore to get cross-section, times
    working pressure to get total.
  * This says you can't use racks with huge surface area or you don't have
    enough pressure.  Large racks also require more strength in the press
    plate and the bed of the press, to keep these from deforming.  I've
    been impressed (negatively) at how much the bed of my little basket
    press deforms.  I've also noted that the beds of some English presses
    I've seen are made of stone (looked like granite if I recall, tho that
    doesn't sound quite right) and were several inches thick!
  * You can build the cheese taller by adding more layers of racks/cloths,
    and as long you don't make the layers thicker, it won't affect the
    efficiency:  What matters is being able to get the juice out from the
    center of a layer.  This is determined by the thickness of the layer
    and the effectiveness of channels for the juice.
  * One counter-argument to adding more layers is that as the cheese gets
    taller relative to width, it becomes less stable.  Particularly if you
    are pressing dessert/eating apples and/or very ripe (somewhat mushy)
    apples, and especially if you're insane enough to press dessert pears,
    this risks the cheese slipping and blowing out to the side.  Skill
    in building the cheese would help here, but won't solve the problem
    entirely.
  * Another problem with a tall cheese is the travel on the cylinder or
    jack that powers the press.  Don't hand-wave this problem by thinking
    that you will only compress the cheese to half (or some magic number
    like 37%) of its starting height, and that this will allow you to use
    a shorter-travel cylinder.  Think instead about what happens when you
    only have 1/3 of a press-load but it's your precious Kingston Blacks
    where you want every last drop of juice...but you realize that you
    can't drive the press plate down far enough to finish the pressing!
