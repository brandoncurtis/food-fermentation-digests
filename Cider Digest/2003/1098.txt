No, not missing anything.  You've stated the problem better (in more
generality) than I did, and you've solved it!  My point was that you do
need to have a way to press a partial load.  The cribbing does it as well
as extended travel on the cylinder, but either way it's a good idea to have
anticipated the problem...instead of scurrying around at the end of a
pressing session (which, for me at least, too often tends to be near
dusk!), trying to figure out what you can use that will fit in the press,
hold up under pressure and distribute the pressure properly, etc.  Perhaps
other folks are better at innovation on-the-spot than I am, but finding an
unanticipated problem like this tends to turn into an "OH $#!+" moment for
me.

Cider Gurus,


  I just tasted my cider after 3 1/2 weeks.  It was great!  It was dry, 
slightly fruity and tasted like......Chardonay?  My question is this do I
call it a day and bottle faux chardonay or should I try to enhance the apple
flavor, and with what?  Citric Acid...Fresh apple juice?

Greetings All- I've only encountered white oak  used in press racks. Is
this THE "weapon of choice" for wood racks? I'm assuming certain
properties are desirable (pliability, durability, etc.). Beavers have
offered up a nice looking sawlog of black gum (tupelo) ,so I would
appreciate any input.
Thanks, Evan
