Can anyone tell me what the optimum mesh size is for pressing?   I have
been experimenting  with different mesh.  I went to the local fabric
store and bought some fine nylon drapery material; it worked great and I
got more juice than I did using happey valley ranch's pressing bags. 
Additionally- it was much easier to get the pressure plate out when I
was done pressing.  Does anyone have any suggestions to more easily
remove the pressure plate after a pressing?   I have found when I really
try to get every last drop out- the fabric or press bag  starts popping
up and around the pressure plate- making it very difficult to extract
the plate later?  Should I give up earlier in the pressing to avoid this
problem?  Should I make a larger press plate so it cannot get by the
pomace filter?  Any input/ solutions would be apppreciated.

If all you're looking for is racks for between the cheeses of a
rack-and-cloth type press, I don't think there's any particular worry,
except to be sure you don't have a wood that's naturally toxic or
"flavored" (pine comes to mind). I use Douglas Fir in mine, as it's
local and cheap. Strength is not an issue. Cost/neutrality/ease of
cleaning I think are the only issues. If you need a rack for underneath
the cheeses, depending on the design of your press, strength may also be
an issue (in the one I use, the bottom rack is fully supported by a
tray, so it isn't).

If I understand the problem correctly,you are at the end of pressing and
you have say only 1/3 of a press to squeeze,leave 2/3 of the PREVIOUS
press on to be squeezed again.               Skip SO.  Grand Rapids MI

Aaahh, December: the cider is in the carboys, safe and sound, the press 
is cleaned and put away, what more does a cider maker have to do?  
Well, remove the labels off of 300 wine bottles, for one thing.  Is 
there a trick to doing this neatly and /or quickly?  Any suggestions 
welcomed!

I went to a brew shop we get yeast and demijohns from in Columbia, Md. this
morning and they showed me an apple grinder from gwkent  The aluminum
grinder threw me off (and the flywheel at least in the illustration looks
"rinky-dink") but the rest of the apparatus looked interesting ... has
anyone used one or seen one in operation?
