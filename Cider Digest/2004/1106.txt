Hello Mark,


I don't know what your specific situation is, but if your problem is finding
adequate water for the irrigation, and your orchard is in near proximity to
your home, have you considered irrigating with Grey Water from your home?
Black waste water is what you flush, and what comes from the kitchen sink
and dishwasher but everything else in your home is called grey water, is
mostly non-toxic and useable for irrigation.  You would need to re-plumb
your sinks and such to drain to your orchard instead of the serer/septic.
It would be a hassle, but it is a solution; all those gallons of water from
your sinks and showers get used for your trees instead of contributing to
the sewer/septic waste.


Here is one guy that uses his washing machine water:

You didn't say "girt" :)


Thanks for the references, I will chase them down. Henry's of Harcourt
rang a bell for some reason, so I must have discovered then lost that
info (the problems of having an alcoholic hobby). I feel embarrassed for
not guessing Sydney Cider's website :(


cheers,
Ross.

Regarding ciders in Oz, I would note:


1. Henry of Harcourt (Harcourt, near Bendigo Vic.) making
some very drinkable stuff on a smallish scale.  He does a
very good perry as well as ciders.


2. Kellybrook (Wonga Park - Yarra Valley) - mainly a winery but
does some rather pricey Kingston Black (Old Gold) cider, as well
as a good apple brandy.  Kellybrook also has an annual cider
festival around the first weekend in May - complete with Morris
dancers and "scrumpy", etc.


3. Thorogoods (Burra, South Australia) - I dont know their
stuff well - I'm still planning my trip there.

I make cider from our 2 acre orchard in Stoke Gabriel, South Devon which we
recently purchased. My first year's efforts made an excellent completely
natural cider and I now wish to experiment with sparkling cider in the
french bouche style. If anybody knows any good sources of information (in
english preferably!) this would be great. In particular:


When and how often do you need to rack to reduce the fermentation rate of a
keeving without stopping it?


I have read that bottling should be done between 1020 and 1010 - does anyone
know what the minimum sg is before you need to add sugar to get reasonable
bubbles?

I just noticed a newspaper coupon for Lysol brand cleaner with "Apple
Cleaning Action".  Will apple and apple scent be the new trend, the 
replacement for lemon-scented cleaners and polishes?  Are apples now
in the ascendancy?  Could this be the beginning of a new trend, one on
which interest in cider could ride the coat-tails?


(Or are we in for a decade of bad industrial imitations of apple scents
that will eventually nauseate everyone at the thought of anything apple?)


"Green Apple Breeze"(TM) Scent, with a Scratch'n'Sniff...if I smelled
anything like that coming off MY orchard, I'd call the sheriff and ask
for a bio-hazard team!


Gack.

I've had good success with Wyeast #3766, www.wyeastlab.com/wprlist.htm.
Most any homebrew store will have this or can order it for you.


Assuming the farm cider is not pasteurized, you may also want to try
a natural fermentation.  Put a couple gallons of cider into a carboy,
stick an airlock on it, and let it go.  I've even had pasteurized
cider ferment this way.  You may be pleasantly suprised by a good-
tasting cider, or you may have to pour it out.  But for me, the
experimentation is part of the fun of making cider.  Try many different
yeasts (champagne, ale, mead, lager, etc.) and see which ones give you
a flavor you enjoy drinking.
