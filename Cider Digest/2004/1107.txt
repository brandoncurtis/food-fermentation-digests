We have a great amount of japanese/asian pears that we have in our 
orchard, among other things. I was wondering
if anyone has tried to make a cider with this fruit, or has any recipies 
for doing such. We have about 3/4 an acre
orchard with kingston black, and liberty varities as well as king, 
golden delicious apples. We have took a liking to ciders over the past 
couple of years and have tried just about every type of locally produced 
ciders available. We also
took a vacation to bermuda recently and discovered a brittish cider 
called scrumpy jack which is a great dry cider.
Cannot find it stateside though. We have also live close to brittish 
columbia and have tried their varietys. Our next
step is to try tobrew our own cider. We have never done cider before so 
any advice is greatly welcomed.
thanks , Tom and Donna schoonover,
Sedro Woolley, WA

A friend of mine likes to point out how these days there is more lemon
juice in cleaning products than there is in commercially produced
lemonade. Are we going to be able to draw a comparison here with cider?

IIRC we've already had the apple freshness craze, back in the '70's. You
know, back when "God didn't make those little green apples" because it
was a laboratory produced ester added to soap, shampoo, dish washing
liquid, air freshener, etc.

Thanks, I now have a few good reasons for another tour of the south. I
must see if I can pick up a client in Melbourne this year :)


cheers,

Excluding deer & bear deterrents, the subject of pesticide use doesn't 
seem to arise here,
at least not frequently.


But, in my imagined "perfect world", all cider would be made from 
organic apples.
NO pesticides!   i wish.
Since it's unlikely that anyone aspiring to "Real Cider" would argue 
that pesticide residues
are a Required cider ingredient ... with my simple logic
 ... fewer pesticides used = lower pesticide residues
ergo, better cider.
here's an interesting approach to one pest problem ...


    Helping wasps help orchards:
Insect pests of orchards could face stiffer resistance thanks to wild 
roses and strawberries
- --and a harmless wasp. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2004/040107.htm
Look for a link (near the bottom) to a longer article in "Agricultural 
Research/" /magazine .
or click here http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan04/rose0104.htm


Do you suppose that rose hedges might help keep deer out as well?

I am seeking a great deal of info on non-irrigated or minimal irrigated
orcharding,


Mark: Im just back from 2 months in SA...observed a lot of dry-land
grape stuff. While that is not your topic, I note that the industry
leaders in this approach are using and studying the apparent dramatic
benefits of your natural grasses between rows in terms of how (example)
they impact water loss. Issues apparently relate (examples) to root
structures, capillary processes, which are (in their view) strikingly
different than the imported grasses.


That stands to reason, given your grasses had to evolve in climates that
are completely different than the Willamette Valley, Oregon (rain
citidel of the world) from where many "cover" grasses are now
(unfortunately) sourced.


These are the folks up out of the Barossa Valley in the hills to the
southwest. I spoke to one of their tech. consultants, and it gives one a
whole new world of consciousness as to the impacts of grass. These folks
are deadly serious about their craft, and one produces the second most
pricey bottle of wine in AU.


I have some names, if you want to touch base. I also note that the
"dry-land" concept now is being used as a pricing and marketing edge to
suggest both environmental consciousness and presumed enhanced taste
characteristics. I am uninformed of any natural laws that prevent
similar benefits applying to crops other than grapes.
