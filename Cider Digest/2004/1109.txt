I have a 4 acre block of apples on extremely wet clay.I planted it
because it has a high elevation as far as frost is concerned.The orchard
is 10 years old on MARK rootstock.I planted on a berm of 8 inches high
and 3 feet wide .The first 5 years went well.After that the berms seemed
to wear down and are now flat.I think 30% of the trees are dead.I think
most die from winter injury.Many of the trunks are winter
damaged.Research shows wet conditions weaken cold resistance.I think if
I keep the berm up with mulch and keep the trunks white with latex paint
I will be alright.Some of this might be because of the rootstock also.

Not sure if this is fermentable, or even legal, but there is an herb, 
Stevia rebaudiana, which produces a "natural" sweetener which is 
extremely sweet.  Many times that of sucrose.  I've tasted it before but 
not sure how it would fare in the low pH, alcoholic medium of cider.  As 
I understand it, you can buy it at health food stores and such in the US.

I'm glad Michael resurrected Jack's question. I've been puzzling over how to
get a semi-sweet sparkling cider too. From reading the archives, following
recent threads, and my first time experiences this winter, I gather it is
very difficult for the home cidermaker to eliminate all active yeasts.


I am attempting to stop one of my carboys at around 15sg. I cold racked it
this weekend for the fifth time and it still shows signs of slight
fermentation activity even packed in ice at 34F! Another carboy I've let go
to dryness and am now racking whenever the barometric pressure hits 1030mb.
My plan is to add sucrose at bottling time to 15sg and compare the tastes of
the "naturally" sweet cider with the "artificially" sweetened cider.


As for sparkle, I assume that despite all my rackings a slow fermentation
will continue in the bottle, and hope to be able to control its speed
through storage temperature. Just in case I am successful in shutting down
the yeast completely, I plan to inoculate some of the bottles with a
commercial malolactic bacterium to see if that will give me some sparkle. I
was wondering if anyone on the list has had success using a malolactic
fermentation to induce sparkle in the bottle?
