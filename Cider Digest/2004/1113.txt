Subject: Quality presses?
From: Nick Gunn <nnugkcin@yahoo.com>

I will be either building my own, buying new, or used
from ebay, some type of cider press that has an
accompanying grinder attachment. Lately, I have been
looking into the Happy Valley touble tub press and a
similar, but motor-driven Correll Cider press. Having
the double tub is not necessary but seems like it
would be pretty nice if you were working with a short
time frame to get your must into the fermenter. Does
anyone out there have any experience with either of
these presses or have any recommendations on other
models that would do the trick? I am most worried
about the efficiency factor of the grinder and press,
as I will be using a lot of dry, dense varieties that
can be a bit stingy with sharing their juice. General
build quality is also a concern as I would like to
make this investment last the long run. Any
information y'all might have would be much
appreciated.


Thanks,


Nick Gunn

Does anyone have or know of a source in the US for scions of cider
apples from Spain such as collaos, raxao, etc.
Also, anyone interested in learning about Spanish cider or sidra may
want to visit the English translated page of
http://www.sidradeasturias.es.

Couple of thoughts on this: 1) Might it not be safer to bring the
"stopped" carboy back up to 60F *before* bottling? Like maybe for a
week. If you really were successful, no problem. If you weren't, and
fermentation restarts, at least you're still set for it. I think this
because 2) if you *didn't* actually succeed in killing the yeast, and it
reactivates in the bottle--along with the ML--you have, shall we say, an
explosive situation on hand.


Actually that brings me to my third concern: If you *do* start getting
fructose refermentation after ML starts and you try to pasteurize it, I
don't think I want to be in the same kitchen with you. Heating it in the
bottle, closed, sufficiently to kill the yeast is also sufficient to
drive all the dissolved CO2 into gas form, creating one h... of a bomb.
What is it, scientists? Help me out here. Gay-Lussac's Gas Law, I think?


I use champagne bottles. Pretty strong. Used to know their rated
strength, new (my Dad did QC for a glass bottle manufacturer), which was
somewhere on the order of 2-3 atmospheres. But I expect you'd be able to
drive the punt end halfway through the wall with that amount of gas.

This seems wise.

I had planned on using champagne bottles for this experiment. Ive read that
champagne bottles can take up to 6 atmospheres. 15sg of sugar, fully
converted, could produce around 4 atmospheres. I have no idea how much
pressure the MLF might generate.

I think its the Ideal Gas Law, the relationship between temp, pressure and
volume.  With a fixed volume, a rise in temp must increase the pressure. I'm
beginning to imagine hot shards of flying glass...

This report includes assay results from the 2003 harvest and an
evaluation and ranking of ciders made from the 2002 harvest.
