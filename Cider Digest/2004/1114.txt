Based on my own experience and inspecting a wide variety of presses at the 
annual Steiliacoom (Washington) Apple Squeeze, the Correll press is the 
clear choice.


The build quality on the Correll is far superior to the Happy Valley. And 
the Correll's motorized grinder will consume fruit much faster and with 
less physical labor than the Happy Valley's hand crank grinder. The yield 
appears to be about the same.


The Steilacoom event is a community festival where about two dozen or more 
cider presses are set up in a vacant lot. Until the e.coli scare of a few 
years ago, people would bring their backyard fruit, and be assigned to a 
press where it would be converted to juice. More recently, the organizers 
sell bags of carefully washed fruit. The presses include Corrells, Happy 
Valleys, Garden Ways and some very impressive home-built hydraulic 
monsters, along with many different antique cider presses. So it's a great 
opportunity to see how well each type of press works, and how they 
compare.  Seeing the two presses next to each other, the motorized Correll 
is definitely the one to buy.

Great report!  Are the detailed notes on the cider production 
available?  How about the cultivar data (bloom & harvest dates, disease, 
vigor, habit, etc.)?  I would love to compare your findings with my own 
experience with some of these cultivars.  Perhaps a co-operative data 
exchange would be beneficial?

I own a Happy Valley Press and am happy with the quality and durability of
it.

    I'd suggest that a most important factor in obtaining a high yield
of juice is to break open the individual cells of the apple tissue. 
This is most thoroughly accomplished, not by chopping or slicing the
apple, but by shattering it with a hammermill.  In the food science
pilot plant at the Agricultural Experiment Station (Cornell U.) in
Geneva, NY we had such a machine.  It's hammers could be reversed on the
spindle to present either a sharp or blunt edge, and we customarily used
the latter to prepare the mash.  The rpm must be high to achieve the
required impact.  Bob LaBelle  r.labelle@verizon.net

Does anyone know of a source for scionwood from the Harrison apple?  If 
so, please let me know.  Thank you, Jason MacArthur

This line of intended action brings shivers to me spine!. EEEWWW There ain't
nothin worse mateys than some fool lets ML get goin in the bottle as it gives
off a terrible stink and the terible stinkin gets trapped in the bottle and
ew gosh almighty it'll send yee runnin to the sink ta pours it down the drain


Considered a faux paux


if ya wants ta go through malo check the malo package for ph, alchohol and
temperature requirements.  If you are in the range of ml bacteria survival
go ahead and introduce but keep the temps up and get it over with It will
taste scary during the ml ferment but don't worry the ml stink scrubs out
easily with a racking and a sulfite addition then bottle it


This si of course assuming you sulfited the press to kill the wild ml
bacteria

Reality is that which, when you stops believing in it, don't go away.

I've had a Happy Valley press for I think six years now.  It's really OK,
but only OK.  (Sounds like Lucy talking to Charlie Brown?)  I've put a few
tons of apples through it.  It's easy enough to use, but it's not very
efficient.  I figure "efficiency" in terms of juice out to apples in, by
weight, since that's easy.  The HVR press "as received" gave about 45%
yield, which is to say 9 lb of juice for every 20 lb of apples.  Not very
good.


I've seen the Correll presses but not used them.  They look very similar
to HVR, but sometimes the devil is indeed in the details.


The efficiency of a press like the HVR is severely limited.  There are two
limit points:  the quality of the grinding and the pressing in the basket.


On the latter: the problem is that the mass of pulp binds up; once you get
that 12" high 12" cylinder bound up, you can put extraordinary amounts of
pressure on it and nothing will happen.  The problem is that the juice just
can't get out, and the harder you push the more the juice is trapped.  This
is why a rack/cloth press works so much better:  there are channels for the
juice every couple inches.


On the former (quality of grind): the HVR is not particularly precise, and
the grinder is very aggressive.  The result is that the grinder tends to
pull large (flat) pieces of pulp through, and these exacerbate the problem
of the press mass binding up and not releasing juice.


I've done some modifications to the grinder which got the efficiency up to
55% or so.  The mods mainly had to do with increasing the precision so that
the grinder wouldn't grab large flat slabs of apple and pull them through.
I'm still working on this angle, but I'm also looking at converting the
press part of the HVR to rack-and-cloth.  If anyone's done that, I really
wish you'd speak up!!


One of the points that will help, aside from other factors, is running the
grinder faster.  A less-aggressive grinder running faster will give you a
nicer pulp and won't tend to grab apples at the end.  This certainly argues
for a motorized grinder--which the Correll has and the HVR can have.

Yes - it's the Ideal Gas Law - PV=nRT.  Or PV~nT to get rid of that pesky
fudge factor that makes all the units match.  So pressure and volume are
proportional to moles of gas and temperature.  Chemists are prone to
examining every thing like an ideal gas - even Heaven and Hell.


But as for MLF, malic acid is a 4 carbon acid, and lactic acid is a 3 carbon
- - so you're only going to get 1 mole of carbon for each mole of malic acid -
about 1/4 of the about of malic acid in general terms.  More over, there's
only a few tenths of a percent of malic acid in cider - unless you're
running straight crab apples.  So say 5-6 g/L malic acid - that's about 1.5
g/L CO2.  That's well under the 3.9 g/L required in order to put 'sparkling'
on a label regulated by the ATF.


I aim for 10g/L CO2 in my champagne style cider. That's about 5 bar.  The
dosage is 20g/L sugar (since you get 1/2 yield of CO2, compared to the 1/4
for MLF).  Much bigger bang for the buck.  Hmmm... I guess we all want to
avoid the 'bang' part - flying glass, spilled cider - all types of hazards
to body and soul.


My supplier says that the W106 type champagne bottle is rated for 7 bar.
Wow.

Nick Gunn asks about presses - I had an old Happy Valley Ranch press for
long enough to "restore" it, and display it for a season
<http://mars.ark.com/~squeeze/pics-pg/chidleys.html> and can say that they
are good quality, and according to the previous owner, who used it for
years, it works great - the usefullness of the double basket isn't for "a
short time frame", rather it allows you to keep busy while the pressing is
done slowly [tighten, let drip, tighten, let drip, repeat, repeat!], which
is necessary w/ a ACME screw [as opposed to hydraulic] - the Correll press
looks quite the same, and I can't see the real need to have a motor driven
'grinder', as the flywheel-like hand crank on the HVR works great w/ little
effort and probably wouldn't be much, if any, slower.


If you've got the time and skills [and the need], the government designed
press and chopper on my website using a hydraulic jack is excellent.
<http://mars.ark.com/~squeeze/ag-can/ag-book.htm#5>


A while back, Dick suggested I write a bit for the digest on pressing, and
we're into the season I can come up w/ the time for that, so I should,
having many years experience on different equipment - now I've said it, 
maybe I'll feel compelled to do it!!
