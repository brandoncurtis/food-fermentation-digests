I (like Dick Dunn) have to get "serious" about my press this year as my
orchard is close to production levels. Sixty gallons "the hard way" this year
was a painful experience.  I agree with "squeeze" regarding the Canadian
brochure design of the "Cheese press". and Andrew Lea weighed in on this
issue for me off line from the UK cider board and raised the comparative
analysis of the sheer volume of juice produced by a "cheese type press" as
opposed to presses like the "Happy Valley" press which is a duplicate of the
Hocking Valley Press made in and around the turn of the 1800's to 1900's.
I'm building a variation on the Canadian design and stirring in some of
the concepts in the rather massive (and expensive) Oesco production press,
and will report on my progress and outcome but the issue of the grinder is
a weighty one to say the least.  As I raised the issue before (apologies)
has no one had any experience with the GW Kent apple crusher? Or even
some opinions regarding it's potential?  I don't care for the rollers
(being aluminum) but it is a double roller situation and the rest of the
unit is stainless steel.  So I'll suggest again take a look at the page
http://www.gwkent.com/GWKent2003.pdf and search for "apple crusher".

Jason MacArthur asks about sources for the Harrison apple.


I had the opportunity to sample the Harrison for the first time this 
past November in Virginia. Tom Burford rediscovered Harrison after a 
long search, being grown by a fellow in New Jersey (appropriate, since 
Harrison is associated with Essex Co., NJ -- historically, an important 
cider and apple region)


The apple is small, flattish, yellow with prominent black specks, 
rather dry, and high-flavored. It's a late apple, but this was late 
November, and the fruits I had were not at their peak. But you could 
definitely get the sense that this apple "explodes" in the mouth at its 
best, sort of like a good Spitzenburg or Newtown Pippin. I can see why 
it would make a good cider apple. Historically, it was used along with 
Graniwinkle, an indifferent eating apple, to make an almost legendary 
cider. If you make cider with those two apples, please invite Tom and 
myself.


Harrison is currently being grown by several orchardists in Virginia, 
and that is probably the best place to look for scionwood. I would 
email Tom Burford or Charlotte Shelton at Vintage Virginia Apples in 
North Garden, VA (Jason, I can give you their addresses off-list if you 
contact me).


As far as commercial sources go, the Fruit, Berry & Nut Inventory, 3rd 
Ed. (2001) lists two: Cider Hill Nursery in Winchester, IL (which I 
thought I heard has gone out of business?), and Orchard Lane Growers in 
Gloucester, VA.

Well I must admit that hasn't been my experience using a Lallemand 
culture, nor when I've let a 'wild' MLF take place (which is the usual 
course of events around here anyway).  I'm not saying that taints don't 
  happen, only that it isn't always quite that bad!  I wonder if Larry 
is very sensitive to diacetyl (the buttery Chardonnay note) which is a 
well-known MLF product.  I personally am almost odour-blind to diacetyl 
(as I know from early years when we were developing the Long Ashton 
sensory panel) - I recognise 'buttery' but I suspect my perception of it 
is not the same as other people's.

Spot on.  Another point to bear in mind (and why the Ideal Gas Law is 
only an approximation since it does not allow for gas solubility in 
liquids) is that the saturation solubility of CO2 in water (cider) is 
about 1.9 grams per litre at 60F (15 C).  So you don't have as much CO2 
available as gas as you thought you did (depending on how close to 
saturation the cider already is due to action of the yeast) - much will 
be in true solution and not available to form bubbles.  In practice that 
is why MLF only gives a light 'spritzig' character to a cider and never 
a champagne style effervescence.


Mind you, that's no bad thing.  IMHO, all good ciders should be 
saturated with CO2, with maybe just a little over to give a few bubbles. 
  Exam question  - CO2 is probably the most misunderestimated component 
of cider and wine flavour - discuss!

In Cider Digest #1114, Dick Dunn wrote... " The efficiency of a press
like the HVR is severely limited.  There are two limit points:  the
quality of the grinding and the pressing in the basket.  On the latter:
the problem is that the mass of pulp binds up; once you get that 12"
high 12" cylinder bound up, you can put extraordinary amounts of
pressure on it and nothing will happen.  The problem is that the juice
just can't get out, and the harder you push the more the juice is
trapped.  This is why a rack/cloth press works so much better:  there
are channels for the juice every couple inches."


I might be flaunting my ignorance since I don't actually press my own
apples but an idea just came to mind regarding the pulp binding issue
you mentioned. I assume that the HPV press uses a filter bag inside of
the press basket similar to the Correll cider press.  Why not obtain
some suitable fabric and improvise a cheese inside of the filter bag?  I
envision the cheese fabric would be about as wide as the diameter of the
press basket and approx. 10 feet long.  To start, one end of the cheese
fabric would be draped across the floor of the filter bag.  A 2-inch
layer of apple pomace would then be placed upon it.  Next, the cheese
fabric would be folded back across the pomace layer and another 2-inch
layer of pomace would be placed on top of it.  The process of placing
2-inch pomace layers separated by cheese fabric folded accordian-style
would be repeated until you reach the top of the press basket.  The
cheese fabric layers would allow the extracted juice to drain outward
more efficiently from the pomace into the filter bag and subsequently
increase your juice recovery.  The one-piece cheese fabric should also
be easy to cleanup and reuse too!  Hey, looks good on paper...

Reynold

        I think champagne bottles can withstand up to 6 ATM of pressure,
but you'll have to check that yourself.  Bill Rhyne and I have talked
about the in bottle pastuerization they have done.  The archive should
have it somewhere.  I remember that some bottles are lost, but it is
a small precentage.  Also, the water bath helps cushion the
explosion.  Still, it isn't safe if the proper precautions aren't
followed.  I'd read up on it before making an attempt.  Also, if you
let the cider ferment to dryness and settle out the yeast,
pasteurization will be more effective as there will be less yeast
in the bottle that need killing.  If your cold ferment has just stalled,
but has many viable yeast in suspension, pastuerization might not work as
well.
