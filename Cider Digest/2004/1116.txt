Mr. Dunn,


Before I post a message regarding this I wanted to
know if sharing scion wood using the Digest is an
appropriate use of this forum.


Thanks,


Mike Camp

I'd like the collective's opinions on the following commercial ciders:


Bellot
Etienne Dupont 2002 (Cidre Bouche Brut de Normandie)
Blackthorn


A local store is selling these three and I have had the first two. Are 
these considered good, average, or horrible ciders? Are they regarded as 
decent French ciders?


I've also come across a few sites claiming that Blackthorn is a British 
alcopop. Can anyone confirm this?


Looking forward to your responses,
Robert Sandefer

Yes.  They're essentially the same design.

I considered something like this but rejected it.
The problem I see is that this only gives you half of the "rack-and-cloth"
design--no racks.  I think you might get some improvement if you could find
the heavy press cloth material, but I think it would be slight.  Granted,
I haven't tried it and I should; it would be an easy enough experiment (six
or seven months from now).  But from observation, the cloths and racks work
together:  the cloths hold the mass of fruit so that it doesn't squish down
into the racks, which provide the channels for the juice to escape.
Without the racks, you're hoping that a thin layer of cloth will remain
porous enough to let juice through.


Oh, yeah, I also thought about trying to make round press racks to fit in
the basket, which would also require a set of cloths, and I finally decided
(with some gentle mocking from friends to help me along) that I was getting
carried away trying to salvage the basket-press approach.  IOW, instead of
trying to turn a basket press into a poor imitation of a rack-and-cloth
press through a long series of half-@$$ed steps, why not just build a
rack-and-cloth press?!?

Subject: Cell rupture during bottle pastuerization

I've been pondering the bottle pastuerization technique again recently, with
all the recent discussion going on.


I seem to recall a note during the last cycle on this topic from a
Digestarian that their attempt had gone horribly wrong.  It sounded like the
yeast cells lysed (popped) during the process and rendered his cider a
cloudy muck.


I can see how it would be possible.  Back in my bright college days (oh,
carefree days that fly...) I remember during genetics lab that we burst cell
cultures on purpose as one technique to get at the DNA.  A small amount of
cell sludge yields an amazing amount of crud the consistency on snot.


So my question is: How frequently has this happened to folks trying to
bottle pastuerize cider with lees in the bottom.  I've had Bill Rhyne's
cider - the lees in his cider aren't especially firm - but they are still
obvious yeast lees that settle out in a pretty short time. (Not cell debris)


So does it happen to an occasional bottle?  Depend on temp and conditions?
Depend on yeast strain? Or is it vey rare that you end up with yeast or
bacteria with weakened cell walls in your cider?
