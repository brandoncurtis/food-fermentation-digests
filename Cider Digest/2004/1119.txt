i have experimented with in the bottle carbonation, priming with sugar etc. 
can anyone tell me the exact process and equipment needed to take a still 
cider with NO active yeasts (2-3 year old) and bottle it so it will be bubbly
when i open it and drink? counter pressure bottle fillers etc. i can't seem 
to get a straight story from the homebrew shops. thanks, doug fincke@ 
mporch@valstar.net

This is a bizarre story!  Either the bentonite is faulty or the pH meter
is.  First question, are you calibrating the pH meter correctly each
time before use, with freshly made pH 4 and pH 7 buffers?  Most pH
meters have a calibration routine which involves setting a potentiometer
at each of those values to ensure that the response slope is correct.
Are you using clean containers for the pH measurement and are you
rinsing the electrode with the test solution and then discarding it
before each measurement? Sorry to sound like a school ma'am, and I hope
I'm not 'teaching my granny to suck eggs'! Second question, what's the
measured pH of your bentonite slurry made up in pure distilled water?


If you're using the pH meter correctly, and the reading of the bentonite
slurry is well over 7, it sounds like you've got the wrong grade. Maybe
the type used for pond lining, not for beverage use. Or maybe it's been
wrongly labelled and it's not bentonite at all?
