Unless you already have a CO2 tank and counterpressure bottle filler
equipment, the easiest and best way for bottle-conditioned carbonation is to
make a 'yeast starter' to add to the bulk batch by taking a pack of dry
yeast (champagne) and rehydrating it in a pint of sterilized sugar water
(boiled and cooled to ~80 degrees - covered - before adding yeast). I
recommend powdered corn sugar (no effect on flavor like cane sugar sometimes
does) at rate of 1/2 cup for 5 gallons for a nice light carbonation, or 3/4
cup per 5 gallon for a fizzier carbonation.  Allow the starter to sit for
about 3-6 hours at room temp before adding to the cider - add to cider, stir
it in gently and bottle it right away.  Corn sugar can be purchased at any
homebrew supply store.

For priming with sugar, I'd follow the directions for priming beer, except 
I'd add half the sugar to get half the level of carbonation (a matter of taste 
as to how much carbonation you want).


Another way involves 3 or 5 gallon cornelius kegs, a CO2 tank, and 
counter-pressure filling device.  I use the 3-gallon size.  You put the
cider in the keg and apply about 30 psi of carbon dioxide (CO2).  Keep keg
in refrigerator and keep reapplying CO2 until the pressure doesn't drop
(i.e., CO2 is saturated in cider). This can take a day or two (another
way, if you're impatient, involves more shaking and/or a diffusion stone
to get the gas into the liquid faster)


I then fill the bottles using a counter-pressure filling device.  Mine is one 
of the more basic ones that has two valves.  I put the counterpressure device 
on the bottle and open the CO2 line to pressurize the bottle with maybe 5 psi 
of CO2.  Then, I close the CO2 line and open the cold pressurized cider line 
and the bottle fills with cider (without foaming). I shut off the cider line 
and remove the counterpressure filling device from the bottle and cap the 
bottle.  It works beautifully unless you get careless and forget to turn off a 
valve along the way.  The above-mentioned procedure gives plenty of carbonation 
and you may want to use less.

     Here is perhaps an odd question from a novice orchardist.  Does 
anyone here have experience with root-pruning cider apple trees?  This 
would be something along the lines of deeply spading a line of 
circumference around the base of the tree to trim the surface roots. 
The idea is to encourage the tree to root more deeply into the ground 
and partake of the mineral content found in the lower stratas of soil.


     This was suggested to me by an eminent winegrower and vintner when 
we were discussing apples for cider.  Apparently root pruning is 
sometimes performed in viticulture for that purpose.  He argued quite 
convincingly for the importance of /terroir/ and mineral-rich soil 
(lime/granite) for fruit used in fermented & distilled beverages.


     How long a radius from the trunk would one want to place the spade? 
Would root-pruning apples be a /bad/ idea?


     Thanks in advance for your advice and patience with the newbie.

I am new to apple growing and I am looking for the most economical source
for cider safe sprays.  I only have a handful of trees, but I want to
start a modest spray program.  Any recommendations as far as types/brands
of sprays as well as places to obtain them?  Many thanks in advance...
