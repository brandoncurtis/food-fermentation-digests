Not having used a counter pressure before, is it a device that keeps the
bottle sealed from air even when the bottle cap is put on? Or doesn't a
small exposure to air while the cap is put on matter?

Ed offered a method for priming a still cider with yeast and sugar to 
bottle condition a cider. In my opinion, Ed's method of rehydrating the 
yeast for a few hours in the concentrated priming sugar solution 
(1/2-3/4 cup sugar) is a poor way of preparing the yeast. All 
manufacturers of yeast that I have seen recommend rehydrating the yeast 
in water, and a concentrated sugar solution is the last thing a 
dehydrated yeast needs to see right out of the package. The reason for 
this is that the yeast cell membranes are leaky upon initial hydration. 
The yeast need a short time (15 min) to repair these membranes before 
being exposed to a highly osmotic solution. If they haven't had a 
chance to repair the cell membrane, the high sugar solution will do 
more damage than good to the cells. After they've repaired their 
membranes, they need some food and should be provided that. This can be 
the batch. There are plenty of cells in a packet of dried yeast to 
condition a five gallon batch--no real need for a starter culture of 
yeast.


One should hydrate the yeast separately from the sugar solution and add 
them separately to the batch or to the bottles. (Be sure to mix the 
concentrated sugar solution THOROUGHLY into the batch if one is batch 
priming.)

Well, that's kind of like asking what kind of car to buy, and where to get 
the best deal.  Depends on what you need !  First figure out what (or IF) 
you need to spray for.  Then check out this site:
http://fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu/
And especially this one:
http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/selectnewpest.apples.html


That should get you on the way to figuring out why, what, and when to spray 
(or not).  Be aware that apples for cider will not need the kind of spray 
programs that market fruit needs - much spraying is actually to combat 
mostly cosmetic problems (e.g. scab).  But it all depends on your location 
and which pests are active, and how bad they really are.  You have a lot of 
research to do and choices to make!


Having said all that, a dormant oil spray is probably the first thing to 
consider, and it is quite safe for cider.  (I never got around to dormant 
spraying this year, and now things are leafing out already, so I'm just 
hoping my trees are healthy enough to cope with the mites and aphids.)


Cheers,
Tim

Well I'm no orchardist so this reply is from a position of deep
ignorance, but I never heard of root pruning apples for this purpose.
When it is done with apples it is generally to restrict growth and
therefore to encourage over-vigorous trees to switch to flower-bud
formation in response to the induced stress.  There is a picture of this
being done in the now out of print RHS 'Fruit Garden Displayed'.


My understanding is that apples and grapes grow very differently. Apples
have a tap root to hold the tree in place and stop it being blown over,
but their feeding roots are close to the surface. Root pruning will not
change this basic physiology.  Grapes have fewer surface roots but can
develop very long tap roots in dry conditions which can also act as
feeding / moisture uptake roots if required.  I believe in poor stony
soils like the Rhineland and the Mosel in Germany these can go many
metres down to seek the nutrients they need.


Hopefully an expert will put us right on this!  I would certainly like
to think that 'terroir' has a place in cider growing - in traditional UK
cider areas the difference between Devon sandstone, Somerset alluvial
clay and Gloucestershire limestone hills has always been held to be
reflected in the characteristics of the cider from each region.  Not
that any one is 'better' - just different!

Thomas ask about root pruning to force roots deeper. I don't know
anything about grapes but I've been growing fruit trees for many years.
First of all, most of the soil nutrients are located within the first few
inches of soil where the organic matter mulches and decays and is carried
down to the first foot or so where most of the feeder roots are located
and these roots intercept the nutrients as the are carried down with
water(rain or irrigation).Also root depth( in fruit trees) is
characteristic of the particular variety of root stock that the tree is
grafted to, some are shallow rooted and some are deep rooted that's their
nature. You may be able to force roots a little deeper by letting the top
soil become dry, but forcing roots down to a depth where there are fewer
available nutrients and drying up the feeder roots would serve no useful
purpose other than to better anchor the tree. There may be other factors
that apply to apples for cider but for fresh fruit you want the tree to
have an abundance of nutrients and enough water to avoid stress. One way
to simulate apples that come from a stressed tree is to sweat plump juicy
apples to the point of shrivel and then  juice them.
