Subject: How to make "sweet" cidre (french style) ???

I'm new to this forum (and also new to cider-making) and hope my English 
will be sufficient to get some answers:
  Since November 2003 I have got three wooden barrels in my cellar; one oak 
barrel (50  liters) with apple and two barrels with pear cider.
  The cellar became rather cold through winter (9� Celsius) and the 
fermentation is  very, very slow, but did not stop.
All my informations until now I got through Internet at several french 
"cidre"-sites; I wanted (and still want) to keep it as simple as possible. 
Until now I racked all the barrels two times. The apple cider is around 
1025 sg. The ciders have good carbonation at the moment (and taste good, - 
though still very sweet).


  As I read in the french explanations, some traditional french cidre is 
bottled at 1015 sg., which gives "sweet" cidre with low alcohol. I could 
get bottles (called "light champaign bottles" here in Austria) that 
withstand high pressure; but I am not sure what happens if fermentation 
goes on in the bottle. Does anyone have experience with this french kind 
of "cidre"-making ? I thought of racking the cider between 1015 and 1010 
sg. again (maybe twice or three times) and wait if fermentation really 
stops and then fill it into bottles. Might be that the bottles explode, 
when the cellar warms up during summer ?? How can french cidre be bottled 
this sweet ?
There is another thing bothering me: First I wanted to do fermentation 
without artificial yeast, because the french texts tell not to add some. 
Because of the cold temperatures I decided to add some yeast I had in my 
fridge, but this was yeast meant for distilling, so I wonder if this 
fermentation can be stopped at all.


I'm thankful for any suggestions and helping words...............


Ernst

Can anyone suggest sources of information for identifying a pear variety?  
It's astrigent enough that I think it may be a perry pear.  Also the shape 
is odd, pear-shaped, but the fat end is at the stem, or else smooth oval 
with both ends pointed. Fruit hangs on tree and stays rock hard until late 
October, very prolific annual bearing.
