I would be a little wary of the Piltdown cider. Though the cider may be 
legit, Piltdown man is not. Piltdown man was a hoax. It was a human 
skull fitted with an ape jaw and was planted to suggest that the 
missing link between apes and humans happened in England. If the find 
is at the same strata as the skull, and is published as such, it too is 
likely to be a hoax.


Sorry to rain on the parade, but the flags went up.

There is "The History and Virtues of Cyder," by R. K. French.  But it 
focuses on English history.


>over the last month I found out that traditions of cider making

Yes, and the problem is that English authors are generally only concerned 
with English history!

Thank you for posting those!  My French, she is not so good, but I will try.


Cheers,

Ben and Bill thanks to your responce to my King apple polination
problem. Just to clear up a few things. I know it is a king because the
previous owner planted it himself and told me so. I did try adding some
borax last spring following the directions of the local garden center.
Last spring was tough on all the trees in the vicinity as we had a late
frost right at the peak of blosoming and none of the trees did as well
as previous years. The king had one single apple. The Boscoop did much
better at 2 wheelbarrows full but the year before I had 5 and that
should have been the off year. As far as microclimate goes I am just
south of the town of Campbell River in the Storries beach area. I have
noticed that we are about two weeks behind the town itself when it comes
to blooming of any plant variety. As well my yard is nesteled into the
rainforest along Wood creek and is a little more shaded than I would
like . However this does not stop ythe other apples from fully ripening
 I certainly will try the suggestions . I will look for some other
polinater branches to place . I don't know about beating it yet , maybe
I'll just give it a "stern talking to" or a " time out". Thanks Darcy

Subject: Tannin from apples
From: Charles Fritsch <cafritsch@earthlink.net>

Folks,


I make and retail an all natural fermented cider from GoldRush apples which
make a wonderful sweet cider but are a bit short on tannins.  To increase
the tannins, I add juice from my Enterprise apples (disease resistant
version of Melrose) but I didn't have enough this past season.  (I have
planted Hewes crab, Roxbury Russet, and other disease resistant cultivars
for cider, but they aren't in production.)


Since the Federal tax restrictions for marketing a fermented cider without a
liscense requires 100% apple juice and no other additives, I need a source
of tannin from apple juice.  Any suggestions?

Dick's postulations regarding early fermentation bear serious
consideration.  One interesting note is that the regions of Kazhakstan
which were the the native range of apples are near the vicinity of
evidence of the earliest known wine residues.  Evidence from Dr. Mayliss
and from the history of the migratory patterns of Piltdown Man (and of
another pleistocene hominid, Australopithecus spiff-arino) show a
logical progression of population distributions from the Caucuses,
across northern Europe and onto the British Isles over the then-present
land bridge from northern Europe.  That they might have taken both
apples and their knowledge of Pleistocene fermentation with them is
totally consistent with the accepted corpus of work in this vein.  This
proves to be little more than a further extension of McGovern's
"Paleolithic Hypothesis" or the equally academically accepted "Magic
Bag" theory (actually a hypothesis, too).  Perhaps this will become
known as the Dunn Postulate, or Dick and Sylvester's Excellent Adventure.


I am eagerly anticipating the results of the more authoritative
archaeo-chemical assays, which will certainly prove definitive in
supporting the growing school of thought regarding this development.  


Yours in science,

Re:   Cider as "earliest fermented beverage"?? (Dick Dunn)


Dick, I think that one could speculate that the first
cider was the one that Eve offered Adam as a
temptation. Contrary to what was recorded in the
Bible, Adam was not interested in the apple, he wanted
the cider. That would make cider most likely the
senior alcoholic beverage in history. Does this count?
