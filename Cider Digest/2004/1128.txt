Subject: Ripening Times for Perry Pears
From: "Three Hills Farm" <organic@threehillsfarm.com>

Can anyone suggest a good overall reference for ripening times of perry 
pears?  I often refer to the appendices in Brogdale's "The Book of 
Apples" for info on heirloom apples.  Is there a comparible reference on 
pears that would include perry pears?  The Gloucestershire Orchard Group 
page on perry pears is helpful 
(http://www.orchard-group.uklinux.net/glos/pears/ncpp.php), but it 
doesn't list any information on ripening times.   I'm trying to 
determine the relative ripening times for the following six varieties:
  a.. Moorcroft
  b.. Rock
  c.. Teddington Green
  d.. White Bache
  e.. White Longdon
  f.. Yellow Huffcap
Any/all feedback would be much appreciated.

I've read in a few places that garbage disposals have been used to grind 
apples, but it sounds like they don't work real well for more than small 
quantities.  What else is available which is affordable and works OK for 
a small scale, <10 bushels at a time, user?   Can a electric meat 
grinder like the ones used for hamburger and sausage be used?  I've 
found plans for a small hammermill and will make one if I need to, but 
would like to find out if there are affordable grinders other than the 
"Happy Valley" type available.

I note he said he could only use juice in his cider.  I may be naive, but
what about juice from other fruit?  Maybe Quince, or some species of pears?
Would this violate the intent of the regulations?

You ought to try planting a crab called 'Brandywine'.  Large fruited ( 
20-30mm), and WOW!!! what a real mouth-killer as far as tannin goes.  
Biennial, but that's probably a training/rootstock problem, doesn't get 
Fireblight.  Couldn't tell you the acidity because my toungue had gone 
dead.  I froze a bushel a few years ago and haven't got round to doing 
anything with them yet.

My question is for anyone with any experience using a handheld digital 
pH meter for making cider- how long do the sensors last for if they are 
only used during cider pressing season?  Is there a solution to store 
the sensor in which will prolong this lifetime?

Subject: Garden Shredder - the result

G'day All,


Well the day of reckoning came and went over the Easter weekend.


The little 2200w GMC shredder worked like a dream! Even I thought it may
only be so so, and end up being a bit too coarse. Nope! Because of the speed
it shredded and pulped its way through 12 cases of fruit and I got a
exceptional extraction from them.


The only downsides to it all was;


1) There is no seal on the casing where it opens out to clear blockages etc.
So under heavy load it tends to ooze a bit out the side. I will fix that
presently with some refrigerator magnetic seal strips so it allows me to
clean the whole thing properly.


2) I will probably look at fitting a stainless steel wire "garrotte"  across
the middle of the hopper chute to split any oversized fruit because anything
over 3" tended to spin a bit trying to get purchase at the blade plate.


All in all I am pretty stoked with the result and would recommend it. Just
be careful to ensure that all metal parts are coated and that the drive
plate is also coated. The only non-coated part was the actual blades.


OK Catcha!

Well before anyone freaks out, I didn't cut this tree down.  The county did 
due to it's being damaged in an ice storm last winter...  I just took it 
home with me before it got made into firewood like several of the other 
apple trees they cut....


Has anyone out there ever made lumber out of an apple tree?  Yes, it's rare 
for a tree to be large enough to worry about doing something like that and 
usally it's rotten in the middle but I ended up with a straight solid trunk 
about 16-18" dia and +7' long.....  I was going to find a local with a 
portable mill and cut it into 5/4 (1.25" thick so it can be plained after 
drying to 1" boards...).  Anyone tried this before and have any suggestions? 
The ends of the log have been painted with sealer while I find someone 
willing to mill it.


I figure it will be several years to dry it slowly as to not crack it all 
and then I don't know what I will make out of it.  I did manage to get a 
cutting off it.  I had stolen apples off this tree for that last several 
years.  It was something like a Red Gravenstein but I have just labled the 
grafting 'The Giving Tree' so far.  We will see what I can make out of the 
whole thing....
