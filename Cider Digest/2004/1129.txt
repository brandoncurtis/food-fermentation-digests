I have heard of one person using an old commercial ice grinder/chipper 
for grinding cider apples.  Belt-driven, just hooked it up to an old 
electric motor.  Something you might be able to find used or in a junkyard.

I'd be suspicious that you will be disappointed with a meat grinder. We
used a restaurant-grade, continuous-feed food processor one time, and I
think you'd find the same problem, which is also the limitation of the
garbage disposal. Heat. Most of these items have a thermocouple
arrangement that senses the heat of the motor and turns it off before it
gets too hot. When it's cooled off (which took about 20 min, IIRC),
it'll start up and run again for a while, until the same thing happens.
We were running until after dark that night. I think we had 25 bushel
boxes (40#). Lot for a backyard operation, but we had about 10 people
involved.


The garbage disposal units usually depend on the flowing cold water to
cool them off. That, and being run only intermittently. I've wondered
idly if you could rig a fan on the "back end" of the motor axis, to blow
cool air onto the motor. It'd be pretty funky, and need shrouding for
the sake of fingers and other extremities, but might work. Haven't
gotten around to putting it into practice, not having a steady supply of
apples (hmmm--though the bloom on my Gravenstein at the moment is
promising??).


I use a Happy Valley, because it at least runs as many bushels as I
need, or have arm power, to.

Chris Horn asked for advice on apple lumber. 


I've had a few logs milled into lumber, though never apple. But: My
experience with apple firewood is that it can spalt and deterioriate
within a year, so get it milled ASAP. You might consider going to 4/4
instead of 5/4, unless you really need 1" finished stock. Find a mill
with good equipment, preferably a band saw type. A poorly maintained,
wobbly circular blade will not only waste potential boards, but also
produce varying thicknesses. Stack the boards well off the ground,
sticker them properly, cover the top layer (leave the sides open, it's
going to need good air circulation), and place plenty of weight over
each sticker. The rule of thumb for air-drying is 1 year per inch, but
it's probably better wait 2 years. If the boards are really nice, and
especially if you're in a part of Oregon that gets a lot of rain, you
might want to check out custom-kiln drying.


If, however, your log twists along it's length, you'll have a dickens of
a time getting the boards to dry straight. In that case, you might be
better off sawing it into 3 or 4 inch boards, drying them, and resawing
after they are good and dry.


On a cider note: I just finished setting out 31 apple trees of my own
grafting in my back yard orchard. Most are bittersweets, but there's a
half-dozen sharps, plus a few russets (Golden and Egremont). It looks
like there's finally blossom buds on some earlier-planted Browns and
Harry Masters Jersey. I can't wait.

Subject: Re: Ripening Times for Perry Pears

"Three Hills Farm" <organic@threehillsfarm.com> (John Gasbarre) asked about
ripening times for various perry pears.


I dug out the following from Luckwill & Pollard, _Perry_Pears_, 1963 (and
long out of print, unfortunately).  The info depends on your climate and
all that, YMMV, etc.


I don't have direct experience working with perry pears.  (I'm trying; I
hope I live long enough!)  But the time between harvest and milling is
quite variable...some seem to want to be milled as soon as they're picked
while others seem to need a couple months.  Anyway, here's the notes from
L&P for the varieties John asked:


>   a.. Moorcroft
    Harvest: 3rd to 4th week of September.  The pears ripen over a rather
    long period and are difficult to shake
    Milling: Up to two days after harvest


>   b.. Rock
    Harvest: 4th week of October to 1st week of November
    Milling: Up to eight weeks after harvest


>   c.. Teddington Green
    Harvest: 2nd to 3rd week of October
    Milling: Up to one week after harvest


>   d.. White Bache
    Harvest: 2nd to 3rd week of October
    Milling: Up to one week after harvest


>   e.. White Longdon
    Harvest: 1st to 2nd week of October
    Milling: One to three weeks after harvest


>   f.. Yellow Huffcap
    Harvest: 1st to 3rd week of October
    Milling: Up to one week after harvest


(John later asked offline about a few more; since I typed those up, here
they are as well.  HTH someone.)


>         Barland
    Harvest: 4th week of September to 1st week of October.  The fruit falls
    over a long period.
    Milling: up to three days after harvest


>         Blakeney Red
    Harvest: 4th week of September to 2nd week of October
    Milling: up to seven days after harvest


>         Dead Boy
    Harvest: 2nd to 3rd week of October
    Milling: one to three weeks after harvest


>         Flakey Bark
    Harvest: 2nd to 4th week of October
    Milling: up to three weeks after harvest


>         Hendre Huffcap
    Harvest: 1st to 2nd week of October.  The fruit is readily shaken from
    the tree
    Milling: up to two weeks after harvest


>         Oldfield
    Harvest: 3rd to 4th week of October
    Milling: from three to six weeks after harvest


I wish the Luckwill/Pollard book could be reprinted, as it's got a wealth
of data in it!  I was fortunate enough to get a photocopy by the good
graces of a Digest subscriber.

Subject: Wyeast Cider Yeast?
From: "Mark Ellis" <mark@artisansrus.com>
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 2004 05:09:39 +1000


G'day All,


I generally use champagne yeasts to finish of my 2 step fermentations (
I pitch after 4-5 days once the native yeasts have had a go at things)


Anyway, I just got a hold of a couple of Wyeast cider smack packs and
wanted to see a few opinions on this yeast.


Any good?


Cheers
