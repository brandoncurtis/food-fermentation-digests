Fortunately, Dick is misinfomed!  AFAIK the book is still available from
Vigo as a reprint which was made a few years ago.  See

[Janitor's note:  I did verify that one can order the book from Vigo;
they have it (reprint) in stock.  International orders can't be done
online, but you can phone-order.]

Just wondering what hoops need to be gone through to import scion wood
from Europe or even Canada. To late for this year I know, just finished
grafting some SRC's (scab resistant cultivars) and now I'm lusting after
some hard to get old timey numbers.

I have a small orchard with a variety of fruit trees. 
A few are apples, and this year I am adding my first
English cider apple trees (yay!).  My question
concerns how to handle grass growth in the orchard.  I
know that some European (French?) orchards are grazed,
anyone know with what type of animal?  My trees are
all semi-dwarfs, so I'm looking for something that
will eat the grass, not eat the trees, and not rub on
the trees vigorously enough to damage them.  I've got
goats, sheep, and cattle at my disposal.  Do these
grazed French orchards have full-size trees that are
less likely to be damaged by grazers?  My intent is to
produce French style cider in the future, if possible.

I know this is at the edge of being a commercial posting; however I
also know that in past years it's been extremely difficult to find
perry pears in the US, so bear with me if you will.


In talking to Jim Cummins I found that Cummins Nursery still has fair
numbers of about ten varieties of perry pears available this spring;
I'd hate to hear that they went begging, after the shortages in
previous years.  www.cumminsnursery.com, 315-789-7083.


If other suppliers also have stock of perry pear varieties, please contact
me (cider-request@talisman.com) and I'll see that you get equal billing
here ASAP.


If you're interested in doing real perry from your own trees, it's a
big deal to get trees in the ground as soon as possible, as it takes
many years to get them to bearing quality fruit.


I apologize for being unable to get organized enough to put up the web
page of commercial sources for cider apples and perry pears as I did a
couple times in the past.  I'll try to make it happen for next season.

Forwarding a note (below) from Gordon Strong, and please pay attention to
this if you're interested in cider competition.  This is a BJCP (Beer Judge
Certification Program) project to revise their competition style guidelines.
They have made major changes in their cider styles.  They are paying
attention to serious cidermaking and wanting to involve cidermakers (not
just brewers who dabble in cider).  In the cider styles, they've nearly
started from scratch rather than trying to revise the earlier guidelines--
which is good but likely means there are still rough edges.


There's a reason I think this deserves attention in the cider world:
Although the key word in BJCP's title is "Beer", realize that these
guidelines can be (will be) used in many major competitions in North
America--not only beer competitions which include cider, but perhaps
specialty cider-only competitions where the BJCP styles are, in some
cases, the only standards available.


Follow the link to their web site and poke around.  The cider categories
are at the end.  If you're going to make comments, you ought to register.


Comments would be particularly helpful in the area of "commercial
examples", as this is a difficult issue in the US.


Note that there is no explicit connection between the BJCP work and this
digest.  If you see something in the BJCP work that you think needs to be
discussed here on the digest, by all means start up a discussion.  BUT,
realize that your comments won't necessarily be seen by all of the BJCP
folks unless you take them back to their site where they're set up to
receive and respond to comments.
