Seems like there are other problems with cows in an orchard. As I 
understand it, fecal matter from cows grazing in an orchard was the source 
of the e.coli contamination that created major problems for Snapple several 
years ago.


Even if Bossy can't get to the apples on the trees, she can make the fruit 
unfit for use. In theory, the contaminated apples were all groundfalls, but 
that's not a risk I would want to run.

Typically the orchards we visited in France and the UK had standard trees
and sheep. I visited an dwarfing Asian Pear orchard near here several years
ago and the owners had constructed a electrified wire system which keeps the
sheep from the eating the foliage, but allow them to graze below the
foliage. It seemed to work well.


On a second note, Dick Dunn and his team deserve a thank you from the cider
community for the excellent job on rewriting the BJCP Cider Guidelines. The
introduction is excellent and these guidelines should go a long way to
improve the understanding of cider characteristics, and defining styles of
cider.

Yes. Typically a French (or English) traditional orchard will have
widely spaced standard trees so that sheep or cattle grazing will not be
a problem and indeed that is all part of the original 'dual purpose'
management.  With modern bush orchards this is much more difficult.
Until the trees are quite mature it's not easy to keep livestock with
them because of bark stripping, and in any cases such orchards are not
intended to be used this way.   Here in the UK though it is not uncommon
to see a few sheep running in small private bush orchards (not the large
commercial ones) but the lower branches must be above browse height and
the bark is often protected eg, with plastic fertiliser sacks.  Twenty
minutes attention by a determined animal with a taste for bark can spell
the end for a young tree!  For that reason goats (being browsers not
grazers) are an absolute no-no.   Have you thought of geese?  They are
grazers too and also quite traditional in European orchards.


The benefit of grazing is that it keeps the grass down and the nitrogen
low - both helpful to slow-fermenting French style cider. The downside
is  that some people nowadays are unhappy about mixing any animals with
fruit crops, for public health reasons.
