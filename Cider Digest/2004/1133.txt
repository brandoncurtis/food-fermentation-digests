The eColi problem was with Odwalla Juice, a California company using 
unpasteurized apple cider in their juice products, not Snapple.

The death of one child due to this problem led to lawsuits

and sparked many states push for limits on cider mills offering unpasteurized 
juice for sale.

In reference to the Snapple fiasco (It was Odwalla, and a child died) 
fresh manure was brought in as a fertilizer just before harvest (because 
it was virtually free and available). The grower was conventional (not 
organic..as supposed by many Odwalla drinkers). The trees were shaken 
(since they knew it was going to juice and the grower had a contract) 
and contact with manure was made. Even though Odwalla had very good 
rinsing facilities (so they say and I believe them) the nightmare 
occurred. Grazing is a very good way to get nutrients to your orchard 
and good food to your animals. Organic standards require that no fresh 
manure come in contact with edibile produce within 90 or 120 days of 
harvest (depending on the crop), These are very safe guidelines.
    Given the circumstances of the Odwalla situation...California 
Central Valley grower with supplied manure from a big diary operation 
(read unhealthy cows on antibiotics) it is not surprising that there was 
bad ecoli in the manure. Most of us smaller cider types who have time to 
graze animals in our orchards probably do not have drugged animals and 
the poo poo will very unlikely have "bad" ecoli. At my farm all 
windfalls that are usuable are made into vinegar. Drops that occur 
during picking are picked up daily and are refrigerated until pressing 
day and could be used for hard cider...or syrup or vinegar (none for 
fresh cider). Only packing house culls and hand picked are used for 
fresh and hard cider (except above mentioned "drops"). We have chickens 
on the run every day and two horses that are let loose for awhile most 
days (after about an hour of running and grazing they get playful and 
start nibbling and rubbing on trees,,,aargh!). The goats are ALWAYS 
locked up (man, can they do damage in a short time!)
    In short, to be as safe as possible do not let animals in 90  to 120 
days before harvest and mow or disc in poo poo if you can (also you can 
spray compost tea or Bio-Dynamic Preps on the ground to break down the 
manures before harvest). While alcohol is not a good host for bad 
bacterias, they can occasionally survive. It would be best to use 
anything questionable for vinegar or chuck it. How safe is safe as 
possible?  Well, and I did not want to hear this but...The "bad ecoli" 
was found in the poo poo of deer and some birds (both very rare and it 
was questioned if the ecoli survived long after exiting the animal). In 
my opinion the best defense is a healthy organic orchard and flock or 
heard and most all problems will be nullified.

is my first input.   Thanks

Thanks for the responses.

Can you describe this system a little more?  I make
extensive use of electric fencing elsewhere.

No, I hadn't thought of them.  Would they really eat
the grass fast enough that I wouldn't have to mow?  I
guess if I had enough of them...


Looks like sheep (or geese!) might be my only option,
and even then I'm putting my trees at risk.  I think
I'll stick with the mower and weedwacker for awhile
yet.

Dear Digest,


Here's a bit of info on a possible source of 
tannins that I've observed:


An interesting observation on Bud 118 is that it is 
 a rosybloom type.  It has beautiful deep pink
 blooms and appears to be fairly scab resistant.
  The apples are in the apple/crab range for
 size, ripen here in August, and are sweet with
 fairly high tannin levels.  Unlike most hardy
 crabs that have tannins, Bud 118 tastes like it
 is relatively low in acid levels. I have not 
measured this, only tasted. I plan to fruit
 118's to try as a source of tannin for hard ciders
- --something that is thus far almost non-existent
 in zone 3 hardy apples.
