Subject: Traditional Cider w. Adjuncts ?
From: DirkBlaze@aol.com

I wonder if anyone reading is aware of a "traditional" hard cider made with 
ingredients other than apple juice that are meant to contribute a distinct 
flavor to the end product (so not white sugar or malic or tannic acid). 


I call such ingredients "adjuncts" as they would be called by a beer brewer.  
There are numerous examples in the world of beer brewing; in addition to 
grains other than barley malt and herbaceous hops, there are examples of all
sorts of spices, fruits, herbs around the world.  For example, in Belgium, 
traditional "white" beers are made with the addition of orange peel and
coriander to the wurt.  There are also many fascinating examples in winemaking.


I would consider oak aging an example of a traditional adjunct, used in both 
England and France, although I'm not sure how traditional that is. I have had 
hot mulled cider in England, fermented but low alcohol, mulled with spices 
which was wonderful, but those spices were added after fermentation and aging
so they were not adjuncts.


Of course, there are many commercial varieties (especially in Canada)
flavored with everything from apricot to kiwi (literally).  But I'm referring
to something that didn't get invented in the laboratory of a huge cider -
pop maker, or even the recent invention of a more "artesian" cider maker.

I made a batch of cider with only fresh unpasturized
juice and I tastes much nicer when I pour it from high
hights. I believe I read about that being done in
Spain. Also, I have had rhubarb wine and lemon wine. I
liked them both. I have some made from Meyer(sp?)
lemons that I almost added rhubarb to.

 The other day I opened a bottle of cider , produced by the Ravens Ridge
cidery in kelowna BC. After having a glass of the still cider I put the rest
back in the fridge for later . The next day I had the rest. It was noticebly
smoother and you could taste the apple flavour much better. I have noticed
this same effect with other ciders and wines. I have heard of letting red
wine breath but is there any precedent for serving cider this way?
 Today I ran two stalks of rhubarb through my juicer and combined it with
lemon juice, water, and sugar to make a rhubarb lemonade. It was
faboulous,with a full body and a fruity flavour. It set me to wondering if
anyone has tried adding rhubarb to apple juice to make a rhubarb cider?

Tim,


I planted a number of Bud 118/Bud 9 interstems I ordered from 
Bear Creek the last year they offered that rootstock. (I think 
it was 1998, but you'd have to check back catalogues if you 
still have them.)  The rootstocks themselves had been grafted 
that same spring and had callused when I received them.  


Two of the grafts didn't take, and I didn't get around to grafting 
them the following spring.  On one, the Bud 9 interstem continued 
to grow.  It is currently a twiggy 2 1/2 ' tree.  On the other the 
interstem died.  I decided to let the Bud 118 grow and compare the 
two. 


In 1992, The Bud 9 (On the 118) flowered and fruited.  I picked 
the drops and tossed them.  In 1993 both trees fruited quite 
heavily.  The Bud 118 was a willowy 9-10 footer.  I'm sure I must 
have made a pruning cut or two at some point since it was planted.
The 118 fruited so heavily that branches bent to the ground, 
though they didn't break.


When fruit started to drop in mid August I tasted both.  The 
Bud 118 had a really nice tannic bite, yet the tannins were smooth, 
not rough, if that makes sense. The 118 tasted quite sweet. The 
Bud 9 had noticeably fewer tannins, though some, but was much less 
sweet than the 118. The Bud 9's tannins had a roughness to them that 
I might describe more as bitter than tannic.  Neither had much acid 
in them.


I did no measurements of these, but compared them (tastewise)to a 
'Centennial' apple crab (slightly past its prime)that grows nearby.  
The 118 and the 9 were much less acidic.  It was hard to compare 
the sugar levels of the 118 and 9 to the Centennial because of the 
acid difference.  It struck me that a low acid, high tannin apple 
might be just the ticket for us northern cidermakers.  


The Bud 118 appears to be quite a vigorous grower. putting on at least 
2' of growth per year (quite a lot in this climate).  Since it's 
supposed to produce a 70-80% top I imagine it will be nearly full sized.  
If size were a concern, I suppose that an interested grower could graft 
a Bud 118 onto a Bud 9 root.  Now there's a concept:-).


If any one else tries this get back to me in a few years.  I'd be curious 
of other's experiences.  I won't be making any cider from my 118 this year. 
I'm removing the crop this year to allow for the tree to shape up better 
without having to carry a heavy fruit load It's a heavy bearer, apparently 
with a slight tendency towards biennial, when not thinned. (Based on 
fewer blooms this year than last.)


I have not yet ferment Bud 118 juice yet.  I was too busy when 118 fruited 
last summer to press the fruit.  This note is just an observation that 
might be of interest to folks who have trouble growing the tender British 
or French cider apples because of winter low temps.

Does anyone know of any outlets in Chicago where I can
get some decent hard cider?


Cheers
