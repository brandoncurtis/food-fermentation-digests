Subject: Apple flavor in cider
From: "Peter Johnson" <johnson_peter@sbcglobal.net>

Has anyone been successful in retaining an apple flavor in their cider?  My
cider seems to ferment most to all of the apple flavor out of the final
product.  I have tried champagne, Epernay, Cotes des Blancs, Nottingham,
Windsor Ale, and Doric yeast with varying degrees of dryness but none
particularly had an apple flavor.  Any assistance or suggestions would be
greatly appreciated.


Thank you,
Peter Johnson

Hello all:


After spending the spring building my deer fence and (FINALLY) planting my 
orchard, I look at my little trees and envision so many possibilities in 
the years to come.  Today, my thoughts wander to the Nehou, Binet Rouge, 
and Bedan trees amd the French-style ciders I plan to make.  My question 
regards the traditional multiple rackings required for this style of 
cider.  Has anyone tried using conical fermenters to achieve this with out 
the oxygen-introducing rackings?  Or would the best results come from 
stirring the bottom of the cider as is done when siphoning?


On a similar note, one batch of my '03 cider turned out to have a nice, 
slightly sweet character after a somewhat successful keeve and one more 
racking than my usual (two, instead of one).  This batch seems to be my 
best yet, even better than the barrel batch which is made up of some 15% 
high-tannin varieties from Farnum Hill/Poverty Lane.  The latter batch is 
very pale with little oxidation of the original juice, as I sulfited the 
pulp while milling.  It is fairly high acid, and I am awaiting MLF after 
inoculating.


All for now,

Hello everyone,


As many of you already know, the HomeBrew Digest has been down for several
weeks and our web site is currently hosted by the HBD.  As a result, there
is no way to post the BUZZ Off results.  I have included below the results.
MCAB winners will be posted later.  Thank you to everyone who entered and
congratulations to all our winners!

I would be interested in finding good sources for
cider in the Seattle area. I can find Westcott Bay,
White Oak, and Irvine's at Metropolitain Market. I've
seen Westcott Bay at Whole Foods. Any other sources?
What about restaurants/bars? I know of several sources
for Norman cider here as well but I am particularly
interested in finding good, local cider.
