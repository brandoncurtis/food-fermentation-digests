Mmm... perhaps! My main (personal) problem with high alcohol ciders is 
that the underlying flavour balance of cider simply never matches that 
of grape wine. As the alcohol goes up by 'chaptalization' with 
flavourless sugar, the rest of the cider does not match it in 'body'. 
Hence the manufacturers are compelled to add extra sweetness to balance 
this inherent defect, as Charles notes below.

Yes, fair point - my terminology was inexact!  (I was coming from a UK 
perspective, where no apple wine above 8.5% alcohol can legally be 
described as 'cider', and has to pay higher 'made wine' excise duty). 
Technically 'fortification' is indeed the addition of alcohol after 
fermentation, while 'chaptalization' is the addition of sugar beforehand 
with the intention of allowing it to ferment to alcohol. In the UK the 
situation is even more confused since many of our medium alcohol ciders 
are heavily chaptalized as well (think about it!!).


Slightly off topic, I just bought a copy of the first translation into 
English of Chaptal's original French manual in which he described the 
technique which now bears his name. Published in Boston in 1835 as 
'Chymistry applied to Agriculture'. But Chaptal only intended the 
technique to be applied occasionally, to grapes which had ripened 
insufficiently in a poor year. Little did he know what manipulations he 
started!

The Cider Museum may be a bit of a disappointment. It's in the town
centre in one of the old Bulmers buildings and there are no trees
anywhere near.  Just a few old bits of equipment and a static display
and the obligatory shop to relieve you of your cash!.  For an
orchardist, Brogdale should be more of a draw.

Usually only by prior negotiation with the owners.

There's lot of good stuff in the Three Counties (Hereford, Worcester,
Gloucestershire), with many new progressive makers.  Some people to look
out for are Dunkertons, Olivers, Greggs Pitt, Henneys,
Minchews,Orchards, Knights etc (not meant to be an exhaustive list, and
they are not all available for visiting!).  My impression is that there
are fewer good small manufacturers in Somerset and Devon these days (but
Julian Temperley the doyen of them all is down at Burrow Hill in
Somerset), and others will slam me for saying that!.  Look at Paul
Gunningham's website for a comprehensive UK list
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/scrumpy/cider/makers.htm  Also try to get
to Geoff Morris's shop in Leominster where many otherwise rare ciders
are available for purchase and Geoff is usually available for a chat 
http://www.orchard-hive-and-vine.co.uk/


Unfortunately the CAMRA Good Cider Guide which would otherwise be
helpful is in between editions and not currently available except
perhaps secondhand.

Charles McGonegals posting on "fortified" cider makes me sad, not because he
makes a fortified cider but because he is trying to reach the market that
wants it. In doing so is his marketing plan in error? or as many will argue
"the customer is always right" ? So as a challenge to Digesters, what is the
solution?

 Brogdale  would be a waste of time. The Hereford cider museum is
interesting, however the real center of  traditional orchards  and cider is
in Somerset. If you find yourself there try Burrow Hill Cider
www.ciderbrandy.co.uk. There you will find everything you dreamed of. JT


Yes, we have 150 acres of them.
