Subject: Neem Oil?
From: "chris horn" <agent_strangelove@hotmail.com>

I have been using Neem oil of late to control the aphids that seem to like 
the new growth on my apples and pears (both the trees in the field & this 
years potted grafts).  It is working pretty well and it's not only organic, 
it supposedly good for you (but it smells like salad dressing that has gone 
off...).  It also doesn't bug the bee hives that I keep in the orchard.


My question is two fold.  I can't find any info on how the spray really 
kills the bugs.  Is it absorbed in their skin or plant absorbs it and the 
bugs eat the plant? The other question is if anyone has used this on cider 
apples and if they have gotten any carry over of odd flavors or such in the 
cider.  I plan to wash the apples but....


Thanks

I hope this is good news to all. Based on a google search our Quebec 
Cideries page seems to be one of the most popular. Since we recently took a 
3 day cider hunting trip up there over the July 4th weekend we had a chance 
to verify some of the older info, and gather new info.


Cider tourism in the area outside of Montreal is alive and well as 
agricultural tourism in that area in general. We hit about 15 cideries on a 
Sat PM, Sun PM, and Mon AM schedule. Of those we bought about 62 bottles 
from 11 different cideries. Amazingly we had no problem at the border even 
though we had the equivalent of about 4 cases of 750ml bottles (many ciders 
there are sold in 375ml or 500ml).


The highlights for us of the trip were the products from
Verger Petit et Fils - these had a most wonderful apple aroma. the girl 
there told us they pressed the flowers but didn't know any more than that. 
They make a 6% & 10%. We couldn't help but buy an entire mixed case of 
these two.


Michele Jodoin - a wonderful sparkling Rose made exclusively from Geneva 
apples. These apples have fruit that is red almost all the way through. 
This allows making a Rose cider with no other apples. It tasted great too.


La Face Cache de la Pomme - makes only ice cider. There seems to be 2 
different approaches to making ice cider in Quebec. These folks use both in 
different products. One is to leave the juice out to freeze in order to 
concentrate it. The other is to actually leave the apples to freeze on the 
trees before pressing them. Their products Firmas & Neige were both great.


Du Minot - our last stop, and fortunate too since the car was filling up 
fast! We especially liked the Cremant du Pomme a 2.5% sparkling cider. It's 
nice to find something alcoholic yet low in alcohol so that you can 
actually drink a good volume of it.


Verger La France - Cidrerable was great. A PERFECT blend of cider and maple 
syrup leaving the aromas and flavors of both in perfect balance after the 
ferment. True genius.


Well for you cider hunters, check out this page.
For you cider makers, I've been so inspired by the Quebecois technique that 
I'm hoping to try to make some of these at home this fall. I'll try to 
remember to report back on how things go.
