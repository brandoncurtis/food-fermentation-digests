Subject: Re: Neem on aphids

Chris,


Here's a good description of what's going on


http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Entomology/courses/en570/papers_1994/sclar.html


Azadirachtin, the main ingredient works through an anti-feeding action 
and an ecdysone inhibitor (an Insect Growth Regulator in broad terms).


Anyway, a couple of cautions; 


This stuff is a VERY broad spectrum insecticide, just because it's 
"organic" doesn't mean it's necessarily "soft" on beneficials.  Maybe 
some insecticidal soaps would work as well?


Second, DO NOT apply any sulfur within 2 weeks of a neem application.  
This and warm temperatures will whack your canopy.


Third, It is an Oil so you should observe caution with repeat 
applications and/or warm temps.


A related question - Are there any ants "farming" your aphids?  I have 
some second leaf trees this year that the aphids went nuts on.  Took a 
closer look and saw many ants working the aphids for honeydew.  I spread 
tanglefoot around the trunk just above the graft union and with a few 
days, the ladybird beetles had made a strong comeback and within a week, 
the aphids were nearly gone.  Pretty cool!


Luck.

Neem Oil is also used for orchids and I just happened to read an 
article about it in my latest Orchids magazine.  One of the active 
ingredients of Neem is azadirachtin.  It is known to be an 
antifeedant, most insects will not eat anything it is on.  Due to the 
smell, that will probably work for humans as well.  Many oils will 
smother insects, but only if they are applied to the insect.  Neem 
oil is supposed to have antifungal, and growth regulation properties 
as well.  I do not think that the plant absorbs any of the neem oil, 
but then, I don't eat my orchids.

In response to a question last week about neem oil, I thought I would 
ask one of my authors, Michael Phillips (who wrote The Apple Grower, 
which deals with organic orcharding). Michael is completing a full 
revision of the book as we speak, so I thought he'd be a good person to 
ask. Here is his response.

[Janitor's note:  I'm forwarding the following as it may be of interest to
folks in the NW US...it's somewhat of a commercial announcement (a tidied-up
piece of a press release) but it does cover various cidermakers.   --Dick]


WOODINVILLE, WA- Local and international cider makers will gather at Silver
Lake Winery's Woodinville facility for a public tasting event July 24 and
25, noon to five. Similar to a brewfest, the public is invited to taste a
wide range of ciders, talk to the cider makers and learn about traditional
European brands and Washington state ciders.


Drink tokens cost $6 for nine tokens or $.75 each at the winery on the
days of the event. Packaged products will also be sold and all proceeds
will benefit the Everett Firefighters Association.


Here's a rare chance to compare ciders side-by-side and be on the
forefront of a new drink trend born in the apple lands of the Pacific
Northwest. Featured ciders will be from:


Spire Mountain Draft Cider made in Bothell
Irvine's Vintage Cider and Vintage Blend made on Vashon Island
Westcott Bay Orchards Vintage Cider made on San Juan Island
Aspall Dry Cyder and Aspall Medium Cyder made in Suffolk, England
Manoir du Parc Apple and Manoir du Parc Pear Ciders made in Normandy, France
Baron Noir Dry and Baron Noir Sweet Apple Ciders made in Normandy, France


And for you aspiring cider makers, the Northwest Cider Society will share
information about the cider-making process and upcoming cider school
classes taught by Peter Mitchell.


Other non-profit organizations will be on hand to inform CiderFest visitors
about cider related topics.


During CiderFest, try another Northwest favorite to compliment the
ciders. Larry's Smokehouse will prepare smoked king salmon, Caesar salad
and hot French garlic bread for $7.50.
