Subject: Pectic Enzymes

I'm planning my fall cider at this point, and the latest issue I have 
been contemplating is pectic enzymes.  I want to make a French-style 
cider, and so I want to remove the pectin nutrients by keeving.    The 
keeving process removes methyl esters from pectin chains and these 
sites then bond with calcium ions to form a gel which rises and forms 
the chapeu brun.  But, in the wine and juice world today, the standard 
way to remove pectin is to use pectinase, a combination of enzymes that 
breaks apart the long pectin chains, and precipitates the fragments 
(right?).  The downside of these enzymes seems to be that some of the 
by-products are things that do not precipitate, and can contribute to 
off flavors.  I found the following very good tutorial on this subject:


http://www.foodproductdesign.com/archive/2003/0103AP.html


So, is the main reason why the French use the keeving method instead of 
a standard pectic enzyme because the lack of these unfortunate 
by-products, or are there other reasons such as more complete pectin 
extraction, or the fact that keeving keeps around (or, gets rid of) 
some other compounds?  In Andrew's Science of Cidermaking I read how 
keeving reduces the Nitrogen content; is there something else different 
to keeving that is somehow getting our more Nitrogen than a standard 
pectic enzyme treatment?


The key question I have in my mind is whether I should use a standard 
pectic enzyme to remove the pectin, or attempt a keeve this fall.  I 
have a bit of the magic keeving PME enzyme to experiment with but I 
still wonder if I am not better off with a normal pectinase enzyme 
since keeving often can fail, even with the added enzyme.

PS An update on my cider from last fall: I used this GrapTan tannin 
product to add some tannin to my dessert apples with the hope of 
getting some faux cider apples.  GrapTan is extracted from white wine 
grapes (skins or seeds depending on the formulation).  I combined the 
different kinds of GrapTan in my experiment.  The resulting cider is 
good in the sense that there is no "off" flavor from the tannin 
addition; the previous year I had used a lot of the standard tannin 
powder, and found it to add an unpleasant musty taste which has not 
gone away.  As far as what GrapTan adds to the flavor, it certainly at 
this point does not make anything like a cider made from cider apples.  
Mainly I would say at this point that the cider is more "aromatic", but 
without any more "body".  As it ages this could change.  All in all I 
like the taste better than without the tannin addition, so I will keep 
using GrapTan.  And, I still would much prefer to drink a cider made 
from cider apples than my faux cider apples.  Recently I have been able 
to get Weston's cider at my local liquor store, and I can finally 
confirm first-hand that some good cider is indeed made in England.
