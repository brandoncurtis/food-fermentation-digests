I have to second that observation ... whether it's pure 'cider' or chapatalized
"apple wine" ... I am constantly astounded by the marked improvement ...
dramatic improvement that happens after a 3 month / 6 month 'rest' in the bottle
or cask

I'm really pleased to hear you say that Tim. My recent experience with 
'wild yeast' fermentation followed by MLF is just the same.  In fact, it 
makes me wonder why so many cider competitions (at least in the UK) are 
held in May when 'real' ciders are nowhere near at their best.  Even our 
cider tasting day at Long Ashton was always held in June. It makes me 
think that the traditional timings are based on other aspects of the 
agricultural year and have no real relation to cider quality. Either 
that, or it's the fact that much poorly made 'traditional' cider in 
wooden casks starts to go badly acetic in the summer so the spring was 
the best (or the 'least worst') time to taste it.  With any luck it 
would be in active MLF at that time so it would be a wee bit 'petillant' 
or 'spritzig' too (why do we have no proper English word for that 
condition? - 'sparkling' is too ambiguous nowadays).  Anyone else have 
an opinion on this?

Spot on, there!  Note that the reason calcium is so effective is that
it's divalent so it can link across two long chains. That's how the 3-D
gel network is set up. A monovalent ion wouldn't work. A trivalent ion
like aluminium works even better! A key extra point is that the
macromolecular gel "salt" floats to the top of the vessel, buoyed up by
carbon dioxide bubbles from the slow incipient fermentation (French
factory keeving uses introduced nitrogen bubbles). Then you rack the
juice from underneath the floating gel.


You also asked about doing this with grapes. I've never heard of it and
I don't think it will work. First, grapes contain far less pectin than
apples.  Second, grapes contain about ten times as much free amino
nitrogen as apples.  So it would have to be a truly massive keeve to be
effective - and I don't believe it could cope.


The only other food system I know of where this concept is or has been
used is in the  spontaneous traditional clarification of lime juice in
Dominica. The PME's in the juice do just the same job as in apple but
here it *is* clarification which is the objective.  I understand the
process took several months but resulted in a brilliant clear juice.
There is no yeast fermentation since the pH is so low, and hence the
pectin drops to the bottom of the vat (you can observe this with
fresh-pressed orange juice at home too if you keep it for a few days).
However, I believe this traditional process is now obsolete since added
enzymes have replaced it.

Hmm - an interesting suggestion.  There are many forms of commercial
pectin powder depending on the fruit they come from and the way they've
been processed.  So you'd have to be quite careful which pectin to choose.

Yup that definitely works. If you leave the milled pulp for 24 hours
before pressing, more pectin diffuses out from between the cell walls
where it lives and ends up as 'soluble' in the juice. Also it helps if
the apples themselves are fully mature and rich in soluble pectin
already.  The accessibility of pectin changes a lot as apples mature in
store off the tree. According to the French literature only fully mature
mid- to late-season apples are suitable for keeving.  Also they
recommend an SG  greater than 1.055, which would help the 'chapeau' to
float better.

The skin to flesh ratio is actually quite low and it's unlikely that
significant tannins leach out of the skin, though they can be extracted
with alcohol.  What does happen during maceration is more oxidation and
polymerisation of the tannins back onto the pulp so the amounts in the
final juice tend to diminish. The actual extent depends on the degree of
aeration.  Tightly packed apple pulp goes very brown on the surface but
can be quite colourlesss just half an inch down.

The recommendation comes from the old French booklet 'Comment faire du
bon cidre'.  I think calcium chloride is preferable if you can get it -
for one thing you're not introducing any sodium -  but it probably
doesn't make a whole heap of difference. The point is that chalk and
salt were more commonly available than was calcium chloride. The salt is
the least important part.  I have used just the carbonate on its own and
so did some Long Ashton trials in the 1950's - the key thing is the
calcium to ensure sufficient complexation.

Here's a link to a demonstration picture of a keeve - what Gary Awdey 
calls 'a brain in a jar'!  It's not the best picture but it'll have to 
do for now till someone gets a better one next season!

Hi folks ,


there's a news item at the Toronto Star .   http://tinyurl.com/3mdyy
    "Apples losing genetic diversity : Scientists decry genetic 
similarity of today's apples"


"The apple, the world's second-most popular fruit after the banana, is being
selectively bred toward monotonous, boring sameness. Mouth-watering taste
is being sacrificed in favour of enhanced colour, prolonged shelf life,
resistance to disease and physical resilience against bruising when being
transported great distances. The ongoing focus on apple qualities other
than flavour has doomed to extinction a huge proportion of the varieties
historically grown, not only in North America, but globally. Apple
varieties are passing into oblivion so fast that in North America some
16 varieties make up more than 90 per cent of domestic production; four
varieties account for almost 70 per cent of the continental market ..."

No experience w/  YM directly, but I grow a lot of apples. It sounds like 
you are looking for the rootstock to impart some sort of FB resistance to 
the scion, but this doesn't happen.  Yes, M7 is fairly resistant. That 
explains why when you get strikes in the top of the tree they don't 
immediately get down to the root system and kill the whole thing.  With a 
susceptible rootstock/cultivar combination(the classic is Gala on M9) the 
inevitable infection goes straight down into the root system and quickly 
kills the tree dead. If the scion cultivar is suscebtible, however, it is 
so on any rootstock.

Removing strikes ASAP is the best way to deal with FB once it strikes.  The 
'ugly stub' method works best, where you cut the strike out 4-6 inches 
below the apparent infection, leaving a stub about six inches 
long.  Flagging these stubs may be helpful, as you'll want to cut them off 
on your coldest, driest dormant pruning day.  This two-stage process helps 
to remove the bulk of the active inoculum in the tree.  Your next 
management choice would be to apply a dormant copper spray, thoroughly 
covering ALL trees in the orchard, as some others may carry the bacteria on 
their surface. You can concern yourself with bloom sprays only after 
tending to these other two first.

My guess is that you have some inocolum localized in the orchard, and it 
may  either not be getting fully cut out of the trees or harbored on other 
trees which are resistant and so do not exhibit infection.  You also may 
want to look closely on the YM's to see if there are any trunk or limb 
cankers which harbor the disease. More FB info can be found here:

I'd grow it anyway, but be ready to apply copper regularly and have those 
shears ready when the strikes show...
