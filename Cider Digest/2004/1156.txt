Out here we have an annual "Apple Show" in mid-September, when only a few 
apples have ripened.  Apparently it's just so they can combine it with the 
county fair, but is sure is frustrating to me.  I guess it would be tough 
to get people to come out for a fair in mid-November when all my late 
varieties finally ripen...


Maybe the cider tastings are held in May/June because it would all be drunk 
up by fall!


Cheers,
Tim
