Subject: A cedar "cave"
From: Donald Davenport <djdavenport@earthlink.net>

There is a well-insulated space that I would like to set up as a 
fermentation room.  It was previously a clothes locker and the whole 
thing is lined in cedar.


I know there are certain prohibitions against apple storage in places 
where there are strong odors because of the ease with which the apples 
can become tainted.


Would there be any problem with using a space that's pretty heavy with 
cedar?  Or does it matter, once things are in vessels, airlocked, and 
bubbling away?


I'm just not sure I want people commenting about the not-so-subtle 
notes of cedar.  On the other hand, I guess moths wouldn't be a 
problem.


Any thoughts?


Thanks,


Donald Davenport

Dear Gentle Cider Makers,


I ask your advice on "sealing" cider fermentation containers with CO2.


I recently read a brief article on the use of CO2 gas, floated over the top 
of fermenting cider, to act as a seal.  I understand that this is how it was 
done in day's gone by, with success.  I have a 40 gallon food grade plastic 
container with a non-air-tight lid that I'd like to try CO2 sealing, but I 
want cider, not vinegar.


Your thoughts and opinions would be greatly appreciated.


With regards,
