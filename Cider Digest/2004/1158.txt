I often use CO2 to purge empty carboys, sometimes even bottles if I'm 
feeling real anal.  also use it to float over the top of a partially-filled 
carboy, as well as in my oak barrel, but all of those seal pretty well.  If 
you're using an open-top or poorly sealed fermenter for your secondary I 
would probably tend to add co2 (or better yet, Argon) to help things but 
I'd look to the root of the problem and try to et the thing to seal. I've 
used 55 gallon HDPE plastic barrels before, but only on their sides where 
the curve of the container allows for me to fill right up to the seal and 
minimize surface area contact.  I would avoid using them vertically, 
because the headspace is just too much.


That's my $0.02.

Jan asked about using CO2  as  a seal over fermenting cider and my 
experience is against trying it .  
       I  got a several stainless steel 40 litre kegs to use as pressure 
vessels a few years ago. These had been used in a commercial operation 
and the seals  were in rather poor shape although I didn't realize it at 
the time and filled them for a secondary fermentation . A couple of them 
sealed with the CO2 given off during the secondary but a couple didn't 
and gas leaked out over a period of monthe without my realizing. I would 
have supposed that enough CO2 would have remained over the cider to 
preserve it but these two became so oxidised as to be undrinkable . And 
these were not loose fitting lids! When I put the lids on and tightened 
them down by the screw system they used , they had appeared to seal as 
well as the others . 
       The two kegs that developed pressure were good cider . 
       The spoiled kegs didn't go to vinegar as they might have done if 
the lids had been completely loose .
       I also have had the experience of comparing cider bottled with 
sugar addition in plastic two litre pop bottles with the same cider in 
glass . The pop bottles developed lots of CO2 pressure but there was a 
distinct loss of quality after several months. It had a staleness to it 
while the cider in glass still tasted fresh.

Jan Davis asked about using a CO2 blanket as an oxygen barrier.


I can probably give as better response to this as a chemist (my profession)
than as a cidermaker (still an avocation :-).


Jan notes that CO2 above an  _active_ fermentation does a good job of
displacing oxygen in the space above it.  I have certainly observed this.
But I think the key is that the fermentation is actively evolving CO2 and
hence constantly displacing any air that diffuses into the container.


But the sticker is what happens once the fermentation stops.  As the cider
becomes still, it may retain a lot of CO2 in solution - but with nothing to
disturb it, that's just where it stays - in solution.


As a chemist, I can say that in the lab we use argon as an inert blanket.
It's heavier than air, so it settles into place.  And it has a density
different enough from air that it is somewhat resistant to dilution by
simple diffusion.


Even with an argon blanket, I would be reluctant to age cider more than a
very few months in a gas-leaky container.

Jan,
        If the container isn't airtight, you'll have to periodically apply
come CO2 to the headspace of the container to keep out O2.  Normal cooling
and heating of the room which the fermentor is in will draw in O2 and
expell CO2.  I have no idea how often you'll have to flush the container
with gas, but I can tell you fronm my experience with white wine
production that oxidative browning doesn't take as long as I originally
thought.
