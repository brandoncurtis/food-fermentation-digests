Subject: Last Call for PME Sample
From: "Gary Awdey" <gawdey@att.net>
Date: Mon, 30 Aug 2004 20:45:59 -0400


For any who may be thinking of a trial keeve this year using pectin methyl
esterase (PME)  I'll be taking requests through the end of this week (Sat.,
Sept. 4) and packaging them up this weekend. (If you somehow missed the
earlier discussion you can find most of it in Cider Digest postings #1151 -
1155.)   This will be coming out of a larger free sample provided by one of
two domestic suppliers (or both if you specifically request it).  I'm
planning to include a data sheet that gives recommended dosage for the PME
and calcium chloride (you can do your own conversions if you prefer to use
calcium carbonate), as well as supplier product data sheets and Material
Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's).  Once packaged I'll be sending them out on the
first reasonably cool day (to minimize the likelihood of loss of activity
due to excessive temperature).  These are free, I only ask that you consider
sharing anything noteworthy in your results (good or bad) in future postings
so others can benefit from your experience.  Be sure to give a rough idea of
how much cider you may be making with a PME keeve.  If in doubt estimate on
the high side so you won't have later regrets when your plans become more
ambitious (Scott Smith has offered to share his supply if there is
sufficient interest to use up all the surplus that I have on hand).  Send an
email message to me at gawdey@att.net.  Be sure also to include your mailing
address (I won't share that information with anyone else except possibly
Scott).

Further to the discussion on ripeness of apples and iodine test. I have
found reference to this test in my notes to the now defunction online
cider course from Penshore college. I believe this was the course Peter
was leading before the course closure, but I havn't any deytails re
strength of iodine to use, how to use it etc. Andrew can you supply the
nitty gritty please for all of us budding chemists?  Regards Trevor

        Commercially,Spraying an apple cut across the middle, with an
Iodine solution is one of the primary indicators of when to pick, the
other is punching with a pressure tester. I suppose you want as much
starch converted to sugar consistent with the ability to grind the apple
to press to out the juice. When all of the starch is converted (no black
where sprayed with the Iodine solution) you are running the risk of a
mealy apple that is difficult to juice. When I pick for my roadside stand
I pick for flavor(not long term storage) and for most varieties that is
when there is some unconverted starch near the outside and a few 
blotches toward the inside, these areas show up as black or grey when
sprayed with the iodine indicator solution. This test solution is readily
available in commercial orchard areas(I live in apple producing area of
North Central Washington) but I'm sure you could dilute tincture of
iodine with water and that would last a long time. I use an expired
window wash spray bottle to spray the cut apple.
        As for pressure testing, do it the age old way, press the apple
with end of your thumb and if it gives with a snap that apple is mature
and ready to pick. If your thumb dents the apple with only modest
pressure and no snap the apple is over ripe, on the other hand if it
takes a lot of pressure to dent the apple and there is only give but no
snap then that apple is immature and needs to hang a while longer.

I doubt that you're just being lucky though I don't have any references at
hand that discuss this specifically for cider.  There seems to be more
information pertaining to commercial production of wine.  According to the
HANDBOOK OF ENOLOGY, Vol. 1 (P. Ribereau-Gayon et al, 2000, translated by
Jeffrey M. Branco, Jr., ISBN 0471 97362 9) nitrogen is one of three gases
authorized for storage of wine (as you may have expected from the discussion
to date the other two are argon and carbon dioxide).   Argon is rarely used
because of cost and very low solubity.  Carbon dioxide is very soluble in
wine and is sometimes mixed with nitrogen (eg 85% nitrogen and 15% carbon
dioxide) to prevent the degassing of certain wines that must maintain a
moderate carbon dioxide concentration.  For wine nitrogen is the most
commonly used gas and (still citing Ribereau-Gayon) the small amount of
oxygen that occurs in "R" quality nitrogen has no impact on wine.  I'm not
sure about general preferences in New Zealand but in North America they seem
to call for more carbon dioxide in cider than in wine.  Assuming you'd want
at least a small amount of carbon dioxide, unless the cider is completely
dry or pasturized I'd expect some carbon dioxide to be generated during
storage and wouldn't worry much about displacing it with unmixed nitrogen.

Dick asked about ripeness testing, and then suggested a simple iodine test 
(reacts with starch) - can't believe that never occurred to me!!  I suspect 
it doesn't show up in many books because most authors really don't think 
about this problem; you are just supposed to know when your apples are ripe.


I have the same problem as Dick - lots of varieties, none of which are 
grown around here by anyone else, and an odd climate.  I've been testing 
mainly by tasting for starch.  But Dick correctly notes that this can be 
difficult with cider apples; I made this same point to my wife just a 
couple of days ago, while trying to decide when to pick some Kingston 
Blacks.  These are so tannic and so strongly-flavored that it's hard to 
detect the starch as they get close to ripeness.


So, I'm off to the chemist, as Andrew might say, for some iodine!

p.s.  Just picked Hewes Virginia Crab - first crop from the trees planted 
three years ago.  Looked like bunches of cherries!  Smell good, 
too.  Planning to press in the next couple of weeks.

Nitrogen *is* used in the wine and cider industries for blanketing. 
There are natty little membrane systems on the market which selectively 
pluck the nitrogen out of the air (78%) on demand, and pressurise it all 
ready to pump to wherever you want - you don't have to order a cylinder 
or a dewar flask of liquid nitrogen - it's always ready and the raw 
material is still free (they don't tax air - yet!).  The advantage of 
CO2 and argon is that they're denser than nitrogen (which has much the 
same density as air and so tends to drift away) so they'll stay where 
they're put for longer and will tend to fall downwards into the bottom 
of a vessel.  A further (possible advantage) of CO2 is that it actually 
disssolves in the drink to a very significant extent and most ciders and 
wines are actually improved by being at saturation with CO2 (even if 
nominally 'still').  Other inert gases?  Krypton and xenon sound rather 
fun!  Radon might make a cider quite interesting!  Sadly, I think the 
only practicable ones are the ones we already discussed!

The interesting part about that (see e.g. 
http://www.gov.on.ca/OMAFRA/english/crops/facts/00-025.htm ) is that the 
commercial
growers are deliberately pitching to harvest under-ripe, to put the 
fruit into gas store. So they don't wait for all the iodine colour to
disappear - whereas we cidermakers do.

It is curious, somehow.  Perhaps your typical craft cidermaker just
'knows in his bones' when the fruit is ripe!   I know that the large
cidermakers monitor the starch to sugar conversion like hawks (but not
with iodine, which isn't sensitive enough for them).  More fermentable
sugar in the fruit means less they have to buy in to get the alcohol
level they need!

In regard to the recent question about using starch iodine tests for 
apple maturity, there is a bulletin available from Cornell University 
with detailed information about maturation and ripening of apples, 
preparing the potassium iodine formulation, with illustrations of 
fruit starch patterns that are useful for interpreting the resulting 
patterns to derive a numerical "starch index" of harvest maturity.


The publication is Information Bulletin No. 221, "Predicting harvest 
date windows for apples," by G.D. Blandpied and K.J. Silsby. It can 
be ordered from the resource center online for $5.75 at 
<www.cce.cornell.edu/store/customer/home.php?cat=439 >.


Interpreting the starch patterns is problematic, because each apple 
variety reaches "optimal" harvest maturity at a different starch 
index (usually between 3.5 and 6.0), and the patterns vary from year 
to year even for the same variety.  A more low-tech approach is to 
walk through your orchard daily as harvest time approaches, tasting 
each variety to check for development of its characteristic flavor 
and aromatic traits, slicing fruit to look at seed browning, watching 
for the onset of drop (many of the bittersweets will drop most of 
their fruit as it ripens). The underlying skin groundcolor transition 
from greenish to cream white or yellow is a reliable indicator of 
ripening, that is independent of red or orange blush (which is an 
effect of direct sunlight on the fruit that often occurs well in 
advance of ripening).


If you can store your cider apples in a cooler around 3 to 5 degrees 
C for a month or so before pressing them, they will mellow (ethylene 
from the most ripe fruit induces ripening in the less mature fruit) 
and most of the remaining starch will hydrolyse to sugar, improving 
your cider yields.

Subject: Carbonating "small" batches of cider
From: "J. K. Davis" <andiroba@hotmail.com>

Gentle Cider Makers:


A question regarding the best way to carbonate smaller batches of cider, 
e.g, 50 gallons or less.


I've search the Internet and cider references, and haven't been able to 
locate any suggestions on equipments or methodology of carbonating cider 
beyond the adding sugar at bottling.  I am loath to do that because of the 
lack of control.  May I ask your opinions on a method to do this?

I use iodine for testing apples all the time.  Since you're generally 
looking for full ripeness with cider fruit, I'd test the fruit weekly until 
you see the core and some flesh turn white, then twice weekly after 
that.  Once the entire surface of the (horizontally) cut fruit is all 
white, then there is no starch left.  Note however, that some varieties 
don't respond well to this test.  Fuji is my only example...I've never used 
it on cider fruit.


UMASS offers an explanation here:
http://www.umass.edu/fruitadvisor/clements/articles/sitest.htm


And a place to get iodine and charts, if needed:
http://www.cascadeanalytical.com/agriculture_svcs/agricult.htm#maturity


Note that the charts are used because commercially packed and stored fruit 
should be pocked before they are dead-ripe.  I assume cider fruit would 
want to be as ripe as possible.
Also, note that the iodine solution is considered toxic, and handle 
appropriately.  I don't know if drugstore iodine tincture is the same as 
the saturated potassium iodine solution I use...I make it from the recipe 
mentioned at the end of the UMASS article.
