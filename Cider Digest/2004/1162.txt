Subject: enterprise press -- good for apples?

Hi folks,


Today I stumbled across an Enterprise press, an antique cast-iron, 
screw press (~2 gallons) with crank handle and three plates (two solid, 
one sieve) that looked like it might be a good starter press for 
cider.  I've just planted my first 7 apple trees, so am anticipating 
the need a bit... but it seemed reasonably priced at $97.50.  My 
question is... will it be any good for apples?  Or is this solely for 
sausages or some other purpose?


Any thoughts you can provide would be appreciated.


Katie

I don't know if this is the answer you're looking for, but one feature 
about blanketing (as opposed to forcing) is that the solubility of CO2 
in wine or cider is quite high.  So you can have about 2 grams of gas 
per litre dissolved in the drink (which confers a major benefit on 
flavour) before there are any bubbles or any overt 'fizz' is 
perceptible.  (Fizz is supersaturation which can only be held in by some 
sort of top-pressure or capping). Blanketing not only keeps air out, but 
also allows CO2 to saturate (though not 'carbonate') the drink.  Both 
are generally seen as good things.  Many still white wines are 
deliberately brought up to saturation CO2 levels before bottling 
nowadays for just this reason.

Hello All,
I have either planted or am getting ready to plant the following varities
for my cider orchard.  Is there any growing/fruiting/care charcteristics
specific to these varities that I might need to be aware of?  I figure
someone might have some insights....


Ashmead's Kernel
Cox's Orange Pippin
Foxwhelp
Grimes Golden
Kingston Black
Pitmaston Pineapple
Porters Perfection
Yarlington Mill
Hidden Rose
Golden Russet

A bit more on when to pick, we use a heat unit model based on data compiled
from a near by weather reporting station to calculate heat units. The daily
highs and lows are divided by 2 and the heat units above 50 degrees F are
recorded and summed. I do this on a weekly basis between April 1 and October
31. Granted this model does not tell you when the fruit is ripe but does
provide a planning tool for forecasting and planning fruit harvest. We start
getting serious about picking when the heat units approach 1750. This year
for example, our harvest period is about 10 days ahead of last year. In
addition we check seed color, taste and fruit drop, even testing SG if in
doubt. I use a spread sheet to keep the data from year to year and find that
you can pretty much predict when a particular variety will need to be
picked. In our orchard the Foxwelps are first, followed by the Brown's etc.
The Porters which hang well are last.
