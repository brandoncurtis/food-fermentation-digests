I grow most of these, so I'll offer what little I know.  It would help if 
you could tell us where you are located, or at least what USDA climate 
zone.  I'm in Zone 9, so my climate is a little different than most; in the 
fog belt, with cool damp summers.  Scab is a major problem here, and 
sometimes I don't get enough chill for some varieties.  Others on this list 
may be able to advise on cold-hardiness (my low temps are in the high 20s!).


Looks like a great blend!


>Ashmead's Kernel


Vigorous, upright grower.  (Train as open-center tree.)  Doesn't seem to 
need much chill.  Bears heavily in good years, tends to 
biennialism.   Fruit is large; thin fruit until branches are 
well-developed.  (I never got around to thinning this year and have broken 
branches as a result.)   Appears to be resistant to scab.  Ripens early to 
mid-season (early October here).  Falls off when ripe.  Doesn't keep all 
that well if fully tree-ripened.  Very sweet when full-ripe and sweated.


>Cox's Orange Pippin


Weak grower, spreading habit, wide crotch angles (train as 
center-leader).  Low-chill.  Moderately scab susceptible.  Slow to 
produce.  Ripens early (first of October for me).  Fruit cracking is a 
problem for me.  Despite the wonderful flavor, I am reworking my Cox's over 
to other varieties.  Karmijn de Sonneville might be a better choice - fruit 
quality is similar but larger, tougher, less prone to scab and cracking, 
and the tree is very vigorous.  Both fall off when fully ripe.  Sweet and 
sharp.


>Foxwhelp


Hmmm... I think my Foxwhelps are not true, they are "Fauxwhelps" as Dick 
says!   Slow-growing trees, train as center leader.  Extremely large 
fruit.  Ripens very early, mid-Sept.  Moderate chill requirements.  Doesn't 
keep.  Falls off when ripe.  Sweet.


>Grimes Golden


An excellent tree, vigorous and spreading, train as open-center and give it 
room.  Precocious and productive, bears well every year.  Low chill 
requirement.  Not scab susceptible, but very susceptible to powdery 
mildew.  Ripens mid-season (mid-Oct here) and hangs onto the tree quite 
well.  Turns lemon-yellow when ripe, very pretty on tree.  Keeps fairly 
well.  Sweet and sharp.


>Kingston Black


An interesting tree to grow; its growth habit varies from tree to tree.  I 
have best luck training them as open-center trees.  Moderately vigorous, no 
chill problems, only moderately scab susceptible.  Thin fruit in good years 
to 2 per cluster.  Drops quite a few before ripe.  Ripens very early, 
mid-September here.  Doesn't keep well.  Fruit size variable, small to 
medium.  Very bitter and sharp.


>Pitmaston Pineapple


No experience.


>Porters Perfection


Compact tree with upright habit; grow as open-center and prune carefully 
when young to encourage branching and spreading.   Not a vigorous 
grower.  Bears very heavily and needs thinning.  Small fruit, hangs onto 
tree very well.  Ripens late Oct.  Somewhat susceptible to powdery 
mildew.  Keeps well.  Bittersharp.


>Yarlington Mill


Moderately vigorous and spreading habit, train as open center or modified 
center-leader.  Low chill.  Heavy bearer, medium-size fruit, very aromatic, 
hangs onto tree fairly well.  Not particularly scabby.  Ripens late Oct 
here.  Doesn't keep well - sweat for a month at most.  Bittersweet.


>Hidden Rose


Never heard of it!


>Golden Russet


Extremely vigorous - give it plenty of room or grow it on dwarfing 
rootstock; mine are on M111 and are already about 12 feet tall (5 years 
old).  Spreading habit, wide crotch angles, can be grown as open center or 
center-leader.  Precocious and productive.  Thin fruit or support branches 
when young.  Low chill.  Not susceptible to scab or mildew.  A great 
tree!  Fruit medium size, ripens very late (early November here).  Drops a 
few before they are ripe; be patient.  Keeps well.  Very Sweet and sharp 
when picked, sharpness mellows in storage.  I made an 8% ABV cider from 
these last year.  In a hotter climate it might have been 10%!

Sorry to be a bit late on this, but I think the other reason for holding
cider and perry competitions at the beginning of May is so that the publicity
for the winners will lead to increased sales that summer. I believe that is
why CAMRA hold their National Cider and Perry Championships at the
beginning of May.


I have often held that August would be a better time, and the best venue
would be the Peterborough Beer Festival, which is the second-biggest CAMRA
festival in the country, and is also in the east of England. This would
help to take the perception of cider away from the West Country.


I find that I sell more cider later in the summer than earlier.

Subject: Apple crusher/masher/shredder
From: "Martin Stokes" <Mstokes@apollo.umenfa.maine.edu>
Date: Fri, 10 Sep 2004 09:16:12 -0500


I have made cider for many years but find difficulty in obtaining 
juice made from a satisfactory blend of apples in my area.  There is 
a lot of Mac/Cortland etc. but little else, and it is expensive.  Last 
winter I acquired a pneumatic cider press in the hope that I might 
be able to purchase specific varieties to produce my own sweet 
cider for fermentation.
Unfortunately I have no way of crushing the apples prior to pressing 
and wish to get input from my fellow cider-makers on the best types 
of crushers, possible sources, and typical prices.  I would prefer 
110 volt models rather than 220 as I have outside 110 outlets so I  
can do all of this in the driveway.
Any help would be most appreciated.

You have a lot of varieties which will give you sufficient acidity,
(Foxwelp, Ashmeads's, Cox, Kingston & Porters) a bittersweet(Yarlington) and
I am not familiar with the rest. Assuming they are all on the same rootstock
I would suggest roughly 40-45% be bittersharp or sharp (<ph 3.8) and the
balance sweet or bittersweet or sweet (ph>4.0).


Keep the nitrogen in balance, the Foxwelps & Cox are prone to bitterpit if
there is a lot of free nitrogen in the soil.
