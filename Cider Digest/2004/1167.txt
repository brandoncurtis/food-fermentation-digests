Help please.


1st year of doing cider. 1st batch in 5 gallon fermenting vessel and 99.00% 
cooking apples. Brew located in garden shed and ambient temp 10-15c. Started 
off great and then stopped. Added sugar and more yeast and went great for a 
few days but now stopped again. Coming to conclusion that no sugar left for 
yeast and temp too low. Are we correct.?

G-day to all


I have question relating to quinces and quince wine. 
As quinces are a sort of pome fruit and share a lot of the 
characteristics of both apples and pears, has anyone ever tried making 
wine (Cider) out of them ????  
Is there a history of doing so and does it have a name, (apples-cider, 
pears-perry) etc.
I've put down about 100 Lts. of the stuff, primarily to add tannin to 
cider made from desert type apples. Truth is, it ain't half bad on its 
own, and certainly has plenty of tannin to go around. 
I mill it and press it exactly the same as apples for cider, though they 
tend to be a bit on the woody side, and don't give their juice easily. 
(barely 35 to 40 Lts of juice per 100 Lts. of pulp, if you are lucky) 
Although the end result might be a bit too differant for some tastes, 
its growing on me, and I think it is worthwhile.

I have just joined the Cider Digest and am happy to find this group of
fellow cider devotees. I have a relatively small (100 tree) apple orchard in
Southeast Michigan. Some of the trees are "wild" apples which I have pruned
and/or grafted over the last 15 years. I therefore prefer to describe them
as "to be named" instead of "wild". The rest of the trees are a selection of
varieties, many regarded as "antique", that I have planted geared toward
providing a good cider mix.
For many years I have custom pressed my apples in an old local cider mill
owned by a friend. I typically did two pressings, using early and later
varieties, and produced a total of 200-250 gallons per year. Unfortunately,
the FDA regulations now make it impossible to do custom pressing of
unpasteurized cider and no local mill can allow me to do it. I am now
considering buying a press and grinder for my own use. I wonder if anyone
has found a good source for such equipment?

I have gotten Golden Russet trees from two different sources....  This is 
the first year that they have produced fruit.  They are different apples. 
Several trees were over runs from a guy's order from Cummings and several 
were out of the Julibee farm give away.


"The New Book of Apples" talks of Beach (Apples of NY) stating that there 
were two Golden Russets.  One being English and the other one being Western 
New York.....  Any one have both types or are they really that different???  
I don't have a copy of Beach to see what he really says about that....


Thanks

Every now and then I peruse the labels of the 6-pack ciders--to see if
there's anything new or anything I've missed in the past.  Had a look just
yesterday.  Could somebody who understands the industry connections
explain?...


Apparently, Middlebury, Vermont is the cider capital of the western
hemisphere!  Seems surprising for a town that my road atlas tells me is
about 6000 population.  All of the Woodchuck products, all of the Cider
Jack products, and Woodpecker and Strongbow seem to come from Middlebury.


Well, OK, Woodchuck isn't surprising--it's been a New England product all
along, AFAIK...Green Mountain Cidery.


Woodpecker and Strongbow are Bulmer products, and there was this alliance
between Green Mountain and Bulmer.  Anybody know if that's still real?
I'd heard that Bulmer was going to be pulling back from its US market
(or some such).  Does this leave the Bulmer products in the hands of Green
Mountain for the US, or will they eventually disappear (or what:-)?


I'd had the impression in the past that Cider Jack was a separate brand.
Was I mistaken, or were they acquired?  (Or is it just coincidence that
they're located in the same town as their big competitors?)


Seriously, what I'm hoping is that somebody who understands the who-does-
what-to-whom can explain the business structure/relations of these
cidermakers.
