For those who do not know, Bulmers fell on very hard times and in mid 
2003 they became a subsidiary of the UK brewer Scottish and Newcastle 
(S&N).  I understand they have sold all their non-UK operations except 
Cidre Stassen in Belgium.  The following was posted on <justdrinks.com> 
last year.  Whether this is sufficient to explain Dick's Middlebury 
mystery I do not know!

Article Summary:
Additional reporting By Anne Brockhoff The UK cider company HP Bulmer 
has sold its US operation based in Vermont for an undisclosed price. 
Talking to just-drinks, a company spokesman said a newly created 
organisation called Green Mountain Beverages, which includes several 
current employees of Bulmers USA, supported by individual investors, has 
taken over the business."

I was interested to read this - does "perry" mean that in the USA? In the UK
"perry" means what I understand you in the US would call "pear cider", i.e.
drink made from pear juice. A drink made from a mixture of apple and pear
juice has been called "pider" but I don't believe this term is in general
use!

I'd also be interested to know whether anything drinkable can be made from
quince. Of course Quincy is a white wine from the Loire valley in France, so
a drink of that name does exist ;-)

The illustrious Andrew Lea provided some most excellent advice regarding
SG, acidity ; SO2 additions  and U/V sterilization utility / application,
on UKcider.  In the event that some of Janitor Dick's readership does
not follow that other board (UKcider), perhaps he could be persuaded to
cut and paste his commentary on the subjects above from his sent folder?
I found the information particularly on acidity, very, very useful.

I've made quince wine by grinding the quince in a food 
disposal like I do my apples and pears.  After grinding, 
I put the pulp in a nylon bag, added sugar, etc. as you do
in wine making.  The wine is very aromatic and tastes 
fine but it not something you would drink often.


Quinces are members of the pome family along with apples, 
pears and medlars.  I've also made medlar wine which is also 
aromatic in a different way.  Quinces and medlars are fun 
but I'm sticking with apples and pears.

In response to the fellow who wasn't sure if his cider was done fermenting, 
Ben suggested:

Careful!  If the cider is in fact completely fermented, then this procedure 
is virtually guaranteed to give you vinegar!


Go spend $3 on a hydrometer and check the SG.  If it is less than 1.005, 
you're done - bottle the stuff (leaving no headspace).  If it's higher, 
then you could probably follow Ben's advice to restart fermentation.  Or 
you could try racking it carefully into a secondary fermenter with no 
headspace at all, and wait a few weeks to see if it really is finished, in 
which case you would have a finished cider with some residual sugar - which 
some of us would sell our grandmothers to achieve.


Usually oxygen is to be avoided like the plague once the initial 
fermentation is over, because Acetobacter will use the oxygen to convert 
alcohol into acetic acid.

Tim

I find myself in the same predicament as Donald Shelton. Here in CT, the
Health Dept.has over- reacted to the possibility of E.Coli in cider and
requires that all apples for cider be verified by an orchardist to be hand
picked.  In other words, the tons of "drops" on the ground can no longer be
used for cider by a commercial mill.  Speculation is that the Health Dept.
here also plans to require that all cider be pasteurized in the near future.
This will require all cider lovers to begin to acquire their own equipment.
I am planning to build my own press from info obtained from your archives
but I need to find some leads on the availability of a good grinder.  I
contacted one currant producer of backyard mills but because they are
already behind in orders, they didn't feel that they could provide outside
needs at this time.


I also want to thank you for mentioning the annual two day "Cider day" event
in MA.  Even though I live only two hours away, I had never heard of it.  I
have scheduled to attend in Nov., hoping to be able to pick up info on back
yard cider making.

Subject: PME Keeving experiment
From: "Ira Edwards" <ira_j_e@hotmail.com>

Hopefully this makes it into the digest, I seem to be having problems
with sending TEXT ONLY messages from outlook to the forum...


Gary Awdey suggested that I share what has happened so far in my keeving
attempt, with the hope that it might create more discussion and maybe
some of you might lend some suggestions for me and others.
 
==========================
After receiving  the PME sample, I made 40 gallons of apple juice on
Sunday and used the PME to try and keeve 15 gallons.  I have a couple of
questions for you on procedures.  I used the Crystalzyme diluted 100:1
in water and misted my pomace as I ground it. The few remaining mL went
into the juice of my blend.  I have added a pectic enzyme (the generic
stuff) to my pomace to increase my juice output for the last 2 years and
I have gotten about 10% more juice out of my 8 ton birch wood rack and
cheese press.  This trial was good for that as well, as I got even
better juice extraction than usual ( but we had a great summer and that
may have contributed).


So I added the CaCl to the juice after 8 hours at 45F and it gelled up
immediately, quite the chemical reaction as when I mixed up the CaCl in
some juice before adding it to the vat.  My sterilized jar heated up so
much when mixing the CaCl and a bit of juice that it got uncomfortably
hot in like 10 seconds.  Upon adding this to the vat of 15 gallons of
juice it raised the temp 0.2 degrees C.  Not enough to kill off any
yeast, but quite the exothermic reaction.
 
My question is on bubbling with nitrogen to raise the chapeau bruin
(sp).  In the last few years, my natural yeast ciders took 1-2 weeks to
start really fermenting, and by settling out the nutrients I am
imagining that it will take even longer.I have read about Bubbling N2
gas to raise the brown gel mass.  Do you have any tips?  I have the
juice in a covered open fomenter, but I'm not sure if the juice will be
safe for a few weeks, even in my clean fermenting area and wanted to
speed the process along to seal it up in my stainless 55Litre keg to
ferment.  I have a Nitrogen tank and regulator, and a stainless
oxygenating wand for my beer making.
 
Assuming all of this turns out well, I'll send Gary some bottled samples
next fall for his tastings.  This blend has always made my best cider so
I'm going for it on a trial size for the keeving experiment.  I made and
equivalent amount of cider the way I've done in the past and the rest of
my other apples will go into other blends for trying new recipies.  I'm
going to press another batch next weekend while working on finishing up
my ski/gear shed....


Thanks again to Gary for the sample and for any help the rest of you can
provide
