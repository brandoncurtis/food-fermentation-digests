It's kind of you to say so, John, but I would rather not clutter up 
'Dick's Digest' by re-posting answers to questions which were not asked 
here!  However, the UK Cider Google Groups transactions are available 
online for public viewing at http://groups-beta.google.com/group/ukcider 
, where it is possible to search by poster's name and to browse the 
results in date order!

Here in GB, Customs & Excise allow a maximum of 25% pear juice in cider or 
apple juice in perry. So here in GB anything between 25% apple juice and 25% 
pear juice did not have a name until it was decided to call it pider.


I'm not entirely clear what a fermented mixture of apple juice and honey is 
called, but I'd assumed it was called cyser or ciser which I find from my 
Oxford English Dictionary is the old name for cider.

I don't wan to join the alarmist crowd, but this is a real threat.  Mills 
that custom press fruit, including and especially windfalls, open 
themselves up to serious liability and chance for people getting 
sick.  Just a week ago a mill in upstate New York had some kind of outbreak 
associated with its own fresh cider.  The full details haven't been 
announced, but five people were hospitalized. 
(http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/commish/2004/apple_cider_alert_10-01-2 
004.htm)
I enjoy fresh, unprocessed cider.  I know that fermenting the juice will 
kill off any bugs in it. I know that juice made from clean fruit on a clean 
mill does not have a large chance of hurting anyone. I also know that kids, 
the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems cannot handle even 
small levels of some microorganisms. If I were commercial, you can bet my 
mill would be scrupulously clean, and I would seriously consider treatment, 
probably UV, even of juice I sold on-site which does not fall under the 
regulations.  One of my main reasons for working on building my own press 
(launch date fall 05) is to assure the quality of the juice I make.
The problem extends beyond E. coli to include salmonella, cryptosporidium, 
and numerous other bugs. People who fit under the on-site sales rules and 
do not have to treat/pasteurize, yet who produce unclean product, only hurt 
everyone else.  Again, I don't know all the details about the recent case, 
especially fruit source and mill sanitation, but I would not be impressed 
if someone ran a dirty operation and put a bad light on everyone who does 
pay attention to things.


Off the soapbox,

Both the Springfield and Middlebury plants are located near Vermont's two 
main fruit producing ares: the lower Connecticut and Champlain 
Valleys.  The fact that they set up in an area where they had access to 
large amounts of culled McIntosh fruit should raise a red flag regarding 
the quality of their product (not to knock the Mac as a fresh apple, it 
just makes lousy 'real cider').

It seems that the focus in the state among ag leaders and investors is on 
the growing wine/grape industry.  There are at least six growers and more 
people interested every year. The vineyards are reaching a level of 
maturity where some good wines are being made.  I think the fact that wine 
has an established market helps to focus the attention on grapes, whereas 
cider is still looked at as either; 1) sweet/unfermented, 2)fizzy 
Bulmer's/Woodchuck stuff, or 3) backshed hooch that your uncle used to 
make.  We have covered the issue with cider being an undefined market many 
times, and I believe that this factor steers people away from it. Maybe 
things will change as Poverty Lane just across the river grows and settles 
into its market.
