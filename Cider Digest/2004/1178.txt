I'll throw my hat in on the empiricist side.  Grow it and find out.  Plan(t)
experiments that will take centuries to implement!  But the
chemist/statistics geek in me loves to look at the numbers, too. 


If we look at apple yield by cultivar, and find that the standard deviation
of our study is bigger than the mean - can we still get an idea of
comparative yields?


For instance, do any of the existing compilations of yields include sundry
dessert apples?  Say, Golden Delicious.  Most of use may not prefer it for
cider, but I think it's widely planted enough that you could find a local
grower(s) to ask what's typical for the region.  I've been told that
Calvados growers in France are ripping out their heirloom orchards and
planting Gold Delicious.  So there's a region with [past tense?] a wealth of
cider apples to compare against a common standard.


It would be nice to identify 3-4 standard varieties to use for comparison.
Low, Medium, High yields, and maybe one prone to alternation.


Hurray for non-parametric statistics!

Today I ground up aprox 100lbs of Belle du Bosccoop apples with about 25lbs
of kiwi fruit,and pressed them out. Now I have about 5gal of juice. So far
so good . To morrow I will put the yeast to it. Darcy. Campbell River

Charles has a good question, does cider taste like apples? Well in my
opinion yes and no. I taste and smell apples as they grow, are crushed,
juiced and fermented. At each stage the perception is a bit different but
the apple is there. This is not an experience most people will have. There
is a transformation which takes place during fermentation which I believe
captures the apple essence but not in the way that the fruit or the fresh
juice taste does. In my mind it is sort of like string theory, all this
bound up energy which is turned inside out, totally different from its
perceived nature. It is complex.


Sometimes its a bit disappointing, the aroma is great but the taste is does
not live up to what your nose tells you. So maybe this is the key, our nose
tells one thing our taste another. The idea of having people taste the
apples is a really great idea. We have done it successfully on several
occasions in our fall presentations on cider. Start with a Sweet Chopin and
end with a full Bittersweet like a Villbrie and you can really get the
audiences imagination going on how a cider should taste. This is where the
science ends and the art begins.

Regarding the Cider Festival, you might be interested to know that around 
Bloomington, Indiana, there are also annual Apple Festivals.  The apples of 
Indiana are not consumer quality, but make good Apple Butter, and possibly 
are fit for good Cider.  I had a rollicking good time at one such festival 
in about Fall, 1988.  I'm sure they are still going on.


Perhaps they can be introduced to real, fermented Cider?

For what it's worth...  In terms of old cider books...  When I was at Oregon 
State University, (about 10 years ago) I found that they had a number of old 
French cider books.  There were like 4-6 of them written between like 1750 
and 1900.  I can't read French but I had them pulled out of the rare book 
stack and I sat and flipped trough them.  I found that no one had pulled 
them from the stacks in decades....   There was no way they were letting 
them out of that room (like someone was watching me as I paged through them) 
so I really don't think that anyone out there could ILL (inter-Lib. Loan). 
They were neat.  Some one must of donated them as a collection years and 
years ago....

hello all
was pressing out a few gallons of cider out last weekend when an old friend
of mine stopped by and said he remembers that his long lost uncle used to
put dry mustard in his cider. he couldn't remember when or how much he
put in other than he didn't think it was more than a few tablespoons in
a 55 gal. barrel,but said it still tasted of apples and still had quite
a bite when it finished fermenting.I put about 1/4 teaspoon of mustard in
a 5 gal. pail of juice just to see what happens.has anyone ever heard of
this being done, and how much and when?
thanks
Sam

Racked the kiwi/apple cider from the primary to the secondary today. Could
not help but to have a taste . Was surprized at how good it tasted. Darcy
