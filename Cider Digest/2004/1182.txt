Regarding taste expectations, my experience falls largely along with Dick
Dunn, that is, dry ciders don't taste or smell anything like apples. 


However, my 2002 cider, consisting of 40% Dolgo crabs, has a definite, if
faint, taste of Dolgos. It seems quite dry (& sharp) to me, typically my
ciders ferment to 1.000 SG. Also, at least one other aficionado agreed that
the Dolgo flavor came through.


Not trying to disprove anyone's point here, just saying that rules of thumb
aren't spot on in every case!

Gary Burris asks about a cider flavor wheel in CD #1181.


Gary, this is a case of 'me too.'


I've made my own adaptation of Doc Noble's white wine flavor wheel for
_fresh_ apples.  A cider flavor wheel would be handy.  My bet is that it
wouldn't be very different from the wine flavor wheel - but more
knowledgeable people than I would have to do the tweak.


For that matter, a spider chart of major cider qualities (positive and
negative) might be a handy tool for cider judges to discuss.


Drew Z. - I'll toss this out in public for the NWCS to consider.


One of the lofty goals of nearly all wine competitions is a desire to give
objective feedback to the entrants.  And pretty much all competitions fail
miserably in this goal.  Style sheet based on the American Wine Society
judging sheet look like they have potential up front, but judges rarely fill
in more than a 1-5 in various categories and might only give a written
comment on one.


So here's an idea.


If you look in various winemaking rags, it isn't long before you find
'spider' graphs used to compare something or other.  The basic idea is that
you have a radial diagram - like spokes on a wheel.  Each spoke represents a
variable, usually a narrow flavor perception.  You can have as many spokes
as you like, but most seem to be 8-12.  The center of the graph is 'little'
and the end of each spoke is 'lots'.  You put a dot on each spoke to record
a value for that variable.  It can be quantitative, or qualitative (as long
as it is essentially a 'little to lots' scalar term.)  If you connect the
dots, you get a funny shaped, more or less lumpy circle.


A good flavor wheel would have all (or most) of the 'spokes' you would want
to consider.  Go around the flavor wheel and mark a dot from center to edge
in each wedge.


Consider the use in judging.  Some consensus, average shape would represent
each style- presumably all different.  A report that showed the category
standard and the judges' record of your entry would show you what they were
judging to, how close you came, and how varied the judges were.  A
competition wide report would easily show the range on entries, and maybe
what distinguished medal winners from the rest.


It would require (aside from the will) some consensus on a good, usable
'cider wheel' and maybe standards of reference (as practical as possible) to
calibrate what 1-5 means taste-wise for each variable.

Okay Dick, I'll grant that taste is subjective enough that we should all go
around repeating the mantra 'Taste Is Subjective' under our breath.


I certainly see the whole range of folks in my tasting room - even just
considering my brut champagne-method cider.  All the way from 'That's
apple???' to 'That's Apple!!!'.


For that matter, my own perceptions seem to cycle over time.  I have a dead
dry (but not tannic) Gravenstein / Jerseymac cider that also got a complete
malo-lactic fermentation.  I know that MLF is supposed to totally consume
fruity character - but it still tastes 'pineapple' up front to me.  And some
days even the summery apple tastes come through.


As I noted, I'm going to _maintain_ that cider tastes like it's origin.
Whether it's 'T'rue depends on what you mean by 'like', I suppose.  But
regardless, I think that the assertion, especially made to folks not tasting
the connection, is a challenge.  A call to thoughtful regard of flavor and
expectation.  And that's part of the fun of tasting.


And now I'm thirsty.  If only I had some cider handy...

I have no wheel but there is a linear tabulation of Cider Flavour 
Descriptors on my website (go to the link under More Science).


If you join up the ends you'll have a wheel!

I'm with Dick on this one. Cider does not smell of fresh apples to me 
either.  The only thing I'll add (with my Flavour Chemist hat on) is 
that all the volatile aroma components in apple juice or fresh apple are 
also present in cider (let's say there's a hundred of them or so and the 
ones in the cider are actually newly made by the yeast),  But the 
quantitative *balance* between each of them is quite different in the 
two drinks so, to most people, juice and cider are not reminiscent of 
each other. But since flavour perception probably differs for every 
individual on the planet, I'll understand that some people eg Charles 
may be more sensitive to certain aromas in the cider which are also 
characteristic of juice. Hence in Charles' brain there is provoked a 
memory of juice, but in my brain and Dick's there isn't.


I think we can rationalise it and still keep everybody happy!

We are deep into subjective territory here, but I agree with Dick, ciders do
not taste like apples any more than wines taste like grapes, with the
possible exception of tannins.  I think there is even some chemical truth to
this statement in the technical fermented product literature.  But, that
said, there is sometimes a resemblance. Clearly this can help a novice
relate to cider in a way that might lead them to become a consumer. In my
experience, this fruit taste resemblance is often enhanced when there is a
nose of apple, a bit of sugar present, and higher acid content.

Subject: glucose, finishing formula

Has anyone used the "sweetener" from Winemaster named : "glucose 
finishing formula".The recipe calls for 1.5 to 2 oz per recipe. I was 
told that it would ferment to 50% leaving the rest as sugar. As I am 
looking for having a cider with residual sugar in the bootle 
fermentation, I wounder if it can be used instead of sugar in the second 
(bottle ) fermentation ? The product is normally used for making home 
spirituous or liqueur
