I am looking for scion wood for 'graham spy'.  While this is not a true 
cider apple, I am hopeing that someone out there has a source for it.  I am 
only looking for a twig or two. Enought to graft 2-3 trees.  I get a 'Not in 
the NPGS Collection' when I try to search for it....


Also is there a listing of all the apple cultivars at Geneva?  Corvallis 
(pears) has a very nice web page and it seems to be about 1000% easier to 
find stuff.....  They are listed both alphabetically and broken out by 
perry, asian, european etc....


Thanks

Does anyone know of any commercial producers of hard cider in the state of 
Ohio?  I would like to try some cider other than Strongbow, Woodpecker, 
Woodchuck or Cider Jack.

I have been unable to find true cider apples in Massachusetts that an
orchard is willing to part with and I currently don't have land enough to
plant cider trees.


The local community run orchard in Leominster MA, Sholan Farms is willing
to designate some space to grow some cider apples.  I am in need of
information on varieties that will grow well in the region, and are
available for purchase this year.  I am not sure how much space they
will allot, so for starters I will probably not have more than 24 trees.
Therefore I would like some apples that are either  single variety ciders
or compliment each other well.


My first batches of cider were pressed this fall I used blends of dessert
apples and a single variety Mutsu (Crispin) as well as a single variety
bosch pear.  It will be nice to have true cider apples to use as my
experience grows in the next few years.


Thank you and Happy Holidays
