Hi there,
If I were you I would ask Nashoba Winery over in Bolton, MA what varieties
are growing well for them, as they have a number of cultivars. Glenn Lord
is the Orchard Manager over there, a good guy if you can track him down,
as he is always running around, very busy! The old American standards
Baldwin and Golden Russett should thrive anywhere in your locality, and
may also be for sale at many orchards.  Poverty Lane orchards, ie Steve
Wood, in Lebanon NH also grows a number of cultivars for his product, and
that orchard or their website might point you in the right direction. I
would just guess that many cider varieties, both foreign and domestic,
would do very well on good soil and site conditions in the Leominster
area. You are warm enough, and the soil is great in many places. Good Luck!

Larry,


We sell cider apple trees in the Fedco catalog.  You can see the catalog on
line at <fedcoseeds.com>.  Or, drop me an email and we'll send you a catalog
snail mail.

You mention that you've used Mutsu (Crispin) for cider, and so have I 
in the past, because I had a source for single-variety Mutsu cider. 
It's not bad, but like most varietals, it's pretty ho-hum and 
one-dimensional.


There are lots of great possibilities for cider apples, but if I had 
limited space and a willing orchard partner (as I will have this year, 
since I am helping to replant and graft an old orchard in Antrim, NH), 
I would consider the following six as some of my top choices (all mid 
to late season). Each of these makes a respectable single-variety 
cider, but blended together in almost any combination they would kick 
ass.


1. Ashmead's Kernel -- British russeted apple; sugary and aromatic
2. Baldwin -- excellent Mass. apple for base or alone
3. Esopus Spitzenburg -- sprightly, with high sugar/high acid -- one of 
the very best
4. Golden Russet -- deep, rich juice with high specific gravity -- best 
for base or blending
5. Roxbury Russet -- a Mass. alternative to Golden Russet -- very good 
for cider
6. Wickson -- small fruit, extremely high sugar balanced with acid -- 
one of my favorites


Anyway, take this advice for whatever it's worth. Maybe other folks 
will have better suggestions.


Happy New Year to all you Cider Digestivos,

Technically, I believe that Hard Core is still baed in Cincinnati; 
they're owned by the Boston Beer Co., the makers of Sam Adams.


Their cider is industrial "draft"-style cider, but to my taste it is 
one of the best of this class, and they win lots of medals and such. In 
recent years they've been experimenting in Boston with small batches of 
cider made from "real" cider apples that they've purchased from Steve 
Wood's Poverty Lane Orchards in Lebanon, NH (the same folks who produce 
Farnum Hill Ciders), and they have employed as a consultant Alan 
Tringham, the longtime former cidermaker for HP Bulmer in the UK. So 
they are making their bones right now, and someday might really have in 
commercial quantities a superior draft cider -- albeit with the 
limitations of that style and the marketing thereof. At present, their 
limited production is enjoyed only by cider aficionados, judges, and a 
few lucky patrons of Irish pubs in the Boston area, where they sold 
their entire 600-gallon kegging a couple years ago.


If you do discover anyone making artisanal cider in Ohio, please let us 
know. With the amount of sweet cider being produced and consumed in 
Ohio, it would make sense for someone to start making and selling the 
alcoholic stuff.
