Subject: Farnum Hill cider apples
From: Benjamin Watson <bwatson@worldpath.net>

Just a quick correction to something posted here today: most of Farnum 
Hill's ciders are not produced exclusively with European cider apples, 
but are made from a blend of different, mainly separately fermented 
single apple varieties, including lots of North American dessert fruits.


Steve Wood grows and uses lots of Esopus Spitzenburg, Wickson, Hudson's 
Golden Gem, Golden Russet, Ashmead's Kernel (OK, this is technically a 
Gloucestershire variety), etc.


So, although people focus on the European cider fruits they grow 
extensively (like Dabinett, Harry Master's Jersey, Chisel Jersey, 
Yarlington Mill, Foxwhelp, and many others), Farnum Hill is producing 
- -- like most cidermakers -- a truly American cider that is reflective 
of their geography, climate, and growing conditions, as well as the 
fruit. Many commercial cidermakers, like the Andersons in Washington 
State, are also doing this -- creating a new American style of 
artisanal cider from a mixture of the old tannin-rich European cider 
apples and the best old and new varieties from the New World.

Sadly, I don't have much experience with traditional 'cider' apples to give
a _really_ good opinion.  But I'm not going to let that stop me :-)


I use a lot of Cortland.  Partly because I've got it, and partly because I
like a tart, aromatic cider and Cortland, once it's ripened to a yellow
base, brings gobs of 'aromatic' to a cider.  I think you'll find it heavily
mixed with various russets all around the Great Lakes.


The other thing I have a little experience with are the different
sweet/sharp russets - American and English. (Golden Russet, Roxbury Russet,
Ashmead's Kernel, Margil, Cox's Orange Pippin, Blenheim Orange, Golden
Nugget, Spitzenberg) They bring a lot more flavor intensity and character to
cider than Cortland.  Even a hint of soft tannins.  They are a lot tarter,
and sweeter than Cortland.  A few have notable bouquets, but most bring
tartness and some body building side notes.


I have only had a handful of traditional varieties from my trees, but from
those little samples, I can tell I'll like the ones that taste like
sweet/sharps that had a soft/French/earthy tannin component.  The hard
jerseys are just out of my taste range.


If really good apples break down into pippins ('eaters'), codlins
('cookers') and jerseys (lets call them 'drinkers') than Cortland falls out
of the range.  It just doesn't have the depth of character - though what it
does have is pleasant.


I will make one exception - the most amazing pomme de glace (ice cider) that
I've had was a straight Cortland varietal.  Tree frozen, I seem to remember,
which would make it rare.  And unbelievably fragrant and spicy.  Our
Cortlands are never spicy.


My Appely Doux - which received an honorable mention in the NWCS competition
- - is about 1/3 Cortland.

I do agree with " Suzan ,Richard Anderson " about real cider apples for 
cider making.Having experienced with eating varieties like Cortland, 
MacIntosh, Delicious, Gala, Russet, best results were obtained with a 
mixed solution.Cider is usually light, not that much aromatic, no tannin 
enhancing flavor. By using cider apples varieties ,in my case Golden 
Russet, Dolgo, Geneva you get this extra taste, increasing the average 
cider to specific ,particular, in its own range ,personnality. My 
preference is for  a mixed of very aromatic high PH appes (Delicious,  
Gala ) Golden Russet and high acid tannin ( Geneva ,Dolgo ).      Diane
