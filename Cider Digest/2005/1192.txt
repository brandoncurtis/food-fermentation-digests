Subject: Cortland apples for cider

When I first saw this question on Cortland apples quite a few digests ago,
I thought I had to reply. But then XMas and New year came and I forgot...
But the subject reappeared in the last digest - so this is my word about
Cortland...


When I bought my small orchard 25 years ago, there were 25 adult standard
Cortland and a few McIntosh trees. I started making cider in 1988 and at
that time, Cortland was about 80% of my crop. Since then, I have planted
and grafted many varieties - I harvested over 60 varieties of apples last
fall, including quite a few European cider varieties, but Cortland still
accounts for about 40% of my production, and is by far the variety I have
in most quantity.


So, through the years, I have made many cider batches that were pure
Cortland and others that had more than 50% Cortland, mixed with some other
varieties I harvested. Sometimes, now, I manage to make a batch "without
any Cortland" but not very often.


Of all the varieties I have harvested, Cortland is always one of the best -
for juice, fresh eating, cooking, and cider. It is an easy apple to grow,
it presses well, keeps well. I don't think any other apple could add-up as
many qualities as Cortland (in my cold climate at least). The cider made
from Cortland apples might not have all the bouquet and the tannins we can
get from other apples, but it is a fantastic festive drink, light, full of
joy and with an extremely strong "go back to it" appeal. I would consider
it as a "not serious but a lot more fun" cider. In 2003, I went to a NAFEX
meeting, and brought a few bottles of one of my ciders that was almost pure
Cortland - Quite a few people had a taste of it, including Ben Watson and
some serious cider makers. They all liked it, but were amazed to learn it
was made from Cortland apples...


So, in my opinion, Cortland is an apple that can make excellent cider. It
can make an even better cider when appropriately mixed with some other
varieties. It surely is an apple that has its place in a cider orchard.
