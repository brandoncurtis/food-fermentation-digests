Subject: Bitter Brew

Dear All,


We are UK based and have produced our first ever brew using predominately 
cooking style apples. The fermentation was problematic due we reckon to low 
temperatures in the shed we were using. We re-introduced some more yeast and 
sugar and warmed the vessel with a heater ring and the brew appeared to go 
on and finish fermenting. The result was a clear cider but very bitter and 
with a slight after taste of yeast.


Do any of you cider professionals have any tips that we can use to improve 
our brew. It is such a shame after all the hard work and any help would be 
deeply appreciated.


Regards


Tim Watson

I have been pruning my orchard this past week and I have noticed a tree 
growth issue that seems to be unique to my Kingston Blacks.  The trees just 
finished their 3rd year of growth.  While I used spreaders to establish good 
brach angles, at the point where the spreaders ended, the branches did 
immediate turns upwards.  At the turn, most branches developed a "head" of 
multiple shoots.  My question is, is this a normal appearance for these 
branches, or should I be doing further pruning and bending of the shoots?  I 
had no fruit on the trees this year, and they seem to be growing a little 
more slowly than other cider varieties planted at the same time.  I have 
about 15 cider varieties, and the Kingstons are the only ones that take on 
this shape.  I would welcome comments from other growers of Kingstons.  
Thanks, Rob Miller  (western Maryland)

  OK.. here goes. I have a few questions for you experts. I have several 
30 liter containers of must fermenting. The sugar is almost completely 
fermented and I have racked several of the containers. As is my usual 
procedure I intend to bottle most of  this in champagne bottles with an 
added priming sugar when the time is right. I intend though to add a 
malolactic culture this year. (Vinoferm - Malocid) which I've never done 
before. My questions are as follows:


1.) The temperature in my shed is about 4deg C right now and varies at 
this time of year between 4-9degC. I understand that malolactic cultures 
need significantly warmer temps to work. Would it be a total waste of 
time to put the culture in at this stage? Or could I put it in and hope 
it ferments slowly?


2.) Assuming I put the culture in at the right time and everything goes 
hunky-dory, can I add priming sugar in before bottling and expect it to 
ferment properly in the bottle to give that satisfying fizzy plop? Or 
does the malolactic culture affect this?


3.) If this is a malolactic fermentation formula COOH-H2OC-H2C-COOH ---> 
CH3-CHOH-COOH + CO2 then I see that CO2 is also produced. Would it be 
theoretically possible to add the malolactic culture prior to bottling 
and save myself the trouble of a priming sugar? (This is of course 
assuming that moderate and not massive amounts of CO2 are produced.) Is 
there a residual deposit from malolactic fermentation?


Thanks in advance for any help


Kurt
