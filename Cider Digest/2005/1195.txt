Subject: Racked my first cider to secondary today!

Hi all,


Just a quick note and looking for some reasurance/advise!


Today I racked my (first) cider/cyser to the secondary. It stated out 
slow, but cooked along for awhile, but finally slowed down. The original 
Gravenstein juice gravity was 1.050, and today's reading was 1.002!! 
This included about 1 1/2 cups honey too, so it doesn't surprise me that 
it was so dry after a month.


Anyways, I was able to rack about 4.5 gal of fermented cider to the new 
carboy. Because I didn't want that much headspace I bought another jug 
of the Gravenstein juice (pasteurized) to top it off. The local shop 
said that should be OK. Anyone have any problems when they've topped 
their stuff off?


Also, I bought a racking tube that was about 2 feet too short so it 
ended up fanning the fermented cider down the side of the carboy. I 
image this must've aerated it a bit. Any problems with that? I'm used to 
not wanting to aerate beer, but did have someone tell me that it was 
actually GOOD to aerate the cider at transfer.


So now I have to wait while its in the secondary. I don't imagine it 
will ferment much (other than the juice I topped it off with), so what 
does conventional wisdom say I should wait before bottling this stuff? 
Its pretty murky right now and am considering using a fining agent 
somewhere down the line.


Later,


Robert
