Among all the other fascinating bits in that article was the assertion that 
the MLF is completed by the end of January!  Must be pretty warm winters in 
Basque country, or else they have a cold-active strain of MLF bacteria.


Thanks , Peter, for posting that link.


Cheers!

I've updated the digest archives at www.talisman.com/cider:  there's now
a whole-year compressed archive for 2004.  (I normally wait a while into
the new year so that the "current year" directory contains a few individual
digests.)


The archives are missing a handful of issues from the early years.  I'm
looking for copies of the following:
8  115  116  123  132  147  256  320  405
If anyone has copies of these, please contact me off-list at
cider-request@talisman.com
thanks

I repaired an inconsistency in the .tar.gz archives:  Several of them
had been set up so files would extract into the current directory, while
the rest of the archives would extract into a subdirectory named for the
year of the archive.  Now, all extract into a subdirectory.
</nerdspeak>


I've tried to check everything, but if you find problems in the archives,
please drop me a note at cider-request@talisman.com (NOT at the digest
submission address, please!)

The colour plates and (cider) apple descriptions from this classic book
are shortly to be made available on CD-ROM.  The Marcher Apple Network (MAN)
in the UK is organising this.


The cost of the CD will be 15 pounds sterling (cash or cheque drawn on a UK
bank) or $30 US (cash only) for pre-publication orders.  (Please note that
the MAN have no facilities to handle credit cards nor cheques drawn on
overseas banks. But many of us have managed to send bare cash across the
Atlantic without any problems!)


Richard Wheeler from the Marcher Apple Network writes as follows:


"There is a copy of the "flyer" describing the project at
http://www.marcherapple.net/pomona.htm
where order forms can be downloaded.  I expect
to load an example of part of a plate and the corresponding description in a
couple of weeks' time.  This will allow anybody interested in a copy of the
CD to get a preview of what will be available.  It will also allow anybody
with less usual operating systems and/ or browsers to check that they will
have no problems accessing the data on the CD.  (The plates and descriptions
will be set up as a website on the CD so there will be no need to install
any software on purchaser's computers)"
