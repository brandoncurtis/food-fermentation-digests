We are looking at doing keg sales to individuals and the 
Quoin Party-Pig system looks very nice.
It's for carbonated beverages only -- you use a disposable 
bladder to hold the product inside a 2.5 gallon PET bottle.  
The bottle lays on its side in your fridge and there is a 
valve unit for dispensing. There is a pressurization pouch 
which is activated when you fill the pig -- it provides a 
constant level of carbonation throughout the dispensing.


Overall cost per unit is under $40 but except for the 
pressurization pouch and the bladder, it is completely reusable.
Cost of the consumables is about $5


More info and a list of dealers can be found here:
http://www.partypig.com/


We will be carrying these in our homebrew store as well (open 
for business this fall)

Dick,
I can only echo what both you and Andrew have mentioned re. the Pomona.
Having access to and reading the old classics of the cider world, is like
being able to prise open the best cider and perry after hundreds of years,
and find it is better than you can ever imagine.
The original watercolours on display in the Cider Museum in Hereford are a
joy to look at, timeless and evocative.
Marcher Apple Network <http://www.marcherapple.net> have done many great
things by bringing lost varieties of apple to light and propagating them but
this CD of the Pomona will be a triumph.
I had the pleasure of attending a Gloucester Orchard Group
<http://www.orchard-group.uklinux.net/glos/> AGM last week and the talk was
by Dr. Barrie Juniper and dealt with his insight into the Origin of the
Apple, a topic that would make a fascinating publication in the future.
<http://www.orchard-group.uklinux.net/glos/events/20050203agm/apple-origins.
html>
Looking to the future there is a book due to be published in the spring
called "The Orchard" by Jonathan Latimer <http://www.jonathanlatimer.com/>.
One of the illustrations is of a Holmer perry pear and tree. I was lucky
enough to meet Jonathan and purchase the original painting. It possesses all
the beauty and wonder of the old Pomona and will be available to one and all
soon.

A manual fill version of this has been available in the UK for some 
years from Vigo as the 'Manucube' 
http://www.vigoltd.com/commercial/productinfo.asp?ID=77


I have worked professionally with some of the commercial systems over 
the years, mostly when they go wrong!.  The bags are not as robust nor 
as impermeable as people would have you believe - they may not leak 
liquid out, but they can readily leak air in through 'pinholes' in the 
layered flexible packaging or around the seams, hence they can spoil the 
wine within.  That's why they are used primarily at the cheap end of the 
market.  I think the technology may have improved a bit in the last 
decade but I would still be a little wary of it, myself, until the case 
is proven!


Also if there is any overpressure from continued or renewed fermentation 
(eg MLF) they will balloon out and then they _will_leak!  The contents 
have to be pasteurised or sterile filtered to eliminate this 
possibility, AFAIK.

This packaging is becoming more prevelant in the U.S. (AUS and N.Z. have been 
putting quality wines in these for a while now).  The wine trade publications 
have more and more ads for these systems.  My best recollection is that the 
equipment to fill them runs between $1500-3000US.  It is a nice system for 
products that are not going to be stored for very long periods of time (air 
permeability issues, but nothing serious for a year or 2).  Biggest problem
is that there is a consumer belief that only inferior products come packaged
in these.


I think we will see more and more of this in the next few years.

This one is for Dick Dunn
Bag in Box is excellent for cider.  I used to sell cider in pubs in the UK 
in a french box called a Manucube, this is a reusable plastic outer, from 
memory about 11 Litres.  It has a liner which is several layers of plastic, 
(but not the aluminiumised of wine casks), and improved the shelf life of 
the cider enormously.  The bag has a lid which is relatively easily 
removed, and would last several refills with a wash and SO2 rinse.  I 
believe they are still available in England from Vigo.  Their email address 
is camilla@vigoltd.com
Most commercial wine boxes aren't easy to refill, I imagine to give 
security and prevent reuse!
The tougher type bag isn't around so much anymore, they take a good 
pressure, but don't collapse fully so you get air ingress earlier, and the 
cider doesn't keep as well.

I would like to echo Dick's comments on the Herefordshire Pomona.  This
is a great way all of us too poor to even dream of owning a real copy
can get our hands on an invaluable (or at least very expensive)
resource.  I too had the chance to flip through a Herefordshire Pomona
on a visit to the library at the Long Ashton Research Station shortly
before it closed.  It was quite an experience to see such a valuable and
important work.


I would also add that it is a brilliant fundraising idea on their part
that deserves the support of like-minded and interested parties.  In
addition to reproduction of the old English texts it would also seem
reasonable for groups in the States (NAFEX maybe?) to consider similarly
themed projects as fundraisers, drawing from our pomologic literature,
allowing valuable resources to be more widely (and economically)
available.

In addition to my recent submission, I am looking for any info on the
following varieties; Champagne Reinette ( France), Lemon Pippin (UK),
Pedleys Pippin (UK), Red Cinnamon ( Finland), Twistbody Jersey (UK),
White Jersey (UK).
Thanks, Eric.
