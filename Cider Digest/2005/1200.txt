There are several cider making techniques which I am curious about. 
Both have recently received passing mention on the Cider List, yet 
neither seems much discussed in the literature.
        Ice Cider-  Presumably the fruit freezes on the tree, and water 
becomes ice leaving a concentrated juice in the apple.  Is the 
concentrated juice extracted from the frozen fruit, and if so how are 
the apples ground or mashed up?  Or is the fruit allowed to freeze and 
thaw, becoming desiccated as part of this process?   Or is the fruit 
merely "super ripened" as a result of freezing, and all of it's juice 
used for cider making?  Has anybody on this list experimented at all 
with different techniques?
        Fermentation on the pulp of the apple- I have seen some references to 
this in old American cider making literature, but it does not seem to 
be a common practice.  I can't help but wonder if there isn't some 
character being left behind when the pomace is thrown out; it seems to 
me that especially the apple skins would contain some difficult to 
extract but interesting flavors.  Of course, I can imagine that 
fermenting cider, pulp and all, would be a very messy process.  Does 
anyone have any thoughts on this process?
         We are just starting to taste our  2004 vintage- quite young, quite 
young.   Happy cider making!

I'm new to the list and new to cider-making. So new in fact that I
haven't made any cider just yet, but I intend to. If I understand
correctly, good cider is made from cider apples. I am, however, at a
loss of how to find them. Does anyone on this list know where I can
find cider apples or cider apple juice in Victoria, Australia (nearer
to Melbourne for preference)? (I don't have a press or mill so I'd
prefer juice.) Maybe someone's got some hints as to how one might go
about looking for them?


Failing that, is it possible to emulate cider apple juice with, say,
normal apple juice and various added chemicals, like malic acid (or in
some totally different manner).


Sorry for asking a species of question that's probably been asked so
many times already, but searching the archives of this list didn't
seem to turn anything up useful to me (maybe I used the wrong words),
and if Google is my friend, I haven't learnt the language yet...


Thanks,
