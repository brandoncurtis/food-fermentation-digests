Let me clarify a point here: the (talisman.com) archives are intended to
allow you to retrieve them as efficiently as possible, -not- to search
them.  So, Claude's reaction is correct, but in effect I reply "It's not
a bug; it's a feature!"


Still I admit, the problem remains, how to search the archives.  (Oh, it's
not a problem for me here...I can search the entire history of the digest
in milliseconds, since it's all on my local disk.  But YMMV:-)

There are two separate issues here.  Making a transparent (un-zipped or
un-tarred) archive is one thing; indexing is quite another.  It would take
me no more than an hour or so to make an uncompressed collection of all the
digests, and if there is sufficient interest I'll do just that.  (PLEASE!
If so, send notes to cider-request!  Don't "vote" via digest postings!)  My
concern in doing so is that people will try to retrieve the entire 1200+
digests one-at-a-time when they want their own complete copy of the
archives, instead of grabbing a dozen compressed archive files.


One trouble with indexing is that there's occasional very-wrong info in the
digests.  There is no editing, so it's stream-of-consciousness material,
with no way to catch out the mistakes.  If you index it, you really want to
un-index (or mark specially) the postings which contain wrong information.
That is at least two orders of magnitude harder than just indexing.  In
terms of actually making it happen, it requires someone with both technical
skills and cidermaking background, willing to work gratis on a mostly-
tedious task.  Hard to find!

Hoping someone can provide information on a source for
heavy filter/press blankets????


Also hoping for recommendations on a GOOD stainless
chredder for pulping the apples next season

Subject: Bulk aging Vs. Bottle aging?
From: "deva maas" <devamaas@hotmail.com>

I'm interested in the differences between cider that is bulk aged (5+ gal.) 
thru the summer and bottle aged cider, aged under the same conditions.  Is 
there more of a chance for natural mal-lactic fermentation in bulk aged 
cider, with a little sediment verses bottled cider,( bottled without 
sulfur)? What are the risks of storing dry cider in carboys or stainless 
steel throughout the summer in a cellar where temperatures top out around 
70-75 F verses in bottles? Are there any know benefits to flavor that will 
occur with bulk aging or is it just a matter of being certain fermentation 
is complete.
Thanks for all the great insight.....Eric c. Shatt----Burdett,N.Y.

Pup's Cider is experimenting a bit with Ice Cider this year. Claude
Jolicoeur's recent post (in CD #1201) covered all the bases, so no need to
repeat it. Everything else, method of freezing, starting and ending gravity,
apple choices, etc. are really matters of local climate, personal taste, or
local fruit availability. If anybody is interested in the formal Quebec
definition of ice cider, they should visit:
http://www.appleicewine.com/icecider-icecider.asp . The only other practical
point to add is dress warmly and definately wear gloves!

In digest 1200, Tristan McLeay <thecartographers@gmail.com> asked (among
other matters):
>...Failing that, is it possible to emulate cider apple juice with, say,
> normal apple juice and various added chemicals, like malic acid (or in
> some totally different manner).


In a rough generalization, the main difference between normal apple juice
and cider apple juice (i.e., ignoring the properties for pressing) is the
tannins in the cider juice.  You should be able to find juice with enough
acidity.  In fact common eating apples may have too much, but you can
usually find some other juice to blend that down.  You'd want to be sure
you've got enough sugar in the juice, to get up to at least SG 1.045.  
Getting the tannin is the hardest problem.


With a little luck and some hunting around for apple trees, you can often
find wildings that are quite tannic (bitter), and if you can get some of
those pressed, a bit of that juice will help your cider a lot.


Folks have tried using the tannin powder available in homebrew/wine shops.
It's some manner of extract from grape.  The results have generally not
been favorable.  You dare not add very much or you pick up an odd off
taste along with the tannins.
