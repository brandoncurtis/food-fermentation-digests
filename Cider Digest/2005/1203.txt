Thanks to Rich for posting that link to the La Face Cachee de la Pomme 
cidery. It was one of the places we visited on our cider trip to Quebec in 
the Summer of 2004 and their products were very tasty.  We tried a lot of 
ice ciders on our trip, and while the La Face Cachee de la Pomme products 
were probably the best, they were also the most expensive.


If you are considering heading up to Quebec to try some for yourself you 
may want to check out our pages at 
http://www.doctorbeer.com/jay/beertrav/quebecid.htm for info on places to 
hit. We went mid summer and about 1/3 of the places were closed. We are 
already considering a return trip for the fall when more places will be 
open. Too bad the $ has tanked since we went, but on the plus side at least 
we filled up our wine cellar last summer before it dropped.


Cheers,


Jay H

I have just been given a wonderful old antique hand cranked cast iron 
apple grinder.
It was unearthed in an old New England farm house and , though the 
wooden base for it long ago rotted away, it appears all of the cast 
iron grinding mechanism is still intact and operational. There is a 
cast hopper on top that would receive additional wooden side pieces to 
create a  bigger box  for the whole apples. The apples then drop down 
past a rotating drum fitted with paddle like projections that would do 
the initial crush. The apple pieces would then drop further down where 
they would pass between two opposing drums turning against one another 
with an appropriate gap between. One of these drums has a series of 
straight ridges cast into it and the other has a series of ' V '  
ridges. The entire system is driven by hand crank and heavy fly wheel 
and an ingenious combination of toothed gears.


Cast into the side of it are the words "Manufactured by " and the 
number 15 below. I assume there must have originally been a paper or 
painted company logo between the two.


Would anybody out there have any information about this grinder, it's 
age and possible origin? Any websites that might discuss antique 
grinders?


I'd love to carefully dismantle the entire unit, clean it up and build 
a rugged oak or maple stand and get this grinder back in service in my 
fledgling cider orchard. There is much rust and pitting that needs 
addressing / any thoughts on the safest way to deal with that? Naval 
Jelly or other rust removal preparations? Wire brush and elbow grease?


Any and all feedback will be greatly appreciated.


Thanks

Well, I downloaded all the tarballs and ran grep over them, hoping to
find something, and nothing terribly interesting turned up. I was more
concerned that my search terms were wrong rather than in the
difficulty of searching.


Nevertheless, I was thinking having a searchable form on the Internet
would be useful. I also grabbed all the MLDs, and with those I've used
various unix tools to cut the digests up into distinct posts* and
extract the subjects. I anticipated that some responses would be, at
least, contraversial, and assumed that generally if this happened,
people would respond with correct statements/their opinions. Hence, I
was going to make an interface that would attempt to thread the
individual posts (or at least a hyperlinked list of 'possibly related
posts' at the end of the post), going by a combination of the subject
header, quoting and digest number. Unfortunately, work's got in the
way this fortnight and my University semester begins tomorrow, so it
might not be till June/July holidays that I can get any work done on
it. (As I'm a newbie to the lists, you might point out the
fruitlessness of this approach.)


* And I must say thanks for changing ----s into '- ----' so that
breaking up the digests is easy!

I hope you don't mind me voting here seeing as I'm already posting,
but I would say I think a threaded view is better (i.e. patience!).
You can get all the archives easily enough as it is.

Which is kinda why I tried my approach!


As for my question about cider apples in Victoria, or emulating
them---thanks for all your responses (I got a number offlist too). I'm
investigating some of these leads, and near Bendigo in March seems
promising. If I have any success I'll make a post for posterity. If I
can't make it, I might have to content myself with mead & commercial
cider till next year. Thanks again!

    In Cider Digest #1201, in response to a question of mine regarding 
ice cider, Claude Jolicoeur wrote that in order to make ice cider, the 
idea is to press the apples while they are partially frozen.  It occurs 
to me that it would be much easier to grind and press unfrozen apples, 
then leave the juice out on a cold night.  Once the juice was partially 
frozen, one could remove the ice layer which would form on the surface 
and there would be your concentrated must without the hassle of 
pressing frozen apples. This seems to me like it would be a great deal 
easier if one had the appropriate container, although I suppose that 
beyond a fairly limited scale it would become impractical. Is there 
some benefit of pressing the frozen fruit which this technique would 
eliminate?
