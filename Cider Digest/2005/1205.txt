Someone (forgive me if I asking people to repeat stuff) recently posted a  
question about fermenting on lees (sediment).  I have often wondered about  
this, a lot of flavor and components are supposed to be contained in apple
skin.  
Has anyone tried adding apple pulp to a blend of must before  fermentation?  
or apple peels?  I'm guessing there must be additional  flavor in some of what 
gets feed to cattle (around here - west chester  pennsylvania).
 
thanks

As I understand it, the ice cider concept is simply a technique, or a
number of techniques to concentrate the fermentable juice without the
addition of sugars that were not present in the fruit to begin with.
I am certain that different techniques will produce some differences
of flavors.  The techniques and scales employed will be dictated by what
you are able to try at your own location. To perhaps bring up a heretical
concept, for the small-scale home cider maker willing to experiment....ice
concentration of pressed juice certainly is possible.  As well, similar
effects may be had perhaps, by adding an all-natural frozen apple juice
concentrate to the raw cider to enhance the fermentable sugar content.
After all, that is the intent here.  Just a thought.

Hello,


I have been making cider and apple wine for a few years from sweet cider
and occasionally wild apples. Now, I would like to try my hand at growing a
few apple trees, and am looking for varieties that will augment the tannin
or aroma of sweet cider. My problem is that I have a fairly shady yard,
and the trees may only get four hours of direct sun a day, with filtered
sun the rest of the time. Does anyone have any recommendations for dwarf
or semi-dwarf cider apple trees that I could plant in these conditions? I
live in Massachusetts.


Thanks -Fran Turner

Thankyou all for your replies, both public and private! In case anyone
else in Melbourne/Victoria comes looking for cider apples/cider apple
juice, I'm posting a summary of the results of my search.


The most popularly suggested place was Badger's Keep. I think there
was some miscommunication here, though, as they only sell the trees,
whereas I was interested in the fruit or juice. Maybe when I have my
own land that I can put them on, but that's still a few years yet ;)
If this is what you're after, he sells the trees in July (middle of
winter), but it's best to book the trees you want well ahead.


When cider apples are not available, people recommend crab apples
mixed with dessert apples to increase the tannins.


Henry's at Harcourt is a maker of cider in Harcourt, near Bendigo.
Their cider has come recommended from various places, including by
members of this digest. They make mostly Cider Apples. In _The Age_ (a
major Melburnian newspaper), my sister found a comment that they also
supply bulk juice for home cidermaking. I just gave Drew Henry a call,
and he says that he does, but it's not available till mid-May, when
they press the apples. If you want the juice, you need to get up there
on the day he's doing the pressing, and he'll fill up the container.
So that seems to be the most promising option yet. Drew seemed most
helpful. So that's probably your best bet.

Has CD member actually tried to keeve a perry must - either common or
traditional pears?  And especially with PME active enzyme and Ca2+
enhancement?


The reason I ask, is that is came up in an off-CD discussion the other
day, and I'm curious.


I've worked with common perry a couple of years now, and have some
observations about how it responds to pectinase (likely mostly
galactanase, chain-breaking activity - small PME activity) compared to
apple must.


My observation is that a standard wine pectinase for clarification and
settling doesn't do anything visible to common pear must.  It doesn't
clear it, doesn't change the mouthfeel, nada.  The same enzyme at half
the usage rate will drop the solids out of suspension from a cider must
overnight.  It must affect the mouthfeel, but I don't notice it.


I don't aim to keeve for most of what I do, and this barrel in
particular was bound for poirissimo (pear pommeau) - so keeving would
have been pointless.  Also, CaCl2 isn't on the approved list for US
wineries to use in wines - so I don't have a Ca2+ source available to me
that is pH/acidity neutral.


But given pectinase's neglible visible affect, it makes me wonder what
PME would do.

I am curious as to the mechanism by which cold damages recently pruned 
fruit trees, in my case apples.  Is there a growth response to the 
pruning cut which forms susceptible tissue?  Does this growth response 
happen even if temperatures remain cold or is it a warming cooling 
cycle which causes the damage? I have read that less vigorous 
rootstocks are more vulnerable- why is this?
    I foolishly went ahead and pruned my dwarf apples in late February, 
and now the temperatures are plunging below 0 F (-18 C) at night.  
Should I be alarmed?  There is nothing I can do but wonder, which has 
led me to this question.
