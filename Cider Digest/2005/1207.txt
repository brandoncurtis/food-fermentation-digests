In re cider mills,


I have a nineteenth-century W. O. Hickok Keystone Cider Mill, which I 
recently restored using white oak timbers. In trying to get more 
information on this beast, I contacted the W, O, Hickok Company in 
Harrisburg, PA, which I understand is now out of business. They were 
mainly manufacturers of machines that produced ruled paper and 
book-binding presses, but which made cider mills for many years, 
ending just after World War II.  I have a xerox copy of a book they 
published, titled "Between the Lines,"  giving the history of the 
company.

Does anybody know of a US source for narrow-range pH paper?  I know that
Andrew had found some in the UK, but I've been unable to Google up a
source for anything in the US.  The best I can find is accurate to 0.5,
which is just not enough.  The ideal would be something like a range of
3-4, able to be read to 0.2.  (OK, 0.1 would be "more ideal" but I'm
trying to be realistic!)


Yes, I could get a pH meter.  But no, that doesn't seem like a good idea--
they need a bit of pampering, and especially when I'd only be using it
for a little while in the fall it would be easy to neglect it and ruin
the electrode.  IF the narrow-range papers could be had, they'd be a much
better method.

I called today to inquire if there was still space for the 'Cider School' 
session they are planning on holding April 25-29th and was told they had 
only had two folks sign up so far.  Since they feel they need to 
pretty-much fill up the course to make it pay for itself they are 
considering cancelling it.  So since I didn't remember seeing a mention of 
the upcoming April session on the digest I thought I'd mention it 
(again?).  Since I'd like to participate - go sign up! ;)

The coordinator at Mt. Vernon did say that if your interested to be sure 
and call by no later than the 15th of this month since that is when they 
need to make their cancellation decision.
