Paper test strips in the pH range of 2.8 to 4.4 are available from Homebrew
Heaven at http://www.homebrewheaven.com/htmlcatWineTesting.htm (and they're
probably available elsewhere as well).  They come with a small color chart
with pH increments of 0.2.  They're difficult to read if you don't have a
decent spectrum of light.  Daylight is best, but I've found that they're not
too bad if you read under a combination of bright fluorescent and
incandescent light.  I bought some a few months ago to see how well they
work and how convenient they are to use.  When the container holding my pH
electrode and pH 4.0 buffer solution tipped over and spilled the contents it
was good to have the paper strips as a backup.   The paper is labeled as
"'Precision' pH Control Paper No. 2844" The label also indicates that the
supplier is Precision Labs, Inc. of West Chester, Ohio.  If I could find
another similar type of paper I'd probably use it concurrently to get more
confidence in my reading.  When I first used them the readings agreed
closely with the pH meter.  With more recent batches of cider, however, I've
found that none of the colors on the chart matches the color seen on the
test strip until the strip dries and I wish that I'd ordered more pH buffer
solution for the meter.

Does anybody know of a US source for narrow-range pH paper?

Try  www.eckraus.com , I think they might have what you want, $5.50 per 100

Googling with "ph strips" turned up several sources selling what may
be the same product: range 2.5 - 4.5, accuracy 0.2 or 0.3 (which I
hope means a usable gradation of 0.2 rather than an error of +/- 0.2).

Hi All,


Long time mead maker, delving into making cider, I want to make a good
basic hard sparkling cider -- As a point of reference, I've purchased
'The Art of Cidermaking' by Paul Correnty:
1) Paul has a recipe for a new england cider that calls for powdered
tannin -- is this necessary?


2) What do you prefer for yeast? I have Lalvin EC-1118 and K1-V1116 in
my refrigerator, but would purchase another if it would be better? (I
like my meads on the dry side)


3) What should I shoot for a SG? Paul was a little vague on that point
somewhere around 1.060?


Steve

Thanks to the good offices of CD subscribers (both on and off list) I have
various sources of narrow-range pH paper.  I'll check them out and report
back on what works.  Great!  And I really do think this is a better
approach for most (small-scale) cidermaking purposes than a pH meter.


Thanks to all who helped.


In the course of pursuing the question, I got my share of bad web sites--
the "you can't look without cookies and registering", the seven-levels-down
before you get to the item you want (and then maybe the link is broken),
all that stuff.  But I figure those folks will be weeded out by normal
business pressure (if you won't take money and deliver product, you're
history).


I also got some education in presenting queries...such as the difference
between "pH paper" and "pH strips".  Writing useful queries remains an art,
one for which all my software experience is at best useless.


Now what I want is a simple dip-strip test for tannin!
