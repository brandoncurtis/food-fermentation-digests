All this talk of pH meters has reminded me of a question I have about 
them.  Does the sensor really need replacing every year?  This is what 
the catalogs say, but it seems like a shame to throw out a sensor that 
you've only used for a brief period every autumn.  Can they be stored 
in such a way as to protect them?

In a recent posting, Drew Zimmerman signed himself:

Hmmm...I don't recall reading anything on the Cider Digest about a
"Red Barn Cider".


Drew - Is there something you'd like to tell us?  :-)
