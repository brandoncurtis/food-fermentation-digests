There is nothing wrong with your refractometer  It is the *alcohol*
which is the soluble non-sugar compound that gives the apparent 4.25
Brix reading!! That's why you cannot use a refractometer directly to
measure the loss of sugar - you should use a hydrometer for this.
Apparent Brix 4.25 and SG 0.995 (the SG of 0.950 you quote is presumably
a typo!) gives a value of 8.2% alcohol (by the Wurdig wine equation).

Thanks for your perspectives and I'm sorry I have to disagree with you
both!  I have done the distillation method myself many times in a lab -
it may not be complex in principle but it's quite unsuitable for
untrained hands in a kitchen!  It is difficult to get 100% recovery of
the alcohol into the distillate unless you use special and expensive
glassware (known in the UK as an Excise condenser).  Large errors can be
introduced by poor distillation technique and alcohol vapour is easily
lost. The accurate measurement of the distillate density by hydrometer
then requires absolutely accurate temperature control and a specially
calibrated and expensive alcohol hydrometer (or an accurate
temperature-controlled refractometer or a Parr density meter or a
density bottle and 5 place analytical balance or some other similarly
very expensive device), It's OK if you have a trained technician doing
it daily but it's not the sort of thing for someone doing it on a casual
basis just a few times a year!  In fact real analytical labs hardly use
that method at all now, because it's so laborious and GC is so much
speedier.

In the UK we have a 1% margin on ciders and it seems that measuring
'loss by SG' and multiplying by a fudge factor (typically given as 7.5) is
almost as good as anything to give alcohol levels to meet that.
Certainly it's very cheap! Not so helpful if ciders are blended, watered
or whatever, since then you can lose track of what's going on. So a
method for finished product would still be handy.

Re my other posting on this topic ... is ebulliometry more or less
tricky to do reliably than distillation and density measurement??  I've
never used an ebulliometer. They are widely available (even in the UK).
The German speaking wine world seems to think highly of them

When the wine Reflectoquant was first introduced (5 years ago?) I don't
believe it did alcohol - I think that's a newly added kit. I wonder what
the chemistry is - maybe dichromate oxidation as mentioned by Brown
Snout (and as formerly used in police breathalysers)? The ability to measure
other things could be a great help. Often with these kits the test
strips come in packs of 50 or so but only have a short shelf life.

Do you mean just that? You measure the loss in SG, multiply by the 7.5
fudge factor and then subtract 0.75% from the final alcohol level?

I am likely even further back than the freshest of the beginners, now in my 
second year of trying to rebuild an old orchard in So. Ore. (while still living 
in So. Calif. As one can expect, the possibilities are endless, as are the 
potential heartbreaks... 
Thus leading to my question for the group: I am currently raising a new batch 
of apple/pear trees down here in So. Calif.-about 15 for now. They are all 
neatly planted in peat pots and should be transeferred within the next 18 months
to their final living quarters-a 1/4tr. acre bordering Waldo Rd. in Josephine 
Co., Ore. (about 5 miles north of the California border). After two weeks of 
unbelievably typical So. Cal. weather, (ranging from 70 to 90 degrees F), I 
have found that three particular trees have simply refused to show any signs of 
coming out of dormancy: Theilersbirne, Blakeney Red and Gelbmostler...strangely,
these three are all pear varieties. Now up in Ore., I am more likely to 
lose the apple trees while the pears seem to have their own haven. Has anyone 
else had any experience with these three particulars and would you say they are 
simply slow to break or have I possibly done something wrong that I might 
"right" before it's to late?
Otherwise, I have also been working with some experimental seed stock from 
Cornell University & Philip Forsline-a truly nice fellow. Thus far, I've had 90%
ave. germination with 18 month old seeds on four separate groups (not named, 
only numbered). My hope is to raise these seedlings for three years, clone 
scions from their parents to 50% of them and try cloning other varieties to the 
rest-looking for any possible improvements in apple growing/survival in the "Wal
do" area. Note: Pear trees were recorded as having been grown as far back as 
the 1850s when this was a thriving mining community and some wild pear trees 
still survive there today-even after it was mined away through hydrolics ( so 
we're talkin' two inches or so of soil in some places).
many thanks in advance

Any advice on when the optimal window is to topwork seedlings with cider
scions? I'm at silvertip now and gittin' antsy. Some rule of thumb
relating to apple or another tree (i.e. shablow bloom) would be
appreciated.

There is something wrong with your refractometer, or the formulas/tables 
that you are using.  If there were non-fermentable solids they would 
affect the hydrometer reading.  Since the hydrometer is definately 
showing a complete fermentation, and your reagent test strips also show 
no glucose then it is safe to say that fermentation is complete.


Since you get an accurate reading from the refractometer when using a 
20% sugar solution I would tend to think that the error is actually in 
the formulas, or tables, that you are using to convert the refractometer 
reading to brix.  Perhaps the tables/formulas are not accuarately 
accounting for alcohol present in the finished cider, hence the 
accuarate reading for a sugar solution, but an inaccuarate reading at 
the end of fermentation, when alcohol affects the reading of the 
refractometer, just as it does that of a hydrometer.

I have access to an Anton Paar Alcolizer and the results I get are 
consistent with the results I get using my ebulliometer.
