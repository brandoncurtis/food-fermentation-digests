I am interested in the discussion on alcohol measurement. Being a very small
producer, I have never been able to justify buying some of the sophisticated
equipment that is available for this purpose, nor to afford the services of an
analytical laboratory. So I use and have used the brewers' method.


The original gravity is measured at the start of fermentation, and again when
fermentation is completed. Subtracting the latter from the former and
multiplying by 0.1285 gives the percentage of alcohol by volume.


For instance, take an o.g of 1058 and a final gravity of 1002. 58-2 = 56 x
0.1285 = 7.196. Call it 7.2. I was told this method by a neighbouring micro
brewer and its seems to work OK. At least the local Trading Standards
department, who take a bottle away for assessment every year, seem quite happy.


The only piece of highly-sophisticated (!) measuring equipment that I have
purchased for this purpose is a thing called a Vinometer. This is a fine glass
capillary tube about 4 inches long graduated from 0 to 25 and with a small
funnel at one end. You fill the funnel with the liquid to be measured and wait
until it runs out the other end and there are no bubbles in it. Turn it upside
down and take a reading when the movement of the liquid stabilises.


This cost me �5; the price of two pints of good ale over here, and is a
complete waste of money!

I am attempting to assemble a small collection of perry pears and cider 
apples. I have discovered that while apples are (generally) universally 
compatible with all the usual rootstocks, pears are generally much 
choosier about which rootstock on which they can be grafted. Does 
anyone know of a table of compatible rootstocks for perry and dessert 
pears? Doesn't have to be in English; French or Spanish is okay. Does 
anyone have any information on the rumoured suitability of Chinese haw 
as a dwarfing rootstock for pears?

I've tried one, and found it was a waste of money.  It won't work--or
at least is uselessly inaccurate--unless you have a clear (nothing
suspended), still (no carbonation), completely dry (no residual sugar)
beverage to test.


I saw them in homebrew/wine shops quite a while back, but haven't seen
them in recent years.  I think that might be a testimonial (!) to their
usefulness.
