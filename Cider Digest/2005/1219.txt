howdy all...


I'm an herbalist and cider lover (hard implied) in SE Michigan, and am
wondering a few things... first, is anyone else on this list from
around these parts?  I'm real interested in making some cider, but
till then would like to find some better ciders than woodchuck and
strongbow.  I know that al-mar orchards makes some hard cider, bottled
in wine bottles, and am wondering if that's good?  I'm looking to get
(and later make) more of a bottled ale type cider.


Any leads on sources would be appreciated.

G'day folks,
 
It appears that I might be a bit too much of a romantic about the apple,
than the wife, as  she had a few gripes about today's event in Oz at
Kellybrook Winery, at Wonga Park in Melbourne.
 
So I thought, hmm, maybe ask a few of the salties about what they thought
was the makings of the perfect festival.
 
So ladies, and germs, what do you think are the hallmarks of a really good
festival (with the basis being cider of course).????
 
Many thanks for your insights.
 
Cheers
Mark E. in Oz

Does anybody know of a source for the Moorcroft perry pear in the US?
I've checked "the usual suspects".  Based on its reputation, I would
have expected it to be available here.  Am I missing something?
