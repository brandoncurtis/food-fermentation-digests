One factor mentioned in "Principles and Practice of Perry-Making" (chapter
by Pollard and Beech in Luckwill and Pollard's _Perry_Pears_) is that some
perry pears have a lot of citric acid.  This can be turned into acetic acid
by some lactic-acid bacteria--which means it can happen anaerobically.
This is unexpected by cidermakers who normally see only acetobacter as a
source of acetic acid (vinegar) production...since acetobacter work
aerobically and actually need substantial oxygen to work.  Keeping vessels
topped-up and perhaps blanketed with CO2 won't help for that perry path
to acetification.


I don't know if that's the only path to an excessively acetic character.

The received wisdom on this (as recited by Pollard and Beech in the 
Luckwill and Pollard book "Perry Pears"  1963) is that pears contain 
relatively high amounts of citric acid (not high in absolute terms but 
high in proportion to the malic).  At the high pH typical of English 
perry pears, this is often degraded anaerobically on storage by lactic 
acid bacteria to give acetic acid and hence the taint (which in fact is 
more likely to be ethyl acetate but the origin is the same).  Fred Beech 
used to recommend the addition of an extra 50 ppm SO2 over and above the 
expected amount during storage in order to combat this.


I have virtually no practical experience of perry making and so can't 
comment personally. If there is a difference between the French and 
English perries it could perhaps be due to lower pH in French perries?? 
I can't comment with authority since I know even less about French perry 
than I do about English!


I don't think there are many terpenes in pears but there are certainly 
some unusual esters (ethyl dodecenoate for instance) which are 
characteristic of pear itself. I have certainly tasted some perries in 
which this flavour is coming through.  Sadly I don't know of any modern 
work on the volatile composition of perries which would help us to 
understand this fully.

I'm glad to see some interest in perry in this digest.  I made some 
perry back in 2002.  It was/is really great stuff.  I bought the 
juice locally and do not know what sort of pears the juice came from. 
But it was very drinkable.  At the  time I started it I couldn't find 
much info about how it should be treated differently than regular 
apple cider.


My pear batch this year does not look like it turned out too well.  I 
have something white growing on top of it.  It has been bottled and 
each of the bottles has a little of the white growth on top.  I am 
wondering if I should have adjusted the pH to be more acidic, or used 
more sulfite.

Does anyone out there know where I might find a small Rack and Cloth
press of pressing apple cider? I am located in the Okanagan Valley in
Western Canada.
Thanks,

Subject: small wineries (and cidermakers) win in US case
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>

of interest to our US readers, and perhaps of some passing interest to the
rest of the cider-drinking world...


Yesterday, 16 May, the US Supreme Court ruled in a case on interstate
shipping of wine (consolidated from a couple of complaints) that states
cannot impose different regulations for in-state and out-of-state direct
ordering/shipping to consumers.


This is a big win for small wineries (and we would presume small
cidermakers just as well).  They have been hampered in reaching customers
in other states because of laws restricting interstate shipment...in
effect, if a winery couldn't get big enough to interest a distributor,
it couldn't get out of its own area.  Seen from the consumer side, there
have been lots of wines/ciders we couldn't get without visiting the
producers directly.  It appears that states which do allow shipments now
from in-state producers will be likely to open up so that we can order
directly via phone or WWWeb from out-of-state producers.  (It will take
a little while for all this to settle out, I'm sure.)


The case revolved around a conflict between Article IV of the Constitution
(commerce clauses) which prohibits inter-state tarriffs and restrictions
on commerce, against the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition, which gave
the states the right to regulate the sale of alcohol.  The decision went
as it did because the majority (5-4) held that the challenged laws were
clearly intended only for local protectionism.  States can still restrict
shipments of alcohol to their citizens, but the restrictions must be
uniform across in-state and out-of-state producers.


The majority opinion was written by Justice Kennedy, joined by Souter,
Ginsburg, Scalia, and Breyer.
