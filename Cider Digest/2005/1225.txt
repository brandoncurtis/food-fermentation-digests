David pickering asks about Frequin Rouge in CD#1224 - especially as it's
classification as 'bitter'.


>From my research, David, French cidre makers use a slightly different
classification system than the English.  The main catagories are douce,
douce-amer & amer-douce, amere, acidulous and complete.


So sweet-bitter and bitter-sweet but no 'bitter-sharp'.  By Douce, they
tend to mean perfumed, as well as simply sweet.


Try looking at the website of Mordus de la Pomme - the Society of the
Bitten Apple at www.fruitsdebretagne.net


I have a Frequin Rouge in my collection.  It's only had a couple apples
so far.  I seem to remember that it's a sharp apple with hard bitters -
but my notes fail me, there are none recorded.

That's about the only way. You can possibly combine it with filtration.
The idea is to remove each successive yeast crop so the cider eventually
becomes so starved of nitrogen it can ferment no further. Its success
rather depends on how much nitrogen was there in the first place.

The principle of keeving is that the pectin in the juice is enzymically
demethylated to the pectate anion, which combines with calcium to form a
calcium pectate gel. This rises to the top of the juice and with it
traps much of the nitrogenous material which is cationic. (Glossary -
anions are negatively charged, cations are positively charged).  The
juice is then racked away from the gel ('le chapeau brun' en Francais).
Hence the amino acids required for growth are also removed and the
subsequent cider ferments slowly. Repeated later racking then helps to
maintain a naturally sweet cider.


The lime is a source of calcium to be sure that enough is present. You
don't need a lot (just a few hundreds of parts per million) and it
doesn't affect the acidity appreciably. Nowadays we prefer to use food
grade calcium chloride (the chloride ion keeps the yeast growth down) and
some of us also add a special pectin methyl esterase enzyme (cue Gary
Awdey who has worked hard to make such an enzyme available to cider
hobbyists in North America. Those of us in Europe can buy it in from
France).

I suspect this is a semantic misunderstanding across the English
Channel.  The 'traditional' British system was actually devised early in
the 20th century by Professor Barker at Long Ashton and contains the
four categories mentioned.  The parallel French system divides primarily
into three categories, 'douce' (sweet), 'amere' (bitter) and 'aigre'
(sharp).  In this classification Frequin Rouge is classified as 'amere'
or bitter (source - Bore and Fleckinger 'Les pommiers a Cidre').  Since
this is a French (Breton) cultivar I suspect the term has been
translated straight from French sources.


However, things are actually more complicated than I describe because
French cidermakers do often hybridise the three terms, and do not
necessarily see sharp boundaries between the categories (described in
one French manual I have as 'assez elastique'!). Hence 'douce-amere' for
'bittersweet' is commonly encountered in French literature, as well as
'amere-douce'  and 'amere' on its own. You will have to ask a Frenchman
for the subtleties here but I rather think that 'amere' on its own
refers to what we call a 'hard bittersweet' while 'douce-amere' is more
of a 'soft bittersweet'.  In effect it is not a chemical description,
but a sensory one, so the perceived sugar / tannin balance will be part
of the definition.


Even more confused now?

Re: David's question from last digest, I have been working a bit more with 
halting fermentation lately. There is so much to cover under this topic, so 
I'll just touch on a few things.  The best quick resource for learning a 
bit about this type of cidermaking, I'll plug Andrew Lea's site 
(http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/) and specifically the 
page on finishing a sweet cider 
(http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/part4.htm).


That said, I have been aiming towards a smoother product over the years.  I 
manage an experimental orchard planted primarily to desert apples, and so 
with judicious blending with local crabs have been developing a decent but 
often bone-dry drink.  Here's where I've changed things:


1. Since I've run the show there for about five years, I have been able to 
manage non-research plots to give me fruit low in nitrogen.  I manage these 
by fertilizer and pruning practices, withholding any N inputs and leaving 
the trees intentionally a bit shaggy.  The fellow who squeezes my juice 
also avoids running sprayed fruit through his mill, so these trees are a 
bit stressed with bugs and disease, and may offer better cider flavors 
because of it (purely speculation). Unfortunately the block which I have 
used primarily for this, and from which I have finally learned to make a 
pretty good cider, is scheduled for removal this year. (Fortunately my own 
trees should start bearing before too long).


2. Wild yeast.  I have used numerous cultures and always return to the wild 
yeast, particularly the stuff collected from the abovementioned mill. I 
sulfite to 50-75 ppm at the squeeze, then let it go on its own.


3. Since buying a house in 2002, I have been able to carefully control 
fermentation temperatures after building a cold room in the 
basement.  Basically it's just a framed up and walled off insulated corner 
of the room.  I do not have any active cooler in there, but I can manage 
the room in winter to maintain 35-40 Fahrenheit if desired by venting to 
the outside through a small window.  My furnace is on the other side of the 
wall and with a good apple wood fire cranking the basement at large will be 
80 F.  With the window closed, the room can maintain 50F all winter, and 
maxes out at 65F in the summer. Fermentation is begun outdoors in cool 
October temperatures (see keeving below), then the juice siphoned through 
the window to the cold room where I maintain it around 45F until about 
December, then turn the cooler on and let it simmer all winter. Ideally I 
think I might let it go to 1.015 or so at 50F, then chill the room and 
rack, letting it simmer after that until spring or whenever it 
stabilizes.  This winter I may have chilled it too quickly, as a good bit 
of cider (seven carboys) is stuck around 1.020, a little sweeter than I'd like.


4. Keeving. In 2003 I tried a quick and dirty keeve, not using any enzymes 
or even the right chemicals (I had some gypsum and potassium chloride on 
hand).  Let me note that a keeve is different than racking, as alluded to 
in the previous post.  A keeve is performed on pre-fermented juice and 
serves to further knock the nutrient load down to starve the yeast into 
early submission.  Even if you can't stop the yeast early (sweet), I 
believe that the slower ferment produces a fruitier, more aromatic 
cider.  Anyway, my 'semi-keeve' in 2003 seemed to work fairly well (see 
awards below).
In 2004 I took part in Gary Awdey's enzyme project (thanks, Gary, you've 
got some coming one of these days), where the cider was treated properly 
with PME enzyme, and Calcium Chloride.  Performing this keeve outdoors in 
October in chilly Vermont took awhile, and I confess I racked the juice 
into the basement before the complete chapeau brun had formed.  I did, 
however, rack it off of a good bit of gelatinous gunk. The cider was then 
allowed to settle again in carboys or an oak barrel where the keeving 
process again took hold.  Unfortunately I was leavng for a week in Arizona 
so had to rack early again, but I did get the beginnings of the 'brain in 
the jar' (http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/keeve.htm) 
and managed to leave a good bit of gunk behind.  This double-half-keeved 
juice fermented really slowly in the glass, and today, seven months later, 
is still around 1.020, but working a little quicker with the rise in cellar 
temperature that came with spring. Interestingly enough, I keeved one batch 
solely in a carboy as opposed to the 200 liter drum outside, and racked it 
only once. This batch fermented a tad quicker than its bulk-keeved 
counterpart (same original juice) and was bottled/kegged at 1.016.


5. Chemicals, as necessary.  With the previously mentioned sweet cider in 
bottle/keg, I knew I would have to avoid refermentation.  I occasionally 
use sulfite at bottling, but don't worry about it much with higher alcohol 
(7%), dry ciders.  With this stuff coming in around 4.5% abv, and being 
quite sweet, I added 50 ppm sulfite and a dosage of K sorbate to help it keep.


Results? (http://www.mashers.org/comp_2005/comp_results.html)


I entered three ciders this year in the Vermont Homebrew Competition.  I 
haven't bothered with the comps in some time, disillusioned by the old 
standards and what I considered poor judging criteria.  Well, with the new 
AHA guidelines, I went to it.


Cider 1: Standard Cider, Common:  This Was the 'double-half-keeved' juice 
from 2003, mostly dessert (Liberty, Haralson, Nova Easy Gro) fruit with a 
touch of Redfield crab.  Fermented cold, In glass, I bottled when the juice 
had settled clear but with a touch of residual sugar.  Final gravity was 
1.002. First Place.


Cider 2: Standard Cider, English: Same blend above, with an additional 30% 
juice consisting of crabs (flame and Golden Hornet) and Poverty Lane cider 
fruit (Stoke Red/Ashton Bitter). Fermented in a well-used whiskey barrel 
(bourbon once, Canadian whisky at least once, and this was its second batch 
of cider). Fermented bone dry, with a tart, tannic taste. Second Place.


Cider 3: Standard Cider, French:  It was sweet and a bit fizzy from forced 
carbonation so I called it French. But on second thought this should have 
bees in the Specialty/other category.  Anyway, this was the 2004, 
carboy-keeved cider, bottled at 1.016.  The juice blend used a lot of 
Redfield crab, a red-fleshed apple which colored the cider red and confused 
the judges.  It was also a bit on the too sweet side.  Didn't place.


Anyway, that's my thoughts on the subject for now.....


Sorry to take so long.

When the pulp is left for a day before pressing the enzymes present
naturally in the fruit (including pectin methyl esterase) help to begin
breaking down the physical structure on a molecular level.  This may improve
yield somewhat by breaking down cell walls to permit greater release of
juice but of more importance is the greater amount of pectin that ends up
suspended in the juice.  If you have a sufficiently large concentration of
pectin in the juice and add a sufficient concentration of calcium ions (lime
is a traditional source of this) then the calcium binds the suspended pectin
together through a process of molecular cross-linkage into a gelatinous
mass.  Ideally this mass rises to the surface (the Chapeau Brun or "brown
cap") buoyed by the small bubbles of incipient fermentation, and becomes
more compact, leaving clear juice below.  One of the things that this
keeving does is bind many of the impurities (eg spoilage bacteria) that may
be present in the juice to the so they may be removed with the brown cap.
Another important thing it does is bind up and remove some critical
nutrients (amino acids, often simply referred to as the nitrogen) so that
yeast action is partially inhibited.  Fermentation in cider produced by this
method is slow, usually done at fairly low temperature to produce more
desirable phenolics.  Ideally after a successful keeve the growth of yeast
will deplete the remaining critical nutrients.  These nutrients are removed
with the yeast by racking the clear juice away from yeast after it settles.
It may take more than one racking to remove enough of the nitrogen.
However the combination of nutrient depletion and the alcohol produced
during fermentation (and CO2 pressure that develops after the cider is
bottled) helps to inhibit further yeast growth and fermentation before the
sugar is entirely consumed.  This process permits the production of a
RELATIVELY stable cider with lower alchohol and higher residual sweetness
than would be produced otherwise.  There are other ways to improve the
stability to meet our modern concept of shelf life (eg pasturization or
addition of preservatives) but this was a traditional way to produce very
pleasant, sweeter cider and keep it that way for significantly more than a
few weeks.
