Subject: Cider and Gueuze
From: Tim Bray <tbray@mcn.org>

Just returned from a trip to Belgium, where I finally managed to try a 
Gueuze.  I'd not been interested in them previously, as the description 
doesn't sound appealing to me, but wanted to get an idea what the 
wild-yeast flavor profile was.  I suspected it might be similar to what I'm 
getting in my spontaneously fermented cider - and I was right!  The Gueuze 
I had tasted very much like my cider: slightly sour, a little bitter, dry 
and refreshing.  It was just different in being made from malt instead of 
apple juice.


Now I'm left trying to decide if this is a Good Thing or not...  I actually 
liked the Gueuze, somewhat to my surprise, probably because I've become 
conditioned to the taste of my cider.  It would be a great accompaniment to 
certain kinds of strongly-flavored or fatty foods (strong cheese, nuts, 
salami).   But it doesn't taste at all like beer, nor does my cider taste 
like most other ciders.


Too soon to tell whether the wild flora are affecting the flavor of last 
year's crop, most of which I'm fermenting with cultured yeasts (4 different 
varieties).  Just put the first of it into the bottle... Russet Cider made 
with Wyeast Cider strain.


(BTW, I also found out how Gueuze is pronounced.  Notice I did not say that 
I _learned how_ to pronounce it... I got a couple of Dutch speakers to walk 
me through it, but when I tried ordering it, got a blank stare.)


Cheers,
Tim

Many thanks to all who took the trouble to respond to my query


> Does anyone know of a table of compatible rootstocks for perry and
> dessert pears? ?
>
The responses on-list you know. I also received a response off-list
suggesting that perry pears can be grafted directly onto Quince,
producing trees which at their most vigourous were about the size of a
half standard apple tree, both in height and canopy, but many specimens
exhibited a non-standard shape and some were quite dwarfed or straggly.

The apple cultivar Sunrise from Summerland BC has been fruited
sucessfully at our location in Ontario ( 1 hour north of Toronto) for
several years. This year it is now in flower and thus has a higher
degree of winter hardiness than the following cultivars which were
winter killed or badly damaged: Gala, Jonagold, Elstar, Cox Orange,
Bramleys, Fiesta. Sunrise has high consumer acceptance as a fresh market
variety, and should make a good addition to a blended cider.

I'm curious - why are you protecting this merchant, instead of protecting 
the rest of us from him?


Name your sources, good and bad, and let the marketplace sort them out.  If 
these people are no good, please let the rest of us know who they are, so 
we can avoid repeating your mistakes.


If it was Southmeadow, then your experience is consistent with what I've 
heard from others.  Lousy customer service,  wrongly labeled trees, etc.


Cummins, OTOH, is of the very best.  So is Cider Hill Nursery (Lee 
Elliott), in my experience.


Thanks,
Tim

I was about to write a funny quip about how to get kids to eat more
scrapple when I noticed that the webpage for grapples indicates that it
rhymes with Naples (Italy)=2E  Scrape that idea=2E=2E=2E

I've never used it myself, but there is a form of lysozyme on the market 
which claims to destroy ML bacteria while presumably leaving yeassts 
unaffected.   See http://www.winemakermag.com/feature/201.html

I'm from the area where the grapple was born, Andrew Lea has it right,
it's a grape(concord) flavored Fuji. I have used the grape concentrate as
a bird repellent on sweet cherries, it's said birds won't eat concord
grapes and I guess that's true but it didn't keep the birds away from my
cherries, at least to any great extent. The label on this product warns
that unless sufficient time has passed the cherries will have a grape
flavor, about ten days I think. The grapple must have some appeal because
it has been on the market for a year or two.

For anyone interested in some of the background leading up to the recent
Supreme Court decisions in Michigan and New York (and related court rulings
in some other states) there is an interesting article in the Houston Law
Review.  It is a bit dated (17 months old) but at a weighty 35 pages it is a
nice overview of the main legal issues.  Article at
http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/40-4%20pdf%20files/Wallerc7g3.
pdf.


Have also noted with interest how mention of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers
(MADD) gets trotted out again and again in the media when interstate
shipment is covered.  This seems to serve the media spin purposes of the
three-tiered distribution infrastructure (well, maintly the distributors)
but in more than one case MADD reportedly withdrew from the fight later when
it became absolutely clear that only the ability of the distributors to
maintain their monopoly (not availability of wine to minors via the
internet) was at the heart of the matter.
