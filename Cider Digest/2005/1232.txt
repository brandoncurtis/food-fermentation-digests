Re my previous note on Sunrise apple. I was not speaking of Sunrise
plus, I have no knowledge of this variety, I was speaking of the Sunrise
cultivar from BC. I am merely passing on some info that I have gathered
from growing this variety for a number of years in a climate not
conducive to many varieties. My notes are from my orchards, not a
catalog description.
  There are many growers who make there own cider not from Foxwhelps and
Dabinetts, but from a mixture of varieties in their orchard. To these
growers I refer the comment that Sunrise would be a welcome addition to
their product, moreso than the Mac, Paulared, Delicious types. I do not
have scientific data on the cider merits of Sunrise, just passing on
some info that some may find useful, if not, feel free to disregard.
Eric.

   " My question is this: Is it O.K.
to use half gallon "growler" brown glass beer bottles with screw tops?"


I don't know what is proper for the cider, but I love those screw top large
beer jugs.  Seal has never been a problem for me ( over a year on some
batches), just clean them with a bleach solution and triple rinse with clean
hot water.

Here's my method for cleaning bottles:


3/4 cup of TSP per 5 gallons of hot water.
Start adding hot water to container and then start adding the TSP
Take one bottle and stir with it to diffuse the TSP. If there are any clumps
busted them up with the bottom of the bottle.
Continue filling with water to dillute the TSP concentration.
Once completely filled SLOWLY add the bottles, allowing them to fill 
with the solution.
You will get some overflow to account for the volume of the glass, but 
that's natural.
Soak the bottles overnight, or at the very least for several hours.


Once that's done they labels usually peel off with no problem. Use a 
sponge to get rid of any glue or label residue.
Make sure you rinse the bottle throroughly. Be careful as the TSP makes 
them slippery.


Good luck!

Are there any list members who are growing an English cider apple called
Frederick?   I'm interested in hearing your thoughts about it (disease
resistance, annual/biennial bearing, fruit characteristics,
productivity, precocity, etc.) as well as potentially buying a bit of
scionwood for this coming Winter.   Please let me know.   Thanks.
