I'm interested in gathering together any information - statistical or
otherwise - that would help me get a clearer picture of cider trends,
particularly in the United States and Canada. Has the interest in cider
- - both drinking and making it - grown in the past decade and, if so,
how much? Has there been an increased production of artisanal ciders by
small scale commercial operations? And if so, are there any indicators of
increased public interest in the product? Would appreciate hearing about
any sources for this kind of information. Any similar info for Britain
and Europe would also be welcome.
    I did send an email off to Ron Irvine of the North West Cider Association
in Washington. He suggested the collective knowlege of the cider digest
might prove helpful.

I am growing a couple of Fredericks on MM106 here in Central Southern
England (its origin is in Monmouthshire about 100 miles to the West).
My orchard is about 15 years old. It is without doubt the most unruly
tree I have ever come across!  I  grow it nominally in centre leader
format but the branches break all over the place at very odd angles, so
it needs a lot of work to keep it under control.  The wood is quite thin
and whippy.  It is in effect a tip-bearer (or, if you like, the spurs
are about 6 inches long and very thin!). It has very large and quite
rounded and reflexed leaves, pretty distinct from most other cider trees
I grow.  I planted it because it was once a recommended UK 'vintage'
variety not because it's easy to grow.!  As regards pest and diseases it
is very susceptible to Brown Rot (Monilinia) and the fruits frequently
rot on the tree before they are ripe and can be harvested.  When it was
young it was a very light cropper and nearly every fruit succumbed in
this way. As it has become more mature this feature seems to be less
prevalent than it was and now I can get reasonably good crops in
alternate years (it is totally biennial with me).  Yield is less (maybe
only half?) than would be expected from say Dabinett of similar size.


The fruit is still prone to rot in store, however, so it needs
processing very quickly after harvest.  The apple is small and
red-flushed to dark wine-red and very aromatic with yellow flesh and it
is reputed to make a good light single variety cider although I have never
tried this.  The juice on its own is excellently flavoured though.  It
is a 'sharp' cultivar and I know from biochemical work I did at Long
Ashton many years ago that it lacks most of the catechin based 'tannins'
which are found in most other cider cultivars.  Maybe this is why it's
so rot susceptible.  There is a fruit picture on my website under <Cider
Apple Pictures> from the menu bar.


For several years when they were young I despaired of them being any value
to me (light cropping and rot propensity) but in recent years they have
become a little better-behaved and I am quite pleased to have them to add
to my overall cider blend.  I nearly got rid of them at one stage but
I'm glad I relented.  Definitely a grower's nightmare, though.  Probably
would be much more successful as a traditional standard than as any form
of dwarf tree.


Hope this helps.

I have a small orchard of cider apples in Vermont, and this year will 
be 3rd leaf for my trees.  This year my Major trees on M9 rootstock 
produced a "snowball bloom"  during good weather and with  good 
pollinating varieties in bloom nearby, and yet when all was said and 
done they ended up with a very small crop.  Is this typical for young 
trees- they produce far more blooms than they can turn into apples?  Or 
should I be looking at other explanations, such as micronutrient 
deficiencies, cold damage, etc.?
               Happy cidering!

I would like to hear from any of you that have done business with P&PM in
Merced California over the past two years. I will take any information you
have off-digest.
