About the spanish cider figures, the total production is about 100 million
litres, being 60 million litres (more or less)of traditional cider and 40 of
industrial sparkling cider. In our region, Asturias, we produce 45 million
litres of traditional natural cider and 37 of sparKling cider. In the Basque
Country they produce about 11-14 millions of traditional cider. The rest is
made in Navarra, Galicia and Cantabria.


Hoping this will be of your interest.

Hi all,


I received some pectin methyl-esterase (keeving enzyme) from Gary Awdey
about 9 months ago but (because I'm in Australia) I've only just had a
chance to use it.


I received 14mL, enough for 200L of apple juice. Given the time delay, I
assumed a modest activity loss and added 8mL to 100L juice. I also added
40g CaCl2 for the recommended 400ppm Ca++ and Cl- ions as well as 50ppm SO2
to knock off undesirables and delay the action of "good" yeasts. All of
this is as recommended on Andrew Lea's cidermaking site.


The juice was from a relatively young orchard and was 100% Sturmers - a
cooking apple rich in acids and quite sweet but with a reasonable level of
tannins for a non-cider variety. I'm sorry I can't give you any values for
acid or tannins but the SG of this juice was 1.056-7. This was blended with
crab apple juice to 5% total volume. This brought the OG to 1.058. The crab
apple juice is, obviously, very tannic (bitter) and acidic, with an SG of
1.065 (which surprised me - is crab apple juice always this sweet?). The
Sturmers were very ripe - falling off the tree for the most part - and
included a considerable amount of windfalls (which were washed, dried and
held for 3 weeks before juicing). Last year's pH values for the same juices
were ~3.4 for the Sturmer juice and 3.1 for the crab apple juice.


Due to their being commercially pressed, we were not able to hold the
crushed apples for any significant period before pressing. There was a
delay of 2 days between juicing and my dosing with the keeving concotion.
It was refrigerated for this time and so came to me at this (cold
temperature). After dosing, it was held at 10-12�C (50-54�F) outside my
house in a large plastic barrel.


I'm getting a little worried that after nearly 2 weeks I have seen very
little that I would describe as evidence of keeving. Only today, I saw the
first appearance some stuff that resembled 1cm round globs of egg-white.
There are also some specks of surface mould, which is unfortunate - and
probably due to the fact that the barrel was cleaned very thoroughly but
not sanitised. Because of the presence of mould I cannot be sure if the
"egg-white globs" are pectin gel or simply further mould.


Two questions: i) what should I do about the mould? I'll skim it off and
sanitise the lid, obviously, but should I add more SO2? ii) what can I
expect in terms of keeving? I believe I have done everything correctly so
far, but have my chances of a successful keeve been dashed by the presence
of mould? I seem to remember Andrew's description of early keeves included
some mould so I'm not too distraught. Is there anything I should do to
ensure the keeve works?


Thanks for any advice.

Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.


ps. please cc any advice to my posting address to speed up responses, thanks.
