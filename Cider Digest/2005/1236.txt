You should certainly skim off the mould if you can.  I wouldn't add any
more SO2. You have already added 50 ppm and at low pH  (< 3.4 ) that may
have suppressed the wild yeast rather a lot.  Also that is a fairly low
pH for the esterase enzyme to be working at so it may be slow. I don't
think a small amount of surface mould interferes with a keeve. Keeving
does require some incipient yeast activity in order to give buoyancy to
the keeve gel  (even though you have no gel yet!).  Did you add the SO2
first and then wait till next day to add the calcium chloride followed
by the enzyme separately?  The additions should not be all at once or
the enzyme may be inactivated.  I have had keeves take up to 2 weeks
before they start so do not give up hope just yet!  The 'globs' may be
what you're looking for.  They may be the start of something great or
they may be all you ever get!


To get a significant gel at all requires the presence of pectin + its
demethylation (by the enzyme) + calcium. I don't know the pectin content
of Sturmers - perhaps it's not very high. If you take one part of juice
and add to it two parts of pure alcohol (or denatured alcohol aka
methylated spirit here), then shake it, you should see a clot of pectin
forming after a few minutes if there is enough there. If you do not see
this then there is not enough pectin in the juice and keeving will never
work.  Just one other thought - since the juice was commercially pressed
- - they didn't already add a broad spectrum pectinase, did they?


In general terms I think it's worth pointing out that keeving was a
technique developed in France and England for specific low acid, high
tannin, high pectin cider apples. In those cultivars it can work well
and reliably. The new enzymes help this but even they are not magic.
Keeving was rarely if ever used successfully with sharp or bittersharp
UK cider cultivars.  In high acid apples like Sturmers keeving may never
work well for a variety of reasons - but we have no data!  Don't be too
disappointed if you find it doesn't - just regard yourself as a pioneer!

Maybe the seedling rootstock and standard habit makes a difference.  My 
dwarfs sound like quite different trees!

Certainly the pH of my soil is high (ca 7). The trees grow well enough, 
just that they are unruly and impossible to discipline!

Mine are not upright at all and difficult to train to a centre leader. 
They are quite strong but put out lots of whippy branches which bear at 
the tips. Not much proper spurring really.


This must be very confusing for John the original enquirer! Here are two 
people with quite different views of the same cultivar!

Jason asked about Major trees.  I have two of these and they have been slow 
to come into production.  Mine, planted in spring 2000 (on M7), did the 
snowball bloom last year as well, but only set a few fruits.  This year 
looks a little better, but it's hard to compare as everything is a little 
off this year.


The other end of the spectrum is King David (on G30), which was planted at 
the same time but grew twice as fast, and last year set an amazing crop of 
fruit.  This year they set more than any other trees, despite terrible 
spring weather.  Haven't yet bottled the King David blend from last year... 
it sure is pretty in the carboy though!


It is typical for young trees to bloom but not set much fruit.  For that 
matter, it is also typical of some varieties to do that later in life as 
well... I would not expect much from a 3-year-old tree, although M9 is 
supposed to encourage early production.


Major isn't the worst performer in my orchard; that distinction belongs to 
Margil, also on M7, planted at the same time as (and right next to) Major 
and King David.  It snowball blooms every year, and usually sets no fruit 
at all.  Last year, a terrific year for pollination, I think I got three 
apples from two Margil trees.  I'm reworking them into King Davids!


Cheers,
Tim

Hi all,


Thanks to Andrew and Tim for their responses (and to anyone else whose 
response I haven't seen yet).


I was impatient and decided to act before getting your responses but 
somehow did as you both suggested anyway. That is, I skimmed the mould from 
the surface (as Andrew said) and added a very small amount of sodium 
metabisulfite solution (equivalent to 8ppm for the entire batch) to the 
surface of the juice.


Unfortunately I'm still not seeing any signs of keeving. Andrew suggested 
two possibilities for this: i) I added the SO2, the CaCl2 and the PME at 
roughly the same time (although each was dissolved in separate portions of 
juice and added separately) which may have inactivated the PME. Can anyone 
explain how this occurs? Also, ii) I may not have sufficient pectin in the 
juice for a keeve. I now know this because I performed Andrew's 
alcohol-pectin test and got a negative. So I don't think this batch will 
ever keeve... ;(


In any case I still have enough PME for more than 50L juice AND when my 
brewing mate comes back from France in another months we have nearly 400kg 
more Sturmers to juice. Re-reading through others' keeving reports from the 
Northern Hemisphere's autumn/fall, I'm convinced that even with low pectin 
apples, maceration should provide enough for keeving. We weren't able to do 
this with the current batch, but maybe next time we can.


Again, thanks to everyone for their responses. I'll keep you Northerners 
informed (and jealous that it's not apple season there!) of our keeving 
practise.


Cheers

Hi all,


Having just re-read all the available keeving reports that Northern 
Hemispherians sent in ~6 months ago, I'm interested in how your cider is 
progressing. Anyone care to give the digest an update?


Thanks
Stuart.

In CD #1235 Stuart asks;
"...is crab apple juice always this sweet?"


My experience has been 'yes'.  I will qualify that by saying that I only
deal with crab apples that 1) we grow and 2) are at least as big as
cherries.


I've used, or at least sampled Dolgo (3 different sports), Ralph Shay,
Hopa, Red Scarlet, Chestnut, Americus, Wickson, and a yellow skinned,
yellow-fleshed wild seedling I call Cricket Creek Yellow.  I'm still
waiting on Geneva and Hewes to produce.


All are at least 16 Brix and range up to about 21 Brix at my site (Hopa
weighing in highest.)  Remarkably (?), they all still float in water.


Of the other apples in my collection, I'd lump Lady Apple in with the
'good' crabs based on fruit size and flowering habit. Likewise with
Binet Blanc.


They vary widely in tannin content.  Chestnut and Dolgo have little and
Red Scarlet is overpowering.  Binet Blanc is supposed to have some, but
I suspect that it's like any European bitter in a hot midwest climate -
blah.  Nice flavor, but only very subtle, earthy soft tannins.


Speaking of tannins, and specifically - how many tannins - I've noticed
that the water at my place, loaded with minerals as it is, turns purple
when it comes in contact with low levels of certain tannins.  Rinsing
out a merely juice-damp plastic pail turns the rinse water dark purple.
Now, to quantitate the effect!
