I noticed one question in Andrew Lea's comments that I didn't see an
answer to, which may have a bearing, too, and which may be important for
your next batch. Did the commercial presser of the Sturmer juice use
pectinase? If they did, then your result with the alcohol test would be
as you reported it, but would say nothing about the pectin content of
the actual apples, only that it had been destroyed by the pectinase.


I ask that since I almost always have used it in the past, as it
dramatically improves the ease of my pressing and, particularly, juice
yields. I wouldn't be surprised if your commercial presser adds it
routinely for the same reasons, if they regularly deal with apples.


If that's what happened, there may still be hope for your second try.


On a side note, thanks for the alcohol test suggestion, Andrew. I wasn't
aware of that, but it explains something that I had happen to me some
years ago which always puzzled me. I'd made some blackberry wine and
"syruped" the fermentation, as I wanted to go for a blackberry port.
When I got it to about the right sugar balance (about a year from making
it), I hit it with 190 proof alcohol to get it up to ~19% abv. Instant
berry jelly!


I left it alone (jelled in a carboy, with a lock), trying to decide what
to do with it. It held that way for about 3-4 years, if I remember, then
suddenly "broke." I was able to bottle it, and it was extremely good.
But I'd always wondered about the "jelly." Now I know. Could have used
pectinase, just didn't understand the chemistry (my brother, who is a
physical, not an organic, chemist, once responded to my question about
how pectin works with one word: "magic").

Subject: Loooong ferments

If long, slow ferments make good cider, I must be making some excellent 
stuff.  Of the 7 carboys filled last December, one was bottled in May, two 
finished just a week or two ago, and the rest are still perking!   Two of 
them are almost done, at SG 1.005 or so, and I will probably bottle them in 
the next few days.  But one is at SG 1.014, and one is at 1.02 - and that 
was the first batch pressed, back in November!


The one at 1.014 tastes really good, an excellent balance of sugar, acid, 
and tannin, so I racked it again and put it into the fridge, hoping to stun 
the remaining yeast.   I'm planning to put it up in champagne bottles, keep 
it in the fridge, and cross my fingers.  It's a blend of King David and 
Muscat deBernay, fermented with Lalvin D47 (I think - notes aren't clear).


The slow ferments are a little surprising, as I pitched wine yeast in some 
of them (71B and D47) and the temperatures haven't really been cold, 
averaging around 58 - 60 F most of the winter.


In other news, I am finishing off the last few bottles from the 2003 
vintage, which was not very good when bottled (WAY too much FYN and 
slightly sour, like a Gueuze) but has continued to improve in the 
bottle.  Usually I see a big jump in quality after about 6 months in 
bottle, but this stuff just slowly got better, and seems to still be 
improving after more than a year.


Anyone else had ciders take this long to ferment?

I think there would only be a problem of inactivation if everything was
mixed together before adding. It's just a matter of concentration. If
each addition is made quite separately and well mixed in to the bulk
before the next one, there shouldn't be a problem. It's always worth
adding the SO2 twelve hours before anything else though. The reason for
this is that 'neat' SO2 does most of its work in the first few hours and
a good majority of it is oxidised and/ or bound after a day or so.
Since it *may* inhibit the PME, it's worth keeping those additions
temporally separated.

I believe lack of soluble pectin is the most probable cause and I hope 
you are right that you can get more to diffuse out by maceration.  Some 
data I obtained on US juicing apples many years ago indicated a range of 
about 30:1  in pectin content across cultivars (from 70 ppm up to 2500 
ppm).  There was also a marked seasonal effect (i.e. fruit stored or 
not) even within the same cultivar (Cortland rose from about 70 ppm when 
fresh picked up to 700 ppm on storage).  This was just with normally 
pressed juice, of course. Maceration of milled fruit *may* have the same 
effect as slow release of cell wall pectin on prolonged storage.


It may also be possible to add the PME straight to the mash and to 
macerate in the presence of PME overnight to assist in the process, 
which may help to solubilise pectin. That would certainly be worth a 
controlled trial!


Good Luck!

Wow!  I'd like to know the iron levels at your place!  And what's the 
pH?  Do you drink the stuff??


Seriously, though, ferric iron (but not ferrous) reacts quite nicely 
with apple 'tannins' to give purple - black colours.  That is a kind of 
a crude way of distinguishing apple 'tannins' from oak 'tannins' because 
the gallic acid in the latter also reacts with ferrous iron.  This was 
first recorded by Thomas Andrew Knight in the late 1790's. So you are in 
good company!
