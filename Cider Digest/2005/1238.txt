This takes me back thirty years to when I has studying for my Higher 
National Certificate in Chemistry: the tannin test gave some rather nice 
coloured precipitates with different metals which came down at different 
pH's. I gave away my textbooks so I can't give you a list, but I think the 
author of the inorganic qualitative analysis textbook was Holness.

I am moving from Nowheresville, WV to Portland, OR within the next two 
months and I was wondering if there was anyone out there from this list.
