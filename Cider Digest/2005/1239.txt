What I'd find surprising if I had fermentation go that slowly is not having
the cider go "off" in one way or another before the alcohol started to come
up to some useful level.


Did you perhaps sulfite a bit too much?  I'm asking because that would
protect the juice from various other beasties and also slow down the yeast
a bunch.
