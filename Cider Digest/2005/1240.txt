I worried about that a lot, especially with the 71B batch that took over a 
month to get started.  But so far, no obvious nastiness.

I had exactly the same suspicion.   I mixed a 5% solution, then calculated 
the dose to yield 50 ppm in 5 gal, and added that to the top of each 
carboy.  So the sulfite concentration at the top would have been high; down 
at the bottom, not so much.   I couldn't get a good pH reading with the 
stupid strips, but the TA was only around 0.5%.   I use sulfite mainly to 
suppress mold, which only grows on the surface (where the oxygen is), and 
to help precipitate solids.


Cheers,

Question???
What effect doe's suspended solids and airation have on Hydromentre
readings in must, as both have a direct effect on the density of the
liquid.


And, if there is a profound change in S.G. resulting from this, has
anyone out-there calculated, charted, plottd or even noticed  the
changes.


To those more learned than I, this might seem like kindergarten stuff,
but as I have never heard, or read of this, maybe its not such a dumb
question after all.
