It's not a dumb question but it's not regarded as of practical
significance! The greatest effect of both is likely on the surface
tension which maybe could affect the SG as taken by a hydrometer by a
point or so either way.  More significant errors are probably due to
temperature (many hydrometers are calibrated for 20C or 68F but juice in
autumn is often a damn sight colder than that) or, in a fermenting
cider, the attachment of CO2 bubbles to the stem which need to be
'twiddled' away or the hydrometer will gradually rise to give a much
higher apparent gravity than is real.

I have decided to sell an extra copy of Bulmer's Pomona that I have.  It's 
still brand new in the box even thou it was published almost 20 years ago...

I have two 5 gallon batches and one 3 gallon batch that just won't clear.
One is fermenting verry slightly and the rest seem like they are doing
nothing.   I was thinking of bottling them but They are not clear yet.
Pressed them back in November.
