I saw the availability for sale of Bulmer's Pomona.   Sure looks tempting.
That made me wonder if I could post a query for books for which I have
been looking .  If so, they are:
Cider and Juice Apples;    Modern Cider Apple Production both of which
are by R.R. Williams (ed) (Long Ashton)


Also Liz Copas' A Somerset Pomona, 2001.   I hear she also has a more recent
book on insect management in cider apples in the EU.  I am interested in
more info on that as well.
