Subject: Obtaining the correct SO2 level in cider
From: "Carney, Shawn" <scarney@ball.com>

I have a few questions on sodium metabisulphite vs. potassium
metabisulphite and using one to obtain the correct SO2 level in cider.


For cider it seems standard to use sodium metabisulphite rather than
potassium metabisulphite, why is that?  Are there any negative effects
to using potassium metabisulphite?  A fellow cider digester informed me
the BATF only allows potassium metabisulfite and sulfur dioxide gas in
commercial production.


The smart way of adding SO2 seems to be using a standardized concoction
of sodium/potassium metabisulphite of 10% (or 5%, 15%, ....).  I used to
think that a 10% solution meant a solution that had 10% SO2.  Later I
found out that I was incorrect and it was actually 10% sodium
metabisulphite.  A 10% solution is easily obtained by adding enough
water to 100 grams of sodium metabisulphite to make 1 liter (because 1
liter of water weighs 1kg and 100g is 10% of 1 kg).  This solution will
actually be somewhere around 6.74% SO2 (seems like it should be called a
6.74% solution).


I can see this makes calculations easy if you calculate the amount of
10% solution needed by weight.  However calculating by weight especially
for small batches doesn't seem to be the standard, or most accurate way
of adding SO2.  For example if I have 20 lt of juice and I want it to
have 65 ppm (same as 65 mg per liter) SO2.
Then 20 * 65 mg/lt = 1300 mg or 1.3 g of SO2.  Since the 10% solution is
6.74% SO2 then I would need 1.3/.0674 = 19.28 grams of the 10% solution.
Does anybody use this method?


When calculating the amount of 10% solution by volume, it seems to get
kind of messy.  Unless there is an easier way to calculate it than what
I have been doing.  I hope someone will tell me.

Hi Deirdre,


I am the lucky owner of a copy of "Cider and Juice Apples" edited by R. 
R. Williams. I bought mine in 1999 from the Cider Museum in Hereford, 
England. The Marcher Apple Network list the book in their book section: 
http://www.marcherapple.net/books.htm
(Quote): Cider and Juice Apples: Growing and Processing by R. R. 
Williams (editor). Published by The University of Bristol. Available 
(post free) for �5.00 - cheques payable to NACM - from Gill Turner, 
Orcharding Department, H P Bulmer Ltd, The Cider Mills, Plough Lane, 
Hereford HR4 0LE. (Unquote).  
Not sure what the postage would be across the pond though...?


Good luck,
Ray.

Does anyone know of a supplier in the Midwest for cider pressing equipment?
In particular I need some pressing cloths for a hydraulic press.  The plates
are 24" square.  Also, any thoughts on sanitizing and lubricants?  Do people
like the quat/alcohol sanitizer?  Does anyone have experience (good or bad)
with food grade silicon lubricants?


Thanks in advance,
Peter Johnson

Dear Ciderists:
I want to thank Dick Dunn for his work at overseeing the Cider Digest. I know 
that he does not get paid. It must be a royal pain to sift through the 
incoming emails and to decide what information is of value to the readers. 


I am appreciative of his efforts, and for the fact that it is completely 
commercial-free.


It brightens my life knowing that there are people like Dick Dunn and Andrew 
Lea that are willing to share information so freely.


Thanks,

When racking cider from one tank to another (assuming you have the
luxury of a variable speed pump) what transfer speed should you be
aiming for?
Is there anything to watch out for that would imply that you're moving
the liquid too fast?  Is the only danger oxidization or is it possible
to damage the cider with the propeller just by running the pump too
fast?  Also, the tank that you are transferring from will be replacing
the volume of cider with air.  Because of this is there a danger in
transferring it too slow?
