Could someone investigate or verify that this is still available through
Bulmer?  I'm asking because (a) Ray got his copy quite a few years ago,
and (b) I tried to order a copy through Bulmer last year, and although
I had different contact info within Bulmer than what Ray shows, I didn't
even get a _pro_forma_ reply.  If a reader here has managed to get a copy
within the past year or so, that would be a reasonable indication.


(For my own part, I -do- have a copy through an embarrassing sequence
of events, but it's a good enough book that I'd like to see other folks
reliably be able to get it, even on this side of the puddle.)

Regarding Shawn's post to the Cider Digest on using sodium vs potassium 
metabisulfite, Shawn said:


> Then 20 * 65 mg/lt = 1300 mg or 1.3 g of SO2.  Since the 10% solution

This is incorrect. The math should be 1.3/(6.74/10). or 1.3/0.674=1.93.


Also, regarding the 10% solution, does the source say "10% sulfite" or 
does the say "10% sodium metabisulfite" or "10% potassium 
metabisulfite". My guess is the author may not be aware of the 
differences among these statements.

[Please see janitor's notes below]


Hear, hear!


Thanks for the reminder, Mr. Irvine.  It's much too
easy to take Mr. Dunn's contributions for granted.


Of course Mr. Dunn deserves thanks for every issue.
I wish I were creative enough to keep from just
repeating myself.


You're doing very good work, Mr. Dunn.  I'm always
glad to see another Digest in my e-mail.


Thanks

[Daniel, Ron, and the rest:
The kind words are appreciated, but honestly I don't do very much to keep
the Digest going, so I'd like to give a gentle nudge away from this sort
of article and toward the core (so to speak) of cidermaking.  As most
readers know, whenever a digest problem starts to repeat itself to where
I have to do a little work, I complain to you folks about it.  I'm lazy!
In any case, I get a lot more out of the digest than I put into it.
The best way to show your appreciation for the Cider Digest is to
contribute material to it!  It's been a bit thin lately.

Vigo Limited has an instruction sheet for the use of sodium metabisulphite.
This freely available.  If you would like a copy you should email Vigo -
info@vigoltd.com  asking for the instruction sheet for product code 94350
and we will send it to you as an attachment.  It is quite straightforward.

I recently bought a load of cider making equipment from a guy who was
getting out of the juice business.  He informed me the white food grade
grease from day equipment works well except "never use it on the
bearings for a hammer mill".  He burned up his bearings by putting it on
them.  I looked at the bearings on the hammer mill and there is no
contact with the apples so he must have just been playing it safe by
using it there?  Which press clothes to use is an excellent question.  I
have herd it depends on weather you are pressing desert/cooking apples
or cider apples.  I have also heard that Vigo Ltd sells some good but
expensive press clothes (www.vigoltd.com) I don't see them online but I
know they have them in their catalog.  I hope someone with actual
experience fills us all in on this one.

Hi to all,
I got a copy of Liz Copas' A Sommerset Pomona on Amazon.  Just go to the
bottom of the Amazon homepage and click on th
United Kingdom international site, then do a regular search for it.
Cost me about $30 plus under $10 for shipping,and I got it in about 2
weeks.


Thanks for this forum!

Subject: When to bottle for a medium sweet cider
From: "John Jeffs" <pdms@senet.com.au>
Date: Wed, 2 Aug 2000 08:23:06 +0930


Dear Digest,


I would like to bottle the cider so it is medium sweet but if I bottle it
before it has stopped fermenting it tends to be too fizzy if not explode.
So, how do I bottle the cider when it is around a S.G. of 1015 and still
fermenting but very slowly.


Cheers


John Jeffs

Cider Pressing Supplies


I have found that no-see-um fine nylon bug netting from camping supply stores
works well as press cloth. You should be able to get widths big enough to make
cheeses for  2 foot square.

The key thing is to avoid any turbulence.  You don't want to incorporate 
any air and you don't want to lose any CO2.  Smooth and non-splashy is 
what you need, irrespective of speed.  I don't think fully fermented 
cider can physically damage other than by gas exchange. An interesting 
point is that sometimes racking of a part-fermented cider will encourage 
renewed yeast growth, This is probably to do with new air being 
available for the yeast to breathe (contrary to popular opinion, yeast 
does require some air) and the literal movement of yeast cells away from 
their toxic excretory products (CO2 and ethanol).
