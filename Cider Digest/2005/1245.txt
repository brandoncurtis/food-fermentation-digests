            I do not have a web address for them right off but I am sure 
you could google them.


Both have press cloths in polypropylene or polyester. The polypro is 
much finer and of course will result in less pulp, etc. in the finished 
product, but will clog faster too. I used a canvas press cloth last year 
and it was a nightmare, just one big slippery mess after about 40 bu or 
so. The polypro sample I have looks remarkably like the canvas in weave, 
weight, etc. but I have never used either so I cannot speak to their 
effectiveness one way or the other.


I have purchased replacement poly planks & boards to swap out wood 
pieces on my press from Indelco Plastics in Mpls, MN at reasonable 
prices and they will ship and cut smaller pieces. They also have poly 
tanks in multiple sizes and configurations.

Chemically it makes virtually no difference. The sodium salt gives a
slightly higher yield of SO2 (nominal 65% vs 55%) but the difference is
trivial.  I can't speak for the BATF but here in the UK either salt is
permitted.  The potassium salt might be preferred if people are worried
about raising the sodium levels in cider (which are low anyway).  At the
moment in the UK KMS is cheaper than NaMS. So far as I know there is no
effective difference in solubility.

One of the key points of putting it in solution is so you can dispense
it easily by volume not mass!  It's much easier to dispense 19 ml than
19 grams. The density difference is trivial. Also, don't get carried
away with illusory accuracy. The theoretical yield of SO2 from 10%
metabisulphite solution may well be 6.74% by calculation, but in
practice the salts contain variable non-stoichiometric amounts of SO2,
and the stock solution will slowly lose SO2 over time too.  A good rule
of thumb is 50% yield  of SO2 from either salt. So a 10% metabisulphite
solution is 5% SO2.  It's that simple!  This is not precision
engineering you're doing!

At SG 1.015 you cannot reliably bottle it so it will not explode, unless
it has been keeved or otherwise appropriately pre-treated.  The
potential gas pressure (9 atmospheres) exceeds even that of a champagne
bottle (6 atm).  Some people may recommend sorbate, benzoate or sulphite
but the only safe way is to pasteurise. There are directions for that in
the Ag-Canada booklet <
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/ag-book.htm#19a>.
Be sure to wear strong gloves and a visor when doing this!!

I think more needs to be said regarding the measurement of SO2 using either
Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite. Solutions are useful when you do not have
a scale to measure grams. 


One part per million is one milligram per liter. If you are treating 5
gallons of juice at a time at 50 or 100 ppm the numbers can be pretty small
and using a measuring spoon to approximate quantities can be intimidating to
some and having to convert to metrics is just Un-American. But do it, it
makes the process a lot easier. 


Also consider that P.Metabisulfite is theoretically 57% SO2 and
S.Metabisulfite is theoretically 62% SO2. The chemists out there can weigh
in on these fractions. If you insist to sticking to English measurements, a
good rule of thumb is that 1/4 teaspoon of P.Metabisulfite per 5 gallons of
juice will provide roughly 40-45 ppm of SO2.


Having a scale I like to weigh out the chemicals of choice and use the
following formula for P.Metabisulfite.


Grams of P.Metabisulfite = Desired ppm/0.57* Liters to treat* 0.001


Yes, Federal wine laws require the use of P.Metabisulfite and I do not know
what distinction they make regarding not using S.Metabisulfite which I think
is used commonly in Europe. 


Keep in mind that the ppm levels are related to the PH of the juice so that
a winemaker may use only 50 ppm because they are working with a juice with a
PH of 3.4 as opposed to cider where the juice may be 3.6 or higher. Look at
Dr. Lea's material, it has some good guidelines.
