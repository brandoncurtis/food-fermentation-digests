I've made various enquiries this week and from the mouths of the
relevant horses I can report as follows:


- - RR Williams "Modern Cider Apple Production" (1975?). Out of print.


- - RR Williams "Cider and Juice Apples" (1988). Bulmers have no copies 
left now.


- - Liz Copas and Roger Umpleby "Growing Cider Apples" (2002) can be
obtained from Bulmers Fruit Office.  Contact
<chris.fairs@scottish-courage.co.uk> or phone (UK) 01432 294279.  Cost
�12.50 but may negotiate. Overseas orders by arrangement.


- - "Bulmers Pomona" is still available from the Hereford Cider Museum
(but not from Bulmers themselves!). Price �40. Contact
<info@cidermuseum.co.uk> or phone (UK) 01432 354207


- -  Liz Copas "Somerset Pomona"  - the original print run is now exhausted
but Liz has had it reprinted privately. Contact Liz herself for
availability details <http://www.lizcopas.com/>.  Liz assures me she has
not written any book on insect pests in the EU and presumes that
Deirdre's enquiry must refer to the Copas and Umpleby book (above).

I have been working on my press this summer to be ready for its inaugural 
use this season.  At present I have some older oak racks which were 
originally 28" square which I trimmed to 21".  They are a little wobbly, 
and I would eventually like to switch to plastics, but the price is rather 
exorbitant for new Day racks.  I've thought of making my own by purchasing 
a sheet of HDPE, cutting it into individual racks, and possibly using a 
router to make the channels.  Your mention of planks intrigues me.  Do you 
use multiple, narrow planks instead of a single rack per cheese?  That is, 
say four 20" X 4" planks laid side by side with an inch space between to 
create the channels?  I would think the cloths might creep between the racks?


One job this winter is to pull together a simple website to show it all off.


Thanks,

Andrew,


how are you calculating the pressure?

I wanted a little clarification from Andrew on the above.  From your 
website (which I consider "The Gospel According to St. Andrew") you 
describe your 97/98 FV2 batch as being bottled at  SG 1.016 in crown 
cap bottles and champagne bottles.  It apparently wasn't keeved, 
although you did rack it at SG 1.025 or so to slow it down.


That seems to contradict your statement above.  What am I missing?


Cheers!

While trying to avoid any commercialism here, I think it's important to
make known sources of information that a lot of us need.  I've had a note
that Vigo, Ltd. in the UK has several titles of interest (mentioned in
previous notes) in stock and is willing to ship to the US.  They claim
to have:
    A Somerset Pomona (Copas)
    Cider & Juice Apples (Williams ed)
    Growing Cider Apples (Umpelby & Copas)
The note also indicates that their web site and catalogue are out of date
and don't show all of what they have available.  Contact sales@vigoltd.com
for ordering.  I'm trying to get a little more info (like a complete list
of their available cider books) but don't have it as of time to send out
this digest.
