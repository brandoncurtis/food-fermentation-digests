I'm sure someone will chime in with the accepted wisdom. My experience
is purely empirical--my grinder is cast iron with a wood/stainless steel
cylinder. I've used it periodically for about 15 years with no
indication of any problems with the resulting juice/cider.

Again, purely empirical: I've used polyurethane. We contacted the
manufacturer and determined that, after curing, there were no compounds
that would be hazardous. No evidence in the juice of any off-odors or
flavors. An old standby used to be melted paraffin.


On a different press, we used fiberglass (auto body repair kit),
polished down and recoated with about 3 coats. That base was integral to
the press (large screw-type with the screw integrated into the base), so
it was impractical to replace it. But the base was cracked and pitted
and otherwise so unsanitizable that we opted to fiberglass it. Worked
fine and the press was still going at least 15 years later, when I last
saw it.

re Joe and Terry's posts about press racks - if proper techniques are 
employed, poly racks need be no more than 1/2" thick, and mine at 3/8 
work fine except with the latest pulpiest apples [or things like 
MacIntosh!], which require patience - breaking racks at the dados tells 
me you make layers too thick and apply pressure too fast [or your dados 
are too deep, should barely meet to create the openings] - rack and 
cloth pressing requires attention to apple and pulp qualities, and 
practised judgement of cheese handling based on that.


I think the rounded dadoes would be self defeating Joe, as the sharp 
corners of a normal dado are a good part of the "tooth" that helps hold 
the cloths against slippage - the cleaning problem is a fact of life in 
the biz due to the nature of the beast, and cleaning adds many tedious 
hours to any press operators day! The pulp texture [hammer mill chopped 
rather than grated or ground] and the cloth coarseness and weave are 
also important factors in how readily the juice expresses.


I've been trying for some time to write some technique details, but it 
hasn't been happening, so I'll give you folks a look at some of it at my 
operation via the page I have on my website:

Hi,
I'm a new subscriber with two questions.  First, do you know of any good 
construction plans for a small/medium cider press?  Second, is  there a 
searchable database of past issues that might be a more appropriate 
place to go with such questions?  I'd wager I'm not the first to ask 
this sort of question.
Regards,
Sidney VanNess
