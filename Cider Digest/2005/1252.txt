thanks for the replies. last year i started a late batch(december) in 3
different barrels and after pitching, only one barrel took off. the
other two did nothing for a couple weeks. i could not get my hands on
any more of the yeast i wanted, so i siphoned out of the good one and
did "transfusions" and it worked great. doug fincke

Many thanks to Andrew Lea for the information on Schizosaccharomyces pombe
and Schizosaccharomyces  malidevorans.
    For those interested in malolactic fermentations, Les Perkins, at
Wyeast, noted that they produce a yeast strain they call 3946 Zinfandel.
Here's what he says:   "We are still researching the method of malic
reduction that the yeast uses.  We don't have a lot of data on this
yet so I can't give you a lot of information.  The one thing I can say is
that the reduction occurs during primary."
    I haven't  tried this yeast strain and am curious if anyone out there
has? Perhaps it will prove useful with cider blends that are overly sharp.

Nothing to laugh at, Dave. Hartlands' Cider in Gloucestershire, where I
have a lot of my fruit pressed, uses an old hydraulic paper press which
really squeezes out the juice. The base is about 4 feet square and
Dereck Hartland normally builds between 10 and 12 cheeses in heavy-duty
terylene cloths, so we normally get three-quarters of a ton of fruit
pressed in two goes.

In CD #1250, Ian Merwin announced the cider making short courses at Cornell
the week of Dec. 5-9.  I?d like to also take this opportunity to let folks
know what we are planning up at Mt. Vernon, Washington.  The following week,
Dec.12-16, Peter Mitchell will be at the WSU Research and Extension Center
and will present the full Principles and Practice of Cidermaking course
which has been widely acclaimed both here and in the UK.  On Saturday the
17th, there will be a seminar on Cider Sensory Training and Analysis.  The
seminar will be followed in the evening by a Winter Wassail Cider
Celebration dinner which will include a five course meal with one or two
ciders paired with each course.  We will have group rates available at a
nearby motel.  The rates should be very reasonable since it is the off
season.  There will be a website up soon with all the particulars; I?ll post
the link when it?s ready.  Like Ian?s courses, space is limited so if you
think you might be interested, save those dates on your calendar.  If you
want to learn more about what is included in the cidermaking course you can
visit Peter?s website at HYPERLINK

There was a lot of additional detail that I'd have liked to include in the
recipe (most of it posted in earlier issues of the Cider Digest).  However
space was limited.


Also I've been a bit slow in putting out the word that I'll be offering
samples of PME (pectin methyl esterase) again this year to those who are
interested.  They'll include updated instructions that incorporate some of
the lessons learned during the past year (and I hope some of the trial users
who helped discover some of the limitations will consider giving it another
try).  As before, email me with your name, mailing address, and how much
cider you'll be making with PME (gawdey@att.net).  Also as before, sharing
your results, good or bad, will be greatly appreciated because it may alert
others to what works and what doesn't (you can send comments on your results
to me offline if you prefer to remain anonymous and I'll incorporate them
into a summary).


For those who may be wondering, the main difference in the directions for
using PME this year will be the recommendation that the PME be incorporated
into a maceration (even a short one) prior to pressing if at all possible.
Results with juice pressed from apples that have NOT been macerated after
milling have been at least mildly disappointing in most cases.  In contrast,
there have been fewer attempts to use PME in maceration (only two from this
year's set of trials, to be exact) but both produced exceptionally nice
brown caps.  It would be nice to see the next set of trials include fruit
that is macerated with and without PME prior to pressing to see when PME may
and may not be of use.


Another difference this year will be the recommendation that pectin load be
considered when dosing with calcium chloride as a precipitating agent.  The
calcium chloride dosage recommended earlier seems to be optimum with a heavy
pectin load but may leave a salty taste if pectin load is light.  Maceration
prior to pressing appears to be the most reliable way to produce a
sufficiently great pectin load.

PME Trial #3, Batch #10 is the latest iteration, ready to go down the drain
with numbers 1 through 9 (all part of a series of mildly painful but useful
"learning experiences").   I had two ciders with nicer names ("Emma's
Bottlebrush" and "Sweet Linnie's Mischief") entered into the 2nd Annual SODZ
British Beerfest Competition in the spring.   Anyone who has seen my
daughters, Emma and  Linnaea, (now aged six and four respectively) "helping"
me in the cellar would find no need for explanation of these names.


Also, there's no imminent danger of going into anything that remotely
resembles large-scale production.  At the moment my barn is surrounded by
tanks, conveyors (belt, chain and paddle types), a beast of a hammermill,
stainless hopper, etc.  For now it looks more like I'm setting up a
stainless steel recycling center than a cidery.  As a slightly overwhelmed
one-man-show and part-timer struggling to finish up summer bud grafting ,
it's safe to say that my amateur standing in competitions is secure for at
least another year.
