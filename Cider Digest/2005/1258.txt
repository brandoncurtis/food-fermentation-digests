Subject: Re-identifying 'Fauxwhelp'
From: "McGonegal, Charles" <Charles.McGonegal@uop.com>

I believe it's widely acknowledged that the 'Foxwhelp' available in
several places in the Midwest US has been mis-labelled. But do we have
any idea what it might actually be?


The specimen I have, sourced from You-Probably-Know-Who Nursery, matches
samples that I've had from another regional grower.  Now that I'm
starting to get samples from my young cider orchard, I'm struck by how
much this 'Fauxwhelp' looks like my 'Sweet Alford'.  (Of course, it just
figures that Sweet Alford is known to have been confused with 'La Bret'
at key scion sources :-)  The main difference is that my 'Fauxwhelp'
makes fruit even paler than 'Sweet Alford/La Bret' - so pale that the
green ground color looks nearly grey/white.  Is anyone else growing
'White Jersey' and 'Sweet Alford', to comment on the two?  My (known)
White Jersey haven't produced yet, but you can see where I'm headed with
this line of thought.  I'll have to go look at the leaves and bark.


I guess  another question would be, 'Do Jersey-type apples have a
characteristic shape?'  I don't have a big enough sample from my Jersey
collection to be sure. =20

In CD#1257 John C. Campbell III wrote in Response to Tim Bray:
>
> O.K. Tim; "Muscat deBernay" Wot's this? [snip, snip]...I've never heard of
that strain of apples ....


Tim will no doubt have to face up to careless spelling (as I'll have to face
up to careless stoichiometry in my last posting) but who's to say he's
wrong?  The National Apple Register of the United Kingdom (ISBN 1 897604 28
9) lists both Muscadet and Muscat (as well as several other alternate
spellings) as synonyms for Margil.  I doubt it's really the same apple--more
likely a typical case of regional variation in use of synonyms, but it
illustrates how convoluted the names can get.


 Muscadet de Bernay is listed in the Malus collection at the Agricultural
Research Station at Geneva:  "Fruit: size small, 50-55 mm; skin 40-60% red,
splashed stripe; shape round-oblate; flesh firm, greenish cream colored ;
flavor astringent; eating quality inedible; harvest season late, 3 weeks
after Delicious. "Tree: productive; very biennial; fruits drop before
ripening. French cider apple."    See
http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/search.pl?PI+200780 for more
information from the ARS website.


It is also listed in Bor� and Fleckinger's POMMIERS � CIDRE (ISBN 2 7380
0718 X) as a cider apple found in Eure and Orne, in the north of France.   I
grafted a few sticks onto G30 about 19 months ago using scionwood shared by
Murdo Laird.  As evidence of precocity and vigor there is an apple on a
5-foot tree in my nursery area right now.

The  books mentioned in my other posting remind me of one I've been slowly
digesting recently.  "Apples:  Botany, Production and Uses," edited by D.C.
Ferree and I.J. Warrington (Published in 2003 by CABI Publishing, ISBN 0
85199 592 6) is extremely informative.  I first saw it when visiting the
library at the Geneva Station and knew immediately that it was a must-have
book for anyone who is seriously considering starting an apple orchard ( I
wish I'd had it or something similar in hand four years ago).     It appears
to be geared toward supporting an undergraduate university course about
apples,  is very readable, and gets my highest recommedation.   It covers
(among other things):  apple rootsocks,  propagation and nursery tree
quality, apple physiology and environmental influences, orchard and tree
management, crop protection,  harvesting, handling, and utilization.  This
description really doesn't do it justice.   It also has the most useful,
concise description of pruning and training physiology I've seen.


Individual sections are written by forty respected contributors from around
the world.  Each is nicely organized  and stands alone so you can put it
down and pick it up easily as time permits.  It's pricy (typical of many
university textbooks) but well worth the investment.  It covers many of the
details left out in  Michael Philllips' "The Apple Grower" (also highly
recommended, ISBN 1 890132 04 7).  Coincidentally, Ian Merwin, a faculty
member at Cornell University and  someone who many of us will recognize as a
contributor to the Cider Digest, wrote the section on Orchard-floor
Management Systems.
