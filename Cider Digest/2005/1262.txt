ARGH!
This sounds like what I've got here that's labeled "Tremlett's Bitter"!!!
I know what I've got isn't Tremlett's...that's a known mismatch between
US and UK.  I'm just arghing that I could arguably match my Tremlett's
to Derek's description of Foxwhelp, especially since what I've got is a
bittersharp, as well as matching Derek's other points: early harvest [I
picked mine today], brilliant red, small.  (But yes, I know what I've
got isn't -really- a Foxwhelp.)

I don't think so.  That is, I don't think what we've got as "Foxwhelp" here
is Bulmer's Norman, but it could have been a wrong propagation from some
other intermediate graft.  I say that because I've got (or, ARGH again,
I *think* I've got, but pretty sure) a Bulmer's Norman here, and it's
nothing like the "Fauxwhelp" I've got.  Bulmer's Norman is a bittersweet
and notably low acid.


I've seen Bulmer's Norman categorized as a "stem builder" (e.g., in Copas).
I don't know enough to understand that term, especially with cross-Atlantic
variation in terminology, but I had thought it was closer to meaning use
as a body of a tree that was top-worked than to an interstem segment on
the trunk.  I can't see anyone letting branches grow from the interstem
section, let alone taking scionwood from it.

Subject: Keeving and terroir in Quebec
From: john brett <jbrett@eastlink.ca>

Claude Jolicouer's comments about the superior quality of northern
Cortland Apples got me thinking about some of the very fine ciders I've
tasted from Quebec. In particular, the methode champagnoise semi- sweet
kinds which have a similar character to the one good Norman Cider I've
tried. A question for Claude or anyone else out there who might know:
Are some of the craft cideries in Quebec using Keeving to produce their
ciders? And if so, who are they? There's an elegance and finish to these
ciders to suggest they are doing something right.
   On a related note, Claude's comments also resonated for me because I've
tried a number of very good Quebec ciders and have been surprised at the
apples they are using - Macouns, Lobos, MacIntosh, Spartans, etc - standard
desert varieties that I would not have thought of as very promising. Perhaps
it is the terroir that is helping out as well as the considerable experience
and technique of the cidermakers. I can certainly say that here in Nova
Scotia, with our acidic soils, a MacIntosh or a Cortland fresh off the
tree has a lot more 'snap' to it than the same apple I have tried in the
Ottawa area and upstate New York where many orchards lay over or are in
close proximity to limestone. This higher acidity does have an effect on
our blending and choice of fruit.

As a followup to my earlier note on a mystery 'cider' pear recently
brought to my attention, I'm posting some bark pictures to go with the
fruit pictures.


I've tentatively identified this perry pear as 'Jenkins Red'.  Luckwell
and Pollard notes that Jenkins Red has distinctive bark with short
segments.  I admit that I have no idea what this means in the real
world.  I don't have enough experience with full size pear trees.


<\aside>
Perry leaves, on the other hand, are really distinctive and interesting.
When I was trying to ID this old pear, I ran out to my nascent perry
orchard to do a comparison with Yellow Huffcap.  I really looked at the
leaves critically for the first time.  The range in shape is amazing.  I
wouldn't call it the same species, if they were wild trees out in the
woods.  Slender spearpoint shapes to squat, updise nowd things.

Now, the real tricky question:  Do I make a barrel of blended
common/tradtional 'country' perry?
Or do I make a complement to my crab-apple cyser and use these tannic
pears for a 'pyser'?


So many ideas - so few pears :-)

Subject: Flash Pasturization
From: DirkBlaze@aol.com

Has anyone tried flash pasteurization?  This involves quickly heating a flow
of product to about 70 degrees C to kill organisms then cooling quickly and
then bottling.  Product is heated by passing through a plate heat-exchanger in a
hot water bath and cooled in a similar manner.


Carbonated product is bottled using counter pressure fillers.  This method
gives total control over carbonation and residual sweetness but bottling is
more complicated.  It's the way most craft - brewed beer is pasteurized.

I just read that Ohio now permits wine to be shipped directly to its
residents from out of state (following recent Supreme Court decisions).  I
assume this means that cider shipments are permitted also (right?).  Does
anyone have a list or links for cideries which will direct ship?  I have had
a hard time finding this information on the web through direct searches - I
mostly get hits for Woodchuck and various Bulmer's brands.  Is there a
website with a decent current listing of U.S.-based cideries?


Thanks,

Subject: Last Call for Requests for PME Samples
From: "Gary Awdey" <gawdey@att.net>
Date: Sat, 24 Sep 2005 13:31:57 -0400


Another reminder for anyone giving thought to doing a PME-assisted keeve
this year:  Send your request for a free sample to me at gawdey@att.net,
along with the amount of cider you'd plan to keeve with it and your shipping
address.


Refer back to CD#1255 in the archives
(http://www.talisman.com/cider/cury/index.html) or email me off-Digest if
you need more information.  Also, for those who will be doing side-by-side
comparisons of small batches with and without PME (to find out if it really
makes much difference with the apples and process you use)  I'll be happy to
include extra CaCl2 for the control batch (for combined batch volume up to
about 20 gallons).  Just let me know.


It took longer than expected but for all requests already received samples
are entirely ready to ship and will be mailed on Monday, Sept. 26 (so they
won't sit around in a warm post office or warehouse all day Sunday).  For
those who are receiving a sample it'd be a good idea to put it in the
refrigerator as soon as you can, though the enzyme isn't completely
inactivated unless it is heated to about 140 degrees farenheit (60 degrees
C).


So far this year's sample requestors are located in:


THE US
  Alaska
  California
  Colorado
  Idaho
  Indiana
  Michigan
  Missouri
  New York
  Oregon
  Texas
  Vermont
  Washington
CANADA
  British Columbia
  Nova Scotia
  Quebec
ENGLAND


TASMANIA


Last year there were several October/November additions to the list and that
seems likely to occur again this year.  Of the requests made to date, the
smallest batch size is 5 gallons and the largest is 500 gal.

In case it helps anybody, here is a link to a picture of genuine UK
Broxwood Foxwhelp.   As Derek said, it is smallish and very early.  It
is also very acid (up to 2%).   The fruit is very aromatic and rich
(think Spartan / Macintosh / Red Delicious but with a much much deeper
and complex earthy note).  I am just harvesting mine here in Southern
England now (24th September).

If you use the same test kit for apples be aware that in grapes only
about 10% of the acid is malic so only that 10% can go to lactic. The
remaining 90% remains unchanged as tartaric.  In apples 90% of the acid
is malic so the conversion to lactic is much more startling and your
total acidity will drop by one-half.  You need to interpret the
chromatography rather differently in cider than in wine.

I have used BioStart Oenos which is probably fairly similar and it works
well even down to pH 3.1.  It does need a minimum temperature of  17C
and even then takes several months (at UK summer temperature) to work to
completion.  Received wisdom is that it should not be added till all the
yeast fermentation is quite finished since the yeast may be antagonistic
to the bacteria. It is also popularly believed that some yeast autolysis
is required to 'feed' the MLF bacteria.

It all depends.  The downside as I mentioned is that your total acid
will drop by one half.  If your acid is already 0.7% or greater, that's
probably OK, maybe even desirable, but if it starts off at < 0.5% then
you'll end up at < 0.25% which is really rather insipid and you may not
like the result.  The other thing is that it totally destroys any
'fruity character'.  You end up with much more rounded notes (you can
imagine 'buttery' if you like!)., and you may or may not like the
result.  My experience is that added cultures do a much more complete
job than the natural MLF (as you might expect!) but they do not seem to
give the spicy notes which traditional MLF is supposed to confer to
bittersweet ciders.  I suggest you try an inoculated sample vs a control
and see which you like the best!
