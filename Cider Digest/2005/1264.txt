All Campden tablets *should* be created equal - that's the whole point
of them!  The idea was that any chemist could make them up locally and
they'd always yield the same amount of sulphite.

At 450 ppm there's not a lot you can do.  Best plan would be to dilute
out with another two or three  gallons of juice and maybe re-inoculate.


Failing that, aerate it heavily (splashing from jar to jar),
re-inoculate, and put it on one side for a couple of weeks or so. Maybe
you'll be lucky!

For anyone who might be interested, the 2005 Great Lakes Olde World Syder
Competition will be taking place in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Dec. 4.
Entries will be accepted from Nov. 21 through Dec. 2.    This sounds like an
interesting competition.  It is open to all ciders and perries, plus styles
of beer and mead that include apple or pear as ingredients.  There will be
separate divisions for commercial and non-commercial entries.   Details may
be found at http://www.michiganbeerguide.com/beerguide.asp or more directly
at http://www.michiganbeerguide.com/pdf/GLSyderForms.pdf.


I plan to attend the competition.  If there is anyone who plans to visit
Ciderday next month (Ciderday details at www.ciderday.org) and also has
interest in submitting entries for the Great Lakes Syder Competition about a
month later,  please let me know and I'll look into the feasiblity of
pre-registering and shuttling your cider from Ciderday to Grand Rapids to
save you the cost of shipping.

I recently built a home-made press following instructions I found on the
digest several years ago, and I decided to try it out on a bushel of
bartlett pears I bought at the local farmers market. I decided to try for a
natural fermentation with wild yeasts, so I just stuck an airlock on the
carboy of pressed juice and let it go. Everything seemed fine until about 10
days later, when I decided to do a gravity reading. It was 1.022, so I
decided to rack it, hoping to eventually keep some residual sweetness in my
cider. Anyway, when I tasted the cider, it tasted kinda vinegary. I went
ahead and racked it anyway, and now, 2 days later, the carboy looks a little
weird. In the middle of the carboy is a cylinder of darker brown juice
(about 1/3 the volume of the carboy), surrounded by a hollow tube of a light
brown juice around the edge of the carboy. I thought that might be a trick
of the light or something, but that seems very unlikely. Also, floating on
top of the juice (but only in the middle of the carboy) is a white layer
which is full of many holes of all sizes. I thought maybe I should drop in a
few campden tablets, followed by some cider yeast after a couple of days,
but then I thought I'd better ask the digest for advice first. Any
suggestions?

Claude Jolicoeur wrote that keeving is most effective with low acidity juices
from traditional bittersweet varieties. Has anyone out there experimented
with keeving more acidic juices? I'd be interested in knowing the results -
good, bad or indifferent.
