Are there any celebrations of note for Apple Day in the US?  I haven't seen
anything on it.
>>>>>>>>>>>
Hi Dick,


Is that a particular date? Here in MA we do have the two day "Cider
Day" event -- www.ciderday.org, on Nov 5 & 6.

By sheer coincidence, my local chapter of Slow Food USA is holding a 
big Harvest Apple Fest on Sunday, Oct. 23 from 4:30 to 7 p.m. at 
Harlow's Cafe in Peterborough, NH. I still need to round up some of the 
apples, but we will have 8 to 10 uncommon apple varieties from some of 
the region's best orchards. I'm even hoping to get some Nodhead 
(Jewett's Fine Red) and Granite Beauty from Gould Hill Orchards in 
Contoocook -- both are quite rare 19th century New Hampshire apples. 
Granite (Granite Beauty) comes from Weare, the town next to mine, and I 
have never seen anyone else growing or selling it -- Rich Stadnik of 
Pup's Cider Co. grafted a couple of scions this past spring onto G11 
rootstock, and we planted them in a nursery bed at Alyson's Orchard in 
Walpole, NH, in an attempt to spread this nice 1866 apple.


Anyway, for any CD subscribers who are within striking distance of 
southwest NH, you are cordially invited to attend our own Apple Day. 
There will be good food from area restaurants, apple desserts, Vermont 
and NH cheeses, sweet ciders, and hard ciders from our fine N.H. 
cideries: Farnum Hill and Pup's. We're even holding a silent auction, 
with the top item a Calvados dinner for two and a flight of tastings of 
vintage Calvados (maybe hosted by Christian Drouin, the Normandy 
distiller), plus one night's stay at the EF Lane Hotel in Keene, NH. We 
have Calvados from 1963, 1969, etc. -- can't hardly wait until Jan. or 
Feb. when this will take place,


If anyone is interested in attending, contact me off-list and I can 
send more information. Space is limited to 100 people, so you'll 
probably want to have me set aside a ticket. Price is $18 ($20 at the 
door).

Subject: What apple is this?  Winesap?

These apples come from an old apple tree in my yard in rural southeast MI.
The tree is probably 50-60 years old on a standard rootstock.  The tree
is bearing some fruit now, but the tree also has a substantial amount of
fruit that is still turning and just now showing color.  Most of the fruit
still in the tree seems to be a bit larger then most of the groundfalls
I am currently getting.


Sorry for the size of the pics...

Is this Winesap? Any other possibilities?

The problem is not residual SO2 itself. It's more likely to be that the 
yeast has taken a tiny fraction of that (parts per billion only) and 
converted it into some very odoriferous sulphur compounds (organic 
sulphides and thiols).


One thing you can do is to add a tiny amount of copper to bind these 
compounds.  Cupric sulfate up to 0.5 parts per million is a typical 
dodge here.  That is a *very* small amount so do your calculations 
carefully!  And do it on a test sample first.


The alternative is to wait a while. Often the sulphur stinks will 
disappear with time quite naturally as the cider matures and the 
biochemistry settles down into equilibrium again.  Come back to it after 
a month or two tightly closed storage.

There are two fundamental problems in keeving high acid juices.  One is
that the pH may be too low for the pectin esterase enzyme to work
efficiently.  The other is that the pectate anion is more heavily
protonated (hence more positively charged) at low pH and  hence will not
bind so well to the existing cations (positively charged) notably
calcium which form the gel.


That is not to say keeving cannot be done at high acidity (low pH) but
it is a great deal more difficult and traditionally was always
considered something of a non-starter I think.  On the other hand lime
juice was traditionally clarified in the Caribbean by a spontaneous
process very similar to keeving and you can't get much more acidic than
that!
