Cider Oregon and members of the Northwest Cider Society are celebrating the 
apple with a luncheon in Portland at The Heathman Hotel with Chef Philippe 
Boulot on Sunday, October 23rd.   We did not realize it was Apple Day 
weekend!  That makes it even more fun. The luncheon will be followed by a 
public tasting which will feature Oregon and Washington producers as well 
as friends who import Aspall and Manoir du Parc.   Contact me off list for 
more details.

re:Winesap?


Perhaps. What does it taste like? Just based on the photos, it could be a
Stayman.  Maybe a Ribston Pippin, given the skin and shape, though I don't
know if they're that common in Michigan?

Subject: long(er)-term storage in SS kegs?
From: rcd@talisman.com (Dick Dunn)

Does anybody have actual experience keeping cider in stainless "corny" kegs
for longer periods than just enough to dispense the cider?  Let's say a few
months up to a year.  Specifically, is there any tendency toward pitting in
the keg or any other difficulty because of the acidity of the cider?


I have a couple of ciders I've kept in glass as they age, but they are
ready to start drinking.  I'd like to free up the glass for this fall's
cider, and I'd just as soon have the older ciders ready to serve, if it's
OK to keep them in SS that long.


(Yes, I know "keg cider" is a dirty phrase, moreso in the UK than here, but
in this case all I'm doing is using the keg for dispense--I can get the
carbonation where I want it, and it saves bottling work.)
