The next Cider Digest won't come out until a bit after Franklin County Cider
Day (some time after this weekend).  Thank you for your patience.  If you're
not patient, too bad.

I would like to take a moment and thank everyone who replied to this 
inquiry!  It's times like this that make Dick's bored er ... board all 
worthwhile in very practical ways.  Would that I had known about it 8 
years ago when I started collecting my orchard.  In just a very short 
time what I learned is that these particular trees are hard to get to 
fruit, what their susceptibilities are (I can add "Fire Blight" to that 
list), and temperature restrictions (we have horribly humid hot summers 
here along the Chesapeake bay).  Had this information been in the 
catalog descriptions (particularly the temperature issue) I would have 
simply planted more Kingstons and true Foxwhelps (yes you can get true 
foxwhelps from Apples of Antiquity).

This is a question I would like to submit for the discussion of readers:
Help a Rookie! -
I recently began my first cider project. I sanitized (effectively, I
believed) a gallon glass jug, and poured into it a gallon of unpasteurized
local [juice] cider. I stretched a balloon over the mouth of the jug and put
it in a kitchen cabinet. And yes, I am aware that balloons are poor
substitutes for real airlocks. It was what I had at the time, so I used it.
Here's the frightening development. Since then (about one week has elapsed)
the balloon, rather than filling with gas, began to bulge down and withdraw
INTO the jug. It appears that rather than off-gassing, the cider is
consuming the available air. The balloon is being drawn down into the
resultant vacuum. What gives? I've read everything I can find online, and
nothing about "vacuum cider" as a friend dubbed it. Any indication of
fermentation (gasses, bubbling) have yet to be seen, excepting a very thin
cloudy layer on the surface of the cider.
My own notions: could fermentation be delayed by the fact that I have not
yet turned on my heat for the winter, and the cider has therefore been kept
pretty cold? (This still cannot explain the vacuum.) Could the
air-consumption be a contamination issue? Does it have anything to do with
my using unpasteurized cider, and not adding any sugar or yeast? If I do
this again, should I use sugar (or raisins, as I'd prefer)? If it's still
edible, can or should I add raisins now, or is it too late? Any advice,
explanations or hypotheses would be greatly appreciated.
And a PS question: Let me jump the gun and assume that I've got some kind of
insane microbial contamination on my hands. Can I heat or boil the cider for
a while to kill off the bad stuff, toss in a campden tablet, and add my own
yeast, and thereby avoid throwing away my materials? I've read accounts of
people skimming off mold and getting fermentation started, yielding safe,
edible results. Thanks for your help, everybody.
