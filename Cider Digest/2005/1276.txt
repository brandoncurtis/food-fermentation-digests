Subject: What's going on with my cider

I'm a beginner at making cider, about five years now, I make it for my
own consumption. Up until this year I pretty much understood the basics
and made what I thought was a decent drinkable cider but nothing else to
compare it with in my area (North Central Washington). The last couple of
batches were crystal clear until I remove the air locks and transferred
it to smaller containers, in a short time after transfer the clear cider
became slightly hazy and a fine film of white powder like material came
to the surface. The taste was not noticeably adversely affected but I  am
curious. The juice is mostly Braeburn with some Newtowns, White Winter
Pearmains and Jonathans thrown in. Do any of you experienced cider makers
have an idea of what's going on with my cider?

Hello Charles and Others!


Try doing a somewhat regular press release of your products and/or 
winery. PR's work great to announce the release of a new product or the 
release of this years ciders. Especially if you have limited supplies, 
create the buzz yourself and let the ambitious reporters follow-up with 
an article. This can also work great for the "last of the batch, get it 
now before it's gone" kind of announcement. Try writing and submitting 
an article to the paper too, after all you are the expert! Most papers 
are looking for stuff to put in or an idea for a later special section. 
Good luck!

I am making an ice perry this year. I started off with bartlett pears that
were 1.056sg, 0.42TA and pH of 3.9. I juice them and then
freeze-concentrate the juice. I used two 2 gallon buckets with lids and
put 1 1/2 gal of juice in each. I then repeat the following procedure:
1. Place buckets into the freezer.
2. Remove when they appear to be frozen solid, then allow them to thaw.
3. Carefully, without stiring them up, place back into freezer.
With each cycle, the water and sugar layers begin to stratify. Three or
four times is all it takes to separate most of the water from the sugar
solids in the bottom. You can even pull off some of the floating ice in
the later stages of the thaw cycle. Syphon off the remaining water and
you're ready to go. With the above juice I ended with: 1.098sg, 0.71TA and
ph of 3.7. I have also done this with apple juice, but don't have the
numbers handy.

Subject: Cider Day - Reflections from Overseas

Last weekend, encouraged by Dick Dunn and others, I was privileged 
enough to be a participant at the Franklin County Cider Day in Western 
Massachusetts (www.ciderday.org).  Although I was there as a part of the 
show (helping with Gary Awdey on the "Keeving" presentation and 
contributing to the "Art and Commerce of Cidermaking" panel discussion), 
it was tremendous fun for me to meet a whole host of people who were 
only names and e-mail addresses before.  Some I'd met in person before 
but most I hadn't. Although the internet has opened up whole new 
exchange possibilities for amateur and small-scale professional 
cidermakers worldwide, sooner or later people have to get together, chat 
face to face and actually taste and compare some ciders.  The Franklin 
County Cider Day gives them the chance to do just that.  We had around 
60 people in our admittedly esoteric panel on keeving, and there were 
probably double that number of interested amateurs when it came to the 
"Cidermaking Workshop" session.  Plus there were heritage apple 
tastings, demonstrations of cider and jelly making, orchard tours and 
all the usual things we've come to associate with 'Apple Day' in the UK 
- - though the Cider Day Dinner (the first ever, I believe, but a great 
success) was something I've never met before!  And the Cider and Cheese 
Pairing session, run by Ben Watson and linked to the Slow Food theme, 
was quite an eye opener for someone who thought that Scrumpy went with 
Cheddar and that was the end of the matter (it ain't - not by a long shot!)


What made it stand out for me, as a visiting Brit in New England, was 
the level of enthusiasm for cidermaking and the sharing of information 
on the craft at all levels. Many of us on this side of the pond forget 
that cider exists in pretty much all temperate climates, and the North 
American cider tradition is almost as old as ours, dating from early 
colonial times.  The products are very different of course.  There's no 
bittersweet fruit apart from the French and English imported varieties, 
which are certainly being used to good effect, but in some ways it's the 
ciders made from local varieties which are the most interesting. 
Baldwin, Roxbury Russet, Cortland and many others show enormous 
potential for truly distinctive North American blends, not to mention 
the older New England style of cider (or cyser?) fortifed with raisins, 
honey and other fermentables and spices to give high alcohol and to keep 
out the bitter winter cold (although last weekend was as unseasonably 
warm there as it has been here).  All the ciders are bottled, of course, 
unlike those at our predominantly draught UK cider festivals, but it 
struck me as curious that we have nothing quite like Cider Day in the 
UK, to celebrate and compare directly the diversity and the manufacture 
of small-scale ciders that are possible (and in small size tasting 
glasses so the party remains convivial but sober!).


For those of you already in the US and Canada, please continue to 
support Cider Day, which for 2006 will be the 12th since its creation by 
Terry and Judith Maloney of West County Cider and their band of 
volunteer helpers.   For those of you in the UK, give a visit some 
thought!  Flights to Boston are as cheap as they get in early November 
(mine was less than �250 on a scheduled BA return), and the 100 mile 
drive west is to some of the prettiest landscapes and villages in New 
England. Plus a band of real enthusiasts at the end of it!

I am working on an article about ice cider and have been making a small 
(1 gal.) batch since early this year, courtesy of some pressed juice 
that Rich Stadnik of Pup's Cider Co. pressed from frozen Baldwins.


I haven't bottled or tasted the finished product, though Rich says he 
is somewhat disappointed with the way his turned out. He and I picked 
apples in the twilight before a hard frost at a local orchard 
yesterday, cleaning their trees of some remarkably sweet and 
long-hanging Red Delicious fruit (we probably should see if we can get 
some fruit this winter that freezes on the tree). I'm thinking that 
Rich might try a control batch using 100% high S.G. Red Delicious and 
another batch with a mix, or with using one variety that still has a 
lot of acidity.


I don't know yet what varieties Domaine Pinnacle in Quebec is using, 
but they tend to achieve one of the best "viscous" or "oily" mouthfeels 
in their ice cider. Also, since I'm not crazy about sweet alcohols (or 
apples), I tend to like the vein of malic acid taste in their product, 
which keeps the very sweet ice cider from tasting cloyingly sweet to my 
palate. I suspect they must use some apples with good acidity. Maybe 
we'll try making some ice cider some year with my friend Roger's 
seedling variety, Castle Rock, which has tons of acidity.


At any rate, I started my test batch of ice cider on 3/9/05 from 100% 
pressed Baldwin juice. This measured around 1.080, which is I think 
where you should be (translates to about 20 deg. Brix. Potenial alcohol 
is probably meaningless, since the yeast won't ferment all the sugars. 
But, just for fun, it would be 11% potential abv.


I boiled and cooled 1 cup of the concentrated Baldwin juice and pitched 
it with 5 grams dehydrated Lalvin D47 yeast, and added 1 tsp. yeast 
nutrient to the must when I pitched the starter culture into the carboy.


On 4/11/05 I racked the ice cider into a new jug and topped it up with 
some thawed concentrated Baldwin juice that I had frozen. The specific 
gravity measured 1.002 -- lower than I would have expected.


I'll try and bottle this up and taste it, and report back.

I recently made a pdf file of Hogg and Bull, "The Apple and Pear as  
Vintage Fruits" (1886).  Here is the link:


http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/cider/HoggBull.pdf


Somehow I left out pages 44-45, and a few pages are not the best  
copy.  Also it is a scan so the file is large, 15MB.  This book is  
one of the classic English cider texts, certainly worth a read.  It  
also contains many pages of variety descriptions of cider apples and  
perry pears.  Enjoy!
