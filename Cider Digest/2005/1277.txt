That's almost certainly a film yeast. It will be caused by too much air 
when you did the transfers, and maybe the film yeast inoculum was 
already in the containers or your racking tube.  A little will not be 
too damaging, though a lot is not good for the flavour.  If you keep the 
ciders tightly closed it should not grow anymore. You can add some 
sulphur dioxide too if you want to be sure it won't develop further.

If I understand well, you milled and pressed the apples while hard frozen.
I think this is the problem. Apples should be pressed partially frozen in
order to yield a concentrated juice. 


So, I would suggest, the next time you try, to remove the apples from the
freezer some hours before pressing (the exact number of hours depends on
the quantity of apples and the heat exchange with the room - some
experimentation is required). Then, when the apples are becoming quite soft
on the outside, but while there are still ice cristals inside, the time to
press has come. At that point, the ice cristals contain mainly water, so
the juice that will be extracted will be concentrated.


I find that it is not necessary to grind the apples once they have been
frozen, although some prefer to grind them. You can try pitching the
partially thawn apples directly in the press, and you can experiment on
this point also.


Also, as David Shenk reported in CD 1276, you can also concentrate juice by
freezing. Some cidreries in Quebec do ice cider this way, but this is no
more accepted as a new rule has recently been adopted that will only allow
the method of pressing partially frozen apples. I hope to be able to report
soon to the Digest the exact new rule for this (as soon as I get the
information).

when we were up in Quebec last summer the folks making ice cider told us 
they used 2 different techniques. Letting the apples freeze on the trees 
was one of them, but seemed less common. The other, more common one was 
freeze concentrating the juice after pressing, but before fermentation.


The latter technique sounds way more practical to me, and the approach I'm 
considering using.
Best of luck,

A roughly valid way to look at that might be that as the liquid gets
to have less and less ethanol in it, its vapor pressure of ethanol
goes down correspondingly, so you never quite get rid of the last bit
of ethanol until all the water goes too.

Yeah, it's more like that.  An azeotrope is just a particular mixture.
It has the property that its vapor is the same mixture as the liquid
was (as opposed to, say, wine, whose vapor has more alcohol than the
wine did), so distilling it doesn't get you anywhere.

Subject: Sparkling cider and tirage

I am curious about the differences in methode champagnoise when it 
comes to cider versus sparkling wine.


When the winemaker bottles, he adds a tirage that includes not only 
fermentable sugar but also a re-inoculation of yeast.  I've been 
operating under the (apparently correct) assumption that there is 
enough viable yeast left in my fermented-to-dryness cider that only 
priming sugar is necessary to give a good sparkle.  (I opened a 
one-month old "test" bottle today and was happy to find there was 
considerable carbonation.  [Eat your heart out, Lawrence Welk!])


So why does the winemaker have to re-inoculate with yeast and the 
cidermaker doesn't?  Is it because the wine is aged so much longer 
before being mis en boutille  that the yeast has really completely 
died?  Or is there some other process at work?


Also, after six month plus when I get around to the degorgement and 
topping off, if I add a little sugar to the dossage, do I run the risk 
of the fermentation starting up again?  (Apparently the wine guys often 
add a fair amount of fermentable sugar at this point if they making 
something like a demi-sec, etc.  and I don't hear them worrying about 
anything restarting?)


Or is clear, non-filtered, non-pasturized, non-stablized (and 
non-keeved) sparkling cider destined to be bone dry?  Not that I'm 
complaining, just curious.


Thanks,

FYI,


sorry if this has been seen here before:


A week of hard cider making workshops will be presented at the New York State
Agricultural Experiment Station, December 5-9, 2005. There are 2 workshops -
Foundation, Dec. 5-7, and Building Expertise Dec. 8 & 9, 2005   Limited to 20
participants in each course - there are 4 seats left in each.


The instructor will be Peter Mitchell from Mitchell Food & Drink, Ltd. United
Kingdom. He is a highly qualified and internationally recognized expert in
cider & perry making, with over 20 years of experience and an award winning
producer in his own right.
