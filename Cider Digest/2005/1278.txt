In CD 1277, Don Davenport inquires about methode champenoise details.


Don, I think the main reason to re-innoculate pre-tirage is for
consistency.  It makes sure that you've got good healthy yeast raring to
go in the bottle.  I set my sparking cider (and perry) to tirage at 4
months old, and while it's visually clear, I know it still has quite a
yeast load.  I like my 'cidre cuvee' to be between 7 and 8% ABV (purely
for my own comfort for living within the regs).  I'm sure that the yeast
load is pretty viable.  A grape sparkling wine might be 10-12% ABV, but
at 4-6 months old, I bet there are plenty of viable yeast.


But when producing commcerially, it doesn't take many failed bottles to
encourage you to make sure you've got healthy yeast.


As for post disgorgement dosage, you should be safe if you get a good
clean disgorging.  I run my sparkling perry from dry up to 3% RS using a
50 Brix solution.  The only difficulty I have found is using concentrate
as a sugar source.  I'm coming to believe you run a serious risk of
adding extrordinarily durable yeast species that were living in the
concentrate. (And they do, even at 70 Brix).  Normal yeast shouldn't be
able to reproduce when the bottle pressure exceeds 2 bar (30 psig).  I
aim for 5-6 bar.  If the disgorging is clean, there aren't enough cells
left to make a difference.  My products stay stable for years.

Subject: More on ice cider

I am debating whether to try an ice cider this year and have been  
following the recent posts on that topic with interest.  My goal is  
to make an ice cider of very high initial brix following the Canadian  
ice ciders, namely 30+brix initially.  I have a couple questions.


I personally don't care about how "authentic" my product is, but is  
there any reason why pressing partly frozen apples may lead to better  
juice than by freeze-concentrating normal cider?  It does seem like  
there may be some difference in the compounds left behind in the  
apples.  I will probably freeze concentrate normal juice just for  
simplicity this time around.


Related to this, does the keeving procedure make any sense for an ice  
cider?  I could try to keeve either before or after freeze- 
concentrating, but it may be easier to do it before since less juice  
will be lost.


Lastly, are there any special techniques useful for freeze  
concentrating juice to such high levels?  I read with interest David  
Shenks method of repeated freeze-thaw cycles being careful not to  
disturb the container, to further stratify the juice.  I have also  
heard of the technique of putting a tap at the bottom of the  
container, and draining off the most sugar-loaded juices as the cider  
slowly thaws.  My initial plan is to try David's technique but to be  
siphoning a bit off the top each time as well, so the brix will climb  
even higher than what he got (he reported 1.098 SG = 23.7 brix).  I  
routinely freeze concentrate my juices by just  one round of this  
process, so am familiar with the siphoning technique and find it  
pretty easy to do.  This year for my main cider batch I took my juice  
from 1.050 to 1.070 by freeze concentrating, keeved it, and it is now  
slowly fermenting at 45F.

You can't separate an azeoptropic mix by simple distillation - but there
other tricks.  Molecular sieves, chemical reactions and pressure
swinging during distillation can all break azeotropes.


An azeotrope is one side effect of a 'non-ideal' solution.  The
molecules of compounds A & B (or more) don't interact together the same
way they interact with other 'A' or other 'B' molecules.  Cross
interactions can be either weaker or stronger than 'like' interactions.
And by interactions, we're talking about 'weak' electrostatic effect in
fluids, such as hydrogen bonding and dipole moments.  There are other
side effects.  When you make a non-ideal solution, it may warm up, or
cool down.  The final volume probably won't be a simple sum of the two
starting volumes.


Ethanol and water have an azeotrope at about 192 proof.  The exact
figure is hard to nail down - different sources don't agree.  But that
doesn't imply that you can't get all the ethanol out of water by simple
distillation.  I wonder if the article Chris mentions was simply wrong.


In craft distilling there's some alcohol left in the pot of a pot still
- - but as far as I know, it's only because it isn't cost effect to run
the still to the point where the head of the column is the boiling point
of water. Doesn't anyone know what the stripped output of a 'beer
stripper' is?  It would have to be under 0.5% ABV to squeak by the TTB
as alcohol free.  And that's pretty low.

I have a pneumatic actuator (also called air spring) that I use sometimes.
For an example of what it looks like, see:
http://www.firestoneindustrial.com/Industrial/index.htm
and look for Airstroke and actuators.
I got this as an old unit from the University laboratory where I work that
isn't used anymore. Diameter is about 30 cm and it can provide a force of 2
tons when inflated at 45 psi. And if you double the pressure, you will also
double the force. It can be inflated with a small bicycle pump, but this is
a bit long. A small electric pump can also be used.
Such units, new, cost about 200$. But I guess it could be found used as
they are used for truck suspension.


The unit I have just fits inside the barrel of my screw press. It is a
single bellow model with a usable stroke of 3 inches. The main advantage is
that the force doesn't decrease rapidly as the pomace is compressed. But,
on the other hand, it is a bit cumbersome to use and the setup time is a
bit long.


I use it almost only for overnight presses. I often do a second pressing of
the pomace and, on this pressing, the juice takes a lot more time to flow.
So, I fill the press to capacity late at night, I make a first compression
with the screw, set the air spring in, inflate it, and go to sleep. Next
morning, there is still a good force acting on the pomace, a good amount of
juice, and the pomace is very dry.
