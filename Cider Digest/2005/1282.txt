We are sadly lacking on information about disease 
susceptibility/tolerance of cider varieties and perry pears.  I've 
garnered a bit from casual contacts and remarks on scab resistance in 
England are probably dependable, but all in all, we have only a 
fraction of the data for ciders and perries that we have for the 
commercial fruiting varieties of apples and pears.


I would appreciate observations on incidence of fire blight, scab and 
other problems -- and, where it seems meaningful, of absence of 
infection under severe disease pressure.  I'll try to collate such 
information this winter.  Email me at jnc1@localnet.com

G'day group,


I thought I'd announce myself as I've just joined up. My interests are
primarily apple brandy but I'm sure there will be lots of useful info that
will apply. Is the discussion of apple brandy regarded as off-topic?


Cheers everyone

Hello all,


Is there anyone on the group that grows their own cider apples? I'm planning
to plant some here in Melbourne Australia and would greatly appreciate any
hints and tips on keeping them healthy. Also info about appropriate
varieties and their pollination requirements would be very handy too.


Thanks everyone
Peter Angus

Dang!  All the action is on the east coast!


John covered the main material from the Vintage Virginia Apples event, and
a previous digest covered the Franklin County (MA) Cider Day event.


I was at the Franklin County event, and I'd heard about the Vintage
Virginia event.  Both seem to be creditable in terms of content, speakers,
etc.


One obvious (?) question is:  How do they relate to one another?  Which one
"should" you attend?  Given John's description, I can't see any obvious
preference for one over the other.  Indeed, if I were on the eastern
seaboard, I'd find a way to get to both of them.  But from where I sit, in
the Great American (cider) Desert, I can only choose one.


How do the organizers of either event feel about the other one?


Even more, what about an event more aimed at the US west coast?  There's
a lot of cider out there!  But surely with Vintage Virginia and Franklin
County, the country doesn't need yet-another cider event, at least not in
the fall.  What events are the left-coast folks planning?

I am looking at starting to graft perry pears in a more traditional manor... 
  Yes, I know this will be long project.  To the folks that have never had 
the fortune to stand under a massive 250 year old pear tree and wondered 
about how many folks have enjoyed its perry over the last ten human 
generations, you are missing something...


But the more basic question is on the rootstock...  It's refered to as 
'seedling'.  Are the people really using seedling rootstock this day in age 
or are they using one of the large OHxF types?  If they are using seeds from 
the pomace piles, are they using the perry pear seeds?


I have tried to contact Bulmers (That word is not always evil folks...) 
orchard division, since I know they are selling standard sized perry pears 
that are grafted in more traditional maners (i.e. up above cattle height).  
But all of the email addresses that I can find, just bounce mail...  Anyone 
have a contact?


Thanks
