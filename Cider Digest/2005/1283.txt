There's been a surprising spate of articles submitted to the Cider Digest
but rejected because of mechanical content problems.  If you're considering
submitting a posting, or **especially** if you've submitted a posting and
had it bounced back at you, please read through this.  If you have
questions, please send them to cider-request@talisman.com.  That's the
admin address for this list.  DO NOT send to cider@talisman.com unless you
want your questions either ignored or sent on to 650 people who don't care!


A posting to the Cider Digest should be plain text.  Really!  It cannot be
HTML, nor a Word file.  Moreover, it cannot -contain- HTML, nor a Word file,
nor a picture of your dog (and no, not even a picture of your cider press).
It cannot have attachments.


Some WinDoze systems will produce a mail message containing text plus a
part called "winmail.dat".  Since that is additional content, and I can't
know what it is, it can't be part of a posting.


If you submit a posting and it goes out but you see "?" characters here and
there, it may mean you've got a crippled application that doesn't know how to
specify or use character sets properly.  (If you have questions about this
and you have a bit of technical understanding, contact me and I'll explain.)
If you have a choice of character set to use for a posting, use ISO 8859-1,
since that is the only one that will get through OK.  (ASCII 7-bit is a
purely safe subset.)  Windows 125x are Microsoft non-standards which will
end up with "?" scattered about.  Don't tell me, tell Bill.


TechieNote:  If I get a message with Mime type multipart/alternative, I
take the text part and ignore the other.  All is cool.  If I get
multipart/mixed, it bounces because I can't accept anything but text
and I can't do anything with the other parts.

Jim:  I had a fire blight strike on a third-leaf Dabinett at the UVM 
research orchard.  I didn't catch it very early and am afraid I'll have 
to cut back a good bit of the leader and train a new shoot.  It did have 
about 25 fruit on it, though!.  This was the only tree at the farm with 
any FB that I found.  Our bloom conditions were cool during dessert 
apple bloom, with Maryblyt model showing almost no chance for infection 
due to low EIP.  Afterwards, when the cider apples blossomed, we fell 
into a week of hot weather with very high likelihood of FB infection 
where inoculum was present.  I predict that with the later bloom of 
cider apples we'll see more FB on them in my neck of the woods where 
cooler prebloom and bloom temps tend to make the disease rare.


Hope that helps,

Hello to all.


I have an interest in perry pears and cider apples. I am located in Dorfen,
Upper Bavaria, Germany.
James Cummins wrote that we are lacking information on disease
susceptibility/tolerance of cider apples and perry pears.


Following publication might provide James with some more information and
further directions of investigation.


REPORT OF A WORKING GROUP ON MALUS/PYRUS: SECOND MEETING
http://www.ipgri.cgiar.org/publications/pubfile.asp?ID_PUB=918


page 28: "Work on fruit genetic resources in Germany and application to
fruit breeding and growing" lists cultivars of (cider)apples with low
disease susceptibility.


Evaluation results of the Fruit Genebank Dresden-Pillnitz:
[Out of 850 cultivars] Only 25 old cultivars and 4 cultivars from resistance
breeding programmes showed a low level of infection for both scab and
mildew. Some important old cultivars with the best performance are 'Roter
Bellefleur', 'Bittenfelder Saemling', 'Boertlinger Weinapfel', 'Cidor',
'Discovery', 'Engelshofer', 'Engelsberger Weinapfel', 'Gewuerzluiken',
'Hibernal', 'Jacob Fischer', 'Juliane', 'Kardinal Bea', 'Merton Prolific',
'Peasgoods Nonsuch', 'Prinzenapfel', 'Rote Sternrenette', 'Spaetbluehender
Taffetapfel' and others. These old cultivars can be regarded as carriers of
polygenic scab and mildew resistance, but the confirmation of this
hypothesis requires crossing experiments.


'Bittenfelder Saemling' is considered to have (polygene ?) scab and mildew
resistance in the field without fungicide spraying and is valued as the best
cider apple in the southwest of Germany.
Seed from Bittenfelder is widely used as standard size rootstock for cider
apples in traditional orchards in Germany.


'Boertlinger Weinapfel', 'Engelshofer', 'Engelsberger Weinapfel',
'Gewuerzluiken', 'Kardinal Bea' are well known traditional cider apples of
the southwest of Germany (Wuerttemberg).

Also some new disease resistant varieties developed specifically for the
French hard cider industry. -Judor, Cidor, Judeline, Jurella, Julian. Only a
few of these are currently available at the USDA apple germplasm facilities.

See page 13 of REPORT OF A WORKING GROUP:
Research activities at Apple Germplasm Bank - SERIDA (Servicio Regional de
Investigaci�n y Desarrollo Agroalimentario del Principado de Asturias)


A study was made of the resistance to scab and the variability of the
pathogen, and Venturia inaequalis races 1, 3 and 4 were found to be present.
Selection, assisted with markers, is carried out for scab resistance, aphid
and mildew resistance.

Selected apple and pear varieties of extensive fruit production in Germany
were tested for their resistance against fire blight during 2002 and 2003.

Perry Pears:
Under natural infection conditions the perry pear varieties Ober�sterreicher
and Gelbm�stler were shown to react susceptible.
Luxemburger Mostbirne, Metzer Bratbirne, Wahlsche Schnapsbirne (excellent
for distillation) showed low susceptibility.


Cider Apples:
Bohnapfel and Schoener aus Wiltshire showed low susceptibility.

Please have a look at Cider Digest #1231, 8 June 2005 - Pear Rootstock
Compatibility / James Cummins


This OSU page sums it up on pear rootstocks:

For Immediate Release
A GLOWing Competition
Grand Rapids Competition Drew Entries from Coast to Coast
56 Medals Awarded
Contact: Rex Halfpenny, Michigan Beer Guide, 248-628-6584 or mibeerguyd@aol.com
The 1st Great
Lakes Olde World Syder Competition completed with an award ceremony at the
DeVos Place Convention Center in Grand Rapids, Thursday, December 8, 2005
as part of the Great Lakes Fruit, Vegetable and Farm Expo. The unique
competition funded by the Michigan Apple Committee and cosponsored by the
Primetime Brewers, Founders Brewing Company, Siciliano's Market, Cascade
Winery and Michigan Beer Guide was open to all producers of fermented
beverages made with the addition of apples or pears. A total of 113
ciders, meads and fruit beers were entered by producers from coast to
coast in two divisions, commercial and noncommercial.            The
entries were judged in their respective division by blind tasting panels
composed of industry members, certified beer judges, and press members in
14 style categories. A total of 56 of the potential 84 medals were
awarded.Michigan has already established itself as a producer of wine,
microbrewing, and most recently, distillation. "Fermented apples are the
natural progression of this trend," said Rex Halfpenny, Competition
Organizer. "The competition serves many purposes. It pulls a young
industry together while recognizing quality and providing feedback. It
brings media attention to the industry, exposes our apple farmers to a
potentially new product and introduces them to variations they may never
have considered."Entries ranged in color from clear to mahogany with
alcohol running from the average 4-5 percent up to a fortifying 20
percent. There were still ciders, sparkling ciders, sweet ciders,
semisweet ciders, and dry ciders. There were products made with honey,
barley, raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, figs, raspberries, maple syrup,
pears, plums, grapes, watermelon, pineapple, Marion berries, and brown
sugar. Some of the most amazing examples were aged in bourbon barrels.    
       In the 1st Division, Commercial Products, there were 45 entries in
8 of the 14 style categories. The largest category entered was Common
Cider, with 13 entries. A total of 23 medals were awarded, 10 went to
Michigan producers. Of the 10, three went to Black Star Farms, Suttons Bay
who swept the Specialty Cider/Perry (made with pears) category. The most
decorated producer was Uncle Johns Fruit House Winery, St. Johns, who took
6 medals as well as Best of Show in the Commercial division with Uncle
John's Farm House Perry.In the 2nd Division, Noncommercial, there were 68
entries in 13 of the 14 style categories with 33 medals awarded. The
largest category entered here was Cyser with 13 entries. A total of 33
medals were awarded, 23 went to Michigan home producers. Yet the most
decorated home producer was Gary Awdey of Eden, New York, who took 6
medals including the Division Best Of Show with his Common cider made with
mostly Golden Russet Apples. Plans are already underway for the second
competition in fall of 2006.For more information and a complete list of
winners visit the Michigan Hard Cider website at www.michiganhardcider.org
