It bears mentioning that some of the people who post to the Cider Digest did
well in last week's Great Lakes Olde World Syder Competition in Grand
Rapids.  Terence Bradshaw of Calais, Vermont (who posted as recently as the
last issue) took two gold medals in the noncommercial division.   Terry's
English and French ciders took top honors in these style classifications.
This will come as no surprise to those of us who had the good fortune to
sample some of Terry's ciders at the keeving session at Ciderday in
Colrain, Massachusetts.


Also, in the commercial division, Charles McGonegal of Burlington, Wisconsin
took a bronze medal in the Common Cider category with Aeppeltreow Winery's
Barn Swallow Cider, a bronze medal in the fruit cider category with his Red
Poll Cran-Apple Cider, and a silver medal in the Applewine category with his
Autumn Glory.


Finally, Drew Zimmerman of Skagit Beverages in Burien, Washington took a
gold medal in the English Cider category with his Red Barn Cider Fire
Barrel.


Congratulations to all.  My apologies if I'm overlooking anyone else who
posts to the Digest.

In Cider Digest #1281, 3 December 2005, John Campbell mentioned Harrison
juice.  Is that the old New Jersey Harrison apple mentioned by Downing and
others? Would it be possible for me to obtain scionwood from you?


Thanks,

There are a couple distillers lurking on Digest. (Even some legal ones,
of which I'm in the waiting for the permits in the mail category).
Cider makers usually have some interest in cider brandy/calvados and
pommeau - but it doesn't come up often on this Digest.  Most of the
readership lives in the US, where distilling at home is highly illegal,
and distilling as a business requires pounds (literally) of paperwork.


There's a lot of experience, and maybe even a bit of real knowledge and
wisdom, kicking around the readership - for cultivar selection (mostly
opinion), cider growing, and fermentation.


The basics of calvados 'mash' are essentially those of cider making.
Most of the important factors are the same.  Cultivar selection is a
little different, since you're after aromatics and not tannins.  And
distillers don't practice some of the pectin manipulations that cider
makers try: 1) they result in low alcohol ciders, and 2) they make extra
methanol.


Good luck.
