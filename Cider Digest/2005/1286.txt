I realized (rather belatedly...sorry, I'm kinda slow these days) that the
posting from Peter Angus and the reply from Charles McGonegal on cider
brandy might have been seeking an opinion, janitorial or better, on the
appropriateness of "cider brandy" as a topic.


Keep in mind that the digest is -not- moderated.  Once in a great while I
will give a gentle nudge, but mostly all I do is clean out the garbage
(spam and bad-mailer-barfback) that doesn't belong at all.


My take on distilling or distilled-cider topics is essentially "Why not?"
As Charles said, there are only a few folks doing it.  Thus it's not likely
to become an overbearing topic.  But on the other side, where else are you
going to get any information or discussion on distilled cider?  It's a
wondrous substance, worthy of -some- discussion -somewhere-.  (Apropos
Andrew's comments, my electronic alter-ego brings back a bottle or two
of Somerset Cider Brandy every time he makes a pilgrimage to England.)


I would only step in if the discussion diverged into illegal activity like
home distillation or how not to get caught or whatever.  Home distillation
is--again as Charles said--not just illegal, but HIGHLY illegal (large
penalties) in the countries which account for most of the readership of the
digest (US, UK, AU), so that's right out.


If anybody objects strongly to some (probably small) amount of discussion
on distilled cider, please tell me off-list at cider-request@talisman.com

Subject: Harrison at Vintage VA Apples
From: "McGonegal, Charles" <Charles.McGonegal@uop.com>

Tom Burford spent some time talking about the recovery of Harrison
during this year's Cidermaker's Forum. (Even more interesting, he
described other recovery missions involving sneakiness, cunning,
trespass and hounds.  What some people will go through for the sake of
an apple.)  Harrison apples and [sweet] cider were both tasted. =20


The Harrison presented were middling size and heavily sooty-blotched,
but otherwise unblemished. (Tom noted that a candidtate tree was found
in New England (I think) several years before the announced recovery.
But it was in a managed orchard and had no sooty-blotch - it looked out
of character without it, and Tom was hesitant to make the call on the
ID.)  The Harrison juice was brightly fruity, with subtle berry notes,
great sweet/sharp character and great bouquet.  It was also one of the
most pectic/viscous juices I've ever seen.  At least as much as my
English Golden Russet.  I'd recommend it without hesitation.  We can
hope it holds its character in a wide range of climates/soils.


I don't believe VVA sells scionwood any longer, but a number of folks
have it planted, including Blue Ridge Cider in western VA. (And myself -
but the trees are young :-(

For a welded steel press frame, what is an acceptable rating for a
hydraulic bottle jack that will maximize juice extraction efficiency from a
small rack and cloth set but will not place excessive stress on the frame
welds?


The frame is 2 inch square tube with fillet welds and the racks are
approximately 20 x 20 in. I'm planning on 4 cloths per cheese in this small
backyarder.


I suppose the resulting pressure is a relative thing since I'd have control
over the amount of force applied (based on how much I actually pump up the
jack) and any jack between 4 and 12-ton rating would probably suffice.
However, being the detail-oriented scientist that I am, I can't resist
posing the question to the more experienced cider makers in the group in
hopes of gaining some technical specs if possible. In that vein, I'd love
to put a pressure transducer in there to see the real psi attained, plus a
thermocouple to see if the pomace heats up but that's putting the cart
before the horse.


Thank you for your expertise!

 Dear Dick ,  I was  flattered by Andrew Lea's comments about our 
apple distillery.  However contrary to his views we are always very
happy to show  cider makers around our modest distillery in Somerset,
England.  We have received a huge amount of hospitality in Calvados in
the past and hope that we all have a common interest in spreading the
word about apples and orchards.  Julian Temperley www.ciderbrandy.co.uk

Dick's absolutely right on with this one .... I have no experience with 
Nick at all, so I can't and wouldn't venture an opinion ...  but the 
first question I would ask him is did Tom Burford have anything to do 
with the identification of the scionwood origins?  Tom rediscovered it, 
and both he and Jim Cummins will tell you that mis-identification of 
apple varieties is a much larger curse than anyone would care to admit.  
Same goes for it's historical blending companion the Campfield.  Getting 
it 'right' on this variety is (I think) very important for all of us 
concerned with a north American cider industry's future.  I wish I had a 
couple more acres to devote to cider ... they'd all be Harrison's after 
tasting the juice at Vintage Virginia Apples last month.

I am fairly new to this site.  I have questions on freezing cider, before
and after fermentation to remove water.  Before I post my questions is
there a way to look up old postings to see if it has been discussed?
  Thanks

Subject: using honey in bottle fermentation

After three years restoring an old orchard on my property I had my  
first crop this year. At least enough for a couple carboys. I want to  
bottle ferment some sparkling cider and am interested in using honey  
rather than sugar for taste and "mouth feel". Should I use the same  
amount as sugar (2 tsp per bottle) or should I use more? Anyone have  
other advice? Should I use something other than honey? How does that  
taste come out? I have a blend of baldwins, northern spys and rhode  
island greening. It's pretty tart after the first ferment. Thanks for  
the advice. You guys are pretty impressive, I tried a lot of your  
ciders at Cider Day this year...

In case anyone's interested...A good article on the
west coast cider movement. Not entirely complete, but
a rather good story about the folks out here. Hope
everyone is having a happy holidays and taking time
out for a good wassail.
