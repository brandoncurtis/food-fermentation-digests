This is one of the first books I read on cider making and I'm glad to see
it's still (or back?) in print.


As good as it is, I think more people are now aware of Annie's amazing
writing ability after seeing the recent blockbuster based on her short story

Its the cider limbo: how slow can you go? (the fermentation rate,  
that is)


I have always worked to get the slowest fermentation possible, and I  
seem to have succeeded beyond my hopes this year -- it recently  
seemed to stop.  This is a keeved cider fermenting at 43F with  
natural yeasts only, no addition of any kind.  I decided to up the  
temperature to around 47F and it seems to be picking up a bit now.  I  
measured the SG and it is losing a point every four days, having  
started at 1.070 and being at 1.050 now.  The good news is the flavor  
seems to be much more aromatic than my past batches; all I am worried  
about is having it stall.  I noticed Claude's comment about a year in  
the carboy which seems to imply an even slower rate than mine, which  
should be finished by early summer at its current rate.


Having never explored this territory of "too slow", I am curious  
where others draw the line and what you do.  I expect I will probably  
keep the temperature up and not risk having it stall if I lower it  
again.  I went back and looked at that Danish article surveying  
French cider makers and the temperatures listed there were in the  
45-55F range (7-12C), so it seems I am still on the low end at 47F.


Also while I am asking a question I am curious what temperatures  
people run MLF at.  I have run it in the past at 65-70F (just take  
the carboy out of the fridge) since the culture packet recommends  
higher temperatures.  I find the fermentation can start up a bit when  
I raise the temp, and then I get a cider drier than I want.   I am  
debating whether I could go for something like 55F that would be warm  
enough to get a MLF but keep the yeast fermentation from getting out  
of hand.  I should add that my goal is to produce a cider with  
residual sweetness, so I want the MLF to run when there is still a  
good amount of sugar left in the juice.  In reading that Danish  
article again I notice that two of the French producers mentioning  
MLF claim to let the MLF occur in the bottle; one place mentions 50F  
(9-10C) as the temperature in which they mature the bottled cider for  
two months and "sometimes" MLF naturally occurs; the other place does  
not give a temperature but seem to indicate MLF always occurs in the  
bottle for them.  A third place mentions 56F (13-14C) to mature with  
MLF, in steel tanks and not bottles and over a period of 2-10 months.

Subject: Apple tree pruning
From: Jason MacArthur <rotread@localnet.com>
Date: Sun, 5 Feb 2006 07:40:09 -0500


I have a few dwarf apple trees going into 3rd leaf with lower tier 
branches which are almost equal to the size of the trunk.  In fact, the 
trunk narrows significantly above these branches- clearly they are 
draining significant resources from the central leader.  Reading 
through the pruning literature there seems to be a great deal of 
conflicting advice on how to deal with a situation like this, from 
"never prune  a branch until it's fruited" to "don't bother growing a 
whole side of the tree you will only need to cut out later".
        
    The longer I wait the larger these branches get, so I am wondering 
what to do.  Is there any way to significantly slow them down enough to 
allow the trunk to regain dominance?  Or should I hack the tree back to 
a whip and start all over?
        
    Thanks and happy growing,

Dick asks about calcium in digest# 1297


We use calcium mostly for Honey Crisp to help mitigate its wild bitter pit
affliction.  For Honey crisp we may add a foliar spray of calcium once a
week or more.  If it is hot and dry it ends up being more.  Other verities
can have this problem.  Honey Crisp is really notorious for it.  The rest of
the orchard does usually get calcium once at a timely application.  I do not
have a clue how calcium treatments affect a fermentation, keeved or not.  I
have heard (with nothing to substantiate) that calcium applications may
increase brix marginally.  I would like to know more myself if anyone has
insight.

Digest #1297 fermentation speed/ML


I would like to point out that yeast fermentation and ML are two separate
and different chemical changes.  Each with their own problems and rewards.
They should never be lumped, IMHO.  Related to speed.  If I could get a
lower temp. fermentation I could no doubt slow this process down. I use well
water to chill tanks and that is as about as low as I can go.  Regardless, I
still will not hesitate to use nutrients/DAP when I can smell the
funkiness/sulphourous yuckies.  Sadly, I am limited by time and the ciders
have to be ready to market by next fall.  They have the advantage of being
fresh and fruity and appealing to many.  Or is it appalling to many?

Dick asked for more comparative input on fermentation rates.


My 2004 crop ciders took 6 to 9 months to finish out and get into the 
bottles.  The best cider took the longest.  I deliberately slowed 
fermentation, clarifying the juice before letting fermentation start, and 
racking multiple times.


I didn't end up pressing any of the pitiful 2005 crop, so nothing to try 
keeving with.  Fortunately I still have 4 or 5 cases left from 2004.


Cheers,
Tim

Subject: Apples in bottles
From: "John Jeffs" <pdms@senet.com.au>

Hi All,


Just curious if anyone would know which apple varieties are best suited to
be grown in bottles to be filled with apple brandy? Also, is there another
way to put an apple in a bottle instead of actually growing the apple in the
bottle?


Many Thanks

As she promised me, Diane was gracious enough to pass off some more data 
on the Harrisons (from her first hand experience with them). We all owe 
her a debt of thanks ... see below.  Hopefully her cider venture will 
take off with a bang this year.   She, like the Sheltons, (Vintage 
Virginia Apples) have been strong supporters of Tom Burford's efforts.

"... Note that my orchard is at 3000' in the Virginia Blue Ridge  
mountains. Results will vary as you know!
Harvested Harrison on 10/8/05
14.0 Brix
Brown seeds, creamy flesh, tart balanced juice
I field tested Harrison on 9/24 (Brix 12.25, seeds brown, flesh  creamy 
but thin and tasteless) and on 10/1 (Brix 13.75, again thin  and 
tasteless). This is one apple that, at least in my orchard,  requires a 
careful eye during harvest.
Sweated fruit on cool concrete floor for 3 days.
At pressing Harrison SG 1.070
I fermented my small supply of Harrison as 50% of a cider mixture,  with 
the other 50% being Margil, Roxbury Russett and Rhode Island  Greening. 
Total SG for this mixture was 1.060. Post fermentation the  cider is 
8.9% alcohol and 0.71 g/100mL Total Titratable Acidity. This  cider is 
golden honey in color with fresh apple aromas and a nice  acid balance, 
at least to my taste.
Let me note that I've found Harrison to be a shy bearing tree. I grow  
this variety on M111 and had my first harvest on trees that are in  
their 6th leaf only this past fall, at least two years later than  what 
I consider the more successful varieties on my site (Margil,  Roxbury 
Russett, Cox, etc). Harrison is difficult to spread and this  variety is 
not the most disease resistant in my low spray orchard.  But the juice 
has a mouth feel and texture unlike any apple I grow  other than the few 
Kingston Black and Stoke Red I am able to coax  into harvest. ..."
