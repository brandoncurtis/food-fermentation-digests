I used to be deathly afraid of contaminating my beer/wine/mead/cider
that way until someone observed that the bacteria living in your mouth
are going from a pH neutral, non-alcoholic environment that's almost
100F to an acidic, alcoholic environment that's about 40F cooler.

Lew Nichols used to live in the town next to my hometown, and still has
his cider house and orchard there.  He lives somewhere in the greater
Upper Connecticut Valley area, not sure if New Hampshire or Vermont.
I've run into him a few times and he certainly knows his cider stuff.
Annie Proulx is his ex-wife.  Last I knew they had an arrangement that
he could continue to revise the book and keep the proceeds, so any new
additions are his.  I confess to not having the newer editions, just my
very well-used, dogeared copy. I don't know if Lew is aware of the
digest or not, and my sense is that he wouldn't care either way, as he
seems a bit reclusive these days.


As for the book's value, I'll respectfully disagree with Dick and say
that as a /manual/, I prefer this book to Watson's.  They really are
complimentary, and Ben filled in some gaps especially with specifics on
the European  cider fruit.  Proulx and Nichol's book, however
out-of-date some of its methods, really is the best 'how-to' on cider
out there, IMO. I think Ben even acknowledges that in his book where he
leaves the detailed steps up to them.


And by the way, I am not afraid to start a siphon by mouth if necessary,
which seems to be more than 50% of the time.

I was more than a little humbled by the comments of our Cider Janitron,
Dick Dunn, who says he prefers my book, "Cider, Hard and Sweet" to
Annie Proulx and Lew Nichols "Cider".


I have something of a unique perspective, since I used to be an editor
for Storey, the publisher of Proulx and Nichols book. It first came
out, I believe, in the early 1980s, when the company was still called
Garden Way Publishing and based up in Burlington. It has much good
information, but I wrote my own book in a different way, because I felt
that (7-8 years ago) most people didn't know how to make cider, and
needed a beginner's book, rather than launching them into barrel
fermentation and keeving from the git-go. So I tried to be very
thorough and very basic. In essence, I took what I felt were the best
qualities of three books that were then in print: Paul Correnty's "The
Art of Cidermaking" (now out of print, unfortunately), Proulx and
Nichols' book, and Vrest Orton's classic, "The American Cider Book."
Then I added my own peculiar (and I do mean peculiar) touch to the
subject.


Annie Proulx is a fine writer, both of fiction and nonfiction -- but
she's moved from Vermont to Wyoming, writes exclusively fiction now,
and I gather is embarrassed that she ever wrote anything for the likes
of Rodale and Garden Way -- which is too bad. Her book on salad
gardening is one of my favorites.


At any rate, Storey continues to keep the book periodically updated (I
believe the third edition came out around 2000, about the time my book
went into paperback. Annie no longer works on the updates; they hire
someone else to do it when it needs doing. I don't know if Lew Nichols
is still with us, or still making cider -- he used to be in Vershire,
VT, which is where Proulx hailed from too, and where there is still a
commercial cidery (Flag Hill Farm, run by Sabra Ewing and Sebastian
Lousada).


In any case, although I keep saying this, I am planning to work on a
thorough-going revision and expansion of my book, hopefully starting
this spring, and in fact spoke with my publisher last week about it.
Since I was essentially a neophyte and just this side of an ignoramus
about cidermaking in 1999, I trust that I will do a better job this
time around. I am overhauling the resources, the recipes, and adding
things like an intermediate level cider making section, revised
varieties info., and info. on ice cider and perry. My goal is to have
the new edition out in the Fall of 2007.

I'm afraid this is normal. All fully fermented ciders are very dry
because there is no sugar left (unlike beer where there are lots of
slightly sweet non-fermentable sugars that remain).  How to retain
natural sweetness, or how to add it back, is a vexing question which has
consumed many kB of discourse on this Digest!

One month is *not* long for a cider fermentation! Many of us will expect
it to take 3 months or more.  The yeasty taste may be due to lack of
maturation time.  Rack it into a clean vessel kept tightly closed with
one Campden tablet per gallon and come back to it in 3 months time.  If
you are starting from a kit using apple concentrate you may have some
slightly odd flavours anyway.

Why either?  Apple juice on its own should ferment out to give a cider
of 6% alcohol or more - it doesn't need extra sugar.  This is only
necessary if you're going for an apple wine or a fortified New England
style winter-warmer cider with raisins and all the trimmings!  But
perhaps it's part of the kit recipe because a cider made just from
regular concentrate can be a pretty strange beast and may need
sugar-water to knock the odd flavours back a bit.

I can't think of any science which supports that.  Commercial cider
makers use vast quantities of glucose (dextrose) syrup for their
(inaccurately described) "chaptalisation" which substitutes for part of
the apple juice.  Regular white sugar (sucrose) "inverts" to glucose and
fructose once it gets into the acidic environment of cider, and both
sugars are handled by most yeasts along pretty much the same lines on
the trip to alcohol.  Dextrose is generally used by brewers because it's
much cheaper than sugar, coming from hydrolysed corn starch  (in North
America) or wheat starch (in Europe).  Most people on this Digest would
not be using either.


A good simple procedure for making cider from apple juice is given in
the Ag Canada booklet (details on my website or from this link to Bill
in Canada http://mars.ark.com/~squeeze/7D-cider.html).  You can use
store-bought pasteurised juice or cloudy sweet cider to start - just be
sure from the label that it doesn't contain any preservatives (sorbate
or benzoate) that will stop the yeast from working.

Do we know that either of them are actively involved in cider-making
now? - Google seems silent on the matter. I met them both and had some
later correspondence with them when they visited the UK and France on
their research trip in the late 70's - Lew Nichols was really the
cidermaker and Annie was more of the scribe (a very high quality scribe
as it turned out!).  At that time before her fame as a novelist she made
her living as a free-lance journalist, I understand. The first edition
of the book had several pictures taken at our Long Ashton facility - the
current edition has only one, of a rather sad stone edge-runner mill
which has now long since been replaced by housing.  [Sorry just a
personal reminiscence!]

I am wondering if Andrew would be willing to elaborate on the
connection between fast fermentation and microbial instability.   What
is the correlation between these two qualities of a juice, and what
types of "microbial instability" result?

OK, I admit, that particular "archaic boner" is still a regular part of
my cider making- how do I start a siphon without it?

Don't worry about 'cider fruit'. Good cider can be made from almost any
variety of apple. Parts of England use only cookers and eaters such as
Bramleys and Coxes.

If, as I suspect, you are in the good old US of A, my friend Martin
Stokes in Bangor, Maine, makes cider from unpasteurised apple juice that
he buys from farmers. It is impossible to work out what was in the kit
juice.

That is quick, but perhaps you kept it in a warm place. That would
produce a fast fermentation and could also affect the taste. My cider,
which started in October/November/December, is still only at about 1030
degrees, but it has been out in the open and we have had a pretty cold
winter here. I am very happy with this!

What yeast did you use? In the UK, big commercial cider makers kill the
natural yeast and use saccharomyces byanus (I bet I have the spelling
wrong!), which is a champagne-type yeast. We craft cider makers use the
natural yeast in the apples. There is no way of knowing what the kit
yeast is. I suspect, certainly in the case of beer,  that some kit
manufacturers use a yeast that just produces a good head so that novices
can be reassured that it is fermenting, and ignore the effect on taste.

I use white cane sugar, which should give a neutral taste, but I only
use it to get the original gravity of the juice up to a level that will
result in 7% alcohol by volume after fermentation. Some years I don't
use any. What are you using it for?

Howdy:
I've been lurking here for awhile but now I need advice and counsel


  I'm planning a very small (approx 1 acre) cider orchard in Butte County, CA
USDA Hardiness zones 8A-9A but serious heat in the summer, over 90
degrees (F) consistently in June-Sept however at least well irrigation
is very available.


and I'm also getting to the age where climbing about in tall trees will
not be interesting in the future ... so I'm considering using dwarf
rootstock, and perhaps a trellis system.


Any advice on:
1) Cider varieties that can take the heat , and limited cooling,
approximately 800-1100 chilling units (1 hour below 45F) per season.
2) Rootstock
3) General advice on changing my plans to walnuts instead ...
Thanks

I live in Minnesota (zone 4) and I am interested in planting some
bittersweet or bittersharp cultivars.  Does anyone have any  information on
cider apples that would be cold hardy enough for the  area?  Another thing
to take into consideration is that we often  get a first frost near the
end of November.
