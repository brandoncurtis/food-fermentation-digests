 Dear Dick,  As normal  at this time of year we are busy  organizing  this 
year's  Bath and  West   Cider Competition in Somerset, England, which takes 
place at the  Royal Bath and West Show at the end of May.  The competition 
is the oldest and  biggest in the UK. Entries come from  all over , 
including Spain, France and  the USA.  Last year a bottle fermented from the 
US was a prize winner.  This year the main section will have three judges, a 
well known  food and wine writer Tamasin Day Lewis, assisted by  Robert 
Kaufelt from New York, and  Nick Bradstock, a former Master Cidermaker at 
Taunton Cider and  president of the European Cidermakers' Association.  The 
farmhouse  section will also have three respected, but more local , judges. 
We would be very pleased to  have   entries from the US, and  I am happy to 
help . Ciders can be sent to the us in Somerset and we can arrange their 
delivery to the show etc etc. If anybody needs  help please contact Julian 
Temperley, www.ciderbrandy.co.uk

Sorry for not replying sooner.  I wanted to warn Ben Watson of his use of R2 
yeast.  I have used this strain in the past and found it needs high levels 
of nutrients to not produce excessive amounts of H2S.  I have created stinky 
cider from this yeast and advise all who use it to be sure to add proper 
nutrients.  in the same year with the same cider a very clean cider was 
produced with DV10 which is my currant favorite cider yeast.


thanks,  Eric - Burdett, NY

I was told by a fruit tree expert a couple of years ago that the best
angle for a fruiting branch is 30 degrees above horizontal.

Andrew, do you have data on the concentrations of Ascorbic Acid in apple 
juices?  Given that all apple juice probably contains some concentration 
of Vitamin C, and that many people add it to keep the juice from 
oxidizing, adding sodium benzoate is quite likely to create some 
concentration of benzene in cider.


Benzene is a known human carcinogen.  While the WHO drinking water limit 
is 10 ppb, the USEPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) is 5 ppb and the 
California MCL is 1 ppb.  The California Proposition 65 level is 3.5 
ppb, representing an excess cancer risk level of 1 in 100,000 assuming 2 
liters per day.  You'd have to be quite the cider aficionado to consume 
those kinds of quantities over a lifetime... Cancer potencies are 
frequently non-linear, however, and I have no information on the risks 
at higher levels like the 60 ppb alluded to in the article. Probably a 
lot less than we get from driving in rush-hour traffic, but still: I'd 
rather believe my cider was good for me.


Cheers,
Tim
