Some folks here know that last year I had a good competition season, but 
I have had bad ones before, especially before the new style guidelines 
(thanks to Dick, Gary, Drew, and all at BJCP!)  Some thoughts:


>Mike Beck: I have nothing against BJCP and I appreciate

I agree it's confusing, but in reality the beer guys are better at this 
than the wine folks, in my opinion.  And us cider folks don't yet have a 
large enough following/clout/marketing arm to set up a CJCP or such 
organization.  The way I see it, we are working within the BJCP ranks 
until cider gets a larger acceptance and can go it alone, as far as 
consistent national competition guidelines are concerned.

Couldn't agree more.  I don't know how they enforce the guidelines for 
beer, but this whole Bulmer's thing at GLOWS really smeared things a 
bit.  Maybe some sort of affidavit system should be put in place, where 
the entrant agrees that their cider is being entered in the best 
possible category and would be due for disqualification if it turns out 
to blatantly not fit the guidelines.  Obviously there needs to be some 
discretion involved, but the Woodpecker = English cider thing was a 
clear example of the cider not even coming close to the style guidelines.

Think of homebrewing and commercial craft brews 25 years ago.  You 
couldn't find commercial examples of many styles at that time, and it 
was the homebrewers who made them, shared them, and generated enough 
interest to make a market for the breweries to pick it up.  That's my 
analogous to what should happen with the cider competitions.  As great, 
home-crafted ciders get out there and get noticed, commercial operations 
should take notice and fill in the gaps.

Yeah, I've been burned there before.  Many of my ciders are bottled at 
1.5-2.5 atm or so, even in regular corked bottles.  I call them 
'petilant' on the label under 'level of carbonation'.  For the same 
cider I had one judge tell me it was 'still' and another say it was 
'sparkling'.  I don't know how to solve this other than to have a 
specific 'petilant' category.

I'd recommend a permanent groundcover of creeping fescue/perennial 
ryegrass/ bluegrass, roughly 1:1:1, at least that works in my area 
(northern New England).  Seed it down in the row middles at 
establishment.  BUT, in the trees'  early years keep all grass/weed 
competition down by mulching and/or herbicide.  After year four or so 
you can let grass grow in closer but keep it well mowed and keep an eye 
on shoot growth to guage nitrogen or water stress: you should get 18 
inches of terminal growth per year, give or take.
I use a stone mulch about 1' wide at the base of my trees and glyphosate 
in a 2' strip down the row.  My orchard is about to head into third leaf 
and is doing great. I also have a drip irrigation system which allows me 
to inject fertilizer into the water.  It's a lot simpler and cheaper 
than it sounds.


That works for me,

There is a major distinction within judging between amateur and commercial
competitions.  Commercial competitions do not require the same evaluation
and feedback in writing as amateur competitions (but I personally wish
they did).

The format is totally up to the organizer, NOT the BJCP. If the Campbell
or even the Dutch method were to be used, the organizer would have to
educate the judges about the format.  The best competitions always have a
judge meeting to discuss the organizers format and needs.  Many judges are
avid wine, cider and mead makers as well as beer, so this should be just a
matter of simple instructions.  Those that are not makers of these and are
comfortable judging mead/cider, are typically aquainted with both the
Campbell and the Dutch methods of judging.


However, one should consider that the entry fees are typically modest for
beer/mead/cider competitions compared to commercial wine.  As such, there
is not the available funds to both handle the competition overhead AND the
innumerable awards needed for these wine-based methods of awards.


There are BJCP plans to create better Cider and Mead judges.  The planned
formation of these committees has already been announced.


That all said, please consider that the guidelines (even for beer) are not
comprehensive of everything made.  Nor are they meant for deliniation of
every 'proper' style.  The are simply a target for competition.  As such,
they represent a common language for both the cidermaker and the judge to
frame an evaluation.


What that does is allow for a comparison to the target for flavor, aroma
and that elusive quality of balance.  Every cider maker and every judge
have tastebuds.  Like it or not, the feedback given is what the judges
tasted that day.  The latter is particularly important to commercial
makers because it represents what might be perceived by consumers (hence
my desire to write evaluations).


Cider and mead are NOT the ugly step-children of the BJCP.  Many judges
refrain from judging these because they do not feel they understand it
enough to provide quality feedback.  This is quite the opposite of the
"whatever as long as it has alcohol" perception that some mead/cidermakers
have about beer judges.


After all, as competitor or judge; we do this as a hobby, to gain more
insight and to become better producers of quality beverages.

What is an 'English Cider'? Is there a defined formula or character? 
Sweet, dry, so much sugar, sparkling or still? So much acid? Certain 
types of apples?


I make ciders and cysers of various types and I wouldn't have a clue 
what catagory to put them in.

Gary's right Patrick, there certianly are several scattered around the 
east coast.  In the fall we have a seminar hosted by Vintage Virgina 
Apples, (the announcement will show up here when it's scheduled
http://vintagevirginiaapples.com/
 that is attended by a variety of cider makers.  This last fall, Chas 
McGonegal gave a presentation, as did Tom Burford who has been 
responsible for re-discovering some of our country's lost cider apple 
strains.  We're hoping that this fall Dr. Chris White of White Labs will 
be presenting (along with whatever other presentations Chuck and 
Charlotte Shelton have cooked up for us). jccampb

FYI.  Might be of interest, although arguably not up to the standard of 
your US competitions - no style guides, points marking schemes or 
anything like that!!  Just quaff-and-judge in the good old British 
manner!  Intending entrants should e-mail Sally Lane for details. 
Intenational entries are accepted.

Hello everyone,


I must say I have been enjoying the articles on this journal for the last 
few years.  I have recently purchased several acres of land with pasture 
near Nelson BC, Canada, and am inspired to start planting an orchard with 
cider specific apple varieties.


Is there anyone nearby, or in the Okanagan, or near Vancouver BC who is 
selling cider specific apple trees.  I am travelling over the next couple of 
weeks to the west coast and would love to get a hold of some.


FYI:  Nelson BC is located approximately 100 km north of Spokane Washington.


cheers,

Please tell us who makes the press you've got!


I've seen belt presses in the UK and I was really impressed (sic).  There's
a setup that's literally dump fruit in one end and take juice and marc out
the other.  Plus as you said it's continuous, no batch steps.


But the ones we saw in the UK were Austrian (Voran), and I wonder if
someone has cleared the hurdles of getting them into the US and getting
them to work on our power, or, if there are more manufacturers of the
continuous belt presses.
