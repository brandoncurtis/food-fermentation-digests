Dick Dunn asks of Mike Beck:
>>Please tell us who makes the press you've got!


I second that!  And If you could copy it to a CiderNet article under the
Equipment Vendors topic, too, that would be great.


I've seen Mike's press, though not in action.  A very useful and
picturesque setup in the middle of an old hay barn.  The press sits on
the roof of a concrete room that houses sweet cider storage tanks.
Washed apple are elevated up to the press on one side and the press cake
slide down a chute on the other into a waiting wagon.  Now when, I saw
it, I was with a group of disitllers, many from Canada.  We all chuckled
at the various things that our inspectors would complain about (the
Canadians seeing very different things than the US folks - like the
positions of handrails) - but the streamlined workflow was awesome.


The fellow who runs the orchard I work with has one particular reason he
won't consider belt presses, that I'd like to hear Mike's input on.  My
pressor can't imagine how you get the belt sanitized.  It currently
takes him  1-1.5 hours to clean his rack and cloth press, and he
bleaches the clothes.  Mike, can you tell us more about how you do the
after-run cleanup?

Mike asked how can he know what cider fits into what category.  As has been
repeated here many times the BJCP Style Guidelines offer some "guidance."
http://www.bjcp.org/styles04/cider.html.  While not the final say, I find
they offer pretty good descriptions.  Ben Watson's books and the few other
cider books are also some help, especially for the brave at heart seeking
to recreate classic French Ciders.


If the Macro-Ciders or apple-pops want to enter competitions that follow
these guidelines, I don't see any problem.  Clearly drinkable, they would
have trouble matching these guidelines.  Maybe the BJCP should consider a
separate category for fruity, back sweetened, light ciders, sort of like its
"American Light Lager" category.  As a home cider maker, I would be very
impressed with a home cider that pulled this off, just like I was with a
homebrewed light lager that I judged that could put all the Macro-Breweries
to shame, but still was crisp, clean and very very mild.


Now that is said, please don't enter any of the up-coming competitions.
I need a ribbon.

Dick,


the Voran people have agreed to bring me a Voran press is I want one.
The voltage/power requirements are a non-issue in my opinion. The price is.

Re: Digest #1310


Dick Dunn asked about belt presses in the last digest:
Our press was manufactured by a company called FTI, it is their J-300 model.
The company has changed names and it is now called Super Brite Technologies.
They have and continue to be made in Michigan.  A company called Michigan
Orchard Supply michiganorchard.com has a picture on their website of what
they are selling.  Our website has some pictures of our press,
www.ujcidermill.com  it looks very similar to the day we bought it.  It is
just as you say though.  Insert fruit on one end and out the other comes
juice  and pomace is separated. As fast as the fork-lift can dump bins if
you have the speed on high.   There has been a few other belt presses made.
A company called JWI made belt presses for a while.  Criveller Canada also
has two models of a belt press for sale.  I do not know about the Voran.


I was a little hesitant to change, I cut my teeth on a 36" R&C.  Once I
found out I could eliminate the cleaning process of racks and cloths and
improve GPH while not loosing much on efficiency and cut man hours in half,
we switched.  I love tradition but I have more apples than time.  I think
these presses compare in price to a similar sized Good Nature. After 10
years of use I would be hard pressed to change.

It seems that the general wisdom is to ferment cider slowly, for several
months, at a cool temperature, say around 50 degrees F.
I was wondering what equipment/techniques everybody uses to keep their cider
cool for all that time.  Simply keeping it outside or in a cool basement is
no longer an option for me, since I now live in an apartment in San Diego.


Any help would be greatly appreciated.
