It must be nice!  I used to have a basement.  Then I sold the house and 
moved to Aloha (just outside of Portland, OR).  Housing is expensive, 
here.  I now live in an 1100 sq ft apartment with my wife, daughter and 
four cats.  I have no room to do any more cidermaking, meadmaking, 
winemaking, or brewing.  I need a job so that we can afford a larger place!

John Brett raises the issue of water addition to juice from the belt washing
system on belt presses. Voran have carried out tests to determine the water
addition to juice from the belt washing system.  When the belt washer is used
continuously there is an addition of less than 1%.  This should not have
a noticeable effect on juice quality. Most of our belt press users started
with pack presses and they have not mentioned dilution of juice as a problem.


It is generally accepted that juice made by a belt press contains more
particles than that from a pack press but, again, this is not a particularly
serious issue.  With regard to the quality of juice and the finished product,
whether 'hard' cider or unfermented juice, there seems no difference between
the two systems: those makers who won prizes with products made with their
old pack press continue to win prizes with products made with a belt press.
It all boils down to the quality of the fruit and the skill of the producer.


The control systems on belt presses can give problems but this will depend
on the type of press and the system employed.  The later Voran belt
presses use pneumatic belt direction controls and, as long as the air
supply is kept clean and dry, these have proved reliable and efficient.
Belt presses have come some way in the last few years.

CD #1312 John Brett had three concerns of belt presses


1. Pulpy Juice - While a little pulp may flow out of the resulting juice.  I
send my juice through a very tight SS mesh screen before it hits the tank.
I have know comparable losses. Keep in mind my only other experience is with
a R&C.


2. Belt Saturation - We have done a fair bit of extra work on our part to
mitigate this problem.  While I can not deny that some saturation may occur.
We have programmed our wash boxes to turn on when we decide.  We can choose
between one to twelve revolutions before the washer turns on.  the washer
will only run for one revolution and stop automatically. Only one box will
run at any one time. Plus,  belts run through a set of roller ringers and a
squeegee before being reintroduced to pulp.  Water is attractive to things
and some saturation is inevitable. However, I have never tried to quantify
this.  I am more than satisfied with the quality of resulting juice. We have
had no complaints from our customers either.


3. Press alignment.  This is never a problem if the pistons are in working
order.  Check for leaks in pneumatic lines.  If they are not pushing as a
team it can be frustrating.  Cake thickness plays a role in this too.


I would definitely say that there is a  larger learning curve to operating a
belt press.

Answering a question Claude sent me regarding my cider press

Yes, I use two jacks to get the full stroke in one squeeze without 
having to reset the jacks or add blocking/cribbing. My pressure 
calculations are based on a single twenty ton rating, since you are 
right in that I only get one jack to squeeze at a time.  Alignment of 
the rising press box is a bit of a concern but actually is easily 
manageable.  I press down with the upper jack first which sort of 
'locks' the cheeses in place, then squeeze upward with the lower jack.  
A couple of seconds spent lining it up at the beginning and it's a 
pretty easy squeeze.  The shop press idea makes a very simple and 
effective press; now if there were a good, cheap, clean, and efficient 
grinder out there for the DIY folks...

Subject: Judges & Entries Needed, 13th Annual BUZZ Off June 3rd
From: "Christopher Clair" <buzzclub@verizon.net>
Date: Wed, 05 Apr 2006 23:07:14 -0400


Brewers Unlimited Zany Zymurgists (BUZZ) is proud to announce that the 13th
annual BUZZ Off home brew competition will be held on Saturday, June 3rd at
Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant in West Chester, PA.  For another year we
will be a qualifying event for the prestigious Masters Championship of
Amateur Brewing (MCAB) as well as the Delaware Valley Homebrewer of the
Year.  All BJCP recognized styles (2004 guidelines) including meads and
ciders are eligible for entry. Our hope is to get enough cider entries so
that we can have a separate prize category for them.  For complete details
and forms, please visit the BUZZ web site at http://hbd.org/buzz.


Entries will be accepted between May 13th and May 26th.  For drop off and
mail in locations please refer to the BUZZ web site.  Please, do not mail
entries to Iron Hill.


BJCP Judges and stewards will be needed. If you are interested please
contact me or another committee member (contact information can be found on
the web site). All judges must be BJCP certified (any ranking).


Good luck and cheers!

Subject: Hooray for NY Fresh Cider- Senate Bill 6295
From: "Mike Beck" <mjbeck@ujcidermill.com>

Those of you that live & cider in New York.


Legislation is being passed around the Senate that can maintain the
availability of fresh unpasteurized cider.  This would overturn a earlier
ruling, mandating that all cider be treated to the 5-log kill.
(pasteurization)


Senator DeFrancisco is the bills major sponsor. If you live and cider in NY
and want access to fresh unpasteurized cider or want to be able to sell it
please call your senator and tell him you support Senator DeFrancisco. They
are seeking support and education on cider.


There is a big fight in front of them. Help if you can.


Sorry to use the CD as a political platform.  I know this is about juice,
anybody that wants to make good cider from local fresh juice, this will at
least make it legal for you to do so.

When I was looking at the Voran belt presses in use in England, trying to
gather whatever I could about the design, I kinda went through the
following thinking...


stainless frame and housing, yeah of course.  big stainless rollers, yeah
probably expensive to make but no big deal.  bearings taking a lot of side
force, a solved problem.  pneumatics for tensioning, fine.  a bunch of
moderately interesting mechanical engineering...
Now, about the belt...whoa!  There is the magic!  Has to be just the right
porosity, flexible but not very stretchy, etc., etc.  I could see all sorts
of tradeoffs and design challenges...at least that's what it seemed to me,
and I wonder if poor belt design accounts for the reports of variable/poor
quality juice.
