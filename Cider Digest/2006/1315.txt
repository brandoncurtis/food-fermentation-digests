I would think the ML was still active. That temp is low enough, in my
experience, to prolong the process significantly. You should see it
start to clarify some, then can try fining.


Do I remember that the classic French method of egg-white fining for red
wines tends to reduce tannin, and was, in fact, dependent on their
presence? Wouldn't that work here, at least after the ML has completed?
My memory is that the process involves whipping the whites (only),
adding them to the container, stirring vigorously, settling for a day or
two, then racking off the top. I think the reduction in tannins is
accomplished largely electrostatically (charged egg white ions
attracting oppositely charged tannin ions)? And some of the fining is
accomplished that way, as well, with most of the rest of the effect
being mechanical, with the beaten white essentially forming a protein
"mesh," slightly heavier than liquid and insoluble, that settles to the
bottom, dragging with it any crud that has been either attracted or
captured. I think that was the theory at the time, anyway.


I looked into this at one point when our wine group was doing largish
quantities of red wine (200-400 gal), but we decided we really didn't
need it, so bottled unfiltered/unfined. But that's been a dozen years
ago or better.

omission?  or change in policy?!
BUZZ Off has required BJCP cert for judges for a number of years, a fact
which had caused a few grumbles in the cider (and mead) worlds.  If that's
just changed, it's a good thing since it opens the possibility of "specialty"
judges who can do justice to cider under the newer style guidelines (and
also help their fellow judges understand some of the finer points).


When will you be able to announce who the judges are?  That might make a
difference to some potential entrants--that is, the difference between
allowing or inviting non-BJCP judges -vs- actually getting them.  I think
if you had even one judge who's recognized in the cider community, you
might pull a lot more cider entries.

I'd like to plant a small apple orchard (around a dozen trees) in my
yard and include varieties just for cider, along with my favorites for
eating and baking.  I live in NY, prime apple country, and would like to
learn more. Who out there can provide some info?  I've looked into this
a little and have read about the common cider apples (Kingston
Black,Dabinett, Fox Whelp, Michelin...) but I'd like to hear from
cidermakers who have some first hand experience in this.
