Newbie: I applaud your spirit but you should remember that even though 
you are not heating your cider you are still producing "distilled 
spirits" within the meaning of 27 CFR Section 1 subpart C, which is 
prohibited unless you have a permit... but of course you knew that.

Regarding Dick Dunn's question about suckering and scion varieties: 
M.7 tends to produce a lot of suckers on most apple varieties.  With 
time, you will probably see them on all the other varieties as well 
as Major and HM Jersey.  The depth of planting also has an effect 
(deeper roots tend to produce fewer suckers, so it could be related 
to the length of the rootstock shanks (shorter) when you grafted 
those two scion varieties, or perhaps you planted them with the 
budunion higher above the ground than the others.  Most commercial 
growers have quit planting trees on M.7 because it is such a hassle 
cutting out those suckers every summer.  For a similar sized tree 
with few suckers, that also brings the scion into production several 
years sooner than M.7, you might want to consider G.30 or MM.106 
rootstocks instead.  Many of the cider orchards in Western Europe are 
planted on MM.106, and it seems to work very will with those 
varieties on well drained soils with relatively long growing seasons 
(maritime climates).

Tim,


I'm sure you've gotten a few comments from your Cider Digest post, but
I'll put in my two-bits.


Your process outline is basically correct, though it glosses over many
fine details.


BUT...,


1) Cultivar selection.  The more, the merrier.  Use LOTS of varieties.
And picking sweet varieties will NOT yield a sweeter [fermented] cider.
Simple fact of cider - the yeast eat all the sugar and leave it dry.
There are, of course, exceptions - see the fine details.


2) Applejack is not exactly healthful, nor is it legal.  Fractional
crystalization concentrates all non-water components in cider, including
natural, but unhealthy, chemicals.  This differs from distilling (also
illegal to do at home) that concentrates all the components near the
boiling point of alcohol. The practical upshot is that a lot of calvados
(cider brandy) will get you hung-over, but a lot of applejack will
literally give you palsy.


If you're really looking to make something sweet and more alcoholic than
simple [hard] cider, try pommeau.  Pommeau is a blend of the fresh juice
(or sweet cider) and cider brandy.  Aim for 18-20% alcohol after
blending, and let it sit a couple of months in a carboy with an airlock
(like normal wine/cider) before you bottle it.


Best of luck with custom pressing.  Getting unpasteurized cider is
trickier than it used to be, and custom pressing, as you describe, is
illegal in most states (again with the fine print thing).  Ohio is not
one of the liberal states when it comes to this.  Some pressers are
moving to UV treatment, which is at least non-thermal - and cheaper than
running the cider through a water-jet steel cutter at 80,000psi, which
is another non-thermal '5-log kill' anti-microbial process.

My take on Dick's situation ["(a) I didn't see this sort of suckering on 
ANYthing other than Major and HMJ, but (b) I didn't see it on absolutely 
every instance of those two."]


different rootstocks are more prone to root suckering [EMLA-7 is noted 
for it, deeper planting usually lessens the suckering tendencies], and 
if the grafted variety is much less vigorous than the root stock, root 
suckering is more likely - the fact that some of the noted varieties 
didn't sucker might indicate exceptional vigor for those particular 
trees, or it may indicate the trees that are suckering, have suffered 
some set back, like winter kill, or those particular trees didn't get 
planted as deep as the others!


also, you may want to evaluate your soil there, or fertilizers you've 
used may be too high in N, forcing more foliage growth than the 
varieties can produce, or in P and K which encourage root growth

I didn't interpret Dick's BUZZ comment to Kevin Pratt as vitriolic or an 
attack or berating or a vent or a dare.

Subject: Re: Cider Digest #1316, 'scion specific suckering
From: Stephen Wood <swood@farnumhillciders.com>

An apple tree will sucker according to its own perceived need, and its 
own predilections.  M7 suckers by nature, but any root will sucker if 
the scion doesn't please it, or if the graft union is insufficient (by 
the root's judgment).  This often has to do with the cultivars 
(rootstock and top), but it sometimes has to do with sharpness of knife 
and skill.


Major is mighty vigorous --  I wonder whether you have a graft-union 
problem? In any event, M7 and EMLA7 love to throw root suckers.   I've 
never had Major on 7, but I've topworked it (to other varieties, and to 
the rootstck itself)  on 106, 111, and 104 (blast from the distant 
past) -- always compatible, always vigorous, never root/base suckers. 
I've also planted Major on 111 -- wicked vigorous; no suckers.  HMJ 
isn't quite so mighty in New Hampshire, but once it starts, it rocks. 
I've topworked it to an unknown (recommended but useless) cider variety 
on both 106 and 111, and to a 30-year-old Mac tree on M106 , and I've 
planted a few hundred trees on 111.  Not particularly precocious, 
upright habit with clear apical dominance, but no suckers.


Sorry, this probably ain't much help.

Subject: more about gelatin (for fining)
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>
Date: Wed, 26 Apr 2006 23:40:49 -0600


Reacting to Andrew's recent article concerning gelatin fining, I noted that
he'd inveighed against "Jello", and wondered if his caution would apply to
simple unflavored gelatin (without flavoring and/or sweetener), such as
what's used for kitchen purposes (mousses, aspics, etc).  His reply was:


|No I really do mean what I say. Grocery store gelatin will *not* do. 
|There are various reasons for this but it is partly to do with the 
|isoelectric point which needs to be high and therefore should be 
|prepared by acid hydrolysis (type A). Most food grade gelatins are type 
|B (alkaline hydrolysis). Also the Bloom strength (gelling power) needs 
|to be low for fining whereas by necessity most grocery gelatins go for a 
|high Bloom strength. Gelatin chemistry is hugely complex (I have met up 
|with it both for beverage fining and for confectionery work) and I do 
|not even pretend to be an expert but I know enough to know that the 
|correct grade must be used for winemaking.  People like Erbsloeh (and 
|thence Vigo as agents) sell the correct grade in Europe. They even sell 
|a low Bloom liquid gelatin which is enzymically prepared (not 
|hydrolysed) and has no gelling power at all. I don't know what's 
|available in the US but surely winemaking suppliers must have the 
|correct grade.


After that, I wondered whether gelling power would be a rough indication
(one that could be tested in the kitchen, for example) of whether one has
the right sort of gelatin.  Andrew replied:


|Interesting thought. Certainly worth a try and if the gel is weak under 
|'standard' kitchen gelling conditions it would imply you've got the 
|right stuff for fining.  But the converse might not be true.  Lack of 
|gelling power is not the only criterion - conceivably a gelatin of the 
|right iso-electric properties and lack of lower molecular weight 
|peptides (I didn't mention that before) might still gel reasonably...


(Part of his point is that if a gelatin is weak in gelling power,
presumably it was prepared for some other purpose.  However, a strong-
gelling gelatin could still be suitable for fining.)


I tested a brew-shop gelatin described as "100 bloom type B" for gelling
power and found it to be rather inferior but not useless for gelling
(which, per above, suggests it's intended for some other purpose, to the
point, fining).  I'm curious whether other folks have fiddled with gelatin
fining and have discerned any fine points which Andrew's notes have
anticipated.

I got a handful of off-list responses, so I'll plan on a general response
to those plus whatever's on-list, in the next digest.  It all covers a
bunch of topics which are interesting if you're making your own trees, but
not necessarily relevant to cider specifically, so I'll try to grind it
down to the basics.  Some of the considerations include rootstock tendency
to sucker, graft quality, scion vigor, planting depth...whew!!  I am VERY
glad for the resources of this list (even if a bit overwhelmed just at the
moment)!
