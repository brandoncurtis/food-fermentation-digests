Your loyal janitor is back on duty; the digest resumes.  I thank you for
your patience if you were patient.  If you weren't, I'm sorry; I should
have a better backup arrangement for the digest when I'm gone.


Your janitor's alter-ego is trying to get un-jet-lagged and caught up
with worldly matters, after which he should have some postings about
the UK cider scene.

This year I added commercial yeasts to my keeved ciders for the first 
time since my mil was brand new and I didn't think I'd have much 
inoculum built up.  I used different amounts and strains in different 
batches, and added them according to Gary Awdey's 2006 protocol where it 
was suggested to add just a couple of grains just prior to the keeve. Of 
all four batches I got varying results:


1. Blend of Steve Wood's bittersweets & Liberty, K-1V 1116 
(http://morewinemaking.com/product.html?product_id=16456) yeast.  
Beautiful keeve, like picture perfect. Long, slow ferment that dropped 
clear at 1.010. No off-flavor.
2. Different bled of Wood's bittersweets & Liberty, W 15 yeast 
(http://morewinemaking.com/product.html?product_id=16499).  Dropped 
clear at 1.020 with no off-flavors.
3. Blend of 1&2 above, both yeasts.  Really nice keeve, ferment stopped 
and cleared at 1.032.  Will blend with some drier stuff at bottling/kegging.
4. "N. American' Keeve: Liberty/Haralson/Spy/Gold Del/Pinova, poor 
bottom keeve with less than optimal separation.  Added pinch of R-2 
(http://morewinemaking.com/product.html?product_id=16502) yeast.  Two 
different carboys fermented differently, going down to 1.040 and 
1.050after three months, much higher than all other ciders.  Aroma was 
downright nasty with sulfur and egg.  Added Red Star Premier Cuvee Yeast 
pack and 1 tsp 'yeast nutrient' (not sure of exact ingredients).  Last 
readings were 1.010 and 1.028 respectively. The sulfur stench seems to 
be aging/metabolising out pretty well.


So I have fingered the specific yeast strain (R-2) as my main problem 
this season, although I am looking to get back away from commercial 
yeasts altogether again in the coming years. I do think that judicious 
nutrient use and a switch to a more neutral yeast may have saved my last 
batch.  In previous years where I have used wild yeasts, with and 
without keeving, I have found the ciders to ferment clean, with little 
off-aromas.

Yeah, I'd avoid that.


Hope that helps,

Subject: Pear ripening - technical question

This is one for the technical folks.


I've been doing to GC analysis of, well, an intermediate material used
in my pommeau and poirissimo production.
I found that the pear fermentation had ended up with _17_times_ the
methanol level of the apple.  Now, it's still under the legal limit
(barely) - but it still seems like a big difference.  There is also a
big difference in a peak that I think, but haven't confirmed, may be
ethyl acetate.


Now, I suspect that naturally occuring PME, or other pectin-related
enzymes did this.   These pears (Bartlett) were left to sweat _way_ too
long.  They were mush (albeit, very aromatic mush) by pressing time.
Does this seem likely?  Would that also explain an elevated ethyl
acetate level (or that just pears for you)? Both were fermented with KV1
(I seem to recall), and neither with added pectolytic enzymes.  The pear
ferment generated an extremely tall foam cap - > 9inches, where I
normally see less than 3 inches on a 550 gallon tank).


Has anyone taken a detailed look at what happens to these trace
components with sweating time?

I don't have the direct experience that you ask for, but sterilized  
bone meal is cheap and should provide the phosphorus you need much  
more simply.


See http://www.the-organic-gardener.com/shrub-fertilizer.html


Or are you looking to whole bones so they will break down over a  
longer period?  Bones last a long time in the soil unless it's quite  
acid, and I wonder how much phosphorus they'd release per year.  I'd  
think that top dressing the trees with bone meal every few years  
would be easy enough.


You could also use rock phosphate when planting, which breaks down  
more slowly than bone meal.
