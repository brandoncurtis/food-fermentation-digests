Dick, Gary


The notes & tips are great and I will come in handy when I can make my own
trip.  Round Trips from Detroit to Heathrow are reasonable in winter.


When I can make the trip I would like to bring home as much cider as
possible.  How much can you carry? Can you ship any back? Or is this all to
much hassle to bother with.


Please keep em coming, all info is good.... lodges, taverns, B&B's, dining,
transportation, markets, and of course cideries.

I know there was some discussion last fall regarding iced cider. I'm
interested if anyone has made it from  juice as most of our apples are
varieties that do not stay on the tree long enough to freeze, and we
also do not currently have a press that coudl handle frozen apples even
if they were the right varieties! I'd be interested in hearing from
anyone who has attempted to make iced cider, either from juice or apples
as I'm going to try it out this harvest.

Thanks for that clarification about the US position Steve. Of course
high levels of copper bring their own problems of metal catalysed
oxidation and browning so only the bare minimum (< 0.5 ppm) should be
used. Incidentally the reason that ascorbate can be useful is because if
the stink is due to a dialkyl sulfide containing a sulfur-sulfur bridge,
this has to be broken first before the copper will combine with the
resulting mono-alkyl sulfide.  A problem is that there a number of
different (though related) sources of sulfur stink and they are not all
just simple H2S (hydrogen sulfide). Hence small test trials are
essential before deciding to treat an entire batch. As Steve says, most
good professional winemaking textbooks contain details on all this in
the context of white wines. An example is Wine Analysis and Production
by Bruce Zoecklein et al - incidentally in that book they mention the
deliberate choice of brass fittings in wineries in order to eliminate
sulfur stinks!

The (still developing) Craft Cider Network site at cider.appletrue.com
was cracked last week and had to have it's plug pulled.


It will be restored when the security hole is plugged, and I can gather
the energy to face restoring the site with the latest and greatest code
(which is otherwise making great progress in usability).


Praise be to crackers and other vandals, great heros of the Net, they
are.

If you're considering a trip to the UK to visit cidermakers, and you're
planning to drive, as I mentioned in an earlier note you should be well-
prepared to understand the roads and the rules.  I had the following note
from Alex Hill at Vigo...Vigo is a manufacturer/supplier of a lot of
equipment for cidermaking.  They are in Devon, near Honiton (look it up
please).  Alex wrote:

This is a very kind offer; please don't abuse it.  Alex may be reached as
alex@vigoltd.com


I should say that if you are planning to visit Vigo, you REALLY should know
the rules of the road in the UK as they differ considerably from the US,
and Vigo are substantially far from directly on a stop on the tube!!  If
you visit them you will have a few driving challenges.
The "Highway Code" is the government-printed description of rules and
regulations for driving in the UK.  It is concise and clear.


Also, I'll add more detail on Vigo in a later note, but the Vigo showroom
is well worth a visit.  You'll see at least one thing you wish you had.
