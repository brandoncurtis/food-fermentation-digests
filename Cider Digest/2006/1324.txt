Melissa,


While my interests don't really cover 'intensified cider' (as I call
it), I use frozen juice every year with success - both thawed to
original strength, and skimmed of ice for intensification.


I routinely boost pear juice from 9 Brix to 16 Brix.  That is very easy
to accomplish.  In my case, I freeze in 50 gallon drums, and get the 16
brix juice by pushing a hose to the bottom of the drum when about 3/4
thawed and pumping out from under the remaining ice.


With more time and patience, I know people intensify juice to well over
30 Brix.


If you're a US commercial cidery, it's not legal to call this
intensified must an 'ice cider'.  The TTB sticks to the ice wine
parameters (frozen pressing after frozen harvest), which is tighter than
even the Canadian gov't allows for ice cider (frozen pressing after
in-season harvest and cold-storage). The public posting of this is in an
old ATF industry circular:
http://www.ttb.gov/publications/alctob_pub/at_news/oct_2002/page3.htm


Which doesn't address apples.  Anecdotal evidence suggests some agents
at the AFLD (Labeling and Formulation Division) seem to say 'no ice
cider label, period' (since the ruling addresses grapes) and some seem
to say ' it's got to at least match what's done with grapes'.  Your
milage may vary.
