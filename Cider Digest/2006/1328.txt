Subject: Rose hips?

Forgive the ignorance of my question.  Are rose hips simply the rose petals?
Do you use the entire bulb, or is it something else.   I live in NYC, Roses
are anywhere from 20 to 90 bucks a dozen.
   I have seen in herb/tea stores, what look like tiny dried roses to be
used for tea.  Would they be the same thing?  thanks.

Visiting England in October


I will be taking a trip to England in late October.  I will have time to
visit orchards, cider mills, cider festivals, cider makers.  Does anyone
have suggestions for where-who I might visit?


Thanks,

RE: Kathy
I made my wine/cider using small hard hips from a wild scrambling rose
(maybe the same as yours?) - maybe Rosa canina, though I'm not entirely
sure.  There wasn't much flesh on these, but if you can get enough it is
worth it (this is easy, as so many are usually produced!) It is essential
to chop these up quite well but as to whether the seeds can be chopped I
am not sure.  Jack Keller pretty much explains all, if a little briefly.
They are nice eaten on their own provided you don't eat the hairy stuff that
surrounds the seeds - apparently this will irritate your mouth like crazy.
Until your apple trees eventually(?)  grow, I would definitely seriously
consider rose hips.
 They have often been used for jams and jellies, though perhaps the more
fleshy hips from such roses as Rosa rugosa would be more suitable for this.
BUT, first and foremost, make this wine!


RE: Charles


I have always fantasised about buying a few Mespilus germanica (Medlar)
trees to make a medieval style cider type drink.  Now that you have
mentioned this ancient fruit, I am more tempted than ever to go order some!
As for Hawthorn, I have eaten a few berries from the native shrub over here
in England and thought they lacked flavour, but having said that, a lot of
cider apples don't seem to taste of much and yet once fermented, magically
turn into nectar of the gods.  Have you ever tried a fermented Medlar drink?


RE: Bob


Interesting about the antioxidant status - would that make rose hips
some kind of a "superfruit" do you reckon?  High in Vitamin C and high in
antioxidants...sounds perfect to me!  Which rosehips do you use by the way?

In CD # 1327 Warwick asked if any cider makers were using lysozyme:


We tried using lysozyme (aka lactizyme) in our ciders this year with very
good results.  It is a naturally occurring enzyme which is extracted from
egg whites.  It destroys the cell walls of gram positive bacteria.  It is
highly effective at inhibiting malo-lactic fermentation as well as other
types of bacterial spoilage.  We found it to have little effect on flavor,
though it lightened color slightly.  It is deactivated with bentonite.
The folks at Scott Labs were very helpful and available to answer questions
on how to use the product.

There was some rumor that they were going to register some of the old perry 
pear trees as a sort of heritage tree.  Did this ever happen?  Did any of 
the pear trees pictured in Luckwill & Pollard's book (and being identified 
as being on the Long Ashton grounds) survive or did they just get bulldozed 
like the buildings?


Thanks

In a closed bottle, if there is any equilibrium free SO2 gas in the
headspace, this will be vented in seconds as soon as the bottle is
opened and the cider poured.  Otherwise, sulphite in cider doesn't
really evaporate because the majority of it is in the salt form, or it's
bound up to fermentation carbonyls like acetaldehyde.  If there is any
free dissolved sulphite present, it will however eventually oxidise
(sulphite to sulphate). This reaction is slow and probably takes several
days full air exposure. By this time the cider will not be very nice anyway.


> Or are there any other ways to get rid of it ?


You can get rid of it instantly by adding hydrogen peroxide. However you
have to measure the exact level of free SO2 before you start and then
add just the correct stoichiometric calculated amount of peroxide. So,
not really a practical proposition outside of a lab!  Also any side
reactions of peroxide would probably lead to some rather unpleasant
flavours. Oxidised cider does not taste very nice.


Are you sure the odour you detect is really SO2?  There seem to be lots
of other yeast-derived sulphurous odours found in cider which are
naturally occuring but which are little understood.
