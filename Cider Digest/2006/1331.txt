Ray and Shawn and others,


Thanks very much for the UK cider visiting suggestions.  I'll be making my
plans during the next couple of months.  I will  send in a report of my
adventures when I return to the states in November.


Best regards,


John Bunker

For those who don't follow competitions but might be interested the Indy
International Wine Competition was held July 27-29.  The competition web
page describes it as a conjunction of the Indiana State Fair with Purdue
University's enology and computer science programs.  It has divisions for
both commercial and amateur entries and has been running since 1992.  There
are quite a number of categories of classic red and white wines and of fruit
wines (which include cider and perry under the scheme of classification used
by the competition).  The lengthy list of entries recognized with awards may
be found at
http://www.indianawines.org/media/iwc/Taste%20of%20Indiana%20Awards%20Book.pdf.
The following partial list of commercial results (for entries that include
apple or pear in one form or another) may be of more immediate interest to
cider folks.  Take note of the several awards (including gold medals) won by
AEppelTreow Winery (one of the owners, Charles McGonegal, has been a
frequent contributor to the Cider Digest) and Uncle John's Fruit House
Winery (Mike Beck has also been an active contributor this past year).
Congratulations to both wineries, as well as other wineries and individuals
recognized with awards.


Also, in anticipation of the question arising, "NV" refers to a non-vintage
(ie a blend from more than one year's harvest, or perhaps that the producer
chose not to identify the year)

Subject: Rates for custom pressing
From: Donald Davenport <djdavenport@earthlink.net>

With my pack press about finished, (and with the yield from my young
orchard likely to be processed in a day or two) I've been kicking
around the notion of offering the cider press for some custom work.
Lots and lots of backyard orchards in Santa Fe.  No small pressing
operations nearby that I could find (hence, the need to build my own.)
I rather imagine I'd get quite a few takers.


I really have no idea what to charge or how to structure the service.
(Does a client need to pre-wash his/her apples, for example?)  Is it
charged by the hour?  By the bushel (with some kind of minimum)?
Should I consider offering anything in addition to the basic pressing
service?  Containers?


And what about any liability issues?  Do any of you do anything to
protect yourselves against the kid that gets the flu and his parents
claim its really ecoli from your press?


Granted, I'm talking really small scale.  But if I could make enough to
keep me in cider-making supplies, meet some interesting people, take a
modest write-off for some of the expenses, it'd probably be worth it.


Or am I opening a really nasty can of worms?


Thanks for any advice.


Best,


Don Davenport

Has anyone used or seen a Fitzpatrick FITZMILL used for grinding apples?
They are a fair bit more expensive than a Bell hammer mill, just wondering
if they are worth it.
