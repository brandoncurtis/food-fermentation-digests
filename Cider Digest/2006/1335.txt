In a couple of weeks I will have access to a quantity of Luscious 
pear, which is a South Dakota E31 X Ewart cross. I have no prior 
experience with this variety but I assume, since it is a dessert 
pear, it might benefit from some blending to give it some more 
character. I have some Dolgo crab available ,too, and I'm wondering 
if a percentage addition of those might be helpful? If not the Dolgo, 
I can also adjust with powdered grape tannin and acid blend . Any 
thoughts on those additions and amounts per 5 gal. batch, or should I 
stick with pure fruit additions instead? I could back blend with some 
of last season's frozen apple cider that had good tannins and 
balanced acid.


This will also be my first attempt at a pressing with some new equipment , a
304 ss, 13 gal. capacity, ratchet driven grape press. The ss basket 
is perforated with thousands of 1/8 " holes and the pressure from the 
rachet drive should be considerable. I'm upgrading from an ancient 
wooden apple press with a simple, weak, screw drive. Anybody out 
there ever use this ss press for apples or pears?


I plan on ripening the pears for a week or so after harvest to 
maximize sugar and yield . What should I expect to get in gal. / 
bushel? I guessed about 2 or
2 1/2 gal. / bushel.


Thanks for any advice.


Brad

What is the current opinion on whether it's acceptable to have 
pulverized seeds in the pomace?


I'm using the infamous "Yellman Grinder" (a stainless steel disposal) 
and it does a great job, but it doesn't discriminate about what it 
grinds, seeds and all.


Since I have to at least half most of the apples to get them to fit in 
the throat of the grinder, I could certainly take the extra step and 
quarter them and take out the core.  (That's easy now since my orchard 
is still young.  Not sure if it'll seem so appealing when [hopefully] 
I'm processing a lot more.)


Off flavors?  Cyanide?  Thumbs up or thumbs down?


Thanks,

I'm still looking for any sort of fermented pear products to take across the 
pond for a perry gathering in a few weeks.


Thus if you are commerically making any sort of pear cider or know if anyone 
that is, please drop me a note.  If it's a winery and in a wine bottle 
that's fine too...  I want some range of good products.


This is free advertising folks....

I've recently come into a copy of something billed as a 'Bulmer's
Pomona', which is certainly not the centenniary celebration book.


It bears no publication date, and is titled internally (different from
the cover) as 'The Revival of Cider'.  It has no publication date, but
reads like a mid-19th century text.  It does make some references to the
twentieth century - but no dates.


It's a riot to read - a tour de force of flowery language devoted to the
promotion of Herefordshire (the sider-shire), cider and HP Bulmers.


Anyone have more details on its origin?

I was able to take a few pictures of the piston pump I mentioned in digest 
1333.  There are a few parts missing mainly the motor, piston, and a couple 
of disks.  I spoke with the original owner who has been out of the cider 
business for a while.  He said the pump was not homemade but manufactured by 
goodnature.  He said the pump worked pretty good as long as you had the 2 
disks inside the pump lined up correctly.  he could not remember how the 
disks worked or fit in the pump except that one disk had a hole in the 
center and they had to be removed to clean the pump.  The pictures I took
can be seen at:

Maybe someone out there knows more about these pumps?  I forgot 
my tape measure but I may have been incorrect when I said it was 4" PVC I 
think it is probably about 6" in diameter.
