Bradley and Caitlin,


In Lebanon NH you'll find Farnum Hill Ciders by Poverty Lane Orchards
(Owners Steve Wood and Louisa Spencer, and Cidermaker Nicole Leibon).
These folks make a half dozen styles of fine fermented english variety
fermented ciders.  I am tempted to say New England variety, being a
prideful New Englander, but the heirloom varieties they use are mostly
rare grafted and planted cider variety imports from the old world.
The product is similar to a light alcohol content dry white wine or
champagne, depending on how it's finished, but also with the very
unique dry cider flavors... which are excellent with just about any
imagineable harvest season meal this time of year.


I visited their orchard two weeks ago and was treated to an orchard
tour and tasting even in the midst of their busiest time of year.
Cidermaking was just ramping up in mid-Sept.  An early Oct visit would
probably find the folks there in full bore harvesting and cider
production, which would make a visit all the more enjoyable.


Regards,


Dave
Seattle, WA

Subject: Perry Pears, and tree grafting

Long time listener, first time caller.
I just read Chris Horns note on Perry pears and his trip to the Perry
Pear Presidium.  Thanks, Chris, that was quite interesting.
This month I hosted the Primetime Brewer's first (hopefully annual) hog
roast and Pear Pressing.  One of our sponsors, Siciliano's Market, was
gracious enough to loan us the use of his apple grinder and fruit press.
After a few hours behind the crank, I think we'll put together a grinder
of our own...Anyway, we collected 5 varieties of pear, some juicy
Bartlett's from a farmer's market, a bushel or so of Stark Bro.
Honey....Sweets, I think, from a club members yard,  a few bushels from
a neighbor's tree...(Maybe Bosc?) as well as a bushel from a wild tree
in the ditch down the road, and a peck or so from a tree in the outlawn
at the facility I work at in Grand Haven.  Interesting little pears,
about 1" in diameter, and very tannic.  The first taste you get is a
quick burst of pear flavor, then tannins that make your mouth pucker up
like Paris Hilton on a first date.  We did have one club member eat
several, claiming they were quite tasty, although nobody else found them
the slightest bit palatable.
Anyway, we pressed about 15 gallons of juice, portioned it out into 3
gallon quantities for the participants, and we are all doing our own
separate thing with the juice.
I've made a lot of hard cider in the past, and this is my first attempt
at a Perry.  I'm looking forward to the results.  Another of my hobbies
is tree grafting (check my website).  I grafted 50 apple trees this
winter, and had a lot of success.  85% at last count.
I plan to graft more this winter, as well as grafting some pears.  I
definitely want to graft some of the Grand Haven Tannics...Sounds like a
minor league hockey team, doesn't it...and whatever else I can get my
hands on.
What rootstock would anybody recommend for grafting wild pears?  Quince?

On the last digest, Roy Bailey suggests using a level teaspoon of sugar
per gallon of juice for priming. This season is the first time i have
tried priming. I used 3/4 cup per five gallons, which is approximately
1/7 of a cup of sugar per gallon.  I got this figure from a book about
all kinds of wine making and brewing, so I was never certain that the
suggested measurement applied well to cider.  Roy's suggestion to use a
much smaller quantity of priming sugar has me thinking I may have
overdone it. Is there a reason I should be scared to handle the
champagne bottles I have been using with the amount of sugar that I used
for priming?


Thanks,
Craig Teerlink

Has anyone ever taken Peter Mitchell's Cider Making course?  I was thinking
of attending, but it seems expensive, and I was hoping to get some feed
back.


I'm also looking for a couple of cider books: J.M. Trowbridge's The Cider
Makers Handbook, and a translation of Warcollier's The Principles and
Practices of Cider Making.  Any leads?


Thanks,

(comparable note appears on Mead-Lover's Digest...read one.  Not so much of
a problem here, but I wanted to say something while it's quiet.)


Please, if you're announcing a competition here, plan to limit yourselves
to no more than TWO announcements for any given event.  I suggest you post
one well in advance and one close to the entry deadline.


You need to realize that (1) the digest is worldwide, so a lot of folks
couldn't enter even if they wanted to, and (2) a lot of people have no
interest in competitions even if they -could- enter.  So you've got a
limited audience.


I'll start checking competition announcements after this and I'll enforce
the two-notice rule.
