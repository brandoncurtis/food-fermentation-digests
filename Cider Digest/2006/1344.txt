Sorry to bug everyone around the world.


I'm looking for advice for starting a small cider orchard
in the Pacific NW US (south-eastern Washington).


What varieties would you recommend? What is easy
to grow and can be sprayed (local requirement)?


I can plant up to an acre or so.  Soil is so-so; remnants
of glacial run-off and volcanism.  But, nearby orchards look
plenty healthy with only some irrigation and normal
pesticide spraying.  Climate is zone 5, I think.


I did ask local orchardists but they know consumer
apple growing, not cider trees.  And I never got email
back from the WSU agent.

James-
Thanks for the info on pear rootstock.  I've always gotten good info
from you.  Here's another question:
I read somewhere that you can  eliminate viruses from wild scion wood by
using 170F heat.  The article I read did not say when or for how long,
and I can't find the reference now.  Any ideas on how to disinfect wild
wood?  I have a few wild pears in my area I'd like to start grafting.

We are going to try malt sugar for priming of our apple cider this year.
Does anyone have a recommendation on how much we should use per gallon to
get a champagn style fizz?


Any opinions on malt sugar vs cane sugar for priming?


Pax Vobiscum,
David

All the responses to my comments on priming sugar overlooked one
important fact - nowhere in David Blakely's original enquiry did he
mention champagne bottles. I assumed from his comments that he was
thinking of carbonating a barrel or cask, or ordinary wine or screw-cap
bottles.


My advice was based on my experience of bottle conditioning beer, or
producing a gentle petillance in ordinary (i.e. non-champagne) bottles
of cider. I don't like my bottles to foam out all over the floor when I
open them. I would never, as Dick Dunn suggests, use a teaspoonful per
bottle. That would produce an organic Molotov Cocktail!


Of course champagne bottles are designed to take much greater pressures,
but even so, too much sugar will result in something like the bottles
that idiotic racing drivers spray all over their fans.


Two further points. Mention has been made of a 'cup', which doesn't seem
to be a very precise measure. And I hope that David will come back and
explain how he gets 14% alcohol by fermenting just apple juice - even if
it does come from William Rendel Hearst's former residence!


Roy.

Subject: re-using wild yeast
From: lawrenceww@earthlink.net
Date: Fri, 13 Oct 2006 16:27:03 -0500 (GMT-05:00)


I've heard that wild yeasts are hit or miss when it comes to naturally
fermented cider.  I'm about to make a batch this weekend and was wondering
if it does turn out good can I capture the yeast and keep it as a culture
to re-use for another batch?  Homebrewers re-use the yeast cake from the
primary fermenter for consecutive batches and it seems they have good results
with it.  has anyone done this with cider or kept an active yeast culture?


Thanks,
Lawrence

I've heard of tractor mounted silage blowers running down every other row
in an orchard blowing the "drops" from under the trees for ease of
harvest. Recently, I saw a tractor mounted leaf blower and wondered if
that would work or even something smaller like landscapers use. Has this
been tried already?

I've heard of briner's grade calcium chloride (food grade) added to water
in order to float pears. Never tried it, guess you'd tinker with the
concentration. Thing is, apples float pears don't. Just don't add so much
CaCl2 that you float the stones.

Subject: starting a commerical cidery

My husband and I are in the process of taking over operations and ownership
of his family's 40 acre apple orchard. We are seriously considering
starting a commercial cidery as there is an explosion of wine tourism in
our region (Okanagan, BC) and let's face it  - fresh fruit really is not
overly profitable these days! This year we are focused on the business
plan and market research, with the next several years dedicated to product
development.


We are young, ambitious, and extremely hardworking. Initial test batches
of cider in our basement have been favourable although not somethign
we would market.  If anyone has been down this road before (starting
a commercial cidery) and would be willing to mentor us via email, we
would welcome your insight and experience. From my initial assessment,
the blossoming cider industry seems small enough to be in the situation
that increased competition is often welcome because it increases consumer
awareness and exposure to cider. I am hopeful that someone out there in
the cider-digest world might be willing to share their experiences with us!


Please feel free to reply off-digest, my email is meldober@telus.net.

My response to Brad Hunter's request for info on Quebec Cideries is probably
too late for him to use. HOwever it may be of use to others. Last week I
spent a day sampling different cideries in the Monteregie region just east
of Montreal. I was told that there are now about 60 artisanal cideries in
Quebec. Several people recommended three cideries in particular:


Cidrerie du Minot in Hemmingford
Cidrerie Michel Jodoin in Rougemont
Domaine de Pinnacle in Dunham.


All three can be easily visited in a day. Hemmingford in the west and
Dunham to the east are about 2 hours drive apart. Rougemont is roughly
half way in between


I managed to get to du Minot and Michel Jodoin and highly recommend a
visit to both, especially for those small commercial cideries (like us)
who aspire to greatness.  The range and quality of the products , and the
quality of the packaging and presentation is extraordinary.


Quebec "revived"  its cider industry starting in 1988 and, judging by
duMinot and Jodoin, they would certainly seem to be setting the standard
for the developing artisanal cidery movement in the rest of North America.


I'd be interested to hear about Domain de Pinnacle and other Quebec cideries
recommended by Digest readers.
