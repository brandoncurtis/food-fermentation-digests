Subject: Roxbury Russet - experience?
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>

Having just processed a few small trees' worth of Roxbury Russet, I'm
curious whether my results are characteristic of the variety.  (I had
smaller crops in previous years--encouraging in blends, but not enough
to get all science-y.)


I like the juice character, which is rich and sort of nutty.  Seems to
carry over into cider.  What surprised me this year was that I waited
what seemed very long before picking.  The apples appeared ripe but still
pretty tart; the measured results squared up:  3.2 pH, SG 1.080 (right
about 20 Brix).


Do folks in other areas see the acidity on RR drop more as they ripen?
or are they really that sharp at full ripeness?  Do you get that much
sugar?


It looks ideal for me, as I've got a bunch of bittersweet juice that
should blend nicely with this.

Subject: Apples in Prosser
From: Tim Steury


It's my great pleasure to report that the anecdotal perception noted by the
Andersons (of the wet west side) has no basis.  Every tree of the cider
persuasion in our orchard over here, in the Palouse region (eastern WA and
into ID, pretty similar to Prosser) is an experiment.  As such, we've
planted a few over a hundred different varieties, and they're producing
some very pleasant surprises, among them Kingston Black, Ellis Bitter, and
the Dieppe twins of Normandy.  Yes, the apples here are going to be
different from those grown in a damper, cooler climate.  I wouldn't be
surprised if the tannins are a bit lower. That hardly translates to
"inferior." I haven't got the capacity to measure them, other than my taste
buds.  However, obviously, sugars are considerably higher, consistently 2-3
degrees higher than the Long Ashton specs.  Water's the key in this
climate, I'm convinced.  So Bob, do NOT irrigate cider varieties like the
commercial growers do around Prosser.  And by the way, you've got some of
the best soil in the world for what you're after.

Subject: Liberty apple
From: Bradley and Caitlin Hunter <hunter@midcoast.com>

Two weeks ago I thought I was all done with my fall apple and pear 
pressing here in coastal Maine.
All my carboys, oak barrels and kegs were full and fermenting.


Then a friend with a lovely organic orchard a few towns away said he 
had 6 trees of Liberty apples that were loaded with fruit but were 
probably not going to get harvested , so did I want them?


I hate to see good fruit go to waste and, although I'm growing a 
couple of grafted Liberty trees in my fledgling orchard , my trees 
are too young to produce fruit yet so I didn't have any experience 
with fermenting Liberty.


Some quick research in local orchard catalogs actually listed Liberty 
as quite a desirable variety for cider, one even going so far as to 
say it was recommended " for single variety cider ", a suggestion I 
thought was reserved for such treasures as Golden Russet, Kingston 
Black and a few select others!


Since I just happened to have 6 emergency back up 5 gal. food grade 
plastic fermenters I went ahead and pressed 27 gallons, adding to the 
mix about 2/3 bushel of Luscious pears and 1/3 bushel of mixed local 
crabs.


So, although technically not a single variety cider , it is 
predominately Liberty and I'll be curious to sample the finished 
product. Initial tasting at pressing time was very encouraging and 
I'm wondering if any one out there has experience with this variety?


Any comments or suggestions are welcome.


Cheers,


Brad

A friend and I are trying our hand at our first batch of hard cider. 
We have 8 carboys with a variety of single and blended cider. Three 
of the carboys are filled with Ruston Pippin cider and Kingston Black 
cider which we read are near perfect in composition for hard cider.


We have done our first racking and notice in all the carboys a very 
distinct sulphur smell.


Was this due to insufficient oxygen during primary fermentation?
Will it go away? On its own or by adding DAP or some nutrient?


Additionally, all the ciders were bland - not sweet, not tart, etc. 
Is this to be expected at this stage?


Are we screwed?


Thanks for any suggestions.

PS: Is there a subject index to back issues of Cider Digest or does 
one hunt and peck for subjects such as the above?
