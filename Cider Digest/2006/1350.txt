Subject: Big Cider ?

Hi,


right now I'm interested in making really "big" cider - as wine or beer
makers would say.  By big, we mean a lot of flavor, a lot of alcohol, a
lot of body - in short - a lot of everything.  I'm looking for
additives, techniques, recipes for making big cider - has anyone made
really good fortified cider?  Added other fruit or spices or other
sources of fermentable sugars and gotten good, harmonious results?


Please advise!

Hi all,


Tonight I racked some cider I've had in a secondary for nearly two
years. Per the suggestion of a local homebrew shop person I racked it
and sprinkled some dry yeast on it. I will then let the yeast rehydrate
for a couple of days before finally bottling it. (SG was 0.992!!!).


When I keyed the recipe into a homebrewing program I enterred physical
weight of the juice 38.33 lbs. into the system. With SG/pppg of 1.032 it
tells me I have an OG of 1.262, which isn't likely. I think the problem
is that it isn't taking moisture content into factor.


Anybody have better ideas of how to estimate the OG/fermentables in the
juice so I can get a better idea of how much alcohol I have?


Thanks,


Robert

Hi I'm a new brewer. I've made 30 or 40 batches of mead and became profficent
at that. I've made several batches of cyser (mead made with apples).  I also
brew my own beer from scratch grinding my own grains and everything. Now
this year the people I get honey from have alot of apple and pear trees
for there bees. They don't spray there apple because you can't for the
bees early in the yeay. I've heard you can spray after the flowers are gone
and the bees are not collecting nectar from the trees any longer, but they
don't any ways. So I got tons of free organic apples this year. There are
quite a few varities. Mac,Golden,Granny,and others. I don't have a press
only a Juicer. I painstakenley cut and juiced all theese apples with a
juicer. froze my juice untill I had 5 gallons worth. the juice was quite
thick/ pulpy. I did not filter it I'm starting to think I should have. There
propaley will be a whole gallon of waste pulp there. My original gravity
was 1.050. I did not use any additional sugars. I used wyeast cider yeast
(i don't remember the #) I started it about 4 days ago and it's going
crazy. I directley annoculated my cider with the yeast. I tasted the juice
before I fermented and it was delicious so I'm hopping the finished product
turns out ok too. I did not add any of the tablets I've heard people talking
about. I don't know what they are , but am very conserned with keeping this
all natural. A few questions for any of the experts out there would be:
how long before I rack? When all that pulp settles I can just rack the
cider off the top? Using my juicer compaired to a press would give me
alot less pulpy product? or any othe info any of you nice cider masters
would be willing to lend me thaks they call me yettie around here in The
beatiful state Wisconsin where I live

Hi All, I can now attest to the confusion on ppm in the US Campden tablets
that Dick mentioned in digest 1349 (the last few digests have been great, I
like the fast paced arrival).  I sulphated my first 5 gallon batch this year
with newly purchased tablets (5 tablets for 5 gallons) and went on my way.
I waited and waited for my "wild" yeast to kick in and it never happened.
So I added some Red Star 'Pasteur Champagne' yeast and it still took a good
few days to get started.  It was only after I has sulphated my second 5
gallon batch that I happened to look at the label again: "1 tablet = 150 ppm
Total SO2/gal."  I was very surprised because like Dick I though all Campden
tablets were 50ppm.  The product is labeled as "Sodium Metabisulphite" and
"Packaged for : L.D. Carlson, Kent, Ohio".  I guess I'll have to switch out
as Dick recommends so I know what I'm getting next year.
Best Regard,
Brian

Okay, I have the 'Fauxwhelp' trees that others have from Cummins Nursery
planted out in my orchard.  Problem is that of the three trees I have
one is obviously different.  The two similar trees are very upright
growers, even with well-trained scaffolds they bend right up as they get
out from the trunk.  The middle tree is spindly with many short branches
set off at odd angles somewhat like a young Liberty tree.  My other
piece of evidence is the fruit: the middle (odd) tree set one fruit for
me this year.  It's large, yellow, and somewhat conical with a pink
blush and is somewhat assymetrical.  Don't remember the ripening time
since I found it as a drop and just picked it up today.  flavor is
melon-like, with mild tannin and just a touch of fruity acid.
Can anyone key me in as to which tree is the 'true' Foxwhelp that's
circulating around these parts?


Thanks,


TB

congratulations to Ben Watson, Paul Correnty, Charlie Olchowski, and the
dozens of others who put this event together.


The list of speakers this year was outstanding, as was the number of ciders
available for tasting at the various events.


I've been making cider for 20 years but there are still many things to be
learned (as I always find from this forum), and this year's Cider Day was
very informative indeed. As it's always held the first weekend on Nov. it's
not to soon to start planning your attendance for next year.


cheers,

Hi all,


We are organising the first ever Australian cider judging event in Lenswood,
South Australia. Since you Europeans have been involved in cider for much
longer than we have, could you please suggest what we could give as atrophy
to the Grand Champion cider?


Cheers

2 days
20 venues
200 apples or 200 cider enthusiasts (take your pick)
2000 miles of driving


A great experience that is worth the travel.  Even through lake effect
thunder-snow around Lake Erie.


Many public thanks to the organizers who helped this midwest cider
producer get off his butt and Out East to participate in this lovely
little space/time in the cider community.

"This discussion may also be of some service to the future of Cider, if
it clears up any confusion which may have existed as to the great
difference between a real sparkling Cider, made by the expensive
processes described, and the muddy imitations which, fizzing in beer
bottles, masquerade to the detriment and prejudice of the genuine
product."
