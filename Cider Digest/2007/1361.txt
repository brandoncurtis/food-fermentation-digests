Subject: Leaving cider on the lees...

When I make cider, I begin fermentation in a large (6.5 gallon) carboy.
After 3-4 weeks of vigorous ferment, I rack the cider off the inch or
two of sediment into a 5 gallon carboy, where it continues to ferment
for several months, creating a new sediment bed. My question is whether
to leave the cider on this sediment until bottling (probably in April or
May) or should I rack it again? How long should it stay in the carboy
after ferment stops before bottling?

Greetings,


We are starting up a small cidery (~1000gal capacity) in SE Connecticut
and are curious what other people are using to bottle sparkling cider.
Right now, we are looking seriously at the 4 head manual pressure fillers
offered through Kent.  Anyone use them?  What about meheen, ppm, or seitz
machines?  Any input or experiences with these or other machines would help.


Thanks,

Does anyone have experience fermenting Cider in Conicals?  If so,
plastic or Stainless?  What experiences have you had, positive or
negative?  I read today on rec.crafts.brewing group that folks are
having problems brewing beer in plastic conicals because trub sticks to
the sides and plugs the bottom drain.


Does cider pose the same problem with lees sticking to sides and
plugging the bottom drain on plastic conicals?  What about Stainless?
How do you allow the cider to cleanse itself during the initial "boiling
over"?


I'm considering trying one next year, I haven't decided between plastic
and stainless (it's hard to justify the cost of a stainless), but I like
the concept of not needing to rack to secondary, and bottling directly
from the fermenter.  Homebrew and V-Vessel are a couple of plastics that
I've seen.


Or... Should I just take out a second mortgage and spring for Stainless,
or just give up and stick to carboys?


Thanks for any input and sorry for the barrage of questions...  So many
questions, so little time.
Kevin

Subject: Enough alcohol?

Hello!
As a first time maker of hard cider, I bought 10 gallons of juice at
Pine Hill Orchards this Fall, and have already done my first
racking.  My plan is for dry, still cider, which I will bottle.  The
issue is that, only recently, I learned that dry, still cider is
recommended to have a slightly higher alcohol content to protect the
final product in the bottle.  My OG was 1.055, and it is down to
1.002 as of this week.  That gives me about 6.5% ABV.  So, the
question - Is that enough?  If not, is it ok to add more fermentables
(cane sugar.. honey..) at this point?
Thanks in advance!
John Simmons

I just finished up with the CD back issues for the year and read some
fantastic trip notes from Dick and friends about cider tours in the
UK--  anybody have any info about cideries in Spain?  I posted for
the same on "ukcider" but it didnt get responses; I'm hoping some of
you folks have some suggestions--


If no suggestions for locations to hit, how about some notes about
spanish cider?  Lots of discussion here about english, french and
american ciders but nothing about spain--  From poking around on the
'net, I'm expecting a dry, still cider, but other than that I don't
know what I'll find.  Much obliged if anyone can reply with any
thoughts!!
