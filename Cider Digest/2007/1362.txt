We used a gravity feed filler for several years. They are relatively
inexpensive and easy to use. The problem in using them with carbonated or
sparkling cider is that you are going to loose some of the carbonation as
you bottle. We found that maintaining a consistent level of carbonation was
a hit or miss proposition. The gravity feed filler was replaced last year
with a two head counter pressure filler with two capping units from PPM. It
is well built, works well and is easy to maintain. PPM helped us get it up
and running. This being said, it represented a big investment in cash and
installation time and a bit of a learning curve to get it filling correctly.
PPM documentation was minimal when came to installation. This is not a
turnkey unit; you will need an air compressor, a CO2 source, lots of
connecters, tubing etc, 3-Phase power for the vacuum pump, a pump to feed
cider to the filler and a hot water source for CIP. PPM is a small
manufacture and the early purchasers of these units were less than happy
with the timeliness of getting their units delivered however PPM may have
resolved this problem. Going to CPF is not trivial decision but it can be
done.

Josh Klatt  was asking for locations in Spain.
Well Josh if you go to the Basks near San Sebastian you will find a lot of
sidrerias.
My experience is to go in spring,between 20 januari and the end of april.
Most cider I tasted was flat straight from enormous barrels.
Every barrel has a taste of it's own.
By coincidence I found a very good informative site of their organization with
all the 65 adresses.
Sagardotegiak is the word to google with.

I can't say if 6.5% ABV is strong enough for a still cider, as I usually
make apple wine, or cyser.  If the cider is still fermenting, you can
certainly add more fermentables at this time.  I would add a small
amount at a time, especially if the fermentation has gotten fairly slow,
just in case it does not pick up, or you could end up with a sweet,
still cider.  Also, being a mead and cyser maker, I would opt for honey,
not cane sugar, as the added fermentable.

Next Saturday,  January 13th, Vintage Virgina Apples will host their 6th
annual Cider makers forum at their complex at 2550 Rural Ridge Lane,
North Garden, VA 22959.
It slipped my mind to post the announcement -sigh- because my bride and
I can't get there this time.(first one we've missed in a while) , and
it's always a rewarding experience.  I sent a note to Chuck and
Charlotte Shelton as to whom the guest speakers are to be, but I haven't
heard back from them on the matter as yet and it's not posted on the
website.  I know that the redoubtable Tom Burford will be present and
Ben Watson  "*_Ciders Hard and Soft_*",  will also be in attendance.
Hopefully Gabriele Rausse (Assoc. Director Gardens and Grounds,
Monticello) will be there as well. Chuck Shelton and his siblings put a
great deal of effort into making sure attendees walk out having learned
something constructive about their orchards, or their cider making efforts.
There's a form on the website to register online but I suspect a call to
them this week to let them know you're coming (since it's so late) would
I'm sure be appreciated, there is $45. charge for the event, but in
years that we've been tardy, we've paid when we got there with no
problem. The Sheltons are gracious and accommodating hosts.  If you
follow the link (below) you can get directions and the rest of the data.

Most Spanish cider (sidra) is produced in Austurias and the Basque areas
along the north coast of Spain. Sidra is dry and effervescent with some
sediment in the bottom. The cider is sold by the bottle; the bottle is
shaken by the drinker to mix in the sediment, then the bottle held at
arms length above your head and poured into a glass held in your other
hand at arms length below your waist. An inch or so is poured into the
glass (and onto your feet and the floor--depending on your aim) to
enhance the effervescense and to oxygenate the sidra. Hint: move the
glass, not the bottle.


More info can be found by googling 'Spain sidra' or  'sidra espana'.
High end accommodations ($120E and up) in Spain can be found at
'paradores Spain'; we stayed in farm houses that cater to tourists for
$40 to $100/night per couple with some meals included--google 'casas
rurales Spain' to find net listings.
