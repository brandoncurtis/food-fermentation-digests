I know very little about Spanish cider myself but there is a reasonable
summary on the UK Cider Wiki and with several external links at
http://ukcider.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Cidernaut_guide_to_Spain


I seem to remember David Matthews wrote a nice article on the topic in
the CAMRA Cider Guide 2000 (not the current one) if you can find one.

I'm a first timer. I just finished bottling 2 of my 6 five gallon
batches of cider. I started with a beginning specific gravity of 1.080
and ending with 0.990 on one batch. If I did the math right that is
11.8%...wow, and I can feel it too! It has a bite, but no after taste. I
don't expect to win any awards, but hope it will mellow with age.


Next year, I want to try containing some of the C02 and make sparkling
cider. I'm not exactly sure how to do this except that you have to
bottle at just the right time. Too early and you break bottles, too late
and you get no sparkle. Anyone have suggestions or suggested reading
that explains this process better?


Lastly, I was considering making a large batch in a 55 gallon food grade
container. My thinking is I can do everything in one container. First
stage with vent from hose to release foam, second stage with an airlock,
and third, be able to tap and age it using a pressurized C02 tank
apparatus used for beer to replace the vacuum. Anyone tried this with
success or problems? Any thoughts?
