Greetings from sunny* Glasgow, Scotland, where I finally encountered
Julian Temperley's cider brandy.  WOW, this stuff is fantastic!  We're
bringing some home with us.


We have not encountered very many places with "real cider," probably
because I neglected to ask here or on the UK list for suggestions. The
one place we did, my wife said she preferred my cider to theirs!  (25
years of training is finally paying off.)


Cheers,

* Well, no, not really.

Hello fellow cidermakers:


I have a back yard filled with (at last count) 45 young cider apple
saplings on M9 rootstock in tubs. But it will be a while yet before
they are mature enough to provide enough apples to make cider. So in
the meantime, I am practicing on commercially-available juice. I am
attempting to make my first-ever batch of cider using 12 U.S. gallons
of Santa Cruz pasteurized organic apple juice and bayanus yeast. The
problem is that it gave a hydrometer reading of 5% potential alcohol,
and according to postings on the cider digest, that is insufficient
alcohol to keep it stable. My questions are: can I add extra nutrients
to the mix to raise the potential alcohol content when I rack it into
secondary fermentors, and what would be a suitable addition? A
commercial cidery on Vancouver Island makes a very nice cyser with the
addition of honey, but some comments on the Cider Digest have suggested
that honey is unsuitable because it contains an enzyme that inhibits
fermentation. If this is true, is there a method to overcome it?

Paul posted info on the results of the 2007 Upper Mississippi Mash Out
on both the Cider and Mead Lover's Digests.


But Paul, you let us down...When the contest was announced, you promised
parity with brewers for mead and cider makers!  But the post-show posting
only listed the BoS beer winner


(OK, maybe Paul has a reason, like modesty?:-)


Anyway, note that the three Best of Show were given essentially equal
footing and recognition.  The two that Paul didn't mention:


The Best of Show - Mead was "Mesquite Agave Chipotle Mead" by Paul Dienhart.


The Best of Show - Cider was "English Cider" by Gary Awdey.

I have a question for the orchardists out there.  I have a small home
orchard where each tree is very valuable to me.  This past November I
noticed some chewing by I'm pretty sure voles.  Mostly not a major concern
except one tree which is completly girdled.  It's a four year Kingston Black
on G16 ready to bear.  Originally when I saw it I considered it dead, but
now wonder if I possibly still have a chance of saving it.  I've seen
diagrams of reconnecting tissue by grafting and wonder how well this works,
do you have to preform this reconnection within days, weeks, months to
prevent the upper half from dieing.  I had another thought, since I need bud
wood for grafting this spring maybe I should salvage as much bud wood as I
can from this tree and just replant.  How long is this wood good for
grafting?


Thanks,     Eric,  Burdett NY
