Subject: Lactose

I want to add some sweetness to my newly fermented cider, a bit too dry
and acidic. I have bought some lactose, and I know my yeasts are not
going to ferment it.


Thus, I am going to bottle my cider with some glucose for
priming/carbonation, a teaspoon of tannin to add some sharpness, but I
don't know how much lactose to add. I'm afraid that tasting my cider
now, without carbonation and bootle aging, would obtain a different
mouthfeel than the final result. What is in your experience the effect
of aging and carbonation on the (non-fermentable) sweetness of a cider?
That is: shoud I stay now on the sweet side or not?


And I have another question... here in Italy many persons have lactose
intolerance, around 50% of the poulation; not me, anyway. Do you think
that the amount of lactose added to my cider can be disturbing to them?
What about milk stouts, for example, don't they have the same problem?


Thanks
Pietro Toniolo, Italy
