Dear All,


I live in Australia and have been maker cider for a few years. I have been
lucky enough to receive a grant to gain work experience in France to learn
how to make cider. Could you please suggest who would be the best sparkling
cider maker to learn from.


Many Thanks

Dear Cider Digest,
I noticed from somewhere that you can make ice cider using frozen
cider. I have some in the freezer from our apple pressing.


Do I concentrate it using the frozen distillation process and then
put the concentrate through fermentation?


Any suggestions welcome.
Thanks,
Celia

Lactose is only one-fifth as sweet as sucrose (cane or beet sugar). So
if you would normally add 1 - 2% sucrose to a dry cider to sweeten it,
you will need 5 - 10% lactose to obtain an equivalent sweetness. Quite a
lot!


Also, the yeast will not ferment lactose, but malo-lactic bacteria will.
If you get a malo-lactic fermentation (MLF) in your cider during
maturation, that lactose may disappear to be replaced with lactic acid.
That is what happens in yoghurt manufacture and may not taste very nice
at such high levels in a cider.

During ageing one thing that may happen is the loss of malic acid to
lactic acid by MLF. This will cut the perceived acidity by a half and so
the perceived sweetness of the cider will rise. As regards carbonation,
increasing carbonation is generally perceived as more acidic (therefore
less sweet).


I suggest you (a) wait until mid summer when malo-lactic activity will
be complete and (b) do some trial carbonations in a Sodastream or
equivalent.

Most of humankind has lactose intolerance when adult (not the same as
milk allergy). It is only those of us of Northern European (dairying)
ancestry who retain the ability to metabolise lactose when adult.
Regular liquid milk contains about 4% lactose. Although the effects vary
widely, many people with lactose intolerance could not comfortably
consume a pint of milk without unpleasant side-effects. The cider you
propose to sweeten will contain 5 - 10% lactose. Those people will have
a real difficulty with a pint of your cider. Some people with lactose
intolerance who have to live in a lactose-consuming society now take
lactase enzymes to help them with this problem. There is a good
discussion of this at http://www.foodreactions.co.uk/intolerance/lactose/

Hold on.  A teaspoon of tannin to what quantity of cider?


I don't know what you have for tannin in Italy, but that which is available
to the amateur in the US is rather mean stuff, and relative to our typical
batch size (5 US gal or 19 liters) I'd use no more than a quarter teaspoon
(1.25 ml).


As for lactose:  the trouble is that it is not particularly sweet, but it
contributes to mouthfeel.  I've not used it in cider, only in beers, but
there the sense is to give a somewhat "full" mouthfeel.  I don't know how
to describe it properly, other than somehow the opposite of "thin", but
not always in a positive sense.  If I were to try it in a cider I would
definitely apply it only to part of the batch, and compare.
