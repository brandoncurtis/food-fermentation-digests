  The comments about applejack are interesting.  The practice here and in
France is often to distil cider which has failed to make it as drinking
cider, maybe that is the same with applejack. My view is that if you
distil, or freeze, the very best as soon a fermentation has finished, not
a year later when alsorts  of problems have arrived, then  there are far
less problem compounds to concentrate. Julian Temperley, Somerset Cider

Having done this many times in beer making, there are many ways to
skin the cat effectively; one example which wastes some C02 but is
effective is to use on the inlet side of the Pepsi keg a relief
valve/gauge which attaches to the gas fitting. it will vent all but
the desired pressure.


The rate of natural diffusion of C02 depends on the temperature and
pressure. In warmer settings it will take longer and in colder
conditions will be more rapid.


One way to accelerate the diffusion is to pressurize the pepsi keg
and then agitate it by rolling it vigorously for a few moments. you
will discover the pressure reading from the secondary gauge on your
C02 regulator will read low, reflecting the C02 that has diffused. If
too low then repeat. If too high then vent.


A common trick to make things more predictable is to have a chest
freezer with at remote thermostat in line with the temperature probe
at the bottom of the freezer. This keeps your "freezer" at a stable
temperature. your desired 10 psi will be simple to maintain in this
environment.


A critical thing though is to use the proper length outflow tube for
the inner diameter of that tube. I've had mine so long I don't recall
the ratio but a quick browse of homebrew beer equipment suppliers
will get you that information and they can sell you the proper length
tubing with attached fittings on both ends.


I personally prefer cellar temperature and just leave the "Pepsi"
kegs in the cellar throughout the year (I have a 3 gallon one in a
fridge for my less "tasteful" friends to enjoy) they get it cold when
I share.


You will find at first the CO2 will need to be replaced frequently as
the cider is removed. As the head space increases in the Pepsi keg
you will need to touch up the pressure far less to maintain the 10
pound equilibrium.


After using the system for a few weeks it will be old hat to maintain
properly and you will love the ease and practicality.

That's exactly what will happen. Once in solution the preservative, the
corn syrup and the priming sugar will all be swimming around together.
It won't matter where they all started. There is no simple way of
achieving what you seek (a sweetened carbonated cider). One way is to
develop the carbonation as much as you desire and then to pasteurise
(see the Ag-Canada booklet on my website for details). An alternative is
to add a non-fermentable sweetener (best is sucralose, trade name
Splenda) along with the priming sugar.

I have a fermented cider that should be ready to bottle. There is a thin
white layer on the top surface (<1 mm) (in the next of a gallon jug). The
cider is otherwise clear. I originally treated the cider with Camden tablets
and used Cote de Blanc yeast.


Treat it someone or just go ahead and bottle?

METAL caps in a microwave?!?!?!? Think I'd pass on that one.
