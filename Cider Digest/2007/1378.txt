A long term women's health study by University of Minnesota and
University of Oslo researchers has found that apples and pears, as well
as red wine, decrease the risk of mortality for both coronary heart
disease and cardiovascular disease among postmenopausal women.

On the keg carbonation subject.:  Rolling kegs around on the floor is
too much work.  Put the CO2 in at around 15 psi through the 'out'
nubbin on the keg, so the gas goes to the bottom of the liquid (through
the long spear) and needs to bubble through the cider to get to the
head;  rock the Corny keg around a bit (if you have several kegs, move
the gas line from keg to keg and sing the same song while shaking each
- -- it's a good way to learn a song or two); go home (or upstairs, or
whatever) and have a glass of wine and go to bed.  Do the same thing
for a few days (you can vary the song), then walk away for a week or
so.  Come back, and you'll have nicely bubbly cider. If it's too fizzy
for your taste, let some gas off, or just draw yourself a pitcher and
let the dissolved CO2 equalize.  For what it's worth, the bubbles will
get smaller and nicer the longer you leave it alone -- big bubbles or
excessive pressure will get in the way of aromas and flavors.

Subject: promalic notes from Tideview Cider

I'm responding somewhat belatedly to Charles McGonegal's inquiry about
promalic, the alginate encapsulated schizosacchromyces pombe.


We did some trials on acid reduction last year that included this product. In
a 19 liter carboy trial we had these results, and I'm quoting from a report
we did up on the trial:


Alcoholic ferment was started with DV10 and allowed to ferment to 5
brix. Promalic was rehydrated following the manafacturers directions
and added to the carboy for 8 days. The T.A. reduced from 7 g./l. to 5.5
g./l and the pH stayed relatively stable, rising from 3.27 to 3.44. Paper
chromatography detected no lactic acid, confirming that conversion was by
Promalic and not a spontaneous malolactic fermentation.


The cider had  fresh apple aromas and no off flavours.  In a parallel
trial conducted using a malolactic strain on the same juice blend the pH
rose from 3.27 to 3.59 and there was less fresh apple in the nose. Our
overall impression of the effect of promalic in this trial was positive.


Results were not so dramatic when we tried promalic on an 800 liter tank
of the same juice blend. The promalic remained in the tank for 31 days and
reduced acidity from 7 g./l. to 6.60 g./l. pH rose from 3.25  to 3.37. A
possible reason for this reduced effectiveness may be that the promalic
was added when the fermentation was virtualy complete so alcohol levels
were higher and sugar levels were very low. Perhaps promalic needs some
sugar to work its magic.


Promalic has some disadvantages: It is very expensive compared to other
de-acidification options. It is fragile, has a short shelf life, and
rehydration is somewhat complicated and time consuming.


I'd be very curious to hear about the experiences of other cider-makers
with this product. Anyone out there have further insights?

Sounds like a film yeast to me. Does it look like

and rucks up when gently pushed with the finger?


> Treat it someone or just go ahead and bottle?


The received wisdom is to rack off the cider, treat with 50 - 100 ppm
SO2 and then keep well closed (or bottled). It's caused by an organism
(maybe a Candida) which grows on cider and metabolises the alcohol in
the presence of air.

Does anyone know anything about a French cider museum in Les Brissots?  I
have a cousin that is spending lots of time in France of late and has made
mention of it. I may be in that part of the world this summer.  But I have
not gotten any more information out of her as to specifics.  Playing with
Google maps, it looks to be 60 miles SE of Paris....  I found it on the net
(http://www.cidrefrottier.com/eng/index.htm).  Any one been there?  Is it
worth going for a non-French speaking cider maker?
