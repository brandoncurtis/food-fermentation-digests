Yeah, Dick and I (and I'm sure a number of other orchardists) got
snookered by the same supplier on 'faux foxwhelps'.  None of my
Tremlett's have begun to produce yet, so I don't know about them.   I
believe the good Dr. Cummins (Cummins Nursery)
http://www.cumminsnursery.com/
 and likely Professor Merwin at Cornell, can weigh in on the parentage
of the "faux" species.  Jim Cummins has offered a 'faux foxwelp' before
but has the integrity to identify it as such.
I have what I am comfortable saying are "true foxwhelps" from Neil
Collins at "Trees of Antiquity"
http://www.treesofantiquity.com/
... three of them as a matter of fact. jccampb

So what would be the effect of doing the *entire* fermentation with the
promalic, to ferment both the sugar and to reduce the malic acid?  Is
that possible / desirable?

I recall there was some work not long ago from a team at Cornell /
Geneva NY who had compared the genomes (DNA profiling) of a large
numbers of apple varieties (though not cider, AFAIR). I wonder how far
along this work has got?  Perhaps they could help if they have a
sufficient database now?  Ian Merwin - any ideas on this?


Certainly a number of grape varieties of previously uncertain parentage
seem to have been ID'd in this way recently.

I note that William Alwood's classic 1903 book "A study of cider making
in France, Germany, and England with comments and comparisons on
American work" is now available for download from


http://www.archive.org/details/studyofcidermaki00alworich


Alwood wrote it for the US Department of Agriculture. This is 114 pages
of pure gold (for all that it shows English cidermaking 100 years ago in
a pretty poor light, apart from the efforts of Bulmers and the Butleigh
experiments!) If you have broadband, get it!

I may, or may not, have just caused a problem with my last transfer of
cider.


I have been aging a primarily Golden Russet cider in a well used 10
gal. oak cask for almost a year.
Due to the weight of this full container and the lack of a second
strong back to help me elevate it for siphoning, I decided to use a new
tool I'd purchased.


It is a small hand held, battery operated pump that has a long shaft
and impeller inside a submersible tube.
Although it did move the cider up the tube , and did it fairly quickly,
I was concerned with the amount of turbulence it set up and I'm
wondering if I just whipped a ton of air into my poor cider.


I use a treatment of approx. 75 ppm of free SO2 ( 5 Campden tablets / 5
gal. ) at pressing but I rarely treat after that.


Since Potassium Metabisulphite is an anti-oxidant , could I now treat
my transfered cider with some dosage to minimize the possible effects
of the late introduced oxygen?


At what rate ( tablets / gal.) should I treat and does that need to be
ASAP to do any good?
If timing is critical, feel free to reply off digest  to speed the fix.


Thanks for any advice.


Brad
