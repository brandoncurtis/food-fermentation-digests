Often I read questions and pleas for advice on the CD but never see
the answers or recommendations!  The great thing about the CD is that
everyone can benefit from the experience of others, but only if it's
made public--  Why not do away with the "off the digest" replies and
open your responses to all of us-- I'm certain there are many of us
who could benefit from it!
Thanks all!
Josh

What sources are available for researching the geographic origin of
apple cultivars?  Does anyone know of reports, tables, books, articles,
etc that have already been put together?  Or is it going to be an HMS
Beagle-like expedition into musty collections of ancient nursery
catalogs?


What I'd like to put together is a table of apple varieties by region of
origin.  How big a region?  I know that the UK divies up perry history
to the parish level.  I'm thinking of something bigger for the US -
areas of one or more States.


A bigger database would be nifty - but I'd settle for a simple table.


Any thought?  Willing contributors?

Dear Orchardists and Cider makers,


As I'm sure you are aware, honey bee colonies have been taking it on the
chin in recent years. As you may or may not be aware, the phenomenon now
has a name, Colony Collapse Disorder (or CCD). Here are two excellent
resources which each have multiple links to other articles and data about
CCD;

heading/


Credit and thanks go to Al Armstrong from Valley View Lavender Farm for
providing these links which I now forward to the Cider Digest. I also send
a personal thank you to all of the talented and dedicated bee keepers,
entomologists, ecologists and agricultural professionals who are working to
identify a cause and a solution to this problem.


Best wishes for a fruitful pollinating season this year,

(note: speaking as janitor)
Josh Klatt comments on off-digest replies to questions on the digest:
    "...The great thing about the CD is that everyone can benefit from
    the experience of others, but only if it's made public--  Why not do
    away with the "off the digest" replies and open your responses to all
    of us..."


There are several considerations here.


One of them is a double-edged sword:  If somebody's posting with a problem
- -right- -now-, it may not do to wait until the next digest comes out.  As
you know, there can be long intervals between digests.  Why is that?  Other
than my own indolence, it's that there isn't enough material...so holding
material off-digest can actually feed the problem of slow response, but you
can't fault someone with an immediate problem for wanting a faster answer
than the next digest.


Now, of course you -can- send a reply both to the original questioner and
to the digest.  It's your decision as to whether it's relevant.  But do
have a care about how/when you reply to an off-digest note.  (Have a look
at the mail headers to see if it also went to the digest, or just wait an
issue.)  Otherwise you can end up creating the very confusing situation of
someone replying to a question in the same issue as the question itself.
Then people get annoyed, or at least pair-annoyed, that other folks are
getting the digests ahead of general publication.


[I as janitor see them ahead of time of course and I'm exercising that
prerogative in order to put this reply in the same issue as Josh's note.]


Sometimes folks send off-list notes in response to a question because
they're looking for clarification or suggesting that somebody else write
for the digest once some confusion gets sorted out.  This makes more sense
than having an original article in digest n, a "did you mean" in digest
n+1, a "no I meant" in digest n+2, a "OK, give us this data plz" in n+3 -
which is particularly annoying if the digests are only coming out once
a week!


Oh, there's one other reason for seeing a question and no answers:  Nobody
has the answer!


Still, Josh has a good point.  Particularly when the digest is as thin
as it has been lately, don't be shy about replying to the digest.
