Just to set the record absolutely straight here. The compound that
Charles refers to as "apple ketal" or "applinal" is a synthetic
apple-like aroma compound whose chemical name is ethyl 2-methyl 1,3
dioxolane 2-acetate  and does indeed have the CAS number 6413-10-1.


But the naturally occurring condensation product of acetaldehyde and 1,3
octanediol in ciders is 2-methyl 4-pentyl 1,3 dioxane (which so far as I
know is not manufactured commercially and for which I cannot find a CAS
number).  The two compounds are quite distinct.

  Many people  remembered the bad wine and said pew... Tomfoolery can't
produce decent  wine I'm going back to my Yellow Kangaroo and Bonnie
Dew'n.  Now everyone is a loser, even the good wineries in the AVA as
well as the wineries outside the AVA that existed before the AVA was
formed.  You can't put a boundary around quality wine and you're only
screwing  people and more than likely yourself if you try.

Oh, that's rich.  What a great statement of 'just say no'!  I love it.


The only thing I really disagree with is that you speak of AVAs in the
past tense.


I was starting to write a bit about how grape wine label claims are more
controlled than products under 7% ABV - like cider.  And how easy it is
to go over 7% in a cider with good apples - and suddenly you're
prohibited from making a number of label claims (like 'estate bottled')
just when it seems most appropriate.


But I'm not going to.


I do think it's a topic an Association or Guild might address within its
membership.  Experiment, get a feel for how the market responds - or
doesn't.  But not try to legislate.

Ethyl acetate has a more acrid and unpleasant aroma, at least at high
concentration, than the 'pear drop' aroma which is rather sweeter and
(as used in candies) more likely to be iso-amyl acetate.

Not really. In water there is a dissociation equilibrium to give one
molecule each of ethanol and acetic acid, but this is weighted in favour
of the ethyl acetate remaining largely intact. Depends though on pH and
whether anything else in the mix might drive the dissociation. You may
be getting confused by the fact that *microbiologically* ethyl acetate
is often a marker for an ongoing process of bacterial acetification. You
can smell the ethyl acetate long before you're truly aware of the acetic
acid and this often gives rise to some confusion.

Yes. The actual pear ester is ethyl dodecenoate or closely related
components. It's characteristic of dessert pears and often carries
through after fermentation to give a very characteristic odour. Oddly
enough, it seems that the "true" UK perry pears do not generally posses
this aroma and it is not significantly displayed in those resultant
perries.
