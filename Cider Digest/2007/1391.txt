Assuming you do not intend to try to build the hydraulics yourself, and 
will buy them in, there are directions on my website to the out of print 
Ag-Canada leaflet (see Building a Press) and also here 
http://mars.ark.com/%7Esqueeze/site-map.html.


There are further directions on press building on the UK Cider Wiki 
pages. See http://ukcider.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Homemade_Cider_Press


Don't forget you will need a mill too!


Good Luck


Andrew

Forest,


If you simply Google on "hydraulic cider press", the first two pages of hits
alone will point you at numerous examples ranging from minimal-home-made to
commercial-ultimate. In one sense, the decision will come down to press-up,
press-down or press-horizontally. There
are pictures of all three below.


Here are a few of the better hits.  The last one is from eBay. I bought
a new 20 ton press and stand for $99 + $125 shipping cross country. Even
with the shipping, it was one of the more economic deals that I found. I
haven't assembled it yet.

I have decided to build a simple hydraulic press.  The problem is that I 
don't have any idea what kind of tools and materials I will need for my 
project.  Also, does anyone have a link to a simple website, with picture, 
that can walk me through the process of building such a press.

Hi All,


We are organizing the Australian national and international cider judging
event. A national television program called Landline will be covering the
event but would also like to interview an international cider maker. Does
anyone know of a cider maker/judge that will be in Holidaying in Australia
before November 23rd this year. For more info go to
www.cideraustralia.com.au 


Cheers

Hi,
 I'm not sure this is the right forum for orchard problems, but I'm
desperate, and these are cider varieties! I'm having a lot of trouble with
deer eating the new (apparently tasty) growth on my 2 year old trees. The
trees outgrew their chicken wire cages when I started trying to improve
crotch angles. I mistakenly thought the 8-foot high, 3-string electric
fence, and a six mile radius of open, presumably delicious meadow- and
woodlands would make the trees not worth the shock.
 
 We've put larger chicken wire cages around each one, but as the trees
grow, this is clearly not a permanent solution. I was wondering if the
orchardists among you have any tips for dealing with deer.
 Thanks so much for your help,
 Claire Leeds

Dear digesters worldwide I reach out for your helping hand,


Last year about this time we were vacationing in Newnham (the one on the 
Severn) in Gloucestershire.  By nothing but dumb luck the Railway Inn one of 
the best cider pubs in England (if not the best in the world) was across the 
street from our place.  Dave the proprietor of the Railway had somewhere 
between fifteen and twenty perrys on draft from local cidermakers.  Every 
day soon as the sun got past the yardarm I started drinking like a sailor, 
doing my best to get through the long list where I had left off the night 
before.  This was so I could still have time to concentrate on my favorites 
before my return to the US.  During my evening ritual and the following 
morning, when I would visit the loo, I noticed the perry was producing a 
strange effect similar to the famous asparagus smell (yup it made my piss 
stink).  I noticed this more with strong flavored perrys like Blakeney Red.  
At the time I figured this was something that could be dealt with later and 
I shouldn't let it get in the way of my drinking.  Kind of similar to the 
check engine light that came on with my wife's car last week, the car still 
seemed to run fine so I just put a piece of black tape over it.  Well the 
smell came back to haunt me after we bottled our perry a few weeks ago, 
before it was bottled I didn't drink more than a wine thief full so the odor 
went unnoticed.  I was wondering if anyone else has noticed this?  You only 
need to drink a pint or two I think (actually I don't know where the 
threshold is, just like the tootsie pop owl I can't stop at one taste) but I 
drank 375 ml the other night and the smell was there.  I may have asked the 
other patrons of the Railway about this last year but for some reason I 
can't remember what they said.  If nothing else it would be a good reason 
for the British digesters to go down to the railway and preform an 
experiment for me.  If this is a common phenomena how would this effect 
marketing perry in the us?  Take advantage of the back label to explain to 
the customer why their wiz stinks?  I wouldn't want an angry or worried 
customer freaking out about this.  Could it be turned around and used to my 
advantage? check out http://www.cafepress.com/dogs_of_war/290941 however I 
wouldn't describe the smell as awesome.  The big question is: would it be 
possible for pears grown in one part of the country to create a perry that 
did make your urine smell awesome?  If so this may be a great argument for 
perry AVAs ("my piss smells better than your piss",or "make your piss smell 
just like my great grandfathers piss who's pears came from the very same 
orchard").  The first three quarters of this email is serious and if anyone 
had a similar experience or just feels like making something up please 
share.  From what I understand asparagus does not do this to everyone so 
perry may not either.
I would suggest people who wanted to try this in the US buy a bottle of my 
perry but I wouldn't want anyone thinking that I made the whole thing up 
just to sell perry or that I am using the digest for personal gain.


Scent the world, drink perry

Forest--


I finished building an hydraulic pack press last season and put it to  
good use.  Not hard to build if you are reasonably handy and stayed  
awake in high school wood shop.


The plans I used are available online various places, among them the  
resources section of Andrew Lea's website, as well as in various  
books including the Nichols/Proulx book.  There is also a good  
illustration of a similar pack press in Ben Watson's fine book.


I got most everything I needed at Home Depot.  For the frame, I glued  
up 1 X 4s of poplar and red oak to make the 4 X 4 posts and cross- 
supports.  A local wood shop milled and squared the laminated  
pieces.  I used a router to notch out the various places as  
indicated.  The frame goes together easily, just like big lincoln logs.


Building the racks is more time consuming and involved ripping a lot  
of 1/4 by 2 1/2 pieces of hardwood to make a lattice, but easily done  
on a table saw.


The cheese form and the juice tray can be as simple--in terms of  
joinery--or as complicated as you like.  There are inexpensive  
dovetail jigs available which do a beautiful job, but you could get  
by with simple butt joints.  Just depends on how fancy you want to get.


For the fasteners, I'd go with stainless.  You can get threaded rod  
online as well as stainless carriage bolts, nuts and washers.


Give the finished press a few coats of polyurethane or epoxy coat and  
you're good to go.


Good luck.
