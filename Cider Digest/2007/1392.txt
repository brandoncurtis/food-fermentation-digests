Shawn Carney asked about an odd odor of perry as it is, er, exiting the
body post-processing.


I have never encountered this, and at irregular times have consumed a
fair amount of perry -- as at CAMRA's London Drinkers Festival a few
years ago. And that product was certainly traditional cask perry from
real perry pears. Now I want to try the experiment to use up some of
the old Gwatkins I have lying around the house. Mike Beck recently sent
me some of his American perry from Michigan, but out of respect for
him, I don't want to use that as a bathroom experiment! Come to think
of it, though, I have other US perry from another source, so I'll use
that.


Not to bring the conversation down any lower, but I've had only
problems on "the other end" with perry, as I find that both perry and
pear wine can have a laxative or "loosening" effect that merits a
gentle warning to friends. But this is the first I've heard of the
"asparagus factor" with perry -- maybe Shawn is right, and it does have
something to do with the the varieties used. Anyone want to fund the
reseach?

Claire Leeds asks about deer-proofing her trees, and while there is no
foolproof solution, here are a few ideas.


1. Hang one or two smelly tankage bars on each tree. Michael Phillips
does this in the mountains of northern NH, where the deer pressure is
pretty serious. I've also heard people using very perfumed deodorant
bars for the same purpose.


2. Plant brambles or other physical barriers in the undergrowth around
trees. Rich Stadnik of Pup's Cider is doing this, with some success,
with a few of the trees that he has in his fields, which are full of
scratchy wild blackberry canes.


3. Surround each tree with a "storm fence" of strapping wired together.
My friend Roger Swain does this in his backyard, and it has prevented
deer from nibbling his nice old seedling tree. The theory is that, if
the fence is loose at the top and there's a tight space between it and
the trunk itself, then the deer will not be able (or think they won't
be able) to jump in and still get out again. So they won't go in --
like me, deer reputedly have rather poor depth perception.


Using the same rationale, Michael Phillips in "The Apple Grower"
recommends the Penn State fence, which has slanted struts on top that
jut outward. The deer stand nearby, or underneath, and apparently can't
judge the distance they need to jump. Phillips' book discusses other
options as well.


Good luck -- and let me know what works, since I'll be trying to
protect our nursery beds over this coming winter!

I had the same problem a few years ago with my orchard, and I found that
the best deer repellent is redundant CDs strung around the outside
trees.


Twine is run from stake to stake on the two open sides where the deer
come from, and a CD suspended on a short piece halfway between each
stake, so that it moves in the wind. The multicoloured flashing of the
shiny surfaces seems to scare away the deer.


Proof that it works was demonstrated two years ago. I had this system in
place for a couple of years without suffering any damage to the trees,
then the CDs were left down for one night while the grass was mowed.
Damaged occurred that night, so the CDs have been in place ever since!


As the trees grow the answer will be plastic mesh protectors up to
branch height.


Roy.

i have over the years had some serious deer problems. i have found that
the best beterant for deer is to hang small soap bars on the tree, each
tree.you want the small hotel type bars, the smelliest, stinkiest that
you can find, leave the wrapper on, drill a small hole through wrapper and
bar and hang with a piece of string, one per tree whether 1 tree or 10000
trees. this has worked for me , the largest block i did was 6000 trees on
10 acres the year after deer ate every shoot off all 6000 trees.

Close enough for all of us who grow cider apples to share concern!

They are determined, aren't they?!?

I have had good results so far[*] with a product called Liquid Fence.  It
is disgusting stuff but a safe biological control, essentially rotten eggs
and garlic.  You apply it as a spray, maybe every couple weeks.  The only
real concern with it that I've found is that you MUST not get downwind of
it when you're spraying, if you have any sort of social engagement in the
same day!


[*]I had a deer problem.  I found this stuff, sprayed it, and have kept up
the spraying about once a month during active growth season.  I've not had
a problem since I started using it.  But I realize this is like Granny's
glass of water on the windowsill to keep away lightning!  If anybody has
used it UNsuccessfully, I would love to know what happened.  Also, I'd
think you'd want to use it as one component of a control program.  Beyond
that, use as directed, objects in mirror are closer than they appear, and
your mileage may vary.
