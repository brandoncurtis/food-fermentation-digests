In the last digest, "McGonegal, Charles P" <Charles.McGonegal@uop.com>
objected (mildly) to a couple of my points:

I feel I was talking about not-knowing-your-market at a more basic level
than you were.  I'm not talking about �ppeltreow vs Farnum Hill; I'm
talking about Farnum Hill vs Strongbow.


And why would you even start if you don't have good reason and facts to
support the belief that your product is marketable?


What is it that sets "the cider business" apart from any other business
in an emerging market category?  It's always risky to think your business
is unique; that you can't apply lessons, information, analysis, and
strategy from other categories of businesses.

Sure, but I wasn't talking about holding your ground in spite of obvious
business failure.  And in particular I was trying to single out the idea
of moving toward "cool-aid" cider.  That's a particularly bad idea for a
young/small business, because it's all marketing, price-point, and shelf-
space competition.  It's a game for the big guys.

Don't dive head-first off the high board the first time you go in the
pool.  (I once tried helping with a fellow who wanted to set up a
high-quality cider business and start out with 1000 cases of cider as
a marketing test!  He wanted to rent space and acquire equipment to
produce and store this quantity right out of the gate, with no experience.
I was unable to convince him that it was too risky and expensive to start
that way, that big.  Fortunately [but not surprisingly] he was unable to
find investors.)


You have to be reasonably convinced that there is a significant market for
high-quality cider.  We sorta know that from some of the players already
in it.  As to what particular products you make for that market, you can
be prepared to adapt your blends and styles.  Keep separate the distinction
between changing your blends, and changing (lowering) your quality.

But how far down in price/quality are you prepared to move?


> Standards of Quality are not the same as Standards of Identity.


True.  But, while in theory they are quite different, in practice a
Standard of Identity often turns out to be the lowest level of standard
of quality...and sometimes the only standard well-accepted.

This is sort of related to cider and orchard stuff...  Does anyone else have
issues with moles/gophers/voles filling their various irrigation valve boxes
full of dirt?  I know that Oregon is famous for the underground critters we
have but mine love to fill them in a mater of a few days...  I trap as much
as I can but they will alway be there.  Normally I don't worry about it but
when I do have to open or close a valve (most are electrically controlled)
it's a pain to dig out inside of the box with a trowel.  The critters seem
to squeeze in the smallest holes around pipes coming in or going out...

In CD#1398 Dennis Nicholson asked for discussion on economics and marketing
of the cider business.


?   We need to hear more about the economics of cider making. More about the
marketing strategies of cider and perry products from people that have been
successful.  The old rancor about what is cider and what is cool-aid makes
no sense if our customers want cool-aid.


  There have been a few interesting responses.  I would like to strengthen
Dick Dunn?s comments (CD #1399) on that whatever you should do quality
standards comes first and foremost.  In CD#1400 ?Mark? stated that you
should ignore 90% market. (I?m paraphrasing)   I think that is a fatal
business mistake.  I think ?chasing epherma? would also be fatal.  However,
the most fatal mistake one can make is ?making and selling only what  you
like.?  Make what you like, sure, call it your reserve line.  You are
certainly not restricted to make a product that is high quality and may
appeal to broader range of palates without ?chasing epherma?.  You do not
have to sell your soul to sell out your warehouse.   Make no mistake, sales
pay for shiny SS Tanks, copper clad stills, efficient presses, tractors,
your kids college fund, mortgage, etc.  Cultivating the 10% is just as
important as cultivating the other 90%.  There is room in the cider industry
to be able to have broad appeal and to be stylistically unique.   Charles
McGonegal (CD #1400) outlined the dynamics of a tasting room and other
markets.  He is spot on.  Your artistic sensibilities are not compromised if
what your doing is maintained with quality in mind.
