A couple folks (John Simmons, Terry Bradshaw) mentioned using juice
concentrate containers as fermenters.  But Drew Zimmerman cautioned
against it, at least for a container used for orange--cider ends up
tasting like orange juice.  I've tasted such a cider as well; he's
right.


Maybe John and Terry had containers used for other than citrus?  I
suspect it's the citrus oils that linger in the plastic.  But I can
imagine that a container used for apple concentrate ought to be just
about right.

I've been using the 60 US gallon juice concentrate barrels Terry
mentioned for over 15 years, they work fine except for having to avoid
expanding and contracting with temperature variations.


My cider is primarily aimed at making the input for vinegar production,
and at one point I had as many as 20 going at a time, sitting on purpose
made pallets just big enough for 2 barrels, moved about with a pallet
jack.  Once I got a 1000 gallon "aecetator" tank  cycling, and a 500
gallon finishing tank filled, I cut back to a few barrels a year,
varying with the amount of excess apples suited to it and how much
vinegar I harvest.  They're a good size allowing flexible production.


The large hole takes a standard size bung, the small one works well for
hosing the barrel out when it's propped into a laundry type sink -
they're not hard to keep clean, but a floor drain helps, and a pallet
jack is really indispensible.

Subject: PERRY EXPOSITION at The AUTUMN SHOW, MALVERN, UK.

Dear Cider Digest,
I thought perhaps you may have an interest in the below.
Best from Tom Oliver.


Perry - A Curious Drink for a Slow World


For over 400 years, up until the early 20th Century, perry making was one of
the traditional crafts of the western Midlands and played an important part
in the rural economy. In the late 17th Century the product was in
significant demand and was held in high esteem throughout the whole Country.
Perry was kept for special guests and family occasions and, when
bottle-fermented, certain perries were accepted as being comparable to a
fine Champagne.


Today, in the early 21st Century, ?true� perry - made entirely from genuine
perry pears is now only produced in small quantities - primarily in
Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. These counties can
therefore be regarded as THE home of perry. It was for this reason that in
1991 The National Collection of Perry Pears was established at the Malvern
Showground. This unique and valuable collection contains at least one
example of all the accepted vintage perry pear varieties associated with The
Three Counties - some 90 different types - many of which are now very rare
indeed.


Pear Cider or Perry?


Although the �Pear Cider� is currently being used as an alternative name for
�Perry�, many would argue that ?true� perry should only be made from
traditional varieties of perry pears - as it was during its 17th Century
hey-day and up until about 30 years ago. Pear Cider can be made from any
variety of pears, including imported pear concentrate. A range of other
ingredients are also permitted. Some pear ciders can be primarily produced
from fermented apple juice, with pear juice added as flavouring.


In 1993 EU legislation came into force, which provides a system - Protected
Geographical Indication (PGI) - for the protection of food names on a
geographical or traditional recipe basis (similar to the ?Appellation
Controll�e� system for wines). Products named as Gloucestershire,
Herefordshire and Worcestershire perries are PGI registered and, as such,
the pears used for fermentation can only be locally grown traditional perry
pears.


Furthermore, the international Slow Food movement has now formally
recognised and listed, in its �Ark of Taste�, Three Counties and Welsh
Marches Perry. Such products can only be made from 100% fresh juice from
locally grown perry pears, with no artificial flavourings, colourings and
sweeteners being permitted. On behalf of Slow Food - an organisation that
aims to protect excellent gastronomic products that are in danger of
disappearing - the recently formed Three Counties and Welsh Marches Perry
Presidium (working group) oversees production standards to ensure product
quality and authenticity.


To recognise and celebrate the special association between this esteemed
product - perry - and its traditional home in the Three Counties, the
Malvern Autumn Show host�s the International Perry Festival, which is being
held as part of Festival of Food & Wine in the Avon Hall. A number of
participatory events are planned, which include:


o      Tutored tastings of speciality and rare perries in the Cookery
Theatre ?. and ?. your chance to vote for the products you most like for the
�Peoples Choice - Perry� award;


o      Perry sales and tastings on a number of producer stands;


o      An opportunity to meet and talk to local perry producers and members
of the Three Counties and Welsh Marches Perry Presidium;


o      A display of all fruiting perry pears in this challenged year ?. plus
?. an opportunity for anyone to bring in a sample of pears for possible
identification;


o      Expert-led orchard walk around the National Collection of Perry Pears
with Chris Fairs (Bulmers) and Charles Martell.


o      Cooking with perry and serving perry with meals - tastings and recipe
ideas.


There will also be a range of other perry related exhibits and exhibitors on
hand to illustrate the wonderful heritage and diversity associated with
these fine products. You will be able to find out about future perry-related
activities, events and even courses to help you to help you learn more about
perry and - indeed - become a perry maker yourself.


On whichever of the days you are visiting the show, we would like to welcome
you to the Avon Hall. Be there.

I've not fought the good fight that Drew Zimmerman has, and his points are
well taken.  (I've not fought the bad fight, either, just still at the
hobbiest level.)  However, wouldn't it make sense to pitch traditional cider
to the already established wine drinking market as an excellent alternative
to a dry white or dry rose?  Perhaps if we take the marketing to wine
tastings, e.g., at wine shops.  Set a bottle of white and a bottle of cider
on the table, and compare the two.  Which would you want on your
Thanksgiving table alongside the turkey, etc.  Suggest that they take both a
bottle of white and a cider home, and introduce the cider to the whole
family.

In response to Dick's challenge for cider poems, songs & sayings I submit
two pieces for reflection during this harvest season, my favorite time of
year. One is a familiar classic and 100% Made in the USA. The other is my
own.


"In A Glass of Cider"  -  Robert Frost


It seemed I was a mite of sediment
That waited for the bottom to ferment
So I could catch a bubble in ascent.
I rode up on one till the bubble burst
And when that left me to sink back reversed
I was no worse off than I was at first.
I'd catch another bubble if I waited.
The thing was to get now and then elated.


"Fall Colors" - David Catherman


Once green, now red and yellow apples
Ornament the trees.
Another venue showing Fall Colors in the breeze.


Many sorts of apples in brightly colored dress
Are rendered less-so dappled
In the Farmer's cider press.


Sweet cider running dark and dusky brown,
Now faded as the fallen leaves
Lying on the ground.


Apples and hardwood foliage change their hues together.
It's Nature's vibrant message;
Prepare for colder weather.


Best wishes for a fruitful harvest and may your cups runneth over.


Cheers,

Last year my cider was a very light, golden color, and this year it is a
very dark brown (somewhere between light and dark caramel).  I'm
crushing from the same trees, the only difference is that I "upgraded"
to a more efficient crusher this year.  Could it be the more efficient
crusher causing faster oxidation, or something else that caused the much
darker color juice?  I pressed anywhere from 5 - 30 minutes after
crushing.  I started with 30 minutes, then moved to 5 minutes when I
noticed that the juice was dark, and got the same color (roughly) when I
immediately pressed as I did after waiting 30 minutes.


Is dark cider considered a fault?
