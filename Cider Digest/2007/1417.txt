For what it's worth:


Wild yeasts: The truly wild yeasts present on the skins of apples (or
grapes, for that matter) are not usually capable of fermenting the must to
dryness.  Meanwhile, the stinks we all try to avoid are often a result of
struggling yeast, which is what most truly wild yeasts are.  The cideries
and wineries that successfully use 'wild' yeasts are usually old
establishments, long ago colonized by a successful yeast (on the bins,
press, walls, etc.), which jumps into the juice and does its business.  The
rest of us are fooling ourselves if we think that we can rely on wild yeasts
to produce a consistently pleasant cider.  We use UCD 395 (Pasteur Champagne
yeast), which is a common primary fermenter for bubbly wine.  It runs to
dryness like a juggernaut, doesn't mind cold, doesn't struggle (so doesn't
produce much in the way of H2S), and doesn't have any identifiable
organoleptic character.  We like it because we want the flavors and aromas
of our ciders to come from the fruit, not from the yeast (or its death-throe
farts).  If you want to avoid commercial yeasts, you should probably expand
on Andrew's notion and smear the walls of your place with your lees.  If you
decide to do that, though, leave the microscope in the cupboard unless you
want a panic attack.


Vinegar:  Juice can't go 'straight to vinegar' without becoming alcoholic
first.  There's nothing in a fresh apple or its juice that any acetobacter
likes to eat. They eat alcohol.

I would tend to agree with you, Charles. I also suspect that the yeast one
usually uses end up colonizing the orchard, the press, the cider room, etc.
The more it goes, the more easily my ciders start by themself without
inoculation. I almost exclusively use EC1018, and some batches are on
"wild" yeast. I find it very difficult to taste a difference. The
inoculated batches do start more rapidly however.

Charles,
In that short paragraph, you mention 3 French cider variaties which I was
not aware had been imported in N.America.
I had a look in my book by Fleckinger (Pommiers a cidre, varietes de
France) - there are many Frequin mentioned but not the Frequin tardive de
la Sarthe - could it be a synonym? Do you know more about it?
And there are 2 Domaine listed : Domaines du Calvados and Domaines de
l'Eure. Do you know if yours is one of these two?


In any case, I would be interested to learn more on how these varieties
perform.

Subject: RE: Disposal for grinding
From: Tim Bray <tbray@mcn.org>

Christian,


I thought about trying to enlarge the holes in the screen on my
disposal, but found an easier way to get better pomace.  I made a wooden
"rammer" to push the apples through the grinder faster.  This works
extremely well, increasing the speed of the operation and producing a
decently "grainy" pulp - pieces about the size of an apple seed or a
little larger, on average.


My rammer started as a piece of 4x4 lumber about 18" long.  I cut it to
an octagon shape, sized so the distance across the diagonals (the
outside diameter of the octagon) is the same as the inside diameter of
the disposal throat at the narrowest point.  Shave or sand the corners
off so it slides easily into the grinder.  I cut one end down to make a
handle, and smoothed that off so it is easier to use.  You want to shape
the "working" end so there is a raised central nub that will contact the
spindle of the grinder mechanism before the wood hits the teeth.  (I let
the grinder do this during use, but it was a bit nerve-wracking.)


Now I just fill the sink about half full of apples, and use the rammer
to push them through the grinder as fast as possible without bogging
down the motor.  With a little practice you learn the optimum rate - the
fastest you can push apples through without bogging down the motor to
the point where it overheats.  Bigger motors help - I think mine is a
(nominal) 3/4 HP, and I rarely trip the thermal sensor.  I never use
water or juice when grinding - that always results in a sauce rather
than a pulp.


Cheers,
Tim

Subject: Wild Yeast
From: "Richard" <rhanderson@centurytel.net>
Date: Fri, 26 Oct 2007 17:29:39 -0700


I remember trying to make cider relying on "wild yeast", it took a long time
to get going, although low temperatures may have been a factor.


My theory is that we North Americans do not have the flora which the
orchards in Europe and the UK do, my orchard planted in the mid 90's
replacing a 100 year old orchard, cannot compare with land which has been
used for agriculture for hundreds if not thousands of years.


The idea of using cider or even wine lees is interesting, lees are messy,
why not just hydrate some yeast and spray it in the orchard when the
temperatures and moisture content is accommodating. Better yet, perhaps a
mix of yeasts. Any ideas on what this mix would be? You can certainly buy a
number of cultured yeasts, but can you buy spoors of wild yeast?

on the wild yeast topic, I've entirely quit adding yeast to my cider
because I've been so pleased with wild fermentation.  I think my situation
is a little bit different than the other folks in the discussion so
far, though.  I work at a farm.  we buy bins of seconds to press for
fresh juice.  gravensteins early, then jonagolds.  obviously not prime
cider apples.  I fill up a carboy now and then and just let it hang
around for a while.  I don't do any sulphiting, but the apples have been
washed before we buy them, which presumably kills any organisms living
on the outside.  anyhow, I'm not winning any awards, but it's quick and
easy and tasty and it has a certain Luddite appeal.

We have modified the all stainless disposer we use by reducing the
diameter of the plate about �", and slightly bending the tabs that
create the holes at the perimeter inward, this also required the bottom
corner of the hammers to be filed off to clear the tabs. I also added
some small stainless blades that stick upward to slice the apples before
they reach the hammers. Can grind a bushel in about 4 or 5 min.   Dave

I am a small acreage commercial fruit grower here in Central Washington
State and also operate a roadside fruit stand. This year I have had a
number of inquiries for hard cider apples. I do have lots (tons)of # two
desert apples but would like to be able to provide apples to blend with
the deserts that would make a decent cider. I do have an assortment of
cider varieties (one tree of each), Brown's Apple,Domains, Court Royal,
Yarlington Mill,  Fox whelp, Stoke Red, Sweet Alford, Tremlett's
Bitter,Kingston Black and Jersey Chisel along with American Porter's
Perfection and Campfield and Siberian Crabs. What I intend to do is graft
some of my desert varieties to cider varieties, but before I do, I need
to know before grafting what will work instead of the time consuming
(years) trial and error.
Your thoughts will be appreciated. Jack in Wenatchee, Washington.

might want to consider bringing entries to Ciderday.  Once again I'll be
shuttling GLOWS entries from Massachussetts to Michigan (with temporary
storage in my cellar in New York).  It's a good way save on shipping cost .
Care is taken to ensure that entries are transported and stored under cool

Subject: perry, pears (and regionalism again)
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>
Date: Tue, 30 Oct 2007 21:07:04 -0600


I had meant to get back to this a lot sooner; perhaps the topic is stale
but I believe Mike Beck misunderstood some of my points about the potential
for perry in the US.


back in CD 1405, Mike wrote (about the Great Lakes "region"):
>...It is not out of the question for the Great Lakes to be the cradle of
> something like this.  Take for instance the Honey Crisp Apple...


I agree that some areas around the Great Lakes -could- produce good perry.
But we don't know yet.  It's a matter of whether perry pears will do well;
the success of Honey Crisp won't tell us about that.


Charles McGonegal pointed out the risks and losses of fireblight in your
region, mentioned one novel problem with his perry pears, and also
indicated that the perry pears he's been using so far in his products have
actually come from the Northwest.


What we know about growing the English perry pear varieties is, first and
foremost, that they are preferably grown in a relatively small area of
the Three Counties in England.  There is some lore suggesting that there
are lots of places they -don't- grow well (or at least don't produce fruit
of good character for perry).  Second, we know from a couple examples that
these varieties can do well in the Pacific Northwest.  We don't know
whether they'll succeed in Michigan, or in Colorado (etc.).  If they do
best with dry air and lots of sun, I win.  If they don't like our climate
here, I lose and maybe you win if they like your climate.


But really my point is that we just don't know yet!  It's not helpful to
point to success with other fruits; the pears don't care.  Nor do they care
what our tourist boards do.


Mike also raised this objection:
> Parts of the Great Lakes can grow crops in quantity that few others can.
> To say that it is equal to half the nation is just plain silly...
But that's not what I said, and certainly not what I meant.  I said:
>...Is the climate really good for -perry- pears?  East Lansing
> ain't May Hill, y'know.  More to the point, if Michigan and Wisconsin are
> good, so is about half the US!


What I mean is that about half of the US is potentially as good for growing
perry pears as Michigan.  Your climate isn't particularly close to what
it's like in England where we know the pears do well.  So if you can grow
perry pears successfully, anybody with climate/weather characteristics
somewhere between yours and mid/western England might be able to do as
well or better than you can.  The central part of western Colorado has a
better chance (theoretically!) than you do, based on climate considerations.
(Yes I'm ignoring soil considerations; those must be factored in too before
we understand where perry pears really might do well.)


and...
> The Great Lakes has Micro-Climate and soils that can not be duplicated
> anywhere else.


But this is just as true for Colorado (for example)!  You'll not find any
alpine tundra in Michigan.  I chose that specifically because it's a silly
example, to illustrate that it's not the variety of climates and soils that
matters; it's whether you've got the -right- ones.


There's potential for growing good perry pears over a large part of the US.
But the bottom line remains:  We don't KNOW (yet) where they'll do well.
And it's likely to be a long time before we do know.
