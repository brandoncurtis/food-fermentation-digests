I grow apples commercially and there is a nice selection from the Malling
and Bud series. I know nothing about the Geneva s, so I will continue to
use the rootstocks with which I am familiar.  I find very little if any
information on the Geneva series, so if it ain't broke don't fix it.

RE: Scott Smith's question regarding fruit tasting as a predictor of cider
potential


  I think that Scott is correct and it is consistent with my experience.
Chefs and winemakers like to taste their ingredients to evaluate the
potential for processing. Much of the flavor of mild flavored apples is
lost in fermentation so it is necessary to find apples whose flavor can
survive the process. Tart apples like Granny Smiths offer acid but no
tannin, not much aroma, and not much flavor. A ripe apple offers the
requisite sugar for fermentation purposes. So, the challenge is find
tannic apples and apples with nice aromas that can be blended with the
lightly flavored apples. One can train his or her taste buds over time to
identify the flavors. When we were first evaluating ciders and trying to
teach ourselves with Rhyne Cyder, I would buy a variety of apples from
the local markets and farmers. We would cut the apples up, smell them,
observe the flesh color to see if there was a browning (evidence of tannin),
and then taste them for sweetness, tannin, and sugar flavors.


  Some of juice of these apples when tasted during juicing process was so
thick, sweet, and flavorful that one glass was a satisfying as a whole meal.
It ruined me for apple juice sold in the stores.


  Anyway, you are on the right path!

I think we might call it "Andrew's assumption" but I think that's as far
as it should go!! I have done something of a search in the computer
accessible literature (i.e. back to about 1970) but found nothing. The
info about protein N in stored apple increasing at the expense of free
amino N is originally from the 1930's, and only referred to in a quaint
and obsolete form of information storage and transmission which we used
to call "textbooks" (remember them?)!!

A co-factor is something an enzyme needs to allow it to do its job
properly.

Pretty much. Yeasts, like us, need amino nitrogen (amino acids) to build
protein to grow and to form their enzymes which are also proteins. They
also need some nitrogen-containing vitamins to function properly. We can
break down protein in our stomachs to obtain the free amino acids to
re-assemble into new proteins - some fermenting yeasts can do this at a
pinch but generally it is not a route that they 'prefer'.

The amino N is indeed transformed into protein by the yeast. I would not
call it 'useless' since it provides the 'body' of the yeast and also its
enzymes, but certainly once it is locked up it is unavailable to any
other yeast cell until that cell dies and 'autolyses' and releases
nutrients back into the cider.


The most common cause of a stuck fermentation is either a lack of free
amino nitrogen (which inhibits yeast growth) or a lack of thiamin (which
inhibits the fermentation pathway). Most yeast nutrients contain both
these things.

The odd thing is exactly why the maturing apple should convert free
amino nitrogen into 'useless' protein. It's not at all clear what the
'purpose' of this is since the fruit has finished growing anyway. And
there is no information so far as I know on exactly which proteins are
being synthesized. Proteins have so many different roles and functions.

I suggest you put it on your list for next year, Claude!

Subject: Backsweetening with concentrate
From: joseph margevicius <jmargevicius@hotmail.com>

I have several batches of cider fermenting to complete dryness; some
are from pure apple juice, some had fruit (peach, raspberry, strawberry)
added to apple juice during the fermentation process.  I have read about
backsweetening using "concentrate". What are these concentrates? Are they
the frozen juice concentrates I find at my local grocer's frozen foods case
(ie, Welches, etc)? How would one use them? What would be the proportions
of defrosted concentrate to cider? Or is the concentrate some other product?
Thanks
