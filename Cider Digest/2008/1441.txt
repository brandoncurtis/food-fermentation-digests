By co-incidence I too have some 2006 perry (actually about 60 UK
gallons) which I am also bottling for fermentation in Champagne bottles
with crown caps, so my method might be of interest to you. I have
adapted a system used for bottle conditioning beer, which has worked
well for me in the past.


The perry, which has been stored in 6 gallon containers, is racked off
any residual yeast into a polybarrel and primed with white cane sugar.
Andrew Lea has advised me to use a maximum of 20 grams per litre, so I
actually used about 11.


The yeast left in the container is mixed with a couple of pints of the
primed perry and set aside under airlock in a warm place. Within 24
hours this is fermenting vigorously, and when ready to bottle 1 pint of
this is added to the 5 UK gallon (40 pint) barrel and thoroughly mixed.
This is a ratio of 2� per cent.


If you don't have any perry yeast then the wine yeast would be suitable,
but I suggest that white cane sugar is better than corn syrup as it is
less likely to impart any flavour that would overpower the delicate
flavour of the perry. And why dissolve in water? Sugar will dissolve in
the perry well enough.


I started this process back in November and the earliest bottlings have
been stored in a warm place. They are clear with a very thin deposit of
yeast, and I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will supply the
required sparkle.


Roy.

Can anyone tell me a good way to stop the apple cider fermenation before
all the sugars are fermented?  I'd like to end up with about 1 -2%
natural sugar.
thanks,
Dwight Brown

Anyone know how to make Calvados, or simple apple brandy? If you simply
distill alcoholic cider you get a clear "moonshine" No flavor or color.
What are the details to make a good Calvados? I searched the archives
back to January 07 with limited references to the subject.


Thanks, Tim

Brad,
This is quite close to what I normally do, except that you can easily
triple the sugar dosage when you use heavy Champagne bottles.
The way I do it is to measure the sugar (I also use corn sugar), and add
just enough water to cover it, then heat under low heat until the sugar
dissolves and mix in the cider. Then I usually rehydrate only half a pack
of yeast - I use Champagne yeast Lalvain EC-1118 or Redstar Prise de Mousse
for example.
You may consider also using plastic Champagne stoppers (that have a
mushroom shape) with metal wire "muselets" as we call them in French.


Good luck!
Claude
