Can anyone tell me a good way to stop the apple cider fermenation before
all the sugars are fermented?  I'd like to end up with about 1 -2%
natural sugar.
thanks,
Dwight Brown

I have been reading up on keeving, it may not help you for this year, but
it will leave you with a natuarally sweet cider.

Timothy,


Try backblending your "moonshine" with some of the original cider that
you've saved to 40% or more alcohol.  Put blend on oak (chips or barrel)
for "years".


Double distilling:  save the "heads" - the first part of the first
distillation, then save the "tails" of the second distillation to remove
some of the head volatiles (methanol mostly).  Good luck and
patience...you have to wear some dirty strap overalls with nothing on
underneath and sit on the front porch of your clapboard cabin in a
rocking chair with a shotgun to really have "moonshine".

Proper distillation (taking the right fractions) will give a suitable
flavor.  The color comes from aging in oak barrels, and of course that
adds to the flavor as it does with other brandies (as well as whiskies
and rums).

The reason you find little information is that it's illegal almost
everywhere this digest reaches.  In particular, in the US it is *really*
illegal--which is to say, taken very seriously by the authorities.

Subject: Triploidal cell division....

Can anyone explain the actual processes of fertilisation and pollination
in triploid apple trees? I'm looking for information including the cell
divisions.


To be honest, I don't care beyond the fact I know I have trees which don't
pollinate themselves and I have others that flower at the same time. Problem
solved.... But the girlfriend is a biology teacher and wants to know more.
I can't find a technical description on the web or in any of my apple
books on that details the cells splitting....

Tim, the reason you don't see much discussion is because its illegal
to produce noncommercially - even (and especially) for home use. At
least in the States.  So unless you're lucky enough to be an EnZedder,
you're kinda stuck.


I'll post one observation: all the color in distillates comes in post-
distillation. Whether its amber from oak or the green of absinthe, it
comes off the still clear.
