 Dear Timothy. In England we make apple brandy. You need the best cider
possible,  fermented without  s02 or  added sugar and then you need to
distill it. Even very simple  systems  can work  very well providing the
cider is good.  If you have duff cider  turn it to vinegar. The distillate
should be around 70% alcohol. Mature for  10 years in  oak barrels and  good
luck, its worth the trouble.  You can pick up some  more info from
www.ciderbrandy.co.uk. Regards Julian Temperley

Dwight,


Keeving is a very difficult and somewhat unpredictable way to preform a
simple task.? Most decent winemaking books will have information on how
to stop a ferm.??This?is not a task unique to cidermaking.?


Here are the basics:? 1. Start with a yeast that gets sluggish @ low temps -
epernay/cotes de?blanche?is easy to get a hold of.??2.? Rehydration yeast
an ferm as ussual (~15oC), but do not add on yeast nutrients.? 3.?Take brix
readings/taste your samples for sugar/acid balance when you get close to your
target r.s.? 4.?When you have your correct r.s. (or maybe a little above)
you need to act quickly - within a few hours - to:?(a) chill your?cider
down to as close to freezing as?possible and (b) separate as much yeast as
possible.? As a homebrewer - you can rack through a cold plate or jockey
box into a clean container.?? This will chill your cider really fast and
separate it from a lot of the yeast.? 4.? Now, keep it really?cold.??0oC if
possible.? The yeast will settle out shortly.??Warming it up will start the
fermention again.? Keep the free so2?around 40ppm.? 5.? Rack when clear,
or filter it if you have one.? (northern brewer has one for $50 bucks)


Do?NOT bottle this cider unless you?can sterile filter/pasteurize.??SO2 and
sorbate?MAY work?too, but only if you know what you are doing.? Otherwise,
you?could have?some hand grenades.?? Check back when you get close to
bottling for help.

RE: Calvados


  Licensed distillers (brandy/whiskey folks) are the folks to talk to about
the strong stuff. We talked to Hubert Germain-Robin who is from a
French family of brandy producers. His company is in Mendocino County in
California. I think he is in Ukiah. He was interested in making calvados
(apple brandy) several years ago so we met with him since he needed a
source for cider. He said that he needed cider did not have much flavor
as he would introduce the flavor by his aging techniques with barrels and
blending. Needless to say, it takes a lot of cider, which we didn't have at
the time, and he said that our cider had too much flavor for his purposes. To
get cider from 6-7% alcohol level to brandy at 40% requires a lot of cider.


  In Alameda, California, there is another distiller named St. George's
Spirits. I think that I saw some apple brandy from their factory recently.
In New Jersey, Laird's Apple Brandy is an old time producer. Their apple
brandy has a sort of coconut flavor which one gets from using American
oak. If one tastes the Calvados from France, it has a different flavor
and I think that it can be attributed partly to the barrels used.

Thanks for the comments on Calvados....I plan to stick with regular
cider.  Regular cider has more taste and is easier to make....and is
legal since 1978 here in the US.

3^rd Annual Hard Cider /Rendezvous/, Sunday March 30, 2008


Calling all home cidermakers, commercial cidermakers, hard cider
aficionados, ?. A causal get together that has almost become a tradition
at Bellwether. Bring hard cider that you?ve made and share it with other
cidermakers. If you don?t make cider but want the fun and camaraderie of
getting together with the cider geeks, this is your event. This is a
slow time of year in the tasting room with traditional wine trail
visitors, so starting at 3PM, we?re turning over our tasting room to a
vast array of hard ciders. In past years, our entire tasting bar and
several other tables were jammed with all manner of home and commercial
efforts, including some apple jack and ice ciders. Since cider is so
food friendly, this is also a potluck dinner. Bring some food along to
help soak up the cider! 3PM until whenever. Please rsvp so we can plan
for tasting space and food.

I know this subject has been discussed before on the digest, but I
can't seem to find any detailed references or how-to's.  Can someone
who has succesfully experimented with the hot water bath method of
pasteurizing semi-sweet cider describe what they have done?
Thank you!
Jason MacArthur
