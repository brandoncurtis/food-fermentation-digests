Severe spam problems have continued in our domain, and I've had to delay
digests for that as well as some other problems.  Notably also, I've had
to shut off various addresses here again for brief periods.


I hope we'll be back with little interruption now, but there are no
guarantees.  Main concern:  If you try to submit an article to the digest
and it gets tossed back at you as if the digest didn't exist, hang on and
try again.  I will attempt to limit shutdowns to a day or less, so if you
submit an article and it bounces, wait 24 hr and try again.  Same with
admin requests.


Yes, I do fully intend to keep the Cider Digest going!  It's just that
spam problems have increased dramatically this year, so even with good
tools it gets harder, and that may cause brief interruptions.


What YOU can do:  OK you're not a spammer, BUT you might very well be one
of the million-or-so people with an infected computer that's sending out
spam without your knowledge--a spam bot, a zombie machine doing the bidding
of a botnet controller.  To avoid being an unwitting spam-helper:
  * Virus-check your computer frequently.  Pay attention to all the usual
    warnings about not downloading stuff you can't verify, not opening
    active attachments, etc.  If you do screw up, get help to check and
    clean your computer.
  * Pay attention to your computer's activity.  If it's busy on the net
    and/or sending mail when you don't think it should be, disconnect from
    the net and check the machine.  (Not all bot-creating viruses are
    readily detected.)
  * Consider using a system which is highly virus-resistant, such as a Mac
    or one of the various Linux or FreeBSD releases.


[Tech talk:  The problem here is forged sender back-scatter--botnets forge
our addresses as senders.  Clumsy MTAs don't verify recipients when they
should, so they end up bouncing to the forged sender instead of the real
one.  And yes, I know about various tools.  Challenge-response is no help
on bounces; anyway it's rude and I won't deal with it.  Yes I know about
pattern-based filters and "bayesian" filters; I use both.  But they can't
get any traction on a typical bounce msg, and besides it's dangerous to
train a bayesian filter to see bounces as spam when you really need the
valid bounces.]

Con - I haven't heard of pasteurizing expressed as "PU's", but some
figures I have relating to pasteurizing for my apple juice operation:


Bulk heating to 180*F [82*C] for 30 seconds eliminates any contaminent
organisms, with the juice cooled as fast as possible once in the bottle
- - lower temperature for longer times does the job, but affect flavor
more - HTST "flash pasteurizing" uses higher temps and much shorter
times, down to 1 second


The length of time required to attain the target temp has an effect on
the process, which is likely where the PU formula applies, and a simple
bottles-in-kettle on the home stove process will most likely be complete
as soon as the desired temp is reached


143*F [62*C] for 25 minutes sounds excessive for cider.  The
fermentation process normally eliminates pathogenic bacteria, so the
focus organism for cider would be yeast/molds, which react to lower
temperatures - I believe 140*F [60*C] for 10 minutes or 160*F [70*C] for
20 seconds is usual for alcoholic products, again with as fast as
practical cooling

Peter Mitchell?s Principles and Practice of Cider Making course is again
being offered in Mount Vernon, Washington this coming June 23-27.  For
information about the course and registration see HYPERLINK
"http://learningcenters.wsu.edu/skagit/cider.html"http://learningcenters.wsu
.edu/skagit/cider.html


Registration deadline for the course is next Friday, April 18 ? sorry for
the short notice.  There is currently plenty of room in the class and unless
we get a few more registered, we will have to cancel this session.  So, if
you?ve been thinking about taking this in-depth session on cider and perry,
now?s the time.

I would not say this is definitive answer, but I can tell you about my 2006
keeved cider batch. It is a blend of 40% bittersweet apples (mainly
Yarlington Mill and my own Bitter Banana), 30% McIntosh, and the rest split
between Honeygold, Brown's Apple and Ashmead. Initial gravity was 1.066. By
beginning of June 2007, the gravity was down to 1.028, and the rate of
fermentation was about 1 degree of SG per 10 days. By mid August, it was at
1.024, and I bottled it at the end of October , at a S.G. of 1.022. I
tested the first bottle today: S.G. is still 1.022 and the cider is very
flat, but very good, with a nice bitterness that should get smoother with
aging.


Now, if I would have wanted to have this cider slightly petillant, I could
have bottled it by mid August, and to have it really sparkling, I should
have bottled it by April, when the gravity was around 1.035.


This is very easy to say a posteriori, because now I know at which gravity
the fermentation has stopped, but a year ago, when the gravity was 1.035
and the rate of fermentation was around 1 degree of SG per 10 days, it
would have been pretty difficult to predict. I guess it is only by
experience with your apples and your methods that you can accurately
predict at which SG the fermentation will naturally stop.
