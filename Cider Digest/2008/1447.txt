For some light relief Cider Digesters might like to have a look at a
segment prepared by the Australian ABC as part of their "Landline" rural
program.
http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s2208424.htm


There were also some lead-in audio and video programs prepared by our
local ABC unit that might be of interest:

As a result of the Landline program I was contacted by a lady who had
travelled in Alaska and had bought and used "cider powder" apparently as a
tea and coffee substitiute. Presumably made the same way with powder and
hot water.
Can anyone shed any light on this product?
We may have the semantics problem of cider and hard cider.
I can find some web mentions of freeze dried apple juice and freeze dried
apple pulp but would welcome some help with this.

Hi, I don't believe my last message made it to the digest, but excuse me if
I'm repeating myself.


I'm on the road, cycling from Virginia to Maine, with my partner Megan.
This tour is in part a learning experience. We have made (fermented) cider
at the orchard we worked at this past season and will be continuing to
develop this craft without doubt. We have contacted a number of farmers we
will be visiting on this tour, to learn about their operation, but there is
a deep hole in our plans in that we have very few cideries to visit! If you
are interested in seeing us, talking about about your experience making
cider and showing us your set-up, check out our website for an outline of
our route at the website below, and please contact us. We would are
interested in commercial facilities as wellas serious home/farm
cider-makers.


Cheers,
Andy Kranz-McGuire

I am the host of a new TV show that is about to start production. Would
you like your facility and products featured on our National TV show?


The show is on Artisanal Distilleries, Wineries, Breweries, Cider
Makers, and Meaderies in the US. The first season will be focusing on
facilities in the North-East. If you are in Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, or Vermont you are invited to be on the show.


We start taping June 1, 2008. The show premise is that I and a guest
expert on wines, spirits, etc. will visit your facility, ask you to give
us a tour, and teach us about who you are and what you make. Then, back
in our kitchen studio, we have guest mixologists and chefs who will
create cocktails and a meal to pair with the spirits, beer, or wine.
Each show will feature one artisanal distillery and one winery or
brewery, etc. We have lined up the top mixologists in the country and
world as guests, as well as top chefs.


We will also have a website with bio's on your facilities and products,
the cocktail recipes created by our world reknowned mixologists, and
links to your website.


Do you want to be a part of this production? If so then please CONTACT
ME IMMEDIATELY since we are about to move from pre-production to
production and taping, the show is to air starting the Fall 2008 season.


Thanks,

Several digests back there was a request for a cider map, this request
translated into an idea about a map of Northwest Cideries for the NW Cider
Society page that I have been working on. So take a look at nwcider.org.


And yes even old guys like me can upgrade their skills, I started out using
GML about three decades ago, the shift to xhtml, ccs, JavaScript and php
was, well interesting and fun, particularly on those cold wet January day
when it was to cold to work out in the orchard or even in the cidery.
