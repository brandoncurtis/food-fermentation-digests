I'll be making some changes to email handling for the digest very
soon--between this digest and the next one.  The intent is that there
be no visible difference, just sort of rearranging the electronic
furniture within talisman.com.  However, if you do see a problem, please
let me know at
cider-request@talisman.com


tnx

Re Normandy trip recommendations.
Going to Normandy several times,a very good place to visit is Cambremer
near Lisieux,they have a 'Route de Cidre' organised by their local tourist
office,and it's in the centre of the Pays d'auge Calvados area. A very good
Calvados producer is Etienne Dupont he has a website www.calvados-dupont.com
and is wellworth a visit and the host speaks english fluently. Also of
possible interest south-east of Lisieux near Marrolles on the RN13 is the
Cidricole of Ruaux et Fils a large countrystore John Deere agents but sell
all the paraphinalia from applepickers,tree guards to bottles,washers,filters
etc ,you name it they will most likely stock it,I think they supply most of
the cidermakers in that area of Normandy. If you like Poire (perry) I would
head south to Domfront as that is the best area for perry. Have a good trip.

Last year I had enough excess Cortland fruit to try a couple variations.
First one into bottle, just recently, was pure Cortland (odd choice perhaps,
but Claude has done notably well with it).  It is low-tannin as expected,
perhaps a bit high in acidity but not bad, and I decided to bottle it with
a fair bit of carbonation as a "summer cider"--it's not assertive but quite
refreshing as such.


The puzzle is that I get a flowery note from it as it warms up a bit.
Shawn Carney was here last weekend and we tasted it then; Shawn commented
on it just as I was about to do so.  It's somewhat sweet, seems sweeter
than apple-blossom scent (I think maybe possibly perhaps).  Reminds me
of just a slight hint of Lily of the Valley, which comes to mind because
it's in bloom right here right now.  I noticed it last weekend and again
several times this week (finishing off the last of the keg after bottling).


Anybody else notice this with Cortland?  If you have a cider with Cortland
in it, would you plz look for this effect?


Cortland seems to me to be an under-appreciated, yet puzzling, apple for
part or all of a cider.

 From what I've learned, you're adopting the mindset that the French
cider culture is built on.  When we were in the Pays d'Auge last
spring, we stood next to an orchard in which the oldest trees were
200+ years old.  All of the haute tige (the big trees,versus basse
tige) orchards are double-grafted.  The second graft is made at a
minimum of five years, as I recall. The farmer who owned the orchard
and made cider from it said, "You don't plant an orchard for
yourself."  You also recall the aphorism that "planting a tree is an
act of faith."
