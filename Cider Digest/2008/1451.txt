I finally got the end-of-year changes done (yes, that's end of 2007!) for
the archive packages at www.talisman.com/cider
Normally I wait a little while into the new year so that the "current year"
directory isn't so sparse...I leave a handful from the previous year for a
while.  But I'll grant that procrastinating until early June is pushing the
concept past the limit!


(At least everything was somewhere.)

The strain/climate combo we have here leans to flowery (rather than
the spicy richness I've had in Canadian cortland pomme a glac??).
Its especially pronounced if the fruit has sweated until the base color
has really gone yellow and a greasy bloom has developed.  It comes
through in the sweet cider.


As to how it expresses in the finished cider, check an appely you
might still have around. Its about a third cortland.

Dick,
I agree - Cortland cider is not the one that will have the most character,
but nicely carbonated, it makes an excellent festive drink.

I find it hard to appreciate from your description... Maybe you should
bring a few bottles to CiderDay next fall for a better appreciation, and we
could compare! I usually consider my Cortland ciders very neutral and
clean, without any special bouquet. Sometimes, however, Cortland apples
bought at the supermarket and grown in a more southern location have a
special flavor that I have never tasted in my home grown Cortlands.

Alright call me out by name!

I suppose I have to eat a little bit of crow and admit that Dick makes a darn
good Cortland cider, I was actually expecting a bit more acid than it had
so when I took my first sip... squinting my eyes... bracing myself for that
"eating apple cider bite" I was pleasantly surprised.  I have made cider
with some floral notes on the nose but this was a little more intense, but
pleasant.  I may even graft one of my prize red delicious over to a Cortland.

I'm taking the liberty of sending this to both the CIder Digest and the UK
Cider group to get the information out to as many people as possible.


For those Cider Digest subscribers 'down under' - and anyone else with an
interest - I have just finished the revision of the NSW DPI cider webpage.
The pdf on cider apple growing also carries a link to information on some
additional cider varieties - or use the separate web address below.
This second group of fifteen is the first listing of 'new' ciders
following my trip to the UK and France last October.
The information collected from from the UK and France has been used to
assess fruit sent up this summer/autumn by the Tasmanian DPI&W. The second
fifteen is the listing of varieties that appear to be true-to-type and
brings the total of cider varieties in Australia to thirty. A substantial
proportion of the number now available are French in origin. There are
further varieties in the assessment pipeline but these are waiting on
either fruit next season in Australia or information from overseas.
