Bentonite on its own is not good with cider. Reason being that it is
negatively charged and intended to neutralise and deposit protein hazes
which are positively charged. These are typical of grape wines but not
ciders since apple contains very little protein compared to grape.
Bentonite will most likely stabilise what haze there is. Also as a clay
it is very abrasive to pump seals. If you must use bentonite then use it
as a combination fining with gelatin. Details on my website (Science of
Cidermaking Part 5).


Better by far is to use Chitosan, or use Gelatin-Kiesesol as a
combination fining. Kieselsol is now available as Blankasit from Vigo
(since you are in the UK).

Jeremy,
It is my understanding that you do not need to fine with Bentonite as there
is no protein in cider.
The cloudiness is more likely just suspended particles and are best removed
by settling over time, or by filtration.

Hi
Sodium Calcium Bentonite is wonderful stuff.  Less lees (wastage) than
regular bentonite, easier to mix.
Apply by mixing the stuff in water and leave for a couple of hours.
Somewhere in the 5-10% solution range is normal.  Add to top of vessel
while mixing - in our case we pour in slowly while stirring a drum, or
have also racked onto slurry of bentonite, looking for very thorough
mixing.  Leave to settle and should all be much clearer.  Rack off the
clears and discard the bentonite lees.
Experience with wine suggests that is not a good idea to re mix the
settled bentonite or it can sort of get dispersed in finer particles
that are hard to re-settle and will block filters.
