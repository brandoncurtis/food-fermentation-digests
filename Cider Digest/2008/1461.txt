Subject: lysozome for cider

Hi,
I am wondering if others have tried using lysozome in cider as a way of
preventing malo-lactic fermentation (MLF).


I was approached by some friends to help make a batch of cider using  dessert
apples and explained to them that generally dessert apples lose their  flavor
and character after going through fermentation and secondary fermentation
(MLF). They gathered a wide array of apples, some heirloom, some common and
crushed and pressed about 500 pounds of apples on October 16. They were
determined, and to top it off, they wanted the cider to be ready by  Christmas.


I decided that the only way to achieve this was to use the enzyme lysozome
to kill the bacteria that causes MLF to occur thus preserving the fresh, tart
malic acid. It worked. The cider was bottled about two weeks prior to
Christmas  and bottle-conditioned to create a light petulance (about 9
grams/Liter of sugar).


I do not understand enzymes: do they remain in the cider? (I assume yes)  and
are they at all harmful to the consumer. I know that one is supposed to
register their use with the TTB.

I just heard back from the Gloucestershire Orchard Group, and they have
added a PDF version of "Native Apples of Gloucester" to their web page.
They have asked that download be from their site and this certainly is
reasonable.  For those interested in the book, in either .DOC, or .PDF
format, the URL is:

A few years ago I experimented with multiple rackings to slow/stop
fermentation for a slight residual sugar cider.   I added some bentonite
a day or two before each racking to try and compact the lees and get a
cleaner transfer.  The experiment was pretty successful.  Perhaps the
bentonite played an unrecognized role in the success!
