I do not understand enzymes: do they remain in the cider? (I assume yes) and

register their use with the TTB.


Ron, I've been using lysozyme on both my cider and perry for the last couple
of years.  Especially the perry, since I've developed a (nearly) irrational
loathing of MLF in perry.


Yes, the enzymes remain in cider/perry unless removed with bentonite fining.
They shouldn't cause any harm - but I believe (commercially) you have to
label with Allergen info: egg.  And I suppose it would break any vegan
certification.  I had been leaving the enzyme in - and that's probably the
source of the white haze/sediment that several of my products have been
developing as the temperature changes with the seasons.   Protein haze.  I
thought the TTB dropped its experimental use registration a couple of years
ago.


I just recently had a discussion the a Scott Labs rep about this.  He noted
that lysozyme is actually much more active and efficient at the low alcohol
and high pH of perry. (Mine runs about pH 4.0)  They are strongly
recommending it over the high sulfite level that would be required.


As an aside - if anyone else is trying the ProElif encapsulated yeast, I
have found out recently that it has a SO2 sensitivity and a thiamin
requirement that aren't characteristic of the DV10 yeast that's been
encapsulated.  My fermentation regimen and anti MLF schedule hit those
sensitivities squarely on the head in my last batch of sparkling perry.
Much to my chagrin.

Subject: Cranberry Cider
From: Bradley Hunter <hunter@midcoast.com>

Cider pressing time is fast approaching here in northern New England
and I find myself with about 10 lbs. of frozen organic local
cranberries that are looking for a purpose in life.


I would like to make a cranberry cider but I would like to try a wine
making technique in the process.


Some recipes, including Paul Correnty in The Art of Cidermaking,
advocate juicing the cranberries through cheese cloth and adding just
the strained juice to the primary fermenter. That particular recipe
actually calls for a brief boiling of the cranberries until they burst.
Even though I would be adding pectic enzyme, the boiling makes me
nervous that I would risk setting the pectin and making a cloudy
finished product.


I would like to try a red wine making trick where you leave the entire
crushed grape (cranberry), skin and all, for an extended contact time
in the juice to maximize color extraction.


I normally sulphite my cider, before inoculating with yeast, at a rate of
approx. 75 ppm free SO2. I would add my defrosted crushed cranberries to the
unfermented cider before sulphiting to knock back any wild yeasts
attached to them.


Does this seem like a reasonable approach or are there some potential
risks that I'm not seeing?
Has anyone tried something similar with good results?


All comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.


Brad

Subject: Apple syrup densities
From: chris horn <agent_strangelove@hotmail.com>

Is anyone out there playing with apple syrup?  I have extra juice (it's
Summer Red so don't tell me it would make OK cider, I've tried, it's
poor...) and was going to boil down a few gallons.  My father has made
this syrup for years but does it all by feel.  He shoots for a 4:1 or
5:1 reduction.  I would like a bit more of defined window to shoot for
since I will do it in bulk in a keg cooker.


Maple syrup falls between 66-68 brix (higher and it will crystalize, lower
and it ferments/molds).  Does anyone know if I can aim for the same ball
park and be OK?
(I'm borrowing my brother's syrup hydrometers since my fermenting one doesn't
go quite that high....)


Thanks

Im looking for hard cider making festivals where I can chat with other
makers here in the USA. Close to Ohio if possible.   I find alot of sweet
apple cider festivals most of which are family related where hard cider
is forbidden.


Thanks

Cider Makers-
Cornell University will offer again this December an intensive
shortcourse for cider makers, taught by Dr. Peter Mitchell from the
UK. The course--Cider Making: A Foundation--will cover all essential
aspects of cider making, including the raw materials, laboratory
analyses, management of fermentation, sensory analysis, blending, and
product development.  Dr. Mitchell is a widely respected expert and
consultant on cider making, and has been teaching the art and science
of ciders professionally for more than 20 years.


The four-day course will take place Dec. 1 to 4, 2008, at the Geneva
NY Experiment Station.  Registration will be limited to 20, on a
first-come basis.  The registration fee is $800, not including
lodging. For more information and registration forms, please contact
Nancy Long at 315-787-2288 between the
hours of 08.30 am and 01.00 pm EST, or email her at NPL1@nysaes.cornell.edu


You may also register online at www.nysaes.cornell.edu//hp/events and
click on Cider Making - A Foundation.   Hope to see some of you there!
