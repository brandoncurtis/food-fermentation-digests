Thanks to Jay for his thoughtful explanation and context as seen from
the judging side.  Hope I didn't seem like the enraged parent at a
little league game screaming at the umpire for a calling my kid out
at home.


And, of course, the bottom line is that despite thinking my entries
were the Dom of all ciders, it may well be that there were, in fact,
mediocre.  Nothing blinds one faster than having "made it oneself."


Score sheets will eventually be sent and I'll then know even more of
the rationale behind the results.

Jay Hersh's comment on categories and the BJCP were spot on.  Many of
the issues I address to competition entrants who are disspleased with
something is because they really don't understand the judging process or
the pragmatics of organizing and running a competition.


One added item about cider judging.  The BJCP has in the works additional
training for judging cider.  Gary Awdey did a great job training BJCP judges
at the AHA conference this year.  He also supplied an excellent selection
of ciders to some of the regional competitions where we conducted cider
judging training prior to judging ciders.


The BJCP has implemented a Mead Judge certification exam; the first one
is currently being graded.  We have every intention of also implementing
a Cider Judge certification exam as well.   There is considerable interest
in both within the traditional "home fermentation" hobbyists.

The Official Bulletin of Castile and Leon [BOCyL] officially declared
the presence of _Erwinia amylovora_ [fireblight] in the localities of
Cacabelos, Sancedo, and Congosto. They are the 1st 3 foci announced
during the summer [2008], the period with greater presence of this
disease, which results in a drying of fruit trees. With these 3
municipalities there are now more than 10 municipalities affected.


According to BOCyL, analyses of specimens taken in Cacabelos,
Sancedo, and Congosto were positive [for fireblight], [making it
necessary] to "tear out the affected trees before 31 Dec [2008]" in
order to prevent further spread of the bacteria. To date, the disease
has already destroyed 25 000 fruit trees in the region.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees
worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible,
although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only
members of the _Rosaceae_ sub-family _Pomoideae_ are affected and the
host range covers more than 180 species from 39 genera.


The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. The bacteria are highly
infectious and are spread by insects, wind, water, mechanical means,
and on plant material (including budwood). They enter the host plant
through wounds. The pathogen has been placed on the quarantine alert
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). For more
information on fireblight please see links and previous ProMED-mail
posts listed below.

Can anyone point me in the direction of a good recipe/ process for a home
cider maker to make Ice Cider? Is it made from juice pressed from frozen
apples, unfrozen apples but the juice gets partially frozen, etc.?
Thanks
Joe Margevicius

in an effort to free up a carboy for new cider I just bottled 4.5 gallons
of jonagold cider I started the middle of October last year.  I haven't been
expecting much out of this batch ever since a pretty solid white film formed
on its surface about six months ago.  but it was good.  smells a bit like
bourbon, very alcohol hot (bear with me, I'm no BJCP certificate-holder).
unusual taste.  more like Rodenbach and other sour ales I've had than the
cider I'm used to.


anyhow, the procedure went like this: commercially washed jonagold seconds
from Merrit's Apples in Bow, Washington squeezed on my employer's reliable
old press.  the juice was filtered through a couple of bags, maybe 5mm mesh?
pumped directly into my five gallon carboy and stopped with an airlock.
that's all.  didn't add a thing.  the room it sat in for eleven months
was a pretty consistent 65 degrees farenheit.  I topped up the airlock a
couple of times.  that's the whole story.


does that sour ale taste mean it's headed toward vinegar?  should I drink
it fast while it's really tasty?  sundry thoughts, speculations, advice?


thanks,
tel
