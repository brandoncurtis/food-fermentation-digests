tel,


The white film may be a pelicale from Brettanomyces yeasts.    This yeast
will produce sourness (think Orval beer).  But it's not acetic acid, so no
vinegar.  You won't get vinegar unless the cider were (1) infected with
acetobactor and (2) it was openly exposed to oxygen.   Brett does provide
some great horsey notes and character.   This may be why it reminds you more
of a Belgian ale than a cider.   Brett is not supposed to be indigineous to
the US but it may not be in the environment in parts of the country.   Taste
it before you do anything with the cider, like dump it.

can anyone advise us on how to treat 3, 6 gallon, carboys of cider
that has sat on its lees for a year, with air locks topped up, and
having fermented to total dryness.  it is very tart.  if we were to
add sugar before bottling, should we do it in the carboys or in the
bottle?  how much?  any other tips?  thanks sam, connecticut

I pressed 50 gallons of juice this year, and have a combination of 5 and 6
gallon carboys fermenting.  One either has an infection or it is keeving on
its own,  I'm hoping someone can help me determine which.


I added Lalvin 1118 yeast and blow-off tubes until things settled down, then
I added air locks.  One carboy overflowed the airlock, and it has what looks
like tannish-brown brain-matter on the surface.


I'm not sure what the proper means is for sharing pictures on the forum, but
I have a snapfish album with a few pictures, if anyone is willing to look.
If that doesn't work or is against rules, I'm open to suggestions on how I
can share the pictures.

Passing this email on at the request of Zeke, a grower of really interesting
apples just outside Brattleboro, VT:


Terry, we have a very good supply of Kingston Black along with several other
American and English apples well suited for hard cider if you could pass the
word along.
Our price would be $14/bu, $12 for American and some of the other French and
English varieties.
Contact Scott Farm at scottfrm@sover.net or 802 254 6868. Thanks and good
luck with the season.
Zeke Goodband
