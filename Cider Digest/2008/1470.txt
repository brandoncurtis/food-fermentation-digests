David,
For my part, if I pick the apples from the trees, and they have no rot, I
find it unnessary to add any sulfite (or Campden teblets) to the juice
before fermentation. I have never spoiled a batch in 20 years because I
didn't add sulfite to the juice. Now, if you do it commercially, you may
not want to take a chance and choose to add sulfite, that's OK - but if you
do it for yourself, why would you add it - sulfite is not really healthy...
So my point of view is if I do cider for myself, I don't want to have all
the additives commercial producers have to add, and I think I get a much
better and healthier product that way.

The verdict is in?on my second ever batch of cider. Last year I got  
50 gallons of late-season juice from Bill the Squeeze (Thanks,  
Bill!). I froze 5 of the 5-gallon buckets, and pitched 1 envelope of  
Lalvin EC1118 per bucket of each of the other five as soon as they  
arrived, after a 2-hour drive and 5-hour ferry trip (don't ask!).  No  
sulphite. I hoped that if the Lalvin got a good robust fermentation  
going quickly it would overwhelm any free-range yeast that happened  
to be present, The hydrometer reading was 045, i.e, just on the edge  
of keepability. After the first fermentation was complete, I racked  
it into carboys, and half-thawed one of the remaining buckets,  
leaving half as a core of ice, and added approximately 2 litres of  
the concentrated thawed juice to each of the carboys. Another very  
vigourous and longer-lasting fermentation took place.  It finished  
fermenting and cleared naturally around the middle of February.  I  
then racked and bottled each 5 gallons with 1.5 litres of clear juice  
(sadly, I was in the middle of moving and wound up using Sun-Rype).  
The results have been, to my inexperienced eye and palate, AWESOME!  
Clear, very dry, no aftertaste, nothing but fermented apple. We have  
been happily guzzling it up all summer. Thanks to all you folks for  
your advice and general handholding, Couldn't have done it without you.

The amount you need depends on the pH of the juice, which you will have 
to measure. There is a table on my website which shows how much to add. 
See http://cider.org.uk/phandacid.htm


If you have absolutely no way of measuring pH, you can take a flier and 
just add one Campden tablet per gallon. This gives you 50 ppm SO2. 
Unless the juice is very acid indeed (eg UK Bramley or similar), you 
will probably be OK with this and it will not inhibit the added yeast 
too much.


You should wait overnight after addition of sulphite, before adding a yeast.
