We recently switched to using Iodine as a sanitizer.  Our practice has
been, after we have sanitized all vessels, to allow the iodine solution
to sit for several days until it loses it's color.  This is the point,
according to the label, at which it is no longer effective, so we have
been assuming it is therefore safe to dispose of.  Is this correct?  I
don't want to damage my septic system nor inadvertently pollute ground
or surface water and would appreciate any feedback on the biological
impact of iodine after several days of being exposed to oxygen and
microbes.
Happy Pressing!

We had a little late season production and decided to try a keeve
experiment on a very small scale.


Here are the specifics:


The juice was mostly desert apples, somewhat more acid than ideal
(3.4 pH).  We milled late afternoon.  Allowed the pulp to sit
overnight and then pressed the next day.  We ended up with about 10
liters, which we dosed with CaCO3 and table salt and set it in a 5
gal carboy at 53 degrees F.


Within a day or two, it had thrown down the typical grayish sediment
on the bottom.  By day six, it had formed about a 2" thick brown
gelatinous layer resting on top of the first layer, so it seemed so
far, so good.  But that's when things stopped.


It has now been 11 days.  There is no sign of any fermentation.  No
gas being produced.  The must has cleared somewhat, but by no means
is clear like I've seen in pictures.  It's still fairly murky.  And
the brown gelatinous layer is still resting on the bottom.


However, now there are signs of white mold beginning to form on the
surface.


For the last three years we have had good luck doing a portion of our
ciders with natural yeast, even those batches that we've "dusted"
with a little potassium metasulphite per Andrew's suggestion, say
50ppm.  Within ten days or so, things were usually beginning to roll
along nicely, so I feel pretty confident there's plenty of innoculum
in the system.  And this batch had no added sulphites, so it seems it
would have been able to start up even easier.


I'm a little stumped as to why with this batch it's more inclined to
get moldy than ferment.  Could it be that the keeve worked too well
in fixing all the available nitrogen and the natural yeast is just
too nutrient-starved to even start up?  Is there anything I could try
to urge it along?


No great loss if I have to toss this batch, but I'm hoping next year
to have enough bittersweets to do it right and I'd certainly like to
learn what I can from this current experiment.


Thanks for any ideas.

For anyone planning to send entries to the 4th Annual Greal Lakes
International Cider & Perry Competition
(http://michiganhardcider.org/2008GLINTEntry_FINAL_.pdf )
who also plans to attend the 14th Annual Franklin County CiderDays event
next weekend (www.ciderday.org):  As usual there will be a courtesy shuttle
to take your entries from one event to the other.  In addition to helping
you save on shipping cost, the shuttled entries will be transported and
stored at cool temperature (more than UPS can guarantee).  If  you won't
be at Ciderdays but know someone in your area who can get it there for you
the offer still stands.  If you don't have time to fill out the entry
form before Ciderdays you can send that separately to the registrar,
Jeff Carlson, as long as it is received before the Dec. 2 deadline.
Bottles to be shuttled should be brought to me.  You should be able to
find me at most of the Saturday Ciderday events (up to and including the
Saturday Ciderday Dinner).
