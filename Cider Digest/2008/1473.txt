If you're a Cider Digest subscriber with mail at yahoo.com and you see this
posting (e.g., in the archives or from someone else), please take note of
the following.  Or if you know someone who normally receives the Digest via
an account on yahoo.com, PLEASE pass this information along:


Yahoo! recently started blocking mail from our domain.  I don't know how
much has been blocked since they've botched the block and it takes five
days for me to find out.  I don't know if I can get it fixed since their
trouble-report web page is all bollixed up.


I'll keep trying to get it fixed, but if the yahoo subscribers don't see
digests flowing again by the end of next week (first full week in
November), they should assume yahoo won't fix it and/or I've given up.
Over the years, Yahoo! has caused me 10x more problems than all other ISPs
put together, and frankly I'm fed up with it.


The best solution is for subscribers to find a reliable ISP for their
mail.  Not to play favorites, but gmail (Google Mail) has done very well,
for just one example.


Sorry for the non-cider noise, but I want to keep the digest flowing to
everyone who wants it.

I don't know about disposal, but I stopped using iodine on the press after
the 'Great Iodine Debacle of 2005'.  I initially ised iodophor on the press,
cloths, etc., and it left a major residual odor/taste.  I use Star San on
the metal parts of the press now, and chlorine on cloths and wood racks
(200 ppm) and walls and floors (600 ppm).  I may think if iodine again for
non-contact areas, but I don't know that I'd put it on the press itself
again, at least not anything that's absorbent.


A little off your original question, I know, but I don't recall a good
sanitizer discussion here before.

Here I go again taking another person's post and twisting it into my
own.  I have been a proponent of wild ferments for some time now, and
most of my customers in the mill followed that advice in 2006 and 2007
with good results.  I have always maintained a separate set of wooden
racks that are pressure washed after every squeeze but never sanitized.
These racks were seeded with a wine yeast in 2005 by soaking in a sugar
water plus working yeast solution overnight.  This year however I have
had bad luck with getting wild ferments going to the point where in a
two-week period I completely changed my advice to customers and began
handing out yeast with every carboy.  After some people reported mold
problems I also bumped up the default sulfite levels that I apply to all
juice as it comes off the press from 50 to 100 ppm. Side note: my
antidote to molding has been to rack off the mold, hit with 100 ppm
sulfite, then pitch an active yeast.


I don't know if there's a question here, I just wanted to report my
experience from this year.  I'm thinking that thorough and regular
pressure washing of racks could be enough to strip them of a decent
population of yeast, or there were some factor which kept them from
overwintering (the garage doesn't freeze).


I'll try one carboy from this past week as a wild one, but I'll be using
Red Star Premier Cuvee or Cotes de Blancs in most of them this year.
Another side note: for those who use packaged yeasts, what ones do you like?

I'm aware that there is a required warning label in the U.S. to sell
unpasteurized apple juice (a.k.a. cider) and that some states such as New
York have even outlawed the sale of unpasteurized juice however I would
like to find a website that lists other federal requirements in this regard.


For example, is it permissable to sell properly labeled unpasteurized
apple juice in a farmers' market?

First, what levels of chalk and salt did you use? Second, I'm wondering
about "table salt".  They contain salts in addition to sodium chloride
(eg ferricyanides) to prevent caking and to preserve free-running, so
I'm just wondering if they are inhibiting the yeast in addition to the
sodium chloride itself.

Two weeks a go I put up my first batch of cider for the year- 15
gallons split into 3 carboys. SG. 1.060. All three pitched with
LC1118. Treated 2 carboys with metabisulphite @ 50ppm.  Left the third
to see what the result would be. The result? A silver dollar size
white mold floating on top of the fermenting cider. Suctioned the mold
off as well as possible..


So now what? Do I sulphite and reapply yeast? At what rate? Any other
ideas?
Thanks in advance

Other chemists / biochemists / microbiologists on the list may have a
different view but my take is as follows:


Iodine is a powerful oxidising agent and sanitises in that way (breaking
DNA strands in microbes etc). By doing so it is chemically reduced to
(colourless) iodide which is no more toxic than chloride (eg common
salt). It should not therefore damage septic systems once colourless nor
present a biological hazard in that state.


Thats my two cents / six penn'orth.

Subject: Campden Tablet shelf life
From: Bradley Hunter <hunter@midcoast.com>

A local Homebrew Supply shop went out of business several years ago and
I purchased a large bag of Campden Tablets at close out prices. I usually
sulfite my ciders at the rate of 75 ppm before fermentation and my annual
production is around 40 - 50 gal.  At that rate I'm not using up this bulk
bag of tablets very quickly.


Does anyone have a sense of how much SO2 effectiveness is lost over time,
if any?  The fact that they are tablets and not powdered crystals means
less surface area is exposed to air. Is that a consideration?


I do use a sulphite and citric acid rinse in my oak barrel cleaning schedule
so perhaps the aged Campden tablets might be reserved for that application
and new ones be utilized in the actual fermentation process?


Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.

Walter, I can tell you that sulfur candles do not kill malolactic bacteria
in barrels and I would bet they would not kill acetic acid bacteria either.
I have never tried to bring a bad barrel back but I have heard that ozone
will do so, and also a product from Barrel Builders
http://barrelbuilders.com/
called ProxyClean.  The best thing for barrels is to keep them full of cider
as much as possible, if this isn?t an option keep 10-15 gal of low ph water
with a good dose of SO2 and burn sulfur every few months.

Right now I'm enjoying a Normandy cider that was matured in Calvados
casks for 6 months.  I'm very happy.


Cleveland Park Liquor & Wines maintains a very nice selection of cider,
and they are looking into offering a cider tasting sometime soon.


I'm not much into commercial plugs, but they have been very helpful
tracking down labels, and keep Aspall in the cooler.
