We used 3 grams CaCO3 and 4 grams table salt per ten liters.  In
hindsight, should have taken your advice and just used Calcium
Chloride, but we had the other in hand.  Maybe pharmacologically pure
NaCl would have made a difference sans any other additive.


In the meantime, we racked it off into clean containers--it was
getting pretty funky--and a fermentation finally got started, at
about day sixteen.

I am fermenting a cider I made from pasteurized, yet unfiltered apple juice.
It has been in the secondary for about 1 month and is very slowly clearing.
Does anyone have a suggestion for clearing the cider?

Hi,


I am interested in the cider making process and have some fermenting at the
moment.  I am not that familiar with the process, however, I have some
background in winemaking and beer brewing. I am interested in any
information out there on cider making.


Thanks for the help,


John Engstrom

Hi everyone, I'm new to this Digest and I have a couple of questions.  I am
in the process of testing a cider brewing kit and am wondering whether
anyone else has used one and what kind of results they achieved?


I have brewed my own cider before but wanted to be able to recommend to
people ways to get started.  I am considering recommending kit as one
possible way.  Along with testing it myself I wanted to gather other
experiences and recommendations.


I'm English but live in the States and I have found that few people brew
here it or are even really sure what it is.  I am building a blog talking
about all things Hard Cider.  I'm doing this with the intent of encouraging
people to try it.


My blog is http://www.makehardcidereasy.com/ please feel free to take a look
at it.  I have only produced a couple of pages so far but am attempting to
collect tips, tricks and recipes.  I hope its okay to ask for input in this
publication?


If I use any input I would happy to provide acknowledgements of authorship
and linkbacks as requested.


Contact me at makehardcidereasy@gmail.com.


Thanks tim

I'm looking for home-brew solutions for making pomace out of apples next
fall.  Has anyone had luck with the garbage disposal solution, or
modifying a chipper/shredder?  One thing that I don't want to do is
crank by hand!


I've seen a lot of stuff on the web, but no good documentation of a
successful machine.
