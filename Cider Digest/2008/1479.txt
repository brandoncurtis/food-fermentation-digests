re: question regarding odd defecation


I committed a large amount of juice this year to purely experimental
defecation, partly in response to an early freeze.  The second week
in October all the fruit remaining on our trees froze solid at 15 F.
Two nights later it froze again at 12 F.  Rock hard. At first I told
myself, in denial, we'll do ice cider.  But no, it was too early.
The fruit simply hadn't finished ripening.  As a result we had low
sugars and acids--and presumably high pectin content.  Our
experimental batches were a blend of about 15 varieties, with
specific gravities hovering around 1.040 and pH ranging from 3.6 to
over 4.  I added PME and CaCl2.  I got a couple of decent
defecations.  But I also have several containers sitting in my cider
house that have separated into layers.  But the top layer is not a
distinct chapeau brun.  It is a thick gel, hanging there on top of a
clear juice as a thick translucent layer.  Any insight????

For those who might be interested in taking a look, I have uploaded
pictures of my press and shredder in a Web album. You may see it at the
following URL:
http://picasaweb.google.com/cjoliprsf/ApplePress


The press is small, light, the frame is welded steel. The frame for the
cheeses is 10"x10", for 100 square inches, but as the run goes and the
cheeses get compressed, the area increases to about 120 square inches
maybe. The jack is 4 tons, so in theory, I get about 65 psi of pressure.
Although this press looks small, it does take up to 15 kg per load, which
is a not-fully-full bushell.


I usually get yields around 55 to 65 % depending on the variety, timing and
other factors. Sometimes I do a second pressing of the pomace, and this
gives about 20% more juice. So, if for example, I have 30 kg of apples, I
will do 2 runs to collect about 17 litres of juice. And I could do a third
run with the pomace of the first 2 to collect another 3 to 3-1/2 litres. So
I get about 20 litres that will weight 21 kg, this would be a yield of 70%.
My yields are not so great for a few reasons - my orchard is not fertilised
and the apples are small and scabby. Also my shredder makes pieces that are
too large - some improvement is required there...
