Jennie,
All this is fine in my opinion, except for the word "brewing"...


>and plan to bottle at the end of January.


Now, what makes you think it will be ready to bottle by end of January? Do
you have readings of the S.G.?


>If I wait that

I don't think this is a long wait. I often bottle much later than that (in
fall) and there is always some yeast left. You can always add half a
package at bottling time - it may make you feel better!


>Should I bring the cider upstairs
>(around 66 degress F) to warm it up and get it fermenting faster?


I would not recommend it, unless you are really in a hurry to drink it. You
would loose in quality. But if you have many carboys going, you could
always try one for a faster fermentation and earlier taste. If you really
want a carboy to ferment faster, you could also add a bit of yeast nutrient
rather than bringing it upstairs (but again this would be at the expense of
a loss in quality). However all this really depends on the SG reading of
the cider. It would be easier to give you advice knowing at what speed it
is fermenting.

My apologies to Claude for permitting his acknowledgment of the award and
listing of production details to precede the complete announcement of
results.  Unfortuanately the announcement was bounced due to a format
incompatibility issue and I was unable to edit before CD #1480 was posted.

Subject: Sulphur smell

I made a small experimental batch last September consisting of one gallon
each of Ida Red, MacIntosh, and Snow. I crushed three Campden tablets and
added to the juice 24 hours before before adding 71B yeast. I did not take
a pH or acid reading. After racking last week, I noticed a very strong
sulphur/rotten egg odor. I have never had this happen before even though
I normally sulfite at the same dosage all the time. What hppened? Will it
dissipate in time? Can it be fixed?
Thanks

Subject: Crispin and water...and more...
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>
Date: Tue, 30 Dec 2008 00:39:12 -0700


On the topic of the new US products of the "Crispin" brand (see Cider
Digest 1475-1478:


I haven't tasted any of them yet, sorry, so I'm still musing.  BUT I've
seen some labels, which list ingredients:
    Hard apple cider, carbonated water, apple juice concentrate, natural
    flavors, malic acid, sulfites.
Hmmm...(!)...Crispin's ad campaign is pushing to have it served over ice.
The second ingredient in Crispin's ciders is water.  The first ingredient
is a label-term which refers to apple juice possibly with sugar and/or
water added, then fermented.


So, let's see...we start with apple juice.  Then maybe we add water before
fermenting, then add water after fermenting, then serve it over frozen
water.  The emphasis I'm getting here is water, y'know?  Not apple.  But
of course apple juice costs more than water, so this is good sales strategy
if it works.  (Not nearly as good as the bottled-water game, of course.)


There's a bit more about Crispin from past digests that I wanted to pick
up, although perhaps this is redundant to other followups.  Leslie Heron
wrote that:
> Crispin is made in a classical "Normandy" style...
Well, having seen what's in it, I think not!  Certainly Crispin could not
(by regulation) even be presented in France as a "cidre".


Leslie discussed using apple juice concentrate in the fermentation (they
do not) vs after-fermentation sweetening (they do).  This is a curious
choice, and although Leslie defends both sides of it, I question both.
As far as fermentation, she writes:
> Our belief is that apple juice concentrate ferments
> "hot" due to high residual sugars.
This is a mis-use of both "hot" and "residual sugar".  "Hot" refers to the
character of out-of-balance alcohol--too much compared to the rest of the
character.  That can hardly apply to fermenting concentrate as such because
it will be diluted and modified before drinking.  But residual sugars (if
there were any) would offset the "hotness" of a too-alcoholic ferment.
Moreover, there won't be residual sugar in a fermented-out situation with
concentrate; there are no unfermentable sugars in apple juice.


On the other side, using apple juice concentrate -after- fermenting (to
re-sweeten):
> We also believe that our classic smoothing (sweetening) with apple
> juice concentrate versus sugar (which is cheaper) gives a longer,
> fuller apple bouquet and a longer smoother taste finish on the palate.
(It's not "classic".)
There are two problems with post-fermentation juice (often called "back
sweetening with juice") concentrate.  The first is that the flavors of
unfermented juice tend to clash with the fermented cider.  Some folks
like the effect, or at least don't mind, but frankly the marriage is
seldom really successful.  The second problem, in this case, is that the
choice is backwards:  Crispin is fermented with juice and back-sweetened
with concentrate, whereas if the desire is a "longer, fuller apple bouquet"
the fresh juice should be used at the end.  The concentration process
inevitably removes volatile character (bouquet), so the concentrate should
be used for the fermentation if concentrate must be used at all.


Back to the (water,) water, water...
> The Cider Over Ice serving ritual has not entered the US lexicon - and
> in our opinion is well suited to the US where consumption is preferred
> cold and often over ice for many, many beverages.
The "cider over ice" ritual was invented by Magners (Bulmer IE) not too
many years ago.  There is no tradition to it; it's a marketing ploy.  I
agree that you can say a marketing ploy is well suited to the US, but
that doesn't help -real- cider.  And yes, the US prefers cold.  The US
is probably the only country in the world where "coldest beer in town"
isn't an insult.  With sufficient marketing you could sell cheeseburgers
over ice in the US!  But cheeseburgers...or cider...over ice...won't
have any staying power.


> The more dialogue relative to helping cider re-enter the mainstream for
> the first time since John Adams is helpful and positive.


Dialogue about cider in the US has been slowly increasing.  It is indeed
an uphill battle so far.  But a faux cider is unlikely to help the cause
of real cider; it could hurt quite a bit.  We already have plenty of
six-pack ciders, British and American: a "hard cider" base plus water,
malic acid, flavors, and some form of sweetening.  How's another cast from
the same mold going to help?  I can't see it.
