>First of all what happened to cause the mold to form


Taking a blind swing in the dark I would say your PH was too high.
If you did not test it, do you know which apple varieties were used?


>juice does ferment to dryness will my cider taste of mold?
I might try thr following:
1) test the PH and adjust if needed. But keep in mind - who knows what
   microbiological activity may have already occurred.


2) rack the cider leaving the top few inches closest to the mold.

We have made a good batch of serbian cider! thanks for the help. One
of the barrels has become a bit eggy tho.
Which of the following methods are the best methods for removing
hydrogen sulphide
1) Adding sulphides
2) Inducing malolactic fermentation with addition of sulphides
3)Adding copper sulfate pentahydrate. This involves leaving it to
settle as residue at the bottom of the barrel after a few days, then
racking leaving the residue behind.
4)What sort of surface area does the open container you rack into need
to have to allow the juice to aerate enough to get rid of the hydrogen
sulphide.


Thanks very much

We've been growing fruit and trees of "Foxwhelp" for the past few
years.  We don't pretend that it's the original.  (If we could get
wood for the original, we would be happy to produce trees for sale.)
Ever since eating the fruit of the "faux" I suspected it might make a
decent cooking apple.  It's not bad out of hand, especially in the
fall.  It starts to get a bit weird flavored in January.  The other
day I baked a single variety Foxwhelp pie on a hunch.  We were all
pleasantly surprised. The flavor was quite tasty.  It did sink more
that I would have liked.  For that reason, I wouldn't recommend it
for single variety pies, but it would make a very good addition to a
winter pie of mixed varieties and I'm guessing it will make very
decent sauce.

Having followed the threads over several years but an not sure as to the
value of this question.
We are a small hobby producer that use an orchard with 35 types of
apples comprising of 100 plus trees. Some trees dating back 80 years or
more. Wine and cider are not new to us as a hobby streaching back 40
years or so ,our output varies between 40 to 60gal on wine and 60 to 80
gal of apple wine/ cider.
My question is all though process is the same with a batch of cider what
can cause part of a batch with the same apple juice and yeast to leave
one 5 gallon carboy clear and one next to it cloudy? We have settled on
the wyeast cider yeast and a sweet mead for a less dry finish for some
of the wine.
These jugs are in a 52 to 55 degree area. Of one of the blended batches
of juice [25 gal] 10 gals are clear and 15 gals are not.   The later
earlier squeeze are all clearing well. To clear to use gelatin,
sparkolides,or bentenite tis the question. The wine is near finish at 0.996.


thanks in advance
