Never heard of those two. Can't imagine any form of sulphide would
diminish H2S. If that's a typo and you mean sulphite, that wouldn't work
either. And addition of sulphite wouldn't encourage MLF - it would
inhibit it. I never heard of MLF reducing H2S. Sounds a bit of a long
shot to me.

Yup that works for sure. But only a *very* small amount is needed (one
or 2 parts per million as the salt). Be sure you can measure it
accurately. Use 'serial dilution' of a stock solution and double check
your calculations. I have seen a US textbook which quotes addition of 4
g copper sulphate per 1000 gallons (38 hL) to give an increase in copper
content of 0.2 parts per million (mg/l). That's the sort of level you're
looking at.

It doesn't really work like that. You can't easily aerate H2S away
without damaging the cider. It's not advised to rack into open
containers. Air is bad news for cider and encourages the H2S to change
to disulphides which are even worse and not removed by copper. Nitrogen
sparging of H2S is an alternative possibility. H2S does often disappear
from newly fermented cider but probably mostly due to back adsorption
onto yeast. Remember the amounts involved are tiny - parts per billion only.

You don't say where in the world you are but it's only mid February. I
would give it a bit more time (a couple of months) and maybe drop the
temperature to around 40F (4C) if you can, before concluding they're not
clearing. Vessel size and geometry can have an effect on clearing time
and initiation (due to thermoclines / circulation patterns).


Bentonite on its own is for protein which is not relevant in cider.
Sparkaloid is a polysaccharide not usually effective in cider. Gelatin
is OK but very easy to overfine.  Chitosan is often used professionally
and worth investigating if you can get it. If you must eventually fine,
I would use gelatin / bentonite as a combination fining or, better,
gelatin / kieselsol if you can get it. Make sure you use special
beverage grade gelatin, not the sort used for cooking. Do test finings
first. More details on my website (see Science of Cidermaking Part 5) or
in my book.

Shaun Carney suggests the mold formed because the ph may have been too
high, that may well be as I didn't test  but the fact that the apples I
used had been stored for four months may have had something to do with
it. While the apples( Braeburn and Goldens) were still firm and juicy,
that length of time in storage may have mellowed them enough to cause the
ph to be high? I've used that apple combination before with apples stored
for one month with no problem. I'll test the ph for the next batch..
                        Thanks for the input, Jack Feil

For those of us in North America, there's a trip-up in trying to locate
Andrew Lea's book, _Craft_Cider_Making_:  If you try to get it from Amazon,
they have two listings for the book.  One is a blind alley, due to there
being two ISBNs for the book but only one useful here.  Andrew advises
that the correct Amazon entry is:
http://www.amazon.com/Craft-Cider-Making-Andrew-Lea/dp/1904871372/ref=ed_oe_p


This confusion is featured only at amazon.com (afaik!).  If you're in
the UK or more convenient to there, finding it via amazon.co.uk will work.


And, of course, there are other sellers for the book.  If you have problems
with one, the US importer's link is:
http://www.voyageurpress.com/Store/ProductDetails_41551.ncm
