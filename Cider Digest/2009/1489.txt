The HDPE tanks have a history of use here in Oz for cider. FlexTank 
indicate that they have supplied about 60-80KL of tanks to Little 
Creatures Cider in Western Australia during recent years.
If you have particular issues you want to discuss, try contacting the 
Technical Director (Anthony Flecknoe-Brown) via sales@flextank.com.au


There are various reprints on their website discussing performance  of 
HDPE and making comparisons with oak and stainless.

The general equation for titration and expression as malic acid is as 
follows:


Malic acid (g/L) = (mL of NaOH)* (normality of NaOH)* 67 / (mL of sample).


[In the case of NaOH, which is monobasic, molarity and normality are the 
same].


So the equation becomes


(mL of NaOH)* 0.1 * 67 / 25 , or


(mL of NaOH) * 0.268.


In other words the multiplier is half what you were given since the 
sodium hydroxide is only half as strong.
