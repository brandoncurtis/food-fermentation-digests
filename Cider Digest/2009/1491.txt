David,
From my experience, the first and the last glass from a press run have the
same sugar content and acidity. However, they differ in taste, mouth feel
and consistence. The last glass is usually clearer. There surely are some
differences in composition, but I guess a complete chemical analysis would
be required to assess it.

If you mean a kind of fecal / dog mess aroma, then this can be due to
indole production by yeast. Not absolutely clear why this happens, but
it's associated with tryptophan metabolism and it's quite common in
high-gravity low-juice fermentations. The fix is to add a little Vitamin
B6 (pyridoxine) before fermentation - around 1 ppm.


Maybe worth a try?

Mark, it depends on whether you are talking "dirty" or "clean" diapers.
Dirty diapers would probably come from mercaptans which are usually a
product of H2S reacting with alcohol.  Clean diapers(or band-aid) could
be Brettanomyces.


Was there a fart in the diaper before the poop?  Did you notice any H2S
(hydrogen sulfide - rotten egg smell)? Is the cider still fermenting?
