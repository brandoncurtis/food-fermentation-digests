I made some cider in 2007 that we really liked. Fermented it in a
whiskey barrel and racked it off into airtight carboys this fall. After
racking there was no further visible fermentation. We bottled one
carboy and gradually used up the bottled cider. We bottled the
remaining carboy last week, but the cider is now tasting very acidic.
No vinegar taste, just very acidic. Both carboys were filled from the
same source on the same day, and both had airlocks. At this point is
there anything I can do to mellow it out?  By the way, this was all
done with natural yeast and no added sugar.
On another note, does perry typically undergo a secondary fermentation?
We made five gallons from dessert pears and it fermented nicely last
fall in the carboy. I am wondering if I should expect any more
fermentation come warmer weather (its in the cellar), or whether I
should rack and bottle it. It tastes nice but a little harsh at this
point. Again, all natural yeasts and no added sugar.

I've been looking for text books on cider chemistry and microbiology online,
but the best stuff I've been able to find so far are enology books -- at
least as concerns books with good information on sulfur chemistry (free &
bound), yeast biology, the effects of tannins, etc. So, I've got 2
questions:
1) Are there any good text books that focus on cider, rather than wine, and
what are they?
2) If not, will book on wine chemistry do, and if so, which
are recommendable?


Thanks,
Bill
