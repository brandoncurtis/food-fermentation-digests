Hello Jack,


MN 1734 is not a new apple.  It has been around for quite a few years
though I'm not sure anyone knows when the cross was made.
Coincidentally we sold it in our catalog this year. (We're now sold
out.) There's also a description on our website.  I have not made
cider with it.  I don't think U Minnesota has any intentions of
naming or releasing the apple.  I could provide scionwood if you'd
like to try it, though that might have to wait to 2010.
Best regards,
John Bunker

No. The last textbook in English was Charley's 1949 translation of
Warcollier's 1928 La Cidrerie, as Principles and Practice of
Cidermaking. As you can imagine, it is impossibly out of date although
some of it can still be useful.


The best you will do now is chapters in multi-authored books. I would
suggest my 2003 cider chapter in 'Fermented Beverage Production' as a
start

A more detailed but older review specifically on cider yeast and
fermentation issues (1993) is by Fred Beech in Rose and Harrison's The
Yeasts Volume 5  (2nd edition)
http://www.amazon.com/Yeasts-Second-Yeast-Technology-Genetics/dp/0125964153/ref=
sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238779787&sr=1-1


Probably the best overall cider review for both chemistry and
microbiology is by Beech and Carr on Cider and Perry (but 1977 so ageing
somewhat) as pages 139 - 313 in Economic Microbiology Vol 1 again edited
by Rose but this is now out of print though secondhand copies are
available e.g.
http://www.alibris.com/booksearch.detail?invid=9456898923&qtit=alcoholic+beverag
es&browse=2&query=economic+microbiology&qsort=&page=1

White wine chemistry and microbiology will do up to a point. Certainly
a better bet than a brewing textbook. But some things are different - eg
sugar (hence alcohol) levels in apple are lower than in grape (about
half) and nutrient levels are much lower (maybe by five or tenfold).
This does have quite an effect on the way cider behaves compared to
wine. And the behaviour of tannins in red wine do not really relate to
those in apples.


The UC Davis volume is good
http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Practices-Winemaking-Roger-Boulton/dp/083421270
6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238780228&sr=1-1


as is the Ribereau Gayon Bordeaux tome (2 volumes)
http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Enology-Microbiology-Wine-Vinifications/dp/047001
0347/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238780311&sr=1-2
and
http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Enology-Chemistry-Wine-Stabilization/dp/047001037
1/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b


For an amateur approach to cider there is always Craft Cider Making
http://www.amazon.com/Craft-Cider-Making-Andrew-Lea/dp/1904871372/ref=sr_1_1?ie=
UTF8&s=books&qid=1238780493&sr=1-1
but I guess you're looking for something more technically substantial.
