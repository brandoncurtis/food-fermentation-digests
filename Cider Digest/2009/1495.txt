I just moved to Chicago and was curious if there were others on the list
from the area.  If so, I would love to hear suggestions for relatively local
places I can find good cider (be it a farmhouse, bar, restaurant or store),
as well as places I can go talk about good cider.  If there's interest, I'd
love to arrange a local meet-up, (but somebody has to suggest a good place
for one first).

Just wondering if anyone on the list is able to comment on the quality of
the courses offered by Mitchell F&D Limited's Cider Academy:
http://www.cider-academy.co.uk/
Suggestions on alternatives would be welcome too.
