Ben,


AEppeltreow winery. I94 north to WI 142, ten miles west. Great cider,
perry and conversation.


For stores, west Lakeview liquor has oliver's, farnhum hill, and other

I'm sure you will get a few replies to this question.  Many of us on this
list have taken the class.  I was very happy with it's form and content.
I think all the other folks involved in my class were like wise impressed.
I also was lucky enough to travel on a tour of UK cider & perry stuff that
Peter did a few years ago with other cider makers.  It's well worth the
cost of the class and the trip (if he does one of those again).


The class may also be a chance to put a face with other folks on this list.
The CD janitor was in my class....  Thanks for running this list, Mr. Dunn.

Re: Cider Academy


I (and two others from Farnum Hill) took a couple of Peter Mitchell's
courses fifteen years ago in Hindlip, UK (at the Worcester College of
Agriculture), before he was offering them in the US.  They were extremely
useful, and he's a very good teacher.  We took the 'cider foundation' course
one year, and a tasting/sensory evaluation course the next.  We didn't
exactly learn how to make cider, or how to evaluate it, but the courses had
a great deal to do with the early course of both of those processes at
Farnum Hill.  I've spoken to a number of other cidermakers who've taken one
or another of Peter's courses, and I've never heard anyone regret the time
or money.  My only reservation is that he pushes a bit hard on the
sterilization button, including vigorous emphasis on pasteurization.  I
think heat damages cider and wine, and that rigorous attention to sanitation
will yield better, more lively cider, without significant risk of the sort
of injury that pasteurization is intended to prevent.

I took Cider Making- A Foundation this last fall, and found it to be
an excellent class which I would highly recommend to anyone
considering commercial production of cider.

John Mott asked about Peter Mitchell's cider courses.


The basic course is good for the serious amateur or someone considering
small-scale commercial, depending on how much other reading and experience
you have.  The information is sound and complete.


Pros:  Actual experience with the basic lab work; tasting in a group with
a knowledgable guide who can help you understand balance and flaws--very
hard to learn on your own.


Cons:  Various people with reasonable experience have found there's too
much emphasis on consistency and by-the-numbers cidermaking, rather than
treating cider as a wine with variability.

As a novice I have my first batch of cider from last fall still in its' 5
gal carboy that I racked off its lees a bit too soon and topped off with 1%
sugar solution that raised the specific gravity a bit. It is finally back
down to 1.009 as we have had a couple of nice warm spring days here in
Northwestern Oregon. On the warmer days I have noted consistent very small
bubbles. I seem to recall from the CD archives that very small bubbles
indicate malolactic fermentation. I have observed small bubbles on the
warmer days and the fermentation lock has been releasing gas as a slow rate
somewhat correlated with the ambient temperature. I am excited about
bottling my cider. May I prevail upon someone with cider making more
experience (probably anyone reading CD) for advice; should I continue to
exercise patience and wait or am I safe in bottling at around this specific
gravity 1.009? The taste I took today was quite pleasant, but I've still got
to develop a palate.


Thank you,

Just wondering if anyone on the list is able to comment on the quality of
the courses offered by Mitchell F&D Limited's Cider Academy:
http://www.cider-academy.co.uk/
Suggestions on alternatives would be welcome too.

I've taken Peter Mitchell's Basics Principles and Practices course, the
Cider Sensory Perception course, and then a bespoke tour in England and
highly recommend his services.  He is very conscientious and knowledgeable,
and makes the learning enjoyable.  Hard not to when its cider.
