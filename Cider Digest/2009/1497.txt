Greetings all,


While on a recent trip to Belgium, I had a Magners Irish Cider along with
some nice Normady ciders.  Strange to be asking for ciders in the heart of
beer country, I know. Didn't want to buy the Strongbow Gold, but a
storekeeper pulled this out so I bought some.


Any opinions on this cider, how it's made, what they use, taste, etc?


Cheers


John

First off I would like to thank Ben & Charles for responding to my first
post.  Things came up with the family and my computer which kept me from
replying.


Spring is here in Michigan and once again the desire to plant some trees
is gnawing at me. Once again, I am late in ordering any and some places
are already closed for 2009 or out of the more popular varieties.  But I'm
going to plant something this year!


Ben, Opalescent was one on my list. Besides it's nice features I had read
a story that it was first found in Michigan.  Winter Banana I have read
about and believe it is available somewhat locally. I will look further
into it and Gold Rush which I believe ripens later than most and would
help spread out the season.  Kerr Crab I like because of it's parentage
Dogolo x Haralson. Both mentioned as good for cider.


Charles, Were you thinking of Harrison or Haralson? Both mentioned for cider.
Besides the Hewe's Virgina crab (Thomas Jefferson's favorite) which you
mentioned, I was also looking at Wickson crab. Anybody have any experience
with them? Pippin and E. Spitzenburg are the parents.


Anybody have a favorite Russet? Grimes, Roxbury, Zabergau Reinette ?
Has anyone used Asmead's Kernel for a cider apple?  And finally is there a
true Redstreak available in the USA and what do you like or dislike about it.
As you can see....I would like to plant them all!


Frank
