My Winter Bananas do not make good cider.  The apples grow too large too
fast, leading to low sugar levels and little flavor, producing a thin
and insipid cider.  I've been disappointed in all the blends I used them in.


My favorite Russets are Golden and Roxbury.  Both are quite vigorous and
productive, and make a good base for cider blends.  Golden might have
the edge for cider, having more sugar and less acid than Roxbury, also
it is smaller and easier to grind.  Roxburies keep better and are more
of an all-purpose apple.


Ashmead's Kernel can also be an excellent apple in cider blends.  I made
a great cider two years ago with Ashmead's, Cox's, and Taylor's (a
bittersweet).  Ashmead's has a rich flavor, some of which can survive
fermentation, and plenty of sugar in good years.  A great eating apple
as well, but doesn't keep.


Wickson doesn't produce well for me, but others have great success with
it and the cider is reportedly excellent.  I think my problem is a
combination of poor climate (cool summers) and bad planting (too close
to Redwoods).


Hewe's Virginia Crab made a great cider the one year it produced enough
for me.  The apples are so small that it takes a lot of trees to make
enough for a batch. (I have four, on standard rootstock, planted in
2001.)  Also it ripens very early, before any other cider fruit is
ready, so there's not much to blend it with.  If you have room for at
least six trees, though, you might make a terrific varietal cider from it.


Cheers,

Charles, Were you thinking of Harrison or Haralson? Both mentioned for cider.
Besides the Hewe's Virgina crab (Thomas Jefferson's favorite) which you
mentioned, I was also looking at Wickson crab. Anybody have any experience
with them? Pippin and E. Spitzenburg are the parents.


Frank, we have Haralson here, but the ones that come from over by MN taste
much better.  I don't think you'll get cold enough where you are for really
good Haralson.


I did indeed mean Harrison - recovered in recent years by Tom Burford.  I
think the main source is Vintage Virginia Apples.


I also have Wickson, but have mixed feelings about it.  I know Al Etter
suggested it for sparkling cider - but at my site, it's just not what I have
in mind for cider.  It bears young and heavily.  It's quite pretty.  But it
doesn't develop the bragged about Brix levels and (to me) has a taste of
baked squash.  I _really_ prefer Hewes.


I use Ashmeads, Blenheim Orange, Margil, Cox's Orange, English Golden Russet
and Roxbury in blends.  I recently tried a varietal Albemarle Pippin cider
from the nearly open Albemarle Ciderworks that was really quite pleasant.

[Janitor's note:  Jim cleared this posting with me.  I feel the difficulty
of finding true cider varieties in the US justifies a "semi-commercial"

Can't speak for NW Oregon but here in England April would be far too
early for MLF. The weather really needs to be above 15C consistently for
many weeks. My guess is that you have a slightly stuck yeast
fermentation which has got going again now the weather is a trifle
warmer. In any case MLF will not affect the SG, because it's malic acid
being metabolised, not sugar. The correlation of fermentation lock
actvity with ambient temperature could be in part a simple physical
'outgassing' effect.  Size of bubble is no measure of the causative
organism. Often a MLF will not show any overt bubbles at all.


As for safety to bottle - it would be safe at 1.009 if in proper heavy
weight champagne bottles. Crown cap bottles are not regarded as safe if
the SG exceeds 1.005. If the cider is still fermenting in its carboy it
will continue to do so in bottle and provide you with a good level of
carbonation.

re: what to plant


Frank, you asked about russets.  Grimes Golden is not a russet, but
in some years can make a good single varietal cider.  Light, fruity.
It's also my favorite eating apple.  Golden Russet consistently makes
a good cider, rich and complex.

Here in Southern England the apple trees are blooming and a fine sight
it is. Will it be followed by fruit though? We have heard a lot on both
sides of the pond about Colony Collapse Disorder in honey bees and no
doubt it is a genuine issue even if its cause is uncertain. But I rarely
see a honey bee on my trees in any case whereas I see many wild bees and
other flying insects crawling over the blossom. Are these not effective
pollinators?


My question is ... to what extent is the honey bee an important
pollinator for people with small orchards surrounded by other vegetation
types and habitats where wild insects live? Obviously with large
commercial orchards, where any habitat for free living insects is far
distant, introduced honey bee hives are important... but for the rest of
us, is it the case?  What experience do others have?

"While on a recent trip to Belgium, I had a Magners Irish Cider along with
some nice Normandy ciders.  Strange to be asking for ciders in the heart of
beer country, I know. Didn't want to buy the Strongbow Gold, but a
storekeeper pulled this out so I bought some.


Any opinions on this cider, how it's made, what they use, taste, etc?"


Hi John,
Magners "Irish" cider has had a big influence on cider-buying here in the
UK, mainly due to the massive (and costly) advertising that has accompanied
it. It became very fashionable to drink it and the spin-off is a much
higher presence of cider in the UK market. However, it is not a "real"
cider by UK definitions, nor is it made 100% from "Irish" apples as much
of the cider apple fruit has apparently been sourced in the south-west of
England. However, Magners have planted more orchards in Ireland, some of
which I believe are true cider apples, although much of the fruit used in
these "Irish" ciders are culinary varieties, rather than the traditional
bittersweets and bittersharps more commonly used in the UK.


Magners has a curious colour, often described as "pink" which is most
probably not natural! It is carbonated artificially and sweetened quite
heavily, probably to mask the true nature of the fruit used. It would be
interesting to hear exactly what is given as ingredients on the labels
of export bottles, as labelling of alcoholic drinks is not compulsory
or even recommended here in the UK. I personally dislike it, but maybe
that's because I'm used to drinking pure juice ciders - from a range of
apple types - rather than something which probably owes more to the skill
of a laboratory technician than a skilled artisan cider-maker.


Magners is often classed as an "industrial cider" here in the UK due
to the way it is mass-manufactured. A true Normandy cider will be made
from little more than pure apple juice, but Magners cider most probably
contains water, sugar, various cereal-based syrups, and colouring agents,
as well as a probably-quite-low percentage of apple juice: I would guess
much less than 50% on a good day, more likely around 35%?


Cheers,




Ray
