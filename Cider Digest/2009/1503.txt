Hello Erin,  We have planted an orchard in the Port Townsend area where the
soil is primarily glacial till.  So we have the same problem, no drainage.
We raised every row (21) scraping dirt from between the rows up into the
rows.  When even that didn't seem like enough we scraped the dirt up from
between where the individual trees would be planted.  Then we added our soil
amendments.  The trees are now in their 4th year and with drip irrigation
seem to be thriving, if slowly.  These are dwarf trees on a trellis system.
We do have vole and rabbit problems, if anyone has suggestions we would love
to hear them, we are certified organic so somewhat limited. Thanks  Nancy &
Steve Bishop

You can always get them from whisky makers like Jack Daniels, but
price and shipping cost to Vermont would probably be prohibitive.


I recently searched for some half-barrels for my girlfriend to use
as planters, and was surprised at how difficult they were to locate.
Years ago I recall seeing them at just about any garden center in
town.  I finally found some near Nashville, about 100 miles away.
The seller claimed that China is buying lots of barrels, and that
they are using the wood to make veneer for furniture.  Hearsay info,
obviously, but certainly believable considering China's appetite for
raw materials.

The "lightstruck" chemistry that occurs in beers cannot occur in cider
because it lacks the relevant sulphur compounds. Whether it might be
subject to a more subtle form of light and riboflavin mediated flavour
degradation reported in grape wines ("gout de lumiere") is a moot point.
Here in the UK many top end commercial ciders are bottled in clear glass
and so practically it is evidently not seen as a problem. But they are
displayed and sold under fluorescent lighting, not in direct sunlight.
By and large clear glass is probably perfectly safe for cider under
normal retail conditions.

About Tim's grafting questions:


>1.  Can I successfully graft an early-bloomer onto a late-bloomer?


I really don't see why it wouldn't work. I have in the same tree up to 20
varieties, some early blomers, some late bloomers, and they simply bloom
when their time comes.


>2.  How late in spring can I successfully cleft-graft?


I try to time my grafting approximately during blooming, but it can easily
be a couple of weeks earlier or later. Maybe later grafts will have a
little shorter growing season.
