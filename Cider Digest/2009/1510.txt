I have used Neptunes Harvest Fish emulsion/Kelp fertilizer as a foliar
fertilizer and I believe it works very well as a deer repellant.  I have
not seen any deer damage to my trees when I use it weekly/biweekly depending
on rain.  It definetly smells, probably similar to liquid fence.  Anyone else
use this and see minimal deer damage?

Hi Dick,


I have not had to use Liquid Fence for deer, but for rabbits. I sprayed
it once and they never came back. I'm a true believer - the product works.

We live in a an area of Southern Oregon which has, at least in our neck of
the woods, an extremely high deer population.  We have had absolutely no
luck deterring deer using commercial or homemade repellents, but there is
a source of water (pond) for them on our farm.  We were given an harassment
permit to try to help the deer develop paths to the water other than through
our orchards, gardens, and berry fields, but that has been ineffective,
too. They tend to develop paths and stick to them. To keep the deer
out of those areas with fruit trees, our only real solution has been 10
ft. fencing.  Eight-ft high fencing still enabled them to jump in, since
there was a slight slope, and they were obviously motivated.  We added the
black mesh deer fencing above 4-ft fencing, along with sturdy gates (one
must remember to shut them!), and finally have some peace.  One may be able
to have a fence of less height if there are bushes planted against the fence
(both sides are better) to prevent them from jumping - they have to be able
to clear the bushes' widths as well as the height of the fence. Of course,
it takes time to grow a barrier like that. The deer tend to avoid small
fenced areas that they must judge they cannot easily get into or out of,
and that has worked well for some of our raised garden beds, but orchards
aren't going to be that small.  We tried surrounding individual, newly
planted trees that were somewhat isolated, but the deer have often been
able to break the trees off at the ground by tipping over the supports,
no matter how strong they seemed. Fortunately, the deer fencing isn't
terribly obvious.
Good luck with keeping deer away from those precious apple trees.
Erin

One thing I know will work is mountain lion urine or urine from another
predator


You can buy the mountain lion urine online.

I visited the Cider Research Station at Sees in France a number of years
ago . In their statement of purpose they included research on chemical
thinning for biennialism.
At that time they stated flatly that they had failed to find any
chemical treatement that lessened biennialism in their varieties.

Bruce,
It seems you did not get any answer to your post...
The reason is that most of us here are rather reluctant to add "things" in
our cider. Actually, if you feel you need to add things, it is probably
because you don't have the right apples to start with. So, the most useful
suggestion I could give you would be to start exploring to find apples that
will give you enough sugar and flavor so you won't feel the need anymore to
add things!


In general, commercially grown eating apples have a very low sugar content
and little flavor and are unfit for good cider. And this is not only a
question of variety as eating apples can become excellent cider apples
under different (i.e. non commercial, low yield, no fertilisation) cultural
practices. Climate, soil, terroir also have an influence on the quality.
Often, apples gathered from an abandoned orchard would be of better quality
for cider. You need to explore, gather apples here and there, make juice
tests for sugar and acidity, and there are good chances you will find some
trees that will give you good apples for cider - there are some everywhere,
they just need to be found!

I live in NW Wisconsin, deep in the heart of deer country.  I personally
don't have deer problems because I have 2 very active dogs that are
constantly on patrol, but my Mom's husband does.  He is an avid Hosta
gardener, and he has had significant problems with them destroying his
plants.  Deer absolutely love the taste of Hostas!!!  He uses Liquid
Fence and swears by it.  Since he started using it, the deer no longer
touch his hostas.  We've also used it to stop our male dog from "marking"
my wife's shrubs.  You're right about the smell though, best not to use
it too close to the house.
