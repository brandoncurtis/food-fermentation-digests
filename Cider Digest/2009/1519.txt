In Digest #1517 Derek asked about Spanish cider.


An Australian cidermaker, Tony Thorogood, had some days in Spain
looking at sidra in late 2007.
There is a mention of the visit on his website:
http://www.thorogoods.com.au/a-world-of-cider
and similarly the Spanish trip gets a mention on his report to the
Churchill Trust (the funding body):
http://www.churchilltrust.com.au/res/File/Fellow_Reports/Thorogood%20Anthony%202
007.pdf


Both reports cover other European countries and the US.
There is an email link on the Thorogood website if you'd like to ask
Tony for more detail.
