Subject: Is it too late for copper?
From: Jason MacArthur <rotread@localnet.com>

I recently sampled an unbottled 30 gallon barrel of cider from last
years pressing.  It has, I hate to say, a cooked cabbage flavor
which, I venture to guess, is not what most people want when they
open a bottle of cider.
I am curious about trying to clean this up with a little copper, but
am not sure if it is too late.  I have heard that copper is more
effective against the "rotten egg" smell than the "cabbagy" smell,
although I believe that both are produced by the same compounds at
different points in their life cycles.
I am not really sure where to start with copper and would appreciate
any advice.
