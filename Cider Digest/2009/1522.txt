re: yeast musings


Andrew,
Regarding your question about yeast cell counts before bottling, all
of the commercial cidermakers in the Pays d'Auge region of Normandy
(and, I'm surmising, elsewhere) do this. However, they send samples
to a lab "for analysis." The amount of native yeast remaining and
nutrient level determine how much commercial yeast they add at
bottling for the final conditioning.  I don't yet know their cut-off
point. That's the one question I forgot to ask on our last trip.  One
cidermaker gave me the name of his consultant in Caen.  I'll see if
he'll give me those numbers.

Hello,
I am new to this hobby but very interested. I have begun my search for cider
apples in California and have been having an extremely difficult time
finding any. I understand this is a primarily UK based digest, but if anyone
knows of any cider apples on the West Coast of the US I would really
appreciate the help. Thank you for your time and assistance,


Patrick

We got hit with a late frost here in NW PA that put the kibosh on apples
here in Warren county.  Is there anyone within 50 or so miles of Warren,
PA that will have apples suitable for cider this fall?  I can pick since
I have my harvest bags.
