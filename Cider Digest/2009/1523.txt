I was interested to read Andrew Lea's last contributal "musing" on the
different preferment of yeasts for glucose & fructose.  I was once told
that apple yeasts were decidedly against converting lactose sugar. At the
time lactose was available at very low cost from the local milk factory,
and I did my own musing as to whether this could be a means of producing
a "naturally " sweet cider without all the trouble of kieving or risk of
secondary fermentation.


Does anyone know the chemistry on this, or have any experience?

Regarding Patrick Philbin's quest for Cider Apples:


 I wonder if you grow crab apples in the U.S.  I believe many of our
bitter sharps and bitter sweets are derived from crabs, and the tanin
content might give your cider a more genuine flavour if mixed with dessert
or culinary varieties.

Dear All,
Pasteurization of perry and cider.
Would perry be pasteurized at a higher temperature than apple cider?


Our ciders are pasteurized in the range 186 to 190 degrees F and held at
this temperature for 30seconds. (No problem.)
Perry seems to hold on to the yeasts (not killed) at this temperature.
Would a higher pasteuirzed temperature ruin the taste?


Thanks

Hi all, sorry for the late posting.  The Vermont Grape and Wine Council
and Vermont Tree Fruit Growers Association in conjunction with the VT
Agency of Agriculture are sponsoring Peter Mitchell's cider course to be
offered in August 11-14.  Sorry about the late notice but we were
looking to fill it first with VGWC/VTFGA folks.  At last notice there
were about ten slots left.  Because of this industry sponsorship tuition
for the course is only $100.  Please contact Steve Justis at VT Agency
of Ag for signups.
