Uncle Ben forgot the Hughes (or Hewes) Crab. George Washington's favorite
cider apple, low tannin I agree but a very complex taste added to a blend.
I have Chestnut crab as well, haven't tried to use it in cider ... darn
things are too good eating out of hand.. jccampb

John mentioned that interest in cideries is starting in Ontario.
Travelling acroos the province last fall we came across a cidery on the tip
of Prince Edward County which was making some interesting ciders . They
mentioned that the source of the trees was Merridale Cider on Vancouver
Island which would probably be Hereford and Somerset varieties since these
are what Merridale has mostly.
During a stay in England I found the area around the town of Hereford a
good base for exploring cider. I stayed a Broome Farm B&B which actually
produced cider and the owners were an excellent and friendly source of
infoprmation.

Hello--


I have enough bittersweets this year that I'd like to try another
keeve experiment (small batch, probably 3-5 gallons.)  I know in
years past, there was some Klercidre PME that I think Gary Awdey had
acquired and was making available.  I understand there is also a US
company, Valley Research, that apparently manufactures it, but I
don't know if it's available in hobbyist quantities.  The idea of
ordering anything from Standia in France at this late date seems
daunting.


Does anyone have a source for PME or a small quantity I could
purchase?  Failing that, what are the chances I can get a good
chapeau brun using just the CaCL?


Thanks,
