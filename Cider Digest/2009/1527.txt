I cannot comment on the availability in North America but worth noting
that Valley Enzymes were bought last year by the Dutch group DSM, who
are also the people who already make the Rapidase CME sold in the French
'Klercidre' kits. One imagines they are likely to consolidate their
product range. Also this year a friend of mine in the food enzyme
business in the UK told me that Valley probably never made the PME
themselves, but were most likely buying it in from Japan.


Anyway, my point of substance is to say that you can (sometimes) get a
good chapeau brun by using calcium chloride alone. It all rather depends
on how much native PME activity is in the apple itself (this was of
course the way it was done traditionally for centuries and it worked
well enough for the most part at least in some apples). To maximise
success, I  would suggest milling the apples and then leaving the pulp
to macerate overnight before pressing out and adding the CaCl2. The
reason for this is (a) to maximise native PME activity (which may be
membrane bound) and (b) to extract sufficient pectin from the cell walls
that it will give a good chapeau with the added calcium later.

There was a short item on BBC radio yesterday, saying that the experts have
now concluded that ALL apple varieties have originated from a spot somewhere
in northen Kurgestan (kyrgyzstan ?) .  It is about to be ruined by mineral
or oil exploitation.

I have a half dozen perry pear trees just now starting to produce.
Knowing nothing about these pears, should they be picked on the green
side and ripened off the tree like Bartlett or left to hang until ripe?
Thanks for any source of perry info. Jack Feil
