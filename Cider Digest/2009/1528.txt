I spoke with Valley Research a couple of times about getting PME.  The
minimum quantity was 5 gallons - way more than I'd ever use.  They don't
know of anyone repacking it in smaller containers.  The other issue was
finding the right person - PME isn't in the product line they offer for
wineries.  It's in the processed fruit line - where I get the impression it
helps maintain firmness in things like strawberries.  Anyway, the first
question I get is 'Is PME even legal for wine?'.  A concern for commercial
wineries - PME isn't specifically approved.  But pectinase activity is.  Not
exactly the same - but would regulators notice/care?


Anyway, I also checked with Scott Labs. No luck there, either.

Jack, my experience is that you can't treat perry pears like apples, or
common pears.  They are so dense that the ethylene gas (aging hormone) can't
get out.  Nearly every perry pear turns soft mushy brown from the core out.
A couple form little tiny spots of brown throughout the flesh and then go
all at once.  The soft brown flesh releases a LOT of juice very easily, and
is very pungent. However, I don't like it.  I pick up traces of it in some
UK perries.


In my trees, there is a fairly narrow window between when the fruit is
fragrant and nicely colored and just a little bit softer than green fruit -
and when it starts to go from the middle out.  I check the trees every few
days in mid September.  Luckily, the trees seems mostly to ripen at once.


Thorn pears will turn too mushy to be picked and not fall from the tree -
they're just limp sack of pulp hanging from the branch.

> DOES THE CIDER HAVE TO TAST LIKE UNSWETENED APPLE JUICE?


Think of cider like you think of wine.  Just as wine is
fermented grape juice, cider is fermented apple juice.
Wine doesn't taste like unsweetened grape juice; the
fermenting and aging give different and unique flavors.
Same for cider.  Cider tastes like, well, cider.  In
some ciders the background flavor of apple juice can be
detected, but in my experience it usually is not present.

re: PME availability


I bought a quart of PME from Valley Research two years ago for four
times the going wholesale price, because of the small quantity.   A
short time later, they sent me a letter indicating they would no
longer sell PME at any quantities smaller than "industrial,"  at any
price.  In other words, it's no longer available in this country as
far as I know. I'd look at French sources.  If you need a small
quantity, I can send you a bit.

re: Mt. Gilead cider presses


I just bought a 10-ton Mt. Gilead cider press.  I know Mt. Gilead was
a major American producer of presses in the late 19th century and
first part of 20th.  But that's all I know.  Does anyone have any
info on these presses and the company?  Everything's amazingly
functional on this press.  I'm just curious.
