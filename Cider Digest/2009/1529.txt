Dear Cider Digesters,


For pity's sake, will someone (someone with more time on his/her hands than
I have right now) contact Crosby and Baker and get them to start packaging
small bottles of PME?


I don't know why it would be more difficult for them to package this than
it is regular pectic enzyme, which they carry. And they could certainly
purchase an "industrial quantity" and mark it up accordingly. Somebody
needs to convince them that there is a market among home (and small
commercial) cidermakers for this stuff.


Just a thought -- otherwise we're all going to be complaining about no
supply or scrounging/begging it for years.

Tim et al.-


I have a small collection of various catalogs that show the equpiment that
the Mt. Gilead company put out.  Maybe it would be best to drop me a photo
(off list) and I can see if I can find a like one in the catalogs I have.


Thanks

Hello,


Does anyone know of good American commerical cider?


An orchard around Nescopeck, PA sold 5% alcohol cider one summer. It was
very good and made from their apples, but limited supply.


A fair number of wineries sell apple wine with 10-15%. You can also order
Mead with 11-16% alcohol on the internet. Unfortunately, I like only 2-5%
alcohol, because otherwise the alcohol overcomes the apple or honey taste.


I don't like Woodchuk cider or Strongbow very much because they are too
much like Wine Coolers.


A few months ago I had Harpoon cider. It tasted ok and was labelled that
it was made from natural fermented apples. What do you think.


What do you think?
