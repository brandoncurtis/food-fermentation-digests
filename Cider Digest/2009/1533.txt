re: Andrew's musing on keeving and PME


In his long discussion of defecation, or keeving, Warcollier
(Charlie) never mentions PME, presumably because it had not yet been
isolated.  Temperature is crucial in his discussion, as it still is.
All the cidermakers we've visited in Normandy have chilling tanks.
One interesting thing Warcollier mentions in an aside is adding pear
juice to initiate defecation.

Subject: Zambelli fruit grinder short review

This isn't a sales pitch, but it seems like a good place to do a product
review for folks looking to make an investment.


I bought a Zambelli Mulimix grinder sight unseen, so I was pretty
anxious when I dropped in my first basket of fruit.  I can say that the
grinder does a great job and doesn't even begin to choke on the fruit.
The claim is 800 Kg/hour, and I believe it.  I got mine from Gino Pinto
(www.ginopinto.com) in NY for about $1,000 delivered.

The Mulimax claims 1,500 Kg/hour.


This are 220V products, and mine came with a short European plug
attached.  You will need to replace the cord with a North American (or
wherever you are) plug to make it work.  There are a lot of 220V plugs
in the U.S., so I opted for a 30A 4-wire generator twist-lock
connection, and made an adapter to convert it to a 3 pin welder style
connector since we have a jack in our garage.  I put a 30' cord on it to
give me some flexibility on where I would put it in the garage, or just
outside on the driveway.


The downside of some of the 3-wire connectors is that they do not have a
ground.  Although the neutral is technically connected to ground at the
service entrance, I recommend grounding the grinder.


Clean-up is easy.  Two bolts hold the feed horn in place, and removing
them gives you full access to the blades and screen.  Running water in
the horn shakes loose most of the leftover stuff, and opening the
grinder lets you pull out bits and pieces trapped behind joining surfaces.


All in all, a good investment that will take me a very long time to outgrow.

Well it works!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u0RW-HzHK8


I'm thinking that the basic configuration could press up to 4 bushels at
once.
