Subject: Encapsulated Yeast

I tried using encapsulated yeast several years ago to make a semisweet
cider, but lost interest in the project and it went dry even after the
encapsulated yeast sox were removed. This may be the same problem Charles is
encountering. If I remember correctly the encapsulated yeast sox are to be
shaken on a regular basis to remove the accumulating CO2, a task that I did
not follow diligently.


It does occur to me that there are encapsulated MLF products that would be
useful to reduce excess acidity or make some interesting ciders. I am
tempted but unsure if I want to blend a MFL cider in my standard product,
the MFL ciders I have had are unique but over-the-top for many consumers.
Has anyone worked with them?

Greetings to the forum!


I am hoping to gain a little insight about sulfur aromas today.  We
often observe strong sulfury aromatics during the early stages of
fermentation that dissipate toward the end of the primary.  Once or
twice we've noticed that the sulfur aroma lingered in the cider longer
than a few days, but it generally does not.  When we have noted it in
the past we have scrubbed it out prior to packaging with little trouble.
Recently, we made a batch that seemed to be fine aroma-wise, but shortly
after packaging displayed a noticeable SO2 aroma.  All indications at
this point are that the cider is microbiologically sound: I do not
believe this to be a contaminant microorganism, but rather a
fermentation note.  In addition, the aroma manifested very soon after
packaging: less than 24 hours later.


Anyone care to shed a little light on this phenomenon?  Is it possible
that the sulfur wasn't present pre-packaging, or did the tasters just
miss it?  Is it likely to dissipate in the package if held for a week or
two?  Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts.


Cheers,

Hi Ed,


My wife and I just returned from touring cideries in south west England.


It seems to be a common practice there to recycle used wine and spirits
barrels as fermentation and/or storage vessels for cider and perry.
Sometimes that fact makes it onto the label and is made a selling feature.


I recall trying a perry that had acquired a pinkish hue as a consequence of
being fermented in a red wine barrel. Whether flavor is affected (for better
or worse) is probably always a matter of opinion.


There are of course special cleaning and sanitizing considerations with used
wood barrels of any kind.


Regards, John Mott

The only place I know of that has true cider apples near Toronto is The
County Cider Company in Picton.  They use them in their Waupoos cider.
I enquired and they do not have any extras available to sell.  Cider
apple trees are available from Siloam Orchards near Uxbridge.  But you
already mentioned you aren't interested in growing trees.

Subject: stone and trash removal from harvested Perry Pears,

Dear All,
Right, we all know that perry pears sink in water, so washing them in a
tank to remove stones, rocks etc is not a good idea, before conveying to
the mill for milling.
So is there a way to remove the trash/stones without costing the earth on
a very expensive piece of kit.
How do other cider/perry companies achieve this?
Any help would be appreciated .


Thanks

For people in the mid-Atlantic region, a heads-up that there is a new
orchard near Frederick, Maryland which is selling cider apples (the
apples, not trees).  There was an article in the Washington Post last
week about them  -- http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10
/13/AR2009101300407.html
  -- and I went out over the weekend and picked up a few bushels.  I
am now excited to try my first 100% European cider apple batch of
cider.  Rob Miller, the owner, occasionally posts here.


Right now I am waiting for a keeve on a mostly-Gala batch of cider to
finish; the pectin layer is now about 1/3 of the overall depth and it
usually compresses to 1/4 or 1/5 by the end.  This is 20hr macerated/
pressed apples plus PME plus CaCl2 plus a bit of malic acid due to the
low acidity of the Galas; no yeast (or sulphite) but its already going
naturally.  I am probably going to ferment it separately and try
blending with the European batch post-ferment.

I am wondering if there will be some of you cider afficionados that will be
at CiderDays in 2 weeks and also plan to be in Grand Rapids Michigan for
the 2009 Great Lakes Cider & Perry Association's Competition on December
11-12?


I am searching for someone who would be kind enough to take 2 bottles that
I would bring at CiderDays, and bring them to GLINTCAP, as sending them
from Quebec is not very handy, and I will not be able to attend the
competition. I would only have 2 bottles for an entry.


If interested, you may respond off-digest.
Thanks,
Claude

I'm converting two HDPE conical tanks made for biodiesel for use as
fermenters.


I'm interested in hearing from anyone else that may have experience with
this.  I've had to opt out of stainless triclover fittings and go with
all plastic.
