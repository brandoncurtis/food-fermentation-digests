In my experience, it is wise to do copper trials as soon as the cider has
stabilized. More often than not a small amount of copper will improve the
quality. Even when H2S levels are too low to be perceptible as a sulfur
aroma, they diminish the fruitiness of the cider (something that will
become apparent during the trials). Additionally those low levels can
be a serious problem if they become sulfides or disulfides (compounds
which have an even more offensive odor) after interacting with alcohol
and oxygen. This could be one reason why a cider that appears to smell
fine at bottling may develop a sulfur related smell after aging for a time.

Good afternoon all, first-time poster here in S. Illinois.


I am first-time cider maker and intermediate homebrewer....I am
seeking some advice re: batches 3-5 of my recent cider experiment.


Update:
Batches 1 & 2 (WLP775 & Red Star Coite de Blanc; OG 1.042; pasteurized
cider) fermented out to about 1.001 and taste dry and tart. Those were
racked to CO2 purged secondaries and are sitting in my basement at
about 65F.


Batches 3-5 (each 2-gallons; unpasteurized; OG 1.053) are sitting at
55F. On 10/20 I pitched WLP300 and WLP775 (along with 1/4 tsp yeast
nutrient) each into a 2-gallon batch of cider I had treated 24-hours
prior with sodium metabisulfite according to Andrew Lea's
instructions. Today is day 5 and there is still no apparent activity.
Batch #5 I half-dosed with sodium metabisulifte and intended to let go
naturally (again in accordance with Andrew Lea's instructions.)


As of yesterday there was still no activity so I warmed up my
fermentation chamber to 60F.  Batch 5 spontaneously started
fermenting.  Batches 3 & 4 still had not activity.  Today I warmed up
to 65F.  The WLP775 batch appears to be showing slight signs of
fermentation.  The WLP300 still shows no activity.


That's the story for now. I am hoping the cider has not suffered
during the 12-day lag time.


All advice is welcome and I look forward to the forum.


Cheers,

I had to depart from my usual cider making procedure this fall and I'm
wondering if it will make any difference.
Last week I pressed 27 gal. of my usual mix of Liberty, Jonathon, local
crab and a few unknown apple varieties that I've used successfully in
the past.
My usual procedure is to test and taste and make what ever adjustments
I think necessary by adding measured amounts of acid blend , powdered
tannin, a bit of yeast nutrient and additional fermentables if needed.


I use Potassium Metabisulphite at a rate of 75 ppm for 24 hrs. before
pitching my yeast.


This time, however, I needed to sulphite before I made those
adjustments and at the 24 hr. point I was unable to proceed.
I didn't want to risk letting the cider sit too long so I added my
yeast, Red Star Cote des Blancs, at the recommended rate of 5 grams to
5 gallons.


Fermentation began in 12 hrs. and has been moving along nicely at a
cool 62 F.


Now , nearly a week later, I was finally able to add those adjustments
in the middle of a fully active ferment.


Are there likely to be any adverse affects from this late addition  ?


Thanks for any thoughts,


Brad

I've been receieving this for a few months and am dazzled by the content
although admittedly, seldom able to take the time to read thoroughly.  I
now find myself in need of input.  For the first time, I've put up a
carboy of perry.  I didn't strain the juice.  I've never bothered to
with cider and assumed that there was no need, but now I relize that the
small particulate in the pear may be causing a somewhat
muscillagenous(sp?) texture.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thank you.
