Replying to Ice Cider yeast question:

I am a home cider maker trying to create an ice cider by using succesive
freeze-thaw cycles on my freshly squeezed apple juice. I will then
ferment the resulting apple juice concentrate in the normal way. I will
probably start out with a S.G around 1.15 or so. I would like the cider
to stop fermenting on its own, but not to dryness, rather leaving behind
a relatively sweet, thick, appley apertif (similar to the ice ciders one
can find in Quebec).


Can anyone recommend an appropriate commercial yeast? If anyone else has
tried this, do you have any pointers?


Thanks


Joe"


Joe,


I made an Ice Cider in a similar fashion last year.  Started with 5 gal at 15
Brix, froze to 2 gal, 28 Brix.  Used QA23 from More Beer.  Fermented down to 1
Brix.  Might not be as sweet as you want, but the yeast left a GREAT apple
profile.

Hello Joe,
I still haven't done it yet, but here are a few ideas...
We have to keep in mind that if the juice is rich in nutrients (i.e.
Nitrogen), there is little that can be done to have the fermentation stop
by itself before dryness. Most ice cider makers in Quebec have to stop the
fermentation chemically, by filtration or by temperature treatment at the
moment they choose.


One thing that could be tried is a keeve that would make the concentrated
juice poor in Nitrogen and in yeast nutrient. You would then have a slower
fermentation that may get "stuck" at some SG. If you haven't done a keeve
yet, I would suggest you try it on normal juice before doing it on
concentrated juice! Note that some keeved ciders that I have done (from
unconcentrated juice) compared favourably with any ice cider on all points
except that the alcohol was lower on my keeved cider.


There are some yeasts that are known to leave some residual sweetness
(Riesling for example) but I doubt the r.s. could be high enough this way.
Usually, the r.s. from these yeasts is just enough to give a "dry to
fruity" taste and not a real sweet and rich feeling. I am doing a
side-by-side test this year with 3 yeasts including a Riesling type yeast -
unfortunately I won't have the result of this in time for your ice cider.

This question is for all you cider adventurers out there:
I am fermenting, among other experiments, a carboy of cider with some
cherries in it.  Five gallons of juice plus 1 lb 10 oz of wild
cherries, frozen and then thawed, equals an interesting beige goo
that both floats near the surface (with the cherries) and sinks to
the bottom of the carboy.  It seems to be fermenting just fine and
tastes like I think it should after about 15 days.
Has anyone seen or heard of this phenomenon?  I wonder if it will
eventually disappear or if I will have to loose a lot of volume to
this beast, or perhaps it will simply ruin the drink altogether....


thanks
scott

I've found a very inexpensive source for medical grade HEPA filters.
Has anyone experimented with putting a HEPA filter into the bung on a
tapped barrel to keep out the biologicals while tapping the contents?  I
was thinking of swapping the airlock with a filter when racking to
ensure that the contents were not contaminated during the transfer.  Any
comments would be appreciated!
