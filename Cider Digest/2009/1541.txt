Scott,
You might be experiencing a petic gel.
See a discussion I had on the Cider Workshop about this:
http://groups.google.com/group/cider-workshop/browse_frm/thread/a5e72bee73ba
98e0#
You will also see a picture at this link. In that case the gel is at the
bottom, but sometimes there is some in the top also. Usually, the gel at
the top is kept there by the rising bubbles and it will eventually sink
when fermentation stops. With time it settles, but will not disappear.
Claude

Re: Ice Cider


I've made quite a few ciders with Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast because I wanted
the residual sugars. It tends to work very well but I can't speak of how
it would work with your "concentrate". Just my .02 cents.


Cheers,
