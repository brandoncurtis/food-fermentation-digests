I have done some home cidermaking in glass carboys but I am looking to go
small scale commercial (about 1,000 gallons to start).  Where can I start
looking for some used small scale commercial wine/cider equipment?

There was an interesting, 1-page article in 'WW II' magazine's
January/Febuary Issue.  It was talking about a horticulturalist who worked
disarming unexploded bombs in London during World War II.  It details John
Hudson's work to develop methods of dealing with booby trapped fuses and
his own bravery in the field.  The very last sentence led me to do a bit
of poking.


The last sentence of that article reads:


'After the war Hudson resumed his horticultural career, becoming and expert
on fruit production and a teacher, and mentioning his war time exploits
to his students or colleagues only, one recalled, on those rare occations
when he had had a few glasses of the potent pear cider produced at the
experiment station he directed.'


A quick check of the web shows he was director of Long
Ashton from 1967-75.  A detailed obit can be found at:

Thanks for running the CD, Mr. Dunn.
