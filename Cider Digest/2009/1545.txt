Like honey, I wouldn't touch Chinese imported apples or apple juice for
cider.


Caveat emptor really applies here. Pesticides, lead etc.... why invite a
potential problem.

Good day,


Quick question ref Ale yeast and cider.  Is Nottingham or the other common
ale yeasts suplite tolerant like the wine yeasts?


I recently made a small half carboy batch of common farmhouse cider with
local farm juice - no additives, no SO2 - only pectic enzyme, yeast nutrient
and a pack of Nottingham Ale yeast.  Worked fine and, although is slow to
stop, it brought an original SG of 1.060 down to 1.003 no probs.  I decided
to try a full batch but added tannin, acid blend, yeast neutrient, pectic
enzyme and SO2 (1 campden per imp gal).  Then the same Nottingham Ale yeast.
3 days and no action at a temp of 66 to 70 degree F or 18 to 20 C.  Two
other cider batchs with the exact same additives fermented well with LALVIN
EC 1118 and V 1116.


Was wondering if the suphite was blocking the ferment with Nottingham Ale
yeast as beer is not sulphited.  Thinking of waiting a few more days and
pitching EC 1118 if it doesn't start to get it going.


Thanks in advance for any advice.


Cheers,


Steve

Casey,
Welcome in the club of the slow guys!
If I calculate, you get a drop of 16 points of SG in 33 days, so roughly
half a SG point a day. You may compare your data with, for example, my 2008
late blend, started Nov 9 2008 at SG 1.060, by Dec 7, it was at SG 1.043,
end of April at 1.020, August 1.003, and finally bottled last October at
1.002! In my opinion, the slow batches are always the best ones. As of
racking, I usually start my ciders in a large plastic bucket (7 gals) and
do a racking to glass carboy after a couple of weeks of fermentation when
foaming has stopped. After that I don't do any racking until bottling time.
Sometimes I also get some pectic gel but I don't worry about this. So, in
my opinion, your cider is starting just fine.

Stick with your inclination. Be patient. Let it go to SG < 1.005 before
you rack (unless it sticks really firmly before that and you want to
rack it a couple of times to get a naturally sweet cider). The yeast
lees will not be a problem.

Interesting. My guess is that the commercial Jonagolds have much higher
nutrients (nitrogen), which is why they finish so quickly.

A recent scientific article
http://www.scientificsocieties.org/JIB/papers/2006/G-2006-1023-457.pdf
states that "Apple cider in China is usually made from 'Fuji',
'Starking', 'Gala', or 'Ralls' apples". and that the reason for this is
to use up surplus dessert fruit.  There is quite a bit of scientific
work coming out of China on cider now (most of it pay per view) but none
of it ever uses 'cider' apples that i can recall.


So I think the short answer is 'no'. There is no cultural history of
cider production in China until the last few years so no effort would
have been made to select or even to plant imported cider cultivars, I think.

Subject: cold temps in the cider room
From: seth jones <sethjones@earthlink.net>
Date: Tue, 22 Dec 2009 10:21:43 -0500


I've been using a new room in my basement to ferment my ciders and
cysers this year. I've got 12 carboys there of different mixed blends.
I'd had good luck keeping it at around 45F until last week when temps
in Eastern NY plummeted. It's a weekend place and when I turned up the
temp was at 38F. No activity in the bubblers. I'm traveling for the
holidays and won't be able to get that heat up (it will stay about
38-40F) until after the New Year when I'll add more insulation and an
electric heater. My question (finally): Will the yeast restart on it's
own? Should i add a little nutrient to give it some breakfast? Any
other advice? Thanks in advance.

Subject: Results of the 5th Annual Great Lakes International Cider & Perry Compe
From: gawdey@att.net

The Great Lakes Cider & Perry Association is pleased to announce results
of the 5th Annual Great Lakes International Cider & Perry Competition.
The competition was held at the Amway Grand Hotel in Grand Rapids, Michigan,
on December 12, 2009.


With 81 commercial entries and 94 noncommercial entries this is the largest
Pro-Am fermented cider competition in North America and one of the largest
in the world.  The competition is open to nineteen categories of fermented
beverages made from apple or pear.  Entries came from across much of North
America, from Washington to Nova Scotia and New Hampshire to North Carolina.
Open to international entries, this year's competition saw over a dozen
commercial entries from cidermakers who have previously distinguished
themselves in well respected English competitions.


In the commercial division ten gold medals, twenty-five silver and thirty-one
bronze medals were awarded.  A gold medal and Best of Show went to Uncle
John's Fruit House Winery of St. Johns, Michigan, for its entry in the common
cider category, Uncle John's Hard Cider.   Highlighting some of the apple
varieties that excel in Michigan, this cider is a blend of distinguished
old North American apple varieties such as Winter Banana, Winesap and
Northern Spy, with a light added touch of McIntosh.  Uncle John's also
took gold for its entry in the cyser category and for its apple/cherry
cider in the fruit cider category.


A gold medal and Best of Show Honorable Mention went to Warwick Valley
Winery and Distillery of Warwick, New York, for its pommeau category entry,
American Fruits Apple Liquor.


Gold medals also went to Westcott Bay Cider of Friday Harbor, Washington,
in the English cider category for its Traditional Dry Cider; Aspall Cyders
of Suffolk, England, for its Aspall Organic Cider entered in the French
cider category; Snowdrift Cider Company of East Wenatchee, Washington,
for its Semi Dry Cider entered in the New England cider category; Eden Ice
Cider Company of West Charleston, Vermont, for its Eden-Calville Blend
in the Prefermentation Intensified category (also known as Ice Cider);
Blackstar Farms of Suttons Bay, Michigan, for its Sirius Maple in the
Postfermentation Intensified (Pommeau) category; and to Vandermill Cider
of Spring Lake, Michigan, for its VanderMill NA in the competition's new
Nonalcoholic Sparkling Cider category.


In the noncommercial division twelve gold medals, twenty-one silver and
thirty-seven bronze medals were awarded.  A gold medal and Best of Show
went to Rick Young of Mount Vernon, Iowa, for his Methode Champenoise
Hard Cider.  Rick also took gold in the Common Cider category with his
Rocky Mountain Hard Cider.  Best of Show Honorable Mention and a gold medal
went to Eric Fouch of Caledonia, Michigan, for Going Polar, his entry in
the Specialty-Other category.  Eric also took a second gold medal in the
English Cider category for his Buck Fever.


In an impressive sweep that throws down a geographical gauntlet for home
cidermakers elsewhere the remaining gold medals in the noncommercial division
went to Michigan cidermakers.  Four gold medals went to Jeff Carlson of
Grand Rapids for his Westside Cyser '06, Westside Perry, Westside Cherry
Cider, and his Sweet Heat Jalapeno Cider.  Two gold medals went to Scott
Husted of Kalamazoo for his common cider and applewine.  Gold also went
to Karl Vernon of Livionia for his applewine and to Joe Margevicius of
Metamora for his specialty cider, Honey Ginger.
