Hello Cider Digest,


Has anyone used a hydropress?  We're thinking of purchasing one. It looks
like it might save a bit of labour but we are wondering whether the juice
yield will be as high as our rack and cloth press.

Several years ago Kristen decided that they were getting out of the hard
cider business.  She half-heartedly asked me if I had any interest in the
business but they were keeping the property and continuing to grow apples.


It's been a year or two since I talked to her but at that point they
were selling all their apples to a local guy to make apple soda out of.
Don't ask me what good cider apples did for making soda but he wanted them.
The apple buyer was the owner of Hot Lips Pizza (a local pizza chain).
I have tried the apple soda (available a few places around town and at
the pizza shops) and I couldn't have told you it was made out of anything
other than standard dessert apples.


Drop me a note off list and I can give you the contact info that I have
for Kristen.

Hello All,


I?ve been ?lurking? on the forum for 6 months.  Reading all I can!  I made a
few batches this past fall.  I enjoy a typical pint of draught cider, so
that?s what I make.  I force carbonate into a keg.  I agree with all the
forum complaints about watered down 6 pack cider from the big producers.  I
dream of starting my own Craft Cidery in Ontario.  I?m trying to make a list
of equipment I would need to start a Craft Cidery that can produce kegs of
draught cider  I?m asking for suggestions for my list.
