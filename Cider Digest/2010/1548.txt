Neighbours of mine use a hobby model hydropress made by Speidel in
Germany and sold into the UK by Vigo.  See

It works fine and is a dream to clean without racks and only one cloth.
However, to get good yields with apple the pulp must be quite fine and
in the case of this model there is a dedicated Speidel knife mill which
is highly recommended. Without it I understand the yields are not good.


For the hobbyist with a fairly deep pocket it is ideal and probably much
better value and easier to use and store than an equivalent size rack
and cloth press. For commercial use I'm not so sure. The unit charge of
pulp is quite small and it could become tedious compared to a larger
pack press.

If a progressive decline it is unlikely to be your laboratory skills. It
could be degradation of the iodine solution but I think that would make
the figures go up, not down. The standard answer to your question is
that although most sulfite is bound (see SO2 page and spreadsheet on my
website) some quite small portion of added sulfite is not bound but is
irreversibly oxidised to sulfate (which stays in solution). The extent
of this will depend on the presence of oxidizing enzymes in the few
minutes after pressing, plus general access to in situ oxidising agents
such as peroxide thereafter.  You do not say when you made your
measurements (before, during or after fermentation) but here are some
figures reported by Len Burroughs on a cider juice at Long Ashton in
1958. Do yours show the same pattern?


Time           Total SO2 ppm


5 min                 174
2 hrs                 173
4 hrs                 166
22 hrs                170
3 days                162
4 days                163


Fermentation began at 4 days and reached SG 1.002 at 16 days. Thereafter
Len recorded total figures as follows:


16 days                160
Centrifuged            161
Overnight at 0C        157
Carbonated / bottled    156
Pasteurised            147
Stored 4 weeks         137
Stored 14 months        125


Note that like all truthful experimentalists Len recorded the actual
figures even when they apparently increased (due to experimental error)!

Kristen,
We have a small (micro ?) commercial orchard that we just added a
cidermill to this past year. Because of our scale and the need for
flexibility with our space we went with a Lanceman water powered
press from OESCO.
After one season I am very happy with the way the press/grinder set
up worked.
The press works very well. A lot of it I think is thanks to the
grinder. I bought the small grinder that OESCO  (I am not associated
with them) makes that does a fantastic job.  The yield varied this
year between 2.5-3.5 gallons per bushel depending on the cultivar,
how long they had been sitting (sweating) and time of year.
It is easy to clean, there is a cloth that lines the tub that just
pulls out when you tilt it to clean it. From there you just rinse the
whole thing off and thats it. Like all clothes it can be a pain to
get all of the tiny bits out of it but unlike a rack press, there is
only the one cloth.
  I t didn't seem to that there were a lot of options out there that
would be efficient for for a small commercial cider mill. It needed
to be affordable but it also needed to work and not waste allot of
time and apples.   I liked the size, portability, ease of cleaning
and pressing ability of this one. As well as the price to juice
ratio. We made probably around 600 + gallons this year with it this
season, and the max that we would press would be around 1000 gallons
given the size of our orchard, so scale wise it suits us well.
good luck,
Steve

If you mean a 'standard' grape bladder press then I would not suggest
that. I have tried those and they do not work as well.

Kristen asked about hydropresses. I used one for several yars and found
it quick to operate and producing a yield as good  as rack and cloth. It
was easy to clean and keep sterile. However I found myself reluctant to
use it finally and went back to rack and cloth.
The screen on mine is designed for grapes and apple pulp came through
requiring the use of a liner always.
Discharging spent pulp meant waiting while the bladder drained and removing
the screen single handed was sometimes heavy work . Removing the spent pulp
could also be messy .
It did not work well with partial loads so it made it difficult to do a
small batch of a single variety apple.
Filling a load could be messier sometimes depending on the condition of the
pulp.
Some of these awkwardnesses could be got around by using air pressure - mine
was water operated.
Filling and emptying the bladder with air could quicker and less messy .
There is provision on these to allow for air adaptation although a
compressor would then be required.
One surprise was the efficiency of the bladder . Because it has a large
area against the pulp compared to a top pressure plate it was able to press
a load very quickly even with 50psi water pressure produced by my well
pump. I use a 20ton jack press and it does no better either in speed or
yield
