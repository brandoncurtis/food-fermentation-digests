Words fail me. The coexistence of death and Terry Maloney seemed
improbable to say the least. Will drink a bottle of the remaining West
County cider this evening with cider friends, remembering him, his
zeal for real cider, and his comfortable wise ways. I will always see
his sparkling eye in the gleam of well-crafted cider.

This is very sad news.  Terry was a gracious gentle soul.  A true artist
and an inspiration to more than a generation of cidermakers. He will be
deeply missed by me and many others but by no one more than Judith and
his son Field. If you would like to send them a note, their address is:

Terry was truly unique and original in his approach to cidermaking and his
contribution to promoting cider. He will be missed.

I am writing on behalf of myself and the CiderDays committee, on which I
served with Terry and Judith for the past 3 years. As a young grower and
cider-maker, Terry was an incredibly inspiring person to meet and have
the chance to speak with. Our paths crossed frequently, and he was truly
a kind man, a most knowledgeable and skilled artisan of his craft. Terry
and Judith had the vision to establish the CiderDay festival over 15 years
ago. Through the years they have put an enormous amount of energy into
their winery and the festival as well. Introducing hundreds of attendees
to cider over the years, and drawing far more devotees and homebrewers,
Terry saw the festival grow from a smattering of orchards and workshops
to the large-scale event of the past few years. Several hundred attendees
flood Franklin County each November to taste, learn, and share all things
apple and cider. This festival will continue to thrive in Terry's absence,
but it will never feel quite the same. The gentle voice, quick wit, and
passion to share knowledge with colleagues will be gone but not forgotten.


As I write this I am savoring a glass of Redfield, part of a case presented
to the C.D. committee at our last meeting. A fitting tribute to a great man.

 From the eastern side of the pond, I'd like to add my voice to the many
others who will no doubt be paying tribute to Terry.  I didn't know him
for very long, and we first met in person when I was invited by him and
others to be a guest participant at the Franklin County Cider Days in
2005. Within just a few minutes of meeting him and his wife Judith at
their home, I was swept up by his hospitality and enthusiasm for what he
was doing and planning to do in his cidery and his orchard, which he
showed off with justifiable pride. After a couple of hours in his
company it was as if we had been old friends for years!  Others will be
able to describe better than I can his overall contribution to the US
craft cider revival, both through his work in setting up Cider Days
and also through his exemplary and hugely enjoyable ciders which he made
with such care.


Terry was one of nature's gentlemen with a great sense of humour and a
generous spirit. I am privileged to have known him, and deeply sad for
Judith and his family now that he is gone.

Again, forgive the na�vete, but I have a question regarding light.


The store that I buy most of my supplies from carries carbuoys in
different colors. There are clear, green and brown ones.


Is it important to limit or filter the light that hits the cider during
fermentation? I know there is some school of thought that light affects
beer poorly. Just wondering if it mattered in terms of cider. Personally
I would like to watch the fermentation in progress, but I don't want to
it damage the product.

I wrote to the Digest several editions past with a question regarding
total SO2 levels in cider over time, and whether or not they drop.
Andrew Lea reported some data from Long Ashton showing that
measurements of total SO2 levels do indeed drop over time, and that a
cider bottled and stored for 14 months tested at approximately 70% of
it's original Total SO2 level.
        The cider I have been so confused by this year does show this same
trend, although the drop seems to be more precipitous. My last
titration showed my total SO2 levels to be around 50% of my original
measurement, 2 1/2 months after pressing.   Unfortunately, my data
set is nowhere near as comprehensive as the one Andrew reported, so
it is difficult to directly compare.  This  cider fermented and is
now stored in High-Density Polyethylene tanks, which have some oxygen
transfer through the tank walls, and I wonder if this is having an
impact on my readings.
   I think at this point I will send a sample to the labs at Cornell,
essentially testing my own laboratory skills.
Thank You Andrew!

I have been looking to buy a small pump for moving cider from tank to
tank, something to move in the range of 5-10 gallons per minute, and
have discovered that it would be very easy to spend a great deal of
money doing so!
        There are some reasonably priced, apparently high-quality pumps with
brass bodies on the market, pumps designed for the wine industry.
These pumps cost a fraction of a similar pump with a stainless steel
body, which got me wondering exactly how bad is it to have cider in
contact with brass, especially considering that, in the case of a
pump, total contact time is fairly minimal.  Is there a leaching of
lead from brass to cider? Is brass significantly more difficult to
clean?
        Any input would be appreciated.

I never knew Terry Maloney well, but I largely have him to thank for
my interest in cider making.  The first bottle of well made cider I
ever drank was a West County Reines Des Pommes.  It was fermented
with wild yeast, a little bubbly and off-dry, and was both complex
and delicious.  It was a revelation that cider could be so good.
Thank You Terry and Judith, I drink to you both.
