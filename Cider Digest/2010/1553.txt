You shouldn't expect a smooth surface of SS in contact with cider to be
affected.  The difficult areas are at the edge of the surface of the
liquid, or at a boundary with another material.  Or a poorly-done weld not
ground smooth could be a weak link.

I'd give it a lifetime; you could take 25 years as a way of saying "an
awfully long time."

Yes, 316 is more resistant to attack.  But there's no inherent reason that
316 should be hugely more expensive.  If you look at stock, like tubing or
sheet, 316 will run from 25% to 50% more for the raw material, and as I
understand it's not that much more difficult to work.  Probably the big
difference you're seeing is that 316 is far less common for some uses,
so there's no "economy of scale"; the 316 tanks are more likely to be
custom work.

Well said!  316 in particular being resistant to so many chemical
challenges, it's used for various "oh, lordy...don't ask!" tasks.

HDPE, and thick, will work well for fermentation and storage for a while.
Fairly common in the UK from what I can see, and comparable barrels are
available in the US.

No info on BPA.  Anybody with enough chemical background to say?


But you shouldn't have trouble finding larger HDPE barrels.  I'm using
14 and 30 US gallon barrels.

Just let's don't discourage people who can't afford SS.  HDPE is a good
start as long as you get the cider into glass (or drink it:) before too
long.


At the 5-gal-and-multiple range, why not just use glass carboys?

Hello cider friends,


I'm a recently retired Coast Guard officer somewhat aground in NW
Pennsylvania.  I'm starting a small (100 tree) cider orchard as a
distraction, but I'm interested in working for a commercial orchard and
learning the craft and earning a supplemental income.


I'm good with machines and infrastructure (power, plumbing, and
technology), and I've completed the Mitchell cider class at Cornell.
I've done grafting and pruning with reasonable success.


If you're looking for a willing and talented helper, and you're
relatively close (1 hour drive) to Russell, PA, please drop me a line so
we can talk.


Many thanks for your consideration,


Al Yelvington
