Scott,
I am original cofounder and cidermaker for Blue Mountain Cider Co. in Milton
Freewater OR.  Primarily a Homebrewer with access to a lot of apples.
We started with 304 equipment because it was less expensive and easy to
find.  It worked very well to get us started.  When we went from a capacity
of 2000 gallons to 16000 gallons we went with 316.  We did have to custom
order the tanks.


If you plan on using your equipment for a long time (10+ years) try to go
with the 316.  The main issue with 304 is the microscopic pitting of the
metal surface due to the PH and malic acid in Cider.  This creates places
for bio terrorists to hide and mess with your cider.  It also makes cleaning
tougher.


The first thing I noticed about the 316 metal is how easy it is to clean and
rinse.  On a larger scale this was a great benefit.  Knowing that we will
not have to keep an eye out for changes in quality due to deterioration of
the tank surface gives us needed piece of mind.


On a smaller scale I have used 15 gallon glass Demijohn carboys.  They are
tough to find but worth it.  They usually come with a plastic tub and cover
set up to protect the carboy.  It makes handling a little easier as well.


Here's to good cider making!


Cheers.

Blending, or use of malic acid (or citric if you must) are the only ways
really. But pH isn't such an important consideration after fermentation
as it is before, because you now have the alcohol to protect from
spoilage and all the sugar has gone. Post-fermentation spoilage
organisms are mostly aerobic, so keeping the cider tightly sealed and
away from air is the most important thing you can do. A little sulphite
can help.


The most important consideration around acidity post-fermentation is the
level of titratable acidity for a balanced finish to the flavour - which
should probably be between 0.4 and 0.7%. If you pitch for this you will
be in a pH range (say < 3.8) which provides microbial protection anyway.

I have a few 19th century French cider books which also cover perry but
I'm sorry to report I've drawn a blank on both cultivars. I looked in
the following which all contain lists of perry pears:


- - Le Cidre by Boutteville and Hauchecorne (1882)
- - Le Cidre by Labounoux and Touchard (undated but ca 1902)
- - Le Pommier a Cidre by Fau (undated ca 1900)
- - Fabricant de Cidre et de Poire by Dubief and Malepeyre (1859)
- - Same title 'new edition' (undated but ca 1892)
- - Pomologie et Cidrerie by Warcollier (1909)


and neither pear is mentioned at all. So they must be pretty obscure.


The only 'hit' was in Charley's 1948 English translation of Warcollier's
1929 "Cidrerie" as "Principles and Practice of Cidermaking" where
"...Poire de Cloche is used for confectionery..." but there is no
mention of its use for making perry despite listing other cultivars that
are.


Sorry to report a negative but perhaps others will be luckier for you!
