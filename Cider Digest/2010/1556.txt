Years ago, as a student at Oregon State University, I found some one had
donated a small collection of old French cider books to the collection.
I was able to get access to rare book collection and get them pulled
out for me to look at. (I also got to sit next to Linus Pauling's two
Nobel prizes in that room)  It had been many decades since most of those
books had been pulled from storage. (I doubt they have been pulled since
I requested them.) I don't speak French but I like old books and enjoyed
flipping through them.  Now that everything can be found on the internet,
I did a quick search.  They are still there.  I'm 99.999% sure they are
not going to let them go out on an Inter-Library Loan but you might ask.
I don't remember a break down of cultivars but it's been about 15
years since I looked at them.  At any rate see the list of books at:

I'm wondering how long cider can be kept in glass carboys and the best
practices for doing so.  The background to my question is that I fermented
cider in 5 ~20L glass carboys this winter. Rather than bottle it all at
once, I'm hoping to store a good portion of it in the glass carboys for
another few months. Clearly, making sure the carboys are topped up would be
a good idea. Other specifics I would like to know are:


- -          Now that fermentation is done, should I keep the fermentation air
locks on the carboys or replace them with solid rubber stoppers?


- -          Is there a critical temperature that I should make sure the cider
stays below?


- -          How long can I keep storing the cider like this before I bottle
it?

Friends,


I've been in the NW Pennsylvania / Southern Tier NY region for about six
months now, and not many folks know about true (hard) cider and cider
varieties.  I'm wondering how many of you out there would be interested
in a regional blog for cider fruit growers to raise public awareness?


Dave White (www.oldtimecider.com) has done a stellar job of promoting
cider producers with his map and reviews, and now I see an opportunity
to promote folks that grow cider varieties to link up with home cider
makers.


At a minimum, I'm thinking that a national grower map to pair up with
the producer map would show where folks could get "real" fruit and maybe
juice.  I'm hoping to press fruitfor hire this fall using either wild
fruit, or customer provided fruit.  It's a small start, but I have about
two more seasons before my humble orchard has fruit to sell.


Please drop me a line, and let me know if you grow fruit for local sale
and would like some promotion.  I'm open to suggestions.  I'm especially
interested in getting opinions on criteria for listing.  One criteria
may be that the juice is local and not from concentrate.
