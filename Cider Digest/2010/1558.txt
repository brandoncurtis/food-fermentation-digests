Has anybody used a tool like this:
  http://www.leevalley.com/garden/page.aspx?c=2&p=64798&cat=52&ap=1
for grafting apples?
(It is a punch-like tool which makes an "omega-shaped" tongue in one
piece and notch in the other, so that they lock together.)


I've seen that sort of graft used for grapes but didn't know if it
might work for apples.


If so:  How well does it work with slight mismatches in size of
scion/rootstock?


I'm having progressively more trouble each year doing the cuts for
whip/tongue grafts...so even if the tool did only a passable job,
it might be better than my poorly-shaped hand work.
