I did cough up the money to purchase Apples: Botany, Production and Uses
(ISBN 0-85199-592-6) after seeing it in the Albert R. Mann Library (the
Cornell University library located in Geneva, associated with the New York
State Agricultural Experiment Station).  Coincidentally, the contributor who
wrote the book's section on orchard floor management, Ian Merwin, is a
contributor to the Cider Digest.


At 660 pages this book (published in 2003) is a fantastic reference that
would be useful for someone who likes to read, is meticulous in preparation,
and who wants to acquire a good understanding of apples before making plans
to grow them on a commercial scale.   I regret not having seen this book
before making many of my early mistakes.  There are sections covering plant
materials, apple physiology and environmental influences, orchard and tree
management, crop protection,  and a section covering harvesting, handling
and utilization.  There are also chapters dealing with diseases, managing
pests, freeze protection, integrated production and organic production.  I
was particularly impressed with the level of useful detail in the chapters
covering pruning, training and orchard planting systems.  If you're getting
ready to get started growing you may want to read the chapter on orchard
site, site preparation, orchard planning and establishment.
