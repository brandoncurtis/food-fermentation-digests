Can anyone recommend a set up (DYI construction or already made) for a
home set up? My folks have a few apple trees, and this would be our first
year crushing and pressing. I'm looking for something beginner friendly
and something we probably wouldn't replace for 3 years if we got really
serious about making cider.

A memorial for Terry Maloney of West County Cider, who died suddenly in a
tragic accident at the end of January, will be held on May 22, 2010 starting
at 11 am. The location is the East Colrain Chapel, at 341 West Leyden Road,
Colrain, MA 01340 (for anyone interested who's interested in attending and
needs to get Internet directions).


Terry was not only a friend to many of us, but one of the key figures in the
American cider revival over the past quarter-century. In addition to this
"official" memorial, however, we cidermakers and friends will be celebrating
Terry's life and spirit in various ways this years -- in particular at the
16th annual Cider Days festival in Franklin County, MA on November 6-7.


For more information, contact Judith Maloney after May 10 at
judith@westcountycider.com.
