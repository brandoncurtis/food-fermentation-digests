re:  Redfield


Dick, to further extol this variety:  Redfield carries good resistance
to apple scab and usually tolerant to mildew and fire blight.  Tree is
quite lanky (not exactly a good pomological term, but take a look at
the tree!).  Extreme winter hardiness inherited from parents Wolf
River and Malus niedwetzkyana.

Perhaps some out there can help. I attempted grafting for the first time
ever this past spring. I cleft grafted apple scion wood onto M106 and
M111 rootstocks. I did this in mid March, covered the grafted joint with
a recommended bitumous material, packed the roots in damp moss, and put
them in my garage to keep cool. I was told to keep them in a cool spot
until when it's safe to plant my tomatoes (Memorial Day weekend) to avoid
frost. This was to also allow the grafts to develop a "scab" to protect
the joints.  The garage has been dark, and mostly cool , but we have had
some warm spells this past spring (I live in Southeast Michigan).


I noticed this past weekend most of the rootstocks have sprouted leaves
while sitting in the garage (below the graft joint. Most of the scion
wood has not sprouted anything, even though it still seems fresh and
pliable). Is this normal to have the rootstock sprout leaves even though
the scion has not? Should I pull those leaves off? When? Any insight from
the more experienced out there will be most appreciated. Thanks
