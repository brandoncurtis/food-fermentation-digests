    Rob Miller asked a question about gravity bottle fillers in the
last digest, which is a subject that I too have been trying to make sense of.
There is quite a price range of products on the market, all of which seem
to do roughly the same thing.  Of course I would like to spend less money,
but not for a machine which will break down and/or require maintenance
while a barrel of cider sits half empty.  I have also noticed that some
of these units have built-in inert gas spargers.  Are there advantages or
disadvantages associated with this?
    There are also some vacuum fillers available on the market, some
of which seem to have very good reputations and to be well made.  I do
have a concern about these though, which is that a vacuum style pump would
pull any dissolved CO2 out of solution, essentially creating a flat cider.
I would not be trying to bottle "sparkling" cider with this machine, but
I often find that my cider has a pleasant little CO2 tingle to it , which
I suppose is CO2 kept in solution by the pressure barrier of the airlock.
Does anyone have experience using a vacuum style pump or bottle filler,
and do they indeed pull gas out of cider or wine?
    I suppose I could always inoculate my cider prior to bottling with
a mini-dosage of sugar and yeast, just enough to send a few bubbles up
but not enough to push corks out.
    I'm beginning to think they had it right when they tapped an oak
barrel of cider and invited everyone they knew over for a party!
