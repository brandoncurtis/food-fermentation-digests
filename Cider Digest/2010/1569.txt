Subject: Craft Cidermaking Book Index

I know a number of people on this list have bought my book which, much
to my embarrassment and for reasons with which I will not bore you,
contains no index!


However, I have now prepared one and you can download it as two PDF
pages here http://cider.org.uk/craft_cidermaking_index_for_1st_edn.pdf


All you then have to do is to print it, trim off the margins, fold each
sheet in the middle and paste them back to back on the inside back cover
of the book. Hope this will be some help.  The index is not professional
- - I did it myself - but I like to think it's better than nothing at all!


The reason I did this is because the first printing of the book has now
sold out (flattering, but not as flattering as the 3 million copies sold
of CJJ Berry's 'First steps in Winemaking' which started me on this road
as a 1960's teenager!).  As a result there is a revised reprint now
under way. There are some minor text changes and updates, and some
changes to the photographs, but most importantly there *is* an index!  I
thought it unfair that people should have to buy a new book simply to
get hold of the index, so I have made it available separately.
