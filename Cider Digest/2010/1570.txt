 It is with great pleasure that I can pass on the news that Dr Andrew Lea,
known to hundreds of Cider Digest followers for his deep knowledge and
generosity, was awarded the Royal Bath and West Agricultural Society's
Gold Medal for a lifetime's contribution to the cider industry. The medal
was presented in the Orchards and Cider Tent at a presentation attended by
the great and the good of the UK cider industry.
