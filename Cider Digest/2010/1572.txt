[Janitor's note:  Yes, this is somewhat commercial, but Lauren checked
with me about posting it.  Also, it's a direct answer to Alan's query.]


In response to Alan's request for good cider in NJ:


I work with Shelton Brothers Importers, and we import the Oliver's Ciders
and Perries, as well as several other English ciders.  In general, the best
way to get good cider anywhere in the country is to ask for it!  Bug your
local retailers; a good shop will bring it in for you.  Of course, some
states have complicated laws that may prevent the sale of cider (or at least
the sale of cider from small producers who cannot afford steep registration
fees) however it can't hurt to ask.


If you have questions about where to find our ciders, or if they are
available in your state, you can either send us an email at
info@sheltonbrothers.com, or go to the Distribution page of our website and
contact your nearest distributor directly.  This is actually the easiest way
to find our products, since we cannot legally sell to retailers, but must go
through distributors.


Alan,you should contact our NJ distributor, Hunterdon, at 908-454-7445.  if
you let us know exactly where you are in PA, we might even be able to help
you find Oliver's there!


Thanks!
