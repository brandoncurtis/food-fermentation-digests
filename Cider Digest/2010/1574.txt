Dear All,
Is there any harm in spreading the waste Sediment from the bottom of the
vat after fermentation into the orchard?
Would this waste upset the trees? ie stop them from producing fruit?
Any thoughts on this....


thanks

Hope you haven't been misled by what my colleagues wrote, Claude. It is
*apple juices* which lose amino acids by the Maillard reaction, not
*apples*. The sentence refers to stored apple juice concentrate or
bottled juice, not to apples themselves. The Maillard reaction is a
chemical reaction which takes place between amino groups and reducing
sugars (eg fructose and glucose) to form 'Amadori compounds' which
eventually degrade to coloured or flavourful compounds. By so doing the
amino acids themselves are lost.


This is a major cause of the brown colour of apple juice concentrate. As
far as I know it does not happen in the living fruit which still retains
its cellular organisation and where amino acids and sugars do not come
into contact in an uncontrolled way - though I might keep an open mind
on that in long-stored fruit simply for lack of evidence. It does
certainly take place in dried apple slices (and dried egg and milk and
many other dried or semi-dry foods).


The polyphenol oxidase reaction is something else, which occurs in the
fresh juice after cell disruption as it is expressed from the apple -
you will have noticed it yourself - and is the reason that fresh apple
juice is brown not white (unless pressed in the total absence of air).
The phrase "...coupling of fruit phenols to (give) polyphenols.." is
slightly misleading in that it is the random oxidative coupling of
native colourless polyphenols to form even more complex polyphenols
(mediated by phenol oxidases) which is the origin of the colour but this
is something of a semantic point!


And I agree that's certainly not a book to take to the beach (unless you
are a real geek!).

Subject: Redfield and blending

In the last Cider Digest I cautioned that Redfield, for all its great
characteristics, ought to be blended.


I had a reply from Field Maloney (Terry and Judith's son) that the most
recent West County Redfield cider is -not- blended; it is 100% varietal.
And so:  I am surprised, and I stand corrected(!), and I feel that this
is even more of an accolade to Terry and West County's cider, that he/
they could make a varietal of Redfield and not have problems getting the
cider in balance.
