I would not think this could harm anything, but I have an even better use
for it: in the kitchen. This waste sediment is quite thick and mostly
contains yeast bodies. I use it for sauces, and in replacement of water or
wine in most of my recipies. I find it great! Try it...

Subject: fireblight: can trees build resistance?
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>

Wandering through my little orchard, I've noticed several different types
of response of trees to fireblight.


Some succumb almost as soon as they start bearing for real--major limbs are
affected and it spreads through the tree.  Rootstock doesn't seem to
matter.  I've seen this with Harry Master's Jersey, Yarlington Mill, and
Bramley's.  These can be heartbreakers if you have a number of trees
developing very nicely and then one year WHAM! and they're gone.


Some trees are rarely (if ever) affected, only an occasional twig strike,
easily maintained, and it stays this way.


But it seems there's a category of tree which can take a major hit--I
think I'm going to lose the tree but (stupidly) give it one more chance--
and it appears to recover and continue on for years with only small
strikes after that, as in my previous category.  It's as if the tree
has developed some sort of resistance, even though from what I know of
fireblight this shouldn't happen.  I've observed this with Haralson and
Twenty Ounce, and I'm sifting through my mind for others (tho my mind
is a sieve).


So, the questions:


Have other folks observed this sort of behavior with fireblight?  Or
have you seen something like it which you eventually were able to
ascribe to some other factor?


And to the several pomologists or orchard scientists on the list:
Is it possible for a tree to build resistance to fireblight?  And if
not, any idea what I'm seeing?
