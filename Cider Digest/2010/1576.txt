In my experience rootstock does make a difference. It just doesn't seem to
get quite as bad on M7a. I certainly don't want to say it is resistant, just
somewhat more tolerant.  Why the rootstock would impart a small amount of
seeming tolerance to a scion I do not know.  I have had university staff
informally concur in this opinion.  Some of the Geneva rootstocks are
reported to be highly resistant. Again, it would seem this would impart none
of this resistance to the scion, but in observation it does seem to do so.
 I can't say I have had an infected tree recover and then seem to be
more resistant, but then I really haven't looked for this situation.
IME & YMMV

Here in NorthCentral Washington State fire blight is not much of a
problem except on Pears. however a good place to look for control is the
"2010 Crop Protection Spray Guide for Tree Fruits in Washington" and it's
on the Internet. Detecting and pruning out the infected shoots is a must,
cut well below those infected shoots and burn them.  Jack

not fully known ...


Projects were conducted to better understand the genetics of fire blight
resistance. It is assumed that fire blight resistance is not based on
one single gene but on several genes with partial effect (additive
effects, Quantitative Trait Loci, QTL???s). QTL???s for fire blight
resistance were found in the cultivated apple (Malus domestica), cv.
Fiesta (Calenge 2005, Khan et al. 2006) and in wild Malus species (Malus
robusta 5, Peil et al. 2007; Malus ???Evereste???).


There seem to be complex regulatory mechanisms. Not only nature but also
the quantity of defense-related compounds is likely to influence the
outcome of plant???pathogen interactions.


Variations in inoculum level, pathogen strain, and conditions favoring
infection during bloom can all influence infection and disease caused by
Erwinia amylovora. Results indicate that field observations of fire
blight susceptibility, under conditions of natural infection, can be
misleading and may not be a reliable method for evaluating resistance.

Protection of apple against fire blight induced by an hrpL mutant of
Erwinia amylovora


Michel Tharaud et al. INRA Angers


A regulatory hrpL non-virulent mutant of Erwinia amylovora is effective
in controlling fire blight disease when inoculated on apple seedlings
simultaneously with the pathogenic parental strain.

Subject: Longevity of fresh, sweet cider (under certain conditions) ?

Every year I, along with friends, press about 50-ish gallons of cider.  Most
of the juice that does not go to the helpers, gets fermented (typically
40-ish gallons..)..


That's a LOT of hard cider.. more than I realistically need, so, this year I
thought about trying something different..


I have a multi-tap keg fridge, that I keep at a constant temp of 37 degrees.
 I was thinking of filling one of my kegs with fresh cider at this years
pressing day, and serving it on one of the 'spare' taps.


My thoughts are as follows -
1 - Get the cider into a keg
2 - Sulfite it
3 - Purge the keg with CO2, and leave it overnight with the bleeder open
4 - 24 hours later, get the keg into the fridge, then push it with beer gas
at just enough pressure to pour (not looking to carbonate it, thus Beer Gas
at low pressure)


Questions -
- - Do people DO this??  In all my discussions with people about Cider, five
years going to Cider Days, email discussions, etc.. I have no recollection
of having this conversation...


- - Rough idea of how long the cider would last under these conditions? I
would think "weeks", but am happy to be corrected.


- - Other thoughts, opinions, ideas ??

Just a gentle reminder that the national Google map of small growers and
fresh juice providers is still a work in progress.


http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=102487776368726541031.00
048513ade770cc6b56a&z=4


If I'm to believe what I have so far, it appears that the lion's share
of growers and juice providers are in the northeast...


If you have a local grower that has cider varieties, or someone that
presses fresh juice / does custom pressing, please email me their
information.


Autumn is coming, so do these folks a favor and get them on the map so
people will be able to find their product!
