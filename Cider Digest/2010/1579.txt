Doug - what you see is no doubt Candida Mycoderma, film yeast, a result
of too much oxygen [excess head space?] and too warm storage, it's a
common problem for wine makers. Use of sulpher compounds can help
protect the cider, but elimination of oxygen and storage below 12*C are
best practice. Any time I have it appear, the cider goes into the
vinegar tank.

I'd say it's almost certainly a film yeast. See Part 5 of Science of
cidermaking on my website http://www.cider.org.uk/part5.htm for a
description and picture.


You need to keep the air firmly out and maybe treat with 50 - 100 ppm
sulphite.

Slightly off topic for cider but an interesting article on the reworking
of champagne bottles in France to reduce price and carbon footprint.

Champagne Producers Aim for 'Greener' Bottle
By LIZ ALDERMAN
France's Champagne industry is trying to cut the carbon dioxide it emits
transporting billions of tiny bubbles around the world.
