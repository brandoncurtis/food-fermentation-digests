  I had this happen to me commercially a couple of times. It was of
course my own fault for not keeping the tank it was stored in topped up
and free of air and cold. I do not sulphite any of my ciders or mead and
so this makes it even more important to sterile filter, chill and keep
the air out. I have all of my tanks rigged so I can use low pressure
inert gas in the tank at all times. (Argon at 1 psi) keeps any O2 out of
the tanks. I can draw off cider and not worry about the headspace as it
is all argon.


I haven't had a problem since.

Re: Candida mycoderma
I am both a commercial cidermaker and a winemaker and I find it interesting
that cider almost always develops a film yeast, very early on. It is
definitely related to exposure to oxygen.


I believe that it occurs more quickly on cider because cider has less
alcohol. And cider could be more vulnerable following malolactic fermentation,
with a lower pH.


But here is a thought: it may also protect the cider from exposure to
oxygen, kind of like a Montilla wine from Jerez, Spain (sherry). I guess I have
learned not to worry about it so much, and to just make sure that once I see
it try to top up the container with cider or gas (nitrogen or CO2
[preferably]), and spray a little SO2 on top of the cider.


A side note: Cider is alive and well in the Pacific Northwest with some
major cider events taking place in September and October. The Cider Summit
takes place in Seattle on September 11 at Discovery Center Park, followed by
CiderFest on Vashon (Island), Saturday, October 9, an all-day celebration of
apples and cider including apple identification, apple pressing, cider
judging, cider tasting finishing with a barn dance. I believe the same weekend
is the cider tasting in Portland, Oregon....and finally a cider tasting in
November at Ivar's Salmon House in Seattle.


And finally, it might be of interest that the cidermakers of the Pacific
Northwest have formally organized as the NW Cider Association for promotional
purposes. There are now at least a dozen cider producers in the NW, many of
them small, artisan ciders using cider apples.

Here's something that may be of interest to those who are within reasonable
travel distance of central Michigan this weekend (Sept. 11-12).??? The Great
Lake Cider & Perry Association will be presenting the third annual Great
Lakes Cider & Perry Festival at Uncle John's Cider Mill in St. Johns (just
north of Lansing).  Samples of cider and perry from the states and province
that border the Great Lakes will be available for tasting. This year???s
Festival will include about thirty ciders and perries from Michigan, New
York, Indiana, Wisconsin, Ontario, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Festivals like this
are a great way to taste different ciders side-by-side to develop a better
practical understanding of this historically significant beverage. They
also present unique opportunities to meet regional cidermakers and fellow
enthusiasts.


Saturday???s public tasting will be open to anyone of legal age. The
festival runs from 11am to 6pm on Saturday, with cider and perry tastings
throughout the day at a cost of $10 per person, which includes a souvenir
glass for the first 250 people, and the 10 tasting tickets.   Tickets can
be purchased at the gate or online at www.michiganvine.com/blog/tickets.


On Sunday the public tasting will continue on a smaller scale as
the main focus is shifted toward the trade with an emphasis on how
to get cider to the public. The trade portion of the Festival will
consist of advance-registration closed sessions intended for producers,
distributors, retailers, sommeliers, cicerones, restaurateurs, chefs,
etc. Food pairings for this portion of the Festival will be from Wrought
Iron Grill in Owosso. Artisanal cheese for pairings will be provided by
Hill???s Cheese Shops.  Contact Mike Beck for last-minute registration:
mjbeck@ujcidermill.com.


The hosting venue, Uncle John's Cider Mill, is family-friendly.
Food vendors will sell sweet and savory selections. Activities such as
cider pressing, nature walks and a kids??? playground will be available
for enjoyment all weekend long.  Location is 8614 N US 127, St. Johns,
just north of Lansing.??? Additional information is available online at
www.ujcidermill.com.


All profit proceeds from the festival will benefit the Great Lake Cider &
Perry Association (established 2008, www.GreatLakesCider.com) to help fulfill
its mission to promote cider and provide educational opportunities about it.


For those who may be coming from slightly greater distance there are some
accommodations in the area (listed in order of distance from the Festival).
