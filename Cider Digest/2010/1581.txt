Your comment "...spray a little SO2 on top of the cider." got me thinking.
Can I ask do you mean spray as a sulphite / sulfite solution, or spray a
little SO2 gas on top of the cider?
I assume the first which sounds to me a good plan when finding a film yeast.
Can you give a bit more detail such as: any special equipment involved?
Strength of solution?


Thanks and cheers,

I live in Chicago (city, not suburbs) and have an offer from an apple
vendor to sell me mixed apples including golden russet, mutzu, paula red
and northern spy for 25 dollars/full bushel. It seems high since it works
out to over 8dollars a gallon for pressed juice. He tells me that's better
than the restaurant/hotel price. I don't know if that's a good deal or
not. Any advice?


Thanks
