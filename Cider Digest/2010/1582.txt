I'll drive bushels from Ann Arbor for $25 a pop, but I'd need a minimum
order.

They're about eight bucks at Eastern Market (for seconds), and the farm
price for clean ones is around $8-12. I pay $4 a gallon at the mill, pressed
into carboys.

Ray,
I use all the tools in my toolbox. I was referring to using a strong
meta-bisulfite solution 100-200ppm) that I have in a spray bottle (well
marked), and I also have meta that comes in tablets of 10 and 22ppm strength
that I can just drop into a barrel or tank (kind of like an alka-seltzer,
slow release) with the added benefit that the tablet releases CO2.


I prefer to use CO2 gas rather than Nitrogen for topping up head space if
I can't fill to the top.


I have recently learned to keep a spray bottle of high proof ethanol (sold
as Everclear in Washington State) to spray around the bung area or on the
outside of the container.

... it works out to over 8dollars a gallon for pressed juice.

According to this web site:


http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/scales/bushels.html


One bushel of apples weighs 48 lb, so you'd be paying about $0.52/lb for the
apples. If you look at it as cost per gallon of pressed juice, I think it's
closer to $6.25 (48 lb = 21.77 kg => 15.24 liters @ 70% yield => 15.24
liters = 4 US gallons => $6.25/Gallon).


For comparison, I've seen  pressed juice, w/out preservatives, in season for
around $4/Gallon at places like Walmart and Costco. From concentrate juice
can be had year-round for $3.25/Gallon at Costco. This is in Washington
State.

Hello All, I'm hoping to visit Vancouver with work in Ocotber and was wound=
ering if anyone could recommend any cider producers either in and around Va=
ncouver or on Vancouver Island that are worth having a look at.


Many thanks

Howard Roth asked if a bushel of apples in Chicago should cost $25.  I don't
know about Chicago, but in the Twin Cities, a bushel of these non premium
varieties would go for that price or slightly more if delivered, which a
restaurant or hotel or grocery would get.  This would be for U S Fancy,
meaning that there are no marks, and of good size, say 3 1/4 inches in
diameter.  To get a better price, see if you can get 2nds, which should mean
that the apple has a mark from scab, a fungal disease that is on the outside
and does not affect the taste, or tree rubs that may be unsightly, but don't
taste at all.  They should be 50 to 60% of the price of 1st grade.  Lastly,
you could see if you can get "peelers" which are even worse looking and will
be worth $10 - 12 per bushel, but do not accept anything with the skin
broken in any way or a bruise that is starting to rot.  They are only good
for the garbage can.
