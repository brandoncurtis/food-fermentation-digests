Subject: 3rd Annual Great Lakes Cider & Perry Festival

Just a note of congratulations to everyone involved in the staging of a
very successful 3rd Annual Great Lakes Cider Festival on 9/11.  This is
my first year at crafting my own cider so this Festival was a wonderful
opportunity to sample a lot of different cider.  The venue and facility
were great and the cider was much better than I suspected it would be.


As I am from Ohio, I started my sampling at the only Ohio cider maker
represented, Windy Hill Apple Farm.  Their product (organic apples, no
sulphite, natural yeast, no filtering or pasteurization) was to me very
unique and complex.  Even the slight hint of acetobacter made the drink
interesting and authentic and after sampling it several more times through
the course of the afternoon, it remained my personal favorite.


In the interest of continuous improvement I would humbly suggest that next
year, if the cider makers cannot be encouraged to represent themselves,
they should be made to provide some minimum information about their cider
(i.e. varietals, natural v cultured yeast, preservatives used and at what
stage, etc.) as it was awkward for the serving staff to respond to questions
when most of them knew little or nothing about the cider they were serving.
It might be asking too much, but even same basic chemistry about the cider
such as beginning end ending SG, TA, and pH, would be most educational as
well to fellow home cider makers.




Thanks again for a nice event.  Already looking forward to next year..
Richard S.

Re: Visit to Vancouver
Wilf, I highly recommend visits to Merridale Cidery north of Victoria on
Vancouver Island and Sea Cider, near Victoria. Both use true-blue cider
apples; both are family operated and swell people.


Enjoy your visit. If you have some money, schedule a dinner at the famed
Sooke Harbor House, a rare experience.

In the UK we have just had a cider revolution. In the past there were
allsorts of 'white' ciders containing very little in the way of apples.
These  ciders were described by our Government as  'artificial ciders'. The
Government has decided to take these out of  cider duty rates and put then
in another class, paying a lot more. The next cider is  the main market
'industrial' cider. The Government has  decided that these products must be
fermented from at least 35% apple ( 65% something else!), to qualify for
cider duty. And lastly there are 'artisan' ciders which are made  from  as
near as possible to 100% apples. The artisan class will be left alone. For
the small makers this is very good news; at last we have our unique selling
point , 100% apples and    described in  English law.  J Temperley Burrow
