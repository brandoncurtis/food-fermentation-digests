There's that great quote by Mark Twain:  "When I was a boy of 14, my
father was so ignorant I could barely stand to have the old man around.
But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had
learned in seven years."


More to the point:  Several years ago, I posted on this very digest an
annoyed little tirade about the state of judging at the New Mexico State
Fair and how I had entered some really outstanding--in my opinion--ciders
and came away with only a measly  bronze medal to show for it.  How could
the judging be so inept?  They were a bunch of beer guys, so how could they
possibly know and appreciate the nuances of skillfully made craft cider?
How dare they collapse categories?  Oh, the injustice.  Oh, the humanity.
And on and on it went.


Fast forward to this year:  I entered three styles.  A Kingston Black
English cider.  A keeved French style and a common cider.  For my efforts,
I was awarded a gold, a silver, a bronze and a best of show (cider.)


Now, since I couldn't *possibly* have learned anything or gotten more skilled
at cider-making in the intervening couple of years, I can only be astonished
at how much better the level of judging has gotten in so short a time. <g>

Wilf asked about cider in the Vancouver area
Check out website for Merridale and Sea Cider , both on Vancouver Island.
The Annual Apple Festival at UBC on the weekend of October 16th and 17th
might be fruitful.

I've been hunting around to see what's available in presses for a step up
from the basket style.  The basket presses--Jaffrey, Correll, Happy
Valley--seem to be quite similar, and of course all suffer from the same
inherent inefficiency of having a single mass of pomace.


But if one wants to move up to a pack press or similar for improved
efficiency, and also move up a little in capacity, there doesn't seem
to be any commercial product until the many-thousands-of-dollars bracket.


So my question would be either (1) Why not? or (2) What have I missed?
That's quite a gap in availability.


It seems there is some demand since there are designs for home-built
small manual pack presses using large screws or bottle jacks--e.g. the
one Ray Blockley has built and encouraged for a lot of folks.  But for
folks without a workshop and/or shop experience...or even folks who
need a better press but don't have the time to build it...what are they
doing instead?
