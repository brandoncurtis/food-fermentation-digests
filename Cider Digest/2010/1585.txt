Donald,


Congratulations on your victories!


If I recall correctly, at the time of your former ignominius finish and
subsequent comments aimed at improving the skills of judges I posted some
info in an attempt to explain the philosophy behind judge certification and
(from the perspective of a past compettion organizer) the challenges and
vagaries of organizing a homebrew competition. I also vaguely recall your
being somewhat gracious and appreciative of my perspective though I'm not
sure you were particularly moved by it at the time :-).


So it's nice to hear from you that those miscreant judges have finally
wised up and gotten with the program :-)


sincerely,

Hello Folks,
I am a receipt of your Cider Digest and would like to know if you know other
cider makers in the San Francisco Bay Area I could collaborate and work with
to increase my cider making knowledge.


Respectfully,

I just received an advertisement in the mail for Midwest Homebrewing and
Winmaking Supplies.  They offer a stainless steel apple grinder and a
bladder cider press geared for those who want to step up from the hand crank
presses, but don't want to get a commercial setup.  The web site is

Having investigated this question considerably myself, I think certainly one
viable alternative is an hydraulic shop press. There are models designed for
the home workshop that are very reasonably priced (e.g. www.northerntool.com).
It seems that some of these could be put to work pressing apples with little
or no modification. There are issues to consider: the rack size would have
to be matched to the capacity of the jack; and the longer the stroke length
the better.


A sometime contributor to this discussion group had a video on youtube of
his efforts in this direction, but I cannot seem to find it there now.


Recent discussions on the other cider group have suggested that a plain
sheet of plywood may be just as efficient as a traditional rack and that
press cloths can be made from inexpensive materials available at most fabric
shops.

Having ventured into cider making recently I looked around and could not find
anything commercially available in this category.  I actually wanted something
traditional anyway and am handy with wood tools so ended up constructing a
wooden press out of 4" x 4" rough sawn green oak using the Agriculture Canada
Booklet # 1406 plan  (http://www.cider.org.uk/press.htm) as a guide.  My main
top beam is actually of 6" x 8".  The opening of the press frame is 18" x 32"
and is made for 14" square racks. (A 20" or 22" wide opening would have been
fine but I was worried about the beam loads being too much)  I make 2" thick
cheeses and can stack 10 of them, each yielding 1 gallon of juice.  I'm getting
63% yield by weight with a 15 ton bottle jack (150 psi).  Cost including the
jack was under $200 US, plus a weekend worth of work.   Something equivalent
commercially is pushing $1000 and is a general purpose shop press that needs to
be adapted to cider making.


I have seen people using flat round pieces of plywood and shear curtain
material to make layers in basket presses to try to increase yield and make
pressed cake handling more manageable.

Here in south central Kentucky, we had a week of coolish weather
(nothing extreme), followed by a bit of Indian summer. Now three of my
varietals are blooming - Golden Russet, Liberty & King David. How
strange is that? These are 6-year old trees. Is there something I can
do to prevent this fall bloom? These guys are going to get clobbered in
a month or so.


Thanks,
Katie

Like Dick Dunn, I too had a Correll basket press and wanted to step up
in volume, efficiency, and ease of use.  After searching the marketplace,
I decided that I would need to build a press myself.


I designed and built a 17" x 17", electric powered, hydraulic rack and
cloth press, which can handle up to 10 "cheeses" at a time.  Depending on
apple variety and grinder efficiency, the yield varies from 7 to 10 gallons
per pressing.


As Dick mentioned, some engineering and shop skills were required, and
materials cost alone was several thousand dollars.  However, it works great,
and is a large step up.

Dick,
Have you looked at the water presses? The smaller Lancman press, with a 4.5
bu capacity sells for 1635$ at OESCO.
https://www.oescoinc.com/lancman-water-operated-press-p-4292.html


I have seen it at work last year at CiderDays and it seems pretty good. And
I know one guy who bought it last year and is very pleased with it. You
need to have good water pressure however, and it uses the same amount of
water as there is juice produced...

This season I decided to ramp up production since it was such a good
year for apples in the Fort Collins area.  I purchased a McCulloch
MCS2001 14 amp chipper/shredder and cut out a rubber gasket to minimize
leaks.  I found an "H"-frame 20 ton hydraulic shop press on CraigsList
for $100. Harbor freight sells one for $200. This along with the inside
shelf from an old AV cart as a drip tray, a couple of diamond plate
steel pieces for bottom and top press plates, some thick synthetic duck
cloth fabric and some perforated stainless steel racks (I have about a
hundred more) that I had stuffed away in the garage for just this
purpose years ago, which by the way totally impressed my wife with my
forward thinking (packrat) mentality, was all I needed to grind and
press until is was sick of it.  I'm grinding about 25 gallons of loose
apples into 15 gal Rubbermaid totes which makes 5 nice layers in the
"cheese" which gives me about 8ish gallons of juice.  Not the greatest
efficiency, but at least a couple of orders of magnitude improvement
over the kitchen food processor and hand squeezed cheesecloth method.
Every carboy is full along with a 55 gallon drum I picked up for
$10....Now if only I could figure out what to do with it all.  Somebody
ask me about the still.

Dick, home made or expensive are the alternatives, particularly as rack
and cloth pressing is very labor intensive and most folks looking for
larger scale production want something operable by minions, there just
isn't the market to entice anyone into producing such a specialty
machine. For the range of modern alternatives
<http://www.goodnature.com/Juice_Equipment/Juice_Presses/> seems to be
it.  There's also the possibility of finding used:
<http://www.cidermillsupplies.com/used/> or you might find someone to
contract building something to your design.

Addressing the specific question below, I was looking for better efficiency
with the press I had, and simply went to making cheeses in my existing
basket. You can see it in the video link below.  I went with four layers,
and, I find that each layer is MUCH drier after the pressing.  This, even
with the tiny little acme screw on my very old press. I would say that it
works as I had hoped, and, a full 5 gallon pail is the perfect size to
divide into the four cheeses.


Sorry for the unspectacular video quality, this is a very early video in my
YouTube 'career'.

If I do not go with a new press frame (which I VERY much want to do, except
for the cost), probably the next modification I will make is to pull out the
1" acme screw and go with a 1.5 inch.  That would cost about $200, verses 6
or 7 hundred for a new press.

Donald Davenport wrote about his wins at New Mexico State Fair this year
compared to no wins two years back and how he grumbled at the judging...
with a wink:

Don't be too hard on yourself, Donald.  Sure, you've gotten a lot better
with two more years of experience...but likely so has the judging!  The
state of cider judging in the US was in pretty sad shape for a long time.


As recently as three years ago, the winner of a national competition
boasted in writing of having a Brettanomyces contamination to give his
cider its character.  However, the BJCP got serious about cider and they
have really made a lot of progress in the judging.


So figure you're making progress but so is the judging.  And congrats on
your medals.
