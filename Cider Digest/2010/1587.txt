Can anyone reference a belt press for continuous processing of apple juice
for use in cider?  I am looking for one that could produce 250 gallons per
hour or thereabouts.

Steven Edholm mentions the Marchisio crusher from Midwest Supplies and the
large pieces it makes.  I have one, and found that it works best if the
clearance between the rollers is minimized as much as possible.  This is
limited on the crank end by the gears, but I've made them just barely
touch on the other end.  Unfortunately, this has the effect of lessening
the "pull-through" of the rollers, and makes more cranking necessary, but
the end result is significantly smaller pieces.  Waiting until the apples
are dead ripe (which arguably makes for better cider anyway) and running
everything back through a second time, help a lot.  The second time through
is much faster and really doesn't add much time or trouble to the process.


I don't have an answer for the danger posed by the blades, other than
caution.  Even cleaning the thing is dangerous!

"On "hydropresses" (bladder press driven by water mains pressure, just
connect to a hose) - these look very good in terms of ease-of-use and
simplicity.  Main concern is that efficiency is apparently low, around
50%?  I can do better than that with a basket press, so would be loath
to take a step backward in that sense, although it would certainly speed
up the pressing a lot. "


Dick,
It seems to me that the efficiency of this style of press (or any style) is
going to depend a lot on the grind of your apples. If you were using more
of a slicer it may not get as much from it. Our grinder set up leaves the
pomace the consistency of a chunky apple sauce and we regularly get almost
half the juice released before putting any pressure to the press. In our
playing with it, with the same grinding, we get at least the same efficiency
from our bladder press as we did from our small basket type.
