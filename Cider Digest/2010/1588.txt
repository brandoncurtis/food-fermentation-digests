Quite true.  Oft-unstated recommendation: match your mill to your press.


This is why I use a device that produces shreds in conjunction with my
basket press:  The shreds fall every-which-way and leave channels
for the juice to escape.

But that's more a function of the apples themselves than of the milling
consistency.  I can mill (say) Cortland or Haralson, and it's as you say:
the juice is running out as I load the press.  I mill Nehou and get just
a trickle of free-run.  I mill KB and get nothing until I start to turn
the press down.  And yet I'll get similar yields from each in the end,
or if anything, better yield from apples which don't yield up their
juice so quickly.

But what is that yield?  (in gallons out per pound in, or whatever)
As I said (approximately), I'm seeing bladder presses advertised with
yields in the low 50% range, where I'm now in the mid-60%s with my basket
press with modifications.  (I'm measuring weight/weight.)  I can see that
a hyrdopress could get the same yield as an UNmodified basket press using
the stock grinder that several of them have.


I want faster pressing, but I don't want to sacrifice a lot in yield to get
it.

I should have been more specific in saying that the crusher I use
looks like very much the same design as the one in the catalog
picture.  It is certainly older.  I also set the rollers as close as
possible, even touching, and yes the pull through is greatly slowed
down.  I've been told a couple of times that this was designed for
apples, but never was able to believe it.  I'm not sure what I would
do differently in a hand cranked grinder, but I'm not impressed with
efficiency, safety, or the resulting mash.  Its especially unnerving
to use it with two or more people with one person cranking and others
feeding communication is not always good and its so tempting to reach
in and nudge a stuck apple.  Its a real finger chopper... shudder...

Dick:


Since it seems repeatedly to come up now and again, it probably bears
repeating that the yield of juice from pressing is strongly dependent on
the fineness of grind.  I've been out of this game for nearly thirty years,
but that simple truth remains.  When pressing apples at Geneva in a rack &
frame press (whether the smaller one-bushel model or the largr five-bu.),
we got upwards of 70% (by weight) of yield when the crush was accomplished
in a high-speed hammer mill (blunt edges forward).  Microscopic examination
showed a predominance of fragmented cells;  likely this preliminary release
of cell contents was the reason for the consistently high yield.  Of course,
it's true that the hammermill was an expensive machine.

The belt presses I've seen are incredibly cool and effective.  What I saw
in the UK were by Voran (from Austria).  Are these presses imported to the
US and adapted to our mains power (120V 60Hz)?  If so, where or by whom,
and how much?
