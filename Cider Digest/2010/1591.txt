Thought others using corny kegs for fermentation might be interested in this
mod..  Those attaching an airlock to the lid will not find this post useful,
but if you have an airlock connected to a QD attached to the gas in fitting
as I do, this may be helpful.


I was concerned by the head space in my corny kegs due to the 1 1/4" "IN" tube
so I replaced the tube with a #10 SS washer that is exactly the same outside
diameter, thickness and inside diameter as the flange end of the tube and
supports the poppet perfectly.  This has allowed me to reduce head space by 50%
and increase volume by a solid pint.

John, my experience is don't waste precious orchard space for this false
Foxwhelp! I did a pressing test with it which gave a SG of 1.044 and
titrable acidity of 1.3% as tartaric. This definitely puts the variety in
the category that I call "useless for cider"... If the SG was over 1.060, I
could live with the high acidity and blend it down. Or if the acidity was
0.5%, I could blend it with a high SG - high acidity variety. But with low
SG AND high acidity, better leave it for other usages. It could be useful
for making cider vinegar, or as a cooking apple for example. It is not very
interesting for eating fresh.

I will be giving a talk on blending Saturday morning - hope to see many of
you there!

So how is that OESCO grinder working for you?  I'm considering
getting one and haven't heard from anyone yet about how it rates.
I've used a couple of hammermills and those were great.  Does it
compare?

When Jason says 70 psi, I assumed that to be at the rack. My
understanding is that optimum extraction occurs at 50-100 psi rack
pressure.  How is this calculated?  Take my press with 20 inch racks,
that's 400 sq inches.  Twenty tons of force from a bottle jack (40,000
lbs) gives 100 psi rack pressure.  A smaller rack with the same jack
force would give higher pressure, a larger rack less. With my OESCO
commercial grater mill I consistently yield 3 gallons per bushel with
these parameters.

Bill, I think I have to disagree here. I had a home built press to the
Ag-Canada design with an 8 ton manual jack and a 16 inch square bed
which gives about 70 psi by calculation. The juice yields were about
70%. When I upgraded to an electric hydraulic system capable of 138 psi
the yield went up to around 75%.  Published data shows that pack press
juice yields get to around 78% at 300 psi and then don't significantly
increase any further (though obviously that does depend on fineness of
grind and bed thickness too).

I don't understand. Let's say you had 40 tons acting over a 20 inch
square bed. That's 40 x 2240 / 20 x 20 or 224 psi. Not 2000!  I suspect
you are taking the gauge pressure in your hydraulic lines to be the
pressure over the whole bed? My gauge pressure goes up to 5400 psi
before the bypass valve opens but that's not what is applied to the cheese!

John Mott asks about Spartan and Red Delicous. All the McIntosh
offspring are slightly higher acid [lower pH number] than other table
varities, and Spartan will make an acceptable addition to a blend, but
pressing is messier unless they're right off the tree because of the
thicker rubbery skins after even a couple weeks storage [McIntosh being
the worst of the breed]. Reds are useless, the least acid of table
varities and, particularly, very high aromatic levels that make for a
poor flavor and excessive oxidization even as juice. OTOH, the
non-related Golden Delicious works quite well, especially if you can
find some that were culled because of russeting.
