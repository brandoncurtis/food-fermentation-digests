my wife and I attended Claude Jolicoeur's talk about blending. He gave a
URL where he said he'd be putting the slides up but when we went to it to
try to grab them the site didn't exist. Perhaps we wrote it down wrong.


Does anyone associated with Cider Day or who attended know the correct URL
or have a copy of Claude's slides that they could send me?


Thanks,


Jay Hersh

Sorry about this, Jay, but I hadn't noticed this web site was case
sensitive. I am not too sure if it is my page or the host that does this -
I will have to find out!

Mr. Waller,


        I assume that your source of sweet cider is using a "CiderSure"
system or the equivalent.
If used properly, this machine IS pasteurizing the cider. It is
performing UV pasteurization, NOT heat pasteurization.


Either form of pasteurization (when performed effectively) will kill off
bacteria.
That said, you should realize that it will NOT kill off wild yeast. If it
is your objective to ferment with a "known" yeast, rather than produce a
"farm-style" product, then you will want to sulfite your sweet cider
before the addition of the known yeast.


Also, Campden tablets are expensive and inaccurate. I suggest purchasing
either Sodium Metabisulfite or Potassium Metabisulfite and mixing up some
sulfite solution. Either is probably available from a local brew supply
store. If you are not equipped to measure Total AND Free SO2, I suggest
adding 100mg of SO2 (total) per 1 liter of sweet cider. Let the cider
stand for at least 24 hours. Then, add your favorite yeast. That should
be effective in killing off wild yeast and dissipate in time to allow
your favorite yeast to do its stuff.


You may also want to consider sterilizing all your carboys with either
SO2, or PAA (peroxyacteic acid) prior to use.


Yes, yes, some of you out there are shaking your heads. Thinking, "That's
overkill!" Maybe. But I would rather not waste my time (and cider) on a
batch that may go bad.


My two-cents.

Mr. Brown,
        I have had VERY good luck with Cummins Nursery (Ithaca, NY).
They have generations of knowledge, a great selection, and have their
thumb on the pulse of the latest research going on at Cornell.
As you may know, the "G" in rootstock designation stands for "Geneva".
The Cornell Agi. Experiment Station is in Geneva, NY. (an hour from
Ithaca).


To be sure, there are many nurseries (perhaps some closer to you). There
are also "tree brokers" who can search nurseries for you. All should come
up on a Google search.


That said, what is it you like about M7s? I have a few of them. They are
free-standing, rugged, well-anchored, hardy, vigorous, but rather large.
Do you want to grow apples or wood? There are several other varieties
that are smaller (yet still free-standing), mature earlier, have
increased disease resistance, and won't sucker as badly. Ok, ok,
suckering is not that bad a thing. If a mature M7 tree dies, then perhaps
you can graft onto one of the surviving root suckers. But, until that day
comes, you'll be burning out your weed whackers, and re-wrapping your M7s
as the suckers pop out of the ground at the base, and along your root
systems. Still, if "pick your own" is what you want, then M7s will
tolerate a LOT of abuse from the public.


So, get on Google. Check out Cummins' website. Give 'em a call. Tell them
I sent you.....and they'll charge you double!  ;)
