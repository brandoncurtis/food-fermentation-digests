Almost certainly this is pectin.  I asked Peter; he said he didn't use
pectinase.


Alcohol causes the pectin to coalesce (I think it's proper to say that it
actually does "set" the pectin).  I've had this happen with hard cider in
bottles, months after the cider was bottled...but that was a lower EtOH
level of course.  Still, the deposit you describe is just like what I've
had.

I regularly pasteurize carbonated cider in 100 gallon lots with no problems.
Over the years I have lost two bottles, neither was an "explosion"  just
bottle failure. Granted I use a stronger bottle than the bottles you are
using, but with a little care I think you can do it.


I would check two things, first the fill level. If you are not leaving
adequate head space in the bottle, the cider may be expanding beyond the
head space from the heat and causing the problem. Second, since you are
carbonating, perhaps you are overloading the carbonation. Check the
temperature and amount of CO2 being added.  There are tables available for
example if the cider is cooled to 30- 32 F only about 8-9 psi of CO2 is
needed for adequate carbonated.

I've left Goldrush on the tree for several years , and it hangs well
into the frozen season. Have not tried it , but the fact that it does
not drop readily also nature of the apple seems as if it is an excellent
candidate for an ice cider harvested like ice wine grapes

Subject: New extension manual on Hard Cider Production

We are pleased to announce the publication of our new 48-page extension
manual, PNW621 Hard Cider Production and Orchard Management in the
Pacific Northwest, of potential interest to orchard growers and cider
makers, both commercial and private.  It is based on our work in variety
evaluation and cider making trials at WSU Mount Vernon NWREC.   Copies
cost $8 and can be ordered here

See attached flyer for further details.

For those who don't read the Cider-Workshop discussion forum, I would like
to invite you to participate to this.
I have plotted quite a few data points of pH measurements vs titrable
acidity of fresh juice and would like to make some statistical analysis
from them. However, the more data there is, the better the statistical
analysis will be.
Please see the workshop thread here:
http://groups.google.com/group/cider-workshop/browse_frm/thread/c0702feaeacc
967e


So, if you have taken such measurements of pH AND titrable acidity from
samples of juice, would you accept to share that data so I could add it to
what I already have?


Thank you for your cooperation.
Claude
