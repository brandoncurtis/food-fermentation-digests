Sorry, but this will not in the least prevent a bottle from exploding.  At
best it might contain the mess if one explodes...but perhaps not even that!
Depends on what you mean by "a plastic container".


If you have severely stressed bottles, yes they can explode in storage,
and you might contain that.  BUT if they're not ready to blow almost-
spontaneously, yet still severely stressed, they will let go as soon as
they experience epsilon additional challenge--such as being taken out of
the container, set down on a counter before opening, etc.  Don't kid
yourself.  Don't play close to the edge.


Moreover, none of this has to do with the thread under discussion, which
was bottles exploding as a result of pasteurization.  Well, at least *I*
wouldn't put a cardboard 6-packer into a 160 F water bath...there are far
better ways to make papier mache.

So, I just defrosted some frozen, pasteurized juice from my orchard this
past summer.  It's been in the fridge for just 5-days.  Is this suitable
to top off my secondary fermenters (really tertiary in this case) of New
England Style and Blackberry cider?


I assume with time the residual yeast will digest the added sugars.


Cheers,

Steven Edholm:


     Given your site description, the Bud.9/MM.111 system would seem a
good choice.  The MM.111 stock is fairly aggressive and should forage
well for what water is available.  In future, I think you might want
to trial Geneva 16 instead of interstems and come in to still closer
spacings.
     I think your 10 ft and 12 ft spacings could be a wee bit loose,
but I would rather have empty space than have to fight a thicket.
     We strongly suggest that the interstem tree be planted deep, so
the Bud.9 is half buried.  Yes, the Bud.9 will take root; and No, the
rooted Bud.9 will not come to dominate tree growth.

Thank you all for your suggestions.  Regarding possible thermal shock,
I live in northern Wisconsin, and I deal with cold temperatures when I
pasteurize, that is unavoidable.  I have been very careful while lifting
the bottles out of the boiling water, I can't imagine anything I could do to
further limit physical shock either.  After considering the very thoughtful
advice I received, my best guess is that my problem is a combination of too
much carbonation and too little headspace.  I happen to like my sparkling
apple juice very fizzy, but I will have to exchange a few bubbles for a few
less bombs.  I will leave some extra head space and go with less bubbles
and keep my fingers crossed.  I may also see about building some kind of
"shark cage" setup to hold the bottles so if they explode, the cage will
stop flying glass.  I may also consider trying a few champagne bottles, but
I already have a ton of beer bottles, so I am hoping I can get by with them.
