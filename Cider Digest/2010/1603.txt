I was under the impression that only Champagne bottles were strong enough
for fully-conditioned sparkling hard cider. I've done it in beer bottles
without any blowups, but it wasn't as carbonated. My Champagne bottle cider
blows the cork like a rocket, it would shatter a wineglass if it hit it.


Best,

If you are working in a very cold space, rapid cooling may be a major issue.
As for a "shark cages"  try using plastic milk cartons and they seem to
withstand a fair amount of indirect heat.

Ice cider has recieved comments lately on the digest. I am completely
ignorant on the subject so I ask the following question?, What is the
difference between using regular juice and juice from just thawed frozen
apples? Does it make a difference how long the apples are frozen? Jack in
Wenatchee, Washington.
