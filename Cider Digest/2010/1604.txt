Jack, the trick with ice cider isn't that the fruit -was- frozen, it's
that it wasn't thawed. When you press the fruit frozen, the ice crystals
(which are relatively pure water) stay in the press, and the juice comes
out strong. Canadian law sets a minimum spec, somewhere about 30 brix,
from memory. US law doesn't regulate ice cider.


Canadian law also allows for in season harvest and cold storage of the
fruit until freezing conditions. That's different from ice wine.


When I started my Cidery, I knew of only one Canadian ice cider maker who
froze fruit on the tree, and it wasn't the main producer of ice cider. The
biggest player maintained (then) that tree frozen was inferior. But since
then, I understand that a lot of progress has been made in finding cultivars
and micro climates where tree freezing works.


In the US, since the term isn't regulated explicitly, it's hit or miss
whether you can get a label approved. Ten years ago, they were reject
outright. But times change.


The high brix makes for a hard fermentation. Ice cider is wine strength
and high (!) in residual sugar, acid and flavor.

Jack,
Ice cider is about concentrating the juice by freezing.
The principle is that a sugar solution freezes at a lower temperature than
pure water, so freezing permits to separate and remove pure water from the
juice.
You can either freeze the apples and press them partially thawed so there
are some pure ice cristals remaining in the apple, or you can freeze the
juice and remove the ice as it forms. Some evaporation is also useful to
help concentrate more.
In any case, you are aiming at a starting sugar concentration of Brix 30 or
SG of 1.130.
You then ferment this down to about SG 1.080 - 1.060 to have some 13 to 20%
residual sugar. The trick is to stop the fermentation at this stage and to
insure the cider remains stable at such a high sugar content.

RE: Ice cider [Jack O Feil]


Hi Jack - ice cider can be made two ways - from juice that
is frozen and from apples that are frozen. The most
important thing is that the brix is at least 30 when you
start fermentation (s.g. somewhere around 1.140 - 1.150).
Residual sugar of the final product should be at least 13%.
These are the Quebec legal definitions for ice cider -
that's the only government body that has set standards. hope
that's helpful -
