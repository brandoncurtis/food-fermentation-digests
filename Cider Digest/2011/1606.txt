The names on Cider Digest have become friends, and I've had the pleasure
of meeting some of you in person at the Franklin County Cider Day.  Now,
I'm wondering, would some of you be willing to post your locations to a
shared Google Map so that others could search you out for advice in person?


I realize that this raises the specter of privacy issues, so participants
would be taking a chance that others would not use this as an opportunity
for midnight scrumping next fall.


Any takers?

The short answer is:  It won't work, and you don't want to try to do it
that way anyhow.


There are yeasts with low alcohol tolerance, but not that low.  Moreover,
you can't depend on them to hit the brakes and stop on a dime...even if
they have low alcohol tolerance, they'll gradually coast to a stop (and
may overshoot your mark).

Don't.  You won't like the result.


I'd suggest you let your cider ferment out, then since you're wanting a
lawnmower cider, you can cut it to reduce alcohol and sweeten it, at the
time you drink it.

John,
Unfortunately, it is not so easy, and you will not find such a yeast!
Making a slightly sweet or off-dry cider naturally, without any chemical or
heat or micro-filtering etc. is considered as the summum of the
cidermaker's art...


It starts in the orchard where you need to grow old standard trees of late
varieties, and these trees should not be fertilized so to yield low
Nitrogen apples.
Then you need to press these apples in an "almost overripe" condition to be
in the best position to succeed in the next step.
Then you have to do a keeve in which the pectins will undergo some
transformation and will make a gelly in your cider, which will rise and
form a brown hat (chapeau brun). This will clarify the juice and remove
some nutrients.
After that, you ferment the keeved juice in a cool room to get a slow
fermentation (a year or sometimes more).


And that's it, the fermentation will stop naturally from the exhaustion of
nutrients and you will get a stable cider with some residual sugars.

Making a low alcohol/sweet cider is the Holy Grail of many cidermakers. As
you explore this subject you will find out why and the various solutions
which range from removing the nutrient (Keeving) to dilution (industrial
cider).  I am sure others will comment in detail but like all things in life
the journey will be as much fun as the destination.
