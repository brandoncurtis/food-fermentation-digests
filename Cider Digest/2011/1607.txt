The names on Cider Digest have become friends, and I've had the pleasure
of meeting some of you in person at the Franklin County Cider Day.  Now,
I'm wondering, would some of you be willing to post your locations to a
shared Google Map so that others could search you out for advice in
person?


I realize that this raises the specter of privacy issues, so
participants
would be taking a chance that others would not use this as an
opportunity
for midnight scrumping next fall.


Any takers?

Regarding Al's request to put us on a Google map, yes we would be
happy to be included. Our apple farm and farm distillery are located
here:
Golden Harvest Farms
3074 US Highway 9
Valatie, NY 12184


I make vodka, brandy (eau de vie) and applejack at our farm
distillery. Our applejack is really just an aged apple brandy,
distilled in a pot still like rum or whiskey. Lately I've been
compounding our hard cider by freezing it, drilling holes in the ice
and emptying the fortified cider. This is the traditional way of
making applejack; it's labor intensive and delicious. I've been making
it with 5 gal pails in our walk-in freezer. Aside from being stronger
in alcohol, the residual sugar (as well as flavor) is  compounded. The
frozen hard cider also has pleasant acidity, which is lost when we
distill hard cider in the pot still.


Is anyone else experimenting with freeze-fortified applejack? Is there
a name for this?
