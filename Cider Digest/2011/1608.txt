Ed, what I mean is from my experience, to have a successful keeve, it is
preferable to start with apples that are low in Nitrogen, and old
unfertilized standard trees are known to yield apples that are lower in N
than dwarf trees. Also, young trees will generally yield higher N level
than older trees. As a general rule, if your apples are as large as
commercially grown apples, they will likely be low in sugar and high in N.
If they are rather small, you are more likely to have higher sugar and
lower N...


As far as your varieties are concerned, I note you have 2 that are highly
acclaimed cider apples (Harrison and Hewes), and the others should be OK. I
would probably add a few high sugar russet apples, such as Belle de Boskoop
or Golden Russet. Maybe also a few low acid varieties would be an asset,
like Yarlington Mill for example.

well my info is
Daniel C. Rowland, Highland, NY 12528
I dont have an orchard address as im still trying to nail down a lease
for a place for the 900+ cider trees coming this spring (It was suppose
to be done last Feb, but the land owner has been dragging their feet, so
im basically in emergency mode trying to find an alternative; wink wink
anybody who knows anybody with at least 6 acres of orchard land in the
Esopus/Highland/Marlboro area that would be willing to lease for minimum
of 50 years, ideally lease to own, let me know, wink wink). We will be
applying for our cider/wine making permit as soon as we have a lease.


Derek, Ive been doing lots of ciders, and since they are all basically
freezing over now im gonna try the old applejack trick (b.t.w. applejack IS
the name for freeze concentrated cider, I dont really know how to classify
your "applejack" product, being three times distilled and, im guessing,
barrel aged as a spirit, not a cider).  Im assuming the freezing technique
was concieved as a way to avoid paying taxes on distilling, although I dont
think you get away with that today lol.  One thing im going to experiment
is whether it makes a difference if the freeze-concentration happens was an
unfermented juice, partially fermenting must, and totally fermented cider.
As a control I will use juice from the same pressing.  In the context of
your operation, if your taking the ice off of frozen fully fermented cider,
you might be able to recycle any remaining alcohol out of the slush with
your still. And on a side note, I have some of your pear eau de vie,
and Id swear by the nose its made of Bosc pears, but your website says
its Bartlett, was there a change or is my nose wrong?

I would be interested to hear about the traditional Applejack method by
freezing, if anyone can add to this I would be interested?
Cheers.

Hello All,


I have finalized plans for the first Annual Cidermakers' Conference. This
is going to be an informal event lead by the interest of the folks who
show up. The overall goal of the conference is to bring the greater
commercial cider community together in the hopes to lead to more formal
organized conferences and events in the future. The event is open to all
commercial cider makers and interested licensed distributors and retailers
of ciders. Attendance to the Conference is capped at 75.


Please respond to this posting at info@wanderingaengus.com with your name,

moderators for round tables, folks to organize samples, and to help out
on the day of the event. And please contact me with any questions.
