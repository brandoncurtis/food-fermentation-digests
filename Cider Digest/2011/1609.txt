While I've read a lot about cider making and judged cider quite a few times,
I've only made ciders but just from commercially available drinking cider.
Other than the basics, I don't know apples.   Our club would be interested
in having a local orchard do a custom pressing but we need to specify the
apples.  I don't know at the moment what apples they have.   They are
unlikely to have anything very rare or heritage and the cider they typically
have is just good drinking cider.   Could someone specify a selection of
sugar apples, acidic apples and apples for tannins that I can use to talk to
the orchard.   At least with a list of apple varieties for each of the three
categories it will be a good starting point.


TIA,

It seems unlikely that a commercial product based on fractional
crystalization and marketed as such would be allowed. The applejack process
purifies the water removed from a fermented cider and leaves the aldehydes,
ketones and oily alcohols behind. These are the volatile organics
responsible for one's "apple palsy" after drinking too much jack, not the
ethanol level. A properly distilled apple brandy does not contain these
VOCs because the heads and tails are thrown out leaving a purified ethanol
in the product. In contrast applejack, depending on how cold it gets in
your neck of the woods, just concentrates these paint stripping
undesireables in the beverage. Apply for a distiller's license and
handcraft an artisan brandy or calvados instead.
