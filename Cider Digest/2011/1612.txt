You might take another look at the Federal labeling regulations.  I believe
there are alternatives to having to go through the COLA process for cider.
It is my understanding if it is less than 7%, labeling can be done to FDA
standards which do not require approval, just adherence. Having said this,
I do not know what the FDA standard is for the term "Organic".  I am not a
attorney and understanding Federal regulations is no easy task. I did
settled the issue to my satisfaction over decade ago with the TTB and the
State LCB. Needless to say my abv is 6.8% and all ingredients are fully
disclosed along with appropriate disclosures for sulfites, government
warning and producer information which are found on wine labels. This seems
to satisfy everyone and it keeps the federal and state tax rates low.

Bit of an off topic question: I was racking off my carboys last night
and in the bottom of one was the bloated body of a dead mouse. Must
have fallen in during primary ferment when I left it open overnite. My
first question was to dump or keep the batch, however my gag reflex
answered that one. Fortunately it was a batch from some dessert apples
and not that important to me. Thank goodness he didn't climb into one
of the Kingston Black carboys right next to it. Not sure what I would
have done...


Here's my question: Of the five carboys I put up from the same
pressing of mixed dessert apples four remained thick and cloudy. Only
the one with the mouse in it dropped totally clear with a large build
up of lees at the bottom. What caused this? Half joking but it does
intrique me... Anyone?
I've read about the old timers throwing meat in their ciders but don't
think it's related.


Thanks

Hello.  We are in our first year pressing with a used Goodnature SX 280.  It
was all going smoothly for a while, but now while pressing well-sweated
Albemarle (Newtown) Pippins, the press racks want to rise or dive between
the bags.  The force is enough to break several of the cable ties on each
pressing, and even to bend the bars on the scissor mechanism!  The ties are
definitely installed with enough slack to allow the scissor mechanism to
fully close.  The pectin may be a factor because when we use both pectinase
and rice hulls, we seem to lose fewer ties.  The problem is significantly
greater on a second pressing than the first.  This may be because the pomace
is vertically much less evenly distributed in the bags.  Nonetheless it
happens on first presses as well.


Goodnature suggested having the top ties snug and the bottom loose, as well
as making sure our speed is slow enough, but that hasn't eliminated the
issue.


Has anyone encountered this situation?  Has anyone found a solution?


I have posted a video of the racks moving and ties snapping to help make the
situation clear.  It's at:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC3J8DAs2Jc


Thanks for your thoughts.
