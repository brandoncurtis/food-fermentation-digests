Don't forget that if you do go the FDA label regulation route that you
must also include the nutrition facts panel if you sell more than a
certain $$ amount of products.

A nurmber of articles and books about cider have recommended that cider
that is fermented and aged at low temperatures will have a better flavor
than if those processes take place at higher temperatures. I realize
the biochemistry of taste is very complex, but does anyone know what the
differences are? Andrew, was this issue investigated at Long Ashton at
some time?

I have used the smaller SX 6 for years, the SX 6 does not flex or deform the
plates, but apple mash squirts out of the bags at the top making for a messy
job.  I find the best solution is to find a firmer apple to blend with
softer apples and run the press very slowly. You might try not filling the
bags over half full or perhaps not filling all the bags on your much bigger
SX 280.  It will slow you down but not destroy equipment.


Soft fruit is a problem on any equipment, we just brought in 600 gallons of
late press juice done on a Frontier belt press and the operators were
complaining on how slow the pressing took and the poor rate of extraction.
Otherwise they were happy to be able to sell otherwise unmarketable desert
apples.

Many years ago,having attended Peter Mitchell's course here in the UK at
Pershore ,I recall him commenting on the practice of suspending a leg
of mutton in a vat of cider,and when the flesh had disappeared and the
bones were clean the cider was fit to drink,primarily it was done if you
had a "stuck" fermentation,to stimulate the wild yeasts to work.He said
if you analized this ,it's basically blood and flesh which is nitrogen
and phosphate in it's crudest form which would encourage the yeasts to
do their job,no doubt Andrew Lea will anwer in more detail.I'm sure your
cider will do you no harm,although your authorities would beg to differ,it
should help your natural internal antibody level!would be interested to
compare flavour viz the other carboys.

Catching up on an answer to an old question here. This really isn't as
hard as it's made out to be, given a few caveats. Start with low N
juice, as Claude mentioned, but it doesn't have to be strictly from a
non-managed 'wild' tree. Lightly fertilized commercial apples will do,
especially if on gravelly or sandy soil. Press when dead ripe, this is
for quality's sake. You can try a keeve but I don't recommend it any
more,it's fairly unpredictable and a real PITA. Rather, lightly (say, 50
ppm) sulfite the juice off the press, then pitch 1/3 to 1/2 the
recommended dose of Epernay or Cotes des Blancs yeast, then get it into
a cool (<50 F) spot. My naturally cold room in the cellar starts the
fermenting season off in October at 55 F and goes down to 40 by
December, and hits 32 during cold snaps. You can replicate this in an
old refrigerator if you want. Don't rack, let it bubble slowly until
you've reached the desired alcohol/sweetness, then drop the temp to as
close to 32 that you can if you need to to clear the juice a bit.
Transfer to a keg and dose with 25-5- ppm sulfite. Now set up a plate
filter between one keg and another, run through a 0.5 micron pad, and
voila- sweet, sparkling cider. It might not keep forever, but it will be
pretty stable.

re: Seth Jones' floater question


In my research, I remember the English saying "A rat in every vat" as the
varmints would fall in occasionally and the additional protein would get
the fermentation going.
