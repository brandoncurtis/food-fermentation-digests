I have a couple 20 Liter test batches of cider brewing. I am going to have
to store it and let it age. Can anyone suggest an appropriate storage
container for the cider. Currently, it is in home brew buckets but, when I
cut it for the final product I will be out of room in the buckets.


Thanks,


Sean

Hello,
Does anyone have information on the demographics of people who drink =
cidre as compared to other refreshment beverages?
Thanks,
Dwight Brown

Fundamentally it's the same recommendation as for white wine making. Low
fermentation temperatures (say 15C) tend to lead to greater ester
synthesis and retention, and typically a diminished amount of higher
(fusel) alcohols. If you are using wild yeast fermentations, then
another factor is that at lower temperatures ca 10C the
non-Saccharomyces yeasts tend to perform better than their cultured
cousins and this might be seen as beneficial to those of us who value a
little 'apiculate' flavour. Not all cidermakers think like this. Some
large UK cidermakers like to ferment at 25C because it's quicker and
they get a flavour profile which they say suits their products better
that way.

As others have said, the traditional effect of throwing meat in is to
speed up fermentation by supplying amino acids and nutrients. But your
question is a little different. It is difficult to be sure but it could
be that the extra protein from the mouse acted a bit like a gelatin
fining and hence brought down the haze by combining with juice
'tannins'. Or it could be that some enzymes from the mouse's stomach or
gut had some pectinolytic or proteolytic activity which might also clear
a haze. (I know I am arguing two contradictory mechanisms here but in
the absence of evidence these are just "possibilities".)

I am very interested in that, Terry. Can you make it work reliably year
on year? And how long does the cider store in that state? And what SG do
you typically bottle it at?  I like your idea of controlling a cultured
yeast by low dose and low temperature - most of us have felt that a weak
wild mixed yeast (with all its unpredictability) was the only way. Have
you ever measured the YAN levels of the apples?

Re Terry's method for sweet, sparkling cider--basically ferment slowly and
cool to desired level, then chill, rack to keg, sulfite, filter...


Seems the key is the cold, since this cider isn't likely to be shelf-stable
at room temp if you bottled off the keg.  Not a bad idea though.  Various
questions and puzzlements...


>...You can try a keeve but I don't recommend it any

I've avoided keeving for those reasons, but do other folks who do keeving
feel like it's become more predictable with the enzyme (and possibly Ca)
treatments?  Or is it still a crapshoot for the home/small cidermaker?

Why the reduced dose?  I realized I do this myself but I'm not sure I can
justify it!  Unless you're also hoping for some wild-yeast activity,
doesn't it just delay the fermentation?  That is, won't the yeast
population eventually build up to where it would have been with a "full
dose"?  I'm not criticizing the technique; I just don't understand (even
though I've acted as if I did:)

(Was the "25-5-" a typo for 25-50?)


Are you really able to go straight to 0.5 micron dependably?  Or do you
(sometimes) need coarser pads first?
