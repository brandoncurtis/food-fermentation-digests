Folks, if you are running MS Windows on the computer you use to receive
the Cider Digest, PLEASE do a virus scan if you haven't done one lately.


One or more of you on the list have badly infected machines, acting as
"spambots".


Every time I send out a digest, I get sprayed with spam here.  Most of it
is caught or deflected, but I can see it happening in reports.


Most likely it means your machine is harvesting addresses from incoming
email...which means you're also exposing the Digest contributors to
spam.  That's not nice.

I have a friend in the SF Bay area that is 
looking for artisan cider for sale in the area.


Anybody out there have any leads on outlets 
that I could pass along?  She lives in Walnut 
Creek...


Thanks,


Al

Pete: The applicable NOSB regulation can be found here:   


http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/janqtr/pdf/7cfr205.605.pdf  
"Sulfur dioxide-for use only in wine labeled ''made with organic grapes,''
Provided, That, total sulfite concentration does not exceed 100 ppm."


As far as TTB is concerned fermented apple juice IS wine, IF it exceeds 7%
A.C. Whether or not this is an intentional bias or mere clerical error,
it should read (strikethrough and italics mine):


Sulfur dioxide - for use only in wine as defined in 27 CFR 24.10, and
labeled "made with organic grapes (insert name of agricultural product(s)
here)", Provided, That, total sulfite concentration does not exceed 100 ppm."


(link to 27CFR 24.10 here):  


http://frwebgate3.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=l3V6q1/3/1/0&WAI
Saction=retrieve


As the intent of the NOSB is to protect the consumer interested in organic
products, not place a firewall between them and quality products that
might be available, this really should get fixed. No small task.
