A: 5.8 bar (ca 87 psi).


This is an application of Henry's Law see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law  You can set up the equations
on a spreadsheet and get the pressure for any vol of CO2 at any
temperature.


The relevant equations (to be read in conjunction with the Wikipedia
article) are


KH = 0.034*EXP(2400*((1/T)-(1/298)))  where T is the temp in degrees K
(i.e. degrees C + 273)


CO2g/L = CO2vol * 1.964.


CO2mol = (CO2g/L)/44


P(bar gauge) = (CO2mol/KH) - 1


These give data identical to the many published carbonation tables, at
least for temperatures up to 30C. I am assuming that these relationships
continue to be valid at somewhat higher temperatures too. These
equations are strictly only valid for CO2 in water, but the effect of
sugar and alcohol on CO2 solubility is actually rather slight.


At 10C the pressure in the same bottle computes as 0.7 bar
At 20C it is 1.3 bar
At 30C it is 2.0 bar

Subject: Flex tanks in cider making?

Hello,


As a light weight and low cost alternative to stainless steel, Flex Tanks
have gained popularity among traditional wineries.  The tanks are designed
to replicate the oxygen exchange rates of oak barrels, and offered in
different thicknesses.  However, I have not found mention of their use by
any cider makers.  Is this due more to allegiance to traditional materials
or to some perceived limitations with polyethylene?  From a cost standpoint
they appear very attractive, but I'm concerned about potential spoilage.


Any thoughts would be appreciated.


Thanks,
JW

I am interested in what fermentation vessels others are using for 20-25 and
40-50 gallon volumes.  I've been using cornies for fermentation and storage but
intend to  increase production next year to a level (80-100 gallons) that makes
their use less practical for fermenting.  Ideally I would like to continue to
transfer product to corny kegs with CO2 for storage/dispensing and avoid the
need for/use of a pump, but if you have a good solution that involves a pump,
I'd like to hear about it.  Specific product information and sources would be
most appreciated.  Thanks.


Richard S.
