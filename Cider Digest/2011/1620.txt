I worked for a natural foods company that bottled and labeled in pints and
half-pints from 50 gal. drums, and they had a simple mechanical labeling
machine. It was hand-fed,  had three little rollers, it spun the bottles and
fed a water-wiped label onto each one. It worked steadily, and it had to be
inexpensive, since it was about as complicated as a tape gun with water.
Sorry, no details, but I would think the manufacturer still exists. The
machine looked like it was designed around 1934.


Happy fermentation,
Michael McClatchey

Who is the vendor for these?

This is not that easy. You have to consider this Sharp-Bittersweet-Sweet
classification was made for the English cider making situation, and doesn't
apply very well to the N.American situation. In England, most of the cider
apple crop is bittersweets and they need some sharps do increase acidity
and lower pH of their blends.


Here, most commercial apple varieties are fairly high in acidity and very
seldom will it be necessary to add sharp cider apples. Most of the time we
would need to add more bittersweets or sweets than what we have... In
general, I find it preferable to plant N.American varieties that have a
high sugar content, like russets for example, and then these may be blended
with some low-acid varieties like English bittersweets to lower the acidity
and add some tannins.

Neither Mac nor Jonagold are English cider apples, and that classification
doesn't really apply to them... Macs generally will have an acidity level
varying between medium and high depending on how and where it is grown.
Sugar content may be anywhere between low and high... You need to find how
it will do at your location and under your cultural practices before you
can evaluate how good it is going to be for cider.


>Is there a defacto list that I can look at that is considered the industry
>standard to help me choose my varieties?


I am afraid the answer to that is NO! It all comes down to experience!

Hi there...we just wanted to pass this along. We meant to send this out
earlier, so hopefully there's enough material to get a digest out before
this event takes place.


Bellwether Hard Cider will be hosting our annual Cidermaker's Get
Together on Sunday, March 27th beginning at 3pm. Everyone is
welcome...home cidermakers, commercial cidermakers, cider enthusiasts,
and folks who are just curious! If you have a cider you've made, we ask
that you bring a bottle or two to share. In the past we have had well
over 30 different ciders and other libations to try. Bring things you're
proud of, things you'd like feedback on, or things that have gone
mysteriously wrong-everything is fair game! Please also bring a dish to
pass (we need to soak up all the alcohol with something!). The event is
free and open to all. It starts around 3pm and goes until we give up!
Visit our website for more information at www.cidery.com
