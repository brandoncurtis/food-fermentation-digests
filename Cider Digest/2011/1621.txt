I asked this about six years ago; time to see what's happened...


Are there any suppliers of bag-in-box packaging in the US for
small-quantity purchasers?  If so, please give details!


By "small quantity" I mean maybe a dozen or two bags/boxes at an order.
I'd like to see 3-5-10 liter sizes if possible.


Note that I'm asking specifically for availability in the US!  I know
they're readily available in the UK.

Greif Brothers in Mt. Sterling, KY manufactures the food grade
drums.  I've also seen them in Nicholasville, KY at Lexington
Container.
