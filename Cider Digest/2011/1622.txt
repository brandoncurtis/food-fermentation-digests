+1 to everything Claude says here.  I found out the long, slow, hard,
expensive way that almost everything written about cider apple blending,
based on English or French conditions, doesn't really work well here in
NA.  Even in my case, with a climate much more like England than almost
anywhere in NA, the apples just don't follow the script.  What has
worked best for me is, as Claude recommends, growing high-sugar apples
and bittersweets; no sharps needed at all.  It has taken me about 10
years to figure out which varieties work best here; now I'm reworking a
lot of my trees to get more of those.


Cultural practice is often overlooked when discussing cider apples.
Almost all commercial orchards pick their fruit before it is fully ripe,
which makes a huge difference in the way the cider will ferment and
taste.  If you grow your own you can allow them to fully ripen on the
tree, accepting the (mostly economic) drawbacks of this practice as part
of the price for really good cider.  You're pretty much going to have to
grow your own bittersweets anyway.  Plan on spending a few years
learning when to pick them; it's not as obvious as it  might seem.


Finding the right high-sugar, high-flavor, low-acid apple to form the
base of your blend is usually the hardest part here.  I recommend
looking into Golden Russet and, especially, King David; these seem to
get favorable results in many parts of North America.  Which
bittersweets (and how many) to blend in will depend on your climate,
soil, cultural practice, etc.  Yarlington Mill and Muscat de Bernay work
well for me; also Taylor's and Fillbarrel, but those are a little
fussier about timing (picking and pressing).  Porter's Perfection also
has performed well for me, especially in years when the Golden Russets
were particularly low-acid.  As Claude says, it all comes down to
experience, and I'd emphasize that it's only _local_ experience, because
the growing conditions in North America vary so dramatically from place
to place.


Good luck!

Scholle is a bag-in-box manufacturer.  Their North American Rep
suggested contacting wineries. He mentioned English Estates at
1-360-260-4170 in Vancouver, WA.

If there are any, I'd love to know, Dick. I tried to source two dozen
last fall from Jigsaw in the UK, but shipping costs made that approach
prohibitive. Upon their recommendation, I spoke with Smurfit-Kappa in
Canada (great folks), but they had a one-box minimum order of 125 bags
(as I recall), and no leads on any retail distributors. I subsequently
called and/or corresponded with SpaceKraft, Scholle, and RePak. No luck. I
was finally able to source a few samples from Smurfit and CDF Cheertainer,
so I'm trying those out for possible bulk purchase next season.


Seems like an opportunity for a reseller here in the US...maybe someone's
already done it. I'm sold on using the things, and failing a retail source,
perhaps someone here on the Digest could go in on a minimum order split
next time I'm needing some smaller bags.
