Dick,


You make a good point "We need a Vigo, a Jigsaw, a bottle/cap supplier,
etc., who won't
balk at small orders.  Or, to back up a bit, we need to find ways to
organize or collaborate so that we can make these needs known and give
businesses the opportunity to meet them."


This sounds like an opportunity to create a distributor for small business.
Mail order.   Buy in bulk to resell to home and small craft cider makers.
Humm.....

Nancy, it's partly technique and partly equipment.


The dosage should be cold and well filtered. I added .5 g opti-white yeast
hulls to 5 gallons of dosage once, and the effect was remarkable.


The disgorged cider should be at least cool.


TDD Grilliat makes good dosage equipment. Perrier used to make a single
head unit.  The dosage unit captures any foam during dosage addition and
recycles it to top up the bottle.

Most ciders flavored in various ways seem to go in and out of fashion.
A few types seem to be established for the longer term.  For example,
raspberry is just an obvious addition for a summertime cider, and
mulling spices are a traditional winter addition.


OK, I'm going out on a limb to predict a new style which could become
fashionable, and might even establish itself: smoked cider.  Hang on;
hear me out!  For one thing, smoked beer is already well known (the
"Rauchbier" style).  Consider, though, a cider with not just a smoky
character added, but a specific type:  bacon.  More to the point,
applewood-smoked bacon.  Now you see the connection?  Moreover, the
character of an English West Country cider which has gone through MLF
is often described to include a "smoky bacon" note.  It seems obvious!
Imagine being able to take that flavor note and make it "go to 11."


Bacon is currently enjoying a surge in popularity, and although it had
been predicted to have a short run, it has staying power, lasting already
a couple years beyond what was expected.  Bacon is also recognized as
the "gateway drug" for vegetarians:  The single most common item which
causes vegetarians to revert to eating meat is bacon.  It's powerful
stuff!


However, there is a technical challenge:  The flavor of bacon is
substantially carried in the fat, and obviously you don't want any
fats in a cider.  Think about what happens as they go rancid--bleagh!
Now, while the chemists in a large food conglomerate could surely find
a way to extract the flavor and leave the lipids behind (I'd guess they
already have done so), it's more challenging for those of us who are
(a) working on a small scale, and (b) wanting not to use processes or
chemicals unseemly to an otherwise-fairly-natural product.  But I'm
sure we can find a way through that one problem.


Imagine how the foodies would be fawning over a pure, natural fermented
cider (with apples picked from carbon-sequestering trees, of course),
with an essence of bacon made from free-range pork and organic apple
wood in a solar-powered smoker!!

FWIW, I have conversed with my local wine making supply store owner, who also
has a significant web-based business, about our issues and suggested this as a
possible new product line for them.  She appeared very interested when I
described the national network that the Cider Digest represents and she is
looking into the matter.  I even gave her the manufactures names to make it
simple.  I encouraged a minimum order as an experiment and suggested the 3 to 5
liter size range and foil-lined bags if available.  Will advise when I get a
response.

I'm switching all my medium (2-10L)size packaging to PET containers. may
be an option for you guys as well.


If it is under 750ML I'll keep glass. If it is over that then PET and
Stainless for 15Gal or more.
