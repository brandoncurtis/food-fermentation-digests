In regards to topic of smoked cider, I would like to offer our
experience with it. We are making smoked cider commercially, and have
had great success with it in the last two batches. The feedback we
have gotten has been fantastic. We use a local German deli,
specializing in smoked meats, to cold smoke the apples for us. On a
smaller scale, a home smoker would probably do ok, but they are able
to smoke over 100 lbs at a time for us.
We do not halve, or peel the apples.  The skin actually picks up an
amazing amount of the smoke, which is great because doing any large
quantity would be impractical.
We have been serving our smoked cider now for about a month or so,
both on draft and on cask. It is not for everyone that comes into our
shop, but the people that like it..love it!!

The Great Lakes Cider & Perry Association is pleased to announce winners
of the 6th Annual Great Lakes International Cider & Perry Competition held
in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on April 2, 2011.   "This is a highly inclusive
competition that is open to all apple and pear fermentation beverages,"
says competition organizer Rex Halfpenny.   There are 19 categories
of entry and three divisions, two commercial and one noncommercial.
The distinction is between those who have license or may lawfully sell
cider or perry in their locale and those who may not.


Entries came from 17 US states and 3 Canadian provinces in wide swaths
from Washington and California to Nova Scotia and from Quebec to Texas.
The competition also extended its international reach as producers in
the English counties of Herefordshire, Warwickshire, Dorset and Suffolk
submitted a variety of ciders and perries.


The Great Lakes Cider & Perry Competition (GLINTCAP) has grown to become the
second largest Pro-Am cider and perry competition in the English-speaking
world, behind the Royal Bath & West Show in Somerset, England.  Although
both competitions showed notable growth this year as cider and perry gains
popularity with a new generation of consumers and producers, the upstart
North American competition has significantly narrowed the gap.   This year
the number of GLINTCAP's commercial entries more than doubled and number of
noncommercial entries rose by 33%.  As new North American cider producers
continue to emerge to serve a growing market GLINTCAP is expected to become
the largest competition of its type within the next two years.


Best of Show awards were made in all three divisions.




In the Commercial Standard/Specialty/Unlimited Cider & Perry Division the
Best of Show award went to Hogan's Cider Ltd. of Warwickshire, England,
for its "Dry English Cider."  Best of Show Honorable Mention went to
Tideview Cider of Halifax, Nova Scotia, for its "Heritage Dry Cider 2007"
in the standard cider category.


In the Commercial Intensified/Distilled Division the Best of Show award
went to County Cider Company of Picton, Ontario, for its "CHOA Ice Cider."
Best of Show Honorable Mention went to Blackstar Farms of Suttons Bay,
Michigan, for its Eau-de-Vie, "Spirit of Pear."


In the Noncommercial Division the Best of Show award went to Gary Awdey
of Valparaiso, Indiana, for his French cider.  Best of Show Honorable
Mentions went to Rick Young of Mount Vernon, Iowa, for his "Snowy River"
standard cider and to Jeff Carlson of Grand Rapids, Michigan, for his
"Westside New England" New England style cider.

The Great Lakes Cider & Perry Association is a not-for-profit organization
incorporated in 2008 with a mission of promoting cider and perry and of
providing related educational opportunities for producers and consumers.
Its core membership is comprised of commercial and noncommercial cidermakers
in the states and province bordering on the Great Lakes.  Additional
information about the Association may be found at www.greatlakescider.com.


Congratulations to all!
