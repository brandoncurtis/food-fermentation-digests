Sorry if any of you were unduly taken-in by my 1 April suggestion of cider
flavored with apple-smoked bacon.  I suspected that there were smoked
ciders out there (after all, why not) but tried to put it OTT with the
bacon part.


Maybe I'm getting too old, or maybe reality is stranger than I can imagine.


OTOH, I got April-Fool'd off-list by one of the Digest subscribers,
so fair's fair.

I just posted a fresh video on YouTube to
document my progress for building low-budget
tanks for fermenting cider.  I got two unused
tanks through Ebay with a combined capacity
of 75 gallons.  I trialed the 15 gallon tank
a year ago after doing some modifications,
but the tap broke and I lost some really good
cider.


I've installed bulkhead fittings to accept
the sample taps, and I'll be using a larger
airlock on the 60 gallon tank.


Interested folks can find the video at

I am dealing with a leak in a tank and have
been wondering what to use to caulk the
hole.  The tank is HDPE, so a food grade
silicon will not stick.


Last night I had a midnight epiphany that I
could make a thick and malleable gasket from
beeswax!  So, here's the question:


Does anyone have experience with beeswax
holding against cider?


I don't want it to be dissolved or corroded
by the juice or cider.


I'm thinking that this could be a nice and
natural solution to my problem.  It really
doesn't have to be that thick (1/4" at the
thickest), and it would fill in gaps from the
curvature of the cone section of the tank.


Here is the link to the video where the valve
and leak are causing me troubles:
