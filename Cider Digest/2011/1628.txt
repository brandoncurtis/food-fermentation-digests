Correcting a couple points in the last digest:


Beeswax is not "sugar based"; it is a wax.  If it didn't resist water,
bees couldn't use it to build a comb which holds honey.  In fact, it will
also resist various common acids.


The melting point of beeswax is rather low--you can soften it in hot tap
water and easily melt it in the top of a double boiler.  I've gotten my
fingers in liquid beeswax momentarily.  It was kinda-unpleasant-hot but
that's about it.


Al posted his questions to the Cider Workshop as well, so we already had
some discussion over there.  Among other points, beeswax isn't at all
elastic (which you might like in a gasket) and the low melting point means
you couldn't clean around it with hot water.

Thanks to all for the insights on using
beeswax as a gasket material.


I am going to give it a try based on comments
and some research.  Beeswax is indeed a wax
with long alcohol strings and the like the do
not appear to be impacted by fermentation,
water, or acid.  The single greatest risk is
the melting point (roughly 145F) that I will
have to dance around when cleaning the tank.
I know that there are candle-making additives
that will raise the melting point of beeswax
if that becomes necessary.


I've ordered a small block of filtered
beeswax, and I'm going to make myself two
HDPE washers to support the bulkhead
collars.  The standard gasket will go between
the collars and the washer, and the beeswax
will be potted between the washers and the
tank walls (filling gaps in the mounting hole).


I'll do my best to document this, and I thank
all for the comments and suggestions!

Sorry for getting off topic, but there is a bacon flavored vodka on the
market in the US.


http://bakonvodka.com


It's only ok straight up, but in a bloody mary it's fantastic.


I see they have a drink recipe using sparkling apple juice as a mixer,
so bakon vodka may just work mixed with a sweeter cider.

Regarding Al's question.  I am the cidermaker at Castle Hill Cider that Ben
mentioned.  I'd like to say that I've successfully used the beeswax sealing,
and could give you a of lot information, but I'm still working on it.


As far as the wax dissolving during fermentation, I feel pretty confident
that that is not an issue.  These vessels have been used for wine
fermentation for thousands of years and are lined with a very thin layer of
beeswax.  After fermentation liquid wax is poured directly on the wine to
seal it during maturation.   Apparently, sometimes when a son is born they
will fill one of these amphora and then serve the wine at his wedding.


I have had less success, thus far.  I have had two kvevri finish
fermentation and have poured the wax on top.  It has shrunk over several
days by about 10%.  I have added more which has cracked.  I think that this
slow shrinkage as the wax is much less plastic might make it a poor gasket
material.  I would echo what Ben said about it retaining heat even as it
loses plasticity (ouch).  It may be worth a try if you've got the patience.
But I suggest testing with water for several days before putting anything
more valuable in there.


I also found the annual Cidermakers Forum at Albemarle Ciderworks to be
terrifically interesting and valuable.


We're taking names of volunteers to clean the kvevri.

Mark Johnson forwarded a note from the More Wine folks about bag-in-box
packaging available in small quantity...
> http://morewinemaking.com/search/103294/beerwinecoffee/coffeewinebeer/Wine_Bot
tles


Unfortunately, it's rather expensive.  The bag+tap is perhaps not so bad,
at $2, but $4.50 for a small cardboard box doesn't sit well!  This makes
the overall package price, for a 5 l bag-in-box, about equivalent to $1
per 750 ml, which is only a slight reduction from glass!


Or, to look at it another way (and repeat some of my whining that we need
suppliers for small producers in NA!:-), in the UK a 5 l bag+tap+box in
small quantity could be had for �1.60 which is $2.67 USD comparable...
and that package is a more usable shape.


Mind you, this is NOT a shot at MoreWine.  They're selling what they can
get, at a price that makes business sense for them.  But it illustrates
one of various obstacles that bag-in-box faces in the US.
