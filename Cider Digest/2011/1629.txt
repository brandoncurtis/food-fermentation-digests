I am working on a business plan for Whetstone CiderWorks, a new cidery
in Vermont.  Part of this is analyzing potential sales, which begs the
question: who buys cider in the US?  I am wondering if any established
cidermakers reading this have any data, or even feel that they have a good
sense from experience, as to the answer(s) to this question.


Some of the specific questions which have come up for me are:


Do you see more overlap with beer or wine markets?  If so, has this
affected your packaging/ distribution choices?  Is there a certain age
range of consumers who seem most likely to buy cider?  Is there a gender
trend in cider buying?


What have those of you selling cider observed as to who drinks what you make?


Thank you,

Just a thought but have you considered medical gasket material?  I'm sure it
would be more expensive than beeswax but would meet FDA food safety
requirements and might meet organic requirements if that were a concern.  A
brief internet search turned up the following website (not an endorsement as
I know nothing about the company) that might provide a starting point.

Silicon gasket material might prove considerably more durable, heat
resistant, and end up being more efficient when considering the hours you
will spend mucking around with wax.  Good luck.
