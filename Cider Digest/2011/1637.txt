Subject: Small-scale cidermaker wishlist 1: Small pump
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>

A while back I said I would try to start a thread on needs of small-scale
commercial cidermakers--meaning under 1000 cases/year and maybe much
smaller.  This actually applies to serious amateur cidermakers as well!
Equipment seems to be a constant challenge once you get above the
occasional-carboy quantity and until you're into the rows-of-gleaming-
stainless-tanks category.  I'll try to write about what's needed, in hopes
at least one of our nearly-1000 subscribers has discovered a solution.


One of the most vexing needs for me has been to find a decent pump at a
reasonable price.


A hallmark of moving past the carboy scale is that you can no longer
afford to be lifting containers and using gravity flow.  You need a way
to move the cider among stationary containers--a pump.


At the small end, there are pumps not particularly designed for the
purpose, and with various problems, for $150 US or under.  The first step
into purpose-made wine pumps in the US seems to involve a jump to over a
thousand dollars, which is just too much for one small component of the
whole system.


What are the desirable/necessary characteristics for a small pump?


Flow rate:  A nice target is 10 gpm, more or less.  Much below that and
you're spending your life watching cider dribble out of a tube.  Much
above that and it's hard to control start/stop.  (Remember, we're small
scale here.)  Variable speed or the ability to throttle the flow is
a big plus.


Pump type:  You don't want something that's going to agitate the cider
a lot.  I feel that rules out diaphragm pumps.  Centrifugal-impeller
pumps look OK, although fast-turning small impellers suggest they'd
also be rough on the cider.


Priming:  You WANT a self-priming pump!  I've got a little pump that
is not self-priming, and it's an incredible nuisance.


Pump materials:  Anything that comes in contact with juice/cider should
be stainless steel (304 or 316) or food-grade plastic.  No brass!  Even
chrome-plated brass is risky in case the plating is breached.


Cleaning:  It should be possible to disassemble the pump chamber to
where you can get at everything and examine it.  Even if you use CIP
during the season, it's reassuring to knock everything down and be
extra-sure it's clean at the end of the season.


Price (?!?):  In Europe, pumps which meet all these criteria can be had
in a range something like 120-250 Euros, which is something like $170-
$350 US.  In the US, I can't find anything suitable under $1500.

#1633 - Charles called me out on Draft Cider:  I agree with everything he
says about it.  my two bits - If you want to be a player in draft business,
first consider cooperage.   Lots of choices out there.  They are all
acceptable as long as they are American Sankey Fitting.  If you rent most
places I have looked into are affordable per keg (7$+/- & you have to clean
em')  but the # of kegs per month is pretty high minimum.  I own my own
cooperage.  I own all shapes and styles.  I buy only used so far,  New ones
are pricey, more than $100each.  I have seen various plastic kegs 25%+ less.
I have never tried them.  I am also seeing one time use kegs coming to
market as well. 2nd Keg Cleaning:  Unless you plan to spend a lot of time
disassembling and cleaning/san.  & reassemble you will need to buy a keg
cleaner.  I have never found a new unit for less than 10k.  My own was 12k
but it has excellent output for my operation. 2 kegs every 3 minutes.  The
table serves as my filling station for upside down filling as well.
Marketing, there is always a few places in every market where price is not
1st concern.  They make up 15% or less of the market.  The other 85% of
draft buyers price becomes their first concern.  So to bust in you almost
always have to be the equal or better.  Unless you can sell ketchup
popsicles to ladies in white gloves.  When I go out and try to hand sell my
own product I will look to see if they have more than 8 tap handles.  I walk
out without asking if there is less than 8.  In my own market(Michigan) my
cider is cheaper than macro cider from both sides of the country.  It still
may not guarantee you a spot.  Here is what draft cider is for me :  A great
way to help introduce people to your product and boost bottle sales in
retail shelves close by. Even money at best.


#1636 - Dan Young & making wooden racks.  We pretty much made them the same
way until we bought plastic ones.  We would use a 2" horizontal slat for a
horizontal to nail the vertical to for extra stiffness at corners and edges.
We used �" spacing.  You can easily stack them to make up space in the
press.


#1630 - #1636  Cider Quality Issues & Marketing - A heated topic. Quality-
two things that I live by, Fruit quality(first rate only) and sanitation;
Clean equipment, buildings, fruit, etc.  Most everything falls into place
after that.   Marketing - I can not imagine anyone starting in the Hard
Cider business without first building a tasting room and local loyal
following.  After 3-5 of really getting their feet wet.  Then bring your
product to market.  If you can hand sell a little here and there to some key
accounts. Then you can go to a distributor and have at least a little
leverage that you have a sustainable product.


Great discussion digesters- been informative and lively - Thank you Janitor!

I have a cider recipe that I have been producing with motts apple juice from
concentrate. I am not sure the base is suitable for commercial production.
Could anyone recommend a good juice supplier. I would prefer to have it in
concentrate and reconstitute it here after arrival in Texas.


Thank You,

Hello Dick,


Good to see that your Cider Digest group is going strong. Please could
you help us? We at the Welsh Perry & Cider Society are organising an
International Craft Cider Festival this August in South Wales, UK. We'd
like to attract pure-juice cider fans from all over the world, so that
they can enjoy sampling craft ciders from France, Germany, Spain, England
and Wales. All of the cidermakers will be there, and there are various
masterclasses throughout the weekend. There are even cask ales from Wales's
best brewer, Otley. Full details are below, please could you distribute
them via your email newsgroup?


Best wishes,

Chairman Welsh Perry & Cider Society


INTERNATIONAL CRAFT CIDER FESTIVAL 2011 12 ? 14 August - Llancaiach Fawr,
CF46 6ER, South Wales


The International Craft Cider Festival 2011 is the first of its kind, and
is set to become a highlight of any real cider-lovers calendar.  We are
bringing together craft cider and perry makers from around the world;
with the first year focussing on producers from France, Germany, Spain,
England and Wales.  Celebrating the artisan craft cider and perry industry,
the festival brings international cider producers, food and music cultures
together to create a three day festival in the beautiful rural valleys of
South East Wales.  Organised and run by the Welsh Perry and Cider Society,
the International Craft Cider Festival is an opportunity for international
cider makers to promote their regions and cidermaking culture. Having
run a successful Welsh Perry and Cider Festival and championships for the
past 9 years, the Welsh Perry and Cider Society are taking this success to
create a much larger, international festival to embrace the world craft
cider movement.  The festival will take place over 3 days and will allow
visitors the opportunity to sample a range of ciders that are produced and
served in a variety of ways. Each cider will bring with it a taste of the
culture of the region from where it was made.


TICKETS NOW ON SALE ?click?  3000 tickets are available each day,
including individual day and weekend tickets with on-site camping also
available for 250 tents/campers.


LIVE MUSIC ?click?  Our line up for the first year is a great mix of
signed and unsigned bands catering to all tastes. Headlining the Friday
night is Fourth Street Traffic, the very same band that won the honour of
opening Cardiff?s new Ninian Park Stadium with the Stereophonics last year.
Also playing are the highly acclaimed Paper Aeroplanes, a favourite of BBC
Radio 2 and Radio Wales; as well as the wonderful sound of Peter Bruntnell;
Chris Summerill; and The Misers, to name but a few. The opening spectacle
though will be the powerful voices of Dowlais Male Voice Choir giving a
true Welsh welcome to our visitors.


MASTERCLASSES ?click?  The range of masterclasses give you the
opportunity to step out from the cider bars and really learn about the
international ciders available to you. With everything from the Asturian
way of pouring cider; to the reason why the German?s call it ?apple
wine?; to some cookery with cider.


Don?t forget there?s also a great range of international food and a
fantastic local market to also keep you going throughout the weekend. For a
more in-depth look at what?s going on with the festival, keep up-to-date
on our website at www.internationalciderfestival.com.
