Small Pump Request:


Dick,


I to have pondered this issue as to what pump I should purchase.
I have not found anything either, yet am growing in volume and haven't
a clue to where I may end up as to production! The most interesting
products to date have been the Enoitalia product line offered by St.
Patrick's.
The Euro 20 or 30 comes to mind.

Just a reminder that the North American fruit
and juice provider map is a continuing work
in progress.

If you sell either cider variety fruit, or
fresh pressed juice, then feel free to send
me a note so that I can include you on the
map.  Autumn will be here before we know it,
and there are thirsty people out there
looking for you!

I hear the pain Dick, pumps are a major item. In my humble experience get
the right equipment. I tried to go cheap, plastic tanks, small pumps and
hose, odd fittings etc. After several years it was all replaced with little
resale value. Next to investing in variable capacity stainless tanks, the
next best purchase was a small winery pump, 23-24 gallons per minute, self
priming plus hose and tri-clamp fittings. Consider that even at 1000 gallons
you are going to move that product least 3 times. We do use other pumps, a
small and cheap rotary pump for the juice tray and a stainless centrifugal
pump that came with the filter unit. For bottling we use CO2 to move the
product from the chiller tank to the filler.  One thing to consider is if
you get good equipment it likely has a decent resale value should you decide
to close up shop. Consider that I paid a outrageous $1000 for the winery
pump, today I think it would sell for the same used since a similar pump is
$1500 new.

I suspect that is a cultural sensitivity ("zero-tolerance") rather than
a true organoleptic sensitivity. Here in Europe we are not so fussy ;-)
Indeed it has been shown that 4-ethyl phenol (the most frequently
measured Brett metabolite) at a level of 2 ppm actually enhances the
flavour of Beaujolais wine. Above 4 ppm it might start to be regarded as
a problem. People might be interested in this paper which attempts to
define the threshold at which it becomes a problem for Europeans in
French cider. The levels determined were 3 ppm for 4-ethyl phenol and 12
ppm for 4-ethyl catechol. Below that threshold it is welcomed. You need
to pay to read the paper I'm afraid.

Here goes ....  the compounds responsible for mousiness are 'bases' in
chemical terms (especially the tetrahydropyridines). At the pH of cider
say 3.5 they exist as the non-volatile malate salts. When they get in to
your mouth (higher pH) it takes a finite time for the free bases to be
dissociated and liberated from the salt so they can be detected
sensorially. That is why mousiness takes a few seconds to develop in the
mouth. Further, the pH of your mouth will differ depending on your
genetics and your diet, time of day etc. So different people will have
different sensitivities.


Here in the UK a couple of cider judges I know always take a small pot
of sodium bicarbonate with them to competitions. If they suspect a cider
to be mousy, they drop in a pinch of the bicarb, which raises the pH and
the mousiness can then actually be smelled in the headspace.


There is a good review on mouse from Australia here. Again you need to
pay to read it. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf0528613
