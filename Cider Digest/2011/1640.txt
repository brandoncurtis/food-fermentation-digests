Subject: Metabisulfite, Pumps

This is my first time responding to the digets and i had a question
about the use of metabisulfite as a cleanser. We have been making
cider on a very small scale 40 gal +/- for about 6 years now. I have
always used a metabisulfite as a rinse for the bottling eguiptment and
bottles,caps, hoses, etc. i believe that they are called cleanrinse.
If i understand right Dick is suggesting adding a acid. What type of
acid are you referring? Is the metabisulfite not adequate?


  I also wanted to add that the type of pump that we us is the boun
vino with the filters, it has worked great for the volume we do and we
will continue using it. I do have a question about the use of filters.
I try to do an in bottle MLF to get a slight sparkle when opened and
drank. It has worked great for the most part but i was wondering if
the filter is removing some of the yeasts that promote MLF?
  I have followed the digest for quite a while and am always looking
forward to a new digest coming out. Thanks for all the great info!


Cheers,
Tom Schoonover

For the cider digest:


Dick wrote: "Look at the tables and you'll see that for a pH above 3.8,
the advice is "lower the pH" - because above that pH you won't release
enough SO2 to have any anti-microbial effect."


Is too high of a pH (too close to 7) a possible reason why I have had
contamination even though I followed the manufacturer's guidelines for
sulfiting cider prior to pitching yeast? I have always been mystified by
film contamination after adding what the packaging said was the appropriate
amount of potassium meta-bisulfite. And if it is true (that acidity is
critical to get anti-microbrial action) why does the manufacturer not say
so? Why has no one ever written this down before? Thank You Dick for bringing
this to my attention (assuming I have interpreted the post correctly).


Also, what tables are referenced? Can I get access to them?


Thank  you,

Subject: European cider apple trees

Here in North Central Washington State we had an abnormal cold snap last
November. minus five Fahrenheit preceded but forty degree temperatures
daytime and thirty two nights. My cider trees bloomed adequately but
little if any fruit. Soft fruit trees suffered modest to severe damage
some orchards lost ninety percent of newly planted trees with damage
still showing up and expected to damage to show up on older trees next
year. What appears to have happened with the not completely dormant cider
tree not so dormant blossom buds the stigma was either damaged or killed
making spring pollinization impossible. Our desert apple blossoms were
not affected, it is noticed the European cider trees do not go into
dormancy as early as Delicious, Goldens and other desert apples with the
exception of Pink Lady and other late season apples as grown in our area.
I'm just passing on my observations to others who may have encountered
the same problem. At blossom time look to see if the stigma is healthy,
not dead or absent with no browning.

more re my note in the previous digest that *-metabisulfite in water, by
itself, won't have much-if-any antimicrobial action...


Andrew mentioned that the idea of a sulfite-plus-acid combination (using
the acid [eg citric] to drop the pH and allow the sulfite to work) appears
at least as far back as in Pollard and Beech _Cider-Making_, 1957.  Could
be much longer ago, just that this occurred to him.


We're setting up a little experiment to demonstrate the effect.


Those of you using some commercial equipment-sanitizing prep that's based
on a sulfite solution:  Could you check to see what other ingredients are
present?


Those of you who've been using a sulfite (only) solution for sanitizing:
Could you point us to references which suggest this should work?
