Digesters,


If you own a Nook Color e-reader,  the 2nd Edition of the Ben Watson Book:
Cider, Hard & Sweet - History, Traditions & Making Your Own is
available($14.97).  I assume it is available on the e-readers but I am not
sure.  Ben is a fantastic supporter of the American Hard Cider Industry,
please support him by buying the real book or e-reader version.

Hello all,


I am writing up a piece about consumer expectations and hard cider.
More specifically I want to highlight the discrepancy that exists
between the time of year that consumer demand for cider is high, and
the time of year when cider is ready for the drinking and selling. I'm
wondering if this is a phenomenon that exists in the UK, but I'm more
inclined to think that it happens in the US where the cider isn't as
popular. For instance, either in Cider Digest or Cider Workshop,
someone mentioned that it is difficult to participate in Fall
Festivals, or harvest festivals because their stock is normally out by
then. Obviously most consumers are likely to be more aware of cider
during apple harvest time, so it seems to me that there is a big
discrepancy between when people want to buy cider most, and when it is
most available. If you are a producer and you would like to throw your
two cents in, feel free to do it on the list, or please email me
personally. I'd really like to get the perspective of North American
producers first and foremost, but I appreciate any insight.


A few preliminary questions are:


Do you, as a producer, agree with the notion that there is a
discrepancy as previously stated? Do you receive more business in the
fall time?


What are some of the challenges associated with participating in fall
festivals? What are some of the challenges associated with meeting
high consumer demand in fall?


When is your cider normally ready to drink?


When is the ideal time for a cider festival?


Should the matter be corrected? If so, what is the best way to go
about doing this?


Many thanks,
Alexander Kroh
