I think the questions Alex asks  point to a critical issue for American
cidermakers.  I have attempted to share a few observations that I hope may
be helpful.  Perhaps I should note that I do not make our ciders.  My
brother Chuck does.  I am involved in the marketing and administration end
of the business..and I drink it.


  Cheers,

Hi, all -


Thanks for hosting the event, Mike! I do have a couple of questions, though.
What happened to the competition? And the tasting seminar? I haven't been
that much of participant, but I went twice and judged once. I don't care for
judging much, but the tasting seminars were fabulous. And of course, the
heart of rock and roll is competing...8^)


Best wishes,
Michael McClatchey

I missed the contest this year, what a chump! Sorry for the previous stupid
email.

In reply to Alex's questions about seasonality of the cider _consumer_
market:


We do half of our tasting room business in August - October, and it's
certainly harvest related.  Wholesale is more variable, but hints at a fall
surge, also.


I have to nitpick the assumption of your first question.  My cider is ready
by May. And it's a great, refreshing summer drink. But since it sells slowly
through the summer, it's just as _available_ in the fall.  I do think there
is a discrepancy between when I think the style pairs best with the weather,
and when there is consumer interest.


As far as challenges, there is a time challenge to participating in fall
festivals. I just don't have staff to send, and am at home watching the
harvest, pressing and start of ferment.  September wouldn't be _that_ bad,
but has a second issue.  We sized out tasting room for what made physical
sense in the building. That turns out to be undersized for peak demand.  But
peak is only 2-3 weekends a year, and I'm reluctant to build out to try to
capture the top of peak.


As for fixing it?  Diversifying outlets.  Consumer education. Living with
it.  I have a hypothesis that part of the seasonality is created by when
people are thinking about apples (rather than cider) and when they are out
driving around the countryside just cruising. (Or leafing, as it were.)
Hard to break away from those seasons.

A few preliminary questions are:


Do you, as a producer, agree with the notion that there is a discrepancy as
previously stated? Do you receive more business in the fall time?


What are some of the challenges associated with participating in fall
festivals? What are some of the challenges associated with meeting high
consumer demand in fall?


When is your cider normally ready to drink?


When is the ideal time for a cider festival?


Should the matter be corrected? If so, what is the best way to go about
doing this?


Many thanks,

Apologies for the ciderworkshop cross-post to those of you subscribed to
both.


First off, is there a good, in-print, USA version of the oft-noted Somerset
Pomona?


It looks like I will be signing a lease for a 50-tree orchard of moderately
neglected trees. I have seen my share of neglected trees and these babies
only seem about five years neglected. They were all planted from the late
1980's through about 1992. They all have a beautiful open vase/bowl shape,
all on dwarf rootstock (I can pick 50% of the apples from the ground). Many
of them are planted too close together so I'll have to go in with a chainsaw
in short order. Needless to say, I am "stoked" but my question for you all
is if anyone has personal experience with the following varieties. I can
google well enough, so I'm looking for your experience with the varieties
particularly in their suitability for cider (SG, pH, TA, flavor).


King
Prima
Wealthy
Tydeman's Late Orange
Enterprise
Freedom
Wolf River
Idared
Melrose
Hudson's Golden Gem
Shay
Dayton
William's Pride
Karmijn
Wynoochee Early
Chehalis
Freyberg
Winter Banana
Macoun
Redfree
Elstar


I apologize for the long list, this is about half the varieties. I know or
can find information about the other half. There are going to be some trees
to thin soon and I'm trying to determine suitability for cidermaking before
I fire up the chainsaw and before I spend time pruning, harvesting and
testing every variety.
