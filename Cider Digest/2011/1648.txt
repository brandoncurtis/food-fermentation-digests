Subject: Custom pressing of apples in North Carolina?
From: Christopher McGarvey <thornsbreak@gmail.com>

Dear cider lovers,


I'm a relatively recent cider enthusiast who was converted by a trip to the
Franklin County Cider Days in Massachusetts two years ago.  I've made 3
batches of cider now using fresh juice pressed by someone else according to
their fancy.  These have turned out pretty well, in particular the juice I
got last year from Chuck at Albemarle Cider Works in Virginia.


However, this year I'd really like to be able to create my own blend.  I
don't grow fruit, so I have to buy it.  Last fall I found a number of
orchards in North Carolina selling either proper bittersweet/sharp cider
varieties or classic heirlooms that would work very well.  I was just too
late in the season to get them.


But my real problem is that even though I can probably get the apples I
need, I have no way to grind/press them.  Before I dive in and build my own
equipment in the non-apple growing region of Wilmington, NC, I'd like to
search the state high and low for some place that might be willing to let me
press a custom blend.  Even better would be a place with varieties suitable
for cider where I could buy/pick and press on site.


Does anyone know of any locations in the state of North Carolina (or perhaps
even Virginia) where I and possible a small group from a homebrew club could
press some apples into juice?  Willing to pay a fee for this if necessary.


While we're at it, does anyone have recommendations on good sources of cider
apples in North Carolina/Virginia for the home enthusiast?  I'm not looking
to start a business, just make a few 5 gallon batches each year.


With all the apple growers around the mountains of NC, there has to be
somewhere a guy can press some juice in this state.


Thanks!

Puttering today and spent a little time on my
homemade cider press.


I made a YouTube video of it several years
ago that you've all seen
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0_Ez14bIwA),
and I just added the part number for the Good
Nature racks that I used.


I don't know how much the rack cost now, but
I was quoted 29.42 each back in 2008.  Good
Nature makes a robust rack cloth (pn. 11012)
that was quoted at 33.10 in 2008.


I'm making a second bottom tray using a HDPE
marine fitting.  MarineEast 1-1/8" L-head,
pn. 65540W  I like this drain since it mounts
flush for a more complete drain, and can be
mounted on the side or the bottom of the
tray.

I'm getting my kit dusted off and ready for
some action, and I wanted to share this info
with anyone making their own press.  I hope
to make some modifications to the press this
year to improve mobility and safety, and I'll
pass on that documentation when I can.
