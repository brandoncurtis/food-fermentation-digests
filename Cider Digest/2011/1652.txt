Just to extend that theme a bit, it has also allowed people who would
never know of each other's existence to get together and to discuss
cider internationally. In my own case I guess I would have got to meet
up with most UK cidermakers at some point in the normal way, but I would
never have met (both electronically and eventually in person) such a
wide range of North American and Antipodean cidermakers without the
Cider Digest. Some have become genuine friends with a shared interest.
It has also opened my eyes to many more different styles and practices
of cider than I would have encountered if I'd just been limited to a UK
West Country perspective which is where I began. So for that, and for
all the other things I've learnt here, I am grateful.


I think I've been a Digest member for around 14 years, so yes I'll try
to be good for another 20! And thanks Dick, who is rather more modest
about his own contribution than he should be!

Many thanks to you Dick and to everyone who contributes (from a 9 year
mostly lurker who looks forward to receiving the Digest as an
entertaining and informative diversion from my work-a-day world.)  My
hobby cidermaking has vastly improved as a direct result.  BTW I threw
your subscription numbers into an excel graph and I think I detect a
nacient exponential climb in cider intrest too!  ;-)=20


Best wishes to the Digest community and here's to another 20!!!=20

I'm going to NYC for a business trip in a couple weeks and am wondering if
there are any must-visit cider locations in the five boroughs. I don't want
to travel outside the city, but somewhere that I can reach via transit is
good.


Thanks,

to explain:  I got Tim's Stoke Reds (not the others) on G-30 because he
didn't have the winter chill required.


They are doing "OK", but not great.  I lost one of the four.  The other
3 are growing slowly and producing a little bit of fruit.  The problem
here is that as Tim says they break late:  This year mine were blooming
in mid-June.  This doesn't give them much time, since they ought to be
finishing up ripening by mid-September or maybe early October.
