RE: 20th Anniversary of Cider Digest


I also want to give thanks to Dick Dunn for managing the traffic here and
to Andrew Lea. Back in 1996 or so when we were researching cidermaking,
Andrew shared his cider making research with us at Rhyne Cyder. With
Andrew's ideas, the English book translation of Warcollier's work, and our
own empirical investigation of Sonoma County/Santa Cruz County apples &
growers in California, it helped give us an idea as to which direction to
head operationally in our small scale cidermaking venture.


I remember sending about 20 individual bottles to Cider Digest readers who
were willing to try early batches of our cider. One guy asked for case
for a U. of Chicago alumni gathering so I sent it to him. The feedback
was very useful.


Anyway, thank you to all for your comments, questions, and ideas.


Bill Rhyne

Dick,


Congrats on this milestone!


Appreciate the efforts on keeping all of us together on this forum.
It has been a good place for someone new to learn from.

Wow! Thank you Professor Lea. It's a very complex question I now
understand. I think I will try a small comparison trial this year if I
can swing it just to see what happens. Thanks again for your response.

Back to the recent thread about ciders developing H2S character and not
settling down...I had a recent batch like that, really very nice cider
except for the one serious off-note.


So, taking a tip from how one can test for H2S--by putting a bit of copper
in a sample and checking whether that clears it up--I flattened out a piece
of copper wire so that I could put it in a bottle of the offending cider.
About 20 minutes clears it away nicely.  Avoid the dregs of the bottle.


As to cause:  I had two batches go over-the-top sulfidic, both fermented
with Lalvin W15.
