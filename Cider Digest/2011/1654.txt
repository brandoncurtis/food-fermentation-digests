Subject: Fireblight
Re:
Here in the west one of the toughest problems with growing apple trees
is fireblight.  I read everything I can find about it learning that the
best technique is to spray the blossoms alternately with copper and then
a few days later with streptomycin.  Bordeaux mixture will suffice for
the copper but locating a source of streptomycin has been a problem for
me until recently.  Good old eBay came through with sources.  Now that I
have a supply of streptomycin I will be ready for next spring.

Many of the orchards throughout the Pacific Northwest are infected with
strains of fireblight that are resistant to streptomycin, because of
overuse. Most commercial orchards now use the much more expensive
"Agrimycin" because streptomycin is ineffective.  So don't overdo it. Never
use it routinely.
In fact, you probably have the resistant strain.  if you get a strike,
collect some of the bacterial ooze and send it to a state lab.  Check with
your Extension office.  The lab can tell you whether you need to use
Agrimycin or not.  If you have a resistant strain, streptomycin is no use.
The effectiveness of both antibiotics and other fireblight weapons such as
BlightBan, Serenade, etc., depends entirely on timing.  If you live in
Washington, you can subscribe to the excellent computer model, "Decision Aid
System," developed at the Tree Fruit Research Station in Wenatchee.  Your
state might have an adapted or similar model.  With the model, you plug in
your weather conditions (or it's fed automatically by local weather
stations).  It will tell you how high the fireblight risk is and whether and
what to spray.
Peaceful Valley and Wilbur Ellis are good sources for supplies.

Mr. Dunn:


As I happen to be using W15 this year (first batch clean so far, 1/3
sugar depletion) I would be interested in what if any yeast nutrient
regime and fermentation temperature you may have used in the two batches
that went "over-the-top stinky" as mentioned in Cider Digest #1653
"fixing sulfide taint".

Hi to All and Happy apple harvest season!


    Just a thought to share with all Cider Digesters.  Our friends Steve
Wood (Farnum Hill) and Mike Beck (Uncle John's) have organized a trip
for esteemed English cider fans/writers/photographers Bill Bradshaw and
Pete Brown next week to collect information for a proposed book on the
frontiers of cider making, or to drink themselves silly, or something
in between. We're happy to be included with other Eastern and Midwestern
cider makers as a whistle stop on the tour, and I'm anticipating a lively
discussion about the deep, rich and hoary tradition of cider in the UK
(not to mention a huge established industry) versus all of us Colonial
upstarts with sometimes heretical ideas about proper apples, techniques,
presentation, etc..


    Should be great fun.  But it's also a fine opportunity to explore the
subject of what the US cider industry might aspire to. For this and anything
else that seems appropriate, I ask all of you to suggest questions or
comments to pose to our English friends.  They'll be here on or around
Sept.5, so, please contact me directly if there isn't enough time to post
up another issue of CD.


    In any case, I highly recommend a visit to Bill Bradshaw's website
iamcider.blogspot.com


Cheers!
