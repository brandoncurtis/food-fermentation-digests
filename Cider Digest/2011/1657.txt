I regret that my posting is tardy, but life
has a way of getting in the way!


Dick and Mike have both provided outstanding
summaries of the events, so I'll start by
offering a few photographs so that all of you
can see some of the fun for yourself:

As a follow-on, I am amazed at the depth and breadth of fine ciders coming
out of Michigan!  I'm a former Yooper that never really paid any attention
to life below the bridge until my sister moved to Grand Rapids last year.
Now I'm finding so much more to explore and taste!


I had an epiphany of sorts while visiting Mike and everyone else at
the festival: Cider (hard and sweet) is very much about family.  So many
cider makers are carrying on a second or third generation family business.
And the new cider makers (young and not as young) are building the craft
with the same passion and innovation as the rest of the cider makers.


I came to cider while I was in the Coast Guard, and the family spirit of
the community has filled a tremendous gap left in my life since I retired.
I look forward to all of these festivals as family reunions where we can
all share our successes, stories, and passion.  (And watch all the little
kids run around :)


So, thank you Mike for hosting a fantastic cider-family reunion!  I know
that my sister and cousin had a great time, and the Great Lakes Cider
Festival will be on my calendar for a very long time.


Cheers!

It's been so long I don't recall the fate of that one. I checked with
my wife and she's a participant in the Mead Lover's Digest but
doesn't recall when she joined that. So if you took that over from
someone else other than me then you're probably correct in that the
one I started must have gotten canned in favor of that one.

[Janitor's note:  The following paragraph was supposed to have been in
Mike Beck's note in the preceding Digest.  The fault is mine.   -rcd]


The Cider Maker's dinner at Tandem Cider in Sutton's Bay was over the top
good.  Dan Young & Nikki Rothwell are as talented as chef's as they are
cider makers.

BARLEY LEGAL 2: BETTER IN THE DARK


BJCP-SANCTIONED HOMEBREW COMPETITION


The Wootown Brewers of Phoenix, MD, are proud to announce Barley Legal 2:
Better in the Dark. Barley Legal is a BJCP-sanctioned homebrew competition
open to all beer, mead, cider and perry styles and homebrewers worldwide.


We are currently seeking entries, judges, stewards, and volunteers.


Entries are accepted at several drop-off locations listed on our web site or
may be sent to the address listed on our web site. In order to increase the
value to those who enter, each beer will be eligible to win twice in two
separate sets of judging:


- -          A BJCP-style judging session, based upon aroma, appearance,
flavor, mouthfeel, and overall impression


- -          A second, thematic, hedonistic judging session for entries that
are 17 SRM or darker


So if your Black IPA, Wheatwine, or Gruit doesn't take home a BJCP prize,
you could still win in the second session, or even both. The entry fee is $6
for the first entry, and $5 for each additional. Entries are accepted
between September 24 and October 8, 2011.


This year, judging for Barley Legal will be held on Saturday, October 15,
2011 at 9:00 a.m. in Abingdon, MD at the DuClaw Brewing Company brewery.


If you are new to judging, stewarding, or volunteering, this is a great
opportunity for you to learn more about the process and earn points. If you
are a seasoned pro, Barley Legal promises to provide a great time. There
will Harvest and Halloween food provided, an after judging event at the
DuClaw restaurant in Abingdon, and prizes available for those who attend the
judging session.


If you are a brewer, and would like to enter your beer, mead, or cider or
perry, please visit our web site at http://www.wootown.org/comp  for more
details.


We'd definitely appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you.


TO VOLUNTEER TO JUDGE, STEWARD, OR PARTICIPATE, PLEASE VISIT OUR WEB SITE AT

Thanks,

Subject: saison ale yeast and cider

I had an interesting ale the other night. Clipper City's Red Sky Saison.
Very forward fruit notes which the brewer (whom I contacted) attributed
to the yeast he was using. A belgian saison ale yeast. I was intrigued
by the idea of bringing it to my ciders. A dry cider with similar fruit
notes could be very intriguing. I've ordered some of the yeast and  am
planning to do a couple test batches this fall. I have a couple
concerns. The yeast needs warmth to ferment actively (70-85 degrees F)
and is also, probably consequently, a quick fermenter. I tend toward
cool, slow fermentations but still think it worth a shot.
Anyone tried this yeast? Any thoughts or advice? I'll keep you posted?
