If you are following my videos on converting
an arbor press to be a cider press, then you
might enjoy this follow-on video:

I didn't like the tray that I got from a
press manufacturer, so this is my solution.

I am about to make a 50-tree order of cider varieties (on MM-111 with
G-11 or G-30 interstems) and would like to solicit advice in regards to
NOT planting any of the common/classic cider varieties (primarily, but
not exclusively English) due to poor performance histories in a hot
climate, in my case interior Northern California where the daytime high
temps run 92 to 102 degrees, generally for most all of August and a lot
of September. The humidity stays quite low for most of the June-October
period, the bloom and post-bloom weather is much more mild/normal than
the summer extremes.


Any shared experience/advice/comments on the subject greatly appreciated.

I've posted a video on the clean in place
solution that I'm using that I'm rather
pleased with.  The total cost was under $50,
and you only need one since it can be moved
from tank to tank.

I'll be doing another video soon on
taps/spigots and how to avoid ones that are
doomed to leak.


Cheers!

We grind into a short term (< hour) storage tank and use a flexible impeller
pump to move the pomace to the rack and cloth press.


This works fine with dessert apples, but the traditional cider varieties
and perry pears don't release as much free run juice. At least for us. And
thus, they don't flow out of the holding tank and into the pump. We end
up bucketing them over.


Does anyone else use this kind of setup?  Seen a similar problem?  Found a
solution?  I'm thinking of saving my pennies for an elliptical lobe pump
with an auger in-feed. That's a lot of pennies.
