One might guess that stronger cell structure in firmer fruit might
be responsible for less free juice.  Perhaps manipulation of grinding
parameters would produce a more free-flowing pomace, as by increasing
grinder rotational speed or lengrthening dwell time in the grinder.

Dick, why not take some pictures of your mystery apples, complete with a
cross-section and send them to someone like Liz Copas in the UK for
identification. I have found Liz more than willing to help with
identification in the past.  I have some Foxwelps, big pulpy apples, but do
not use them since they drop early and do not keep, they are sharp but do
not seem to have any spicy notes for which Foxwelps are noted. I do not have
any Tremlett's and do not grow any because I thought they were also an early
cropper and wanted to delay pressing until the dark wet of November.

Dick, how is your Tremlett different from the true Tremlett? I am asking
because I have some Tremlett that I got from the Canadian Clonal Genebank
a while ago, and it corresponds quite well to descriptions I have seen of
the true Tremlett (e.g. Copas). So I have no reason to think I could have
a false Tremlett.


For the Fauxwhelp, it is clear that what I have is not a Foxwhelp. Further,
as far as I know, there has been no Foxwhelp clearly identified in N.America
(correct me if I am wrong), so everyone that thinks he has a Foxwhelp in
Canada and USA has something else. But are we sure all the Fauxwhelp are
the same variety? For example, you seem to appreciate your Fauxwhelp,
but I don't find mine useful at all for cider as it gives a very acidic
juice and very low in sugar. Just the opposite of what I look for in an
apple for cider: high sugar with low to medium acid. For my part, I think
Fauxwhelp is a good name for it.

Subject: Encapsulated yeast - split an order?

Hi All,


I'm interested in experimenting with the Proelif encapsulated yeast beads
for a secondary fermentation, but it's only available in 1kg sizes.  I was
wondering if a couple of folks might be interested in splitting an order, as
it's about $200 and way more than I need.


Thanks and regards,


John

I've posted two videos on plastic taps and
spigots.  The video could be better, but it's
the best that I can do for now.  I regret
that it's in two parts, but I haven't gotten
the hang of editing two videos into one.


Here they are:


Part 1:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zaowzd9mpH8


Part 2:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbnBdfE0_zc


The gist of it is that some hobby taps have
irregular threads that don't set properly in
a standard fitting.  Also, some valve seats
are prone to failure by design, and they
require (demand) tender handling.


I've found that taps and spigots from U.S.
Plastic Corp. have been less expensive and
more reliable than from wine/beer suppliers.
http://www.usplastic.com  (I have no
financial interest in this vendor.)


There you have it.  Feel free to critique the
videos, and share your experiences!
