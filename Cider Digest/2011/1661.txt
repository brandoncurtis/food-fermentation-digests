Most of what I know about the Foxwhelp here in the Northwest is antidotal,
but I think a lot of us are seeing the same apple coming from a common
ancestor.  I will try to get some pictures of the fruit I have.  My
recollection on the apple we got from the Mt. Vernon Research Station that
it was part of a cider apple collection from Perkins Orchard in Sedro Wooly
which in turn may have come from an collection made by a collector at the
University of Washington. So the previous source perhaps, Cornell is unclear
and in each case I doubt if any serious work was done to establish
true-to-type. I know this was the case at Mt. Vernon.


Any Digesters in the Cornell area? I will query Dr. North about the Mt.
Vernon collection and try to verify take my antidotal tale.

In 2008 and 2010 I produced cider which had a white, semi-solid in the
bottom of the carboys by the time fermentation ended. In 2008, the solid was
about 3 inches thick and in 2010, it occupied almost half of the 5 gallon
vessel.  Unfortunately I did not photograph this phenomenon. There was no
obvious off-flavor in the resulting cider. Looking at common cider problems
in Watson's book did not readily diagnose the problem since we are careful
about sanitation and do sulfite the juice. I wondered if this could be a
super extreme case of pectin haze, since those years were cool summers here
and the apples may have had unusually high pectin levels but solids are not
described with regard to pectin problems. I would appreciate any help in
diagnosing and addressing this problem.


Thank you,

As a newbie to the game I appreciate the information I have gotten out of
the digest, so THANK YOU to all who contribute.


Does anybody (or has anybody tried to) make cider without the science lab
approach? My late great-grandfather made hard cider, and from what i
remember it was delicious. I do not recall him using anything other than
cider, yeast, and raisins. No magic tabs or additives of any sort. So i
guess my question is: Should I go "old school" with modern yeasts and keep
the additives out of the equation, or am I guaranteed to get a rotten batch
of wasted time and juice?


I do understand that the "science lab" approach is a much more controllable,
predictable, and repeatable method, but I like my old school New England
roots that seem to have died with the previous generation. I want to make
cider like my grandfathers did, but they are not here to help me so I ask
all the knowledgeable people of the digest.

What I have (3 trees of it) is most notably different from true Tremlett in
that it's a bittersharp, not a bittersweet.  The shape of the fruit is
round, not at all conical.  Trees have a very upright habit.
