There was something in Cider Digest 1662 which triggered a spam filter,
resulting in about a dozen rejects (that I know of, quite possibly more
rejected but not bounced).  If you missed this issue, see if you can
find out why it got rejected.  Then deal with your ISP appropriately,
and/or whitelist the Digest.  The sender address to whitelist is
cider-request@talisman.com


I've gone over that issue of the Digest a couple of times and can't
figure out what triggered the false rejections...and sad to say,
incompetently-written spam filters never provide any useful info
for a sender to diagnose the problem.


If you just want to pick up the issue you missed, see

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hello,
My first attempt at cider several years ago wasn't so successful, so I
decided I need to learn what works for a good cider.  I made 11 experimental
1 gallon batches this year and measured pH, OG, and titratable aciditiy
before fermentation.


My method for TA is 10 mL must into ~200 mL DI water in an erlenmeyer flask
with 5 drops phenolphthalein, and titrating through a buret with 0.1 M NaOH
to the phenolphthalein endpoint.


I did triplicate measurements on each must sample, and had very low error on
the more clear must.  Some of the apple musts oxidized to a deep brown
color, that even when diluted 1:20 really masked the phenolphthalein
endpoint.


Do any experienced cidermakers have advice for getting more accurate TA on
deeply oxidized must?


Thanks,
John Yeo

We are working with a local distiller to have our first 'commercial' crop
of apples made into apple brandy.  The looming question is what type of
barrel to age it in?
I see from Ben Watson's book that the French use used brandy barrels.
Annie Proulx recommends once-used bourbon or brandy barrels.  A book on
Calvados discusses possibly starting in new oak, which Proulx admonishes
not to do, but then aging in used oak barrels, be they whiskey, port,
brandy, or other. I think we could more readily find the used bourbon
barrel than the brandy.
Your suggestions and ideas will be appreciated.

Anyone who has followed the story of Julian's travails to establish his
distillery...and then, to establish his right to call his product what it
IS...should be happy to see the outcome he announced in the last Digest.


Julian Temperley is one of the most steadfast advocates for real cider,
as well as for cider brandy, that you'll find anywhere.  Although he
doesn't write much (compare Andrew Lea, our resident scientist and ever-
present advisor) Julian is out there in the heart of Somerset, making
fantastic traditional cider and showing up as a spokesman when real cider
needs an ally.


I like to tell the story that on my first visit to England (in 1994), the
first cidermaker we visited--quite by chance--was Burrow Hill (Julian
Temperley).  That put me on the right path...it was a bit like having a
first-growth Bordeaux for your first taste of red wine!  The first taste
of a West Country cider was quite a challenge, but the idea came across
straightaway.  I came back with the enthusiasm that made me willing to
pick up the Cider Digest...among many other things.

One good thing about home brewing or meading or cidering is you can do
it any way you want: old school, new school,  out of school.
