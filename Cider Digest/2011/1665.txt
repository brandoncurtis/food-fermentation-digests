I have been under the impression that malformed apples were the result of
self-fertilization. I often find some throughout the orchard, in hard to
find spaces which I think may have gotten insufficient cross pollination. On
the gravensteins, which are triploids this can be a problem some years if
they bloom before there is much bee activity. My put, perhaps we have a real
pomologist on board who can shed some light on the issue.

Dick, I have also seen that (or something very similar) in my Cortland
trees. As you mention, this appears on a tree that has an abundant crop,
and, for me at least, these malformed apples represent only a very small
percentage of the tree crop, so small that I have never worried about
them... However I have noted these malformed apples are most often as a
bunch together. Sorry I can't help more, but at least you know you are not
alone!!!

If you're from NW PA or the Southern Tier of NY and going to Cider Day
this year, would you consider handling some juice for me?


I'm going to Canada on my way home, and something tells me that trying
to take sealed corny kegs over the border in either direction would be
a non-starter.  I'm looking to hand the kegs off to someone that would
take them relatively close to where I live so that I could pick them up
after I get back from Canada.


I live just south of Jamestown, NY.  I'll cross back into the U.S. in
Buffalo, NY.


Anybody?

It?s Cider Week here in NYC !  For the most part, lacking in diversity, with
appearances from the usual (hi-quality) ciders that are always available
here in NYC these days (Farnum Hill, Eve?s, Redfield).  But dropping by
Astor Wines on Lafayette in Manhattan, I grabbed a couple Spanish Basque
ciders (?sagardo? in the local Euskera language), a style I fell in love
with after my first ?txotx? at Resola Cidery (
http://rezolasagardotegia.infotres.com/eu/index.php ) 5 years ago.  The
cider-maker told me that, by law, they are not allowed to add anything to
the cider:  no yeast, no nutrients, no sulfites...  How could ignoring sound
practice produce consistently good ciders ?


Anybody have any insight on the Basque ?Sidra? process ?  The cider is so
distinctive and unlike anything made elsewhere, but why ?  The varietal ?
 The process ?  It is dry, very acidic, minimally tannic, with an
unapologetic layer of sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  Strangely, it
is only the slightest bit p�tillant, evident only for a few moments after
opening the bottle.  Most have a turbidity that doesn?t settle out (pectin
?).  Is the sediment at the bottom of the bottle, yeast ?  If so, is it
yeast from an in-bottle fermentation or just sediment that is allowed to
pass through to bottling ?  I would generally expect more carbonation from
that much sediment.  It is so acidic, I can?t imagine any ML fermentation
took place.  (Does ML fermentation produce sediment like yeast ?).  I?m
fairly certain that they are fermented in huge oak barrels like I saw at
Rezola (some pics available on their website linked to above)--  I?ve never
had a non-basque cider that spent any time in oak- could this be the elusive
factor that makes this style so distinctive ?  What are the characteristics
of cider that has fermented/aged in oak ? Where can I get some ?!?


See you guys on Nov. 5th and 6th !

This is a timely issue for me, I have just finished this area of reading
( Soil Testing & Plant Analysis ) Walsh & Beaton Revised 1973.


I Quote:


" Deficiencies of Boron occur in a wider range of crops, soils, and
climatic conditions than do deficiencies of any other micronutrient element.
Crop responses to the application of B fertilizers have been reported from
41 states in the USA and from many countries. Toxic levels of B are also
frequently encountered."


" Soil supplies of available Boron are of interest at both inadequate and
excess levels. Boron deficiencies are most frequently observed on light
colored soils in humid regions, especially on coarse textured soils. In
regions of low rainfall, the soluble B content of soils may be high because
of its accumulation with other salts in the profile. Irrigation water may
also contain relatively high amounts of B."


"Crops vary widely in their requirements for B, their tolerance to high or
excessive levels of the element, and their ability to absorb the element
from the soil. The ratio of toxic to adequate levels of B is smaller than
that of any other nutrient element. Thus, excessive and deficient levels
could be encountered in a crop during a single season."


I also found this link from the Washington State University that shows
exactly what your apples look like! See page II
