In response, boron toxicity could be at fault. Here in the apple
producing region of Washington State, we do experience Boron deficiency
but have no experience with Boron toxicity in our orchards but it is
warned that too much boron fertilizer is a problem, too much boron in the
soil, I would rule that out. Occasionally my cherry trees have misshapen
leaves and fruit that is a physiological disorder, but not to worry, it
is nonsreading, we just remove the affected limb or an entire affected
tree. I suggest virus as the probable cause, I have experience with that.
This is potentially a very serious disease, as viruses will spread from
pollinization, insects or root grafting from adjacent trees. We have
State and Federal research facilities here in Wenatchee with virologists
who can identify tree fruit viruses. Your local extension service could
contact them or possibly google to make contact.

For what it counts, it was pouring rain during the full bloom on our
MacIntosh block this spring (therefore no bees out) and we had crazy
malformed apples like we've never had before. I'm no pomologist, but
would agree with Rich Anderson's diagnoses of self-fertilization being a
contributing cause.

I imagine that with trees, as with people,  the same symptoms can result
from very different causes.


We have a Bosc Pear Orchard which produces fruit deformities similar to
those you describe. According to my partner, who grows all of our fruit and
is very current in his knowlege, the cause is a virus associated with a
particular root-stock.


What about posing the question to the apple/tree fruit expert at your local
ag. extension department? One would think they can at least eliminate some
of the possibilities. And perhaps they can tell you about any infected
root-stocks and other disease vectors/sources that are in your area.

Scott,
I suggest contacting Paul Vossen at the Sonoma County Cooperative Extension
regarding your cultivar questions.  Paul often does not return messages, so
I suggest being persistent.  Being a commercial grower, you are entitled to
services of the cooperative extension beyond the master gardener services.


I used to live near Occidental, and can assure Arkansas Black grows well
organically in your region.


Best Wishes,
John Yeo

For amateur cider makers it is often difficult to obtain pectin methyl
esterase (PME), one of the key adjuncts proposed for keeving (producing a
naturally sweet, carbonated, fermented cider through a strategy that could
be described as strategic yeast starvation).  Amateur cider producers in
Europe are able to purchase PME from a private French company as part of
a kit called KlerCidre, but that company will not sell their product in
the US (I have tried). However, I have found someone who purchased PME in
bulk and is willing to provide small amounts to amateur cider makers in the
US for a small fee (I paid 2 dollars for enough PME to keeve 14 gallons)
and an almost negligible shipping cost.  He also has calcium chloride
available, another key adjunct for keeving, but this adjunct is generally
available through homebrew outlets.  It is good to know that we in the US
have options like this available because it has been very difficult, at
least for me, to obtain PME in the US in small enough quantities to make
experimentation with keeving cost effective for small-scale production.
You can email requests directly to the provider (Chris Rylands) at
crylands@comcast.net<mailto:crylands@comcast.net>.  I apologize for
the commercial nature of the post, but sourcing raw materials can be a
difficult challenge, and I thought this information may be helpful to
others who have embarked on a similar quest for the holy grail of cider.


Thank  you,
