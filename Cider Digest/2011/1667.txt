We had 11 days of rain right during mid season pollination. This resulted
in very poor fruit set this year with our crop being about 1/3 of what
it was last year in those cultivars.  Along with the lack of fruit we had
a huge number of malformed fruit, which I know can sometimes be caused by
pollination issues. Our Cortlands in particular seemed to have a problem with
this. This isn't science, just an observation from our orchard this season.
They were still fine for making juice at least.

An apple has 5 lobes. All 5 need to be pollenated in order to produce a
'standard shaped' apple.
Incomplete=2C anisometric pollenation is a common cause of fruit deformation.
Examine your 'seed star'. Is it typical?
