Total Acid and Sugar in your favorite cider must:


Wondering what a "good" concentration of sugar and acid is or has been
in your experience.


Can you relate what you look for in a must - here's some relevant
metrics:


- - brix
- - original gravity
- - pH
- - total acid


Curious about measurements taken on what turned out to be excellent
vintages or blends.
Also curious about yeast.


thanks all!

All,
I am in search of a fermenter to carbonate cider. Do any of you know of any
used tanks, or of a reputable place to purchase one. I am looking to start
small so anything 1000-1900 liters(250-500 Gallons)
Thanks,
Sean

This may not reach the list prior to the event, but I've created a
custom Google Map with the location of all the venues for this year's
CiderDays festival:


http://g.co/maps/8ar7t


Since I already know which workshops I'm planning to attend, I wanted
to print driving directions in advance for my route. My solution is
not particularly elegant, but if you copy the latitude and longitude
data (in bold beneath each venue's information) and paste it into the
driving directions, you can create a custom itinerary that takes in
multiple venues (click the Add Destination link as needed and
click-and-drag the green circles to rearrange the order). Here's my
itinerary for Saturday:

It's my first time attending and I'm very excited! Please email me
directly with any feedback on the map...I hope it does more good than
harm!

For those of you that couldn't make it, I've
posted my photos from the first day of the
Cider Days festival in Massachusetts for you
to enjoy and tag.

I am willing to put a Creative Commons

give me credit for the photo if you use them
in a commercial publication or on a web site.

P.S.  I'll be adding notes to the photos when
I get home.  I'm having too much fun to do
paperwork right now!
