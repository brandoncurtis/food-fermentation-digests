You might look at used brewery equipment sources. You are going to need a
tank capable of holding 9-15 psi depending on the temperature you plan to
carbonate at. We purchased a 3.5 barrel Grundy tank a number of years ago,
modified the lid for cleaning and a pressure gauge and have used it
successfully for a number of years in a cold room. Alternatively, cooling
can be accomplished by adding a glycol jacket or coils. Whatever method you
come up with it is going to be a sizable investment for which there are no
shortcuts.

I headed up to Pine Hill Orchard for brunch
and to check out the treasure trove of
blended juice for cider makers, and then on
to Apex Orchards for some of their smooth
cider vinegar.


Back at Old Deerfield I soaked up the
sessions on ice cider, Southern and Northern
apple tasting, and my favorite: cheese and
cider pairing!


What a terrific weekend!  (So grateful that
the weather broke to let the festival go on.)

There seemed to be a fair amount of interest
in the CHOA (cherry, hickory, oak, & ash)
barrels used by County Cider to age their ice
cider.


The barrels are made by The Carriage House
Cooperage in Wellington, ONT Canada.

Here's my usual Facebook link of photos:

I'd be interested in hearing if anyone knows
of any other coopers serving upstate NY or
the northeast!


Anyway, they are a small operation, and I've
posted some photos for folks to look at.
(Pete had gone into Toronto on business, so I
don't have photos of the barrels under
construction.)
