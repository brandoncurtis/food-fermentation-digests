I just received, haven't yet used, a small, 37 gallon brite tank that is
designed to fit inside a large upright freezer.  I'm pretty sure this is
a new product. Here is a link

No need for glycol or a cold room.  Now I just need to find a nice used
freezer that is big enough!

I recently fermented a blend pears and apples in a single 3 gallon
batch. The overall composition was about 50% unknown variety of perry
pear, 25% asian pear, and 25% dessert apple. The ph of the juice was
approximately 3.4 and the starting gravity was 1.055. Sulfited, waited
a day and pitched champagne yeast with 4tsp of yeast nutrient. No pectic
enzyme was added. Fermentation started quickly and completed in about 8
days with a final gravity of about 1.010. temps in the upper 50's /lower
60's. Raked into clean jars and kept in fridge since then.


Flavor when I racked it was slightly sweet and somewhat yeasty but mouth
puckering sour. Color is opaque golden and not clearing much over the last
few weeks.


I am thinking about what options I have with it.


1- rack back into a carboy, add some additional sugar and nutrient and
re-ferment with an acid reducing yeast like MA33. Since it contains more
pears (citric acid) than apples I'm not sure if this will be effective.


2- Do a controlled maloactic fermenttion after a few months of aging. Seems
like a standard process with perry but not cider. Since I have apples in
the mix will this be an issue?


3- Be patient and let it age for a few months. Its been about a month and
I am planning on tasting it again to see if it has started to mellow.


I initially thought about blending some of my small perry pear batches
with larger bases but have read that can cause some really troublesome
clouding and haze issues. Any recommendations on blending or should I
steer clear completely?
Thanks

Hello -


I have my cider working away right now - but I do not want a dry finish,
nor did I intend to bottle.  Has anyone ever tried to pasteurize 5 gallon
kegs?  I have access to old liquid nitrogen containers that I can convert
to water baths, but does the volume of cider make this method impractical?


Thanks.
