When you say "mouth puckering sour", is this bitterness, astringency or
acidity? I have heard mouth puckering for too much astringency (but English
is not my language, so I might misinterpret)... True perry pears may be
extremely astringent, or could also be very acidic. Depending on the
problem, solutions will differ. Do you have a measure of total acidity -
this would be helpful.

Always be patient... My own perry, from fall 2010 pressing, is still not
cleared after over a year! I am just starting to get impatient on it, and I
have tried recently a fining treatment, without success yet. So I have
decided to let it do its thing. Perries are well known to be difficult to
clear.

Jim,


Blending common and perry pears has created hazes and strange caps for me.  =
 Pear can be hard to clear in any case.=20


Secondly, you want to avoid MLF in perry. There's little malic acid in pears=
. What acid there is is mostly citric, which MLF enzymes convert to acetic.=20=

Subject: Anybody (US) making/selling under 27 CFR 24.76?
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>

Is anybody on the list in the US making and selling cider under the
provision for "farmgate" style sales which are not (federally) taxed?


This is the provision given in the particular section of federal regs I
noted in the Subject, namely 27 CFR 24.76, which allows cider to be sold
without the licensing or taxation provisions of the rest of 27 CFR 24,
as long as it's not sold by a winery, not represented as wine, etc.


If you're doing this:  Have you found out for sure whether sulfiting the
juice is considered a "preservative method or material" (which is
prohibited if that section is to apply)?


My gut reaction to the provisions of that section of law is that it would
be a red flag to the feds--as would anything that allows not paying tax
that would otherwise apply.

Subject: Sulfited cider sealed in corny kegs for a week.
From: John Simmons <32bituser@gmail.com>

I picked up 4 corny kegs of fresh juice from Cider Day weekend in Franklin
County, Ma.
(for those in the know, I got two from the 600 gallon tank, and two from
the 800 gallon tank)


Anyway, at purchase time, I added Potassium Metabisulphite (spelling ?)..
to the kegs, put the lids on, and put some CO2 pressure in the kegs, so as
to keep them safe and non leaking for the rest of the day, till I got them
home.


Short story - I got somewhat overtaken by events, and, after bringing the
kegs inside that night, never got back to them.  Now it is over a week
later, and, I would like to get the cider into carboys for inoculation.


Here is what I THINK I should do -
1 - Rack to sanitized carboys
2 - Wait 24 hours
3 - Go ahead and inoculate


Does this make sense ?  Is there anything else I should know?  Did I mess
up?


Thanks!
