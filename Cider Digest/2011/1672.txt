Dick, I asked the TTB about that myself just this year. I asked:


I am trying to understand the application of this regulation. I am opening
a bonded winery (cider-only) and can't figure out if this regulation
exempts me from all TTB taxes, or just exempts me from the wine-specific
tax ($1.07/gal) and I still have to pay the cider-specific tax
($0.226/gal). Can you provide clarification?


The reply was:


 You are not exempt from paying taxes on the cider that you are producing
as you are producing it at a winery and treating it as a ?wine?.  The tax
rate that you will use is $.226 unless you produce under 250,000 wine
gallons per year then you are eligible for a small producer credit on the
first 100,000 wine gallons that you remove.  The effective tax rate will be
$.056 with the small producer credit being taken into consideration.****

I did not follow-up with her with a question of why I'm automatically
"treating it as a wine". I believe it has to do with the magic 7% number
which I did not mention in my previous query. I will do so now actually.

Subject: BATF on cider (27 CFR 24.76)

Some years
ago (Dec. of 1997) I asked the BATF about 27 CFR 24.76. I got a nice letter
back from Bernard J. Kipp, Special Inspector of the Portland Oregon Office.


He stated
in part:
'A
legislative history of this matter indicates that the manufacture and sale of
tax-free hard cider was confined to a traditional normal alcoholic fermentation
of the juice of sound ripe apples during the fall of the year by farmers and
sold at road side stands. This was a product made by people who were not in the
wine business and therefore it could be made outside of a bonded winery and not
subject to federal tax.


A few main
prohibitions to remember when making cider under this exemption are: cider must
be made from fresh juice, not concentrate; No preservative methods
(concentration) or materials (sulphur dioxide) can be used; and the product
must be noneffervescent (no carbon dioxide added.)'


The letter
went on to state I should contact the state liquor folks (the Oregon Liquor
Control Commission) for their stance on this subject. I got a letter back from
the state commission, in which they blew a gasket thinking that anyone would
dare think to produce alcohol without their blessing...
