Thanks to Chris Horn, who had already explored this issue and had gotten
the answer on sulfites--which is that it's considered a preservative.


The only reason I had really wondered about sulfites wrt this reg is that
sulfiting can be considered to do two rather different things pre- and
post-fermentation.  Post-fermentation it would be hard to argue that it's
NOT a preservative, but I thought there was a chance it would be allowed
pre-fermentation.

Nat, you pretty much told them that 24.76 wouldn't apply to you!
24.76 isn't that long, and it says explicitly that it applies to
cider "when produced at a place other than a bonded wine premises".
So you gave them a reason straight from the reg to deny you.

I neglected to answer a particularly relevant question on the thread about
the malformed fruit I saw this year--R A Murphy Jr commented:

Yes, the malformed apples had 5 seeds as far as I looked.
But I noticed that they didn't mature and ripen as they should have; the
seeds stayed small and pale.  This remained true even for apples left on
the tree way past when everything should have been picked.
