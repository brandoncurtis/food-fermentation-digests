We all looked at the old farmer cider rules at one time but I think you
would find the distribution and sales very limited. Plus as stated earlier
your State CB is going to have the final say.  


Just do it, permitting takes a bit of time and some back and forth but for
the most part the people you deal with will work with you. If you keep your
ABV under 7% will pay only about $.17 a gallon and if you choose, can label
following FDA guidelines rather than going through the COLA process. 


You might want to consider getting a permit for Wine rather than Cider. We
ran into a problem when we wanted to produce a Pommeau style product and
were told that we did needed a Wine Permit.

Hi Folks
Doing a bit of research on the German cider industry and wondered if  
anyone had good english speaking contacts there, or details of a  
producers association.


thanks
