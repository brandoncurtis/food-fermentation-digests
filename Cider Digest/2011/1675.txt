I'm just getting into crafting cider.  I really enjoy ice ciders.  Has
anyone made any ice ciders at home and can give some tips, techniques,
etc?  Thank you

I was wondering what folks are using for cultured yeast. I have been
experimenting over the years and have used, variously several products from
Lalvin, Wyeast, and Red Star. For the most part, I have settled on Lalvin
D-47 as the all around best yeast for cider. (Although I must say that
recently I have been experimenting more with natural yeast fermentation with
some excellent results.)
