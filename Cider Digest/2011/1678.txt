We are starting to clean our carboys and move our cider with air pressure.
We will use CO2 to move the cider so as not to promote oxidation.   Ambient
air from a compressor with an oil filter should suffice for moving water
thru the carboys for cleaning.  Our saftey question is how much psi is
required to make a carboy fail?  We would like to avoid that.
Thanks for a great newsletter.

I tried some cider once upon a time, that contained Hops.  It was most
excellent. Is there anybody out there that has had experience making
Cider with Hops?

Does anyone have any quantity of the following apple varieties that
they'd be willing to share or trade?
I'm not looking for huge amounts, but I'd love to have at least a couple
of 4 inch pieces.  I'll happily pay postal costs and I could even send a
SASE to make things easy.
