Thanks Robert Kuntz for all the great yeast management info in CD #1677
!
What an enlightening glimpse into the science behind fermentation with a
purpose...  Also good to hear Tim Bray echo the sentiment that slower
and cooler fermentation is beneficial for ester production.  Next year,
I suspect I will the gravitate toward DV10 (the steadiest and slowest of
the ferments I did this year) at a slightly cooler temp (<65F).


Robert (and others), is there a book(s) or reference(s) you
can recommend to better wrap my head around wine/cider chemistry and
biology ?  I just grabbed Andrew Lea's book-- a fantastic (but basic)
intro to cider making.  Andrew probably knows more about cider
chemistry than anyone, but in this book he doesn't get into it.  I'm
hungry for something that delves a little deeper into the
chemistry/biology.  I've learned alot with Emile Penaud's book "Knowing
and Making Wine" but wouldn't mind something a bit more updated.
Suggestions ?

I'm with Andrew Lea that we should conquer our fear of analytical
instruments and employ pH meters. Drop your rocks and pick up a wheel,
troglodytes
Which meter, you are wont to ask?
My all-time favorite is the HACH 290A.  Check eBay.  It is a handheld
device, so it can operate on a 9V battery.  It has datalogging
capabilities, so it can record pH changes while you are asleep, or
otherwise engaged.  It needs a BNC connected pH probe, but these are
widely available; and it can collect temperature, so you can correct pH
readings as your environment deviates from 20�C.
Probes are more finicky, but as a rule, keep them sealed in a dilute
(3M) solution of Potassium Chloride (KCl) and they will serve many, many
years.  You will spend some funds to acquire a decent probe, but
certainty is its own reward.

Just to clarify, "dry hopping" is actually done post-boil, usually after
primary fermentation has completed. Adding hops at the end of the boil is
just considered to be a late hop addition.


Amarillo and Citra are both pretty standard American hop varieties with a
lot of citurs character that could work well. Alternatively, for something
more subtle you could try one of the European "noble hop" varieties such as
Hallertauer or Saaz for floral/spice note. In the end, there are lots of
choices out there and, as with many other options in cidermaking, brewing,
etc, I'm sure it will be somewhat a matter of personal opinion and
experimentation.


Something to be careful of when using hops is the tendency for them to get
"skunky." Hops contain a compound which, when exposed to UV radiation (such
as sunlight) converts into the same thing that give skunks their odor. This
is one of the main reasons brewers tend to bottle in brown glass. It cuts
down on the UV light exposed to the beer. It can literally happen to a
bottle in a matter of under 5 minutes of exposure. Cider, mead, and wine
makers don't have to worry about that problem so much when not using hops!

Subject: Too much sulfite added
From: Jim Gerlach <jimgerlach@me.com>

I accidentally added 2 and a half tsp of potassium bisulfide instead of
one half tsp prior to pitching yeast. I am wondering if there is anything
I can do too correct this or if I should just pitch extra yeast and make
sure I keep it really happy.


I thought about starting a yeast starter instead of just adding the yeast
directly to the over sulfited must. Also adding as much air as I can before
I pitch.


Any other ideas?


Are there any nutrients or adjuncts that I should avoid? I usually add DAP,
pectic enzyme and yeast nutrient at the same time I pitch.

The Economic Development Bureaus of Nelson and Albemarle Counties, Virginia
have received funding from the Virginia Department of Agriculture and
Consumer Services to support the production and expansion of hard cider
(fermented apple juice) businesses in Virginia. In order to accomplish
this goal, they are seeking solicitations from qualified firms to conduct:
1) Professional, third-party feasibility study on the economic viability of
artisanal hard cider production in Virginia. It will include an assessment
of the growth potential of the cider industry, as well as the feasibility
of using regionally grown apples in local cider production.
2) Professional, third-party feasibility study on the economic viability of
producing specialized, hard-cider apple varieties to supply regional hard
cider producers. It will explicitly connect local apple growers with the
regional cideries to determine the feasibility of increasing cider apple
production in the test markets of Nelson and Albemarle Counties.
Together, the project will supply a comprehensive, scientific regional
market assessment of hard cider production that will inform apple and
cider producers alike.
For a copy of the full solicitation and additional details, please contact
Maureen Kelley at mcorum@nelsoncounty.org<mailto:mcorum@nelsoncounty.org>.

We are interested in making some cider. Would there be some suggested
reading material for beginners?
