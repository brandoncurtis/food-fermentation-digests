A minor point: A chemist I know said it is actually a blue wavelength (or a
range of blue wavelengths?) that turns hop compounds in beer skunky. Beer
in green or clear bottles in liquor stores, with their fluorescent lights,
are very often skunky.Hence the TV ads a few years ago targeting imported
(to the US) beer in green bottles as being smelly. (I don't know how much
UV fluorescent lights have, probably some, but they are certainly bluer
than incandescents. )

John, the following link will bring you to an article on books for
cider making that I wrote in 1998:
http://cjoliprsf.awardspace.biz/Documents/BooksCider98.pdf


As this was written quite a few years ago, some really good books
were published since. In particular, I would highly recommend the
book from Andrew Lea, "Craft Cider Making", and also the following
web site, written and maintained by him:
http://www.cider.org.uk/


The book by Ben Watson is also a good read: "Cider, hard and sweet".


And relative to Josh's post on a more advanced reference on cider
making, there is always the book by Andrew Lea (again!) and J.R.
Piggot: "Fermented Beverage Production" - this one is highly
technical and covers all fermented beverages and not only cider.

I miswrote about the 290A being a HACH unit.  It was made by ORION (now
part of the Thermo group.)  The ORION 290A has been discontinued since
somewhere in the Younger Bush Administration, so eBay might be
marketplace of last resort.  The units are quite rugged, with a life
span that certainly exceeded the designers' expectations.
HACH has a large portfolio in portable units, and a very nice, multi-use
package is their HQ40d.  Capabilities include dissolved oxygen
monitoring.  A useful parameter in yeast metabolism and shelf life
stability.

Field Effect Tranistor (FET) probes were to have replaced electrolyte
filled glass probes, and provide greater durability with minimal care.
I tried one a few years ago, but haven't kept up on their development.
An inexpensive meter with a pH specific FET probe might fit the bill for
cider makers.  I'd be surprised if HANNA instruments doesn't have such a
thing.
Happy New Year,

In the last CD,

That's pointlessly snotty, and also not what Andrew said, nor intended.
Nobody's afraid of analytical instruments (and anyway, isn't the human
eye's color discrimination capability an "analytical instrument"?).


IF pH strips worked as advertised/intended, they would be the best choice
for most cidermakers.  Just as Andrew explained, it's a problem if you
only use a pH meter for a couple months of the year--it's too easy to kill
the electrode by lack of maintenance.  (I should know...BTDT.)  Then when
apple pressing season comes around, you have NO means of measuring pH
until you replace the electrode (or the meter).


As Andrew explained further, the problem is that (some/most) of the strips
do NOT perform as they should.  I have used some for years which appeared
to correlate well with my deceased pH meter.  They came from what seems
to be a reputable laboratory equipment supplier.

 From Dec 1 - Dec 17 a group of us toured orchards and visited cider
makers in Herefordshire, Somerset, and elsewhere in western and
southwestern England.  It was a lot of fun.  Beginning today, and
continuing for the next week or so, I will be posting photos of the
trip on the Fedco Trees Facebook page.   You might find some of the
photos of interest.
Season's Greetings!

Subject: Inline Carbonation

I am curious if anyone out there uses inline carbonation for carbonating
before bottling? If you do, can you please tell me about the results?
Additionally, what unit do you use? ie ICS 610 or something different.
Lastly, where did you purchase the unit?
Thanks,
Sean

  In Digest #1680 Jay discussed skunking of hopped ciders.


  Dry hopped ciders should not skunk because it is the isomerised (sp?)
hop acids in beer which, when exposed to blue/green light(450nm if I
recall correctly) cause skunk.
