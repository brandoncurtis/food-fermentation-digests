For an interesting (though far from comprehensive) discussion of
Brewpubs and Microbrewed ales, check out the November 1987
issue of the Atlantic Monthly. It explains why people homebrew
better than anything else (so when your friends say "You brew your
own ? How quaint.", hand 'em a photocopy and hope they see the light).

Dick Dunn wrote an impassioned defense of Zymurgy (in response to
some derogatory comments about it).


However, the original question was where to write (to subscribe, if
possible) remains unanswered. Can anyone fill in the blanks ?

Does anyone have any suggestions and sources for ale yeasts other than
EDME or RED STAR?

Subject: Spiced Ales


I got a few questions about spiced ales; I'd like to make a Holiday ale
with corriander and cardomon (a la last year's Anchor Christmas Ale).  How
do I add the spices, how much should I use?


My plan is to add the spices just at the end of the boil, dump them in with
my finishing hops.  I've also considered adding them when I rack to secondary,
much like dry hopping.  Any ideas?


I am guessing on the amount of spice to add to the wort and/or beer.  I plan
on using 1/8 tsp of corriander and 1/16 tsp of cardomon per 12 ounce bottle;
this translates to 5 tsp and 2.5 tsp per 5 gallon (40 bottle) batch.  I based
this by doctoring Sierra Nevada Pale Ale; I mixed the spice and beer in a
blender.


How do spices change during the ferment?  Will the spices lessen their effect
because aromatics are driven off by the carbon dioxide?  Will the spices
increase their affect because of long contact with the beer?

hey thanks to jmiller for putting in that micro and brewpub list.
Please note that Bill Newman's brewery is now defunct. He contracts
through F.X.MATT in Utica. You stand a better chance of getting a 
response by writing them. I know I long ago gave up waiting for him 
to return my calls.
Also you should add the Northampton Brewing Co. on Brewster Court in
Northampton Mass. These guys are relatively new (~1yr). Greg Noonan
has a brewery due to open on Nov. 12th in Burlington, Vt. Of course 
greg would have to schedule this on the same day as our Flavor perception
seminar. Well good thing I'll be going to burlington when RPI plays UVM
in hockey anyway.

Subject: Apple Cider Season


Now that November's rolling around apples are being pressed
almost daily up here and I see that I'm not the only one who
has a craving for apple cider.


This means that I and many others are going into the apple cider brewing
mode for a couple of months.


For those of you who have never tried apple cider before (the sparkling
kind) I strongly recommend trying to make some.


The bare minimum recipe defies simplicity:
(add refinements like cambden tablets to suit own taste)
1. 20 litres or so of freshly pressed apple cider (juice). WITHOUT 
preservatives!!
2. Champagne yeast.


Keep in primary for about a week until drops to a small number from
1.050-1.060 (read LOTS of alcohol in this one).
Rack into secondary for about 3weeks- a month.
Add a cup of sugar and bottle- drink 2 weeks later (at earliest).


The result is a potent (10-15%) sparkling DRY apple juice. Drink in 
moderation.


Last year made a batch which I just finished drinking in June of this year
and it seemed to get better and better with increasing age.


2 weeks ago I tried again but to my dismay I accidentally got a batch of
cider with preservatives (read: will not ferment until it spoils).


Time to try again.

ps. Does anybody have any suggestions as to how to make the end product
a sweet cider instead of a very dry one (which is what happened last 
year). I would love to capture the Strongbow or Woodpecker full-
bodied semi-sweet flavour.


pps. An update on the current situation- As of the 28th of Oct I racked
a new batch and it's fermenting and smelling VERY nice. I can't wait until
it's ready....
