To Nancy Lawler:
 There is a mail order homebrew supply shop right here in Troy, N.Y. that
 has Edme, Red Star, Leigh & Williams, Munton & Fison (Levuere), Doric,
 Wyeast Liquid Ale and I think at least one or two other top fermenters
 as well as 4 types of bottom fermenters. It is called
 Hennessey Homebrew
 431 Troy Rd.
 Rensselaer, N.Y. 12144
 518-283-7094
 They take credit cards for phone orders over $25 or you can call and
 ask for a catalog to mail order.


 In response to Mr. J Norowolski, if you've been reading this for a
 while you'd have seen my posting a few weeks ago re: hard cider in
 which i use the same simple technique. I am with you in crediting 
 the preservative sodium benzoate as being the main nasty in trashing
 yeast. A few weeks  ago someone had a question about a cider/honey/raisin
 mixture which got stuck and couldn't be restarted. Someone else replied
 something about the honey doing it. I have never! had problems fermenting
 honey. It is quite common (as opposed to said persons previous assertion)
 for apple ciders to be preserved, especially with sodium benzoate.
 Cider is simple to make but as you say one must be careful to get
 UNPRESERVED cider.


 In answer to your question of how to make sweet cider. We tried the obvious
 let it ferment out then sweeten it to taste with table or corn sugar. I
 would also think that chilling it to knock out the yeast at the desired
 gravity and then racking off the sedimented yeast would have a similar
 effect. I believe champagne yeast is fairly temperature sensitive so 
 I think this should work. Good Luck!

I too am interested in Apple Cider.  Are there any good how too books?
I also like a less than very dry cider, does this mean adding complex
sugars which ferment less readily, and if so, what sugars from what
source are best?


I have never dabbled in yeast other then ale and lager, what should I know
about Champaign yeast?


Regards

I've never tried this, but I believe that TCJoHB recommends
making a strong "tea" or infusion of the spices and adding it
(strained) at bottling time.  This would allow you to control 
the flavor pretty well, since the amount of spice in the 
uncarbonated beer is the amount you'll have in the finished product.
