Regarding sweet ciders, I have often made dry ciders
and then served them mixed with unfermented cider "to
taste."  This does not produce the nice woody aging
of the British ciders, but is pleasant and gives the
drinker the option of controlling the sweetness of the
drink.  Another possibility is the "Melomel/Cyser"
recipe which I sent in a while back.  Again, it's
dissimilar to the British products (and I AM an addict
of Strongbow), but provides an extremely pleasant
alternative.  I have definitely done a lot of "tempering"
of my cider products at various stages by addition of
fresh, unfermented juice, with a multitude of results --
none bad, all different.  Try it.
Cheers,
Ye Olde Batte
