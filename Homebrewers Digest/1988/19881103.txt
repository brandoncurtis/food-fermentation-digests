Let me point out that *I* have not seen a copy of Zymurgy, and would be
happy to see one if anyone cares to send me a copy they have laying around.

I|Here, I suspect, we get to the crux of the matter.  Zymurgy incurred the
|wrath of some homebrew shops by carrying a fair bit of mail-order adver-

|in fact, some attempt at a boycott of Zymurgy.  More on this below.  My


This could well be it.  In the same conversation they mentioned their
home brew club which they disbanded when the members tryed to form a co-op.


|This one puzzles me...because neither AHA nor Zymurgy has any "founding
|sponsors" as far as I can tell.  It grew out of genuine local craziness in
|Boulder (that's one thing we export) ten years ago.  All of the initial
|advertising was local, most of the early sponsors were local.  Wine and
|Brew by You is the only serious long-time sponsor (and NOT an initial one)
|in mossberg's area.  So who is this "founding sponsor," anyway?  I'd kind
|of like to understand what's going on here.  I'll be glad to research the
|local AHA/Zymurgy end of it if someone can provide the other details.


That is the place.

You say that you have tried adding sugar to cider.  Was this at bottling
or drinking time?  I thought that cooling yeast slowed it down but did
not stop it.  Several breweries (Mackeson for one) add sweeteners
just before bottling, but they pasteurize the beer first.  This means,
of course, that bottle conditioning is impossible.  One incredibly
laborious method would be to let the fermentation complete.  Carefully
heat the cider to kill the yeast (boiling is not necessary).  Add any
amount of your favorite sweetener.  Lastly, add a carefully weighed
chunk of dry ice to each bottle before capping.  No, I haven't tried
this and don't really intend to.  Using dry ice to carbonate seems
fraught with peril.  And besides, it hardly follows the spirit home
brewing.  But I don't see how adding sugar to anything with live yeast
could lead to anything other than forty eight little time bombs.
