There was a question recently about a PC network for homebrewing.  The AHA
is attempting to get Compuserve to set up a beer/homebrew network.
Compuserve is not convinced that there is enough interest.  It would help
if the AHA could present them with a list of people that are interested in
such a service.  Anyone who is interested can e-mail their name to me
(att!drutx!homer) or mail to:


The American Homebrewers Association
P.O. Box 287
Boulder, Colorado 80306-0287


It might also help if those who are Compuserve customers would mention
that in the note.


Thank you,
