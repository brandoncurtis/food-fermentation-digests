Subject:    AHA network via jim homer


I would be interested in participating in a
network such as that described by Jim Homer.
However, I haven't time to write a regular
postal letter, and his email address is not
available to me through bitnet.  Therefore I
am sending to the homebrew line so that he can
get it.  My postal address is:
             Morgiana P. Halley
             Dept. of Folklore, Mem. Univ. of Nfld.
             St. John's, Nfld.  CANADA  A1C 5S7
My bitnet address is:  MHALLEY`at`MUN.CA
I hope the new net gets going, although I doubt it
could be better than this one.  Cheers to Rob for
starting it!
RE: the question last week about blueberry mead.
Be prepared for sweetness.  Almost all fruit meads
are "dessert wine" sweetness.  Other than that, I
can't think of any "handy hints".  Let me know your
results.
Regards to all,
"Ye Olde Batte"
