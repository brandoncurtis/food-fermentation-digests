Subject: Lager Yeast Problems


My brewing partner and I have been having a lot of bad luck with dry lager
yeast, and need some advice. It seems like no matter what we do, it doesn't
want to start. We recently had to dump a batch of pilsner due to a bad
bacteria infection, probably related to the fact that the yeast still
hadn't started after three days! Using the exact same procedures we've had
no problems with dry ale yeast. I appriciate that lager yeast isn't suppose
to start as quickly as ale yeast, but this is getting ridiculas. Here's
what we've tried so far:


o Different brands of yeast. We've tried every brand that is locally
available (from three different stores) except Red Star, with little
difference.


o Proofing. We've tried proofing the yeast in a malt extract solution 1/2
hour before pitching. With Edme ale yeast we get a tremendous start, but
little if anything seems to happen when we use lager yeast.


o Temperature control. We now use a wort chiller to cool the wort to about
80 degrees before we pitch the yeast. This hasn't helped.


o Better sanitation procedures. 


Things that we're thinking about trying:


1) Chilling the wort even further before pitching the yeast.


2) Trying Red Star lager yeast.


3) Trying a liquid yeast.


4) Using a glass carboy for primary fermentation (I just obtained a couple
used 6.5 gallon carboys).


5) Ordering some dry yeast from a mailorder supplier.


Beer making season is upon us, and I'm very interested in experimenting
with yeast culturing. It's obvious, though, that we need to solve this
basic problem before we try anything more elaborate. Any ideas?


Thanks,
/Don

Subject:    Roses for Arthur


Sorry about the misinformation on fruit meads.  The only people
I know who brew them much PREFER them heavy and sweet and plan
them that way.  Many are even made with canned fruit.  I'd like
to taste that dryish blueberry.  Sounds like I'd enjoy it.
For Arthur and his roses:
I found another rose recipe.  I haven't tried this one, so can't
really vouch for it, but it sounds interesting.  It's from a
little booklet called "The Delicious Rose" by Geraldine Duncann,
which was circulated at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire and May
Market in Agoura CA about 10 or 12 years ago.  She calls it
"Rose Melemell" although it has no honey in it, and the recipe
is worded rather archaically, to conform with Faire practice.
"Fill a glass container with rose petals.  Cover with water and
let set, covered by a clean cloth, for 3 days.  Strain the water
through a cloth and measure.  Put to it, one quarter its volume
of white sugar.  Set in a jar or crock, add a pinch of dry
yeast and stir well.  When it is sparkling (bubbling just ever
so slightly -- this will take from 3 days to one week, depending
on the weather), put into beer or champagne bottles and top with
crown caps.  Do not use old wine bottles as the containers must
be able to withstand pressure.  Set down to age for at least one
month, but no more than 6.  This is an effervescent, lightly
alcoholic brew with a hint of summer roses."
The booklet was printed by Mother Goose Enterprises, 3440
Mountain Spring Road, Lafayette CA 94549, and was
copyrighted by Duncann in 1978.  All her books have
interesting recipes for foods and drinks of various
sorts with a medieval bent.  You might want to get
hold of them.
I'm about halfway through my beer, and it hasn't lost any
of its charm.  I also have a batch of cyser melomel on the
locks and a fresh-off-the-rack metheglyn for the holidays.
Now I'm dropping the brewing until after New Year's, since
I'm too busy BAKING.
I really am sorry about that bloop, but I can only speak
from my own limited experience.  Sorry.
In case I'm not back to you before, Happy Holidays!
Also, be CAREFUL about intake and driving!
Love to all,
Ye Olde Batte

Subject: A table of original and final gravities for extracts and malts


  Does any one have any data on what percent of the original
 gravity of lets say crystal malt is unfermentable and contributes
 to the final gravity? Also maybe how much of the final gravity
 are complex sugars? I am looking at this as a way to figure out
 how sweet a beer will be once it is done. This may be something
 that was sent a ways back, but I'm a relatively new reader. I am
 looking for this information in regards to malt/extract, grains
 etc. I know some cans of malt extract list there final gravity,
 I was wondering if a table or something of the sort exists. I
 saw the Zymurgy article that listed tables of bittering units etc.
 Has someone done the same with gravities.

PS I'm not trying to make this a science but I would like to
   be able to plan my brew just a little bit.
