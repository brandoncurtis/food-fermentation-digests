I am going to try using liquid yeast instead of dry yeast
for my next few batches.  I would like to know if anyone
has used William's liquid yeasts.  I got a catalog from
William's recently and they seem to have just about anything
a homebrewer would need.  I quickly looked through their
catalog and noticed a few items that caught my eye: liquid
yeasts, a sanitizing solution dispenser, and a few others.
Could those of you that have used either the yeasts or the
sanitizing solution dispenser (or have positive or negative
comments about William's (Brewing Supply I believe - I wish
I had the catalog here with me) please either send me email
or post to the homebrew "net?"  Thanks.


Al.
