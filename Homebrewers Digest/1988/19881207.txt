hi,
 Dick dunn's recipe sounds good. I've got to start drinking more so I can
 try out some of these great recipes i've been getting lately.


 Some answers for brian b.


 The advantage of the 2 stage system is to move the beer off of sedimented
 yeast. This helps to aid clarification and prevent off flavors from yeast
 decay. There may be some others I just can't recall. Personally I use a
 single stage technique in a carboy with a blow off tube for ales, and a
 2 stage in carboys for lagers. I've never had problems with the single stage.
 Of course carboys make it harder to dry hop (add hops to the fermenter)


 Next answer. Most people add hops during the boil and at the end. the ones
 added during (at any of various and varying times) are for bittering. The
 hops added in the last 5 minutes are for aroma (finishing). Any hops added
 to the fermenter also help the aroma.


 Brewers call it wort, not must.


 The boil should be a nice rolling boil. This creates something called a
 hot break which I believe helps to force proteins and tannins into solid
 form where they will settle out of the wort.


 I believe most of this is accurate, if not I'm sure additional corrections
 will be forthcoming.
