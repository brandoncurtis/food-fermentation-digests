Subject: Good supplier for wet yeast???


O.K.  I've looked at the carrot long enough and I'm ready to try liquid
yeasts.  Now the problem is where should I get it from?


I got a catalog from the cellar not long ago and I was checking out their
liquid yeasts.  The yeast comes in a pouch that you squish together to
activate (is this common??)???   The cost for the yeast is $3.99 regardless
of type and they have something like 10 of them.  Well I was all set and
filled out the order form for the yeast and a couple of things I can't
get local and then came the shock of my life.  When I calculated the shipping
costs it was over 1/4 the price of the package.  Should I expect this when
I mail order???  Does anybody have any recomendations as to a more reasonable
mail order place?


Another thing is that I've seen references to a yeast bank and I was wondering
what it is, where I might get such a thing, and if those of you that use it
think it is worth its investment.  My original approach to running a culture
was going to be to use quart size mason jars with sterile wort to propagate
ala the JOHB.  I figured a quart over the size of a beer bottle might allow
for better pitching rates.  As usual, comments are appreciated.

I have been using Williams supplies a lot lately and have found their stuff
to be very good. They have their own malt extract and malt extract syrup which
seems to be very good quality. Their kits are also good. I and several people
in our club have made the wheat beer kit (which uses liquid yeast) and they
have all turned out great. I'm making a bock right now (based on TCJoHB
"Potlatch Dopplebock") using Williams ingredients and liquid lager yeast.
Its fermenting away right now. It took about 24 hours from pitching till
there were signs of activity.


I have had one unusual experience - I made a porter about two months ago and
used their dried ale yeast - I forget the variety but it is a package of
14 grams, which it says is twice as much as normal dried packages so the
ferment starts fast. However after 24 hours there was no sign of any activity
so I panicked and threw in a package of Ironmaster yeast I had lying around.
(That was partly because I was leaving town for two days and didnt want to
risk it.) It was going well when I got back. Usually using dried yeast I have
activity within hours, and its blowing off in 24. Anyone else have any
experience with Williams dried ale yeast?
