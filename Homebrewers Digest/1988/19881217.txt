I have found that Hennessy Homebrew has consistently been the most
reliable and inexpensive mail order supplier.  Although their catalog
is not as extensive as the Cellar, their prices are much better and 
include shipping.  They carry two Wyeast varieties, Brewer's Choice
Ale and Lager `at`$4.25.  One can call in orders and receive them within
the week.

I can recommend the Brewer's Choice Ale yeast from personal
experience.  It provides a clean and full fermentation.

Wyeast yeast comes in a foil package containing yeast and starter. You
skwish it to start the process going.  It's very convenient.  Other liquid
yeasts such as MeV (Toronto, Canada) give you a little vial for which you
have to prepare the starter.

One retailer in Western Massachusetts (Charlie Olchowski/Frozen Wort in
Greenfield) started carrying Wyeast over a year ago.  At that time he could
NOT SELL THE YEAST MAILORDER.  If I wanted it, I had to drive to his house
to pick it up personally.  I was told that the Wyeast Lab was concenrned
about spoilage and would not allow him to ship it by UPS or US mail. He
received his yeasts by overnight express in a special refrigerated package
(dry ice??).  If Wyeast still requires special shipping, that might explain
the high shipping cost.  They weigh only a few ounces, so shipping 
shouldn't be expensive.

I've done business with three local retailers here in Massachusetts.  They
sell Wyeast for the standard $4; I don't know if they ship it.  Wyeast Labs 
will not sell directly to individuals.

(I have no vested interest in any of these reltailer's business.  I'm just a
satisfied customer.)
