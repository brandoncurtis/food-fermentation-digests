Subject:  Permit me to introduce myself...


Hello, and Happy Holidays!


I've just joined this net, and wanted to introduce myself.  I also want to see
if this gets posted successfully...


I'm Cheryl Feinstein, a Biologist currently working in the Dairy Science Dept.
of the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL.  I've been brewing for almost
2 years now, after wanting to get into it for several years before that.  I
also make liqueurs and hope to get into vinting someday.  My interests in
these and related areas were triggered by my involvement in an historical re-
enactment group.


I am very much looking forward to involvement in this net.  Thank you.
