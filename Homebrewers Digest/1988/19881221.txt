SUBJECT:  More on yeast growth


TO: Darryl


I just re-read my original suggestions and realized that I had misspoke
about where in the growth curve the starter should be.  Obviously, the starter
should be right at the peak and the final concentration of cells in the
wort should approximate the early exponential growth phase (the point 
being that you want the shortest lag phase after pitching).

SUBJECT: Scientific Supply Houses


Sorry, for my fragmented responses.


Recently, there have been several requests for sources of scientific
euqipment useful for the homebrew laboratory.  May I suggest the 
following company that I have used with success:


           Carolinia Biological Supply Company
           2700 York Rd
           Burlington, NC 27215
           (919) 584-0381


These folks will accept call in orders.  Will take master charge or visa.  They ship quickly by UPS with 48 hours.  There also is a California address I 
believe, but I don't have it right at the moment.  Send me an email if you need
it.  They also provide a beautiful catalog.

SUBJECT:  FREEZING YEAST CELLS


There really is no mystery about "freeze-shield" agents.  There
are two commonly used cryoprotective agents used in microbiology:
DMSO and glycerol.  DMSO is used at a final concentration of 10%,
and can be used fresh out of the reagent bottle since this agent
is self sanitizing.  Glycerol is used at a final concentration of
50%.  You must sterilize glycerol before use in a pressure
cooker, or at least sanitize it.  You can sanitize it by placing
the glycerol in a pint mason jar and placing the jar in a boiling
water bath for at least 20 minutes.  Most folks don't like to use
DMSO because of the smell.  I think that you can get glycerol at
the drug store...but it must not contain any adjuncts or
perfumes..ask for the USP grade from the pharmacist.


Some other suggestions:  Freeze only small aliquots.  Once you
have added the cryoprotective agent, place the yeast in the
freezer immediately.  When you are ready to use the frozen stock,
warm it to room temperature quickly.  Transfer cells out of the
freezer quickly to fresh wort.


I hope that this is helpful.

1 pound of material in 1 gallon of water.

Greetings!


     My name is Nicolette Bonhomme, and I am new to the net.  My intro-
duction came through another net concerned with medieval and renaissance
historical research.  My brewing experience centers around mead-making, but
I have also experimented with mulling wine and berry liquer (with pre-made
wine and brandy).  I've never tried beer, but you all sound like you're
having great fun with it!!


     Firstly, here is a small contribution: a recipe for berry liquer.


     1) Let soak for at least one week (three months for my latest
        batch) 1 quart frozen rasberries
               1 quart frozen bluberries
               1 can frozen grape juice concentrate
               approx. 1 quart brandy


     2) Strain the stuff into a jar, being sure to squeeze all the good
        electric juice out of the fruit.


     3) Increase by 25% to 50% with sugar syrup.  Sugar syrup here is
        half and half sugar and water, heated up to dissolve the sugar,
        and then allowed to cool.  The syrup must be room temperature
        before it is added to the berry mixture.


     This stuff is called Pancake Syrup, and rightly so, but it makes
     a wonderful after-dinner desert.


    Secondly, a request.  What constitutes a reasonbly-priced, decent
quality starter kit for beer? What are some good books to read on the
subject?  What are the stupid errors that you wouldn't make now that you've
been brewing for a while?  I have some equipment already: fermentation
locks, bottles, corks, Campden tablets, etc. that I use for making honey
wine.


     Merry merry and a happy happy!

Subject: Re: Liquid Yeast Suppliers


  There have been many queries about liquid yeast suppliers recently.
I buy my yeast from the Frozen Wort (Charlie Olchowski) in Greenfield,
MA. I can get to Greenfield in about 20 minutes from where I live so I
do not need to mail order. (Although it is possible to do so) Charlie
carries about 12 different strains from Wyeast Labs and will have
another 4 in the next couple months. He has always been helpful when I
have had questions regarding the liquid yeasts and I have been very
happy with the results that I have had using the liquid yeast
cultures.
  The address for The Frozen Wort is 473 Main St PO Box 988 Greenfield MA
(413) 773-5920.
  Once again the usual disclaimer: I have no vested interest in the
Frozen Wort, I am a satisfied customer.

Subject: liqueur and hard cider


Well, this is sort of off the subject of 
homebrewing, but most of us probably have
a deep abiding interest interest in booze of
all sorts  ...


Anyway, I have made some liqueurs in the past,
and I just started a bunch of new ones: coffee,
black tea, kiwi, rose, nectarine, and spearmint.
I've seen like 30,000 recipes for coffee liqueurs,
all of which rely upon instant coffee ... Bizzare.
I'd rather make one from real coffee beans, so
this batch is an experiment.


Anyway, in response to the question about peels,
I would advise you to use only the peels of 
organically raised fruit for any recipe that calls
for fruit peels.  It's my impression that the
skin of citrus fruit is not treated as a foodstuff
by commercial growers.


On a subject more closely related to homebrewing:
I'm fermenting a batch of hard cider at the moment.
I didn't add anything to the apple juice except 
a small quantity of chapagne yeast, and I intend
to ferment to completion and then bottle with some
fresh cider for carbonation.  Anyway, I've seen 
some recipes since I've started, and I seem to be
going against conventional wisdom: most of them
call for pounds and pounds of sugar and other nonsense.
So I'm wondering if anyone out there has made 
hard cider without added sugar and would like to
share their experiences.


And if anyone would like to talk about liqueurs, they
can email me.

Subject:  "Stuck" brew


Hi there!


_Re:_  John's brew.  Although I haven't been brewing that long, I've had this
happen to me.  In my case, the brew stopped bubbling after 4 days.
Consultation with wiser heads produced speculation that fermentation had
"stalled" and to spike the wort with a sugar solution like you would use for
priming.  If fermentation again quickly ceases, it's probably done.  This
turned out to be the case for me.  I went ahead and bottled that batch, and
nothing subsequently went *BOOM!*


Also:  "Rock&Roll Music" was originally written and recorded by Chuck Berry,
about 1957.  The Beach Boys covered the tune as well as the Beatles, and
charted very well with it.


Last:  I'm glad there was a real, honest-to-God microbiologist out there...
