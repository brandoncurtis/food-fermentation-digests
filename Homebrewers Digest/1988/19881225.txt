The holidays suddenly appeared and I waited til the last minute to make glog
this year.  For those of you who don't know, it's a swedish holiday drink.
Here's how I make it:


        1 qt. cheap red port
        1 qt. cheap vodka
        1.5 cup sugar
        4 cups water
        8 whole cardamon (sp?)
        20 cloves
        peel from 1 orange
        2 broken-up cinnamin sticks (damn my spelling is off today)
        1 large handful raisins
        4 almonds


        Makes about 3 qts.


        Dissolve the sugar in the water then add the last 6 ingredients.
        Boil for 15 minutes, then add the vodka and port. Bring back
        up to a boil, and remove from burner. Best served warm. Cures
        the common cold. :-)
