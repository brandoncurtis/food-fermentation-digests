I have seen this before using different types of bottles from Grolsch to the
11.5oz short Labbats bottles.  The yeast will cling to the design on the
Grolsch as well as the sholders of the bottle.


I simply use the method the winemakers use, give the bottle a sharp turn and
allow to sit to settle.  The question this brings up is will it shake up the
yeast enough to restart mild fermentation.  I usually do this when moving
bottles from cold storage to the refrig. apx 4-48 hours before drinking.


My brewing has been limited to single can extract brewing with the use of
Corn surgar. (just as a reference point)

For christmas I received a nifty video magazine
that spotlighted 6 microbreweries/brewpubs in the
bay area and briefly went through some of the brewing
process. I thought they packed alot of information
into 30 minutes.


The product is available by mail-order and will
supposedly be followed with 5 or 6 more videos.
At $14.95 per tape it is a reasonable value.I am
supportive of publicizing the brewers movement
and this video is a good start at educating the
masses of Bud/Coors drinkers. I don't have any 
monetary benefit to be gained if you order, I just
want everyone to realize beer can be appreciated and
respected every bit as much as wine.


If anyone is interested in ordering the tape
call (415)821-1706 for more information.

A small favor...if it's not too much trouble, please edit the
"subject" line when replying to the homebrew digest, and insert a
meaningful subject instead of leaving just "Re: Homebrew Digest..."
This will make for a much more useful table of contents. Thanks!


Now for some brewing talk. What do people think of making a beer in
the style of country X, but attempting to make it more authentic
tasting by using malt extract *from* country X? For example, suppose I
want to make a pale ale. Then I would probably use a British malt
extract.  But if I would like to make a Pilsner, then I might seek out
a German or Continental produced malt extract.


The question is, will I be able to tell a difference here, or am I
wasting my effort? The motivation for this is that Continental extracts
seem to be more expensive. In the case of my favorite brand,
exorbitant. (Ireks Bavarian, 3kg can is $20 an up.) I have made a
bunch of Lagers using this particular brand, and I like the final
flavor better than the Lagers I made with British and American
extract.


Now, I'm the first to admit that there are lots of variables that
might account for my preference, including plain old power of
suggestion. I'm aware that the actual malt & water contents vary quite
a bit (thus producing different starting gravites), and that some
extract actually have corn sugar added to them, but _taste_ is what
I'm after.  Does anybody have any comments or observations on the
following:


1. Does better beer result from certain extracts?
2. Are they worth the price?
3. Which exrtact has the best "price/performance" ratio?
4. Should I just relax and quit my whining?
