We brewed some pale ale recently which is flawed only in that it has an
aftertaste, or rather, a taste when burped.  Otherwise, the pale ale
has the desired taste profile.  This strange burp flavor is slightly
medicinal and has occurred in a honey ale as well.  However, it is
missing from a recently brewed porter.  We have been using dry EDME
yeast and wonder if the taste results from a compound leeching from
autolysing yeast.  Any comments or advice on how to rid our brew of
this subtle yet unpleasant contaminant?

Don't do this.  Although a temperature of 300 F may not seem too high,
remember that there are going to be spots in the oven which will be
much hotter for short intervals.  Heating beer bottles (which, after all,
aren't designed to be high-quality sturdy glassware) to such tempera-
tures, unevenly, will weaken the glass and increase the chance of a bottle
bursting if the carbonation is a little on the high side.

Subject: finding bottles and cases


I'd like to put a slightly different twist on Richard Stern's request for
information on bottles.  I've been using non-returnable, non-twist-off
bottles for a long time.  Specifically, I use a combination of Anchor and
large Tooth's Sheaf Stout bottles--the Anchor bottles are the most space-
efficient I've found; the Tooth's bottles aren't bad, they match up, etc.
No troubles; the bottles have held up fine.  And somehow I don't have any
trouble obtaining them (especially the Anchor bottles); they just seem to
keep showing up.


What I WOULD like to find is some source for cases to put them in for
carrying around, holding bottles during bottling, etc.  Right now I'm using
the original cardboard cases.  These would seem to be a source of dust and
a repository for bacteria and other beer buglies.  It would be nice to find
either plastic carriers which fit the beer bottles and have dividers OR
some Q&D (well, not very D) way to make durable cases with a smooth
finish.

Some non-returnable bottles do work.  Anchor Steam bottles seem to be a
favorite.  I've placed some heavily carbinated meads (1 cup priming/5
gal.) and never had trouble with them.


If your area has a recycling center, they might have various bottles
for sale.  Another source is other homebrewers.  Many of us seem to
save bottles in the belief that we might suddenly be taken with an
urge to quadruple our brewing.
