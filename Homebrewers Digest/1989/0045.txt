Subject: re: using champagne bottles


My experience has been that US champagne (perhaps I should say methode
champagniose sparkling wines) bottles do take a normal crown cap, but French
bottles will not.  (I haven't any idea about other countries, but when I
get a bottle of Cordineiu (sp?), I'll report back to the net.)  So stock
up on the Korbel and separate the Chandon from the Moet.
