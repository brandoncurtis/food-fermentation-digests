        Thanks to all who responded to my request for info on Seattle
        brewpubs. It looks like this business trip isn't going to be
        so boring after all.

Subject: Papain and Demerara Sugar


Greetings:


Two notes/queries for the week:


        1) My last batch of bitter had a disturbing chill haze in
        it.  Presumably this had to do with excess tannins in the
        fermenting wort (so I'm told).  Over the weekend when I was
        in the brew store I picked up a packet of Burton water 
        salts.  I normally use my own mix of Epsom and Gypsum salts
        that I buy in bulk.  What attracted me to this little 40        
        cent packet was the fact that they listed Papain as an in-
        gredient and stated that it discouraged chill haze.  If
        memory serves me correctly, papain is the enzyme used to
        remove protein deposits from soft contact lenses.  Any know
        (or wish to guess) it's action in fermenting beer?


        2) Dave Line's book The Big Book of Brewing has many recipes
        that call for Demerara sugar.  Since I'd never been able to
        find this stuff at the supermarket, I ignorantly assumed it
        to be merely a British name for some other common household
        sugar.  Today I saw a (roughly) one pound bag at the market
        selling for (gasp!!) 4.75 cents.  It was next to the 69 cent
        bags of brown sugar.  Does anyone know what this outrageously
        priced stuff is?  Why is it so expensive and what is a useful
        substitute for making the beers listed in Dave Line's book?


                                Cheers,


                                 Andy Newman

Just happened to notice this--Roger Locniskar said Zymurgy [AHA] is at:
> (303)477-0816


That should be 447-0816

My understanding is that a number of the centrifuge the beer before
bottling.

|I was wondering about this.  Since hops are somewhat related to other green

|just never heard anybody talk about it before.  (I can't imagine why! :-)


|Does it need to be a real heavy beer like stout to balance the fairly

|I think it would be interesting to try this.  Strictly for scientific
|purposes, you understand.


I have seen recipes for such beers in copies of articles from High Times
and some biker magazine.  If you're actually interested, I'll try to get
copies of them.

Subject: Crushing grains, blow-off and cherries
Full-Name: 


 First some quick responses to some recently discussed topics:


 1. Grain crushing


    I too have had the unpleasant experience of using a rolling pin or
    other tedious method for crushing grain.  Without a grain mill the
    easiest method I have encountered is using a blender.  BUT WAIT
    there is a better way!!! Some of the suppliers of fine brew supplies
    such as Alternative Beverage out of North Carolina (1-800-356-BREW)
    will crush the grain for you for an additional 15 cents per pound.
    This may not be the way to go if you are a die hard masher but if
    you mash infrequently and prefer not to purchase a grain mill it
    seems to be convenient and affordable.  (If you estimate a grain mill
    to be $45.00 you would have to purchase and CRUSH 300 pounds of grain
    before the savings are realized.)


 2. Blow-off Method


    I am also an advocate of the Blow-off method.  I use a hose that is
    slightly larger than the diameter of the mouth of a carboy (I believe
    approx 1.25").  One end of course being inserted into the mouth of the
    carboy and the other inserted into a pot of water.   Not only does this
    size tube reduce drastically the possibilities of any type of clogging
    but this it is very easy to clean.  I have even used a bottle brush to
    clean it out.  Alternative Beverages is who sold me on the idea and I
    have lived happily ever after.


 Finally I have a question about brewing beer with fruit namely cherries.
 I have recenlty brewed a Cherry Bock using about 7.5 lbs. of pitted sour
 cherries.  I steeped the cherries after boiling and hopping the wort and 
 poured the wort and all into the primary.  I did not remove the cherries
 until the beer was moved into the secondary.  My question is for those how
 have brewed with cherries before (or heard through the cherry vine).  Have 
 you brewed with different types of cherries such as dark sweet, etc. and what
 are your impressions of the results as well as any comments on comparisons of
 having used different types.
