I just wanted to let you know that I got your mail.  I'll be on vacation
from 1/30/89 to 2/3/89.  I'll be back to work on 2/6/89.

A while back I asked for advice on how to sweeten an already brewed
and fermented beer.  Here is a summary of the responses I got:


>


Yup, that's right.  Zippo.  Not one of you responded.  I really need
some help on this one, so I'll ask again.


I brewed a batch of Bock beer a few weeks ago.  It is still lagering
in secondary.  At the time I racked from primary, I took a sample for
a hydrometer reading and tasting.  I came to the realization that I
had gone a bit overboard with the real dark grains.  The wort had
completely fermented out and resulted in an extremely dry beer.


I would like to add a bit of Dextrin (non-fermentable sugar) to my
priming mix at bottling time in an attempt to sweeten the beer, add
a bit more 'body' and balance out the roasted flavor.


The question is how much?  I've never used Dextrin powder before, but
I've heard that a little goes a long way.  Should I use a 1/2 cup for
5 gallons, or much less, like around 2 to 3 Tbsp.?


I don't actually want the beer to taste sweet, but right now it is way
too dry for the bitterness.


PLEASE RESPOND TILL MY MAILBOX RUNNETH OVER.  Thank you.

Is anybody here entering the Homebrew Contest this year?


I am brewing a Porter tomorrow and, if all goes well, will consider
entering it just for the hell of it.  I don't really expect to win
anything, I just think it would be fun.

Re: Andy Newman's inquiry about Papain and chill haze:


Chill haze is caused by proteins and not by tannins,
thus this would explain why Papain reduces chill haze.
I'm not sure how Papain works, but three other finings
(as they are generally called), Irish Moss, geletin,
and polyclar (sp?), work by electrical attraction,
drawing the proteins towards themselves as they sink
to the bottom of the fermenter.
