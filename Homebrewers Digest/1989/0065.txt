You can ship the stuff legally.  Mark it "non-perishable foodstuff"
and put it on the bus or train.


There is a danger that UPS or the snail will put it on an airplane.
How likely are your bottles to withstand the reduced pressure of a
cargo hold at 25000 feet?

It's nice to get rid of a lot of that yeast.  I use a two-stage
ferment (large plastic vessel, then glass carboy).  This leaves
a lot of the yeast in the large plastic vessel.


Before bottling, I siphon back from the carboy to a plastic vessel
before priming.  Again, most of the yeast stays behind.  Hint: move
the carboy to the siphoning site some hours before.  I prime and
bottle from the plastic vessel.


I have found that this procedure reduces the amount of sediment in
the bottles to a very thin scum.  Due to the reduction in yeast, the
beer may take longer to condition.

Subject: Table of Mail Order Extract Prices


Since I am a founding member of CARMAL (CAmpaign for Real MAiL) I have a 
tendency to send away for anything that is advertised as free. Thus I have
a lot of homebrew mail order catalogs which I browse through every time
I feel like making up some alt gueuze choke cherry oatmeal pilsener. 


My type A side overcame my type B side recently and I compiled a list
of mail order stores and the prices they charged for 7 popular extracts
or extract kits. Since there's been some grumbling about extract prices
on the news letter and in rec.food.drink about prices for extract I 
figure yunz (as we used to say in Pittsburgh) could make do with this
list. 


Before I start I need to get some weaseling (disclaimers) out of the way:


1) I do not work for or represent any of these stores. I do business with
   two of them (one for prices and one because of service) but I'm not
   going to identify either of these.


2) Prices are from catalogs received within the last 3 months. Prices
   may have changed or I may have made errors compiling the list. Use
   these prices only as lower limits. Get a catalog and check all prices
   before ordering. Also remember good service is just as important as
   price.


3) Prices do not reflect shipping costs. Although most stores are fair 
   in charging for shipping increased distances can greatly affect
   the price you pay for a product. There are also some stores which
   I feel charge unfair amounts for shipping. Again check all costs
   before ordering. 


4) Quality may vary from store to store. That's why I haven't included
   hops or grains here. Good hops are worth extra money and although
   grains seem less perishable you should buy small orders before
   you commit to large shipments from any store.


5) Extracts sampled were selected on the basis of how many stores
   carried them. Some stores may appear to have a small selection
   because they do not carry the items I picked. Again these
   samples do not represent the full selections available at any store
   so try to get as many catalogs as possible.


6) I make no claims about the quality of any of the extracts listed.


7) I do not want to list addresses. All are available in recent issues
   of Zymurgy magazine. If you really must get an address contact me
   by e-mail (lsmith`at`umn-cs.cs.umn.edu). I've tried to include as
   many catalogs as possible. If they're not listed they probably
   didn't send me a catalog.


OK Now that I have reduced my liability here are the products sampled.


1) Coopers (Aus) Stout Kit
2) Mountmellick (Ire) Stout Kit 
3) Munton & Fison (UK) Old Ale Kit
4) Alexander's (USA) Pale Malt Extract
5) Ireks (Ger) Any of the 6.6 lb plain extracts
6) Edme (UK) DMS extract (3.varies can)
7) John Bull (UK) plain extract (pale or dark)
