In response to the flurry of rumors about the AHA competition, I am
submitting this in hopes of clearing up any confusion or mis-information.


The Winter 1988 (Vol. 11, No. 5) issue of Zymurgy, page 32 has information
on the competition.  Following are selected excerpts from that page:


    Enter the 1989 Eleventh Annual American Homebrewers Association
                    National Homebrew Competition


    Entry deadline will be April 24, 1989.  Preliminary juding will take
    place April 25 to May 15 in Boulder, Colorado.  Finals will be judged
    June 7 and 8 in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky.  Complete details, registration
    forms, rules and regulations will appear in the Spring 1989 issue of
    Zymurgy magazine, which members should receive by mid-March. (See below
    for advance information requests.)


    Here are a few rules to keep in mind:


    o  For the Preliminary Judging all entrants must submit ONE 10 to 14
       ounce green or brown glass bottle.  Wire and porcelain swing tops
       and corks are not acceptable closures.  Use only crown caps.


[This is important!  Now you know how to bottle your (hopefully) winning
entry.]

    Additional information will be sent to all active members of the AHA
    by mid-March, 1989.  Advance information is available on request, but
    request must be accompanied by self-addressed, stamped (45 cents)
    business-sized envelope.  Call or write the American Homebrewers
    Association, Box 287, Boulder, CO  80306  USA, (303) 447-0816.


Hope this helps everybody to relax and not worry.
