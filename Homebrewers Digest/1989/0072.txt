I'm not sure the water is the problem here ... I think you'd
find Dos Equis, Bohemia, or Negra Modelo more acceptable.
These still might not be to your tastes, but I suspect that
judging Mexican beer by Tecate is rather like judging U.S.
beer by Oly.

Subject: Very High Terminal Gravity


Well, I really messed up mashing.  2.5 weeks ago I made a dark lager.
I wanted a sweet beer to match the dark grains and high hop rate; well,
I got it in spades.  Aiming for a starch rest of 155 degF, I overshot
to almost 160.


My beer is clearing (no finings), is aging, and smells and tastes (for
flat new beer) wonderful.  There is no evidence of fermentation.  Another
carboy sitting next to it (containing Pilsner made Sunday) is fermenting
nicely, and the room is holding at 45-50 degF, so there's no reason to
think that I shocked the yeast (Wyeast Danish lager) by temperature.


The original gravity was 1.050.  It is now 1.022!  Yes, twenty-two.


I see the following options:


1. Throw it out and have a good cry.  This seems stupid in light of the
low cost in materials and labor to do #2:


2. Prime it, bottle it, and hope for the best.  If nothing else I may
learn something.


3. Add corn sugar and/or water to lower the gravity.  I guess this will
screw up the balance, though.


4. Brew a complementary batch, with a very low final gravity, and blend them.
This may just be throwing a good brew session after a bad one, though.


5. ????


I'm leaning to #2.  I'll let it sit for a few weeks to make a
final determination that it's not fermenting.  I also have some of the
original bitter wort that I canned; I think I'll put some in a jug
with some yeast and see what *it* ferments out to.  This should prove
that the wort was the problem.


Anybody have any ideas?

I've got Noonan, Miller's first book, and Line's Big Book.  Is there any
reason for me to buy Miller's new book?  I'd have to mail order it; I
can't leaf through it in the store to see if I like it. )-:

I get 1.030.  After reading the initial posting I got out Noonan's book
and figured that this was .65 pounds per pound of malt: 65%.  I hadn't
used Noonan's method because I was happy using Alan Tobey's method
(see Fall '81 zymurgy) that figures SG per pound per gallon.  He says
28-32, which I get.  I also didn't use Noonan's method because he
prefers professional brewering measures like Balling and pounds of
extract per gallon.  But mostly (pet peeve) his formulas are written
like IRS forms.  What brain dead editor thinks that persons who buy
a book this technical can't deal with simple formulas expressed in
algebraic terms?  He gives a formula for computing the volume of a
cylinder that's 8 or so lines long!  ("Multiply line 3 by 3.14" etc.)

I use a grain mill.  All the books say this is a compromise.

Me too.  Though of course I leave it longer to get that maltose I need.
Miller's first book said don't use this test since husks can react and give
a false positive reading.  I do the test (it's trivial to do) but I
consider it worthless. :-)

Exactly what I do.  I often stop sparging sooner that I "should."  So
what--my time is far more important that achieving a slightly more
efficient extract.  Noonan implies that the cooler method that serves
you and me well is not as good as one where the filter bed is deep.  But
it really is nice.  My first method was Miller's first book grain bag
method.  A real pain by comparison.

Did I compute this wrong?  I computed 1.030 as .65 lb extract / 1 lb malt, which
is far lower than the .80 Noonan says I should get.  My reading of his
book is that you're getting in the high 60s, nowhere near 80.


Noonan's book reads like it came from industry sources.  Their extracts have
got to be better than ours: better equipment and procedures, and more
incentive, too.  I don't really care if I throw a little sugar out with
the spent grain.

Subject: Champagne Yeast and More ??? on dry hopping


First , an apology to Dr. Andrews.  I didn't make sure my brain was
engaged prior to releasing my hands to reply about the yeast issue.
Oh well.  But while on the subject, I mentioned I bottled a kit of
root beer about 4 weeks back.  Well to see if I had any 12oz. time
bombs lurking in my cellar, I opened one to see where the carbonation
had gotten to.  Well it hasn't gotten far at all in this time.  There
was perceivable carbonation just starting, but *just* preceivable.
Therefore I would hazard a guess that the champagne yeast is not as
vigorous as _beer_ yeast.(there I got it right this time)  So I think
using champagne yeast for these applications appears to be a better
bet.  


Now for ideas and questions about dry hooping.  What about using hops
pellets?  I would think that the leaves would harbor a plethora of
badnicks.  Would the use of the pellets be any better?  Could you
microwave the pellets to gain safety?  Since the pellets are just a
concentrated version of the leaf stuff would there be a gain or loss
with this method?  I'm really interested in making a dry hopped brew,
but with all of this concern of infection I would hate to get burned
like so many other people have.

I think Mr. Mossberg has misinterpreted my response on this. By commercial 
brewers I meant any brewery which bottles and sells their product. Yes 
many commercial breweries ferment out, then filter, then inject CO2 into
the beer at bottling time. This is how the really big boys do it.


It is as I stated completely possible to ferment the beer, transfer it to
a conditioning tank where it is allowed to carbonate naturally, and clarify.
Then one of two things can be done. The beer can be bottled straight off,
or it can be filtered on its way into the bottle. It also occurs that some 
brewers filter on the way from the fermentation tank to the conditioning
tank. The reason to filter after conditioning is that at the end of 
conditioning the temperature of the beer is typically lowered. This allows
the CO2 formed to dissolve into the beer better and also causes protein
and tannin to precipitate. If the beer is not chilled the protein and tannin
will remain in suspension. By chilling the beer the precipitate (known to 
homebrewers as chill haze) is forced to form. It may settle out, but more 
typically it must be filtered as a precitpitate.

On Wed. Al Korzonas asked for a table relating specific gravity 
at various temps. to that at 60 F.  Is this what your after?


Temperature (F)        Fudge Factor
____________________________________________
        50                subtract 0.5
        60                0.
        70                add 1
        77                add 2
        84                add 3
        95                add 5
       105                add 7


These factors are thousanths of a unit, e.g. for a measurement
of 1.042 at 70 degrees the true reading is 1.043


Malt Extract Recipes:


A month or so ago I asked for advice and recipes for Pale Ales.
I received exactly NO responses.  Perhaps I was too restrictive.
How about any decent recipes for ANY beers resembling:
        ALES
        LAGERS esp. Pilsner Urquell contestors


My experience with homebrewing to date has been great success
with a John Bull Bitter Ale kit and drinkable but not worth the
effort brews by mixing specialty grains like a pound or so of
crystal malt with unhopped malt extracts and adding leaf hops.
I tried a recipe straight out of Papazian's book and didn't
experiment, Palalia Pale Ale.  It's pretty good but overhopped.
Perhaps I will be assailed with responses stating that I can only
expect great beers by mashing.  I hope not.


So, how about it? 


CAN ANYONE OUT THERE MAKE A DECENT EXTRACT BEER?????????????????


Thank you in advance.


JP
