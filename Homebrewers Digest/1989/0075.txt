In homebrew digest #72, Joseph Palladino asks:


>CAN ANYONE OUT THERE MAKE A DECENT EXTRACT BEER????????????????


Yes.  In previous digests or in rec.food.drink, I provided my secret
for brewing a high quality extract ale, using 7 #'s of Steinbart's
amber ale extract (or equivalent).  Two oz of one of the stronger hops
like Cascade work well, and a half-oz of Kent Goldings for finishing
leaves a good aroma.  NB:  this brew results in a chill haze, which I
don't pay any attention to, since I don't care (I don't wash my
windshield very often either.) about it.  I am so impressed with this
ale that I can't seem to make enough of it.  Mail me for details.


I echo Joseph's other comments about requesting pale ale recipes.  I
believe it is possible to make a good pale ale using extracts in place
of freshly mashed malted barley.  May I suggest adding to 2 gallons
water 1# of cracked crystal malt, 1/8# cracked roasted malted barley,
heat to boiling and remove the specialty grains when boiling
commences.  Add the extract (use 6# or more) and boil with two oz
strong hops for 30 minutes.  Boil finishing hops for last five
minutes.  This will result in a good pale ale, but not an excellent
pale ale.  It will lack sweetness and aroma.  Can anyone suggest how to
make it better?
