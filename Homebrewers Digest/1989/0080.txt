If there was a lot of froth, then it was fermenting fine. I suspect that
you didn't have a real great seal on the fermenter, so whatever CO2 was
coming out didn't have to go through the lock.  When you replaced the lid
after stirring you got a better seal.


I once did a lager that gave me no bubbles, and no head either, for over 
a week.  I was about ready to toss it, figuring if it hadn't started yet
it was sure to be contaminated.  A gravity check showed about a third of the
starting value, so it must have been fermenting slowly all along.

Have you used Saaz hops before?  These have an unusual musty flavor that
I haven't found in any other variety.  It is present in Pilsner Urquell
in spades.  My wife once likened this to the smell of manure, not to
attack it but rather to attempt to describe it.  There is a similarity.
(It tastes like horse shit, but in a pleasant way. ?!?)


Assuming, though, that it's not the Saaz hops, lets talk about I.M.
I've been meaning to ask about it myself.  I use it in my grain beers;
it's suppossed to improve the kettle break.  It's so cheap I use it
even though I'm not convinced that it's doing anything.  But if I felt
it were doing harm....
