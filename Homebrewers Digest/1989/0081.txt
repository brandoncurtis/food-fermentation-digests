Subject: What are the effects of light on my homebrew?


  Now that I have started to use a 6 gallon clear glass carboy for
secondary fermentation, I was wondering how my beer might be affected
by light.  I have heard that light is not good for beer, but I don't
know if that is sunlight or artificial light or whether it is direct
or ambient.  Could someone comment further on this?


Thanks,
         Wayne Boyer (jwb`at`mentor.cc.purdue.edu)

If you actually go into Mexico you will find that big lemons and
big limes we know are rare.  The small tart Mexican lime is mostly what
they have and they use it with tecate. There isn't even a separate
word for 'lemon' in Spanish.


Also the beer you get there is nothing like the import crap. 
Most beers are better down there than the same ones you can buy here.
There is an exception, Mexican Corona is not so good and the only people
that drink it are the stupid American students looking for a bargain.


You can still buy beer in quart glass returnable bottles and they are nice.
I have about fifty of them and only kegs are better to put homebrew into.
The cheapest way to get them is to buy the beer, drink it and bring
the bottles back with you. A case of 12 full quarts is about $6 if you stay
away form the tourist traps. Empty bottles are not a problem at the border like
full ones are. I have actually bought emptys at the distribudor. They think
you are crazy, but they haven't had homebrew. The most I have spent for a
case of 12 empty quarts is $2. If you can haggle in Spanish you can do better.  


I have never found the 5 gallon glass water bottles we all use, but I have
several that say 'hecho en Mexico' on the bottom. So I suspect if I look
hard enough I could find a bargain on those as well.
