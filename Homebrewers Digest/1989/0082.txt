You did the right thing.  There are tree things which suggest
themselves as possible reasons for the problem:
        (a) you didn't stir the yeast in when pitching
        (b) you hadn't gotten any oxygen in there before pitching
        (c) most likely: the top wasn't on there firmly, and the
        CO2 was leaking out around the edge.  CO2 is non-staining,
        so you might not notice.


Relax!  Don't worry.  {Have a homebrew,Be Happy}!

In hombrew digest 81, Jeff Hagen says:


>There is an exception, Mexican Corona is not so good and the only people
>that drink it are the stupid American students looking for a bargain.


At the risk of sounding like a stupid American student: When I was
down in Ixtapa, if you made a noise like "Corona Bard-eel," you would
get a Corona Barril which was an amberish beer in a short brown
bottle, and was pretty tasty.  I was surprised because I've always
referred to Corona as "Mexican Miller," and never cared for it before
that.  I still won't touch the regular Corona.  


Of course, the best way to get good beer in Mexico is to go down
around Christmas time and say "cerveza Navidad, por favor."


Take care,
brad

Just  to  set the record straight,  in Spanish,  "lime" is  "lima",  and
"lemon" is "limon" (with an  accent  on  the o),  so there is a separate
word  for  lemon.  What Jeff was probably thinking of is  the  Caribbean
colloquialism for "lima", which is "limon".  In fact, there are tropical
fruit  which have no name in English,  but do in Spanish.  For  example,
several varieties of banana  have  their  own names (these are also fine
sources of potassium, like beer!).


I would also like to say that I truly enjoy this digest.

In Homebrew #81 J. Wayne Boyer asks about light's effects on beer:


 >  Now that I have started to use a 6 gallon clear glass carboy for
 >secondary fermentation, I was wondering how my beer might be affected
 >by light.  I have heard that light is not good for beer, but I don't

Light makes beer skunky. Sunlight or artificial, direct or indirect, light
will have an effect on beer.  You should keep beer out of light as much
as possible. (As an experiment, to see the changes for yourself, place a
bottle of beer in strong light (to save time) and keep one in darkness.
Then try them side-by-side.)


Then, in the same issue, our resident linguist :-) Jeffrey R. Hagen suggests:
 >If you actually go into Mexico you will find that big lemons and
 >big limes we know are rare.  The small tart Mexican lime is mostly what
 >they have and they use it with tecate. There isn't even a separate
 >word for 'lemon' in Spanish.


In spanish the word for lemon is 'limon' with an accent above the 'o'. The
word for lime is 'lima'.  BTW, though not a botanist I know that not all
lemons are yellow nor limes green.
