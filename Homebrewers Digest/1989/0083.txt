I  store my beer in a refrigerator,  and it always tastes fine.  I guess
that proves once and for all that  the  little  light *does* go out when
you close the 'fridge door  8-).

I did not use Irish Moss in the beginning, and found that the brew
either was permanently hazy or took a very long time to clear.  Even
then it get would chill hazed.  Since I've started using Irish Moss the
problems have all but disappeared.  As a point of reference I do
partial grain brewing with extracts.  I only use about 1/4tsp. per 5
gallon batch and have not noticed much if any flavor changes.  This
may also be because I use it all the time now.  Also I've used as much
as a full tsp. from time to time.  Again with out noticeable flavor
changes.  Also I make sure it is *boiled* for at least 10 minutes and
usually not more than 15 minutes.  This will also minimize any added
'flavor' from the moss.  I've found it to be a big win over all.

I have recently seen advertisements about the new Miller "draft" beer.
I assume they identify "draft" with non-pastuerized.  What is the
proper meaning of "draft".  


BTW, is the Miller draft beer any better than the standard Miller?


Also,  what is "dry" beer that the Japanese seem to enjoy?
