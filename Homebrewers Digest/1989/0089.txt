Green glass blocks green light.

Damn. Got to disable my ^D key (instantly terminates and
sends mail with reversed meanings). Here is what I wanted
to type:


Green glass passes green light. And this is the most harmful?
So I suppose green is used because it looks pretty. Where
are my garbage bags! For that matter where is my barf bag!


I've got a batch of ale I'm not totally in love with. I think
I'll sacrifice a green (Beck's) bottle of it next to a brown
(standard longneck) one in direct sunlight for a 20 minutes
and compare these two with one kept out of the light altogether.
I'll report what I find out (after it stops raining here).

Me thinks that the 33 qt. "ceramic on steel" pots that homebrew shops sell
are identical to what are often called "Lobster Pots" (yep - for cooking
lobsters). I bought one about a year ago on sale from one of the local
discount houses for about $18.


Since I bought the big pot I've been doing full 5 gallon boils. I've
definitely noticed that I get better hop utilization, and quite frankly am
having trouble adjusting my recipies accordingly. Anybody know how to
quantify the increase in hop efficiency?

Hi.  "Traditional" is such a flexible word.  The traditional recipes
that I am familiar with are all 200 - 400 years old, and *all* suggest
adjusting the acidity--usually approximately 1/2 lemon squeezed into
one gallon of must--I think!  It could be 1/2 lemon to 5 gallons of
must--I shouldn't try to quote recipes without written sources
handy...


  The one modern book I have on Mead, which I am afraid I do not
remmeber the author of, recomends the addition of some nutrients
including some acid.  This is not to change the flavor of the mead,
but to keep the yeasties happy.


I will try to dig up some recipes and bring them in and post them.
