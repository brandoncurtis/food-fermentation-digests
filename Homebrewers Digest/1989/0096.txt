a.e.mossberg <aem`at`mthvax.miami.edu> posts a recipe:


> For a 5 gallon batch...


> 2 cans of Pilsner/Lager or American Light Malt
> 15 cups corn sugar
> 2 jars Lyle's Golden Syrup (22oz)
> 2.5 oz Hallertauer hops
> 2 lbs flaked maize
> 1 pkt BrewMagic.


Three questions --


        What is "Lyle's Golden Syrup"?
        What is "BrewMagic"?
        What type of beer is the resultant product?


I suppose the syrup is some sort of flavoring/sugar adjunct.  What is it,
and what character does it give the beer?


Based on the directions, I assume that BrewMagic contains diastatic enzymes
(natural or artifical?) which convert the corn starches into sugars.


What distinctive characteristics does "Killer Party Ale" have?  Is it a
Cream Ale, an IPA, an Old Ale, or a Barley Wine?  I would guess it is an
Old Ale, based on the Starting Gravity and hopping rate. 


As a suggestion to recipe posters, please describe any 'unusual'
ingredients when posting recipes.  Many shop brands are not available
everywhere, and we need to substitute!  Describe the resultant product --
tell us why we would want to make the recipe!

UNSUB
PLEASE UNSUBSCRIBE ME FROM THE HOMEBREW DIGEST.


I was printing the digests out for my brother, the brewer in the
family, but it's he now has access to bitnet on his own.


Keep up the good work!!!
