Greetings:


Spring is just around the corner (gee...what a pleasant thought!) and
I am about start brewing some lighter beers.  (Dark beer when it's
cold, light (colored) beer when it's warm....personal quirk of mine)
The lighter beers are going to force me to come to grips with an 
ongoing problem I've been having trying to get my beers (almost 
exclusivly English-style ales) to clear.  I brew most of my beer
with little or no corn sugar but usually from either canned or dry
extract.  The beer invariably contains visible suspended yeast
when I bottle it (7 to 12 days from initial pitch of yeast).  Within
one to two weeks, the beer will have cleared ALMOST entirely of 
yeast matter.  It usually seems clear until I hold it up next to a
bottle of commercial ale at which point it becomes apparent that it
is still somewhat dull colored.  It never gets any clearer than that.
Worse yet, when I chill the beer, it devlops a very decided chill
haze.


I've experimented with a variety of clarifying agents (papain enzyme,
polyclar, Irish moss, gelatin) but can't seem to get the right 
combination.  My question is:  Has anyone developed a generally
sure fire way to clear extract-based beers?  I know there are those
who beleive that somewhat cloudy beer is acceptable, but it's 
really important to me get it as clear as possible (another personal
quirk).  I'd be curious to hear about anyone's experiences regarding
this topic.

My current brewing practice is confined to reasonably 
sophisticated extracts. I use a lot of crystal malt, because
I really like the results. I usually add the grain along with or
shortly before the finishing hops, and occasionally I steep
them without letting them come to a boil.


My question is: does the added grain in fact go through a 
limited mashing process in the wort? I'm talking about careful 
addition, pre-boil or at the very end, not boiled to excess. 
If this is the case, I may talk myself into trying all-grain soon.
Thanks all in advance.

Thank-you for the review.  I've been wondering about this one and it
does look like one that would have lots of good stuff in it.  Again,
thanks for taking the time to submit this.

You beat me to it!  I am a regular customer of Beer and Wine Hobby and
their selection and service is the best I've had experience with.


I've tried other places.  One place I requested a catalog from and
haven't received it yet and another place I waited something like 4 or
5 weeks before my order arrived.


Beer and Wine Hobby has yet to let me down.  And they have just about
anything you want.  And the prices are very competitive.  You can call
them at (617)665-8442 for a catalog.  They also have a FAX number now,
so you can FAX them orders and requests.  Unfortunately, I left 
that at the house so I'll try and remember it and post it when I get
there.  


I'll keep it short today.
Enjoy,
Roger Locniskar

I believe The Home Brewery, outside of Fontana, carries Geordie.

I live in Northridge, you're welcome to give me a call either at

Subject: Brewing in Plastic


There has been some discussion recently regarding brewing in plastic
water-bottle carboys.  I've heard that these plastic carboys contain
potentially toxic compounds (plastisizers and other nasty chemicals) which
can be released into fermenting beer.  Apparently the acidity and the
alcohol in the wort cause the nasties to be released.  The carboys are FDA
approved for water only - presumably water does not cause the plastic to
release solvents.  The water-bottles here at work clearly state "Not to be
refilled with any other liquids - NSF approved for water only". 


I'm not sure if the release of solvents into beer is a real effect, or if
these stories are just a way the water companies try to reduce bottle
losses.  I'd play it safe, and not use them for fermenting beer.  If I did
use them for beer, I'd stick to low-alcohol batches, not the Barley Wines. 


On a similar topic, a collegue of mine has an interesting use for plastic
carboys.  He does large batches (30 gallon) of all-grain brewing, and does
NOT use a wort chiller.  He simply pours the boiling wort into plastic
carboys and puts foil over the neck.  He lets the wort cool for two days in
the plastic, causing the trub to drop out.  He then siphons the cooled,
trub-free wort into glass carboys, pitches his yeast, and starts
fermenting.  He does not sanitize his plastic carboys - he counts on the
boiling, sterile wort to clean everything.  All his fermentation is in 
glass.  This procedure is a bit unorthodox, but seems to work for him.  He 
has won several regional and national awards in competitions.
