Subject: KEG & CORKSCREW


On my way home from Wash DC yesterday I came across a very interesting ad
in American Airlines magazine for Keg & Corkscrew`s Personal Microbrewery&
Aside from being very curious about their "revolutionary, patented, sanitized
brewingag system for only $129.95",I was very surprised to see an ad 
for homebrewing an such a magazine!  Could it be that homebrewing might
becoming more popular?!  Has anyone ever heard of this outfit, or for that
matter, seen ads like this in magazines for a general kinda audience?


I have been a subscriber to the digest for several months now, but sorry
to say this is my first posting.  I REALLY ENJOY the info I get.  I will
try to find time to contribute more in the future.  Keep up the good work!
