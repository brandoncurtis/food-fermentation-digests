Subject:  liquid yeast sources, more on mead


Having taken the leap to all-grain brewing (for the most part) and
appreciated the improvement, I'm now ready to switch over to liquid yeast
cultures.  I ordered 3 different yeasts from a Canadian lab (the nearest to
me) over 4 weeks ago and have yet to receive anything!  I believe the company
is called 'MeC', or something similar (I'm at work).  Has anyone out there
dealt with this company?


I notice that several regular contributors use liquid yeasts.  What are your
experiences with what appears to be a growing number of liquid yeast
suppliers? What strains are you most satisfied with (I realize this is
largely a matter of taste, but I'll ask anyway)?


Thanks to everyone who responded to my questions about mead and pH.  If there
are any mead-makers in the lower Michigan, Chicago-Indiana area, I'd be
interested in swapping tastes to get an idea of whether my initial attempts
are in the direction, etc.  Who's out there?
