) [ on the problems of pitching directly into wort v. darkening
) effects of canned sterile wort used to start yeast ]
I don't think that I would attempt to pitch liquid yeast directly
into the 5 gallons; there is simply too much beer for too little
yeast.  The lag time would be too long (well, I prefer a lag time of
about 2 minutes before I can smell the CO\s-2\d2\u\s+2 and other
pleasant odours of fermentation).


I don't keep sterile wort on hand, either.  When I plan to make beer,
I sterilize a half-gallon glass vessel (the usual bleach-water) and
produce some boiled wort on the spot.  Use light-coloured DME, boil
it for a few minutes, cool it, and pour into the glass vessel.  Add
yeast to this.  Cover with clean saucer, or use sterilized plug &
bubbler.


I pitch the yeast, with wort, into the beer.


If I were really worried about keeping the colour light, and needed
canned wort, I might make a batch of sterile wort by mashing a couple
of pounds of pale lager malt, boiling the resultant barley-water, and
canning.  The DME wort is generally darker than from pale grain.

On lauter-tuns: I have one of those lautering bags, and it would
indeed be very handy \(em if I had a bucket with a spigot on the
side, so that I didn't have to remove the grain to pour off the
barley-water.  This is No Fun.  Until I get another large bucket into
which I can put a spigot, however, I am stuck with removing the grain
to pour off the barley-water.


For this reason, this past week I drilled about 300 holes in the
bottom of a smaller bucket which fits neatly into the large bucket.
It was far less painful to lift the grain to pour off the barley-water.


On hops: I always use one of those hops bags for pellets.  If I am
using more than one type of pellets, or inserting the same variety
at two points in the boil, I use more bags.  They're (a) dirt cheap
(b) easily cleaned after use with pellets.  Keep 4 in your beer-making
drawer.  That way you have a spare.
