Hi there, Rob!


How are you?


My VAX just got connected to INTERNET, as well as BITNET.  So I now have an
alternative e-mail address:  "CRF`at`GNV.IFAS.UFL.EDU".  If it would prove more
convenient to use this address to send me the 'Brew Digest, do.  Also, please
do me a favor and acknowledge receipt of this message; I'm trying to figure
out which addresses will work _via_ this upgrade.  Which, by the way, will be
why you may get this message twice.


Thanks!


                                Very truly yours,
