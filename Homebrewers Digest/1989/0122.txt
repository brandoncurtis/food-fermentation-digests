Where are you getting this number?  Noonan and Miller say commercial
pitching rates are .6 to 1.25 fl. oz. per gallon.  Five percent sounds
more like krausen, which is fermenting wort.  Three to six fluid ounces
is more yeast than most homebrewers provide, but is a far cry from a
quart.  Noonan describes various problems associated with overpitching--
though most homebrewers don't overpitch it can be done.

I have one of those.  It worked nicely the first two times, but the third
time I used it the yeast/trub drain valve leaked and bubbled air into the
beer.  The beer didn't spoil, but when I noticed this I had real trouble
not worrying.  I never did repitch drained yeast from this thing because
the timing was never right.  I like the BrewCap for the following reasons:
  1) you can get the last bit of the nasty trub out without racking.
  2) you can control how long the beer sits on the yeast, and how much
         yeast there is in the carboy.  This should help in diacytyl reduction.
  3) bottling is far easier using gravity directly than through a siphon.


I'll probably try to modify the drain mechanism to ensure that it doesn't
leak air--obviously I can't tolerate unsterile air getting into my fermenting
wort.


David Miller's yeast methods (written up in zymurgy last year) work nicely for
me.  I have had good success reculturing yeast from bottled beer.  I
also use his method for canning wort to use as a starter.  If I can get
2-4 batches from a $4.25 pack of yeast, I'm happy.  I don't want to
set up a microbiology lab at home.

Me too.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  And what about temperature?
I've seen recommendations to use 75 degF in the lager starter, but I'm
concerned about shocking the yeast and mutations when adding them to
the 50 deg. wort.  It seems more reasonable to ferment the starter at
the same temperature it will be pitched, or no more that 5 deg higher.

Happy birthday to me!  My wife gave me an old refrigerator.  She got it
for $2.20 at a sealed bid auction run by the county schools.  It works
fine, and holds up to 52 degF with no modifications.  I asked her why
she bid $2.20 instead of two dollars, and she said she wanted to outbid
any cheapskate who'd only go $2.00.  It's no thing of beauty, but I
hope it can help in the creation of some beautiful things.

Please unsubscribe me from the homebrew digest.  I have been too busy to
keep up with it on a regular basis, so it is just adding up storage
time.


Thank you,

Is there any truth the rumor that Boulder Beer was bought out by
Coors?
