Subject: BrewCo Boiler


I recently bought a BrewCo Boiler.  This is a mash-tun/boiler
whcih consists of a 7.5 gal plastic pail with a thermostat-
controlled heating element in the bottom.  I bought it so that I
could make hassel-free all-grain beer.  I assumed that the device
would come with complete instructions, but I felt there were gaps
in the information I was provided.  If someone has some
experience with these boilers (or similar appliances, would they
send me some successful guidelines for its use?  Specifically:


1.  The manufacturers indicate that grain:water ratios as much as
4 lbs grain: 1 gal water are NOT recommended with the BrewCo
Boiler.  I usually use 1 lb grain to 1 quart water.  What are
good alternative grain to water ratios?  1 lb grain to 1.5
quarts? 1 lb grain to 2 quarts?


2.  The manufacture also warns about scorching the grain at high
grain to water combinations, and recommend the use of a grain
bag.  Is this commonly done?  Does the bag/grain sit on the
element?  Do I have to fit in a false bottom?  Can scorching be
avoided merely by frequent stirring?


3.  I notice that the boiler has a "drum tap" on the side.  If I
use a grain bag and false bottom,  is it possible to sparge the
grain in the mash-tun?


Any recommendations will be greatly appreciated.

Where did I get that number? From wheel of fortune?


I did cross krausen beer pitching rates with yeast pitching rates. Sorry.
My point was simply that of all the things to be concerned with, over-
pitching should be at the bottom of the list. I should have pictured the
yeast cake size in the bottom of a fermenter before conjuring up that
stupid one quart figure.


>Me too.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  And what about temperature?


I keep my starters in the same spot where I do my fermentations so the
temps are very close.

Anybody know the status of a new book by Randy Mosher's called
"The Brewer's Workbook"? How about Dr. George Fix's "An Introduction
to Brewing Science"?

Hi there!


My VAX just got connected to INTERNET, as well as BITNET.  So I now have an 
alternative e-mail address:  "CRF`at`GNV.IFAS.UFL.EDU".  If it would prove more 
convenient to use this address to send me the 'Brew Digest, do.  Also, please 
do me a favor and acknowledge receipt of this message; I'm trying to figure 
out which addresses will work _via_ this upgrade.


Thanks!


                                Very truly yours,
