In all the discussion of this topic, don't forget that one of the primary
goals of the AHA in going to the Compuserve forum is to try to reach new
converts who haven't been exposed to home brewing. After all, most people
who learn about home brewing on Compuserve have money to invest in a new
hobby. Even if they "only" succeed in selling a bunch of membership/sub-
scriptions without converting new brewers, it will be profitable for them.
