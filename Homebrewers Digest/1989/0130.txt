Subject: Lecture on "fermentation in the Ancient World" in Boston


Saul Katz, an anthropologist from the University of Pennsylvania, will
be speaking on "Fermentation in the Ancient World" at a meeting of the
Culinary Historians of Boston, on April 18th at 7:00 pm.  The lecture
is free, a small donation to cover refreshments will be solicited.  If
you're interested, contact me, Michael Bergman, at (508) 870-0312
(10-6:30) or send me email.  As this is a small group, only the first
three respondents can attend (which is why I'm not posting the
location).  Personally, I doubt that that many of you will be
interested, free, and in the neighborhood, but I was asked to make
sure...


They'll be having another lecture on the topic, in a larger hall, and
I'll post more details as soon as I get them.  I'm not a member of the
group myself, a friend is.
