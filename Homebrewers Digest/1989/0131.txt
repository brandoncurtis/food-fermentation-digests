Oh, now that's quite an admirable goal. :-)

A year or so ago, I ran into a fellow at a party who was liberally pouring
his homebrew from 2-litre plastic pop bottles.  He identified it as an
"Australian-style amber ale", made from extract & grain, and it was
DAMN GOOD!  Not heavy or sweet, but with ample body; hoppy but not
too much, and very refreshing on a hot day.  Now that the weather's
turning hot and all I have in the cellar is heavy brown ale, I remember
that crisp brew fondly.  My questions:


1)  Is there really such a thing as an "Australian style" of ale, and
        how does it differ from other styles?


2)  Does anyone have any good "hot weather" ale recipes they're willing
        to share?


Much obliged.                                        - Martin

I have this batch o' wort that I made up last night.  I tried to culture
some yeast from some Sierra Nevada Pale Ale bottles, but, nothing happened.
I made a starter from some sterile wort I removed and cooled half way through
the boil.  3 bottles of Sierrra were emptied and the dregs swirled and added
to the cool wort.  45 Min later, Nothin, not even a bubble.  Not hampered
by the apparent lack of activity I went ahead and pitched the "starter"
anyway (3 Sierra Nevada Pale Ales in lew of dinner will unhamper you of much:-).


Well the questions are, 1) Will this eventually start?  If not should I just
pitch a packet of dry?  2) How can I culture some Sierra Nevada yeast (or any
other yeast for that matter) ?


Any other suggestions?  I tried dry hopping some pellets of cascade hops this
time (1/2 oz.).  Will they circulate enough to emit aromatics?  Do they need
to?  


Thanx for your help
