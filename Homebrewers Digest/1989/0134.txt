Subject: dividing hops?


Now that my hops have finally had enough time to establish themselves
(almost to a fault!:-), I'm wondering how to go about dividing and possibly
propagating them.  I've got two very healthy plants...in fact, I assume
they're doing well enough that I could share them with other people.  What
I need to know is how to separate a piece to give to someone else who would
like a hop plant, without either giving him just a piece of dead vegetable
matter or damaging my own plants )or both:-(.


I know that I bought my hops as hunks of roots--i.e., rhizomes.  How can I
create rhizomes for other folks?

I wasn't sure from Martin Lodahl's request for summer ales whether he was
interested in all-grain recipes or not, but here's a recipe for a pale ale
I've made recently which I really like and look forward to drinking more of
when the summer finally arrives in Michigan (now that I think of it, I'd
better make another batch to hold me over):


Pale ale  (5 gal.)


8 lbs pale malted barley (I used 2-row)
1 lb Munich malt
1/2 cup dextrin malt (I believe I ran out -- you could use more)
1 tsp. gypsum
20 grams Nuggets leaf hops (14% alpha acid content)
15 grams Bramblings leaf hops
pinch of powdered irish moss
1 pack Edme ale yeast


I used the standard temperature controlled mashing procedure in Papazians
Complete Joy of Homebrewing, with a 30 min. protein rest at 122 F., 20 min.
at 152 F and 20 min. at 158 F.  I sparged with 4 gal. 180 F water, boiled for
1 hour with the Nuggets hops (10 min. with irish moss), steeped the Brambling
hops for 15 minutes (NO BOILING!) and cooled the wort.  This ale is light in
color but full-bodied, with a hops bitterness and flavor that balances the
sweetness from the Munich malt.  If you really want an amber color, a cup of
caramel malt should do the trick.  I get a strong banana odor in most of my
ales (from the Edme yeast I believe) which subsides after about 2-3 weeks in
the bottle.  I'm starting to experiment with liquid strains to correct this,
so I'd go with your best ale yeast -- whatever you use.  I don't have the
specific gravities for this brew (I tend to forget things by the end of the
brewing session), but similar recipes routines start at about 1045 and finish
at 1015.  If you don't have the capacity for 9 lbs. of grain, I'm sure you
could substitute some extract for the pale malt.  Good brewing!


Just thinking about this makes me want to speed home and have a cool one  --
but I'd better get back to the thesis.
