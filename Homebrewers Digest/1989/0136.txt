As many of you have noticed I have not been active lately on this network.
Thats because I have been job hunting. I have found a new one in the Boston
area (hello WORT PROCESSORS) so I'll be dissappearing for a while. Please
remove me from this mailing list. If my new employer has internet access
I'll get in touch and re-appear. If not I'll try to get Mike F. to keep
me posted. It's been fun chatting with y'all. 
bye
- jay h.

I add 3 tsp gypsum to all my brews, in the brewing water.  It has cured
the lack of body in my case.
