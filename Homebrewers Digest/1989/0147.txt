Subject: "Hot" Fermentation (help!)


Another novice's question:  what should be done with a "hot"
fermentation?  Last Sunday, as I was brewing up my own
interpretation of Florianb's intriguing "summer ale" recipe from HBD
#132, the weather got steadily hotter.  By the time I pitched the
yeast, the coolest spot in the house (occupied, naturally, by the
carboy I use as a primary fermenter) was over 80 degrees F and
rising.  Not surprisingly the lag time was very short, and
fermentation was vigorous, to say the least.  By Tuesday morning
there was no perceptible bubbling from the blowoff tube, though this
may be due in part to the sudden drop in temperature that's expected
to be with us for the next few days.


What I presently plan to do is let it all sit just as it is (if I
were to open the fermenter, I doubt that enough additional carbon
dioxide would be generated to keep air off the beer) until Thursday,
when I'll rack and clarify, and then let it sit until the following
Tuesday, when I'll bottle.  I would prefer to bottle sooner, but
I'll be 500 miles away.  My questions:  Is that reasonable?  Why
not?  What's the best way to treat beer that's fermented too quickly?

Subject: two questions


        A little while ago, someone posted about an incredably bitter brew that


softened after some time in the bottle.  For him, in that case, it was a good


thing.  I seem to be experiencing the same effect, but with this batch it is


a problem.  I brewed a steam beer from DME and some crystal and toasted malts.


When it was young, ~1 week after bottling, it was good and bitter.  Now, almost


a month later, it seems to be softening.  Is this a common occurance, and is


there anything that can be done to keep the bitterness?


        Another question.  (I've always got lots of them.)  Is there reason 


brown sugar or normal white sugar wouldn't work for priming sugar?  I have been


using sugar from the place where I get malt, but I forgot to get some last 


time.  Now I have a batch in the carboy and am wondering if I can just bottle 


with what I have.


        Thanks for the help and keep brewing.

I knew when I saw the request that someone would post my index, so I waited,
figuring that the odds were about 50/50 that the new one would get posted.
Well, it wasn't, so here it is. I'm sorry to mail something this big, but
I tried to handle it by private mailing last time, and this is the easy way,
trust me. This new format for the index allows you to print it reduced on a
laser printer, or reduce it on a copy machine, and it will fit into the back
of the book. Enjoy. If the form-feeds get munged, you'll have to put them
back.

===========================================================================
 


      I have found that the piece of brewing equipment that I use most
     has been the book "The Complete Joy of Home Brewing" by Charlie
     Papazian.(ISBN 0-380-88369-4). The more I have used the book, the
     more I have wanted an index. Many times I have been certain that I
     read something applicable to a question at hand, and have been
     unable to find it in the book. I slowly put together this index, and
     offer it now to the brewing public. The author of the book has given
     permission for this to posted to the network.
      The ideal thing to do is to print this on a laser printer at a size
     that you can tuck into the back of the book. 
      The only promise I make regarding this index is that it is better
     than nothing. If you find any mistakes or exclusions, let me know.
