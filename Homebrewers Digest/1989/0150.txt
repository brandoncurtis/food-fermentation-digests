Subject: Growing hops, multiple sprouts


I've just started some hops growing from a rhizome, and one of
them has sent up several shoots.


I've read some growing advice which recommended pinching off all
but the healthiest sprout.  Well, I'm eager for as many plants
as I can get to grow.  Can I somehow separate the sprouts and
get several different plants, or do I run the risk of killing
off my one, guaranteed plant?


        Thanks!

In HB.DIG #149, Gregg TeHennepe asks about the danger of a hop or two
getting into the primary fermenter.  This is no problem at all.  Relax.
Read up on dry hopping in a (younger) homebrew book.


Pete Soper talks about increasing pH with boiling.  I interpret this as
a concentration of the alkaline ions.  I recommend stop boiling the water.
If you want to sterilize it, simply heat it to boiling.  Try acidifying
it with, say, citric acid.  Anyone have a better method?
