) This gentleman stated that he felt that single stage was better and
) the goal was to reduce the amount of trub formed.  He stated that if
) you limit your boil to 20 minutes their [sic] would not be as much
) chance for the protein to coagulate; thus less trub.
Ahem.  I beg to differ on short boil periods, even with extracts.
There are several things being accomplished with the boil.  One of
the most important is bringing out the hops; you want to get the oils
as well exposed to the water as you can.  A longer boil period allows
you to get a better hops flavour.  Adding your own hops of course
makes this argument even stronger.


By boiling the stuff, and racking as in a two-stage ferment, you get
rid of them.  When you rack (strongly advised: I always use the two
stage method, and get clear beer this way) you also get rid of a fair
load of dead yeast.  I rack again at bottling time, not bottling from
the carboy (with its own accumulation of dead yeast) but from a
bucket sterilized for the purpose.

Yes and no.  Yeasts which can withstand colder temperatures, the first of
which was discovered by Carlsberg (see elsewhere in HD#158), are what make
lagering necessary. These types of yeasts, which are now commonly called
lager yeasts, could ferment at colder temperatures and subsequently produce
less by-products such as esters.  This resulted in a beer flavor that we
associate with lager beer.  The colder temps required longer brewing
periods and the beer had to be stored (in german, lagered).  The only reason
I said no is that you could use lager (bottom fermenting) yeast at higher
(ale) temps and get good tasting beer - but it would not taste like lager.
Anchor Steam beer (San Francisco, CA) is brewed with lager yeast at warmer
(more ale-like) temperatures.

Subject: Introduction and a Few Questions


Hi Everyone


My name is Jim Somerville.  I have been brewing for about a year
now, my last batch being a dry malt powder and honey brew.  The
alcohol content is quite high >7% by my estimates.  Is this
normal for having started with 30% honey?  I have been drinking
it for a few days now, but the one I had last night had a strange
mouth feel, which can best be described as kind of gelatinously
slimy.  Any ideas as to what causes this?  I boiled the wort for
an hour as usual, and there was quite a lot of trub at the
bottom of the primary (I use 2 stage fermentation).  Could serving
temperature have anything to do with it?


My guess is that it is caused by the dry malt powder.  I have
noticed that some recipes call for dextrine malt.  Is it the
same stuff as "brewbody"?  The dry powder I used was not brewbody.


On the topic of sanitation, is it worth boiling the bottlecaps?


On the topic of yeast, should a person bother to add yeast
nutrient to an all malt batch?


If someone is keeping a canonical list of questions and answers,
please send it to me.


-Jim
