In HOMEBREW Digest #161, Mike Fertsch sez:

What a novel idea -- I've never considered the possibility of restaurants
getting Alzheimer's.  I don't think they're susceptible, though.

As I understand it, many cheap enamels contain lead.  So the problem is
the chips themselves.  No new enameled pots use lead-containing enamels.
As for aluminium, while the link has been rumoured for years, only recently
has data been available showing a correlation with high brain levels of 
aluminium and senile dementia/alzheimer's, and the legal machinery moves
slowly and laboriously.   


>Are our requirements that different from restaurants?  My feeling is that
>they are so I'll look around some more for a 8 gallon enameled steel pot. 


That's what I'd suggest.  I think I saw some in the William's Homebrewing 
catalogue, but any big department store should also have them.
