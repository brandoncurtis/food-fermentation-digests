Subject: Almost Old Faithfull


I have experienced something similar to the Old Faithful of
Tom Hotchkiss, but not as severe as he described.  That was
with a pale ale using all grain.  I have left the second stage
of fermentation for 2 months at about 15 degres Celcius (59F).
The yeast was an ale variety from Edme.  Primary fermentation
has been quite active for 2 days then drop sharply.  Secondary
fermentation was always very slow.  A relative density of 1.010
seemed high but I decided to bottle anyway. Two weeks after bottling,
carbonation was already quite high, but seems to have stabilized
after 4 weeks. 


Later, I brew a similar batch (with flaked corn) that shows a 
similar fermentation pattern until the temperature in the
appartment rose to about 23 C (73F).  During the 2 months period
of stage 2 fermentation at 15 C, only 1 bubble every 2 minutes
was visible.  But when temperature rose to 23 C, bubbles began
to shows in great numbers.


I think that even after 2 months, my batch of "almost Old Faithfull"
has been bottled but has not yet finished fermentation because 
of chilly yeast. The second batch is not yet ready to bottle. 
A batch made with malt extract using exactly the same kind of 
yeast don't shows such a strange behavior.


Next time, I think I will try to change yeast brand or variety 
(lager yeast to make ale?).  I dont't think contamination is the
cause.

Subject: Lager vs Steam:an experiment
Full-Name: Jason Goldman


I've just recently conducted an interesting experiment.  My most recent
batch of beer is a lager (J's Bock Cantata), the first I have tried.  My
basement, at the time of fermentation, stayed around 55 degrees, so that went
fine.  When it came time to bottle, things were warming up, so I fit a case
and a half into my bar refrigerator so I could lager the brew at 40 degrees.
The remainder I let age at room temperature (65 - 75 degrees).  This worked
out well for providing a comparison between lager and steam beers.  The lager
was significantly smoother than the steam (tho both are tasty).  The only
thing that I regret is that I underprimed the batch and it is not as
carbonated as I like (I don't want a geyser, but I like to get a little head
 ;-).

I have used Red Star in about 20 batches of ales and once in a steam
beer.  I have no complaints about it.  The brews have all had good
aroma (ie nothing moldy or wierd smelling).  Red Star gets going fast,
which I like.  I've read in a Steinbart's newsletter that Red Star ale
yeast has a relatively high concentration of bacteria and wild yeasts.
This apparently hasn't presented a problem for me.  I plan to continue
to use it for the convenience it affords me.

I highly recommend Miller's book "The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing".
I believe it is a more serious and scientific approach to homebrewing
than Papazain's book (although the recipes and tips in Papazain's book
are really great).      


David also asks:

A fellow at Steinbart's suggested I use lactose, which is supposed to
not ferment by yeast.  I bought some but haven't tried it yet. Saccharin
sounds like it would work because the bitterness could be masked by the
hops.  I will never use it, since I am a health nut.

Certainly there could be other factors, but in my experience, yeast quality
is a very important flavor consideration. I have had universally good luck
with Doric, Leigh&Williams, and Edme. Wyeast liquid lager yeast has worked
marvellously the one time I used it (but watch out - see below...)
Some kits provide wickedly pleasant yeasts - Dogbolter in particularly has
one of the sweetest-smelling yeasts around. Try an A-B comparison,
substituting Doric for Red Star. When I did that I gave up Red Star forever.

I have found that adding healthy quantities of crystal malt can have a nice
sweetening effect on amber ales, though I haven't got a lot of scientific
evidence to back this up.

The worst-smelling fermentation I ever achieved was with Wyeast liquid lager
yeast, which produced a beautiful-tasting lager. Go figure it.

Sign of a true megastout. Mine did the same. Still does it to me every
time I drink one of the things...

In Digest #166, Martha Garske explained how to adjust an S.G. reading
to account for more water that has been added:


> Since  water has an S.G.
> of 1.000 ( it is, in fact, the reference for the specific gravity scale)
> multiplying the S.G. obtained for the 2 gallons by 0.4  is exactly the

I'd like to add a small clarification to this, just in case it's not
obvious to everybody.  You have to subtract out the 1.000 from the S.G.
reading first, then multiply by 0.4 (or whatever the ratio of volumes
is), then add the 1.000 back in.


So, for example, if the measured S.G. of the 2 gallons was 1.100, you
would multiply 0.100 by 0.4 to get 0.040, yielding a corrected S.G. of
1.040.


If any of you have doubts about this, consider the case where it's all
water:  the original and corrected S.G. readings should both be 1.000.
