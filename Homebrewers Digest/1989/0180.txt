I believe that HBU (Homebrew Bittering Units) are based on 
five gallon batches.  Thus, if you have a recipe that calls
for 10 HBU and is for a five gallon batch, you can use
2 ounces of 5% alpha acid hops or 1 ounce of 10% alpha acid
hops, etc.  On the other hand, if you are making a 7 gallon
batch, you would need 14/5 or 2 4/5 ounces of 5% AA hops or
7/5 or 1 2/5 ounces of 10% AA hops or 2 ounces of 7% AA hops,
etc.


Although I've never tried making a fruit beer, I've read that
you don't want to boil the fruit, just sanitize it.  180 degrees
is sufficient to kill most bacteria and wild yeasts, so I would
suggest steeping the fruit in the wort after the boil.  


Roger: I'm curious as to why putting anything in your beer
on the second or third day of the ferment would keep you
from getting a bacterial infection or starting a wild yeast
in your brew.  Granted, your yeast has a big lead on the 
new "diner," but I would still rather sanitize anything
I put in my beer whenever the beer is below 180 degrees
and not even THINK about worrying.


Al.
