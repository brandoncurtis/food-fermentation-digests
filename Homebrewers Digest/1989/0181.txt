Subject: Temperatures higher than 70 F


I live in Oklahoma, where the temperatures in the summertime can get up into
the 90s (at least).  My apartment usually stays somewhere in the mid 80s.


(Although the weather this week has been atypical.  The temperatures have
been in the 70s).


I refer to the earlier article about higher temperatures causing incomplete
fermentation and hence excess CO2 production in the bottles (delayed
fermentation?) and hence explosions (scary thing to happen).


Assuming that I use two stage fermentation (first stage in a food-grade
plastic pail, because its easier to check temperature, etc, and second
stage in the glass carboy with the gas-lock), at which stage is a lower 
temperature more crucial?  I was thinking of putting the chamber on top of
one of those boxes that milk comes in, and putting that in some sort of 
container and then putting water/ice in it so as to cool the air by
evaporation.
