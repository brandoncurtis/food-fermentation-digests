The AHA National Conference and Competition was held two weeks ago.  From 
the little I heard on the net, the conference was pretty good.  I'm glad to 
see that the conference has moved away from Denver, and will travel from 
region to region.  Has anyone out there written a 'trip report' or summary of 
the conference?  I think posting it would be interesting for those of us 
who couldn't make Fort Mitchell.  Was Kathy Ireland there as advertised?


With regard to the competition, does anyone have a list of winners from 
this year's national?  Frankly, I'm a little frustrated about the 
competition.  I think first round judging leaves room for improvement.  
Before I start flaming, I would like to see who this year's winners are.  
Can anyone post (or e-mail to me) a list of winners?

Subject: Wine Yeast for Imperial Stout?


At a beer-tasting earlier in the week, I sampled Grant's Imperial Stout.
I loved it -- just the thing, I imagine, for a cold winter's evening.
That gave me the itch to try making a batch of it for Christmas '90,
so I checked Dave Miller's marvelous TCHoHB for a recipe.  He gives one
that looks interesting, but recommends using "wine yeast".  Okay,
fine; but what KIND of wine yeast?  Pasteur Champagne?  Or perhaps
one of the (many) yeasts customarily used with still wines?  Has
anyone out there tried this before?  I welcome your opinions!
