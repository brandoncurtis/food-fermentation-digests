Subject: Beginning mashing & water filters


I have been thinking about getting into all-grain brewing for a while, but 
haven't done anything about it.  The most recent issue of Zymurgy has an
article on mashing using the single-step infusion method and a cooler.  For all
you grain brewers out there - Does this seem a good beginner method to you ?
Also, the author uses a brew-boiler.  Is this needed ?  Or could I heat the 
water in my kettle ?  I guess the brew-boiler is better in that the spigot 
can regulate the flow.  Any ideas on doing this with a kettle.?
I guess I'd need a wort chiller now, too.


Any other pointers for the first-time masher are also welcome.


Another comment about the most recent Zymurgy:
I was a little overcome by the ads for water filters and articles on water
in general.  Don't get me wrong.  The Miller article on water treatment was
facinating, but the full-page water filter ads were a little much, especially
combined with the reverse-osmosis article.  I got confused as to which article
the ads were aimed at.  Anyone concur ?

Subject: Wanted: wheat beer recipes




While my first batch of beer ever bubbles and ferments
happily, I've been thinking about what to brew next.


Does anyone out there have a good recipe for wheat beer?
I've grown partial to Pinkus Weizen (sp?) lately and would
love to brew something similar.


Thanks.

Subject: Thanks!


Oh, what have I wrought?  Thanks to all who've supplied my missing Digests,
and especially to Jim Bauer, Mike Kahn, and Joshua Glasser (Win, Place,
and Show, respectively).  The instant and huge response to my request
is extremely heartening!  Homebrewers certainly are a helpful bunch, aren't
they?  Thanks again to all.                                - Martin

Subject: Label Images Wanted


Hello Homebrewers,


After my seventh batch of homebrew I wish to make some labels for my
homebrew, and use the various painting programs on my computer. 


The problem is, none of these programs have any pictures of barley or hops or
beer-like things.  


So, would anybody have some "beer" images, icons,  etc. they'd like to send
me, or even examples of labels you have made with your computers.
(I can decode and convert to just about any standard format, gif: sun-raster,
tif or even raw.) Please uuencode them.
I'd also like to get a hold of some nice big old fashioned looking fonts.


Also, what kind of information do you folks like to put on the label.
Here's what I'm including: name of my beer, type of beer, month/year made, 
and batch number.  Anything else come to mind?


What is the best way to get old labels and foil off?


Thanks, 
John

Does anyone know what the homebrewing laws are in Canada?
I will be moving to Toronto soon and would like to continue
my homebrewing up there.

Subject: Interesting Ingredients


  In HBD #174, I posted a request for information about "interesting
ingredients", in other words, anything besides malt, hops and yeast.
I promised to summarize and well ... I only got two responses.  Before 
I summarized, I decided to repost in the hopes that there were some 
of you who decided to wait for someone else respond (I can't believe
that only 2/400 of you have tried anything creative in your beer).


  I'm looking for accounts of any such experiences (maybe I wasn't so
clear about that in my original posting):


***************
  All this talk about different ingredients has brought up several examples
about which I know very little (my only references being Papazian's and
Birch's books):


   yarrow
   cardamom
   woodruff
   honey
   raspberries
   etc.


  Papazian has covered cherries, ginger, cinnamon plus various others
that were not mentioned.


  I'm interested in three things about these ingredients in beer:


   1 - What type of beer they are good in.
   
   2 - Approxamately how much and when they should be added.
 
   3 - What their affect is.


  Any comments from those of you who have tried these or ANY other interesting
ingredients would be greatly appreciated (I know there must be A LOT of 
creative homebrewers out there ;-)  Please respond by e-mail, and I will
summarize.
