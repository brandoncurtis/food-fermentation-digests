Subject:  pyment recipe


Dave Sheehy mmentioned that local beekeeper's are interested in our attempts
at mead.  I've found the same to be true -- a promise of a bottle of the
finished products often results in a nice discount!  He also requested a
recipe for the Riesling pyment I mentioned a few weeks back.  Sorry to
tantalize without more info (mea culpa):


Riesling Pyment (5 gal.)


4.5 lb. wildflower honey
5.5 lb. partial blueberry honey
2 T. acid blend
1 T. pectic enzyme
4 lb. can Alexander's Johanissberg Riesling extract
1 pack Red Star Champagne yeast


Methods:  From what I can decipher I boiled this in a small amount of water,
probably for 1 hour.  [I have learned since, first from "Ye olde batte" whose
experience I respect, that meads should not be boiled lest the aromatics of
the honey be driven off -- This makes a lot of sense to me.  My last effort
was held at pasteurizing temps (180-200) for about 2 hours rather than
boiled.]  I transfered to the secondary after 8 days and bottled after about
4 months.  As I said this is more winey than your straight mead, but very
pleasant.  Medium dry and spritzig -- very nice as a table wine.  Those of
you set up to crush your own grapes might try a grape/honey mix sometime. A
drink of noble history!  I'd be interested to hear of anyone's attempts at a
cyser (a fermented honey/apple cider mix).


As far as collaborating, I'm willing to hold a "official mead tasting" in
my home (according to local laws) if people would be interested in exchanging
some mead samples.  Contact me via E-mail.

P.S.  PTGARVIN, did you get my e-mail regarding yarrow?

Subject: removing labels


I've found the best way to remove old labels (and yes, even foil)
is to soak the *OUTSIDES* of the bottles in a washing soda 
(Sodium Carbonate) solution.  I use about 1/4 cup in about 6 gallons
of hot water.  The reason that I stress "outsides" is because I once 
left a sink full of bottles and washing soda solution overnight and
got a white sediment stuck to the glass (both inside and out).
I managed to remove the sediment with lemon juice, but since then
I just stand water-filled bottles in washing soda solution.

Subject: Wheat Beers


I'm am told by my mashing friends that wheat beers are somewhat difficult
to make because of the behavior of the wheat compared to malted barley.
(feel free to expand on this or contradict it as you see fit.)


If you're an extractor, I think there are only two available brands of
wheat extract. Ireks I think makes some (or is it the other German extract?)
and William's hombrew sells some of their own. The Homebrewery includes
some wheat with their Yellow Dog Extract, but not enough for a true wheat
beer.


William's also sells a liquid yeast pouch (made by Wyeast?) which they say
is made up of two strains of yeast to give the beer the authentic southern
Germany taste. (Whatever that means.) Dave Miller lists another German
lab culture which he recommends for Weizen beer. I'd need to check on that.


I've tried William's Weizen beer kit and it turned out fairly well as a 
dunkel weizen. If you want their address send me a note at
lsmith`at`umn-cs.cs.umn.edu. Their extract comes in 6 lb boiling bags. Their
kits include malt, yeast, and pellet hops (bittering and finishing). Their
prices seem high on some items but they'll ship it free if you're on the
West coast so maybe it balances out.


And don't forget to drink that Schell's award winning wheat beer when you're
in or around Minnesota!
