Subject: Siphoning


When siphoning my brews, I've gotten the flow started by sucking on
the end of the hoze (after rinsing my mouth with whiskey).  I've 
never had a problem with contamination.  However, I often wonder if
there isn't a better way to do this.  I have tried filling the hoze
with water first, but this seems like a silly thing to do: expose
the brew to fresh water.  I don't think bleach solution is the    
solution either.


Does anyone have a better idea on how to get the flow started when
siphoning?

Subject:      Precipitate in wort.


I recently brewed up a 3 gallon batch of wort which I plan to use as a
yeast starter for liquid yeasts.   I used a can of John Bull Light Malt
Extract (hopped) dilluted to 3 gallons.  I brought this to a boil in my
stainless steel stock pot and maintained a rolling boil for about a
half hour.  I noticed that the wort darkened somewhat during this process,
but did not pay much attention to it.  I transfer the hot wort to one
quart canning jars and placed them into a pressure cooker.  I maintained
the pressure cooker at 10 psi for about 30 minutes.  When I removed the
jars from the cooker, I noticed that the wort was VERY dark and a light,
fluffy precipitate had formed in the bottom of the jars.


My questions are,


 - Why did the wort darken from an amber color to a dark color?  Is this
   normal?  Personally, I prefer dark beers, but I am a little curious as
   to why there should be such a pronounced change in color.


 - What is the precipitate that has formed in the bottom of the jars?  I had
   placed a small amount of vivegar in the water in the bottom of the pressure
   cooker to prevent water stains (or so the instruction manual advised),
   and I suppose it is possible that some of the vinegar vapor could have made
   it's way into the jars, but that seems a little unlikely to me.  I had
   originally planned on using an unhopped malt extract in this batch, but
   after checking on my supplies, all I had was hopped extract.  Could this
   explain the precipitate?


I am going to go ahead an use one of the jars of wort as a starter for some
Wyeast and brew up a batch of Irish Ale and see what happens.  I had planned
on getting a yeast bank kit and preserve some of the starter culture for later
use, but now I just want to see if the starter wort is contaminated.


If anyone has any suggestions/explainations for what happened, I would be
interested in hearing them.  Thanks.

Subject: Cyser


Jackie Brown asked if anyone has made cyser. I made a one gallon
"experimental" batch last fall with very good results. My second batch (5
gallons) is settling out in a carboy as we speak.


I don't have the recipe here at work, but here are some comments. I made up
my own recipe, starting with apple cider that contained no preservatves.
Using that as a base, I added honey until the specific gravity reached the
approximate SG of grape juice (I wanted the cyser to have about the same
amount of alcohol as wine). I then added potassium metabisulfate to the
honey/cider mixture to kill any wild yeast. After letting the must sit for
a couple days, I added two packages of Red Star Champagne yeast and let
nature take it's course.


The first batch turned out semi-dry, with a definite apple flavor (though
not sweet). With age the sharp apple flavor turned rather smooth. Very
nice, I think. I racked the second batch a couple weeks ago (tasting it in
the process), and it's coming along fine.


I can provide specifics about my recipe if anyone is interested. Note,
though, that it's very easy to make up your own recipes. I'm sure that
there are purists who will say that I cheated by using wine as a model for
my experiments, but that's how it goes.
