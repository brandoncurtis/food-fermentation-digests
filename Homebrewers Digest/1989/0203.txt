In HOMEBREW Digest #202, att!iwtio!korz`at`hplabs.HP.COM sez:

It's cane sugar that adds a cidery taste, not corn sugar.

Subject: Grapvine Brewery Anniversary


Thanks to all those who responded to my query about breweries and brewpubs to 
visit in Northern California and Oregon.


In my own neck of the woods, Grapevine Brewery in Lebec, California will be
having their anniversary celebration on July 29.  It should be a lot of fun. 
I was just there last weekend and had a chance to sample the Special Lager,
Summerfest Lager, and Extra Special Bitters (there were 3 of us).  They were
all very good, but we decided the ESB was the best of the three.  There were
also Mild Ale, American Lager, and Stout.  I sampled The Mild Ale, but it had
a winey taste and I sent it back.  The cause of winey aroma and flavor that I
am familier with is too much oxidation of the beer.  They usually have 6
locally brewed beers on tap and they also serve good food. They are located
off Interstate 5 at the Frazier Park exit. The general location is the Tejon
Pass 50 miles North of Los Angeles and 40 miles South of Bakersfield. 


See you there!


David

Subject: Reynolds Aluminum Tapper


I just received a Reynolds Alumunum Tapper keg from a friend.  It held 2&1/4 
gallons of Falstaff Draft Beer and says to return for deposit.  I would like 
to know if anyone has tried to refill these, and if so, how?  It is meant to 
lay on its side and has a tap in the center of the top.  It does not have any 
provision for putting hoses on it, so it must be pre-pressurized in the
brewery.  I could probably fill it and use the secondary fermentation to 
pressurize it.  Thanks.


David

Immediately after Paul posted this, my latest batch was ready for
tasting, and I was in a similar pickle.  My recipe & process are
strikingly different from Paul's, but I too have produced a beer
that leaves me thirsty!  The recipe, from memory:


        3 lbs. bulk "light Scottish" malt extract
        3 lbs. 2-row pale malt
        9 AAU Kent Golding hops
        Edme yeast*
        Finings:  1 tsp gelatin and 1 oz PolyClar-AT
        Priming:  1 cup corn sugar


I used the "small scale mash" procedure in Miller's "CHoHB", and was
careful about the temperatures.  My sparging procedure could very
well be at fault, though:  my improvised lauter tun consists of a
large colander lined with a nylon straining cloth, and I ladled all
the mash through it, which left more than a little of the cloudy
wort in the boiler.  I then poured it all back through the grain and
into a catch pail, then back through the grain again and into the
boiler.  Only then did I rinse the grain with the sparge water.  Is
that too much hot wort/water on the grain?  Could that be where the
astringent dryness came from?


Another suspect is the yeast.  I previously made a batch using
almost exactly the same recipe.  The sparge was handled much
differently, and with my equipment, required more than 2 hands (ergo
the change this last time).  The largest change from that batch was
the yeast:  that time, I used Red Star Ale yeast, which was
altogether too fruity for my taste.  This seems to be the opposite! 
I can't taste the malt at all!  I've previously only used Edme with
dark beers, and have gotten results I liked.  Is it too attenuative
for the light malts I was using?


Another possible culprit is the heat:  in the 70's at pitching,
rising rapidly into the 90's through primary fermentation (ambient
room temp.  The carboy was swathed in wet towels in a tub of cold
water, with a fan on it at all times), tapering into the 80's during
secondary.

It's my understanding that most of the meaningful in-bottle changes
will either take place more slowly or not at all if the beer is
chilled.  So if you're hoping (as I am with mine) that a little age
will take the "edge" off of it, leave it at (cool) room temperature.
