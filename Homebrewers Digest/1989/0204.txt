As I recall (it's been about ten years), these type of kegs are gravity
feed. The beer tends to oxidize and go flat very quickyly. I wouldn't use
one for homebrew unless I expected to drink the entire contents in one day.

Corn sugar most certainly *does* add a cidery flavor.  It may be true that
cane sugar is worse (I've never used cane sugar in beer).  But the cider
flavor from corn sugar is unmistakable and quite objectionable.  It ages
out partially after 3-4 months, but even then it can still be noticed.

Subject: Lager question


Here's one for the lager experts.  Recently, I rigged up an old          
refridgerator for use in making lager. I made up a batch of pilsner
and used the two-stage fermentation process.  Using Red Star lager
yeast (I know, I know), the krausen fell after three days, and 
I transferred it to the secondary.  The og=1.040.  Upon transfer,
the sg=1.012.  The fermentation has fallen to a low, low rate,
with bubbles every 100 seconds, almost no visible bubbles rising
in the brew, and the sg=1.010 after three days in the secondary.


It was my understanding that lagers should sit in the carboy for
at least a month.  This brew, however, looks as if it's ready to
bottle and age.  I have noticed a quick fermentation in the past
using Red Star lager yeast for steam beer.  The product was quite
good however.


What would you recommend--bottling or further aging in the carboy?
Thanks.

In HB.DIG #203, aem says:

I disagree, and I've done batches to investigate it.  Corn sugar will 
produce a dry, cidery taste in beers when amounts as little as one
pound have been used in a five-gallon batch.  As "Al" pointed out in
Digest #202, substitution of normalized amounts of dry malt extract
should correct the problem.

My procedure is similar to yours for partial mashing.  I don't think
there is a large danger in extracting tannins in your procedure.

I'm going to guess that the problem is a combination of more attenuative
yeast acting at a higher temperature.
