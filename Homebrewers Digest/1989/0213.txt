Just as a data point, I've taken homebrew as carry-on at least 4 or 5
times.  There's never been any hassle with the security people.
Sometimes they ask what it is, because on their X-ray screen an upright
six-pack looks like six quarters floating in midair.  I just tell them
it is beer, and they say OK, and that's that.


A bottle of something doesn't seem very threatening to me, as long as it
*obviously* has no detonation device.  (Don't pack your homebrew into
the body of a radio, for instance.)


One of the security people even told me about some guy from Japan who
had come through a few days before with two cases of Coors to take back
home with him.  (Americans are worried about being taken over by these
people??? ;-)


I've never tried carrying beer onto an international flight, but I might
give it a go soon.  I'll let you know how that works out.

I have noticed quite a few people mentioning that when using whole
grain malts, (crystal, chocolate, etc.)  that they should not be
boiled, only steeped.  Where does this fit into the brewing process?
What is the proper "steeping" temperature. And, most importantly, why
not boil?


                               Thanx in advance,
                                     Drew
