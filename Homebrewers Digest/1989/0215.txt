Subject: Re: Why not to boil grains


It's true that boiling grains is not generally advised.  However, the
practice mentioned in the most recently arrived issue of the digest
(take hot water off stove and steep) is not the easiest way to do
the job.


I drop the grain bag in the water as it is heating, jostle and annoy
it to assure good extraction, and pull it out when the water starts
to boil.  Same procedure is used when adding crushed grains to wort
for an all-grain brew: I don't mash the un-mashables, but just soak
them in the wort until it boils.


Hint for people who don't like the flavour of burnt nylon: tie the
grain bag to the handle of the kettle so that it doesn't touch the
bottom.

It's fairly warm today (96 in the shade, according to the
thermometer), and I've foolishly been out working on my property
clearing away briars, watering the new limes and grapefruits, and
generally working up a sweat.


I got back home, pulled out the first bottle of #26, the yellow dog
beer which started a few weeks ago.  Good stuff.  Two cans of yellow
dog, with three pounds of crystal, made a very refreshing beer.  I
used bullion for the whole boil, and hallertaur for the last
half-hour or so.  Next time I'll add a bit more hops at the end to
increase the aroma; I like a nice, hoppy beer.


Advice: it's a good deal.  For the money (less than $8/can), you
can't go wrong.  Shipping & COD charges will raise the price a lot,
so you may want to buy a case and let them pay the charges.  Even at
two cans/batch it's still cheaper than buying beer, and of course we
all have opinions about store-bought beer anyway.
