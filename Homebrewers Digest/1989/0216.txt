Subject: Question about brands of dry yeast 


Despite the preference for liquid yeasts expressed by several posters
(at least several), it seems that some net subscribers use dry yeast.
I do, so far at least, for much the same reasons that Florian Bell cited
recently.


I just made my first batch with Edme yeast - had used Red Star previously.
I also picked up some "Doric" (?) at my local brew shop (which is closing
temporarily - big inconvenience, but maybe being forced to explore some
other supply channels will turn out to have a silver lining.) I'd like to
see comments from other experienced brewers besides Florian about the
characteristics of various dry yeast brands. thanks.
