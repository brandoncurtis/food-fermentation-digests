I used quite a few IBC bottles for my first batch.  I had no
problems with capping, aging, or drinking.  Highly recommended.


The only drawback about IBC bottles is that, after you spend tens
of thousands designing and printing your custom labels, it's hard
to fit them on the bottle over the giant IBC logo cut into the
glass.


Happy Bottling!

A user on our local Bulletin Board has the following request:

Subj: Oktoberfest beer, anyone
From: David Smith                    To:   All
I just got a brewing fridge and a temperature controller from Williams and I 
want to try an Oktoberfest for my first lager.
BTW I'm an extract brewer (with adjuncts, of course).


 In trade, here is my porter (modified from Papazian's Sparrow Hawk)
 which won at this year's Santa Clara Co. Fair:
        3.3 lbs John Bull dark extract
        3.6 lbs light Australian dry malt
        1 lb black patent malt (crushed coarsly in mortar and pestle)
        2 oz whole Cascade hops
        1/2 oz whole Tettnanger hops
        1 oz whole Tettnanger hops (finishing)
        1 pkg Edme ale yeast
Add crushed black patent to 1 1/2 gal cold water, bring to boil, boil 10
minutes and strain out malt.  Add extract and dry malt and Cascade and
1/2 oz Tettnanger hops.  Boil 60 minutes. Add finishing hops and boil 1
minute.  Turn off heat and steep 1-2 min. more. Sparge into 3 1/2 gal.
cold water.  Cool and pitch yeast. Starting gravity 1.056 at 60 F.
Finishing gravity 1.024 Bottled with 3/4 C. corn sugar boiled in 1 pint
water.


I will post any responses to the board, thanks for the help.

Hi, all!


Regarding IBC root beer bottles:  I use 'em all the time, and think they're 
great.  I had one brew that was **OVERCARBONATED!!**, all in IBC bottles, and
only 2 or 3 of them went boom.


As to your concerns about explosions:  covering your bottles with a towel 
ought to do it, if they're not enclosed in a cardboard box.  I've had a couple 
of bottles blow while inside a cardboard case (my very first batch ever), and 
all the glass was contained.


On the whole, though:  relax, don't worry... well, you know the rest!  :-)


Yours in Carbonation,
