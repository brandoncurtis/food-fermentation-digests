I've seen several people commenting in this digest recently about
growing their own hops.  I've recently bought a house, and am in the
process of landscaping my weed-filled yard.  I was hoping some
enlightened hops farmers out there could give me some more information
about growing them.  


Specifically, what type of conditions do I need to grow hops?  I live in
Sonoma County, California (50 miles north of San Francisco).  We have
standard warm and dry California summers with cool nights, and heavy
clay soil.  Also, what do you think about hops as far as a landscaping
plant - is it something you'd want in your back yard?  And finally, I'd
like to find a source for brewing-quality hops.


Thanks in advance for your help.  Any information or pointers to other
sources would be appreciated.

I second the motion to visit the Goose Island Brewery in Chicago.  To my
taste, it has the best brews in town.  However, the food isn't very good.
BTW, it's located at 1800 N Clyborn (Just north of North Ave. at the corner
of Willow, Sheffield, and Clyborn).  Monday nights are Lager Nights and
Tuesdays are Ale Nights.  The special prices are $1.50 a pint.  Usually
everything is $3.00.  In addition to their regular Ale and Lager, they
also have a regular Pils and two or three specialty brews that change
with the seasons.


I haven't been to Sieben's in over a year.  It was way too much the yuppie
place to be, the beers were always too sweet, and the food was bad.


The third place I know of is Tap and Growler.  This place has some good beer,
but wasn't very consistent.  The food was the best of the three.  They also
sell other brands of bottled beer.  They're at 901 W. Jackson.


Outside of Chicago there is The Weinkeller.  It has been a specialty beer
bar for a long time boasting the largest beer selection in the world.  They
say they have over 500 kinds of beer, but I've never counted :-).  Recently
they started brewing they're own.  I've had their pale ale, and root beer.
Both were very tasty.  The Weinkeller is located on Roosevelt Rd. in Berwyn.


There is also a micro-brewery somewhere in Elmhurst.  I don't think they
have a pub, so you'll have to look for their beer at the bars in Chicago.
I wish I could remember the name.  I had their beer at a party, so I know
you can order kegs.

Beer Judge Certification Program Exam


Weston, Connecticut
August 27, 1989 (Sunday)
2:00 PM


Contact:
Pat Baker
(203) 356-2779
(203) 227-8028


As this is the first exam I have posted to the net, some introduction
is in order.


The purpose of the judge program is to recognize homebrewers and beer
connoisseurs who have a thorough understanding of the brewing process,
the flavor components in beer, and the characteristics and historical
development of the different world beer styles.  The program is sponsored
by the AHA and the Home Wine and Beer Trade Association.


There are five levels of certification Recognized, Certified, National,
Master and Honorary Master Judge.  Placement in the levels is determined
by exam performance and experience points.  Experience points are earned
through efforts at a competition sanctioned by either the AHA or the HWBTA.


The three hour written exam is given in two distinct parts: the essay and
the taste section.  The essay portion, worth 70 percent of the final score,
is designed to determine an individual's overall knowledge of beer.  The
taste portion will be given concurrently with the written part of the exam.
Each candidate will judge up to four beers as if they were entered in a
competition.


Upon certification, judges will receive a handsome certificate, and a
wallet-sized card.  Recognized and Certified Judges may also purchase a
cloisonne pin denoting there status.  In 1988 and 1989 Edme Malt Company
sponsored silver pins for our National Judges and gold pins for Master
Judges.


Names and addresses of judges in the program are made available to
organizers of sanctioned competitions.  Organizers then invite these judges
to judge in the sanctioned competition.


Full details on the program are contained in a booklet that can be requested
by sending a postal address to: att!drutx!homer, or AHA, PO Box 287, Boulder,
CO 80306.  Attn: BJCP Administrator

    I am moving to Houston for the rest of the year. Does anyone know of
any homebrew supply shops or brewpubs in the area?


    Thanks - Jerry Burch

Ah! Someone else who wishes to make Mackey. It took me three tries,
but I finally got a batch that was closer to the original Mackeson
sweet stout than I could have hoped for. IT WAS WONDERFUL! Here's the
recipe: 


7# of Australian Light Syrup (From Great Fermentations in Seattle)
1# Chocolate, cracked
1 1/2# Black Patent, not cracked
12 oz crystal, cracked
12 oz lactose (Again, from Great Fermentations: a good supply house)
2 oz Kent Goldings whole hops
1 tsp salt
1 tsp citric acid
2 1/2 tsp nutrient (Yep, Great Fermentations)


I brought the wort to a boil (water & syrup to make about 3 gallons),
then added the crystal. I boiled for about 10 minutes, then added the
hops. Boiled for about 5 minutes, turned the heat off & added the
chocolate & black patent in a grain bag and let it steep for about 10
minutes. I then sparged the grain bag with ~2 gallons of boiling
water. Finally, I added the lactose.


The start S.G. was 1.057, which translates to a potential alcohol of
7.8 percent. The end S.G. was 1.022 prior to kegging, (I use those 5
gallon stainless steel kegs that they use to distribute coke syrup to
snack bars) six weeks after the boil. The 1.022 S.G. meant a residual
of 3.0%, for an alcohol content of 4.8% I primed with 3/4# of light
dry malt extract disolved in a couple cups of the (heated) wort. After
aging about three months, it was as wonderfully smooth, dark and sweet
as the real Mackeson. 


Maybe better.


Cheers, Doug
