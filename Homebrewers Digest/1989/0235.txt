Subject:  Chicago micro redux


I got all of last week's HBDs last night and was glad to see others' comments
about Siebens and Chicago micros in general.  I agree with all comments,
particularly Daryl's admonition not to support bad beer -- I would extend
that to drastically overpriced beer as well.  I also concur that Goose Island
is the best micro I've tasted (so far) in Chicago, that is since Sieben's has
taken a dive -- they really used to make decent beer.  I would NOT recommend
the Tap and Growler, however.  I went there about a year and a half ago, within
many months of their opening.  They had only two of five advertised beers.
As I remember they were both light, lacking in character, and way
overpriced.  The attention to the decor (lots of brass fittings) didn't
extend to the beer.  I hear through my brother in Chicago that the new
suburban brewer (I also forget the name) is making good beer.  I have tickets
for the September 19th Cubs vs. Mets game, and hope to be celebrating a
victory afterwards at a small northside German beer hall which carries this
new brew [the benefits of day baseball include being able to go out for
dinner afterwards and still get home at reasonable hour].  I will consider it
a duty to report my findings soon afterwards.

Subject: Cherries in the Scum (er..Snow)


I have recently tried C.P's recipe for Cherries in the Snow.  In addition
to noticing the white scum referred to by others, I had one of the cherries
block the hole in the top of the primary fermenter (a 5 gal. food grade
bucket) with a resulting explosion blowing the lid off the fermenter.  
Renamed the brew Cherries on the wall.  The lid fell face up (Murphy must
have been asleep) and we placed it back on.


When I transferred this brew to the secondary fermenter and placed the 
fermentation lock on the top, the lock ran backwards (sucking air, instead
of bubbling air).  Has anyone had a similar experience?  I boiled some
more water with 2 cups of corn sugar, let cool, and added this to the 
fermenter.  Within 10 minutes the process was running normally.  You 
know what they say, "Don't worry..."

Subject: Anyone familiar with this magazine?


An acquaintance mentioned that he had seen a magazine devoted to brewpubs
and microbreweries with the title something roughly like _Microbrewing_.
If anyone is familiar with this magazine, and has contact information,
I, and I am certain that others, would appreciate your sharing it with
us.

Subject: back issues of homebrew digest


All back issues of the homebrew digest that were on mthvax.cs.miami.edu
for anonymous ftp were lost in a catastrophic disk failure sometime
Sunday or Monday morning. I'm working on recovering those I kept copies
of, and David H. is providing some.  It will probably be several days,
however, before the archives here are restored totally.
