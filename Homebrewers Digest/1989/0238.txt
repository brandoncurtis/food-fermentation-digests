I missed the June 28 issue and this sounds like something I could use.  My
beer refridgerator won't go above 40 degrees at its warmest setting.  I would
like to go a little warmer for my lagers.  Were would I look for this 
thermostat and how do you install it?

I'm heading to St. Louis over labor day weekend, partly to see how the big kid
on the street makes his beer. (A.B.)


What else is there to see in town, brew-wise?


Any and all hints will be greatly appreciated.

I've had varying results with root beer, all of them bad, so I can
tell you what *not* to do:
1) Don't under-sugar.  I had one batch which had great form (as in
looked right, produced a good head, etc.), but I'd forgotten to add
enough sugar for both the fermentation and flavor.  I ended up with
sugar-free rootbeer.  It worked fine for floats, where the icecream
provides sugar, or if you're diabetic, but otherwise it's pretty rank.
IN conversation with a friend who used to make the stuff as a kid, he
said that they'd mix it up, bottle it, then  put the crates under the
stairs in the basement.  They'd wait until they heard a couple bottles
explode, then they knew they were ready... 
2) Do get a good extract, or brew from bark yourself.  I had a batch
that had everything except for the fact that the starting extract was
off.  


I've given up on rootbeer, and gone back to the malt kind.
