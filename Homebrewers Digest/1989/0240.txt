  What I did was start with a Hunter fan dealer, who told me they
didn't carry Hunter thermostats, but "so and so" appliance repair
did and I was able to order it from there. Prior to this I had called
some of the builder's supply stores in my area (Raleigh/Durham NC)
but drew a blank.
  I was told by Bob Swanson (rds`at`vogon.cray.com) that "Builder's
Square" had the unit in stock in his area (Twin Cities?) for $34 which
is what I paid for mine.
  As for how to use it: You stick an AA cell in it, plug in the fridge
and connect the unit to a wall outlet, then put the thermistor (on a
4 foot cord) into the fridge, and adjust the setpoint with a keypad.
A liquid crystal display shows time, temp, setpoint, etc.

Subject: Book recommendation wanted


I have an introductory homebrewing book and by using it have brewed 3 lagers
and one porter from dry extracts and pelletized hops.  I think I can advance
beyond that now.


What is the best all-around book on homebrewing?  I'm probably to the advanced
beginner stage and need a good detailed guide.  I've seen several titles and
authors mentioned here but what does everyone recommend?


Thanks,
Bruce

 I've started (just recently) a list of suppliers.  Also, John
 Mellby posted the addresses of several Brew related periodicals along
 with his comments.  I have include that list.  I plan on adding
 actual bibliographic information also (ie: brewing books, article
 refs, etc.).


 The list is in troff REFER format.  The suppliers have a special
 mapping of control characters given by the "brew-bib.prompt" file.
 This is simply used with the 'addbib' program.


 I hope this helps.

Subject: Doric Yeast


Yesterday I made a batch of Porter (Autumn seems to be coming early
here this year, and with it, my fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
darker ales), and not content with trying a new recipe and
unfamiliar hops, I also used a yeast I hadn't tried before:  Doric. 
If this batch turns out to be seriously flawed, I'll have no idea
whatever what the problem is!


The yeast gave me a bit of a scare, in that it seemed very slow to
start, and formed a softer-appearing cap than the yeasts I'm
accustomed to (Edme and Red Star)(yes, I know).  Has any kind HBD
reader used Doric before?  Is it as attenuative as Edme?  As
"estery" as Red Star Ale?  Is it, for that matter, an ale yeast at
all?  Youth (?) Wants to Know ...

Subject: Hot & Cold Breaks


I've been reading a huge HBD backlog (due to the 'phone strike, I've
been a tad busy, lately) this morning, and am surprised that no one
seems to have answered Gordon's question on cold breaks in HBD 221. 
So, lacking either fear or good judgement, I'll rush on in ...


As I understand it, a "break" is large-scale flocculation, usually
of proteins, brought on by temperature change.  The hot break occurs
during boil, and results in the sediments left behind with the hops
when racking from the boiler (assuming you cool the wort elsewhere).
The cold break results from the abrupt temperature drop of
force-cooling, and reputedly removes many nasties responsible for
chill haze and off-flavors.


If my understanding is flawed, I'm sure someone will set us straight
promptly!  8->}

Subject: Re:  well water


In HBD 237, Doug Bonar asks about E.coli contamination in well
water.  Having lived more than half my life beyond the reach of
municipal supplies, I think I can address this.


Your chances of contamination by E.coli (or, for that matter, by
many of the most popular contaminants) depends on the depth of your
well, composition of surrounding rock strata, quality and depth of
the casing, surrounding population density, percolation qualities of
the soil, and a host of other factors.  For example:  I have two
wells.  One is an 18' hand-dug pit, sanitary capped (presumably in
response to the 1953 California law banning open wells) and fitted
with a pump.  The (meager) flow into this well has been contaminated
for years, and though I could theoretically use it for irrigation, I
don't use it at all.  The contamination is undoubtedly from
neighboring sewage systems.  The soil here is mostly mine dump and
decomposed granite (yes, I live in California's "Mother Lode"
country, where virtually every square inch of soil has been turned
over in search of gold) resting on a granite base, so the water
leaching from a septic system can travel a considerable distance,
and a shallow well is likely to draw water mainly from this source.


My other well is drilled, and some 140' deep.  It's cased right down
to bedrock strictly to exclude surface water contamination.  In the
11 years we've lived here, only once have we detected
contamination:  after a 1986 flood left the well head under several
feet of water!  I poured a gallon of bleach down the well, purged it
the next day, and retested a week later, finding no further sign of
coliform (or any other) contamination.


The answer, I guess, is don't worry about contamination unless
you've been presented with a compelling reason to do so, or unless
you live in the vicinity of an industrial plant or military base. 
There have been many recent reports of industrial chemicals being
disposed of by injecting them into dry wells, which of course moves
these goodies quickly into the local water supply.  When you
consider the known effects of some of these chemicals, their impact
on the taste of beer seems rather insignificant ...
