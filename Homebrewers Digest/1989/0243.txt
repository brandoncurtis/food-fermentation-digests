This has been addressed recently, in issues 217 and 218, as well as in a recent issue (not the most recent) of ZYMURGY.  The only negative comment I have heard is that a typical freezer is full of bacteria, which can infect the ice quite easily.  Don't kn
ow about an automatic ice maker.

Williams Brewery Supplies sells these for a farthing.  I don't have the
address handy.  I'll try to get it from home.  It's somewhere in
California, and they do ship.

Hello, all!


Well, I finally got to talk to my department's resident micro person a few 
days ago, and "la white scum" is *definitely* a wild yeast introduced by the 
cherries themselves.  As different varieties of cherries will be availiable in 
different places, it is logical that some individuals will get this effect 
when using cherries in brewing, and others will not.


For those with microbiological knowledge:  when I did my Gram stain on the 
scum, and then looked through the microscope, I saw thingies that were Gram 
positive, and thingies that were Gram negative, and they were morphologically 
the same.  My reaction to this was, understandably, "Uh oh!"


Well, it turns out that the active yeast stain Gram positive, and the *spores* 
stain Gram negative.  This is apparently typical of many yeasts.  As I haven't 
worked with yeasts much (apart from brewing, that is :-) ), I wasn't aware of 
this phenomenon.


So, pardon me... there's this bottle of pale pink bubbly stuff waiting for 
me...
