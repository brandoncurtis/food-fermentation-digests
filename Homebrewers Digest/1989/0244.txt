Subject: Mashing in Enameled Cast Iron


I'm about to do some mashing for the first time and was thinking through
the process. I have some Le Cruset french ovens which are enameled cast
iron. The enamel is in good shape.  I was thinking of doing my mash in this
and when done sparging into a stainless steel pot for the boil.  Are there
any reasons why a enameled cast iron pot shouldn't be used?  On the plus
side, the cast iron will hold the temperature well, so that's why I'd like
to use it.

Subject: another Mackeson's recipe


        For those trying to duplicate Mackeson's Stout: I found another
recipe! Actually, two recipes. They are both from the book _All_About_
Beer_ by Bob Pritchard, a retired English brewer.  I got the book thru 
Williams Homebrew Supply.


        Other than the recipes (which are mostly for traditional
English styles) I don't recommend the book very highly. The
experienced homebrewer will not learn much (other than some
interesting and humorous descriptions of commercial practices) and the
author's views on mashing vs extract and adjuncts will offend many
purists.


                Mashing Recipe
                5 gal, OG 1040, FG 1008-1010


                5 lb pale ale malt
                1/2 lb crystal malt
                1/2 lb roast black malt
                1 lb soft brown sugar
                1 3/4 oz Fuggle hops


                Treat water with 1/4 oz magnesium sulfate and 1 oz 
        common salt. Crush all grains and mash in 2 gal water at 165F
        for 2 hours. Sparge with 2 gal at 170F. "A few drops of 
        caramel may be added at this stage if sufficient color has 
        not been achieved."


                Boil 1-1 1/2 hours with hops and sugar, bring to 5
        gal, pitch yeast.




                Extract Recipe
                5 gal, OG 1040, FG 1008-1010


                4 lb dark malt extract
                2 lb soft brown sugar
                8 fl oz gravy browning (caramel E150)(?)
                1 3/4 oz Fuggle hops


                "In my opinion, the color required in a stout may be
        obtained from burnt sugar or caramel equally as that obtained 
        from roast malt or barley...and makes a good enough stout."


                Boil hops in about 20 pints of water for 1 hour.
        Strain and dissolve extract, caramel and sugar. Boil for 15 
        minutes, top of to 5 gal, pitch yeast.


                Both recipes can be brewed at 1045 by increasing
        extract by 1/4 lb.


                "Neither will be as sweet as commercial sweet stouts,
        as the home brewer cannot filter, prime heavily and pasteurise. 
        As the freely fermenting sugars have fermented out, only the 
        final gravity of unfermentable provides sweetness. If lactose 
        sugar is available, about 1/4 lb may be added to either brew 
        at the boiling stage and will provide a slightly higher gravity 
        and possibly a sweeter palate, but is not a great sweetener and 
        is expensive.


                As with sweet brown ale, the homebrewer will again
        have to do what the commercial brewer is not allowed to do and 
        that is to add saccharin tablets according to taste when 
        bottling. One to two per pint bottle will give an apparent 
        sweetness and an enjoyable sweet stout will be achieved."


        No wonder it's so easy to make better beer than the breweries
do! With attitudes like his apparently prevalent in the industry,
homebrewing is in no danger of becoming extinct.


        I haven't tried either of these, and I'm not about to go
adding saccharin to my beer, so you're on your own from here.

My favorite two books are William Mares' "Making Beer" (I think that's the 
whole title) and the well known "The Complete Joy of Homebrewing," by 
Charlie Papazian. 


"Making Beer" is organized as a chronicle of Mares' experience in brewing.  
It details his experiences, beginning with several false starts which were 
heavily influenced by some not-so-good books on brewing, through his 
eventual success with extracts, more false starts with all grain, success 
again, and finally, NOT starting his on microbrewery. It is anecdotal from 
beginning to end, has lots of good info about practical equipment and 
techniques, includes some recipes, and has a decent index. 


Papazian's book is closer to a textbook; the anecdotes are short and it 
isn't a chronicle.  It has lots of recipes, including some unusual beers 
and mead.  The technical information is broader and more complete, but it 
still isn't a reference manual.  The book's worst feature is its lack of 
an index.

FINALLY! 


A little over two years ago we bought a house & immediately entered the
remodel mode. I made a pledge to myself that I wasn't going to make
any beer until the bathroom was done (the incentive program). 


Well, the bathroom's _almost_ done, so I ordered about $100 worth of
ingredients from Great Fermentations of Santa Rosa (what a great
company! they have good stuff & two-day delivery). Last evening when I
got home at about 8:00 there were the goodies on my front porch, and I
couldn't wait; I stayed up till 11:00 making a batch. I decided to try
something simple, yet a little different than anything I've done
before -- here's the recipe, which I think I'll call Clara Bell:


7# Light syrup, unhopped (a really tasty, _light_ syrup)
1# Clara Pils, cracked (this is a source of dextrin: anybody had
                        experience with it?)
1# Light crystal, cracked
1.5 oz Hallertauer Hops Pellets
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp citric acid
2 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient
2 TBLS Irish moss


I first put the Clara Pils & crystal in a 2 gallon pot with 170 - 180
degree water for an hour, stirring occasionally. I then sparged it
into the boiling pot with enough hot water for a volume of about 3
1/2 gallons, added the syrup & 1 oz of hops. I boiled for an hour,
adding the Irish moss during the last half hour and the other 1/2 oz
hops during the last 10 minutes. I then added the salt, citric &
nutrient and plunked it into the primary. The wort had a start
S.G.(corrected) of 1.059. This morning it was cool enough (~75 F), so
I pitched two packets of Munton & Fisson.


I _can't_ wait to taste it! I can't _believe_ I went 2 1/2 years
without making any beer!

Hello, homebrewer!


Call me Doug, or Shoeless Joe, or
Buck Buckman.
Anyhow, I'm interested in collecting old books -- and I mean OLD! --
regarding homebrewing, beer, etc.  Anybody out there who has anything
which might interest me PLEASE e-mail a letter directly to me!
Thanks...
  dtg
P.S.  I'm particularly interested in stuff which predates the civil war...
      but I'd happily consider anything before WWII.  (My last acquisition
      was from 1697 -- a treatise which listed "statutes in force" regarding
      Bi[Driton's tax laws.

~sSG temperature correction formula


As previouseley noted 
   
>and on Doug Roberts (HBD #236)
>
>             (T x 1.449E-4 - 0.009) + SG(uncorrected) = SG(corrected)  


This formula does not hold true for 60 degrees F.  For 60 F I get a correction
factor of -0.000306,  decidedly not 0 as it should be for a hydrometer
calibrated to read acurateley `at` 60.  I plotted the function using data
points that I got out of the back of Byron Burch's Brewing quality Beers.
The function that I was looking at was decidedly _not_ linear.


Here are the data points that I got from the book (reprinted without 
authorization)
Degrees F        Correction
32                -1.6
41                -1.3
50                -0.8
60                 0.0
68                 1.0
77                 2.2
86                 3.5
95                 5.0
104                 6.8
etc.


The point is that one of the two are wrong, the table or the formula. I too
would like to see a formula for SG correction, but, I would like it to agree
with a little more of the published (alright I only looked at 1 source) data.
