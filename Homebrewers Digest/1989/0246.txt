Subject:  Doug Roberts ??s on cara pils etc.


Doug Roberts asks about mashing cara pils as a source of dextrin.  I have
been adding about 1/2 pound to all my mashes over the last year.  I don't
have a controlled experiment to test its effect, but it theoretically
increases body and head retention.  I produce a nice full-bodied beer, with
creamy head on the beer, but that may also be due to high mashing
temperatures. More importantly, I BELIEVE that you must mash cara pils to get
the goodies out.  Boiling or steeping it will not do the trick.  (I'll have
to check the literature on this, but that is my best recollection).  You may
want to check this out before using any more of it in your extract recipes.  I
notice that you mashed it with the crystal malt in your second (Malz bier)
recipe, but it may not contain enough enzymes to mash alone (crystal has NO
enzymes) -- I'll definately have to consult the literature on this, but again
that is what comes to mind.  A pound or two of pale malt should provide the
necessary enzymes.


Doug also writes:

A few personal opinions on your recipes (this one and Clara Bell):


1. For a beer this malty I'd suggest more bittering hops, at least 2 oz. of
5% alpha acid bittering hops.  Another opinion: Save that nice Hallertauer
for flavor or aroma hops (added to the last 10 minutes of boil, steeped, or
dry hopped).  I've gone to high alpha acid varieties exclusively for primary
bittering hops, saving the wonderful Willamettes, Cascades, Saaz, etc. for
flavor and aroma.  What are other people's experiences?  Does the variety of
bittering hops really affect flavor (as opposed to bitterness) at all?
Finally, I thought dry-hopping usually took place a few days before
bottling.  The acidity and alcohol in the fermented beer prevents the
flourishing of all the bacteria on those unwashed, unheated hops flowers.
Although I do not practice this technique (being a bacterio-phobe), I
understand it results in WONDERFUL hop aroma.


2.  Salt, citric acid and yeast nutrient?  My opinion (from what I've read
and experienced) is that these adjuncts are unnecessary when making extract
beer.  I've made wonderful extract stout with distilled (actually R/O)
water.  The extract should provide enough nutrients, acidity and minerals
(salts) for proper fermentation.  Perhaps this is not true for some syrups.
Any other opinions out there?


3.  1-2 TABLESPOONS of irish moss?  That seems like a lot to me.  Check your
local literature.


Not trying to bash on you, Doug.  I'm just a frustrated brewer in the humid
midwest, waiting for the mold count to drop in my damp house and runnin' out
of homebrew from last year.  Glad you're back in the saddle!

"I'm about to try mashing for the first time :-) using a 33 qt enamel pot

Good luck to you.  Plan ahead so that you know what you want to do at
each step.  And don't worry too much about times and temperatures--
these things do work naturally.


"but I've thought of another way that I
"haven't read about.  Why not emerse the pot in a sink of water?  It seems
"like an easy way to control the temperature surrounding the mash.  Has
"anyone tried this before or know of a good reason not to?


Can you get a sink full of water at 150-160F?  Can you do this within a
few degrees?  If you are going to do a single step infusion mash, Dave
Line's suggestion of an insulated cooler is probably the best way to
do it.


There is a big advantage to moving up from 5 gallon batches when working
with grain.  I don't worry about losing temperature during a rest with
a 15 gallon batch--there is just too much thermal inertia (combined
with the stainless steel pot I use) for it to move in half an hour
or more.

"5. Has this ever happened to anyone else? I racked my Clara Bell batch
"from the primary to the secondary day before yesterday. The head had

"fermentation comes to a complete halt for up to 3 or 4 days, after
"which it slowly resumes. Any ideas?


After the head falls, most of the yeast has run out of food and is falling
out of solution and becoming dormant.  One of the reasons why you get a
head on fermenting beer is the same as why you get it on a finished beer--
there are CO2 bubbles building a head in conjunction with the protiens.
When the fermentation slows down, there is a lot less CO2 coming off the
beer, so there isn't anything to form a head with.  Also, I usually notice
that the airlock doesn't move much after racking.  I attribute this to
the fact that I have purged most of the CO2 out of solution as well, by
running it through that narrow racking tube.  This is actually a Good
Thing (tm) because it means that I've purged the air out of the carboy
I'm racking into.  But it takes the slowed down yeast quite a while to
once again reach a saturated solution of CO2;  only after this will
the CO2 begin evolving from the beer again.

>In digest #245, Doug Roberts writes:

I don't know about Cara Pils (Dextrine) Malt, but Crystal Malt has
no enzymes (they have been killed by the heat used in manufacturing
the malt), so there is no point in mashing Crystal Malt. Anytime you
raise the temperature of the malt above 160F or so, you denature the
enzymes that convert the starches to complex sugars to simple sugars.
I simply steep the Crystal Malt in a grain bag while the liquor comes
to a boil.  Then I sparge with ice cold water into the primary --
yes, I know it's not as efficient as a hot sparge, but once I pour
the hot wort into the cold sparge water, I can pitch immediately.

Subject: Mackeson's and Soft Brown Sugar


Doug Roberts says:
"I will never again make a batch with brown sugar as an ingredient (a
little honey or molasses, perhaps, but not caramelized refined sugar)."
Which I agree with!  However, to shed a little light, I think one
problem may be that in Britain soft brown sugar is (relatively)
unrefined. It's not dyed refined sugar, it's thick, gluey (almost
gooey) stuff, somewhere between turbonado (sp?) and white sugar.
Turbonado is much less refined, black and gooey but still somewhat
crystalline. Perhaps with British style brown sugar the Mackeson's
would come out better. Not that I'd try it, mind you. 


Can anyone recommend a book that describes the differences between
different styles of beer? E.g. Maerzen, Trappist, Bock, Alt, etc. I'd
like something pretty detailed, that describes what gives each style
its individual character.

Does anyone know if Charlie P. is planning to product a revised
edition to "The Complete Joy of Home Brewing"?  Two things
I would like to see added are (of course) a complete index, and
expected starting and final specific gravity ranges on more of the 
recipes (mostly the all grain brews toward the end of the book).


Is there a place we could call/mail to to provide requests for a revised
edition?


Also, has the net index to TCJOHB been revised lately?  My copy is at least 
8 months to a year old.  Can someone post the latest, greatest copy?


Thanks!

  Don't do that. Running the wort down the side in a thin film causes
air to dissolve in the wort. Run the hose or another racking tube all
the way down and fill the new container from the bottom up instead.

  This is not needed. There are many many millions of yeast cells
suspended in the actively fermenting wort you are racking.

  I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that the infusion of new
oxygen caused by improper racking might have triggered another
respiration phase in the yeast, causing the pause you observed.

I have brewed a scullion of beers with Doric Ale yeast now, most of them
Amber Ales (Pale Ales in some books, sweet browns in others), and have been
so pleased with the results that I keep a stack of it around for emergency
use in case some new experimental yeast doesn't pan out and a kick start is
needed. Doric is indeed less attenuative than Edme and Red Star, producing
in my Amber ales a nice sweet flavor with no harshness and full body.
I would describe it as a fine, conservative, failsafe yeast which appears
to impart no special flavors of its own.


On a related subject, I have an interesting beer fermenting in my basement
which is beginning to annoy me, as it has been in the secondary fermenter for
nearly 12 weeks now at between 66 and 75 degrees, and shows no signs of
slowing down. The fermentation collar of bubbles is thick and active, and
there are no signs of filth or perversion that would indicate contamination.
The yeast involved is CWE dried ale yeast, from England. I mean, I've heard
of attenuative yeasts, but I really have to wonder what the heck those little
beasties are chewing on by now. It was only a two-can Amber recipe!


Maybe they're working their way through the glass.
Maybe I should start to really worry. Or call the police.

Having recently discovered Dextrin Malt, this recipe looks pretty good to
me. I like the color, taste, and aroma of this malt.


I always thought that both crystal malt and dextrin malt contain no
enzymes.  If this is the case, why a 2 hour mash?  Just a short steep in
warm water should do the trick.


Is 'rich crystal' just a darker version of 'ordinary crystal'?  I've 
noticed a WIDE variation in color in crystal malts.
