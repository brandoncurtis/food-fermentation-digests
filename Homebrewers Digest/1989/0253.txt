Subject: lagering times and temps


In HB.DIG #251, Brian Capouch asks:


>How long do you experts leave your lagers to ferment?  I tourned Anheuser-Busch
>last weekend, and they tell me that Budweiser takes about 20 days from mash to
>departure from the brewery.
>...
>Even once that problem is solved, how long do the big boys of homebrewing lager
>for, and what price is paid for leaving the bottled beer at room temperature.


I'm not an expert, but I CAN type and blabber, for its own value.  I recently
asked the same questions in this forum, and received various answers.  From
my limited experience, I recommend at least a month in the fermenter at less
than 48 degrees, and lager at reduced temperature (around 32 degrees) for at
least one more month.  Two months is better, and up to six months would be
great, according to the good books, but my brews never last that long...


As for temperature increases, that's a really good question...I have avoided
allowing the temperature to go above 32 degrees after lagering, as   
recommended by one of my books.  However, I don't know if this is necessary.
During the time I lived in Germany, I purchased quite a lot of beer from
the "Getrankmarkts", which are nothing more than back-door stores full of 
cases of beer.  Some were tucked away in alleys, while others were 
nothing more than converted lower levels of dwellings.  The temperatures 
ranged various, and in some cases were way up there at 70 degrees, I bet.
Indeed, some of the beers still had live yeast ("Hefe Weizen"), so these
should come under the home brew lager catagory.  It's anyone's guess 
whether the yeasts autolyzed under these conditions, but I always enjoyed
them.  If the Germans can do this routinely and produce such good brews, I
suspect that even our unfiltered homebrew will survive it.  Other opinions?

Subject: August Homebrew Digest Index


I finally got tired of looking through all the digests to find information 
that I know was there somewhere.  I wrote a simple program (I am a programmer 
after all) to read the header information from the digests and pull out the 
contents section.  I did not edit the resulting file, so those people that are 
too lazy to put subjects or just use REPLY to send submissions have their 
subjects missing or just say "RE: Homebrew Digest #nnn".  Please put in a 
subject field when making a submission to the digest.  It will make it easier 
for those of us who keep them and actually use them for reference.


Attached to the end of this message is the index for August, 1989.  I will be 
sending the indices one at a time in order not to make the digests too long.  
I have the ones for Nov88, Dec88, Jun89, Jul89, and Aug89.  As soon as I get 
the others from Miami, I will make indices and send them on.  As each month 
ends, I will send the index.


PLEASE USE SUBJECTS IN YOUR MESSAGES!!!
