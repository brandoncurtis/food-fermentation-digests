Subject: Yeast experiments


        Jeff Casey reported his experiments with yeasts, and I thought
I might add to (or further confuse) the discussion. His experiment,
with seven different yeasts in one gallon batches, is more ambitious
than my own. I tried three different yeasts (Red Star Ale, Red Star
Lager, and M&F Ale) with three different temperature profiles. The ale
yeasts were fermented warm (68-73F) and the lager yeast was done warm,
done warm with a 50F lagering period, and fermented at 50F and
lagered: five one-gal batches in all.


        The recipe was Papazian's "The Sun Has Left Us On Time Steam
Beer." I was looking for a light-boddied brew to serve at a party
to non-fanatics, so I didn't want to stray too far from Budmillob,
but I wanted something with some character in case I had to finish the
leftovers.


        The local homebrew club (QUAFF) did the tasting for me.
Overall winner (dry, best head, no funny notes) was M&F, second was
the "cold steam" (lagered, warm fermented lager yeast). When I ask
them which they'd recommend for my intended audience, the order
reversed (cold steam won). Nobody liked the lager or the Red Star Ale,
the "warm steam" was third.


        [Jeff describes the recipe he used, which included two oz
Cluster hops for bittering...]
>First:  I already realize that I used a pretty bad recipe for the test.  It
>had far too much bittering hops for balance.  The idea was to look for 
>differences in yeasts, however, so I tried to look through it. 
        [He goes on to list results for the various yeasts, many of
which are judged to suffer from "yeast bite"]


        The Cluster hops may make this difficult. I have
experienced a nasty aftertaste when using them, which some yeasts
soften quite acceptably, and others do not. I was amazed at how
much difference the yeast made in hop character. But (back to the
point) the "yeast bite" reported is something I've always thought of
as a very subtle flavor, which might easily be masked by the Clusters.
Maybe someone with more experience in this area could comment on this.


>I was also experimenting on yeasts suitable for my conditions (Boston 
>in summertime), where the temperatures are ungodly hot, and mold runs rampant.  
>I also realize the problem with my lack of gravity measurements and exact 
>temperatures, sorry.  Don't chew me out for these, but I would be interested 
>to hear if one of the "bad" yeasts might be perfectly good under other 
>circumstances. 


        Temperature makes a very noticeable difference. The only
difference between a steam beer and a lager is fermentation
temperature, and steam beers have a lot more ester tastes (which lager
brewers avoid like death). In my experiment, the cold-fermented lager
had a thinner, "cleaner", less complicated taste than the steam beer.
Lagering the steam beer seemed to take some rough edges off, though
the difference was slight IMHO.


        If you anticipate problems with mold infections, you might
want to favor a very active yeast, which will beat the mold to the
nutrients. M&F ale fermented amazingly actively in my experiment, the
next being the warm lager yeast. Either will tolerate <85F pretty
well.


        Thanks, Jeff, for a very informative article. Please post any
further results along these lines.

Subject: Wort Chiller






I would like to add a wort chiller to my homebrew arsenal and am try to
decide if I should make one or buy one.  What I want is the copper coil
type that fits in the boiling pot and attaches to a sink facet.  Has
anyone made one of these?  If so, what diameter of copper tubing should
be used, what length, and how much did it end up costing?

From: Pete Soper <soper`at`encore.com>
Subject: Color computing


  Mike Fertsch recently described how to predict the color 
of a beer by adding up the color contribution of ingredients 
using their Lovibond numbers. I would like to add a couple of 
details to this based on my experience. I've been working on 
a spreadsheet for quite some time that among other things 
does color prediction. I've had to add to it to compensate 
for a few important factors.
  First, wort darkens while you are making and boiling it.
The amount of darkening can vary over a broad range. If you 
do full wort boil with a heating system that doesn't burn 
the wort then a fudge factor of around 25% might be right. 
That is, the color of the wort might come out 1.25 times as 
dark as what you would expect by just using the Lovibond numbers.
For a very long and/or very concentrated boil (e.g. not
boiling all the water with the extract), on an electric stove
with the kind of pot that is prone to hot spots, the fudge 
factor needed to account for this could be dramatically higher.
In addition to the boil, I believe that handling of hot wort 
while making it from grain can also cause darkening, especially 
the transfer from the lauter tun. However I have not tried to 
quantify this.
  The wort lightens in color during fermentation. However the 
amount of lightening is so slight that I ignore it. For that
matter, if you had the equipment to filter the yeast out of
your beer you'd probably want to take that into account since
other material is filtered out too and this can affect the
color. I recently visited a brewpub in England where the
brewmaster was moaning about having to deal with this kind of
tradeoff. He had a starch haze, but in getting rid of it he
lost significant flavor. But enough of that.
  The very dark malts can produce color contributions
that are hard to predict. The way you grind, steep and sparge
them makes a big difference in the amount of color contributed.
For example I sampled a club beer last night that had a color 
of about 13 degrees L which is roughly half way between Bass 
Ale (10) and Michelob Classic Dark (17).  As I'm looking at 
this beer I'm being told that its maker intended it to be a
Porter and included 8 ounces of black patent malt.  Huh?
A quick bit of pencil work tells me this beer should be 
around 50-60 degrees L, which is essentially black. A few 
moments later the club member says "I just cracked the black 
malt with a rolling pin". Mystery solved. 
  By contrast I very finely grind the small amounts of chocolate
malt I use for color adjustments and get the "expected" color
contribution.  So my current bias is to grind the heck out of
dark malts as part of extracting all the color. However this
might be the WRONG thing to do if you do not have a
filter bed of some sort to prevent the solid material from
getting into your boiling pot. In this case, you'd perhaps be
better off crushing the grain and applying a fudge factor
of less than 1 based on experience.
  Haze is another thing that you have to account for. If you
are making a very pale beer the slightest bit of haze will make
the beer appear noticably darker. Darker beers are also subject
to this but it takes a lot more haze to swing the apparent color.
  A few months back I got a couple of cylinders and some 
Michelob Classic Dark and followed the procedure that Breiss
developed and Fix described in "Zymurgy" 9 months to a year 
ago. It works very well and is super for determining the real
effects of different dark malts depending upon how you use them.
  So let me just run through a quick example to tie this together.
I recently made a 5 gallon batch with these ingredients:


  7 pounds (normally crushed) 2 row 1.2L Klages malt
  1/2 oz finely powdered 350L chocolate malt
  8 oz (normally crushed) 3L wheat malt
  8 oz (normally crushed) 40L crystal malt


  Here are the contributions:


  7lb klages X 1.2 = 8.4
  .031lb choc X 350 = 10.9
  .5lb wheat = 1.5
  .5lb crystal = 20


  for a total of 40.8


  dividing by 5 gallons gives an expected color of 8.2L


  Then applying a fudge factor of 1.25 for wort darkening, 1.0 for
  the dark malt grind and 1.0 for haze gives me 10.3L and
  this is about what the beer really looks like and what I was
  after in the first place. If I had put the chocolate malt
  under a rolling pin I might have only gotten 1/3 the normal color
  out of it and so would have gotten 8.3L. Applying a .33 fudge
  factor would have led me to use 1.5oz and so compensate.
  Likewise, a longer or more concentrated boil (i.e. not boiling
  all the water with the extract) might have given me twice the
  darkening or a fudge factor of 1.5 so I'd want to use less
  chocolate to tune the final color.
