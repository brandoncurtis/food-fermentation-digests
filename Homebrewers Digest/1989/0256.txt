Mark Nevar <man`at`garage.att.com> on fermentation of a steam beer - after
fermentation at cool temp:

This may not be resumed fermentation.  Remember that the liquid can hold
less CO2 at warmer temperatures.  As the beer warms up, some of the CO2
will come out of solution, as bubbles.  The yeast at the bottom of the
fermenter is an ideal place for bubbles to form.


So...are you sure it was really fermenting, and not just releasing excess
CO2?


and also...


Subject: indices

I don't find them to be useful either.  First, I don't save all digests--
many articles are interesting for the moment but only as "conversation"
and not "archival quality".  I've got limited disk here; it doesn't help
to have index entries to articles I've tossed.


A second objection is that they're not really indices; they're tables of
contents.  One can (as Wageman noted) get a collected table of contents
with a one-liner.  I suspect the folks who save everything already have
ToC scripts of their own.  An index--meaning a subject-based list of
articles, sorted by subject--would be vastly more useful.  It would also
be vastly more work; I'm not about to suggest that anyone undertake it.


My third objection relates to the particular software I've got here,
although it's a harbinger of a more general problem:  My poor antiquated
mailer gags (without completely barfing) on a mail message of more than
32Kb.  It delivers the mail but tosses a copy back at the sender.  (Sorry,
Rob!)  Friday's digest provoked this problem; the bounce was 37Kb or so.
That's my problem and I'm going to replace the mailer asap, but there are
other limits elsewhere--one local Internet machine which probably routes a
lot of the digest has a 50Kb message limit.  If we get digests that large
we're going to have massive bouncing with headaches for Rob.  The last
"index" digest put us 3/4 of the way there.

it might be nice if the indices were distributed as "special issues",
but considering that after the past digests' indices go out, the rate
of posting will go down to once per month, it doesn't seem to me to be
a serious problem.


sure, you can "grep -i yeast hbd.*", but that's not quite as nice as
having the indices where you see poster's name as well.  i run a BBS
((217)384-4311, mention the digest when you logon) where i keep the
digest in monthly archives for download.  most of those archives are
>100kbytes.  i've had a request from my users for an index so they
would know which archives would be most interesting to download (my
answer was "they're ALL interesting!").


the one problem i have with the posted indices is that the data is
pretty raw.  the "RE: homebrew digest #121" subjects are pretty worthless,
and the "from" fields sometimes get pretty wierd.  i've toyed with the
idea of digestifying the digest: collect the "best" postings on a
subject from several month's worth digests to create special topical
digests.


btw, i download all the homebrew digests to my BBS for inclusion in
my archives, and i also gate them into a fidonet homebrewing "echo".
if you or someone you know would like to keep up with the digest
without access to the internet, try my BBS or one of the many other
fidonet BBSs which carry the ZYMURGY echo.

Personally, I'd like the indexes, but I don't like them as part of
the digest proper.  If they could be sent as separate messages,
perhaps a series of messages now and one at the end of each month
for the future, that would be nice.


Why not as part of the digest?  Other than space, we're looking at a
catch-22: want to look something up in the index?  Great!  What
message had the index?  Just look in the index to find out!


Just one man's opinion, but considering the one man you may take it as
gospel.
