Not to underrate the effort involved, but I find wading through the 
indexes (while reading the digest) rather annoying, since I find that the
subject headers are not all that informative.  I think a seperate mailing
list to interested parties would be _much_ better.

Mark:


I recently made a steam bear with a WYeast lager yeast (I don't remember the
number, but could look it up).  I too fermented at 50-55 degrees.  All 
visible activity seemed to have stopped within about 10 days.  I let it sit
two weeks, racked to a secondary, dry hopped, and let it sit another 5 weeks
at the same temp.  My brew was just extract, hops, water and yeast.  It came
out very "dry" (seems to have replaced "lite" in beer-marketing-speak).  I
expect your fermentation was complete on schedule.  See the other articles on
CO2 capacity of liquids vs. temperature.

Now this is a little odd: I brewed a batch on August 31 (the Clara
Bell Bock beer). I pitched 14 grams of Munton & Fisson and saw a very
vigorous and healthy fermentation in the primary. Three days later the
head had dropped and I racked to the secondary, whereupon the
fermentation nearly died. It puttered along at a _very_ slow rate
until a day ago, when it started to pick up. Now, there is fairly
active fermentation going on, enough to cause a new light head of very
fine bubbles at the top of the secondary.


Any ideas as to what has caused this?
