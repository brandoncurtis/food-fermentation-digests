Could we get more information about how to access the BREWNET files?
It would be excellent to have a list of titles, and a method for
either retrieving the desired files,  or a way of perusing the files.


What is BREWNET?

We have a small homebrew club here that meets informally every month or so.
Lately we have been wondering how other clubs manage their meetings.
Here, everyone brings some homebrew, say a six-pack and then we evaluate
it. The problem is, if you have fifteen guys bringing at least one
(in some cases four or five) different beers then you soon wind up
out of time and overwhelmed with too many beers to safely taste and 
drive home in the same evening.


We usually start with the light beers and progressively get darker. There
is always a commercial mystery beer which everyone tastes and tries to
guess. Munchies are also provided.


So how do other clubs handle meetings? Thanks.

Hello there! I've never seen the BREWNET listings before and I was wondering
if it's possible to request some of the files that are listed. Anybody know?
Thanks

Subject: dry yeasts again


        For fans of dry yeasts: in the latest William's Brewing
catalog/Newsletter, There is an article by William Moore titled "Dry
Yeast Revisited." Williams, for those who haven't heard of them, is a
supplier (and vocal advocate) of liquid yeast cultures. They recently
tested a bunch of dry yeasts (along side their liquid yeasts) to see
if it is "possible to brew truly good beer with convenient dry
yeasts..." (a question I thought had been settled long ago).


        I won't quote the whole article, but to summarize, they found
that, if treated properly, dry yeast makes dandy beer, but not as good
as their liquid yeasts.


        To quote: 
                "It appears most home brewers have been abusing their
                dry yeast. Dry yeast should only be rehydrated in warm
                water between 90 and 100 degrees F. Use 1/2 cup of
                water for every 14 grams of dry yeast. Rehydrating 
                dried yeast in wort can shock and injure the yeast,
                because wort is relatively acid,and dry yeast prefers
                a neutral rehydration medium. It is vital to the
                future flavor of the beer that dry yeast be rehydrated
                in warm water only.


                Ideally, rehydration should take place for 15 minutes
                before pitching. When pitching, it is very important
                that the freshly revived yeast is not temperature
                shocked; a temperature change of more than 17 degrees
                will cause the yeast to both emit off-flavor compounds
                and slow down, perhaps halting all activity if the
                shock is great enough. If your yeast is at 90 degrees
                F. and your wort is at 65, add a half a cup of wort to
                your yeast to become acclimated to the new 
                temperature, and then pitch into the 65 degree
                fermenter."


        So I've been doing it right all along and thought I was being
lazy! The above advice is definitely contrary to that I've seen in 
several books on homebrewing, so if this starts a controversy, it 
could take quite a while to settle out.
