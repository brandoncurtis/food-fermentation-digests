I use a basting bulb (available at any supermarket) with great success.  You
can even pull the bulb off of the tube to get the whole affair sanitized.

Subject: HB.DIG #261-Dry yeasts, cold fermentation.




On the subject of reviving dry yeasts in warm water first.


Way back in the beginning, I used to revive my dry yeast this way.  Then,
as time went on, I started just tossing it in the fermenter in dry form.
My wife has said on several occasions that my later brews were never as
good as the first few.  The later ones having some sort of yeast bite.
Now I realize why this is.  I'll bet a dime to a dollar it was because I
hadn't been reviving the yeast as I formerly did.


I don't worry about this anymore, as I am now using liquid yeast.  I may
never go back to dry yeast except in emergency cases or in cases of sheer
laziness.  The clean flavor of the liquid yeast cannot be approached with
dry yeast.


Greg Crawford asks:

My guess is this.  With the ales, the flavor masked the off flavors, if there
were any.  Now, you are brewing a lager.  Lagers are notorious for revealing
any imperfection in one's techniques.  I'll wager you have a slight infection
of wild yeast or you are not cleaning your fermenters or equipment well
enough.  In any case, 40 degrees should be good for the lager yeast.


Then Mike Meyer asks about Barleywine:

>recipe -- some specialty grain is okay, but I sure don't want to mess with
>215 pounds of 2-row malt per 5-gallon batch...


What 215 lbs of grain?
Try using 10-12 lbs of plain light dried malt extract as the basis.  Then
add 1 lb of 80L crystal, and even a bit of chockolate malt if you wish.
Some toasted malted barley would also be good.  You may try 10 HBU's of
cascade, willamette, or other similar hops.  Use plenty of flavoring hops
at the end.

No I'm not talking about disappearing homebrew! Mark Nevar asks:


"I know there must be some kind of beer "thief" that can act like a
syringe.  I tried using a large syringe, but the needle opening was too
limiting.  Any ideas ?"


I use a turkey baster. Dip it in bleach and rinse it off. It takes a
couple of sucks to get the hydrometer full enough for a reading. I
haven't noticed any problems yet.

Subject: Brewer's Adjunct




At DeFalco's, I recently bought a 1.2 kg container of stuff called
"Brewer's Adjunct".  It was billed as newly available and the
adjunct that commercial breweries used (at least in Canada).  It 
is a transparent colourless syrup that is a lot like white corn
syrup, except that it tastes very neutral.  It is sweet without
having any real taste.  Does anyone know what it is?  Could it
be rice syrup?


On the topic of pitching yeast, I sprinkled a package of Ironmaster
kit yeast into my last batch at 100 degrees F.  It was the hottest
that I have ever pitched into, but it surprisingly had the best
primary fermentation yet (vigorous, but well behaved).
