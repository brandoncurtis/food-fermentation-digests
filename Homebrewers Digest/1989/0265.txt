  Your problem may be a high diacetyl level.  There was an article in
  one of the volumes of "Best of Beer and Brewing" (Vol 6 ???) about
  production schedules for Bavarian beers. This confirmed the advice
  given by my beer ingredient pusher regarding yeast strain #308.  It
  is advisable to raise the temperature of the beer just before it
  finishes fermenting to 50-60 degrees for a diacetyl rest.  The idea
  is to let the yeast correct it's own mistakes, in practice a brewery
  will add fresh fermenting beer to the lagered beer (krausening) just
  before bottling.  This brief fermentation will add CO2 and reduce
  remaining diacetyl to acceptable levels. I'm shooting from the hip
  here since I don't have my reference material at hand.  I can post
  specifics if anyone is interested.

Initially I rehydrated the yeast in a mixture of 1/4 cup of boiling
wort and 3/4 cup of cold water - it would develop a good head in the
hour of boiling and I got a vigorous fermentation. Then I got lazy
and just threw the dried yeast into the cooled (actually not very,
95-100F) wort. That also seemed to work OK. Next time I'll try the
plain water rehydration. The only problem I've run into was that the
fermentation often didn't go as far as I expected. Papazian says it
should go to about 1/4 the OG (eg 1.060 - 1.015); I get about half to
two thirds.


My parents used to live in the Middle East, and my mother brewed from
extract there. Room temperature was around 115F! She said she got a
very fast, vigorous fermentation, but it worked fine.
