coor's latest ad blitz got me thinking...


first budweiser (et al?) touted their beechwood aging to convince us
that their beer produced in modern metal vessels is just as good as
the beer that came from wooden casks.


then miller bragged that their bottled beer had the "genuine draft"
taste of beer from metal kegs.


now coors tells us that specially-coated cans make keystone taste like
bottled beer.


what's next?  beer sold in paper cartons that tastes just like canned
beer?


did medieval brewers have to convince people that beer produced in wooden
casks tasted as good as beer made in clay pots?

there's a scene in the movie "the outlaw josie wales", where a frontier
trader offers his customers a bucket of "fresh brewed chock".  is that
a genuine term for a variety of beer, or just some hollywood wordplay?

Hi!


My name is Steve Speer.  I see that somebody in netland mentioned this
address as a way to get on a Home Brew mailing list.  I have a beer kit that
I used in college and have been thinking of breaking it out recently as the
temperatures become more moderate, but don't know of any local (Fort Collins)
suppliers, etc.  Then I saw this address and noticed it was from Fort Collins
and wondered who was behind it.  Could you place me on the mailing list
and perhaps identify yourself for some short chit-chat some day?


Thanks,


        -Steve

Subject: Diacetyl Rest


  A couple of days ago I wrote about performing a diacetyl rest
  for use in lager beer production. Here is the specific information...


  This is called the Narzsis technique after it's author. Conduct your
  primary fermentation at 48 degrees F until you reach 67% attenuation.
  At this point raise the temperature to 65 degrees F and hold until
  the fermentation is complete. Reduce the temperature to 37.4 degrees
  F to lager.  This information was provided to me by Charlie Olchowski
  of the Frozen Wort in Greenfield, Ma. It is the recommended
  fermentation schedule for yeast #308.


  The article I referred to was published in the "Best of Beer and
  Brewing", Volumes 1-5 and written by Dr. Helmut Kieninger. The beer
  is fermented at 54 degrees F until the final attenuation point is
  approached, to an apparent extract value of about 2% by weight.  At
  this point the yeast is removed but the beer must remain at 54
  degrees for a minimum of 72 hours for diacetyl reduction. The beer is
  then cooled to 43 degrees F for a period of 12 hours and then the
  temperature is reduced to 32 degrees F for 3-7 days. (This procedure
  assumes that CO2 is added during bottling.)
