The only "problem" is the additional difficulty involved in
sanitizing and cleanup of the cooler.  The immersion-type
cooler gets automatically sanitized when you dip it in the
boiling wort, but you would have to run sanitizing solution
through the other-type of cooler.  Also, when you cleanup,
you will never know if you've cleaned all the wort
out of the tube, especially if you do non-whole-batch boils
(not the whole 5 gallons), since the wort will thicken as it
cools.

Sorry about all that junk cluttering up the digest the past few days.
Apparently, some systems don't have a clue about where to send bounced
mail. It's a good thing I just returned from my vacataion, since it
looked liked it was starting to snowball...
