Subject: Has anyone brewed their own "hop oil"?


I was talking to a friend the other day about boiling hops
to create a home version of hop oil?  Has anyone tried
this?  How long should the hops be boiled?  What is the
best way to store the resulting oil?

Subject: Sanitation and Yest Rehydration


I brewed up a new batch last weekend and tried the rehydration method
suggested on this BBS recently. While the water was heating I half
filled a measuring jar with warm water, added the yeast and covered the
jar with plastic wrap. The yeast acted as if I'd added it to wort
except (of course!) there was no foaming. Then after I'd boiled and
cooled the wort I pitched it.  It took much longer than usual to start -
I pitched in the evening and the next moring there were no signs of
activity. I thought it might be a bad batch - visions of pouring 5gal
of wort down the toilet sprang to mind! But I gritted my teeth and
waited, and around lunch time there was a good hed of foam - phew!
Fingers crossed it wasn't some other bug that found its way into the
fermenter. I guess I'll find out in a few weeks.


On sanitation, the last 3 or 4 batches I've brewed have all become very
fizzy in the bottle. They were fine for 2-3 months but now after
opening...  it's a gusher! Slight off flavour in some bottles too - the
dreaded infection I think. As I was brewing and reflecting my fate over
the weekend I realized that the earliest gushing batch coincided with
my purchase of a 'squoosher' type bottle cleaner. It's a plastic bowl
with a pump in the center, arranged so that putting a bottle upside
down over the neck of the pump and pressing it down causes a jet of
solution to squirt into the bottle. I've been using this instead of
soaking the entire bottle in solution. It would seem that it's not
enough to squoosh and drain, soaking is needed. so it's off to buy a
tub to soak in (the bottles, not me!).


Has anyone tried brewing a smoked beer? I tried a bottle recently and
really liked it. I'd be interested in how you smoked - the 'real' way
or (dare I say it) by adding liquid smoke.

Not to change the subject, but...


Spotted yesterday, Sunday, October 1, 1989, at approximately 1730,
traveling east on the Mass Pike at a high rate of speed, a New York
State license plate ZYMURGY (on a red and white Buick?).  Anyone
ever see this one or know who it is?


Any other interesting beer vanity plates out there?

Subject: Mashing


        I am going to make my first batch of all-grain beer soon.  I have been
        slowly collecting the equipment needed.  My plan was to use a single-
        stage infusion mash like the one described in the summer issue of
        Zymurgy.  I just went back and re-read Papazian's book to see what
        he had said and I got a bit confused.  From the Zymurgy article and
        personal correspondence, I have been led to believe that the single-
        stage was sufficient for beginners.  Fine.  I was ready to try my
        hand at mashing, so I looked for a recipe in Papazian's book.
        Some said to use the single-stage, and some said to use the temperature
        controlled method.  This is when I began to re-read his sections on
        advanced brewing.  It explained that the single stage mash was good
        for grains that are highly modified and the temperature controlled 
        mash is good for undermodified malts.  So, if I decide to use the
        single-stage exclusively, do I have to be concerned with purchasing
        ONLY highly modified malts ?  If I do, then how can I tell how
        modified the malt is ?  I purchased 10# of English 2 row.  From his
        book, my guess is that this is highly modified.

Please add my name to your homebrew mailing list. I'm a winemaker instead
of a brewer, but I understand both subjects are covered.


Thanks!
