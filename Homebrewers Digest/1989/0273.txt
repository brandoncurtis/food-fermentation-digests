My two cars have Massachusetts liscense plates HOPFEN and MALZ (German of
course for 'hops' and 'malt'.  You'd be surprised how many people (including
brewers) don't pick this up.) 


Another brewer in my club (Bill Murphy) has liscense plate HMBREW (at first
I thought it meant 'Her Majesty's Brew', but was told it was simply
'homebrew'). 


A homebrewer from Maine (John Seckler??) has a VW microbus with plate HMBRW.


While driving through New Hampshire this spring, I saw a Rhode Island plate 
HOPS.


I think I saw a few more beer plates at last winter's New England Regional 
Competition.  I'll keep my eyes open at the next regional pow-wow.

Subject:  modified malts again


Here's a quote from the transcript of Greg Noonan's (the decoction mash king)
1985 Hombrewer's conference talk about determining the modification of malt:


"British malt, which is commmonly referred to as "well-modified," is very well
sprouted to three-quarters of the full length of the grain.  If you cut away
the husk on the dorset side of the grain, you will see a white spear growing
from three-quarters to the full length.  Most of the world's brewers consider
British malt overmodified.  In comparison, American and continental malts are
less modified, showing growth from only one-half to three-quarters of the
grain.  Before you start mashing, you should examine your malt.  Take 20
kernels, find the more rounded, nonfurrowed, dorsal side, and cut it off or
rub it away to get an idea of what the conversion is.  From that, you can
decide what to do.  If they are well modified, you may need an infusion
mash.  But if they are undermodified or show a great variety of modification,
then use the step infusion of decoction mashing."


I would add that the temperature-controlled mash (sometimes called upward
infusion) can be substituted for the decoction mash.  If you think the former
is complex, read the directions for decoction mashing sometime.  Does anyone
out there actually do a full decoction mash a la Noonan?  I hear that this
guy is the lager guru -- do all you folks with lagering refridgerators go
whole hog with decoction mashing?  Are the advantages very noticeable?


Happy with my ales but curious,

Perhaps dry yeast should be reactivated in two steps: hydrate in pure
H2O, then add about the same amount of wart as yeast mixture and wait,
then pitch.  I havn't tried this, and I'm no microbiologist, so I
can't say if this will do any better than just hydrating with pure
H2O.

Subject: Maple syrup beer




I am contemplating creating a beer containing maple syrup, and was
wondering if anyone out there has tried and has any experience with
it which they would share.  Questions I have are:


        1) Ale or Lager?
        2) How much syrup should be used?
        3) What/How much hops should be used in the batch?

Subject:  Ithaca, NY homebrew scene


I'm moving to Ithaca, NY in about 6 weeks.  Can anybody from the area contact
me by e-mail and let me know what the scene is, i.e. is there a homebrew shop
nearby, a homebrewer's club, etc.?  I read in Zymurgy that a new brewpub
opened in Ithaca.  This leads me to believe there's a brewing community
there.


Thanks,
