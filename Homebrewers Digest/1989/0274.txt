Subject:      hard cider




With the coming of chilly nites one's thoughts start wandering to
changing leaves, fresh apples, and of course cider.  Does anyone
out there know some good recipies for making hard cider, or cider
based fermentables?  Is clear or unfiletered cider best?

Subject: Poll of Brewer's Choice users.




This is for all you Brewer's Choice liquid yeast users. What yeast #,
i.e. 1098 or whatever do you use for:


Lighter type ales, something with an O.G. of around 55 or less?


Medium ales, porters?


Stouts?


If you have other criteria for deciding which yeast to use for what, please
feel free to expound on that.


If I get a lot of Email, I will summarize and post.


                Thanks,

A friend just made up a maple syrup stout.  He used 6 lbs. of Australian
Dark Extract (syrup), 1 1/2 oz boiling hops (bullion), and 3/4 cup of
Maple syrup.  He just bottled, so I don't know how it'll turn out, but
he said that the bottling taste showed a lot of promise :-).

Subject: Clara Bell


I kegged my Clara Bell batch 4 days ago, filling a couple of Corona
bottles also, as I usually do so that I can check clarification
progress. You all may remember the Clara Bell batch as the one with a
pound each of cara pils an crystal malt with 7 pounds of light
unhopped syrup. A total of 1 1/2 oz Hallertauer hops was used in the
batch. Well, last night I couldn't wait any longer to taste it. So
even though it hadn't yet fully clarified my wife & I opened one of
the bottles, and it was _delicious_! It can best be described as an
Oktoberfest-style beer (Papazian describes these beers as expressing
themselves with a malty sweetness) even though it was brewed with an
ale yeast.


I will probably make this one with two oz. of hops the next time, but
this batch show promise for being wonderful as-is.

Subject: Porter Recipe


Some weeks ago I promised (threatened?) to publish my recipe for the
Porter I then had in the fermentor, if it turned out reasonably
well.  It did.  Here's the recipe:


                PARTIAL-MASH PORTER
                ===================
For a sweet, dark porter, best served warm on a cool afternoon.


                3 lbs 2-row pale (lager) malt
                10 oz black patent malt
                6 oz crystal malt
                4 lbs Australian dark (bulk) malt extract
                11 AAU Northern Brewer hops (8%)
                Doric yeast
                1/2 cup corn sugar (priming)


        Mash water: 6 quarts.
        Mash-in at 131-122F, stir 3 minutes.
        Mash pH 5.0-5.5; adjust with calcium carbonate or gypsum.
        Protein rest:  131-120F for 30 min.
        Starch conversion:  155F for 60 min.
        Mash-out:  168F for 5 min.
        Sparge:  2 gallons at 168-160F.
        Boil:  60 min.
        Hops:  one addition at start of boil.


The result is sweet, but very tasty.  My next batch of Porter will
be somewhat drier, trending toward stout.  Changes will include
using a less sweet extract (Scottish light), dropping the crystal
malt altogether, bumping the bittering hops up a point, adding an
ounce of Fuggles 10 minutes before the end of the boil for finish,
and going to Edme yeast, which I believe to be more attenuative. 
I'm also toying with the idea of adding 8 oz of wheat malt to
improve the less-than-impressive head, which is the only real defect
this beer seems to have, IMHO.  Enjoy!
                                                - Martin

Dear Brian,
I just returned late last night (Sat Oct 7) from a conference
on REAL ALGEBRAIC & ANALYTIC GEOMETRY held at C.I.R.M. =
Centre International Recontres de Mathematiques at the
Luminy campus of the University of Marseille, FRANCE,
where I presented a paper and mentioned your work with
Victor Zurkowski.  The Conf. was from Oct. 2 through Oct. 6
So, I just received your phone message, and will call you as
soon as I locate your phone number (I know I have it - yes,
there it is hanging on the wall!).  Victor may come for a visit
to UNL soon, and I plan to apply for money to invite you to
come in February.  Is that a good Month for you?
Olech will be gone by then, so I'll have more time for you.
Gary
