First: a warning. Clara Bell packs a sucker punch.


After downing two 16 oz glasses, I stood up and suddenly realized the
obvious: 6.5% is a _tad_ stronger than what you normally find in most
store-bought brew. 


Second: I was perusing my recipe book, and turned to the page
describing the second batch I ever made. I named it "Bitter Words",
and it was made from 5# light dry malt extract, 1.5# dark dry malt
extract, 1# dried molasses, 2 oz Northern Brewers, 1 oz Brewer's Gold,
and 1 oz Cluster, all for bittering, and 2 oz Fuggles for finishing.
That's right, six oz hops, most of it high alpha acid. Hey, I made
this batch back in June, 1985 when I new _nothing_ about making beer.


I put in in the secondary on June 27, bottled on August 6, and
impatiently waited a month before tasting. Come the appointed evening,
I eagerly poured the first glass, and tasted. "Damn", I thought,
"ruined." But I drank it anyhow.  "Wait a minute, maybe it's not so
bad", I said to myself as I drained the glass. "I'll try another." I
drank another. "You know," I mused, "This really isn't bad at all. I
think I'll taste another, just to be sure." I stood up, and my knees
buckled. 


As it turned out in the days to come, my wife & I came to regard
"Bitter Words" as one heck of a fine bitter.


Funny thing about history -- it does tend to repeat itself. Clara Bell
& I just had a similar encounter this evening. Not that I ever had any
doubts that the batch was good, mind you, however I was politely but
firmly reminded that a good strong homebrew can indeed pack a punch!
