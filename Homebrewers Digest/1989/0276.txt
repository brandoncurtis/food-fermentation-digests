-> 1) Ale or Lager?
-> 2) How much syrup should be used?
-> 3) What/How much hops should be used in the batch?
Last spring I brewed a mapple syrup ale and it was very nice.
A couple of notes for referance, in the Spring '89 Zymurgy (I think)
there was an article about a maple brew, also in the same issue was
a letter from a reader again about a maple batch both had recipes.
As for my batch I added 1 1/2 pints of fancy grade pure Maine syrup
(since that's what I had in the fridge) to a standard 6# light malt
batch. I don't have with be what I used for hops but I used something
on the lighter side so as to not over power the maple flavor. Although
the resulting ale was very good the maple flavor was missing. The moral
to this story is use more syrup and syrup of a darker grade than I used.
B or even C grade might work out better.


On a different note I have seen and heard conflicting info about the
equivilence of hop pellets versus dried brick packed hops. Is there an
oz for oz substitution or not?

Did I read that someone has produced an index for Papazian's
_The Complete Joy of Home Brewing_? If so, can someone please
tell me where I can get a copy.


-Thanks, Doug

What is the alpha level for hops? Also, what are the effects of
mixing Kent Golding and Nugget, say with alphas of 5.2 and 14.4
respectively, say in equal proportions. Surely it can't be the same
as putting in hops with alpha-level 9.8. Thanks, Mike Kahn

I'm compiling a list of what versions of news are in use by
what people. A summary will appear in news.admin in a month or so


(Conspiracy freaks will undoubtably believe this is a sleazy
way to increase uunet revenue...)
