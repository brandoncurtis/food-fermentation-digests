        Recently, I tried a variation of the Crystal Honey Lager
        recipe from CJOHB by adding the peels from 5 oranges to
        the boiling wort.  I boiled 4 of the peels for 30 min, and
        added the last orange during the last 5 minutes of the boil.
        The batch had a wonderful orange aroma during the boil and
        througout fermentation, but when I tasted the first bottle
        of it yesterday, it has absolutely no orange aroma or flavor!
        The beer has a slight bitterness, but you'd be pretty hard
        pressed to identify it as orange.  I was wondering if
        anyone has succesfully used oranges in recipes and what
        amounts and procedures were used.  For this recipe I was
        shooting for the light honey lager with a nice orange aroma
        and a subtle orange flavor.


        While we're on the subject of strange brews, anyone ever
        tried adding sasafras root to a recipe?  I'll know in 
        about 3 weeks how it tastes!

Subject: Starting Out


I am interested in starting to brew my own beer as well as possible
build a still.  Could anyone suggest a good book(s) to read  so that I
can get on my way?


Later,
