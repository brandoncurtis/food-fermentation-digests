>From The Washington Post (sometime around October 10th):


"The baseball season may be over in Baltimore but Oriole fans and beer lovers
can share another favorite American blast from the past until opening dayrolls around again next spring--drinking beer freshly brewed on the premises.


Sisson's restaurant on East Cross Street, a few blocks from the Inner Harbor, 
has become the first brewpub in Maryland.  Sisson's is serving golden and amberales, along with its existing list of about 60 specialty beers and a menu that features Cajun and Creole dishes and fresh seafood.


The modern, postprohibition brewpub trend started on the West Coast in the 
early '80s and now there are more than 120 in North America, primarily on the 
West Coast.  There is one brewpub in Virginia, the Blue Ridge Brewery of 
Charlottesville, but none in the district [District of Columbia], where they 
are illegal.


Sisson's will have some competition next month when the Baltimore Brewing 
Company is scheduled to open on Albemarle Street.  The BBC brewpub, to be ownedand operated by members of Europe's Grolsch brewing family, will be a 
German-style restaurant and serve a lager beer."

I had a disk crash this morning and as a result lost two days worth of
mail (among other things, like my temper). Would the person who was
kind enough to send me the index to Papazian's The Complete Joy of
Home Brewing mind sending it again?


I just _love_ spending four hours on a Saturday rebuilding & 
restoring :-( :-( :-( :-(
