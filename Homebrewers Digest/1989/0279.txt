Subject: Bottling problem?




I am quite new to this mail list and also to the homebrewing activity,
so please, forgive the "may be" stupid content of my questions.


First, I made my first batch a month ago, and bottled it 2 weeks ago.
I have used malt sugar as priming sugar (not corn sugar).


Something strange seems to happen. In each bottle there is a little
bit of "something" floating on the top of the beer (there is also a
deposit in the bottom, but that's suppose to be that way is not it?).


Does that means that my first batch has been infected with a wild
yeast? or is it normal (they are not mentioning this phenomena in the
Complete Joy of HB...)


My second question is about the second batch I brewed last week.
Contrary to the first one, I did not make it from a hop flavored malt
can but from the real stuff (barley, hops, etc). I strained the wort
while putting it in the carboy, but a quite big deposit (2-3 inches)
appears very quickly in the carboy (even before I added the yeast).
Should I transfer the beer in another carboy to prevent this deposit
to be in contact with the beer during the fermentation process, or is
it OK to leave it as it is until I bottle it (probably in a week)?


Thanks in advance,


Felix
