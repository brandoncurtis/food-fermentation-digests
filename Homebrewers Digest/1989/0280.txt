More likely bacteria or mold. Its difficult to tell from the description
(and sometimes even up close), but it could be something benign.
The best course is to taste it.  If it tastes good, drink it.  If not,
dump it.

The deposit is normal for a mash, and I'd be suprised if CJOH didn't 
mention it somewhere.  There are mixed opinions as to whether you 
should rack the wort off this sediment (called trub).  I usually do.
It would be better, however, to get your fermentation going as soon
as possible, rather than wait a day worrying about whether to transfer the
wort off the sediment.

          I boiled 4 of the peels for 30 min, and
           added the last orange during the last 5 minutes of the boil.
           The batch had a wonderful orange aroma during the boil and
           througout fermentation, but when I tasted the first bottle
           of it yesterday, it has absolutely no orange aroma or flavor!




        I have not brewed with orange peel, but I have cooked with it,
and I would say that the mistake was in adding it to the boil at all.
Orange peel has a bitter oil in it, which is long lasting, and the
delightful orange aroma, which is fleeting.  I'd think that the
"wonderful orange aroma during the boil" was *all* of the aroma, being
driven off.  Also, the white part of the peel has only bitterness,
only the orange part has that smell/flavor characterised as "orange."


        So I would recomend carefully cutting off just the outermost
layer of the peel, keeping the pieces as large as possible without
including any of the white, and then experimenting with dipping it
into the pot in a spice bag during the last minute of the boil, then
removing it, or adding it to the primary or secondary fermenter and
not boiling it at all.

Hi; I'm new to the list, so apologies if this has been asked recently, but
what are good ways to sterilize bottles and equipment?  I have friends
who are allergic to sulfites.

Subject: possible trouble with priming step


I've just bottled my first batch of beer, and I'm a little concerned about the
priming process.  I'm using a single fermentation system and, immediately
before bottling, I siphoned the wort into a clean container.  In order to
minimize the amount of sediment that I transferred to this container, I let the
first cup or so flow into a bottle that I later discarded.  I am now worried
that I did not transfer enough yeast to allow carbonation to occur.  Is there
any way, short of waiting for a week and opening a bottle, to determine if
carbonation is occuring?  If carbonation does not occur, can I prepare a yeast
solution and add a drop or so to each bottle, reseal and wait again?  Thanks in
advance,
                        Stuart

I arrived at Educom in Ann Arbor Michigan today, I was wondering if
anybody 
else on the list is here.   I would be glad to meet some evening and
discuss homebrewing.  Are there any neat breweries in the Ann Arbor area? 
if so please  let me know.
