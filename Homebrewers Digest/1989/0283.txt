The first half dozen or so batches I made were primed with corn sugar,
and had a faintly detectable sweet flavor I couldn't define.  "Cidery"
is as good a word as any to describe it.  I can't claim to have an
educated palate, but the sweetness didn't contribute to the enjoyability
of the beer.  So I experimented with priming with some of the original
"sweet wort" that I withheld before pitching.  It involves some
measurement and not a little care, but I've not had any problems with
uncarbonated beer nor with exploding bottles.  And the sweetness is
gone.

My first batches were notorious for this problem, partly because they
used far too much corn sugar in the wort, and the (faulty) instructions
I was brewing from [a sheet from the wine/beer supply place, and M.R.
Reese's "Better Beer and How To Brew It"] said to simply pour your hot
wort onto the sugar rather than include it in the boil.  At bottling time,
the cup of corn sugar I was adding made things worse.  My very first batch was
cidery for over 4 months.


 You don't mention whether you
boil the corn sugar or not;  I use corn sugar for priming, but always 
dissolve it in water and boil it for at least a couple of minutes.  This
sterilizes it, and seems to keep it from getting cidery.  I haven't had
a cidery batch of beer in a long time.  I suspect that the cidery flavor
is from wild yeasts camping out in the sugar bowl, the same dudes who 
provide us with apple cider.  (can anyone confirm or refute this?)


One further note:  provided the weather/storage place for newly bottled beer
is warm enough, your beer should be ready to drink after 7 or 8 days in the
bottle.  I didn't beleive this either until about a year ago, when after 
bottling a Nut Brown Ale in fairly warm weather, I popped one out of
curiousity.  It was great, though it will get a bit dryer in a short time.

Subject: It's the water?


I recently read a newspaper interview with the brewmaster at a local
micro-brewery here in San Diego.  In the interview, he claimed that
San Diego tap water (which is truly scummy) is great for brewing with.
He said that, in general, the more gunk is in the water, the better it is.
Now, I'm a neophyte to brewing, so I don't know if this is tongue-in-cheek
or not.  Any opinions?

Al Hainer reports excessive Hop Sediment in his fermenter -

All primary ferments have varying amounts of sediment on their bottoms.  As
the wort initialy cools (prior to fermentation), some trub (proteins, hop
resins, and other crap) fall out of solution.  During the fermentation,
some yeast settles out.  My experience is that the trub has much larger
volume than the settled yeast.  Some experts say that the wort should be
racked off the trub prior to yeast pitching, but I am not yet convinced
that this is necessary. 


Three inches of trub/yeast is probably okay, and shouldn't be a cause for
worry.  When bottling the beer, be sure not to get any of this material
into the bottles - if you ever tasted this stuff, you would consider giving
up homebrewing! 


Contrary to what the hop pellet packages may say, hops should be strained
out prior to fermentation.  An easy way is to fill the fermenter through a
mesh bag. Execesive hops in the ferment (especially 4 ounces of Bullions!)
will create a harsh bitter bite in the beer.  A stout will probably forgive 
you for this, but watch out with those light lagers!

  Could somebody familiar with Mead tell me what the proper serving
temperature should be? As over simplifying as this might be, I
need a single number that is the best tradeoff for all Meads. Thanks.

Subject: Cooling beer


  In about a week I'll be helping with a homebrew contest and I in
turn need some help from you Digesters that have massive or even
little bits of experience with contests.
  Here is the situation. My job is to get the entries checked in and
brought to the proper temperature prior to delivery to the judges.
Entries can be brought in as late as 90 minutes prior to the start 
of judging and might be in the 70-80 degree range at that point.
I have picnic coolers, ice, and lots of thermometers, including an 
IR pyrometer that is very fast and deadly accurate when pointed at 
a typical beer bottle. I figure the sins I want to avoid are as 
follows, in decreasing order of evil:


  1. Loosing a bottle's identity
  2. Breaking a bottle
  3. Disturbing the sediment
  4. Creating a chill haze
  5. Delivering the beer too cold
  6. Delivering the beer too warm


  OK, items 1 and 2 can be dismissed since if I do one of those
I'll just fall on my sword and not have to worry about the consequences :-)
Number 3 might be relevent to the discussion if I'm moving the bottles
around frequently but hopefully even in this case I would move them
very gently.
  Chill haze and any other bad effects of rapid over-chilling is what
I am concerned about. If it were not for this, I would plan on cooling
the beer as completely as possible by burying it in ice, then pull it
out and let it warm back up, giving each entry to the judges when it
had reached the "right" temperature. Doing it the other way, trying to
cool down to the "right" temperature appears to be out of the question
for a couple hundred bottles of beer for a number of reasons. Even if
I had extra arms I've determined that partial immersion in ice causes
radically uneven cooling. I've thought about ice-water mixtures but
only briefly.
  So I'm leaning toward a compromise in which the dark beers get warp
factor 9 and the pale beers get kinder treatment and then they are
all subjected to varying degrees of "warm and deliver" prior to 
judging. By kinder treatment I mean I'd try to segragate the pale beers
into categories like "already cold", "warm" etc. and just apply the
time in an ice bath needed to get each one to my 48 degree target.
But even so, 90 minutes is not long to shed 20-30 degrees and wouldn't 
you know it, those guys want to judge the pale beers first, so there isn't
room for much error.
  So I'm asking for your thoughts. And although I'm locked into the above 
constraints this time around I'd especially like to hear about better 
ways to do this in the future.  Thanks.

Subject: California: The ``Golden Beer'' State


I had lunch today at a local Pizza Place that happens to serve a good
number of beers brewed in California microbreweries.  As I was
leaving, I noticed that they had posted the center page of a recent
issue of "California Celebrator, Beer News Brewspaper" on their
bulletin board.


The section they posted was a map of California listing many (if not
all) of the breweries, microbreweries, brewpubs, and homebrew shops in
the state.  The article was titled:


                The ``Golden Beer'' State
        (A Guide To California's Beer Hot Spots)


I asked the proprietor if I could borrow the article, which I took
next door and photocopied.  After pinning the original back up on the
bulletin board, I rushed back to work and, with complete disreguard
for copyright law, transcribed the information into my computer.


The list was broken into 4 regional sections, which I intend to post
here starting Monday.  I will only post one section per day, as the
entire thing is nearly 500 lines long.


Some of the entries were very hard to read on my copy.  If anyone has
the original or otherwise notices an error, please bring it to my
attention so that I might update my copy.  Thanks, in advance.

I'd be interested in hearing about any experiences with
Papazians recipe for Holiday Cheer, ie faster than average
fermentations (or slower), aging times, or whatever
"stories" anyone has.  I started a batch last weekend and
by the smell during the boil am expecting malt flavoured,
carbonated orange juice, but then again, time can do strange
things.  Thanks.
