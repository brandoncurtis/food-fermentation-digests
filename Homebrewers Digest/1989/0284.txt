I've heard the same thing said with respect to the River Lithy(sp), from
which Guiness is made.

Subject: Checkoslovian Hops


A friend of mine is from Checkoslovia, and when I described to her the
home brew process, she said "I can have some Check hops shipped here
by my relatives. Are you interested?" When I quit salivating, I
assured her that I was _most_ interested. Yesterday, the package
arrived, with promises of more if desired. There were two 50 gram
paper bags labeled "Chmel", which I am told is Check for "hops". 


As I write this there is a batch of "Chmel" beer boiling in the pot
downstairs. I am making it with 6# light unhopped syrup, 1# wild
honey, and ~1.5 oz (~3/5 of the 50 gram bag) Chmel for boiling and the
rest for finishing. It tastes good & smells wonderful. I'll let you
know how the finished product turns out. 


I wonder what I should call this batch: Honey Checks, perhaps?
