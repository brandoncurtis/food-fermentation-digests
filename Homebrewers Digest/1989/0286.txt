Subject: Tragedy




Hi Folks,


Yesterday, I awoke to a noise that was kind of like a loud pop.
Then there was this interesting sound, like a water fall.


And as I slowly became more conscious, I remembered that I made some
barley wine the day before.  The horror, the HORROR!


So I raced to the kitchen to find my carboy spewing rawish wort
all over the place.  It looks like about a gallon of the wort had blown out.


I guess I was lucky to be around when it happened, because I was
able to replace the discharge tube, and clean things up before it soaked
into the apartment below.  I also added another gallon of spring water
to the carboy to replace the lost wort (risky, but I felt that since the
original spring water was ok, this would be also. Though the barley wine
would be weaker, 12 pounds of sugars as aposed to 15 at the start [see below],
it would still end up plenty strong.  As of this morning the yeast
is still very active, so I didn't shock it or anything).


So the BIG question I have is, how do I prevent this tragic event from
happening again?  Do I filter it better before it goes into a carboy?
What do you folks use?  Cheescloth?  Coffee filters?


Other questions that I've had lately:


1) Why does my specific gravity (measurements?) always come out
   much lower than number given in the recipe?
   For example,  barley wine I made had (with 5 gallons water) contained:
        12 pounds of California light malt extract syrup
         2 pounds honey
        0.5 pounds crystal malt
        1.0 cup chocolate  malt


   With this amount of ingredients I'd expect a specific gravity of
   over 1.100.  But my reading at 70 degrees F was 1.056!
   Lots of other times I've made worts which the s.p. comes out much 
   lower than that given in the recipe, 1.022 and I get 1.012,
   or 1.042 and I get 1.032.
   What gives?  Bad hydrometer?  Do different malts syrups contribute
   differently to the s.p?


2) For yesterdays barley wine I used champagne yeast.
   How will this effect the final flavor of the beer?


Thanks all,
John S. Watson

Subject: That's the Breaks!


Mike Kahn asked a few cogent questions in HBD 285:


"One, what is the difference between a bitter and a pale ale?"
The container, Mike.  A pale ale is, by and large, a bottled bitter.
The term "Bitter" generally is used (with a few notable exceptions,
such as Fuller's ESB) to denote a kegged or casked ale.


"Two, what is malt extract?"
Concentrated wort.  The major weakness in the process of brewing
with extracts is that we can't control either the composition or
process involved in producing the extract, which makes our final
result less predictable than if we were starting from grains alone.


"Three, what exactly is Irish Moss and what is its purpose?"
It is a species of algae, known to the processed food industry as
carageenan.  My understanding of its purpose is to enhance protein
flocculation, and possibly to aid in fining.  I've only used it
once, and it didn't seem to make enough of a difference (in fact, I
couldn't detect any difference at all) to justify fooling with.


In the same issue (one of the classics!), Patrick T. Garvin asked:


"Could someone post an explanation of what hot and cold breaks are?"
The breaks, as I understand it, are formed when protein clumps
("flocculates") and precipitates out of the wort.  Some of this
occurs during the boil (the "hot break", surprisingly enough), and
seems to need both the high temperature and the "kick" of a vigorous
boil to really do its thing.  A larger volume of flocculation (in my
batches, anyway) occurs when the temperature is reduced after the
boil, and the faster it's reduced the greater the (cold) break. 
These proteins are possible culprits in elusive "off" flavors, and
are definitely major causes of chill haze.  You're better off
leaving them in the bottom of the boiler.

>From: Mike Kahn <mike`at`stat.washington.edu>
>Subject: Some (hopefully) simple questions


>One, what is the difference between a bitter and a pale ale?


A bitter _is_ a pale ale. Pale ales are ales that are paler than
brown ales.  The two pale ales that come to my mind are: Bitters
and India Pale Ale or IPA.  The most concentrated description
of styles I've ever seen is in the National Homebrew Competition
entry form which can be found in several Zymurgy issues each year.


>Two, what is malt extract? For example, is light, unhopped malt extract
>simply concentrated light, dry malt? If not, what is different?


Dry malt extract is malt extract syrup without the water.
I don't know the exact percentages for conversion, but dry
malt extract has a little more fermentable sugar by weight
than syrup (because the water weighs a finite amount).
Personally, I use the two interchangably, pound-for-pound,
and don't worry about it.


>Three, what exactly is Irish Moss and what is its purpose?


I have no idea what Irish Moss actually is, but it's purpose
is to remove proteins from your wort so you don't get chill
haze in your finished product.


Sorry, I have no expertise with spiced beer.

The reason that oxidation is not a problem is not because the
wort is cool, rather because before yeast goes into its fermentation
stage of life, it goes through a respiration stage during which it
NEEDS oxygen.  Boiling drives off oxygen (and all other dissolved 
gasses, for that matter) so that you need to aerate your wort before
pitching your yeast.  After fermentation begins, you then need to
be careful to not introduce oxygen.

Subject: Can yeast act on jelatin (sp?)


I have a question posed by a fellow homebrewer who doesn't have
access.  He had a batch that brewed in the cellar for some time (I
can't remember how long) when he thought fermentation had slowed enough
he brought it upstairs and put some jelatin (sp?, to clear it up) in
it.  After he did that it continued bubling for the next few weeks and
he's wondering if the yeast could be acting on the jelatin or if it
might be dangerous to drink the beer now.  Any info?

What kind of glue do you use to put label on your bottles?


Last night I tried a mix of water and floor, but it does not work very
well.


Thanks in advance,
