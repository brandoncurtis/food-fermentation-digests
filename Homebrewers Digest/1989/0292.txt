A quick comment on Bud Dry:


>H.David Scarbro writes that in competition:


>Dry Beer
>Gold   Bud Dry, Anheuser-Busch Inc, St. Louis, MO


>I thought that they made Michelob Dry and not Bud Dry.


Yes, Bud Dry is correct.  AB has just started brewing it soley at their
Fort Collins, CO plant.  Currently, it's being test marketed in 3 areas,
1 of which is Colorado (I don't think New Hampshire is one of the 3).
The AB rep at the GABF said it would probably go national in about 1 year.
If you ever drink "American Pilsner" style beer, I'd recommend giving Bud Dry
a try.  I call it "the most drinkable beer," which really means it's the
most neutral.  It has very little taste and in this style category,
that's good.  For example, Coors Light and Miller Lite have little taste,
but the tastes that they have (like old pennies) are bad.  I consider Bud
Dry to be slightly better than Mich Dry, and it's cheaper!

They did have a Marzen beer that the rep said was only sold in the St. Louis
area, although I can't recall what they called it.  I didn't taste it 
either so I don't know whether or not it's any good.

Subject: Money makes the world go-around...


Granted i am getting into the brewing world because I 
enjoy a good brew and the satisfaction
of making my own is worth the trouble and failures.
But why do i have to pay so much??
My allowance isn't so great sometimes.
The question is; where do you get the good deals on supplies?
Can I get them wholesale or below, are there bulk discounts
if I can gather interest on an order?
Help!!!!

Here's a simple one; what's the best way to grab a sample out of a
glass carboy for SG testing?

I am the beer drinker in the house, my wife is the wine drinker.
We have agreed to start our brewing endevors with beer. Later
we will try our hand at wine. In between we are considering Meads.
Has anyone out there delved into this faction of zymurgy?
We are in search of details, recipes and stories. I love stories.
Thanx

Hello, all!


I will be visiting friends in the Denver, CO area (specifically, I'll be
staying in Castle Rock) from 14 Nov to 29 Nov.  Anybody got any suggestions as
to: 


        1) Area pubs to try;


        2) Local/regional beers to seek out and try.


I'm fairly certain that I'll be wandering around quite a bit, and will be
hitting the Boulder area for sure, so feel free to include suggestions over a
fair geographic area.


Please send your ideas to me at the address(es) below, so as to avoid adding
unneccessary length to the digest.


Thanks!!

Subject: Gluing your labels


Ah yes, the old label controversy.  I use musilage, which applys pretty 
easy from the rubber tipped bottle, and is water soluable.  My roommate
used to use 3M industrial spray glue, which is not so easy to get off
again.  These days I only use labels for display purposes, preferring to
spend my time brewing rather than scraping.

Since I was one of the lucky volunteers to help unload the beer truck, I can 
verify that there really was Bud Dry there.  It is a new product that they are 
marketing.  Since I am not into tastless beers, I did not try any.

I was also lucky enough to snag some of the Marzen before it was all gone.  I 
liked the flavor and was surprised that it came from Anheuser Busch.  I also 
learned that the difference between the "Bud" class beers and the "Busch" 
class beers is that one uses rice as an adjunct and the other uses corn.

(I tried sending this a week ago with no luck.)


I just capped off a perfect weekend of beer drinking by stepping outside my 
office and whatching the space shuttle land.


Those of you who missed the Great American Beer Festival this past weekend in
Denver, missed out on a chance to taste regional beers from all over the 
United States.  Almost every state was represented.  Many different styles of 
beer were available for tasting.  There were about 300 different beers to be 
tasted in only 9 hours!  Needless to say, I didn't get to taste them all.  I 
think that the festival should be 3 days instead of only 2.  Most of the beer
was only available in the region it came from or only at the brewpub it was
made.  I found that my favorites were from Alaskan Brewing in Juneau, Alaska
and the Rogue Ales from Bayfront Brewing in Newport and Ashland Oregon.  
Deschutes Brewpub in Bend, Oregon also makes great beer.


This year, the beers were separated into 2 different rooms for bottles and
draft. There were so many people there, that a lot of them didn't make it into
the draft room or know it was there before the voting ended.  Only 1 beer from
the draft room got an award even though the beer there tasted fresher and
better than the bottled beer.  Of course the parties in the hotel rooms
afterwords were great, especially Saturday night to try and finish off the
leftovers in the kegs! 


No visit is complete without going to Old Chicago in Boulder for Pizza and 110
different beers to choose from.  Liquormart in Boulder was another Mecca with
a giant walk in beer refrigerator with 100's of brands of beer.  They even
sell homebrew supplies there! 


As for the question on temperatures to serve mead, I treat it like white wine 
and drink it cold from the refrigerator.

        Subject: American beers
        
        Seriously, I don't know why, but I can't drink Bud, Miller,
        Stroh's or Coors.  I've thrown up every time I've tried to
        drink Bud in the last 3 or so years (no, I wasn't drunk either!)
        except for those times I gagged before I could get it down. 
        Miller and Stroh's set my gag reflexes going; Coors sometimes
        does, too.  I wouldn't care about this (I don't choose to drink
        these beers), but I'm sometimes thrown into awkward social
        situations where I'm expected to drink them.  Could somebody
        who knows what these beers have in common that makes me ill
        when I drink them?  I don't have this problem with Michelob,
        Henry's, or any of the "premium" beers.
        
Congratulations!  Your body has developed an automatic gag reflex.
When your tongue's taste buds come in contact with any one of the
cheap beers, your body knows that this is a trash beer and will not
accept it.  However, you seem to have a normal reaction to the
'premium beers' and probably have a similar normal reaction of
acceptance with microbrewer's and homebrewers beers as well.  So,
don't worry, relax, you have an educated palate!


In social situations, you can yell at the of your voice: "Who's
the jerk that's serving this p*ss-water!!!" and throw the
offending brew at the nearest wall whenever you get a cheap beer.
Or, you can refrain from drinking beer and have a soft drink or
carbonated water or...  Or, you can be very, very generous and
buy enough 'premium beer' for everyone (or at least for yourself
and then hoard your personal stash).
