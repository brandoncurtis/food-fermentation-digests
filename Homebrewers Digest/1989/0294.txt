I noticed that Anchor Steam took a gold for their Christmas Ale in the
Herb Beer category at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver.


I had a bottle of this a few weeks ago, and it was very good. Does
anybody know what their recipe is?

Good morning Homebrewers,


   I just read the note about Brew Pubs in the Monterey area and how they
fared the earthquake.  I thought our local pub was already open and so I
gave them a call.
   The Fromt Street Pub, Santa Cruz Brewing Co. has servived the Earthquake
and is up and running!


Keep brewing,
Doug Patten
