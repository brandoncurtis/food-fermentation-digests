Subject: Where to find supplies in or around Geneva


Does someone have a solution to my problem of locating a homebrew supply store
or mail order house in or around the Geneva area? To date I have had no
success in locating anyone who deals in or with Switzerland. I have consulted
the yellow pages, called EDME and few other manufacturers too. 


Alternatively does someone know of an French or English mail order house that
I might be able to use (a bit costly but better than nothing). 


Thanks in advance.

I do something similar to this. I write the bottling date on a 1/2 x 3/4
inch self-adhesive label (similar to an address label - available at any
office supply store), which I place on the bottle cap. I used to simply
mark the bottle cap itself, but that can be difficult to read if you're
using surplus soft drink caps.

Can anyone recommend a good source of mash recipes?


Thanks, Doug

Filters will _not_ remove dissolved lead, and I'm not sure RO will either.
Whether or not you actually have have unacceptable levels of lead in your
water, given that your water pipes are lead, is a function primarily of the
chemistry of your water (ph, mainly). I strongly suggest you have your water
checked for lead content, because lead is very toxic.

I'd be hesitant to drink the water, much less make beer with it.

Well, we just bottled our second batch (a dark this time) and we're just about
to start our third.  Also, I just started two gallons of wine (from
concentrate) and I can't believe how vigarously it's fermenting.  Anyway,
we're coming to the conclusion that this hobby isn't as inexpensive as we
thought it would be.  The wine concentrate was $12 (to make two gallons of
wine) and malt extract is over a dollar a pound. 


So my questions to the list are:


What's a more reasonable way to get malt extract?
Where's a good place to get malted barley?  What does it cost?
How much malted barley replaces how much malt extract?
What's a good way to get grape juice for winemaking?  $12 for concentrate
is too much.


For those in the Bay area, my experience has been that going to Beer Makers of
America seems to be cheapest, if you can ignore the owner's surliness (and if
you already know what you want; he has no patience for customers with
questions).  He charges 10% extra for mail-order, so you have to go to the
store to get the decent prices.

Well, I finally aquired all the hardware to put a batch to the test. My first
endevour will be a simple Pale Ale But, being one to continually overstep my
means, I am in search of recipes. 
Does any one have a favorite recipe???
One that is truly inspiring, which keeps the interest in brewing at it's peak.
A recipe that keeps the neighbors coming over to "socialize". 
I have begun a recipe book, broken into catagories, Holiday, Ales, Lagers etc
etc. eventually I hope to personally test and evaluate all the recipes I
accrue. 
If the interest is out there I will publish my findings in an organized manner
once I get it organized. 
Thanx
for the input
Jim

Fellow Beer Lovers -


I made a minor typo in my description of the beer date decoder.
Change the '12' in the day code to a '16'.
Sorry 'bout that.


Clarification: the year field produces only the last digit of the year.


Have fun.
