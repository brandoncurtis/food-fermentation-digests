Subject:  cheap grain source, Zymury yeast issue


Another cheap source for grain arrived in the mail yesterday: Green Acres in
Esko MN.  I don't have the address on me, but I think they advertise in the
Classified section of Zymurgy.  I'll post the address tomorrow.  They sell
most grains in #50 bags for $27-33 ($0.54-0.66) plus shipping.  Wow -- 2-row
Klages for $28/#50!  They also sell bulk malt extract fairly cheaply.  (I've
never use this supplier, but they're from Minnesota, so they MUST be
wholesome and honest).


So, how do people get away with selling malt for 1.50/lb, as I've
occasionally seen?  Let's imagine they
are getting it for $20/#50.  Selling it at $1.50/lb is a 360% markup.
Somebody's getting ripped off here.  While I understand why homebrew shops
(storefronts) need to mark-up more than mail-orders (and I've supported them
when they are within 30 miles and don't try to sell me brown, cheesy hops),
this kind of pricing inevitably drives all-grain mashers like myself into the
arms of mail-order houses and my friendly local brewer for the main
ingredients of my beer.


With regards to the Zymurgy special yeast issue:


> In the mail the other day, I received a special edition of Zymurgy,
> which is devoted entirely to yeast!  I haven't read it all yet, but
> there is some eye-opening information in there, particularly the tables

I agree -- lot's of late night reading and learning.  The review of the dry
yeasts and descriptions of various liquid strains' characters was great.  Also
interesting was the article by the guy who uses blocks of Fleischmann's for
lagering.  Has anyone tried this yet (seems hard to believe)?

Subject: Re: Water quality?


I have been brewing in Princeton, NJ for several years; all brews from local
water (otherwise unpurified) had unpleasant defects.  I will not use Princeton
water under any circumstances.  Now, I got a water analysis from the water
company (samples taken at the plant) and there was nothing amis (judging from
the discus- sion in Noonan's book); maybe its "in the pipes".  But anyway,
unless you want to reverse osmosis and then carbon filter, I'd buy the bottled
(and even then . . .) 


The water sold by many of the local supermarkets (e.g. SuperFresh) is bottled
by Wissahickon in PA.  I wrote them for an analysis just to get the mineral
contents right, so I knew how to adjust for brewing a Pale. 


By the way, after seeing what it did to my beer, I won't *drink* the tap water
either. 


P.S.  I usually do grain/extract brewing, and boil a large fraction of the
wort and then boil the rest of the brewing water for 20 mins. So the bad
results from local water were not caused by bacteria in the water supply (I
think).

Subject: Is homebrew a bargain?


The last batch I made, an all-grain Porter supposedly very much like Anchor
Steam's Porter, cost me $14.26 for the five gallon batch, or about $1.68
per six-pack. Compare that with about $5.00 per six for the Anchor variety.

Most interesting! Another note to the mystery: The label on the bottle that I
had stated "Christmas Ale, 1986". Now This certainly wasn't three year old ale
that I was drinking: it was fresh and delicious! The friend who brought the
beer over to my house (three weeks ago) purchased it at a local liquor store
here in Los Alamos, a place not widely known for it's diversity of consumer
goods.

I've never bothered to boil my caps, but instead soak them too in the bleach
solution. Have had no problems, and it sounds much simpler... 


Why is this never mentioned in the books? Any suggestions? (or have I just been
lucky? :-)

On the subject of all grain brewing.
How much is enough?
If a recipe calls for 6# of extract and I don't want to use extract, how many
# of grain do I start with? 


Tonight is the night !!
We are going to start our very first batch. Wish us luck!
Thanx

No, I don't feel that you are making too much of this.  Beer is 95% water and
as we all know, "Garbage in, garbage out."  The water company analysis will
let you know if your water is too soft or hard and if you can doctor it for
the particular style of beer you plan to make (ales are traditionally made
from hard water - because that's what they had, and lagers form soft water -
because that's what they had). 


On the other hand, however, I used to buy distilled bottled water and then add
Burton Water Salts to get the hardness right.  However, the tap water here in
the Chicago area is (I've been told, very neutral - flavorless and not too
soft or hard) so I've switched to boiled, chilled tap water and have had no
ill effects.  The general rule is: if it tastes good before it's made into
beer, chances are it will not give your beer off-flavors.

Subject: #298, Geordie Bitters Woes


In # 298, Lance "Turbo" Smith questions the goodness of his batch of Geordie
Scottish Ale.  A similar thing happened to me last summer.  I had a great
looking batch of Geordie in the carboy glubbing away when my wife talked me
into ripping up the kitchen for a remodelling job.  Two months later, I dusted
the sawdust off the carboy, racked it into the big fermenter, mixed in a cup
of corn sugar, and bottled it.  It required many days for carbonation to start
again (probably due to dormant yeast), and after carbonation, the brews tasted
sour, dry, and lifeless.  I didn't however have a bodacious amount of carbona-
tion as did Lance's batch.  I had used dry yeast at the time, but can't recall
which one.  After that experience, I decided that remodelling kitchens is bad
for beer brewing and promised never to interrupt brewing for home repair again.

Subject: Kegging


I have just started kegging my beer using 5 gallon syrup canisters.  Does anyone
know of an inexpensive source of new and/or used kegs?  I recently received a
catalog from Braukunst which seems to have pretty decent prices as well as a
wide variety of kegging related merchandise, but I was wondering if anyone has
had any luck getting kegs from a local soft drink bottler/supplier.

What's this talk about bargains???


How much is you're time worth, anyway?  If you consider that it takes at
least 3 to 4 hours to brew from extract, your best bargain is to get a
weekend job and use the extra income to buy good comercial beer.


If what you want is to save money on ingredients, then brew all-grain, but
that cost you a couple extra hours.  If you don't care about quality, then
dry yeast is a fraction of liquid and table sugar is less than 40 cents a
pound.


I don't homebrew to save money.  I homebrew for the satisfaction of
making great beer.

I would like someone who has the back issues of the Homebrew Digest saved to 
please send me #'s 294 and 295.  I only received a partial copy of 294.  I 
have contacted a few other folks who have the same problem.  Thanks.
