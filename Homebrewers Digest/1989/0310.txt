In HBD #309, dsbaer`at`EBay.Sun.COM (David Baer) wonders:
> My only question is what is the starting gravity for your starter wort?


The Fall 1987 issue of Zymurgy had a special section on yeast, with lots of
information about this sort of thing.  In an article on yeast culturing, Gary
Bauer recommended using "half-strength wort" (SG around 1.025) as a starter. 
Other articles I've seen also recommend using a starter medium that is less
than full strength. 


For starting my Wyeast, I always use 2.5 to 3 oz. of dry light malt extract in
1 quart of water.  I add one hop flower (for reasons probably based on
superstition) and boil for 10 minutes.  Then I put the lid on the pan, remove
it from the heat, and let it cool for 30 minutes.  At that point, it can be
transferred to a small glass bottle and capped with a fermentation lock.  I
set the bottle in a sinkful of cold water until it has cooled to pitching
temperature, then I pour in the Wyeast. 


I normally make the starter on Thursday, and then I use it on Saturday or
Sunday.  It works great every time. 


One great thing about using a starter with Wyeast is that it protects you from
the uncertainty of how long it's going to take that foil pouch to puff up.

Subject: labels for bottles


On the subject of labels:


I've been doing a good bit of research on the subject. I had originally
thought of doing a Zymurgy article on labels. John Polstra suggested Avery
removable labels (type S-3232, 2" X 2"). I can't find this number in my
listings, so a potential warning might be in order: If these labels are not
specifically designed for high temperature use in either xerographic copiers
or laser printers, DON'T use them in a laser printer - you could ruin it! 


The Avery number I have here for 2.75" square laser labels for 3-1/2" disks is
5196. However, there is a better product, though more expensive. 


Williams & Macias produces Laser Labels for disks that are removeable, and
have a glossier, burnished surface. They are more resistant to liquids,
removable even after you get them wet (if you let them dry), and the plastic
"ink" of xerography is not affected by bleach, even though the label will get
yellowed, allowing multiple uses. They also have less of a dimensional change
due to wetting, reducing the wrinkling most labels experience. The labels come
6 per 8.5" x 11" page, so you can design out to the borders of the labels.
Laser printers that are dirty or full of paper dust will have real problems
aligning the label sheets, though. 


Williams & Macias, PO Box 19206, Spokane, WA 99219, (800) 752-4400. I order
them from MacConnection for overnight delivery. (800) 622-5472. They cost
$20-22 for a pack of 216 labels (36 pages), as I recall. 


I tend to make mini Christmas cards on them, and give my Restorative Stout out
with customized labels as a gift (to those select friends who appreciate
homebrewed stout).

WORLD BEER REVIEW (WBR) is an excellent 'no-frills' brewing magazine published
by Steve Johnson from the campus of Clemson University.  BREWNET just received
the Nov/Dec issue covering the following topics - 


 * Thomas Hardy's Ale       * National Beer Event Catalog
 * Oregon Beer Festival     * Allegheny Brewery
 * Pilsner Urquell (review) * Pilsner Urquell (recipes!)
 * Beer Ratings (including Big Jug & Milwaukee Light) ???


One of the freebies worth mentioning is a blurb for an illustrated 12-page
booklet on beer history & folklore available from:


               The Beer Institute
               1225 Eye Street NW
