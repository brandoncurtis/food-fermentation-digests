Subject: viruses in beer?


Mary Albini writes:
"will this beer harbor viruses?"


Beer is generally a very poor carrier of diseases. In "Malting and Brewing
Science" by Hough, Briggs, Stevens, and Young, there is a chapter on 
Microbiological Contamination (Chapter 21).  To quote from this chapter,
"Pathogenic micro-organisms fail to grow in beer, or even survive for
extended periods."  The book goes on to say that there is only a narrow
range of microorganisms that can survive a short time in beer, among these
yeasts, a few bacteria that produce those nasty off-flavors, and some
molds.


Viruses can only replicate in certain types of single cells, and its highly
improbable that any virus can grow in a beer.  If you're reeally worried
about it though, let the batch age a little longer and let the alcohol
kill off whatever might be lingering.

No known pathogens can survive in a beer-strength alcohol environment.

I'll qualify that by saying that I read it someplace ;-)

Subject: List of brewpubs


I promised some time ago to compile a list of brewpubs if others would send me
data on them.  I apologize for taking as long as I have, but I've finally
gotten the list in some kind of order. 


I cannot vouch for the accuracy of very much of the information contained
herein; in fact, there are likely some microbreweries and non-brewpub bars
listed as well as straight brewpubs.  In addition, one of the sources appeared
to have been scanned in, with numerous instances of dropped or altered
characters.  Use the list with caution. 


If you have corrections or additions, send them directly to me at
thode`at`nprdc.navy.mil, since I am going to be forced to stop subscribing to the
homebrew digest. 


The following individuals (and probably others I have lost the references
to) provided information that appears in the list.  The commentaries
sprinkled throughout the list are theirs:

Here's the list...


                                     USA


Alaska -- Douglas:
  Chinook Alaskan Brewing and Bottling Co. - 1407 5th St.


California -- Arcata:
  Humboldt - 856 10th Street, Arcata.


California -- Berkeley:
  Triple Rock - Shattuck near University, Berkeley.  "This is one of the 
    best around.  Several excellent beers; they also usually have a 
    specialty brew available. The selection varies, but they always have 
    at least an amber and a dark.  Recommended!"
  Golden Gate Brewery - Near the waterfront.  "Very big place with 
    progressively designed interior.  Beer is good, but not very hearty.  
    Pub Atmosphere."
  Thousand Oaks Brewing Co. - 444 Vassar Ave.  Capacity:  387 barrels. 
    Thousand Oaks Lager, Golden Gate Mat Liquour, Golden Bear Dark Mat 
    Liquor, Cable Car Classic Lager.
  Bison - 2598 Telegraph.


California -- Boonville:
  Buckhorn Saloon/Anderson Valley Brewing Co. - on Highway 126 between 
    Hopland and Ft. Bragg, not far from Hopland).  "I've only had their 
    beer bottled (26 oz. bottles). The pub looked nice but I didn't have 
    time for a beer. The beer is very good; they make a Porter, an Amber, 
    a light beer, and a wheat beer which I haven't tried.  The others are 
    all excellent, especially the porter - dark and smooth, almost creamy, 
    yum yum!  Their beer is available all over the Bay Area in bottles.  
    I highly recommend it."


California -- Calistoga:
  Calistoga Inn - 1250 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga.


California -- Chatsworth:
  Angeles Brewing Co. - 10009 Canoga Ave.

    Ivanhoe Ale, Lion Hearted Ale (Seasonal) Excalibur Stout.
  Sierra Nevada - Well-known microbrewery in Calif., brewpub open late '89.


California -- Davis:
  Back Alley - 139 G Street, Davis.


California -- Emeryville:
  The Emeryville Brew Co. - The Bay Area's newest brewpub.

California -- Emile (?):
  Golden Pacific Brewing - 5515 Doyle St.


California -- Eureka:
  Lost Coast - 617 4th Street, opening late '89.


California -- Fort Bragg:
  North Coast - 444 North Main Street.


California -- Fremont:
  Brewpub on the Green - 3350 Stevenson Blvd.


California -- Fresno:

California -- Hayward:
  Buffalo Bill's - B Street & 2nd street.  Own beer plus Sierra Nevada 
    and others on tap Darts, pub food.


California -- Hollister:
  San Andreas Brewing - at 737 San Benito St in Hollister, about 45 minutes 
    east of Monterey.  "Their Earthquake Pale Ale had no head to speak of 
    but combined some nice malt and very hoppy bouquet.  The Seismic ale 
    was very fruity and harked back to some of the Lambics.  It was made 
    using some wild NY yeasts.  The earthquake porter had its taste 
    softened a touch by  the coffee and chocolate complexities brought to 
    the roasted malts.  The Kit Fox Amber had a fruity aroma, medium body, 
    no head but was a nice hop and malt blend.  Now, the Cherry Ale was a 
    definite throwback to the Belgian styles with serious cherry in the 
    bouquet and the taste but was an interesting addition to the four 
    other offerings."  (Not hurt seriously by quake damage, despite being
    near its epicenter.)


California -- Hollywood:
  Gorky's II - 1716 North Cahuenga Blvd.


California -- Hopland: 
  Mendocino Brewery - "A very nice pub with good home brewed beer.  Their 
    beer is superb, especially draft Red Tail Ale.  The original California 
    Brew Pub.  Peregrine Ale and Eye of the Hawk (seasonal) are excellent.  
    Live music, indoor and outdoor (in a hops garden) seating and good food."


California - Larkspur:
  The Marin Brew Co. - Larkspur Landing.  "Very good!  One of the best 
    around.  Large place, good pub food.  The amber and porter are both 
    excellent, the wheat beer was good but too light for my taste.  
    Recommended."


California - Lebec:
  Grapevine - 658 Lebec Road.


California -- Los Angeles:
  John Bull Pub - 958 South Fair Oaks Ave.
    (Fair Oaks south from 210, or turn left off the end of the Pasadena
    fwy 2 blocks to Fair Oaks right).  
  Gerky's Russian - 536 East 8.
  Los Angeles - 1845 South Bundy in West LA (opening '89).


California -- Mammoth Lakes:
  Mammoth Lakes - 170 Mountain Blvd.


California -- Modesto:
  Stanislaus Brewing Co., Inc. - 3454 Shoemaker Ave.  Capacity: 5,200 barrels. 
    St. Stan's Altbier (Amber and Dark).


California -- Monterey:
  Monterey Brewing - at 638 Wave St in the Cannery Row district of Monterey.
    "It is a small stand-alone building and a night time rock and roll bar.
    It featured a pale ale that was very hoppy.  Their Amber was a
    wonderful brew of roasted and had a hint of caramel flavor.
    Their porter was nearly opaque and the malt flavor practically 
    separated in your mouth for easy evaluation.  Wonderful!"  (Not damaged
    by recent earthquake.)


California -- Mountain View:
  Tied House - Villa St.  "Yuppie to the core, too much so for my taste. 
    First time I went the beer was mediocre, since then it's been much 
    better.  They have a light, amber and dark all the time, and one or 2
    specialty brews that vary. The light's too light for me, and the amber 
    is pretty light too. The dark is what I would call an amber; both the 
    amber and dark are OK, but unmemorable."


California -- Napa:
  Willett's - 902 Main Street.


California -- Nevada City:
  Nevada City Brewing Co. - 75 Bost St.


California -- Oakland:
  Pacific Coast - 906 Washington Street.


California -- Palo Alto:
  Lancashire Tavern -
  Gordon Biersch brew pub - California St (south of University a few blocks).
    "It's a restaurant rather than a pub.  They have a Maerzen and an
    Oktoberfest (not really, it's too light to be called that) both of 
    which I liked. Pretty good food.  Overall nothing special.  3 to 5 
    varieties of homebrew, depends on day & season."


California -- Pasadena:
  Crown City - 300 Sourth Raymond.


California -- Sacramento:
  Hogshead Brewing Co. - 114 J Street.
  Rubicon Brewing Co. - 2004 Capitol Avenue.


California -- San Diego:
  Old Columbia - in downtown San Diego.  "The first brewpub in San Diego.
    It has taken the path to long-term success (I suppose) by catering 
    to the yuppie crowd, and their market research must have worked, 
    because the place is always crowded.  The beer isn't bad, but it's 
    a little lacking in character.  A glass wall separates the dining 
    area and brewery, where the tanks and other equipment are visible."
  Mission Brewery - scheduled to open Feb. '90.  "The brewmaster went 
    through a previous incarnation in a back-alley place in Fallbrook 
    (50 mi. north).  I liked his beer there better than Old Columbia's; 
    it had a better flavor and a bit more hops bitterness.  He's 
    currently making beer to sell in 3-4 restaurants around town.  The 
    on-site place is part of a renovation of an old (70 years ago) 
    brewery building near Pacific Highway and Washington St. into 
    a brewery/office/shop complex."


California -- San Francisco:
  San Francisco Brewing Co. - Columbus Ave (near Broadway).
    "Not bad. Nicely decorated and a good atmosphere. Not too Yuppie! 
    The beer's pretty good but not as good as Triple Rock. They've
    only once had an amber, usually it's 2 lager's and a porter. The
    porter's pretty good.'
  Sea Cliff Cafe - 1801 Clement.


California -- San Jose:
  Winchester Brewing Company - "They have three brews, a pale ale, 
    an amber ale, and a stout.  For $2.50, you can get a "sampler", a 
    small glass of each ale.  Operated by a Chinese family so food is 
    Chinese influenced.  Their beers are not hearty--rather thin, but their
    Pale Ale is the hoppiest beer around.  Their "Porter" is so thin that 
    light can shine through it."
  Biere Brasserie - 33 East San Fernando St.  Capacity: 1,000 barrels.


California -- San Luis Obispo:
  SLO Brewing - 1119 Garden Street.


California -- Santa Cruz:
  Front Street Pub (Santa Cruz Brewing) - at 516 Front Street in Santa Cruz.
    "It a nice western pub atmosphere, good bar food and Lighthouse Lager.
    Although it was slightly cloudy and the slightest yeast and dyacitil
    in the taste, I rated it a 40. The Lighthouse Amber had a perfect
    copper color and loses a point on body but has terrific drinkability.
    Their Pacific Porter was a sterling application of roasted malt.
    They had bottles to go."  (Out of action temporarily after recent
    earthquake.)
  Sea Bright Brewing Company - at 519 Sea Bright.  This was a more modern 
    type of a well lit bar and seemed to cater to a young crowd. I tried 
    their sampler which included Pelican Ale, a hoppy ale with a rocky 
    head and wonderful aftertaste.  The Sea Bright Amber was unfiltered 
    and therefore a touch cloudy and yeasty but while the hops dominated 
    the aroma, the taste was more balanced.  Their Batman's Best Bitter 
    was crystal clear, a bit weak on body but the final rating was 
    identical to the Amber.  They also had Kangaroo Pale Ale which 
    contains only 1.5% alcohol.  It was maltier, sweet, had a slight 
    green apple smell and taste and wasn't a great beer."  (Survived 
    recent earthquake without major damage.)


California -- Santa Monica:
  City of Angels Pub/Brewery - opened in Jan.  Brewing and serving Heavenly 
    Gold, Angel Amber, City Light, and one seasonal beer.


California -- Santa Rosa:
  Kelmer's Brew House - Ale, lager, stout, and sometimes porter, all good.
    "This is very new place, refectory tables and darts are the atmosphere."


California -- Truckee:
  Pizza Junction - 11401 Donner Pass Road.


California -- Walnut Creek:
  Devil's Mountain Brewery - on N Main St.  "The Devil Mountain is a 
    'classier' place without being snobbish and brews 6 beers at the 
    moment.  I recommend their Hexenbock Lager as perhaps one of the 
    best lagers I have tasted, I'm not a real lager fan though.  I suspect
    it is one of those love/hate brews as it does have an unusual taste."


California -- Woodland:
  Dead Cat Alley - 666 Dead Cat Alley.


Colorado -- Boulder:
  Boulder Brewing Co. - 1880 Wilderness Place?


Colorado -- Denver:
  The Wynkoop Brewery - The first brew-pub in the Denver area


Colorado -- Vail:
  Alpenstube - ?


Hawaii -- Wailuku:
  Pacific Brewing Co. - P.O. Box 1137.


Idaho -- Caldwell:
  Snake River Brewing Co. - Route 5, Box 30A.


Illinois -- Chicago:
  Berghoff (restaurant and bar), 17 W. Adams - "has their own beer (brewed 
    for them, but they are building their own brewery); good Oktoberfests.
  River North Brewery/Sieben Brewing Co. - the first brewpub in Chicago.
  Goose Island Brewery - 1800 N Clyborn (just n. of North Ave. at the corner
    of Willow, Sheffield, and Clyborn).  "Monday nights are Lager Nights and
    Tuesdays are Ale Nights.  The special prices are $1.50 a pint.  Usually
    everything is $3.00.  In addition to their regular Ale and Lager, they
    also have a regular Pils and two or three specialty brews that change
    with the seasons."
  Tap and Growler - 901 W. Jackson.  "This place has some good beer,
    but wasn't very consistent.  The food was the best of the three.  They
    also sell other brands of bottled beer."
  Weinkeller - corner of Roosevelt Rd. and Ridgland Ave. in Berwyn.
    "Over 500 different beers; recently they started brewing their own."


Iowa -- Amana:
  Millstream Brewing Co. - P.O. Box 283.


Kansas -- Lawrence:
  The Free State Brewery - In the 600 block of Massachusetts St.  "The 
    owner has been interested in beer and brewing for some time, and spent 
    the last couple of years putting this together.  Before he could do 
    anything, he had to get Kansas laws changed!  Kansas passed prohibition 
    in the 1880s, and the breweries then in existence closed.  This is 
    the first one to open since.  They make three beers: a Kolsch (a light 
    beer for American tastes), an Ale (which is really *wonderful*), and 
    a bock.  They'll change seasonally. They also have great food and a 
    pleasant atmosphere."


Kentucky -- ? (Northern Kentucky):
  Oldenberg Brewery - Microbrewery


Louisiana -- Abita Springs:
  Abita Brewing Co - P.O. Box 762.


Maryland -- Baltimore:
  Sisson's Restaurant - "on East Cross Street, a few blocks from the Inner
    Harbor, has become the first brewpub in Maryland.  Sisson's is serving 
    golden and amberales, along with its existing list of about 60 specialty 
    beers and a menu that features Cajun and Creole dishes and fresh seafood."
  Baltimore Brewing Company - scheduled to open on Albemarle Street.  "This
    establishment, to be owned and operated by members of Europe's Grolsch 
    brewing family, will be a German-style restaurant and serve a lager beer."


Maryland -- Glen Burnie:
  The British Brewing Co. - 6759 Baymeadow Dr.


Massachusetts -- Boston/Cambridge:
  Commonwealth Brewing Company - 85 Merrimac Street; five house brewed 
    beers (not bottled?)  "I had some of their Boston Best Burton Bitter, 
    which was drinkable, but not much more.  A fair sense of the hops,
    moderately bitter, but no real finish, no nose.  Very cloudy, too.
    After that I ordered a pint of the amber ale, which had been very good the
    last time I had been there.  This was a real disaster - almost as dark as a
    porter, but completely bland in taste.  Bud in a can has more taste than
    this stuff.  Overall, a major disappointment.  I'll be in no rush to
    return."
  Cambridge Brewing Company - on Hampshire St just outside of Kendal Square
    (Note - this was written by a part-time bartender there)  "The beer is 
    much better than it was when we first opened.  Tending bar I now hear 
    much more of 'this is really good' than 'this is interesting'."  
  Jacob Wirth's - 31 Stuart and Eliot?
  Wursthaus - at Harvard Square


Michigan -- Kalamazoo:
  (No name available) - "You can usually get something from there on tap 
    at the Del Rio (on Washington and Ashley), and various other bars may 
    have it in bottles.  Some names you may see: Bell's Beer, Great Lakes 
    Amber Ale, Third Coast Beer.  He makes a couple of stouts (one is 
    called Expedition Stout, and there is a cherry stout), a Porter, some 
    more Ales (one is called Brown Ale or something like that) ... I know 
    that Partners in Wine at Kerrytown (between north 4th and 5th at 
    Kingsley) has them, probably the Village Corner (South University at 
    Forest) does too."


Minnesota -- Minnetonka:
  Sherlock's Home Brewery - 1000 Red Circle Drive.  "Opened early summer, 
    '89.  Stag's Head Stout, Piper's Pride (Scottish Ale), Bishop's Bitter, 
    Palace Porter, Star of India (IPA), Gold Crown Lager, Queen Anne Light."


Minnesota -- St. Paul:
  Summit Brewing Co.  1,514 barrels.  "After installing a bottling line and 
    doubling production, Summit has not been able to keep up with demand. 
    The packaging for Great Northern Porter, a gold medal winner at GABF, 
    is completed, the company reports."


Montana -- Helena:
  Montana Beverage Ltd. - 1439 Harris Street.


Nevada -- Virginia City:
  Union Brewery - ?


New Jersey -- Vernon:
  Vernon Valley Brewery - 1,500 barrels.  "Vernon Valley introduced two 
    brands in 1987, Old World Classic Dark and Old World Classic Winter 
    Bock, packaged in liter bottles.  The brewery is also experimenting 
    with formulations for a light beer and a double bock."


New York -- Albany:
  The Newman Brewing Co., Inc. -


New York -- Buffalo:
  Buffalo Brewpub - "This is a local pub in Williamsville (a Buffalo suburb)
    selling a lot of imported beer and producing their own beer and ale to sell
    on the premises.  They produce a dark Amber Ale, and a young Hardy Lager.
    Supposedly they also offer good pub food."


New York -- Ithaca:
  The Chapterhouse - "located on Stewart Avenue at the foot of Cornell
    University opened in the spring of 1989 and has been brewing 3-4 beers
    regularly, as well as making the extracts for very good root beers and 
    ginger ales.  On any given night, there are usually three or four beers 
    very generally described as going from light to dark.  The light is 
    usually a superior reproduction of American Industrial "Lite", while 
    the darker and richer beers, usually a bitter and a stout, seem well 
    rounded and flavorful.  A drawback seems to be the small size of the 
    operation.  There is little capacity to let the beer age and mellow, 
    and we have noticed that the stout in particular is often poured 
    'ahead of its time', leading to a very harsh pint."


New York -- New York City:
  Manhattan Brewery - "Try their Porter."
  New Amsterdam Brewery -
  The Peculier Pub - "is alive and well, and in new and much larger quarters 
    on Bleecker near LaGuardia Place (between 6th and Bway).  If you find

North Carolina -- Manteo:
  Bavaria South, Inc. (Weeping Radish Brewpub) - P. O. Box 1471

  Greenshield's Pub & Brewery - 214 E Martin St.  Opened in early July '89.
    Pale ale and Munich Amber.


Ohio -- Cincinnati:
  Wallaby Bob's - Australian Brewpub.  "Wallaby Bob's is in a mall, and 
    might technically be a microbrewery, since they do (apparently) 
    bottle and sell their beer at least for takeout.  I have not yet 
    sampled their wares."


Ohio -- Cleveland:
  ? (microbrewery?) - 


Ohio -- Dayton:
  Growlers Brewpub - "No taste information.  In addition, Growlers is 
    opening a brewpub in Columbus in the fall and plans on opening four 
    more by the end of 1990 in south Dayton, Cleveland, Cincinnati and 
    Middletown, Ohio."


Oklahoma -- Tulsa:

Jeff Casey writes: 
"I'd be interested in hearing of other weirdness out there, especially the
 pleasant surprises."


I've tried lots of weird stuff, the only disappointment being cranberry ale (a
hot topic these days).  I suspect the extremely high acidity inhibited full
fermentation; I bottled after the beer apparently finished, but it kept on
building carbonation for the month it took to get rid of it. Even early on,
it's taste did little to recommend it. 


However, I have had great success with a blueberry stout, cherry ale, and my
famous "Fires of Hell" stout which has ground dried Serano peppers (3) put in
the boil. This tastes like a normal stout, but after 4 or 5 sips, a warm glow
begins to suffuse your throat and tummy; great for winter nights. 


Dark as the Night Stout
=======================
8 cans blueberries (or 10 pints fresh, or ~6 lbs frozen)
.5 lbs roasted barley
.3 lbs black patent
1 lb crystal
2  3.3-lb cans John Bull dark extract (un-hopped)
1.5 oz Fuggles (boil)
bottle with .5 cup corn sugar 


Crush and boil the blueberries in 1.5 gallons water for 10 minutes, then
strain out. Use this water to make your standard stout. Don't worry about
pectin haze, you definitely won't see it! If you've ever messed with fruit in
your beer, you'll appreciate how easy this is. Give this lots of time in
secondary (> 1 month), since fruit tends to keep on fermenting a long time (or
add champagne yeast after initial fermentation).

On a related note - I'm not aware of any brewing interest groups in northern

Subject: "Health food store" malted barley syrup ok?


Brewfolk,


Whilst browsing through a 'health food' store in Portsmouth, NH this past
weekend, I noticed that they had a large (5 gallon, maybe) plastic bucket of
"100% malted barley syrup".  They sell this for $1.55/pound, if you provide
your own container.  That works out to be about half the price of most
commercially-packaged-for-brewing malt extracts. 


I'm going to try a brew made with the stuff, but figured I would solicit
comments or advice from you folks first.  Because it is being sold in a health
food store and is labeled "100%", I have to guess that it isn't adulterated
with corn syrup. 


I may try using 6-7 pounds in a 5 gallon recipe, or maybe a 50/50 mix with DME
(but there goes half of the price discount). 


Any guesses as to whether this is a hair-brained idea, or a good one?


Now the real reason I'm posting:  Due to my work station taking a Thanksgiving
holiday, I missed Homebrew #s 306 - 310.  Would some kind soul mail those to
me please? 


Cheers 'n such,


-Dan

Relax.  Don't worry. etc.  6 days isn't really that short.  Most of my brews
have finished up in that time.  In fact, there is a carboy in the corner of my
kitchen right now that contains a double batch of Dogbolter that I brewed
Sunday afternoon.  It is now Wednesday morning ( < 72 hrs.) The foam has
completely fallen and the cylinder airlock is burping only once every 5
seconds or so.  I will probably rack this beer into 2ndary tomorrow (turkey
day). 


I generally avoid taking S.G. readings except during racking operations. This
reduces the number of times that I open the fermenter and expose the beer to
the outside world.  Again, I take the "Relax" approach.  I'll let the beer
take it's time, because I'm in no hurry.  If you're "Worried" about your beer,
then by all means take an S.G., but my guess is that it is probably finished. 


But... just because a beer finishes up quickly doesn't mean that I bottle it
immediately... Relax.  Don't worry. Read on.

Key Words here!  Patience.  Our beloved Professor Surfeit warns us that our
beer "knows" when we are worrying about it and will spoil just to spite us. 
If you're mellow, your beer will be too. 


Example:


Back in June I decided to experiment with a spiced ale.  I made up my own
recipe in an attempt to approximate Anchor's wonderful offering last
Christmas.  I figured that if it turned out well, I'd brew it again for this
Christmas.  (I brew a special Christmas beer every year and give it away as
gifts to my beer drinking relatives.  (BTW, homebrew makes a wonderful gift!))


Anyway, I brewed this beer to an outrageously high O.G. and stuck it in 2ndary
after about 5-6 days of primary.  Then I got sidetracked with the little
matter of starting up my own consulting business, finding clients, etc.  Not
only did my brew kettle remain cold for 5 months, the 2ndary fermenter that I
stuck in a corner of my basement sat there with beer in it for 5 months! 


Not being a worrying sort of person and, given a confidence boost by the fact
that the beer in question has an estimated 8% alcohol by volume, I decided to
bottle it.  Well, when I opened up the fermenter and racked the beer off the
sludge, I siphoned off a mug full for tasting.  Of course it was flat, but the
color, clarity, and aroma were heavenly.  When I added the priming sugar, I
also added a fresh yeast culture figuring that the original yeast was quite
useless by now. 


I guess the moral of the story is:  If you're careful in all other aspects of
brewing, you needn't worry about how long it sits around.  Truly good beer
will last quite a long time.  Don't rush it. 


So, I will have a special Christmas Ale this year, and I don't have to do
"Hurry Up!" brewing to get it.  Also, when my relatives ask me how long it
took to brew this ale, I can look 'em straight in the eye and say "Six
months!" :-)

Perhaps it was a classic case of the novice finding a good solution to an old
pain-in-the-butt, but, here's my story.  A little more than a year ago, my
major prof. quipped something about making beer.  It was something I always
wanted to try, so naturally I was interested.  He offered to help me brew my
first batch.  Brewing was much simpler than I thought it was going to be! 


However, two weeks later, we got to bottling.  We had no clean bottles, but
lots of 2-years-in-the-garage bottles.  Staring at the grunge in ALL of them,
it looked like alot of work!  I casually mentioned that we should "just put
these in the dishwasher, and alternate detergent, bleach, and plain water" to
clean them out.  My brewing instructor had never thought of it.  Turns out, it
works great.  In the improved version, I route all water to the bottom sprayer
only, increasing the pressure up toward the bottles.  Recently I came across
some of the most terrible looking bud bottles I have ever seen.  60-80% were
spotless (and I mean really spotless, inside and out) after the first pass.  A
quick brush for the others, back in the next load (while I RAHAHB), and they
too were clean. 


The cycle I've settled on is:


hot water/detergent:  5 min  (gets out most of the crud)
hot water/detergent: 20 min  (gets out the rest of the crud)
hot water/bleach:     5 min  (sanitation)
hot water:              5 min  (wash out bleach)
hot water:              5 min  (final rinse)


I usually leave my hot water heater on 130 to conserve energy, but I crank it
up to 160 for full sanitation.  Your mileage may vary. 


I've washed about 50 cases now, and have had great success.  In fact, 100%. 
No sour beer at all.  Best part is, I paid only $25 for a 10 year old
Hotpoint!
