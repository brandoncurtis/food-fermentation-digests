Subject: Wheat Beer Extraction Rate


This weekend I brewed my first wheat beer with mixed results.  The extraction
rate seems very low considering the amount of grains.  I mashed five pounds of
Klages two row, one pound of crystal and five pounds of malted wheat.  The mash
was an infusion mash that started at 153 degrees F.  After one and a half hours
the mash was at 151 degrees F. and passed the iodine test as usual.  The sparge
was at 170 degrees F. and through a filter bed of about one foot.  Initial 
runoff was very cloudy and was recycled until the sparge ran clear.  Total 
sparge time was about an hour.  The original specific gravity after the boil, ab    
and cooling was only 1.041.  This seems low for the use of eleven pounds of 
grain and is low compared to my other non wheat beer mashes.  Any suggestions?

Subject: bubbles and vapor locks


        I am brewing my first batch of mead, and it seems to have developed
an obnoxios habit in the last week. There is a sort of suds at the top which
I am told is normal, I was also told I left plenty of space at the top of the
carboy. Nonetheless, the bubbles have been creeping all the way up and into the
lock. I was told if this happens I should change the water. So far no problem, 
but I have had to do this every day for a few days now. I don't want to have
to open the thing too often, I have popped the reachable bubbles when I 
cleaned the lock, but they are growing back quicker and quicker. The recipe I
used is 10 lbs of honey, about 4 - 4 1/2 gallons of water, and rather a lot of
spices. The mead has been fermenting for about three weeks now. I am not
worried (or at least I won't let my mead know if I am), but does any one have
any suggestions?

Is anyone aware of a homebrew club in or around the Gulf Port, Mississippi area?

So I have had a rather strange problem appear with my most recent batch of
brew - a pale ale.


I was leaving town and so bottled this beer perhaps alittle early, after 9
days in the primary with a SG around 1019.  I primed it with some corn
sugar in the usual manner (boiled with 2cps of water, mixed into the beer
after syphoning it into another carboy).


I always use one large clear glass bottle so I can see if the beer is
clearing, and sure enough after 6-7 days it became nice and clear, about
the color of Bass.  So I put a couple in the fridge to try.


When I went to take them out in a few hours they were very cloudy, so I
assumed I shook them up somehow and replaced them in the fridge with some
clear ones that I put in very carefully.  A few hours later I was shocked
to see these cloudy too.


If fact, every time I cool any of these beers they become cloudy.  Now all
the chemistry buffs are thinking - ah, a percipitate!  That's probably what
it is, but what is it and why does it come out of solution at cold temp's?
Or is the yeast somehow getting stirred up by two hours of sitting in at 45
degrees (not what I consider worth waking up for)?  Most importantly how do
I avoid this problem in the future?  The beer tastes pretty good, but
a little yeasty still.
