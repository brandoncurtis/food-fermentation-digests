Subject: boiling caps, and a recipe for a holiday ale


Well, I had intended to reply to a message a long time ago on this, but
my feed has been flaked out. Much to my surprise, when I get reconnected
after a month, the topic is still under discussion. Re: boiling bottle caps.
Call me strange (many do), but the first time I ever read that you should
boil your caps, I reasoned that it was not only to sanitize them, but also
to soften the seals, so as to make a better seal on the bottle. Now, I don't
think that any commercial bottlers do this, but it still seems like a good
idea. I boil mine, then leave them in the hot water until I use them.
 And now, to hopefully make this useful to someone, here is a recipe for
my Holiday Ale, which turned out VERY well. It has Just a hint of the
Allspice, more in the arome that the flavor, and is quite sweet tasting.
There is a slight bitter hops aftertaste, but I think that if it were any
less bitter, the sweetness would be overpowering. This beer will bring
color to your cheeks. The spice could be omitted with no great loss.


Blow Me Away Holiday Ale  (In memory of those who were blown away Nov. 15th)


6    lb William's Weizenmalt syrup (60% wheat)
2    lb dark DME
2.75 lb Buckwheat Honey
1    lb crushed crystal malt
.25  lb crushed chocolate malt


2.5  oz Cascade          60 minutes
1.5  oz Hallertaur 3.6%  60 minutes
.75  oz Hallertaur 3.6%   1 minute


4 tsp whole allspice simmered in water about 3 minutes, allspice
removed, water added to primary.


Steep grains in 2 gal water while heating to boil. Remove grains.
Add extracts and honey. Boil 1 hour, add 1 tsp irish moss at 30
minutes.


Initial Gravity 1.090
Final Gravity   1.025


Bottle with 2/3 cup corn sugar bulk prime.

"Here's a rather inane question: is it normal for pelletized hops to

excessive bitterness or unpleasant flavors due to this...  (I do
strain the wort going into the primary)."


I often wondered if pelletized hops stayed whole in the boil.  In fact, I used
to smash them prior to addition to the wort.  I was told that they instantly
dissolve in hot wort so since then I don't about them worry anymore.

Subject: Stuck Fermentation and Bottle cleaning




Martin Lodahl suggested that Marty Albini's stuck fermentation was due
to exclusive use of extract, and that the solution is to add yeast
nutrients.  My understanding is that extract has all the minerals,
etc. of the original wort used to make the extract. I suggest that
Marty's 10 lbs of extract creates a rather high-alcohol environment
which could shut down some strains (different yeast strains have
varying tolerance to this). I've done good all-extract brews of ~10 lb
with Muntona (sp) and Red-star (maybe I'm just lucky?). If in doubt,
add champagne yeast after initial ferment. Temperature changes, too,
can freak out the little buggers.


I found a labor-saving way of washing bottles which need
brush-scrubbing (if only for peace of mind).  Clip the end off your
bottle brush and stick the stem in the chuck of your favorite power
drill (make sure you leave enough stem to put the brush to the bottom
of a bottle while in the chuck).  Put a case of bottles on the floor,
and spray a shot of cleaner in each one (409 works great). Then,
insert the brush in each bottle, and zing until you're no longer
worried. I use a bottle sprayer to rinse and the high-temp dish washer
to finish off my anxieties.

The yeasties, of coarse. I heard my wife shout from the kitchen this
morning, "There's beer EVERYWHERE!" My holiday ale, which I'd pitched
the evening of the 5th had blown the lid off the primary. This is one
of those heavy-duty food-grade white plastic primary buckets with a
heavy-duty snap-on plastic lid. You have to push fairly hard to get it
on. You also, obviously, have to push fairly hard to get it off. There
_was_ beer everywhere, mostly the foamy cap stuff. Apparently, the
head rose higher than it ever has before, filling and completely
clogging the air lock. I've had the head overflow into the airlock
before, but never like this. I performed an emergency transfer to a
secondary and connected a blow-off hose instead of another air lock. I
have never seen such an active fermentation as this batch is
exhibiting: it is really blowing.


I sure hope it didn't get contaminated: the blow-off beer is
delicious. I may be lucky, as the explosion appears to have occured
only about an hour before we discovered it.

Does anyone recommend or dis-recommend Briess extracts?  Apparently
they are available in large quantities (58 lb pails) for *cheap*
prices ($72, from Green Acres).


Would such a large quantity be a bad idea for the occasional brewer
(ie, 10-15 gals/month)?  Is spoilage or contamination a problem?

My short definitions of sometimes confusing terms:


attenuation - the degree that sugars are eaten by yeast.  Related to the 
   initial versus final gravity of the beer.  Attenuative yeasts result in
   a lower FG and result in less sweet beers.


conversion - the degree that enzymes change soluble starches into sugars.  
   This happens during mashing.  The masher wants to avoid non-converted 
   starches.


modification - related to the amount of enzymes generated during malting.  
   Malting involves germinating the barley plant, which consumes starch and
   gernates enzymes.  Fully modified grain has lots of enzymes but less 
   starch.

Subject: Sam Adams' Winter Lager


Tonight I bought a case of the just-released Sam Adams Winter Lager.
Nice beer, clean & crisp with more hopping overall, (both bitter 
and flower), and a slight aftertaste that lingers around the back edges
of the tongue. Since I'm snarfing down Sushi crackers at the same time,
maybe they have something to do with that aftertaste...


Not incredibly different than the regular Adams brew, but don't expect
the malty richness that was present in the Double Bock they released
this past spring. Slightly more carbonation than the normal brew.


I'm not very good at describing beer flavors, but I think it's safe to
say that if you like the regular and want more hops, you won't go wrong
buying a case of this.

Subject: Warm lager fermentations


Here's one I really haven't seen discussed much:  what does it hurt, exactly,
to allow a "steam" type fermentation of a lager beer, i.e. to have the
fermentation take place at higher-than-lagering temperatures.


It surely can't be that the yeast doesn't "like" this kind of temperature; all
the batches I've unfortunately had to allow to ferment warm have completed
their fermentations successfully and have tasted pretty good.


I just wonder what's wrong with it, and can't really recall having seen it
discussed much.

Subject: Sorry about yesterdays message, this is the right maple syrup stout




**********
Sorry folks!!! I sent the Maple Syrup Stout message yesterday! It was
a combination of messages that I had filed away, and accidently sent
instead of the whole recipe and short explainations. Sorry!!! This is
what I meant to send!
**********


Following is a recipe for a Maple Syrup Stout. 


Jim Kipps is the originator, from an oct. 6, 1989 posting.
( THANX JIM!!!!! :-))


6    lbs.  Australian Dark Extract (syrup)
1.5  oz.   boiling hops (bullion) 
12   oz.   Maple Syrup
3/4  cup   corn sugar (priming)


I used six ounces of maple syrup for the boil. I added the other six
ounces for the last five minutes of the boil, kinda like an "aromatic".
Total boil time was one hour.


I bottled on nov. 8, and just got back from Hawaii, so my first taste
was after about four weeks in the bottle. 


This is a VERY good beer. I don't typically drink stouts, but I really
like this one. I have only tried drinking three stouts before. I absolutely
didn't like "Guinness Stout", but I do like "Youngs Oatmeal Stout" and 
"Rubicon Stout"(Rubicon Brewery in Sacramento,Ca.). I think the Maple
Syrup Stout is better than the forementioned stouts.


It is very smooth going down, and has sweet but mellow maple flavored 
aftertaste. Thats not a very good description for a beer that tastes as
great as this does, but I have a hard time describing what I'm tasting!
I will very definetely brew this again, and quite soon too!


I'd like to thank Jim again for the recipe, and for some off the net
assistance with getting the recipe right. Thanks Jim!!!

Subject: Re: Orlando (FL) brewpubs


Mark R. Leone  asks:


"Are there any brewpubs or microbreweries of note in the Orlando area?"


Yes, there is a brewpub in Winter Park. It has been open about a year and a
half, now. I don't remember its name but I remember it being something as simple
as "Winter Park Brewing" or "The Orlando Brewery" or somesuch. When I last drank
there, (about a year ago), they had two lagers which were very good but also
fairly indestinctive. That is, indestinctive in the microbrew sense. They're
definitely way ahead of the drab American Pislners that the industrial giants
spew out. Also, at that time, the brewpub was just ramping up production and was
rapidly selling out every batch.


This summer, my friend (who lives close to the brewpub) reported that the place
was constantly filled with yuppies, drinking Bud Lite, and crowding out the
true beer enthusiasts. He talked with the brewer who said that they now sell
more domestic beer than their own. Apparently the place has become some kind
of trendy hangout. If the leads to believe the place is big on atmosphere,
forget it. It's really sparse (or was). Of course, that's a form of atmosphere
itself, I suppose. Anyway, don't let this stop you from trying their beers.


If you want directions for getting there, send me email.




P.S. Thanks to Mike Fertsch for the terminology definitions.
