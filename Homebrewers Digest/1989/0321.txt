In homebrew digest #319, Al Duester described "Samuel 
Adams Winter Lager".


Every year I try to sample as many of these holiday beers 
as I can because they are almost always denser and more 
robust than the breweries' regular offerings.  This year 
I've sampled the following brews (ordered according to my
personal preference):


Anchor's "Our Special Ale"
Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale
Young's Winter Warmer
Samuel Adams Winter Lager
Samichlaus
Aass


Anybody know of other holiday beers that I should keep my 
eyes open for?
