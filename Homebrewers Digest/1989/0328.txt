I'm using plastic for primary (~3 days), glass for secondary. I'm a bit
leery of going all-glass, as a couple of my super-heavy (OG > 1.060)
batches have blown the lid off my primary; it's a tight fit getting the lid
on, so pressure must be intense. I now hook up a blow-off tube -- rather
than a fermentation lock -- for the primary, and I've *still* gotten
blow-up.  The beers have (fortunately) ended up tasting fine, so I don't
think it's wild yeast partying-down...


With this kind of pressure, I'd worry about glass shrapnel from a carboy
primary. Any thoughts? Ideas why heavy brews blow up? Thanks.

Ted--
The only risk of bottling too late is yeast autolysis (the cell walls of
the dead yeast begin to break down).  Your beer will always have dead and
dormant yeast in it, but the idea is to reduce the amount of dead yeast.
I use two stage fermentation because I never know when I will get around
to bottling.  I keep the (green) ALE in the primary till the kraeusen
falls + 1 day (~3-4 days), then in the secondary till the beer clears
(no longer looks like chocolate milk) or until I'm good and ready (whichever
comes last) (~1 - 2 weeks), and then in bottles for 10 days to two weeks
before taste-testing.  Please note this is for ALES - lagers would require
refridgeration, which I am mot set up to do at this time so I don't have a
method yet.
Al.

I'd really love to do an Oatmeal Stout, a la Sam Smith's. I tried once and
failed miserably. I'm currently using extract + specialty grains, and tried
to do a mini-mash on the Oatmeal. Loser!


Anyone have any recipes? Is this possible for an extractor? I'm planning
on taking the all-grain plunge (yech -- what a mess! :-) and an Oatmeal
Stout would be just the motivation I need. 


TIA!
