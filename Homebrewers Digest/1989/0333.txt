I got word about this Michael Jackson program also but have no
access to schedules. If somebody out there has a Discovery channel 
schedule for January it would be really handy if they would post 
the dates and times for these programs. Thanks.

Marty Albini says don't use glass carboys for primary fermentation.


I've never used anything else, and I've never had any problems at all.
The carboy is a 25-liter acid bottle with a standard water-filled
fermentation lock.  There is plenty of room between the top of the foam
and the lock, and nothing has ever clogged it.  I use Sierra Nevada
yeast taken from two bottles three days before pitching.  This yeast in
this quantity has never demonstrated the problems I have read in the
digest; it never has more than two inches of foam.


So I think Marty's advice should be modified a little:  if your
fermentations are explosive, don't use glass.  Otherwise it's ok.




I just got back from Christmas in New Jersey, where I drank a lager
called Bunker Hill, brewed by 'The Lion, Inc., Wilkes-Barre'.  Does
anyone know about this beer or the brewery?  I'd never heard of it, and
I thought the hoppiness was just right.

This talk of not using glass because of explosion possibilities is amazing.
Let me describe how I do it.  I use a 7 gal glass carboy for the primary and
fill it to 5.5 gal at the most.  An airlock is sufficient, and the foam rarely
gets up to the top.  Then I rack into a 5 gal secondary full up and allow the
beer to condition.  NO PROBLEMS!  The blow-off tube is not used, it's not
needed.  The resulting beers are fine.
