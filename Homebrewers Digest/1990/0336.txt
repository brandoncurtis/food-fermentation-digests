The reason Samichlaus is in the Guinness Book of World Records is that
it is recognized as the world's most potent beer, at about 14% alcohol.
While it does seem to possess the characteristics (such as dense body)
of barley wine, I believe it is actually a lager of some sort.
The beer is brewed in Switzerland by Hurlimann A.G. and is imported
to the U.S. by Phoenix Imports.  If you call the importers they are
usually happy to discuss the beers with you (this is ESPECIALLY true
of Phoenix) and can most accurately answer any questions you have
about the product.  Phoenix Imports can be reached at (301)465-1155.
Or write to them at:

BTW: Phoneix also imports many other interesting brews including
Thomas Hardy's Ale, Huntsman Royal Oak, and several lambic ales.

I'd advise you to relax and not to worry. First of all, if you say that
there is a layer of foam on top, I'd check the seal on the lid, you
might not have closed it properly, allowing the gas to escape. Then
check the fermentation lock. It could also be just a slow fermentation,
that's all :-) ... Whatever you do, DON'T CHUCK THAT BATCH! Give it
another week, check the specific gravity and when it's right, bottle it.
I bet you nothing's wrong with it. Good luck.

> I was wondering how long kegged beer will stay fresh?


I have a plastic ball keg (brand forgotten) which I have used for
several years. I have had beer stay fresh (or at least great tasting)
for over 3 months (which is about as long as my self-control allows).
My keg allows the replinishment of co2 pressure via a co2 capsule
mount. I know of no reasons (yet) why beer should deteriorate in kegs
faster than in bottles, as long as you keep the pressure up. Anyone
have different (same) experience?


I always bottle several six-packs of each batch I keg. The difference
between the bottle and keg versions is alway noticable and
interesting. I find the kegged versions to be slightly creamier and
smoother, and their tastes evolve differently over time.

I have been fermenting in 5 gallon soda kegs for about three years now.
The equipment is not specialized, it takes a keg, and some extra keg parts.
A description of the equipment and procedure is in the 1988 Special issue
of Zymurgy, if there is interest I can post a summary here.

Several people have complained about too much foam from their keg. Pete
Soper says:

This sounds just like the beer dispensed from tap in Munich. (I go there
on business about twice a year.) Their standard method of drawing a beer
does not use a pitcher. It is:


    1. Take a clean glass (or mug) and fill it with foam from the tap.
    This puts about 1 cm (it's Europe, remember :-) of liquid in the bottom
    of the glass.


    2. Set the glass aside for a minute or two.


    3. Top off the contents of the glass from the tap.


    4. If the glass does not yet contain enough liquid then go to step 2.
    (Naturally, Germany has a law defining "enough" in this context.)


    5. Serve the beer.


The whole process takes 10 to 15 minutes, even for those small 250 ml
glasses that pilsner usually comes in.  If you go into a busy bar you will
see 20 or 30 glasses lined up in various states of fill.


Pete also said that his ales did not foam very much. This agrees with my
experience during my two short visits to England. The bitter came out of
the tap with little foam (compared to the lagers in Munich). Of course, the
English lagers didn't have much foam either.


So, maybe that foam *should* be there! Does anyone know why there would be
such a foaming difference between the English and Munich lagers? Did all
of you with foam "problems" really do everything right?

I'm compiling a mailorder comparison, and one place I've noticed sold hop
rhizomes is Great Fermentations of Marin; they also have a book on growing
them. I think the rhizomes are only available from Feb to March or something.


I'm not even sure what `rhizomes' are, but assume they're like the
roots. I've read that you don't grow from seeds 'cause you only want female
(flower-bearing) plants, and males would only destroy the bittering power
of the plants during pollination.


If anyone else has experience, could you fill us in?

How are kegs free? Hell, for $100 everyone would do it. Best prices I seem
to see indicate about $250 for a single keg setup. Can you point to
sources?

Where do you get the conversion parts?




Thanks for the info. It's sounding more attractive already. Especially if
the kegs can be obtained at minimal cost.

  Part of the fun of homebrewing comes from naming the brew.
Here are some names:


        Brew Haha - *everyone* has likely heard this one
        Low Brow - play on "lowenbrau"
        Shake's Beer - after a few you just feel poetic!
        Overhill Overt Ale - military brew?
        The Minute Maltz - quickly brewed?

It's the most alcoholic beer in the world, about 12% (can't remember if by
volume or weight). Be careful with it -- a friend of mine got a DUI last
night after drinking just one Samiclaus and one mixed drink. Very tasty
beer, but heed the caution on the label about not driving. (BTW, EKU 28 is
heavier, but not quite as alcoholic). Check Michael Jackson's ``World Guide
to Beer'' for more info.

Subject: Samichlaus Bier


In Digest #335, Marc Davidson <hplsdrf!davidson`at`hp-lsd.cos.hp.com> 
asked about Samichlaus, since the bottles he had didn't contain
very much useful information.


I bought a couple about a month ago and the labels they had here
(in California) had a lot more information.  The beers are brewed
once a year on December 6, then aged 11 months, then bottled,
then aged another year in the bottle, and then sold.  So the
bottles I had in December 1989 were brewed in December 1987.


The Guiness Book of World Records entry is for "World's Strongest
Beer," although as Marc mentioned, it's really more a Barley
Wine.  I believe the alcohol content is in the 13-15% range.


Samichlaus is a vicious beer, not for the faint of heart.
It took four hearty souls with full stomachs almost an hour to
gulp down a bottle after dinner.  The taste is something akin to
German Jagermeister, a liqueur with the taste of cough medicine
and the kick of codeine.


The bottles I had contained the warning: "If you drink
Samichlaus, PLEASE DON'T DRIVE."

OK, so I think I'm convinced to build a Wort Chiller -- immersion cuz I'm
paranoid about cleanliness. But how well can it work during the summer when
my tap water is a good 80 degrees F?


Please don't tell me I have to give up brewing -- I've done it in the
summer with moderate success, I'm just trying to maximize my odds. Or
would a counter-flow device immersed in ice water be the way to go?

I have kept beer in my Roto-keg ( a plastic sphere) for 8 months without 
any noticable degradation. It did require adding CO2 cartridges periodically
to keep the carbonation up. I don't know if  this was to replace beer that
was being tapped off, slight leaks, or diffuion through the plastic.

I have no experience growing hops myself.  Here in Oregon, they are grown on
wire trellises supported by telephone pole sized posts!  (I guess they are
heavy.)  The trellises look to be 15 feet or so tall.


A source of hop root cuttings is:
  Nichols Garden Nursery
  1190 N. Pacific Hwy.
  Albany, OR  97321
  (503) 928-9280    fax (503) 967-8406
They list three varieties of 'humulus lupulus' (hops)
        Cascade
        Tettnanger (lager style)
        Willamette (English ale style)
They are $3.45 per cutting or 4 for $12.95.  I have no experience with their
cuttings, but their garden vegetable seeds are of high quality and I have been
well-satisfied with the company.  (I have no connection with them other than
as a satisfied customer.)


BTW, my wife says she may try growing some hops this year to make aromatic
wreaths.  (I don't brew beer myself at the present time.) :-(

In HOMEBREW Digest #335 (another outstanding issue), Jon Rodin

"A fellow homebrewer recently mentioned to me that one has to be 
careful to use *re-usable* bottles .....  Is there any problem with 
reusing twist off bottles?"


My own personal standard is my estimate of the strength of the
bottle.  Bar bottles are VERY sturdily built, but some six-pack
longnecks, and most twist-offs, are somewhat more lightly
constructed.  I brew mostly British-style ales with mild carbonation
(when it works, that is 8-/), which may be one reason why I've never
experienced the Bottle Bomb Syndrome.  I've run across a few
returnable screw-cap soda bottles (750 ml) that are built like
tanks, but I wouldn't re-use a Sierra Nevada bottle.

In HOMEBREW Digest #335, Brian Glendenning can't relax:


"A friend and I made a pure extract batch following the instructions
given by the local brewstore. However, after 2.5 days (when I left
home this morning) no strong fermentation has started. There is a
light layer of foam on top.


I think the relevant details are:


1. dry yeast
2. started in 1.5 cups of sterile wort ...
                [...]
So, my questions are:


1. is this batch dead? time to chuck it and try again?
2. how long should it take fermentation to start?
3. how should I initially get oxygen into the wort?"


Dead?  I doubt it.  What kind of yeast?  How warm is the room?  
I had Doric behave exactly as you describe, and still (eventually)
produce good beer.  If there WEREN'T a light layer of foam on top,
I'd worry.  Now that I think of it, the barleywine now in my
fermentors has been in there for nearly four weeks, and has a light
layer of foam on it, just as it did the day after pitching.  I'll
rack it this weekend.  As a rule of thumb, if I get anything more
than light bubbling around the edges within 48 hours, I'm
comfortable.  A great roaring pile of kraeusen within 12 hours is my
heart's delight, to be sure, but not all yeasts work that way.


The method described for aerating the wort seems, uh, dramatic to
me.  Directing the stream from the racking tube down the side of the
vessel to produce a fan-shaped pattern usually introduces plenty of
air.  This should only be done with cool wort, though, unless you
wish a practical demonstration of the difference between aeration
and oxidation.  DON'T WORRY!  And if you must worry, DON'T PANIC!! 
I certainly did, with my first batch, and yet it was quite
drinkable.  The yeast know best.  Trust them.
