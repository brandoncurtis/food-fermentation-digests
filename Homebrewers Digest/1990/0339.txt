Woops, sorry about the issue number on yesterday's digest. It should
have been #338, not #1. I knew there was something I forgot. Hopefully,
today's digest should be #339.

There was a very interesting article about the Lion brewery in the
October 1989 issue of "All About Beer" magazine.  The article was
written by James Robertson, author of "The Connoisseur's Guide to
Beer."  Some of the highlights of the article:
* The brewery was opened as the Luzerne Brewery in 1906, it competed
  directly with Stegmaier and three other larger local breweries.
  Although Stegmaier was *MUCH* larger than the Lion, it encountered
  financial difficulties in the 1960's, was ravaged by a flood in
  1972, and subsequently sold to the Lion.    
* Lion's strongpoint is that it produces good beers and sells them
  at lower prices than major industrial brewers.  Some of the beers
  sell for as little as $5/case in Pennsylvania.
* Lion has recently started diversifying products a bit, introducing
  a malt cooler (like wine cooler) called Calvin Cooler.
* Lion has gone after contract-brewing business.  Currently have
  contracts to brew Hope Lager, Manhattan Gold, Jersey Lager, Stoudt's,
  and Winterfest Ale--all excellent products.
* The Lion is family owned.


Robertson then provided flavor profiles of the Lion's major brands, among
them: Gibbons, Stegmaier, Steg Light, Bartels, Liebotschaner Cream Ale,
Lionshead Pilsner, Esslinger, Crystal, Stegmaier Porter, Trupert Pilsner,
(and some of the contract beers).


If you're interested in regional breweries, this is a very good article,
it is on page 14 of the October 1989 issue of "All About Beer" magazine.

Subject: The Lion Brewery


        I just got back from Christmas in New Jersey, where I drank a lager
        called Bunker Hill, brewed by 'The Lion, Inc., Wilkes-Barre'.  Does
        anyone know about this beer or the brewery?  I'd never heard of it, and
        I thought the hoppiness was just right.


I haven't had the opportunity to try Bunker Hill ;-(, but The Lion
is a brewery in Wilkes Barre that does a lot of contract brewing.
One brew that they make is all the Hope Lager, Red Rooster Ale,
Christmas Ale, etc... for the Hope Brewery in Providence, RI.  
They do a good job of contract brewing, as Hope has done well
in various judgings and is doing well locally.


The Lion also brews its own brands - like Bartel's - which are not
as good the contract brews.  I tried a Bartel's recently and found
it to be rather weak in flavor - but I remember Bartel's from about
15 years ago as having a stronger yeast/malt taste.

Subject: Brewpots for Mead


In an issue of the HomeBrew Digest during December 1989 or thereabouts,
someone insisted that mead not be brewed in a bare metal pot,
and recommended using an enamelware vessel instead.


I thought that stainless steel was always acceptable for a brewpot.
Would someone in-the-know please explain why mead would be an exception ?
And at what honey content in a predominately malted-barley brew recipe
would this make a difference ?  I could not detect any reason to regret using 
stainless steel Revere-Ware for boiling a 30% honey, 70% malt extract recipe.

Shoeless Joe writes:


For the legal-eagles amongst the homebrewing throngs--and because I've never
seen it published in the Digest--I've enclosed for general perusal the govern-
ing Federal law concerning homebrewing. 


A note to the paranoid:


      Each state--and in some cases, local government--may have slightly
      different requirements or (GASP!) may ban homebrewing all together.
      If you really want to be compulsive about these things, I'd suggest
      you check your home state's annotated code...
...
From the US Code Annotated (which, for those of you who are interested, are the
laws of these United States organized by topic_), Title 26 (which, interesting-
ly enough is the INCOME TAX section!), section 5053 (EXEMPTIONS from income
tax), subsection (e): 
...
Beer for Personal and Family Use.--Subject to regulation prescribed by the
Secretary, any adult may, without payment of tax, produce beer for personal or
family use and not for sale.  The aggregate amount of beer exempt from tax
under this subsection with respect to any household shall not exceed-- 


    (1) 200 gallons per calender year if there are 2 or more adults in
        such household, or


    (2) 100 gallons per calender year if there is only 1 adult in such
        household.


For purposes of this subsection, the term "adult" means an individual who has
attained 18 years of age, or the minimum age (if any) established by law
applicable in the locality in which the household is situated at which beer may
be sold to individuals, whichever is greater. 
... 
The law came into effect on 14 October 1978--a day which should go down in
infamy!  Let's take things into our own hands and proclaim October 14--from now
until forever--National Homebrewing Day! Whataya think?

Subject: Comments on plastic kegs




I, too, have had friends bad-mouth the plastic kegs because they always
seemed to have some problem staying sealed.


However, the Rotokeg I bought some years ago has been a trustworthy
friend. My first experience with it did not turn out too well, but a
friend (my brewing mentor) pointed out a technique which has
eliminated all subsequent problems. COAT THE SEALS AND O-RINGS WITH
VEGETABLE OIL BEFORE ASSEMBLING PRIOR TO EACH BATCH. That's all it
takes for the seals to seat correctly. I have had (undisturbed) keg
batches retain pressure for months without adding CO2.

Or, you could go to an aquarium store and get a water pump. It should
be plenty powerful for an wort chiller, and couplers for that size
should be easy to find.

 Instead of using an electric drill you can buy a pump for about
 $10 at most hardware stores. I have one on a hydroponic unit and
 it works fine, its base rests in the ice water and just plugs 
 into the wall.

 I've just bought a beer making kit and was wondering if anyone

 I used to drink this about 4 years ago at the Togos on Lawrence

Richard Tatz (former brewmaster at Santa Fe Brewing Co.) says that a
real estate developer will be opening up a brewpub close to the
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque this year. Construction is
slated for April with a tentative completion of June or July.  The
brewpub will feature four ales:  light, amber, dry hopped medium,
heavy.  Throughout the year they may also feature a porter or stout.
The cuisine will be barbeque.  Richard will serve as brewmaster.

I just received a flyer from NTHBA in Dallas about the Bluebonnet Conference

know what kind of competition this will be (i.e. whether it is an AHA
sanctioned competition and what kind of beer styles they are accepting)?

1.  Tell me, what is root beer?
    We don't get that over here; is it something like gingerbeer?


2.  Can you get beer "kits" over there.  (This essentially gets rid
        of all the hops work etc; you just add sugar, water and yeast
        {and whatever else you want, caramel, lactose etc} and
        let it ferment, then bottle it.  That is extremely big
        over here.  {I don't know anyone who works with hops})


3.  What's the viability of re-using yeast.  Someone suggested I should
        save the crap out of the bottom of a brew and re-use it in the
        next brew.  (I have nightmares about that sort of thing)


4.  What else could I use to sweeten a brew up?


And to finish, a excerpt from Ben Elton (co/writer of Black Adder, Young Ones
        and various other british comedies) on Real Ale:
        "I was up the Priests Hole the other day (That's a pub, not an
        archaic criminal offence) and I got a lager and the guy behind
        the bar said  "Don't drink that mate,  it's not real",  I said
        "Try  telling  that to the Taxi driver when you're throwing it
        up all over the front seat - It's not real mate, it's not real"
        ..So I had a real ale.  I kid you not, the stuff was so strong,
        the bar prices were in Braille.  Amazing feeling, take a sip,
        >WALLOP<, what the f*ck was that?!"

Subject: wort chiller with 80F water




Chris Shenton asks:


>OK, so I think I'm convinced to build a Wort Chiller -- immersion cuz I'm
>paranoid about cleanliness. But how well can it work during the summer when
>my tap water is a good 80 degrees F?


my immersion chiller seems to bring the wort down to within 5-10F of the
water temp itself, so i'd expect 80F water to get you at least down to 90F,
which seems to be a reasonable pitching temp.


other replies to chris's question suggest ice baths and pumps.  i'm
skeptical of dual heat exchangers (ie, run warm tap water thru a coil
immersed in ice water).  seems to me that approach expends a lot of work to
HEAT the ice water.  better to cool several gallons of water to just above
freezing and then run that water thru a simple immersion chiller.  can
someone familiar with the heat capacities of wort vs water calculate the
volume of (say) 40F water necessary to bring wort from (say) 190F to 90F?  i
could picture cooling water in a freezer chest using these 5gal cubitainers
i got for free, if i only needed 10-20 gallons.  if the required volume is
unreasonable, i'd suggest using your tap water for all it's worth (say, get
the wort down to 110F) before switching to the icewater.  as for a pump, i'm
not sure you'd want to recirculate the water anyway.  with my chiller, the
"first run" thru is scalding hot.  better to replace that water with 80F tap
water instead.
