Subject: Ginger ale/beer -- what's the difference?


I like ginger ale OK, but I much prefer ginger beer. What's the difference?


I've made ginger beer, and it came out very nicely. Is there some
ingredient that makes the distinction between `beer' and `ale', and why are
they called beer and ale, anyway?

Subject: Using Spent Grains


Hello,


I know I read somewhere (this Digest, zymurgy, some place) about someone
making use of the spent grains left over from the brewing process
to make various food products.


Was it cookies, granola bars, or yet some third recipe?


Anyway, I can't find it in back issues of zymurgy or this Digest, so
I am actively soliciting help in finding good cooking recipes that
make use of the spent brewing grains.


Thanks.

Subject:  heat of dilution ?


Hi All,
        The equation used to calculate heat of dilution:
        Tf=(T1V1+T2V2)/(V1+V2) doesn't take into account the increased
        heat capacity of your wort. Intuitively we know that the burn
        (scald) that we would receice from our wort will be more severe
        than that of pure boiling water (ergo, it holds more heat).
        Unfortunately there is no accurate way (that I know of) to
        predict the increased heat capacity( Cp ) of a solution. We
        can estimate the Cp of our solution by knowing the composition
        and molecular formulae of its components (whose individual heat
        capacities can be estimated using Kopp's Approximation"
        Cp <=> 3NR where:N is the # of atoms forming the compound and
        R is the gas constant) The bottom line is: the time and effort
        of trying to estimate how much water you'll need to cool your
        wort far outweighs one empirical experiment. That is, measure
        it and see.8-)


P.S. If anyone really wants the rest of the calculation (P-CHEM is not
     of interest to most sane readers of the net) e-mail me personally

Subject: Re: Sealing Cornelius Kegs


I too have had problems with getting a good seal with
Cornelius kegs, but not as bad as the poster yesterday.
Since it was recommended to replace the O ring on the
lid anyway, I decided to try a "Lid Sealing O Ring" from
William's Brewing (P.O. Box 2195, San Leandro, CA 94577,
415-895-2739).  This is admittedly way overpriced at $5.90.
I just tried it last night.  The keg sealed the first time
I put the lid on.  I had never had the lid seal the first 
try before.  So the O ring worked as advertised so I may
have to break down and order five more for the rest of my
kegs.


Other prople on this mailing list seem to expend great effort
to avoid dispensing the sediment in a keg.  I expect the first
pint or two after tapping the keg to be mostly sediment.  After
that you should have sediment free beer.

        Could be leaking thru the fittings or the valves in them. I'd
recommend a complete teardown; should take about ten minutes. Replace
anything that looks even remotely suspicious.


        The lid gasket (really an o-ring) leaking is a common problem.
They take a set if they're stored compressed. Try this: put one in a
bowl, add boiling water, and let set for a few minutes (don't boil the
o-ring!). While it's still warm, put the tank back together and
pressurize.


        Something else may be happening: the CO2 may be going into
solution with the beer in the tank. This will drop the pressure, but
not all the way to atmospheric. To test for this, pressurize a dry
tank and come back in a few (standard unit of time: two stouts, or a
six-pack of light stuff).

        I store my empty tanks dry with 5psi in them to keep the seals
working and to keep nasties out. They keep this way for months. All my
tanks were bought used.

What a wonderful idea! I've made selzer myself, by force carbonating
in a Cornelius, but the concept of a naturally-fermented, flavored
selzer is very appealing!

Subject: 1% iodine


In a description of a brewpub's practices, Ed Falk mentioned that
they use iodine for sanitizing and do not rinse it off their equipment
because "it evaporates".


     ************    DO NOT PLAY WITH IODINE    ****************


I believe a solution of plain, metallic iodine (like you would buy 
at a drug store) WILL NOT EVAPORATE.  Its solvent will evaporate,
but the iodine is left behind, which is the whole point in its 
common application. Since iodine is quite toxic, what I am 
strongly suggesting is that we all LEAVE IODINE ALONE. Perhaps
the quantity left on equipment surfaces in the setting described 
at the G-B brewpub is insignificant. Perhaps it isn't. Perhaps 
they are using a volatile iodine compound (idoform?). But 
for goodness sake folks, let's not experiment with this.

Subject: Soda kegs


Florian says he is having problems keeping soda tanks pressurized.


I have a lot of experience with soda tanks, and I don't have this problem.
Many amateur brewers here in San Francisco use soda tanks, and I haven't
heard of this problem from them, either.


Are the tanks connected to something that might be leaking and leading you
to believe that the tanks themselves are leaking when they are not?


If the tanks are new, I'm at a loss to explain this.  I have used dozens
of new tanks and never had this problem.  I assume they are used tanks.


Have the five o-rings been replaced with new ones?  If not, you have no
idea how old, how worn, or how inflexible the rubber is.  I routinely 
replace the o-rings on every used tank I get.  (It's better for the
beer, too;  rubber holds the flavor of the previous contents.)


Not all lids fit all tanks, even if they look like they should.  If you
had to bend something, you clearly have the wrong lid/tank combination.
Maybe the seller jumbled up the tanks and the lids in the cleaning process.  


If the tanks are used, who cleaned them and how?  I've "overcleaned" two
tanks in my time, corroding the weld and creating tiny leaks.


Have the tanks been disassembled for cleaning and then reassembled loosely?
Specifically the pressure-relief valve in the lid and the two disconnect
stems on top?  It doesn't seem likely that the stems are too loose, because
on several occasions I have forgotten to tighten them on a tank I was
reassembling after cleaning, left them finger tight, and didn't notice until
I disassembled it after the next (successful) use.  Apparently they still
work only finger tight.  I don't rely on this, however, and I still use the
wrench, except when I forget.


Oh yeah, I also routinely replace the "poppets" in the disconnect stems on
used tanks.  There may be a tiny leak between the rubber in the poppet and
the steel in the stem.  (The poppet is the spring thing which seals the hole
in the disconnect stem.)


This kind of question sounds stupid, but it sometimes helps discover the
problem:  are you sure the tanks are leaking?  Maybe your pressure guage
is failing.  Or maybe your gas system isn't really filling the tanks.


Soda keg systems get a lot of praise because they deserve it.  Don't give
up on them just because your first attempt is not yet successful.

Hi there, I have two completely different questions:


1) There was an article in the digest a couple of weeks ago about
the Lion brewery, and Stegmaier brand (aside from the two articles
in yesterday's digest). Has anyone kept it? And if so, could you
please e-mail it to me?


2) How can I make my next batch a little bit sweeter? Would adding
unfermentable sugars do it? And if so, WHAT are unfermentable sugars
:-)? Am I off the mark?


Thanks again.

With all of this talk on wort chillers, don't forget the utmost in
simplicity.   For small (12 qt.) brewpots I just put the sucker
in a sink of cold water and cool it in about 5 minutes.


Yes, this is potentially a little hard on the pot, so I wouldn't
necessarily try it on something expensive.  But then again, it's not
like you're cooling boiling oil (or candy) and is it really any worse
than pouring boiling liquid into a cool stockpot?

Subject: Electric Drill Pumps


Several posters have suggested recirculating ice water through a wort
chiller using a pump driven by an electric drill.  I tried this some time
ago: a < $5 pump, a Sears 1/2" drill, and some hoses and tubing.


It took ten minutes to get down to the temperature I wanted.  By the end
of that time I was nearly deaf.  Typically you use a hand drill in short
bursts, so you're not aware of how loud it is.  Running continuously
for over a minute it is LOUD.  The second time I tried it I put in earplugs
and still found the drill anoyingly loud.


Before you buy hoses, fittings, and a pump, and rig the whole business up,
sit in a room with your drill for a few minutes.  Most unpleasant.
