Sorry about those pesky test messages. I accidentally sent them
to the real list instead of the test list. We're having terminal
problems with one disk here, so I've set up a backup machine
to send out homebrew digests. Hopefully, it will be transparent
for everybody.


Thanks for not worrying!

Please nobody post it again! It's been posted to this mailing list several
times already, and is available in the archives. Mail, do not post, a copy
to him. Thanks.

Subject: Pumps, Revisited


In HOMEBREW Digest #1 (volume II, perhaps?), a gratifying number of
folks steered me towards small, inexpensive, drill-driven pumps to
recirculate water through my wort chiller.  I am grateful to one and
all, but a chance observation yesterday made the water-saving
question suddenly less imperative.  While chilling a batch of IPA, I
suddenly realized that perfectly good steaming-hot water was coming
out of it, and by golly, I still had stuff to sterilize!!  So, all
utensils into the lauter tun/hops back, along with some bleach, for
a nice, hot bath.  After the requisite time, I drained the still-hot
solution into the carboy.  Normally I would have used a seperate
batch of hot water for these chores, but now I'm getting a second
use from the cooling water, and recovering some of the heat, as
well!  I'm tickled.


By the way, new security measures have been taken here that are so
effective that even I can't use my own login, so it'll be a spell
before I'm able to see anything later than HBD 1, though I can still
post "in the blind" from another machine.  I'll miss you all, and
hope to get this resolved before I've fallen too far behind.

Subject: How Many Calories in Homebrew?


Has anybody seen or concocted a formula for estimating the number of calories in 
a homebrew?  I would expect that some sort of calculation involving the O.G. and 
F.G. could be used to determine the percentage of unfermeted sugars and alcohol, 
which in turn contribute calories.


Any ideas?

The product was granola and you can find it towards the back of the All Grain
issue of Zymurgy.

Subject: Recipe index


In Homebrew Digest #341, Tom Fawcett asked if anybody had an index
for Papazian's "Complete Joy.."


Well Tom, I've got an index which is a HyperCard stack on my Mac.  It
also includes indexes to "Winners Circle", the past 2 years of Zymurgy
magazine, Miller's "Complete Hand Book", and several other books.
It includes a Navigator script to narrow down a search, and provides
info about mashing method etc that can be fed into another script
that calculates expected alcohol by either volume or weight.  
If you (or anybody else out there in homebrew land) would like a
copy, let me know.

Subject: Reculturing yeast from the secondary fermenter


A while ago, there was some discussion on yeast starter cultures, and one
reculturing yeast. I was hoping to do both, and have a couple specific
questions.


I have some Wyeast Munich slurry from the bottom of my secondary in a
bottle in the fridge with an airlock. It's been there two days.


* How long will it survive storage? a week? a month? longer?


* What kind of starter is good? one quart with OG 1.025?


* How much of the stored yeast goop do you add to the starter?


* Any limitations on the number of regenerations?


Thanks in advance for the advice! If I only have a week, I'd better get
brewing...

Subject: Anchor yeast


Howdy -


I will be a 'guest' brewer at the Anchor Brewing Co. in early February
and I am planning on taking my portable yeast lab along.


I am hoping to get samples of their yeast(s) while visiting,
and was wondering if anyone had any experience acquiring and/or
culturing their yeast, or any knowledge of the source of their yeast.  
I would also like to know if they use more than one variety of yeast.


BTW: Homebrewers in the boston area: I have clean & vigorous isolated
cultures of Sierra Nevada Ale yeast (dependable all-around workhorse) and 
Anheuser-Busch Lager yeast (aggressive & quick fermenter) which I can
share at Wort Processor meetings if you ask me ahead of time.
