Try FOXX -- I saw their ad in Zymurgy a couple issues ago. Kegging and beer
systems seems to be their only business. I haven't used them, so I don't
have any first hand knowledge.

One place that has a good selection of parts for soda kegs is Brewer's
Warehouse (formerly The Brass Corkscrew) 4520 Union Bay Place N.E.,
Seattle, WA 98105, (206)527-5047.  They always have ads in Zymurgy.  They
have three catalogs which each cost $1.00 (refundable with an order):
wort chiller, kegging systems, supplies & equipment.  Their brewing
system sure looks nice.  Too bad it is so expensive.

Subject: Used soda tanks


The Cornelius Company has instituted a tank cover exchange program in
an attempt to reduce the number of tank covers without relief valves in 
service.  Their concern is obviously the safety of tanks without relief
valves.  Amateur brewers with used Cornelius tanks with plastic lids
that do not have the relief valve might want to take advantage of this
program and upgrade to a steel lid with a relief valve.  This is safer,
cleaner, and more convenient.  The program is aimed at beverage system
operators.  I don't know if it applies to us as well, and I don't intend
to find out;  I'm not going to identify myself as an amateur brewer.  I'm
just going to send in my plastic lids.  Below is the actual text of their
program description, dated 1/4/90.  The program is effective immediately
and will continue until further notice:


"Return each soft drink product tank cover in your possession which was
manufactured by The Cornelius Company and which does not have a built-in
relief device.  Cornelius will replace it with a stainless steel relief
valve type cover which meets NSDA voluntary standard No. 1 on a no charge
basis.  Simply ship those covers to The Cornelius Company,
One Cornelius Place, Anoka, Minnesota 55303-1592 and they will be
replaced to you."

It is time for me to make my third batch of beer and I want to make a
steam beer.  I am interested in contributors favorite recipes so that I
could give one a try.


Thank you all in advance.
