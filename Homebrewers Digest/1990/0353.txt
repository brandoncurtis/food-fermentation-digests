Chuck Coronella asked about fermentation that stopped
prematurely. I've had my share of these and usually its the temperature
of the brew that causes the problem. Take a sample and take its 
temperature. If its in the low range for your yeast, try moving
the brew to a warmer place in the house.  I live in a two story, so
I can get 5 degrees F difference just by carring the whole
mess up a flight of stairs. I've tried adding yeast nutrient  as well
but if the temperature is wrong it will do no good.

You could start your batch only 7-10 days before St. Pat's day
(sorry -- not helpful -- but I couldn't resist 8-)

I have a cheap (free) source of nitrogen.  Can I use it instead of CO2 in my 
kegs?  Actually I don't have a keg system yet, but I am in the process of 
looking for sources at resonable prices.  Thanks.

Hello,


When discussions of fermentation take place, I often hear people talk
about "bubbles" in the airlock.  I interpret this as actually seeing
bubbles of gas float to the surface of the liquid in the airlock.


I have never seen a bubble float through the water in an airlock,
either the S-shape or the other type.  The water looks carbonated
(tiny bubbles on the sides of the container) during fermentation,
but nothing like actual bubbles coming through.

Batch number 5 is now in bottles, and batch number 6 (which I've called "it's
in there") is in the secondary, fermenting away.  All of my brews (with the
exception of the first one, which was KOd by chlorine contamination (faulty
bottle cleansing)) have been pretty good, if a bit slow to age really well
(perhaps because of such ingredients as honey).  


The last batch contains 3.3 lbs of dark hopped malt extract syrup, 1 lb of
chocolate malt, 1/2 lb of dark patent malt, 1/2 lb of crystal malt, 2 lbs of
corn sugar, 2 lbs of "government issue" honey, a couple of tablespoons worth
of spruce extract (enough for 4-5 gallons), 1/4 tsp of Irish moss, and
filtered water.  I decided to get rid of some inferior ingredients, since I've
decided to not use corn syrup for bottling purposes, so I decided "what the
heck".  I hope it finishes fermenting by Saturday evening, when I've made
plans to borrow.

  Fantastic. I had a good laugh at myself when I read this. I'm so used to
60 degree, 6-8 day ale fermentation cycles that I missed the obvious possibility
that these guy's beer is fully fermented already! I'd bet money that Mark
is right and these guys had such a strong, warm fermentation that it flew by.
  The question for beginners, though is what hydrometer reading should
be seen? The answer for an all-extract batch with "average" yeast is a
terminal gravity of about 1/4 the original. So if the Brews Brothers started
with, for example 1.048, then a "normal" ending gravity would be roughly
1.012.
  As for the rest of your posting, Mark, I have to gently suggest that
differences in lag between "hours" and "3-4 days" are not due entirely
to the different yeast strains - something else is going on.

I don't have a *lot* of experience yet (two batches, so far, but I'm
working on it...:-), but my first batch (an English bitter) fermented
for about 15 hours and that was it. My second batch (a porter) fermented
a little more than a day. In both cases, the final gravity was about
where I expected it and yes! it was great.


So my best advice is: no matter when it stops, it the final gravity is
fine, rack it to the secondary, and don't worry !
