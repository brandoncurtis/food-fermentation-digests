Real Irish beer is black.  Brew up a good stout for St. Patrick's Day if you
really want to honor the Irish.  One of my favorite recipes is Cushlomachree
Stout from CJOHB.  So how about honoring the Irish for some of their fine
contributions to brewing by brewing an Irish beer.  (Green horse urine is not
an Irish beer!! 8^)) ).

Just a couple of quick questions.  Has anyone finally found out when
and on what Michael Jackson's "The Beer Hunter" is going to show?


Also I am interested in finding a source for a "Yard" glass.  You know
one of those 3' glasses that you can watch your brew runshing toward
you with great anticipation.

Subject: green beer?!?!?  ;-)




I have been rolling this around in my mind, and just haven't been able to
figure it out!!!


Where does the green come from? I don't mean for specialty beers. Everyone,
including myself, talks about our "green" beer. How come it isn't green when
it's finished aging? It isn't green when I boil it, or put it in the 
fermenter!


I have heard of "green" being used for other things,, such as wood, that
needs time to age or dry before it's ready to use.


Does anyone out there know how the term "green" came to be used in this
context???


Maybe I've watched Gallager once too many times, but I just have to wonder
how terms like "green" came about. Haven't you ever wondered about stuff like
that? Just like, "Why does 7-11 have locks on thier doors when they're open
24 hours a day?".

I've been working on a recipe I call "Red Lite," a companion to
my "Black Lite" creation of last year.  The general idea is fairly low alcohol
and light body, a refreshing summer beer with pleasing color and plenty of
flavor, etc.  I abandoned Crystal as the means of getting this; even the darker
Crystal malt seemed too brownish, and of course the unfermentables made for a
heavy mouthfeel in my tests. (Tests were performed by boiling small amounts of
crushed grain in solution in the ol' microwave, just to see the color of the
infusion.)  However, I was able to get a rich red using a fairly small amount
of roasted barley;  I haven't gotten the batch made yet, but my plan is to
include about 2-4 oz of crushed barley (grain removed before boiling) with my
recipe (3-4 lbs of dried light malt and probably Nugget hops).  I don't expect
the bitterness of the roasted barley to overpower the batch, provided I hop
it well.  I'll post the Black Lite recipe as soon as my roommate tries          duplicating it -- it had some flavor characteristics that may or may not be
reproducible.  If so, I'll post.


BTW, does anyone have a recipe which closely approximates Grant's Celtic Ale
(another light-bodied one) or Grant's Scottish Ale (not at all light,but 
marvelous nonetheless)?

Perhaps you've already seen it, but the AHA/Zymurgy has a nice little
handout on ``How to use specialty grains''. Is describes the effects of
adding various grains to a normal batch (5gal) made with light extract.
Items covered include flavors and colors, and vary according to amount
used. It's not terribly scientific -- no degrees Lovibond or anything --
but will point you in the right direction. It's free for the asking (I
think).

Subject: avoiding boiling grains


Rather than straining the wort, I simply use a grain bag
which I purchased from my friendly neighborhood homebrew
supply store, "Lil' Olde Winemaking Shoppe" in Sugar Grove, IL.
I have one for grains and a few for hops.  Thus I never strain
and I never worry.
Al.
