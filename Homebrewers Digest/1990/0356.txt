Subject: Sanitizing in the dishwasher?




Greetings.  I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried sanitizing in.. their
dishwasher!?  I've contemplated running it empty a round or two on rinse to
clean it out, then running my equipment through using sanitizing agent instead
of dishwasher detergent.  Does this seem sound?  I can hardly fit my fermenters
in my sink, and the dishwasher would run a lot hotter than I can clean by hand.
Comments?  Thanks in advance..


Na Zdorovia,
Jeff

Does anyone know what the latest issue of Zymyrgy is?
The most recent one that I have received is the special
yeast issue.


Thanks, Doug.

Subject: List of brewpubs, etc. [revised]


A couple of months back, I compiled a list of "brewpubs" which was
included in this digest (#312).  Since then I have received some
additions and corrections, so I think it's time to resubmit the list.


As I said before, I cannot personally vouch for the accuracy of very much 
of the information contained herein; there are some microbreweries and 
non-brewpub bars listed as well as straight brewpubs, but I presume it's
better to err on the side of including non-brewpubs than to leave some
brewpubs out.  Also, one of my sources appeared to have been scanned in, 
with numerous instances of dropped or altered characters.  Use the list 
with caution.


If you have additions, corrections, etc., please send them directly to
me (thode`at`nprdc.navy.mil), since I currently don't have access to
the digest.

Here's the list...


                                     USA


Alaska -- Douglas:
  Chinook Alaskan Brewing and Bottling Co. - 1407 5th St.


Arizona -- Tempe:
  Christopher Joseph Brewing Co./Bandersnatch Brewpub.


California -- Arcata:
  Humboldt - 856 10th Street, Arcata.


California -- Berkeley (the North Bay):
  Triple Rock - Shattuck near University, Berkeley.  "This is one of the 
    best around.  Several excellent beers; they also usually have a 
    specialty brew available. The selection varies, but they always have 
    at least an amber and a dark.  Recommended!"
  Golden Gate Brewery - Near the waterfront.  "Very big place with 
    progressively designed interior.  Beer is good, but not very hearty.  
    Pub Atmosphere."
  Bison - 2598 Telegraph.


California -- Boonville:
  Buckhorn Saloon/Anderson Valley Brewing Co. - on Highway 126 between 
    Hopland and Ft. Bragg, not far from Hopland).  "I've only had their 
    beer bottled (26 oz. bottles). The pub looked nice but I didn't have 
    time for a beer. The beer is very good; they make a Porter, an Amber, 
    a light beer, and a wheat beer which I haven't tried.  The others are 
    all excellent, especially the porter - dark and smooth, almost creamy, 
    yum yum!  Their beer is available all over the Bay Area in bottles.  
    I highly recommend it."


California -- Calistoga:
  Calistoga Inn - 1250 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga.


California -- Chatsworth:
  Angeles Brewing Co. - 10009 Canoga Ave.

    Ivanhoe Ale, Lion Hearted Ale (Seasonal) Excalibur Stout.
  Sierra Nevada - Well-known microbrewery in Calif., brewpub open late '89.


California -- Davis:
  Back Alley - 139 G Street, Davis.


California -- Emeryville:
  The Emeryville Brew Co. - The Bay Area's newest brewpub. 
  Emery Pub - 5800 Shellmound (is this the same place as the prior reference?)


California -- Emile:
  Golden Pacific Brewing - 5515 Doyle St.


California -- Eureka:
  Lost Coast - 617 4th Street, opening late '89.


California -- Fort Bragg:
  North Coast - 444 North Main Street.


California -- Fremont:
  Brewpub on the Green - 3350 Stevenson Blvd.


California -- Fresno:
  Butterfield - 777 East Olive.


California -- Hayward:
  Buffalo Bill's - B Street & 2nd street.  Own beer plus Sierra Nevada 
    and others on tap; Darts, pub food.


California -- Hollister:
  San Andreas Brewing - at 737 San Benito St in Hollister, about 45 minutes 
    east of Monterey.  "Their Earthquake Pale Ale had no head to speak of 
    but combined some nice malt and very hoppy bouquet.  The Seismic ale 
    was very fruity and harked back to some of the Lambics.  It was made 
    using some wild NY yeasts.  The earthquake porter had its taste 
    softened a touch by  the coffee and chocolate complexities brought to 
    the roasted malts.  The Kit Fox Amber had a fruity aroma, medium body, 
    no head but was a nice hop and malt blend.  Now, the Cherry Ale was a 
    definite throwback to the Belgian styles with serious cherry in the 
    bouquet and the taste but was an interesting addition to the four 
    other offerings."  (Not hurt seriously by quake damage, despite being
    near its epicenter.)


California -- Hollywood:
  Gorky's II - 1716 North Cahuenga Blvd.


California -- Hopland: 
  Mendocino Brewery - "A very nice pub with good home brewed beer.  Their 
    beer is superb, especially draft Red Tail Ale.  The original California 
    Brew Pub.  Peregrine Ale and Eye of the Hawk (seasonal) are excellent.  
    Live music, indoor and outdoor (in a hops garden) seating and good food."


California - Larkspur:
  The Marin Brew Co. - Larkspur Landing.  "Very good!  One of the best 
    around.  Large place, good pub food.  The amber and porter are both 
    excellent, the wheat beer was good but too light for my taste.  
    Recommended."


California - Lebec:
  Grapevine - 658 Lebec Road.


California -- Los Angeles:
  John Bull Pub - 958 South Fair Oaks Ave.
    (Fair Oaks south from 210, or turn left off the end of the Pasadena
    fwy 2 blocks to Fair Oaks right).  
  Gerky's Russian - 536 East 8.
  Los Angeles - 1845 South Bundy in West LA (opening '89).


California -- Mammoth Lakes:
  Mammoth Lakes - 170 Mountain Blvd.


California -- Modesto:
  Stanislaus Brewing Co., Inc. - 3454 Shoemaker Ave.  Capacity: 5,200 barrels. 
    St. Stan's Altbier (Amber and Dark).


California -- Monterey:
  Monterey Brewing - at 638 Wave St in the Cannery Row district of Monterey.
    "It is a small stand-alone building and a night time rock and roll bar.
    It featured a pale ale that was very hoppy.  Their Amber was a
    wonderful brew of roasted and had a hint of caramel flavor.  Their 
    porter was nearly opaque and the malt flavor practically separated in 
    your mouth for easy evaluation.  Wonderful!"  (Not damaged by recent 
    earthquake.)


California -- Mountain View:
  Tied House - Villa St.  "Yuppie to the core, too much so for my taste. 
    First time I went the beer was mediocre, since then it's been much 
    better.  They have a light, amber and dark all the time, and one or 2
    specialty brews that vary. The light's too light for me, and the amber 
    is pretty light too. The dark is what I would call an amber; both the 
    amber and dark are OK, but unmemorable."


California -- Napa:
  Willett's - 902 Main Street.


California -- Nevada City:
  Nevada City Brewing Co. - 75 Bost St.


California -- Oakland:
  Pacific Coast - 906 Washington Street.


California -- Palo Alto:
  Gordon Biersch brew pub - California St (south of University a few blocks).
    "It's a restaurant rather than a pub.  They have a Maerzen and an
    Oktoberfest (not really, it's too light to be called that) both of 
    which I liked. Pretty good food.  Overall nothing special.  3 to 5 
    varieties of homebrew, depends on day & season."
  Lancashire Tavern.


California -- Pasadena:
  Crown City - 300 Sourth Raymond.


California -- Sacramento:
  Hogshead Brewing Co. - 114 J Street.
  Rubicon Brewing Co. - 2004 Capitol Avenue.


California -- San Diego:
  Old Columbia - in downtown San Diego.  "The first brewpub in San Diego.
    It has taken the path to long-term success (I suppose) by catering 
    to the yuppie crowd, and their market research must have worked, 
    because the place is always crowded.  The beer isn't bad, but it's 
    a little lacking in character.  A glass wall separates the dining 
    area and brewery, where the tanks and other equipment are visible."
  Mission Brewery - scheduled to open April '90.  "The brewmaster went 
    through a previous incarnation in a back-alley place in Fallbrook 
    (50 mi. north).  I liked his beer there better than Old Columbia's; 
    it had a better flavor and a bit more hops bitterness.  He's 
    currently making beer to sell in 3-4 restaurants around town.  The 
    on-site place is part of a renovation of an old (70 years ago) 
    brewery building near Pacific Highway and Washington St. into 
    a brewery/office/shop complex."


California -- San Francisco:
  San Francisco Brewing Co. - Columbus Ave (near Broadway).
    "Not bad. Nicely decorated and a good atmosphere. Not too Yuppie! 
    The beer's pretty good but not as good as Triple Rock. They've
    only once had an amber, usually it's 2 lager's and a porter. The
    porter's pretty good.'
  Sea Cliff Cafe - 1801 Clement.


California -- San Jose:
  Winchester Brewing Company - "They have three brews, a pale ale, 
    an amber ale, and a stout.  For $2.50, you can get a "sampler", a 
    small glass of each ale.  Operated by a Chinese family so food is 
    Chinese influenced.  Their beers are not hearty--rather thin, but their
    Pale Ale is the hoppiest beer around.  Their "Porter" is so thin that 
    light can shine through it."


California -- San Luis Obispo:
  SLO Brewing - 1119 Garden Street.


California -- Santa Cruz:
  Front Street Pub (Santa Cruz Brewing) - at 516 Front Street in Santa Cruz.
    "It a nice western pub atmosphere, good bar food and Lighthouse Lager.
    Although it was slightly cloudy and the slightest yeast and dyacitil
    in the taste, I rated it a 40. The Lighthouse Amber had a perfect
    copper color and loses a point on body but has terrific drinkability.
    Their Pacific Porter was a sterling application of roasted malt.
    They had bottles to go."  (Out of action temporarily after recent
    earthquake.)
  Sea Bright Brewing Company - at 519 Sea Bright.  "This was a more modern 
    type of a well lit bar and seemed to cater to a young crowd. I tried 
    their sampler which included Pelican Ale, a hoppy ale with a rocky 
    head and wonderful aftertaste.  The Sea Bright Amber was unfiltered 
    and therefore a touch cloudy and yeasty but while the hops dominated 
    the aroma, the taste was more balanced.  Their Batman's Best Bitter 
    was crystal clear, a bit weak on body but the final rating was 
    identical to the Amber.  They also had Kangaroo Pale Ale which 
    contains only 1.5% alcohol.  It was maltier, sweet, had a slight 
    green apple smell and taste and wasn't a great beer."  (Survived 
    recent earthquake without major damage.)


California -- Santa Monica:
  City of Angels Pub/Brewery - opened in Jan.  Brewing and serving Heavenly 
    Gold, Angel Amber, City Light, and one seasonal beer.


California -- Santa Rosa:
  Kelmer's Brew House - Ale, lager, stout, and sometimes porter, all good.
    "This is very new place, refectory tables and darts are the atmosphere."


California -- Truckee:
  Pizza Junction - 11401 Donner Pass Road.


California -- Walnut Creek:
  Devil's Mountain Brewery - on N Main St.  "The Devil Mountain is a 
    'classier' place without being snobbish and brews 6 beers at the 
    moment.  I recommend their Hexenbock Lager as perhaps one of the 
    best lagers I have tasted, I'm not a real lager fan though.  I suspect
    it is one of those love/hate brews as it does have an unusual taste."


California -- Woodland:
  Dead Cat Alley - 666 Dead Cat Alley.


Colorado -- Boulder:
  Boulder Brewing Co. - 1880 Wilderness Place?


Colorado -- Denver:
  The Wynkoop Brewery - The first brew-pub in the Denver area.


Colorado -- Durango:
  Carver Brewing Co.


Colorado -- Vail:
  Alpenstube.


District of Columbia -- 
  Old Heurick Brewing Company - "Headquarters in DC, but currently contract 
    brewed somewhere in PA I think.  Gary Heurick is a 3rd generation 
    brewer. His grandfather had  a brewery in DC at the site of the 
    current Kennedy Center megalith (what a waste!).  Not surprisingly, 
    the operation went under some time after Prohibition.  Gary's
    trying to bring it back, and pushing the DC's-own-beer concept.
    Not bad beer, either, `Old Heurick'.  Based on his grandfather's 
    recipe, the taste and color are somewhat akin to Bass -- full-bodied, 
    though not heavy, and a decent malt/hop aroma. Well carbonated.  A 
    good brew, but not stunning."


Florida -- Gainesville:
  Mill Bakery, Eatery & Brewery - 6791 Newberry Rd. (Oak Mall Plaza).
    "Homebrew for Bud drinkers.  Mostly light beers, all are very light 
    on hops.  Their Weitzen is pretty good though.  This is a chain, ... 
    the beer is the same at each store.  Their `Brewmaster' is a 19 year 
    old kid "who helped somebody make beer once or twice.  All he does 
    is follow directions.  Not impressive."
  The Market Street Pub, Downtown, Gainesville.  "Built by hand by my
    friends Rob Benn and Ed Cooper.  A really tremendous bar in the style
    of an english pub.  Just opened though, so their first batch won't be
    served until Dec 89.  Ed is a fine brewer, so I doubt I'll be
    disappointed."


Florida -- Miami:
  Zum Alten Fritz - 1840 N.E. 4th Ave.


Florida -- Pensacola:
  McGuire's Irish Pub.


Florida -- Tampa:
  Lee Nicholson's Tampa Brewpub - 10330 N.Dale Mabry Hwy.


Florida -- Winter Park:
  Winter Park Brewing - 330 Fairbanks Ave.
    "They make an Ales and Lagers.  The brewmeister's name is Hans.  
    He told me that he uses Stroh's Yeast that he gets from Tampa.  
    I asked him about the Ales and he uses the same yeast but just 
    ferments it at a higher temperature."


Hawaii -- Wailuku:
  Pacific Brewing Co. - P.O. Box 1137.


Idaho -- Caldwell:
  Snake River Brewing Co. - Route 5, Box 30A.


Idaho -- Coeur d'Alene:
  T.W. Fischer's.


Illinois -- Chicago:
  Berghoff (restaurant and bar), 17 W. Adams - "has their own beer (brewed 
    for them, but they are building their own brewery); good Oktoberfests.
  River North Brewery/Sieben Brewing Co. - the first brewpub in Chicago.
  Goose Island Brewery - 1800 N Clyborn (just n. of North Ave. at the corner
    of Willow, Sheffield, and Clyborn).  "Monday nights are Lager Nights and
    Tuesdays are Ale Nights.  The special prices are $1.50 a pint.  Usually
    everything is $3.00.  In addition to their regular Ale and Lager, they
    also have a regular Pils and two or three specialty brews that change
    with the seasons."
  Tap and Growler - 901 W. Jackson.  "This place has some good beer,
    but wasn't very consistent.  The food was the best of the three.  They
    also sell other brands of bottled beer."
  Weinkeller - corner of Roosevelt Rd. and Ridgland Ave. in Berwyn.
    "Over 500 different beers; recently they started brewing their own."


Iowa -- Amana:
  Millstream Brewing Co. - P.O. Box 283.


Kansas -- Lawrence:
  The Free State Brewery - In the 600 block of Massachusetts St.  "The 
    owner has been interested in beer and brewing for some time, and spent 
    the last couple of years putting this together.  Before he could do 
    anything, he had to get Kansas laws changed!  Kansas passed prohibition 
    in the 1880s, and the breweries then in existence closed.  This is 
    the first one to open since.  They make three beers: a Kolsch (a light 
    beer for American tastes), an Ale (which is really *wonderful*), and 
    a bock.  They'll change seasonally. They also have great food and a 
    pleasant atmosphere."


Kentucky -- Ft. Mitchell (Northern Kentucky)
  Oldenberg Microbrewery - Buttermilk Pike.  "Take I-75 south (from 
    Cincinnati) to Buttermilk Pike.  The Brewery is visible from the 
    expressway.  Features a full-bodied premium and a very drinkable 
    blonde.   The beer is a bit pricey from the tap at $2.00 a mug, 
    $7.00 a pitcher.  The premium has a robust taste and finishes 
    smooth.  This beer is among the countries 5 finest beers, a
    definite must try.  The brewery also has a fine collection of
    beer paraphernalia and a German style beer hall with live
    entertainment."


Louisiana -- Abita Springs:
  Abita Brewing Co - P.O. Box 762.


Maine -- Portland:
  Gritty McDuff's.


Maryland -- Baltimore:
  Sisson's Restaurant - "on East Cross Street, a few blocks from the Inner
    Harbor, has become the first brewpub in Maryland.  Sisson's is serving 
    golden and amberales, along with its existing list of about 60 specialty 
    beers and a menu that features Cajun and Creole dishes and fresh seafood."
    Another point of view on Sisson's - "I visited there Nov 89 after 
    reading this posting. I was *not* impressed by the beer -- certainly not 
    enough to drive the 40 minutes it took to get there. The beer was 
    `wimpy', lacking in any substantial body, and not real tasty. Their 
    porter was the best of the three they had, the others being a pilsner 
    (I think), and an amber ale.  At least it had some taste, but again, a 
    Bud had more body. Almost no hop or malt aromas either (per style). I 
    hope they eventually get their act together and do a reasonable beer 
    with guts and spirit."
  Baltimore Brewing Company - scheduled to open on Albemarle Street.  "This
    establishment, to be owned and operated by members of Europe's Grolsch 
    brewing family, will be a German-style restaurant and serve a lager beer."


Maryland -- Glen Burnie:
  The British Brewing Co. - 6759 Baymeadow Dr.  "Until ~Nov. 89 only 
    sold to a chain of bars, now available in bottles, at least in 
    Annapolis, MD; name is Oxford Class.  English style ale, low
    carbonation, nice amber color. Precious little malt/hop aroma.  I 
    didn't find it had a lot of taste, and not much body.  While drinking 
    it, I kept thinking of tap water.  I describe it as `wimpy', but a 
    friend of mine enjoys it quite a bit (he says there's lots-o-hops). 
    The brewer is from England, and he keeps increasing the amount of 
    carbonation from what it typical in England to what can keep 
    Americans pacified. He also seems to be tweaking the recipe in each 
    batch, as subsequent tastings have been different.  I'd recommend 
    drinking this beer at cellar temperature, although the label 
    suggests drinking it cold (Americanism?)."


Massachusetts -- Boston/Cambridge:
  Commonwealth Brewing Company - 85 Merrimac Street; five house brewed 
    beers (not bottled?)  "I had some of their Boston Best Burton Bitter, 
    which was drinkable, but not much more.  A fair sense of the hops,
    moderately bitter, but no real finish, no nose.  Very cloudy, too.
    After that I ordered a pint of the amber ale, which had been very good the
    last time I had been there.  This was a real disaster - almost as dark as a
    porter, but completely bland in taste.  Bud in a can has more taste than
    this stuff.  Overall, a major disappointment.  I'll be in no rush to
    return."
  Cambridge Brewing Company - on Hampshire St just outside of Kendal Square
    (Note - this was written by a part-time bartender there)  "The beer is 
    much better than it was when we first opened.  Tending bar I now hear 
    much more of 'this is really good' than 'this is interesting'."  
  Jacob Wirth's - 31 Stuart and Eliot?
  Wursthaus - at Harvard Square


Massachusetts -- Northampton:
  Northampton Brewery/Brewester Court. - "I can vouch for the quality of 
    their beer and sandwiches, although the atmosphere is a little too 
    much on the fake-marble/brandspankingnew/yuppie side."


Michigan -- Kalamazoo:
  Kalamazoo Brewing Co. - "You can usually get something from there on tap 
    at the Del Rio (on Washington and Ashley), and various other bars may 
    have it in bottles.  Some names you may see: Bell's Beer, Great Lakes 
    Amber Ale, Third Coast Beer.  He makes a couple of stouts (one is 
    called Expedition Stout, and there is a cherry stout), a Porter, some 
    more Ales (one is called Brown Ale or something like that) ... I know 
    that Partners in Wine at Kerrytown (between north 4th and 5th at 
    Kingsley) has them, probably the Village Corner (South University at 
    Forest) does too."

    brands in 1987, Old World Classic Dark and Old World Classic Winter 
    Bock, packaged in liter bottles.  The brewery is also experimenting

New York -- Buffalo:
  Buffalo Brewpub - "This is a local pub in Williamsville (a Buffalo suburb)
    selling a lot of imported beer and producing their own beer and ale to sell
    on the premises.  They produce a dark Amber Ale, and a young Hardy Lager.
    Supposedly they also offer good pub food."


New York -- Ithaca:
  The Chapterhouse - "located on Stewart Avenue at the foot of Cornell
    University opened in the spring of 1989 and has been brewing 3-4 beers
    regularly, as well as making the extracts for very good root beers and 
    ginger ales.  On any given night, there are usually three or four beers 
    very generally described as going from light to dark.  The light is 
    usually a superior reproduction of American Industrial "Lite", while 
    the darker and richer beers, usually a bitter and a stout, seem well 
    rounded and flavorful.  A drawback seems to be the small size of the 
    operation.  There is little capacity to let the beer age and mellow, 
    and we have noticed that the stout in particular is often poured 
    'ahead of its time', leading to a very harsh pint."


New York -- New York City:
  Manhattan Brewery - "Try their Porter."
  New Amsterdam Brewery -
  The Peculier Pub - "is alive and well, and in new and much larger quarters

  Old New York Brewing Co., Inc. -  610 W. 26th St.


New York -- Rochester:
  Rochester Brewpub. - "located at the Marketplace Inn, on Jefferson Road.
    This place is owned by the same people as the Buffalo Brewpub. They
    serve several of their own brews, and all are mediocre.  The food
    is poor, and the service is worse.  There are better places to drink
    in Rochester."

Ohio -- Cincinnati:
  Wallaby Bob's - Australian Brewpub.  "Wallaby Bob's is in a mall, and

    sampled their wares."

    Pass Roadhouse).  "These feature many of the Northwest brews and 
    international brews.  Good food.  Watch out for their own brews, 
    however -- just not up to the NW quality of microbrews."


Pennsylvania -- Adamstown:
  Stoudt's Brewery - in Adamstown, near Lancaster, Pa.  "Has been open for 
    about two years.  Stoudt's is located in a large beer hall/flea market

    wonderful side."


Pennsylvania -- Pittsburgh:
  Pennsylvania Brewing Co. - "Just opened its brewpub on the North Side
    of Pittsburgh.  The beer, Penn Pilsener, which has been brewed in 
    Smithton, Pa., is good and has a dark roast barley taste for a pilsener.  
    The Jones brewery in Smithton still will make the bottled stuff.  But 
    the Northside Brewery will make the draft stuff.  They make about 5 
    different kinds now: A wheat beer, a dark beer, the regular stuff, a 
    light lager, and a type called Kaiser Pils.  They will be serving a 
    full menu of light German fare (whatever that is)."

Virgin Islands -- St. Thomas:
  Island Brewing and Malting, Ltd. - P.O. Box 5310.


Virginia -- Charlottesville:
  Blue Ridge Brewery - 709 West Main Street; "owned by William Faulkner's 
    grandsons.  They brew four types of beer: their Hawksbill Lager is 
    their best-selling brand, but has the weakest body--it is similar to 
    most U.S. industrial beers in character.  Piney River Lager is 
    another pilsner-style lager, but has significantly more body and 
    flavor--it is reminiscent of the lagers of Southern Germany.  Afton 
    Ale is a hopheads dream; it is an amber bitter ale made with 5 types 
    of hops and has a sharp lingering hops flavor but a somewhat thin 
    body.  Humpback Stout is a rich creamy stout with the flavor of roast 
    malt and is neither overly bitter nor too sweet.  Occasionally 
    seasonal beers are offered; the first of these was a wheat beer
    offered in mid-summer 1989--a bock is planned for spring 1990."


Virginia -- Virginia Beach:
  Virginia Brewing Co.  (Formerly Chesapeake Bay Brewing Co.)  
    "Its brewmeister, Wolfgang Roth, was educated in German beer
    institutes and produces a *fantastic* pair of brews -- Gold Cup 
    Pilsner and Virginia Native Dopplebock. The pilsner is about as from 
    from Urquell as you can imagine -- nice sharp hop bite, lots of body; 
    a well balanced but but by no means delicate brew. Virginia Native is 
    a heavy thirst-quenching brew with (again) lots of body, and a 
    screaming hop bite and aroma. One of the `wettest' beers I have ever 
    tasted. Both -- until ~August 89 -- were only available at a certain 
    chain of DC area bars; Gold Cup is now available in bottles (around 
    DC at least). I also got a keg of Gold Cup (wonderful, but pricey), 
    and I hear I can get Virginia Native in kegs too.  I've also heard 
    that a modified Native will be available in bottles as a 
    Christmastime beer -- name unknown. This stuff has guts and spirit 
    like the Grants beers I had in Seattle, but is much better balanced, 
    and has higher consistency, batch-to-batch."

  Hales Ales Ltd. - 701 N. Main St.

Washington -- Kirkland:
  Kirkland Roaster - "A very good restaurant with an outstanding bar--a
    gleaming copper bartop with what seemed to be over 20 handles serving
    microbrewed beer!  Wow!  And you can look through the glass
    windows into the Hale's Ales brewery next door.  (Love their
    slogan--'Give 'em Hale's!')"

  Kemper Brewing Co. - P.O. Box 4689.


Washington -- Seattle:
  The Big Time Brewery Alehouse - "On University Way (also known as the Ave),
    one block from campus.  Very good place.  Turns out that it's owned 
    by the same guy who owns the Triple Rock Brewery in Berkeley, CA.  
    Exact same formula.  Same three beers.  Same decor.  Same everything.
    Only the name is stupider up here, and the pale ale is a little
    weak (probably needs to brew longer).  I did not try the pale ale.  
    The porter was a little thin tasting (although it was plenty dark).  
    It also seemed a bit on the dry side.  It was leaning towards being a 
    stout.  The amber ale was very fruity tasting and a bit sweet.  Someone 
    in our group thought it was too sweet."
  Murphy's Pub - In the U district in Seattle, out west on 45th.  "Great
    pub!  They usually have all the micro brewery beers on tap and lots
    of english/irish beers too."
  Blue Moon - "Has half a dozen ales on tap -- Hale's Celebration Porter, 
    Hale's Special Bitter, Ballard Bitter, Red Hook ESB, Grant's IPA, 
    Grant's Scottish, Grant's Russian Imperial Stout, and Grant's 
    Cider... whoops! that's NINE!"
  Noggins - "This is owned by the same people who run the Spinnaker in 
    Victoria, B.C.  They serve six or seven of their own brews on tap.  
    They serve each beer at the right temperature.  I have spoken to 
    their brewmaster and he knows what he is doing.  I have not tried 
    their wheat beer, but the general consensus is that it is bad 
    (with the exception of a female friend of mine who loves it).  They 
    have two locations (and the dark ale is slightly different at each. 
    One is in the University District, at the SE corner of Brooklyn 
    Ave. NE and NE 42nd Street.  The other is in Westlake Center."
  The Redhook Brewery - "Does have a bar on site.  However, it is not a
    true brewpub since their beer is available on draft and in bottles 
    elsewhere.  Their address is 3400 Phinney Ave N (I believe)."
