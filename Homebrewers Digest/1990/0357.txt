Subject: a plea - don't send huge postings


I STRONGLY urge the folks on this list not to send huge messages - such as
large "lists of stuff" - in single postings to the homebrew list.  The
recent posting of brewpubs is what provoked me to send this, although I
want to point out that (a) the list was interesting, useful, etc., and (b)
I particularly don't want to single out this posting.


The problem is that BIG MAIL MESSAGES BREAK THINGS!!!  There are various
limits on how big a mail message can be...some mailers choke on > 32 K or
> 64 K; some Internet sites reject messages > 50 K and most reject > 100 K.


Can we find a way to stash large compilations, etc., where folks can grab
them when they want them, without sending them to the entire list?  Could
the digestifier reject messages above a certain size?  I would like to
keep Rob from getting hassled by lots of bounce messages.

Subject: Sanitizing in dishwasher




In Homebrew Digest #356, Jeff Close asked about sanitizing in a dishwasher.


I've never tried sanitizing equipment in the dishwasher, but I did sanitize
bottles in the dishwasher for the last two batches of brew.  I first cleaned
them out using the bottle brush (to get rid of any built up scum).  I
then loaded them all in the dishwasher on "rinse"--with nothing in the soap
tray.  Seemed to work well, and was definitely easier than past washing
and sanitizing efforts.  Take this with a grain of salt though because the
beer isn't done aging yet so I can't say whether or not it had any effect
on the beer itself.
I can fit a case of bottles in the bottom rack, so it takes two iterations
to clean them all.  I'm sure the drying temperature inside is hot enough
to kill anything that might have lingered after the scrubbing and rinsing.


Hoppy brewing,

I missed out on it too, but it's the ``Break the Bottle Habit'' one, with a
soda-keg smashing bottles on the cover.


Unfortunately, not nearly as informative as the yeast issue: only three
rather anemic articles. Too bad because everyone would love to be kegging
... if they knew how to do it reasonably cheaply.

Subject: brewpub list addition




Here's a nifty place that I can't morally allow to be left off the list:


San Francisco:


        The Toronado - Haight Street
                This place has an amazing selection of microbrews, perhaps
like nowhere else in the nation.  They typically have 13 brews on tap,
usually 6-8 of which are local microbrews, e.g., try the blue whale ale or
devils brew stout.  They also have about 50 microbrews in bottles, not to
mention other hard to find imports and fun things like soki.  Very trendy
haight-esque crowd which seems uninterested in the amazing selection - wear
black if you want to fit in.

An addition to:


  Baltimore Brewing Company - scheduled to open on Albemarle Street.  "This
    establishment, to be owned and operated by members of Europe's Grolsch 
    brewing family, will be a German-style restaurant and serve a lager beer."


It did open, and it's been well worth the wait. Currently three beers:
Helles (rich, full-bodied, well-hopped), Pils (lighter, also full-bodied
and very well hopped), and Dunkle (dark, full-bodied, malty). All very
good, German-style beers. The guy I talked to said they are going to be
offering a bock and a weizen as the seasons evolve. I've been there twice,
and the character of the beer has been slightly variable, due largly to the
newness of the place. Very busy on weekend evenings. Reasonably good German
food, too, and all at fair prices.

Subject: Kegging -- supplier Foxx sells an affordable kit!


I got a catalog from Foxx -- supplier of draft and soda systems for
restaurants and such. They had an xeroxed addendum in front showing a
kegging kit for $152. It includes:
        + Cornelius 5 gallon keg (ball or pin)
        + CO2 cannister
        + Single-guage regulator
        + Hoses
        + Connectors
        + Picnic-type faucet
For an additional $6, they'll upgrade it to a two-guage regulator. This is
the cheapest price I've seen; I've not had much luck trying to track down
cheaper (under $100) systems based on used equipment...


Has anyone else ordered from them? Any other leads on suppliers? 


Contrary to some other reports here, I'm not having much luck getting used
kegs from Coke or retailers for ``free or low cost'' (but I will keep
trying!).

Subject: re: List of Brewpubs




Walt Thode's list of brewpubs (Homebrew Digest #356) is great! This is
incredibly useful information....whenever I travel somewhere I like
to know where I can get a good glass of beer at the end of the day.
Asking hotel desk clerks is futile.  The only success I've ever had
in asking people about these places was in Boston where a friendly
cabbie told me to try the Winter Warmer and the stout at the Commonwealth
Brewery.  I did, and he was right.  Both were great!  
But I've had people tell me that great beers could be had at places only
to find the most exotic beer be draft Guinness or Dortmunder.
A few people took the time to send Walt mini-reviews with their opinions
about brewpub offerings.  Can we please get a few more of these??? I'd
be especially interested in seeing reviews of the places in Minnesota
and Wisconsin as I know I'll be going there this coming summer.
Cheers!

I do this all the time.  When I start brewing a batch, I put everything that
will fit (wort chiller, funnels, measuring cups, hoses, fermentation locks)
in the dishwasher.  The carboy doesn't fit so I sanitize that with bleach
solution separately.  Remember to let the dishwasher run through a complete
dry cycle.  When I used to bottle my beer I would run all the bottles through
the dishwasher and fill them as I removed them.  I always run the items to
be sanitized through without adding anything to the dishwasher although adding
a sanitizing agent would probably be fine.  If you use the dishwasher be sure
that it doesn't have any rinse agents such as "Jet Dry" in it.


Note: my dishwasher preheats all its water to temperatures much higher than
the water heater.  I'm not sure how well dishwashers which do not preheat
their water would do at sanitizing.

My question is not "will this work?" but "why take something simple
(sanitizing) and make it complicated?"  However, to answer the question, the
wash cycle of most dishwashers is only 5-10 minutes, after which it will start
rinsing.  I'd recommend a longer time for sanitizing.  The minimum time needed,
of course, depends on the concentration of your sanitizing solution.


Remember the adage seen in this mailing list before "Clean first, then
sanitize."  If you clean your equipment immediately after use, rinsing alone
should handle most of it, then add elbow grease, then washing soda (if really
necessary).  If you then store it in a reasonably clean area, it shouldn't need
to be cleaned again before use.  To sanitize just before use, soak in a
bleach/water solution - there's no need for hot water here.  I use skin
temperature water since I reach into it fairly often.


I've noticed that opinions vary widely on "correct" sanitizing technique.  I've
minimized details here in order to minimize flames.

Subject: reproducibility


I've been a brewer and a subscriber for quite a while now
and yet, I never really have been saving any of the recipes
that have come across this digest because I really have little
faith in my ability to reproduce them.  Recently, someone
posted an article that mentioned this point.  It went something
like, "...if my roommate is able to reproduce the flavor
using my recipe, I'll post..."


My question is this: how much success have you had in reproducing
beers from other's recipes? The only way to judge this would be
something like making someone's "Oatmeal Stout" clone recipe and
seeing if it really does taste like Sam Smith's.

Subject: Dishwasher for Sanitation...




I would not treat this as an ideal sanitizing method for two reasons.
First, someone wrote in a while ago that when they put flour in the
bottles to see if they were rinsed enough on the inside, the flour
was still in the bottle after a cycle.  You could probably use the
"sanitize" setting on your dishwasher for heat-sanitizing your
bottles after rinsing out by hand any leftover crud (provided your
dishwasher gets hot enough to kill bugs).


Another consideration is to make sure all the labels are off of the
bottles before you run the dishwasher.  I tried this once only to
discover smelly black smoke coming out of the vents on the dry
cycle.  In the bottom of the washer by the heating coils, there
was a pile of smoldering labels.  Maybe that's just because I buy
cheap beer for bottles (Falls City), and the labels come off of these
bottles very easy in comparison to more mainstream brands.

Andy Wilcox <andy`at`mosquito.cis.ufl.edu> made some comments about
this in HOMEBREW Digest #312, Wed 29 November 1989.  I would
offer one caveat: if you are sanitizing bottles, beware of
labels coming loose and clogging the plumbing.  (more of a
problem with foreign bottles than domestic ones) Otherwise, it
worked fine the one time I tried it.

California -- Santa Cruz:
  Front Street Pub (Santa Cruz Brewing) - at 516 Front Street in Santa Cruz.
    "It a nice western pub atmosphere, good bar food and Lighthouse Lager.
    Although it was slightly cloudy and the slightest yeast and dyacitil
    in the taste, I rated it a 40. The Lighthouse Amber had a perfect
    copper color and loses a point on body but has terrific drinkability.
    Their Pacific Porter was a sterling application of roasted malt.
    They had bottles to go."  (Out of action temporarily after recent

They are back in action.  I visited there at the end of December

Greetings friends...


I don't usually read this discussion, so please post replies directly to

benefit of a friend without NET access....


My friend is constructing a personal still, and is on a quest for a boiler
made of steel or copper, rather than the aluminum which is so common...
This is the boiler whose vapors are trapped, so one which is specifically
designed for this purpose would be best... Any possible sources would be
most appreciated!


(and for myself -- addresses for the best mail-order houses you have used
