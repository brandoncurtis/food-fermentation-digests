In today's digest, Chris Shenton tells of an affordable kegging kit
from Foxx. I would be interested in geting their catalog; do you have
an address I can use? ~$160 is still a lot of money, but I may talk
myself into it anyway...

Subject: Finding good pubs/stores


A recent poster said good things about reviews of pubs, microbreweries,
and such, and noted that it was difficult to find a good pub when
visiting a strange city.  Since I occasionally travel on business
(for Texas Instruments), I end up in a strange city and have the
same problem.  Besides the pub list I have been making for several
years (incorporated into the previously posted list), and the numerous
magazines on beers, there is one other very good option.


While most people you ask, at hotels and such, won't be able to tell you
where to buy beers to take home or pubs to drink at, look in the
phone book and call any local homebrew shop!  They will probably
know what the best local bars are and can help you.

I got a "pressure canner" from Sears many years ago.  It's got about a
20 quart capacity (it's at home, so I can't be sure), and is stainless
steel.  (Got to be if you're doing acidic stuff like tomatoes.)  Cost
about $80 at the time.

Interesting that the topic of reproducing recipes has come up.  At the
Fat Chance we are discussing that among ourselves.  Our problem, though,
is trying to make two batches using the same recipe turn out similar.
We are working on it, and our Klisterbrau (imperial stout) always tastes
about the same.


As for pubs, it was nice to see the list, here's some comments on the two
places which I've sampled in Utah.


Squatter's Pub and Brewery - 175? West Broadway, Salt Lake City.  Trendy
industrial yupster decor, with a very good variety of food.  Their Buffalo
wings are the best in town.  The stock beers are a pale ale which is good,
an amber ale which is much like many of the other amber ales I've tasted from
micros, and a stout which does a good job of providing flavor despite the laws
here holding it to 3.2 alcohol.  It is my favorite.  They usually have a fourth
specialty beer, like their holiday Nut Brown, or their current offering,
Winter Wheat.


Wasatch Pub - Main Street, Park City.  One gets the impression this place is
more devoted to making money than beer, but the Schirf brothers aren't quite
that bad.  They were the ones who pushed the legislation through making pub
brewerys legal.  Similar style to Squatter's, again a good range of food but
the Wasatch Wings aren't that great.  The amber tastes much like Squatter's,
the stout has gotten much better due to the competition, the Slickrock Lager
is quite drinkable.  Can get extremely crowded during ski season.

In HBDigest 356, Jeff Close asks about sanitizing in the dishwasher.


I do this regularly -- mostly for bottles, but other things too. Here's
my protocol: as I finish a homebrew, I thoroughly rinse the bottle to get
all traces of sediment out, then store them until next use. Just before
I bottle I put two cases of empties plus a few spares into the bottom,
inverted, one bottle per little wire thing. In ours, if you tilt one bottle
toward the back and one toward the front, you can use nearly all the little
wired doo-dads. I run the dishwasher with regular dishwasher detergent
powder, and when it fills and begins running, throw in about 1/2 cup of
bleach and let the thing run through the whole cycle. I do not use the
heated drying cycle, but open the door after the last rinse. The bottles
are very hot at this point. I leave them inverted until just prior to
filling. I am a relative newcomer to homebrewing, and so I say this
with fingers crossed -- I have never had an infection. I have done about
2 dozen 5 gallon batches using this technique every time.


I have never tried to fit my fermenter or carboy in there, but if yours
fit, go for it. Especially if you use plastic vessels you want to find a
way to clean them with absolutely no abrasion which can scratch the plastic
and give the bad brew bugs hiding places to breed and plot the overthrow
of your Yeast Monoculture Republic. I also don't think a dishwasher would
be much good for hoses or piping, but the miscellaneous spoons, sieves,
and so on just naturally go there.


I've been reading this digest quite a while now, and have gotten many
helpful hints and learned a lot from it -- thanks to all for keeping this
the quality information source it is.

I haven't tried it with a fermenter (they are all too big to fit in my
dishwasher).  So I just fill the fermenter with bleach solution and toss
everything else in there, too.


But when it comes to bottling, I can fit two cases of bottles in at once
(top and bottom racks).  Contrary to other people's experience, I tried
the "flour test" once (putting flour in about eight of the bottles in
different positions on the top and bottom racks) and found them all
nicely cleaned.


All the bottles go in upside down (hanging through the holes in the top rack).
Then the dishwasher goes through a rinse and "heated dry" cycle.  It is the
"heated dry" that sanitizes, due to the steam created (yes, *steam).

Subject: Boiling with the lid on


Does anybody boil their wort with the lid on the kettle?


You may be aware that a _lot_ of your wort goes up in steam during a 60 
minute boil.  Boiling with the lid on would use a lot less energy.  
Using a lower burner temperature might also help prevent scorching.


I see only two drawbacks to this:


        1.  Less of that wonderful smell.  Then again, my wife doesn't
            think it's all that great, so no terrible loss there.


        2.  You would have to pull the lid off every few minutes to stir
            it.  You would also have to keep a close eye on things to
            avoid a boil over.


Anybody know if there would be any adverse effects?  How about the hot 
break or hop utilization?  Would I get some of that wonderful aroma 
condensed back into the wort, or would I just be mucking things up?  How 
do the breweries do it?  (I may get to tour one next month, but not yet. 
:-)


Thanks in advance,

Subject: Wheat Beer Extras?




I have a can of Ireks wheat extract and a packet of Wyeast wheat beer
yeast on the way and am wondering what simple extra ingredients I might
add to an all wheat beer in order to make things a little more interesting.
Any suggestions or past experiences (do's and dont's)?  Thanks..
