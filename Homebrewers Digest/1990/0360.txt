Foxx Equipment Co in Denver and Kansas City sell parts for soda pop
type kegs. They have washers, valves, quick-connects and all other
parts need for kegs. They have advertised in Zymurgy, and sell a
homebrew keg kit and a bottle filler kit. I have bought various parts
from them and have been satisfied.

William's Brewing sells a temperature controller that allows
you to maintain the temperature of a fridge or freezer from
20 to 80 degrees F plus or minus 2 degrees.  The address and
phone number for William's Brewing was posted in Homebrew
digest #359.

Rob,


The last Digest I received was # 354 on February 8, 1989.
Are you receiving errors from my side again? (If I've missed
any could you send or tell me where I could obtain them?)


uunet!prcrs!link is my address.


Thanks,

I'd double-check that one.  First, $80 is pretty cheap for a stainless 
pressure canner.  Second, it's quite unusual (tho not unheard of) to use
stainless for a canner.  It isn't really necessary, because a "canner" is
just the pot you use to heat jars full of stuff in home canning.  The food
is already in glass containers when you put it in the canner; the acid
doesn't matter.  (Tomatoes are normally canned in an "open" [unpressurized]
canner anyway, since they're acidic, but that's irrelevant here.)  The
weight of a pressure vessel could fool you into thinking it's steel--an
aluminum pressure cooker is heavy because it's got very thick walls
compared to other pots.


So, while I'm not saying you're wrong, I'd check it carefully.  A magnet
will give you a half test:  If the magnet sticks to the pot, you know it's
steel rather than aluminum.  (If it doesn't stick, you don't know for sure
since good stainless is also non-magnetic.)

About a year ago, I was wondering the same thing, but decided to take
a more direct approach.  I asked a friend of mine in the chemistry 
department about it.  "Hey, if I brought over a bottle, could you run it
through a calorimeter for me?"  He replied "I doubt it, but if you bring 
over six bottles, maybe we can talk".  (-:


I still haven't gotten around to it, though.  I'll post when the experiment
is done.

I believe Williams has a thermostat control to do just that. It should work
fine for freezer or fridge. It's non-intrusive (doesn't require cutting
holes or wires). I think the price was about $60, which seems kind of high
to me; I haven't ever ordered from them, so I don't know, but their catalog
is very informative.

How 'bout a line in the header of the digest saying where the archive
is?

Comparison of Homebrew Suppliers:  Representative Prices and Products
1990 Feb 16  Fri 15:09    Chris Shenton  (chris`at`asylum.GSFC.NASA.GOV)






INTRODUCTION


The following lists unit prices for a sample of supplies from a number of
vendors.  These are only representative data points on some of the more
common items and should help in deciding where to shop. Some vendors sell
in small quantities, and some only in large quantities, but give bulk
prices.  Consult the notes following the table for addresses and
information about quantities.  Please send me any other vendors you have
information about so I can keep this list current. Thanks for your support.




SELECTION PHILOSOPHY


I didn't include most specialty grains (or specialty items) because they
are ordered in small quantities.  Prices selected are for lowest-cost
variety available; for example, if US and German Munich malt is available,
I quote the cheaper US variety.


When price or amount depends on quantity ordered, I've tried to select an
amount suitable for a couple of batches, because that's the way I would
order by mail. For example, if there are 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 Lb bags of grain,
I used the 20 Lb price because that seems like a realistic purchase
quantity -- enough for about two batches.  Likewise, if there's a 6-can
discount on a case of extract, I quote that price, rather than the higher
per-can price.  With hops, same deal: if there were 1, 2, 5, 10 oz packs,
I'd quote the 5 oz pack price.




OTHER SUPPLIERS


There are a couple suppliers which do not fit in the chart because they
specialize in only one item, or sell somewhat unusual items.  They are
included separately from the chart and its addresses.  (Freshops is
force-fit into the chart below, however).




PERUSAL


My guinea pig said he found the raw data too overwhelming and would prefer
a more iconic style. Therefore, I've taken my numbers (price per quantity),
and broken things into intervals, then marked them using the familiar $,
$$, $$$, $$$$ notation.


Then, for each supplier, I averaged the interval-measure of each available
ingredient to get an average value for all that supplier's merchandise.
Presented in an iconic form at the extreme right, this shows at a glance
which dealers are expensive (e.g.: Wine & Brew By You) and which are cheap
(e.g.: Green Acres and Brew For Less [I would hope so with a name like
that! :-]). Note that this ignores unavailable ingredients, and therefore
variety/selection; companies with only a couple inexpensive items (e.g.:
Freshops) come out looking good, too.


After the body of the chart, I list the minimum, average, and maximum
prices for the items, in dollars per the quantity-measure specified in the
column heading.


If you want more detailed info, send me a note and I'll send you the raw
data.




FEEDBACK


I would be willing to maintain a list of user reports for each vendor. Send
me any comments on ones you have dealt with: price, knowledge, quality,
freshness, turn-around time, etc. I'll compile and send out updates every
now and then.


If you have other vendors I didn't include, send me a line or two with the
prices calculated for the ingredients in this table. (I can't afford to
keep current on all the dealers!)




DISCLAIMER


Some suppliers will have inevitably been omitted. These include places with
no catalog (eg: Col.  John's), places which charge for catalogs (eg: Brass
Corkscrew / Brewer's Warehouse), and places I am not aware of. I apologize
for any omissions.


(The obligatory null-statement indicating my opinions are no one else's.)

If you mean the one ``Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy'', I just bought it
today. It was reprinted by ... uh ... Angus or something in England, 1988
(at least). I paid five bucks. Looks amusing, tho I haven't had time to
scrutinize it.

Subject: temperature controller for freezer


TO: Michael Berry


     Hunter (the ceiling fan people) make a temperature
controller for air conditioners.  This unit plugs into the wall,
and you can plug your refrigerator or freezer into it.  The unit
has a temperature probe which can be placed in the
refrigerator/freezer.  The controller settings can be set to any
temperature within 1 degree (digital) accurracy in the range 32-
ambient, and adjusts the temperature of the appliance by
interrupting the main power.  The Hunter unit costs about $45
retail; sometimes you can find them on sale for $39.  There are
similar units on the market which are cheaper.  I have had mine
for one year and it has performed  great.  If you need more
information, don't hesitate to give me a shout.

My first batch was a Geordie Scotch Ale, or something like that. It turned
out to have little carbonation, and no head. Also, a mild off-taste that
faded if the beer was cold. I blame myself, not the kit; I figure I didn't
clean things well enough, and didn't rinse the bleach from the bottles
sufficiently. Recommendation: get a Ken's Jet bottle rinser and a
Vin-something sterilizer. $25 for both, and a real time/labor saver. (this
has not been a paid advertisement).

My second and all subsequent batches were done like this with good to
outstanding results. Never had the Henry stuff so I don't know. Get a hold
of Papazians book for a good source of recipies. Also, if I can figure how
to get the digest feature working for my mail reader, I'll send you the
ones I've been collecting from HBD -- some extract, some grain. Should give
you a start, anyway.

Subject: Cleaning Beer Bottles in the Dishwasher


Let me say that the suggestion offered by andy`at`ufl.edu (use the dish
washer to clean out the bottles) is probably the best labor-saving
brewing hint that I've seen on the net to date.


Being a bachelor, I don't generate a lot of dirty dishes.  There are
generally just a few things after each meal: whatever I used to cook
(no prepared foods bought here, sorry Nat'l Frozen Food Council) and
of course the plate and serving dishes.  I clean them daily, in the
sink; the dishwasher had languished unused since I bought the house.


Almost immediately upon reading the suggestion, I loaded some empties
into the dishwasher.  Funny, isn't it, how there always seems to be a
good supply of bottles awaiting cleaning.  Well, I filled that
dishwasher (holds perhaps two cases) before long, ran it, and
resolved to never hand-wash another bottle.


I urge other readers to do the same.  It's easier to wash the dishes
by hand and dedicate the dishwasher to beer bottles, if that is your
choice.  I recently removed the upper rack so that champagne bottles
would fit.
