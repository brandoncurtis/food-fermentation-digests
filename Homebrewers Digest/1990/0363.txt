Subject: hop planting


   It's that time of year again. I contacted Freshhops and was
told that they will begin selling hop rhizomes the first week
in March. They will cost $2-4.50 depending upon type. The types
that are few in number (e.g. Saaz) will be more expensive. They
said they will almost certainly have Cascade, Willamette,
Hallertau, Tettnang, Saaz and Bullion.


  Here is the info on the two suppliers I know of:


  Freshhops
  36180 Kings Valley
  Philomath, Oregon  97370
  (503) 929 2736


  Marysville Oast
  866 NE Thousand Oaks
  Corvallis, Oregon  97330


  If somebody out there has a phone number for Marysville Oast
I'd appreciate seeing it.

The volume of the earth is approximately 10^21 cubic meters.


Did you hear the one about the medieval king who was rescued from bandits by
a kind soul?  The king offered to pay the rescuer whatever reward he wished.
Being a brewer, the Samaritan requested the king give him a chessboard.  On the
first square, put one grain of barley.  On the second, two grains of barley.
On the third, four grains, on the fourth, eight grains, etc, each time doubling
the amount of barley.  The king agreed to such a seemingly simple request.
In the end, the king found himself unable to pay, since the total amount of
barley was about 1/3 the volume of the earth.


But seriously.  I strongly recommend that you try to obtain a good balance or
scale to measure mass of ingredients, rather than volume.  Hops can vary con-
siderably depending upon its amount of compression.  Mass of grains can vary
depending upon contents of water.  I found my scales at garage sales.  I've
seen others at second hand stores.


A more important parameter is the extraction efficiency of ingredients.
Refer to Greg Noonan's book for a list of these.  I've found by using these
along with his formulas for degree Balling, that I come real close to
the og of my brews.


Happy brewing, Florian.
