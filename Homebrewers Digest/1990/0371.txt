As a physicist and a homebrewer, I'll wave my arms on this one -- by the
way, I've noticed it too.
1) No matter how thick the iron of your pot, it still is a major source of
heat loss.  The pot will be at a lower temperature than the center of the 
mash, since it is in thermal contact with the room air.
2) The thermal conductivity of the mash is pretty poor, thus there will
be a temperature difference between the mash near the wall of the pot and 
the mash in the center.
3) When you stir, you mix all this up, and lower the temperature of the
mash at the center.


Moral:
For uniform mash temperature, stir constantly or use an insulated box.


>>My theory is that there is different thermal conductivity of the grains and
>>water and that when stirring, the thermometer is in contact with the water
>>more than the grains and when at rest it's in contact with the grains more
>>than the water.


Regarding your theory:  the grains and water will have different thermal 
conductivities, but since the grains are small, I would imagine that the 
time scales for grains to equilibrate to the nearby water are pretty 
small (seconds or less), so they would be at the same temperature regardless.
In addition, I don't see how stirring will affect whether the thermometer 
is in contact with the grains or water.


Hope this help you relax etc.    Jeff Casey  MIT Plasma Fusion Center

Subject: Beer Cake!?!?


     Since we're discussing recipies using beer as an ingredient, here's one 
thats been a favorite of mine for quite a while:


     Beer Cake


     Dry stuff:  2C Sugar
                 3C Flour
               0.5C Cocoa
                 1t Salt
                 2t Baking Soda
              
     Liquids:  0.75C Oil
                  4t Vinegar
                  1t Vanilla
                0.5C Water
                12oz Beer          (Porter or Stout would compliment the
                                    cocoa, but even Bud works quite well)


     Procedure:


     Sift all dry ingredients together into a large bowl, make three wells in
     the dry mixture (one large and two small).  Pour the oli into the large 
     well, the vinegar into one of the small wells, and the vanilla into the
     other small well.  Pour beer over the mixture, and add water to the
     mixture.  Mix well.  Bake for 25-30 mins at 350F.  Serve with whipped
     cream and enjoy!


     Try it, you'll like it!!

Subject: Mild Ale recipe


Pete Soper asks what yeast did I use in in my Mild Ales.  Here's the
recipe:


For 10 gallons:


5   lbs. Klages (2 row) Malt
4         Mild Malt
2         80L Crystal
0.5         English Pale Malt
0.5         Flaked Barley
0.2         Chocolate


Bittering Hops:
1   oz.         Willamette Leaf (5.9%)
1/8         Cascade Leaf (6.7%)
1/8         Eroica Leaf (13.4%)


Flavoring Hops:
0.5 oz.        Willamettte Leaf


Water Treatment:
Medium soft water
2 gm.         MgSO4
2         CaSO4
2         KCl
2         CaCO3


Mash in all grains to 3 gallons of water at 134F.  Hold 120-125 for :55.
Raise to 157F for :50 (iodine negative after :10);  raise to 172F for :15.
Sparge with 5.75 gal. (first runnings 1.079, final 1.006).  Boil til break
(:15), add bittering hops, boil :55, add flavoring hops, boil :10.


Pitched 5 gallons with Sierra Nevada and 5 with Wyeast's "Northern
Whiteshield" (no, I don't have the number recorded).  OG 1.031, FG of
SN was 1.011 (~2.5% v/v), NW 1.014 (~2% v/v).  Kegged both with 90 gms
dextrose in each.


Notes:  This is the only beer that I could make 10 gallons of on my
stove.  I did this by mashing and boiling a big 5 gallon beer and then
adding boiled, cooled water to get 10 gallons.  The Sierra Nevada Mild
was fairly dry and a little thin.  The NW was a bit sweet and rich beyond
its gravity.  The light priming gave these beers the traditional light
carbonation appropriate for English style beers.  Both had an emphasis
on malt, with crystal and chocolate bringing up the rear;  the hops
were noticable but not in the foreground.  Both beers went fast.
I brewed this 1/31/88 and kegged it on 2/20.


With my keg brewery, I could probably make a barrel of this, but then I'd
have to buy 6 more Cornelius kegs!

Subject: Question on bottling time


I need some suggestions about when to bottle.  Most of the books
describe a beer as having an OG about 1034-1040 and being bottled
around 1005.  So far, my beers have never gotten below 1011.  Some
of this is because I usually brew slightly stronger beers (1040-1050).


In this case, Norman Conquest Ale, the process was
Day        OG
 -2                Start MEV #13 yeast (liquid yeast)
0        1066        Pitch the yeast at about 70-75 degrees
2                Fermentation starts (I was sweating it that second day!)
6        1032        Put into secondary fermenter
10        1026


It seems to be fermenting very slowly now.  At what point would you
suggest I bottle?

Subject: Red Star Yeast


Yeah, almost everyone says mean things about red-star.  It may not be
the critic's choice, and I generally use re-cultured dog-bolter, but
I keep packets of red-star in the fridge for safety.


It's fast, it's reliable, and it's pretty good.
