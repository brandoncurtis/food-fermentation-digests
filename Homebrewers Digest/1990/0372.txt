Cyser is apple cider, fortified with honey. It's not beer.

Subject: yeast vs. temp.


I have a question regarding temperature of fermentation vs. type of yeast 
used.  I've used either a packet of yeast that comes with an extract kit, a 
package of Doric ale yeast, or both, in all brews I've made so far.  All of 
my fermentations were done in the cellar which has been pretty cold this 
winter (maybe about 62 F) and the beers have been rather tasty.  My 
question is this: does it matter if you use a lager yeast at these 
temperatures, or even warmer temperatures?  Some of the recipes in 
Papzian's book call for lager yeast, but don't require brewing at lagering 
temperatures.  I've been told that brewing at higher temperatures using 
lager yeast results in "steam beer".  What is characteristically different 
about steam beers?


                        Hoppily yours,
                        Chuck Coronella

        I've heard recently from two different sources that the
        Boulder Brewing Company is having some serious problems.


        Is this true?  If so, what's the story??


        It doesn't really affect me since Boulder isn't sold in
        Minnesota -- I'm just curious.


        Cheers,
