Has anyone heard the outcome of the AHA "Hail to Ale"  club contest.
   The judging was set for Feb 10th.  I sent in an entry to represent our
   club but have yet to hear from the AHA.  The contest was for India Pale
   Ales.  I am supposed to get back a copy of the judging for my beer.  Is
   the AHA just slow?

Hi, All!


In dig 374, the Zentners write (in reply to me):


>You and I must have two different versions of Papazians book.
>The recipe for Barshack Gingermead in Appendix 5 (I think) clearly
>does not include any malt.  It does include only honey and dextrose
>as sourcs of fermentables, and a small amount of hops, the purpose

>a "preservative").  


No, we don't have 2 different versions of Papazian's book.  I got my recipes 
crossed, and do humbly apologize!  You *do* have a mead, there.


How long a mead ferments depends mostly on the honey content (obviously).  How 
dry the finished mead is, _vs_ how sweet, depends on how long you permit the 
fermentation to continue with respect to the honey content.  A relatively 
small amount of honey, permitted to ferment until fermentation ceases, will 
usually be very light and dry.


As honey is, in and of itself, a preservative to some extent, I would venture 
to guess (don't have Papazian in front of me, here at work) that the hops is 
in this instance a bittering agent.  Most mead recipes call for the addition 
of citrus or strong tea to balance out the sweetness of the mead, making it 
sweet without being cloying.


Hope that this has helped, and that this time I got everything right!  :-)




                         Yours in Carbonation,


                                      Cher

        I am quite new to this hombrew thing (I just pinched the yeast
(I do so love all the technical terms) into my very first batch), but
already I am prepared to expand my horizons, specifically, I would like
to know about ginger recepies. I like ginger. Lots. Straight. And I
noticed that Papazian mentions it as a possible spice to put in beer.
So, are there any such recepies out there? And does a beer brewed with
ginger mean it's a ginger beer? And why does that concoction by Canfield
bear the name "ginger ale"?


                Glad to be relaxed, but sad 'cause I don't have a hombrew yet,

I can't give a comparison since I only use an immersion chiller, but I have
been very pleased with it.  I can cool ~6 1/2 gallons from just under boiling
to pitching temperature (75-80 degrees) in about 15 minutes.  My only complaint
is that to cool it this fast requires nearly constant stirring to keep the wort
moving past the copper coils.  This is where a counter-flow mechanism wins
out (IMHO).
 
>Lauter systems: double bucket vs. false bottom bucket w/grain bag
>vs. insulated picnic cooler. Which work best? 


Again, I can't compare since I have only used the double bucket system.  I've
been quite happy with it except that when I brew a relatively high alcohol type
beer, I have some trouble fitting all of the grain in the top bucket (you can
only fill it to the level of the top of the lower bucket or the wort leaks
out).  I generally brew about seven gallons so the amount of grain required
pushes the limit of 4 1/2 gallon lauter buckets.


> How about techniques for insulating the bucket systems?


Ah, I just hit on a good technique for this.  I use glass carboys for
fermenting, they are used acid carboys and each came in a styrofoam holder.  I
was pleasantly surprised to find that they hold my lauter buckets perfectly! I
just cut a small hole in the side and feed the drain tube through the hole.
There is about 1/4 inch of space between the styrofoam and the lower lauter
bucket and it holds the temperature very well during sparging.
