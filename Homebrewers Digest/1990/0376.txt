Subject: BEER IN WATER COOLER






  Does anyone have any experience with transfering beer to a water 
  cooler?


  The thought was instead of bottling, transfer to another carboy, along 
  with 3/4 cup corn sugar.  Waiting for the right carbonation level and 
  then  directly onto the water cooler. Maybe great for parties.

No.  I recall seeing the .signature and I'm sure that wasn't it.  Must have
been "FATTEST"...

Subject: anchient Syrian beer, Hops, Snow...






I saw a glimpse of the Sacramento BEE newspaper about a week ago. They said
that a San Fransisco based brewery (I think ANCHOR) was able to decipher
hieroglyphics from an anchient Syrian writing which had a beer recipe!
I think United Press did the story. Did anyone else see this?
Apparently it was a pretty good beer, but had to be used quickly, as there 
were no hops in it as a preservative. Apparently the Syrians hadn't found
out about hops at that point in time. I've been trying to find the article
again, but hav'nt been successful.


The short time for which this beer is drinkable brings up a interesting
comment. It is my understanding that hops originated as a preservative.
Today it is used for flavoring more than anything else. But, can any
brewery really say they use NO preservatives. It seems that by todays
standards, that MAY be possible. But, technically, this is a false claim?


By the way, Cher, Snow balls??? :-) That was a great one!!! A few people
around here were rolling on the floor when I told them that!


There is one thing about snow that is great! I skiid Tahoe yesterday. It was
fantastic. But what was really great was coming home and relaxing with a 
Big mug of homebrewed Stout. Life does'nt get much better!

Subject:  Vagabond Ginger Ale


Hi All,
        In response to a recent posting inquiring about making gingered
beers: I recently concocted a batch of Gingered Lager, loosely following
Papazian's Vagabond Ginger Ale recipe, which came out rather delightful.
In the recipe it is suggested to use 2-4 oz. of fresh grated ginger root
and I overzealously went to the upper limits. I felt that the ginger was
overpowering unless the beer was served very cold and when I make this for
the next holiday season I'll cut the amount of ginger in half.


                                        Happy Fermentations,


                                                S. Koza

The Hail to Ale results were mailed out last week.

     Now, I have several large and heavy dictionaries, some with
very small type indeed, and the best I can find on "cyser" is that
it's an old-fashioned way to say "cider", and as for "melomel", it
doesn't exist at all. What's the scoop on these new meanings?

Subject: Brewpubs in Houston and New Orleans?


Hi -


My first post to this NL, so it will also serve as a test.  Testing...1,2,3...


I am taking trips to Houston, TX and New Orleans, LA within the next month or
so.  I have looked at the directory of brewpubs, but see none listed for those
areas.  Does anyone know of any hiding out there?


I am about to invest in a setup, and will be posting my ideas here for comment
in the near future.  This is a GREAT source of info (even if there have been no
mailings for the past four or five days...where are you?).


Thanks...Gary
