Subject: RE: Liberty Ale was not the first


Hear! Hear! Glad to see somebody setting the record straight and standing up
for Ballantine's India Pale Ale.  I first discovered Ballantine's IPA in 1976
in Boston during the Bicentennial Celebration summer.  Now as to which tastes
best, Ballantine's IPA or Liberty Ale ... 8^)  I love them both.  They are
both excellent ales, with somewhat different characters.  If I had to choose,
I think I would use Fred Eckhardt's tactic -- when asked what his favorite
beer was, he replied "The one in my hand, of course."

I'd like to know more about the sumerian beer that Anchor brewed using
the decoded hieroglyphics.  Would somebody who has a copy of the
Sacramento BEE article mind sending me a copy if I provide a SASE???
Thanks,

Subject: source of wheat extract




In Homebrew Digest #377, Andy Ross asked for names and addresses of
anybody selling wheat extract.  
There is an outfit in North Carolina called "American Brewmaster" that
sells wheat extract in 3.3# plastic bags.  You get a discount if you
order more than 12-15# at a time (of either the wheat, or malt extracts).
You can contact American Brewmaster at 2940-6 Trawick Rd., Raleigh, NC
27604.  Or call them at (919)850-0095.

Subject: Response to Gary Mason




I'll bet Gary Mason's request for comments is going to generate some good
controversy.


My opinion is that he's got an almost perfect plan.  That use of glass and
steel is usually the most trouble-free in the end.  A wort chiller is a
must, too.


I have some doubts about the grain-mill attachment for the KitchenAid.
Cracking grain for mashing is different than for other uses probably.
It may be better to crack it somewhere else or buy it cracked.


My advice is to forget partial mashing.  Just brew a couple extract batches
to get the bugs worked out of the process.  During this phase build a
mashing and lautering rig and start using that as soon as it's done.  It's
most likely that he will have to mash to get the fermentable/unfermentable
ratio that he's looking for.

Pete Soper sez (roughly):


"It falls way short of what is needed for proper pitching rates..."


in regard to Wyeast packets.  I agree mostly, after dabbling in this stuff
for a while.  However, the Wyeast Irish yeast really kicks ass.  Using it
with and without starters doesn't seem to make any difference, although 
I need more data than I have already.  In addition, it's REAL smooth!




Also, In a private note to Cher Feinstein, I discovered that she referred
to terminating mead fermentation through the use of vodka.  Interesting
concept.  May I add that I have been successful at terminating the 
fermentation in my ciders by adding sugar until the yeast kicks the
bucket.  By the time the yeast is dead (Red Star and other dry champagne
yeasts) however, the brew is so potent that you have to take your guests
keys before letting them indulge.  


I saw my first hops buds poking up through the soil this week.  Anyone else?

I've found the info tidbits regarding Anchor's experiment with the
Sumerian type beer interesting, but everyone has omitted the
truly crucial detail: where can I find a bottle of the stuff to sample?
I've not seen any.


I live in Menlo Park, CA so a Bay Area reference or two would be welcome
(besides Anchor themselves).

In regards to a query of March 14. Ireks Arkady makes a wheat extract
 available in 6.6 lb cans. While it may be available from many sources
the only one I know personally who carries it is Hennessy Homebrew
in REnsselaer NY (call 1-800-555-1212 to get his 800 #). I made a
weizenbock with one can of this and one can of IREKS-ARKADY amber.
it is very strong and took quite some time to mellow but is now
great. Of course it doesn't do great in caompetitions. No matter
what category (bock, strong beers, wheat beers) it keeps getting
the same comment, nice beer wrong for category, sigh!!


Since I brew some really screwball recipes from time to time i've
given up entering competitions. On the subject of competitions
is anyone really surprised that the AHA still hadn't sent out
club competition results yet?? 


To the person who is still waiting for his winter Zymurgy issue,
I say go buy it at your homebrewer supply shop he's probably had it
for 2 months now.


 The Wort Processors are holding an unofficial competition for most
flatulent beer judge. Nominations accepted here, as are volunteers
to judge. So far Chuck Cox and Steve Black have been nominated.
I alas am ineligible since I'm organizing this (though I only plan
to be present for the actual competition if I can learn to use a 
scuba rig in time!!)

Subject: Another archive server


There's a second homebrew archive server now running here at Wang.  If
you want to get back-issues from it, send a message like:


    send homebrew 234 235 236 ...


to the address:


    archive-server`at`wang.com    -or-    ...!uunet!wang!archive-server


If you don't trust other people's mailers, put a:


    path your`at`address.here    -or-    path from!mapped!site!to!you


line in the message also.  A message with just the contents "help" will
get you a help file that talks about other commands.  If the archive
server isn't doing what you want, drop a line to  archive-manager`at`wang.com
and I'll see what's going on.


I've set this up to be as helpful as possible to UUCP sites who (like us)
have to pay $$$$ for each byte of mail received, and who live in a
net full of nasty mail-eating demons.  As a result, I've optimized it for
getting a single digest, and for doing smart UUCP path routing.  If you
want a whole month's worth of back issues at once, or you're on the
Internet already, aem's archive will probably be much more convenient.


Many thanks to aem`at`mthvax who babysat all the transfers I needed to stock
the archives here.

Subject: Re AHA club contest


> Has anyone heard the outcome of the AHA "Hail to Ale"  club contest.


Yes, but I cannot remember who took first, second, and third places.
I mostly just noticed that it wasn't I :-(.  I do remember that they had
entries from 47 clubs, a new record.


You can call them up to find out who won.  If you had been one of the
winners, I think you would have heard from them by now.


> Is the AHA just slow?


"Unprofessional" is the word I would use.  I just got my judging sheets
back from the AHA on Friday, March 9.  All they had to do was address
an envelope and stick the judging sheets into it.  If the $5 contest
entry fee wasn't enough to cover doing that in a timely manner, then
they should have charged more.


The people at AHA headquarters seem very nice, but their level of
service during this contest was, in my opinion, pathetic.

Subject: Wort Chillers


In HBD #374, Russell Greenlee <russell`at`uswat.uswest.com> asks:
> Do immersion chillers work as fast as counterflow chillers?


Well, yes and no. I've used both types, and each takes about the same
amount of time to chill the entire volume of wort down to pitching
temperature (15 to 30 minutes, depending on the temperature of your cold
tap water).


But:  With a counterflow chiller, each individual little morsel of wort
gets chilled much more rapidly; namely, in the amount of time it takes
that morsel to flow from one end of the chiller to the other (10 seconds).
>From the point of view of the wort, it is being chilled much more
rapidly.  It is this rapid chilling that is supposed to give rise to a
better cold break.


I won't go into the issue of sanitation here, except to say that I think
it is manageable for both types of chillers.
