[ Yesterday, I tried responding to <L_LEE1%UNHH.BITNET`at`MITVMA.MIT.EDU>'s
  question about stout recipes. My message and table seem to have gotten
  trashed, either by my mailer (oh, no, not *that* again!) or the digester
  somewhere. Here goes again, with all dashes replaced by equals-signs... ]

I did a little chart of recipes when I first started brewing; helped me to
generalize what constituted a stout. The `Mega' turned out very well --
dark, roasty, heavy. Be warned, however: my primary blew its lid three
times and really made a mess out of the room. Use a super-large blow off
hose, or (twinge!) just leave the hole in the fermenter uncovered; using
liquid culture might prevent such an intense fermentation.

Subject: Wheat extract




I am an extract brewer interested in making a wheat beer for my
next batch, so all of the info on wheat extracts has been very
helpful.  My question for those of you who have used wheat extracts
is whether or not I will need to use a source of additional enzymes
(such as Edme DMS) with this stuff, or if the extract contains the
necessary enzymes.  I understand from Papazian's book that wheat
doesn't naturally have the enzymes to convert the starches and needs
to be mashed with malted barley (or some other enzyme source) when
doing all-grain.  Are these extracts 100% malted wheat, or a combination
of wheat and barley?


Please indicate which brand of wheat extract you used.


Thanks,


Brian

Subject: More on Sumerian Beer


An AP article about the Ninkasi beer brewed by Anchor appeared in our local
newspaper, too.  Since we are near Philadelphia, not San Francisco, the
paper did not feature Fritz Maytag's involvement, but the other half of the
team:  Professor Solomon Katz of the University of Pennsylvania.  Katz is
"an anthropologist specializing in nutrition."  The paper reported that
"The beer was the culmination of two years of research by Katz and Fritz
Maytag ..."  The recipe was based on "The Hymn to the Goddess of Ninkasi"
dating from about 1800 B.C.  Katz wrote some articles in 1987 about his
theory that that beer was the cornerstone of civilization.  Maytag read the
articles, decided to "try to make some of the beer to see what we could
learn," and "contacted Katz who agreed to help.  It sparked a two-year
research project, with Katz poring over tablets from around the world to
determine some of the finer points of the recipe."


An interesting quote from Maytag:
    "Real brewing is very simple, and we know that the brewers 5,000 years
    ago were extermely skilled.  We ought to assume that these guys were
    just as good at brewing as we are.


Is someone reading this at UofP?  Could Katz be convinced to share some
more information with this list?

This question is directed at anyone who has used COOPER'S AUSTRALIAN ALE.  This
is the second time I have used the mixture and both times I have gotten a
cidery smell.  The fermentation temperature was low and I used corn sugar so I
'm not real sure where the esters came from.  Any help would be appreciated.

I just spoke to Anchor, and they have no more Sumerian beer to sell.


In addition, it was never distributed.  It was just one batch which they
brewed for the Conference, and then sold out of the brewery until it was
gone.

Subject: In defense of KitchenAid grain mills




Yes, the KitchenAid grain mill works just fine for crushing grains.
It is easily adjustable, from grinding fine enough to make a powder
to coarse enough to let whole grains pass through unscathed.  I've
been using it for several years for my grains, without a problem.
And since you can dump a cup or two of grain into the hopper at a time, 
you can monitor the grind and adjust it as needed while still grinding
away.  For instance, I usually have to grind a little finer for black 
patent than pale malt, since the grains tend to be a bit smaller.


No complaints from me.  Like most everything KitchenAid makes, it's
rugged as hell.  (Their plastic attachments tend to be a bit wimpier
and sometimes crack after many long years of use.)

Yes, as a matter of fact, when I was at the brewery, we discussed
the evolution of Liberty Ale.


One of their earlier Special Ales ('81-'83 as I recall) was modeled
after Ballantine IPA.  The Bally IPA of that time was a lot 'bigger'
than the current Bally IPA (more alcohol, hops, malt, & body), and 
tasted more like the current Liberty Ale, than the current Bally IPA.  
This version of Anchor's Special Ale was so popular that they 
decided to brew it year-round, and named it Liberty Ale.


Even before this discussion, the Boston Beer Society thought there
were many similarities between the old Bally IPA and the Anchor IPAs.
We verified this when we slipped an old ('81 as I recall) Bally IPA
into a blind tasting of the '81-'86 Special Ales.  The Bally IPA
ranked equally with the IPA Special Ales.

 One of the best that my brewing buddies and I've tried is "Baer's
 Stout", based on one of the excellent recipes from Dave Baer (a
 regular reader and contributor to this column as well as an instructor
 in brewing at the Menlo Park Rec center).  The one that I am sipping
 right now (a bit early, but I wanted to be accurate in my response)
 came out great!  (Apologies, Dave, for what we may have done to your
 original.)

Hi, All!


My thanks to those who wrote me following my last posting; glad you all 
enjoyed it!


That posting, and the other info regarding "Ninkasi", prompted a number of 
people to address further questions to me, including a request for a list of 
my sources.  Posting directly to this forum is the easiest way for me to 
oblige.


As I believe I mentioned previously, ancient brewing was often related to 
bread-baking, this being a source of both yeasts and malted grains.  This 
trend/link continued throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.


Brewing yeasts began to be cultured and refined around 1500 BC.  How?  Simple: 
think of the recently-cited "Ninkasi" recipes, of bread, water, and dates/date 
sugars thrown together.  Now, think of that taking place in an unglazed 
ceramic vessel, and you have your answer.  The yeasts inhabited the unglazed 
interior of the fermenting vessels, starting batch after batch of ale (a' la 
sourdough bread), with it being a simple matter to inoculate a fresh vessel at 
the same time as a fresh batch of ale.


Addition of herbs and spices to brews is as old as brewing, and there are 
other herbs, such as rosemary and betony, which were known to contribute 
preservative effects.  Hops was known as a strong medicinal, and was begun 
being added to brews in Northern Europe in about the 8th century.


Malting as we think of it came along in the Middle Ages, hand-in-hand with the 
monasteries.  It is during this period that many of the great brew styles
(especially, of course, the "abbey styles"!) were developed.


Why we have a tendency to assume these brews were developed much later is, 
again, quite simple.  By the end of the 17th century, many of the larger 
commercial breweries still in existance were being established.  By the mid-
late-18th century, wines were becoming decent to drink, and affordable.  And, 
during this same period, the monasteric breweries were establishing brewpubs 
of their own-- why miss out on all that profit?  :-)


The end result:  the change in commercial availability of brews came about at 
the same time as that for wines, and most people tend to lump them together in 
their thinking and assume that the brews developed at the same time the wines 
did.  Not so, much to my own surprise no less than anyone else's!


Below is a list of some of my sources.  Titles preceded by an asterisk (*) are 
out of print and/or difficult to obtain.  People may continue to feel free to
