Subject: Ninkasi Beer From Anchor


In the latest issue of Zymurgy there is an article on the Ninkasi beer.  The
article was written by Michael Jackson.  The article was very interesting,
if somewhat short (a couple of pages, if I remember correctly).


Jackson states that this was brewed specifically for the conference.  I
believe that Ninkasi will likely not be brewed again.


If anyone would like more information, let me know.

P.S.
        I recieved my copy of Zymurgy last week...tuesday or wednesday.
        Also, the article originally appeared in another magazine, the name
        of which currently escapes me.  I'll look it up if anyone is
        interested.

If you are doing extract brewing, then the mashing step has already been done
for you by the producer of the extract.  To a large degree you only need to
be concerned with the enzyme content if you are mashing your own grains which 
doesn't seem to be the case here.


As for the extracts being 100% wheat or a combination of wheat or Barley
depends on the brand.  I believe that you can buy both varieties.

Subject: Award-Winning Stouts




Every month, the local homebrew pub, in conjuction with the
local AHA chapter (the hogtown brewers) sponsor a beer
competition.  This month the category was stout, for St.
Patty's day, of course.


We had the largest number of entries by about a factor of two
from any previous contest -- 20!  Seems the pub is really sparking
the homebrew interest round these parts!


Anyway, in the double-blind judging, I'm very happy and excited
to report that I won first prize for my chocolate coffee stout,
*and* second prize for the regionally famous black-berry stout!


I still can't believe it!  (Neither could the judges -- this is
the first time I've ever entered a contest.)  Of course, I must 
credit this list, you've all helped me become a better brewer!
Thanks!

Subject: Automation and Brewing -- Rodney Morris' RIMS system


About a year ago, Zymurgy had a 2-page article on Rodney Morris' RIMS
(Recirculating Infusion Mash System). It combines electronically controlled
heating with pump-recirculation to give a hassle-free (no monitoring
temperature, no stirring) mash which produces clear runoff immediately. 


I wrote him and he kindly sent back a brief construction how-to and some
comments on its use and other devices he's constructed (boil-over
detectors, Electrim Bim style brew pot for under $25, etc). 


The project seems a bit high-tech for the average Zymurgy reader
(schematics, soldering, some stainless steel work), but I figured
net-workers might consider it simply another hack. Has anyone else tried to
build the RIMS setup, or anything similar?


[I can send/fax info and address I have, if anyone's interested.]

    Last week I began brewing an Austrailian light beer, for which I
  bought the whitbread liquid yeast culture (1098 I think). I smashed
  the yeast packet on Thursday, Firday it swelled up like a ballon. On
  Friday I mixed up a pint of boiled primer (dired malt no hops), added 
  the yeast. On Saturday the primer was happily bubbling away, so I 
  brewed my beer. Coopers Ausie extract, crystal malt, 2lbs plain dried
  malt, 2oz clusters hops. I used my newly fabricated imersion style wort
  chiller to bring the wort down to about 70F before adding the yeast
  culture (allready at room temp).
    By Monday the yeast had not taken hold, it had died, or gone on a
  walk-about someweres else, but not in my beer. So I added the dired
  yeast that came with my Coopers extract, "Suitable for top or bottom
  fermenting beers". My questions are:


      1)  What happened to my liquid yeast (all $4.00 worth)?
      2)  What kind of yeast is this Coopers yeast anyway, I though the
          yeast itself determines whether its top or bottom fermenting, not
          the beer.


    I also broke my capper when I was building my imersion chiller, but
  thats another story.

<Last fall someone posted the phone number of the BREWNET BBS.


Well, it's not the one you asked for but the Worts of Wisdom has a BBS in
Mountain View, CA that runs 24 hours a day at 300/1200/2400 baud. It
maintains all of the HBDigest todate on-line, as well as, local brewing 
news and info.


The number is (415) 964-4356.

That BBS has been down for some time, awaiting new hardware and
software.  However, for those local to the DC area (or willing to
pay LD charges), I carry the same files and beer brewing conferences
(and more) as Tim Weil did for Brewnet.  I will also post the info
there as to when he gets back up.

Subject: Texas brown ale?




I'm considering sending in my first entry to the annual AHA Homebrew 
Competition.  My dilemma is in which category to enter my ale.  I'm 
familiar with different beer styles, but my palate is not yet refined
enough to take a sip and say, "Ah, yes, that's a [style]."  With a
home-made recipe, I don't know where to put my ale.  (Besides down the
hatch!)


In the current AHA rules, there's an apparently new category:  Texas
brown ale.  The description reads:  "A style of brown ale emerging
from the flavor preferences of many American homebrewers.  It has
a medium to high hopping rate, evidenced in bitterness, flavor and
aroma.  As bitterness increases the proportion of malt sweetness
also increases for balance.  Usually 3 to 5 percent alcohol by
volume."  This seems to me to be the generic homebrew that isn't
a stout or a porter or a pale ale.  My brew is definitely darker
and maltier and hoppier than, say, Newcastle Brown Ale or Samuel
Smith's Nut Brown Ale.  But it doesn't fit any other classification.
Is it a Texas brown ale?  (I know, I know.  Words don't convey much.
Here...have a sip.)


Could some kind beer judge please elucidate on Texas brown?  Is 
there anything commercially available that comes close to a tasting
reference?  Or any of the recipes in TCJOHB?


Thanks!


Doug 


PS  If Chuck Cox responds first, then we _know_ he's America's
    FASTEST beer judge!
