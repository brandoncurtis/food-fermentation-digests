Sunday, March 18th, Wine and Brew By You had one of their more or less
quaterly Pub Hops. Approximately 80 homebrewers went on a double decker
bus to three pubs: Duffy's Tavern, a local Irish pub; Churchill's
Hideaway, a very old local pub which hiighlights punk and folk bands
on Fridays and Saturdays; and Tobacco Road. *the* oldest pub in Miami,
with Liquor license #1. It's known for blues, jazz and folk nights. We
started out at around 1 p.m. on Sunday, and spent roughly two hours at
each of the places before coming back to Wine and Brew By You. Each of
the places had tables of food laid out for the pub-hoppers. This is one
of the typical events that Wine and Brew does for their customers. The last
pub hop we also went to three places: Tobacco Road; Churchill's Hideaway;
and the Billabong in Hallandale (somewhat north of Miami), which is
known for their collection of imported beers, typically 100 or more.

Does anybody out there have an extended index to ZYMURGY?  I know
that a few years back they published a rather comprehensive index;
it ran for 7 or 8 pages, i think.  Any information would be both
helpful and appreciated.

Some of us homebrewers local to the Cleveland, OH area are interested in 
forming a local club.  We are currently looking at arranging a first meeting
in late April or early May.  Would any of you homebrewers out there in the 
Cleveland area who would be interested in such an undertaking contact me
by Email at the address above or phone below.  Please don't reply to the digest.

Hi, All!


In response to recent queries regarding how to obtain such of my sources as 
Sir Kenelme Digby, I contacted Dr. David Friedman, the gentleman in the SCA
who sells xerox copies (legally arranged-for and cleared) of the facsimile
editions.  In many instances, Digby included, Dr. Friedman is the only
available souce I know of.  The information he sent me to be posted to this 
forum appears *after* my signature lines.


Dr. Friedman's Miscellany is very much SCA-oriented, but may be of interest to 
some.  His 2-volume collection is what contains the copies of the facsimile
cookbooks, volume I being the one which contains Digby. 


In all honesty and fairness, I think I should add that if you purchase the 
cookbook collection, plan on buying a magnifying glass.  In the interests of 
cost-efficiency, Dr. Friedman has used reduction xeroxing to get 4 pages of a 
facisimile on one page of the collection.  A magnifying glass makes reading 
the collection much easier on the eyes, and isn't that much hassle.


If anyone has any further questions, they may feel free to contact me.




                         Yours in Carbonation,


                                      Cher

Gentles:


I have received a number of letters asking about the price and
availability of our Miscellany. The price is $7 plus postage. You can
either send a stamped, self-addressed envelope or an extra dollar per
copy for postage (special 4th class--printed material). If you send
an envelope, it should be at least 9x12 and have postage for 15
ounces.


For those of you who have not seen the Miscellany, the current (4th)
edition is 165 pages long, printed on 8 1/2 by 11 paper, and spiral
bound (not literally a spiral--the kind of plastic binding that
allows the book to open flat). The first section contains our current
collection of worked-out period recipes, giving both the original and
information on how we interpret it. The middle section contains
essays on a variety of topics. The final section is my SCA poetry,
plus a little prose.


We also have available a two volume collection of source material for
period cooking. Volume I contains about 1200 pages of material,
reduction xeroxed 4 pages to 1, making it about 150 sheets of paper,
each printed on both sides. It sells for $15 plus $2 postage and
handling (just $15 if you provide the envelope and postage for almost
two pounds). Volume II (2nd edn) contains about 240 pages of
material, reduced to 2 pages on 1 (about 60 sheets of paper, each
printed on both sides). It sells for $7 plus $1 postage and handling
($7 if you provide the stamped envelope). Both volumes are three hole
punched but not bound. Volume I contains copies of existing period or
almost-period (Kenelm Digby and Hugh Platt) cookbooks. Volume II
contains new translations of period cookbooks, done at my instigation
by people in the Society, plus  a few related odds and ends. These
are not worked-out recipes but originals--they typically have no
temperatures, times, or quantities.


The current edition of Volume II (the one I was selling at Pennsic)
is the third edition, which sells for $9 and is substantially longer,
but I am sold out. I have not decided whether to print more or wait
until some more translations come in and do a fourth edition.


If you order five or more Miscellanies, we will pay postage. If you
order ten or more, the price drops to $6 and we pay postage.


        Sincerely Yours

To add to the IPA list (currently Ballantine and Liberty),
I used to enjoy Labatt's IPA, it would have been around
1970-1974 that it was available in the US, at least in 
Upstate New York. I don't know if it is still made, 
but I haven't seen it in a long time.


Another beer that I could get in New York in the 70's
was Red Cap, and I don't remember the brewer (was
it Carling?) It was not labeled as an IPA but it
had a similar look and feel. I think I was buying
it when I could no longer get Labatt's IPA. Does
anyone else recall these beers of decades past?


Tom
