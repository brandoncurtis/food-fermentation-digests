No, you can't get in cheaply by plying us with beer, which is
not to say that you shouldn't try.


P.S. Other news - I said earlier that Reinheitsgebot Brewery (the
only microbrewery in the Dallas area) had gone out of business.
It turns out they are still in business, at least for awhile.  They
sold (green) beer at the North Texas Irish Festival.  They are having
a tour of their brewery as part of the conference, and will be
supplying significant amounts of beer to the conference.

Doug sez...

> Here...have a sip.)


Hmmm, nice looking head, but some cloudiness...
oops, just a smudge on my screen.


It sounds like you might have a Texas Brown,
send a bottle and I'll let you know for sure.


> Is there anything commercially available that comes close to a tasting
> reference? 


No, there is no commercial example by definition.
It is, as you noted, a category for all those dark hoppy homebrew ales
that don't fit into any other category.


> PS  If Chuck Cox responds first, then we _know_ he's America's
> FASTEST beer judge!


vroooomm...VROOOOMM...SCREEEEEEE!!!
Hmmm, robust yet fragile, well rounded yet naive.
Good body, well balanced, rocky head.
38 points.
VRRRRRROOOOM....vrrrrrrooommmm.........


 - Chuck Cox - america's fastest beer judge -
