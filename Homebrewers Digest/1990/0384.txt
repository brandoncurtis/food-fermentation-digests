florianb`at`tekred.cna.tek.com spreads this wild rumor:


>I saw my first hops buds poking up through the soil this week.  Anyone else?


I've got two Nugget and two Cascade buds showing today (3/23) after planting
3/12. Go, hops, go!


I gave up on Freshops incidently. I know they are good people, but 5 (#$!#!)
phone calls without being able to place an order was too much for me. I ordered
Cascade, Willamette and Tettnanger from Nichols. The rhizomes arrived a few
days later, packed very well. I'd like to believe my experience with Freshops
was just weird bad luck and hesitate to say anything beyond this.

  I spent some time at a local supermarket today going over the beers for sale 
there and made some notes about their date codes that I thought you might 
find interesting.
  As a preface, I found an old "Zymurgy" that had an article about Anchor
written by Dick Dunn. Aside from a lot of other interesting stuff Dick explained
Anchor's date code system. You look at the label like a clock face and
the position of the notch cut in the label is the month the beer was made. I
was on the verge of buying some Liberty Ale but, thanks to Dick's information
I said "No thanks" to that idea after examining the labels. 
  Where I list the code as "reg notches" I mean that my decoder patterned after
Chuck (fastest something or other) Cox's and Dave Suurballe's information was 
used. Here are my notes:


  Beer                        dates                code                notes


  Anchor Liberty Ale        1/89,8/89,9/89        clock notch        The layer of dust told
                        10/89                                me the Jan bottles were
                                                        most likely last year's
  Anchor Porter                5/89                clock notch
  Anchor Steam                6/89,10/89        clock notch
  Bass ale                                red line        A red line on the back
                                                        label seems to indicate
                                                        the date. We need to
                                                        figure out this one.
  Carlsberg Lager                                        notches but nonsense
  Courage Amber Lager        5/10/89,4/20/89        reg notches
  Guinness Stout        10/2/89                reg notches
  Harp Lager                2/13/90                reg notches
  Kronenberg Lager                                        notches but nonsense
  Mackeson Triple Stout        11/24/88        reg notches        Now this is *old*
  Pironi                7/27/89                wide notches        like regular notches but
                                                        spacing a bit wide
  Sapporo                                3 lines                3 lines on back label in
                                                        various positions
  Sierra Nev. Pale Ale        9/13/89,9/23/89        reg notches
  Sam Adams                6/89                notch on month
  St. Pauli Girl                                        notches but nonsense
  Swiss Lowenbrau                                        notches but nonsense
  Whitbread Ale                11/21/89        reg notches


  I've been tracking some of the British beers for several months now. I'm
convinced that this part of the world only gets these beers once or twice a
year. Sierra Nevada on the other hand is available 2-6 weeks old depending upon
where you look.
