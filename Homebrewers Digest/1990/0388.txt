Subject: Uses for spent grain


Ok, so maybe we have been watching a little too much of the frugal gourmet or 
have really gotten into this recycling thing, but a few weekends ago, we
were brewing a batch of India Pale Ale and we decided 
that it seemed like such a waste to dump all the spent grain into the trash.
So after we strained the grain, I spread it out on some cookie sheets and put   
it in the oven at 200F for several hours to dry it out.  Then, I worked up
a variation on a recipe for dog biscuits from our local animal shelter and
here's the recipe.  Our dog Waylon really likes them, and although I don't
think the grain adds much flavor, it's kindof course and probably adds some
fiber.  I know using spent grain may seem like a strange idea, but is there
anyone else out there who has also thought of uses for it?


WAYLON'S CRYSTAL MALT DOG COOKIES


1.25 c.  Whole Wheat Blend Flour (50% whole wheat/50% unbleached all-purpose)
0.5 c.   Rye Flour
0.25 c.  Corn Meal
0.5 c.   Dried Spent Grain
6 T.     Vegetable Oil
2/3 c.   Water (I bet beef broth would work great)
0.5 t.   Garlic Salt


This makes a moist cookie type dough that can easily be molded by hand into
shapes resembling dog biscuits.  Or you could role the dough out flat and
cut it with a cookie cutter, but it didn't seem worth the effort.  Place
the dog cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet and cook in a preheated 350F
oven for about 40-50 minutes.  This recipe makes about a dozen medium
cookies.  Next time I would probably double or triple the recipe.


Isn't it great that even the hounds can get involved in homebrewing?!!


Drink all you want, we'll brew more!!  : )

p.s.  We figure that making these is really not any cheaper than
buying Milkbone, but hey, homebrewing is not any cheaper than buying
Michelob, but we like it a whole lot better!!

Finally, a discussion that I may be able to contribute.  It turns out that hops
are frequently used in herbal medicine, among other things, to induce sleep.  I
have not read Papazian's comments, but there is some lore about the dreams of
those who sleep upon a pillow stuffed with hops.  As you have witnessed, its
effect it reputed to be fairly powerful.

I am looking for a way to do a homebrewed version of Mackeson's Triple Stout.
It doesn't have to be EXACTLY right, but I want to brew something that tastes
pretty similar.  I'm fairly new to homebrewing (about 50 gallons so far), and
I haven't done any mashing yet, so something that utilizes malt extracts would
be nice.  Thanks.

I live in the seattle area and would like to grow hops, could 
someone tell me where I might find rhizomes locally (homebrew shops?)
or send me address and phone # of freshops or nichols. Please help as I need to plant soon.

Hi,


  Does anybody know if there has been any comprehensive information
on hops published (e.g., Alpha content, flavor characteristics,
bouquet, etc...).  If so, where?


                   Thanks in advance,
                          Dan
