Subject: Re: hops info


_Beer Kits and Brewing_ by Dave Line contains a list comparing a couple dozen
varieties of hops giving % acid and a single-line description of the flavor
qualities and best uses.  The author is English, but the book contains 
information about American and European varieties as well.

Subject: Lots O Barley Wine


In regards to the assertion that Old Peculier is the closest thing to
Barley Wine available in America. Where do you live?? This is certainly
not true to those of us in moderate size cities or larger.
1) Old Nick's (brewed by Youngs?? I believe) is a classic example of
   a barley wine and is widely available.
2) Bigfoot by Sierra Nevada is also a "Barley Wine Style Ale" and is
   available in larger markets.


Old Peculier is a fine product (one of my fav's). Other good old/strong
Ales are George Gale &co. product right off the top of my head. I'll
need to go home and do some more research but I know there are 2 or 3
others in this class. I also seem to remember one or two more 
commercial barley wine examples. Pick up a copy of Michael Jackson's
pocket guide to beer, perhaps he has an index entry on Barley Wines.


I'm sure chuck cox (if he's truly fastest) will chime in here...

Subject:  yeast and addresses




I'm interested in the importance of yeast in brewing. Where can I find out
about how different yeasts affect flavor, aroma, etc.? Someone also mentioned
some yeast retailers, I'd like to get their addresses. (Is there a list of
HB addresses somewhere (hops dealers, AHA, etc. )? )


I'm also wondering about cultivating yeast from the dregs of a bottle. How
difficult is it? I've heard that it won't work for a Guiness unless the
bottle is from Ireland. Anyone know about this stuff (probably a stupid
question.....)?
                               Thanks.................Russ G.

Subject: Uses for spent grain; hops




A. Bush also has a use for spent grain.  They are the largest supplier in
the country (world?) of cattle feed, according to some ancient article
in Zymurgy.




Regarding home grown hops, I planted roots in the fall.  The first year
I got 8 ounces of hops.  Shoots usually appear near May 1st.  I live
about 150 miles north of New York City.


There was interesting feature on 60 minutes a few years ago on
agricultural controls.  It seems that, as with tobacco and navel
oranges, you need a license to grow hops for sale.  When originally
issued, they were a very nominal fee.  Now you have to buy an existing
license from someone else.  The last one sold (before the article was
broadcast) went for 2 million dollars!  That tells you something about 
what trade restrictions are worth to someone who is "in the club" when 
the fence goes up.

Subject: hydrogen sulphide odor




I just finished making my tenth batch of beer and, for the first time, I detect
a strong rotten egg (hydrogen sulphide?) odor coming through the airlock on my
primary.  Papazian suggests that this phenomenon is a characteristic of some
strains of yeast and that, if it occurs, you should "change your yeast".  I'm
using Wyeast "American Ale" yeast for the first time... has anyone had similar
experiences with this yeast?


What will the impact be on the finished product?  The idea of belching out
great mouthfuls of hydrogen sulphide seems anti-social in the extreme!


A few extra details...


        1.  There are two pounds of honey in the wort (also a first)
        2.  I made 16oz of yeast starter instead of just using the amount
            provided by Wyeast


Bottom line: is this batch a loss?




                Thanks,

Subject: Wort cooler


I made a wort cooler this weekend using 25 feet of 3/8" flexible copper tubing
and a faucet to 3/8" adaptor meant to connect to snap-on tubing.  Total cost 
was about $15.  


I uncoiled the tubing a little and bent and extended both ends up to where the
sink was.  Then I took apart the adaptor and put the end of the tube in the
hole.  Then I flared the end of the tube slightly by reaming it with a pair of
long-nosed pliers that when closed had just the right conical shape.  When the
adaptor was reassembled, it could be screwed on to the fauces and then the
tubing pulled slightly to make a seal.  There was some leakage, but not enough
to matter.  


It worked marvelously.

Subject: Filtering hop pellets




I am a happy new homebrewer.  Of course that means I have questions.
The beers I have made to date call for hop pellets.  I was wondering if
I need to try to filter the wort after boiling to try to remove what I
can of the hop pellets.  I have filtered the wort through cheesecloth as
I put it into the fermenter.  It stops alot of stuff, but much gets
through. I guess that approximately 50% of the hop pellets get through
into the fermenter.  Again, should I even be trying to remove the hop
pellets?  And if so, am I removing enough?


Thank you for your support (in advance).

Subject: Jump-start that yeast!


I think I've finally come up with the right combination of factors to
get the yeast off to a fast start. I pitched a batch last night and
four hours later I had a good active fermentation going. I believe
that the combination of aerating the wort well, rehydrating the yeast
(Muntona) in 100F water, letting the temperatures of the wort & yeast
equilibrate before pitching, mixing the yeast into the wort well, and
maintaining the wort temperature at about 70F all contributed to the
happy start-up. It used to be that I had to wait 12 hours or so to see
fermentation start.


This was a fairly simple recipe: 8# American 6-row and 1.5# 90L
crystal with 12 AAU of Nugget & Cluster hops.


Question for the group: is a four-hour start-up time average, good,
unheard of, or what...

Thomas Hardy Ale is available in this country and it is a true barley wine.
I swear that Old Peculier here is thin compared to Old Peculier on tap in
England. Maybe its me (see below), but while I would agree that what is sold 
on tap in England resembles an old ale (as peculier as that sounds), what is 
sold here in bottles doesn't.  Gales on the other hand seems to me to be the 
genuine article and is also sold in the States.

  They sell Vienna Malt at $5.35 for 5 pounds. I expect you could 
negotiate a better price for a larger quantity. Shipping to North
Dakkkkkoooooda is probably extra.
  This raises a question I've had for a long time. How is it that Miller's
Vienna lager recipe with its homemade Vienna malt recipe doesn't end up short
on enzymes? His specs for making Vienna malt call for kilning at over 200
degrees and his Marzenbier (Vienna) lager recipe calls for only this homemade
malt. What am I missing?

 I'd think they would go with the yeast strains that sell. Most folks in this 
country think Chimay is a dance and Bios is something in an IBM PC.

  Hell, what is the magic of these guys stocking what sells? Wyeast is very
very perishable. A shop can't hold packets of Slobovian Gert Banger for
months on end without eating the cost.  This is not definite, but this is 
all I can scrape up:


1007 German ale 
1028 English ale #2 
1056 American ale 
1084 Irish ale
1098 English ale 
1338 German Alt
2007 American lager - St. Louis
2035 American lager - New Ulm 
2042 Danish lager
2142 Bohemian lager
2206 Bavarian lager
2308 Munich lager
3056 Wheat Beer


 Can anybody estimate the relative fermentability of mashed flaked barley?
I'm after a range of original/final gravity ratios.
