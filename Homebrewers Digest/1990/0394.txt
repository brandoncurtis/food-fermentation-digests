Subject:Toronto Area shops?&hops plants?
Hi,
        I was wondering if anybody knew of a good Toronto area homebrew 
shop?
        Secondly does anybody know if Hops are viable this far North?
        And Finally is the AHA available to Canadian residents?
                Thanks

Like Cher, I don't see why not. The grains would be great for soil
texture, and have some fertilizing effect. Composting first would be
good, but if it isn't convenient don't worry about it. Soil makes an
excellent compost medium for something as small as grains.


At my house the garden doesn't get the benefit of spent grains; my
chickens love to eat the stuff!

Yes, objectivity and reality were the first casualties of our
country's glorious "War on Drugs."  The *abuse* of drugs, whether legal
or illegal, obviously costs our society dearly, but the hysterical
restriction of responsbile drug *use* is clearly not a realistic
solution.

  The same thing happened to us at our "big" contest in this area (NC) last 
year.  One theory was that the judges were so tired of tasting beer that the 
novelty of the mead caught their fancy. Just kidding. Still, it was 
disappointing to many of us to have a mead win best of show. The mead makers 
just smiled.  (I put "big" in quotes to distinguish this from the use of the 
word in Texas.) Thanks, John, for a fascinating report about your conference. 
Take good care of that hand.

  Remember that isomerization (the process whereby the hop bitterness can go
into permanent solution in the wort) is very nonlinear. The difference between
a 60 minute boil and a 90 minute boil is minimal - on the order of 10%.

>from pelletized hops) before fermentation gets going should reduce the
>bitterness from the trub considerably.  However, you should pay careful


  Is the real difference caused by reducing the time that the hops steep in hot 
wort or by prevention of prolonged contact with the cooled wort? Are there 
references to indicate any significant bitterness is contributed by hops in 
cool wort?
  Another factor to consider is the density of the wort in the boil. According
to Terry Foster 5% more bittering hops are needed for each 10 specific gravity
points over 1.050 to compensate for the fact that isomerization rates are lower
with thicker worts. So, for example with a recipe that will have an eventual
original gravity of 1.050 with 5 gallons, if only 2 gallons were boiled, you
would have a boil gravity of 1.125 and expect to get ((1.125-1.050)/.010)*5=
37.5% less bitterness than if you boiled all 5 gallons.
  But you know what the real head banger is? Oxidation of hops in storage. Hops
are harvested pretty much once a year around Fall. No matter what, depending 
upon the time of year, storage conditions and *a varying factor based on the 
type of hop*, a fraction of the potential bitterness of any given packet of 
hops that we use is lost. As homebrewers we don't know what the fraction is
for any given situation, only that it is sometimes very significant. For 
instance, one study showed that a sample of Cascade pellets stored under
refrigeration went from 7.6% to 4.6% alpha acid content in 12 months[1]. In the 
same study a sample of Hersbrucker pellets dropped from 7.4% to 4.7%. I'm
not writing this to make everybody lose their level of relaxation, just to
point out that there are major fudge factors that are not even under our
control, so we shouldn't get too excited if a batch of beer comes out a bit
too bitter or too sweet.

The only time I've seen this happen is when I forgot to give the
hydrometer a good spin to shake off the bubbles that had stuck to it.
I've seen an error of 5 associated with an extra buoyant hydrometer,
especially with a sample that is still fairly active.

Subject: Oxygen in solution necessary for Fermentation?


Recently I was rereading Papazian's section in the Brewing Mead book
and he said that the initial 12-14 hours of fermentation require lots
of oxygen.  He said this was typically ok, since there was lots of
oxygen available in solution in cold tap water.


But if this is the case, then when you boil the wort, wouldn't that drive
the O2 out of the water, and leave the primary fermentation short of
oxygen?  In my case, since I don't have a wort chiller, I usually
boil 2-3 gallons of water and put it in the refridgerator to cool ahead of
time (this usually reduces the wort temperature to where I can add the
yeast).  However, would this not reduce the supply of oxygen as well?


Is there really that much O2 in solution, or is the fermentation stealing
O from the H2O itself?  O.K. so I'm not a chemist.  I'm still puzzled?


Where does the O2 come from for the fermentation, if so much oxygen
is needed?

        Charlie Papazian
        
                                            In Michigan a child came
        home with a worksheet.  Question number three instructed:
        "Circle the following pictures that are drugs." There were
        several pictures including a hypodermic needle, a pile of
        powder, pills, milk and a bottle of beer. He got that question
        wrong because he failed to circle the bottle of beer.


IMHO, the test was incomplete - it did not show a cup of coffee,
cigarettes, wine, tea, cola sodas, and other drugs.  Maybe our
children should be taught to recognise ALL drugs.
                                                               Sen.
        Ted Kennedy recently introduced an amendment to the Drug-Free
        Schools and Communities Act, making reference to alcoholic
        beverages as a "gateway drug."


I wonder how many times the Honorable Senator from the Commonwealth
has himself crossed through that "gateway"?

Subject: SG increasing during secondary


Florian "the puzzled" comments about SOME wierd barley wine where the SG of 
a barley wine seemed to increase during secondary fermentation in a carboy.

I've had this happen to me a few times.  I ocassionally get brews where  
the SG at bottling is higher than that at racking.  This distrubs me, 
but I never thought of a good physical explanation.  I've assumed 
that SG readings are always an approximation; different portions of the 
wort have different densities, and readings can differ significantly from 
measurement to measurement.


I guess that water can evaporate out of a carboy, and increasing the SG
because of reduced volume.  I doubt that Sg can rise from 1.025 to 1.030
because of evaporation.  Wort volume would have to reduce 17 percent in
the secondary to explain this 5 point increase in SG.  We need to find 
another physical mechanism for SGs increasing during fermentation.

Perhaps attempts at marijuana legalization have come back to instead
make alcohol and cigarettes less accepted.  Drug use, and alcohol
is a drug, has been around since before written history. What needs
to be done is to encourage responsible drug use, and drug use in 
moderation. Instead, the pendulum swings against acceptance of any
drug use, excepting of course what the medical community says we must 
have. :-)  Freedom! Stop the new prohibitionists before it's too late!
No innocuous drug should be illegal. Making *any* innocuous drug illegal
makes it inevitable that other innocuous drugs will be made illegal.


Charlie talks about sharing a beer with a friend, this being a part
of the culture. The amount that the beverage industry contributes 
to the American economy, etc. These are beside the point. If drugs
like tobacco, marijuna, peyote, etc are illegal, why should alcohol
be legal? It's hypocritical to arbitrarily make any commonly used
innocuous drug illegal and leave others legal. You can't look at
alcohol use in a vacuum, so to write, but you must look at the way this
culture views drug use in general. End of ramblings.
