Have you tried measuring plain water? Maybe your
hydrometer got dropped on its head, and the paper
inside slipped?

I like all of my brew sweet in the background, and
add 1/2 to 1 lb. of crushed Cara-Pils (sometimes
called Dextrine Malt) to all my 5 gallon batches.
I don't know equivalent amounts to give you the
replacement amounts for saccharin. Anybody else?

Commonwealth has a brew available now in bottles
(at least down here on the Cape). They might have
been adding priming sugar to the batch prior to
bottling.

There are some homebrew recipes which call for various sugars (Papazian's
Goat Scrotum Ale calls for molasses, brown sugar, AND corn sugar even though
he says elsewhere that replacing corn sugar with malt extract gives better
results). 


More relevant is that Commonwealth isn't the only brewer that adds a little
sugar to get good beer. The local (Boston) newsletters recently described a
visit to Fuller's, which said the recipe for ESB included some invert sugar
 -"so you could drink >=4 pints in a session"-. Fuller's ESB has been getting
good reviews in various publications in this country; I thought it was quite
good, much better than their London Porter (or Royal Oak? notes from
beer-tasting at BU last summer are obscure whose this was).


Also, they could have been brewing Golden Ale. The image of -"Gold Ale"- seems
to be something like a better grade of Pilsener than the commercial runoff
made in this country; I doubt you could get something that light with no
sugar.

When I was change-ringing nearby I went to Commonwealth fairly often(*); I
didn't notice any variation in the bitter (or in the stout, which has seduced
some English friends). Note that traditional English beers vary
substantially; regions have not just specialties in style (stout/bitter/mild)
but also particular preferences in each style, so the bitter you had may have
been a median but certainly wasn't the only style variety. Commonwealth's
Burton Bitter is related to Bass Ale and other brews (Double Diamond?) from
Burton-on-Trent (Northeast coast), which are supposed to be very hoppy. It
would be interesting if Commonwealth filled out the English line with a
brown/mild ale, since mild-and-bitter is a common mix.


(*) Ringing followed by beer is a noble English tradition that I was treated
to in both England and Australia---though some of our guests disdained the
Commonwealth bitter and one even asked for white wine!

Subject: Idle Fermentation


I brewed up my second batch of homebrew 4 days ago. It's a porter that had
6 or 7 lbs of extract and 1lb of black patent, with a touch of crystal. 
OG was around 1.065 after the boil was finished, but I was only able to get
the wort down to about 90 degrees Fahrenheit after 30 minutes. Since it
was 2:30 AM, I crashed and pitched at around 8:30 AM. I used an 11.5g packet
of Edme dry yeast, which I chose over Red Star at the local homebrew hut.


The yeast had covered the surface of the wort by midnight and was bubbling
away at the rate of 3 or 4 bbles per second by the next morning. Fermentation
continued in this manner until the second morning (48 hours after pitching),
when the head on the wort had fallen. I haven't seen a single bubble since,
which seems strange because I tossed about 10oz of the wort into a bottle
fitted with an airlock at the same time that I pitched in the primary. The
bottle is bubbling every several seconds.


Although I am relaxed and am not worrying, I am quickly running out of homebrew
and would like to know if this is abnormal fermentation. I'm running a closed
fermentation in a 5 gallon carboy and havent disturbed it since pitching (that
was the point of having the separate bottle fermentingg - so I could monitor
it and not touch the primary).


Any help or comforting words would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: Colors in light-extract brews


Regarding the amount of darkening grains to add to a
light-extract-only wort, I have a couple of points
on the graph:


Starting with 5 lbs light extract and water
to make 4.5 gallons I have then added


(1) 2 cups crystal + 1 cup chocolate malt to get
    a beautiful copper-colored amber ale


(2) 2 cups crystal + 2 cups roasted barley to get
    a very dark-colored but light-bodied stout


I crush the grains by rolling them with a beer bottle,
not so much grinding that they turn to powder. I
steep the grains for 1/2 hour at 150-160 F in 1 gallon,
then strain and rinse.


During the steep, you can draw off a half-cup or so, then
dilute it to the full wort strength by adding a cup or so
of water, to get an idea of the color of the finished
product, and tweak as necessary.

Subject: Fermentation Temperature




The summer months will soon be upon us, with the correspondingly high
temperatures. My current residence does not have any A/C, and is therefore 
subject to the outside temperature, which means that it can reach 90 degrees
in here, maybe even higher. The question is, can I brew beer? 90 is well out
of the suggested fermenting range, but just what will happen? Is it hopeless?
And if it is, are there refridgerator-type things that can keep my carboy at
a nice 65-75?
        Thanks in advance,
                                                Andrius

G'day to all!


I am doing my first two stage fermentation. But, I'm not to sure about
what to do.


I am making a Maple Syrup Stout. I racked it into the carboy after the
krauzen(sp?) fell. It's been in the secondary for a week and a half now, as 
of 4/26.


How long can it sit in the secondary? There is still some activity in there.
There is also a fair amount of sediment buildup. I don't have a meter, so I
don't know what the SG is. 


It looks as though it is doing just fine. I'm just curious as to how long
to let it go. I have heard across the net of people letting thier secondary
go for a month or two. 


Does anyone have any recommendations?


Thanx in advance,


RobertN.
