Subject: Boulder gets a brewery


It would appear that Boulder--which is certainly the center of the universe
for homebrewing--finally has a real brewery.  I've complained far too much
about the Boulder Brewery and their underhopped, overcarbonated, funky-
tasting beers (always overchilled at the brewery, to add injury to insult).
But now we have the Walnut Brewery in downtown Boulder.  I doubt they'll be
selling anything off-premises for a while, if ever, but in the meantime
it looks like it's worth a visit if you're ever here in Homebrew Central.


I braved the opening-day crowds at the new brewery and tried to find a
spot momentarily quiet enough to contemplate a taster's flight of four
beers.  (I didn't go for all six; I didn't have the time or concentration.)
The beers are all well made, generously hopped, in good balance, and clean.


The beers I tasted:
    Buffalo Gold - about MoR in what's become a typical west-coast style
        pale ale, with just the right amount of the obligatory Cascades in
        the finish.
    Big Horn Bitter - serious bitter amber ale.  Nice body, drier than
        the Gold but still an interesting finish.
    Old Elk Brown Ale - light brown, reminiscent of a dark Munich lager
        with ale character laid on top.
    Devil's Thumb Stout - very dry, substantial stout.  May have a bit too
        much dark roast; I'll have to retaste this one but I'm looking
        forward to it.
The beers I didn't taste:  Swiss Trail Wheat Ale and The James Irish Red Ale.
(The names all refer to local stuff.)


Coming out of the gate, six beers is good.  I think they can expand to
eight.


They're off to a good start.  I hope they make it...Boulder has too many
people serious about good beer not to have a good local brewpub.

Subject:  Al & grain husks


Hi,
        Just a few comments: Three Cheers to John for coming to the defense
of aluminum( hip,hip, hooray!) One of my brewing associates has brewed lots
of batches in an aluminum stock pot( about 5 yrs. worth) and I see no evidence
of pitting, which would indicate dissolution of the metal. I have recently
invested in a 6 gal heavy walled Al pot and have not noticed any of the
dreaded off flavors either.
 On the question Gary had about grain husks; the first,and probably foremost,
reason for not getting rid of the husks is there essentiality in your sparging
filtration bed.(wait, is that a word?)


                                Happy Fermentations,


                                Stephan M. Koza

     There is a logical reason for leaving the husks on the malted barley:
Namely, they provide bulk to the mash, which facilitates sparging.  If they
weren't in there, sparging the mash would probably resemble sparging Cream of
(insert the name of your favorite hot cereal here :-).  So, the husks do
serve a purpose, and after all, people have been brewing for thousands of years 
and if there were no need to utilize the husks, they would have been left
behind long ago.

Distribution-File:
        homebrew%hpfcmr`at`hplabs.hp.com


To all:


   John Polstra's comments on aluminum kettles was right on the
money.  To look at this qualitatively, the pH of tomato juice is ca. 4.
Now, lets make spaghetti sauce.  Add all of your spices and boil (simmer)
for a while.  The pH is going to be less than 4 (i.e., more acidic).
According to Papazian, mashing enzymes work best around a pH of 5.4.
Even after boiling for an hour the pH isn't going to change munch.  So already
I have presented a pH difference relative to time of exposure to the "acid"
(pH of 4 vs ca. 5.4 with respect to days of exposure to hours exposure,
respectively).  Even after years of making spaghetti sauce in the same
aluminum pot, one does not see pitting therefore one should not see pitting
after years of boiling wort.  For your beer to have a noticeably matallic
flavor you would have to actually see significant pitting of the pot since
pot pitting is indicative of the act of dissolving the pot.


   Just another point:  I work with trace metals in environmental samples and
when I want to keep metals in solution I have to use extremely harsh pH's
(ca. -2 to +3).  This means keeping the metals dissolved.


   When I get the time I will do an Atomic Absorption Spectrometric workup
for the presence of aluminum in the wort due to being boiled in an aluminum
kettle.

Subject: Hops Growing




In regards to the recent hops growning questions, I thought I would share
my growing experiences. 
I live in Orlando Florida and I have been growing hops for the past 
3 years.  I've only grown Cascade, which seems to have done quite well
here despite the high temperatures in the summer.  


Hops rihzomes (roots) are usually sold and planted in the
spring.  I bought 5 rihzomes and planted them in various locations around my
property.  Only one survived.  The sun was just a little too hot and direct
for my other locations.  My survivor is on the shaded West side of my house, 
so it isn't baked 12 hours a day.  I try to keep the soil moist by 
flooding the growing area when needed (every other day here in the summer).  
The first year I the vine got about 15' and the yield was about 1/2 oz.  The
cones were ok, but not of the density and size I have seen from commercial
growers.  The vine dies back in the winter.  I cover up the exposed root
clump until spring when I expose it a bit and start to water.  The second
year the growth was about 40' and could have been longer but I pruned the
vine so it would branch out and I could get a greater yield.  Like most
plants the growth near the growing tip gets more of the good stuff.  So
the cones tended to get smaller and less dense in proportion to the distance
from the growing tip.  


As for a trellis, I used a rig illustrated below:


                           ^                        
                          / \                      
                         /   \                    
                        /     \
                       /       \
                     -------------

                     |  |  |  |  |


This consisted of a pole with strings hanging down and is suspend from 
two others that meet at the top.  At the apex I have another line that
runs through a pulley down to a stake at the ground.  This whole thing
is attached to an eye screw attached near the top of my chimney.  The
design allows me to raise the climbing trellis higher each year while
being able to lower the whole thing for harvesting.  I have also sometimes
tied horizontal stings to form a net like arrangement for some lateral
growth.  


Usually I harvest cones when they are full and are swollen with their
yellow sacks.  I generally cut a vine off at a branching point allowing
other areas to get more nutrients.   I continue this through the summer.


Last year I got about 6 oz from my single vine.  I spread the cones out
on a screen in a raise frame and let them air dry for a few days.   Then
I seal them in freezer wrap and foil; label them and into the freezer.  
It's not a large quantity but there is the satisfaction of having done it 
yourself.   


A friend has informed me that Barley, Malt and Vine has a book on growning
hops.

Subject: Brewing to Share!!!




     After my experience of this weekend, I'm facing a dilema.  I took a
few bottles of my latest batch over to some friends, to introduce them to
the wonderful world of homebrew.  However, these folks aren't "beer literate"
(i.e Coors & Bud fans all :^).  The general consensus was that everything
I offered them to taste (my own IPA, Bass for comparison, and Anchor porter
for something a little bit different) was "way too bitter" (my brother made
some comment about being served brake fluid :^).  




     I have had good luck in the past serving Mckesson stout, most imported
lagers, etc. (although, I wouldn't lay Pilsner Urquel on them :-)  But, sweet
stout and lager are a bit difficult to brew one's self, if you aren't set up
for it.  So, I'm wondering what the collective feeling of the net is on
brewing an ale (or steam beer) that is drinkable by the BudCoorsMiller fans,
but is an example of something better, something different.


     I think a plausable set of requirements would be as follows:


     1.  must be moderately hopped  (prob. 6.5-10 AAU / 5gal.)


     2.  Should be *pale* in color (i.e. should "look like beer")


     3.  Should have good body, good aroma, good flavor (maybe with a hint
         of sweetness?).


     This is just a thought.  How do YOU deal with introducing homebrew to
the *unwashed masses*?  If YOU had to brew something to please total
strangers, what would it be?  I'm open to suggestions/ideas/etc.


     BTW:  The consensus was that my IPA was *real* close to Bass, although
a touch more bitter (fine by me :-).

In Homebrew Digest #411, Kevin McBride asks for Oatmeal Stout recipes.
This is my attempt to duplicate the flavor of Watneys Cream Stout.
It came out a little on the thin side, but the flavor is almost
right on the money!  The recipe calls for using both oatmeal and
lactose.  Lactose is used in sweet stouts to give it a creamy sweet
taste, while the oatmeal adds a silky smoothness to the palate/flavor.
You can adjust the amounts of lactose and oatmeal in the recipe to
taste.  The recommended amounts of lactose from various books seems
to be around 8 oz.  One pound of oatmeal seems to be about right, but
you may want to be careful about increasing it very much because of its
oil/protein content.  The beer from this recipe came out great!
I can't wait to go tap off a glass of this stuff tonite!
                        Enjoy!

The husks contribute to the filter bed that you need during sparging.

P.S. I believe Polyclar is food grade polyethylene powder. I personally

  I'm told that some makers of sweet stout add lactose to the boil. For that 
matter a lot of breweries use various kinds of sugars as adjuncts. We should 
get over our automatic reflex about the use of sugars or at least make the 
distinction between various types and relative amounts. After all the major 
constituent of barley malt extract is the sugar maltose.
  I think that for certain beer styles lactose may be the right
thing to use to add sweetness. Here are some numbers from Line's "The Big Book
of Brewing": In "Dark Ale", a brown ale, 12 oz. In "McKinlay", a sweet stout,
one pound. In "Baltic Black Stout", 8 ounces. All these are for 4 imperial
gallons (5 US gallons).


>It finally happened little hop buds have erupted from the soil

  For two plants next to my house I drove nails into the side of the roof 
and strung green nylon string down to stakes next to the plants. They are 
winding their way up the strings nicely. For three plants in the back yard I 
strung a string between two trees and about 12 feet above the bed, then 
strung additional strings down from the horizontal one to stakes next to each 
plant. This is what "real beds" look like in the pictures I've seen but I 
think the cross pieces are wire instead of string and they are more like 18 
feet up (and between poles, not trees).
  My tallest Cascade grew 10 inches in the past 24 hours and is now 6 feet
tall. (Planted about 6 weeks ago)


>   Just wondering, does anybody know what is the chemical name of Polyclar?


PVPP is the other name I've seen for Polyclar AT. Powdered Nylon 66 was also
used by breweries before Polyclar was developed. PVPP stands for 
polyvinylpolypyrrolidone.

  It is that "in the expected ballpark" that is the sticky bit. Use dark malts,
maltodextrin or lactose (see above) and the original/final gravity ratio 
gets thrown off. With all-grain or partial mash recipes the effect is just
not deterministic until you get the hang of mashing.  While I was thrashing 
around exploring sugar rest limits last year I made beer that started at 1.050 
and ended at 1.019 one time and that started at 1.050 and ended at 1.006 
another time. I would have been up the creek either way if I expected the 
usual 1/4 gravity end point. Certain yeasts can produce significantly
different ending gravities too. 
  I've found that "Dextrocheck", "Clinitest" or a similar diabetes test is 
*the* trivial way to diagnose how much sugar is really left in the beer.

  Seeing as how you've gone out on a limb, I'll join you and we can try out
this saw I brought. You have forgotten the drastic difference in pH between
normal foods and wort. What does the inside of your pot look like above and 
below the high water mark? Is it shiny below and the usual dull color of 
oxidized aluminum above? Have you thought about weighing it from time to 
time? (big big :-)
  And I suppose that the aluminum compound you get from cooking with aluminum
is the same compound as found in Tums (with very tight chemical bonds)? Not
bloody likely.
  But it is interesting to read that you taste no difference. Others have said 
the impact on beer flavor is drastic.
  Now where did I put that PET bottle of homebrew :-)

  The husks are needed to create a filter bed for sparging. With a proper grind,
if you keep the pH down below 6, don't use too much sparge water and  keep it 
under 74 degrees C and DON'T AERATE THE HOT WORT you won't have problems with 
tannins. If the husks are powdered a faulty filter bed is created and powdered 
husk (called draff) will get into the wort and end up being boiled, more or 
less guaranteeing a load of tannins and all their associated haze and staling
hazards.


  One last item. You fiends out there need to rush to your supplier and buy
a copy of "Principles of Brewing Science" by George Fix. Actually, stop and ask
yourself "Do I understand basic chemistry principles or am I willing to learn
them?". If the answer is "yes", buy this book. If you aren't sure but after

Subject: Boulder gets a brewery


It would appear that Boulder--which is certainly the center of the universe
for homebrewing--finally has a real brewery.  I've complained far too much
about the Boulder Brewery and their underhopped, overcarbonated, funky-
tasting beers (always overchilled at the brewery, to add injury to insult).
But now we have the Walnut Brewery in downtown Boulder.  I doubt they'll be
selling anything off-premises for a while, if ever, but in the meantime
it looks like it's worth a visit if you're ever here in Homebrew Central.


I braved the opening-day crowds at the new brewery and tried to find a
spot momentarily quiet enough to contemplate a taster's flight of four
beers.  (I didn't go for all six; I didn't have the time or concentration.)
The beers are all well made, generously hopped, in good balance, and clean.


The beers I tasted:
    Buffalo Gold - about MoR in what's become a typical west-coast style
        pale ale, with just the right amount of the obligatory Cascades in
        the finish.
    Big Horn Bitter - serious bitter amber ale.  Nice body, drier than
        the Gold but still an interesting finish.
    Old Elk Brown Ale - light brown, reminiscent of a dark Munich lager
        with ale character laid on top.
    Devil's Thumb Stout - very dry, substantial stout.  May have a bit too
        much dark roast; I'll have to retaste this one but I'm looking
        forward to it.
The beers I didn't taste:  Swiss Trail Wheat Ale and The James Irish Red Ale.
(The names all refer to local stuff.)


Coming out of the gate, six beers is good.  I think they can expand to
eight.


They're off to a good start.  I hope they make it...Boulder has too many
people serious about good beer not to have a good local brewpub.

Subject:  Al & grain husks


Hi,
        Just a few comments: Three Cheers to John for coming to the defense
of aluminum( hip,hip, hooray!) One of my brewing associates has brewed lots
of batches in an aluminum stock pot( about 5 yrs. worth) and I see no evidence
of pitting, which would indicate dissolution of the metal. I have recently
invested in a 6 gal heavy walled Al pot and have not noticed any of the
dreaded off flavors either.
 On the question Gary had about grain husks; the first,and probably foremost,
reason for not getting rid of the husks is there essentiality in your sparging
filtration bed.(wait, is that a word?)


                                Happy Fermentations,

     There is a logical reason for leaving the husks on the malted barley:
Namely, they provide bulk to the mash, which facilitates sparging.  If they
weren't in there, sparging the mash would probably resemble sparging Cream of
(insert the name of your favorite hot cereal here :-).  So, the husks do
serve a purpose, and after all, people have been brewing for thousands of years 
and if there were no need to utilize the husks, they would have been left
behind long ago.

Subject:  RE:  John Polstra's comments on aluminum kettles


Distribution-File:
        homebrew%hpfcmr`at`hplabs.hp.com


To all:


   John Polstra's comments on aluminum kettles was right on the
money.  To look at this qualitatively, the pH of tomato juice is ca. 4.
Now, lets make spaghetti sauce.  Add all of your spices and boil (simmer)
for a while.  The pH is going to be less than 4 (i.e., more acidic).
According to Papazian, mashing enzymes work best around a pH of 5.4.
Even after boiling for an hour the pH isn't going to change munch.  So already
I have presented a pH difference relative to time of exposure to the "acid"
(pH of 4 vs ca. 5.4 with respect to days of exposure to hours exposure,
respectively).  Even after years of making spaghetti sauce in the same
aluminum pot, one does not see pitting therefore one should not see pitting
after years of boiling wort.  For your beer to have a noticeably matallic
flavor you would have to actually see significant pitting of the pot since
pot pitting is indicative of the act of dissolving the pot.


   Just another point:  I work with trace metals in environmental samples and
when I want to keep metals in solution I have to use extremely harsh pH's
(ca. -2 to +3).  This means keeping the metals dissolved.


   When I get the time I will do an Atomic Absorption Spectrometric workup
for the presence of aluminum in the wort due to being boiled in an aluminum
kettle.

Subject: Hops Growing




In regards to the recent hops growning questions, I thought I would share
my growing experiences. 
I live in Orlando Florida and I have been growing hops for the past 
3 years.  I've only grown Cascade, which seems to have done quite well
here despite the high temperatures in the summer.  


Hops rihzomes (roots) are usually sold and planted in the
spring.  I bought 5 rihzomes and planted them in various locations around my
property.  Only one survived.  The sun was just a little too hot and direct
for my other locations.  My survivor is on the shaded West side of my house, 
so it isn't baked 12 hours a day.  I try to keep the soil moist by 
flooding the growing area when needed (every other day here in the summer).  
The first year I the vine got about 15' and the yield was about 1/2 oz.  The
cones were ok, but not of the density and size I have seen from commercial
growers.  The vine dies back in the winter.  I cover up the exposed root
clump until spring when I expose it a bit and start to water.  The second
year the growth was about 40' and could have been longer but I pruned the
vine so it would branch out and I could get a greater yield.  Like most
plants the growth near the growing tip gets more of the good stuff.  So
the cones tended to get smaller and less dense in proportion to the distance
from the growing tip.  


As for a trellis, I used a rig illustrated below:


                           ^                        
                          / \                      
                         /   \                    
                        /     \
                       /       \
                     -------------

                     |  |  |  |  |
                     |  |  |  |  |


This consisted of a pole with strings hanging down and is suspend from 
two others that meet at the top.  At the apex I have another line that
runs through a pulley down to a stake at the ground.  This whole thing
is attached to an eye screw attached near the top of my chimney.  The
design allows me to raise the climbing trellis higher each year while
being able to lower the whole thing for harvesting.  I have also sometimes
tied horizontal stings to form a net like arrangement for some lateral
growth.  


Usually I harvest cones when they are full and are swollen with their
yellow sacks.  I generally cut a vine off at a branching point allowing
other areas to get more nutrients.   I continue this through the summer.


Last year I got about 6 oz from my single vine.  I spread the cones out
on a screen in a raise frame and let them air dry for a few days.   Then
I seal them in freezer wrap and foil; label them and into the freezer.  
It's not a large quantity but there is the satisfaction of having done it 
yourself.   


A friend has informed me that Barley, Malt and Vine has a book on growning
hops.

Subject: Brewing to Share!!!




     After my experience of this weekend, I'm facing a dilema.  I took a
few bottles of my latest batch over to some friends, to introduce them to
the wonderful world of homebrew.  However, these folks aren't "beer literate"
(i.e Coors & Bud fans all :^).  The general consensus was that everything
I offered them to taste (my own IPA, Bass for comparison, and Anchor porter
for something a little bit different) was "way too bitter" (my brother made
some comment about being served brake fluid :^).  




     I have had good luck in the past serving Mckesson stout, most imported
lagers, etc. (although, I wouldn't lay Pilsner Urquel on them :-)  But, sweet
stout and lager are a bit difficult to brew one's self, if you aren't set up
for it.  So, I'm wondering what the collective feeling of the net is on
brewing an ale (or steam beer) that is drinkable by the BudCoorsMiller fans,
but is an example of something better, something different.


     I think a plausable set of requirements would be as follows:


     1.  must be moderately hopped  (prob. 6.5-10 AAU / 5gal.)


     2.  Should be *pale* in color (i.e. should "look like beer")


     3.  Should have good body, good aroma, good flavor (maybe with a hint
         of sweetness?).


     This is just a thought.  How do YOU deal with introducing homebrew to
the *unwashed masses*?  If YOU had to brew something to please total
strangers, what would it be?  I'm open to suggestions/ideas/etc.


     BTW:  The consensus was that my IPA was *real* close to Bass, although
a touch more bitter (fine by me :-).

In Homebrew Digest #411, Kevin McBride asks for Oatmeal Stout recipes.
This is my attempt to duplicate the flavor of Watneys Cream Stout.
It came out a little on the thin side, but the flavor is almost
right on the money!  The recipe calls for using both oatmeal and
lactose.  Lactose is used in sweet stouts to give it a creamy sweet
taste, while the oatmeal adds a silky smoothness to the palate/flavor.
You can adjust the amounts of lactose and oatmeal in the recipe to
taste.  The recommended amounts of lactose from various books seems
to be around 8 oz.  One pound of oatmeal seems to be about right, but
you may want to be careful about increasing it very much because of its
oil/protein content.  The beer from this recipe came out great!
I can't wait to go tap off a glass of this stuff tonite!
                        Enjoy!

The husks contribute to the filter bed that you need during sparging.

P.S. I believe Polyclar is food grade polyethylene powder. I personally

  I'm told that some makers of sweet stout add lactose to the boil. For that 
matter a lot of breweries use various kinds of sugars as adjuncts. We should 
get over our automatic reflex about the use of sugars or at least make the 
distinction between various types and relative amounts. After all the major 
constituent of barley malt extract is the sugar maltose.
  I think that for certain beer styles lactose may be the right
thing to use to add sweetness. Here are some numbers from Line's "The Big Book
of Brewing": In "Dark Ale", a brown ale, 12 oz. In "McKinlay", a sweet stout,
one pound. In "Baltic Black Stout", 8 ounces. All these are for 4 imperial
gallons (5 US gallons).


>It finally happened little hop buds have erupted from the soil

  For two plants next to my house I drove nails into the side of the roof 
and strung green nylon string down to stakes next to the plants. They are 
winding their way up the strings nicely. For three plants in the back yard I 
strung a string between two trees and about 12 feet above the bed, then 
strung additional strings down from the horizontal one to stakes next to each 
plant. This is what "real beds" look like in the pictures I've seen but I 
think the cross pieces are wire instead of string and they are more like 18 
feet up (and between poles, not trees).
  My tallest Cascade grew 10 inches in the past 24 hours and is now 6 feet
tall. (Planted about 6 weeks ago)


>   Just wondering, does anybody know what is the chemical name of Polyclar?


PVPP is the other name I've seen for Polyclar AT. Powdered Nylon 66 was also
used by breweries before Polyclar was developed. PVPP stands for 
polyvinylpolypyrrolidone.


>stopped.  The only truly reliable way to determine when fermentation is

  It is that "in the expected ballpark" that is the sticky bit. Use dark malts,
maltodextrin or lactose (see above) and the original/final gravity ratio 
gets thrown off. With all-grain or partial mash recipes the effect is just
not deterministic until you get the hang of mashing.  While I was thrashing 
around exploring sugar rest limits last year I made beer that started at 1.050 
and ended at 1.019 one time and that started at 1.050 and ended at 1.006 
another time. I would have been up the creek either way if I expected the 
usual 1/4 gravity end point. Certain yeasts can produce significantly
different ending gravities too. 
  I've found that "Dextrocheck", "Clinitest" or a similar diabetes test is 
*the* trivial way to diagnose how much sugar is really left in the beer.

  Seeing as how you've gone out on a limb, I'll join you and we can try out
this saw I brought. You have forgotten the drastic difference in pH between
normal foods and wort. What does the inside of your pot look like above and 
below the high water mark? Is it shiny below and the usual dull color of 
oxidized aluminum above? Have you thought about weighing it from time to 
time? (big big :-)
  And I suppose that the aluminum compound you get from cooking with aluminum
is the same compound as found in Tums (with very tight chemical bonds)? Not
bloody likely.
  But it is interesting to read that you taste no difference. Others have said 
the impact on beer flavor is drastic.
  Now where did I put that PET bottle of homebrew :-)

  The husks are needed to create a filter bed for sparging. With a proper grind,
if you keep the pH down below 6, don't use too much sparge water and  keep it 
under 74 degrees C and DON'T AERATE THE HOT WORT you won't have problems with 
tannins. If the husks are powdered a faulty filter bed is created and powdered 
husk (called draff) will get into the wort and end up being boiled, more or 
less guaranteeing a load of tannins and all their associated haze and staling
hazards.


  One last item. You fiends out there need to rush to your supplier and buy
a copy of "Principles of Brewing Science" by George Fix. Actually, stop and ask
yourself "Do I understand basic chemistry principles or am I willing to learn
them?". If the answer is "yes", buy this book. If you aren't sure but after
reading the hard chapters in Noonan's book you said "I want more!", then buy 
this book. Here is the table of contents:
