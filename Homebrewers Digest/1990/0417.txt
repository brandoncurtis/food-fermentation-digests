Subject: Brewpubs in CIncinatti and Dayton


Someone asked for information about Cincinatti brewpubs.  My database
lists:
  Wallaby Bob's - Australian Brewpub.  "Wallaby Bob's is in a mall, and 
    might technically be a microbrewery, since they do (apparently) 
    bottle and sell their beer at least for takeout.


Dayton is not far away and as I just returned from a trip there I can
tell you about Growlers Brew Pub.  2221 Wagoner Ford Road, 3 Miles
North of downtown off I-75.  It is divided into a bar area (with tables)
and restaurant area.  We were there on a Monday and the place was
basically empty.  I asked for samplers of each beer which the menu
lists for $1 (3-4 oz.) and later the bartender didn't charge me for them.
Since I was driving I didn't order more.  They have (pubs comments inside "()")
Gold (Danish lager) A pleasant lager
Gaelic (Irish ale) my favorite - slightly reddish, nicely hopped
Grand (true English style amber ale) Don't believe them. This was a pleasant,
  but non-distinctive ale.  A bit over carbonated and underhopped, if you let
  me be critical.
Grog (classic dark Irish Ale) The bartended called this a stout.  You could
see through it, it was sweet and not very full bodied.  This wasn't a stout,
and not even a porter.  Its sweet taste and rather thin body was good, but
not what I expected.


We asked for a brewery tour.  The chap at the bar took us into the room
with 6 copper tanks, and spent all of 90 seconds telling us about it.
When I asked what hops they used he replied "imported".  The brewmaster
was in the back doing something, and I believe he could have said more.
The do add CO2 to their beer so it isn't natural.


The menu contains manu items made with beer including beer-cheese soup,
beer-burgers, brats.


All-in-all a pleasant place to visit, but not outstanding.

Later this month I will be going to San Jose for the Xhibition 90 conf.
I got out an old issue of Celebrator (California beer rag) to see what
was in the area and found a bewildering variety of brewpubs, pubs, and
a few retail stores.  Since I want to sample and bring back good beer
could anyone comment on any of the following brewpubs?  Which is best, and
where to find local bottled beer (we're going to specially pad a suitcase
just for beer).

Regarding wyeast packages bursting, I've had similar problems with them.
Usually, I'd pop the inner seal on the package and wait a couple of days.
It would swell so that the package felt tight, but I never had one break
open.  A few weeks ago, I got a package of German Ale yeast that was 5
months old.  I was somewhat concerned about its age, but I went ahead
and tried to use it.  The next night I had this terrible dream that someone
set off a bomb in my room, but then I realized, it wasn't a dream!  My
wyeast packet had exploded!  About a week later, I tried starting a wheat
yeast packet.  I was gone for the day, but when I returned, it too had
exploded!  I've used wyeast packets a lot and never had problems till
now.  The newer packets contain more wort than previously so maybe that's
why I've had problems.  I guess in the future I'll transfer the packet to
a starter while the packet is only mildly swollen, instead of waiting for
the boom!

Subject: Chip HitchcockUs stuck fermentation, Stupid grain mash question




Just a guess, but despite your sanitary procedures, IUd bet on an
infection as the cause of your overcarbonation.  It sounds like the 
brew didnUt get a good layer of CO2 for protection until late in the 
game, and it also sounds like the wort got kind of a lot of handling 
after it had cooled to room temp, both high-risk factors.


I moved to a house with a basement last November, and IUve been 
getting good fermentations at 50!-60! cellar temp.  I doubt the temp 
fluctuations you described would kill off enough yeast cells to shut 
down fermentation.


As for paint stirrers and aquarium bubblers, I seem to get enough
O2 by just splashing the hot wort as I pour into the primary.  I brew
extract (though IUm getting my courage up for a foray into grain
mashing).  I usually boil a total of about 3 gallons of volume, and put
1 gallon cold water in the bottom of the primary.  I strain through 
cheesecloth into the primary, and add cold water to bring total 
volume up to 5 gallons.  Pouring into some standing water seems to 
give enough aeration, and 2 gallons of cold water brings the overall
wort temp down to a pitchable level almost immediately.


This leads to my stupid mash question:  Can I mash an all-grain
batch with only 3 gallons of water, and then mix with cold water
for 5 gallons total volume?  Or is it really necessary to boil the full
volume of wort in an all grain mash?

I had a somewhat similar experience with this same recipe as far as the 
S.G.'s and the carbonation but the opposite regarding the yeast activity.  
I wasn't able to find the exact ingredients in Papazian's book, so I 
substitued what the homebrew shop had: 6 lbs dark extract, 2 lbs amber DME, 
1 lb black patent, 1.5 oz Cascade (boil), 1 oz Hallertaur (finish).  I 
rehydrated Edme yeast in a small amount of cooled wort, pitched when the 
wort in the primary reached 80 degrees.  S.G. 1.062.  I had SIGNIFICANT 
activity within 4 hours; the wort was bubbling away like crazy.  Activity 
had virtually stopped within 18 hours;  S.G. = 1.032; I had expected it to
be down to 1.020 as the recipe indicated, based on the activity level.  Two 
days later, S.G. was still 1.032.  I transferred to the secondary after which 
there was very little activity.  After ten days with no change in S.G. I 
discussed the situation with the local homebrew shop.  They felt that it was 
a stuck fermentation and that I should add a new yeast culter.   This started 
a little activity for two days then nothing.  So, what could I do?  I bottled 
with 3/4 cup corn sugar, as usual.  S.G. was 1.026.


After ten days, the brew is quite good and getting better each day.  However, 
it is very carbonated.  It's interesting: the brew in 16 oz Grolsh is more 
carbonated than that in the 12 oz or 22 oz (?); I have a odd collection of 
bottles.  No glass hand-grenades yet :-).


I am a real novice so I'd also appreciate any thoughts the more experienced
brewers have on this.  However, I'm not worried....

Here is your answer. Enders should have said something like, "Soper, you
dipstick, Munich is kilned higher than Vienna, not the other way around".
Instead, he just set us all straight.

In #416, someone inquired about lite homebrews.  [I inadvertently erased that
issue].  I've made lite ales several times for use on the masses and others
interested in them.  I will post a recipe or two when I bring my log book 
to work.


In #416, I commented on Marzens and Oktoberfests.  I didn't mean to sound
like some kind of absolute authority.  Lucky I didn't get yelled at.  
I received quite a number of requests for the Marzen recipe.  I'll also post
it in an upcoming issue.  Also, I will prepare a note on Swabish beers based
on my experience with them, my German friends' information, and my notes
while staying in Baden-Wurttemberg.  All to come.


For those who keg:


Have you found that haze is greater in kegged beer than in bottles?  I seem to
find this the case.

Subject: Extract for conditioning




Greetings:


I have a question regarding the use of malt extract for conditioning (
instead of the standard corn sugar.)  I've seen in Zymurgy that many of the 
award winning recipes seem to be conditioned with either wort or extract 
itself, so my brewing partner and I decided to give it a shot in our last 
batch, which was an Indian Pale Ale, so we used 3/4 cup dry amber extract 
for conditioning.  The beer itself tastes fine [no metalic flavor at all, 
despite the use of an Aluminium pot ;-)], but it's totally flat.  Now I 
know that British ales are traditionally somewhat less carbonated than 
many other beers, but I was hoping for some carbonation!


So my question is this:  Do you substitute dry extract for corn sugar, one 
for one on a volume basis, or what?  Maybe we screwed something else up?


Thanks for the  advice,

By the way, for Jay H.:  I don't use an aluminium pot so much because I'm 
cheap as because I've got better things to do with $30 - $35.  They just 
don't pay grad students the way we deserve to be paid!

Subject:  Yeast, haze


A couple of quick questions:


I've managed to get my hands on a couple of bottles of Tom Hardy Ale (!), and
I am planning to culture the yeast from the bottles. I'm going to use the
method in TCJOH by Papazian, but I'm thinking about using a larger (maybe
champagne) bottle, instead of the 12 oz. bottles he recommends. I've never
done this before, so I'd appreciate any helpful hints from those of you that
have (personal mail please, as I'm going to drink them Friday night).


As an aside, what should I expect for
from the T.Hardy? I've heard it's tremendous.....


On a different subject, I have a brew that never cleared (a "Pilsner" ale made
with M&F extract, M&F yeast, crystal, and corn sugar...nothing unusual). The
only difference between it and my other brews (all clear) was that I primed
this whole batch with a (boiled) sugar solution, as opposed to putting dry
sugar in each bottle. Of course, it could be an infection of some sort, (it
takes just fine), but I was wondering if the liquid sugar could have something
to do with the haze (that should be it "tastes" just fine...).  Anyway I'm
not worried about it, and it's prompted me to improve my (brewing) cleanliness
just in case....

Subject: Pale Ale, Round #2




     My latest batch of pale ale is proceeding nicely,  I racked to the 
secondary last night after a vigorous 5 day ferment `at` 70-75 deg. F.  I dry
hopped with 1/2 oz. 7.6% alpha Perle (for a 2 gal. batch).  This batch tastes
cleaner comming out of the primary (probably due to a better job of racking
the trub before pitching).  It seems to be a bit better balanced than the first
batch.  We'll know after it sits in the bottle for a while :-)




     For the curious, here's the lowdown on batch #2:


     Batch #2: Pale Ale                (Lower hop rate, prob. not enuf for IPA)


     2.4 # Pale Ale malt               (for 2 US gal.)
     0.4 # 80L Crystal malt
     0.5 oz. 7.6% alpha Perle Hops     (flavor)
     0.5 oz. 7.6% alpha Perle Hops     (finish, dry hopped)
     Wyeast #1028 London Ale yeast     (recult. from bat. #1, 500ml starter)


Production:


     Mash water: 5 qts. `at` 140F
     Mash in: `at`132F, pH adjusted to 5.4     
     Mash:  152-150F for 2 hrs.
     Mash out:  5 mins `at` 168F


     Sparge:  2.5 gal. `at` 160F


     Boil: 90 mins
     Hops: 1 addition, 45 mins from end of boil     (changed from 60)


     O.G.: 1.041
     F.G. ????     (probably around 1.010)


     Note that I don't have a final gravity figure, since it's not done.  
The first batch had a final gravity of 1.008, but the mash temp. was lower
(150-146F) and the O.G. was slightly higher (1.043).  I'll have the exact 
figure in about a week or two.

Subject: Strong stout, nekkid druids


I've been a subscriber to this digest for two days only, but already
I'm impressed by its high literary and technical standards.


Yesterday I drank my last bottle of Russian Empirical Stout with a couple
of close friends.  The recipe was inspired by "Imperial Russian Stout"
in Dave Line's "Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy".  It was the second
anniversary of the bottling date and so the beer showed a little oxidation,
but by and large it was still in excellent shape.  Viscous and black with
light carbonation and a fine-beaded medium-brown head, it still had good
balance, although the hop bitterness had faded with time to give
predominance to the dark malts.  It was bittersweet and almost
unbelievably long in the finish.  Here is the recipe, with no apologies for
metric units (1 lb. = 450 gm, 1 U. S. gal. = 3.8 litres):


2500  gm   Crushed Pale Malt (Canadian 2-row)
 400  gm   Crushed Caramel Malt
 150  gm   Crushed Chocolate Malt
 150  gm   Crushed Black Malt
2000  gm   Diastatic Malt Extract (unhopped)
  80  gm   Fuggles Hops
   8  gm   Chinook Hops
   1  tsp  Irish Moss
   1  tsp  Leigh Williams Yeast
   7  tsp  Pasteur Champagne Yeast (Red Star)
  45  gm   Dextrose (1/4 cup) for bottling


Yield: 13.5 litres at a specific gravity of 1106.  That's about 70%
efficiency by weight for the grains.


The brew date was December 13, 1987.  I used Toronto tap water treated
with 1/4 tsp. Epsom Salts.  The mash was for 1 hour at about 68 C.
The boil was for two hours (to reduce the volume) with all hops added
for the second hour (that's right - no finishing hops).  And, yes, the
brewpot was aluminum.


The primary fermentation was in a bucket for 4 days, with the first
racking into three 4-litre glass jugs with blow-out hoses.  SG 1048.
Second racking was 24 days later, into two 4-litre and one 2-litre jugs.
SG 1032.  At this stage the Leigh Williams yeast (all-purpose
dried beer yeast) seemed dead, so the champagne yeast was added.
I bottled one half-litre bottle at the time of the second racking,
and 28 regular bottles on May 9, 1988  The final gravity was 1031, so
the beer was about 10% alcohol by volume.


Any comments from people who have managed to brew at higher
original gravities than about 1066 (Battle of Hastings, right?) without
using extract would be most welcome.  Using a variant on the traditional
"strong ale/small beer" method, I can get a nice winter warmer with
an SG in the mid-sixties, but anything better seems to require malt
extract or ridiculously protracted boils.


And yes, I do brew at regular gravities as well.  Most of my brews start

Here's a partial reply to Gary Benson: I heard Pete Seeger singing your
"nekkid druids" quote on a recording of "Old Time Religion".  He had
quite a few non-standard verses (i.e. not biblical in origin) in addition
to that one.

Hello!
I'll be organizing a sidetrip during World Fantasy Con in
Chicago to visit the brew-pubs that were mentioned herein.
Thanks to whomever posted that list!
Two questions: Are there anymore?
               Would anyone interested in joining in please email me?
WFC isn't until November 1st, so there's plenty of time to get this
organized...

"Oh! ps: Would the person who has the quote in their .signature reading:

I'm beginning to think this is my PERMANENT .sig file!  I've been
told that it's by Pete Seeger, to be sung to the tune of "Ol' Time
Religion".  I've also been told it's a "Filk song", whatever that
may be (apparently related to SciFi or fantasy, I gather). 
Definitely 20th century, Gary (sorry!).  I first heard it at a New

By the bye, a doffing of the cap seems to be in order, to mark the
passing of the California hops industry.  This last week, the last
few poles in the last commercial hopyard in California were pulled
up.  A generation ago, the California hops industry provided
virtually all the hops used by American brewers, but changing tastes
put an end to it (about the only commercially viable hops in these
lattitudes are of the Cluster variety).

group.  I've been reading it since before the issues were numbered,
and in all that time I can only recall a couple of real, genuine,

aluminum vs. steel brewpots, or glass vs. plastic carboys (though
interestingly, never the perennial grain vs. extract wars) always
provoke discussion, but without Usenet's shrillness.  Most
refreshing.  Just like Bud ... 8-)  Go ahead, express your opinion.

I've used Wyeast a lot, and I've found their timing guidelines to be
nonsense.  The packages take 1-3 days to swell completely, and I have never
noticed *any* influence that the date has on this.  (They claim 1 day plus
1 day per month past the date on thepackage.)


In this case the package was partially swollen by morning, fully swollen
by evening.  I had planned on making it into a starter the next morning
and was too tired to do it that evening.  I should have either made the
starter or put the package in the fridge.


My beer is doing fine though, so I'm happy.  As long as I don't lose the
fruit of my mashing labor nothing is terrible.  BTW, it took 3+ days for
the substitute yeast, New Ulm, to show any evidence of fermentation.  I
pitched it directly from the swollen package into 5 gallons of wort.  In
the past I've made a starter.  In the future I'll made a starter.

Well, I for one can't imagine why a homebrewer would want to duplicate
the mild hop-flavored water that sells as Bud Light or Miller Lite.  If
you mean light lager like Heineken or Carlsberg, yes I've managed that.
But it was the hardest stuff I've ever made.  Even the tinest flaw shows
up.  I'm not convinced that such stuff can be made short of an all out
assault: good malt (all grain, no extract), great hops, first-rate liquid
yeast culture, and refrigeration.  Hearty ales are much more forgiving
and afford much more room for compromise.

I think this is nonsense.  I've left lager for 3 months at below 36 degrees F
and bottled with no extra yeast and got good results.  I did this
with Wyeast St. Louis and Bavarian.  The claims that the you'll need
more yeast have an intuitive appeal, to be sure, but they don't jive with
my experience.


The St. Louis batch was a Dutch-style light lager (malt, rice, Hallertau
and Tettnag hops).  I used no finings, but perciptated the haze by
cold storage.  The finished beer was crystal clear even at 40 degress F.
Even with this perfectly bright beer, though, I needed no extra yeast.
I have fined other batches, though, so the lack of finings wasn't the
reason I didn't need more yeast.


Bottom line: add your sugar (or wort) and bottle it.

Just a note to find out who all is going to the AHA National Conference
in Oakland this June.
If you are going, send me email & I will post a summary listing all
the netters who will be there.


In any case, my room will be party central as it has been for the last
5 years (yes my liver has survived 5 of these vicious assaults).
Please come on by & say howdy.
Ask for my room # at the front desk or ask anyone who looks intoxicated.
As usual, we will be holding on-going informal tests of home-grown herbal
hop substitutes 8-)


Unfortunately, I will not be driving out, so I will be unable to defend

Subject: cool label




Howdy -


At a recent Boston Beer Society meeting, we started tasting some
of the approx 100 bottles that were brought back from the last
Belgium trip.  While I don't want to foster jealousy by listing
all of the incredible beers we drank, one beer was so amusing
that I thought it would be fun to transcribe the label.


You can rest assured that the pinheads at the BATF would never approve
this label for import into this country (for our own good).


The best part is the picture that dominates the label.
It shows several gnomes partying in a beer cellar,
with huge kegs lining the walls.
One gnome is passed out in a mug the size of his head,
another is lying under one of the keg taps with beer flowing all over his
face, and my favorite is the gnome reclining on top of a keg with a hose
running from the tap to his mouth.


The accompanying text reads (bizarre capitalization and grammar is theirs):


CHOUFFELEIR
QUVAE ANNO MCMLXXXV + 4
vol % alc 8.998


this unique gnomes Beer was brewed in Auchouffe on 6 & 7 February 1989.


some ingredients are: 1100 kg Pale-Ale malt, 11 kg Kent hops,
Bay-Berry spice in homeopathic quantity.  We used also 6 drops
Real-Brussels-Sprouts-From-Scharbecque aromatics.
the same yeast as the former Chouffeleir brew was used for the
fermentation of this strong gnomes Beer.


total volume 3200 l
bottled 23/02/89


 - end of text.


Do you think that Dr. Bronner has gone into the beer business?


This beer is very good, like all the beers this brewery makes.
They are perhaps best known for McChouffe, their Scotch Ale
(remember Scotch Ale is very popular in Belgium).
