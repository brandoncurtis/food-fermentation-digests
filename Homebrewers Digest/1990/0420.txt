Maryland
  Olney Ale House - 2000 Sandy Spring Rd. (corner of Maryland Rt 108
    and Bird Rd) (301)774-6708


Maryland -- Baltimore:
  Sisson's Restaurant - "on East Cross Street, a few blocks from the Inner
    Harbor, has become the first brewpub in Maryland.  Sisson's is serving 
    golden and amberales, along with its existing list of about 60 specialty 
    beers and a menu that features Cajun and Creole dishes and fresh seafood."
    Another point of view on Sisson's - "I visited there Nov 89 after 
    reading this posting. I was *not* impressed by the beer -- certainly not 
    enough to drive the 40 minutes it took to get there. The beer was 
    `wimpy', lacking in any substantial body, and not real tasty. Their 
    porter was the best of the three they had, the others being a pilsner 
    (I think), and an amber ale.  At least it had some taste, but again, a 
    Bud had more body. Almost no hop or malt aromas either (per style). I 
    hope they eventually get their act together and do a reasonable beer 
    with guts and spirit."
  Baltimore Brewing Company - Albemarle Street at Pratt.  "The newest and
    brightest star on Maryland's brewing stage.  Authentic, elegantly-
    served German cuisine, comfortable setting.  Three regularly-brewed 
    lagers: Helles, Pils, and Dunkles.  Helles is similar to industrial 
    brews, light body and character.  Pils is robust and redolent with 
    hops. Dry and tasty.  Dunkles is a creamy dark beer with a roast 
    malt character."  Another comment: "Currently three beers: Helles 
    (rich, full-bodied, well-hopped), Pils (lighter, also full-bodied
    and very well hopped), and Dunkle (dark, full-bodied, malty). All 
    very good, German-style beers. The guy I talked to said they are 
    going to be offering a bock and a weizen as the seasons evolve. I've 
    been there twice, and the character of the beer has been slightly 
    variable, due largly to the newness of the place. Very busy on 
    weekend evenings. Reasonably good German food, too, and all at fair 
    prices."
 
Maryland -- Cambridge:
  Wild Goose Brewing Co. -- "Makes only one beer at this time, "Wild Goose
    Amber".  Coppery color with a predominintly bitter hops flavor and a 
    long-lasting hops aftertaste.  Very good."
 
Maryland -- Glen Burnie:
  The British Brewing Co. - 6759 Baymeadow Dr.  "Until ~Nov. 89 only 
    sold to a chain of bars, now available in bottles, at least in 
    Annapolis, MD; name is Oxford Class.  English style ale, low
    carbonation, nice amber color. Precious little malt/hop aroma.  I 
    didn't find it had a lot of taste, and not much body.  While drinking 
    it, I kept thinking of tap water.  I describe it as `wimpy', but a 
    friend of mine enjoys it quite a bit (he says there's lots-o-hops). 
    The brewer is from England, and he keeps increasing the amount of 
    carbonation from what it typical in England to what can keep 
    Americans pacified. He also seems to be tweaking the recipe in each 
    batch, as subsequent tastings have been different.  I'd recommend 
    drinking this beer at cellar temperature, although the label 
    suggests drinking it cold (Americanism?)."

P.S. I got lots of responses go far (many contradictory) on San Jose
pubs and brewpubs, but I have a lot to explore and little time to do it in.

Subject: Thank you!


Hi, all!


My thanks to everyone who replied to my query about _Brewing Beers Like Those 
You Buy_.  *Everyone* said the same thing:  the book is very British, very 
dated, and definitely for grain brewers.  So, sorry John; I'll decline on 
buying your copy-- even cheap! :-)


On the other hand, I got several recommendations for the _Winner's Circle_ (is 
that correct?) recipe book from AHA.  Since I hope to be in Denver/Boulder 
again this November, I also hope to go to the AHA offices.  Does anybody know 
if you can purchase stuff (like books, T-shirts) direct, on site?  I might as 
well save on the shipping and handling costs if I can.


Again:  my thanks!




                         Yours in Carbonation,

Subject:  Bitter in extracts, casks


Does anyone know the amount of bittering (in alpha units) in the average
hopped extract? Does it vary very much between extracts?


On a less technical note, I had some homemade apple wine last night. It was
good, BUT what it was pulled from was even more interesting: A white oak
cask! The guy had 2 of them that he bought for $30 20 years ago. I didn't ask
but they were probably 100 gallons (or maybe 50 gallons, he made a 100 gallon
batch once, he might have used both for that). Anyway the wine had a nice oak
flavor to it and was really nutty (in flavor). Anyone have any experience
with oak-aged brew? How about availability of oak casks (albeit smaller ones)?

Subject: Exploding Wyeast pkgs., Defusing Time Bombs :-)




     The last time I started a Wyeast package, I only left it overnight, and
the package was quite highly presurized 12 hrs. later.  Unfortunately, I
wasn't ready to pitch yet. 


     This left me with something of a time bomb on my hands.  I didn't want
to refrigerate the package, lest I temperature shock the yeasties.  Neither
did I want to leave it untouched, lest it go boom, and spray yeasties all over
the kitchen.  Sooooooooo, I cleaned off the package, sterilized the outside
with bleach solution, heated a needle (to sterlize same), and poked a small
vent hole in one corner of the package.  I set the package upright into a
pint widemouth jar, and relaxed, etc.


     The package was still softly hissing when I was ready to pitch, so no
airborne contamination worries.  Note that I was going to use the yeast the
same day.  I also agree with those who say the Wyeast recomended starting times
are overly pessimistic.  It probably shouldn't take more than a day or two to
get the yeast up and running, especially if you keep the activated package
in a reasonably warm place (I like to keep mine in the kitchen when I'm boiling
or mashing, of course any warm spot of 85-90F will fire up the yeasties).

Subject: Kudos and a last note on homebrew for the unwashed...




I've been hanging around this net for about a month, and I think it's 
time I said "Thanks" to Rob Gardner for keeping this thing going. Nice 
job! (insert E-mail convention for cheers and confetti) Post a mailing 
address and I'll send ya a brewski.


Re a homebrew for mass consumption, I've had a revision to my 
earlier posting to Todd Enders. I uncapped the first of my smoked 
beer yesterday, and I think it might be a good one to try on the Bud 
crowd. It's not too far from the mainstream in terms of color and 
bitterness, but it's definitely different from anything you could pick 
up at the 7-11 or other convenience store of choice.


I followed the recipe for rauchbier in Joy of Homebrewing with a few 
modifications. I lightened it up a bit (in deference to what I'm told 
will be 100+ temperatures coming soon), and switched some hops 
from boiling to finish, just cause I like more finishing hops. With the 
deletion of the darker grain adjuncts, this became a real simple all-
extract recipe. This is from memory, since I don't have any notes here at the cube:


7 lb. light extract (I used bulk)
2 - 3 gallons water
1 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke (now that I know I like this stuff, I'll try 
smoking grain on the BBQ soon)
1 1/2 oz. Tettnanger boiling hops
1 oz. Tettenanger finishing hops
1/2 tsp. Irish Moss
2 pkg. the dreaded Red Star lager yeast


Boil it up for 45 min. 5 more min. with moss, 2-3 min with finishing 
hops.


Strain into primary with cold water in the bottom, and pitch the 
yeast (rehydrated in 95 degree water) As Pete Soper pointed out, I 
must be pitching into 120 degree wort with this technique, not the 
95-100 degree I thought I was. However, it took off in 12 hours. 3 
days in the primary, rack to secondary, 3-4 weeks in the secondary, 
2 weeks in the bottle, and down my throat.


It's basically a nice light beer, but with a definite smoke aftertaste. 
Like I said, mainstream, but with a non-commercial twist.

PS - I meant to say boil in about 2-3 gallons water, and after straining
add enough to bring total volume up to 5 gallons of beer.

Subject: a talk with the ABC


        At the last meeting of QUAFF, the San Diego homebrew
club, we were privledged to have Jim Sabins, an inspector for
the Alcoholic Beverage Control agency, as guest speaker. Tho
his talk referred mostly to California law, it may be
interesting to residents of the Real World as well.


        He gave a brief talk then answered questions from the
audience, and I took notes on what I could hear over the usual
raucous babble of lots of people enjoying good beer.


        His agency has responsibility for enforcing about five
thousand (that's 5*10^3) laws. Statewide, there are 225
inspectors, 15 in the San Diego region to patrol around five
thousand license holders.


        We discussed license procedures and fees--this was
hopelessly dull and you can get the data elsewhere. He did
point out that brewpubs count as manufacturers, not retailers,
so a lot of laws don't apply to them. For instance, if the ABC
gets community objections to a retail outlet, there's a
hearing, and public objections can scuttle a licenses app. Not
so for a "manufacturer." Also, each new label for an alcoholic
beverage is reviewed by an ABC person in 'Frisco, and the ATF.
He didn't have an answer to questions about why various
brewers aren't allowed to state the alcohol content on the
label.


        Of more interest to homebrewers: it is a federal crime
to send alcoholic beverages thru the mail, tho UPS is legal
(UPS apparently has other ideas about the legality). You can
bring your own beverage to a restaraunt, and they can charge
you a corkage fee to serve it to you, if they have a license
to sell that beverage. If they don't, it's questionable, and
ABC has a lot of arbitrary authority. If it's causing a "law
enforcement problem," they can haul you off to jail and/or
revoke licenses.


        You can brew up to 200 gal/year if there are >1 adult
in the household, 100 gal/year otherwise. In your own
household, there are no restrictions about who you can serve
it to. The text of the law states that you can transport it
off premesis for competitions, and Jim stated that anything
short of selling it was ok too; the only restriction is age.


        Homebrew is supposed to be under %4 alcohol by volume.
If greater, its alcohol content must be labelled on each
container or tap.


        He didn't go into any of the really silly laws, and
was interrupted halfway thru by a singing "happy birthday"
telegram to the owner of the local homebrew supply emporium.
He handled himself quite well, and appeared to enjoy the beer.
The agency he works for is not noted for its sense of humor,
by contrast.

Subject: my cheap immersion wort chiller




A couple people asked me about my $13 wort chiller that I mentioned
in my recent posting on half-mashing, so here's what I did:


10 ft. (already) coiled 3/8 inch O.D. flexible copper tubing
       This was in the plumbing area of the local Hechinger's
       lumber/home supply store.  I saw similar tubing in Sears with
       their refrigerator stuff (used in an automatic ice maker) - see
       note below.  Cost: $9.99.
3/8 inch compression fitting to ? inch pipe fitting.  Cost $1.something
? inch pipe fitting to garden hose adaptor.  Cost $1.something.
       Sorry to sound evasive on this.  I knew the 3/8 inch beginning
       and the garden hose end - any intermediate size didn't concern
       me.  I merely matched up the adaptors in the store.  I would
       have preferred to have done this with one flange, but none were
       available, so I combined two.  Note that you will need to put a
       bit of teflon tape on the threads of the intermediate threads
       to prevent leakage.


3 ft. 3/8 inch I.D. clear tubing.  Cost $0.25/ft.


Since the copper tubing is already coiled, there's very little work
involved in shaping it right.  I just took the coil and stretched it
out a bit, and bent the ends a little bit.  You probably want to be a
bit careful not to kink the tubing at this point.  Rather than waste
good copper tubing running both ends out of the stockpot, I used clear
tubing on the bottom end and ran that out of the stockpot.


Tighten up the compression fitting and the intermediate adaptor,
connect one end to a garden hose and pump up the jam.  :-)  Like I
said before, I combine the immersion chiller with a big utility sink
full of water.  The chiller output goes into the sink, and I carefully
drain the sink as the water level approaches the top of the stockpot.
Rocking the stockpot a bit from time to time to get fluid currents
moving in the pot and in the sink can't hurt either (and, in fact, is
probably unavoidable :-).


The chiller, once I decided on the parts, literally took me all of 10
minutes to assemble.  The cost savings over commercially available
chillers was enough to justify doing it myself.  As I said before, I
chilled 4 gallons of boiling wort in about 20 minutes.  You can
probably improve on this a bit if you use a longer piece of copper
tubing - Sears has a 20 ft. piece of pre-coiled tubing, but the O.D.
is smaller (1/4 inch?).  I felt that the trade-off between tube length
and water flow was worth using the shorter tubing.  (Freakin'
Mechanical Engineering degree, dontchaknow... :-)


Hope someone else finds this useful!


Cheers,


Ken
