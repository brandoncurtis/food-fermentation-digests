There are two homebrew shops, and only two, in South Florida. There is
one, very small shop in Ft. Lauderdale, not recommended, and there is
Wine and Brew By You, in South Miami, which may be the largest homebrew
shop in the country. 5760 Bird Rd, South Miami (305) 666-5757


South Miami is about 30 minutes by car from Ft. Lauderdale, 45-60
minutes by train+metrorail, or 90-150 minutes by buses, or 20 minutes
by personal helicopter, though landing's a bitch.

Subject: Wyeast Operations


At last month's homebrewers meeting here in Boulder it was mentioned that
Wyeast had burned and that they were temporarily out of business (I assume
that they will be rebuilding).  It might be very timely for concerns
about package bursting to get to Wyeast now so that they can incorporate
changes into the new production line.  Also at that meeting, we had a great
talk about culturing yeast and making starters.  It is not too difficult
and avoids the cost of Wyeast after the first time.

I, for one, would like to try my hand at lower-alcohol beers. Since I'm
gearing up for summer production :-), there's nothing I'd like more
than a (few) nice cold refreshing homebrew(s) anytime I want, without
having to worry about too much alcohol ...

Last Friday afternoon the AHA had "Open House" with mediocre munchies but lots
of great homebrew.  I didn't ask about buying anything, but I noticed several
T-shirts displayed for sale.  I assume that the rest of the stuff from "The
Beer Lovers Store" is available.  Besides, they're nice folks - I'm sure they
would be willing to sell you that stuff if you explained that you came all the
way from Florida just to see them and give them a beer.


The only possible problem I can see is (since you said you will be here in
November, I assume you're coming for the Great American Beer Festival, November
2&3) that they may be swamped with festival work and won't have much time to
talk to you.


If you send me a note closer to the time of your trip I may be able to get
better information for you.

Subject: good brew within your lifetime


Being an impatient person, I have been unable to fully relax in my home-
brewing in the past.  I mean, waiting for the beer to age is a real drag.
Because of this, I've recently made attempts to reduce the brew cycle time.
These attempts have paid off.  I now believe it is possible to brew quality
beer in less than two weeks.  May I offer the following techniques for 
reduced brewing time?  (There's a catch--you need to keg.)


In an effort to reduce all aspects of brewing time, I looked at various points
in the brewing cycle.  Significant points are mentioned.


Day #1.  I mixed the grains together and ground them with the Corona mill, in
the evening after dinner.


Day #2.  I mashed using a single-temperature mash at 155 deg F.  Papazian's
formula results in a lower mash temperature, so I use water 10 deg F higher
than he recommends.  Again, the mashing takes place after dinner, and I let
the runoff go overnight.


Day #3.  (Normally on the weekend) I boil the wort and strain.  I use a
chiller to speed up the cooling.  After cooling, I add the hydrated yeast
without racking off of the trub.


Day #4.  Fermentation going.  Day #5.  Rack off directly into keg.  Add hops
for dry hopping in cheesecloth bag.  Pressurize and set aside.


Day #'s 5,6,7.  Keg conditioning and carbonation occurs.


Day #8.  Put in keg reefer.  


Day #9.  Wait.  Day #10.  Begin drinking.


Although the mashing occurs over a 2 day period, I only spend a little time
each day.  The boiling and chilling takes about 2 hours.  When the keg is first
opened, the beer is still cloudy from yeast.  But yeast is good for you.  By
the 14th day significant clearing has occurred due to the chilling in the
reefer.  By day 21, it is clear and clean.  The ale I have made by this method
isn't as good as ale aged a month or more in the keg, but it is still very
good beer.  In fact, I enjoy it much more than many of the swillpub brews on
tap here in the Northwest.  This method allows me to have a "house ale" and 
frees up my equipment for the making of beers with longer aging times, such
as lagers and dark ales.  So far, I have only tried the method on pale ales.
By using these shortcut methods, it is possible for me to make good beer 
within my lifetime

I knew in the back of my mind that the answer to this question was in a past 
issue of ZYMURGY and I finally found it!  I moved recently and haven't 
unpacked all the boxes.


The winter 1989 ZYMURGY contains an article called "An Easy Guide to Recipe 
Formulation" by Monica Favre and Tracy Loysen.  They reference an AHA 
publication, "How to Use Specialty Malts, with Malt Extract Conversions", 
which I do not have.  I have not used this method, but plan on tryying it the 
next time I brew.  Here are the adjunct malt characteristics and malt extract
conversions from the table in the article: 


Adjunct Malt Characteristics:


black patent malt:  dry, burnt, charcoal bitterness
roasted barley:     coffee-like bitterness, roasted flavor
chocolate malt:     dark color, toasted flavor
crystal malt:       sweet, amber color, adds body


Malt Extract Conversions:


5 lbs. Very Dark Extract =    5 lbs. light or amber malt extract + 2 cups 
                              black, roasted, or chocolate


5 lbs. Amber Extract =        5 lbs. light malt extract + 2 cups crystal malt 
                     =        5 lbs. light malt extract + 1/2 cup black,
                              roasted, or chocolate


5 lbs. Medium Brown Extract = 5 lbs. light or amber malt extract + 1 cup black, 
                              roasted, or chocolate malt + (optional) 1 or 2 
                              cups crystal


The above article is an excellent source for those extract brewers who want to 
do some of their own designing of recipes without taking the step towards 
mashing.

Yes you can purchase anything from the catalog at the office.
The office is open 8 - 5 Monday to Friday, except Wednesday 10 - 5.
They are mostly set up for mail order. If you are in a hurry, or
will be coming in at close to 5 PM, it is best to call ahead so they can
have your order ready when you arrive.

Good gosh Chris! TEA! What about homebrew?!?!?
I pre-boil my water to kill off nasties and then chill it.  Since I suddenly,
with the purchase of a home, must pay for water, I think that I will (and
should have been even when it was "free") be more frugal with the water I use.
I'll probably catch gallons 2 through 6 and use them for the next batch.

I agree with John Polstra that weight-for-weight is the way to go,
except that you need to add 20% by weight MORE powdered malt
because powdered malt is not 100% fermentable whereas corn sugar is.

I don't think so.  But we're both computer experts, not organic chemists.


From my wife's organic chemistry book[1], I gather the invert sugar is
a di-saccharide consisting of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-)-fructose.  The
first of these is dextrose (dextrorotary glucose); the second is
levorotary fructose.  So what we have is right-handed glucose plus
left-handed fructose.


Common table sugar (sucrose) is similar; it is dextrose + dextrorotary
fructose.


Honey is mostly invert sugar; the bees supply the invertase, which is
the enzyme that inverts the fructose.  Yeast also can generate invertase.
They will do this if you put sucrose in your beer.  The yeast will make
invertase to convert sucrose into invert sugar.


So if you add invert sugar instead of sucrose, you'll save the yeast a
step.  There is an ongoing argument over whether the inversion process
creates unhappy byproducts.


In any event, invert sugar is not dextrose.  Dave Line, in the Big
Book of Brewing [2], describes a process to invert sucrose with citric
acid.  He dances around the issue a big, but it's pretty clear that he's
talking about a left-handed di-saccharide.


However, my Webster's, while noting that the above definition of invert
sugar is #1, lists "dextrose obtained from starch" as a number two
definition!  This can't be what Dave Line intended, though, as it
conflicts with his writing.

The simple fact is that "non-alcoholic beer" is a contradiction.  Note
that the brewers don't call their 1/2% alcohol malt beverages beer; I'm not
sure, but I doubt that they legally could call it beer even if they wanted to.


> Is there something WRONG with beer that has less than .5% alcohol?  Does 
> alcohol have to be a major part of the equation?  


Yes.


In a similar vein, what's wrong with ice cream that's low in fat?  Fat, like
alcohol, is bad.   (Or so the diet police tell us.)  But if you lower the
fat below a certain minimum, the USDA won't let you call it ice cream.  Lower
the fat enough in margarine and you get "spread."  Lower the sugar in jelly
and you get "spread."


This is not arbitrary or pedantic.  Alcohol has taste.  The presence of alcohol
in beer is historically more important than hops (which have only a few
centuries of use), and more important than barley malt (beer can be made
entirely from other grains).  Alcohol is one of the major contributors to
the smell, taste, and mouth feel of beer.  Moderate amounts of alcohol are
at the very core of what makes beer, beer.  Concentrate the alcohol by
distillation and you have whiskey; take it out and you get non-alcoholic
malt beverage.


This is not to say that de-alcoholized beer is necessarily bad, only that
it's not beer.  If you want to judge it, put it in a special category.


> Question:  would homebrewers like to try a brewing system that allowed them
> to make excellent beers with a lower final alcohol level?


The non-alcoholic "beers" I've had were less than satisfactory.  Most tended
to be horribly balanced to malt (underhopped).  O'Doule's was better
balanced, but runs head up against the _real_ problem.  Alcohol has taste.
O'Doule's tastes weird because it lacks alcohol.


I'm guessing, do do the brewers use low temperature evaporation?  Sounds
messy and perhaps dangerous to do at home.
