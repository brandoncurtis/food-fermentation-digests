Subject:  Root Beer Recipes




With summer coming on I thought I'd like to try making some root beer,
birch beer or sarsaparilla.  This would be specially good for those
times there's alot of kids over, they can have their own homebrew while
the adults have theirs.  I'm collecting recipes and would like to know
if there's any favorites out there you'd like to share?  If this has
already been covered, my apologies, in any case, thanks,
                                                        Rob

The paragraph equating invert sugar with dextrose did not originate in my
brain.  I quoted it directly from Dave Line's _Beer Kits and Brewing_.  From
it I concluded that "dextrose" is what he meant when he said "invert sugar." 
From what you quoted, he seems to be confusing the two meanings, so it is
difficult to know what he means when he says, "invert sugar" in a recipe.
Perhaps he has found no significant difference, or perhaps he just looked up
"invert sugar" and copied down the definition.


Most likely, large-scale British brewers use invert sugar formed by the
hydrolysis of sucrose.  The question is, when you walk into a British homebrew
supply and pick up a bag of "invert sugar," is it hydrolized sucrose or
dextrose or unknown?  Does anybody know?

Subject:  Brewcraft Plastic Kegs






I recently saw a kegging system in one of the mail order catalogs
and I would like to know if anyone out there has any experience with it.
It is the brewcraft plastic 'pressure keg.'  I would really appreciate
any information/recommendations/etc that anyone might have with this
system.


On another subject; I would also like to know if anyone has had any luck
with making something at home that is close to Old Peculiar.  I seem to
remember methods for imitating this brew were being kicked around a
little while back, but I didn't really pay attention to it.  If anyone
could send me a recipe, or point out which digest(s) I need, it would be
really helpful.


Thanks a lot!
