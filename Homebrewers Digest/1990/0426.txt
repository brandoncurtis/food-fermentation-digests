Subject: What does "yeasty" taste like?


Greetings, homebrew fans!


I've opened some "not-quite-ready" beer (it's only been in the bottles for
a week to two weeks) and it tasted "metallic".  Is this what "yeasty"
tastes like?  "Yeasty" had always tasted kind of sharp, but usually, that
was in more mature bottles.  (This is the batch that a few bottle caps
landed in, by accident, when I was bottling.  The bottle caps were sterile.
I didn't discover them until after bottling.)

I got a large improvement in flavor when I switched to blow-off
techniques. This subject is probably going to lead to flaming, as it's a
subject of great controversy. Your answer depends on your individual
tastes. I tried a batch a few months back the old way in a 7 gallon
plastic bucket letting the foam collapse back in - I didn't like the
result. However, the amount of improvement in my brew's flavor was more
noticeable with all the following switches I made over the past years.


1) Boiling all water, including water to chill in fridge to bring batch
to 5 gal. in carbuoy.


2) Switching to Leigh-williams stout yeast - mostly, I think, because of
enough of a volume of yeast into the starter so I usually get blowoff
within 2-4 hours of placing into primary, and completed primary ferment (no
secondary) within 5-6 days.


3) Switching from boiled water to filtered water - no chlorine in water
I start my grains in? I do grains and extract mixed.


4) Changing from canned malt extract to dried malt extract.

See my #2 above. I pitched at Midnight Wed, and at 10 am Fri I had my
fermentation lock on & it was bubbling at 1 per 5 sec..


A) Do you have an inch or two of yeast on the bottom?
B) Does your hydrometer read a reasonable number (~25% of OG for regular
batches, ~33% for batches with lots of unfermentable dextrins like my brews
have)?.


If so, you're golden. Don't be like the novice brewer we had here. After
tasting a sample bottle that he wanted us to analyze to figure out why his brew
was bad, we had to sadly inform him that he had poured 5 gallons of
perfectly fine brew down the drain due to excessive worry.....

Anyone on the west side of Chicago should note
that American Science Center (a.k.a. Jerryco) 5696
Northwest Highway (312) 763-0313, had urine
testing hydrometers, range 1.000 to 1.060 for
$3.50. Small size, reducing whatcha need to use up
in a sample.


There's also a Milwaukee store (414) 281-2322, and
an affiliate: Grande Junquetion Ltd, 100 South Lyn

Subject: review of Sieben's in Chicago


I was in Chicago last weekend, and got to the Sieben brewpub for dinner.
436 W. Ontario. Parking on the street very crowded due to dance club
across the street. $3.00 parking at lot a block west of the brewery.
Large water tower with Sieben label on top of building. Either a dance
club or a function room that was having a wedding attached (shares
bathrooms via a corridor). This led to the building resounding with the
thumpy, overcranked bass, but didn't really interfere with conversation.


Atmosphere: The non-smoking section involved the Maitre-de-ess seating
us at a table and removing the ashtray. Not legal under area laws as I
understand them, but then the ventilation was goo enough so that I
wasn't bothered by the party of 6 smoking at the table next to us.


The large copper-domed brew kettles are displayed behind glass as you
walk in.


Food:  Very good rating by both of us. Generous portions at reasonable
pricing.


Beer Cheese soup very good, but also VERY salty. What they served as a
cup would pass for a bowl in any other place I've been.


Onion rings $5 for a loaf. I had just these for dinner, and couldn't
finish the portion. Suitable to serve 4 hungries as an appetizer! Also
very good. Barbecue sauce served with them was potent. I'd love to try
it on ribs, but don't remember if ribs were on the menu (but they gotta
be, right? I mean this *was* Chicago.....).


My partners Reuben sandwich good but a little shy on amount of
sauerkraut. German Potato Salad served with was also very nice. Flavors
blended nicely and richly, without the harsh overtones most have.


Brews: All served cold, but not excessively so, carbonation shy of
traditional american brews (just right for me). All less hopped (both
bittering and finishing) than other brewpubs I've visited. A sampler of
four 8 oz. glasses cost $3.50. Alcohol content did not seem very high. I
expected to notice more effects after 30-35 oz. of brew, but would not
have driven right afterwards.


Weiss - served with lemon. Blah. The lemon totally overpowered any wheat
flavor that might have been there. Not an unpleasant drink on its own
(lemon beer), but not what I would expect from a weiss.


Lager - equivalent to a good, premium, domestic with more than average
flavor. Nice, but not great on any count. Non-distinctive, in other
words. Suitable more for the average bar-hopper crowd as an intro to
what real brewers can make.


Amber - sorta wimpy, smooth, and non-distinct like the lager, but a bit
different and richer. Another good brew to use to start introducing
Budalobe drinkers to what brewing can produce. They liken this to Bass,
but I haven't had Bass served as this was (it's always in a bottle, too
cold and too carbonated). Better, creamier head than I've ever seen Bass
have.


Irish - A rich, warm brew with an undescribable flavor (at least by me -
might have been the diacetyl butterscotch folks have been talking of, of
late). VERY nice - I could easily drink this all evening.


Bock - Very nice, smooth, rich, & malty. Another brew I could drink all
night. This wasn't really available this evening, as they were having
problems with that line (overcarbonation and gushing, I believe), but I
mentioned that I was going to review their brews for the net, and the
waiter managed to dribble some brew out for me to sample. I wasn't
billed for this and don't know if it's normally included in the sampler.
Mentioning that I was doing the review may also be why the soup portion
was so large, but it was the only way I could get some Bock.


My recommendations would be to skip the Weiss, Amber, and Lager, or
split a sampler among four folks without diseases. I think regular
glasses are $2, and double glasses are $4, but I was paying more
attention to my friend and driver than the menu.


For those of you doing the World Fantasy Con brew-hop trip that R. Allen
Jervis is trying to organize over Halloween, I'd rate this as slightly
better quality food, beer different but about equal (dark brew available
here but not Goose, but Goose had hoppy pilsner), but a good deal
cheaper than Goose Island (which I reviewed a few months back) in both
food & beer. The Berghoff downtown is listed in brew guides, but only
seemed to be a better than average German restaurant with its own
bottled brew, which is not exceptional. Don't worry if you miss it, but
be sure to hit both Sieben and Goose Island.


BTW, Baderbrau (a Chicago microbrew) is available in bottles in stores
in the area, now. I didn't pick any up or try it, as we were planning on
Von Stuke's Hofbrau but failed to make it.

Subject: Re: Stuck Fermentation




Before I went around badmouthing Red Star yeast, I'd take a hydrometer
reading.  It's not unheard of for a primary fermentation to be essentially
finished in a day or two -- in fact, the someone asked about the same
thing on the Net a few months ago.  Turned out that when they tried 
a hydrometer reading they found that their fermentation had stopped for
lack of fermentables in the wort ;-)


If your hydrometer reading isn't close to the final gravity in your
recipe, then your fermentation is probably stuck, and you should follow
the standard unsticking procedures.  If the gravity reading is close to
the FG in your recipe, it's time to rack into the secondary.


I need to say something in response to the fellow who suggested that
using Red Star yeast was the cause of your problem.  In my experience,
Red Star isn't great yeast, but it does do the job, and I have one
recipe where I prefer the taste with Red Star over the taste with
Whitbread's.  There are lots of things you can do to affect the quality
of the finished product, and some (like sanitation) are (in my
experience) much more important than others.  If you start Red Star in
a starter wort a day or two before you brew, you should get acceptable
results.

Subject: how to get yeast slurry




        A friend of mine who was doing a two stage fermentation saved his
yeast slurry for me and for another batch of his.  Papazian says that the
best yeast to use is yeast slurry, and we must agree that it worked great.
We just pitched it without creating a starter and things got going in no
time.  The question is, how do you collect the slurry if you are doing a
single stage fermentation?  Will it simply pour out of the carboy well?
Also, how long will it stay good for?  Can you even freeze it or will the
yeast take offense to that?

To continue the exploding Wyeast packet thread:  Last night I had
one burst when I tried to start it!  Not only did the inner capsule
rupture, but the outer packet as well ... yeast and culture medium,
all over the kitchen.  Bummer.  The homebrew shop where I got it
(R&R Home Fermentations in Sacramento) told me to bring it back, and
they'll presumably send it back to Wyeast so they can study the
obvious design flaw in their package.  I hope I have a viable
culture to pitch on Sunday ...

Subject: Blow Off Problems


The question was raised about having a secondary ferment blow excess wort
through the air lock.  Did it ruin the beer?....


I doubt it.  Actually, the times that has happened to me, the beers all came
out quite fine;  sooooo, don't worry, just be more patient before racking and
wait until the activity is slowed way down.


I put all the secondary ferments into a refrigerator to condition and clear.
Usually a week or two is sufficient.

I bought one of these (I think it was Edme and/or Brewcraft, in any case
it had fake wood grain texturing on the sides) in the 3 gallon size.  I
kegged about 5 or 6 batches with it, and had problems on at least 3 of them.
The spigot has a real problem with sticking, and needs to be disassembled
and cleaned EVERY time you use it - it is a funny two part valve.  If you
don't, the upper part sticks and separates from the lower part, and then
strips when you crank down hard enough to stop the drips.  I didn't discover
this until I blew out one valve (and half a keg of beer - I was kept busy
drinking...).  It also helps to lubricate the upper valve pieces and threads
with vegetable oil every time too.   After I figured that out, I had a problem
with the pressure valve -- it is a plastic plunger with an o-ring seal, and the
shaft broke off of the sealing disc.  I discovered this after filling the keg,
and had to quickly wash a case and a half of bottles and bottle instead.
If I had kept using the keg, I would have also wanted to replace the pressure
valve with a weaker spring, to drop the 10 psi down to 5psi for a more
reasonable head (at the cost of more CO2 cylinder use).  10 psi is a little
ridiculous - all you get is foam.  The keg is now in my basement collecting
dust -- if anybody in the Boston area wants it, you can have it for free, but
you'll have to replace the o-ring seal plunger.


I have since spent the relatively big bucks to buy a Cornelius keg.  No 
comparison -- all metal, simple apparatus, serving is easier with a tap
on a hose, and pressure control means that I keep under 10 psi for a good
head, and drop to 5psi for serving at parties.  If it isn't clear by now,
my advice is to avoid the half measures, and do it right.  You won't be
sorry.            Jeff Casey
