Subject: Doric yeast


Hi there!




Okay, between what I've recently read here and read elsewhere, y'all have got 
me convinced that Red Star yeast is a Bad Thing.  Just wish I'd known before 
starting this batch... oh, well-- it's a sweet beer anyway (doppelbock).  Live 
and learn.


So, that being the case:  will anyone comment on Doric, which is the other 
brand of dry yeast I happen to have on hand?  Dave Miller doesn't include 
Doric in his list in _Complete Handbook of Home Brewing_.  Other than that 
it's French, I know nothing of the brand.


(Just for the record:  both these yeasts were the only dry yeasts my local
shop was carrying for sale by the pkg at the time.  This sort of thing is
among the reasons that I'm breaking down and thinking of mail order.) 




                         Yours in Carbonation,


                                      Cher

Subject: Types of sugars and Dave Line






This weekend I started a search to find the mystical ingredients in Dave Line's
book " Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy".  I used an earlier net posting that
made references from Dave's book "Beers and Brew kits"(or something like that)
which described the ingredients a little better (actually a lot better) and I 
am adding the following comments/questions to the ongoing quest.


First, I have read both excerpts from Line's books reguarding invert sugar and
quite frankly I am no closer to discovering what Dave is talking about.  I feel
that what he means is corn sugar and I'll test this and get back with the 
results.


A friend of mine who spent some time in England says that Black Treacle is like
our Blackstrap Molasses(sp).


I went looking for demerara suagr or raw sugar and most people pointed me to
some stuff called Turbinado(sp) sugar. Is this the same or equilalent.


For those of us who strive for perfection, There is a place called the British
Food Centre in California.  I'll send the address and phone tomorrow.  They
have authentic black treacle, demerara and golden syrup.  I didn't see invert
sugar or brown sugar in their catalogue but I plan to ask them.


Then there's the issue of yeast.  For most of the ales I plan on using wyeast
1098 british ale yeast.  I would appreciate comments on the differences between
this and the London ale yeast 1028.  I guess the irish yeast would work for the 
stouts.  Any other suggestions?


As you can tell I'm driven by a force I cannot comprehend to replicate the brews
I have sampled while in England.  I have also received from the British Food 
Centre a selection of bar towels and a set of pint glasses(not the dimpled mugs
but actual strait glasses with the Queen's seal!).  Cheers.

In the June 4th issue, pg 75, an article on homebrewing.


Don't expect much in the way of hardcore information. It's more of a
"factoid"/lifestyle article than anything else.

I've been wondering for a little while now (one of those things
you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask), What makes
a weiss beer what it is? Does anyone have a godd easy recipe? Also,
has anyone tried culturing yeast from the Hacker-Pschorr Weiss
bottles? If so, what was the procedure? Thanks a lot in advance.

Subject: Incidents in two Brewpubs


You know how two people can do exactly the same thing and have two different
experiences?  And one of those people always has very good experiences
while the other doesn't?  Well...Roy and I were simultaneously on business
trips, he to Maryland and I to San Jose (trip report on brewpubs forthcoming).


We would both talk into a brewpub, and since we were on business, we were
both wearing suits.


Roy, for example, walked into Saisson's in Baltimore.  He sat at the bar,
ordered sampler sizes of all their beers.  He then took out a pocket flash
and started to examine their clarity.  Before you could say "Original Gravity"
he had the manager at his side, who proceeded to explain all about their
brewpub, brewing techniques, etc. and they had a marvelous talk.


I, on the other hand, walked into Bison Brewing in Berkeley.  They had
no sampler trays, and only two of their own beers, so I got the Honey-Basil
Ale and the Double Bock.  When asked what the ingredients were, the
bartended pointed to a sign on the wall.  After deciphering the blue on
grey print I find that the Honey-Basil Ale contains honey and basil, and
the bock contains malt and hops.  Now while Roy is being feted by the
manager of Saissons, I hear a voice saying "Are you a writer?"
Looking to my right I see two casually dressed (this was a campus area)
men of middle-eastern extraction.  The name "Salmon-Rushdie" flashes
in my brain, and I quickly exclaim "No, NO!  I'm not a writer, I'm
just an accountant, doing my bills."


There's just no justice.

Uh, sorry to bring this up agin...


I've been looking around and pricing 6gal stainless brewpots, and have
found some decent deals < $80.  However, all of these are ALL
stainless, meaning no aluminum bottom.  I seem to recall that the all
stainless pots have a tendency to scorth.  Can anyone confirm or deny
this?  Is anybody satisfied with their *all* stainless pot?

Subject: Orlando, Fl - Brewpubs?


In looking back through my collection of digests I see that someone else
has asked this question but I see no reply, so I will ask again. Does
anyone know if there are any Brewpubs or microbreweries in the Orlando(Fl)
area? I'll be down there next week for a conference.
  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Culturing yeast question(s)




A few months back, I used my first Wyeast culture (German Ale #1007)
with excellent results.  However, my efforts to culture it turned out
pretty poor: my first ruined batch )-:  Lactobacillus city.


Anyway, thinking that this yeast is real nice, I recently filled a
sterilized bottle with the first cups to come out of the keg.  This
was really yeasty stuff, and now has settled in the bottle, giving me
about 1/2 inch of sediment.  The beer in the keg is great.  Maybe my
cleanest tasting batch ever.


A little film (which I get on about half my beers) has appeared in
recent days on the top of this bottle which I'd like to culture from.
The local brewmaster has identified it (in other beers) as a fungus
which grows on melons, and is extremely difficult to eradicate.
Fortunately, he says it doesn't contribute to the flavor of the beer
at all.


Question #1: Can I prepare a 1.020 wort and make a starter from this 
sediment without worry?


Question #2: This fungus doesn't "hurt" the beer, but it hurts my
perception of it, which is important.  Does anybody have any
experience with all-kitchen sanitation?


I've just picked up another liquid culture, and would like to use it
more than once.  Many folks have mentioned that you can just "reuse
the slurry".  What exactly is meant by this?  Just stir up what you
don't bottle, and use a cup (or so) with some wort to make a starter?
Could I save a cup of my original starter to re-make another one?
A possible advantage to this would be that the yeast never goes though
a full 5 gallon wort, which would limit possibility of infection.


Still Confused about Yeast,

Subject: Irish ale...


I mentioned some time ago that I had sampled the Irish Ale at Sieben's in
Chicago, and loved it.  The other day another endorsement came over the digest.
I have looked everywhere (at my disposal) and can't find a set of brewing or
taste characteristics for the stuff.


Is it a recognized style?  Anyone have any clues as to the specifics of brewing
it?  Recipes?  The brewmaster at Sieben's wasn't very helpful.


Thanks...Gary

Subject: AHA conference


For those who wanted more info about the AHA National conference,
it will be in Oakland, CA starting wednesday evening 6/13 through
saturday evening 6/16.  There will be various techincal and social
events throughout the conference including a dart tournament,
brunch at the Anchor brewery, a California beer tasting, and of course
the quintessential Michael Jackson beer tasting.
There is more complete info in Zymurgy,
or you can call the AHA (I don't have their number handy, but you
can get it through Boulder information.


Well, as promised here is the list of net brewers who will be attending
the AHA national conference:


Dave Scroggins                uunet!dtc.hp.com!daves
Jim Homer                uunet!att!drutx!homer
Stuart Crawford                uunet!ads.com!stuart
Darryl Richman                uunet!cs.utexas.edu!ism780c.isc.com!darryl
David Haberman                habermand`at`afal-edwards.af.mil
Chuck Cox                uunet!bose!chuck


It sounds like there will be more homebrew at this conference than any
previous conference.  Attendence should also be up because there are so
many homebrewers in the area.  All in all it should be a great time.


I will be arriving in SF on monday and am planning on visiting various
breweries & pubs before the conference, I am particularly interested
in visiting the Larkspur Brewing Co across the bay.
And of course, at least one evening at the Toronado (and perhaps across
the street to the Mad Dog in the Fog to toss a few darts).
If any netters will be there early and want to get together for a field trip,
let me know.


BTW: anybody want to go in on a dialysis machine? 
I think I'm gonna need one.


A FINAL QUESTION:
Does anybody know of a Malibu GP or similar race track near Oakland?
I thought it might be amusing to determine who is america's fastest
homebrewer (we already know who the fastest beer judge is 8-)


 - Chuck Cox - america's fastest beer judge -
