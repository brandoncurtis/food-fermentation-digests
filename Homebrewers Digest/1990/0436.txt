Subject: Saving Yeast Slurry


To my understanding, there are two ways to save (expensive liquid) yeast 
for reuse in another batch:


        1.  Freeze the slurry after adding 10 percent food grade
            glycerine.  (which acts as antifreeze?)


        2.  Put the slurry in a bottle with air lock and store in the
            fridge for (up to) a few weeks.


I did both of these.  The slurry in the freezer never did freeze.  It 
even had the audacity to leak out of the freezer container when it was 
moved to make room for a chicken.  The bottle in the fridge tipped over 
and spilled.


I tried another method, but I have been wondering about it's soundness.  
All the talk about re-cultering from the dregs at the bottom of a bottle 
of various famous ales led me think of just bottling the slurry.  I got 
four bottles of trub - two are in the basement, and two are at the back 
of the fridge.


The bottles are (supposedly) sanitary, and they should contain nothing 
but dormant yeast and a little wort.  My intention is to create a 
starter from one of these bottles shortly before brewing.


Can anybody think of any reason this won't work?  Is refridgeration 
necessary?  How long should I expect the dormant yeast to remain viable? 
Come to thinkg of it:  is the goop I bottled really dormant yeast, or is 
it dead stuff that I don't really want to re-culture?


Thanks for any input.

Here is my simple, but effective procedure:


I rack into my 7 gallon plastic primary that has a spigot attached on the
side, near the bottom.  To this I attach a 7" piece of plastic tubing that
I sanitize by boiling.  I place the primary on top of my dishwasher with
the tubing hanging over the edge.  The tubing just reaches the bottom of the
bottle.  The start-stop action of the spigot is a dream. NO MESS!!


I also use this procedure when racking from my primary to my secondary,
but replace the 7" piece with a 3' racking tube.  This eliminates 2 out
of 3 times I have to start a siphon.


Note: To do this, the spigot must be attached above the sludge line on your
      primary.

I suggest using a racking tube. It's made of hard plastic, is
shaped like a cane, and mine has an orange plastic stand-off to
suck from about 3/4" above the bottom of the fermenter (to leave
the trub behind).


Regarding an alternative to bottling (which I hate also), how about
kegging?  That's what I plan to do as soon as I get settled in my
new house.

I have just started using a spigot, and it works great.  I got the spigot
from my local supplier.  I simply drilled a whole in bottom of my plastic
primary fermenter and put the spigot on.  It came with a short length of
hose so that the beer does not get aerated when I bottle it.  However, I
can attach a long hose to it for transfering from primary to secondary.

Not to worry, Ken, mixing chlorine bleach with hot water won't result
in any dangerous chemical reactions and blow up your brewing room.
On the other hand, using hot water *will* increase the concentration of
chlorine in the atmosphere near your santizing solution and that *can*
be a definite health hazard.  One should always use chlorine bleach in a
well-ventilated area; chlorine does nasty things to your lungs.  


At the risk of boring some folks, here's a little more detail about
what's going on.  Chlorine bleach is a solution of sodium hypochlorite
(the formula's irrelevant), which when mixed with water reacts to form
a small amount of sodium hydroxide (lye) and chlorine dissolved in water.
Because chlorine is a gas at room temp., it tends to evaporate from the
water, giving the characteristic smell of bleach.  Heating the water will 
push the equilibrium towards chlorine gas, hence stronger smell.  So be
careful out there in those stuffy kitchens and tiny, closeted brewing
rooms!!  If you must pass out, do it from too many homebrews, not from
snorting chlorine.

Subject: cheap keg, vanilla beans and steeping grains


        Various people have posted that they have found a
cheap source of kegs by buying them from soda distributors. I
called every soda distributor in San Diego county and couldn't
find one willing to part with a keg.


        If you have such a source, and want to make a couple
bucks, email me and let me know how many of what type you can 
get at what price. If you're on the same continent I am, I 
will pay shipping costs and throw in a finder's fee (or make 
you a case of brew, but you'll have to take it in bottles!).


        If you have a cheap source of 2-3 gal kegs, the above
goes double!


        A footnote: "cheap" is defined as being significantly
cheaper than what I have to pay here. A new five gal keg is
~$60, three gal ~$55. I can get used five gals for $45 from
the local homebrew shop, but they usually take ~$5 in new
gaskets, so it's not worth the trouble. $10 kegs would make me
a happy brewer!


        On the subject of vanilla beans--when cooking with
vanilla, the later you add it the stronger the taste. Either
aromatics get driven off by heat, or the stuff breaks down, or
something. Commercial vanilla extract is ~30% alcohol; maybe
the flavors are extracted with it rather than heat.


        Probably the best way to get the flavor into your beer
is to add extract to it right before bottling. You can
determine the proper amount by adding some to a known volume
of un-vanilla'd brew to taste, and scaling up.


        On steeping grains--lately I've given up on using my
grain bags. They're too small, and when the grain swells, the
extraction efficiency decreases as kernals pack together, like
too much tea in a tea strainer. I now make a poridge in a small 
pot, filter into my brew kettle, and sparge with boiling mater. 
Seems to work a lot better.

A lot of people have read what they wanted to read into my original

1) Beer judging is and will remain pretty subjective no matter how
well trained the judge (I have seen this first hand at many competitions)
Therefore individual judges scores and notes only make sense if you
know the judges tastes


2) I never said anything about brewpub discussions.

Fred, do you have some other container for sanitizing other equipment (siphon
hoses, bottles, etc.)?  If so, you can use it for sanitizing your lid.  One side
of a double sink works well also.


The trouble with using sterilant soaked towels is that a bleach solution should
remain in contact with the surface for 15-30 min. to be effective.  Given the
shape of a fermenter lid, keeping the towels in contact with all the critical
surfaces could be a real problem.  A better way to go is to thoroughly swab all
the important areas with a mixture of 70% Everclear with water.  This works
much faster than the chlorine bleach and so just thoroughly wiping it down is
sufficient.  It also evaporates much faster and you don't have to worry about
chlorine tastes in your beer.


I have successfully removed scratches from hard food grade plastic (racking
tube) using successively finer grades of sandpaper - essentially the same
process as in wood finishing.  I don't know how this would work with the softer
plastic used in fermenters.  You might try it on the outside first to see if it
works.

I make a "tea" out of the grains by adding boiling water to them and steeping
for 20-30 min.  I then strain this into the brewpot and sparge.  Some small
particles will get through the strainer but not enough to cause problems.

Paul; first get a racking tube from your local homebrewing supplier (~$2-3).
This is a J shaped piece of food grade plastic tubing.  On the long side of the
J is a plastic piece that hold the end of the tube off the floor of your
fermenter or pail or whatever so that sediments are left behind.  Your flexible
hose attaches to the short side of the J.  You can also purchase a clip for the
racking tube (~$1-1.50) which will keep it relatively steady in the pail and at
a constant depth if you want it higher than the afore mentioned plastic will
provide.  This will eliminate your problems with the hose slithering out of the
pail.


I also use a spring loaded bottle filler tube.  I just timed it and it takes 13
seconds to fill a 12 oz. bottle.  Once beer is flowing into the bottle I have
~12 seconds of holding the tube in place that does not require any attention.
I use this time to move the last bottle over to the capping area and getting
the next empty one and draining the remaining rinse water out.  This leaves me
with about 2 seconds/bottle that aren't spent on something else that I would
have to do anyway.  The way I figure it, the overhead of filling a bottle is
just 2-3 seconds as opposed to the 5-10 seconds using just the hose and
clamping it and I don't make a mess of the floor.  I agree that I'd like to
find a still better method (kegging flames > /dev/null) but I certainly think
that the filler tube is better than the straight hose.

Specialty grains introduce tannins which will react with proteins in the malt
to cause haze.  Any basic brewing book will describe several additives
(including Irish Moss) that will remove either tannins or proteins to reduce
haze.  (c.f. TCJoHB, pp.95-97).

A secondary fermenter with a tap on the side near the the bottom
solves the problem of the syphon tube falling out of the fermenter.
You don't have to start a syphon with your mouth, and with everything
secure, you can put your primary well above the level of your filling
operation.


I got my fermenter from the Williams Brewing mail order catalog.  The
plastic spigot mechanism can be removed and cleaned as necessary,
reattaches easily and doesn't leak if tightened properly.  Standard
size plastic siphoning hose attaches to the spigot.  Using the spigot
with a short plastic tube wasn't very satisfactory (but was fast) so I
use the same type of spring loaded filler tube you do, at the other
end of a long hose.  Using the filler tube stops most filling
overruns, and although it is a bit slow, if it were faster, I would
overrun more, so its a compromise.  My main complaint with the spring
loaded filler tube is that bottles have a convex bottom on the inside
and the filler tube often slips over toward the side of the bottle
where the activator button at the end of the tube gets released,
interrupting the fill.  I set bottles in a plastic dishwashing basin
while filling to catch the rest of the sloshes.

Subject: Dry Hop vs Kettle Hop


On Friday, Russ Gelinas recommended steeping hops for 1-3 minutes to get
good hop flavor and aroma and that because of his success with this method
he cannot imagine the need for dry hopping.


I kind of agree.  I like hops a lot, and I have always wanted to try dry-
hopping, but I get good success using his technique, and I haven't yet
gone to the trouble of dry-hopping a batch.


I do have a suspicion about the need for dry-hopping which I would like
to share with the Readership, but it is only a suspicion.  


I suspect that large commercial brewers simply cannot steep hops for 1-3
minutes, so to get the flavor and aroma we get that way, they must dry-hop
instead.  Remember that we empty our kettles pretty quick (they only hold
5 or 10 gallons), and a large kettle (many barrels) empties much slower, maybe
more than an hour.  That means their hops are steeping not for 1-3 minutes,
but for over an hour, or way over an hour, and that means they are
contributing to bitterness more than aroma and flavor.


This brings up a slightly picky point about the 1-3 minute steep.  I
haven't seen Russ brew, so I don't know what he does, but my "1-3 minute
steep" is misleading.  What I really do is turn off the flame, throw in the
hops, wait 2 minutes, and start siphoning the wort through the chiller.
That process takes about a half-hour.  So how long are the hops steeping
really?  Some of the wort has the hops in it for only 2 minutes
(that's the first wort through the chiller), but some of the wort has
the hops steeping for a half-hour (the last wort through the chiller).
The rest is obviously somewhere inbetween.  So is this a two-minute
steep, a half-hour steep, or a fifteen-minute steep, or what?


But back to the subject.  The local brewpub empties their 200-gallon kettle
in over an hour.  Obviously they cannot steep hops for 1-3 minutes under
those conditions.  And if we assume for the sake of the argument that
to get good hop aroma and flavor, you must steep hops for up to half an
hour, they cannot do that either.  


In summary, I suspect that dry-hopping may not be the best way to get good
hop flavor and aroma;  maybe it is the only the second best way, but 
large breweries are forced to take that route because the best way is not
available to them simply because of how long it takes to strike the kettle.


I want to stress here that I haven't compared the two methods and found
one superior.  In fact I have never tried one of the methods.  I have
merely noticed that one of the methods is not available to large brewers,
and therefore, they, too, have not compared the two methods and found
one superior.


Only we tiny brewers can compare them.  Has anyone done this?

last 5-10 minutes of boil. I don't know if it's a factor or not, but I also skim
off the scum that forms on the surface of the boiling wort when the Irish moss is
added.


Thanks to all who responded to my query on a pale ale ginger brew. I'll ease up on
the crystal, and cook it this weekend, if the temp gets under 100. Why exactly did
I move to Sacramento???


Now for the silly question of the week. Anyone got a clue as to why I got beer with
good carbonation, but no head retention at all? It's like, if I pour out the beer
with extra effort to produce splash and head, I get a *really* huge head on it, but in
five minutes, it looks like there's no carbonation at all. There is, though. Agitation
brings up a head again. It's as if the CO2 is there, but is unwilling to come out of
solution at ambient pressure. I don't think it's a detergent residue issue, since I
used to get a nice head on my beer, and I haven't changed any of my routines lately.
Oh well, it still tastes just like beer to me...

Re Max Newman's Irish Moss haze question, I realized that I forgot to mention
that the cloudiness I experienced was a true chillhaze. The beer was quite clear
when warm, and turned hazy when chilled. That's what the Irish moss seemed to help
with. If your beer's never clearing in the bottle, even before you chill it, I 
don't think moss will help. Maybe the grain got milled a little too fine or something.
If it tastes like beer, I'd advise you to drink it. If it doesn't taste like beer
I'd advise you to drink some other beer. If you can't tell whether or not it tastes
like beer, you've probably had enough.


I'd like to add my kudos to Algis Korzonas for his posting on getting started. I
sent a private message to the person looking for elementary advice, but mine was
nowhere near as complete, thorough, accurate, or well-written as Algis' submission.
Way to go, dude! Sure hope it didn't cost Jay H too many precious compuserve seconds
as it paged past his screen.

   I worked two summers as a lifeguard at pools which used a concentrated
sodium hypochlorite (=bleach) solution, dripped into the return from the
filter, as a chlorine source. We were taught that (aside from the effects of
more people in the pool) a warm day would require a higher drip rate than a
cool day because the heat (and UV?) drove off the chlorine at a higher rate.
   Virtually all gasses are less soluble in a warm liquid than in the same
liquid when cool. I don't know that you'll get a bad side-reaction from warm
dilute bleach, but I doubt it will be as effective a cleaner unless you use
it \immediately/ because the chlorine will ]evaporate[. (What you're left with
is probably a weak caustic, which would be less bactericidal than chlorine and
just as likely to disflavor your beer if you don't clean it out.)

Huh? I was reading Miller last night and recall a suggestion for 1/8" holes
on 1/4" centers. Note however that he also recommends double-filtering---
putting the first few gallons back through the mash after it has settled
into a solid bed, in order to get out more of the fine stuff.

I agree with you, but I want to offer an alternative solution. If you are on a
DEC VAX you can extract the digest via Kermit, FTP, ect. to your PC and upload
it as a text file into, say, WordPerfect and read it at your leisure. This
saves connect time, as downloading is much faster than reading on-line, and
allows you to free up VAX account space because you can delete it after you
download it. It requires you to have (1) a VMS account where you receive the
Digest (or comparable system), (2) a PC, etc. to read it from that you have
free access to, and (3) and word processor/text editor (preferrably screen
editor or WP). Also, you can simply print out the digest from your account and
not bother with downloading. (Makes it a pain to re-write in something you
want to respond to, though...)
