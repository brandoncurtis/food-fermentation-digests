Subject: What do people think of this idea?


Hi there!




As we _all_ know, I've been putting a great deal of time and effort recently 
into brewing up a framboise.


Now:  one of the classic characteristics of this and other Belgian lambics is 
the presence of a _Lactobacillus_ flavor, which under other circumstances 
would be considered an off flavor/contaminant.  Thus, in attempting to 
duplicate/imitate a lambic, one is in the unusual position of needing to 
somehow introduce a normally undesirable element into the wort, if one can 
manage it.


While not particularly concerned with actually accomplishing this, I've 
nonetheless been pondering whether or not it *could* be done.


I think I may have thought of a way.  I'm wondering what people will think of 
it.


These days, almost any grocery store will carry milk inoculated with live 
_Lactobacillus acidophilus_.  It's very popular.  So:  what if one pitched an 
ounce or two of _L. acidophilus_ milk out of a *freshly opened* quart into the 
wort, along with the yeast to be used?  I figure the milk is pasteurized 
before the inoculation, so a freshly opened quart could provide the bacterial 
culture without fear of comtamination.


How might this work?  Would it compete unfavorably with the yeast?  Produce 
too much _Lactobacillus_ flavor?  How might it affect the finished beer?


What do y'all think?




                         Yours in Carbonation,


                                      Cher

For those of us that are equipment freaks, Edmund Scientific sells
a neat little gizmo that can be used to start siphons.  It's a
hand operated vacuum pump; with it, a few feet of extra siphon hose,
and a T connection (so you can connect in the vacuum line close to
the output end of your siphon), you can prime your transfer line the
same way the big guys do it.  The pump costs about $30.00, if I
remember correctly, and the T connection is another dollar or so. The
pump is plastic and can be disassembled for cleaning if (when) you
pump a little too enthusiastically and slurp some wort up into the pump.
Now, if I can just figure out how to rig an RS232-readable pressure
gauge and a computer-controlled mechanical hand to work the pump...

After initial fermentation of our ale, we typically siphon the liquid
into another clean container which has a spigot installed low on it's
side.  The sugar is stirred in and the container is placed on a table
with the spigot hanging over.  Three feet of Tygon tubing is attached
to the spigot and then the 'spring-loaded' filler goes on the end. With
the bottles arranged on the floor for easy access, filling is done pretty
easily.  Pressure is strong enough to cause some foaming in the bottles
but this can be regulated by adjusting the spigot. The only drawback
is: some bending is required, but since we're only dealing with 2 cases
(plus we're always eager to get the beer into those bottles anyway)
(plus we're still pretty young :-) ) it hasn't posed much of a problem.
Our latest batch was the fool-proof Weizen, which turned out excellent.

Subject: Recipes for cherry beer?




Greetings!!


I don't know about the rest of the country (or world?) but in Utah, the 
cherries are ripe!  I'm just dying to make a cherry-flavored beer.  There 
are two recipes in TCJOHB, but I'd be interested in hearing about other 
recipes.  I'd really appreciate it if you'd send me any extract-based 
recipes you've tried with comments on how the beer turned out.  The 
cherries are going to have to be picked within the next couple of days, so 
I'm looking forward to brewing this one next week.


        Thanks for your input.

B Dalton's has Michael Jackson's book, "The new world guide to Beers"
(I think thats the title) the hardbound edition on sale for about $18
in the Denver area (and I assume maybe nationwide).  If you don't
already have it, it's a great time to get it.  It's a MUST for you
serious beer lovers.  John Bates  (We do have vacancies at the Motel)

Subject: Re:  Siphoning


I thought I'd add my bit to this!


The main difficulty I have with the suggested solutions is that a
fair amount of handling the siphon tube is required, both to fill it
with water and to stick it into the beer. And (horrors!) while 
putting it into the beer, I might inadvertently stick my hand in too.
Further, I use a racking tube, and filling that with water as well has
proved impossible. So, my solution was to cut about an inch off the
racking tube. Then I insert the racking tube into the beer, attach
the siphon hose, and then attach the small piece. I can start the flow
by sucking on the small piece, which I them remove before the beer
reaches it. Voila, a flowing siphon with minimised germs!


I too use a spring loaded bottling tube. I stand the carboy on the
work surface (waist level), start the siphon, and fill the bottles
on the floor. Lots o' flow! The only problem is the amount of foam
generated before the beer in the bottles covers the end of the tube.


One thing I've noticed with siphoning is that the seals between the
flexible and rigid tubing are not perfect. I can hear air hissing
into the assembly. I wonder if this could cause problems?

The system is available for a couple dollars from Wine and Brew By You
(305) 666-5757 and consists of a float, a weight, tubing, line, and
instructions.  I have found it to be extremely reliable, and in their
store it gets heavy heavy use in the kegs at their samples taps.


By the way, In Miami? Be sure to stop by Wine and Brew By You 5760 Bird
Road in South Miami, and talk to Craig, Sandy, Dale, and sometimes, if
you're very very lucky, you'll meet me there! Samples of beers and wines
always available, and they have the largest selection of malts, yeasts,
and hops anywhere.

Ye Olde Hand Siphon.


The filled hose siphon approach seems like a very logical approach, however a
friend (J.G.) recommended a very simple method of starting a siphon.  Use your
clean, sterile, tightly coiled hand to act as a spacer between the siphon tube
and your mouth.  Simply clamp the tube with one end of your hand and suck on
the other.


Ideally, you should start the flow in one draw.  You certainly do not want any
backflow of brew or air into the siphon tube.
