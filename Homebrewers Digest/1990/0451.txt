Subject: Auto Mash




In the latest issue of Zymurgy I saw an ad for Auto Mash.  It's a
programmable mashing device that uses a heated water jacket for maintaining
temp. (to avoid scourching).  You simply program what temp and how long for
each of up to three temp. rests and start it up.  It will even stir the
mash if you want.  It didn't give a price so I assume it's expensive.


Does anyone know anything about this gadget?  It sounds like a great idea.
I could start the mash in the morning, come back later that day, sparge and
boil.  It sounds good in theory but I hate to buy it and find out it
doesn't work very well.  If anyone has any more info. on this device,
please let me know.

Subject: A possible cheap brew kettle?




I was out in the Bay area last week, and got to try some of the
fabulous microbrews there - great!  Anyway, a friend there suggested a
cheap source for stainless steel brew kettles.  I thought that I'd
toss it out here for discussion/suggestions/etc.


Apparently (though we're not certain) Budweiser kegs are made out of
stainless steel.  For the price of the beer + the $15 (or so) deposit,
one could cut the top off of the keg and use it as a kettle.  It even
has nice handles at the top.  If I'm not mistaken, a quarter keg is in
the order of 7.5 gallons.  Cutting and smoothing the top of the keg
could be a bit of a hassle, but nothing that a few minutes with an
oxi-acetylene torch couldn't cure.


So, the main question is - are Bud kegs actually stainless?  If not,
are there any other kegs that are, and could be used as kettles?  Has
anyone tried this with or without success?  Ideas?  If it works, it
could be a great source for big and cheap stainless kettles.  Thanks
for the idea, Dave!


Of course, you'd have to find something to do with all of that
Bud...


Cheers,

Subject: Subjectivity, AHA Competition Revisited


Hi there,
 Sorry to take so long to repsond to John Melby's and others comments
 regarding censorship, and subjectivity, but it's amazing how a silly
little thing like a broken leg will slow you down, the bright side is
that from now on I'll have enough metal to set off airport detectors
everywhere I go.


Regarding censorship, those who know me know that I am not an 
advocate of censorship of any sort, just courtesy and occasionally
self-restraint. This leads up to John M's interpretation of my 
remarks. I thjink John missed the central point. It is not so much 
a matter of subjectivity (I like this, I don't like this, ..) as
much as perceptual ability. The tqwo major points being
1) Individuals have drastically varying abilities to detect flavor
characteristics. While perception training can enhance these abilities
as far as strengthening recall and identifiaction, you just can't
overcome what flavors and thresholds your body is physically limited
to.


2) The other major point was that John does point out that judging in 
style is important, yet I would like to add that I have seen it written 
that there are as many beer styles as there are brewers (ie there is
substantial variability, thus room for subjectivity, even in a well
defined style).


All of my experience judging at many competitions, with many people,
and helping to train people leaves me convinced that unless I really
have a feel for a persons flavor perception capabilities and personal
tastes their opinion on a beer and even their scores on it (see Chuck
Cox's comment on the AHA National competition in recent digest) can
be anywhgere from meaningless to totally useless.


Regardiung Chuck's comments, I see he put a plug in for a the futility
of the current judging system and for Regional eliminations. For those
of you who are more recent to this digest 1-1/2 to 2 years ago one of
the first real long ongoing discussions I particpated in was a suggestion
I made (surprised??) that the AHA competition was useless and that a
tiered competition consisting of local, regional and National 
levels be discussed. I put forth what was a rather half-baked idea
on how to pull this off with the active intent of solciting discussion
and input. It is my belief that the creation of the "bye" system 
where a beer which wins at a local or regional competition can go
right on to the second round at the Nationals was a result of this and
other related discussions. I would like to suggest that perhaps it is time
to re-visit this issue, maybe we can generate some good practical 
ideas and convince someone from the AHA who may be listening that
the current systerms still has serious flaws.

P.S. Seems a lot of people are posting requests to be removed from 
this digest, are these just casual passing readers. Seems to me the
dedicated readership has been growing here, but I wonder if Rob G.
can post some stats??

Subject: Spruce Beer


Ah! the smell of fresh leaf Nugget hops happily bubbling away! It has been a
LONG time since I brewed, and finally decided I wanted a "summer beer" so
even as we speak, the Nut Brown Ale I have in mind is starting...


When I was picking up this latest batch of supplies, I noticed (and of course
had to buy!) a tiny little bottle of "Spruce Essence". It smells really
good, but I cannot imagine the character it might add to the beer, never
having had a "spruce beer".


As usual, the people at the Cellar (home beer and wine shop here in the
Seattle area) were not very informative. I wasn't really expecting them to
haul a bottle out for me to try, but I have to admit, I did expect more
than, "well some people like it, some don't". My only homebrewing book ("The
Complete Handbook of Home Brewing") doesn't mention it. I wish the Cellar
people had been been able to characterize it in some way. If anyone here
ever used it, I'm interested in the answers to a few questions:


When is it added? I suspect at bottling time would be fine. Does the beer
pick up the soft, semi-sweet medicinal tones that are so predominant in the
smell of the essence? Or does something else happen when it mixes with malt
and hops flavors? What style of beer is best suited to the use of Spruce
Essence? Is there a commercial beer representative of the style that I can
obtain here in Seattle?


For those who have never seen it, mine is in a small plastic bottle that
looked for the world like nose drops, and the only information on the label
(besides the maker: Leigh-Williams and Sons of TATTENHALL, Nr. CHESTER) is
that the 1/2 fl oz bottle is "Sufficient for eight gallons of spruce beer."


Who's used it?

Subject: Oatmeal stout...


    I am trying to develop a sense for the different styles of brews - ales
    and heavier.  In the past, I have tasted Guinness stout a couple of
    times, and found it much too astringent for me.  Even porters seem too
    far to that side of the spectrum.  I have never tasted what I knew to
    be a brown ale.
    
    I was at a wedding this weekend in Maryland, and they had some bottles
    of an oatmeal stout.  I was persuaded to try it, and it was very good. 
    My sense is that it wasn't as astringent as the porters I have tried,
    and certainly nowhere near the stout.  It was a very dark brown, and
    the best description I can make is that it is a VERY heavy ale.  Struck
    me as not to hoppy either.
    
    Can anyone enlighten me further on this phenomenon known as oatmeal
    stout.
    
    Thanks...Gary


    P.S. The stout was Samuael Smith (Tadcaster).  Charlie says there is only
         one brewed commercially, so that may be it.
