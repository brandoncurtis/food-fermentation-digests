I suspect their casualness is in many cases involuntary.  It's the
end of the quarter, so many who make their living as software
paladins are off in search of a new job (and mailfeed), and the
academic world is also draining.  Most of them will be back, from new
locations, soon -- HBD is addictive!

Howdy!


    I've been getting the digest for about the last month, and thought I
would voice a question or two to the folks out there "in the know".


    I get an ugly brown residue along the wort/air boundary during my
initial fermentation.  I have been assuming that this is yeast, or some
other related (read non-nasty) product of the fermentation process.  BUT,
with all of the sanitation articles floating around, I have begun to
worry.  I take very intricate precautions with sanitation, and would hate
to think I have been allowing mold or other critters into my beer for the
past two years  ;)


    My second question has to do with spreading the Homebrew Digest around.
I have given it away to friends, and the folks at the local homebrew supply
shop (Beer and Wine Crafts in El Cajon, CA).  Does anyone mind?  I would
like to take some copies to the next QUAFF (QUality Ale and Fermentation
Fraternity) meeting.  I just joined, and found that I had something to
contribute (if allowed) to a crowd a bit more experienced than I.

The reason that you wouldn't want to ferment
in your kettle is that if you get good hot and cold breaks, you will
have a fair amount of trub.  You would want to get the brew off the
trub before fermenting.

I initially thought this wouldn't work because you couldn't fit the
spiral tubing through the hole, but if you did a downward spiral
and then doubled the piping back up the same spiral, maybe you could
"screw" the chiller into the hole.  Also, the cost of stainless would
probably be prohibitive -- I suggest copper tubing.  In any case, getting
the wort off the trub would make this setup unpractical.

I've seen several references to Miller's book and was shocked.  I
don't know if he's been misquoted or Miller himself is misguided.
I don't have his book (maybe I should get it and see for myself.
Here's a perfect example.  I can tell you without a doubt that
when the wort is below 180 degrees F, contamination should be your
primary problem.  Don't worry, just be careful to not allow airborne
nasties or nasties living in your wooden spoon, on your hands, in your
mouth, etc. touch your beer.  I believe that Miller may have said
that since the wort is below 80 degrees F, that OXIDATION is not
a problem.  Big difference.  Relax, don't worry, be sanitary.

I'll be in San Diego a couple of days next week, and, of course,
it would be great to know about the best local pubs!  Please
drop me an email-line with your recommendations, I leave Saturday!

Subject: Pitching yeast...


It seems like a minor point, but I have never seen it mentioned:


If one wishes to aerate the wort when pitching yeast, and have it mixed well
too, wouldn't the ideal method be to pour the starter into the fermenter first,
then rack the wort in on top of it in a splashy manner?


Thanks...Gary


P.S. I wish I'd heard (or thought) about kegs before I went out and bought
     my SS brewpot 8'(.

  Assuming you thought (and I thought) that you were paraphrasing Miller's 
book "The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing": Wow; This sets some kind of
record for distortion. Hopefuly Miller wouldn't mind the following quote
from page 149 to clear this up and head off misfortune:
  "At this point you have two choices, depending on how cold your wort is. If it
is down to fermentation temperature (48 to 55F for lagers, 60 to 65F for ales)
you should pitch your yeast immediately. If you have got the wort down to near
the freezing point, you can pitch the following morning, after the wort has
come up to fermentation temperature. Either way, close the fermenter and move
it to your fermentation area. The wort should be racked off into a second
fermenter about 8 to 12 hours later, to separate it from most of the hot and
cold break material which will settle at the bottom of the vessel. Also 
remember that, before pitching, the wort must be thoroughly aerated."

  Why not? While the break is settling the yeast have gone into suspension in
the wort. It is not hiding out in the break, so racking the wort after letting
the break settle is not going to somehow leave the yeast behind.

  I doubt it but it sure won't hurt the beer if properly used.

  The combination of a good yeast and (especially) lower fermentation 
temperatures should help.
