Subject: Oatmeal


Hi there!




All of the recent discussion about oatmeal stouts (particularly Sam. Smiths)
has had me thinking about something, and I decided to see what you lot had to
say. 


In cooking, when one is preparing British recipes calling for oatmeal, one 
goes out and buys British oatmeal.  The reason for this is that British 
oatmeal is prepared and cut entirely differently from American oatmeal (i.e., 
Quaker Oats).  If one used American oatmeal, chances are the recipe wouldn't 
turn out very well.


Why shouldn't the same hold true for brewing?  After all, ingredient 
processing/preparation is important in brewing too.


That this might be a valid point occurred to me when I received  and read
Chris Shenton's oatmeal recipe digest. On reading the recipes, I realized that
I was automatically planning to go to a local store that carries British 
oatmeal, and buy and use that.  Based on my cooking experience, I was 
automatically assuming that the type of oatmeal would make a significant 
difference.


While I still plan to buy and use British oatmeal whenever I get around to 
making the stout (right now my framboise is still making me crazy; that's 
enough for the time being :-), I was wondering what others' reactions to this 
idea might be.


So:  what do y'all think?

        Subject: Spruce Essence
        
        PS.  Does anybody else out there like the taste (or ever had) Xingu
        Black Beer from Brazil?
        
I have had it and I like it.  It reminds me a little of the smokey
flavor of the steinbier (sp?) available from Europe - the one where
the brew is heated by dropping red hot stones into the mash to heat
it up.  I think that Xingu has a very nice flavor and look - a dark,
black, smokey lager.  Yes, lager, even tho it looks like a great stout.


The following I had posted to rec.food.drink some time ago, and
is lifted from an article in All About Beer about 2 years ago:


Xingu - pronounced 'SHIN goo' comes from the Caccador Brewery,
State of Santa Catarina, Brazil (~600 miles southwest of Rio). 
It is an Indian recipe converted to a brew of barley, water,
hops, and yeast.  The grain is roasted by open fire malting. 
It is a black, dense, opaque, LAGER beer.  It is brewed on site,
using Brazilian hops and barley.  The brew was developed by
Alan D. Eames.  Brazil used to brew quite a few great 'black' or
'escura' lagers.  Unfortunately, these have been discontinued in
favor of lager production by the majors (Brahma, Kaiser, and
Antartica).  The Indian tribes along the Xingu river and it's
tributaries (Amazon area) still brew these beers. Their
process is basically malted grains, lupine herbs, and airborne
yeasts - with the women chewing the grain and spitting the mash
into pots, the resulting 'mash' being cooked over open fires
and giving the beer it's 'blackness' from the smoke - and lagered
in underground clay pots.


Eames took their recipe and converted it to a commercial process. 
The resulting brew pours and looks like a stout but tastes like
a lager.  It is BLACK.  It has ~4 % alcohol by volume.


It is distributed by Caparra Sales Co., Randolph, MA
(617) 986-2337.  Maine artist Eric Green painted the Xingu
label, based on antique maps of the Xingu river region and
included a Txukahamei warrior with a lip disk.


It is available in NYCity in the SoHo area - a deli on
the east side of Broadway, about three blocks north of
Houston Street has it.  Also in Boston, at Ballards package
stores...

Subject: Ginger Beer, kegs, and lauter tun


1) Ken Weiss' ginger ale problem


Since I was a kid I used to make regular ginger ale (sweet, little alcohol).
It involved peeling and slicing a few ounces of ginger.  Now, peeling ginger
is a pain, so I made one batch without peeling it.  The overnight fermentation
in the pot went fine, producing the appropriate amount of bubbles.  However,
after I bottled it, no more fermentation occurred, and the ginger ale was
flat.  I speculated that there was something in the peel of ginger which yeast
marginally disliked.  The ginger had been boiled, so organisms in the peel
were not to blame.  Since then I have always carefully peeled the ginger
first and have had no problems.


I haven't tested this under controlled conditions, so it may be all wet.


2) Stainless steel kegs


I, too, am interested in finding small stainless kegs for use as kettles.
I don't want to use aluminum for the simple reason that I want to hang some
dohickeys off of the kettle, and unless you have a heliarc setup (which I
don't) aluminum is a pain.  So, I would be interested in anybody's experience
of which brands of kegs are aluminum and which (if any) are stainless.


3) Lauter tun


I have improvised a great lauter tun, which others might find useful.  It's
a Coleman 2-gallon cooler with a spigot at the bottom, and a stainless steel
vegetable steamer at the bottom.  This arrangement allows the sparging of the
mash of about 7 pounds of grain.  If the grain is properly crushed, no bag
is needed.  The flow rate is quite satisfyingly slow.  The cooler is insulated,
so the temperature of the water stays at the right level.  The spigot can be
wedged open with a fork handle, allowing relatively unattended sparging.
Also, the Coleman is comparatively inexpensive.


I sparged some mash a couple of weeks ago with this arrangement and got quite
an efficient sparge.  I didn't use a flushing tube but just filled the bottom
with hot water before adding the mash, as Noonan suggests.  Only a small amount
of the initial runoff needed to be run through the mash again.  Unfortunately,
I later had an accident which involved boiling wort and my foot.  Though my
foot has, for the most part, regenerated, the wort is forever lost, so I will
not know how effective it was in the long run.  When I can figure out a safer
arrangement, I will try again.

Subject:  Bud Kegs & Magnets


Hi All,
        Many stainless steel alloys have little to no magnetic
susceptibility and Bud kegs could be produced from one of these.
My first impression is that if the kegs are indeed aluminum they would need
to have a special internal coating to avoid a severe dissolution of Al in the
carbonated and low pH brew. Is there a lining? If there isn't one I would think
that the keg is indeed stainless steel. If there is one it is possibly Al and
if you didn't want to use it for wort boiling it would still make a SUPER
lobster or steamed clam pot 8-).

Some Bud kegs may be made out of aluminium. The one I have is
stainless, *and* be advised that magnets will not stick to many alloys
of stainless steel. If I were you, I'd have someone else look at your
keg to be sure.

My  own personal experience with Edme (ale -- I don't think they even
make a lager yeast) is that is only so - so. I thought it generated a
kind of off flavor that might be described as slightly rancid. Lots of
other people seem satisfied with it, however.

I've had a very similar experience with my second batch of beer, in
which 9 out of every 10 bottles were uncarbonated and showed signs
of infection.  The remaining 1 bottle was perfect!  Upon inspecting
the bottlecaps that I was using, it was clear that these cork lined
caps tend to dry out and crack, allowing the carbonation to escape
and infection to enter.  Check the bottlecaps that you are using
because they can certainly cause problems like this.  I would tend
to suspect your bottling equipment rather than a simple infection,
especially since there was no sign of infection immediately prior
to bottling.
                        Hope this helps!

Subject: When to pitch starter




Dale Veeneman asked about the correct timing for pitching a starter into
the wort. According to my impeccable source - the label on a package
of Wyeast liquid yeast - the starter should be pitched when it reaches
"high kraeusen". I've been interperting this to mean when you've got a nice
layer of foam on top. Works for me, as I get lots of activity in my
wort within 12 hours of pitching the starter.


I've been opening one bottle of the cursed Ginger Pale Ale each day. Yesterday's
bottle actually had a small trace of carbonation. Could the gelatin finings
slow fermentation down that much? I'm now 14 days since bottling. The beer
is still *crystal* clear, but basically uncarbonated.


I had a thought on a blow-off system I'd like to bounce off the group. I've
noticed in my tours of microbreweries that their blow-off system is simply
a tube that comes out the top of the fermentor, and bends 90 degrees, extends
out past the side of the vessel, and turns 90 degrees down. The tube simply
dangles there about three feet off the floor, and a bucket is placed below to
catch the blow-off. What I'm thinking about is the exact same system, but
scaled down to 5 gallon carboy size, and using pyrex lab tubing instead of
stainless. That way I could just immerse the tube in bleach solution to
clean it, and boil it if things got really nasty. Reactions?

Subject: Follow up on Bud kegs




I must admit that I am the one that started Ken on a search for Bud
Kegs.  I purchased a book from the person who started Buffallo Bill's
a local Brew Pub here in the Bay Area.  In this book he claims that
Bud Kegs are Stainless Steel and make great brew pots.  Well I think
he's mistaken as well. 


Ken writes:
    Hmmm.  Looked a bit like aluminum to me.  I figured no problem, if
    it's not what I want, I'll just return it for the deposit (before
    cutting it apart...).  Got home, and it didn't pass the refrigerator
    magnet test (magnets stick to steel, dontchaknow).  Bud kegs are made
    out of aluminum.  :-(


Yes, I purchased a Keg a few weeks ago, but I just got time to test
out my Keg this weekend.  It seems like aluminum to me too.  I tried
the magnet test: it sticks to my 4 1/2 gallon stainless stell pot, but
not to the keg.  Since Bud sells beer in aluminum cans, I am sure they
would have no hesitation to sell a keg of beer in aluminum.


Since I want a 15 gallon pot, and a 15 gallon stainless steel pot is
way out of my price range (try $250-$350), I might still consider
using it.  Now, I don't want to start a holy way either, but since I
haven't following this debate, can somebody from each camp, Stainless
Steel and Aluminum reprise your best arguments *briefly*.

Subject: XINGU






I have tried Xingu black beer a number of times.  
It is very mild and like a milk-stout without as 
much residual sweetness.  Very nice beer. 


To confirms doug's statement about Indian Spit as part
of the Xingu recipe:


About a year ago the San Francisco Chronicle ran an
article about the fellow that brought Xingu from
the Amazon. I can't remember his name, but I'll look
in my files and see if I can find the article. 
Well,  the article said that the original recipe did
include a process where the women of the tribe that
brewed Xingu actually chewed the  barley and then spit it 
into the mash.  I think this added pepsin (??) or some 
enzyme that acted like amalyse and broke down starches 
into sugars.  


The article finished by qualifying the above statements
saying the brewery in the Amazon today uses more "modern"
methods. So I think it is safe to say the tribal spitting
no longer takes place and Xingu uses more Imperial practices.

Subject: Hard Water and Fermentation Startup


    
    Most of my previous batches made with Wyeast have gotten a fairly
active fermentation going within 12 hours of pitching.  My most recent
batch, however, has been a real slow starter with very little CO2 even
36 hours after pitching.  The temperature of the wort has been about
the same and the original gravities have been in the same range.  The
main difference is that in the most recent batch I added a tablespoon
of gypsum.  Has anyone ever noticed a correlation between the hardness
of the water and the rate of fermentation?  I can't really identify any
other possible cause.

It is a commercial beer, *inspired* by a traditional black beer of
an indian tribe. Indians do not make it, or have anything to do
with its production.  The process of making it is not even close
to that of the indian's black beer.  The owners of the brewery
might spit in the vats to bug gringos though.
