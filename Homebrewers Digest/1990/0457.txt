Hi all,


        Just a quick question on brewing groups and sources of good beer.  In
a little while I will be moving to Baton Rouge.  Does anyone know of good
places for beer in the Baton Rouge area (including New Orleans)?  How about 
supply shops?  Thanks

Subject: TA-DUM!  The FINAL word on Bud kegs (hopefully)




Ok, before we put this subject to pasture, I have one more thing to
add.  First off, though, I'd like to thank all the folks who sent me
email about the Bud keg idea.  We have a truly great group of people
here!


Doug Roberts (and others) suggested that not all stainless steel has
magnetic properties.  I wasn't aware of this, since I figured that any
material that is ferrous-based would have some magnetism.  So, when I
tried the magnet on my keg and it didn't work, I wrote it off for an
aluminum alloy.  


Then, when people suggested otherwise, I decided to put an end to all
of this speculation and do something drastic - ask.  I called the
Annheuser-Busch Brewery (sp?) in St. Louis (314-577-2000) and asked
them - figuring that the worst that could happen is that this would
fail differently than my previous efforts.  Well, eventually, I got
transferred to an engineer who was very helpful; he told me that the
kegs are made out of 304 Stainless Steel.


Now, I'm still curious as to the makeup of this alloy (I did take a
course in metallurgy back during my mechanical engineering days).
When I'm home, I'll check my old texts for mention of this alloy and
see.  If this turns up anything earth shattering, I'll post.
Otherwise, I'll spare the net with the details.


Still, it would appear that we have a good cheap source for stainless
steel kettles.  Grand total: $10 and some effort (which is yet to be
determined in my case).  Capacity of a 1/4 keg, btw, is 7.75 gallons.


Case settled, right?  *One* more question ;-} - has anyone using these
things come up with a good technique for pouring the (cooled) through
a filter system and into the primary?  It would appear that the handle
"ring" (for lack of a better term) at the top would at least partially
obstruct easy pouring of the wort, and siphoning would be next to
impossible with the whole leaf hops in my wort.  Suggestions anyone?


Cheers,


Ken

Subject: Uncarbonated Ginger Pale Ale advice




Thanks to all who have offered help on my stubborn Ginger Pale Ale. in
HBD #456 Glenn Colon-Bonet suggested that dried-out cork bottlecap liners
may have been responsible. Sorry, Glenn, but these were the nice modern
silicon-rubber lined caps. Good thought, though.


Eric Pepke's note about having carbonation problems when using _unpeeled_
ginger root might just be on the money. For sure I didn't peel the ginger
before grating it. Any of you chemist types out there want to analyze
some ginger peel and see what's in there that might shut down yeast? As I'm
not totally wild about the taste of the brew, I'll probably just never
try ginger beer again, and maybe that'll be the end of this sordid episode...

Oh, darn!

I have used this twice.  The first time was on my Christmas Ale last year. 
 This beer started out nicely, but started gushing after a couple of 
months in the bottle...Tasted OK, so what the heck, I thought...Then, I 
recently used it on another ale recipe.  Vigorous fermentation, dying down 
after about four days.  "Better rack 'er over" says I.  Son of a gun, I 
got a (healthy) secondary fermentation after racking.  "Damn!" says I, 
"Better have a homebrew and call Burch to see if I should worry..."  So I 
called Byron Burch up at GF, and he says "Oh yes, there have been some 
indications that Edme Dry may be contaminated with a wild yeast 
strain"(this isn't exactly what he said, but you get the drift...).  
Sooo...I'm letting it go, and I'll drink it if it doesn't taste too bad ( 
it is truly AMAZING what six months in the bottle and a low inventory can 
do for the taste of a beer).  


BUT, I ain't using that stuff any more!  As 
a matter of fact, I'm switching to the Wyeast stuff.  I grow my own hops, 
so I hope I can afford the $3.50 a batch...
