Hi everyone, sorry for the disturbance. It seems that while I was
out of town eating fine food, uh, I mean, on a business trip, 
somebody decided to borrow my cpu, hence the disappearance of the
Homebrew Digest from the face of the earth for the last week or so.

        This is my first season of growing my own hops.  My original plants
(from rhizomes) are doing very well and have loads of hops that look like
they will be ready for harvesting shortly.  I'm also getting lots of new
growth from the bottom portion of the plant.
        I read in a hop growing book that you can allow two or three of these
new plants to grow in order to have additional harvests.  The other new
growth should be pruned off so as not to create overcrowding and draw nutrients
away from the hop producing plants.


        My question:  Once I have harvested the hops from the original
plant, should this long vine be cut down just above the point where it
has sent out the additional growth?

        This depends on the yeast. I know of an excellent
brewer at a microbrewery who regularly ferments his ales in
the low fifties (F) with his yeast, but I've had Edme shut
down, never to rise again, if the temperature drops below 70F. 
It's not just me, either, as several people have reported this.


        It might come back in the bottle for priming, but
don't expect it to work real fast. What the heck, try it.
Siphon off a gallon, chill, prime, and bottle. Compare
side-by-side with the remainder. I learn something with every
batch, but this way you could say it was science!

Subject: Mac Index




It seems as though Jeff Benson has created an index for TCJoHB in
Microsoft Word 4.0 format.  My congradulations to him as the Mac can
create some truly lovely output.  


Since I am have already created the same thing in a parallel universe
there is no need to offer my Word 4.0 index again.  But I have created a
Post Script version of this index that should print in a UNIX
environment.  This is the same thing.  A index that will fit in the back
of the book made to look like it belongs there.  Just print it double
sided and cut off the extra bits and you are all set.


If anyone is interested just forward a request to me and I will gladly
send along a copy of the index.

Subject: When do you add grains?


I have been brewing for about six months with malt extracts and I want to
start experimenting with small amounts of grains. After reading
several sources on this matter and through many recipes I find a
point of departure on the technique of adding crystal malt, black
patent, and roasted barley.  One question concerns the preperation of
the crystal malt and the other is in reference to the timing of adding
these grains to the boil.


On one side the preperation states that the crystal malt, in this case about
1 pound, should be mashed using a simple infusion method and then
sparged before beginning the boil.  The remaining grains are added half
way through the cooking time and then the wort is sparged and added with
the rest of the water.


The second method requires that all the grains should first be boiled 
together for about 1 to 4 minutes.  As much of the grain as possible 
should then be removed , continue with the wort preperation and sparged 
before adding this with the remaining water.


As I will most likley try both methods at some point in time, I would
still like to have some opinions as it seems to me that the difference 
in these methods will produce very different tasting beers and in my case 
stouts which will be my next batch.

Ahhh 'Ganset Porter, $0.25/bottle, if you spilled it it would leave an
indelible stain on the wooden floor, no matter how quickly you cleaned it
up.  It was my sustenance in college (along with espresso, but's that
another story). I haven't had it since. Do they still make it?

And a little story: My brother showed up as I was brewing a batch of brown
ale. His response to the sight and smell of the boiling wort had something
to do with sewerage treatment. So I gave him one of my wheat beers, and he
loved it.  Then he said the wort wasn't really that bad, and started asking
about brewing time,money,ingredients,etc.  Now that's a good feeling *:-)

Sorry I can't give first-hand experience, but I can add one small
snippet of information.  Reading Michael Jackson's
_New_World_Guide_To_Beer_ on beers of Sweden (my wife has
relatives there and we expect to visit), I found that one native
Swedish beer is a Juniper Ale.  So there are commercial examples
somewhere in the world.  The Till brewery makes it, and it is
called Spetsat.

They're selling stock to get the thing running.
They're planning an amber ale, in 600 gallon batches.

Subject: Cooling the Wort


I made a batch of beer the other day and was going to put some "clean"
cold water and ice in with the wort to make 5 gallons, when I found that
the ice pieces wouldn't fit into the neck of my new glass carboy.


So, I found another use for the ice.  I put it in my funnel-strainer
and poured the hot wort through a bed of ice and hops, essentially.
The result was a cooled wort much faster than I have ever had before,
allowing me to pitch the yeast within minutes.

Neat idea! But I can never find one of those doggone lefty peelers anywhere
around here... oh well. I guess i'll stick with the pen knife. although I heard
of a Left Handed Store in Burlington, NC that sell all sortsa stuff like lefty
cards, can openers, pencils (the lead doesn't smudge when you drag your hand
across it) and other useful items. Anybody in VA or NC know where this store or
a nearby one is? I'm in Greensboro, NC.

Ouch! Wouldn't the scouring action of the steel wool create "groovy" places for
beasties to grow? (Sorry, couldn't resist the puntential for a joke...) I have

Hi Y'all,


        If anybody cares my Hot Ferment went well.  The average temp
of my wort was 73 degrees (The temperature of my bath room floor).
It finished it's primary ferment in 1 1/2 days.


        When I racked it I noticed a fruity flavor.  I think that
this may be from the Alexanders Malt Extract, I've never used it before.
I think I remember someone mentioning this before.  Any comment?

Subject: Racking Tube Horror Stories


Hi Y'all,


        On a different subject: I've been having troubles using
one of those rigid type racking tubes.  The problem is a loss of
pressure/suction where the rigid racking tube connect with my racking 
hose.  The difference in between the inside diameter (ID) of the
rigid tube and the ID of the hose creates an open air gap.  This
gap causes the suction to slow and eventually the siphon fails.  I've
tried putting a hose clamp at the connection, thinking there was an
air leak there, but that was not it.
        
(I'm gonna flame here)
        This really gets me pissed when the siphon stops and the
remaining beer/wort in the tube *BUBBLES* back into the carboy!
Of course I do this several times, AAAARGHHHHH!!!, before I give
up and just use a plain hose.


        I would really like to use one of these rigid tubes because
my hose tends to curl and this makes getting the last of the wort
out of a carboy difficult.


        Does anybody else have this problem?
        Any suggestions? Please!

None of these adjectives accurately describe competent homebrew.

My only batch using more than a pound of honey
also had a sharp, almost lemony sourness to it, and I was *worried*.
And I did not add any citric acid during any part of the process.


>>Is the honey responsible? 


Apparently so--for me.  
The sourness disappeared completely after a few months.


>>Is is the dreaded "I" word?  


I concluded that it was not--for me.  A very experienced homebrewer,
beer judge, and former local brew-pub brewmaster concurred.  
He didn't taste it until it had been in the bottle for 8 months!

6 months seems about right.  I regret stashing so little of that batch
away.  I would have been better to have brewed some quick-maturing beer
to divert demand from my honey beer until it was ready to drink.

Subject: Bock im Stein


Hello,


     I recently found an interesting beer.  I was on my way home
from doing some camping and I stopped in a New Hampshire State
Liquor Store.  I was perusing the isles looking for some good
Irish Whiskey, when an interesting bottle caught my eye.  It was
a clay bottle with a resealable top, like on Grolsch bottles.  Upon
a second glance the word BOCK stuck out.  I thought they only
sold hard liquor here, Well, it was indeed beer!


     The beer is 'Fiedlers Bock im Stein'.  A German Beer.  The
label also says 'Bockbier im echten Steinkrug'.  Can somebody
translate this??


     The back label says it's '... an unpasteurized aromatic 
pilsener beer ...'.


     The bottle came capped with a standard bottle cap, and the
resealable cap was hanging on the side.  The bottle is made
of clay and is glazed brown.   It has a four inch diameter and
stands about eight inches high.  This is a hefty bottle!  It was
definitely made to be reused, sort of novelty marketing, like
Grolsch bottles.  I think you Mead makers would like this, it
could hold some serious pressure. It holds 1 Pint, 9 Ozs.  I
really like the bottle, and I considered buying a case, but I
thought I would first try it out before doing so.  I bought two
bottles at $3.65 each.


     Ok, now to the beer.  I'm no beer judge but I will try
to relate in typed words.  The color is a clear golden/amber. 
The head is average and the carbonation medium to low.  I don't
have a very good sense of smell, but it smells like beer :-}. 
The flavor is very malty and thick.   Surprisingly so for the
color.  It sort of reminds me of Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout.  It
has a medium hop flavor, tastes a bit spicy. Not very bitter. 
Gotta be some good German hops in there.  It's good beer!


     It's worth a try, of course, that's what beer drinkers do! 
I really like the bottle.  I have never seen it before, and
may never again, but I thought I would relate this to you all.


     Oh yes, It's imported by: Consolidated Distilled Products,
Inc. of Chicago.


     One more thing:  I also found there a 'Belgain ale flavored
with fresh cherries',  but that's for another day. (1 pint & 9 Ozs
of Bock im Stein says it's time to eat dinner and stop drinking
bier ;-}.

Subject: Over-carbonated :-(




OK, I'm trying to relax but it is getting harder to do.  My latest batch
(Papazian's Palalia India Pale Ale) has come out over-carbonated.  I
asked for some insight from the collective expertise of the digest when
my second batch (Papazian's Sparrow Hawk Porter) came out this way.  
Between that one and this one, I tried the same Pale Ale but only primed 
with 1/2 cup of corn sugar (as suggested) and it was under-carbonated.  So, 
on this second pale, I boosted the sugar back to 3/4 cup and voila, I have 
over-carbonation again.  By over-carbonation, I mean that when I pour it 
into a Pilsener glass, I get one inch of beer and four inces of head!  I 
have to spoon out the foam and pour again (and again, and again...).  


I am beginning to suspect an infection but the beer is really GOOD and
there isn't any gushing.  If I pop the top on the bottle and let it sit,
it will start to slowly foam out after about two minutes - not my 
definition of gushing.


For the record, I followed the recipes almost verbatum (I used a roasted
barley instead of toasted in the last (over-carbonated) batch of Pale.
I used Edme Ale yeast but I've used it and not had the problem, too so I
don't know if that could be a problem.  Someone mentioned (back in April,
I think) that they had heard that Edme had an infection problem.


I have some Rocky Racoon Crystal Honey Ale in the primary now and I'd like
to NOT have this problem again.  I also intend to start a Holiday Ale in
September which will be layed away until Christmas and I expect that would
be a prime candidate for over-carbonation, sitting for that length of time.  


Any other ideas from the group?

have the big-brew interests kept them out?


BTW - on behalf of all DECUS types, are there any in Las Vegas - site of the 
next Symposium?


Thanks...Gary

I was over at Wine and Brew By You today, and Craig and Sandy asked
me to extend to all homebrew digest readers an invitation to stop
by and spend a day with them in the store. Learn how a real homebrewing
supply shop works, see Sandy and Craig (and sometimes me) brew beer,
make wine, and clean up after store pets. There's always 8 or so beers
on tap, and usually a few bags of Zapps open.
