Since about December, each batch has been fine for up to about 1 1/2
months in the bottle, then it gradually starts to over-carbonate.
After about 2 1/2 months it's difficult to pour (even tipped) and
after three months, strange flavors begin to appear.  I attempted
many corrections; the only thing in common was Edme ale yeast (I'd
never had these problems before with Edme, I preferred the beer aged
4-6 months).  I finally bit the ($4.79) bullet and used Wyeast liquid
ale yeast for the current batch (still in secondary).  Have others
recently experienced anything similar with Edme?

In response to the questions I've gotten about the brewery...


The shares cost $100 & are sold in 'units' of $500, 800 shares will be sold.  I
'm not sure how far along they are.. maybe 10% have been sold.
They're planning on making an amber ale, sounds like Sam Adams. 600 gal. to sta
rt.  I am not connected with the brewery but will invest.
The guys who run it work/have worked at an ethanol plant in Floyd. (3 of em)
6 pack price will be $4-5?
Dividends will be paid in cash, not cases.
The name of the brew will be 'Moonbeam Ale'

Subject: No brewpubs in Missouri -- yet


     Several weeks ago the governor of Missouri signed a bill allowing the
     establishment of brewpubs.  Homebrewer and author Dave Miller put in many
     hours working with legislators to get the law passed in a state where
     voting for such a thing could look bad on a lawmaker's resume.
     So while there are no brewpubs in St. Louis now there may be soon.  I
     think Miller has hopes of starting one.

Subject: need to buy a pot


        When I first started brewing a couple of months ago, I bought
a cheap brewing pot.  However, I think now that it is too cheap.  The
bottom burns very easily and when I try to scrub it clean, I feel like
I am going to bend the pots in half.  When boiling water, I can see the
shape of coils through the water on the bottom of the pot.


        Anyway, I want to buy a new, good pot.  I know we have discussed
some of this before, but I did not save the information.  So, could
people e-mail me info about good places from which to mail order
equipment at a good price (my local place which has very good prices on
supplies, does not carry much equipment) or if you are in the Seattle area,
it need not be mail order.  I do not care if the pots are aluminum or
stainless steel (please, no aluminum pot flames).

Wow! I exclaimed...I use the Wyeast Irish yeast almost exclusively for my
ales and I've never seen this phenomenon.  This yeast is definitely one of
the cleanest, fastest, yeasts I've used.  In the past, I have seen little
bits of things looking like tiny "boulders" which float around in the beer.
I've heard that these are caused by infusion mashing at very low tempera-
tures.  But flakes, well I could guess a wild yeast infection.  Do you
scrub the bottles well, then sanitize with chlorine bleach solution?
Another possibility is protein-tannin complex, but I don't know why it
would congregate near the surface.  Are you using fresh hops?  Perhaps you
could elaborate on your process.  Do you mash or are you using extract?

Subject: Estimating caloric content of homebrew


As I've gotten tired of hearing comments about my girth being a direct
result of my beermaking and/or consumption, I'm interested in calculating
the calorie content of my homebrew.  Also, I want to stem the tide of
"oh, gee, beer is fattening" comments I get from people.


The assumption I'm making about calories in beer is that they are a 
function of the original gravity of the beer.  Water has a gravity of
1.000, and no calories.   Let's ignore the fact that pure alcohol has
a gravity less than 1.000.  I make the assumption that unfermentables
have the same caloric content as fermentables, as well.  (Is that a
reasonable assumption? I would expect sugars to have similar caloric
content, but I don't know about anything else that is dissolved in
beer, like proteins, etc.  At worst, this assumption would just give
you a high estimate).  


I don't have the formula handy for figuring potential alcohol from 
gravity, but figure that potential alcohol is a very convenient way
of calculating the calories.  Again, making the assumption that 
unfermentables are sugars of the same caloric content as fermentables,
we don't care about the finishing gravity for the purposes of this calculation.
Therefore we treat a potential alcohol reading of, say, 4%, as a actual
alcohol content of 4% for purposes of calorie calculation. Let's also normalize
our gravity at 60 degrees F and use a calorie count for an oz. of pure
Ethanol at that temperature.


The formula for calories in serving of beer would thus be:


 (x**) calories                % pure alcohol (potential)                oz. beer
_----------       x       ------------                          x     --------
 oz. pure alcohol            beer                               serving




**Does anybody know what the caloric content of an oz. of pure alcohol (x) is?
Surprisingly, this is not included in the average calorie counting book :-)


Are my assumptions valid, or do they ignore some fundimental physical
properties of beer or the universe?   Will this formula give an accuracy
within 10% of the actual calorie count?

Hello Homebrewing Compatriots


I'll being attempting an oatmeal stout in the near future and have
some questions. I have taken Jay H.'s suggestion and picked up some 
steel cut oats. What i need to know is whether or not to mash 
these grains. I am an extract brewer. If i need to mash, can I just 
mash the oats or do i need a source of enzymes from barley as required
in mashing malted wheat?   What exactly is Steel cut oats, are they malted
oat?


Thanks

Subject: Substitutions, and scratched plastic


I've got the standard couple of beginners' questions:


Dave Line has a recipe for an Old Peculier lookalike that uses black
treacle and saccharin.  I can't find treacle anywhere, and I'd rather not
use saccharin if there's an alternative.  My current plan is to use
molasses instead of treacle (equal amounts), and lactose instead of
saccharin.  Should I be using blackstrap molasses instead?  Each
saccharin tab has the equivalent sweetness of 1 tsp of sucrose, so I
assume I should use 2 tsp of lactose to substitute for each tab, since
lactose is much less sweet.  Does anyone have a better idea?


Also, I've been making a habit of storing my strainer, caps, capper and
stuff inside the fermenter when not in use.  I finally noticed that these
sharp metal edges were scratching the hell out of the sides and bottom of
the fermenter.  Should I replace it immediately, or can I deal with it
by rinsing it with boiling water before putting the sanitizer in it?
(I know sanitizer won't get into the scratches well enough to kill the
bugs, but I assume steam will).  I want to start a new batch (the Peculier)
soon, and I'd rather get some real info than be forced to worry about it.


Thanks for any info

Subject: Juniper Ale
Full-Name: Dave Sheehy




The secrets to the details of a juniper spiced ale lie under all your noses
in Papazian's epic work of which we're all familiar. In the recipe for
Tumultuous Porter (aka Goat Scrotum Ale) is a suggestion to add 1/4 C juniper
berries to the wort (sorry Florian but he doesn't specify any particular
variety :-). And indeed I have concocted such a beast in the recent past. I
used the extract based recipe as a basis for an all grain version which I
dubbed "Mashed Goat Scrotum Ale" (catchy name huh?). May I further the pun by
stating that it was painfully delicious? A quarter cup of juniper berries 
gives a definite juniper flavor without being overbearing. I got juniper 
berries from the spice booth at my local farmer's market. They were semi-dry
when I bought them and I don't know how fresh berries would convert (in 
Florian's case where he has access to the fresh stuff). I emacerated them in
the food processor and added them at the end of the boil (don't want to lose
all the aromatics you know).


I have also made a spruce ale using spruce essence and Papazian's spruce ale
recipe which calls for spruce essence (as opposed to the one which uses fresh
spruce tips). I much prefer the juniper as it is not as bitter as the spruce 
and is more flavorful to boot.  I have a suspicion that any essence is not 
going to be as good as the real thing (surprise surprise) so if I were going 
to make a spruce ale again I would make an effort to use fresh spruce.
