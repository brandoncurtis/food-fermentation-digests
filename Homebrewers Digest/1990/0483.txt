        Actually, as I understand it, this proposal has the support of
the local brewers like Rainier.  Federal law prohibits brewers from
saying how much alcohol is in their beer unless there is a state law to
the contrary.  So, this would require the big national brewers to have
two labels, one for Washington State and one for the rest of the country.
This would be expensive for them.  Brewers like Rainier and Olympia who do
most of their business here in Washington would have an advantage.


        It is sort of ridiculous that wine and liquor have alcohol
percentages on their labels, but not beer.  Why should we be treated
differently?

I was drinking a bottled weiss beer by Tucher called "Dunkles Hefe Weizen"
which I think translates as "Dark Yeast Wheat" beer. I really liked this
stuff, does anyone have a suggested recipe for something like this?
Also, Charlie P. mentions in TCJoB a weiss brewed using lactobacillus (sp?)
bacteria? How is this made? Does the brewmiester spit in the wort a few times
or what? :)
Tnks&Rgds,

Hi there!


Someone (they didn't append their name to their posting) asked in dig 482 how 
you carbonate your mead if you're going to add EtOH to kill off the yeast.


If you look again, you'll see that if you follow the "basic directions" you
allow the sealed jug of mead to carbonate *before* you add the EtOH to kill 
the yeast.


There are all kinds of variations on the basic theme I provided.  By all
means, feel free to play! 




                         Yours in Carbonation,

Subject: Pepper Beer




After reading many useful comments (I have a compiled listing of
them if anyone is interested), I set out to make pepper beer.  I
chopped up 10 green jalapena peppers boiled them with the wort for
30 minutes or so.  I strained them out when I poured the wort into
the primary.  In addition, I racked into a second carboy 4 hours
after I pitched the yeast.


That was 8 days ago and I plan on bottling tomorrow since the last
gravity reading was 1002.  The unfinished beer is amber, clear, has
enough hops for me, and has a great spicy (bordering on HOT)
aftertaste.  


I'll post again when the beer is ready to drink.  Thanks for all
the comment.

Well, y'all probably wont believe this on. But, I'll try anyways...


I have a friend here at work, and he's trying to talk me into making
"Gaucamole Cheese Beer". I tell him he's nuts, and he just grins. So,
I tell him, if there's any possible link to a recipe for the stuff, I
know the only place in the world it would be found. The Home Brew Digest!


Well, I come before you all to pose the question. Is Mark truely nutso,
or is there some slim possibility that there is a remote chance that
a recipe exists for this "Gaucamole Cheese Beer"? Or maybe just "Cheese
Beer" or "Gaucamole Beer"? Could that remote possibility exist?


I personnally think he's nuts, but I told him I'd ask, even though it
sounds incredibly silly.


I always remember, "Never say Never, 'cause then it'll happen"!

I have yet to break a carboy but I expact to drop one sooner or later.
I've always figure someday I'll be putting down a full carboy on my tile
bathroom floor, start to remove my hand from the underside, slip and drop
it the last inch or two, and smash in the bottom.


To ease my mind and aid my back in moving carboys I use an old Milk Crate!


The carboys fit well inside.  You've got two handles to use so it's easier 
to pick up. The crate gives you a nice stable surface.  And when putting 
down a cardoy on your cement or tile floor you've got a plastic cushion in 
between.


They're also cheaper than those handles. And can be used for many other
purposes, such as for storing beer bottles.

I've got a batch of Papazian's raspberry imperial stout, with a few
deviations, that has been in the bottle for a month.  I tried a bottle
last week and it had a very strong raspberry taste with a slightly
coffee/dark malt and hoppy/bitter aftertaste.  The raspberry taste is
accompanied by a sort of astringency or acidity that Papazian says
will soften with age.  I didn't notice any chocolate flavors, but the
strong raspberry taste overwhelmed any subtleness.  It's still very
young for an imperial stout and I'm hoping it tastes something close
to Papazian's description by Christmas.


Here is the recipe I used.  I was intending for the batch to be 6 1/2
gallons, but it turns out I have a 7 gallon carboy.  HBS stands for the
Homebrewers' Store, a mail-order store here in Seattle (great prices;
6 lbs Alexander's malt - $7.95, 24 oz hop sampler - $10.95,
1-800-TAP-BREW).


Recipe for 6 1/2 gallons (7 gallons)


    15 1/4 lbs  HBS bulk Alexander's light extract
    3/4 lb      roasted barley
    3/4 lb      black patent malt
    3/4 lb      chocolate malt
    2 lbs       English crystal malt
    3 3/4 oz    Bullion pellets - 9.6% alpha (bittering)
    1 1/4 oz    Northern Brewer pellets - 6.7% alpha (bittering)
    2 oz        B.C. Kent Golding pellets - 5.9% alpha (dry hopped)
    13 lbs      Fresh raspberries 
    4 tsp       Gypsum
                Sierra Nevada Yeast   
    1 cup       corn sugar


Procedures were basically the same as Papazian's (if anyone wants more
detail or doesn't have the Summer 1990 Zymurgy issue, I can e-mail a
copy of my brewing log).  The most notable deviation from Papazian's
recipe was the use of 13 lbs of raspberries rather than 11.  This was
because my wife and I got a little carried away at the u-pick farm and
ended up with 17 lbs.  Since I used all light extract instead of the 2
dark lager kits, I upped the crystal malt and bittering hops a tad (I
figured there was plenty of dark malt in there already).  O.G. was
1.087, F.G. was 1.022.  Since I added 1 gallon of water to the
secondary to top up to 7 gallons, the O.G. was effectively diluted to
1.075.


I've got some questions about fruit beers in general.  How much does
the fruit contribute to O.G. and alcohol content?  When I was figuring
out extract substitutes for this batch, I noticed that Papazian's O.G.
of 1.076 to 1.080 should have been accounted for by the extracts and
grains alone.  Doesn't 11 lbs of crushed fruit affect the O.G.?  Much
of the fruit would be insoluble and wouldn't change the O.G., but what
about the juice?  I always assumed that the fruit in beers would
contribute alcohol in addition to taste.  How much of the sugar in
fruit is converted to alcohol in the 2-4 weeks of fermentation (and
how much sugar is there in fruit)?

Subject: Grenades, secondaries




Even though I was not in the discussion on the subject, I'd like to 
thank all for the advices on what to do with grenades. I had to throw
away a batch of German Pilsner which tasted FANTASTIC, but was a real
foamer, and had popped a few bottles in the cases. With the knowledge
from this net, I was able to safely save a few bottles.


I also discovered the wonders of secondary fermentation. I used a secondary
for a number of weeks in the making of my latest batch of Maple Syrup Stout.
It tasted great right out of the secondary, and also had much more clarity
than a single stage fermentation.


As a matter as a fact, I'm going to enter my stout in the homebrew competition
at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in Navato(Ca) in about four weeks.


Also, I was for real about the "Gaucamole Cheese Beer". I know it sounds
silly, but Mark keeps bugging me....
