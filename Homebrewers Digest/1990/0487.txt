Subject: WBBY; "Beer Hunter"


Hi, all!


About the problem with "Wine and Brew By You":  while not doubting word for a 
moment, especially since I also received some outdated Wyeast not too long
ago, I am still flabbergasted by the account!


For the information of all and sundry, Craig (the owner of WBBY) has often 
seen hard copy of the HB digest, I discovered, but the SCA digest as well.  
He's apparently been well acquainted with both fora for some time.  I know 
this from his sending me hand-written notes whenever I get a new catalog, and 
on the box my recent order was in.  He's also been very nice to my dad, who 
went into WBBY to get my stuff for me and have it shipped.  According to my 
father, Craig seemed to enjoy what he had read of this digest.


So:  I *really* wonder what this was all about!  I'll be going down to Miami 
at the end of November for some special dental work, and have been hoping to 
go to WBBY.  Maybe I'll hear something then.  Certainly, I'll post what I 
think after actually meeting those people.


On another topic:  I'm *greatly* enjoying "The Beer Hunter", but have to agree 
that it suffers terribly from the half-hour format; an hour really would have 
worked well.  And how many others besides me headed straight for the 'phone to 
order their copy as soon as the closing credits rolled?  :-)  (NOTE:  I've
*never* done that before!  Normally I just tape a show myself, but decided 
that I want commercial-quality copies of this.)




                         Yours in Carbonation,


                                      Cher

Subject: Portland breweries & procedural comment




I just had the fortunate opportunity to visit Portland, Oregon on
business - Usenix Security Workshop - and was able to visit a few of
the microbreweries in the area.  We had some superb ales (very few
lagers in the places that we visited) which were beautifully hopped
with mostly Oregon hops (Willamette, Cascade, Nugget, etc.).  Portland
is, after all, on the Willamette river...  Anyway, a beautiful place
to be and to drink ale!


My favorite (WARNING: INCOMING OPINION!) brewery was the Portland
Brewing Company.  They made a full-bodied ale called Timerline Ale
which was IMHO one of the nicest ales that I've had in a long time.


The brewmaster at PBC was kind enough to take us through his
facilities.  I saw a couple interesting things which I thought that
I'd pass along to you all.  First, they have been using the same yeast
culture for some 5 years.  They continuously re-cycle the yeast slurry
from batch to batch.  My thoughts were that sanitation, etc., was
critical in doing this, particularly over that long a time.  The
brewmaster was surprisingly careless (bad choice of words! - but he
wasn't as sanitary as I would have expected) in the process.
Nonetheless, his ales speak for themselves.


Another thing was that his fermenting room was refrigerated at about
33F.  He pitches the yeast at about 70F, and then the wort goes into
an insulated fermenting tun.  In there, the metabolic energy of the
ferment maintains a wort temperature of about 74F throughout the
primary fermentation.  After primary is done, the temperature slowly
falls to roughly ambient.  At that point, they drain the yeast slurry
out of the bottom of the tun and continue on to the next batch.  Has
anyone else out there ever tried this, or even heard of such a thing
before?  I thought that it was fascinating.  I also thought that the
thickness and type of insulation on the tun would be crucial - too
little and the temperature would fall, too much and it would rise too
much.  This would seem, to this engineer (by education, if not by
trade), to be a diverging situation that could result in a lot of
"oops" batches.


I should also add that he uses a whirlpool affect to separate the wort
from the trub before pitching the trub.


So, if you're ever in Portland, stop in at PBC and tell the Brewmaster
that a bunch of UNIX weenies that he was kind to say hello and thanks
for the hospitality!  :-)  Oh, and try the Timerline Ale.  The
freshness of the hops will jump right out at you!

I'm interested in your homebrewing mail.  I heard about you from my brother
Mark in Pittsburgh.  I've brewed a few batches of beer and I'd like to
hear your tips, etc.

    How's this for "beechwod aging"?  AB is the second largest user of tannic
acid in the industrial world.  While I don't remember who the largest user 
is, I do remember that they do not produce anything for human consumption.
No wonder several Clydesdales produce such a rotten headache the morning 
after.

Subject: labels with percentages and diet soda




As someone forgot to mention, our neighbor to the north
already has percentages of alcohol per volume on their
in-country beer labels.  That's how you know to get the
Molson Brador and not the Export for that extra oomph!


I suppose you could make diet soda by substituting your
favorite artificial sweetener for the sugar, but the sugar
is also used to carbonate the beverage, besides give it
taste.  So, you can have flat diet soda, or you can have
diet soda that's carbonated if you attach a carbonator
to the dispenser or carbonate before bottling, or you could
make a semi-diet soda with enough sugar in it to carbonate
and then add artificial sweetener to suit your taste.


Let us know which one works...

Subject: Re:  Additives and Preservatives


Regarding recent discussion regarding Miller/Bud preservatives:


My understanding is that Miller can get away with their "no additives or
preservatives " (read my lips) claim is that there is no crap in _the
finished product_. Miller uses fining agents and chemicals to treat their
beer - they  get the right sugars, proteins, etc, and remove staling agents
with chemicals. They claim that all these chemicals are separated from the
beer before bottling, so the finished product contains "no additiives or
preservatives". 


I think that A-B uses a significantly more natural brewing process, and
uses fewer chemicals to produce their product.

Subject: Crud on enamelled pots - a hint from Heloise


JOHN T. LOHR comments on enamel pots:


> I use an enamel pot.  They're big, they're cheap, but they're also thin.
> When using these stir, stir, stir or you'll get crud baked onto the bottom.
> 'nuff said.


True.  I always get crud baked onto the bottom of my enamelled pots.  I 
guess I don't stir enough.  I have an electric range which inherently gives 
hot spots; the burned-on malt forms in an oval pattern, matching that of 
the electric cooking element!


The crud is a real pain to remove - scouring pads work, but require a lot
of elbow grease.  I've found that a little vinegar loosens the crud and
makes cleaning the a lot easier.  After rinsing, I use baking soda to
remove any residual vinegar.

I read somewhere (Miller, or maybe Jackson ??) that the term "beechwood
aging" refers to the technique of using aluminum slats to condition the
beer.  In the old days, the slats were made of beechwood, hence the name.

Subject: Well hey, this really works!


I am pleased in this, the last (well, perhaps penultimate) chapter of my tome
on entering the homebrew fray, to announce the birth of Mason's own version of
Schehrer's Carp.  In the keg a week, I sampled it tonight, and declare it a
tentative success - I'll wait at least another week to be sure.  It is a 
little cloudy (very possibly yeast sediment, as I have not shortened the 
pickup tube yet); has an bit of unusual background nose (not like any I have 
seen described, which surprises me given the temp during the whole process);
and lacks a little body (though at .016 or so, perhaps I mean mouth feel, if
that is different).  My goal was something better than the Watney's Red Barrel 
I have been drinking from bottles.  I may have succeeded.  It is definitely 
more potable than some Young's I have had in cans, hand imported for me from 
the source.  I will be getting some local homebrewers' comments in a couple of
weeks - I have had VERY little experience drinking homebrew, so I have no
calibration to deal with.


My thanks to all on the Digest for their hints, tips, suggestions, and other
comments during my loss of zymurgistic virginity.  Particular thanks to Pete
Soper, who has also contributed substantially offline.  And, of course, to all
readers of the Digest for putting up with the assault on the bandwidth.  It has
been very exciting and rewarding, and I must say that now I have seen it work,
I am hooked for the duration...just like my baby Carp 8').


Cheers...Gary (who is R'ed, now understands DW, and is H'ingAHB!)
