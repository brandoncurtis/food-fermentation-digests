Subject: Keg Valves/Connectors


Hello Everybody?


I'm going to be placing an order for a keg soon and I was wondering
what the merits and differences are of the ball-lock verses the
pin-shaft type of valves/connectors.


I'm looking for opinions of any type.  Why one might be better or
worse than the other.  Is one or the other harder to disassemble
or clean.  Dependability, availability of parts.  Any and all
information is welcome and will be greatly appreciated.


Much Thanks! :-)

Mike Fertsch suggested using vinegar and elbow grease
followed by baking soda to remove the crud from enamelled pots.


Another way is to just burn the crud off - put the dry pot on the
electric element on high, and wait till the black spots disappear.
It also works for aluminium pots.  I usually do this only after
scrubbing most of the heavy crud off.
