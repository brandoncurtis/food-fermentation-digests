Good job!  I'm glad that the Hunter folks have been made aware of this
potential marketplace.  I've been using the AC thermostat on my
brewing fridge for some time now, and I love it!  If I could make just
_one_ suggestion to the Hunter folks, though, it would be to make the
thermostat go below 40F; I'd love to be able to adjust the temperature
all the way down to 33 or even 32F for lagering.  I'd imagine that
this would be a trivial ROM (or some such) change for the Hunter folks
to make.  But then, what would I know...


Gary, I'd be happy to phone the Hunter folks to tell them this - could
you email me the phone number that you used to contact them?


Cheers,

I am visiting Baltimore this coming weekend and would like to know
of any brewpubs in the city, especially near the waterfront.  Thanks, Kim Mills

In re. Mike Charlton's head retention problems.  If the bubbles are small, it
sounds like everything's OK mechanically with the head.  You must just be
missing some of the miscellaneous organic molecules that strengthen the head.
How are you mashing?


The discussions here plus Michael Jackson plus the ghost of a bottle of
Framboise I drank a year ago that still smells good have pretty much convinced
me to go bum around Belgium.  What percentage of the populace speaks French
as a primary language?  My other wanderings in Europe have convinced me that,
although it is always possible to find people who speak enough English to 
get around, one fares much better if one can speak the local language, even
poorly.  I think it conveys a respect for the culture, which causes people to
warm up much quicker.  I can already speak some German.  Would it be worthwhile
for me to learn some French before going?

Another number you can call to protest the proposed beer tax is 1-800-33-TAXES.
Just leave your name and address and letters are sent to your reps and to ol'
"read my lips".


On a better note, I tried a new? beer out of Utica, NY called New Amsterdam Ale
(and beer, but the ale is better).  Pretty standard for a small-batch brew, but
it is dry-hopped, and has a very nicey, spicey flavor and aroma. A pleasant
surprise.

Hi,


My Oatmeal stout having now had a month in the bottle, I thought I'd 
post my findings (er, opinions!). The recipe was derived from several
posted by Jay H in digect #459 (thanks Jay!):


Oatmeal Stout
        8lb   British Amber Malt Extract
        0.5lb Black Patent 
        0.5lb Roasted Barley
        0.5lb Chocolate Malt
        1lb   Steel Cut Oatmeal
        2oz Eroica (brewing)
        1oz Fuggles (finishing)
        ~9g dry Whitbread yeast
        0.5cup Corn Sugar (priming)


        Procedure
        Crack the grains (I used a rolling pin)
        Add grain and oatmeal to about 2gal cold water
        Bring water slowly to a boil (over about an hour)
        Strain out all grains
        Add extract and Eroica, boil for 1 hour
        Add Fuggles, boil another 2 min
        Steep 15 min
        Sparge through a seive into a plastic bin, over ice
        Mix well, take SG reading
        Rack into 7gal glass carboy and pitch the yeast (no starter)
        Bottle when fermentation is complete (a week for me)


My OG was 1.062, at bottling it was 1.015. I pitched at 75F by saving a
bit of the cool wort in a saucepan, adding the dry yeast, swirling it
and dumping it into the carboy. It has turned out excellently! One of
my best yet (if I do say so myself). Black, smooth and creamy. The
oatmeal doesn't add a very pronounced flavour; I think it rather
contributes to the creaminess and smoothness, which is becoming more
pronounced as the beer ages. It has a fairly dark brown head,
presumably from the roasted barley, - creamy with small bubbles.
Similar to Guinness bit not as long lasting. At first I thought I'd
need a bit more oatmeal next time, but now I think Jay got it right!
We'll see in another month (if any makes it that long!).


Now on to Blueberry. I've just bottled a blueberry ale. A very simple recipe:
        7lb British Amber
        1.5lb Crystal
        2oz N Brewer (boiling)
        1oz Fuggles (finishing)
        Whitbread yeast
        2lb fresh frozen blueberries
Basically the same procedure as the stout. I added the blueberries at
the peak of fermentation. I tried some when I bottled; not much of a
blueberry flavour, but there is something there. We'll see how it
ages, but I suspect that more is required to give it a notecieable
fruit flavour. This time I used a 2 step fermentation - 1 week in the
7gal primary (with fruit), then another week in a 5gal secondary. I got
a lot of deposit in the primary - 2-3 inches; much less in the secondary,
about 1/2". The beer has come out remarkably clear, with a nice reddish
tint.


Finally, priming. I tried priming with malt extract for a while. I
found it caused a 1/2" layer of haze at the bottom of the bottles. This
was a dilemma for me - do I waste some good beer of pour sediment into
the glass? My solution was to return to priming with corn sugar!

        If you are a sports fan in the US, I am sure that you have seen
the Anheuser-Busch commercials against an increase in the federal excise
tax for beer.  What is interesting is that they say that this tax already
costs beer drinkers in the US $3 billion/year and that it is the single
most expensive part of the beer (I assume they mean theirs).  However,
they never say how much it is per beer.  They probably don't want people
to find out how cheap their ingredients (including corn) really are.
Isn't it great that we buy these products without knowing how much tax we
are paying?

Subject: Using external controls on 'fridges for homebrew


I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but there is a possible down
side to using external controls (such as the Hunter control recently
mentioned) to control the temperature in a homebrewing 'fridge.


*IF* the 'fridge you're using is a cycle-defrost ("frost free") model,
the external control will interfere with the self-defrosting function
of the 'fridge.  The way these generally work is that a timer
mechanism, which runs continuously, periodically shuts down the
refrigeration system and activates a high-wattage heating element which
is wrapped around the evaporator (freezing) coils.  The element melts
any accumulated ice, and when a preset temp. is reached (usually within
a couple of minutes), is thermostatically shut off.  Eventually, the
cycle-defrost timer turns the refrigeration system back on.


The external control works by shutting off all power to the 'fridge
when cooling isn't needed.  This means that the cycle-defrost timer
runs only a small fraction of the normal time (only when the control
supplies power because the 'fridge is too warm).  As a result, the
defrost cycle will occur only very occasionally.


Now, I realize we are running these things at a much warmer than normal
temp., and they are not typically being opened several times a day as
they would be in normal use, so icing may never become a problem.  It's
something to be aware of, though, if you use the external-control
approach.

Subject: Vortex in bottles


Hi there!




RE:  creating a vortex when draining bottles by spinning them a few times while
holding them-- this isn't meant to sound condescending in the least, but ever
hear of the Coriolus effect?  This is the "spin effect" put on winds, waters,
etc., by the Earth's rotation.  It's also what creates that useful little
vortex mentioned in dig 492. 


The Coriolus effect, btw, is affected by latitude.  So, you'll probably find
you get a better vortex spinning the bottle in one direction or the other, but
not both.
