Subject: re: Getting the Trub Out!


     In the last installment of homebrew digest, Ken Weiss describes his
difficulties in ridding his wort of trub:


>I then placed the brewpot in a bath of ice water. I gave it a strong stir
>to create a whirlpool and put the lid on the pot to prevent contamination.
>Every 10 minutes or so I spun the pot around a little, to help the process

     Most likley techinque.  The cooler you chill your wort, the better the 
cold break.  At the least, you should be down to fermentation temp before you
syphon out of the brewpot.  In my experience, the trub always seems to be 
quite finely divided.  I have heard/read that Irish Moss will make for 
better flocculation, but I have never tried it.  What I usually do is what
Miller suggests in TCHOHB, namely syphoning into the primary as soon as the
wort is cooled to fermentation temp, pitching the yeast, allowing 4-8 hours
for the trub to settle, then racking to another primary (or a holding 
bucket), leaving the trub behind.


     I usually end up with 1/2" to 3/4" of trub in the bottom of the primary
after about 4 hours settling time.  The trub isn't supposed to have it's
undesired effects until after the yeast passes into its anerobic phase, so
pitching the yeast as soon as you are down to fermentation temp is a good
thing from the standpoint of lessening the risk of infection.

Subject: Tubing for Kegging System


I am trying to put together a kegging system and need some
advice on tubing to use to connect the CO2 to the keg and
keg to the faucet.  Looking through a Superior Products catalog,
they offer a clear and a blue transparent 5/16" gas vinyl tubing,
but they don't indicate rated pressure.  I know that storage and
dispensing pressure will in most cases be less that 15 psi, but
what about artificial carbonation where I might want to run the
pressure up to 70 psi?  Will this tubing withstand the pressure?


I have seen soda tubing that has a braided reinforcing, sort of
like reinforced garden hose.  I am not sure where to find this tubing
in small quanities.

Just keep relaxing and not worrying.  A friend of mine, and fellow reader of
the digest, brought me 2 gallons of fresh cider from Tehachapi, CA last year. 
I put them both in the fridge and we started to drink one.  A few days later I
noticed a brown foam on top that looked an awful lot like yeast fermenting.  I
smelled it and decided to put an airlock on it to let it finish.  When it
stopped fermenting, I drank some and got a nasty sulphery smell and taste.  I
decided to let it sit for a while, and about a month later the smell and taste
went away.  The jugs were plastic so I put the cap on after the visible
fermentation was over.  It then carbonated in the jug.  I racked it off the
yeast trub on the bottom and put it into Grolsch bottles.  The other gallon
has never been opened and just swelled a little. It will be a year old this
month and I plan on opening it.  (Are you ready Bruce?)  The taste is like a
dry white wine with a little hint of apples.  If you like it sweeter, then
rack it off the yeast and stop the fermentation with campden tablets to
sterilize it.  You can also mix it with a small amount of fresh cider to give
it a little more apple flavor and sweetness.  I was surprised that it
fermented in the refridgerator.  Apples have natural yeast in them and my
cider book says not to add any.


On another note:  I like Norm Hardy's report on Germany.  It is informative,
short, and tells us how to make the same beer at home.


Greg Troxel asks about strange flavors with beer.  I have noticed that some
beers, especialy stouts, do not go well with pizza.  Michael Jackson uses his
beer like wine and serves different beers with different food.  I think the
problm with the jalepenos is that you have 2 strong flavors clashing with each
other.  Also, black patent malt has a burnt coffee charcoal like flavor and
seems to used sometimes in the wrong beers

That's why I usually chill to a point where the critters become
comatose, and let it settle overnight before racking and pitching.
The finer flakes seem just barely more dense than the wort, and take 
a long time to settle.  After cooling/chilling, I transfer the
wort back into the (sanitized) lauter tun, let the loose leaf hops
settle to the bottom, and then drain the wort out into the boiler,
which strains out the hops and some of the trub, and establishes a
pretty fair filter bed of spent hops.  Ladleing the wort gently
through this filter again will remove yet more trub, but not all. 
At this point I usually end up with wort that's less than crystalline.
In about 10 minutes, the bottom 8" or so is cloudy, the remainder
clear.  The cloudy region becomes smaller and denser until it's
settled into a solid layer an inch or two deep, in about 4 to 6
hours.


I've read accounts of apparently instantaneous trub separations, and
I'm puzzled, since my experience has alway's been much like Ken's. 
In one batch, I had a large, more-or-less bell-shaped trub cloud in
the middle of the boiler after chilling, and tried to rack around
it, but discovered that I could only recover about a gallon or so of
wort without getting cloudy matter as well.  It was my son (then 8)
who suggested using the lauter tun & spent hops as a filter -- that
kid amazes me, at times.

            ATTRACTIVENESS OF BEER AND FERMENTATION PRODUCTS TO
                      DEROCERAS SPECIES GARDEN SLUGS

                       Fort Collins, COlorado 80523


  ABSTRACT:  A series of field trials were conducted to determine the
  attractiveness of various malt beverages and fermentation products to
  Deroceras species garden slugs.  Among 12 tested American beers, a 3-fold
  range in attractiveness was measured, based on trap captures.  Alcohol was
  not involved in attractiveness to slugs as highest captures were effected
  with Kingsbury Malt Beverage, a non-alcoholic malt beverage.  Furthermore,
  alcoholic fortification of 48-hr flattened beers had variable, and
  occasionally negative, effects on slug captures.  Sugar water/yeast
  combinations showed substantial attractiveness to slugs with mixtures
  involving larger yeast > baking yeast > ale yeast, water check.  The
  addition of surface active compounds did not increase slug capture in sugar
  water/yeast baited traps.  A brewery waste product (malted grain fiber)
  also showed attractiveness to garden slugs, with increased attractiveness
  following amendment with sucrose and active yeasts.




Some notes:


The surface active compounds the abstract talks about (also known as
"surfactants") were Ivory Dishwashing detergent and also a wetting agent,
Aqua-gro.  As far as I know, no slug tests have been performed with the
surfactant used in Gillette foamy, nonoxynol-9.


Gallo Pink Chablis was tested and was not attractive to slugs, but
unfermented grape juice was.


Among the beers tested are Rainer, Strohs, Schaefer, Bud, Bud Light, Pabst
Blue Ribbon, Coors, Coors Light, Miller, Michelob, Kingsbury Malt Beverage.
The testing methodology was impecabble: each test trial tested 4 beers in
randomized locations in a 4 block slug trap, scattered in numerous
locations throughout a "heavily vegetated yard".  One of the beers was
always Bud, and results are expressed in ratio form relative to the Bud
standard.

Finally, that old freezer in the garage is hooked up to a Hunter
energy monitor (Thanks, Pete!!!).


Living in Florida, this is nearly an unimaginable plus, as I doubt
I've ever fermented a beer at less than 90F!


So, my question is a simple one: what temperatures do various yeasts
prefer?  For example, I like to use the Wyeast german ale yeast,  my
own cultures of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale yeast, and the occasional 
packet of M&F.  Of course, other recommendations are welcome!  I'd like
to do my first pilsner soon.  Recipies?

Subject: Ballentine IPA cap puzzle no. 66


I know this topic is a little dated (not to mention utterly peripheral), but
I didn't manage to remember until today to get the one of the many puzzle
caps from Ballentine's IPA which no one I know has ever been able to solve
to everyone's satisfaction.  If I ever needed the help of the nets, it's now.


It is puzzle number 66, and the pictures, as best can be translated into
words, appear to be:


First word:  a sheep saying "Baaa..." + "'b" (?)


Second word: K + what looks like a necklace (a lei) + 2000 lbs (a ton)


Bob Klayton?  Who is Bob Klayton?


The only things up for grab are the "'b", which is the real stumper - this
is the one thing that no one ever agrees upon.  Some say a whale with a
spout, some say a key....  I'm just about ready to put in a request with the
school's electron microscope for this pic.  The other is the lei, but this
I'm pretty sure about because they use the same pic in another puzzle, and
it's lei.  Also in another puzzle they use a lowercase letter in much the
same style as the mystery object in this puzzle, so that's why I say it's a
"b".  My thought on the whole thing (actually the rationalization which
allows me to sleep) is that it's an inside joke by the puzzlemakers.


The number of the people-hours which have been spent scrutinizing this cap,
under the broadest of physical and mental conditions, with all investigative
tools and methods available, borders on the absurd.  I'm not sure exactly
what fruits would fall upon the individual or individuals who can shed some
light on IPA cap 66, but at a bare minimum I will offer the very finest
level of hospitality I can muster if said person or persons should ever find
themselves in my neck of the woods.  My one concern is that this post will
fail to bring forth the solution, and will instead succeed only in spreading
the condition clinically know as "cap 66 angst" to more unwitting souls.

I have just found my first problem with kegging - I hope it's stupidity, and
not generic.  I went downstairs for a HB, and discovered that the tank was
empty.  Now that might not be unusual, but it is a 10# tank, and it has done
1/2 of a keg so far!  I must have introduced a leak when carrying it between
the house and the meeting the other night.  There was no obvious leak, which
makes me wonder what the normal precautions are.  I will be changing to a five
keg manifold and quick disconnect fittings while the tank is empty.  Is there a
way to help leakage problems when using hose clamps on plastic tubing?  Is
there a substitute for that method?

I would like to thank everyone for the quick responses to my post.
In particular, I would like to thank Chris Shenton for his supplier
list (you can never have too many catalogs) and Chuck Coronella for
forwarding Algis R Korzonas's "first batch" posting.  That put a lot
of pieces in the correct sequence.
 
Just so that everyone know that I have been set straight, I now know
that Foxx deals mainly with kegging, and I am not likely to keg.
(I wouldn't be able to keep it where I want the beer.).  I also will
look into locating copies of:
     The Complete Joy of Home Brewing, by Charlie Papazian
     The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing, by David Miller
     Brewing Quality Beers, by Byron Burch
 
 
I figure I will locate a starter kit (even if it is plastic ;-) and
upgrade one part at a time as time goes by.  But that is subject to
change after I start browsing through catalogs.

Subject: Kolsch


A question from Jay on how long to cold condition a Kolsch.


When I toured the Rhenania Alt brewery in Krefeld, they made a point of
saying (in German of course) that they age (or lager actually) their beer
near 0c or 32f for about 4 weeks to a month.  


For a homebrewer the only concern would be the viability of the yeast for
bottling (if not kegging w/ CO2).  From experience, I have never had a 
problem with carbonation given enough time, but sometimes I have to be
patient!

At the risk of being flamed:-)  (Please flame me directly if you must)


I have not read my digest in about 2 weeks so this may have been discussed.


I suspect that some among us will be in San Jose for Interop '90 the
week of Oct 8th through the 12th.  Can anyone suggest some interesting
places to visit.  Obviously, I hope they have to do with beer, or even
wine.


If this has been covered SORRY.  If not, well I hope it helps more than
myself.


CHEERS,

Subject: Cider experience


About two months ago I tried my hand at making cider.  I bought a gallon of
apple cider from Safeway, took it home, added some Red Star champagne yeast,
attached an airlock, and waited.  It fermented slowly for about two week with
the temperature being about 65.  Then there was no sign of futher yeast activity
but the cider was still very cloudy.  I stuck the bottle in the fridge for
two or three weeks, and it cleared up a little bit.  I bottled it and let it
sit for a couple weeks.  The cider came out dry, bone dry.  It puts a martini
to shame.  There is no real apple flavor left.  It disappointed me after
trying the Blackthorn cider at a local pub.  Oh well, next time I'll try using
a different type of yeast and see what that does.

Subject: HyperCard stack about beer and brewing


Thanks to Andrew Mossberg, we now have the Macintosh Hypercard stack on beer
and brewing in the archives.  He apparently told you how to access it - I will
now tell you what's in it.


There are actually three stacks - Beer Stax, beer tastes, and breweries.  The
first is the master, and accesses the latter two on request.  The main menu
leads to facts about beer and brewing, brand ratings, brand comparisons, and US
brewery facts. Ratings are always subjective, so take them accordingly.  All in
all, it is a pretty interesting set of stacks, and as always, you can add your
own information as you wish (if you register it - $7 shareware).  Have fun!


Cheers...Gary
