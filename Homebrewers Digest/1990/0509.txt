Subject: Thanks for the Help


I want to thank everyone that sent me information on how to 
get started.  I was impressed that I received answers so 
quickly to my questions.  I also found out from a fellow 
Montgomerian, that the only place locally is located in 
Fort Walton Beach.  Thanks again for the assistance.
If anyone else has any pointers that they would like to
pass on to me please do so.  I need all the help I can 
get.

Subject: cider; EDME


Hi there!


In digest 508, "jwhite"  (he didn't sign his posting) gives his hard cider 
recipe, using the following ingredients:


                                5 gal sweet cider
                                3 lbs brown sugar
                                3 lbs honey
                                2 pkg champagne yeast.


With so much honey in this recipe, I would have to say that what you have here 
isn't a cider anymore, it's cyser.  Cyser is apple melomel (melomel being mead 
made in part with fruit juice).


Traditionally, "cider" meant fermented fruit juice, and could be of any fruit. 
That "cider" is equated with "apple" is a modern convention.  


About EDME dried yeast:  I just used some for the first time.  It's acted much 
faster than any other yeast I've used, Wyeast included.  And although 
fermentation seems to be slowing down a bit now, my brew is still opaque with 
suspended yeast.  Is this usual for EDME?




                         Yours in Carbonation,


                                      Cher

Subject: Storage time for CJOHB special beers


I want to try some of the special beers in Papazian's book, but I was
wondering if people could give me an idea of how long some of these
should remain in the bottle before drinking.  Perhaps two durations are
required here - when the beer gets good and when it gets great.  The
recipes I am interested in are:
        Rocky Racoon's Crystal Honey Lager
        Kumdis Island Spruce Beer
        Vagabond Ginger Ale
        Cherries In The Snow
        Holiday Cheer
Mucho thanks in advance for any help.


I've also heard people saying not to use vanilla in brewing.  Is it because
of taste, or are there worse problems?

Not to worry.  That always seems to happen with the SN yeast (I've
cultured 6 bottles).  It also forms an amazingly dense pancake of
yeast that floats on top in the primary.  This is different than the
foamy layer I've gotten with other yeasts.  It will eventually sink to
the bottom after the fermentation slows (4-7 days) but only when
disturbed.

I'm going to be teaching an informal home-brew class here at Whitman.
Anyone have any ideas where to start?

Subject: Oak Chips


This is my first time using oak chips in my brew, so please be patient.
I've heard that the chips sink to the bottom and some remain floating.  
Should I worry about straining these chips out (well not WORRY but. . .)?
Should I siphon the wort to another container for bottling?  I have it in
my secondary fermenter/priming tank now, as I had heard that the chips 
could get stuck in the carboy blowoff valve.  Can anybody out there give 
us some advice on what to do with the chips?


Thanks,
Steve

It was bound to happen sonner or later, or so it seems.  


I am still a relatively inexperienced HB'er, having been at it for a little 
over 1.5 years with about 12 batches under my belt.  Normally I brew 10 gallon
batches at a time, but this last one, I decided to brew 2 5 gallon
batches simultaneously.


No problem.  Theses were the smoothest batches of all.  I brewed
the Dithyrambic Brown Ale and Toad Spit Stout from Papazian's TCJoHB.
I tend to brew using malt extract with added grains.  I haven't brewed
an all grain batch yet (somewhat intimidated by mashing on an electric
range).


Well, this is the first time I've tried using a liquid yeast 
culture.  I really got into watching the package begin to swell
all the time telling myself "Don't worry, it won't explode".
Neither packet did!  The primaries were off and fermenting and
all seemed quite content.  When primary fermentation finished
both batches were racked into secondaries (I use glass 5 gallon
carboys for both primary and secondary fermentations).  And then
it happened.


There was no action in either carboy for 2 days.  From the airlock, 
there was a pressure built up in the Brown Ale, but none in the
Stout.  Hmm, I wondered.  Then I noticed the white splotches growing
on the top of the brew.  "Ah, yes, I understand," I thought.  "An 
infection".


I can only think of two errors in my brew process.  The first may be
a contaminated yeast culture.  I doubt it.  I remember back about a month or
so about contaminated yeast cultures.  I used Brewer's Choice, both
1028 London style, date coded July 90 and September 90, 


The second may be storage of the carboys between batches.  After brewing, 
I clean the carboy and then fill it with a fairly strong bleach/water 
solution (stronger than my usual sanitization solution). At brewing time, 
I just rinse out the carboy (assuming that the bleach solution has kept 
the carboy sanitized during storage).  Is this an incorrect assumption?
I am pretty meticulous in sanitary methods.  With each batch, I seem to 
become more conscious and try even harder.  


I guess it was bound to happen sonner or later.

WOW!!!


5 gallons of apple juice, 3 lbs honey and 3lbs brown sugar with a champagne 
yeast. Having a good feel for how strong a cider is made from just 5 gallons of 
cider and champagne yeast I'd say watch out. This recipe sounds like a real 
killer. Is it even legal to make anything that strong at home???

Subject: Beer fridge drilling


I just bought a used fridge for a kegging system.  What I want to know from
the brewers who have kegs in fridge is where do you drill the holes.  Should
I drill in the door and have to deal with moving beer/CO2 lines, or should
I drill in the side and have an obstructed tap?  Also, I'd like to get my
hands on one of those Hunter thermostats.  Could someone please send me the
address and phone # of a supplier?  Last, is $36 an o.k. price for a used
5 gal. Cornelius keg?
