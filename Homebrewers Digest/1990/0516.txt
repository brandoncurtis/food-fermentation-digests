Why do the feds still want to prevent individuals from distilling
things, while commercial distilleries are now permitted?  I can think
of several possible reasons, but what are the real ones?

Subject: 7 gallon carboys


In HBD #515 Greg Roody asks:
 
>What were the previous contents of the used 6/7 gallon carbouys
>that some beer supply stores sell?  They look
>suspiciously like chemocal carbuoys - especially since
>you can still see the D.O.T. symbol location.  I just
>hope it wasn't something nasty like mercury or chromic acid.


My 7 gallon carboys came with a sulfuric acid label still attached.  I assume
that they are refuse from the local electronics manufacturering.  Although they
seem perfectly clean when I get them, I fill them with a baking soda solution
and let them soak aday or so before I use them.


Being of a basically distrusting nature, I would wonder why the one's you see
have the label removed.  Coiuld it be that they don't want you to know?  I
think the operative expression is "caveat emptor" (or however it's spelled).


Also Geoff Sherwood writes:

This is an interesting story but it ignores the fact that grapes can be used to
make brandy.

RE: A bit of Homebrew History


Homebrewing is also illegal in Georgia.  The ironic fact is that winemaking IS
legal.  I understand there is an effort underway to bring homebrewing in line
with the laws on home winemaking.


RE: Xmas Beer Recipe (Chris Shenton)


I hate to pique your interest with this bit of info, Chris, (because you're
not likely to get your recipe in time for Christmas--this year) but keep your
eyes peeled in Zymurgy for the winning beer in this year's Specialty beer 
category.  I judged this beer in Oakland and after one taste I was singing
"Jingle Bells"!!  It went on to finish 2nd in the final round.  Phil Fleming
from Colorado was the brewer.  I just checked Zymurgy and he's a member of
Hop Barley and the Alers and lo and behold, his phone number is listed in
the Homebrew Club section.  Perhaps I shouldn't publish it on the net but
here's the address for his club:

RE: Chilling Time (Steve Slade)


I don't have the particulars, and from your comments perhaps you already know
this, but...boiling wort in aluminum pots has generally been recognized as a
bad idea.  Anyone out there in Netland care to enlighten us as to exactly
why?


Keep on doin' the brewin'...

Subject: Dry Hopping


     I have dry hopped 3 batches now as an experiment.  The first batch
showed no sign of infection after 5 months, so I think the possibility of
dry hopping inducing infection is probably not what some folks would lead you
to believe.  I think general sanitation is more likley the suspect in 
infected batches.


     With that out of the way, I can definately say that dry hopping *does*
give you wonderful hop aroma.  There are several variations on dry hopping,
but what I do is this:


     Ferment in the primary until fermentation is fairly well done 
     (avg. 7 days for ales).


     Rack to secondary which contains 1-2 oz. of the hops you want to
     use.


     Bottle after brew clears + a few days for good measure (avg. 7 days)


     I don't know if the hops will settle to the bottom if left to soak
longer, but the majority want to stay floating about in the secondary even
after 7-10 days.


Good luck!

Subject: Green Grenades, Apple beer


My brew partner and I experienced another homebrewing milestone last night 
when one of our Grolsch bottles exploded, taking out 2 of its neighbors.  
Pretty exciting.  After reading about this time after time on the HB
Digest, I had refined my priming technique to avoid this.


Except this happened to our first experiment in kraeusening, not the bottles
primed w/ corn sugar.  So....a warning that the kraeusening formula in 
Papazian may be somewhat liberal.  Seriously consider cutting back on the gyle.


I too would like to brew an Apple Beer.  Thoughts on the appropriate apple
variety would be appreciated.   (I like the alternate meaning of "An apple
a day keeps the doctor away."  In my case the doc would be a psychologist.
Living in NJ can be a test of stamina.)
