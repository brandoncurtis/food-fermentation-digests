One pound is 454 grams. An easy way to convert pounds into kilograms is
to divide by two then substract 10%, e.g.:


3.5/2 is 1.75, minus 10% comes down to 1.75-.17=1.58kg.


Note that this approximates 1lb to .45 kg...

PS: Ever wondered wonder why most malt cans are 3.3lbs ? Because it comes
    down to 1.5kg (make more sense, hey ? :-)

This got me thinking; my last two batches have had very little head
formation and no retention. They are adequately carbonated, very clear
and clean tasting. I try to pass them off as "English Ales", but even 
English Ales have better heads than these batches!


These two batches are the only two for which I have used Irish moss! 


Now I like a clear beer, but the loss of head retention is too high a
price to pay! I'm going to make my next beer with no Irish moss, and the
one after that with about 1/2 the recommended dosage. Maybe I can find
a good compromise.

I seem to be missing the last four entries from HBD #535.  Generally in the
past Digests which are too large for my message system become "encapsulated" as

In HOMEBREW Digest #535, Dan Needham talked to a feller in Berkeley
(never the home of slavish orthodoxy), who said:


> to throw the grain in the last 5 minutes of the boil for the same result.
> He also said don't worry about a grinder to crack the grain -- just quick

The following must be classified as hearsay, as I have never done
either of the above, but:


Boiling the grains for 5 minutes could quite conceivably give you
the worst of both worlds: some tannin extraction, and incomplete
malt sugar extraction.  The method you've been using may be more
work, but it sounds much safer to me.


The problem with cracking grains in the blender has usually been
that some are reduced to powder while others are untouched.  A more
reliable method is to put the grains in a sturdy plastic bag, and
crush them with a rolling pin.

 to deliberately look for the astringency,
etc., I'd been promised was there.  My present hypothesis is that
the blowoff method may have had some real value when the available
yeast & hops were of less exacting quality than some present
products.  For example, I haven't tried a non-blowoff batch with Red
Star ale yeast ...

Subject: Nothing Exceeds Like Excess


At the beginning of last month, I reported in these pages that I was
planning to use Wyeast "Vintner's Choice" Champagne yeast for a
barleywine, that it appeared to be packaged in a grape must, and
that I'd report on the results.  I bottled it yesterday,
prematurely, and may well be looking at the most expensive failure
of my brewing career.  Or then again, maybe not.


The recipe was a product of my personal credo ("anything worth doing
is worth doing to excess"):


For a 5 gallon batch -


12 lbs 2-row pale malt
2 lbs Munich malt
2 lbs crystal malt
4 lbs Edme light malt extract
4 lbs Alexander's light malt extract
4 oz dark molasses
1/4 cup corn sugar (priming)


Bittering hops:                0.5 oz Northern Brewer `at` 8%, 2 oz same `at` 6.9%
Flavor hops:                1.5 oz Kent Goldings `at` 5.2%
Finish hops:                0.5 oz Hallertauer pellets `at` 2.8%, 
                        0.5 oz Cascade `at` 5.2%


Mash in:  18 qts well water `at` 140F, pH 5.3 (0.5 tsp gypsum)
Protein rest:  none
Starch conversion:  2 hrs `at` 150-141F
Mash out:  5 min `at` 168F
Sparge:  5 gal `at` 168F, pH 5.7 (0.5 tsp gypsum)
Boil:  2.5 hours
Adds:        Extracts, molasses, & bittering hops `at` 90 min
        Flavor hops `at` 120 min
        Finish hops `at` 140 min


As you can see, if I'd omitted the extracts and cut the pale malt
back to 10 lbs, I'd have the makings of a pretty fair ESB, but
noooo ...


I won't bore you with the trials of making this thing.  It was not
an easy batch.  Of more interest is the fact that the original
gravity was a whopping 1.126!!!  I pitched the yeast (which I'd
cultured through two successive DME-based starters), and the ensuing
fermentation was, well, volcanic.  The yeasties looked around,
chorused "All this, for ME??", and fell to.  I think I heard a cheer.
Fully 1.5 of the 5 gallons in the carboy departed hastily through
the blowoff tube.  When it slowed to a gradual stop and showed no
activity at all for more than a week, I gave up and bottled.
In retrospect, I should have taken a sample and measured the gravity,
then pitched the Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast I keep in the
freezer for emergencies.  That stuff will eat anything in sight!
The Wyeast had attenuated only down to 1.091, still heavier than most
of my starting gravities.  The flavor is impossibly "syrupy", but with
no (other) obvious flaws.  I put it in the cellar, and I think I'll
just sort of forget about it for a few months.


It has been a learning experience, though!  I learned:


1.  Wyeast Champagne yeast is not as attenuative as Red Star;
2.  A batch this size strains the capacities of my equipment, even
        the 33 qt kettle;
3.  Enough is enough, and 1.126 is too much;
4.  When in doubt, risk infection and sample.


Maybe I can pour it over ice cream ...

This is absolutely ridiculous.  The Deschutes Brewery has won an award for
its hop-flavored goat urine.  Now, they're going to advertise the award...
"Oh, we're so great, we won an award for our hop-flavored goat urine at
the Great American Swill Contest.  Now all you yuppie ski bums can cruise
right down and feel justified in letting us rip you off!  Now we are 
excused for helping turn Bend, Oregon into another little Aspen.  Yes!  we
can bring in our slimy developers and raise the price of local real estate
and when they get thirsty and need a real good headache, they can come
right down and guzzle down this award winning swill!"


But it comforts me to know that just five miles up the road, off old
Deschutes Market Road, in a little log home with a cozy wood fire I sit
and sip pretty good home brew with my friends.  Those same friends who
agree with me that the Deschutes Brewery Swill is, indeed, the worst beer
they have ever tasted.


I think I'm going to go home tonight and make an apple pie.

Hmm.  I never thought of that.


What I've been doing is setting it outside to dry, and then when
it's dry, putting it in the bird feeder.  They love it.
Sometimes it's gone before I ever get a chance to put it in the
feeder.

RE: HBD #535:


Kevin Carpenter wonders about using 5 or 7 gallon carboys 
for primary fermentation.   I strongly recommend using 5 gallon 
carboys so that you get some blow-off.  I think you'll find that some 
of the residual astringency that lingers in the aftertaste of some 
homebrews will disappear with the blow-off system.  If you have any 
doubts--as I've mentioned before--just scrape some of the brown crud 
that is left around the top of the primary fermenter and taste it.  
Hey! Green persimmons do not hold a candle to the bitter, astringency 
you will taste.  We spend a lot of time *AND MONEY* buying the 
best ingredients, equipment, etc., etc. trying to hone in on the 
world's perfect beer.  Would you buy a couple of Tablespoons of that 
stuff and add it to your beer if you had the choice?  No way!!  That's 
why I've always told new brewers that the age-old debate as to whether
one should skim or not is just a pseudo issue.  The real question is 
whether one should skim or use the blow-off method.  Personally,I think 
the blow-off method is both safer (in terms of avoiding the risks of 
contamination) and more efficient.  About a hundred batches ago I 
tried it and I've never skimmed again.


As for the beer or two that you might lose during the blow-off, who 
cares?  I give well over a quarter of my beer away anyway.  I don't 
begrudge a couple of more.  Just call it a libation to the gods of 
beer!  They'll appreciate it and imbue you with a sense of relaxing,
not worrying...


Dan Needham, in the same issue, wondered about boiling blender buzzed 
grains the last five minutes of the boil.  It's my understanding that 
boiling grains extracts tannins.  Tannins are bitter and don't promote 
smooth beers.  I'd advise against it.


Boiling grains may also promote the development of phenols.  I'm not 
sure about that one.  I'll have to check  Malting and Brewing Science 
and get back to you.  Unless, of course, someone else out there in 
Netland can enlighten us.


All this talk of beer has gotten me thirsty...let's see...will it be 
an ale tonight?  Yeah.....


Sante' !

An interesting note here is that "beer" is defined as a lager and that 
California does not have a limit on the alcohol content of Ale.

Based on the latest data compliled by the Beer Institute (formerly the United
States Brewers Association), the maximum permissible alcoholic contents for 
beverages sold in the various states is as follows:
