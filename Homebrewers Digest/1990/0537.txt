Hello out there,


I just brewed my first all-grain batch yesterday and I have a few questions
that some of you more experienced types might be able to answer.


Mash ph: When I measured my mash ph with those damn little papers, it was too
 low so I added some stuff (sodium bicarbonate, I think, but the stuff Miller
 says to use to raise the ph). I had a half size batch (for manageability) of
 Miller's Altbier, and I put in 1 tsp and couldn't get the ph up from 4.9.
 Is there a trick to using those papers? Are there relatively cheap electronic
 ph testers out there? Does it sound like I'm doing something wrong?


Sparge water ph: Miller reccommends acidifing the sparge water to 5.7 using
 gypsum. I tried this and couldn't get the ph down (those damn papers again).
 After od'ing a few gallons of water, I stopped trying to measure the ph and
 just added 1tsp of gypsum to my 2.5 gallons of sparge water. Again I wondered
 (not worried) if I did something wrong.


"Clear" sparge runoff: What exactally is "clear"? I recycled my runoff many
 times (probably about 5 times), keeping them heated as Miller suggests. The
 runoff was always cloudy. Maybe this has something to do with my ph problems.
 I eventually stopped recycling it and finished my sparge. I had no more trub
 in my carboy than usual. My mash efficiecny wasn't too good. I was shooting for
 an OG of 1.047, and I got 1.038 so I added some DME to the boil to beef it up.
 Was this the wrong thing to do?


Whole hops: This was also my first time using whole hops. Should they be
 broken up? I just threw in the whole cones and they remained whole throughout
 the boil.


Overall, everything went a lot smoother than I expected it would. For anyone
wanting to get into all-grain I have two suggestions:


1. Make a half batch. the volumes of mash and wort are manageable (3 gallon
   boil vs 6 gallon boil).


2. Have some dry malt extract on hand to boost up the gravity in case your
   mash efficiency wasn't too high.

Subject: Lactobacillus experiment


Date sent:  13-NOV-1990 08:24:27 


        I read a suggestion in a previous homebrew digest conerning the
addition of a small amount lactobacillus milk during fermentation with
the idea of replicating the flavor of some Belgian styles.  Has anybody
tried this yet?


        I just tried it with a batch of "Cherries in the Snow".  So as
not to ruin my whole one gallon batch, I set aside one 16 oz bottle for
the lactobacillus experiment.  I added one teaspoon of the milk to this
bottle and attached an airlock.  Shortly thereafter I noticed large clumps
of puffy thread-like structures floating at the suface in the bottle.
Would this be the lactobacillus?  I'm planning to let it go for one week,
then rack and cap.  
        
        Finally, is there any danger involved with a lactobacillus 
fermentation.  Generally, no matter how awful a brew turns out, it won't 
have any killer poisons.  Does the addition of lactobacillus milk change
this in any way?

Subject: BASIC MEAD RECIPE




  
  Jim: 


  I'm brewing a batch now using Cher Feinsteins recipe but I did have 
  a problem in starting fermentation (sprinkle method). My "research" 
  indicates that honey doesn't ferment as easily as beer malt and you 
  should pre-start the yeast. 




  STARTER: 
                         \
   1 cup OJ               \
   1 cup water            /   BOILED AND COOLED TO ~ 75F 
   2 tbs corn sugar      /     
              
             
   THEN  ADD 
   1 tsp yeast nutrient
   1 pkg yeast (Montrechet) 






   Funnel the contents into a qt beer bottle, or Champagne bottle
   and shake and then seal with an air-lock (I use vodka instead of 
   water)  


   Let this sit ~ 1 day or until fermentation begins and then pitch 
   into your must (watch out for temp differences). Then aerate 
   the must thouroughly.

    Subject: Clarification, re:  mead
    
    Hi there!
    
    A number of people have written to ask me about the amount of honey to use
    if employing the recipe I posted.  It's in there, but I can see where people
    would miss it.  
    
    So:  2 pounds of honey for every gallon of mead you wish to make will yield 
    a fairly sweet mead, unless allowed to ferment for a considerable length of
    time.  In that case, the mead will not only be less sweet, it will be much
    more alcoholic; something to consider.

    Subject: Mead info
    
    Hi there!
    
    I had received a request for info on mead from Mark Leone, and typed up the 
    following, when I got more requests as well as seeing requests posted here.
    So, to save myself time and trouble, here's that same information.  Anyone 
    having any further questions should feel free to contact me.
    
    Below is my "basic" mead recipe and technique.  As written below, it makes one 
    gallon.  What I do is adapt this recipe to meet my current needs, adjusting
    ingredients as needed.  The overall technique remains the same.  I generally
    age several months, then check it out.  Aging times will vary with recipe 
    changes and modifications.  If it still tastes "rough" after 4 months or so,
    then I assume it needs a year to age, minimum.  If you brew up the recipe 
    precisely as written below, it will be ready to drink in as little as 3 weeks.
    
    If you decide you want a book about mead making, I suggest getting 
    Acton & Duncan's book.  Although I don't mess around with all the additive 
    ingredients their recipes call for, the recipes are a good source of ideas, 
    ingredient proportions, and probable aging times.
    
    About honey:  *ALWAYS* try to find a source of fresh, raw honey!  Health food 
    stores are a good bet.  Avoid pasteurized- and blended-to-death commercial 
    honeys such as SueBee, which are also likely to contain additives.  The flavor
    characteristics of the honey you use will be reflected in the mead you make. 
    Two very popular mead honeys are clover and gallberry.  Surprisingly, orange
    blossom is not particularly popular as a mead honey. 


    About yeast:  always use a chablis, sauterne, or other white wine yeast.  
    Montrechet seems to be the yeast of choice.  Although generally considered a 
    brew, modern ale yeasts will over-carbonate a mead, leading to glass grenades. 
    I doubt lager yeasts would work at all.  So, stick with wine yeast.




    
    About bottles:  you can use longnecks just fine.  I like to use Grolsch 
    bottles for mead, or the big 2 liter swing-top (like Grolsch bottles) 
    Altenmuenster bottles.
    
    Finally:  I am of course assuming that all equipment used is cleaned and/or 
    sterilized, as appropriate, and shan't insult you by adding instructions to 
    the recipe to do so.
    
    
    
    BASIC MEAD RECIPE (makes 1 gal):
    
    Fill a 1-gal enamel pot 1/4 full of water.  Simmer 2-3 whole cloves (lightly 
    cracked), 2 sticks cinnamon (broken up), and 2 slices fresh peeled ginger root 
    to taste.  Add 2-4 teaspoons orange peel (to taste; no white) and simmer 
    further, again to taste.  Add more water to bring contents of pot to 3/4 full.  
    Bring to a high simmer.  Add honey, *stirring constantly*.  Keep at a high 
    simmer, skimming off as much of the white scum that forms as possible.  If the 
    scum is yellow, turn the heat down.  Once no more scum forms, turn off the 
    heat, cover the pot tightly with lid, and leave for 8-12 hours (or overnight).
    If desired, strain or spoon out the spices first.
    
    Pitch the yeast the next morning, straight into the pot.  If you want a
    starter culture, mix the yeast with honey and water the night before, when you
    cook up your wort.  Replace the lid on the pot (the accumulated moisture will 
    act as a seal) and leave for 12 hours.
    
    12 hours later, rack into a gallon jug.  It should be full to the base of the 
    neck, but no more.  Take a clean square of paper towel (not the outermost 
    sheet), fold it into quarters, cover the top of the jug with it and secure it 
    with a rubber band.  This will be sufficient for the krausen stage of 
    fermentation, although of course a regular water lock may be used.  If the
    paper towel gets fouled by the krausen, replace it. 
    
    Ferment at least 36 hours.  The longer it ferments, the dryer (less sweet) the 
    mead will be.  If fermenting long enough for the krausen to subside, change to 
    a regular water lock.
    
    Once fermentation has proceeded as long as you intend to permit it, place the 
    jug in the refrigerator to shock the yeast and start it settling.  Leave for 
    8-12 hours.  Rack into a fresh jug, and replace in the refrigerator for a 
    further 12 hours.  If you want a sparkling mead, seal the jug first to allow 
    carbonation to build.  If you want a still mead, leave the fermentation lock 
    on.
    
    The yeast may be killed off at this point by the addition of 1/2 cup
    (sometimes more is needed) *100 proof* vodka, or grain alcohol, if need be.
    
    (FURTHER NOTE:  when I make mead, I don't like it to be too sweet, so I permit 
    fermentation to proceed for a considerable length of time.  However, unless 
    you want a *very* sweet mead (in other words, you're willing to use lots of 
    honey to create a situation which will quickly become unfavorable for the 
    yeast), one usually needs to resort to the vodka/grain alcohol trick to get
    fermentation to stop. )

Hmm.  I never thought of that.


What I've been doing is setting it outside to dry, and then when
it's dry, putting it in the bird feeder.  They love it.
Sometimes it's gone before I ever get a chance to put it in the
feeder.

RE: HBD #535:


Kevin Carpenter wonders about using 5 or 7 gallon carboys 
for primary fermentation.   I strongly recommend using 5 gallon 
carboys so that you get some blow-off.  I think you'll find that some 
of the residual astringency that lingers in the aftertaste of some 
homebrews will disappear with the blow-off system.  If you have any 
doubts--as I've mentioned before--just scrape some of the brown crud 
that is left around the top of the primary fermenter and taste it.  
Hey! Green persimmons do not hold a candle to the bitter, astringency 
you will taste.  We spend a lot of time *AND MONEY* buying the 
best ingredients, equipment, etc., etc. trying to hone in on the 
world's perfect beer.  Would you buy a couple of Tablespoons of that 
stuff and add it to your beer if you had the choice?  No way!!  That's 
why I've always told new brewers that the age-old debate as to whether
one should skim or not is just a pseudo issue.  The real question is 
whether one should skim or use the blow-off method.  Personally,I think 
the blow-off method is both safer (in terms of avoiding the risks of 
contamination) and more efficient.  About a hundred batches ago I 
tried it and I've never skimmed again.


As for the beer or two that you might lose during the blow-off, who 
cares?  I give well over a quarter of my beer away anyway.  I don't 
begrudge a couple of more.  Just call it a libation to the gods of 
beer!  They'll appreciate it and imbue you with a sense of relaxing,
not worrying...


Dan Needham, in the same issue, wondered about boiling blender buzzed 
grains the last five minutes of the boil.  It's my understanding that 
boiling grains extracts tannins.  Tannins are bitter and don't promote 
smooth beers.  I'd advise against it.


Boiling grains may also promote the development of phenols.  I'm not 
sure about that one.  I'll have to check  Malting and Brewing Science 
and get back to you.  Unless, of course, someone else out there in 
Netland can enlighten us.


All this talk of beer has gotten me thirsty...let's see...will it be 
an ale tonight?  Yeah.....


Sante' !

An interesting note here is that "beer" is defined as a lager and that 
California does not have a limit on the alcohol content of Ale.  


>Most nationally distributed beers are less than 4% as this

Based on the latest data compliled by the Beer Institute (formerly the United
States Brewers Association), the maximum permissible alcoholic contents for 
beverages sold in the various states is as follows:

Full-Name: Dan Needham


I used leaf hops in my last batch.  All other batches used pellets.  The
loose leaf hops made it difficult to siphon from the boiling kettle to the
primary fermentation vessel.  Do most people use cloth bags to contain the
leaf hops?  I ended up pouring the cooled wort throught the net bag in my
sparging bucket.


Also I dry hopped with about 1 oz. of leaf hops.  I put these in the 7 gal.
carboy before the wort.  Fermentation is under way and it looks like all or
most of the hops are floating on top of the foam head.  I don't think much
aromatic extraction will happen this way.  Again should I use a cloth bag --
with a couple of clean rocks to weigh it down?  Maybe I should be satisfied
with pelletized hops.  I'd like the flexibility to use either.  Does anyone
know where I can get a few hop plants to grow in my back yard (strings up to
the roof ;-))?  Cascade would be fine.

Subject: fresh whole hops


Hmm... Isn't October hop harvesting month?  I don't recall any mention
of this on the digest.  I'd like to get some fresh whole hops for my
latest brew, but have discovered that getting good looking ones is a
challenge.  Isn't there some place called "freshops" or something
where I can order them directly from Oregon/Washington?

Yup, a bunch of us do. Cheryl Feinstein seem to be the net.authority,
and I'm sure she'll respond to you, but here's a collection of all the
interesting mead stuff from the last couple of months, in uuencoded
Babyl format. I just laid in 10 gallons of cyser, which looks like
it's gonna be really good. Made up the recipe as I went along, so
there's some question, but right now it looks like it'll work:


For 5-gallon batch:
4 Gallons fresh cider (no Pot. Sorbate!)
5-6 Lbs honey
1 Gallon water
1 Large stick cinnamon
5 cloves
2 pods cardamom
2 packets Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast


Simmer the spices in the water for 10 minutes, dissolve the honey,
simmer and strain the crud till there isn't any more, transfer to
primary, along with cider (this should bring the primary to a good
pitching temperature), pitch the yeast, wait ~ 1 1/2 weeks for the
foam to die down, transfer to secondary (this is fairly tricky, 'cause
if you do it too soon, it's gonna blow off). It's still bubbling at a
fair rate right now, so it'll probably age in the secondary for 3-6
months, after which I'll bottle it and let it age for a month or three
more.


begin 600 mead

Subject: Irish Moss




Hi,
I just wanted to add that I have been using Irish Moss in almost every batch
and have had no problem with head retention.  In fact, depending on carbonating
pressure the heads I have achieved range from .5 inch to 2 inches of extremely
fine bubbled foam.  Note, I use extract mash recipes with varying amounts of
mash.


Now, I have made a somewhat different observation regarding Irish Moss.
I typically brew in 7 gal plastic for primary fermentation, using about
5.5 gal of wort.  In a batch where I didn't leave the trub behind (trub
including Irish Moss).  I had an unusually vigorous fermentation, where
chunks of Irish Moss and yeast were observed to be actively churning in
the wort.  This batch eventually blew the large (1.5 foot diameter) lid
off the fermenter.  Removing the lid usually takes considerable effort
on my part.  I didn't worry and put the lid back on and the beer turned out
great.  I am led to believing the Irish Moss is the cause of the vigorous
fermentation because my brother had a similar situation in a batch where
he left the Irish Moss in the fermenter.  I don't believe temperature to be
a factor because he typically brews at about 60 F where I brew at 75 to 80 F.
As another example, a friend of mine experienced excessive foaming out of
the airlock on his 7 gal fermenter (5.5 gal of wort) in a batch in which he
left the Irish Moss, though his fermenter's lid didn't blow off.


Has anyone else had similar experiences ?


I now take care to leave the Irish Moss behind in the brew kettle.


Doug

  I tried a couple of these brews the other day and liked what I tasted.  Has 
anyone out there tried making a stout with oatmeal?  The price on these beers 
was out of sight, so I feel I have at least 2 good reasons to try and brew the stuff
myself.  If anyone out there has a good receipe that they could pass along I'd like
to hear from you.  Also I'm an all grain brewer.

Subject: results with oak chips


        Four to six weeks ago I asked for help in dry hopping and in
using oak chips.  I got one response on dry hopping and none on oak
chips.  So, since it seems that no one has experience in this area I
thought that I would relate mine.


        I added an ounce of Saaz hop pellets and an ounce of oak chips
to the secondary without any sanitation attempts hoping that the yeast
had an insurmountable foothold after a week in the primary (this was
suggested to me by local supplier).  Since my basement is so cold at
this time of year, the secondary fermentation took a week.  Not surpri-
singly the chips floated on top.  However, while siphoning to the bucket
from which I bottle (it has a spigot) the chips were a pain in the neck
since they kept on clogging the siphon tube.  Putting the chips in a hop
bag or some cheesecloth might be a good idea.


        At first the oak flavor was very strong.  Now it does not seem
quite so strong, but it is still a bit overwhelming.  This is supposed to
be a pilsner beer.  This much oak might be appropriate in something
heavier, but here it was too much.  It will probably mellow with age
though.  Next time I will either use fewer chips or add them later.


        The Saaz nose did not come through very much.  Perhaps the honey
(2 lb. honey, 6 lb. Alexander's) balanced it too much.  A fellow brewer
likes it as is but having been to Europe I know true Pilsner Urquell (not
what we get here) has much more of a hop nose to go along with its incredible
smoothness.

Subject: Grain Usage


To Dan Needham. I disagree. Throwing the grains in the last 5 minutes of the 
boil will not provide the same effect. If color and flavor are what you are 
looking for then most people recommend adding the grains to the cold water
(cracked for lighter grains either way for darker ones depending on how much 
color you want) and straining just before the water boils.


The steeping method you used will also allow for at least a partial conversion 
and thus will provide extra fermentable sugars (for unkilned grains, not for 
Crystal, Chocolate, Black Patent or Roasted). The danger in boiling is that you 
extract substances from the husk (tannins I believe) which can make the beer
astringent. While this is desirable for some stouts and/or porters in general
you don't want your beers to be astringent, so I'd advise against boiling.




On Blowoff: I used to do 1 stage without blowoff. Now I always use blowoff. 
I think the beers taste cleaner. From what I understand of yeast chemistry
the stuff that gets blown off is intermediate fermentation by products. These 
substances will eventually consumed by the yeast as food after it runs out
of sugars. Yeast has a 2 track metabolism. In the presence of oxygen it does
a partial fermentation that releases lots of energy to allow reproduction.
After free O2 is depleted it goes to anaerobic fermentation and will consume
any remaing sugar and then the remaining intermediate byproducts until all
the food is gone. This is why big brewers don't use blow-off techniques.
I suggest try it both ways and compare. 


PS Don't get rid of the 7 gallon carbouy. DO blow off in it and if you rack to a
secondary you can leave the sediment behind, otherwise yoiu'll have MORE BEER!!

Subject:      chill haze and spent grains


re:  Using Irish moss to eliminate chill haze


I gave up using Irish moss years ago because I had too many problems with it.
If you are having problems with chill haze, just put your beer in the refridg-
erator for a few days (or sometimes even weeks) before you plan to drink it and
the guilty proteins will settle politely to the bottom of the bottle.  Or,
chill it before you bottle it and you have a nice clear lager beer.


re:  Spent grains as bird seed


I find that the birds in my neighborhood won't touch my spent grains, unless I
have brewed a batch of wheat beer.  Don't ask me why.
