Subject: newsgroup?


In HBD #542 Bill Crick asks the recurring question "Why not turn this into a
newsgroup?"


I do not want to see this happen for purely selfish reasons.  My only unix
access in on my home computer.  The local backbone site has graciously allowed
me uucp access so that I can send and receive mail but refused to give me a
news feed because of the high volume of traffic.


In short, if this becomes a newsgroup, I will be eliminated from participation.
