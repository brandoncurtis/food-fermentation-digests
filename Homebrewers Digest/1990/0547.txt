that's "kraeusened" (ae = a umlaut)  If you really want to get back to our
roots, get a copy of Jackson's big book.  In it there is a reproduction of
the Reinheitsgebot as it was originally written--complete in the original
hand-written Fraktur, archaic spellings, and all.  I think it's fascina-
ting--the world's first consumer-protection law!  I'll try a transcription
here; anyone who wants to send corrections can do so and I'll incorporate
them.  (Note that I'm transcribing what's written; I'm *not* trying to
update the spelling or fix even some obvious errors!  For example, I'm
fairly sure that "kainem" below would be "keinem", and I can't make a
better transcription than "nithallten" based on what I see.)

Punctuation was different in those days, obviously.  I've copied in the /es
as they appear; they substitute for comma and some other things.  Period
exists, but not semicolon as far as I see.


The important part is the "allain Gersten...wasser" which is "only malt,
hops, and water".  I'm not going to attempt a complete translation, but the
following sentence (Welher aber...) starts out with an ominous "But whoever
this of our orders knowingly disobeys..."


Do we have any German scholars out there?  It's clear my high-school German
(vintage mid-'60's) just isn't up to the task!


Come to think of it, if we could clean this up I'd be willing to make some
single-page posters of it.  I've got a Fraktur font handy.  Not sure how we
would distribute it, but we'll figure that out.  It's probably OK to make
copies.  (After > 450 years, the copyright has probably expired.:-)

        There is nothing wrong with using those bottles that I know of.  As
a matter of fact I used two the last time I bottled.  If you get the right
type it can be capped with a standard capper.  Just check to see if it has 
a lip like the beer bottles.  Otherwise corks of one type or another will
work.  You may want to get some wire tie-downs just in case.  As far as
pressure is concerned, no problem.  Any champaign I've ever had has a lot
more pressure than any beer I've ever had.


        The only other thing I can think of is the size of the bottle.  They
hold twice as much or more than a standard bottle.  I would use those bottles
when serving a group as I don't like resealing any sort of carbonated
beverage container.  I don't like it when the beverage goes flat.

Subject: Long Fermentation -- Autolysis?


I'm relaxed and not worrying, but I'd also like some advice. :-)


My current batch is a brown ale with two cans of John Bull Amber, a pound
of crystal steeped at 175 degrees for 25 minutes (I now know that was too
high), hop pellets, and Wyeast German Ale yeast.  SG 1.036.  I started the
yeast in a champaign bottle half filled with wort and pitched all the liquid
when it had a couple of inches of foam on the top.  I pitched at 70 degrees
and the temperature has remained constant since then.


I left it in a closed plastic fermenter (no bubbling, probably because
the lid doesn't seal perfectly) for four days, and then I racked it to
a carboy.  SG 1.018.  (Since then I've finished Miller's book and am
resolved to try single-stage fermentation in an acid carboy.)  The beer
in the primary was covered with gooey plasticky mustard-colored stuff.
I left this top layer and the bottom layer of trub/dead yeast behind.


The medium-brown beer started bubbling away happily in the carboy at a
rate of about one ever 5-10 seconds.  Within a day an inch of sandy
sediment (dead yeast, I assume) had accumulated.  Seven days have passed
since the racking and it's still bubbling about once every 10 seconds.
The layer of yeast is now almost two inches high, and the beer is dark-brown.


What should I do?  Miller warns that autolysis of yeast can be a problem
with high pitching rates and high temperature.  Could that be what's
happening now?  Or is it reasonable to believe that there's still fermentable
stuff (other than spent yeast) in the beer?

How could such pleading go unrewarded?  I have in front of me a book
entitled "Hofbrau Munchen 1589-1989", really just an extended bit of
marketing hype for HB, but it includes such things as a color photo of
the Rheinheitsgebot of 1516.  I hope you will pardon any typos I add

...sigh....
  it seems like this issue won't die, so I feel I have to regretfully add
my two cents worth.
  1) many salutations to Rob Gardner for impeccable management of the
     digest.  Benevolant dictators are hard to find, and worth their
     weight in gold.
  2) I agree with *all* the various stated reasons for keeping the digest
     as is, most strongly:  "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", and "I've
     got work to do -- a digest a day is barely ok, a constant stream of
     interruptions isn't".
  3) I fully agree and endorse Rob's decision to leave well enough alone.
  4) I wish Dave Sill would shut up so we can go back to discussing brewing.
     I hereby grant Rob full endorsement to censor additional discussion on
     this issue (including this message if he wants).
Sorry to waste your time folks.  Dave - if you want to flame me, do it 
directly, and don't clutter up the digest.  You can find me at
the address below.
   Speaking of brewing...
I finally gave up on my last two kegs of brew (partial mash split into a
red bitter and stout).  The Edme yeast infection got them, and I kept hoping
that it would settle down and be drinkworthy, but by now it tastes like
jet fuel with porcupine piss.  I just got enough grain for another batch
of bitter, and I'll probably use Whitbread.  One of these days, I might
even give up my anarchic ways and switch to liquid cultures, but I can't
seem to plan ahead enough.  Questions:
  1) does anybody out there have a recommendation for a good Wyeast to use
     for a first try in a red bitter?
  2) has anybody tried the Mt. Hood hops mentioned in the special issue of
     Zymurgy?  (I haven't seen it in any of the local stores).

I have a bit of experience here, and I have found that to make a good
tasting doppelbock (for example, like Salvator from Paulaner), you do
have to boil to concentrate your extract.  You can find my recipe for
such a doppelbock in the latest Zymurgy, but beware-the recipe is for
15 gallons, not 5.  I boiled 19 gallons I collected from sparging for
3.5 hours to get down to 13 gallons (biggest size I can handle at the
end of the boil) and then added water in the primary to reach 15 gal.
of wort.


The English have a different approach, at least for barleywines.  They
make two beers from one mash by making the barleywine from exclusively
the first runnings from the lauter tun, and make a mild from what ever
is left over.  Brewers are thrifty people and do not easily throw away
extract.  Be creative!

Elitist?  You bet!  Signal to noise ratio is VERY important to me.  I have a
job that takes up alot of my time.  If I'm going to read this stuff, I want
it to be chock full of real beer information.  If somebody is not an expert
brewer, but they want to post about brewing, I have no problem reading that.
There's a good chance I'll learn from that person (whether they're an expert
or not).  However, flamefests, run-on threads that are only vaguely related
to brewing, and non-related postings are a MAJOR irritant.  I'm sorry that
I'm contributing to the noise by responding on this issue! (1/2 ;-)


ObBrew:
Well, my last all grain batch (my fourth ever) is a success!  I always heard
(and objectively agreed) that all grain brewing gave more control and made
better beer.  My first attempts, however, disproved this.  I stuck with it,
though.  Now, my latest batch is as good as an extract beer!  That may not
sound like much to the experts but it's a big deal for me.  I think I'm
finally getting over the learning curve.  The areas I had the most trouble
with were temperature control and efficient sparging.

There was a really good article in a past Zymurgy regarding brewing with 
maple sap instead of water. I believe it also had some recipes that utilized
maple syrup along with the article.


RE: Butterscotch. My guess is you've got excess diacetyl. This is typically
linked to the yeast strain. I would suggest having a look at the Zymurgy
troubleshooting special issue from 2 or so years ago. Yeast strain and
fermenting temperaturres can cause excess diacetyl production. Perhaps
you can e-mail me more specifics regarding the brewing process and 
indgredients and I can make a suggestion

REGARDING                Maple flavors
In HBD #546, jessiman`at`kepler.harvard.edu (Alec Jessiman) asks about using maple
syrup to accent beer flavors.


I have tried to get the flavor of maple syrup into several beers I have brewed
without success.  I first tried, as Alec has, by adding a cup or so to the
boil.  Next I tried using maple syrup as my priming sugar, this worked well as
far as carbonation was concerned but did not impart any detectable flavor.  My
last attempt was to get a "pure" maple extract, intended as a flavoring agent,
and add that to the secondary.  Still no maple character was evident.  All of
the brews I have tried this with have been fairly heavy beers.  I thought that
the maple would do a nice job of enhancing an oatmeal stout, however it is
possible that the stout simply overpowered the maple.  Perhaps Alec's attempt
with a fairly light ale which is also lightly hopped will determine if the
maple character is transferable at all, then we'll build from there.  Let us
know how it turns out!

I haven't made one yet but I have tasted an excellent one brewed by fellow

place in Bock at the AHA conference, for which he got a trip to Norway.  The

The Zymurgy Special Hops issue also has articles on the the history of hops,
hop varieties, growing hops, calculating hop bitterness, hop utilization,
matching hops with beer styles, and hop oils.

I enjoy reading the digest with my morning brew, getting buches of articles

newsgroup traffic is not available on the Internet and that would leave me an

In Germany, a beer that is called wheat beer must contain at least 50%
malted wheat.  The description of the category for the AHA national

wheat malt.

        I brewed my 1st two batches of beer this last weekend using the
        single stage- blowout type system and have several questions.


        The beer was a lager style, 1 Emde beer kit and 1 Cooper beer kit.


        The temperature of the beer was 75 F when I pitched the yeast.
        The room temperature where I put the carboys varies from 65-70 F.
        After 24 hours active fermantation started But I never had a 
        blowout occur---Why Not??


        The level of the beer in the carboy was up to the outside shoulder.


        The foam got up to the carboy neck but never out of it.
        Was the temp. too cold?
        Did I not put enough water in the carboy?? it was a 5 gal. carboy.
        All of the nasty brown stuff has dried on the carboy glass at the
        top.
        I need some advice.. Any thoughts on what I may not have done right?
        Any comments would be appreciated.

My notes from the AHA Brew-In at Anchor Brewing, on the occasion of the AHA 
National Conference back on June 16, identify the following hops for Anchor:


    Liberty:    Cascade
    Porter:     Northern Brewer (3 separate additions of hops)
    Steam(tm):  Northern Brewer


We participated in their brewing--and boil-over[* :-) ]--of their Porter.  
The first addition of hops used what I now remember as a food-grade 
container much bigger than the plastic 10-gallon fermenter I have at home--
so maybe maybe it was a 20 or 25-gallon container--most-of-the-way-full with 
whole hops.  That's about as quantitative as I was able to be, operating on 
the understanding that it is acceptable brewery-touring etiquette to ask 
the variety of hops for a beer, but *not* the amount used.  
One of the brewers did say that their Steam is brewed in a 120-barrel batch; 
the porter is brewed in an approx. 75-barrel batch. 


[*] Evidence, perhaps, that boil-overs happen even to the pros.
Of course, they were were deluged with questions from the masses of 
homebrewers participating in the Brew-In.


Old Foghorn on draught at the brewery was a nice way of mellowing out from 
the 2 big mugs of coffee drank on the way up to that early-in-the-day event.

One thing you're overlooking is that the Homebrew Digest is *not*
moderated!! I do absolutely no editing of submissions to increase
signal-to-noise ratio. We can thank the submitters for the quality
here! Can any other unmoderated group claim such a high snr?

I haven't heard any complaints from the readers/participants. I
ignored those advantages because I didn't know of any.


Let's end this discussion. The people have spoken, and I hear them
saying leave it alone. (Should we have a vote?!?)  So I won't have
anything to do with newsgroups.  If somebody else wants to do it,
there's nothing I can do to stop it.  If the noise level increases too
much, then the digest will choke to death.

I am an extract brewer, but I made what I call an American Wheat
Beer this summer and loved it.  I used the Williams wheat extract
which I believe is 60% wheat and 40% barley.  Made a very nice
beer.

Thanks for all the comments on travelling, most were informative, and that
fiasco that Pete Soper put up with is almost funny.  Will Roger's pointed out
that "Everything is funny as long as it is happening to somebody else."


The fact that some officials do not know the ruling leads me to ask:
Where is it written that it is OK?  Does anybody know?
Being armed with chapter and verse should be enough to smooth out any wrinkles.
But hey, I'm not worrying, I'll just get to the airport extra early in case of
a snag.

Over the thanksgiving vacation i traveled back to DC with my last two
bottles of my Porter, and I can back with a friends two bottles of a
Bass Ale type concotion he was making. I had no problems both times,
and to me that was the least of my worries....


At times, i have gone to bars that sell local micro brews, bought cases
of beer, and then managed to get a good 12 pack into my backpack and
onto the plane with minimal of problems. 


Carry the Homebrew book with you. It's the best excuse if you're
carrying unmarked bottles. And relax, airport security is looking for
hyper paranoid terrorists, not relaxed homebrewers. attitude and
appearance is 90% of it.

            Portland Brewing Co. - A 4500 barrel plant, and one of my
    favorite.  They have some uniquie methods of brewing, talk to the
    Brew-master if you can, a soft-spoken, but very knowledgable person.
    They make:
            Portland Ale
            Oregon Dry
            Timberline Ale
            Grant's Ale (hmm, same name as a brewer in Washington, but
                    probably a different product)
            Grant's Imperial Stout
            Grant's Winter Ale


No, this the same brew as at the Grant's in Yakima, Washington. I've
asked them about that, and they said they received a liscence to brew the
stuff from Grant himself (?). Someone comes down regularly
(unannounced!) and checks the quality themselves. This is how i found
out about the brewery in Yakima three years ago.

NewsGroups time: Everyone will put in there three cents about
signal/noise ratios, news software vs. mail software, people who don't
have news access, etc. etc. I easily can deal with most things, but i 
usually find people preferring mail as a happier medium. Most newsgroups
tend to have threads of messgaes that are longer and less interesting as
time goes on.


The main criteria for a newsgroup is that the person who runs the list
is getting hassled by "the man" to stop it, or no one wants to do it. 
Perhaps one way to lighten the load for the HP machines is to have
reflectors around the country to spread out the net traffic down. I'm
sure there's many a person who could volunteer some cpu time to this.
perhaps this is already being done.


i don't like newsgroups, but i dislike the snobbish anti-newsgroup attitude 
worse.  A monthly posting to rec.food.drink about homebrew-digest is a
good idea.

        Ah... The age old problem of shooting at a moving target.  As this
seems to have come up once or twice before, allow me to shed some light
on the subject of Weiss and Weizen.  


        In northern Germany, a Weiss (white) beer is produced using three
parts barley to one part wheat.  This is often refered to as a
Berliner Weisse and is a low gravity (8 degrees baling or 1.032) top
fermented beer that undergoes a second lactic fermentation.  The beer
is brewed warm (68F) and conditioned at the same sort of temperature.
It is a very fruity beer consumed (usually) during the summer months.
It is often drunk with a schuss (dash of rasbery syrup) or Waldmeister
(essence of woodruff).  It strikes me that all of the recipes in
TCJoHB are aimed at this style, though they leave out the lactic
fermentation (as most folks don't have a good source of pure
lactobacillus, presumably). 


        Weizenbiers (wheat beer), on the other had, are brewed in the south
of Germany.  These are high gravity (13 degrees balling or 1.052) top
fermented beers that are lightly hopped.  These beers are brewed with
somewhere between one third and three quarters malted wheat.  They are
fermented with a special yeast that is a combination of traditional
ale yeast and Saccharomyces delbrekia (sp?).  Wyeast produces just
such a yeast for the home brewer, though I don't have the number
handy.  The Suddeutche Weizen is often served with a slice of lemon
(the Mexicans Yuppies didn't invent it! :-)) to bring out the fruity
flavors of the Weizenbier.  Some brewers filter out the yeast from
their Weizenbier, but it is traditional to consume the beer with the
yeast, which imparts more fruity flavors to the taste.  In some
places, a canister (not unlike a squeeze mustard bottle) of yeast is
available so that you can *add* yeast to your beer should you so desire.


        I have brewed Weizenbier at home and had good results.  I am
an extract brewer (not enought space for all grain... yet!) and have
had good luck with both the Wyeast strain and the Ireks Arkady (sp?)
extract.  This is sold in 3 kilo containers and thus you may not want
to use a full container in a five gallon batch.


        Hope this helps.


                                        Steve.

My housemates and I have been thinking about starting to brew our own
beer for a while now and when my Dad asked me what I wanted for
christmas I saw my opportunity!


I've talked to some people here in Pittsburgh (I'm in school in
Pittsburgh, my Dad lives in Allentown) who homebrew so I have a good
idea of what I need, however I don't know where to tell my dad to go to
find brewing supplies near Allentown, PA.


so, if anyone knows of a reputable place near allentown, please reply!
also, if anyone wants to give me any advice on how to go about starting
this endeavor, I'd appreciate that too!
