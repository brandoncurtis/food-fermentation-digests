Howdy, homebrewers --


I'm moving to Columbia, MO real soon and am wondering if anyone out there can 
tell me about the beer scene there.  (I was glad to read in the last Zymurgy 
that Dave Miller had helped push a brewpub bill through the MO state 
legislature -- no small feat in the land of Bud, I'm sure.  Thanks, Dave.)  
Any info. on grain/hops suppliers, homebrew clubs, and stores for buying 
quality commercial beers would be greatly appreciated.


Many thanks for the specs on Liberty Ale.


Happy brewing,
Tim Holtsford

What I've heard down here in Miami is that Guinness here is actually
brewed in the Bahamas. It doesn't say on the label where it is from. The
labels here in Florida are different from labels on Guinness in North
Carolina, I've noticed. The back label here is the bulldog, with the
slogan in spanish. It's nearly identical to the labels I saw on Guinness
in Spain, except in Spain I was only able to find Guinness in cans.

Another method that seems to be working for me right now is an electric blanket
wrapped around the carboys.  I have two 5 gallons fermenting along very nicely
and both seem quite happy to have the blanket.  I've set the setting on "2".
Any lower didn't seem to have a noticable effect.  The carboys are still cool
to the touch, though I haaven't measured the actual temperature.  Maybe I'll
do that this weekend!  


Next time I'll just light a little fire and play some classical music to keep
those yeasties happy! :)  Celebrate the holidays and remember to RELAX!

One correction.  The towels which would draw the heated water would probably
end up COOLING the carboy instead of warming it (especially in the cool
room you are describing).  As the water in the towels evaporates, it will
take a large portion of the heat with it (just like the sweat on our
skin).  You can use the tub, water and towels in the summer to cool your
carboy, however.  I recommend ommitting the towels for heating.  Another
thing to consider is that if you cover the carboy, tub, and heater with a
plastic bag (as I do to keep light off the beer) the water evaporating
from the tub will condense on the inside of the plastic bag.  If the bag
hangs over the outside of the tub, the water will drip on the floor.


I've heard of another method for keeping beer a little warmer than room
temp: a light bulb.  Someone (on this digest) said they use a box
(I don't recall cardboard or wood) that they cover the carboy with and
put a light bulb inside the box.  Two problems with this idea: 1) the
light could cause the beer to become "light struck" (for an example
of light struck beer, I suggest Heineken -- almost every bottle I've had
has been light struck) or 2) fire hazard.


I realize that I haven't proposed a useful solution, but maybe you
could come up with one with the above suggestions plus some of your
own.

Subject: Guiness and Nitrogen


Recently there have been some expressions of surprise in the HBD about
the use of nitrogen to produce the amazing head of draught Guinness.  I
have no doubt that it is true.  I've seen it mentioned in several
brewing books, and the video that Jim Homer described provides further
confirmation.


But I get the impression that some of the posters on the subject don't
exactly understand what the purpose of the nitrogen is.  Here is my
understanding of that:


1.  Guinness is *not* "carbonated with nitrogen".  It is carbonated
    with CO2.  You can apply all the nitrogen pressure you want to a
    beer, but that's not going to make it fizzy.  The reason is that
    nitrogen will not dissolve in beer.  Hence, as Jim Homer pointed
    out, a mixture of nitrogen and CO2 is used.


2.  I believe that the legendary Guinness head is accomplished
    primarily by blasting the beer out of the tap at high pressure.
    That's where the nitrogen comes in.  If they stored the beer under
    high CO2 pressure, too much of the CO2 would dissolve in the beer,
    and the beer would end up uselessly fizzy.  So nitrogen is used to
    provide the high pressure for a violent delivery from the draught
    system, without making the beer itself too fizzy.


3.  If you are a kegger and don't mind wasting some CO2 (it's not
    exactly a precious resource) you can get much the same effect at
    home without the nitrogen.  Store the beer at your usual pressure.
    When you are ready to serve a brew or two, crank the CO2 pressure
    way up.  Draw off the brews at high pressure and you'll get a great
    head, just like Guinness.  Then, bleed off some CO2 to reduce the
    pressure back to the normal storage levels.


As long as we're talking about Guinness, here's another interesting
tidbit, from CJoHB, p. 177:


    The only character that this recipe [for a Guinness pretender] is
    lacking is the unique "tang" that the real stuff has.  The Guinness
    Brewery achieves its tang by actually adding a small amount (3
    percent) of pasteurized soured beer to all of its stouts around the
    world.


Interesting, eh?

Subject: Re: SG and fermentation


st. stephen writes:

>higher than the ones specified in the book.


The final SG depends mostly on your yeast and the amount of
non-fermentables in your wort.  Different yeast strains
have different attenuations.  A highly attenuative yeast
will eat more sugars and produce a lower Final Gravity (FG)
whereas a less attenuative yeast will give you a higher FG.


If you are mashing, then you have control of your enzyme activity.
There are two main enzymes in barley that break the comples
carbohydrates down into simpler carbohydrates.  The longer you
let this enzyme activity go on, the more complex carbs will be
converted to simple carbs.  Back to the yeasts.  Different yeasts
are capable of eating various complexities of carbohydrates
(i.e. some can only eat the simplest sugars like glucose, some can
eat more complex ones).  So now you've got a particular strain of
yeast swimming around in your wort munching the sugars that it
can -- the ones it can't it leaves behind.  The ones left behind
contribute to the FG.


Proteins in your beer also add to the FG.  Finings (like Irish Moss)
will precipitate out some (much ?) of the proteins and reduce the FG.


When you buy malt extract, the percentage of non-fermentable sugars,
proteins and starch is already set for you.  Unless you do a partial
mash, or add finings, you won't change it's fermentable/non-fermentable
ratio.  Different manufacturers have different ratios, but they tend to
be pretty consistent.


Notice that some people have noticed their beers getting drier and
gradually overcarbonate after a few months in the bottle.  This is
most often caused by a bacterial infection (most commonly Lactobacillus).
The bacteria can eat (or cut into simpler carbs for the yeast to eat)
the sugars left behind by the primary fermentation.

Depends on the yeast.  I've had Muntona (Munton and Fison) yeast ferment
out in 7 days at 72F.  Whereas I've currently got a batch of Bitter
(3.3lbs Edme DMS and 3lbs M&F Light Dried Malt Extract) with Wyeast
American Ale at 65F which started at 66 glubs per minute on day 2,
still going at 32 glubs per minute 11 days later.  I guestimate that
it should not be bottled (or kegged in my case) for at least two more
weeks.  If visible fermentation (glubs) has stopped and you are at a
resonable FG (+/- a couple of points) wait an extra day or two and
then go ahead.


Alcohol level can kill yeast also.  Some yeasts are bred for a high
alcohol tolerance, some just can't handle it.  Beer reaches a particular
alcohol level and, boom, the yeast kicks off.


If you are using grains of any kind, sparging efficiency can affect
your OG (original gravity) and thus move your FG proportionately.


I just thought of another factor that could give you an *apparent* higher FG.
If your beer goes through a temperature shock (a sudden 10F change is more
than enough for some yeasts) it can either die or go dormant.


Oops, one more factor!  Oxygen in the wort.  If you don't sufficiently
aerate your wort (after it cools to below 80F (to minimize oxidation))
your yeast could run out of oxygen during respiration and all the
above factors could affect them more.


>what could be done to make it ferment to a lower SG?
Primarily, the yeast strain (there are attenuation listings for Wyeast
- -- ask your distributor for a copy) and the fermentable/non-fermentable
ratio.

I noticed when I toured Sierra Nevada's brewery that they also use an open

This is my favorite Beer on the planet!  It is an ale, and at about 8%
alchohol, must be drunk not too cold.  It is the tastiest when it is
not so cold.  In Chicago, you can get it for about $9 a 4 pack, but
drinking 4 of them is like drinking 8 of other stuff.


I cannot comment too much on how it is made,  on the bottle it says it has
been brewed since 1701 by the Moortgat Family, whole flower Styrian and
Saaz hops and premium 2-row barley.


About a year ago I was in Amsterdam visiting a friend, who is quite a
beer collector and he was turning me on to all these rare Belgium
beers.  One of them which was very interesting called Lefebure from the
Abbay Bonne Esperanes, from the city of Quenas.  But that is a tough

Subject: Water Treatment


  Hello.  I've just been looking at my water analysis and spent quite a long
time figuring it out, so I thought I'd comment on the water analysis given
in the previous HBD.  Alkalinity should represent temporary hardness.
Hardness represents total hardness.  To get permanent hardness subtract
alkalinity from hardness (in you case 137.1 - 94.72 = 42.38).  This would
be quite low for a pale ale.  Also your calcium level is quite low
(40 something if I remember).  For a pale ale I would add at least 1
teaspoon of gypsum (maybe even 1 1/2 or 2).  You could also add a little
bit of magnesium sulphate to get your magnesium level up to between
15 and 25 ppm (be careful with this stuff, though.  Even a little too
much will make the beer unpalatable -- I speak from experience).  For a
stout, you may want to add about 1/2 teaspoon of calcium carbonate and
half a teaspoon of calcium sulphate.  Note that I have very little
experience with water treatment, but your water supply is fairly similar
to mine and I have spent the last few days trying to figure out what I
should do.  My sources are Gary Bauer's article on recipe formulation in
the all-grain special issue of Zymugry, Dave Miller's book "The Complete
Handbook of Home Brewing", Dave Line's book "The Big Book of Brewing", and
George Fix's book "Principles of Brewing Science".

Some random thoughts:


I bought an electronic ph meter for $40 from Edmund Scientific and it works
great. It claims an accuracy of .2ph. I used it last weekend and it beats the
hell out of using papers.


I'm making my first Lager and I think I've screwed up a little. I chilled my
wort down to 45F and pitched my dry Whitbread Lager yeast and set the carboy
outside (55F). After almost a week there has been almost no activity. My local
homebrew shop says to warm it up and keep it warm until fermentation stops. I'm
planning to warm it up for a few days, see if fermentation starts then put it
back outside when things are cranking. What's the correct proceedure?


A friend that went to Japan brought me a can of Asahi "live" beer. I believe
this means it has yeast in the can. I'm not a yeast culturer yet, but I wonder
if anyone has heard of this before. Is it worth saving?


That's all...

With the holidays just around the bend, and the year coming to an end, this
seems like a good time to get current on what was published in 1990
concerning yeast, fermentation, brewing and beer.  I was really tempted to put
in an entry for _The Encyclopedia Brewmania_ with myself as the author, but I'm
not quite finished with it :-)  On a more serious note, if the listing says
"available through PUBNET", your local book store can probably use that fact to

From: bnrgate!bnr-rsc!crick`at`uunet.UU.NET (Bill Crick)
Subject: Clarity, temp,stills


A few humble comments on the last few days:


Clarity and Irish Moss.:I don't know of anything better.
          Issinglass finings: I use gelatin finings which work fine.
                             I usually add 1/2 tsp when I rack to secondary,
                            and 1/2 tsp in with priming sugar when I bottle
                           Adding them at bottling helps create a good solid 
                          sediment, making the beer easier to pour clear.


Cappers: I've capped about 5000 bottles with my "wingnut and Spring in the 
        middle capper". It has chomped about 5 bottles. It does need a bit of
       grease inside the cup every once in a while to stop it from sticking
      on the capped bottle. As for the adjustment, I've played with it, and
     seen no effect? What is is supposed to do?


Stills: The inverted lid, and floating bowl still was used in rural France 
       to make your basic brandy from wine.
      The pressure cooker, and copper coils stills work. Snow makes a good
     cooling medium for the coil. NB: I've never tried this, but have
    witnessed the operation of one and tasted the results. WWWHHHoooaaaaa!


Temperature: MrMike: I do almost all of my brewing at 45F to 55F. I do usually
            start the fermentation at 70F. Even for ale yeast this will work, 
           but you have to be a bit more patient. Its great for lagers.


Starting kit: Sounds good. You'll buy more toys as you go on, but it sounds
             like you have the basics there. I'd avoid plastic carboys because
            you can't see what is going on, and its harder to tell if they are
           clean.


Grain Brewing: Quote from a friend last weekend while brewing "HotRod Ale":
               
              "You know you are an all grain brewer when you buy your 
               second bottle of iodine!"
