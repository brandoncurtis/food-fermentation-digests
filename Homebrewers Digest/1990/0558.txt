Except that your basic US tap is not designed to deliver fluids at high
pressure/flow rates.  I think the Guinness method is dependent upon the
unique tap which was described by someone else, which is capable of
controlling the flow rate and aeration of the beer as it is dispensed.  This
would help ensure that you get some beer along with a wonderful head.

I checked the spreadsheet I've been using for some time for estimating
mashing - I used 0.24 per pound per U.S. gallon, or 0.125 per kg per liter.
Incidentally, either those numbers came from Papazian, or from measurement.


So add me as another who can't get 0.30 extraction!

I also have been mashing in a Coleman 5 gal water cooler. I usually mash around
155 degrees, if my memory is correct I use about 1 qt of water per pound of
2 row malt. Again if my memory is correct, about 2 quarts of sparge water
per pound of grain. My malt has been precrushed by Stienbart's. I'm getting 7 
points per pound.


Stienbarts malt get's down to around 60 cents a pound if you buy enough, can't
remember how much is enough.

Subject: Extract rate




Well, I tried some of the beer that "suffered" from an extract rate of 
.026.  It's extremely nice; in fact, here's the recipe (my own):


    6 lbs. 2-row Klages
    3 lbs. wheat malt
    1 lb. dextrin malt ("Cara-pils", as Miller calls it)
    7 AAU Tettnanger
    3 AAU Kent Goldings
    1.5 ozs Saaz (added at end of boil)
    Chimay yeast (of course)
    2/3 cup priming sugar


    Mash water: 14 quarts
    Mash-in 135 dF
    Mash pH: 5.4 (tough to get that low...)
    Protein rest: 30 min
    Starch conversion: 2 hrs at 145-152 dF
    Mash-out: 5 min,. at 168 dF
    Sparge water: 5 gal., 168 dF, pH 5.7
    
    Boil about 90 min. (you get a lot more thanm 5 gallons...)
    Hops: Tettnanger & Goldings, 1 hour before end of boil
          Saaz at end of boil


    Original gravity: 1.053
    Terminal gravity: 1.004


The ferment went about a week and a half.  I added 3 tbsp. Polyclar and
3 tbsp. bentonite slurry (as per Miller) and let it sit in the
secondary for 2 weeks.  It was a little cloudy at bottling, but is
stunningly clear now.  The Chimay yeast has tucked itself very nicely
into the beer; I had thought it would be quite pronounced.


I'll be making another made-up recipe with wheat soon, and this time
I'll use 6-row.  I'll keep you posted...

Subject: It's worse than that, he's dead Jim.


Upon my cousin's urging, I'm trying to culture Chimay yeast.
This is my first attempt at culturing from a bottle and I
would like some advice.  How long should it take to see
activity (i.e. when do I give up and start again)?  How
old (young) should the bottle be (i.e. "don't even bother
if the bottle is X or more months old")?


I've got a bottle of Jan `90 Chimay (the cork has the date
stamped on it "0190") sitting at home, on which I am about to
give up.  I have decanted the beer, added cooled, aerated wort
(~1/4 cup of light dried malt extract boiled in 8 oz of water)
and topped with a airlock.

Subject: Partial Mash










>I don't do partial mashes for exactly this reason.


If you're making extract only beer you should try partial mashes.
Whether with malt not requiring mashing (dark malts, crystal) or
malts that do (munich, pale, lager, klages etc).


>I feel that the added work provides little, if any,
>benefit.  What are other brewer's feelings on this?


First adding grains even 1 lb greatly aids in head retention.  There are
additional flavor complexities you add to beer that as far as I can tell
come only from *freshly* mashed grain.  I've made both all extract and 
partial mash and they're both good, but the partial mash is superior.
The latest example of a partial mash that I've made is "A Taste of Autumn"
(Papazian's recipe in I believe the last summers issue of zymurgy. Perhaps
the fall issue).  This recipe calls for toasted klages malt, only 0.5 lbs.
The malt was toasted in the oven at 350 for 15 to 20 min and then mashed with
a number of other malts (about 5 lbs).
The result is an underlying toasty flavor that I doubt
could be duplicated with extract only.  By the way anyone considering this
recipe definately should try it.  It is really good.

Subject: Irish Moss and Good Head (Retention)


Nonsense Ted, I have been making extract beers for years and have always
used Irish Moss as a fining agent, and have only rarely experienced
poor head retention, which due to the large number of batches I have
brewed using Irish Moss, I would say is unrelated. I think that 2 trials
is far too limited a sample to give up on such a useful additive.


Head retention is a result of trace minerals which effect the surface 
tension of the resulting beer, and of the health of the yeast which 
helps to create many of these elements by breaking down compounds
which are derived from the grains (I believe the larger proteins in
particular). While Irish Moss will take many of the proteins that
would otherwise form colloidal suspensions out of solution, I'm sure
that the quantities remaining are sufficient to form propoer heads
on the beer, otherwise how could I or anyone else who uses Irish Moss
regularly ever have gotten a beer with a good head on it??


I would suspect that the health of your yeast is a factor. While a yeast
may be viable during early fermentation it may tend to grow weak in later
stages, the result can be undercarbonated beers, and/or beers with poor
head retention. I would recommend that before you abandon Irish Moss,'
which I have found to be an excellent fining (as well as allowing your
beers to remain completely vegetarian, this is important to my brother)
that you try adding some yeast nutrient or heading agent. These two 
things are approximately the same thing, giveor take one or two ingredients.
They add trace elements that are important for healthy yeast that 
may not be derived from the mashing process (wherever that is being done).

Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that beers are required to list where
they're brewed. Like I pointed out with Guinness, it says imported, but
it doesn't say anywhere on the bottle "canada" or "bahamas". Obviously
the importing company is trying to imply that it is coming all the way
from Ireland.

Subject: Guiness Dispensing


Completely by accident, well, I was ordering a 40 quart SS pot,
I stumbled upon "GUINESS/BASS EQUIPMENT  Tapping equipment for
imported cooperage."  It's on pg. 33 of the Rapids 1990 catalog.
John Polstra recently wrote that Guiness is actually dispensed
*differently* rather than just with a different propellant.
This catalog entry seems to support John.  Here it is:


                                 1-24                25+
(A) 2-G-483 Guiness Tap                $ 68.00                $66.50
(B) 2-G-461 Bass Tap, Brass          68.00                 66.50
(C) 2-G-494 Guiness Flow
            Control Faucet         135.00                130.00

The A, B and C refer to the pictures.  A and B are the apparatus
that attach hoses to the kegs.  C looks like a normal beer faucet
except for two differences: 1) the outlet of the faucet is longer
than normal and tapers, and 2) there appears to be an adjustment (?)
knob of some sort just above the outlet.  Oops -- divide those prices
by two.  Rapids prints list prices and then sells for half of that.

Thanks to Stephan Mahan <mahan_stephen`at`lanmail.ncsc.navy.mil> for
his informative posting in HBD #557 about carbonation and the
solubility of gases in water.  His explanation about the reversible
formation of carbonic acid was particularly interesting.


Stephen contradicted my earlier statement that nitrogen is insoluble in
water, writing:


> Gases, in general, are soluble in liquids.  The partial pressure of the

I should have known better than to make the unequivocal statement that
nitrogen is "insoluble in water."  What I should have said was that
nitrogen is much less soluble than CO2.  My CRC handbook lists the
solubility of CO2 in 0 degree C water at 171.3, while that of nitrogen
is 2.33.  [The units are cubic centimeters (cc) of gas per 100 cc of
water.  I don't really understand how they can use volumetric
measurements such as these for compressible gases.  But anyway, the
units for nitrogen and CO2 are the same, so we can compare them to one
another.]  So, compared to CO2, nitrogen is *relatively* insoluble in
water -- less soluble by a factor of about 75.

Subject: Mashing: Surprising Facts


I got the privilege of a somewhat extended interview this afternoon with
a very successful and well-known pub brewer.  A couple of the things we
discussed, I think, are worthy of bringing before this group, partly for
their informational value, and partly because they might prove to start
some discussion. 


First, he told me that in "most" brewpubs today, because of the cost of
equipment to do it otherwise, that mashing is done as  single-step
infusion.  It wouldn't matter whether ale or lager malts: because
there's no easy way to change the temperature once the mash-in has been
done, hot water is added to the grist, the grist is stirred, and once
conversion has been achieved, the sparge is done.  This certainly goes
against what I've learned in terms of multiple-stage rests, protein
rests, acid rests, and the like for lagers.  Do any of the others of you
out there know differently?  If *he* can be limited this way and sell
tons of beer that most consider really tasty, what do we amateurs gain
from our complicated mash schedules, decoctions, etc.?  It's really got
me wondering. 


The other thing he said that stuck with me was that, relatively
speaking, there's something *wrong* with fermentations that don't come
to their conclusions within what I'd consider pretty short periods of
time.  Depending on temp, 3-4 days for ales and 6-7 days for
cold-fermented lagers.  He said that these "slow brews" we live with
(and occasionally brag about :-)) are actually stuck fermentations, due
in the main to inadequate oxidation of the cold wort ahead of pitching. 
I have always been bothered by batches that seem to take weeks to
ferment out (I check with a hydrometer, and concur with those who
recommend that beginners have one) and have been pursuing exactly that
avenue in dealing with them.  What do the rest of you know/think?
