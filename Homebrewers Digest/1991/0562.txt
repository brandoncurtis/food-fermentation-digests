I've also experienced underaged beer at brewpubs. Particularly the
Commonwealth Brewery in Boston, where the tap beers--all five(?) of
them--taste raw and grainy. It's seems to be worse on busy Friday or
Saturday nights (when they are pouring the stuff out as fast as they
can?) The bottled stuff they sell on site and in stores (Golden Export)
is quite good, though.

Does anyone know a) what the FAA regulations are on transporting alcohol,
in particular homebrew, which of course has no label or liquor stamp, and
b) if the regs prohibit homebrew's transport, how one can circumvent these
(short of bribery, as I am poor) restraint of relaxation.
Please help!

Now I am noone's straightlaced stuffed-shirt, but I do know a little about
Army regulations and the Saudi customs.  I would tell Cathy Young's friend
to forget about setting up a still in The Sandbox.  A still itself is illegal
anywhere, especially on a military reservation.  In a host country that
absolutely prohibits the mere presence of alcohol, let alone production
capability, the offense becomes significantly more serious.
If her friend does build this still, and gets caught, he might be home much
sooner than originally scheduled.
Very rarely this serious,

I was wondering whether anyone could help me out with a question ?
After mashing for a long while we, the fairview brewing cartel, 
perform a starch test on the mash. We find that when we add 
iodine to the wort we obtain a negative result, indicating a 
lack of starch. If we place the iodine on a grain and crush
the grain a little, a positive result is obtained. Would one
expect this ? Is our grain not finely enough ground ? would
 one expect ahazy wort if the grains were too finely ground ?

Agreed. The better beers out here appear to be those which have been aged a
little longer. McMenamin's, the local chain of pubs, tend to underage their
beers, which taste young.

"Real Ale" is just plain old beer, made the same way our local brewpubs make
it. CAMRA, the Campaign For Real Ale, has made a thing of insisting that
pubs serve (and brewers brew) cask-conditioned ales, non-pasteurized and
non-filtered. While some American micro-brew-pubs do not cask-condition,
choosing instead to serve direct from aging tanks, there is basically no
difference between garden-variety (isn't it nice to be able to talk about Real
Beer that way?) American microbrew and garden-variety English Real Ale.


One could argue, even, that much bottle-conditioned homebrew meets most of
CAMRA's requirements for Real Ale, which makes us all Real Ale Brewers, as long
as we aren't using lager yeasts...

Subject: keg pressure, carbonation


I recently filled two kegs with brew and decided to artificially carbonate
instead of dealing with more yeast sediment.  I tried bubbling the CO2 from
the bottom at 15-50 psi, and it still didn't carbonate after a three days.
(My pressure guage may be off)  Two weeks later the brew is only slightly
carbonated, yet I get a monstrous head in the glass.  My beer fridge isn't
working right now, so everything is room temperature.
Questions:
1.Does the beer have to be refridgerated to hold the carbonation.
2.Is there something about the C-kegs that gives a giant head upon dispensing
        robbing the beer of carbonation.
3.Has anyone had this problem before, and how did you fix it.




Aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggghh!!

Does anybody out there, brewing in Los Angeles know the H2O analysis for
the area ?  Has anyone had their water tested before and after filtering
to see the effects of the filter on mineral content ?

Some of the brewpubs in Seattle try to condition (age) their ales before
kegging (or in come cases before serving).  The Big Time Brewery, winner of
3 gold medals at the GABF (and no fluke to be sure), has them in a sub 40f
conditioning room in serving tanks.  Brewer Ed Tringali makes the batches
early enough so that they can be aged somewhat before serving.  Sometimes
demand pushes the timetable up a bit.


Funny story:  a friend of mine supplied A-B with some new brewing kettles
some years back; enough kettles to double the output of beer.  It was later
that he noticed that A-B had not added one lagering tank to their plant.
A-B had apparently found ways to speed up the aging to push the beer to the
market faster.  True story.


Some homebrewers have started to cold condition the secondary fermenations
(fermenTations) of ales.  In a fridge at 40f the wort clears off quickly and
the flavors mellow a little bit.  For some types of ales this is not
recommended because of the flavor profiles necessary.  Personally I have
enjoyed the ales better this way.  Back at 60f the bottles carbonate
just fine.
