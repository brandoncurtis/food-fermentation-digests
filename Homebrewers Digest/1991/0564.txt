All right people, lets get serious.  I have just about had it
with the way some of you are putting down the situation in 
Saudi Arabia.  Do any of you have any idea what is really going
on over there?  


First of all, Military regulations forbid the brewing of alcoholic
beverages on any installation.  Especially one in a host country 
that prohibits alcohol consumption.  The military briefs all its
personnel about the host country before they are shipped over seas.
If these soldiers are brewing their own stuff, they are going 
against military regulations as well as the laws of the host country.


Unless you have a military background or are now in the military,
I suggest that you get your facts straight before you bring them to 
the attention of others.  


Yes, we are in America, and Elvis is really dead.  So just talk to 
someone who knows the facts and get your stuff straight before you
open your mouth.

 In the US, you can go to a gun store, buy a high powered rifle with a scope
 & ammunition.  And you can buy it with little waiting period or background
 checking.  But you can't use it to kill someone. Figure that out.
 
 Just because you can do something, doesn't make it right.  Our soldiers are
 guests over there & they should abide by the Saudi laws.  I wouldn't allow
 a smoker to smoke in my house.  I think the Saudis are showing great
 tolerance for our soldiers in thier country...

There seems to be an increasing trend for brewpubs to offer their beers in
the "Real Ale" cask-conditioned/hand-pumped/cellar-temp style.  They can
be found (e.g. Portland's Bridgeport beers, Denver's Wynkoop) and are
remarkably like their British cousin's in mouth feel and quaffability but
probably have a more "US" flavor profile due to the predominant use of 
ingredients from this country (Cascade hops, for example.)  When frequenting
these brewpubs - and frequent them we do - I'll order a cask-conditioned
brew more often than not.

Any yard glass gurus out there? I got one for Christmas and was wondering
if there's any etiquette that goes along with it. That is, do you just fill
it, tip it, and take a beer bath :-) Or is there some set of rules that apply
to yard glass drinking (a friend mentioned turning the glass as you're
drinking)?

   The tip of the electrode is a semipermeable material; letting it get
completely dry can ruin it permanently, or at least mean you have to soak it
for some time before you can get reliable results.

   In the lab, we usually stretched a material like very heavy, soft plastic
wrap over a small container of water and poked the electrode through a small
slit in this covering. This is easier when the electrode is clamped to a
stand. I'd say sacrifice an old mug---evaporation through tiny slits in
multiple layers of wrap should be minimal.

  I wouldn't assume that distilled water is reliably as close to neutral as
.1; the problem is that if \anything/ gets in, the pH will change radically.
The pH of 7 at room temperature means that one H2O in every 1.8e9 is split into
H+ and OH-.  It doesn't take much to shift that balance---are you sure that
sulfur oxides in your air are low enough that the distilled water wouldn't
pick up a couple of parts per billion?
   A buffer is a mixture (usually a weak acid and one of its soluble salts
that will absorb significant amounts of acid or base with little net change
in pH; a standard buffer is much more likely to be at the specified pH than
distilled water is. Not sure why they recommend a buffer at 5.0; possibly
something about the electrode, possibly because most buffers are somewhere
acid. If you were being picky (and covering a wider range than is necessary
for beer, which I think runs mostly pH 5-6) you'd get an alkaline buffer and
check somewhere around pH 9-10 as well.

  Your chemistry is correct as far as it goes. However, the story didn't say
what they'd been "brewing" from. I've heard of desperate people trying to
make drinkable alcohol from things as strange as Sterno(TM) and its relatives
(cf your comment about sources of methanol during Prohibition). I also
wouldn't be surprised if the story said "methanol" because somebody thought
that would be simpler than trying to explain fusels, which I think are toxic
in larger quantities. (Sure they taste dreadful. If you're seriously bored when
you're not thinking about how your leaders are busily trying to get you killed,
are you going to care what it tastes like if it means you might not have to be
sober?)

I live in Montgomery County, MD, just north of Washington, D.C. and have just
joined that new (to me at least) homebrew supply membership wharehouse out
of Florida.  The prices are incredible, but minimum orders are $100.  If you
live in the area and are interested in taking advantage of my membership, drop
me a message (s94taylo`at`usuhsb.bitnet).  I am most interested in splitting
barrels (55 lb.) of dry malt.  All prices are great, but in bulk.
Let me know soon, as I am getting that brewing bug again (after all, it HAS
been 3 whole days since I bottled my last batch)

Subject: Re: It;s too cold!


Many thanks to all those who had suggestions on handling my "frozen" ale. I
did an informal survey of room temps with a thermometer, and managed to find
a spot where temps were stable and warm enough for good fermentation. Spec.
grav. readings were around what I usually get for this recipie, so things
seem OK. I guess I was worring....


The variety of temps around various parts of my apartment have made me wonder
about long term temp stability of my usual brewspace. Anybody know a *cheap*
source of a temperature strip-chart recorder? It'd be nice to know what's
going on when I'm not around!
Thnks-n-Rgds,
mrmike

This was my understanding.  I was told that the poisining might have
resulted from not letting the first third of the distilation blow off.
You are only to collect the middle third from a "run".


There is some methanol and other higher acholes produced from standered
fermentation.  Perhaps the way they distilled there beer consentrated
these.

Good point.   However, I can tell you this is *exactly* what I did for
the first couple years of my brewing.  When introducing newcomers to 
homebrew, I always make the analogy of fresh vs. store bought bread.
They almost always understand this, and enjoy the beer even more.  Only
after going back and tasting budmilob did I notice that a certain type 
of flavor was missing.  I now equate this flavor with "freshness".  
This enables me to relax even more than I used to (-:
