Subject: frozen homebrew- What to Do?




        Several weeks ago we had several days of below freezing
        temperatures and some of my  homebrew, bottled only a week,
        froze in my refridgerator which was in my garage. Several
        bottles broke, but the rest froze up. I've since gradually
        thawed out and is sitting in my basement waiting for a 
        solution as to what to do from the net.


        I've tasted the beer and it tastes okay but is poorly
        carbonated, I mean POORLY. The beer is now aged 4 weeks in the
        bottle and little to no carbonation.


        Did the yeast get killed? Is there any way to recarbonate the
        beer ? Anything else I can Do? 


        If it matters, the beer was a lager type malt extract and I
        was using red star dry lager yeast.


        Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Having used a yard many a time both in pubs and at home the homebrew motto
holds true.  Sit back, Relax, and have a Homebrew. (or 2).

Subject: Some Thoughts on Extract Efficiency




     Since this seems to be a popular topic these
days, I thought I'd throw my 2 cents into the fire,
and make a few conjectures as to what may be going
on with poor extraction efficency.


     First, my normal extraction rate is pretty
close to 30 SG points/gal/lb with a low of 29.3 and
a high of 31.4 over the last 10 batches.  I use the
'classic' 2 bucket lauter tun (inner bucket has 1/8
inch holes on 1/4 inch centers, as per TCHoHB), with
sparge times running 90 to 110 minutes, depending 
on grain bed depth (i.e. amount of grain/batch).


     I crush my malt rather on the fine side, with
the largest bits of endosperm (the starchy white part)
being on the order of coarse corn meal, sizewise.
No whole or half grains, but lots of large husk
pieces.


     Now, why can't some people get better extraction
rates than the 10-20 points/lb they get now?  The
lautering equipment is usually very much the same,
so where is the loss comming from?


     1.  Mash too cold.  You have to get the mash
         temp. above 149F to gelatinize the starches
         so they might be converted.  If you are
         mashing at 150F, you'll want to be sure 
         your thermometer is well calibrated.  A
         few degrees of overshoot on the initial 
         boost to starch conversion may be a good
         thing.


     2.  Malt ground too coarsly.  This hurts on
         two fronts.  Larger bits of endosperm
         longer to gelatinize, locking starch 
         away from the enzymes, and not holding
         the sparge water in contact with the 
         mash long enough to wash out the sugars
         efficiently.  We do have to comprimise,
         since grinding *too* fine introduces
         problems with set mashes, husk tannins,
         etc.  The ideal malt mill would powder
         the endosperm, leaving the husk in 2 or
         3 large pieces.  Idealy, sparging should
         take *at least* 90 mins with a 2 bucket
         lauter tun.


     3.  Not sparging enough water.  For a five
         gallon batch and a relatively thick mash
         (1.3 - 1.5 qt/lb), You should have to sparge
         around 5-5.5 gal.  If you are sparging so
         as to collect total runnoff of 5 gal.,
         you're probably throwing extract away.


     This is all for what it's worth, and I'm sure
some of you will take me to task on as few points,
but hey, it works for me! :-)

You might conisder a min/max thermometer.  They show the current temp
and the highest and lowest, since the last reset.  The hardware store
near me has several models, in the range of $12 to $20.  Jensen Tools
(602) 968-6231 used to have one in their catalog.

Subject: extract recipies please


Hi,
I have brewed 3 batches of beer and am interested in obtaining any recipies
for extract-based beers which also use specialty grains.  Please e-mail me
any recipies which you particularly enjoy bearing in mind that I 1) am a novice
brewer 2) am not interested in getting into all-grain mashing (yet)
3)am interested in brewing "unusual" beers 4)already own TCJOHB and thus
already have C.P.'s recipies at my disposal and 5)am not a real hop fiend
and tend to enjoy less-hopped varieties of beer.
Thanks,
Mike Browne

Subject: pH meters




My understanding of the matter is, the bottom of the electrode is a very
thin glass layer, permeable to hydrogen and very few other cations
(positive particles, for those who don't know).  Inside is a little pool
of an acid (hydrochloric?) and reference wires.  The pool of acid's
concentration of hydrogen ions changes by concentration gradients when
placed in substances of varying ph's, and the reference wires pick this
concentration change up and register it as a potential difference on the
meter, which is interpreted as pH by us who don't know better :-).
The tip of the electrode, if not kept wet, will allow the little H+ ions
in the electrode pass out through the electrode, and the acid will dry up,
meaning there is no reference point for the wires.
 
This, of course, is a simple explanation - I learned it just today in
analytical chemistry, and I could be misinterpreting a couple of facts,
but it does sound right...
 
Disclaimer:  Do not try this at home.  We are trained idiots.

Subject: Rinsing Bottles


Not yet owning a dishwasher, my method for cleaning bottles has stabalized
into the following steps:


(1) Rinse real good after using, drain upside-down.
(2) Since our present sink (until the wife puts in the smaller one to
    make room for the dishwasher) is large enough for 52 bottles (12 oz)
    or 40 bottles (17 oz), I soak the bottles in a bleach bath (2% or so)
    for a couple of hours.  This removes the layers of film that accumulate.
(3) Upon rinsing with the bottle jet sprayer and hanging on a bottle tree,
    I usually go the extra mile and bake the bottles at 300f for 60 minutes.
    Cool down takes awhile so I usually do the baking late at night or
    early in the day.  Very few broken bottles, by the way.


Oh, I remove all labels and foil before any of this.  A large 10 gallon
plastic bucket outside does the job holding the liquid and bottles.

Subject: New reader..and weird problem...


Hi,


I'm a new reader of the mailing list and thought I'd introduce myself.
(I've finally figured out VI!!)
My name's Chuck Morford, I live in Miami (Somebody has to...) and I've been
brewing for 2 years...Mostly sweet stouts since those are my favorites, but
I've brewed an occasional lager for my friends...


Someone earlier mentioned a homebrew warehouse in Florida, could you please
post an address?


Also, I have a strange problem with the last batch I brewed. It was an
American lager, and it had a haze when at room temp, but, when chilled it
was crystal clear. Now, I've had the opposite problem before and I know how to
cure that. But what can I do about it? The beer tastes fine at room temp and
at 50 degrees, so I'm pretty sure it's not yeast...Maybe I should just "Relax".

Subject: Sam Adams the Maltster?


I checked out a book from the library called "Brewed in America" by Stanley
Baron, copyright 1962 by Little, Brown, and Company.  It is a VERY detailed
study of USA brewing from the earliest settlers on. 


On page 75 I came across the following that might interest you:  "In spite
of what most historians have said, however, it appears that [Samuel Adams]
was exclusively a maltster and not a brewer.  It was a traditional trade in
the family."


He was born in 1722, graduated from Harvard in 1740 and made efforts to enter
the practice of law.  But he tried instead to start his own business with a
1000 pound loan from his father, who owned a malting establishment.  Sam
loaned half of it to a friend who never repaid.  Soon after the "default",
Sam joined his father's business.


Sam Adams, Sr. died in 1748, leaving Sam, Jr in charge.  The malthouse was
gone in 1763 as Sam Adams had by then become an active and dynamic politician.


What is so interesting about all this is the hype that Jim Koch continually
throws out in his marketing of the Sam Adams beers.  The beers are fine,
very good actually; so why the hype?  Anyway, inquiring minds want to know.

Subject: Low OG question


I'm a beginning homebrewer, and have been reading the digest for a few
months now.  I just started my first batch, a porter recipe from a mail
order supplier.  I'm using a blow-off system.  The ingredients were 4
lbs of (liquid) hopped malt extract and 3 lbs of dried malt extract,
plus some black patent malt and flaked barley which I put in grain bags
and removed from the wort when boiling began.  


Anyway, the recipe says that OG should be 1.054 to 1.067.  I only
measured 1.033 at 84F, which corrects to around 1.040.  Any ideas what
went wrong?  It seems like there should be little variance from the
normal numbers - that is, X lbs of malt extract and Y gallons of water
should produce an OG of Z - case closed, right?  Is it possible that
I didn't "stir" the carboy enough after putting the wort in and 
filling with water, i.e. could the liquid have been dense at the bottom
and less so at the top where I sampled?   I also checked the hydrometer
in 60F water and it reads very close to 1.000.  I'm trying not to worry
about this....
