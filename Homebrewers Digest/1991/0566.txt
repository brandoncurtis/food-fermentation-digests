Boy, did I mess up that last attempted posting!


The beginning (which disappeared somewhere) was that the 'homebrew'
related poisonings in the mid-east were from an attempt at a
holiday punch containing windshield wiper fluid.


The staff from the hospital ship is from the DC area, so we get
coverage of their events on the local news.

In HBD #565, Todd Enders shares some thoughts about sources of low extract:

I disagree. Perhaps it's my lauternig system, but I don't use nearly this much
water, and my extract rate is very good: 5.5 gal at 1050 from 8 lb. of UK 2-row
in my latest batch.  Other recent batches have had similar rates of extraction.
This works out to be about 34 points/lb., but then UK malt has a higher pro-
portion of starch than US.  


(Btw, the pros don't necessarily use this pts./lb. system.  It involves the
erroneous assumption that the proportion of solids in the wort is a linear
function of SG.  Not true, but an acceptable assumption within, say, the 
range of 1030-1060 into which almost all of our brews, other than barley wines,
fall.  English and Canadian brewermasters, at any rate, seem to use percent 
wt./wt. of extract - see my posting of last September.)


I use a Bruheat bucket for my mash, and sparge in the same container.  The
grain (ground fairly fine) lives in a bag with a mesh bottom and impermeable 
sides.  During the sparge I hoist it up so that the bottom of the bag is 4
inches above the bottom of the bucket.  There's a spigot about an inch above 
the bottom of the bucket.  Because gunk collects at the bottom of the bucket
during the mash, I drain _all_ of the first runnings out and pass them back 
through.  There's about 2 gallons of them.  Then I run 2.5 gallons of water
at 77C through.  Total collected: 4.5 gallons.  No doubt I'm leaving a little 
behind, but at 34 pts./lb., how much can be left?


PS: despite my mania for the metric system, all of theses figures are US gals.


Hoppy sparging,

Subject: Primary fermenter options




Okay, I finally got out, bought a beermaking kit, and my brewpartner
and I started our first batch (a bitter ale, using two cans of Cooper's
hopped bitter extract).  We had a few problems, the most notable of
which is that his new stove, which has the new-fangled embedded burners
(i.e., you don't see a metal coil, you see a solid cast-iron plate)
wouldn't get hot enough to boil 3 gallons of wort; but we got around that
eventually, and boiled our wort.  If you're considering a new cooktop,
watch out for this!


Things seem to be going fine, so I've a few questions I'd like to ask.


First, on primaries.  Our kit came with a plastic bucket primary, but
Papazian suggests using a glass carboy.  His logic (allowing the tannins
and other vernicious nasties to blow out the top) makes good sense,
and it strikes me as odd that this wouldn't be universally suggested.
The obvious question is "is there a good reason to use a plastic bucket
for the primary ?"  


Second, on small batches.  It seems to me that brewing small batches
could be a handy way to check out wierd brews or minor variations
of a single recipe.  Does anyone out there do this ?


Third, on the law.  Papazian, I think, says that homebrew cannot
be legally removed from the premises except for a beer-tasting
event.  Can anyone comment on federal and/or Ohio laws regulating
homebrewing of beer ?

Subject: Chilled Yeast


In HOMEBREW Digest #565, Duane Smith discussed his frozen brew:


        Several weeks ago we had several days of below freezing
        temperatures and some of my  homebrew, bottled only a week,
        froze in my refridgerator which was in my garage ...


        I've tasted the beer and it tastes okay but is poorly
        carbonated, I mean POORLY. The beer is now aged 4 weeks in the
        bottle and little to no carbonation.


        Did the yeast get killed? Is there any way to recarbonate the
        beer ? Anything else I can Do? 


Wow.  It caught you at the worst possible time.  I had something
similar happen last year, where a blizzard left my beer & I stranded
without heat for several sub-freezing days, but as it was still in
the fermentor, I just dosed it with fresh yeast & bottled, after it
thawed.


The fact that you're not getting any carbonation suggests that the
yeast has gone dormant, and probably flocculated out.  It may or may
not return from the dormancy.  If I were in your position, what I'd
probably do is:


1)  Slowly bring the beer up to room temperature.  After a couple of
days of that, invert each bottle several times to rouse the yeast. 
Leave it for another week, then open a bottle to see if anything's
happening.  If not, ...


2)  Open 'em all, and gently decant to a sanitized vessel.  Pitch 
new yeast, and rebottle.


Needless to say, the second course is a last resort.  Unless it were
pretty damn good beer, I'd probably save it for the slugs before I'd
go to that much trouble.


That must have been the same freeze that destroyed my water system
and wort chiller.  No fun at all.

Subject: Re: Low OG question


In HBD #565, Randy Pals asks about a batch of porter he is fermenting with
a blow-off on the primary.  He is getting lower-than-expected OG, and 
wants to know:


>Is it possible that
>I didn't "stir" the carboy enough after putting the wort in and 
>filling with water, i.e. could the liquid have been dense at the bottom
>and less so at the top where I sampled?


I've had this same problem with measuring OG when using a closed primary.
There seems to be a lot of stratification between the cold water you put
in the primary to prevent thermal shock, and the hot or warm wort, and
it is very difficult to mix the layers once you are in the carboy, as
you can't fit a spoon in to stir, and there isn't enough headroom to effectively
shake.  For this reason, I've stopped using the blow-off altogether, mainly
because I have yet to discern even the slightest difference in final beer
quality anyway.  


One note:  I haven't tried this since my brewing partner bought a wort chiller,
which I suspect would solve the problem handily.  Curiously, I have had no 
oxidation problems in the beers I did with a closed fermentation, and I didn't
siphon the hot wort into the carboy.


My suggestions to you, Randy are to 
1) Don't worry.  Your suspicion is correct about the densities not being
mixed properly.
2) Try cooling your wort more before adding to the carboy.
3) It looks like you added the wort first, and topped off with water.  Try
putting in water first, adding some wort, mixing thoroughly, adding more
water and wort, mixing again, etc.  Better yet, mix some of the wort and
water before adding to the carboy.
4) Have a vigorous yeast starter ready (at least 2 packets of dry yeast
pre-started for at least a few hours in some wort).  You will be exposing
your wort to a lot of air by doing all of this mixing and shaking, so you
want a quick start on fermentation.


Hope this helps,

Hi.  My name is James Dryfoos and I live in Durham North Carolina.
I joined to list recently and up to now have just observerd.  From the
content of the digest I feel like a beginner -- although I have made
simple homebrew for several years.


I am curious about feedback on the above topic of rinsing bottles.
I find this the worst part of the whole process.
I normally clean gunk out of bottles right away so later all I need is really
to sterilize.  I use the above method of soaking in a bleach solution.
This and the process of then rinsing is a drag (I also use a bottle washer).
Are there better ways?  Is baking the bottles necessary?  I have not
heard this before.  I feel like since I use bleach I need to painstakingly
rinse the bottles.  Is something like bbrite a better alternative?
Any advice would help.  What about this bottle tree thing?  I usually
just shake out the bottle.  It is usually still wet when I fill it with
my primo brew.  Oh yea, is using a dishwasher sufficient?  What should
be used as detergent if so?


Thanks.  Jim Dryfoos :-)

Subject: Specific Gravity Measurement Errors




A comment to those people concerned about low extraction efficiencies:
As an extract-adjunct brewer, I don't usually have to concern myself with good
sparging technique and the like.  Recently I brewed my first attempt at a
barleywine and learned a lesson about the measurement of specific gravity.


I formulated a recipe that should have given an initial gravity of about 1.080.
Just before pitching the yeast I siphoned a sample and measure a gravity of 
only 1.060!  I took some more samples with the same result, and double-checked
my calculations.  I pitched the yeast and puzzled about it for a few days.


I spoke with Jeff Casey about my experience and he suggested that there might 
be a density gradient in the wort, with heavier readings at the bottom. 
I went home and took samples from the top and bottom of the fermentation
vessel.  The readings differed by more than 20 points.  The average was less
than 1.040, so there is indeed a significant gradient.  (My initial samples
were taken from near the center of the primary, after a settling and cooling 
period of 2 hours.)  The gradient effect is almost certainly more pronounced
in a high-gravity wort like barleywine, but it is clearly a factor even in
dilute liquor if one wants to make measurements with an accuracy of 2 or 3 
points. A good stirring prior to sampling will reduce the gradient error.
I will now take my initial samples immediate after aerating the wort.  


Between temperature corrections, density gradients, errors in the calibration
of the instrument, and errors in reading the instrument, I suspect that it is
difficult to measure specific gravity with an absolute accuracy of better than
plus or minus 2 or 3 points. Relative measurements (such as the difference
between starting and finishing gravities) will be more accurate, but I wouldn't
be concerned about differences of 5 points when comparing with someone else's
results.

Subject: Mead + bees




Just brewed my first batch of mead (Barkshack gingermead) yesterday (Sun.), 
and racked and pitched this morning.  Beautifully clear and sparkling.  
Something happened, however that struck me as rather odd.  While I was boiling
the honey, my house was attacked by bees!  Found several in my garage, got them
out, closed it up, went inside, and found several more there!  Had to do 'em in.
They were coming in the vent for the fan above the stove.  Turned on the fan 
and had no more problems.  This really struck me as odd that the bees would be
so attracted to the smell of boiling honey.  Used six pounds of Cucamonga and
about four pounds of homemade.  Oh well, learn something every batch, I guess.

Subject: Any Grain Growers out there?


So with all this talk about growing hops, I was wondering if anyone out
there has tried to grow and use there own grain?  I started the hop thing
last year and I was highly pleased with the results.  This spring I hope
to extend my scratch brewing urges by growing enough grain for a single
batch.


I have somewhat successfully malted barley but I believe that I started
with a bad choice of barley for beer.  Everything generally worked but
the taste was a lot stronger then I had hoped.  Unfortunately I will be
using barley seed from the same source and I fear that I might get similar
results should I actually succeed in having it grow.


So.... Has anybody tried this successfully?  Does anybody have any ideas
on what I might do to reduce errors?  Finally, does anybody know of a better
source for barley then my source (local feed store supplys me now - the
barley is actually meant for birds and livestock to eat).


Thanks for any help.

Subject: yeast vs. yeast


I cultured some yeast (Wyeast German Ale) from an early batch.  The
culturing seemed to go well, nice krausen, etc. (LOTS of yeast
nutrient seemed to be the trick).  Anyway, I pitched this into 
a fresh batch and waited. Nothing.  After 24 hours I pitched in some
dry yeast, which caught within 6 hours and is doing just fine.


So, what happened to the first batch of yeast?  The only thing I
can think of is that I shocked it (I spaced out and tossed it in
when the wort was about 60 degF. The yeast was sitting at closer
to 70 degF).  If there's still some of the original yeast alive, what 
happens to those creatures when another strain starts up?  Does the 
first strain get killed off, or can they both keep going?


The reason I'm wondering is that the ferment is taking longer than
what usually happens with this (more or less) standard batch.

The yard-long glasses that I have used had a long tapered part and a
round reservoir at the bottom.  While drinking you must rotate the glass
around its major axis when you get to the fluid in the bulbous
reservoir or the beer in the bulb will come rushing into your face.  You
essentially use centrifugal force to overcome gravity.  This prevents
the contents of the reservoir emptying at once after air starts entering
the bulb.
Be aware that these glasses hold about three beers!

Subject: Recipe: Scotch Ale




     This is the first try at formulating my own recipe.  It turned out
quite nice, malty with just a touch of hops.  If you want a change from highly
hopped brews, but still want something substantial, you might want to try
this.  But be forewarned, you may not be able to drink just one! :-)


     My Own Scotch Ale (5 US gal.)


6# Klages 2-row Malt
1# Munich Malt     (10L)
1# Dextrine (Cara-pils) malt
8oz. Crystal Malt   (80L)
4oz. Black Patent Malt
1C Dark Molasses
.75oz. 6.2% alpha East Kent Goldings
Wyeast #1028 London Ale yeast
2/3C Corn sugar (priming)


Mash in: 2 gal. water `at` 138F
Mash pH: 5.2 (adjust with Calcium Carbonate)
Protein rest: 30 mins `at` 131F
Conversion rest: 30 mins `at` 158F
Mash out: 5 mins `at` 168F


Sparge: 5 gal. water `at` 165F


Boil: 90 mins
Hops: 1 addition, 30 mins from end of boil


OG: 1.055
FG: 1.015


     Pitched 12/24/90.  Racked to secondary: 12/26/90.  Bottled 12/31/90.


     This has to be one of the smoothest batches I ever brewed.  It is really 
smooth even after only 2 weeks in the bottle.  The rather intense malt flavor 
and low hopping rate make this a refreshing change of pace from my steady
production of IPA's.

        I heard a call for extract-based barleywine.  I made a
batch of this about a year ago.  It was so good that I've got
two batches of it running in tandem.  I'm really pleased with
it, it's got a nice balanced flavor.


Boil for 1 hour:


        12 lb Fermentatin Settlement bulk light malt extract
        .5 lb honey 
        1 lb British Dry light malt extract
        1.5 lb corn sugar
        2 oz Chinook hops (13.2% alpha)
        2 oz Cascade hops (5.5% alpha)


In last 30 minutes add 2 t Irish moss


Boil for another 30 minutes:


        2 oz fuggles
        2 t sparkeloid
        
Pitch *Champagne* yeast when cool.


        I bottled after 7 months and it was *wonderful.*

My parents have about 40 acres of walnuts, and this year 
they planted barley between the trees as somekind of soil 
improvement/fertilizing thing.  At some point in time they 
will plow it under. 


My thought was, if the barley plants were to produce, 
and I were to harvest it ... is there anything
I could use it for in my homebrewing?


I figure malting it might be to difficult, 
but maybe I could roast it.  Any other ideas?

Hi -


Here is another initiative to start a Homebrew Club in NH.  Anyone within
striking distance is welcome to apply.  Please send the attached form to John
at the enclosed address.  John started with the Zymurgy distribution list for
NH.  He doesn't have net access, so I am posting this for him.  


Thanks, and sorry for the bandwidth if you are too far away to care.


Cheers...Gary

                        ATTENTION HOMEBREWERS!


The winter issue of Zymurgy magazine features a brief article concerning the
1991 A.H.A. Convention to be held in Manchester, N.H.  Shouldn't our state be
represented by at least one homebrew club?  If you are willing to spare just a
few hours each month, we can make this happen.  I know that this can be a
sacrifice, after all in a few hours you could make or bottle a batch of your
finest homebrew!


Anyone that is interested is invited to an open "Brew" house.  It will be held
on Saturday, February 16, 1991.  It will be held from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. (In
case of a snowstorm, it will be held on Sunday, February 17, 1991.  Call if
there is any doubt.)  Please bring along a few of your favorite beers, and
start thinking about an appropriate club name.


Please find enclosed an information/response sheet for you to fill out and
return A.S.A.P.  If you need extra copies to hand out to homebrewers that you
know that do not subscribe to Zymurgy, feel free to photocopy what you need!


I know that some of you may have to come from far away, but please make every
effort to come --- or at least respond.  Let's try to make this a terrific
homebrew club --- something that we can all share and enjoy as well as be proud
of.


Thank you for your time.
