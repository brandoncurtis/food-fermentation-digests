I used to occasionally have this happen to me, though thankfully
I never ended up with any bottle-bombs.  Also had another
problem, namely that my airlock only had tiny bubbles in it, no
big ones going glub, glub.


So I mentioned that here and got lots of responses, mostly
suggesting that the top to my airlock must be on too tight.
Voila!  Now I make sure that the top is on very loosely.  I get
great glubs in the airlock and no more carbonation of any kind in
the secondary (I think, have been lazy the last few batches about
taking out samples to measure S.G.).

I have a friend who is a great fan of Samual Smith's Oatmeal Stout.  I
owe him a favor and I promised to make him a batch of homebrew oatmeal
stout.  Does anyone out there have a recipe that they would like to
share?  I'm still on the lower half of the homebrew learning curve so
either an extract or mixed mash recipe would be best.  Thanks in
advance.

Subject: lagering


There have been a couple of comments lately on just what "lagering" really
means.  I don't know the origin of the term but I do have an observation to
share.


Until recently, I have not had the facilities to do cold fermentations; I have
made several steam beers, however.  These beers were fermented and then aged at
60-70F.  Usually, I take beer out of the aging/storage area and refridgerate
a day or less before planning to serve.  On those occasions when get-togethers
are cancelled at the last minute, the beer can sit in the fridge for a week or
more.  I've noticed that this storing of the beer at lower temperatures for
even as short a week makes a marked improvement in the taste.  I've not yet
had the opportunity to make comparisons of this technique with beers that were
fermented cold.

Assuming you don't have an infection, the key word is "secondary." If you
rack a beer that has fermented completely out, the brief exposure to oxygen
causes the yeast to biochemically change gears. I've been told that it enters
malo-lactic fermentation. Whether that's technically correct or not, the
upshot is that the yeast is triggered into fermenting the higher-order
oligosaccharides, namely, what brewers usually call dextrins, which
contribute to mouth-feel/body.


From a practical standpoint, you can't stop this without pasteurizing the
beer or otherwise killing the yeast. From a commercial standpoint, you're
brewing "dry" beer.

DO NOT BOTTLE. It can take well over a month for the yeast to do all your
dextrins. Wait until the pinpoint carbonation stops, then prime and bottle
normally.


There are two ways to avoid this kind of secondary fermentation: 1) (the hard
way) rack to secondary while primary fermentation is not complete; 2) (the
easy way) when racking to secondary, add the same amount of sugar/malt that
you would when priming. The latter way adds enough sugar to allow the yeast
to consume the oxygen without digesting dextrins, and will totally prevent
this phenomenon. There's actually a third way, which is what I use: since I
brew only ales and use fast-acting yeast, I do away with racking to secondary
altogether.

Geeze!  I have a beer glass collection I brought back from Europe.
Routinely, I stick all the glasses in the dishwasher, dump in a 
bunch of Cascade Detergent, and run it.  The glasses come out
sparkling clean.  The beer poured into these glasses will form an
adequate head.  I just can't see any problem with treating bottles
the same way.


The alternative for bottles, if you are really a fanatic, is to
wash them with a solution of 1 tbsp TSP in a gallon of warm water,
rinse thoroughly until the glass is squeaky clean.  Then cover the
top with aluminum foil and bake the bottles at 350 F for one hour.
If there exist any microorganisms in the bottles after that
treatment which could spoil your beer, well, you've got the makings
for a real exciting SF film (beg your pardon for the pun).

Don't forget to change the gaskets.  You can buy them in large
quantities from many supply stores or mailorder.  I have heard
that you should change it once before your first reuse and then
"occasionally."  Some digesters have said they change gaskets
every two times, others don't change them even at the beginning.
If I didn't keg, I would probably change them every three or
four reuses.  Your milage may vary.

Hey ffolkes,
     I have been using a picnic cooler as a mash tun for a few batches now, and
can't ssem to get the OGs and FGs I would like.  I generally mash fer about 45
min to an hour at about 152-157 degrees, and use about 8 lbs of grain, with
about 1-2 lbs of that specialties.  My extract is *really* low, and I tend to
finish high....Hints?

Subject: A call to New England home brew clubs


The following letter was FAXed to me by Karen Barela, AHA Conference Director.
She is very interested and excited about getting New England area clubs
directly involved with the upcoming AHA Conference in Manchester, NH.
She gave me permission to post her letter here, and for it to be distributed
freely.  If your club hasn't seen it, please show it to your fellow members.
If you've been thinking about joining a NE-area club, there's never been
a better time!


I know that there are a handfull of active clubs scattered around New England
now.  Though there are not yet any well-established clubs in New Hampshire,
there are currently two starting up in the New Hampshire/NE Mass. area.  
Gary Mason posted information about both in HOMEBREW DIGEST.  John Welch is
actively working to start a club, and the kickoff meeting will be February 16
at his home in Pembroke, NH.  See HB Digest #331 for info, or call or write
John at 418 Nadine Rd, Pembroke, NH 03275, (603) 485-8381, or reply to me
for information.


Additionally, the Wort Hoggs Home Brewers Club is gaining perceptible momentum
and will be meeting again January 25 in Tyngsboro, MA.  See HB Digest #498
for general info, or reply to me if you want to try and make the 1/25/91
meeting or any future meetings.


This early activity is getting me psyched about the Conference, and I'm
confident that New England's home brew clubs, both new and mature, will
be ready to welcome the AHA and the world's home brewers to Manchester
in June!

Dear New England Club:
        We're thrilled to be holding our Homebrew Conference in Manchester,
N.H., close to many of you.  In case you haven't heard, the dates are June 19
to 22, 1991, and the festivities will be at the Center of New Hampshire
Holiday Inn.  Registration information for both the Conference and the
Competition will be available in the spring issue of ZYMURGY.


        As a New England club, several events concern you.  Thursday night,
June 20, will be club night, where any club that wants one gets an exhibit
space for their T-shirts, mugs, pins, and especially beer!  To reserve a
space, call Dan Fink at the AHA.  Remember to start brewing your club beers
soon, so they'll be crystal clear and delicious to impress other beer lovers
at club night.  The Homebrew Expo will have its first of two nights running
alongside club night, so there will be plenty of interesting equipment and
supplies in addition to fine club beers.  After club activities wind down
the hospitality suites will run well into the night.  If you are interested
in renting a hospitality suite, contact Karen Barela at the AHA.


        On Friday, the New England Brewers Tasting will be combined with the
second night of the Homebrew Expo.  Both events will follow the gala awards
banquet, so be prepared to check out the latest supplies and equipment while
tasting some fine commercial beers served by the brewers.  On Saturday, the
plan is to tour breweries throughout New England, so here's your chance to
introduce your club to brewers from all over the U.S. and Canada.  How about
hosting brewery tours of your area for groups of conference goers?  Or maybe
help arrange for some Conference attendees to attend the Red Sox game with
your club?  How about hosting a club party and beer tasting?  The AHA will
help arrange transportation from Manchester and back again, and we'll assist
you in any other way we can.


        These are just some preliminary ideas for you to think about.
Remember, Saturday is *your* day to promote your club, get to know to
others. [sic] have fun *and* get some recognition for your club and its beer!
If you tell us your plans by the end of February, we'll help you however we
can, and we'll be sure to publicize your activities at the Conference and
in the program.  Contact Karen Barela at the AHA for more information or for
help with getting your plans moving.
        We're looking forward to seeing you at the Conference!


                                                Fermently,

Subject: Dishwashers for Bottles


I routinely use a dishwasher for cleaning and sanitizing bottles.  I've
had no problems with bottle clarity, brew infection, or head retention.


Most times I've used ordinary dishwashing detergent.  As added
protection against soap film, I use detergent in the first wash period
but not in the second (i.e., I put detergent in the external cup but
not in the the latched soap compartment).


Just recently I decided to be more ecologically correct :-) and tried
washing soda instead of detergent.  As far as I can tell, there's no
difference in the result.


I always use the ``pot scrubber'' cycle with heated drying.


As Miller suggests, I scrupulously avoid the use of a rinse agent.
However, I've never run an experiment to determine what happens if
rinse agent is present.

You know, I was thinking the same thing. My brew partner and I
have been buying six-packs of domestic long necks to provide 
ourselves with bottles, but it is a painful process (for both my
taste buds and my wallet).  There are a few beers that come in the
right bottles that are actually drinkable (Dominion Lager and Pete's
Wicked Ale, for instance) but we can't afford to drink the stuff
all day long.


So I went to a bar near school and asked the bartender what they
did with their bottles (they served Bud, Bud Light, Bud Dry, Miller
and Lite, among other yucky brews, all in long-neck bottles). She
said they pay a $1.20 deposit on each case of bottles and routinely
send them back to the brewer for re-filling. I asked if I could have
a couple cases of these bottles, and she got the manager, who went
around back himself and brought out the bottles. He didn't even charge
me the $1.20 per case deposit, he just let me have them.


The only thing is that the Lite bottles aren't quite the right shape/
size, but they outta work out if i'm careful when I bottle. The moral
is just go to your favorite local bar and ask them for their bottles.
Depending on what kind of beer they serve it should be really easy to
acquire a few cases real cheap; even if i'd paid it would only have
cost me $2.40.
