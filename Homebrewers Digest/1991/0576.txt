Subject: Bottles


I've seen more discussion about what kind of bottles to use.  I realize this
is a perennial topic and many people are tired of reading about it, but I
just couldn't resist throwing in my $0.02.


I was given a case of Labatt's IPA as a gift.  It was bottled in special 125
year anniversary bottles, very nice brown bottles--no label except around
the neck--instead, the glass is embossed with a picture of the original
brew house.  These bottles are beautiful, and I was dismayed when I saw that
they were screw-top.   


After thinking about it, I decided to try one for homebrew--they are returnable
bottles, the only drawback is the screw top.  I went ahead with a crown cap.
I put it on very carefully.  The seal looked pretty good, and the beer 
carbonated just as well as the beer in "regular" bottles.  This one data point
was rather encouraging, and I plan to use more of these bottles with my next
batch.


I have heard that screw type caps are available in some places.  Has anyone
actually seen these?  Better yet--anyone used them?  Is any special equipment
needed to put them on bottles?

Does anyone have a good recipe for a pale ale similar to Royal Oak?  I would 
prefer an all extract if you have it.

In response to Mark Castleman's query, Denver and Boulder each have one
brewpub.


The Walnut Brewery in Boulder is currently *THE* chic spot in Boulder.
There is always a line outside to get in.  It is where the beautiful
people go to be seen.  Once inside you get to pay a lot for food
and drink beer which is quite chilled and quite carbonated.


While also very popular, you can usually at least get through the
door of the Wynkoop Brewery in downtown Denver.  The food is decent
and reasonably priced.  They have a full range of beers, my favorites
being the Bitter and IPA, both served from hand-pumps.  They usually
carry at least one insipid, chilled, over-carbonated beer, too, for
those who like that sort of thing.


Gosh, I hope my biases didn't come through!

Actually, if all the recipes were compiled, I for one would rather have
the "electronic" version.  On-line text is much easier to handle--I would
know where it was, it wouldn't take up physical space, I could scan for
keywords easily, etc.  I can always laser-print a hardcopy later, if I want.


But don't let me stop you...go for it.  It is a very generous offer.

I have the chance to obtain some 5 gallon kegs, that the restaurant
business uses for Coke syrups in fountain drinks.


Has anybody had experience using these kegs? Are there any particular
advantages/disadvatages in using these types of kegs??

1) Make sure it is a type of plastic that is ok for Alcohol. Food grade
doesn't necessarily mean that carcinogens won't leach out in the prescence of
alcohol (hence the problems with the original type of plastic bottles liquor
is marketed in)


2) Don't soak plastic in CLorox. It is ok to disinfect it with clorox
solution. NEVER, NEVER leave it soaking in this. This will leave these flavors
in the plastic, and thus in your beer (Phenolic aromas & flavors).

Hmmm.  I have done that in the winter, just putting the container
out on the porch for several hours or overnight and thawing a
little indoors.


For those of us with little free space in our freezers, you can
get a bunch of those *huge* plastic cups that come with lids and
solid plastic straws.  I pour boiling hot water in them to
sanitize, cover with plastic wrap, allow to cool to room
temperature, put in fridge to cool further, and put in freezer to
cool even further.


You can pop these huge ice cubes right out of the container into
your wort (a little tricky, they have to partially thaw before
they will come out).  Then you stir them in the wort carefully
until they melt.  You now have a cool wort you can
siphon/strain/pour into your carboy and add yeast to.

P.S. A neighbor who ran a homebrew supply store in Arlington had his water
analyzed and pronounced just fine for brewing ales.

Duane Smith asks:

>dry malt for sugar for priming.


Corn sugar has approx. 20% more fermentable sugar by weight than
dry malt extract.  Therefore, to substitute, weigh your normal
priming corn sugar, add 20% and then weigh out that amount of
dry malt extract.

Hello all.


For the first time last week I used B-Bright to clean
my bottles.  This stuff worked great.  I soaked the bottels
for 30 min in a solution of B-Bright and was able to peel (slide)
the labels right off.  The stuff costs about 50 cents for 2 cases
of bottels and it does not hurt the beer.


Happy Brewing,

Subject: Gusher


After eight batches, I've had my first mis-fortune with a gusher.  What
exactly causes them?  After my "Granny Smith Christmas Cheer" finally 
stops gushing it is quite drinkable with no bad tastes at all.  Furthur,
the longer I chill it, the less it gushes.  Does anyone have the
diagnosis so I can prevent this sort of thing in the future?


I was thinking of renaming it to "Old Faithful Ale".

My parents just offered to buy me a 40 qt. stainless boiler for my
birthday (I guess I won them over with my partial mash beers at
Christmas).  They found a pot at a local store for $95.  That seems
reasonable from what I've seen on the net.  The problem is that this
is a standrd stockpot that will cover only one burner.  I've found
in my 16 qt. partial mashes that it takes an eternity to bring that
volume to a boil.  I can't imagine getting seven gallons to a boil
with only one burner.


Does anyone out there know of a source for a 40 qt. boiler which will
straddle two burners (bottom at least 15" across).  If not, how do you
all-grain brewers do it?  Please e-mail responses to me.  If I receive
any requests, I'll forward whatever I learn.
