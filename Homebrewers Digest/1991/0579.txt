OK, I decided I wanted to make a coffee stout (which turned into
a coffee ale when I was out of certain ingredients).  After
perusal of back issues of this Digest, and finding several people
saying the 1/2 lb. of coffee beans was too much, I decided to add
1/4 lb. of coffee beans.


So, I bought some French Roast at the store, and just dumped 1/4
lb of beans into the primary fermenter after heating them not to
the boiling point in a little water.  No chopping or grinding.


In the future, I will use about a handful (1 or 2 oz.) instead,
as this still has an overpowering coffee flavor (you can't tell
it is beer).

on the Goat Hill (Tavern?) in Newport Beach, Ca.  A friend tells me this
is near San Diego, so I'm sorry if it is not.  Anyway, the place has a total
of 95 beers on tap at any time.  All the big brewers, 25 or 35 micros, plus
imports.  It sounds like a must-see.  Anyone been there ?

I have seen it at local establishments that carry wide varieties
of beers (including a local Safeway) in the Washington DC area,
so it isn't a figment of your imagination.  You might try the
more knowledgeable purveyors of beer in your area, as it isn't
available everywhere.  It is mildly famous to beer drinkers as
being a very high-alcohol beer (I guess more properly a barley
wine).

I generally use 1 cup of dry malt to substitute for 3/4 cup of
corn sugar, and have no complaints.  I believe the general ratio
is that corn sugar is 100% fermentable, while dry malt extract is
80% fermentable.  Your mileage may vary.

My only pointer is to Dave Miller's book

boiler that straddles two burners on the stove.  I have leant my
copy to a friend so cannot tell you exactly what he uses or where
he got it.

A restaurant called EKU-28? Sounds like a great place to me, but don't eat
and drive! :-)

Yeah, the second strongest beer in the world, behind Samiclaus.

Those are two very different (and not necessarily related) questions :-)!
Yeah, I can get it easily enough here in DC; not quite New England. It
ain't cheap, but it's less expensive than Samiclaus. Michaes Jackson waxes
eloquent (for a paragraph or two) in his World Guide to Beer.




Dan>   If so, is it still made, or can it be approximated at home?


I believe EKU stands for Erste Kulmbach <something>, and that it is made in
Kulmback, Germany. EKU is a *big* brewer.


I've never tried to brew a bock, let alone a dopplebock, and certainly not
something as heavy/alcoholic as EKU. But I'd like to. Miller mentions that
there are problems with all-grain versions of dopplebock-class beers, and
employes extract in his recipe.


If anyone out there has got a great spicy dopplebock, I'd love to hear it.
Anyone brewed a super-high-test batch? What problems did you encounter? or
did you just use the first runnings from the mash (then make a full-bodied
beer out of the rest)?

Eku-28 is the barley wine produced by the Eku brewery, the 28 referring
to its proof (being 14% alcohol).  I assume it is still available
although I have not had one in years.  I submit to those in the net more
experienced in making barley wines about how to go about making it.


I first ran across Eku-28 in a bar in Madison, WI several years ago.
The bartender had on a T-shirt emblazoned with the inscrutible phrase
"I survived two Eku-28."  My companion and I asked him what his shirt
meant and he explained that he had gotten it at some special promotion
for Eku-28, where they dared the brave to drink a pair of them in one
evening.  (I hope they had designated drivers. :-)  I have tried the
brew and frankly did not care for it.  Perhaps I got an old bottle but
the memory is still so unpleasant that I am not inclined to try it
again.  (Fortunately, other barley wines I have had have been much
better, particularly Old Knucklehead. Yum.)  I like Eku's other beers,
though.

Subject: Washington Post article
Full-Name: Peter Kester


The front page of Wednesday's (2/6) food section of the Washington
Post had an article on homebrewing featuring two area homebrewers.
The article describes the process these two use & gives the recipe for
making a double batch of a partial mash IPA.  If anyone wants me to
send them the recipe they use, let me know -- if there is an
overwhelming response, I'll post it.


IMHO, the article gave a good introduction to homebrewing.  It went
into some detail but was definitely written for novices.  At the end,
it even gave phone numbers and addresses for AHA, BURP (a local club:
"Brewers United for Real Potables"), and three local homebrew supply
stores (unfortunately none in Northern VA -- does anyone know of any?)


A humorous side note: these two brewers term commercial swill as "lawn
mower beer" since it is "beer like Budweiser that you ride around on
your lawn mower with."


Happy brewing.

First off, thanks very much to those kind souls who responded directly to 
my question about EKU-28.  It seems that it is a doubleback type beer that 
is available, but not common.  I'll have to look further afield than New 
Hampshire state liquor rip-off stores to find it I guess.


Now the question at hand.  I am not only interested in brewing beer at 
home, I want to try winemaking too.  Is there a digest for home winemaking?

Subject: Cheap Chillers


I'd like to add to Martin Lodahl's comments on immersion chillers.


I like to stick mine in the boiler ten minutes before the end of the
boil to take care of anything I may have missed when cleaning.  The
second time I did this, the rolling boil ceased.  It took almost ten
minutes to resume.  The problem was the large thermal mass of the
water left in the tubing from last use.  Now I run hot tap water
through the chiller (160F) to heat the copper, then blow the water
out.  I've had no problem since.


I got my tubing at a hardware store.  50 ft. for $10.  I believe it's 
1/4 inch.  Works great.  I just press the tubing on; no hoseclamp or
anything.  I then nested sucessively larger pieces of hose over the 
other end, building it up to garden hose size, and attached a garden
hose fitting ~$1.95.  A hoseclamp holds that end together.  That screws
onto my bottlewasher adaptor on the kitchen sink.  No leaks, no muss,
no fuss.

James,
        I was in a similar situation a few weeks ago (no fault of my cat :-)).


I was told that taking white granulated sugar, after boiling it with
the juice of a lemon is a fine substitute for corn sugar.  I did it and it 
worked quite well.  The heat and the citric acid do the magic.  I boiled 
less than a cup of water, added 3/4 cup of sugar, squeezed in half a lemon,
and five minutes later, poof! priming material.  Good luck with the Kolasabrau!

I have a batch of pseudo-Imperial Stout ready to bottle and I discovered
last evening that I had no corn sugar (actually I discovered that my cat
had torn open the bag...this also explains the white powder all over her
nose, I had imagined the worst).  My question is, can I prime for bottling
using dry malt?  If so, how much should I use (I usually use 3/4 cup corn
sugar)?  I seem to remember mention of converting between corn sugar and
dry malt, but can't remember the rough amounts.  So, has anyone tried this?
Will it work?  I must know!  The Kolasabrau cannot wait!

Subject: deterioration of kegged beer




I have had a problem with homebrew stored in stainless steel kegs
(the Cornelius/Pepsi variety).  The beer is good for the first 3-6
weeks, but gradually picks up a sour off-flavor.  After 10-14 weeks,
it is virtually undrinkable.  The clarity and head retention remain
as they originally were;  only the flavor is affected.  It happens
to all of my beers that I choose to keg (very few at this point) 
regardless of type of beer, type of process (extract or mash), etc.
The more well-hopped varieties survive a bit longer, perhaps.
I suggest an infection of some kind;  any ideas?  The kegs were kept
refrigerated with CO2 overpressure, the yeast at the bottom was drawn
off until the beer was clear, and the kegs and all known removable
parts were cleaned with a dilute bleach solution and thoroughly rinsed
before using.
I'd appreciate any suggestions/ideas/similar experiences.


Thanks,
