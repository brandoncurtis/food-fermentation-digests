Subject: making beer green


[I see folks are getting started in time this year...usually we seem to
end up waiting 'til the first week in March.]


The usual bar method of making beer green for St. Patrick's Day is to put
a drop of green food coloring in the glass before drawing/pouring the beer.
This level of coloring doesn't work out well for homebrew colored before
bottling, 'cause something seems to latch on to the color and precipitate
it out.  I don't know just what grabs it, but I've seen a pale-green beer
with bottle sediment of a most amazing hue.  Also, given a homebrew with
substantial malt, hence good color, the green food coloring (weakened a
bit) with the gold of the beer gives a rather unpleasant (IMNHRNWO) color.


Several years ago, I made a batch of beer for a going-away party on 3/17, 
with which I attempted to produce multiple colors in one batch.  (The batch
was labeled "SPA" on the caps, allowing everyone to think it was "St. Pat-
rick's Ale", when in fact it stood for "strangely polychromatic ale.":-)
I left some bottles plain and added red, green, or blue coloring to various
others.  The red worked out OK, although I didn't use enough color and it
faded a bit, giving a result approximately like a darker amber ale.  The
green gave the aforementioned bile (vile?!) green.  The blue did best at
producing the shade of green I wanted; I'd suggest this basic (blue+gold)
=> green approach.


The color seems to continue fading with age.  That shouldn't be too much
of a problem since if you start today you'll only have a few weeks in
bottle/keg.

  I may have fixed the EDME BREWKEG tap. After polishing of the keg of
SCUD bock (named for its exceedingly high carbonation due, I think to 
WYEAST 1007 {strange and sulphurous, beasties,they}), I dissasembled the
tap whlie still attached to said keg,, sterilized it and put a smidgen of
vaseline in the threads. I made sure that it did not touch the beer passage.
  I kept the keg full of H2O for a day in the fridge andto test, I tried the tap
(It works like a champ....for the time being)
  Now it's full of bitter/brown and I'll say more in about a week.
PS: At Richmond Brewers we were discussing WYEAST 1007 and came up with the
question "What would typify a German ale?"  We couldn't come up with
any regional or style type that would fit WYEASTs 1007 name?

bryan`at`tekgen.bv.tek.com writes about stuck fermentations and aeration.


While I can't comment for sure on the first issue, it seems like a lot
of people go through a lot of unnecessary trouble to aerate their wort.
Prior to pitching, I remove the red spring loaded thing from my bottle
filler, sanitize the white plastic tube, and put it in the neck of the
carboy and just whip the heck out of the wort for a few minutes.  When
I'm done, there is usually a good 2-3 inch head of foam on top.  It 
seems when you whip the tube around, the fluid passing by the submerged
end of the tube causes air to be bubbled in to the point where you can
hear it.  Anyhow, it must work pretty well, because until recently, I
have been letting my wort sit overnight to cool (just built a chiller)
and I'm guessing that warm wort can drive off dissolved oxygen pretty
well.  I typically pitch a 12-18 oz starter made with a wyeast packet
in the morning, immediately after this aeration process.  Fermentation
will usually take off full blast within 8-10 hours, sometimes even
sooner.


This method seems to work better than just attemptimg to slosh stuff
around in the filled carboy and is easier than rigging up some bubbler
pump.


This will probably not work well with a 5 gallon filled primary.
I use a 6.5 gallon carboy, so there's a good amount of head space
to get up a good velocity on the tube.

*I* used pipe thread tape -- figured it had to help, and that Teflon

I have some problems getting at the thing with a box wrench because the

Well, my friends and I did exactly this about a week ago for our latest batch
of pale ale.  It takes a fair amount of food coloring to tint five gallons of
beer.  (I didn't measure it, but probably about 1/4 to 1/2 of one of those
tiny squirt bottles you get at the grocery store.)  The color we achieved was,
well, interesting.  It's more of a sludgy green than the typical
St.-Patrick's-Day-green-beer green.  The beer was named "Pond Scum" after we
saw the color.  On the positive side, it's still green, the yeasties are fine,
the beer carbonated well, and it tastes great.  I think it will go over fine
on St. Patrick's day.


If you want to shock your brother, beer like this should do it. :-)

In HBD #582 Craig Flowers asks "where are the large enamel canning
pots"


As I'm the one who stirred all this talk up, I guess it's up to
me to summarize.


Craig asked about 36+ quart pots.  I've not found anything that large
except for 40 qt. stock pots in stainless or aluminum.  The best
source for these appears to be Rapids in Cedar Rapids MI.  Sorry, but
I don't have the address here at work.  Feel free to mail me if you're
interrested.


As for enamel, I looked all over town here without success.  A thorough
catalog search revealed the following:

8 gal. enamel over steel (~16.5" diameter)     $35

After a long and arduous search, I have determined that there is no such
thing as a 32+ qt. stainless pot which will straddle two burners.  The
best bet is to get an enamel pot and be more diligent about stirring.

Yep - I'm in San Jose, CA, in the east hills, an area which is very

be the third year.  The Willamette has not sprouted yet; in general, it
has been much less productive and vigorous than the Cascade.


I propogated the Cascade last year by digging straight down with a
sharp shovel to separate two bunches of sprouts at the root level.  One
I left, and one I moved to another hole.  Worked great - I'm planning
on repeating this year with both the Cascade and Willamette.

I hate to suggest this, but you're going to need to go back to the book
and study those temperatures a little further.  121F is a good
temperature to effect what's known as a *protein rest*, but will never
allow any starch conversion.  


I mash my body-ful beers at about 158F; for dryer beers somewhere in the
low 150s seems appropriate.

Why go to all that trouble?  I stir vigorously with a sanitized wire whisk

I can't tell if you're from Chicago.  If you are, I saw a variety of
enamel pots like you're probably seeking at a Mexican grocery (whose
name I can't remember)--it was on Diversey,  just past Richmond Street. 
A 32-quarter was selling for $22, which I thought was an excellent
price.  


You might also try a restaurant supply house.  Many of them carry a lot
of used equipment--I got a great 8 gallon, heavy-duty stainless
stockpot, with a drain valve on the bottom, for $10.

Some friends and I recently bought a Rotokeg from a homebrew supply place.  The
Rotokeg is a spherical plastic container with a tap on the front and a screw-on
top with an inlet for CO2; I'm sure it's similar to any other homebrew keg.  I
wonder if anyone has had any experience with these things.  They seem fairly
straightforward, but ours gave us some trouble.  We were unable to get it to
hold pressure for any length of time.  Consequently, we had to draw out the
beer a gallon at a time into a milk jug.  Is there a standard procedure for
using this kind of keg?  I suspect that we've been doing something wrong,
though I don't know what.  I'd appreciate any advice.

I'm a new homebrewer with bad eyesight.  Bottling is one of the most 
difficult tasks for me, I either get them far too full, (all over my shoes) 
or two-thirds full, neither is acceptable.  I have read a lot about kegging 
in this digest, but most of the discussion is by those already into this.  
I see in the Foxx catalog that I can get a kegging setup, complete, I 
think, for around $200.


Now, my questions, if I may.  What are the downsides of kegging, not 
counting the cost of the equipment.  Does the keg need to be refrigerated, 
(I assume so, but I thought I'd ask)?  Can I transfer directly from the 
secondary, or primary if that's all I use, to the keg?  How long does the 
beer remain good in the keg?  Is there more of a problem with freshness as 
the get becomes empty?  If I make a half batch of a new brew, can I keg 
that, or does tne keg need to be filled.


I guess those are enough for now.  Sorry I can't just pick up a book and 
read all about it, but I haven't found any homebrewing books on tape yet.  
Thanks to any and all for your patience and, hopefully, answers.

I was having some misgivings regarding my last post so I
looked it up in Miller's book, and sure enough...I was
wrong.


150F is a perfectly normal starch conversion temperature.
When I said 121, I was thinking of a protien rest temp.
Furthermore, it is the beta-amylase which works at low
temp and the alpha-amylase that works at higher temps.


So...please disregard my previous comments on the cause of
the high final gravity.  Next time I'll value accuracy over
speed when formulating a response.

I'm psyched to start saving slants of yeast, and am looking for sources for

Who sells in reasonable quantities for fair price?


And what is this Yeast Bank / Freeze Shield stuff? it sounds like you're

Finally, the continuing saga of my failure to culture yeast from bottles

Subject: kegging -- excessive foam and low carbonation


A while ago, I posted a tale of woe, trying to get my first keg batch to
carbonate. My second through fourth (most recent) had similar problems:
excessive head, but rather low carbonation. I primed with 1.5L saved wort
(at about 1.060, 1.050 and 1.080SG, respectively), according to
calculations a la Noonan. After Florian's recommendation, I reduced the CO2
pressure to sane levels, which meant I rarely had to apply CO2 from the
cylinder.


Now, the third batch, a stout, began to develop nice carbonation after
maybe 3 weeks, and the froth seemed to dissapate. I don't know if this is
due to sufficient aging, or reduced pressure in the keg due to consumption
of beer. The second and fourth batches didn't survive long enough in the
fridge to tell, really (tasted too good :-), although the fourth sat in the
keg at cellar temperature for 3 weeks before cooling. Some of this may be
due to the high gravities, I'm not sure.


Anyone else encounter similar behavior? When I bottled, I always got
textbook carbonation -- maybe even a little too much, and the froth was
normal for style(s)...


I've just put a fermenter full of lager (based on Norm Hardy's
Andech's/Munich -- thanks!) in the fridge, and I could use some hints on
fermenting and lagering it. (eg: if `lagering' the period *after* priming?
or does it apply to the whole cold-ferment, cold-prime, cold-store thing?)


Thanks again!
