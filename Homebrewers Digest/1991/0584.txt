     Hi all!   Welp, its time I jump into the homebrew game.  As soon
as I get a fermenter, etc, I'll be ready to go!  A few questions first,
though...


     I plan on buying a stock pot as a brewkettle.  Enameled, I've
heard, is good but I've also seen a "ceramic-on-steel" pot which is a
whole lot cheaper.  Would the ceramic on work just as well or are wierd
critters going to jump out of it and kill my beer?


     Two...I've noticed "dry" bottles (those that dry beer come in) are
a different shape and seem to be made of a thinner glass.  Is there any
reason not to use these?


     Three...Seirra Nevada Pale Ale is one of my favorites.  Is there a
fairly easy recipe which approximates SNPA?  or  what might I
experiment with to try to get it?


     Thanks!


TTFN

Subject:  Stuck Fermentations, O2 content, and MY working answer


I agree with Brian Olson (HBD #582) that these problems are caused by low O2
in the wort.  The easiest way I have found is to drop your cooling water (I use
a 2.5 gallon bottle of artesian water that has been cooled to near freezing)
through a funnel into the primary.  The water splashes about merrily and gives
it plently of time to pick up oxygen.  This is followed with pouring the wort
(remember it should by somewhat cooled, since boiling hot wort can hold almost
NO oxygen) into the fermenter to mix with the cooling water.  I have brewed
about 10 batches like this and all the ferments have been complete.  Admittedly,
I once brewed a heavyweight barley wine that took a pitstop halfway through
the ferment, but that was before I started working with this method.
A quick note about cooling with ice.  As sterile as it might be, ice contains
almost no oxygen either, losing it all in the process of freezing.  This may
also contribute to a stuck ferment.
Give it a shot.

Subject: Lagering


A question was raised about lagering.  Since the word means "to store" one
must imply that the beer has finished or just about finished fermenting.  The
storage could be considered in the secondary or the bottle or keg.  Personally,
I see no value of lagering for more than a month before bottling.  Then, and
this takes patience, I let the bottles remain at the lagered temperature
until they are consumed. Sometimes I run out of fridge space, so the basement
floor has to suffice.


With the Hunter Airstat hooked up to the fridge, here is a typical lager:
Primary:  65 - 48f - 53f for 3-4 weeks.  The raise up to 53 takes place
          during the last 4-5 days (diacetyl rest)
Secondary:  48 - 38f for 2-4 weeks.
Bottling:   44f or thereabouts.


Trying not to shock the yeast, I change the temperature a maximum of 4-5
degrees a day.  


Carbonation has always been satifactory, with enough time in the bottle.

I spoke too soon.  The trouble now seems to be that the little soft
plastic cap that provides the seals on the tap has hardened and
cracked.  Does anyone know where I can get a replacement cap?

In HOMEBREW Digest #580, Clay Phipps asked:

Clay may have been thinking of a series of items I posted a year ago
concerning my Search for the Perfect Pump.  At the time, I was using
an immersion chiller fabricated from 100' of 1/4" tubing, which
restricted the flow rate to the point where I doubt that much heat
was picked up by the last 75' of the coil.  My present chiller uses
50' of 3/8" tubing, and no longer requires all the waste-gate
whigmaleeries I needed with the other chiller.


The pump I've settled on is a Teel 1P579C.  Scarcely larger than a
pint beer bottle, this pump has two garden-hose fittings, and
connects to any 117v grounded outlet.  It's not silent, but is a lot
quieter than an electric drill.  I have no idea what it's flow rate
is, or what it cost (a friend was cleaning out his garage, and ...),
but from the quality of its construction, I would imagine it's not
cheap.

In HOMEBREW Digest #582, Bryan Olson offers:


>I've seen a few postings about fermentations that stopped at a high F.G,
>then seemed to restart for a little bit after racking.
>
>My 2 cents as to why this happens is there was not enough oxygen in the wort.


Hmm.  I don't think that's the cause.  Fermentation truly gets under
way when the oxygen in the wort is all gone, the mitochondria have
shut down, and the yeast have gone anaerobic.  Commercial producers
of bakers' yeast have discovered that the key to maximum yeast
production and minimum alcohol production is lots of oxygen.  In
effect, alcohol is a waste product of the yeasts' anaerobic
metabolism.  We aerate the wort to help the colony multiply rapidly
after inoculation.


>Is anyone using sanitize/sterilized air or medical oxygen to oxygenate thier
>wort? If so, I'd like to hear what they are using.


This topic came up at the last meeting of my homebrew club, and it
seems that at least one of the members has been using filtered air
for some time.  His filter is a length of large (>1") plexiglass
pipe, which he packs full of sterile cotton, and hooks to an
automotive air compressor.  That must move enough air to really
froth-up the wort!  I have no more information than that.

Subject:  Sterilizing your immersion wort cooler


If you have the type of wort cooler made of copper coils that carries cold
water through it and want to know how to sterilize it, relax.  Simply put the
cooler into the boiling wort during the last 10-15 minutes.  That's it!  Just
make sure the outside is clean.
