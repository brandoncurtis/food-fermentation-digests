In HBD Doug Roberts ask about A micro in St. Louis.


As far as i know there in none yet.  Dave Miller is romered to wanting
to start some type of brewery there.  The law was only recently changed
in MO regarding small brewing operations so not much has happened yet.
The only Micro in the state is near or in KC.


If you have any inclination of visiting the big boys of brewing
Budwiser, don't.  There brew house is closed for remodeling until 1991.

Sassafrass root has a compound in it (I forget it's name) which causes
cancer (Doesn't everything nowadays...)  BUT I've seen sassafrass extract
(for making tea) which has the nasty ingredient removed ($2/10oz).

I gave this a try a few months ago.  I used about one oz. of sassafras
bark, since I could not find any sassafras root around where I live.  I
made a light ale, with about 4 lbs of light malt extract and three lbs
of honey.  I added half the bark to the boil.  Unsatisfied with this, I
then made a tea with the other 1/2 oz and warm water, and added this to
my primary.


Unfortunately, I'm not very happy with the results.  The resultant beer
tastes mainly like tree bark!  It smells more or less like what I had
hoped it would, but the taste is bitter and strange enough to make
drinking this more work than pleasure.  I should have used less,
clearly, but I'm not sure that even a small amount would have been an
improvement over no sassafras bark at all.


Maybe sassafras root would work better than the bark; if you try it I
hope you'll post your results.  I've thought about trying a little root
beer extract in something like a stout.  Has anyone out there ever tried
this before?

From: Todd Enders - WD0BCI  <enders`at`plains.NoDak.edu>
Subject: Extract Efficiency, a Matter of Semantics




     I see that there's a little mixup as to the way Miller cites extract
efficency vs. Noonan.  Miller quotes extract efficiency as % of theoretical
maximum extract (ca. 35 points/lb/gal for lager malt), whereas Noonan gives
the actual percentage of sugars converted/extracted per pound of grain.


     So, if I'm getting 87-91% efficiency as per Miller, what I am saying
is that I'm getting 30-33 points/lb/gal.  It might be instructive to compare
both systems to obtain a sense of perspective.  But from my experience, it
should be relatively easy to get 30 points/lb/gal of extract if your mashing
procedures (grinding, temp. control, sparging, etc) are correct.


     Of course, the real issue is: do my procedures make good beer?  If so,
there is little incentive to change.  We are all striving to make good brews,
so the comparison of extract efficiency is of some value, at least to see how
our mashing compares with others (or with theoretical values).  But trying to
squeeze the last point or two out of your mash borders on excessive worry :-)!

Well, it worked just fine. It was stamped `March', and the pouch puffed up
nicely in one day, and a starter culture did it's thing in the time it took
to mash and brew a 10 gallon batch of Maibock.

1 cup/gallon is a lot of sugar?  If I want a strong cider, I will use 3-5 cups
PER GALLON of sugar...this usually comes out very dry and alcoholic, but still
tastes like apple cider.  I only use dextrose (corn), not cane/beet sugar.

I haven't had any problems with any soda bottles that don't have
the screw-off caps.  I have been told that the pressure in
american sodas is greater than the pressure the beer should be at
when carbonated (i.e., sodas often fizz when you open them, beer
should never fizz when you open it).


>Also I keep seeing things about a glass secondary (carboys),
>I can get plastic ones from water coolers, is there any harm
>in using a plastic one?


I don't know.  However, I have heard that most of these plastic
water cooler containers are not "food-grade", since they don't
expect to store anything acidic in them (like wort).  So stuff
could leach out of them.

This is typical.  I looked at three catalogs that sold 55 lb.

I have gotten 6 lb. packs of extract from Williams for as little

I think they are better than going to a store and buying one
pound or one can of something, but are about average for buying
large quantities mail order.


On the other hand, if those prices reflect the addition of the shipping
costs (55lb `at`$115 is great if $30 of that is shipping and $85 is basic
cost), then you got a great deal.


>Stainless Steel Stack Pots (5 gallon cap-$67.00

I have seen 10 gallons ones with copper bottoms for $99 (want to
get one for myself some day).

I read in this digest about draping a wet towel, with ends in a

Subject: Capping champagne bottles


I just got a case of champagne bottles and want to bottle in them.  The 
normal 28 mm. caps I use on beer bottles do fit, but they don't come down 
on the sides of the bottle top as snugly as they do on the 12 ox. bottles.  
My capper, an Italian device whose name I can't remember for my life, says 
that a set of tongs for 30 mm. caps may be obtained for champagne bottles.  
Am I going to have to get those different tongs and use 30 mm. caps, or 
will the caps I have do.  I tried a couple and the seal seems to be very 
tight, just the sides being funny as I just mentioned.  Do I have a 
problem?  (Not to worry, though!)

Subject: India Pale Ale


I'm teaching a friend of mine how to brew.  The second training batch will be
an extract India Pale Ale from the  CJoHB.  I have a question about the amount
of gypsum to add.  With a recipe for 5 gal of:


7 lb pale malt extract
1 lb crystal malt
.5 lb toasted pale malt
2 oz cfj90 aa=~9.8
.5 oz cascade aa=~6.8 (both pellet)
gypsum
Wyeast London Ale


what amount of gypsum would one want to use.  East Bay water has less than
10 ppm Ca and all the other good ions, so we're starting out with pilznerish
water.  I was thinking of adding 2 tsp. of the gypsum.  All comments on the
IPA brewing and water salt content for specific beer types welcomed.  Also,
what pH range are we talking about?  If it's not in there, how would one easily
change the pH? 


curious,

The only bottles I have been able to find that are that small are
the holiday Coke bottles.  It's expensive, though, so unless you
have someone who really likes Coke and likes the small bottles,
but doesn't mind you using them for beer, it isn't a very good

Subject: What about tea beer?




Okay, we've all heard about/made/tried beers with coffee in them.  I happen
to be a tea lover, and I'm wondering if anybody out there has ever made a
beer with tea.  Just before Christmas this year, I made a rather wonderful
liqueur with jasmine tea, and I'm becoming more and more convinced that a
beer made with some sort of tea would not at all be a bad idea.  Anybody out
there have any experience with this?  Any ideas as to why it might be a bad
idea?


And for those of you who want to try out making the Jasmine Tea Liqueur,
here's the recipe:


1 pint dark rum
1/2 cup jasmine tea
1 cup sugar syrup


Steep the tea in the rum for 24 hours, and remove.  Make the sugar syrup by
boiling 1 cup of sugar in 1/2 cup of water (it will be VERY thick).  When
the syrup cools, add to the rum.  It's ready to drink immediately.  This is
a very nice after dinner liqueur, but you may drink it any time you want to.
If the tea flavor is too strong, try steeping for a shorter time, cutting
down on the amount, etc.  Likewise, the amount of sugar may be a bit excessive
for many tastes, so experiment.


Cheers,


Paul

Subject: Campden vs yeast


I just finished working my way through the first of the recipes in the
``Making Mead'' book I've got (can't remember the authors -- they're
very British, the cover's orange).  The part that confuses me is the
adding of the Campden tablets.  The directions were something to the
effect of ``add two Campden tablets, wait 24 hours, then add the
yeast.''  The idea, as I understand it, is to kill all the little
beasties that managed to wander in while you weren't looking.  So why
doesn't the yeast die?  Especially since they say to add another
tablet after each racking.


If the theory is that the sulphite settles out, thus not coming into
contact with the yeast, it seems like any movement of the fermenter
runs a good chance of killing the yeast.


I think I'm confused....

A question about the 2nd place Pale Ale recipe from 1990 - Cascade Pale Ale:
It was exactly the same as the previous 1989 best of class winner, but the
1028 yeast attenuated further than planned.  I entered it as a British Bitter
and a Pale Ale.  The Pale Ale got the 2nd place.  The Brit Bitter got knocked
out in the 1st round.  


I just bottled this year's "version", the same except for .25 oz Cascade cones
in the secondary for dry hopping.  Very nice beer, fermented and conditioned
in 19 days.  It helps to get a proper yeast starter, indeed.
