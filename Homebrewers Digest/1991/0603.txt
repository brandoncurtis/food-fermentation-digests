Well, that is (was?) also the case with me.  I don't drink a lot
of beer, ranging from one to five bottles a week.  No one else in
the immediate vicinity drinks beer.


However, the beer keeps great in the cellar.  I just finished a
bitter I made a year and a half ago and it still tastes really
good.  I just don't brew as often as many others, plus I have
lots of different brews to choose from.


Plus, whenever we have a party, I don't have to buy any beer for
it :-).


Also, I usually use a couple of the 1 or 2-liter plastic soda
bottles, and save it for parties, either at my house or a
friend's.

Well, no matter what the size of your batch, the more yeast you
can put into it, the better.  I wouldn't divide dry yeast into
fourths or such, just use a whole packet or two even for small
batches.  You *can't* put too much yeast in the wort!!


There are ways of culturing yeast and saving it for later, but
I'm not qualified to tell anyone how to do it.

The best advice someone gave me early on was not to use too much
bleach, as already mentioned.  Two tablespoons per five gallons
is plenty.  Remember, the bleach you *smell* in the water is not
attacking bugs.


In my experience, five minutes after I dump the bleach solution
out of the fermenter, etc., I can't smell the bleach in there any
more.

A few digests back, I whined about apparently not being able to get yeast
to culture on slants -- there was no sign of life, infection or otherwise
after 4 days. Well, I got no replies :-(. 


Yesterday, I looked again, and there is some very slight lumpiness on the
carmel-colored agar^2. No furriness/fuzziness. No all-white patches, just
something which looks a little different than last week. 


What do your slants look like? What dilution of extract to you mix with
your agar? 


Thanks.

Subject: Original gravity estimate


I've been "estimating" initial gravity as follows:  Take a sample
of the boiling wort. Let it cool. Measure its gravity.  My boils
are about 3.5 gallons, so I add 1.5 gallons of water (at a gravity
of 1.0) to get 5 gallons.  So, if the wort measured 1.080, I would
estimate (3.5*1.080) + (1.5 * 1.0) = 5.28 worth of "weight" in the
full 5 gallons.  Divide by 5 to get 1.056 OG.  Not exact, but it 
should be close. Am I forgetting anything?

Subject: Chimay Yeast and Bottling Dates




In the recent discussions of the culturing of Chimay yeast
there have been two references to bottle dates.  I have a
bottle in my cellar that I'm saving until I'm ready to culture
the dregs.  I examined it the other day and can find no date
on it.  Is the date coded?  Where should I be looking?


I recieved the Chimay and a 750 ml bottle of Corsendonk Monks
Brown Ale for my birthday last month.  I split the Corsendonk
with the friend who gave it to me.  We had a religious experience!
As soon as it warms a little, I MUST make a trappist ale.  From
the discussion here and in Miller's book it seems there is really
no substitute for original trappist yeast.

I am looking for an extract recipe for Sheaf Stout.  Does anyone have one lying 
about?


While I am at it, I am also trying to put together a spreadsheet (or two, or...) 
to work with homebrew stuff.  One thing that I have wanted to have for a long 
time is a definitive discussion on conversion of grain to extract recipes. It is 
probably floating around somewhere, but I find that I have many bits and pieces 
of stuff relating to a lot of subjects, and correlating it gets to be a problem.  
So...does anyone have a writeup on the comparison of grain to malt extract syrup 
to DME around that could be mailed/posted?  Besides the pure quantity issue, are 
there any other issues (effect on hop extraction rates, etc.)?  Thanks, and


Cheers...Gary

Subject: Looking for All Grain Barleywine recipe




        Does anyone out there have any experience with
all-grain barleywines?  All of the recipes I've come across
are at least half extract.  Given the SG needed, that makes
a lot of sense.  Of course I don't have a lot of sense and
I want to try an all-grain batch anyway.
        I took the Anchor Steam Brewery tour recently, and 
they mumbled something about making Old Foghorn with
three sets of grain, or
sparging the grains three times or something like that
        Anyone done it successfully?.


        And a troubleshooting question - I've got a batch
that tastes almost,
but not quite like fresh squeezed grapefruit juice.
I'd welcome any comments on that too.


        Thanks,

Subject:      Re: Homebrew Digest #602 (March 22, 1991


Howdy,
    My brew partners and i have just bought our first package of Wyeast.
First of all, i understand from the directions on the package that the
yeast should be started some time before we're ready to pitch it.  The
package says "1 day for every month after the code date".  Do i really
believe this?  Break the inner seal, adn the yeast will be ready for pitching
in 2 days?
    Second:  We would like to use this yeast in another fermentation (after
the current one).  I gather from recent net comments that if we wanted to
use this yeast immediately after the current fermentation, we could just
dump some of the trub from the bottom of the 1st fermenter into the new
one.  Is this correct?
    Now, suppose that we don't want 10 gals of the same beer around (picky
aren't we?).  How can we keep the yeast around 'till we're ready for it?
I've heard something about putting it in a beer bottle (all very sanitized)
and putting in the fridge, and then getting it started in a mixture of water
and malt before pitching.  Is this basically correct?  What details do i need?
   Thanks for all your help ...

Subject: Using rocks to boil the wort


Being a geology-type person, I hope I can talk semi-knowledgably about
rocks, even if I can't tell malt from hops! :)
The question about rocks shattering at high heat gets a resounding NO!
If the rock does not contain water trapped in pockets that can convert to
steam, nothing will explode.  Crystalline rocks (ie granites) are probably
better for this, because they were formed at temperatures above 600 degrees
a lot of time any way.  Besides, with limestones you run the risk of limey
beer due to dissolution of the calcium carbonate - definitely not a treat!
  As for poisonous rocks, believe it or not, the answer could well be yes.
Many rock-forming minerals contain such unpleasantries as lead, arsenic,
or heavy metals.  As a general rule, stay away from any pretty, metallic
minerals.  They'll contain things like sulphides, which would help to
sterilize the wort, but wouldn't do much for the yeast.  As I say, they
probably use granitic rocks, due to the low content of soluble minerals.

I believe you have rauchbier confused with steinbier.  The former is a normal
dark lager beer made with malt that has been dried over smokey beech log
fires.  Steinbier is indeed made by adding hot rocks to the wort to induce
it to boil.

Subject: culturing Chimay Ale yeast




I've Cultured two batches so far, both from 750 ml bottles
of Chimay Red Ale.  I boiled about 3/4 lb of dry malt extract
for each bottle.  The frist bottle I stored at 65 F, and it
wasn't going at all after 2 days, so I moved it to a kitchen
cupboard at 75-80F.  Within a day it was spurting through the airlock.
I started the second batch and left it at 75F, and it took
2 days to reach the air lock.  Both batches took off and fermented
very rapidly for around a day and a half, and then it was over
just like that.  like 150 blubs a minute from an econo-lock
air lock after 24-36 hours.  less than 1 blub a minute 24 hours
later.

RE: HBD #599 - Dan Graham's yeast questions:


Dan: I am a novice brewer (2 extract dry yeast, 4 partial mash yweast) batches
Taking the advice from the HBD the best things I did for taste improvement
were partial mash and liquid yeast.  Since it takes as much effort, equipment
cost, 3 gallon and 5 gallon carboys are about the same price, I would brew in
5 gallon batches.  I use a glass 6.5G ($12) primary  and glass 5G secondary.
   A pak of liquid yeast isn't like a pak of dry yeast from a population
stand point.  Per Miller's book on homebrewing it is important to have a
large population at pitch time. Hence the need to produce a starter.  With
the use of this method I have had very active fermentation within 24 hours
of pitching on all 4 batches using liquid yeast.  It takes about 4-5 days from
when I activate the culture in the pak until my starter is ready to pitch.
I usally activate on Monday and brew on Friday.
    This is how I re/use liquid yeast: 1) start per directions on the pouch.
2) When inflated, 1-2 days, make a starter I use a 1.5L wine bottle half full
of wort, insert air lock 2 days later its ready to pitch.  I make this wort
from 6oz dry malt in quart of water and boil 15 minutes with a few hop pellets
and 1/2tsp yeast nutrient.  Cool in fridge add strained contents to the wine
bottle and pitch pouch contents when starter fluid is at room temp.  When the
starter exhibits active fermentation, about 2 days I brew.
  3) After pitching and mixing the starter with may 5 gallons of wort I save
6 oz of the aerated wort in a bottle with air lock in my fridge.  I have reused
a month later by letting it sit at room temp for a couple days and pitching to
a starter wort like #2 above with no problems.  I do this to get 2 batches per
yweast which yeilds a per batch cost for yeast of 2.50 +- .25  I did not
mention sanitation, it is a given for all brewing.  Also I did not try to
3culture this.   I will not brew another batch with dry yeast, the results
are worth the extra cost, $2.5 vs $1, and would recommend it for any brewer.
Using this method I plan 2 batches ahead.  I used 1056 AM ale yeast for 2 test
batches which were very similar to see if my process worked.  I used 1028
British ale for a Brown Ale and Bitter.  I try to use the type yeast that goes
with a certain style.  I will use 1056 again. (and again)

Before using store boght vinegar read the lable.  It is often pasturized

         My two cents for what ever that's worth (~2 cents) would be to 
put the liquid yeast in a sterile bottle (I like 1/2 gallon booze bottles)
of a sugar (not table) & water mixture and put an airlock on it. This would 
probably be sufficient for short periods of time. Each time you need some 
yeast, sterilize the outer lip of the bottle and pour accordingly. For longer
periods > 1 week, I would suggest the same sugar/water mix, but 1/4 fill 
several sterile beer bottles instead. Sterilize the bottlecaps and cap em. I
have used this latter technique to store lager yeast for several weeks at a 
pop in my fridge. I highly recomend refrigerating the sealed containers as 
glass grenades & wives don't mix.
        My other suggestion would be to get higher quality friends
(ie the kind that likes good homebrew) and then you could brew in more
economical quantities. Try combining your ham radio & beer making hobbies
and broadcast at 1000w that a new batch is ready.

Subject: Chlorine


A lot of people are using what I would consider far too much chlorine bleach.
A few teaspoons per gallon is lots! In fact I use it very little, except for
blasting otherwise tough to clean stains. I rely on Sanitone soap powder,
and lots of boiling water.


Note that according to my wife, the food scientist, many food grade plastics
will absorb fairly large amounts of chlorine, and they will difuse out later
This means that if you use a large concentration of chlorinw bleach in 
or on plastic, you can rinse your brains out, and still end up with chlorine 
that is in the plastic coming out and contaminating you beer causing
astringent, plastic, bandaid smell problems. 
 THis discussion came up because a friend ran into this problem after
changing one thing in his process. He had went from detergent, and boiling 
water cleaning, to nuking a stubborn yeast stain out of a plastic primary 
fermenter carboy with chlorine bleach!!


Also I think boiling caps is ridiculous! I've used somewhere between 
5000 - 10000 caps right out of the box, and never had a problem ever. 
Remember, by the time you get to bottling, your beer has enough alcohol
to be fairly resistant to contamination. This is the reason beer 
was a popular beverage over the last few thousand years, because it 
can be made in less than clean room conditions and still be sdafe to drink.
Granted, keeping things clean gives you more consistant results, and I'm
not advocating dirtiness, but back off with the sever chemical warfare!

I'm new to this mailing list and have never tried to brew my own beer. I would 
like to try it but don't know where to start. I would apreciate any advice 
anyone would care to give: good books, recepies, materials, etc.. I am currently 
stationed in Japan, and am sure it is not permited to brew here, but I will be 
returning to the States soon. I will be located in the St. Louis area (the 
Ilinois side of the river), I would also appreciate information about suppliers, 
and rules in this area.


I'm sorry if this is a request that you get so often that you hate to see it 
comming, but thanks if you can help!!
