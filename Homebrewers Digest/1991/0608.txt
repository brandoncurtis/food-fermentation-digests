Back in mid Feb. an article in hbdigest appeared on ancient brews.  One
spicing combination called for coriander seed and orange peel.  Has anyone
out there made such a beer? If so what quantities and infusion method was
used?
     I added a tea of 6 star anise to my last batch, it smelled pretty good.
Bottle tomorrow!

        Subject: Chimay, Lambic? Mais, Non!
        
        In HOMEBREW Digest #605, Ron Garrison asked:
        
        >        ...  Does the Chimay yeast or do any other of the Belgian beers
        > provide the same or similar yeast culture that is found in Lambics?
        
        With a certain hesitation, I must say no.  While there are a
        few similar components in the "inoculum" (both contain Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae and at least one bacterial component), the effect is
        altogether different.  The distinguishing factor in Chimay's flavor
        profile is a range of spicy flavors, dominated by 4-vinyl guaiacol.
        In lambics, sourness dominates, with a lactic acid tang being the
        most noted flavor.  Some other Belgian beers share this


Hmm, that 4-vinyl guaiacol reference reminded me to tell you of
the article that appeared in the February, 1991 issue of R&D Magazine,
on pp. 74 to 78.  It is titled "What Makes Beer Taste Great?", by
Jay R. Powell and Senja V. Compton (of Bio-Rad, Digilab Division, in
Cambridge, MA).  The article is about the use of a GC/FTIR interface
accessory, along with use of a liquid nitrogen cold trap, and use
of Gram-Schmidt chromatograms to analyze the components present in
aqueous systems.  So, they decided to try this on five brews:
Singha Lager (Thailand); McEwan's Scotch Ale (Scotland); Guiness Extra
Stout (Ireland); Schultheiss Berliner Weissebeir (Berlin); and Liefman's
Frambozenbier (Belgium).  they list a whole bunch of various components
which they found in beer, some sample G-S chromatogram for the five brews,
and a pretty good description of the brews...


R&D Magazine is one of those 'free-bie' magazines you can get at work...

I hear this a lot, but I've yet to hear a satisfactory explanation.
Exactly why/how do yeast "mutate" or "weaken" over multiple
"generations"?  Wouldn't the weaker yeast suffer a competitive
disadvantage with respect to the stronger yeast?


And how do you explain the experience of the yeast-caking guy from
a coupla weeks back -- he was doing ten fermentations from a single
packet of dry yeast.

Subject: DRY VS. LIQUID EXTRACTS.


Recently, there has been a discussion of the merits of dry versus liquid 
extracts.  Several posters say they have switched to dry because it is 
easier to control and less costly.  The control aspect I can understand 
easily.  The price part is what's giving me trouble.


Now, dry extract has 25% more bang per unit weight than liquid, according 
to a chart posted in this digest back in December, 1988.  The chart listed 
the sg of fermentables given as a rating for one pound in one gallon of 
water.  Dry malt extract was listed as having an sg of 45, and syrup as 36. 
 That is indeed a 25% increase for the dry.  Problem is, I can't find dry 
extract for the same price as liquid, or for even only 25% more.  


I checked my twenty odd catalogs and found liquid extract for as low as 
$1.15 per pound, but could not find dry extract (in bulk) for less than 
$2.05 per pound.


Maybe I have the wrong catalogs????

Subject: How to make a sweet mead.


I am looking for information on how to make a "Sweet" Mead.  I
remember having a Mead that was made in Missouri that was very sweet
and it would make a nice after dinner drink.  I was hoping to make
something similar.  


I have made several mead batches that have had a "dry" taste.  Most if not
all of the honey had been converted to alcohol in these batches.  To make a
sweet mead do you stop the yeast before it converts all of the sugars and if so
how do you do it? 


Thanks.

Subject: SUPPLY SOURCES


I have just discovered this forum and am ready to pose my first question.  What
mail order firms exist that offer a variety of brewing supplies at good prices?
Please include their phone numbers and your assessment of their wares.


I have discovered Cottage Brewing Supply (name changed from Continental Brewing
) in Daytona, Florida (1-800-553-2399, Extension 20).  Their prices, after
shipping, are not really better than retail plus sales tax, but their selection
is very good.
                                Thanks,

Dan'l, you must have talked to someone other than I just did.  I
called Carolina Biological Supply's west-coast number, and she
refused to consider sending a free catalog to anything but a school.
Businesses pay full list.  Looks like you lucked out.

Subject: Water Conservation


As I was brewing yesterday, I began to contemplate the water rationing
that has been imposed on many drought stricken California homebrewers.
Naturally, my thoughts turned towards conservation, especially while
my counterflow wort chiller did its thing.


Does anyone out there have a sense for how much water is required for 
each gallon of brew produced ? I'm sure it's alot considering sterilization,
rinsing, wort production, wort cooling, and cleanup. The amount would
probably vary substantially depending on whether you were an extract or
all grain brewer. I've read that very efficient commercial breweries 
(AB etc.) are able to get their water/beer ratio down to 8/1.


Furthermore, what ideas have people come up with for water conservation ?


I've tried cleaning up with the water coming out of my wort chiller.
That water is pretty cool, which is an inconvenience, but it can be done.


Suggestions ?

Hello all.  I am travelling to Milwaukee, Chicago and parts
of Minnesota this summer and would greatly appreciate people's
recommendations for the brew pubs in those areas.  There have
been postings recently discussing the Milwaukee area so the info
I really need is on Chicago (and the surrounding area) and
Minnesota.


Thanks,

        Does anybody know whether is is a coincidence that National Homebrew
Day is the same day (May 4) as the feast of St. Florian (one of the many patronsof brewers)?
        Also, if anybody has a (mostly) extract recipie for Oatmeal stout, couldyou send it to me.

This is my first posting.  I made my first batch this weekend.  Problem--
I cleansed the brewpot with B-Brite.  However I forgot to rinse with
water.  Will this kill the brew.  Should I trash it now and start over?


B-Brite is made of Sodium Carbonate, and sodium silicateIt says it does not
contain chlorine or bisulfate or organic compounds.


I appreciate any help you can give--please email directly.

Are you sure about this Jay?  I believe that getting "light struck" is
associated with oxidation which is a problem whether or not you have
hops in your beer or not.  Or is getting  "light struck" associated with
the hop oils?  Anyone else care to comment?
