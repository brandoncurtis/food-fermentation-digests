Subject: saving water


In HD 608, CR Saikley asks how other brewers save water.


I'm not the most conservative of brewers, but I manage to squeak under my
daily allotment of 50 gallons, and I brew almost weekly.


I save all water that runs through equipment to rinse it, like through the
wort-chiller before and after brewing, and I save all chlorined water that
either sits in equipment or runs through it to sanitize it.  I save the former
in whatever steel vessels are around, and I save the latter in plastic.


I don't re-use this water in the brewery.  I lug it upstairs five gallons at
a time and use it to flush the toilet.  If I don't have any company over, one
brew's waste water lasts a week.  (If I am expecting company, I flush the
toilet in advance, in the normal, wonderfully effective, well-designed way.)


I feel good about how much water I save by almost never flushing the toilet.
However, I'm convinced that if God had intended toilets to not be flushed, she
wouldn't have given them little handles, and I can't wait to get back to normal
water availability here.

Subject: Air on bottling


I have yet to bottle my first batch, but maybe I have a suggestion for 
those who are having problems with air in their bottles.


I took a homebrew course, and the instructor said that when you 
bottle, bang the bottle on the table then immediately cap.  WHen the 
beer foams up--it will remove the oxygen and the cap will keep it out.


Anyone have any experience with this?

The definitive Guide to Nitrogen Compounds:


N2 -  Diatomic Nitrogen: Colorless, odorless, almost inert
NO -  Nitric Oxide:      A colorless, poisonous intermediate in the production 
                         of nitric acid (HNO3)
N2O - Nitrous Oxide:     Laughing Gas
NO2 - Nitrogen Dioxide:  Poisonous brown gas found in smog.


Of these, I suspect that N2 is probably the one that Guiness uses, although,
N2O is an interesting idea. . .It does come in the same kind of cannister.
It's been a while since I took Chem, anybody know anything about the
reactivity of  N2O with beer?  I thought I remembered it being a fairly stable
compund, but that was many homebrews ago. . .

Subject:      saving water


I too was shocked at the amount of water wasted in using an immersion wort
chiller.  What I do is put the coil (20 ft. 3/8" id copper) into a sink of
ice water, set the hot wort on the counter next to the sink, and my primary
on a chair in front of the counter, and siphon the wort through *slowly*.
You can adjust the rate of flow by moving the exit tube up or down.  It takes
a lot of ice.  I freeze milk cartons and plastic ice cream buckets full (or if
I forget, I run to the MiniMart and buy some during the boil) and it always
melts amazingly quickly.  It takes about 20-30 minutes to chill a 5 gallon
batch down to 60-70 degrees.  When you are done, you have a sink full of warm
water to clean up with.

Subject: Carbonation in kegs
Full-Name: Dan Needham


     I recently kegged up a batch of wheat beer in my new draft system.
     I followed a chart of CO2 PSI vs. Temp for different volumes of
     CO2 for different styles of beer.  At 42 degrees F.  I used 17.5
     PSI to (hopefully) yield about 2.9 Volumes of CO2 in the beer.  I
     rocked the keg around for a few minutes while the CO2 was being
     applied through the down-tube via a beverage fitting.  Four days
     later when I tapped the keg it was nearly flat!  I don't think the
     keg leaks -- I bought it new, and tested it for pressure retention
     before I put beer in it.  There was extremely little head space in
     the full keg.  It was stored at about 40 degrees F. on its side
     during the four days.


     Would any keg veterans like to comment on this?  Suggestions as to
     what might have happened or proven processes that you use would 
     be appreciated.


     The beer was quite good even with the low carbonation ;-)

Subject: stuck barleywine




My partners and I brewed a barleywine recently (O.G. ~1.075), starting it with
a packet of Whitbread ale yeast.  We allowed the ale yeast to go as far as it
would willingly go, and racked to a secondary (`at` ~1.035).  The beer tasted
great at this point, though still quite sweet.  We pitched a packet of Red
Star champagne yeast to ferment it further, and nothing happened.  We have
aerated, added yeast nutrient, pitched another packet of champagne yeast
(started this time), aerated some more, but none of these has made the beer go
any further.  The recipe is based on Wayne Allen's recently posted Marigold
Ale, with 10 lbs. M&F light extract and 2 lbs. honey, and our carboy is
in a 65-70 deg. F room.  Any ideas out there on how to get our fermentation to 
continue?

                (near Sunrise Mall)


        We had so much fun last October, that we're going to do it all
        over again! There were six brewers, with a couple different
        beer types each. It was interesting to taste a variety of beers
        made by a variety of brewers!


        So, if you live anywhere near Sacramento California, come on
        over, and bring a beer of your choice. I want to hold it to
        two beers, cause last time we had many more choices to sample
        than we could handle. We tried though :-)


        Be careful if you want to bring a brown ale though. Last time
        I think everybody brought a Brown Ale! Especially the R+R Brown
        Ale kit :-)


        I'll be providing munchies that go together good with beer.


        Please RSVP so I can make sure to get directions distributed.

Subject:      Dinner With Michael Jackson




  As a neophyte home brewer and relative newcomer to this discussion
group, I was fortunate enough to meet another net.homebrewer in the
Ithaca area.  He quickly invited me to join the Ithaca Homebrew Club
and I enthusiastically accepted.  Well if timing is everything, I would
seem to have a lot going for me.  Micheal Jackson was coincidentally
invited to speak at Cornell and host the first club meeting I was to
attned.
  The club took Mr. Jackson out to dinner before the meeting.  The
restaurant that was selected was the Coyote Loco.  Naive me, I never
made the connection that it was a Mexican restaurant.  Immagine meeting
a British brew expert, drinking American homebrew, and eating Mexican
food.
  I arrived a bit early.  I had yet to meet any of the club members (even
the one who introduced me to the club, since we had only spoken over the
computer).  I stood near the bar patiently with my hands in my pockets.
I didn't know exactly what to expect when Mr. Jackson would be brought in.
Although he's not exactly a household name (well...), I still expected him
to be surrounded by people asking questions and competing for attention.
Rather, he was led in and stood near the bar directly next to me.  The two
of us were essentially equally alone.  I quickly introduced myself, and
then proceded to stand there unable to think of anything to say.  I hadn't
really prepared anything because I assumed I wouldn't have much of a chance
in Hell to talk to him at all.
  Gradually the club members turned and introduced themselves and began to
chat.  Until then I didn't know which were brewers and which were just
customers.  I soon realized that I was the only one besides Mr. Jackson
who was wearing a tie.  Jeans and T-shirts seemed to be the standard dress.
  I was immediately struck by the casual attitude of the whole affair.  One
of the brewers asked Mr. Jackson about the popularity of cider in England.
He responded that since it is taxed differently from beer and hence much
less expensive that it was primarily popular among the younger crowd who
"just want to get shit-faced".  I knew right then and there that all
formalities and decorum were right out the window.
  There were around 15 people in attendance.  The restaurant had two tables
set up to seat us all.  When it came time to sit I nabbed a corner seat as
I'm left handed and didn't want to compete for elbow space.  Much to my
surprise, Mr. Jackson got seated right next to me.  I was still having
trouble thinking of things to say.  As a two-batch homebrewer I couldn't
come up with any questions that wouldn't have been analogous to asking
Bobby Fisher how a rook moves.  To be honest I was quite content to just
sit there and listen to the conversation.
  Before the waiter came around, some of the other brewers at the table
opened bottles of their brew for him to try.  He tried each in turn, but
made the honest observation that sipping beer between bites of nachos and
salsa wasn't the most professional way to adjudicate the flavors.
  One of the brewers at the table asked him how he got his start in this
rather unique field.  He said that he was first a newspaper journalist,
and that he kept trying to work beer into his pieces simply because he
really liked beer.  One thing led to another and here he is.  They asked
him for some previews on his piece on the Baltic Breweries, but he simply
said that his memory wouldn't be able to do justice to his writing and
that we should just be patient and wait for the rest of the article to
come out.
  Mr. Jackson remained at our table through the salad course, but when the
main dish arrived he moved to the other table so that others could share
his company.  If first impressions say anything, his would say that he's
an unpretentious, unassuming kind man who simply enjoys good beer and the
company of good people.  You would think him more a rather quiet, portly
pub-goer than the world renown expert that he is.  All in all, though this
wound up being a rather unspectacular event, it is a memory that I will
cherish the rest of my life.

Subject: using maize in recipes


        I've been drinking my first batch of beer.  It's a bit thin and
        the head doesn't last long, though it is well carbonated. I think
        I can solve this problem by adding flaked maize to the original
        recipe.  Is this correct?


        Given the correctness of the first assumption, I'd like to get 
        some guidelines on the use of flaked maize, if possible.  
        My first brew used a can of M+F unhopped light and a can of 
        M+F unhopped dark, 2 oz. Cascade Loose and Red Star Ale Yeast
        in a 5 gal. batch.  The beer was was primed with 1.2 oz corn sugar
        per gallon and bottled in Grolsch bottles.  How much flaked maize
        would I add to this recipe and would I add it to the boiling wort
        and when would I add it to the wort, etc.?


        Many thanks.  This brewer's network has been invaluable for
        yet another beginning homebrewer.

I guess coincidence, but let's try to find out / figure out.  National
Homebrew Day should be the first Saturday in May.  Does the feast of St.
Florian have a fixed day-in-month, or is it also a first-Saturday?  I dug
back into the old Zymurgy--the first mention I see of National Homebrew Day
is in the second issue, where it's the day of the first National Homebrew
competition, May 5, 1979.  So my naive guess is that Charlie picked a
weekend spring day that was likely to be nice for a festival, and
christened it.
