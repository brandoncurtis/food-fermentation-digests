There are only two actual brew-pubs I know of in Minneapolis: one is
called "Taps" and is located in the Riverplace center across the
river from downtown Minneapolis.  The other is called "Sherlock's"
and is located in one of the western suburbs - Minnetonka as I
recall.  Sherlock's certainly has the better reputation, (and
better food as well).  I've only tried one of the beers at Taps,
and found it merely adequate.  I don't remember what it was called,
but it was an average pale ale.  They were in some financial
difficulty last summer/fall and may have succumbed - I haven't
heard.  


There are some other brew-related things worth seeing there though. 
The Summit brewery on University Avenue in St. Paul offers tours
and samples if you call ahead.  They make a delicious pale ale and
a porter, plus some seasonal brews as well.


In New Ulm (about 80 miles southwest of the Twin Cities), Schell's
brewery is worth a visit.  They make some excellent brews - both
under their own name and number of "brewed under license for...."
products.  


The other small brewer in the sate is called Cold Spring and is
located in the town of Cold Spring, 15 miles south of St. Cloud. 
Last I heard they weren't giving tours or samples, but call to be
sure.  Some of their brews are allright, others have the virtue of
being incredibly inexpensive.

I have heard this before, but have also heard that you are just
as likely to find dried corn sugar in the dry malt extract as you
are to find liquid corn sugar in the liquid malt extract.  Anyone
else with any evidence?  The safest bet is to buy from suppliers
who tell you what is in the extract, such as with Yellow Dog.


Personally, I wouldn't brew without some dry malt extract in the
house, because I can use it in any quantity I want, whether for
priming or during the brew.


However, I really like the 6 lb. boil-in bags of extract.  Every
so often I order a bunch, typically from Williams Brewing (they
tell you what malt went into the extract).  I haven't bought a
can of extract in years (except for Yellow Dog).

I guess there has been plenty of discussion of this already.  Let
me just add that when I toured the Old Dominion Brewery, I asked
about their yeast.  He said that they were surprised to find that
they hadn't had to stop re-using their yeast yet (at that time
they had been brewing weekly for about 6 months).  Every week or
two they took samples and had them analyzed in a lab.

My only question would be related to the amount of "head space",
or air between the top of the beer and the cap.  I leave about
1/4 to 1/8 of an inch between the top of the beer and the cap.  I
used to be more haphazard, with about an inch of variation.  This
seemed to cause uneven carbonation within a batch (more head
space, less carbonation).


Could the yeast involved make that much of a difference?

I don't know, but I have had pretty good success adding some
malted wheat to my recipes to increase the head retention.  So I
usually add a little crystal malt and wheat malt now to my
extract beers.

I'd like to add that most people also recommend that you crack the
grains first.  If you don't have a grain mill you can do this with
a rolling pin.  Try not to grind the husks into powder, as that will
result in astringency.  (You'll probably get some powder from the
sugary innards of the grains, but that's of no consequence.)


Crystal malt will add color, sweetness, body, and a caramel note.
Cara-pils will add sweetness and body only.


I suggest that you consider steeping the grains at 168 degrees for
15-20 minutes rather than removing them immediately when the water
reaches that point.  I have removed them by pouring the whole mess
through a wire mesh colander resting on a big bucket.  The grains
end up in the garden, and tea gets poured back into the boiler.


I've not seen any recipes calling for as much as two pounds of
crystal malt.  That certainly doesn't mean that they don't exist
and are not wonderfully tasty, but the ones I've seen all call for
a pound or less.  Also, cracking two pounds of crystal malt with a
rolling pin will take you a long time -- I have found it to be a
rather tedious job.

Subject: Slow fermentation


In my first batch, I used Red Star Ale yeast.  There was a steady 
increase in seconds per glub, and fermentation was complete in 6
days.  My last two batches I used Whitbread Ale yeast.  In both cases, 
fermentation was vigorous within 24 hours (about 1 glub per second), 
and it steadily slowed to about 1 glub every minute and a half.
In both batches, however, it stayed at this rate for about two weeks
before reaching a specific gravity low enough for me to bottle.
Why is it getting "stuck" at this slow rate?  Low yeast population?
Or is this typical?  All my brews have been partial mashes, all malt, 
room temperature for fermentation about 65-70 degrees.  I think 
I am aerating the wort sufficiently before pitching the yeast, and 
I rehydrate the yeast before pitching.  My fermentation lock is 
the S type if this helps in interpreting my glubs per second figures.

Lanny (and others follwoing this thread) be sure that those are *GLASS*
carbouys. If not I would not adopt this technique. Only certain types of
plastic are rated for containing alcohol. Other types leach carcinogens in
contact with alcohol. I am farily certain that the plastic bottles used by many
bottled water companies these days *ARE NOT* safe for storing alcohol. You
should either use only glass, or contact the FDA or BATF to determine which
types of plastic are safe for alcohol storage and then investigate as to
whether the carbouys (if they're plastic) are safe.


I'd sure hate to see someone inadvertently poison themselves with homebrew.

Gee that's so scientific. I usually just chill the beer down to 35-40F and hit
it with 25-30 lbs CO2 till you hear it stop flowing. Unhook the CO2 shake it up
like 40-50 times, toss it back in the fridge. I do this 2 or 3 days in a row,
then let it sit in cold store for another 3-10 days (depends on my mood and how
low I am on homebrew). Never had a problem this way, no messy charts to consult
:-) :-)




CR says> I've never investigated the minimum time required to carbonate,
>but I've applied gas on Thursday and had fizzy beer on Friday.


I'd watch out though. I did this once and all my fittings weren't quite sealed
(not me, on my kegs ....) This resulted in leaking away a whole tank of CO2. 
Remeber one thing, we're talking about dissolviong a gas into a liquid so rates
of dissolution (sp?) apply here. The rate is temperature dependent. My
technique puts a higher pressure of CO2 over the beer, one that exceeds the
equilibrium pressure at the beer temp, thus the excess CO2 will dissolve into
tthe beer over time. The lower the temp (up to freezing) the higher the rate at
which the gas will get absorbed into the liquid. By hitting the tank up 2 or 3
days in a row I replace the gas that has dissolved (thus lowering the CO2
pressure over the beer) with more gas and re-establish an overpressure. There
is some practical saturation level at which the beer will cease absorbing CO2.
The last thing I do before tapping is to yank the pressure release valve to let
this overpressure off. Then I hit the beer with a normal dispensing pressure
(say 7-10lbs).


I hope veryone understood that, or at least somebody understood that, I mean
what the heck it works for me.


Just a not on yeast repitching. Before microbiology came into vogue the
standard technique was to pour the new batch of beer into the fermenters over
the top of the yeast cake left by the old batch. While from a scientific
standpoint this may not be optimal it obviously worked well for centuries
(either that or the Brits and Germans were drinking cruddy beer until Louis
Pasteur the Frenchamn came along hmmm......).

Just south of the airport, next to the Airport Lounge (local Strip Joint) is
supposed to be the oldest continuously operating tavern in Milwaukee.  I can
not remember the name, but you can't miss the place if you find the Lounge next
store.  Last time I was there (1988) they had about 60 taps.  Many imports as
well as many micros, including 2 or 3 Sprecher brews (Black Bavarian is my
favorite).  The atmosphere can get pretty rowdy depending on what night it is. 
Generally tho, it is a pleasant place to try a variety of brews on most
evenings.


If you are like most homebrewers, considering going pro at some point in the
future, don't miss Sprecher's.  Randy left Pabst (if memory serves) to do his
own thing.  He built his brewery from recycled equipment and is a very
interesting guy to talk with.  Beers are excellent also.  Lakefront is another
"seat of pants" operation.  They were not open when I was in town last, but I
have read many nice things about the guys behind the place as well as their

I dunno, Carl.  Why don't you give it a try, and report back ...


Actually, something like this is frequently done in commercial
brewing.  The examples that come to mind are Pere Theodore's culture
of 5 yeast strains in Chimay, and Whitbread's 3 strains, as
described by George Fix in the "Yeast" special issue of Zymurgy
('89?).  As I recall, two of those three strains acted pretty much
as you describe, one being a rapid starter but getting "stuck" after
the simple sugars were gone, and the other being a slow starter but
quite attenuative.  The role of the third strain seemed to be to
flocculate cleanly, taking the other two with it.


This approach wouldn't be easy to translate into strains available
at the local homebrew store, though I have read of folks making
truly heavy barleywines who pitch an ale yeast first, and then a
Champagne yeast a week or so later.  The problem with pitching them
at the same time is yeast's otherwise desirable trait of "taking
over" its environment.  Whichever strain established itself first
might very well "off" the other strain.

Father Barleywine said better what I was trying to say.  Your
argument is reasonable, but it assumes the only difference between
the two are the effectiveness of their mitochondria.  If it were
also true, for example, that the respiratory-deficient isolates 
budded more rapidly and survived more budding cycles under anaerobic
conditions than the "normal" strain, the model I presented would
more closely resemble the observed effect.

Ran across this message belatedly the other day, and a friend and I
realized that bees require the sun to navigate by, so even in warm
climates you could probably get away with boiling the honey at night.
Even if they were "woken up" (could they be?) by the honey, they
shouldn't be able to find your house without the sun up.  Just a
thought...

Subject: Weizen extract question


I've got a can of the Ireks Weizen extract (6.6 lbs).  One set of
directions calls for 1 lb of corn sugar (for 5 gal) which, of course, I
don't want to add.  I also do not want to add any dry malt as it may
imbalance the intended amount of wheat to barly.  I have a 3.5 gal
fermenter and was wondering if anyone thought it would be better to make
the smaller amount?  Would it end up too strong?  Weizens, if I remember
correctly, should propably have a starting gravity of 1.032 - 1.035.  Am I
better off making a 5 gal batch (with no additives) or a 3 gal batch (with
no additives)?

Subject: Thanks, Catamount Porter and Carolina Bio.


First, many thanks to all who send me copies of the digests 62 and 63.  I 
got four or five copies, and all were sincerely appreciated.


Second, I picked up a sixer of Catamount Porter yesterday.  Had one last 
evening ... delicious!  I am not experienced in many different types of 
beer, and am learning slowly.  Is this a good example of a porter?  Is it 
generally regarded as a good beer?  I loved it, but that might be 
inexperience speaking.  The flavor seems rather complex, going through 
several stages in the mouth.  The lingering bitterness is very satisfying.  


The store had some Sam Adams Doublebok, but my wallet was empty.  Is this 
good stuff?


Third, I received my catalog from Carolina Biological on Friday.  Wow!  
This is the mother of all catalogs.  There is plenty of lab stuff that I am 
going to order, and a lot of stuff I didn't even know I could get too.  My 
wife wants to spend about a thousand dollars from it.  (Maybe I'll send the 
bill to the person who mentioned it in the first place, [grin]).


The only disadvantage is that culture tubes come in quantaties of a hundred 
odd.  I could probably use a dozen or so, but I don't think I'm going to 
have a hundred different slants.  Ah well, at least I can order an organic 
chemistry modeling set, (otherwise known as organic tinkertoys).

Subject: bottled water


   wrt lhoff`at`acc.stolaf.edu's suggestions
   1. Bottled water can vary widely. It usually has less chlorine than tap
water, but I'd ask the bottler to be sure. Also, if it really is spring
water (instead of municipal water that's been filtered and dechlorinated---
an association of municipal waterworks says that's a common stunt) the
mineral profile will be different from tap water, so you should get a
complete analysis if you're thinking of adding minerals.
   2. The prices quoted are rather high. I can get 5 gallons of bottled
water at the local supermarket for $3 (in recyclable plastic containers); I
would expect Mpls to be cheaper than Boston, so you're probably paying (in
effect) at least $2 "rent" on the carboy each time in addition to the $6
tied up in the deposit. At this rate, $20-25 for a carboy you own is good
if you think you're going to keep brewing for more than a few batches.

    Hey all!  Welp, I'm on my third batch and have run into a problem...I
have the smell of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide) coming from my beer!  The
Complete Joy of H B'ing says this a a common problem.  What can I expect?
Will the smell go away eventually?  Is my beer gonna taste bad (due to the
Hydrogen sulfide anywauz ;->)?  What?
 
     Also, my last batch, a barley wine using Tom Caxton kits, is still
pretty sweet after a couple of week aging?  Should the stuff get less
sweet?  And if so can I look forward to 12oz glass grenades in my closet?

Subject: % fermentables


Is there any info. available regarding the percent of fermentable
sugar in diferent types of malt?  I never use "recipes", so I don't know
what the FG will be beforehand, but I was thinking there may be a way to
calculate it.


Let's say you have an OG of 1.100, just to make the math easier, and a
type of yeast that will attenuate to 75%.  Then you should get a final 
gravity of 1.025 .  But the yeast will really only eat the fermentable 
sugar.  So if, let's say, 80% of the gravity, or 1.080, is fermentable 
sugar, then the yeast will eat (.75 * .080 ) = .060 of the gravity, which 
leaves a final SG of 1.040.


So, if you know the attenuativeness (?) of the yeast, the percent of
fermentable sugar, and the original gravity, you should be able to
calculate the final gravity.  The actual % of fermentable sugar is the
only missing variable.  Any thoughts?

Howdy all!
        
        Any of you heading to Buffalo sometime?  Just in case
you are and you get thirsty for good beer, visit the Buffalo Brewing
Company in Lackawanna.  It's owned by the guy who owns the Buffalo
and Rochester Brewpubs, which have been making extract-based beers for
a while.  The new brewery makes all-grain beers using only German malt.
Right now they have their flagship "Buffalo Lager", which is a version
of Munich Helles,  plus a Pilsner, a Weiss (in the Bavarian Weizen style),
and a Bock.  All four are really nice, well-made beers, and you can get them
at stores in the area or at the brewery, which has a restaurant/bar attached.
        To get there, take I-90 to the Lackawanna exit and take Ridge Rd
west ~1 mile.  At the light for Abbott Rd, make a left (south) and go 
~1 1/2 miles.  The brewery is on the left, 1830 Abbott Rd, just before
the road goes under the viaduct.  Awesome beers;  well worth the trip.
Ask about good Buffalo chicken wings while you're there;  why the hell not?
I recommend the Anchor Bar, but have heard that Duff's is great, too.


Enjoy,

The other night I was showing a friend of mine the ferocity with which
the Chimay yeast in my latest batch of Berry Hoppy (OK, trite and dumb
I know) Belge-oid Ale was devouring the berries, and he suggested that
it would be neat to amplify the sound of the CO2 bubbling out the tube
in the blowoff bottle.  Having a microphone and digital signal
processor handy, I promptly did so.  It's very rewarding, and I
recommend it to those with the means.

     There has been some talk lately of difficulties in carbonating
kegs, which caught my eye because I have had two flat batches from
my new plastic Rotokeg.  Papazian says to just let it build its own
carbonation, so I haven't put CO2 in it until pressure falls from
drawing out beer.  Is one in fact supposed to put in more pressure
for a few days before drawing the beer?

Subject: Goofy wort chiller / advice?


In trying to get the most efficient chill possible, I rigged up this for a
wort chiller, but I have some minor questions to people using this.  Sorry if
this one has been hashed recently, but I picked up HBD with #574, haven't got
around to the archives, and feel I should contribute SOMETHING, dammit!


An immersion chiller should be more efficient with a constant flow of water
for heat exchange, plus, I had heard about people doing this.  What I did was
straighten out about a 20' length of copper tubing, and shove it inside about
23' of garden hose, starting at the end I cut off of the garden hose.  Then I
cut a hole in the garden hose about four feet down from the connector end of
the hose, pushed the end of the copper tube through, and made sure there was
about 6" sticking out of the end of the hose and also through the hole I cut.
Then I sealed the hole with RTV silicone, and coiled the whole mess back up
again. Here is a simplistic diagram:


<---3'----><--------------------20'--------------><-6"->
 __      \\  <-- copper tubing
|||\______\\_____________________________________
|||        \\                                    |------  <-- copper tubing
||| _____________________________________________|------
|||/
     ^-- garden hose


  The concept is, to run the syphon right from a lauter-tun (or strainer in a
bucket), through the copper tubing, while running cold water through the
garden hose to achieve a REAL fast chill.  Also, you can easily regulate the
output temperature simply by running more or less tap water through the hose.
I just got done inaugurating this device, and here are my observations:


1)  This thing does NOT need 20' of copper tubing.  Maybe an immersion cooler
might need that length, but I was barely running the tap water, and getting
wort out at ~60F.  I would think 8-10' would suffice.  I may split mine into
two wort chillers.


2)  My question:  Everybody I know who uses a device like this uses a
counterflow, that is, cold tap water running in an opposite direction to the
wort flow.  However, it just made intuitive sense to me to send both in the
same direction: The hottest wort will exchange the heat with the coldest water
and some sort of equilibrium will be reached by the time you reach the end
of the chiller.  Why would the chiller be more effective with counterflow?
Which method makes it easier to regulate temperature?  Enquiring minds just
GOTTA know!


thanks,
