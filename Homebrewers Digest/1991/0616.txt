Don't you folks in Evanston feel too bad...it *is* possible to recover from
being a dry town.  The notes said that Evanston had been dry 'til '71,
right?  Boulder was dry until '65, I believe (that's +/- a year), and now
look--it's the Center of the Universe for homebrewing (well, c'mon, what
would you call the home of Beer'n'Steer and the AHA?:-), and has two
breweries, which is reasonable for a town of 10^5.  People still take the
occasional cheap shot, but you can always overlook that when there's good
fresh local ale!

Subject: Wort Chiller Caveat...




If you consider building a wort chiller, be careful about the oils inside
your copper tubing.  I noticed little silvery flecks coming out of mine
after running boiling water through it.  These were actually little bits
of grease.  I took a cotton swab, soaked in rubbing alcohol, and rubbed the
inside of the tubing....yuck!  Black gunk!  So I uncoiled the thing, snaked
stiff wire through, and pulled a string with cotton balls tied onto the ends
soaked in soap, rinsed it, and then pulled rubbing alcohol soaked cotton 
through.  Cold water may not loosen this grease, but hot water did so enough
to let me know it was there, but not enough so as to clean it out.  Does anyone
else notice this problem, and/or found an easier way to fix it?

        Hi,
                I'm looking at ordering some hop rhizomes and would like some
information. The types that are available to me are:
        Cascade
        Hallertauer
        Williamette
        Tettnanger
        Nugget


        I was thinking of ordering Hallertauer,Tettnanger and Nugget. The 
thing is I've never seen or used Nugget. So could someone give me an idea
what it is like?[I'm basically looking at has a high alpha bittering hop].
Since I'm supposed to have my order in my the middle of next week I would
appreciate email responses.
        
        The second question I have concerns priming. I don't use corn sugar
so I would like to prime with normal white table sugar. Does anybody know how
they relate in terms of amounts to add?[I've used the fact that cane sugar
is supposedly 45degrees extract/lb versus 35/lb for corn sugar but this gave
me flat beer :-(] Since priming is normally my only sugar addition I'm not
worried about it affecting the taste.
        Thanks
                Nick

For the next few months, my brew-room will naturally stay at 60 degF,
a little cold for an ale, and too warm for a lager.  So how about a
steam beer?  Anyone got a recipe for an Anchor Steam-like beer?

Subject: Barley wine from mash


I tried to post this last week, but it bounced?




In my post of the other day about all grain barley wine, I suggested
using the first run runoff to get a high gravity 1/2 batch. In that article,
I presented it as if I meant to use no sparge water. This of course would
probably compact the filter bed, and wreck it. This is not what I 
meant to say. What I meant was recycle the wort until the runoff is clear,
to set the bed, and then add sparge water slowly to the top, as you runoff the
high gravity wort. By knowing how much wort is in the bed to start, measuring
runoff gravity, or watching for a color change, you can predict/detect when 
you hav ranoff all the initial wort, and are starting to get the sparge water
coming through. This is when you will get a fairly sudden drop in the 
gravity of the runoff, and should consider your barley wine wort complete, and
save the rest of the runoff for the  lower gravity, or extract beer.


Hope this makes  more sense??

Kris Weiss (love that name!) asks:


>Now wait a second here. Is this the same Florian that contributes to this
>journal? Is Florian the Dreamer also Florian the Holy?? I dunno -- the guy
>always struck me as some kind of troublemaker...


I was named after my uncle Florian, who was in turn named after St. Florian.


St. Florian is the Bavarian Patron Saint of the Fire Brigade.  A couple of
years ago i was in an outdoor shop in Munich (one of the biggest sport
shops in the world).  It was converted from an old grand house, you know,
the kind with the square cedar beams that are about 500 years old.  In
this house were examples of the old lamp stands that were built into the
wall.  This is a concave notch cut out of the wall where they put a
candle in the old days.  The concave acted like a parabolic mirror, to
reflect the light out into the room.  In these concave areas, they used
to paint a picture and write something witty, for orneriness.  One of
the areas had a painting of St. Florian hovering in the clouds above
a burning building (probably a brewery), and had an inscription written
in Bayerish which translated something like,


"Dear St. Florian, protect this house...burn another..."


Florian is an extremely Bayerish name.  In the middle of Garmish-
Partenkirchen is a town square called "Floriansplatz".  This is, many
Germans argue, the most beautiful place in all of Germany.  I was there
in 1986 on a perfectly clear blue day.  With the Zugspitze in the
background, I had a beer in "Florianstuberl", in direct earshot of
the Floriansplatz fountain.  The beer was so perfect, it was like
no beer I have ever tasted since.  Pity that we home brewers can't
duplicate it exactly.  The stuff that memories are made of.


Florian, the not-so-holy.

The *ONLY* grades suitable are USP (suitable for use as pharmaceuticals)
and FCC (suitable for use as foods).  I glanced at an old Carolina
catalog after I read Dan's message: anything that's USP or FCC is
clearly labled as such.  For example, they have many grades of Calcium 
Chloride.  The one Dan should buy is labled Reagent *AND* USP.  If
it just says Reagent, or just says Lab grade, STAY AWAY FROM IT.
This is really something you don't want to mess around with- 
non USP/FCC grade stuff is frequently purified with some truely
nasty stuff.  Some off the shelf Calcium Chloride in our lab
had heavy metals measureing in the parts per million range- the
FDA limit is somewhere in the  low parts per BILLION.


Let's be CAREFUL out there!

Subject: Can I forfeit the deposit and use the Busch keg?




As the Subject line indicates, one of my roommates had a party and got one
of those nifty large Busch kegs with the hand-pump. He had to leave a $40
deposit for it. This got me wondering.... I know this has been discussed in
the past, but I don't remember when, so I'm asking again. I'd appreciate
either direct answers, or references to previous issues in the HBD
archives. So, getting to the question, Can I use this keg for kegging my
beer? If so, are there any modifications, special instructions, etc...
I figure that $40 is not too bad to pay for a kegging system. Any comments/
Thanks in advance.

There was a recent request for info on brewpubs in Florida. So once
again I dug into the archives, expecting the brewpub scene in Florida
to be similar to its neighboring states'. WOW - Was I surprised!!!
Florida is blessed with 12 brewpubs (ahhh, the joyous decadence of 
Spring Break). It ranks third behind California and Oregon in total
number of brewpubs, and is tied for fourth in number of microbreweries
and brewpubs combined.


Here's what I found:


Clearwater - Hops Grill and Bar #1


Ft. Meyers - Kidder's Ale House


Ft. Lauderdale - River Walk Brewery


Gainesville - Mill Bakery, Brewery and Eatery #1
            - Market Street Pub


Miami - Florida Brewing Co.


Pensacola - McGuire's Irish Pub and Brewery


Sarasota - Sarasota Brewing Co.


Tallahassee - Mill Bakery, Brewery and Eatery #2


Tampa - Hops Grill and Bar #2
      - Tampa Bay Brewing Co.


Winter Park - Mill Bakery, Brewery and Eatery #3


Interested parties can email me for addresses. If anyone knows of
new openings or closures :--<, please let me know.


Cheers,

My local homebrew store isn't that local, and the selection and prices
are pretty poor.  People have mentioned ordering through the mail.
I'd be interested in finding out the numbers/addresses of some places.


Much thanks!

Rob Bradley (bradley`at`math.nwu.edu) slipped in a shot at Eastern Washington
U. in #615.


Well Rob, having moved from WSU (in Pullman, WA) just a year and a half ago
I can tell you that there are be worse places to be employed than Cheney.
Pullman for one, though it does have a good pub called Rico's.  Cheney
is close to Spokane, where Jim's Homebrew Supply is located.  In my limited
experience with homebrew shops this is quite a good establishment.  Tom (the
current owner) stocks quite a wide variety of extracts, grains, hops, yeasts,
and wine stuff, as well as all the usual brewing equipment.  His prices are
quite competitive and he is a good guy, always willing to talk homebrew and
give advice when asked for it.  In addition he has a liquor license and stocks
an incredible selection of micro and import brews.  I noticed recently that he
is advertising as a mail order supplier now and would encourage those of you
who are looking for such to contact him for a catalog.  By the way, he is the
sponsor of the Rauchbier catagory for the AHA national competition.  If anyone
needs the address he has an ad in the 1990 special Hops issue of Zymurgy, or
you can e-mail directly to me and I will supply the information.

This talk of pots to span two elements made me think of a copper
"boiler" I have in the basement that would span two burners, and should
hold 10- 15 gallons. The only problem is that it is fairly oxidized from
about 20 years of sitting in basements. Any idaes on an easy way to clean
it? I seem to remember you could remove the axide off of copper with an
acid, but forget which one? Nitric? Muriatic? any ideas?


Thanks Bill Crick  Brewius, Oxide, Sum!

   In perusing my new Carolina Biological catalog, I have found some chemicals 
   that would be useful in tayloring the mineral profile of my water.  My 
   question ot any lab types out there:  Can I assume that a reagent grade 
   chemical will be safe to use in my beer, (providing that the chemical is 
   not poisonous in the first place).


STOP!  I would suggest not using lab grade or reagent grade chemicals.
Although they may be pure, you don't know what the trace elements are.
If you can, select pharmaceutical grade or USP-grade.  Lab/reagent/ACS
grades are good for lab work where one is not consuming them.  A prime
example is 100% ethanol.  This stuff is pure, but to get it to 100%,
they use benzene (or something like that), so there is a trace of
benzene left in the ethanol.  (It turns out that 95% ethanol is safer,
since simple distillation will get you to 95% from ethanol-water
mixtures.)
