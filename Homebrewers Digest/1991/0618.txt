    I talked to a friend who is a Belgian national to see what he knew about
this beer/place.  He did not know the beer but he did know of Vleteren.  It
is not a town but rather an area of the Flemish part of Belgium.  His guess as
to the significance of the other letters and numbers on the top was that it is
the address of the abbey.  His parents, who still live in Belgium, are coming
over for three months in October and his father has offered to bring me up to
six beers of my choice (that he can obtain relatively easily) from over there.
He is also going to try and bring several glasses and/or mugs including a 
Chimay one if he can get it.  He will also be bringing a somewhat larger
quantity of Jupiler for his son as it is his favorite beer.  Unfortunately,
Jupiler is not the best example of the finer Belgian beers.  I have another
Belgian friend who is a rabid fan of the Trappist ales and he probably would
know more about this particular one as he hails from the Flemish section of
Belgium.  I have been unable to contact him as of yet.

How much sparge water do you use?? How far do you sparge (ie till the liquid
runs completely clear)?? Perhaps you are oversparging, thus taking extra
astringency otherwise left in the grain bed along into the wort. This is a
typical problem.


Grain/Water ratios vary with brewing technique, grain used and recipe, though
the number I'm familiar with is 1qt. per pound of grain.


I used to have an Edme pressure Barrel, I spent $40 on the thing and it never
really carbonated properly, even when using CO2 capsules to inject extra
pressure. Today I wish I had just gone all the way and gotten the Cornelius
System like I have now and not wasted the $40. IMHO the 3 or 5 gallon Cornelius
System is much more reliable and durable and produces much better results, and
the extra cost was well worth it for what I consider a permanent piece of
equipment.

Ken Flowers asked why root beer doesn't turn into soda bombs:


Yeast need not only sugar but also nutrients in order to proceed with
their fermentation duties.  Since cane sugar has hardly any nutrients, 
the yeast quit working even though there is plenty of sugar left to munch 
on.  Thus a sweet soda pop that is naturally carbonated.


Rob Caton, the Jackson book referred to is _The World Guide to Beer_,
by 'Sir' Michael his rotund self.  Available at a Walden's or 
B.Dalton's near you.  A manificent resource.  Pictures and 
descriptions of damn near every beer in the world.  Highly recommended 
to all homebrewers and a must for those preparing for the BJCP exam.


John Melby's idea of putting together a database of pubs, breweries, 
and homebrew shops is a great idea.  I'd suggest sticking it in the 
archives. Beer travelers of the world could search there first before 
departure.  We could get the information we want directly and 
immediately and save our fellow brew-buddies the task of writing the 
rather lengthy exposes of such and such a place, many times repeating
a discussion from a few months past.

Brewing with the Derry air is fine, but the Derry water is the pits!


First off, much thanks to all who put up with my novice questions.  The 
first couple of batches of homebrew turned out very good.  The problem is 
that our city water has a rather strong chlorint taste, plus some other off 
tastes and odors.  I can identify these impurities in the beer, so I want 
to get a water purifier.  I'd rather start with very pure water and add 
back the minerals necessary for a good brew than continue using this city 
hydrobilge.


I am confronted with three basic types of water purification units:  
Distillation, UV/carbon block and reverse osmosis with pre and post 
filters.  I've ruled out distillation because they are more expensive and 
use a lot of electricity.  Between the other two I can't decide.  Each 
claims that the other type is no good, or not so good.  What are thoughts 
on these devices?


The carbon block with UV sterilization seems very good to me, but the 
reverse osmosis people claim that the carbon won't remove the metallic ions 
from the water.  The carbon folks claim that reverse osmosis is wasteful 
and no better than the carbon blocks.


I want the water to be as pure as possible.  What do various of y'all 
think?  If you email to me directly, I'll post a summary to the net.

The explanation given to me is that the soda mix doesn't have enough
nutrients for the yeast to do much. Unfortunately, this is _wrong_, and
I ended up with some very highly carbonated ginger ale when I tried it.
Though there may not be enough nutrient for a good fermentation, your
soda will slowly but surely gain pressure.


You must put your soda pop in the refrigerator when it reaches a good
level of carbonation, or it will (really) pop!

Ken Flowers asks about root beer.


The yeast in root beer will have a harder time growing than the yeast in
regular beer, due to the lack of yeast nutrients.  However, root beer still has
copious bomb-making potential.  I made one batch of ginger beer in Pepsi
bottles and came home one day to find a sticky slush of ginger beer and glass,
and splinters of glass embedded in the wall at eye height.


After your root beer has gone the minimum amount of time needed to carbonate
it, put it in the fridge.  I've found that at Florida temperatures, 12 hours
is sufficient to carbonate.  Drink it within a week or so.

Precisely the question I asked myself, and of course the answer
is "Nothing". Unless of course, you have a spare fridge to house
all your bottles at near freezing temperatures or dump something in
to kill off the yeast after you magically devine that the bottles are
sufficiently carbonated..

Unfortunately they have. I always follow recipes religiously the
first time before modifying them. So when I mixed up a batch of
root beer from a Hires extract, I somehow forgot everything I had
ever learned about brewing. I did get a bit suspicious of the mumbo jumbo
in the recipe about adding more or less yeast depending on the temperature.
Adding yeast is essentially a binary process. Either the yeast
grows or it doesn't. And it doesn't stop until it runs out of sugar.
The recipe calls for over NINE cups of sugar. Just think what your
beer would turn out like if you primed it with that much sugar.
I spent every evening for a couple of weeks opening bottles to release
the pressure. Then I had to add more sugar before serving for sweetening.
My kids didn't get to the point of staggering around, but
they did swear it was the best root beer they ever had :-)


The recipe I came up with (and works well for me) is:
Use one cup of sugar at bottling time (5+ gallon batch).
Before serving, put 1/4 to 1/3 cup sugar per 750 ml of liquid
(depending on your sweet tooth) in a clean bottle, pour in one bottle
of root beer, shake.
Adding the sugar directly to the root beer doesn't work well
because it foams all over the place.

Ken Flowers talks about rootbeer:

NOTHING!!!  This is very important.  I have exploded more than one
batch of rootbeer in my time.  I have, however devised a fairly safe
way to make soda pop (using yeast to carbonate it).  First, use only
plastic bottles (and only new ones to boot).  Plastic bottles will
make a mess when they explode, but won't usually kill people.
Secondly use a yeast that is fairly temperature dependent (an ale
yeast is good -- bread yeast, lager yeast, champagne or wine yeast
are all out).  After you bottle, squeeze the bottles periodically
until they are hard.  Put them in the freezer.  When they get cold
enough (almost frozen), take them out and decant the liquid off of the yeast.
rebottle and store the bottles in the fridge.  I have found that this
method gets rid of most of the yeasty taste and will give you much more
control over the carbonation level.  It's well worth the extra work.


Marty Albini asks about a pure Weizen beer yeast:


MeV sells one.  I can't rememer the number, but it is mentioned in the
Zymurgy sepcial issue on yeast.


Greg asks about husky tasting yeast:


Your method basically looks OK, but I can see a few places where you might
be going wrong.  When you are applying heat (and adding hot water) to
the mash, make sure you stir like crazy.  As long as you get no hot spots
above 168 degrees F, you will be OK as far as huskiness goes.  Also, I
reommend a mash out as this will make your sparge go a little easier.
The next possibility is that you are oversparging.  A final pH of 6.0 is
a bit high.  Fix mentions that the industry standard is around 5.8
(Warning: possible faulty memory on this point :-)).  The two batches I have
tested have a final pH of around 5.5 (I usually get very good extraction).
Finally, you may be getting grains in the boil.  I recommend recirculating
your sparge until it starts to come clear (although, watch that final
pH, you don't want it to get too high).  You also have to watch out for
leaching stuff out of the grains that will adversly affect head retention.
As long as you keep the recirculation below 2 gallons, this should be
no problem.

I just made a 6 gallon batch of orange ginger mead:


15 lb clover honey
juice from 1 orange (because I had no citric acid)
6 oz grated ginger
1 oz halletauer hops


combined above ingredients, brought to a boil.
took out a little wort, cooled down, added champagne yeast
and shook.  boiled the remaining wort 30 min.
added another .5 oz halletauer hops. boiled 30 min.
turned off heat.  cut 4-5 lbs of oranges in half, and squeezed
into the wort.  Threw the hallves right in after squeezing.
let sit 15 min.  sparged into cold water, while removing the
oragne halves and squeezing the last bit out (with clean 
hands - very hot - ouch!).  added yeast starter when cool.
I got a S.G. of 1.088 at 85F.  It's been fermenting like
a mad dog for almost a week now.  I'm not going to rack it
to a secondary until I slows down a little - Nothing's
settled out (except for a little bit of yeast) with the
rapid fermentation constantly stirring it up. 


Anyway, hope this helps anybody who wants to try making
mead get the S.G right. btw, I practically had an orgasm eating
the last bit of fruit out of the hot, honey-soaked orange
halves after I was done.

Subject: Invasion of the Yeast People???


For the second time recently, after I gave a beer novice a bottle
of my homebrew, they became very interested in brewing for themselves.


Now that got me thinking.  If anyone ever read "The Selfish Gene" by
Richard Dawkins, it may explain the reason for a sudden desire to
be a homebrewer.  In the book, Dawkins posits that it is really the
genes that control everything and human beings are nothing more than
a gene's way of making more genes.


Therefore it seems entirely reasonable that the yeasts used in homebrewing
have mutated to control our very thoughts.  Right now there are millions,
nay, trillions! of yeasts inside your body telling you to MAKE MORE BEER!


On the other hand, maybe they just liked my beer....

Howdy everyone.  I'm new both to this list and to homebrewing.


When I was in England a while back, I tried several different brands of hard
sparkling cider, and loved them all.  The only brand name I remember was 
"Strongbow."  They were all very very dry, and really tasty.


I'm writing to inquire whether anyone has a recipe  for such stuff, or, even
better, has made it themselves.  Around September here in the Northeast,
you can get excellent freshly-pressed apple cider from local orchards, so
I thought I might try making some then.

<Omni, and another whose name I cannot remember, in Ft. Lauderdale right
<on New River.  There is nothing in the phone book listed for "Florida
<Brewing Co." 


The pub in Ft. Lautertun is probably :


        River Walk Brewery
        132 Isle of Venice
        Ft. Lautertun, FL  33301
        305-463-2337


The records we have at the Celebrator Beer News indicate that there
is a Florida Brewing Co/Garlic Grill & Brewpub at :


        1840 NE 4th Ave
        Miami, FL  33132
        305-358-5731


I spoke with these folks today (4/17), it turns out that this place and
Zum Alten Fritz are the same. Directory assistance has both the Florida 
Brewing Co, and Garlic Grill & Brewpub listed at the above number. ZAF's
number is 305-374-7610. I don't know why they maintain three distinct names,
and two phone numbers

<So what I want to do is create a more formal database that I can query
<asking things like
<what pubs are in San Jose
<what microbrewerys are in San Francisco or in the 808 area code
<what beer stores are near Tulsa
<and so on.


<I already have a large amount of semi-formatted data (around a 100K
<annotated list of pubs including notes and comments from the net).
<Has anyone else already got such a program?  Would anyone else be
<willing to contribute their list of pubs for such an effort?


Sounds like a great idea, John. I'd be happy to give you access to the 
Celebrator's records.  We've talked about creating such a database, but
thusfar it's only talk.


But alas, we stray from the topic of homebrew. So I pose a question :


        Does S. Delbruckii have oxygen requirements similar to
        standard brewing strains, like S. Cerevisiae and S. Uvarum ??


I'll be making a wheat beer soon, and would like to learn more about
the metabolism of S. Delbruckiiiii. If I use a mixed strain, will lots
of O2 favor one strain over the others?? Can a pure strain of S. Delbruckii
be used satisfactorily?? Any input would be appreciated.


A friend recently returned from Munich with a bottle of Amertaller 
Weizen which is unequivocally the finest libation in the Universe 
(beats a Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster hands down!!). So I plan to 
culture the dregs.The brewery is very tiny, so I doubt they filter 
out the Delbruckii and then add a different strain to bottle condition. 
This is how the large German breweries make HefeWeizen (according to 
Dave Miller - me thinks).
