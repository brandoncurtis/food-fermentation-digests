A few comments regarding items in HBD #621:


Chris Hudson asks: ...but has anyone out there tried quart Mason Jars rather
that bottles?


  I'd recommend that you save the Mason Jars for the output from your still
Chris.  If you are planning to carbonate you beer the Mason Jars will probably
not withstand the pressure.


Andy Wilcox asks about the MeV German Alt yeast,


  I haven't used this particular one, but have used one of the Wyeast German
Alt cultures with good results.  Don't worry too much about the color of the
yeast growing on your slant, as long as it looks clean and uniform.  If you
haven't seen it, there is a good article by Farnsworth in the Zymurgy special
yeast issue.  One of the things that he recommends is cooking up your slants
and letting them sit at room temperature for about 5 days to ensure that no
unwanted organisms have taken up residence in the tubes.  If you like the ALT
style and remain disappointed with some aspects of the MeV culture I would
recommend trying one of the Wyeast Alt cultures (I believe that they are
marketing two different Alt strains now).


John Binkley in responding to Randy Tidd's querry about using distilled and
spring water says he thinks spring water is ok.


  Probably, but check the label to see if it has an analysis.  Some of the
spring water I've seen being commercially marketed contains very high levels
of bicarbonates, which you probably shouldn't be putting too much of in your
wort regardless of whether it comes from a mash or extracts.  Also, the popular
press has lately run a lot of stories about unscrupulous operators who are
labelling and selling just about anything as spring water, seems that there
isn't much regulation in this area, or if it is it isn't being enforced too
vigorously.  Caveat emptor.


John Mireley asks about glassware,  lightly carbonated beers, and
hopped extracts.


  Given the recent posting (I can't remember the issue) from the poor soul
who had his carboy expire during a fermentation I'd be mightly hesitant to use
those carboys that look like they are already cracked.  After investing the
time and effort required to produce a batch of beer it would be a crying
shame to have the carboy crap out on you.  An being new to the hobby you might
even find yourself in a situation where you don't even have a beer to cry into.
  I claim no particular expertise on the topic of lightly conditioned beers,
but do remember reading that many of the styles of beer served in
the pubs in southern England are quite lightly carbonated.  If this is
what tickles your (and your wife's) fancy then you should make your beer that
way.  After all, isn't producing beer precisely as you like it what brewing
your own is all about?
  As to the hopped extracts, I wouldn't worry about having an overhopped
beer when using these as my sole source of fermentables.  These extracts
might be considered to be balanced, though if anything they are probably
conservative in their hopping rates both for reasons of economics and mass
marketing (if I may apply the term to a homebrew product).  You may find that
you want to add some bittering hops to the worts you produce from such
products.


  Finally, I don't think I've "publicly" thanked all those who so kindly
responded to my question about dry hopping, both here and directly to me.
I added the hops to the carboy before I racked the beer into the secondary,
they are now floating in an inch-thick mass at the top of the beer.  I'll be
bottling the stuff later this week and will report on it when it is ready
to be, and has begun to be, consumed.


Cheers,

That's what you get for living on the health-conscious west coast :-)
No, seriously, I can't quote you figures, but under that definition
I would bet that 85% of the adult populations of Germany and the UK
count as "problem drinkers".  If we extend it to the equivalent amount
of alcohol consumed in wine, add 98% of the populations of France and 
Italy.  In any case, add 99% of the readers of this newsgroup.


What makes a person an alcoholic is not quantity per se, but the
extent to which alcohol controls their behavior (eg interferes with
work and play, impairs their ability to operate heavy machinery, is
necessary for them to feel good etc).  My own consumption runs between
3 and 6 pints a week, at a rough guess, depending on how much evening
work I'm doing.  Much above that I start to notice that I'm putting on
weight, and cut back.  I think that's moderate; I don't think I'd
enjoy drinking a lot more than that.  I could well believe that a
large person could handle more without technically being a lush, though.


Someone more knowledgeable than I will have to talk about health
effects.  I'm sure that at 7 pints a week they are measurable,
and that somewhat fewer is somewhat better.  I bet that the difference
is small, however.  Special exception for pregnant people: I think
the best evidence is that anything beyond one or two beers a week
has significant negative effects on fetal health, and that none at
all is considered safest.

Subject: CLEANING COPPER TUBE


Greetings,


With all this talk about cleaning copper tubing I can't help but add my 
noise to the net.  I've spent a lot of time cleaning tubing (usually 
stainless steel, but...) and I have a suggestion that might not be 
practical (or even advisable, depending on how conservative one is).  For 
getting grease out of tubing acetone (major ingredient in nail polish 
remover) works pretty well.  There are better things like trichloroethylene, 
but that's quite unhealthy.  Even with a powerful solvent I have found that 
either scrubbing or agitation is necessary.  If you have access to acetone 
you might also have access to an ultrasonic agitator; that combination 
works pretty well.


About removing the acetone from your tube (acetone is not very good for you 
either), an alcohol rise followed by lots of water should work well.  I've 
used such a process (starting with TCE) to clean components of a gas system 
and it turned out clean at a level of parts per billion.  That should be 
clean enough for beer.


My disclaimer: I'm not suggesting that anyone actually do this, I'm just 
thinking out loud at my keyboard.


Good luck,
        Joe

On a related note... I've made some *very* authentic tasting 
pilsners using light extracts, saaz hops, a quality yeast,
and ~4 (FOUR) gallons of a U.S.P. water.  Boil with your
carbon filtered tap water (for the mineral component), and
then add the (agitated) USP water to your fermenter.  


This works well here in Florida, where our water is a bit
on the hard side.  Your mileage may vary.

Obviously, this is horse-crap. I got this same dogma when I had to go
through a alcohol awareness class.


Now if this were true, the Germans, French, Italian, Czech, etc, who drink
beer and wine with their meals must *all* be alcoholics. I mean, gosh --
even their *kids* drink the stuff!! :-)


When will the neo-prohibitionists wake up?


PS: at least the people from countries who treat beer/wine as a food (eg:
    quality and consumption rate) grow up treating it more responsibly than
    the folks in the US. Here, the two main rites of passage are a driving
    license and the ability to drink. Oh, yeah, and sex, which seems to be
    inextricably wound up with the previous two.

  Mike Sharp advertised Pediococcus cultures recently. I'm curious about how
closely related this type of Pediococcus is to the Pediococcus that scares
the bejesus out of commercial non-Lambic breweries? I suggest folks explore
this before letting this bacteria into their homes.
  I hate like hell to mention this and feel Mike's offer of slants is a
great idea. Hopefully I'm wrong and this is a "friendly" Pediococcus and
not the one that is hard to kill and which can permanently infect brewing
environments.
  Speaking of mailing slants, I've found that cutting a block of styrofoam
and drilling it allows for a well insulated, light shipping package that can 
be reused many times.

>Does anyone have any hard information regarding long term
>physiological and/or psychological affects of drinking (home
>brew) beer at the rate of 5-6 pints a week? What about 8-10 pints
>a week?


I have a pint with dinner, and a few more on the weekends, so I guess that puts
me in the 8-10 per week range, at least the 5-6. So just ask anyone who knows
me (in person or via my long term presence on this digest) what the
psychological effects of long term consumption are :-)!!


I do remember one discussion regarding a symbiotic bacteria that causes
flatulence. Seems that this bacteria consumes dead yeast. It occurs naturally
in beer in small amounts. It ends up in your body when you drink the fresh beer
and ends up consuming the yeast in the homebrew, and excreting methane at a
fairly high rate, causing increased flatulence. If I recall the discussion
yeilded the cure of abstincence for a several week period to strarve the
creatures. 


The only other physiological indicators I know of are the oft quoted studies
that moderate consumption of 1-2 oz alcohol per day (your glass of wine, or
pint with dinner) can help reduce risk of heart disease. 


I have found that too many people use a number to define what is the difference
between acceptable drinking and overindulgence. This is total *BS*. If you use
the numbers AA tells you, the whole coountry of Germany is full of Alcoholics.
Basically these numbers ignore the manner in which one drinks, physiological
and psychological dependencies, lifestyle, manner in which you were raised, and
a host of real, important factors that effect your attitudes. Of course I'm
often told by these same people that these are smoke screen issues I cite to
conceal my drinking problem (ie end reasonable discussion).


A personal observation is that the friends I have who have grown up in
households where moderate drinking (for religious or social purposes) was done
(ie they gained exposure to responsible alcoholic consumption at an early age)
have *NEVER* had problems with alcohol. I have known others who grew up in
households with either relatives with drinking problems, or no exposure to
responsible enjoyment of alcoholic beverages. These people tended either not to
drink, or to drink to excess.


I consider the viewpoint of a large portion of the medical and rehabilitative
communities to be an intemperant load of garbage. I am partly of German
descent, and strongly favor the view they have of Beer (and other alcoholic
beverages) as part of the daily diet, not some abeerant evil thrust upon us.
Guess I'm just a radical though.

        Pour it out of the bottle and serve it in the jar.
Mason jars are not pressure vessels, and their lids probably
won't work either (this is good, as it would be a shame to 
start a tradition of ducking glass shrapnel in northern 
Alabama).

Subject: re Mason Jars


   I have one suggestion: DON'T!! Canning jars in general are not designed
to withstand any internal pressure. The type that uses a 2-piece lid (one
flat with rubber edge, and a ring to hold it in place---the only ones I've
seen recently were made by Ball) can take some external pressure (it's how
they seal), but I wouldn't assume that you can seal them tightly enough to
get the beer to carbonate---and if you did, you'd probably get an explosion
before carbonation. The type with a one-piece(plus-sealer-ring)lid (the lid
held on with a wire hinge/handle) \\might// take the pressure but I wouldn't
care to bet on it. Seeing as you're safely out of range, would you like to
try it? :-)
   The alcohol that comes in jars all over the rural south (at least by
tradition) is mostly corn whiskey at up to 150 proof, so it's not likely to
carbonate. Your neighbors (e.g., the Atlanta Worldcon bid committees) have
discovered a manufacturer of (you'll pardon the oxymoron) legal moonshine---
as a marketing gimmick it's sold in something like a jar (rather like the
bad sherry that was sold in a drawstring bag (=sack)).

The first time I used this yeast, the result was a *wonderful* amber ale.
The only new recipe variable was the yeast, so I sing it's praises.
I have not encountered the unusual activity mentioned in the other posting.


The second time the yeast never took off.  The packet still sits on my

Hello,


in HBD 621 Larry Barello asks about long term effects of drinking beer. There
was an article recently in _Glamour_ magazine about drinking beverages with
tannin in them (beer, wine, coffee, etc) and tooth decay. It seems that
researchers have discovered that tannin adheres to the teeth and inhibits the
bacteria that cause tooth decay. However, the article said that more research
was needed. This may not be what you were asking about, but it is health
related. Also in the magazine was a short take on that "love beer". No verdict
on its taste.


in HBD 620 Ken vanWyk asked about cooking with beer on Homebrew Digest. There
is a nice recipe for Cheddar Cheese soup that has beer as an ingredient in the
first cookbook by _The Frugal Gourmet_ (a PBS show). I don't have it, but it is
in print, and your local library might even have it. I used to have a nice
recipe for quick beer bread, but I never wrote it down. I think it was 3-2-1: 3
cups flour, 2 eggs, 1 bottle beer, but I can't remember for sure. I never saw a
recipe that specifically mentions homebrew, but no doubt using better beer will
make for better food.

Subject: immersion vs. counterflow


I hope I don't start a war here, but all this talk about cleaning
out the inside of copper tubing reaffirms that I made the right
choice in choosing to build an immersion chiller.  It helps me not
worry when I can see the condition of the surface that will be
touching my wort.  Also, it's much easier to clean the outside of
the tubing then the inside.  The water out of the tap here in
Palos Hills, IL is plenty cold year round and last week I got
the wort down from boiling to ~70F in about 20 minutes.  I probably
used about 10 gallons of water altogether.  I have a long translucent
white plastic (not vinyl - PVC would melt) hose on the output side
of the chiller which I use to fill the carboy and sanitation bucket
with ~180F water (the first couple of gallons) for sanitizing solution.


Just for the record (all from Ace Hardware):  50 feet of 3/8 inch O.D.
new copper tubing, 10 feet of 3/8 inch I.D. clear PVC tubing, 10 feet of
3/8 inch I.D. translucent white plastic tubing, three small hose clamps,
brass fittings to go attach the PVC to the faucet (slop sink, garden
hose-type fitting).  I used a compression fitting with a plastic ferrule
and a flanged brass reinforcing sleave (on the inside of the PVC hose end)
but a barbed hose fitting and another clamp would have probably been better.

  Cripes!  More than 3 bottles a week constitutes 'problem' drinking, now?
I wonder what ~8 beers/week means to the meds now, should my friends start
renting refrigerator cartons?  (No offense intended).

  I agree.  I have studied some psychology, and the more-or-less-current know-
ledge holds that individual differences in psychological drug tolerance are
primarily due to genetic factors and biochemistry.  Interesting, huh?


  Regardless, from my own personal non-empirical observation, it depends on
the individual.  I've known people who IMO are heavy alcohol drinkers (~12
beers/night on occasion, not as easy to monitor the booze drinkers) suffer no
short-term physical, psychological, or lifestyle effects other than the
occasional hangover.  Mind you, these folks maintain ~3.8 GPA, or decent jobs
and families.  Not a hint of dysfunctionality.  I've also known people who
down 2 beers, lose all inhibitions, and habitually black out.  Not a good
scene, these unfortunates seem to be predisposed to drug _abuse_, not use.

You should research the effect of heavy beer consumption for
people in East Europe.  Germany, Austria, Belgium, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, etc are countries that consume lots o' suds.


I just saw in an article detailing the problem Czechoslovakian
hop farmers are having with finding enough workers to string
up the hop vines now that they can't just get students that
the average per capita Czech beer consumption if 100 quarts/year.


That works out to a little less than a beer per day.
The only demonstratable effect is that one day you will wake
up and attempt to change the government! ;-)

How about some not quite anecdotal evidence:  I filled out a questionaire
for my wife's company's insurance about my health and habits.  I indicated
that I consumed 8 12 oz. beers in a week.  The computer printout that I
got returned indicated that this was considered "moderate" drinking.


As far as I can tell, the latest fad is to say that abstinance is best, but
then whisper that moderate drinking (about 1 ANSI drink/day, +/- 0.5) is
best.  Apparently there is a dip in the curve for heart attacks at this
point.  Above 3/day, the curve starts going way up.  Seems that a nip is
good for a stress reliever, but when you thoroughly abate the stress, it's
bad for the other organs.  ;-)

I usually consume between 8 and 10 pints a day, so I'd be glad to provide
you with a data point.

Um... I forget.  But I think I always abstain from sex while binging, 
usually.

Goodbye everyone.


Although I found the homebrew digest interesting, reading and participating for 
several months, I have not had time to read it in 3 months, and so am requesting that I be removed from the list, so that network bandwidth is not wasted.


I wish that the digest were a newsgroup, so that I could participate on
an occasional basis without having it appear in my mailbox every day.
I believe that the fears of flames (the usual reason given for not having
a newsgroup) are unjustified---none of the newsgroups I read have any flaming
on them.  I know that there are newsgroups with violent personal attacks, but
these newsgroups generally lack either a focus of discussion or rational
participants.  I believe that rec.homebrew could be as successful as the
current digest.


I anyone wants my mead recipe, send me e-mail.

I've read all sorts of different chlorine contact times.
One book says 30 mins, another 10, another just a dip
and a rinse. Anyone have the real scoop?  What is the minimum
contact time for chlorine solution..say 1 Tablespoon per gallon?
What about higher concentrations?

Subject: Mason Jars? NO!


Someone asked about bottling in Mason Jars. I would suspect that the
tops of the jars wouldn't be able to stand the pressure, and would
either leak, or buckle. I also wonder if the glass is strong enough.
Mason jars are designed to have a small negative pressure inside which
is achieved by capping when contents are near boiling, and the partial 
pressure of the water goes down when it is cooled, and some of the water
vapour condenses.


What do I know?

Papazian's book recommends a dilute bleach solution, and says never
use sulphites.  But my local homebrew store says sulphites are OK,
and that bleach is too hard to rinse.  I'll be bottling this weekend,
and am wondering what is the best stuff to use (I have both).  Any tips?

I'd like to know when it is OK to start bottling.  Papazian says
to take hydrometer readings, or bottle when fermentation seems
to be negligible.  But I've also heard to wait for 3-4 days after
there are no more bubbles.  Suggestions appreciated...

Some answers to some of John Mirely's questions:


The wide mouth glass jars with handles are old pickle jars.  If 
they're old enough and you soak them in a strong solution of clorox 
and water, they should be fine for making beer.  I used to use them as 
primary fermenters for my wine and ciders.  Chuck the cracked jar.  
You not only may lose a batch of beer but could severely injure 
yourself if it broke at an inopportune moment.  Besides, the crack 
could harbor bacteria.


I see no problem with reboiling wort that hasn't started fermenting.  
It may not be common practice but of such experiments the joys of 
homebrewing are made.
