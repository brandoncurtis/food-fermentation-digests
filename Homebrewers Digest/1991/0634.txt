Spaten is indeed a spade, and Spaten is also one of the bigger braueries in
the Munich region. The spade is the brewers spade, used to turn the grains in
the malting/mashing process. 


On a recent trip to Germany, I was suprised to see how many breweries have
the spade, fork and a hop cluster in their logo. Also of interest was the
brewer's star, which was a star of David. Anybody know what the background
on that is? How did the symbol of Judaism become associated with brewing?

Subject:      Re: Hunter Energy Monitor - The right one


Two friends and I just received Hunter energy monitors picked up for us by
a fellow IHD subscriber.  We have the model 42205, H.E.M.-AC, which is meant
for use with a room air conditioner and will handle a 115-V power source.
Presumably the 24-V model referred to in a recent HBD is the one that connects
to a home thermostatting system.
My new HEM plugs into the wall, then the fridge plugs into it.  It has a
thermocouple (thermistor?) plug at the end of a 4' cord, which goes inside the
fridge to measure temperature.  It is microprocessor based and can be pro-
grammed for a weeklong cycle with four temperature changes/day on weekdays
and two on weekends.  Temperatures are set digitally in a range from 40 - 90F.
The dead zone is 1 degree above to 2 degrees below setpoint and there is a
4 minute minimum delay between power-off and power-on to protect the fridge
compressor.  The H.E.M. is made by Hunter Fan Company, 2500 Frisco Avenue,
Memphis TN 38114.  Their customer service line is (901) 745-9222, M-F, central
time.  Enough?  No one has ever accused me of brevity.  Cheers - Jean

Subject: more questions about hops


All this talk about hops has me wondering a few things, and I'm curious if 
it would be productive to try to cultivate my own.


I live in N. Fla., very hot and humid, and a few freezing nights in the 
winter. I've got a fairly limited space of full sun with most of my 
property pretty well shaded. Can I cultivate hops in these conditions? If 
so, can someone list the address and numbers for Freshops or any other good 
sources for rhizomes?


Also, is it to late in the year to get them started? How soon can one 
expect to harvest after planting?


Thanks...

"Spaten" is indeed the German word for spade. I think it is simply the

        This is my regular summer brew (it's called "The Sun
Has Left Us On Time Steam Beer," btw, after a quote from
Thomas Edison). I have gotten good results with both Red Star
lager yeast and William's dry lager yeast.


        If you brew at the temperature mentioned, you are
*not* brewing a lager, you are brewing a steam beer. A
different animal, and quite enjoyable in its own right. I have
been able to improve the smoothness of this recipe by lagering
the secondary, and doing the primary ferment at room
temperatures, but as you point out, this requires a LARGE
fridge. Even doing both at room temperature makes a fine
beer.

        Yes, by weight. This makes TSHLUOTSB an easy recipe:
five pounds of dry malt extract and half a pound of crystal
malt. Try dry hopping with Cascades as the finishing hops.

        Don't mess with it. Soda kegs are cheap if you know
where to shop (you're local, so give me a call) and you don't
mind reconditioning a used keg. The rest of the hardware isn't
bad, and can be found used as well. Figure a hundred bucks to
get started with used stuff, twice that with new. Another
thirty bucks per keg additional (used).

        Well, I have more than one keg 8<:^) (anybody who's
been to my house can appreciate the humor). I store my beer in
five gallon kegs and refrigerate and serve from 2.5 and 3
gallon kegs (they fit the fridge better). I use a transfer
hose to move from one to the other. I only use bottles when I
need a "single serving" package for some reason (my annual
Christmas beer distribution, for instance).

I echo Jay Hersh's positive comments about the East-coast first round
judging.  Everything went well.  We spent one full weekend and one evening
unpacking and registering our ~400 entries.  We expected lots of broken
bottles, but received only one.  We had about 15 entries from wrong
categories sent to us by mistake - these were re-shipped to Boulder.  We
received about 20 bottles with imprinted or raised lettering - illegal
bottles! 


We ran 5 judging flights, held over 3 days.  Most flights had between 8 and
10 entries.  IMHO, most beers were excellent. 


Is there any news from the Boulder judging crew?

I agree.  I see this year's experiment as the first step to the tiered
competition system.  If the AHA sets up more first-round sites, and allows
each site to judge all categories, then we will have a regional "tiered system".

I use a 5 gallon cylindrical Coolman cooler.  It works fine - I use it as a

The Spaten Brewery is in Munich and makes many styles of beer.  Spaten
means shovel/spade in German, and they use a spade as their logo.  BTW,
they used to call their Dobblebock "Doppelspaten" and put two shovels on
the bottle.

Subject: first batch of ale




After brewing three batches of lager I've brewed my first ale. I used the
expeditous ale recipe from tcjohb. It sure is expeditous. I've been getting
14 or so day fermentations with the lagers. This batch went from an og of 48
to 18 since Monday evening. I used both yeast packs from the Old Ale kits
and I would guess that this contributed to the quick ferment. I figured if I
racked it into the secondary fermenter Thursday morning I wouldn't have
any blow off through the fermentation lock. I did it to quick on my last
batch and wound up putting the boil off tube back in. Anyway, the fermentation 
slowed to one glug in 50 seconds and the specific gravety was down to 18
when I racked it. Did I wait to long? Is this rate to slow to drive off
the air in the carboy? Is this quick ferment typical of ales or just
this recipe? I would be inclined to use a single stage fermentation if
this is typical. Would pitching just one packet of yeast help? Should I
bottle this now or is there enough CO2 to drive out the oxygen and keep it from
going bad.


John Mireley


P.S. I would like to brew a Southern Brown Ale for my next batch.
Can someone recommend a good extract recipe?

I'm a bit confused now, what is the "proper" way to use Cara-Pils?
If steeped before mashing, I would expect the extracted dextrins
to be broken down into fermentables during mashing.  After mashing
and sparging, everything is too hot.  Should Cara-Pils be steeped
separately, and then this dextrin soup added to the kettle after
sparging and boiled with the full-volume wort?

Subject: Last word on Hunter


I finally got my Hunter Air Stat and it works great.  For those of you who
will be getting beer fridges or just thinking about getting beer fridges
pay close attention.  Hunter is a ceiling fan company that also makes 
thermostats.  The Hunter Energy Monitor is too loose a term, because it
applies to almost all of their stats (including the regular house heater/AC
stat which I unknowingly bought the first time).  What the brew wants is
the Hunter Air Stat, an air conditioner thermostat that plugs into the wall.
You plug your fridge into the Air Stat, put the remote temperature sensor in
the fridge, set the stat, and away you go.  This model goes down to 40 F,
which is plenty low.  If you want to get cooler, just put the stat on manual
and control the temperature with your regular fridge stat.  The energy monitor
feature allows one to read how long the unit has operated on the current day,
the previous day, and a running total. For those of you who don't know where
to buy one, look in your phone book, or call Hunter at 901-745-9222.  A
warning about calling them:  no one ever answers the phone.  It may take you
several tries to get through.  Cost retails around $40 (I think).


Bay Area: buy yours at Home Depot, because they're on sale for $19.95.  Look
in the air conditioning dept.


Midwest: check Builder's Square for the ~$20 price.


To make sure you are buying/have bought the right one, the model # is 42205.


good luck

This is decidedly non-trivial.  As a beginner, I wouldn't even try - just
ferment it and decide how you like the result before getting fancy.  The key is
how attenuative your yeast is (are you using the natural yeast in the
fresh-pressed juice or are you pasteurizing and adding yeast?  If so, what
kind?).  What is your original SG?  You can add sugar (actually I'd recommend
honey, but then, I'm a mead-head) to a level where there will still be some
sweetness after the yeast dies off.  On the other hand, you can add Everclear or
vodka to kill the yeast before the fermentation is done.  Anything you do to try
to control it is going to be tricky.


I've fermented out and bottled cider.  My opinion is that just pouring the
juice in a sanitized carboy and adding an airlock works as well as the more
sophisticated techiniques of paseurizing and adding yeast that I've tried.


My preferred way of having hard cider is to just leave the jug open at room
temperature for 2-4 days and then serve.  You get a little bit of fermentaion
and the result is short on alcohol but long on taste.  Of course, you can't
bottle it and serve it next July this way but I think this way has the best
taste.

Reading this makes me wonder if you live in the same United States that I do.
The federal government not requiring taxes on the sale of alcohol?????  I
*strongly* recommend that you ask the nearest office of the US Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the state Liquor Control Board and get
permission in writing before trying this.


This is purely speculation and not based on fact or even rumor, but my guess is
that the Feds are tolerant if the roadside stand's cider ferments slightly and
contains traces of alcohol when it is sold since it is very difficult to
prevent this from happening.  I suspect that they take a very different opinion
of someone deliberately fermenting cider and selling it without paying tithes
to Uncle.  don't expect to spend a weekend in jail if you're caught; think in
terms of years and $K.

The answer is a very definite maybe.  Some lager yeasts take longer than
others.  I haven't tried steam beer with that yeast.  Racking may or may not be
necessary depending on how long the fermentation goes.  Try it and find out.

I got the 33 qt enamel-on-steel pot from Great Fermentations in San
Raphael.  It is inded the pot from General Housewares.  GF shipped
it to me in the original GH box!  There appears to be no savings
in ordering from GH, so give some profit to GF.  Also as much as
I wanted a stainless steel pot, all SS pots that I could find are
tall units with small bases.  They will not straddle two burners
as the c-o-s pot will.  This makes a big difference to me.  I'm
tired of waiting for my 7 gal. wort to boil!

Subject: Grain Brewing, Cleaning Equipment, Kegs, etc.


Why does everyone act like grain brewing is hard and that beginners shouldn't
attempt it?  Although I did extract brews for years (with mediocre results)
and my anxiety levels were very high for the first grain batch, the results
were good and the process was pretty easy and forgiving.  Stick to simple,
single infusion mashes (ala miller or Papazian), get a sparge bag, wrap your
mash/sparge bucket with a towel or two and most of all "Relax, have a
homebrew". The equipment requirements for a good mash are really pretty low
tech.  I just added a barrel tap to my old plastic fermenter and voila:
mash & sparge bucket!


The proof is that a friend of mine did his first three batches ever as all
grain and had very nice brown ales to show for it.


- ---- Cleaning Equipment


Try plain old Washing Soda (in a blue box at your supermarket) It is just
Sodium Carbonate (main ingredient in your dishwasher detergent).  A chemist
friend of a friend claims Soda doesn't etch your glass ware (the phosphorous
in detergent is the culprit) and rinses out very easily.  Also, the stuff
strips off beer labels and the gum very quickly.  This doesn't sanitize and
shouldn't be mixed with bleach.  Etched glassware is a haven for bugs and
harder to clean/sterilize.


- ----- Kegs


I got used Firestones for $30/ea.  I spent around $220 for CO2 bottle,
regulator, hoses, kegs, taps for three kegs.  It was a lot of money, but
the kegs are pretty convenient.  I also bottle (from the keg) when I want
to give someone my beer or take some on a picinic.  Unless you can find a
supply of used kegs real cheap you probably won't get setup this cheap.
The place that set me up (Brewers Warehouse, Seattle) doesn't carry used
kegs anymore...  The only problem I have with kegs is that I am limited
to how many beers I can have on tap - this gets even worse now that I am
playing around with lagers and a keg is tied up for a month or so before
I can start drinking!


Anyone have a pointer to a supply of cheap used pin lock kegs?

Two questions:
 
1)  My third and fourth batches seem to have a high ending gravity.  I
didnt do anything different from the previous two--but the third one
started at 1046 and ended `at`1024 when I bottled.  I just racked my
fourth batch to a  
I used a M&F premium kit in the first one and a John Bull Stout kit in
the second case.  I did not do anything different from the first two
batches, and they came out at <1010.  Whats the deal?  My ferments are 
quick because of the temp in my apt, about 76 deg.  Will the beer 
taste bad, or be unfermented?


2)  Any pointers tobrew pubs in London and Luxembourg City?  Either in 
the HBD archives, or by personal email?  I'll be in both cities in 
July and early August.


3)  I lied about two questions, it was to get you to read this.  Can 
someone describe the proper way to create a "starter".  Mine failed to 
"glug" when I did it a day in advance.  I used a cup of spray malt and 
a half gallon of H20, then put the yeats in at 80 deg.  I know, it was 
hot, but I was impatient.


Thanks for any and all responses.

In HOMEBREW Digest #633, David Poore asked:


> First, what are the prospects of shipping (relatively) large quantities of 
> beer from France to US? Possible? Costly? What carriers?


I can't answer this one.  I started looking into the question
several years ago, and at the time, the complexities involved with
the shipping plus the BATF and ABC red tape made me finally give it
up.  Unless you're willing to be an honest-to-goodness importer, it
just doesn't seem to be worth it.  I hope someone else has a better
answer than that ...

Where's she going?  Many Belgian beers are available in Paris,
including many lambics.  My brother-in-law lives next to a tiny,
completely unremarkable neighborhood store in the 20th 
Arrondissement, and it carries such delicacies as Leffe
Trappiste, Mort Subite kriek & gueuze, and Jenlain biere de garde. 
A couple blocks away is an ordinary liquor store that has Orval, the
three major Chimays, St. Sixtus, Timmerman's gueuze, kriek, and
framboise, and many others.  In short, if she's going to Paris, she
should have no trouble at all finding things you'll like.  To the
best of my knowledge there's no practical limit on the quantity she
could bring back in her baggage, but excess baggage charges make it
not practical politics to bring more than a case or so, and she'll
be charged duty on anything over 2 liters.


The question of culturing from the bottle is a real "gotcha", for
exactly the reason you've stated.  There's an additional problem
with lambics:  due to the the complex nature of the fermentation,
only some of the organisms lying in that heap of rubbish at the
bottom of the bottle are likely to be viable, and of those that are,
some reproduce very slowly.  So, if you manage to culture something
from a gueuze bottle and use it to make beer, that beer probably
won't taste much like gueuze.


On an entirely different subject:  I wholeheartedly throw my support
behind the Miller book (The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing).  I
agree with Darryl's reservations concerning the title, but it's
always the first place I look when I'm considering brewing a new (to
me) style of beer.  I personally believe it belongs in every
homebrewer's library.

Two-handled cappers are traps for the unwary.  Frankly, I can't
imagine why retailers sell them.  Actually I can, but just wish I
couldn't.  I had exactly the same problems, and sent many a
perfectly usable bottle off to be recycled, before my wife found a
bench capper at a yard sale for $3.  For a few batches I bravely
tried to go on using that two-handled glass smasher on those bottles
it seemed suited to, but I finally gave up on it and just keep it in
case of the (unlikely) failure of my bench capper.  Do yourself a
favor, Matt, and start setting a little money aside each month for a
good capper.  They're lots cheaper than Cornelius kegs.

I have a 5 gal. Gott water cooler for a mash tun.  For a false bottom I
put in some type m copper set set in an "H"  like pattern with lots of
holes drilled in the copper.  The copper runs out the bottom of the cooler
where the drain was and is epoxied where it runs through to prevent
leekage.  I put a faucet at the end of the copper to controll the flow of
the wort.


From the top the copper looks like this:




                           _       _
                          | |     | |

                             valve




I soldered the thing up using lead free solder.  It works well I can hold
the mash tempature two with in a few degrees for the entire mash.  The
only week point is where the copper passes through the cooler and is
sealed with epoxy.  The epoxy does not maintain a good seal with the
plastic.  Any ideas for improving the designe would be helpfull.

Subject: Fresh beer?


Something I have been wondering about: Several new small breweries
around here date stamp their beer, and go to great lengths to explain that
they do all sorts of things to make sure you get "Fresh beer"??
Why? The last thing I want is fresh beer? I go out of my way to hide 
freshly brewed beer where I won't be tempted to drink it until it has
aged. I consider a few months to be minimum, six months better, so what 
is it with the "fresh beer"?? 
 Of course this is mainly for cool/cold fermented beers. When I throw a
bitter into the keg, I figure I deserve a glass right away for washing 
such a big container;-) It's amazing that in five minutes, there is enough
gas produced to ooze that first glass out of the keg. But IMHO, even
warm flat ales taste better after aging.

One point to remember is that honey takes a long time to ferment.  I
recently bottled a Mild Ale that contained 4 pounds of amber DME and
a bit less than a pound of honey, and used Wyeast ale yeast.  Normally,
I would expect this to be done fermenting in about a week at 65 F.  With
the honey, it took 3-4 weeks!  And for a good portion of that time, the
fermentation lock was going at 5-6 glubs/minute (constant).  By the way,
this stuff turned out great - it will make a wonderful summer beer.
When it got down to the area of 1 glub/min, I bottled with my normal
prime - 3/4 cup corn sugar.  This stuff is *carbonated*, as the honey
wasn't completely fermented out - but I like it that way for a light
summer beer.

I use a turkey baster to start the siphon.  It works reasonably well.  The
area that causes difficulty is where the soft plastic tubing fits over the
hard plastic racking tube.  This increase in diameter plus the occasionaly
air leak at this point sometimes breaks the flow.

Bottles I have just received from elsewhere (a liquor store, etc) are some
of the grossest things I've ever laid eyes on.  I'd say over 50% have large,
nasty mold colonies growing in the bottom.  I've found cigarrette butts and
even *live* bugs in the bottles.  So, my routine for these "new" bottles
is (1) fill about 2 inches with *strong* (1 oz. per gallon or more) bleach
solution.  Soak overnight - this should loosen the mold colonies.  Then, I
put them in the laundry tub and soak them inside *and out* in another 
bleach solution of 2 oz per 5 gallons.  Rinse thoroughly.


Now, I don't go nearly this far once I've used the bottles.  I rinse them
well right after drinking from them.  Before using again, I soak the
insides only in a weak bleach solution and then rinse thoroughly.
