Not really.  The Copyright law grants exclusive rights to a work to the owner
of the Copyright.  The owner may then relinquish those rights as they so
desire.  Allowing short excerpts from a work to be printed as part of a review
is an example of this.  Educational use is sometimes permitted, but not always.
The Copyright notice in the book sometimes lists the exemptions that have been
granted, or you can contact the publisher for more information.


One aspect of the law that I`m not clear on is how long the Copyright remains
in effect after the death of the holder.  I think it`s 50 years, but I`m not
certain of this (I am certain that it`s not 0).


Conclusion: it`s probably illegal to send recipes from Dave Line`s book (or any
homebrewing book, for that matter) to the Homebrew Digest.  In practice it
seems unlikely that any legal action would be taken against you (or your
employer if you sent it using a computer at work, or Rob Gardner, or Rob`s
employer, all for permitting the violation) but that doesn`t make it legal.

Subject: weekend spree


Well, I cleaned up this weekend. I picked up a Lindemann's Frambroise
Lambic, an Orval Trappist Ale, an Aass Pilsner from Norway I think, and
a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Porter, and Stout.  I also had some Long Trail
Ale (made in Vermont):  supposed to be a pale ale, but it was amber, and
had an "over-bitter" character to it, as if it had too much pellet hops
(I know the flavor well...).  Nice malt aroma, but the malt flavor got
lost in the bitter, and it had little hops aroma.  An ok ale, but .....
I also had another VT made ale on tap, but can't remember its name. It
was made in Bridgeport (?).  It was also a pale ale. It *was* pale, a
little cloudy, and light.  Little maltiness, little hopiness. A nice
yuppie beer. Actually it would be nice on a hot summer day.  It seemed
"cleaner" than the Long Trail, but maybe that's 'cuz it was on tap (at
3 Dollar Dewey's in Burlington, VT. Great place, about 15 different
beers on tap, from local VT brews to Spaten Bock!).


I also picked up 2 food grade 4.5 gallon containers.  The plan is to turn
them into a Zapap later tun.  If anyone has done this and has some
suggestions or things to avoid, I'd appreciate the info.


Now, Belgium (Flemish?) beer:  What should I expect from the Lambic and
the Orval.  I've never had either before.  The Orval is dated Feb 1990.
Is that too old to culture the yeast?  What temperature should the
Lambic be served at?


Any info on the Aass pilsner?


All in all, a succesful (and expensive) weekend.

These 2 litre (and 1 litre and even half-litre) PET bottles are also
used in another strange, foreign land:  Canada.  Many micro-brewers
have chosen to use them.  Also, you can buy them in homebrew stores,
where screw-on caps can also be purchased.  There are two types:
the re-usable ones seems more attractive on cost considerations,
but they don't work as reliably as the one-time jobs that have a ring
around the bottom which breaks when the bottle is breached.




On an entirely different note, I finally found a job.  I'll be working
at Adelphi University in Nassau County, Long Island, come September.
Another lonely posting for "un Canadien Errant".  Does anyone have
information on local clubs, homebrew stores and brew pubs (I stress
the "local" in the last point, as Manhattan brewpubs have recently 
been discussed...Adelphi is in Garden City and I'm told that nearby
Hempstead is a nice town).

As I understand it:


Scotch: Malted Barley (Blends may use some others)
American/Canadian Whiskey (Seagrams, CC, Crown Royal): Rye
Bourbon (Only in Kentucky): Corn Mash
Sour Mash (Jack Daniels): Corn Mash


As for rye being malted in the US, I beleive that the House of Seagram 
is the largest single consumer of rye in North America.  I doubt that
they buy malted rye though, they probably do it themselves.

Actually, HBUs are not the same as AAUs.  HBUs are not as useful a unit,
because they aren't volume neutral.  (For thos who don't understand
what I'm getting at:  1 AAU = 1 oz. 1% alpha acid hops/1 gallon.
1 HBU = 1 oz. 1% alpha acid hops.  Therefore, any information that
quotes an HBU level must also specify the batch size, or else it's
useless.  That's not true for AAUs.)  Papazian "simplified" AAUs
because "everyone" makes 5 gallon batches.


I like Dave Line's Big Book of Brewing a lot and still refer to it.
It has got its drawbacks:  for USians, the English volume units
can cause trouble;  he specifies saccharin for several recipes because
his equipment did not allow him the temperature control he needed to
get a good, high dextrin mash, and once again for us, he calls for
a lot of sugars that I have not seen in the local Safeway.  But especially
considering just how long ago the book was written, it is a milestone
work.  And it is a good reference when investigating English styles.  His
bedtime story for enzymes is still not surpassed ;-).

Subject: whiskey ingredients and beer stuff




When I said rye is used in American whisky, I should have said "some
American whisky is made with rye."  Like, maybe, "rye whisky".


Here's a brewing note: I've been using the technique suggested a few 
digests back of rinsing chlorine residues with cheap beer.  I'm very
satisfied with the results, which are mostly that I worry less (i.e.,
I'm not sure I've tasted any difference in the beer).  At about $3.69
a twelve-pack, Blatz is the best deal around here.  (As an aside, I
was struck by the pronounced yeastiness of this stuff.  I didn't try
any, just smelled it.)


Another brewing note:  I got a notably higher extraction rate from a 
mash this weekend.  I was thinking about life and mashing and stuff while
I was in the recirculation phase (lauter tun->stovetop->lauter tun)
when I decided that recirculation of some sparge water might be a good
idea.  I figured that the whole point was to extract as much soluble
sugar as possible.  Since a single pass through the grain bed is unlikely
to fully exploit the solvent capabilities of the water, I figured I can
give it a better chance by draining off some wort, adding some sparge
water (maybe a gallon), then recirculating for a few minutes.  I realized
that I might be risking greater extraction of husk polyphenols, but I
decided it was worth a try; besides, my sparge water was acidified to
about pH 5.5.  The result was an extract rate of about 31 for my mix
of 7 lbs. 2-row, 1 lb. wheat, and 1 lb. mmedium crystal.  We'll see how
it turns out. . .


Finally: anybody who's thought of building a RIMS for mashing, but has
been daunted by the complexity, I'd like to share ideas.  Complete lack
of understanding of thermodynamics, mechanical engineering, and fluid
dynamics hasn't stopped me from planning various simplifications to the
original plans (which came from Zymurgy? Somebody faxed them to me...)
Anyhow, drop me a line if you want to share ideas.

Here here, I second that recommendation. These things are very convenient, and
are available in a few varieties, which will probably increase as they catch on.


I toss one or two into hop boiling bags. They seem to break up nicely in hot
wort, but I suggest you break them up if you're dry hopping with them.

Sorry to beat an almost dead horse, but I've been off the net for a while.


To Florian & Kinney:


Before I gave up all hope and became a computer weenie I was a pre-vet
student at Michigan State.  Other posters to the Digest have stated that you
really don't have to worry about pestisides and the like in the grains you buy
from feed stores.  This is true as long as it is intended to feed animals that
are to be used for human consumption.  Lots of nasty things are allowed if
the animals will never be served up.


What you do have to worry about is enzymes and hormones.


Both of these are often added to feed grain to increase/improve milk & meat
production.  Fortunently nothing in life (or feed stores) is free.  Thus you
have to pay extra for these wonderful chemical additives.  Ask the people
running the feed store if either of these are in what your buying.  If they
ain't there you should be OK.


Oh, another thing often added to food for rumenants (cows, horses, ect.) is
nitrogen.  It helps the bacteria that live in their stomachs (the bacteria are
what actually digests the food).  The nitrogen is often added in the form of
urea (yes this means that they spray the grain with urine).


So buy your grain at feed stores and don't worry, just ask.

Hi there!


I've been out of touch for quite a while, due to an extended illness, and have
just finished reading a s--tload of back homebrew digests.  So, please pardon
my commenting on a  "dated" thread. 


A number of people were asking about mead a while back; I wasn't able to retain
the various questions.  So:  my "quick 'n' dirty, 3-week mead" recipe is
available to those who would care to request it.  Any other questions may also
be addressed to me directly, rather than taking up bandwidth here.


Other than that, in dig 629 Douglas Allen Luce <dl2p+`at`andrew.cmu.edu> said:

First of all, sorry you had any trouble with this recipe.  But remember:  it
*is* meant to be a "quickie" recipe, with fermentation halted by artificial
means (addition of grain alcohol or vodka).


Second, it is *meant* to produce a sweet (as opposed to a dry) mead, and if I
remember correctly so states. 


As to the off-flavor you're experiencing:  presuming from the phrasing in your
posting that you allowed fermentation to proceed until it ceased by itself,
then you've probably got a mead that will need to age 2 years before it's
drinkable.  One to two years are very typical mead aging times.  Such is the
case, for example, with the pyment I did last summer. 


If that isn't the problem, then I would assume that the stainless steel pot is
the culprit.  I do *all* my brewing-type boiling *only* in enamel.  As Papazian
and others point out (if I remember correctly), metal can chemically interact
with a boiling wort, with undesirable results.


Again, sorry you had trouble.  Hope this helps.




                         *Really* glad to be back,


                                      Cher

Subject: sterile filtration, AHA Nats


  It is possible to sterilize air by filtration, just as beer is commonly
sterilized by filtration in many commercial breweries.
  I played with some Cole Parmer L-02915-34 50mm nylon filters ($27.50 for
ten, 800 323 4340, credit cards welcome). These have a 0.2 micron pore size
which will block darn near everything that is likely to cause infection. They
come in sterile packages, have hose barbs on both ends and pass air very freely
when driven with something like an aquarium pump.
  I was not interested in reducing lag time but instead wanted to "turbocharge"
yeast starters involving small dabs of yeast from slants. I hoped that by
forcing a prolonged aeration period I could keep the yeast in a respiration
phase longer and get more buildup of cells. After what looked like good 
results (which I ranted about privately), I set up an experiment, running
sterile air into starters with two original gravity values while also
running two starters without more than the usual "shake it up" aeration at the
start, with matching gravities. There was no significant difference in
apparent speed of onset of turbidity, sedimentation rate or amount, 
clarification speed, etc. In other words it was a great deal of trouble for
nothing.
  This was just one data point and probably says nothing about potential use for
shortening lag in a larger volume of wort; I just wasn't interested in this
application.
  ---
  I got my judging sheets back from the pale ale and dry stout I sent off to
Boston for the Nats. These were two just-OK beers and the judging forms went a 
long way toward showing me all that was wrong with them. I take issue with a 
few comments (of course) but overall think the judging was *VASTLY* improved 
over last year and for these two beers was a great help to me for understanding
some brewing mistakes. It was a real treat to open bottles of the beers in
question and sip them, reading the forms and saying to myself "Yes, yes!, yes,
maybe, yes, yes!", instead of "Say what? Which planet did these guys fly in 
from?" :-)
