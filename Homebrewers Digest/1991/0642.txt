Someone in HB#639 mentioned a blueberry mead.  I happen to be a
blueberry fiend.  Any chance of posting this recipe?  Thanks...

OK, OK, consider me suitably chastised for my lack of understanding about 
the vagaries of the archive. I am a VMS person. I am old. It's tough seeing 
that forest out there...too darn many trees in the way!  But I learned 
something in the process (albeit the hard way, as usual).

No. No. No.  We've had this discussion throughout the various cooking
newsgroups and Fidonet echos. Recipes ARE NOT COPYRIGHTABLE!!! A recipe is a
formula or process, neither of which can be copyrighted. A formula can be
patented ("Our patented fire-brewed process...") but is specifically excluded
from copyright since it is merely an idea.


A cookbook can be copyrighted under a compilation copyright which protects the
total collection of recipes as a book from being reproduced. But, you can take
out a recipe, retype is exactly as is, and put it in your own cookbook with
perfect legality. Now, reproducing the page exactly, with pictures and all,
probably is not legal, but here in the digest the format must have been retyped
and is never substantially the same as the original.


Do you think that Papazian or Miller or Line all have completely original
recipes in their books? Really!


You should have no qualms whatsoever in typing in your favorite recipe into the
digest.

Sorry I don't buy it. You're not going to get off flavors from Stainless Steel.
Stainless is not going to chemically interact with the boiling wort.
Almost every commerical brewer in this country uses Stainless (except those
that use Copper). I have Stainless Surgical Steel implanted in my body, 
Stainless Steel is pretty resistant to chemical reactions, particularly 
oxidations.


I will personally stake a large quantity of my Mead that the source of thise
poor persons (HBD  629 Douglas Allen Luce) off flavors is *NOT* Stainless 
Steel.


And no, I don't have any money invested in the Steel industry.
I just don't want to let you start propagating misinformation, the
Aluminum/Stainless debate is bad enough.

They used to have beer in that area, in the Sumerian Empire days about
four or so thousand years ago. Anchor recently put out a limited edition
of a beer made to a Sumerian recipe, which I hear didn't keep well due
to lack of hops. Since modern Iraq is an Islamic country, I doubt you'll
find any alcoholic beverages sold there legally. (I assume you were kidding)


On a related subject, an archaeologist recently found the oldest wine yet
discovered at a site in Iran, between ancient Sumeria and the Caucasian
mountains. She found pottery fragments from 3500 BC, and intact bottles
from 3000 BC, which still contained traces of wine. Her colleagues were
skeptical at first--they didn't think man knew how to make wine until
many centuries later, and were sure that her samples were just paint.
Now they are all rushing back to test their own collections of pot shards :-)


This wine was definitely "mature" after aging for fifty centuries, but
unfortunately it had dried out and was not drinkable. Does anyone know
the record for the oldest wine that's still sloshing around in the bottle
and theoretically drinkable? Last I heard, it was >2000 year old wine
found in intact amphorae by Jaques Cousteau at the bottom of the Agean.
He actually took a swig from one of the bottles and said it was pretty good.


I didn't catch the archaeologist's name, but she says her next project
is to discover the oldest beer.

Subject: Is pale ale pale


Yes I know I made a mistake.  I described Long Trail pale ale as
not being pale, but as being amber.  Well I know that pale ale *is* usually
amber.  But the Long Trail ale had this orange/reddish glow sort of color;
it struck me as a strange color.  Maybe it only looked strange because
of the lighting in the house, or in comparison to the other pale ales
I was having, or because I just plain had too many pale ales.


When does a pale ale become a brown ale?

yow!


Vermont brews on tap at Dewey's in Brattleboro are:
 Long Trail                                from Bridgewater
 Otter Creek                                from Middlebury
 Catamount Golden, Amber, Porter        from White River Junction
 Dewey's own        (or at least they *said* it would be ready by now)
                                        from Brattleboro


The (cloudy pale) ale you describe sounds like Otter Creek.
As far as I know, there is one other brewery in Vt., the Burlington
pub and brewery, and one brewpub-in-the-making just around the corner
from Dewey's at the Latchis Hotel in Brattleboro.

Try Ahmed's Ale House on Al Shiekh Ave.
The SCUD Steam Beer will knock your socks off, and 
Camel Dung Brown Ale is the proverbial nectar of Allah.

They have a very aggressive Western Imperial Stout, but the

Subject: HEPA Filter Wanted




In the last several weeks, I've had the priviledge of using
a tissue culture facility to propogate yeast.  There is 
nothing quite like using an industrial autoclave, a 
laminar flow hood, and a temperature controlled shaker!
Needless to say, the resulting cultures are fabulous.
Six hours after pitching a pale ale (with SN yeast, of
course) one quart of blow-off had already accumulated!


Now that I'm addicted, I'd like to get a HEPA (High
Efficiency Particulate Air) filter with which to build
a small laminar flow hood.  Does anybody know a source
for these?  I've found *one* that will sell me a 12"x24"
filter for around $110.  Hopefully they are cheaper 
somewhere else???

As I haven't seen a reply posted yet, and happen to have the information with
me:


The 1991 CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale) Great British Beer Festival will be
from 13th to 17th August at the London Arena in London's Docklands.  This
is a MASSIVE venue and is convenient to reach from Central London.


Promised are over 300 cask ales, bottle conditioned beers, foreign beers and 
lagers, cider and perry, pub games, live entertainment and family room.
Opening times are Tuesday 5-10.30pm, Wed-Fri 11.30am-3pm, Sat 11am-10.30pm.
Unlike the Great (sic) American Beer Festival, you pay for the beer, but you
can drink it in larger than thimble-size quantities.


Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it there myself, owing to my current
self-enforced exile.

Subject: styrene flavor in HB


Greetings.


Don't have all the editing capabilities of this system figured out yet, so
forgive my paraphrasing rather than direct quotes.


In digest #641 Cheryl Feinstein commented on a posting from digest #629,
in which Douglas Luce described making a small batch of mead with ginger,
tea, orange peel and honey.  The resulting brew tasted strongly of styrene.


Feinstein suggested that perhaps the use of a stainless steel brew kettle
was to blame.  (Again, forgive the lack of direct quotes.)


#641 was the first HBD I have received, and I hope that this thread hasn't
been beaten into the ground, but I had a similar batch of beer last year.
It was supposed to be a Christmas Ale, based on light malt extract (Munton
and Fison) with some dark specialty malts to add character, and spiced with
1 pound of honey, fresh ginger, and orange peel.  I used an enamel brew 
kettle, primary fermentation in glass, secondary fermentation in glass, and
temperature control was good.  However, the beer tasted *very* strongly of
styrene.  The flavor was sharp initially, and after some months was more 
subdued, but still made the batch undrinkable.


My techniques and ingredients were the same I've used in other batches, and
produced at least drinkable brew, if not outstanding examples.  After reading
the ingredients for Douglas Luce's mead, and the similarity of the off-flavor
(I mean it tastes like polystyrene smells) I wonder if using honey, ginger,
or orange peel can produce this flavor.


Have other homebrewers encountered this particular phenomenon?  I'm 
somewhat reluctant to attempt another "specialty beer" until I have some
idea why the last one failed.  If this topic has already been covered, could
someone please e-mail me the consensus?


Thanks,
