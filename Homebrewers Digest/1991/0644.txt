I used to Homebrew when I was in the SF Bay Area... Now that I am back in
France, I would like to continue this practice. However, I have no idea if
anybody does that here (they are more in the wine businees around here) and if
yes, I am looking for place (mail order or shop) to order the ingredients.


(a place in Belgium or Switzerland would be OK)


Thanks in advance,

Here are two Xmas extract Recipes from "our" Recipe file, I have not tried
either of these, but my next batch will be the first one (I have all the
ingredients but I need time to make it).  Hope you like them.

Subject: Xmas Beer Recipe


I just tried one of my ginger beers brewed following CP's recipe in TCJHB.
Although only in the bottle a week, it was really tasty.  It will make a
nice spicy beer by Xmas.  Here's the recipe,


        3.3 lbs Northwestern light ME
        2 lbs DME
        2 lbs wildflower honey
        2 oz Hertsburger (Spelling?) boiling
        1/2 oz Goldings finishing
        2 oz fresh grated ginger boiling
        1 oz fresh grated ginger finishing
        2 paks M + F ale yeast started


Start yeast in about 90F watered down wort.  Boil malt extract, honey,
hops, and ginger about 1 hr.  Strain, then add finishing hops and ginger.
Cool  rapidly in tub, pitch yeast already started.  SG=49, FG=14 after 2
weeks.  Prime and bottle.  This is a quite light beer with a nice ginger
aroma and flavor.

Ingredients for 5 gallons


3 1/2 pounds Munton and Fison Stout Kit
3 1/2 pounds Munton and Fison amber dry malt extract
3     pounds Munton and Fison amber dry malt extract }  ?? Typo ??
1/2   ounce Hallertauer hops (60 minutes)
1/2   ounce Hallertauer hops (5 minutes)
3/4   pound honey
5     3-inch cinnamon sticks
2     teaspoons allspice
1     teaspoon cloves
6     ounces ginger root
6     rinds from medium size oranges
      Wyeast No. 1007 German ale liquid yeast
7     ounces corn sugar for priming


*O.G.:  1.069
*T.G.:  1.030
*Primary fermentation: 14 days `at` 61 degrees F.
*Age when judged: six months


BREWER'S SPECIFICS
     Simmer spices and honey (45 minutes). Boil malt and hops (50 minutes).
Add finishing hops and boil (5 minutes). Cool, strain and pitch yeast.


MY COMMENTS:
The second call for 3 pounds of M & F amber dry malt extract is probably a
typo in the magazine.  7 pounds of extract and 3/4 pound of honey would
give you an O.G. of around 1.069.  10 pounds of extract would give you an
O.G. much higher than that.

Well, my in-laws have gone to Europe, but they couldn't find the
beers I requested, so they're bringing me some Jaegermeister.  I've
heard various rumors regarding the ingredients of this; could someone
shed some light on the subject?  (I know it's not beer, but this is the
only list I know of that may know something of it...)




For my first homebrewing attempt I was thinking of doing a bock.  Does
anyone have a recipe that's similar to Aass Bock?  Or would I be better
off brewing another, easier style for my first?


Thanks in advance!

Hello,
in HBD abirenbo asks about making hard cider. I haven't done it, but a friend
of mine buys that unpasteurized cider in the soft plastic bottles, drops a
pinch or two of champagne yeast in it, lets it sit a few days (covered with
towels in case it explodes), and then puts it in the fridge. Nice sparkling
cider. We also had some cider "turn" on us. Just don't drink it all, let it sit
a few weeks, and you'll probably get hard cider. No guarantees of quality (:

Subject: Be Prepared


Be advised that if you don't start your liquid yeast packet well in
advance of your brewing session, and you leave your wort in your
fermenter without yeast in it for two days, mold _will_ grow on your
beer, and you'll have to throw it out.


That is all.

Are they giving tours of the Guinness Brewery again?  When I was there
(July 1987?  I'll have to check my passport) they let me into the gift
shop, but not the brewery and not the tasting room.  They must have
heard I was coming...   :-)

I know the owner of the BTC.  I have spoken with him on the topic of
the AHA conference and he assures me that there will be a good
selection of beer on hand during conference week.  The problem he has
had in the past in keeping "good" beers stocked is that his
distributor charges him "import" scales for such locally brewed beers
as Sam Adams, Harpoon, Catamount, Frank Jones, etc.


The distributors apparently have two different pricing structures; one
for domestic, and one for imports.  The only beers on the "domestic"
structures are the products of the Big Three (Coors, A-B, and Miller)


He doesn't like getting ripped off, and practically the only people
who drink "Good Stuff" (He DOES keep some Harpoon around and
occasionally some Sam Adams, but you have to ASK for it) are myself
and the rest of the Monday night dart crowd.


As for the bar changing around... It only appears to be smaller.  They
pulled it away from the wall and arranged it in a square in the middle
of the room.  The bar still has the same frontage, it just uses the
floor space more efficiently now.  This has allowed them to put in
more tables.  They also recently (2 weeks ago) opened up an outdoor
patio area.  Also, this week they FINALLY got a new pinball table in.


BTW, you can find me at the BTC on Monday nights throwing darts (or
playing the silver ball between rounds of darts.)  John, the owner,
sometimes joins in.  Once in a while he'll play us for a round of
beers on the house, and he's not a very good dart player.  But, he is
a good sport.

From: zentner`at`ecn.purdue.edu (Michael Zentner)
Subject: Bock Recipe




Due to the stated lack of dark lager recipes in the excellent brew
recipe compilation, I'm going to contribute a bock recipe that turned
out very good.


BEAT ME OVER THE HEAD WITH A STICK BOCK


Ingredients:
   6.6 lb John Bull light malt extract
   3 lb Klages malt
   1/2 lb chocolate malt
   2.75 oz of 4.7% AAU willamette flowers (60 minute boil)
   0.5 oz  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (2 minute steep)
   pick your favourite lager yeast (I used something from MeV)
   10 g Burton Salts (for the partial mash (I've got soft water))


Method: partial mash----NOTE for those of you who generally skip
        a recipe without reading it when you find the word "mash"
        anywhere in the text...read on.  The title of this brew 
        comes from a friend of mine who would never try something,
        and when he did, his only thought was, "Why didn't you guys
        beat me over the head with a stick when I was so afraid of
        this...this is great!"  I used to skip those recipes too, but
        it's real easy to do, and the taste is worth it.


OG: 1.072   FG: 1.021   (7%)


Procedure:  I ended up with a lot of volume for the amount of grain used, 
   but that's OK if you're just doing partial mashes.


   Bring 3 qt + 2 cups of water to 130 F.
   Add cracked Klages and chocolate malts (temp = 122F)
   Rest 30 min
   Add 7 cups of 200F water to bring temp up to 150F
   Rest 30 min.
   bring up to 158F with burner
   rest 20 minutes
   mash out at 170F


   Sparge with 7 quarts of 170F water, recycling the first runoff.
      I did this step very slowly since the filter bed was quite shallow
      in my full size lauter tun and I didn't want to add sparge water too 
      violently and disturb the whole bed.


   Add malt extract and boil as normal.


   Chill the wort and pitch.  Aerate vigorously with a hollow
   plastic tube...there's no need to get fancy equipment here.
   With the hollow tube I can whip up a 3" head of froth on the
   chilled wort.  Bubbling activity is almost always evident within
   8-10 hours of pitching a 12-18 oz starter solution.


   Ferment as you would a lager, or do it in a semi-cool room
   (my only option at the time).  You can make a lager outside
   of a refrigerator, but it won't taste quite the same.


Comments:
   Don't worry...give partial mashing a try.  Before doing it, my
   biggest worry was how to keep the temperature constant.  During
   each phase of the mash, I only had to add heat once to keep it
   within a degree or so.


   Variation - Add ale yeast instead and call it a porter.


   Finally, don't worry about extraction rates, points, etc...  The
   point is, you can make a beer distinctly different from anything
   possible with straight extracts by using a mash.  Hook yourself 
   on the idea first, worry about details after you're convinced it's
   not as hard as it sounds.

Subject: ?? Brew head retention techniques ??




I'm a basic "green" extract brewer type of guy, to give you folks a
frame of reference.  My question is:


What methods/ingredients/drewid chants are useful if I want to create
a brew that has a good head of foam when poured (cold or warm) ...
definitely one that is thick and creamy (or otherwise)?  I'm looking
for some input as to ways to toy with the head retention properties of
brew, so if you could phrase your responses in the terms of "This
method does this to brew head" and "This ingredient produces this type
of brew head" and "This chant on this day with this animal draped
about your shoulders produces this type of brew foam ..." these would
be ideal.


I ask this because my last batch, although the flavor was tremendous
(ask me ... I'll tell you ...) after two weeks in the bottle, it had
sort of a sparkling nature to it.  Any head which formed while pouring
quickly dissipated, sort of like a soda does when you pour it.  I'll
admit, the head has slightly improved since then (age has an effect?)
but I'd like to be able to control this quality of a beer myself or at
least have an idea as to what causes/effects it while brewing.


My local brew supply dude suggested a ration of crystal malt be
steeped into my next batch (which is to be a John Bull stout
derivation).  I'm looking forward to trying this additive.  Do yeast
varieties have any effect on brew head?  How about fermentation times
or bottling techniques?  Anyway ...


Thanks.  Either post to the digest or email and I can post a summary.

Hello all,


(Dr. John, You were right!)
1) Barm, n, a peculiar kind of dance.
2) Barm, n, yeast; froth; nonsense; foolish talk;
     -v. used of the mind: to work; to fret; to mix wort with barley to cause
fermentation; used for money; to grow with interest. (side-note: the term
"barming" is used for interest accrual)
Barmy, adj. volatile; flighty; passionate; irascible
(sound like anyone you know?    You can also be barmy-faced! Too much bock, I
guess, see below :-)


The terms are as defined in "Scots Dictionary" circa 1911. (**wonderful**
book, that.)
btw, the same Dictionary defines Bock: v. to retch; to vomit. (Which I don't
think is the meaning the Germans had for it!)
**disclaimer** (there is that word again) No, I have nothing against German
beer... I even drink Maibock on occasion. I grew up in Germany (army-brat)
and IT is responsible for my inability to palate most domestic beers, thank
goodness.
- ----------
While on that subject (bock, not disclaimers) The term Bock is used for some
male stock animals eg, goats, sheep and deer... "Buck, derives from the old
english Bucca, german has a similar root. Which has little to do with the
beer of that name, but 'tis interesting.


Anyway, (ah-ha, a point!) anyone have a mash recipe for a McEwan taste-a-like?
Send direct or general delivery if you think it apropos.

Sure the AAU must be used with volume to be of any use. However the AAU itself
is volume neutral. An AAU is 1/100 ounce of alpha acid, period. No
volume in the definition at all. This is clearly spelled out in Line's
definition of the AAU on page 82 of BBoB. ("One Alpha Acid Unit is represented
by 1 percent of acid in 1 ounce of hops.") I agree that volume must play a 
part in any practical application but disagree that AAUs are exactly the same 
as HBUs.


But to paraphrase Byron Burch (in his newsletter a couple years ago), it's
time to move to on IBUs. For my money AAUs are just a step better than
"Add three ounces of hops" and HBUs not much different (so I'm agreeing with
you in principle).


But just what is an IBU and how can Digest readers make use of this unit? 


For the past couple years I've been refining a spreadsheet I wrote to run with a
customized version of the public domain Unix spreadsheet program named "sc".
Among other things I use this to calculate hop bitterness since it incorporates
isomerization data from Burch's wonderful little book and a bit of refinement 
involving what others have reported about utilization as well as adjustments 
for the gravity of the boiled wort. This has given me a great deal of
predictability as far as basic bitterness goes.


You've been doing similar things, haven't you Darryl?  Perhaps you could give
us a taste of what you will be talking about next month at the conference.
