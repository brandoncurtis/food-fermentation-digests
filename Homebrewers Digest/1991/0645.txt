Subject: Final Gravity Calculation


How does one figure what the final gravity should be when your are not
following a recipe which provides this info?


This is my third batch.  I've kept away from brewing for over a year
due to non-impressive results from the first two.  I've been reading
the HBD to learn more.


Here is the highlights of what I've done:


5/18 - Made yeast starter. Boiled 2 cups M&F Pale DME in 2 quarts of
charcoal filtered water with 8 cascades hop pellets. Added water as needed
during boil.  Added 1/3 pack of yeast nutrient/heading salts after
boil.  Quick Cooled, added 14 gr Whitbred Ale yeast and placed in gallon
jug with air-lock.


5/20 - 3 1/2 gallon boil with charcoal filtered water and
        - 2 tsp Water Salts (gypsum)
        - 2 tsp water crystals (calcium and magnesium sulfates)
        - 1 tsp Irish Moss
        - 3 lbs John Bull Amber liquid malt extract - hopped
        - 3 lbs M&F Amber DME
        - 1 cup M&F Pale DME
        - 1/2 oz Clusters pellets at start and 1/2 oz again 30 min.
        - 1/4 oz cascade pellets at end.
        - last bit of yeast nutrient/heading salts.


    - Quick cooled to 78 degrees in 35 min.


    - Original gravity was 1.046 adjusted to 1.048 for temp.


5/22 - Siphoned off primary into secondary.  I hope the bubbles which
were forming inside the tube were CO2 and not O2 so oxidation is not a
problem.  There were enough bubbles to stop the siphon 4 times.  I'm
sure I kept the primary end of the tube below the surface.  I also
kept the secondary below the surface to minimize oxidation.  The
gravity reading at this time at 76 degrees was 1.022 adjusted to
1.024.  It has a slight cidery taste with a lingering bite (hops?).


What is a reasonable final gravity for this and how do you figure it
out?  Please feel free to critique, I need it.


Thanks,

Subject: Supply info for a new brewer


Hi All!


I just started getting this news group, and hopefully you guys can answer a
few questions for a rookie brewer.  I'm in Dayton, OH and I'd like to start up
a homebrew operation.  Does anyone know of a supplier of brewing equipment as
well as ingredients in SouthWest Ohio (Dayton-Cincinnatti-Columbus)?  I'd also
like any information you have of mail-order type places for supplies.  There
are sure to be more questions as I get started, but a friend of mine has convin
ced me that homebrewing is a very rewarding hobby.  Thanks!

Well, I've finally got it together...


Release 1.0 of "Points of Interest for The Beer Enthusiast (Eastern 
Massachusetts)" is completed!


This is a list of Brewpubs, Breweries, Beer Bars, HomeBrew
Suppliers and Beer Stores in the Boston Area/Eastern Massachusetts.


There are only two Brewpubs and two Breweries so these sections
where easy to put together.


The Beer Bar list I limited to only bars with a decent selection
of interesting beer.  I purposely left out many bars with "a nice
atmosphere and a good pint of Guiness".  This was to keep the list
short and concise for the visiting tourist.  Those establishments
marked with a (*) are  favored by most local beer lovers.


The section on HomeBrew Suppliers is a complete list of shops in
the 508 and 617 area code, to the best of my knowledge.  Every
brewer has  their own favorites and I will make no distinctions as
to which stores are preferred.


The Beer Store list is what slowed me down.  Obviously there are
many stores that sell a moderate selection of beer.  The list that
is presented was taken from the suggestions of local area
homebrewers.  I have first hand knowledge of only a few of them so
I did not make distinctions as to which might be the best to visit. 
Any of them will surely lend to an armful of interesting malt
beverages.  The list is surely not complete and is primarily
centered around Boston.


To enable me to get the first release out as soon as possible I
limited the contents to basic phone book information and hours of
operation.


Ideas for Release 2.0 can be found at the end of page 4.  Any
comments on contents or layout for future releases would be
appreciated as well as input on your favorite Beer Bars and Beer
Stores.


I would like to release a revised version of 1.0 before the AHA
conference, so your timely input would be most appreciated.


Enjoy....

Subject:      Digest No. 644


Greetings,
  A few comments regarding the contents of today's digest (#644) seem in
order.


John DeCarlo asks about culturing yeast from bottled weizens


I can't provide any counter-example, all that I've heard and read indicates
that, at least the German Hefe-Weizens, are filtered and then pitched with
a bottom fermenting yeast prior to bottling.  As to Grant's weiss (sic) beer
I think that they do indeed filter it prior to bottling, if there is a sediment
in it I think it may be something other than yeast (I may be wrong here but I
don't think Grant's does any bottle-conditioned beers).


Bruce Hoylman weighed in with an interesting question regarding various factors
which may affect head formation/retention.


As to the druidic chants, we can only hope that Martin (if it's good enough
for Druids . . .) Lohdahl can provide some help.  As to the more mundane
approaches, crystal malt is reputed to help out head retention, but will
definitely sweeten, and add a caramel note to, your brews if used in any
appreciable quantity; this is definitely not appropriate for some of the
drier styles.  If you are willing to do a partial mash you could use a couple
pounds of malted barley augmented with a half-pound of either cara-pils or
malted wheat (either of which should help out in the head department).
  Are you using sugar in your brews?  Too much sugar is detrimental to head
formation and retention, all-malt beers generally produce a good and reasonably
long-lasting head.
  I'm sure that the temperature of the beer at pouring has an effect, as more
CO2 is held in solution at colder temperatures; but I'll leave the full
explanation of this phenomenon to the more erudite correspondents.
  You might consider priming with wort rather than sugar when bottling, in my
experience this makes for a creamier head (composed of tiny bubbles which seem
to last longer).
  For your stout you might consider using some flaked barley (1/2 pound or so)
in a partial mash.  The proteins in it add to the heading qualities and any
haze they might create would be unnoticeable in a stout.
  Well I've rambled enough, and I'm sure that any misinformation I've imparted
will be corrected by others.


Frank Jones asked about a mash recipe for a McEwan clone,


If you get one I'd sure appreciate a copy, presuming you are talking about
the dark, faintly smoky, delicious stuff we get in the bottle here in the U.S.


Pete Soper asks "what is an IBU"


As of May 7 it is the "Ithaca Brewers Union" as we changed our club's name,
but I presume you are referring to International Bittering Units, and you will
find articles on the subject in the Zymurgy special issue on hops.
In particular, there is an article in this issue by Jackie Rager which gives
several IBU-related formulae.  If you consult this source beware, a close
examination of the examples is required in order to make some transformations
to the general formulae so that they give the desired results.  It isn't
always clear just what units (and how they are measured or transformed) are
required when you read the conceptual presentations of the formulae.  Sorry to
keep ragging on Zymurgy, but it seems that they need to pay a bit more
attention to technical detail when they have equations and formulae in their
articles.  Thankfully, there are usually examples in these technical articles
which give enogh computational details to allow the interested reader to make
the necessary corrections to the notation necessary to arive at the
desired results.  But it would be nice to be able to use the stuff as it is
presented and get the right sorts of answers the first time.


Cheers,


Dr. John

Jaegermeister is a sweet herb liqueur. The exact ingredients are
probably secret, unless you can find some on the bottle. The main
ingredient is definitely sugar, followed by many, many secret herbs
and spices. 


I have seen it sold in this country, too, in several places. It is
quite good in small doses, if you like liqueurs, but don't ever get
drunk on it.  I got the most vicious hangover from it that I have ever
had. Twice, actually; I should have known better after the first time.


There is absolutely no relation between beer and Jaegrmeister, other
than that they both contain alcohol.


"Jaegermeister" means "master of the hunters". The bottle has a deer
with big antlers on the front.

Subject: Another looking for brewpubs


Howdy folks,


   After seeing the posts for just about every city in the US, I haven't
noticed one for the Washington D.C./Baltimore MD area.  Do any brewpubs
exist in this corridor?  While we're at it, how about Philadelphia, PA?


   There are a few places where you can get decent brews; the Brickskeller
in Washington has a good selection, but it's been yeeeears since I've been
there.  The Olney Ale House in Olney, MD has a variable but good selection
of beers, and Guiness, Oxford, and Genessee 12-Hourse (for hot summer days)
on tap.  Also, Oliver's Saloon in Laurel MD has an Oliver's Lager on tap
which is pretty good (brewed somewhere in NY state).  Any other suggestions?

Subject: step mash <-> infusion recipes


Hi folks,


I am currently not set up to do step mashes (and won't be for a while) and 
it seems that the ratio of step to infusion recipes I see is about 10:1. Is 
there a pretty reasonable way to convert recipes using step mash to 
infusion or am I simply limited by the types of grains I can use? I've got 
a Gott picnic cooler mash/lautertun and I'm also wondering if it is 
feasable to do a step mash using this by simply adding different temp 
water or if it is necessary to have a heat source. Thanks for any help.

Subject:  Head Retention Methods


I know of three ingredient factors that will improve head and head retention:
All malt brewing (and that means no corn sugar, even for priming)-Leads to
        tiny little bubbles (in my beer...makes me happy...makes me full of
        cheer...), which will make a creamier head.
Crystal malt-I believe the residual, unfermentable sugars from crystal make the
        beer more sticky or viscous or something, but tends to develop fairly
        slowly.  Mine take about 1 month to fully develop.
Hops-Some component in the hop oil gives the beer head retention.  Some kind
        of detergent, coming from oil I would guess some kind of phospholipid.


All these attempts will be futile if your apparatus from brew pot to bottles
is not very clean.  Any oils will kill the detergent action of the hops (try
drinking a big head beer with greasy potato chip lips), and other forms of
detergents (like Cascade or Ivory liquid) will counteract the hop action.
I have good success with these simple techniques.

The current Builders Square sales circular, for NH at least, has the Hunter
Air Stat for $19.95.  This price is good until May 28th at least, which may
be the day you see this.  The picture in the ad suggests that this device is
used to control an air conditioner, it shows an AC plug for standard house
voltage.

Subject: mold, head


Someone mentioned haveing to throw out a batch because it got some mold on 
it before he pitched. You don't necessarily have to toss it. What have you got
to lose by fermenting it? I had a batch that had some mold on it once.
I skimmed it off, and went ahead with it. The beer tasted good, and
forgetting about the mold, I entered it in a tasting. It won!!!!!
It was only when I went back to my book to supply info on the beer to the
tasting participants, that I found the reference to the mold. 
I forget whether I told them about it, but I think i did;-)




Finding good head, and making it last a long time. -> Think about baseball;-0
Seriously, adding a bit of malted wheat, wheat flakes, or shredded wheat 
can improve head formation, and retention. The wheat has more of the 
head forming protiens that barley has.
 Most heading liquids, or powders are basically edible soap? :-P 
IF you try some, use it in moderation. I once tried some heading powder, at
about 1/8th of the recommended dosage, and the effect was pretty dramatic.

I've had real problems with head retention as well.  Here are a few pointers
I have found out in my search for improving head retention.  I'll leave
out the stuff about protein rests and mashing in wheat since you are
an extract brewer.


     1. Use only FRESH leaf or compressed hop plugs.  These types of hops
        apparently help promote head retention.  If you can't get good
        hops locally, then I suggest mail order (Freshhops is good for
        the limited supply they carry).  Also high alpha acid hops are
        supposed to be best for head retentive qualities (more hop resins).


     2. Ferment at a low temperature.  This sounds a bit iffy to me, but
        Terry Foster mentions this in his book "Pale Ale" and looking back
        at my brews I do note a reasonable probability for correlation.


     3. If you are adding specialty grains, make sure they are taken out
        before the boil starts.  This is because you may leech out tannins
        that will cause the medium weight proteins and albumins to
        precipitate out.  This can cause lack of head retention.


That's all I can think of right now (actually I'm surprised I can think at
all after the day I've had).  Anyway, I hope this helps.  I should point out
that I'm still searching for the perfect head, so perhaps the above is
not really worth looking at.  Then again, I guess it can't hurt.

Attention: Connoisseurs of Beer/Ale and Homebrewers.


I'm going on a holiday to Scotland this summer , 
the hotel is in Ayr in the county of Ayrshire.
We will visit Glascow,Edinburgh and some other larger cities.


Here is some questions.


1. Name some good Scottish Beers/Ales


2. Is there some especially fine Pubs in the areas I will visit ?


3. Is there some breweries that is open to visitors ?


4. Is there some shops with homebrew equipment in the area ?
