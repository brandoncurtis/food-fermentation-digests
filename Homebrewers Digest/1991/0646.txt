Greetings.






I am new to the digest, and this is my first letter.  Please forgive what the


ASCII transfer to E-mail does to its format.






I have brewed a Guinnessesque brew that turned out so well that I must share


it.  I call it Mach Guinness and it has soured ale in it, so I will give you 


both recipes.






                Mach Guinness


        5  lbs   pale 2 row British malt


        1  lb    rolled barley


        1  lb    roasted barley






        2  lbs   ligth dry malt extract


        2  cups  corn sugar


        2  Oz    bullion Hops (1.5 boiling, 0.5 finishing) (preferably whole)


        1  pkg   Whitbread Ale Yeast


        2/3 cup  corn sugar






Mashed 5 lbs 2-row, rolled barley and roasted barley 


        Mashed in at  132 deg F.  


        Protein rest 30 min


        Starch Conversion 2 hours at 153 degrees


        Mashed out 15 minutes at 168


        Sparged with 4 gallons 172 deg water 






Add the 2 lbs dry ME and the 2 cups sugar.  Bring to a boil.  Add 1 1/2 oz of


hops.  Boil 1 hour.  Add 1/2 oz of hops, turn off heat, and let stand for 15


minutes.   Cool wort to 72 degrees, strain into fermenter, and pitch yeast.


(note:  I personally cool the wart in the boiler and then pour it through a


strainer to oxiginate it and remove the hops, as apposed to straining it 


hot,  which oxidizes it)






S.G  - 1.066


T.G  - 1.016






Ferment 7 days.  Rack and settle 6 to 9 days.






one to two days before bottling, sour two bottles of ale.  To do this, pour


two bottles of ale into a steril glass container.  Cover with a clean cloth


secured with string or rubber band.  Put in the cupboard (or somewhere


relatively dark and warm) and let stand one to two days.  It should sour, but


not mold.   






At bottling time, put 2/3 cup corn sugar in the sour ale, and boil for 10 to


15 min.  Add this to the bottling container, and siphon wort into it.  This


gives a good mixture without having to risk stirring it.  Bottle and try in 


two weeks.  The flavour changes week by week and levels off after 6 weeks.


This stout is creamy, but not as heavey as some, with a head that takes 


almost 30 seconds to form, lightly bitter, with that back of the throat 


sourness from the soured ale.






Now, the beer I soured is a unique ale, and you dont have to use it, but it


is also very good, and I know it worked:






                Ides of March Ale:






        1 cup   brewed Kenya AA coffee


        .25 lb  Black Pattent malt


        .25 lb  chocolate malt


        .25 lb  40 deg crystal malt


        1   lb  rice syrup


        1.5 lb  light dry malt extract


        1.5 oz  Willemette whole hops


        1   can Coopers Ale Kit


        1/2 cup corn sugar - bottling


        ??      finings (follow directions)










In three gallons of brewing water, put Black Pattent and Chocolate malt. 


Bring to a boil.  After boil just starts, strain out grains.  Add coffee,


crystal malt, rice syrup, dry ME and 1.5 oz willemette hops.  Boil 45 min.


Add Cooper Ale Kit, and continue to boil 3 to 5 min. (much longer and the


finishing hops in the Coopers kit make the brew bitter)






Cool and pitch with Ale yeast from the Cooper Kit.  






S.G.   1.046


T.G.   1.012


       


Ferment 7 days.  Rack and add finings (or polychlar). When settled, 


bottle with  corn sugar.






Hope someone trys these and has as much luck as I had.  Later - kls

Subject: malty ale recipes?


Hi folks,


I was wondering if any of you had successfully brewed any beers that resemble
malty British pale ales such as Fuller's ESB and all those various, wonderful 
Scotch ales, and what were your recipes?  Since someone recently had requested
a McEwan's recipe, I thought I'd chime in.


It seems to me that such a maltiness in aroma and flavor could be achieved
using German malts such as Munich, but as this is probably not the actual 
ingredient in Fuller's (since the British use British malts and the Germans 
use German malts), I'd like to know how to achieve that maltiness using British
ingredients.  For all I know, this "maltiness" could be accomplished by some 
combination of sugars like demarara or treacle, which I have never used myself
due to their lack of availability in my area.  


Of course, part of the freedom in homebrewing is making German beers using 
British ingredients and vice versa, so *any* recipes you have would be most 
gladly accepted.


Thanks,


STEVE

Subject: Getting "Bombed" on Homebrew


OK, so you thought by my header, that I meant drunk when I said 
"bombed."  Well I got you to read this.


This weekend i got bombed by my own beer bottles.  Luckily I wasn't 
there when it happened, but it could've been pretty bad.  One bottle 
exploded in the case containers I keep my bottled brew in.  So I 
cleaned all the bottles and set them on the counter to dry.  When I 
returned, two more exploded and put glass everywhere.  I'm really glad 
I wasn't home!


A couple of weeks ago I asked about ending SG's of 1026 for an extract 
ale.  I used M&F premium to make this brew, and I added only crystal 
and spray malt to it.  My friend said that it tried to ferment more in 
the bottle, and this caused them to explode.  I waited almost two 
weeks to bottle, so it should have stopped fermenting.  What gives?


Any help would be appreciated.


If anyone wants this recipe to take revenge on someone, email me.


Kieran

Subject: Hops Question




    My question pertains to hop growing.  I planted two rhizomes in mid 
March.  One was a Hallertau the other a Willamatte.  The Hallertau now 
has reached eleven feet, while the Willamatte is six inches tall.  I know 
that the Willamatte is supposedly a slow grower but should it be that 
slow compared to the Hallertau?  Both of them get direct sun and lots of 
water.  For anybody in the San Jose area, is eleven feet good for first 
year growth of Hallertau?
