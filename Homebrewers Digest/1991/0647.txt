Subject: D.C. area brewpubs




In Homebrew Digest #645, David Arnold (davida`at`syrinx.umd.edu) asked
why he hasn't heard anything about brewpubs in the D.C. area.


The most likely reason is that there aren't any. About 2 years ago,
plans were afoot to build a brewpub--tentatively called "Atlantic
Brewing Co." in Alexandria. Brewpubs are legal in Virginia, and a
use & occupancy permit was issued to the would-be brewers. I don't 
think they ever got further than that though, because there certainly
isn't a brewpub in Alexandria today.  
  Would-be brewers are now trying to open a brewpub in D.C. on New
York Avenue at the site of the old Greyhound depot (next to the
convention center). John Ray of the D.C. City Council sponsored a
bill to legalize brewpubs in the District, but I don't know if this
was made into law or not, nor do I know how far along this brewpub
is.
  There are, however, two excellent brewpubs in Baltimore, if you're
willing to make the 45 minute drive up the parkway. Sisson's, at 
36 East Cross Street in the Federal Hill area, offers Cajun food and
some very good ales (as well as a couple thin ones). Sissons seems to
do best with its seasonal specialty beers. I was up there 2 weeks ago
and had an excellent I.P.A.---very hoppy and sharp.
  A few blocks away is the Baltimore Brewing Company (Albemarle and
Pratt Streets). This is a cavernous brick place with huge copper kettles
adorning the back bar. They serve up lagers here, with the most distinctive
being their pils, which is very hoppy and pleasant. I wasn't crazy about
their light lager, but their dark lager was suitably dense and malty.
  If you're just looking for pubs with a good variety of microbrews,
try the Last Chance Saloon in Columbia (e-mail me for directions), which
serves up dozens of different kinds of beer (last time we were in, they
had 17 taps going, including Anchor Foghorn, Wild Goose, and Schlosser
Alt...all at about $2/pint. Monday is a good night because it's half
price hamburger night.
  Another good place is Heroes in Manassas. It's been a couple months 
since I've been out there, but last time was worth the trip. We loved
their house beer, which is brewed by the Old Dominion Brewing Co. in
Chantilly.
Happy Drinking.

Hi folks.  The ascii version of the recipe book, "The Cat's Meow" is now
available at the homebrew archives, mthvax.cs.miami.edu, under the 
directory /pub/homebrew/recipe-book.  The file is  cats_meow.txt.Z
It has been compressed with the UNIX compress utility.  Run uncompress to
restore.  Be sure to set type binary when FTP'ing the file.


There were several requests to me that I could not reply back to.  I mailed
a test message to everyone who requested an ascii version, and those that
got through, I sent a copy of the book to them.  Most of the problems were
the dreaded "Host unknown" error.  I tried everything I could think of, but
finally I have given up.  If there are people out there still wanting an
ascii version of the book mailed to them, please send another email note
to me at the address below.  Please be sure to include all gateways you are
mailing through, or as many hints as possible, so I can get back to you.  (I
do like mysteries, but I need clues).

In HOMEBREW Digest #645, Dr. John commented:

Sacrifice is the answer.  Animal sacrifice can cause trouble with
the SPCA, and human sacrifice has been overdone lately, so I
recommend the practice of sacrificing a bottle of a previous batch
of homebrew early in the boil, and another after the cleanup is
done, by straining the beer through the kidneys ... ;-)

No, I don't think I'd try a stovetop step-mash in a plastic cooler,
either 8-).  Using a single temperature does limit you to grains
that have been pretty completely modified, such as English pale ale
malt, as the basis of the beer.  If the recipe calls for lots of
adjuncts, the pale malt may not be rich enough in enzymes to convert
the mash fully, so some recipes will simply be beyond the scope of
your equipment.  For those within the realm of the possible,
however, conversion is a matter of comparing the mash extract in the
recipe with what you usually obtain with your own methods and
materials, and adjusting accordingly.

Possible, but complex.  You could start out with a very stiff mash,
and add enough boiling water at each step to reach the temperature
you want.  Obviously, this will change the thickness of the mash,
which has all sorts of effects on the conversion.  Equally obviously,
if you overshoot the temperature you'll have to add yet more (cold)
water, and if you overshoot again ...  Some brewers use this method 
as a matter of course, with good results.  Another option is to
go to a decoction mash, where a portion of the mash is abstracted
and boiled, then returned to the main mash to raise the temperature.
This also has its partisans;  I haven't tried it yet.  A very
good description of it can be found in Greg Noonan's "Brewing Lager
Beer", which deserves a spot on every brewer's bookshelf, IMHO.

Subject: Oatmeal stout


  Well I made an oatmeal stout this weekend, complete with
a partial mash (my first mash). , an infusion.  I used 3 lbs of
English 2-row pale malt, 1 lb. of steel cut oats, mashed in 5 qts.
of water, sparged with 2.25 gallons of water through Zapap lauter tun.
The sparge took 20 minutes, which seems fast. I expected ~10 minutes/gallon.
Would the deeper grain bed of a full mash slow things down?  The runnings
were never clear.  I did recirculate the first runnings.  The OG of the
sparge was 1.026 in 3.5 gallons.  Somebody want to figure out my efficiency?
The grain bed was not at all sweet after the sparge, which I took to be
"a good thing".
  I added 3.3lb of dark extract and 3 lbs. of dark DME to the wort and
boiled with 2 oz. of Centennial leaf hops (AU=11.1, total=22.2 WHOOPS!)
Good thing I like hops.  Finished with 1 oz. of Cascade leaf hops. (AU=5)
Pitched Wyeast Irish Ale yeast starter (#1084?), took 24 hrs. for active
ferment.  The Wyeast packet was dated Feb 1991, (I got it cheap). The pouch
was started on Thursday, by Saturday it was nearly fully puffed. I made
a started on Saturday night with it, by Sunday night it was at high
krausen, and by Monday night it was happily eating oatmeal.
  So, other than overhopping, it all went well, and the mash was alot easier
and enjoyable than I expected.  But now I need a bigger brewpot; I was right
up to the edge on this one.

Subject: Durango Brewpubs (an answer not a question)


I made a quick trip to Duango Colorado this weekend to race in the
Ironhorse Classic bike race from Durango to Silverton.  I wasn't
thinking of microbew when planning the trip, but being ever vigilent
I was able to sieze upon the opportunity to sample some of the local
beverages.


I drove up from Albuquerque with a friend Friday afternoon and headed
straight for Pronto's Pizza and Pasta for the usual biker's carbo-
load dinner.  They have a fine buffet there.  Naturally the place was
packed with cyclists and there was a 20 min wait.  I asked if we could
be seated at the bar and we were ushered right in.  I looked at the
taps and saw Durango Lager nestled between Bud and Miller.  Naturally
I ordered a Durango.  I expected some light innocuous lager and was
pleasantly surprised with  a rich dark brew.  I can't do the beer
justice in words.  I'll just say that it was a satisfying, hearty dark
lager with plenty of body and flavor.  It was clear and had a good 
lingering head.  I had a second mug even though I was racing in the
morning.  Cost was $2.50 per mug (10 or 12 oz.).


I asked the bartender if the beer was brewed in town or if it was
a contract brew. She told me it was local and that there was also
a brewpub in town.  I immediately knew where I'd be having lunch
the next day after the race.


The next afternoon we found the Carver Brewing Company.  It's a very
small, plain resturaunt with accompanying bakery and brewpub.  The pub
didn't open until four so we ate in the resturaunt.  Of course they
featured their fresh breads with soups and sandwiches.  I had a turkey
Reuben that was very good except for the out-of-season tomato.  The
beers offered were a honey lager, a pale ale and a stout.  I was very
interested in trying the stout, but after racing needed something
somewhat more refreshing.  I ordered the pale.  It was served in a nice
pint pub glass (I just last week bought some for myself) for $2.50.
Although the waitress had described the ale as bitter, I found it
underhopped for my tastes.  It was also quite cloudy.  In short, it
was an adequate beer, but nothing any of my brewing friends couldn't
easily match or exceed.  I was unable to try any of their other brews
as I had a 225 mile drive ahead of me.


Before leaving, I wandered back into the pub to have a look.  It was 
surprisingly small, having only six tables and four barstools.  
Behind the bar was the obligatory glass window into the brewery.  I
saw a copper brewkettle, a stainless primary and two stainless
secondaries (they were clearly labeled, making identification easy :-)).
It was encouraging to see the small scale of this particular operation.
Maybe there is hope for me.  On the other hand, I expect this
underwhelming operation may well have been unviable without the
substantial bakery operation associated with it.


As for my race; I dropped my chain in the first mile, got it tangled
in the rear derialleur and had to stop to fix it.  By the time I got
back underway, the pack was way down the road and I faced a headwind
in trying to catch up.  I slogged through the race alone and finished
WAY down in the field.  Bike racing can be frustrating, but it keeps
me a skinny homebrewer :-).

Subject: Lager Eggs


I pitched a half gallon starter of cultured Sudwerk (Davis, CA) yeast into a fine batch of wort last week.  After three hours there were six glubs/min.  After
four hours there was a three inch head on the beer.  However, the smell of
rotten eggs came out of the airlock.  It wasn't overpowering, but very 
noticable.  I remember comments in the past about this activity. Is it normal?
Will it go away?  The fridge temp is set at 48 F.
