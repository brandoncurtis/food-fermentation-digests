I think some link in the Internet maze took last Monday off.  I never got 
issue 646.  Could some kind soul please pass ti on to me?  I checked and 
it's not in the Miami archives, either.  I can't ge the Wang archives to 
answer me, so I haven't gotton it from there either.


Thanks a lot in advance, whoever you are.

Subject: carlsberg


Hello all,
  i'm a grain brewer looking for a recipe for my favorite beer- carlsberg.
now hold on, that's carlsberg in denmark, not the wimpy export version.
in denmark it tastes similar to the elephant beer we get here (with a little
less edge).  has anyone tried to approximate it?  don't send me the recipe in
bbltyb- i have it.  i've been playing with the malt combination.  i first
tried straight lager.  i've also tried various lager/amber malt combinations.
perhaps i should move up to pilsner malt next - help!


     the frustrated (but still pretty great) dane.

        Used three gallon pin-lock soda kegs are now available
from Foxx Equipment by mail order for $25. If you've been
looking for a low-buck way to start kegging, this may be the
best deal you'll find on these small kegs. This is an excellent 
price, altho shipping will doubtless raise it.


        You can phone order from two offices:


        421 Southwest Blvd.        955 Decatur St., Unit B
        Kansas City, MO                Denver. CO
        (800) 821-2254                (800) 525-2484

fax        (816) 421-5671                (303) 893-3028


        Just a satisfied customer, who finally has enough
three gallon kegs.

Hello all,
This is quoted from Seventh Generation's catalogue (they sell environmentally
friendly stuff)
   "When paper is bleached with chlorine, dioxins (some of the most deadly
substances known to science) are formed along with other toxins such as furans
and chloroform. Unbleached paper causes less pollution"
   "When chlorine gets into the environment it forms unhealthy compounds like
chloroform" (in reference to using chlorine vs. all-fabric bleach)
   "Our water treatment facilities are overloaded and wastewater is being
dumped directly into lakes and rivers. Therefore it's important to use cleaners
that biodegrade quickly and are as gentle as possible on the environment."
   "to learn more about household chemicals, send $9.95 for the _Guide to
Hazardous Products Around the Home_ to
HHWP, S.W. Missouri State
901 S. National Ave. Box 108
Springfield, MO 65804"
   I doubt that using 2 tablespoons in a gallon of water will be that bad for
the environment, since chlorine is regularly dumped into water by the water
authorities (I lived in Fort Lee, NJ and had to get bottled water, the chlorine
odor was that strong). However, it couldn't hurt to use a less destructive
chemical if there is one that will kill the bacteria like chlorine will.
Hydrogen Peroxide breaks down into O2 and CO2 and is used for disinfecting
cuts, would that do it?

sorry, should have included this with the chlorine stuff,
I have another article on Philly brewpubs. This one is from APPLAUSE, the
magazine of Ch. 12, Philly's PBS station. E-mail me if you want a copy, I
should have it on-line by the time you get this.

Sorry to waste precious space, but neither I nor any of my colleagues at 
Cornell received Digest #646 (Tues. May 28th).  If one of you could forward
a copy to me at:

it would be most appreciated (and then I would be able to forward it onward 
to all the folks here in Ithaca).

Hello everyone.


I am intersted in different peoples techniques and results
in brewing lager beer.  Recently I have been able to clear
room in my refrigerator for a carboy.


Do people find they have better results by doing all the
fermenting in the refrigerator including the carbonating
in the bottles and then storing the beer at room temp (60F).


Or do people do the primary fermenting at room temp and then
store the carboy in the refrigerator for several weeks and then
bottle and leave the bottles at room temp.


Or do people find they have better results by doing all the fermenting
at room temp and then place the bottles in the refrigerator for
several weeks.


What effects does temp. changes have on the beer and the yeast.


If I get enough responses I will post a summary.

While it may be true that all those listed noxious chemical have chlorine
in their chemical formula (PolyCHLORINATED-Biphenyls, CHLORO-Fluorocarbons,
etc.), they certainly don't come from the use of chlorine BLEACH.  It may
be phased out in industry, don't sell your stock in Chlorox.

Subject: Chlorine + Wort -> Chloroform?




Steve Anthony brought up the subject of chlorine.  I've been meaning
to ask what is known about the effect of chlorine on wort.


In the processing of drinking water, a frequent problem is that
chlorine reacts with organic matter in the water, forming chloroform
and related compounds, some of which are carcinogenic.  


Cambridge, Mass. (which has its own water system, mostly separate from
the rest of the Boston area) has this problem; apparently the source
of the organic matter is leaves falling into an open tank, so the tank
is being replaced with a covered one.


A small biotech company in Cambridge got into trouble a couple of
years ago because there was too much chloroform in their effluent
water.  The company didn't use any chlorine compounds, but the people
there analyzed all their processes in an unsuccessful search for the
source.  Finally they measured the chloroform in the city water coming
into their building....


Anyhoo -- wort has plenty of organics in it.  Many people use chlorine
bleach to sanitize equipment.  If anyone has actual information on the
effects of bleach on wort, probably quite a few people would like to
read it.  Meanwhile, thorough rinsing and draining sounds like a good
idea.

Subject: Re: Final Gravity Calculation


     In HBD #645, prcrs!link`at`uunet.UU.NET (John S. Link) asks about
final gravity calculations.  I'm under the impression that FG is
influenced by the type of yeast used and the amount of fermentable
sugars in the wort (e.g., dextrinous worts will have high FGs).


     However, I'm curious as to how the OG is calculated.  This should
be a simple topic, but I've been unable to find a good explanation in
either Papazian's or Dave Miller's books.  Can anyone tell me if the
following is correct (I'm going to use John's recipe as a guinea pig)?


     John uses the following malts:


>         - 3 lbs John Bull Amber liquid malt extract - hopped
>         - 3 lbs M&F Amber DME
>         - 1 cup M&F Pale DME


(I'm ignoring any SG contributions from trace minerals, hops, etc..)


     In Appendix 10 of Papazian's book, there is a table that gives
estimated SGs for different ingredients (this table is on the very first
page of Appendix 10).  Taking the "average" values we have:


In 1 gallon, 1 lb of:                   Will yield an SG:
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malt Extract (syrup)                    1.035 (Papazian gives 1.033-->1.038)
Malt Extract (dry)                      1.040 (Papazian gives 1.038-->1.042)


Note that Papazian gives SG *ranges*.  Here, I'm giving an exact value
to make things easy (but not necessarily exact).


     I'm going to assume that 1 cup of pale DME weighs 1/2 lb (I'm
taking a wild guess at this).


     I'm also assuming that SG can be calculated by individually
calculating the SG contributions of each malt, and then adding them up
to get the real SG value:


***** For the 3 lbs liquid ME:


        0.035(3)/5              = 0.021 <-- SG contribution of this liquid ME
           ^  ^  ^
           |  |  +-- 5 gallon batch
           |  +----- 3 lbs of liquid ME
           +-------- "normalized" SG of 1 lb of liquid ME in 1 gallon
                     (SG is relative to 1.000, so I subtracted 1.000
                     from the value, to make it relative to zero).


***** For the 3 lbs amber DME:


        0.040(3)/5              = 0.024 <-- SG contribution of this DME
           ^
           +-------- "normalized" SG of 1 lb of DME in 1 gallon.


***** For the 1 cup of pale DME (assuming 1 cup DME weighs 0.5 lb):


        0.040(0.5)/5            = 0.004


Adding these numbers, we have (can you really add SGs???):


                                  0.021        <-- liquid ME
                                  0.024 <-- Amber DME
                                + 0.004 <-- Pale DME
                              -----------
                                  0.049  --> SG (OG) of 1.049


John says that the OG was:


>     - Original gravity was 1.046 adjusted to 1.048 for temp.


This is close to the calculated value of 1.049.  If you use the min and
max values in Papazian's table, you get:


        Min OG:                1.046
        Max OG:                1.052


     Is the above right, or have I had a few too many beers?  ;-)


     Also, in HBD #648, Matthias Blumrich <mb`at`Princeton.EDU> asks about
dry ME to liquid ME substitution ratios.  If the above is correct, then
DME can be said to be about 14% "better" than liquid ME (I've also heard
that DME is 20% more "efficient", whatever that is).  To *estimate* the
amount of DME needed given an amount of liquid ME, you would multiply
the liquid ME amount (weight in pounds) by 7/8, or 0.875.
