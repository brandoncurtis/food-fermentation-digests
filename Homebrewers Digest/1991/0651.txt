Subject: re: keg registration


Alan Garvey <Garvey`at`CS.UMASS.EDU> writes about a keg registration law:
...
> A friend of mine who is a member of the town meeting that voted in the
> law (and who voted for it himself -- pinhead) tells me that the police

Pinhead indeed!  Alan's got it pegged:  There's no excuse for passing laws
which won't be enforced exactly as written, and if you think an existing
law won't be used against you, you're at least optimistic and certainly
naive.


The difference between "laws that exist" and "laws that are enforced" is a
very dangerous ground; it should be as small as possible!  That's the area
where laws can be enforced selectively--where two people can do the same
thing but only one gets prosecuted because he is black, is a longhair,
lives in the wrong part of town, doesn't grease the right palm, etc.


If the law is unjust or unfair, bring focus on the law; get it repealed or
rewritten.  The letter of the law (and NOT what some transient council-
creatures promise off-the-record, not-in-writing) is what matters.  If the
letter of the law is unconscionable, the law is unconscionable; don't take
any excuses.

Hallo, my fantastic brevers
 do you know beers as Budvar, Plzen (pilsner) or Kozel (Velke Popovice) ?
I think, this is one of the best beer all over the world.
It is interisting, that Pilsner has alcaline pH.
Do you know some beer with alcaline pH ?

Subject: Beer in Raleigh (Mayberry on Steroids)




I had a chance to sample several beers from Greenshield's, which is
a small brewpub in Raleigh, N.C.
          The light wheat beer was very good.
          The dark wheat beer was very, very good.
          The pale ale was very, very, very nasty.


I will admit that the high quality of the wheat beers may have made a
mediocre pale ale seem worse than it was.  However, it tasted acrid
and somewhat soapy.  Can someone tell me what the most likely culprit
would be for such a flavor?


Finally, I would like to know if anyone can add to the following list
of N.C. Brewpubs...
         1. The Loggerhead
         2. Spring Garden Brewing Company  (both 1 & 2 are here in Greensboro)
         3. Old Heidelberg (formerly the Weeping Radish in Durham)
         4. Greenshield's (Raleigh)
         5. Dillworth's (Charlotte)


Have I missed any?

Subject: Root beers




I am considering brewing a root beer batch.  However, I have always been
warned that since there is little alchohol in root beer, there is nothing
to really inhibit the yeast and the beer must either be drunk very quickly
or refrigerated.


Is this true?

OK, but how about if I give up sex? Can I still drink beer, and live
forever? I mean, what the hell, the beer is way more important than the sex
already...

This may not be entirely true.  I am unfamiliar with this particular law 
but when it comes to state regulations on the alcohol content of beer, the
term 'beer' has a very strict meaning.  It only applies to 'lager'.  Here 
in California there is a 4% limit on the alcohol content of beer, or lager.
However, there is no limit on the alcohol content of ale, stout, porter, 
malt liquor, bock, etc.  As long as you do not call it beer or lager, the 
alcoholic content can be anything.  If the law mentioned above refers
to 'beer' specifically than homebrewers should not be affected.  After all
you can call what you brew anything you want. 


I would be interested in hearing some other opinions on this because it seems to
me that unless they regulate the brewing process, the ingredients, and 
equipment, they could not require you to register the container you keep it in.
You could always claim, "Hey, it wasn't like that when I put it in there."

Subject: Railroad ale


I would love to find an extract recipe for something similar to Devil Mountain
Railroad Ale.  Does anyone have any ideas?  I know the real thing uses Galena
hops, but when I see the high alpha content of Galena I can't relax and I
start to worry.  (Hey, one out of three, right?)  Should I use Galena hops
in the boil or just to finish?  (To sweeten the pot, er, wort a little,
I'll be more than happy to send some of the finished product to the supplier
of the best recipe!)


Direct email is fine.

Subject: Issue #646 again.


If I weren't obsessive-compulsive about having every issue, I'd shine it 
on, but has ANYONE received digest 646?  I haven't found anyone who got it 
at all.  If anyone has it, could I have a copy?  Also, since the archives 
in Miami don't have it, perhaps Mr. Mossberg would like a copy for them 
too.


If Tom Fitzgerald is listening ... I've tried to get stuff from the Wang 
archive server with no success.  Mail to you doesn't get through, either, 
neither do phone calls ... anyhome home?


See ya all later,
