Subject: low alcohol beer


The July 1991 issue of Popular Mechanics has an article on how brewers are
taking the alcohol out of beer.  They say there are 4 ways to take the alcohol
out of beer: vacuum distillation, where the alcohol is boiled out of finished
beer, then things are added to the beer to replace the esters also boiled out;
reverse osmosis, where the beer is pushed against a semipermeable membrane
that only allows the alcohol molecules through;  brewing with a yeast that
only ferments part of the sugars available; and arresting fermentation.


Most brewers use vacuum distillation.  Reverse osmosis is expensive, and is
used by Anheuser-Busch to make O'Doul's.  Birell and Utica Club NA use the
"stupid yeast" (or maybe 'not hungry yeast') method.  The arrested
fermentation method is used by the three beers PM rated highest, Clausthaler,
Haake Beck, and Sharp's.


Interesting article - worth tracking down for a quick look.

Well, this is an age-old controversy, which is why I refrained
from replying until I saw what happened.


Good breweries only bottle when the beer is ready to drink.  How
long it is aged beforehand depends on the type of beer, the
brewery, etc.  For instance, Anchor Brewery stores their ales
cold (45? 50? 55? I forget) for awhile before bottling.  IMHO,
good breweries don't use artificial preservatives (beyond the
yeast and hops).  Therefore, you want to get their beer as
quickly as you can because it should be near the height of flavor
when bottled.  [This does not apply to high-alcohol beers that
can age years.]  Remember, the longer it is in the bottle, the
more likely it will be mishandled by being stored in hot
conditions or somesuch.


So, what about the beer you make yourself?  After being on both
sides of the fence, I think that fresh is good, but not the
end-all and be-all of brewing.  I store my beer in the basement,
not exposed to light or heat, fairly cool (roughly 60F all year).
So I have had good beer over a year old.  Still, if I don't like
the taste at a week in the bottle, I figure there is something
about my brewing process that could be improved.


I have found that 1 week-old beer brewed with liquid yeast is
much, much better than the 1 week-old beer I made with dry
packets.  I now regularly drink the beer young and enjoy it and
remark on the changes that occur as it ages.  I like my beer both
fresh and aged, now that I think I am doing things more-or-less
right in the brewing process.

OK, here is another data point.  Before having ever brewed (and,
unfortunately, not knowing other brewers in the area), I read
what I could find on the subject.  Someone I talked to
recommended avoiding older books on the subject, so I ended up
with Papazian and Miller.  I thought Papazian was interesting and
informative, but not really very helpful for a novice brewer who
wasn't really sure if he had all the equipment, etc.  Miller
tried to be very thorough, explain what equipment you needed and
what you probably already had in your kitchen you could use.  His
procedure was very detailed and easy to follow.  I knew if I
followed Miller I would not miss any steps, so I could relax.


In other words, it sort of depends on your personality and such,
but I think Miller is by far the best for someone who hasn't
brewed at all before.  Once you are comfortable with the process
and equipment, Papazian then is more fun and has more interesting
recipes.  Miller does become useful again when you want to get
beyond the basics of extract brewing.

I didn't notice a smiley-face here.  If I don't want any malt

People have already mentioned the two brewpubs in Baltimore.
Here in the DC area, there is a lot of activity.  In Old Town
Alexandria, at the corner of King St. and Arthur St., a brewpub
called King Arthur's is due to open this fall.  I talked to the
guy running things and all the legal hassles seem to be taken
care of, so it will probably open as planned.  The current plan
is to invite the members of the brew club BURP to a pre-opening
event.  I will post a review if I make it, sometime this summer.

Here is my relatively unbiased analysis of the situation.


1) Flavor.  Some brewers can taste the aluminum-imparted flavor
in beer brewed in aluminum.  Some can't.  Highly acidic liquids
(wort is only mildly acidic) leach out aluminum (I know *I* can
taste a metallic taste if tomato sauce is cooked in aluminum)
from some types of pans.  So, this is a human variable, at least.


2) Health.  Current studies have established no link between
dietary aluminum and any diseases.  Also, other sources of
dietary aluminum (such as plants grown in soil) far outweigh any
possibility of aluminum from brewing.


3) Color?  Haven't heard of any relationship there.
4) Aroma?  Ditto.

Hi Al - Beer carbonation is generally expressed in volumes, that is how
many volumes of CO2 at standard temp and pressure per volume of beer.
Carbonation ranges from around 1 vol for "flat" British ales to nearly 3
volumes for a very lively beer like Anchor Steam.  Going for two volumes,
you"d need enough CO2 to make 4 liters at STP.  From the ideal gas law,
one mole of gas (44g of CO2) fills 24.4 liters at 1 atm. and 25 degrees c.
So you need (4 liters)*(44 g/mol)/(24.4 liters/mol) = 7.2 gm dry ice.
Let us know if it works - it is probably easier to deal with dry ice than
with a whole kegging/pressure regulating setup.  BTW, one caution, if you
don't know how many volumes of CO2 are in the beer already, go easy on the
dry ice.  Happy bubbling, Jean

Subject: Samuel Adams Beer taste-alike


Several months ago I posted a request for a recipe for something that
tastes like Samuel Adams Beer.  Several of you replied, and I brewed a
four gallon batch based on the collective wisdom of these replies.  I
used a 3.3 lb. Cooper's Ale kit, steeped one pound of Crystal malt for
30 minutes in 2 qt. of water heated to 170 degrees F, added it to the
syrup from the kit and water, added 3/4 oz. of Saaz hops and boiled for
30 minutes, then removed the heat and added 3/4 oz. of Saaz hops for
finishing.  Although I am a fanatic for liquid yeast, I (grimaced and)
added the dry Coopers yeast supplied with the kit to the cooled wort in
the primary.  I transferred to secondary after two days.  All
fermentation was at approximately 60 degrees F.  I primed with 5/8 cup
of corn sugar.


I tasted the beer for the first time two days ago. It was wonderful--
very similar in taste, body, and color (where did the red come from?)
to Samuel Adams, but just a hint of the flavor of Anchor Steam Beer.
I'm going to try to brew the exact same thing again this weekend--the
first time in over 30 batches that I will ever have tried to brew an
exact replica of something I have brewed before.


Thanks to you homebrewing folks who supplied me with the good info.!

Acrid could be one of many things, those more knowledgable than I will
better be able to identify the source.  A good fresh Goldings hop
(particularly the British, as opposed to the British Columbian or 
Oergonian) sometimes has a soapy flavour.  I remember noticing it for
the first time in English real ale - a London brewer, a pale ale, but
darned if I can remember which! - and being a little taken aback.  I
came to appreciate it with time, but was never able to duplicate it
with the domestic Goldings I got in Toronto.




On a different note, I somehow suspect NOBODY RECEIVED #646!!!!!

This is right, EXCEPT that you made one very common mistake.  You want
to divide by the volume of wort at the end of the boil, and that's not
5 gallons.  You may end up with 5 gallons of beer, but chances are
you're starting with more like 5.5 - 5.75 gallons of wort at the end of
the boil.  You lose some of that during the remaining steps (e.g., some
gets soaked up and thrown away with the spent hops, some gets left
behind during siphoning, some goes out the blowoff hose if you use that
method, etc.).  This may seem like a fine point, but it makes a
surprisingly large difference in the OG that you calculate.


It just so happens that I wrote an article about this topic for the
most recent issue of my brewing club's newsletter.  It describes
techniques I've been using which allow me to decide what I want my OG
to be, formulate a recipe, brew it, and reliably hit the target OG
almost exactly.  The article is aimed at grain brewers, but the methods
would also work for extract brewing.  If anybody would like a copy, I'd

A couple of comments on keg registration in Amherst Mass.  The problem isn't
that the law was passed after the students left, it was that most were not
registered voters and could not vote on the issue.  Your friend may indeed be a
pinhead but he did register and did vote.  Sitting on your ass relaxing with
a homebrew will only produce sewage.  Quibbling over the definition of beer
isn't a solution either.  If people are concerned about Neo Prohibitionism then
they need to have their votes and voices heard.  The sad thing about this type
of law is the drinking problem it tries to address will not go away, people
will make "party punch" in plastic buckets or buy Matt's Beer Balls (if they
hold less than 5 gallons), and the law will still be on the books.

        My biggest concern with many authentic root beer recipes is that they
        call for many bizarre and hard to find ingredients.  Of course, one
        can always get the extract, but that just doesn't sound like as much
        fun to me.  Besides, I'm not that big of a root beer fan anyway.


        What I would love to try is a cream soda recipe!  Does anyone have an
        actual recipe for cream soda?  I'd prefer one that starts "from scratch"
        rather than from an extract.


If anyone does have a cream soda recipe from scratch, please post it 
or email it to me as well...


As an aside, there are two types of 'cream soda' sold in North America.
In the good ole' USA, we have 'Cream' or 'Creme' or 'Vanilla Cream' or
something along those lines.  What you get is a soda that is slightly
golden colored and has the taste of vanilla - as in vanilla beans,
or extract or ice cream.  


Canada (at least Montreal and the southern part of Quebec province) has
a soda called 'Cream Soda' or in French 'Soda Mousse'.  This is a clear
soda which tastes remarkably like cream (as in dairy cream) and has a
long lasting head (for soda that is).  The Canadian cream soda uses as
an ingredient either saponin or quialla (sorry about the spellings) which
is an extract from plants that is used to make soap - I guess just a bit
in the soda makes for the wonderful head you get.


I have also seen in Montreal a 'cream nectar' type of soda, made by
Canada Dry in Canada, which is similar in taste to the 'cream soda'
we get in the US, but which also had the frothy head of the other
Canadian 'cream soda'. 


I would be interested in seeing if anyone does have a recipe for
'cream soda' and which one - US or Canadian?


For the US version, I'd think that a vanilla extract/sugar syrup
mixture to suit your taste would be a good starting point, then
make as any other soda.
