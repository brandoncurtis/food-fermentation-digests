I bottle mine with corks, but I don`t think that it really matters.  I`ve
talked to the winemakers at a couple wineries about this, and they said that
corks are used now days mostly because their customers associate corks with
better wine.  Crown caps are cheaper, and provide a better seal.  I use corks
for the same reason as the wineries - they look better.

Yes, mashing can convert the dextrins in crystal malt to simple sugars. But it
won't convert the carmelized sugars, and that's part of the intended
contribution of crystal malt, as well. So, what about mouth feel and sweetness?
They must be controlled with mashing temperature, which can be adjusted to
favor a dextrinous wort. Or, you can add the crystal after the mash, just like
you would in an extract brew.

Subject:  Light Struck beer.


The problem with UV exposure of beer is that a photoisomerization of certain
hop components occurs, producing a "skunky" aroma.  In some beers on some
occasions, it is VERY distinct.  The worst I've had it was with a fifth of
Steinlager (have you had one yet?) from New Zealand.  It is bottled in green
glass, which doesn't absorb very much in the high frequency wavelength.  Brown
glass absorbs very well in this range.
Finally, to answer the question that was asked in #653, most breweries DON'T
protect their beer in green or clear bottles, and it IS susceptible to skunk.
Miller Brewing Co. chemically converts their hop components so that they can
no longer be converted into the skunky aromatic, while still retaining its
hoppy character.

On the subject of dry ice for beer carbonation I would like to post two
comments that came in since HBD652.  First, dry ice is not known for
food-grade cleanliness, so anything carbonated with it should probably be
consumed within a day or two to avoid the possibility of spoilage.  Second,
the formula I gave was for volumes CO2 at room temperature, 25 degrees C.
If you want to calculate volumes at 0 degrees C you have to use 22.4 liters
per mole, not the 24.4 that I gave.
   So, Al, did it work?  --Jean

Is this James Clement the same one who (I believe) owns the Chapterhouse,
and who briefly ran a brewpub near Syracuse University called "Clement's
Brewpub" (which has since reverted to being "Hungry Charlie's")?  I always
try to visit the Chapterhouse whenever I'm in Ithaca, and I've been
wondering about the "story" behind the Chapterhouse's origins and the
owner's plans for expansion of his brewing enterprise.


Also, how widely will the products of the Clement Brewing Company be
distributed?  And does anyone know the story behind the rise and fall of
"Clement's Brewpub" in Syracuse?


By the way, I'm glad to see that Michael Jackson has paid a visit to the
Chapterhouse; a favorable entry for it in one of Jackson's books will make
for excellent publicity for an otherwise (in my opinion) too little-known
establishment.

Subject: Mashing High Dextrin Content Malts


  I don't really have any proof for my explanation of why mashing crystal
leaves dextrins, but I think it is fairly reasonable.  Basically, the
reason that the complex sugars are not reduced to more simple sugars is
that the enzymes work at a certain rate.  They convert starch into complex
sugars and convert those complex sugars into simpler sugars.  The typical
mash leaves a certain amount of complex sugars in the wort simply due to
the fact that the length of the mash was not long enough to convert all the
complex sugars.  That being the case, when we increase the level of complex
sugars at the beginning of the mash (by adding crystal malt, etc.) that
level is still present at the end of the mash (although, probably not
derived from the crystal malt itself, since that would have been
converted right away).        Anyway, you can get a farily good idea of the
dextrin content of your wort by closely inspecting your iodine test.
Starch will turn iodine blue and simple sugars do not change the colour
appreciatively.  However, complex sugars will change the colour of iodine
to a fairly dark brown.  By inspecting the colour of the iodine test you
can fairly easily get an idea about the fermentability of the wort and can
adjust the length of time you spend mashing accordingly.

I've used crown caps on large beer bottles, and plastic champagne style

Subject: Use of sugar


David Taylor (I think) asks what good and bad experience we've had
with using sugar in our brews.  Here's my bit:


I've had mediocre experience, and striking experience.  The mediocre stuff
was beer that wasn't half bad, but not quite as good as what I make now.
The best thing about homebrew is that one's first efforts are really good
even if the recipes use a lot of sugar -- the freshness must compensate.


One very stiking batch was a pale ale.  My brew-partner and I used a
fair amount of cane sugar in the batch.  The stuff was awfull for quite a 
while.  I think the yeast was partly to blame, but the stuff smelled and
tasted almost like apple juice for a good 5 weeks.  But once that went
away, and it did, what remained was a clean, refreshing, beautiful beer.


People have come forth and admitted to using sugar in their brews with
good results.  It just creates a beer with different characteristics --
and isn't that what homebrewing is all about?

Subject: Trouble with trub, crystal malt




        Hi.  I've got a couple of questions for you gurus out in homebrew land.
I am an intermediate extract/speciality grain brewer who has been making some
tasty (IMHO) brews for a while but needs some pointers on technique so that I 
can completely RELAX!  I am having a bit of trouble removing the trub and 
hop bits before adding my wort to the primary.  I typically add 1/2 tsp. of 
Irish moss 15 minutes before the end of the boil to aid the hot break and 
cool the wort by placing my brew pot in a sink full of cold water.  The 
funnel I use for transfering the wort to the carboy has a fine screen in 
it for catching particulate matter.  Upon pouring the wort through the screen,
the screen becomes immediately clogged and I spend 20-30 minutes transferring
the wort as I must continually pause to scrape the the screen clean.  Though 
I'm not worried, I am concerned about exposing my wort to the air for so long.
I also find I am getting lower starting gravities because so much wort is
caught up in the trub and hop bits.  Is there a simple way around my problem?


        I am thinking of building a simple immersion wort chiller as I've seen 
dicussed in this digest, in the hope that more efficent cooling will 
precipitate trub better.  I am also thinking of placing my hop pellets in a
homemade hop bag made from some cheese cloth.  Will this be alright?  Does
using a hop bag decrease hop utilization?  Hop aroma?  Enquiring minds want to
know!


        On a different matter, does anybody know the approximate degrees
Lovibond (sp?) rating of crystal malt.  The stuff I have been using is making
my beers darker than I like and I was wondering if I got a bad batch or 
something?


        Sorry if any of theses questions have been previously discussed.
Thanks in advance for the advice.

I got interested in this during the last discussion, and
did some more reading on it.  I should probably go back
and read some more before I open my mouth (for fear of
sticking my foot in it), but here goes ...


I think there are a couple of things that keep you from
converting "all those dextrins" into fermentable sugars.
First of all, mash temperature will have a lot to do with
how fermentable your wort is.  A higher temperature mash
will leave you with more unfermentables, as the enzymes
are denatured by heat over time.  I think the beta(?)-amylase
(Papazian's "nibbler") stops working at a lower temperature,
and I would think that this is the enzyme that makes most
of the fermentables.  (sorry if I've got alpha- and beta-
amylase mixed up, go check Papazian).  This is why a hotter
mash will give you fewer fermentables, and a fuller bodied
beer from the unfermentable dextrins.


Also, (here's where I get hazy) I think there are dextrin
configurations that alpha- and beta-amylase cannot break
down.  I think these "limit dextrins" are different for
each of the enzymes.  So while you're mashing, you've
got a couple of things keeping it from going too far:
some of the dextrins get in a configuration where the
a- and/or b-amylase can't do anything to them, and the
heat is destroying the capability of the enzymes to break
down the dextrins that they CAN still work on.

"bombed."  Well I got you to read this.
 
This weekend i got bombed by my own beer bottles.  Luckily I wasn't

cleaned all the bottleh. I rlla
I wasn't home!
 
A couple of weeks ago I asked about ending SG's of 1026 for an extract
ale.  I used M&F premium to make this brew, and I added only crystal
and spray malt to it.  My friend said that it tried to ferment more in
the bottle, and this caused them to explode.  I waited almost twoavstpermti. hAny help would be appreciated.

In particular he wonders about how the can use cane sugar.  My bet: they
don't.  I bet they use corn sugar (or corn syrup, which I believe contains
the same sugar).  This mailing list has a strong phobia about using sugar
in homebrew.  I don't.  I use it in every batch and I never get cidery flavors.
I owe this to two things:


NEVER USE CANE SUGAR (or beet sugar) because this contains sucrose which is
only partially fermentable.  A friend made his first batch using sucrose --
very cidery.  Corn sugar is dextrose (which I believe is just a commercial
name for glucose) which is fully fermentable.


Ferment cool.  I ferment at about 60 degrees F.  I did notice some very off
tastes when I fermented at 80F.  Chest freezers with Hunter AirStats do
wonders!


CAVEAT: I can only speak for extract/adjunct brewing, but I really don't see
why mashing would be any different with respect to sugar.

Has anyone ever seen a definition for "quonchologus" (p.38 CJOHB)???
It's not in OED, suprise.


I haven't looked but is there anything on GEnie similar to the homebrew
network??


Thanks,

If I prime with honey, how much do I use to be equivalent to, say,
3/4 cup of corn sugar?  My first guess would be about 1/2 cup,
but does anybody know?
