  Mr. Ed's Oatmeal Stout is finally in the bottle.  I was hoping the
specific gravity would fall a little more, but it's done at 1.026,
down from 1.062.  I think the cause is a partial mash (3 lbs. pale 2-row
and 1 lb. oatmeal) at too high a temp.  The strike water was too hot, and
I didn't want to add too much cold water.  It spent too much time in the 
high 150's.  Have I made a reasonable deduction?

Subject:      Re: Trouble with Trub (HBD #655)


To add to the anti-trub arsenal:  I use leaf hops in a cotton mesh bag to
finish, generally adding them as I'm turning the heat off under my big
canning kettle. After the immersion chiller has done its work I fish out the
bag and lodge it atop the fine screen in my big funnel.  Then I siphon off
the wort through the hop bag.  Not only are extra hop flavor/aroma compounds
extracted out (I think!) but the bag and pad of hops act  as an effective
filter aid to catch trub and fragments of pellet hops.  After all the wort has
gone through, I press down on the bag with a big clean spoon to squeeze out
the last drops.
   Another decent alternative is to leave the last quart of wort and trub in
the boiling kettle.  After pitching, come back and filter out the trub with
a coffee filter, then freeze the wort.  Next time you want to make a starter
culture or some agar slants, you have known-quality wort all set to go with
only a brief sanitizing boil needed before use. Oh, you can also add your
O.G. sample to it unless you're a confirmed wort sipper (yum). -- Jean

It's probably called a punt because that's where the glassblower

Either you've been lucky or I've been unlucky. Like you I just used to 
give everything a good wash out, often with boiling water. Notice the 
past tense though!! I got away with it for about ten batches. The last 
time I did this (about two years ago) I noticed fermenting bin was getting 
a bit brown and made a note to use a chlorine cleaner before the next 
brew. I was too late! It fermented messily all over the floor. It looked 
foul and slimy; it stank. I tried barreling it anyway in the hope it might 
come right. It didn't and I had to throw it away. It then took _ages_ to 
get the taint out of the barrel. It only takes one bad batch to change your
mind.

I've had good success with TriSodium Phosphate (TSP). TSP is not so corrosive to
be dangerous (gloves are recommended but I often get it on my arms with no ill
effects), but acts like a corrosive cleaner. I tried an experiment. After I 
rinsed and ran the usual bleach solution through my counter-flow chiller until
it ran clear, I ran a solution of TSP through, and it came out yellow and
eventually ran clear. The TSP was able to clean beyond the power of the bleach
solution alone. No real surprise. TSP is also great for dissolving the gunk out
of your blow-off hose.


TSP is available in the paint section of most hardware-type stores. It's used 
for preparing surfaces for painting. I've heard that some homebrew suppliers sell
a dry bleach/TSP combination called tri-chlor. I don't use this because I'm
typically only cleaning afterword (with TSP) or sanitizing beforehand (with
bleach).


Stay clean,

The sunlight-hop reaction takes more than seconds. I seem to remember the
number of 30-45 minutes as being right to convert a sufficient quantity for the
skunkiness to breach the threshold for human detection. Of course you could
have an amazingly sensitive palatte to this substance..


From what I've heard/read Miller has a patented process which they use to treat
the hop oils (they don't add whole hops) that they add to their beer.

  Soon the local strawberry crop (Washington and Oregon) will be ready.
  The thought of a pound, or so, of strawberries in a Rocky Raccoon Honey
  lager sounds delicious.


  However, I've noticed that *The Catus Meow* (an outstanding effort, btw),
  Papazian, nor HBD (from #577 to date) discuss strawberries as an
  ingredient in beer.  Why?  Any recipes or brewing suggestions?

Maybe commercial brewers use nasty corrosive chemicals but many 
brewpubs use boiling water or wort just like we do.  My technique is 
this:


Follow a chilling session with a gallon or so of boiling water through 
the coils after draining the chiller body of its water, to cut the 
malt sugars from the copper.  Usually I follow that up with some of the 
sterilant (I use 1 T. clorox per 1 gallon of water) that I've been 
using for that session, until the sterilant runs cool from the coil 
(since high temperatures destroy the disinfectant effects of clorox).  
Drain. Store dry.  


Prior to the next session of brewing, I will usually fill the chiller 
coils back up with the sterilant solution and let it sit for about 20 
minutes.  Drain.  When I begin the chill routine, I run the boiling hot 
wort through the chiller prior to filling the chiller body with water.  
The boiling hot wort will sterilize the coils for sure.  Toss the first 
few ounces of wort that comes through since some clorox will be in it.   
Let a quart or so of wort run through then return it to the boiler.  
Fill the chiller body with water and let 'er rip. 


The boiling wort through the coils is what really does the trick with 
this routine just like it does with immersion chillers.  So why do I 
still use the clorox solution?  It's simple.  It only takes a minute 
and I'm paranoid as hell! 




The most effective means for straining wort into the fermenter 
discussion has popped back up so here again is my pot-scrubber-in-a-
mesh-bag technique for filtering hops: 


I've never been a fan of pouring wort through a filter because filters 
clog and you're bound to pour at least some trub into the fermenter. 


Buy a copper wound pot scrubber and a fine mesh hop bag.  Also get a 
rather thick rubber band.  It also helps to have a copper pick-up tube 
if you're going to siphon hot wort into your fermenter.  If you're 
cooling it first, one of those plastic pick-up tubes will do the trick. 


Tie the pot scrubber around the bottom of the pick-up tube (the end 
that's going into the wort).  Then tie the fine mesh hop bag around 
that, in effect putting the pot scrubber in a bag.  (Oh, yes, "No see-
um netting" from a camping store works well, also.) 


Tie a small 1/4" overhand loop in one end of the rubber band.  Loop the 
other big end around and through the handle on your boiling pot.  Now 
slip the pick-up tube through the small end of the rubber band.   If 
you've tied the small loop small enough, the rubber band will grab the 
pick-up tube at whatever position you want.  Suspend the pick-up tube a 
couple of inches below the top level of the wort.  Start your siphon.  
The mesh bag/pot scrubber combo will effectively filter out all the hop 
leaves and particles.  By siphoning from the top level of the wort, 
you'll always be siphoning off the clearest portion of the wort.  As 
the level of the wort recedes, slowly inch the pick-up tube down 
accordingly, always keeping it an inch or two below the surface.  This 
technique will give you the cleanest possible run-off into the 
fermenter without clogging the siphon. 


Others have commented on the effect of whirlpooling the wort before 
starting the siphon, so I won't comment on that.


Cheers,

Subject: Trub Removal, etc.


Ah yes, trub removal.  The method I use seems to alarm some people,
but the only trouble I've ever had with it is when it works too
well.


I use an immersion chiller.  At the end of the boil, I immediately
begin chilling, and keep going until the temperature differential
between the tap water and the wort is about 20 degrees F, or so. 
I use the hot water this generates for cleanup.  Then I attach
a pump, and recirculate ice water through the coils until the 
temperature is near freezing.  I then do the whirlpool thing,
and rack into a sanitized carboy, which I cap and leave overnight
to settle.  In the morning the wort is very clear and there is a
generous layer of previously-suspended trub on the carboy floor!
I rack into my fermentor (7-gallon acid carboy), and pitch.


In a sense, I was better off before the chiller, when I was doing
mainly partial-mashes.  Since I was boiling only a part of the total
volume, I could use ice directly in the wort to chill.  I usually
boiled the water first, but not always.  Never a problem, and some
of the best cold breaks I've ever had.


The concern seems to be sanitation.  While I can't go as far as
Father Barleywine (having tasted altogether too many contaminated
homebrews and microbrews, and since I culture Pediococcus damnosus
and Brettanomyces bruxellensis for use in making imitation lambics),
I have to say that I've never had a hint of infection using this
technique.  I live in a microbiologically relatively benign climate;
your mileage may vary.  The only problems I've ever had with it are
when I've sacrificed too much wort in the interest of keeping trub
absolutely out of the ferment.  There seems to be some interaction
between trub and yeast in the aerobic phase, and feeding the yeast
just a little of it seems to start the fermentation a bit faster.  I
can't quantify this; it's altogether an impression.  Also, a
trubless brew can end up "too clean", especially after the wild
originality of your first few batches.


I was surprised to hear Dr. Michael Lewis say that they'd researched
the effect of fermenting with varying degrees of trub in the brewing
lab at U. C. Davis, and had found it made much less difference than
they'd expected.  It made a rather large difference in my beer, I
can tell you!

Subject:      Trub removal,cleaning copper,reusing yeast,cleaning counterflows




Trub removal:


When I first used leaf hops, I followed the suggestion from the HBD and
used a copper pot scrubber with a muslin (cheesecloth type) bag wrapped
around it and secured to my siphon tube.  I got all of my wort out and
left behind the trub which stuck to the leaf hops.  This worked so well
that for my next batch using hop pellets, I did the same thing.  I got
a very small amount of trub in my primary.  As the mass of shredded hops
moved toward the siphon pickup, it acted as a sort of filter.  I was
amazed how well this worked for pellets and it is now a part of my
brewing procedures.


Cleaning copper:


Whenever I use copper for the first time, whether tubing or a pot
scrubber, I always boil it with some vinegar.  This removes any
oxidation off the copper and leaves it shining bright...also sanitizes
it inside and out...Rinse well!


Cleaning counterflow chillers:


I simply run hot tap water through mine for about 5 mins after use.
Before my next usage, I again run hot tap water through it, then use
a weak bleach solution for 5-10 mins, then run hot tap water through
to rinse. Works well and I've never had a contamination problem.


Reusing yeast cake:


I thought I'd give this a try.  Boy does it work!  I had fermentation
going within 15 minutes of pouring in my new wort. By the next morning,
I had blown the top off the fermentation lock in a 7.5 gallon carboy
and foam was oozing everywhere!  Is this normal for reusing the yeast
cake in a primary?  I'd definitely NOT do this again without using a
blow-off tube.  Seems like this method of reusing yeast is overpitching
and causing the yeast to skip it's reproductive stage.  How will this
affect flavor?

Although Scottish beers are not in great abundance (in terms of variety) they
are available along with a plethora of British ales. Some of the brews you
can expect to come across are:


Tennent's Lager (Are you ready?),  McEwan's Lager, McEwan's Export,
Sunderland (Draught Bitter), Newcastle Brown Ale, (Take Up) Hemeling (Lite
Lager), Carling Blacklabel, Camenoris Strongarm (The Mightiest of Beers),
Federation Brewery Lager, M&B Brew XI (Have a pint of the Midlands),
Norseman Lager, Camenoris Best Bitter, Courage (Light Ale), Bank's (Traditional
Draught Beers), Courage Beer, Theakston Ales (150 Years of Tradition),
The Royal Silver Jubilee, Whitbread Shandy, Lion Lager, 70p, 80p,
Tartan Sp.


As far as homebrew shops are concerned, there ione on Main Street in Stirling
and there is one in St. Andrews. I couldn't get any information on breweries
that offer guided tours, but I'm sure a few well placed phone calls will get
you the help you need once you are in Scotland.


Good luck and happy drinking! I hope that this posting will be helpful to any
HD suscribers who may find themselves in Scotland some day...it certainly has
wet my appetite! Cheers.
