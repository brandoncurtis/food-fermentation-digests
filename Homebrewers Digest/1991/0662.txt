Why not, Good German beers exhibit exactly this type of behavior when poured in
a "beer clean" glass. I've brewed many a homebrew that exhibited nice smooth
carbonation, excellent head, and left a lace. While they may choose to brew
swill for marketing reasons, the skills of the brewers at places like Miller
and Anheuser Busch are actually quite good. It takes a lot of skill to create a
product that while brewed at several different plants across the country,
tastes the same everywhere, state to state, month to month, year to year.
It's just so sad they choose to exercise this enviable skill in th epursuit of
thoroughly lackluster beer.

Tim I must be some kind of alien, cause I eat chocolate every day, and while I
moderate my consumption of ice cream in recent years, I still eat it an average

diet help a bit.

        This has been my experience with the Wyeast culture;
it's actually two yeasts: S. Delbruckii (the weizen yeast) and
S. cerevasii (?) (top fermenting ale yeast). They use a
mixture because they're afraid S. Delbruckii alone would be
too intense for most folks.


        If the fermentation temperature is too low, I think
the ale yeast takes over. S. Delbruckii is just not as
vigorous a yeast as most, and doesn't compete well. I've had
good wheat beer made with it; the secret seems to be to
ferment it warm (70F+).


        An easier way is to get ahold of MeV #033, a pure
weizen yeast culture.


        In my quest for the elusive clove aroma, I've done
some rather extreme things. My first weizen was 100% wheat
extract (Ireks) using the Wyeast, and had very little wheat
character. My second was the same wort (but double strength; I
call it a "doppelweizen") with the MeV yeast, and it is
incredible. LOTS of wheat character.


        To further isolate variables, I'm brewing a barleywine
with lite malt extract with the yeast from the secondary, to
see just what it takes to get the taste. I'll report when it's
ready to drink.


        Hang in there. It *can* be done.

Subject: Wort bombs and Question about Kegging.


Greetings,


   Last night I brewed up another batch and had a strange occurrence.  I pitched
the yeast (started in about 3 cups of wort for about 1hr) at 1am and this
morning at 8:30am I woke up to a wort bomb ready to blow.  I had the wort in a
plastic bucket (7 gal I think) with a fermentation lock on it.  There was only
5 gallons of wort.  With the air lock off foam keeps spewing out the hole in
the lid.  This happened with my last batch and it turned out just fine, so, of
course, I'm not worrying.  I'm just wondering if anyone might know why I'm
getting so much foam.  This has happed once or twice in the distant past also,
but it certainly has not been the norm for me.
   The last time this happened I thought it was the yeast.  It was the first
time that I used Red Star.  But this time I used Edme.  Both times I used two
packets and started them the same way.  I don't think that there is anything
wrong with this, I sure am getting short lag times.  It does make a mess
though.


   This time I'm going to make my first attempt at kegging.  I've seen a lot
stuff pass through the net on this topic and I have a question that I haven't
seen addressed.  It is suggested that, when using a soda cylinder, you
cut the last 1/2 inch off the liquid outlet tube that sticks down to the
bottom of the keg so you don't suck the yeast off the bottom.  However, the
keg that I have (Coke type) has the tube and fitting connected right on to
the cylinder, not the lid.  I see no way of getting the tube out to cut it,
short of undoing the whole fitting.  Is this what is done, or is everyone
smart enough to know not to get this type of keg?
   If I don't cut the tube, will I just be able to suck the sediment off the
bottom with the first few glasses?  If I suck the sediment out too early
will I have problems carbonating?  (I definately prefer natural carbonation).
   Thanks in advance.


                Looking forward to tapping that keg,


                                                Joe

The trouble with beer, wine, etc. is that the calories add to my mass
and the alchohol adds to my inertia, and the combination adds to my belly.


Is there any difference between weizen, weissbier, and wheat beer? or are
these all names for the same thing? A friend of mine had some weissbier in
germany and loved it. She says she'll do nearly anything ;-) for me if I'd
make some for her.


Michael Bass commented on the suspicious the longevity of the head on his
Miller Genuine Draft. I've got a batch of extract brew that leaves head on
the side of the glass 'til the next day (by which time it's dried out).
I added no heading agents, just amber extract (forgot what kind), Saaz hops,
water, and Whitbread Ale Yeast. Unless the extract had stuff in it that
wasn't on the lable, we can't conclude for sure that Miller is dicking around
with heading agents.

I think your proposed fermentation temperature is too low.  The wheat
beer yeast is an ale yeast, and should be fermented warm.  Personally,
I try to ferment my wheat beers above 70 degrees.  The warmer the
ferment (within reason), the more clovey esters you'll get.


Your recipe looks about right to me.  For a Bavarian Weizen you want
50-60% wheat malt.  Depending on your mash/sparge system, your beer may
come out a bit too strong with 10 lbs. of grain.  You might also think
about adding/substituting a little Munich malt for more maltiness and a
touch of color.


Definitely use the Wyeast wheat beer yeast.  It is the key to the clove
aroma.  If you can't get that, try Vierka lager yeast (dry).  When
fermented warm, it also produces a marked clove aroma.


At the end of fermentation, the Bavarians lager their Weizen beers for
at least 3 weeks below 40 degrees.  I have never tried *not* doing this,
so I don't know how important it is.


At last month's meeting of the Brews Brothers, a few of us had a mini
tasting of commercial (German) Weizen beers.  We were all struck by the
wide range of flavors among the various brands.  The Paulaner was
rather sweet and clovey, while the Spaten had a very strong sour/tangy
note to it.  (Of course, who knows how old these beers were and what
atrocities they'd been subjected to?)  I drank a Pinkus last night, and
it seemed somewhere in-between.  Personally, I go for sweet and
clovey.


Good luck!

The clove taste in Bavarian wheat beers comes from a compound called
4-vinyl guaiacol. It is produced by Saccharomyces Delbruckii, which is
the yeast strain used for wheat beers in Germany. American wheat beers
typically don't use a Delbruckii strain, and consequently don't have the
clove taste.


Wyeast #3056 is a mixed strain. It has both S. Cerevisiae and S. Delbruckii.
Like your friends, I found it produced no clove character. I'd suggest
trying MeV Lab's wheat beer yeast (#033). A friend used it recently with
very good results. His first batch was a standard weizen and had distinct
clovey tastes with very pronounced banana esters. He later pitched the
dregs from the first batch into a second. The second batch was a dunkel
wiezen. The banana esters were very strong and the clove taste diminished
substantially. I'm a little sketchy on the details of the fermentation,
so I don't know what's attributable to what. At any rate, they were both
good beers, and had more clove than any brew fermented with Wyeast that
I've encountered.


On Sunday I made a wheat beer using MeV #033 myself. Thusfar all I can say
is it's a slow starter. I pitched a 1.5 liter starter into 15 gallons
early Sunday evening, but there was still no activity late Monday night.
Have others out there found it to be a slow starter also???

The thinking of the Big Brewers seems to be something along the lines
of, "if you put it in and then took it out, it's as if you didn't
put it in".  This thinking is quite common on the cellaring end of
the process, where adsorbants like polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, silica
gel, or Bentonite are added and later filtered out.  My
understanding is that after the chemical treatment of the hops,
what's left is just the iso-alpha acids, so they don't really
need to mention the reagents or intermediate products ...
