Subject: Great advert...


Perusing the latest issue of Classic and Sportscar (a delightful issue, BTW), 
I ran across a great advert for Theakston.  It is a centerspread with nought 
but moody a photograph filling about eighty percent of the pages, and a hand
pump with Theakston badge and the words "Brewers in Masham, North Yorkshire 
since 1827. Best Bitter, XB and Old Peculier."


The photo is of some bags of hops with the brewery name on, and the brewer
tending a long feedpipe into a brewing square. The caption on the photo reads 
"The suppliers want this hop filter for their museum. We need it for our beer."


I think I just added a third brewery tour to my must list this September.


Cheers...Gary

Subject: New Book, Germany


Howdy All,
   I've got two major topics.  First is a new book called 
_The_Absolute_Beginners_Manual_on_Homebrewing_Beer_, or 'The Beer Book' for 
short.  It is written by my recently retired Base Commander, Col. Dave Vogl.  
He was Base Commander of Maxwell AFB, Al. since 1988, retired yesterday.
   
   Anyway, like the title says, this book is for BEGINNERS!!!.  It is perfect 
for that person who is still hesitant about starting homebrewing or may be 
slightly intimidated by Papazian or Miller. (I know I was; after first 
reading TCJoHB, then Miller's book, I wondered if I was going to have to drag 
out my college organic chem books :-) ).  The book deals exclusively with 
extract brewing, although he does mention the more advanced all-grain process 
(about 1 page worth).  There are sections on ingredients, equipment, soda 
pop, a couple of recipes (the Recipe for Fun is super...), and several good 
charts and conversion tables.  


   Again I stress that this is for beginners and those who are probabply 
worrying too much about getting started.  It would make a perfect gift for 
these types of people.  You can request a copy by writeing to:
   
              The Beer Book                 Price is $10.00 + $1.00
              329 Center Drive              for shipping and handling.
              Montgomery, Al.  36113


      - - - - - - - -- 


   On a totally unrelated note, I just received orders to Germany :-).
As a result, I will probably be putting my homebrewing on hold for about 4 
years.  If anyone has Norm Hardy's six(?) part posting on German beers and 
stuff, I would be most grateful for a copy.  I will be arriving there just in 
time for Bad Dierkeim (sp?) and then it will be off to OktoberFest.  I will 
think about y'all while I'm there.  Really... ;-).


   Thanks for all the info over the past year and the introduction to a 
wonderful pasttime.

Subject: Burton salts


I am planning on brewing a pale ale this weekend, and I was wondering if anyone
knows exactly what is in "Burton salts".  I hate putting mystery additives in 
my beer as much as I hate paying 40 cents for what might be just a tablespoon
of gypsum.  I've seen the water analysis for Burton-on-Trent in the back of
Papazian, but it only list a couple of ions.  I suspect there's more to it than
that.  Does anyone know what is in that stuff?

        No. The yeast in suspension do all the work; the ones
on the bottom just sort of lounge around (hey, what would
*you* do in a bathtub full of beer? 8<:^)

Personally, I would recommend NOT cutting the tube, unless you can
easily get a replacement.  I purchased a used (for homebrew) soda kegging
setup, and the previous owner had already cut the tube off.  By doing this,
there is always about 1 quart of beer wasted.  If you artificially
carbonate, there is no sediment, but there is wasted beer.  With primed kegs,
the first glass of beer pulls out most of the yeast anyway, so why cut?
Just be sure that is what you really want to do, because once you cut
it, you can't make it longer again without replacing it.


Since CO2 is cheaper than dextrose or malt, I always artificially
carbonate - plus I feel the beer has a slightly 'cleaner' taste than
when primed (less yeast in suspension?), and the beer is ready to drink
sooner.

From: zentner`at`ecn.purdue.edu (Michael Zentner)
Subject: Cholesterol...and who does what




I was going to stay clear of this discussion, but I feel like
I have to add to the following, from Jay Hersh:


>Tim I must be some kind of alien, cause I eat chocolate every day, and while I
>moderate my consumption of ice cream in recent years, I still eat it an average
>of 1-2 times per week, yet I have the lowest cholesterol of anyone I know (self
>satisfied smirk). I think a good exercise regiment, and otherwise reasonable
>diet help a bit.


with which I agree, except that it seems like everyone has overlooked
one thing.  Another important factor affecting your cholesterol
level is genetics.  Just because one guy can get away with eating
chocolate all the time does not mean another guy with exactly the same
excercise habits can get away with the same diet.  Also, it seems that
given you have high cholesterol, your potential for developing cholesterol
related diseases is also somewhat governed by genetics.  Maybe some of
the Med people on the list can comment on the validity of this.  I take
it as an extrapolation from statistics on smokers, where not every chain
smoker develops lung cancer.


And then there's the happiness factor.  It just seems that people who are
never happy tend to age rapidly.  You can be afraid of ingesting/inhaling/
coming in contact with everything around you for one reason or another.
Maybe it's just me, but if I can't do some of the things that "aren't
good for me", I'd likely not have much fun, and not be very happy either.
Ultimately, beer is not good for you.  You can get all the good stuff from
beer (vitamins,proteins, etc...) by ingesting malt/yeast/hops in other
forms which would probably be healthier than beer, but there's the beer
enjoyment factor.  I guess my point is, sure, excercise and eat sensibly,
but obsessing on "clean living" can't be good for most people...so once
in a while, eat that steak and have the chocolate pie.  I'd rather trade
the enjoyment for the few extra years.

Subject: homegrown hops alpha% ???


Many of my homebrewing cohorts grow their own hops as our Pacific Northwest
climate makes this an easy horticultural challenge. I have gotten as much
as 5 lbs. (dried weight!) of hops from 2 prolific Hallertaur and Northern
Brewer vines in my yard.


The question that often comes up, is whether there is any way for the home
hopgrower to measure, or even crudely estimate,  the alpha% of our homegrown
cones? 


At present, most of us just guess using the lower end of the published range
for the strain that we "believe" was the source of our original rhizomes.
But since some of these vigorous vines are of questionable heritage we'd like
something a little better.


Any suggestions?

Subject: Hop Bags & Scott Yeest


I was talking with a fellow brewer last night and he mentioned using a muslin
bag to keep his hops in during the boil. I got to thinking about this and was
wondering what effect this would have on extraction rates with regards to
bitterness. I was under the impression that the mechanical action of the boil
was necessary to optimize extraction of alpha acids in the hops. Wouldn't the
bag interfere with this? I would be most curious to see this discussed.
Same person mentioned using a new (to me anyway) brand fo ale yeast made by
Scott (sp?). It is supposed to be a *very* clean fermenter that produces a 
minimum of fermentation by-products. From what it sounds like, this would be
ideal for summer brewing condition (for those of us without refrigerator space).
Has anyone out there used this stuff? Care to comment?

     I've got a copy of Great Fermentations of Santa Rosa's 1991 catalog
(they're just a couple of miles from me), and the only mill that I can
find listed is the "Corona Grain Mill" ($49.95).  Do you have the
catalog for "Great Fermentations of Marin"?


     Also, if you crush your own grain, do it far away from where you
boil the wort, bottle, etc..  The grain husks contain acetic acid
bacteria (or is it lactic acid bacteria?), and you may not want to take
the chance of contamination via grain dust in the air.

     Actually, a "bag o'beer" is what got me started in homebrewing.
Someone gave me one as a present, and it turned out OK, although very
flat (even by British standards).  It did, however, have a slightly tart
taste that increased with time (read: probable acetic acid bacteria
contamination).  You are probably right in saying that the produced beer
is "not good".


     However, I suspect that all of the books/kits/recipes that call for
half malt/half cane sugar are doing a larger disservice.  I've seen bad
recipes, etc. a lot more often than I've seen brew bags (I've only seen
the brew bags carried in only one store).
