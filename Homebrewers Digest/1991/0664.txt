Subject: lambic tasting


I had the pleasure of attending the Belgium lambic (and similar beer) tasting 
at the AHA conference last night.  I'm too ignorant of the style to post any
kind of in-depth beer review; I'll leave that to someone who took notes (you
know who you are).  Of course ignorance won't stop me from saying *something*
about it.  


There were maybe 25 people in attendance, four people to each bottle, which 
gave each of us a good portion. We sampled geuze (sp?), kriek, frambroise, 
Belgium brown ales, and some homebrewed lambic-style beer.  An educated 
and interested group of tasters made for a very enjoyable and informative 
session.  The homebrews were very good, some were extremely close to the 
real thing. I never thought I would hear a homebrew *praised* for having 
a "horse-blanket" aroma!  


Kudos to Mike Sharp for organizing the tasting and to Dan Hall (BFD!) for
helping out. 


My one taste observation is a unique sensation I noticed as I was driving 
home: my mouth felt extremely clean, as opposed to the way it can feel after 
a night of drinking "normal" beer.  I would guess this is because the acidity 
of the lambics cuts through the residual sugar that would normally be left on 
your teeth.  I can still feel the effect today!  Belgium mouthwash!?

I bottled a batch of brown ale last night and as usual I was only
able to fill the last bottle half way with beer.  I remember
reading that one should never cap a half filled bottle since it is
likely to explode.  Thus I drank a couple swigs and throw the rest
away:-(.


My housemates and I were not able to come up with a good
explanation for why a capped half bottle of beer is a dangerous
thing.  So I ask, why is a half full bottle of beer more likely to
explode than an almost full one?  What about almost empty bottles?
What about completely full ones? 


I apologize if these are totally mundane questions.

Subject: Corn


        Has anybody ever used corn starch in brewing?  Papazian says that corn
starch can be added directly into the boil, without any sort of pre-cooking.  Weare trying some lighter-bodied beers and it seems that corn starch would be a
cheap substitute for corn sugar.
        A possibly unrelated note on cider making: it seems that the addition
of some acid blend to the mix allows for a much greater amount of sugar to be
put in, while maintaining proper "tartness" (as opposed to "dryness").

I need not limited my excursions to Vienna, just the general vicinity including

It seems that rabbits like hops.


Sometime yesterday the local rabbits got to my hop plants.
The Hallertaur is now 4 inches high, and the Bullion and 
Cascade are missing leaves from about 4" to 18" off the 
ground. The Saaz wasn't touched. When I get home tonight, 
I'm fencing in whatever's left.


Hmm..."Saaz, the anti-bunny hop"


Y'know, I'm kinda surprised that noone has marketed a hops
bag with the name "The Hop Sock". Or maybe I just missed it.

Subject: Straining pellet hops


I used to use only flower hops for my brews.  I could run the wort through a
hopback and get it crystal clear before pitching (i.e. no trub).  But I have
recently switched to pellets, and the old hopback technique doesn`t work.
How do you filter out all the hops from the wort without having to wait
hours for the tiny bits to settle out?

Subject:     more on mashing


As a newer masher, I'm still in the process of getting my process smoothed
out, but I have some comments regarding Jim's mashing vs extract that haven't
come up yet.


The bottom line, in my opinion, is to do it. Trying mashing can be cheap, fun,
and enlightening. Your contribution is time and patience.


On Quality: I've noticed better CONTROL of my beer. By chooosing mashing
 temperature, you can cause your finished beer to be sweeter (hotter mash) or
 less sweet (cooler mash). The place that made your extract had to make this
 choice when they mashed for their extract. Their choice, not yours, and since a
 hotter (sweeter) mash is quicker, economics may push the extract makers this
 way. Controlling the temperature is easy with the correct, cheap equipment.


On time: Plan a full day for your first brew. For my full mashes, I start early
 on a Sunday, get the mash started and read the paper while it works. My
 personal time breakdown for beginners would look like this:


  Crushing the grains - don't, buy pre crushed. As a beginner this not the best
                        way to start the day.
  45 minutes - getting the mash water hot
  10 minutes - getting the grains and mash water mixed (Mash-in)
  30 minutes - protein rest/ph adjust. A cool temperature rest. I believe this
               is good for beginners even if it's not needed because it gives
               you a chance to work with the mash, see the volume, use the
               thermometer, etc. This will be good practice when it comes time
               to raise the mash to starch conversion temperature, etc. Also,
               play with those damn ph papers for a while, then throw them away
               when you can't make them work and hope everything will be okay as
               is and don't sweat it. Beer was invented before ph was.
 15 minutes - raising mash to starch conversion temperature. For the beginner,
              shoot for the middle of the mashing range (63C 145F) and take
              anything close (58-67C 136-152). Don't sweat it. The only danger
              is overheating.
 2 hours - starch conversion. Depending on your temperature this can actually
              take anywhere from 15 minutes (hot mash/sweet beer) to 2 hours
              (cool mash/dry beer). During most of this time you are reading the
              paper. Do the iodine test often to see what the hell it's all
              about, not just when you think the mash is done. I usually do it
              the first time during the protein rest just to reassure myself
              I know what I'm doing. If you are doing a low temperature mash you
              may get bored after an hour and decide to raise the temperature
              some more to speed things up. WOW, now you're doing a two step
              mash.
30 minutes - raise temperature to 75C (167) to kill enzymes and stop the mash.
90 minutes - sparge. The first 45 minutes are spent recycling the wort (remember
             to keep it hot) and worrying about why it won't clear, the next 45
             minutes are spent rinsing the grains with hot clear water. If the
             sparge stops running, don't stir it, stab it with a knife to get
             the sparge water down into the grain bed. Expect low yield, about
             25SG points per pound per gallon.
120 minutes - boiling the wort. It might not really take this long, depending on
             how much sparge water you used. I advise stopping the sparge early
             to keep the blood pressure down. You'll know what I mean when you
             sparge the first time.
60 minutes - cooling the wort in the sink (in the pot, of course).
15 minutes - racking into the carboy, leaving the hops behind.




That it, and all in less than 9 hours. Not bad for the beginner.




On Equipment: You need a big enough pot (not necessarily 10 gallons). I use one
 of those enammeled pot. I think about 3-4 gallons will do for the beginner.
 (when the pot is full, the sparge is over!).


 For a grain strainer (only advanced brewers need to call it a lauter tun)
 you can get by with one of those steamers or make a two bucket version. I
 I built (read "drilled") my first 2 bucket thing while my first mash was
 converting. I think I spent about $10 for 2 buckets and a spigot.


 You can mash in your boiling pot, with the pot in an oven on low,but I think
 it's easier to use a picnic cooler. I'll assume that everyone has a picnic
 cooler of some kind. Wash the cooler (no need to sanitize, you'll be boiling
 everything later) and throw in the dry grains. Add the mash water and you're
 done. When it comes time to raise the mash temperature, it all comes out and
 goes back into the pot on hte stove, then back into the cooler. I'd say any
 picnic cooler will do, but I use one of those 3 gallon Gott water jugs. If you
 go with one of these, it can be the outer bucket of your strainer and it has
 a built in spigot. It also keeps your grain bed hot during the sparge, which
 is a very good thing.


Well, I think I've stretched this out as long as I can.


GO FOR IT!

Howdy, Oran!  What he might be referring to is Lallemand yeast,
now being distributed by a company named Scott.  It's dry yeast, sold 
in bulk to the brewpub/microbrewery industry, and it is indeed clean 
and predictable, and not particularly attenuative.  I recently had
tastes of two otherwise-identical batches, one fermented with
Lallemand and the other with reused Sierra Nevada ale yeast.  The
difference was amazing, and most felt in Sierra Nevada's favor. 
Nevertheless, one of my first orders of business when I get back
from vacation is to make up a pale ale, fermented with the small
stock of Lallemand I've been hoarding since March, and dry-hopped
with Chinooks.

One way to find out what ingreddients they use is to contact the nearest
brewery of the beer in question.  I have found that the brewers use corn,
rice, and whatever else.  The magic words to look for are "cereal grains."
This usually indicates (IMHO) that the brewer is using rice or corn.  They
use these items to stretch the malt grains thus using the same amount of
the more expensive grains and making more beer.  The problem is if the 
drinker has a problem with the other grains. Example: my friend is 
allergic to corn and cannot drink most beers because of that. So, he
is constantly looking at the ingredient list for those magic words.

In response to Laura's request for info on LA brewpubs:
   When I moved down here four long years ago to attend grad school
there were exactly zero brewpubs in the LA area.  Pretty depressing
having moved here from Seattle.
   Well things aren't quite so bad for anyone traveling to Southern
California today, but not great either.  I don't know of anything in
the Anaheim/Garden Grove area in particular, but here are the options I
am familar with:


      Gorky's:  faux-Russian food and beer joint in two locations,
                Downtown LA, in amongst the warehouses, E.8th Street
                and about Maple Street (can't miss it) and Hollywood,
                just North Hollywood Blvd. on Cahuenga Blvd. Pretty good
                "Red" Ale.


      Eureka:  very, very trendy Wolfgang Puck restaurant and brewery.
               Very large, very metallic, and very pretentious.  The
               unfiltered-pilsner is however a nice Czech-styled
               beer.  Located at 1845 S. Bundy Drive in West LA.  Find
               this location then go around the block, the entrance is
               on the other side.


      Alpine Village:  a strange sort collection of things German in
               the middle of nowhere (Carson).  Location of the
               Oktoberfest celebration in LA.  They brew beer all year
               but I am not sure where it is available past their
               two month long Oktoberfest, perhaps in the restaurant.
               I drink it at a local, Santa Monica, pub.  It's located
               just off the Harbor Freeway (110) at Torrence Blvd. in
               Carson.


There's also a place in Pasadena called something like The Rose and
Thissle(?) which I haven't been to.  Hope you enjoy your vist.  Also,
I hope another posting lists brewpubs I don't yet know of.

Gooday


A few tips and comments:


Dave Line mentions 'torrefied barley' as contributing to loose mashes and
easier sparging, while contributing a slight grainy taste. It's really
just barley (unmalted) that's been popped like popcorn. I made some once
in a microwave which gives clean heat without toasting the grains. The
barley had to be on a glass or ceramic plate as the plastic u-wave proof
bowl I tried came out with grain melted into its base. It took 8 - 10 mins
before most of the grain had popped. At the time I only had dried yeast so
poor yeast performance masked any finer flavours. It may be worth a try if
your mashes run too slow, and with the better yeast cultures available today.


Does everyone know the fastest way to empty a bottle? I don't mean to stick
a straw in it! I mean when you're washing dozens of bottles for your next
batch. It was demonstrated many years ago by Professor Julius Sumner Miller
on 'Why Is It So'. He had two flagons (~4.5litre) full of water, one he gave
to his stooge, the other he held. On the signal the stooge started pouring
and shaking the flagon; Prof JSM held his neck down and gave it a swirl - the
water whirlpooled out the neck and emptied in much less time. I've always
swirled water out of bottles since - it's fun just to watch it work - and to
think how much sooner you'll be emptying bottles of brew into a glass!


As a fuzz-faced home brewer, what is it about not shaving in the morning
that makes a bloke want to brew beer? Anyone any ideas?....  Eh  Charlie?


And a similarly demographic question - most homebrewers who read HBD are
computer literate and have technical abilities. We have access (a privilege
I feel) to this fast, worldwide network on which we piggyback our homebrew
discussions. I'm just wondering if brewers with net access are different
or better than those without? I recall the atmosphere of ignorance that I
laboured in when I started, compared to the immediate information available
in HBD and via email. Has this been discussed before? Could it be the subject
of a future editorial by Charlie P.?


Some day some unique styles may evolve:-  Bit-Bucket-Bock? Klages-Kluge-Ale?
Megabyte-Memory-Malt-Liquor? Program-Counter-Porter? Stack-Overflow-Stout?


Bye now
