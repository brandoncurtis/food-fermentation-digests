Hi -


Even though I live twenty minutes from the venue, schedules permitted me only
Thursday night (Club Night) at the National Conference.  What a blast!  A
buffet dinner (with beer available of course) gave me a chance to meet with
several nice folks from Michigan and my home club.  The remainder of the
evening was spent roaming a large room full of people and tables - both
somewhat full of homebrew 8')  The brews were generally excellent, as was the
camaraderie.  I met many of the "legends of homebrewing", who were all very
friendly and approachable - just folks.  Just plain fun.


I would heartily recommend the experience.  In fact, I probably will go to one
sometime - all of it - even though it will be much further away.


Cheers...Gary

Subject:  Half-Full Bottles


Over the few years that I have been brewing, I have heard many stories about
how a large headspace turns into an exploding bottle.  The most outlandish
one is that yeast is inhibited by pressure generated during conditioning, and
if the headspace is short, the yeast dies out faster, hence less carbonation.
More headspace, yeast carbonates longer.  I don't buy it!  This version
assumes (I believe, incorrectly) that there is "too much" priming sugar at
bottling time, and you are just counting on the yeast to die off just in time.


The way I think it happens is based on simple stoichiometry of biochemical
pathways.  When a molecule of glucose (or any other monosaccharide) is
metabolized in the absence of oxygen, two (2) molecules of CO2 are produced.
When the same molecule is metabolized in the PRESENCE of O2, as in early
fermentation (bad use of that word, sorry), SIX, count 'em, six molecules
of CO2.
When you bottle with almost no headspace, there is almost no O2, and so
every sugar molecule makes only 2 molecules of CO2.  However, when you have
a large headspace, there is lots of oxygen in the bottle, which is used to
make way too much CO2.  The other danger is that air compresses, and
compressed air propels glass around the room or wherever the bottle is when
the glass fails.  Beer doesn't compress, so when glass fails with no head-
space, it just goes "crik", and kind of runs onto the floor.
These messages are just too damned long, and I need a beer.

Subject: Stainless Equipment Questions




Greetings !


I have two questions concerning stainless steel 
equipment which is used by home brewers.




First, I saw an ad in Zymurgy from an outfit
in Seattle that makes 15.5 gallon brewing kettles
from SS kegs.  They advertise a price of $65 for 
these.  I've also heard mention from several here
about their own keg kettles.


As I've never torn up a keg to see the internals,
I wonder at what is involved.  I have more that
the normal complement of tools (incl oxy-act torch
and high speed grinders), but know from personal
experience that stainless steel is difficult to work.


I'd like to hear comments from folks who have trod 
this path before me.




Second, I moved from bottles to kegs rather  quickly
and now have a small collection of used pin-type
connector 5 gal kegs.  I am experiencing a problem
with rust in these kegs, something that I did not 
think could happen.  After cleaning a keg and before
use (sometimes up to 2 weeks), I stored the keg full 
of sanitizing solution (bleach and water).  Now I am 
experiencing something that sure looks like rust on 
the inside of the rounded top part of the keg.  One 
other keg appears to have a small "spot" of rust down
on the rounded bottom paer (again, inside the keg).


The sides appear to be stainless, the top and bottom 
are not so obvious.  I'm not a metallurgist, but have 
delt with more than my fair share of stainless.  Neither
of these kegs was manufactured by Corneilus; one is 
Firestone, and one is Tote Systems.


Is this a fatal problem in a keg ?  Would it do the same 
with beer in the keg  (given the acidic nature of beer) ?
Can it be *fixed* ?  Should it be fixed, or should the 
units be retired ?  I'd like to hear of others 
experiences along these lines.


BTW, I am relatively new to the digest, and would like to
say that this has been a useful group for me.  Please keep
the signal to noise ratio high.

Subject: all-grain oktoberfest bier recipe wanted


Greetings everone,


I'd like to get an all-grain recipe for an oktoberfest beer so I can go 
ahead and get started with it and hopefully have some for this fall. I'd 
prefer a simple infusion mash recipe, but it isn't necessary. BTW, WRT the 
cost issue of all-grain brewing, that is exactly why I want an all-grain 
recipe. I can get 10 lbs. of grain for about 10 dollars. A can of Irek's 
extract from my local supplier (admittedly very poor) is 25$! Thanks in 
advance...

Here's my understanding of the Mechanics of Carbonation:


If a bottle has too much headspace (the space between the beer and the
cap), the CO2 will all end up in the headspace.  This means that the
partial pressure of the CO2 will not be great enough to force the CO2
to remain dissolved in the beer.  Result:  flat beer.


If a bottle has too little headspace, too much of the CO2 will remain
in the beer (here's where I get a little hazy) somehow shutting down
the yeast's production of CO2.  Result:  flat beer.


(I know that last bit sounds counterintuitive, but I'm sure I read it
in TCHoHB.)


Miller et.al. claim that the best fill level is 0.5-1.0 inches of
headspace.


If anyone has better information, please pass it along...I was trying
to explain this to a friend just yesterday.


have fun

Subject: King Kooker, Rye malt


In the Summer '91 issue of Zymurgy there is a review of the King Kooker.
Basically, it is a 125,000 BTU jet cooker and is very sturdy.  Several
mail order houses stock the item for sale to us brewers. I have wanted
to get one for when I upgrade my brewery from partial mashes to full
mashes.  Anyway, I called the company, Metal Fusion Inc. in Louisianna
(504) 469-6431 to find a local distributor (NJ), but they said they didn't
know of one.  They didn't check or anything, but they didn't know one
off the top of their head.  They did offer to ship me one direct, however.
So, for $49.99 ($40.00 for unit, $6.24 shipping, and $3.75 COD (no charges,
I could have sent a check, but that was another delay)), they are shipping
a unit to me.  This is the same unit that Alternative Beverage charges
$56.95 for, before shipping and handling (Winter 1990 catalog).  It comes
with a baffle to divert the flame (no hot spots).  AB sells the non-baffle
model for 48.95.  Metal Fusion has dealt with brewers before.  They knew
what one to suggest when I mentioned the intended use.


Also in the Summer Zymurgy was an ad for a place that offered malted rye
for a dollar something a pound.  With the recent discussion on rye, I'm
suprised no one has mentioned it.  My issue is home, so if anyone needs
the number email me and I'll post it.

I second your sadness.  Hopefully, the increasing popularity of beers
with flavor, brewed abroad as well as at our fine U.S. micro-breweries,
will increase their availability.  It has already made a mark on the
north side of Chicago, where you can find much better beers on tap and
beers like Sierra Nevada, Sam Smith's, Fuller's, and Pilsner Urquell
in bottles at many bars.  Last Saturday, I went on a midnight cruise
on one of the big commercial yachts: Old Style and Miller (I think)
on tap and Bud and Bud Light in bottles.  That's it.  I had club soda.
It's cheaper and to me, tastes the same.


Now on to my point.  On the topic of U.S. beers tasting the same everywhere,
I'd like to add another data point.  I had Miller and another U.S. beer in
Canada two years ago.  Definately *not* the same flavor!  I thought they
weren't bad at all.  They actually had flavor.  Has anyone had a similar
experience?  By the way, try Labatt's from Canada and Labatt's purchased
here side-by-side.  Another big difference!

I recommend the Schneiderweisskeller on Marienplatz. Try their weissbier
and especially the Aventinus weizenbock. Ummm... I also very much enjoyed
their brotsuppe (bread soup).


Fairly recently opened is the Paulaner Brauhaus, a brewpub serving an
*unfiltered* Helles, which had a bit more zing to it than the usual
Munchener Helles, and a real fine Weissbier. It's at Kapuzinerplatz, a little
outside of the altstadt, near the Goetheplatz U-bahn station.


I also braved the Hofbrauhaus to try their Maibock: excellent bock -- worth
the trouble if they have it. Stay away from the tourists; sit at a table
with the Bavarians.


I'm sure others will urge you to go to Andechs, so I won't bother here... :-)


Hit any and all of the biergartens -- they should be lovely this time of

Subject: All Grain vs Extracts - Long.




The following is a summary of the many responses that I received to my
posting regarding, All Grain Brewing (HBD #658). I'd like to thank all
the respondees, both those who sent me mail, and those that follwed up to the
HBD. I am resolved to attempt an all grain brew this fall/winter.




During the course of this summarization I will be using quotes and paraphrasing
w/o necessarily crediting the source. If this offends, then I can send (upon
request) my complete file of responses, and those interested can find the
sources. I apologize in advance for this lack of credit, but in this informal
forum, it seems unnecessary.




Questions and responses:




> Is the final brew, in general, superior to an extract brew? Is so, why?




Responses ranged from , 'yeah, I think so' to being a 'matter of deep
religious conviction'.


Generally speaking, respondees enthusiastically supported grain brewing over
extracts. The brew resultant for and all grain mash can be described as:


 - More complex
 - More body, aroma
 - Better head retention
 - Full of malt tastes and character.
 - No off flavors associated with extracts.
 - Less harshness.




Flavor, however, may not be the reason why all grain brewers do all grain
brewing. Many brewers simply like the control, and feeling of 'really'
brewing your own. These's also the risk! Some (paraphrased) responses....


'Mashing puts you  in intimate contact with the part of brewing the extract
 brewer has hired someone else to do... Fascinating and intensely satisfying..
 ..Seeing the mash convert is almost magical.'


'... it's the way to make better beer....it gives you complete control over
 the ingredients...'


'..you can control... the variety of malts....strike temperatures....mashing
 methodology..... amounts and kinds of sugars present. Skillful manipulation
 of these variables can result in an exquisite product..... Sloppy
 manipulation can result in junk...'




However, some theorized that the higher quality is attributable to factors
other than grain.


'... notice that nearly 1/2 of the recipes in the Winners Circle are extract
 based...'


'... the reason people get better results from.. grain..than extract... is
 because they take more care...'


'..whether it's the grain.... or the increase in experience and concentration..
 .. I cannot say...'








>  What kind of time commitment are we talking about to wort creation?






Most everybody said, 'All day'. Here are some samples.




'.... I enjoy the process, so it's not surprising that I make it last all day'.




' I basically commit and entire weekend to brewing a batch of all-grain beer.'




'A mashed wort takes about 1 day to prepare......(but) you don't take a
 solid day..... there are several long periods where the brew takes care
 of itself.'




' ... I started at 7 am and put it in the carboy at 4 pm.'




One helpful response broke down each step and they added up to 8h 45m.




> How much water is used? Does it need conditioning.






Not exactly sure why I asked this question, as (in Maine) there's almost as
much water as there is winter. In any event noone seemed particularly
concerned about it. Most condition the water, but state one should do this
even with extract brews.




Here goes;




' ...only increase is cleaning.... the lauter tun. Required conditioning may
 be less..... some PH and mineral adjustment is usually reqired, but
 not cumbersome.'




'You do have to be a little careful about the pH of the mash.'




'About 1/4-1/3 more (water is used).... Always condition, even for extract
 brews'


'I do full wort boils with my extracts and always condition the water.


'Big additional water use is for chilling..... I fill my bathtub w/ water
 ... and put my kettle in it...... I then bucket water to the yard.... water
 plants.....'


'.... get the pH down to a mashable level......otherwise you lose efficiency.'






> How about the $$ investment in equipment?






This started a bit of tongue-in-cheek dialogue re: whether or not we should
be worrying about the cost of a hobby.




Enamel steel canning kettle          -    $ 30
Lauter-tun (Zapap)                   -      10
Wort chiller                         -      25   Homemade from Cu tubing and
                                                 fittings.


Buy the grain pre-crushed, was one pretty good idea. I also liked the idea
of the bathtub wort chiller.




> Is the final cost per bottle less, or more?




'Less if you consider only materials..... factor in equipment and it'll be
 more. Isn't the purpose of a hobby to spend w/o guilt.'




'Worrying about the dollar value of time spent on a hobby causes ulcers'




'It works out about the same.'


'So what?'


'50 % savings (over extracts).'




'Grain CAN be cheaper than extracts, providing you can get a price break on
 the ingredients.'








There you go ! Some late (today) responses may not be included. Is there
anything else left to say? Thanx again.

Subject: re Half filled bottles


   Where did you hear that half-filled bottles are dangerous? Homebrewing
is still built up out of lore as much as certain knowledge, so there's a
lot of misinformation wandering around---you have to pay attention to
sources and ignore random rumors. I can't draw a precise curve of pressure
vs time, but I would be very surprised if the peak pressure in a
partly-filled bottle were higher than in a full bottle.
    wrt filling, I've started following Miller's advice to leave only ~.5"
headspace to minimize oxidation (by leaving less O2 in the bottle). He also
suggests laying the caps on the bottles (for cleanliness) but not crimping
for a while so the first bit of CO2 will flush out the air in the
headspace. This sounds like another lore-based idea; a quick calculation:


  .75 cup corn sugar x .4#/cup x 454 gm/# / 180gm/mole  = .7567 moles
    x 2 (molecules CO2 released for every molecule of sugar )
    x 22.4 (liters/mole at 273K)
    x 293/273 (crxn to room temp---293K=20C)
    / 50 bottles (guesstimate of 5 gallon batch)
    = .728 l C02/bottle
    / ~3 days to ]carbonate[


= 10 ml/hour average, so a headspace of a few ml could be flushed out
quickly---IFF the yeast starts chewing up the corn sugar at full speed
immediately instead of needing time to multiply. Any guesses on this one?
   These numbers also say that a half-bottle should generate 364ml of CO2;
that's just about 12 volume ounces, so if none of the CO2 dissolved before
it was all generated (not likely), you'd get about 2 atmospheres, ~29 psi,
in the 6-ounce headspace of a half bottle. That's not a lot of pressure
in a reusable bottle; you're more likely to get flat beer because there's
not enough pressure to persuade all of the C02 to dissolve.
   It's nice to know enough biochemistry to follow just what the yeasts are
doing, but you can get a lot of useful estimates about the rest of brewing
just from knowing a little chemistry and/or physics. (Note that the above
figures wouldn't be approved by a strict instructor; the figure of .4#/cup
is imprecise enough that the answer shouldn't have more than one
significant figure, but we'd still find something on the close order of the
above results.)

  It's surprising how often this L.A. brewpubs request gets passed around

Don't have the time right now, so I'll just add a couple of notes to Mark

  He already mentioned Gorky's and Eureka.

  This is the Crown City Brewery, near the corner of Del Mar and Fair Oaks
in Pasadena.  Worth checking out, although the beers are good but variable.
I don't know of any Rose and Thistle, but I'll be back there for 4th of July,
so I'll see if there's a new pub.  Also check out the Loch Ness Monster Pub
(N. Fair Oaks, check the Yellow Pages) and the John Bull (S. Fair Oaks,
across the street from Gerlach's Liquors), both decent pubs with tasty beers
on tap.

I e-mailed this off yesterday to the unnamed inquirer of la area
brewpubs but since there seems to be others interested.......


The closest brewpubs to Anaheim are in Fullerton near the CSUFullerton
campus (forget the name, never been there) and Belmont Brewing in Long
Beach. Mediocre beer, bland atmosphere. Other LA area brewpubs
include, Alpine Village Hofbrau in Torrance, good German style lagers 
and good German food in the Alpine Village restaurant.
Gorky's in downtown LA, various ales of various qualities, fun
atmosphere, lousy neighborhood (the Hollywood location doesn't
actually brew on the premisis and the people are alot snottier). Eureka
in West LA (Wolfgang Pucks place), ultra chee chee but fun to see the
place. Supposedly Wolfman spent over ten mil just to build the place.
Only one style of lager on tap but filtered and unfiltered. Good
stuff. Supposedly brewing a dark soon. Crown City in Pasadena, never
been there but I've heard good things. Angeles Brewing in I think
Chatsworth? Again I've never been there but they do brew the Rhino
Chasers amber which is available localy in six packs. Pretty decent
stuff. If you are heading south out of LA, try heritage brewing in
Dana Point, good beer in a nice beach town. Manhattan Beach brewing is
supposed to be opening up soon too.
   Try to pick up a California Celebrator free "brewspaper" as it has
a complete list of all California breweries and their ph #s and addresses.

ps. try picking up a celebrator at the beverage warehouse in Culver
City at Culver Blvd. and McConnell. They have a very good selection of
domestic micros and interesting imports albeit stored in the warm LA
air under the fluorescents.
pps. almost forgot. I heard a Gorky's add last night on the radio
mentioning $1 16 oz. ales from around 6pm till midnite. mon-thu.

I seem to have started something with my question about additive to Miller GD.
Let me point something out:


1.  The label proudly claims:  No additives or preservatives.
2.  There is no ingredient list -- there is a statement that the beer
contains barley malt, yeast, hops, and water -- but doens't say whether
or not those are the ONLY ingredients.


So -- anything we might call an additive, MIller Brewing can call an
ingredient.  Brilliant eh?  "Oh, that 30% corn syrup in the recipe?  Well,
in these parts we call that an INGREDIENT -- it ain't no additive!"

If worse comes to worse, you could always try the California Pizza
Kitchen at the Mirage.  They serve bottles of Anchor Steam, Dos Equis, 
Guiness and others.

Periodicals?  What can be more periodical than our daily HB Digest? But if
you want it on a monthly basis, just don't read them until the end of the
month.


Seriously now:  You can try Zymurgy (the last word of the dictionary).

        Hi,
                One of the local retailers[Canadian Tire for those of you
local to Toronto] has a hunter programmable thermostat for room air
conditioners. Is this the unit that has been much talked about here?
Or is there one for fridges in particular? BTW the sale price is C$ 44.99.
        
                Thanks
                        Nick

Subject: Quite the conference


Greetings and salutations, all....


Just returned from NH and the AHA conference, first one I ever attended, and 
let me tell you, good times were had by all.  The seminars and speakers and
banquets were fine, but best of all were meeting all the homebrewers from
around the U.S. and Canada.  I sure hope you can make it to one someday, as
it really is an awesome experience.


Among the highlights of note to readers of this digest.....Mike Sharp really
outdid himself with the lambic tasting.  I am slow to develop a taste for this
style, but I did enjoy sampling commercial and homemade varieties.  Even
Charlie P. brews the stuff (and should keep working at it).  Martin Lodahl 
supplied Mike with a photo album of the Cantillon (sp?) brewery in Belgium.  
Russ Gelinas, who was in my "quartet" with Pete Soper and Dwight Beebe, said 
it all last week, but it's worth repeating anyhow.  Thanks, Mike!


Kinney Baughman is quite the party animal, and was easily the tallest person at
the conference.  This has to change; rumor has it that Manute Bol has a great 
recipe for Sudanese beer, if only we can get him to brew it.  Kinney went up 
to the Vermont Pub and Brewery to brew with Greg "Extracellular Slime" Noonan 
on Saturday;  perhaps he could post what he brewed and how it went??  


Of course, the funniest moment was when we (Tom Strasser and myself) saw 
the HBD's own Darryl Richman eating breakfast with Charlie Papazian on Wednes-
day morning.  To give you an idea of the sacred importance of this Digest 
as compared to the American Homebrewers Association, we marched straight up to
their table and said "Aren't you Darryl Richman?" and proceeded to introduce
ourselves to Darryl, talk about random brewing stuff and the Digest, and other-
wise completely blow off old C.P.  Well, sure, we finally got around to intro-
ducing ourselves to the "Big Cheese" himself, who is indeed a nice guy in his 
own right (and deserving of far better company than us, as is Darryl), but ya 
know, sometimes you just have to seize the moment.  


Carpe diem, dudes!
