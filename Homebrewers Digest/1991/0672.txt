Well, what you really get is improving the ratio of "good stuff"
(i.e., malt) to "bad stuff" (i.e., sugar).  By eliminating the
sugar from your recipe, you get a more full-bodied and better
tasting brew (IMHO) (certainly it will be "maltier" :-) ).


Yes, you can brew a 2.5 to 3 gallon batch with one can.  In fact,
that kind of approach is now showing up on the kit directions.
The latest _zymurgy_ had a review of a kit designed for 3 gallons
that said just use the can and don't add any sugar.  Good going,
I say.  The fewer kits that advocate using sugar the better.

Well,
  It is worth a minor note here that there is a *big* difference (IMHO)
between using a "kit" and using malt extract.  A "kit" is usually
in a can and is formulated to make a certain type of beer, often
containing the hops as well.
  Many of us who brew with extract only buy light malt extract
and add additional grains to achieve the pale ale, stout,
whatever.  I can heartily recommend this method and haven't
bought a "kit" in over a year.  But it does make it more
important to condition your water, though all I have ever used is
gypsum.

First, Brian Bliss replies to someone else:

If you ftp'd the files with binary set and they uncompressed,
the reason you're getting a U instead of ' is not because of
the ftp link.  You do not have to uuencode something to use
ftp.  As one of the authors explained to me, he had a similar
problem because of the printer connection to his computer not
supporting the "higher" bits, or something like that.  The
character ' is not represented in ascii in the postscript file.
Apparently, the printer is only getting part of the information.


If you're as dumb as me :-) and tried to vi the file to put
a manual feed instruction (it looked like the "book" was formatted
for printing out on two sided pages) in there and then wrote the file, 
you'll also find that vi strips non-ascii characters and
replaces ' with U.  I have fixed this problem and gotten it to
print out two sided, though, for anyone interested and willing
to sit next to the printer feeding in pages.

Lynn (my wife) and I are going to be travelling to Europe this
fall (post-Oktoberfest) and would like any suggestions on brew
related and/or other fun things to do.  The intended route is 
something like the following:
Barcelona for 4 days
Through France quickly, maybe 2 days with a stop in a wine area
Belgium 4-7 days
Southern Germany area for 1-1.5 weeks.


Please send any suggestions on Breweries, pubs, places to stay, 
unique restaurants, tourist attractions, etc... that any of you
are familiar with.  Thanks for any advice to anyone who can
provide it.

Wait Rob, don't go away just yet, you can't post something so long and
informative on Canadian beers and then go away without answering a few
follow-up questions.


Specifically when you quote alcohol contents, are you doign it by Volume (what
the rest of the world uses) or by Weight (what we fools in the US use). When
you call something a mind numbing 5% (assuming it's by volume) that's the
equivalent of ~4.2% which is not very different from many US beers. Of course
if you've already adjusted to US for the sake of the posting and just forgot to
mention it, then to quote Emily Latella, "Oh never mind...."

It's true. Many of the prepared fruit juices say "100% natural", and,
if you read the fine print, "10% fruit juice". As I understand it, one
could sell sawdust and call it 100% natural, so that phrase is exquisitely
meaningless. High fructose corn syrup is not a "naturally" occuring
substance to my knowledge.


A little more "truth in advertising" would be wonderful,
including listing of ingredients on ALL products intended for human con-
sumption. (And animal consumption for that matter!)

Subject: Peristaltic pumps


Has anyone considered using a peristaltic pump to move their worts between
containers during chilling, racking, and bottling?  These simple pumps are used
in medical applications like heart-lung machines because of their gentle action.
It would be nice not to have to raise and lower heavy containers full of wort,
and perhaps do away altogether with the frustrations of siphoning.


What say?

I was at the Sierra Nevada brewery last month for a tour.  At the
end, the tour guide showed me the brewsheet they use for the Pale
Ale (I took notes, of course).  I don't have them here so I can't 
give all the details, however I do remember the type of hops used.
For bittering, they use an "experimental high-alpha Cascade" and
for steep they use regular Cascade.  No one there was completely
familiar with the process (it was Saturday) so I couldn't get any
real information on the experimental Cascade (like, what is the
alpha analysis).


For what it's worth...

That's not quite right.  Actually 125 ppm of *gypsum* adds 29 ppm of
calcium to the water, while 250 ppm of *gypsum* adds 58 ppm of calcium.
Gypsum is calcium sulphate dihydrate, or CaSO4 * 2H2O.


In the article I was referring to, the author said he added X amount of
"CaSO4".  I don't know whether he was using gypsum, or really using the
anhydrous form of calcium sulphate.


125 ppm of anhydrous calcium sulphate (CaSO4) adds 37 ppm of calcium,
while 250 ppm of anhydrous calcium sulphate adds 74 ppm.


More than you ever wanted to know about water treatment ...

Norm Hardy asks about the critters munching at his hops.  My organic 
gardening friends and I use this combination:


1/2 gallon white vinegar
1 bulb garlic, all cloves peeled and crushed
1 bottle cayenne pepper


Mix it all together and let stand for two weeks.  Strain and spray on your 
garden.  I know, it sounds *strong*.  It is, don't eat it, just spray it on 
the hops.  It doesn't work for all pests, but it keeps many away, and the 
rabbits, too.

        Subject: Zymurgy `at` 3AM, Harvesting Hops
        
        Hey folks, I just moved into Steve Stroud's former residence
        and inherited his hop plants. They have flowers on them, some
        quite sizeable, and I'm wondering about harvesting them.  What
        should I look for to know when to harvest them?? Any special
        technique, or is just pulling them off OK?? Will the vines
        continue to flower throughout the season or do they flower just
        once??


When they are big, green, and have decreased slighlty in springiness when
you squeeze them, it is time to pick them.  You will know for sure next time,
because when you let them go too long, they turn into a dried out brown.


Just pull them off (some people say to squeeze them off with thumb &
forefinger).  But be gentle, since all of the good stuff is the light,
powdery yellow stuff inside.  After picking, dry them to gain
consistency in your weight measurements (last year, my 12 oz. wet dried
down to 3 oz.).


The vine you have picked from will not flower again.  It can be removed.
You should have some fresh vines which are climbing up the existing ones;
these will get their own flowers, so effectively you get multiple harvests.
Last year, I had three separate harvests off of mine.


I haven't heard of a good way of characterizing the alpha of homegrown, so
I just use mine for aromatics.

Subject: Wort Aeration notes...


Way back when I was taking HS Chemistry, I noticed that the teacher put brass
extensions on the faucets, and they had an extra short arm that stuck out
horizontally.  Each end had "grips" for holding rubber/plastic hose.  It turns
out that when unconstricted, the extra arm aerated water as it passed.  When
this was obstructed, the water ran "clear."  So, naturally, now I view this as
one possible means of aerating wort: rack through the pipe.  It should be easy
to clean, and it aerates quite non-violently.  Also, the teacher at one point
turned on the water, let it run down the drain, and hooked a hose between the
extra arm, and a bottle of ethanol, which of course, made the alcohol boil at
room temp.  Thus, we have a new method at allowing those who fear the germs of
their mouth to be able to start suction in racking, with little anxiety...
My only problem now is:  where do I get one of these?  Am I going to have to go
back to my HS to steal one?
