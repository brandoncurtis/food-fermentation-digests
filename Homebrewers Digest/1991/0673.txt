Kurt...RDWHAHB!!!
Your first suggestion is a wonderful idea. If it's possible to automate the
process of subscribing and unsubscribing then HBD should go for it. However,
your second suggestion may not be the most sensitive approach. We should be
glad to see the keen interest shown by homebrewers who pursue a subscription
to HBD with persistence. As posted in a recent HBD, Rob has been away recently
and has been unable to attend to the growing list of requests. I'm sure that
things will cool down now that he's back. I myself am relying on copies from a
friend. I myself am guilty of sending an annoying "sign me up" directly to the
forum after receiving no action from the request line. Had I received
'annoying little "don't send that message to the whole group"' letters, I would
have abandoned my interest in HBD. You guys are a friendly lot, and this is one
thing that makes HBD fairly unique and thoroughly enjoyable.


I raise a beer to you Rob and apologize if you and others found my zeal
annoying. Keep up the good work.

RE: Hops / Aphids / Natural


  I have problems with aphids attacking my rose bushes.  I went to a local
home and garden store and purchased an insecticedal soap, I think its based on
citrus oils, that works well.  I mix a tablespoon with a gallon of water and
spray it on the rose bushes no more aphids.  I got this stuff at an Agway
store under the brand name of "Safer".

Methinks (me fears!) I may have egg on my face.  Canadian regular beer IS 5%
by VOLUME.  There are stronger ones: Brador, Labatt's Extra Stock (called 
"Hi-Test" in BC), and a truly excellent beer called Upper Canada Rebellion
(available in Ontario only) are all >= 6%.


I know that mainline US beers tend to be 4-4.4%.  If this is indeed
by weight, then you are absolutely right: that's about the same as 5%
by volume.  One of the (few) points of pride Canadians have with respect
to their Southern cousins is the belief (promulgated as much by American
tourists as our own kin) that our beer is stronger.  Cruel man!  Are you
going to shatter one of my cherished adolescent myths?

As was noted in most of the requests and a subsequent post to the Digest,
the recent flurry of non-brewing traffic (like this message here, for
instance...) was caused by a lack of response to the homebrew_request
address. Said lack of response was due to Rob Gardner's vacation (imagine,
the nerve of the man!), Rob is back, non-brewing traffic has dropped off
sharply, so let's just drop it, OK?


But, as long as I'm here posting pure noise, I think it's been too long
since we had a "Thanks, Rob" thread. Rob, I really appreciate the time and
effort you put into keeping this digest going. Thanks!

Subject: How to subscribe to the Digest.


In response to the suggestion to annoy people who send to the list 
instead of to the "homebrew request" address for a subscription.




If you are on BITNET, then the listserv method is better than homebrew 
request.  It is automated, and you can get on and off whenver you want 
to--especially if you will be away, and don't want a lot of mail.  It 
takes about 30 seconds to subscribe via listserv.


For a vax machine type this:


$ send listserv`at`UA1VM subscribe beer-l "Your name"


to get off the list:


$ send listserv`at`UA1VM unsubscribe beer-l


For an IBM mainframe:


Tell listserv at UA1VM subscribe beer-l "Your name"


to get off the list:


Tell listserv at UA1VM unsubscribe beer-l


Any local "listserv" can be substituted for UA1VM, for example, I use 
SUVM, and SUVM forwards the message to UA1VM.


N.B.--If you subscribed to the list via homebrew request, you *cannot* 
get off the list via "unsubscribe."  They are two separate mailers.


BTW Someone told me Rob was on vacation and thats why it took so long 
to get people on and off the list.  True?

Subject: hydrometer readings, corn sugar, and hop pest repellent




On hydrometer readings:


>Specifically when you quote alcohol contents, are you doign it by Volume (what
>the rest of the world uses) or by Weight (what we fools in the US use). When
>you call something a mind numbing 5% (assuming it's by volume) that's the
>equivalent of ~4.2% which is not very different from many US beers. Of course


from this I deduce that pure alcohol has a S.G of 4.2/5.0 = .84
anybody with a bottle of everclear (and hydrometer) care to verify this?


hypothetically, assume that you have 1.040 S.G unfermented wort,
with 5% potential alcohol (an approximation to the best of my memory),
and anything non-water is 100% fermentable.  It ferments
completely - nothing left but alcohol and water (very hypothetical).
It should now have a S.G. of .95 * 1.000 + .05 * .840 = .992, not 1.000
A hydrometer calculation would indicate that that you have lost
.048 S.G, and have an alcohol content of 6%, not 5%!


If the hydrometer manufacturers compensate for this,
the label on the scale "potential % alcohol" is erroneous.


What they can adjust for is "% by weight" or "% by volume".
I would assume that hydrometer readings are calibrated for weight,
means you are weighing the stuff, but they could calibrate the
potential alcohol scale for volume.  It's calibrated for weight,
is it not?  If not, the rest of my argument is in err.


Note that 4.2/5 ~ 5/6.


original potential alcohol:     5 %
final potential alcohol:       -1 %
- -----------------------------------
unadjusted alcohol content:     6 % by weight
adjusted for error in F.G:      5 % by weight
                                6 % by volume


You should always be able to multiply by 5/6 to get the
% alcohol by wieght, adjusted for the error in taking the
final gravity.  all equations are linear.


i.e. if the "potential % alcohol" scale on your hydrometer is
adjusted for weight, it is really giving you % alcohol by volume
after you subtract.


disclaimer: I don't have a hydrometer here in front of me,
if 1.040 S.G. is not 5% potential alcohol by weight, the
calculations will need to be re-done.

On corn syrup:


>High fructose corn syrup is not a "naturally" occuring
>substance to my knowledge.


Isn't it just corn starch that has been converted to sugar
by the same malting process we homebrewers use?  Is that
not "natural"?


.................................................................
On hop pest-repellent:


>1/2 gallon white vinegar
>1 bulb garlic, all cloves peeled and crushed
>1 bottle cayenne pepper


Add a bottle of beer, an onion, and soak your brats!


I hope it doesn't impart a permanent off-flavor to the hops!
(It's all water-soluble, it should wash away).
You can always try electric fences...

The ultimate guide I used for a similar trip was Michael Jackson's
Pocket Guide to Beer. Jackson includes directions, addresses, telephone
numbers, etc. of breweries and drinking establishments. I used it as
my primary guidebook. Another thing which I stumbled across was an
association of Brewery-Hotels in Germany. I believe you could get
more information on this association by contacting one of its members,
such as Zum Uriege Brewpub in Dusseldorf or Hirsch Hotel in Ottoburen.
Ottoburen was a particular highlight - besides the magnificent medeval
monastary ("***" - Michelin Guidebook) one cannot miss the hotel's
swimming pool which is heated by the brewery's brew-kettles.

Yes.  My brew partner and I have a peristaltic pump.  We use it for
moving the hot wort from the brew pot through a copper coil immersed
in ice water to the primary fermenter.  


Here are some of the big advantages:
1) the pump is self-priming - no need to prime the pump with water via gravity
2) no contact with pump - the wort only passes through tubing
3) infinite speed control - you can adjust the speed of the flow to get the
   correct temperature out of the wort chiller
4) clean up is easy - just run boiling water through the tubing when you are
   done


The only problem we had was trying to find the correct type of tubing for the
pump.  The most common type of food grade plastic tubing is too stiff to take
the constant flexing of the pump armature.  We found peristaltic tubing that
can take high temperatures (autoclavable).

This morning's Boston Globe reports that the government is FINALLY going to
require all fruit juice to list the types of fruit juice used AND the 
percentages. Oh, Happy Day! 


This regulation has been fought vigorously by our friendly neighborhood 
farmer's co-op and toxic dumper Ocean Spray. Noone would want to drink 100%
cranberry juice (at least noone I know), so Ocean Spray feels that having
to list the amount of corn sugar in juice will cause people to avoid cranberry
based products, since they are (generally) mostly corn sugar. But the feds
have finally prevailed, and soon we'll really be able to know what's in those
bottles.

Hello.
        i hadn't seen one of these in the last two three issues i read, so i

        So i am going to LA for a full fledged Indian (East Indian) wedding and
will be able to tear myself away from the wonderful food and celebrations
for only one night, and would like to know of two good pubs in the area near 
Disneyworld (or is it D-land?). No the wedding is not in Disney, but i AM staying
right next to the place..... 


ANy info will be appreciated.
Thanks for your time.
