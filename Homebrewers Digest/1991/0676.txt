Can't say much about brewpubs except that I hear that three may be
opening soon.  As for bars, Aunt Heidi's Corner has a wide selection,
and Kent's Deli, while not a bar, is pretty good, although a bit high.
Just picked up some Samischlaus from them...


Two liquor stores also come to mind as having a good selection - Bevco
on Delmar, and Hobnob Liquors (formerly Life of the Party) in South
County.


Hope this helps...

Subject: Re: Power Brew


    The Washington Post ran an anonymous editorial yesterday (7/8) that
sounded identical to the one mentioned.  It slammed malt liquors in
general and Power Brew in particular.  One of the beefs was the advertising
strategy of targeting minorities.  The artical mentioned Power Brew's
closest malt liquor competitors both had alcohol strengths of 4.5% by
weight.  Power Brew had 5.9% alcohol.
    The editorial suggested not banning or regulating the advertising,
but limiting the alcoholic content of malt liquor in general (to 4%).
This showed the ignorance of the author to the legal definition of malt
liquor in this country.  The idea of listing strengths and ingredients
on beer was not addressed.  The artical stated that it was preferable
to limit the strength of beer than to "limit the freedom of expression"
by restricting advertising.
    It also seems that the top selling malt liquors are just after the
malt liquor label for marketing.  Their strengths are barely over the
"malt liquor threshold".
    Basically, this artical scares me.  I wouldn't notice if Colt 45
or Old English 800 were altered, but this trend would definitely outlaw
beers like Anchor's Old Foghorn and Sierra's Bigfoot Ale.  Not to mention
EQU 28 and many other fine brews over 4% alcohol.

Subject: yet another (and another...) request for brew pub locations


Hey, you know, the AHA has a list of brewpubs and micros that they'll send
you for *free* (at least they used to).  They may not be as _au courant_ as
the HBD, but it is an awfully good starting point. Of course, they do not
rate, praise, or criticize them.


Perhaps we could get the AHA to send the HBD its list and archive it? Or
are they just not hooked up enough. Does anyone here read their compuserv
forum? if so, what's there, and could we ship it here?


Also, the best guide I've found is Jackson's new and improved and updated
and revised guide. It's very accurate for the places in DC, Baltimore, and
Seattle which I know, and it got me around the Munich area and Prague quite
well; amazingly thorough.  Highly recommended.

Since brew pub and similar requests constitute 5-10% of the postings
here, I thought I would let folks know about a publication that
may help out.  The editor/publisher of the _World Beer Review_,
Steve Johnson, has compiled 'the only current, comprehensive guide
to U.S. brewpubs and microbreweries'.  It's called the _1991 Guide
To U.S. Brewpubs_ and is available for $14.95 + $2.00(.50 each addt'l
copy) P&H from:


   ON TAP ABA--WBR Publications
   P.O. Box 71
   Clemson, SC 29633


Some quotes from the flyer I have about the book:


   -212 brewpubs and microbreweries
   -Organized in easy-to-use, state-by-state arrangement
   -State maps and other illustrations
   -History of the American beer renaissance
   -Description of the brewing process
   -Beer vocabulary
   -314 pages
   -Fully indexed
   -Sturdy paperback binding with cover in color


I don't have my copy yet, but plan on ordering it soon...

I caught a blurb on this while watching CNN last week.  The beer
was called 'Power Master' and had a black bird on silver background
with a shield motif.  The way it was advertised certainly made me 
feel as if it was a strong beer.  When I first saw an ad. for it 
I thought 'Oh no, not another Heffenrefer (sp?) style beer'.

I didn't see a response copied to HBD, so I don't know if you ever
got an answer.  I have a Golden Gate keg, which I use when I keg
homebrew - I like it better than the Hoff-Stevens style, because the
Golden Gate fittings can be removed for better cleaning (I had a
special tool made to do this).


Anyway, I got my Golden Gate taps from Superior Products near St.
Paul, MN.  This was a number of years ago, and I don't have a
current catalog here at work, so I'll just give their address and
phone number, and let you do the research.

Dates: July 19, 20 and 21.


Starts friday, July 19 around 4 or 5. Starts around 11 or so on Saturday and
Sunday. There will be 40 to 50 microbreweries represented, last year most had
more than 1 beer. It's down on the waterfront, (Front Street), south of the 
Burnside bridge a ways. Front Street is on the west side of the river.


This is all from memory, if anyone wants more detailed info, send E-Mail and
I'll get my flyer out and post.


One thing, in prior years they have ran out of the popular brews early. This
year, they are splitting the beer into 3 lots so all brews will be available
each day. You may want to go early in the day for the best selection.

Subject: Wort Aeration


All this talk of faucet aspirators, in-line tees with air pumps, etc.!
What do you folks use to hang a picture -- a pile driver?


Take a 1-foot length of flexible tubing.  Make a small hole (maybe a
sixteenth or an eighth of an inch in diameter) in the wall of the
tubing, a couple of inches from one end.  (An electric drill at low
speed works fine for this.)  Attach the end with the hole in it to the
output side of your in-line wort chiller.  Put the other end of the
tubing into your destination vessel and siphon away.  A fine stream of
bubbles will be sucked into the tube through the hole and your wort
will end up nice and foamy in the fermenter.  Simple, reliable, works
great.


If you don't use an in-line chiller, just make a special siphon tube
with such a hole a foot from the downhill end.


To make it work extra well, attach a fancy label that says "In-line Wort
Aeration Venturi Aspiration Implement".

Subject: Double Bock




 I reciently had the opportunity to relax with a few glasses of Sam Adams
Double Bock beer. I found it to have a nice malt flavor with plenty of hops
aroma and taste. However I found it to be very sweet tasting.
 I find that my own homebrew is very similar in style and taste, but not
nearly as sweet. Now here comes the question.. 
Is double bock supposed to be a sweet tasting beer or was the fermentation
of the Sam Adams stopped early for some reason?
 Your comments would be welcome.

Subject: Decoction mashing


Mike McNally brought up the issue of decoction mashing, an excellent
question indeed, as I just finished doing one last weekend.  The questions
to be answered or discussed might be:
(1) for what malts is it necessary?
(2) for what malts/beer styles is it helpful?
(3) how thick is the "thickest" third?
(4) does decoction mashing (with boiled grains) give better maltiness?
(5) is the extraction better with decoctions?


More come to mind, but here are a few comments from what I did:


 I used the scheme as mentioned by D Richman in the latest (yuppified?)
 zymurgy magazine when he talked of P Urquell's mashing method.  It went
 well and took 4 hours just for that.  


 I took the "thickER" third to bring slowly (with rests) to a boil.  The
 mash must have some liquid or else bad news on the brew pot bottom.


 The mash does get darker because of the grains being boiled.  
 
 Noonan says that after sparging and starting the boil, that one need not
 boil the wort for 15-30 minutes before adding hops.  I did notice much
 fewer protein flakes in the boil after 30 minutes of boil.


Maybe the real question is:  is the extra time worth it?  We'll see....

There were several questions about the Oregon 
Brewers Festival that takes place this summer.
This is an annual festival(three years so far) put 
on by Widmer, Bridgport, and Portland Breweries.  
This year it takes place on July 19, 20, and 21 at 
Waterfront Park.  Micro brews from all over the 
country and Canada are featured.  Last year there 
were thirty some odd beers and this year they are 
projecting 40 +.  It is a great way to try many 
different micro brews and it is always a great 
party, with a large tent(Octoberfest style), food, 
music and of course beer.  So far the festival has 
always been held on the weekend closest to the 20 
th of July.
Let me know if you need more information.

I have never been able to find two bottles of any brews imported in lesser 
quantities to be the same.  I have long since given up on even attempting to 
determine their true characteristics from imported bottles.  That was true 
of Mackeson's as well - I had them in Atlanta earlier this year.  I would 
not base my judgement on these random tastings.

     Hi all!  I've got a batch of ginger beer in that I'm beginning to be
concerned about.  I pitch on the 15th of June and it's still bubbling through
the fermentation lock!  I did try rehydrating the yeast in some water (I think
I added some sugar as well) then pitching.  The stuff never did take off as it
has in the past and the activity in the carboy has been pretty slow (compared
to my past batches).  What is going on?  Is there something in ginger which
contributes to slow fermentations?  Any tips?

Seeing Stu Mennitt's posting in #675 today brought a question to my mind:
what in the heck is going on with Dave Miller and the brewpub he was (is)
allegedly starting up in St. Louis?  I had heard that he had succeeded in his
battle to legalize brewpubs in Missouri (is this true?) and was wondering how
things were going for him in starting up his brewery.


Dave Miller was one of the people I was hoping to meet at the AHA conference 
but was disappointed in this undertaking.  At least I got to meet Darryl 
Richman, Kinney Baughman, and many other HBD types!  Maybe next year in Mil-
waukee, which is closer to St. Louis.  


I'm a big fan of TCHoHB; this book was my main source in my transformation

The beer fest this year will be held July 19, 20, and 21 in Tom Mcall
Waterfront Park in downtown Portland. Microbreweries from all over the
west coast including Alaska will be there.

Subject: ramblings on wheat beer, and more


Howdy, folks.


On those wheat beer recipes of Mike Lang from Digest #675...


The wheat beers I've made using crystal malt (from 1/4 to 1 pound in a 10
pound mash that's 50% wheat, 50% Klages) are smoother, darker, and sweeter 
than ones without;  this sweetness is somewhat balanced by adding about 33-50%
more hops in the boil.  However, I find that the refreshing, tart, fruitiness 
of a lighter wheat beer is more true to style, if this is what you are after.


What I would change in the recipes that Mike Lang gave would be to cut the 
crystal malt to zero and reduce the boiling hops to ~ 3/4 ounce.  Tettnanger
seems to be more true to style than Hallertauer although both are good; 1/2 
ounce for finishing is fine.  Too much hop flavor, aroma, and/or bitterness
would be out of style for what is meant to be a delicate, slightly fruity and
spicy, yet somewhat malty beer.


Wyeast #3056 Bavarian Wheat is a fine yeast.  I've heard it's a blend of 2 or
3 species, one of which is S. Delbruckii, one of which is a strain of S. Cere-
visiaie (ale yeast), and perhaps one more that's a flavor-neutral flocculant.
It seems, IMHO, that if you ferment above 75F that too much banana ester gets
produced, and that if you ferment under 65-70F that you don't get enough 
clove.  Either extreme puts you out of style for Bavarian Weizenbier.  Anyone 
else with experience in the area of systematic temperature variation for this
yeast?


Want clove?  Go with the MeV Weizen, which is pure S. Delbruckii, and produces
a really sharp, clove taste, with little or no ester to balance.   It's too
strong for my taste, but you might like it.  Kind of on the other extreme from
Mike Lang's beers.


On a related topic, when I toured the Boston Beer Co. (Samuel Adams) at the
AHA conference pub crawl, Jim Koch said that the yeast employed for their new
Wheat Beer was a wild yeast (Brettanomyces).  After drinking it, the only thing
I noticed strange was a smoky note in the finish; this to me seemed really
just a continuation of normal clove taste.  I've tasted it in wheat beers made
with 3056 (yes, your club champ, Dr. Beebe!)  Nothing that seemed "wild"; that
is, no taste of horse or curdled milk or Darryl Richman's electric blanket.  
I'm wondering if old Jim was just b.s.'ing us, if he was mistaken, or if there
are some yeast of this genus that are, uh, relatively, well, uh, "tame".   


DEXTRINS REVISITED.....


You know, I just realized that the debate on dextrins 'n body was somewhat
abbreviated (for this digest, that is).  I keep seeing contradictory infor-
mation in different sources...TCHoHB says "it's been proven that dextrins don't
add body to beer", other sources imply the opposite, such as Jackson's and
Eckhardt's books.  What do YOU think?  DO DEXTRINS ADD BODY TO BEER? 


Also, since any polysaccharide over 4 sugar units long is considered to be a
dextrin, perhaps there are differences in flavor from shorter versus longer 
ones.  Maybe big ones add to body but short ones don't?  (Kind of like how 
longer polymers have more impact on solvent viscosity than shorter ones.)  
Maybe longer ones can't fit into your taste buds and therefore don't impart
much, if any, sweetness?  Maybe I should read up on my high school biology
and stop drinking so many homebrews?


'Nuff said.  


Yours in the Suds,


STEVE

I wonder, do people worry too much about aeration of their wort?


Anyway, a surplus house has little (.75" sq) sintered stainless steel
diffusers for cheap (2 for $2.25).  Being steel they would be easy to
sterilize - just boil for 10 minutes.   The other thing I have noticed is
that hardware stores have bottled oxygen for home propane/oxygen torches.
The bottles look just like a propane bottle.


So, skip the unfiltered air/pumps and inject raw O2 with a sintered
diffuser.  Hmm, maybe the sucker can be attached to the out tube on my keg to
filter out yeast and hops?  Maybe it can be used in reverse as a carbonation
stone when I initially carbonate my beer?


If you wish to pursue these ideas, the surplus house is:


Jerryco inc.
601 linden place
Evanston, Illinois. 60202
(708) 475-8440


I have never purchased anything from them (yet).  Appearently they have
retail outlets (American Science & Surplus Centers) in Chicago and Milwaukee.

Subject: Re: Possible Aphid cure.


Dan suggests:
>1/2 gallon white vinegar
>1 bulb garlic, all cloves peeled and crushed
>1 bottle cayenne pepper


And someone else said it would wash off because it was all water
soluble.  I would have to disagree about the water solubility.
The garlic and pepper have oils in them.  (Eat a Jalapeno -- yes,
seeds and all -- and then drink all the water you want... the
heat will not simply wash away.)


Back to Aphids.  My hops are literally getting eaten alive by
some kind(s) of bugs.  I tried "Safer" but it didn't work and
since then I have seen several aphids.  (I don't know if it's
only aphids that are my problem:  holes eaten through the hop
leaves -- some so eaten there's only 5% of the leaf left!!!)
Another problem with the "Safer:" the liquid would cover the
leaves and then run to the edges of the leaves.  The lower edges
of all the older leaves turned brown.  I used premixed "Safer"
(which, if you missed the previous discussion, is supposed
to be some kind of soap-based insectacide), so I don't think
it was a overconcentration problem.


Enter the heavy artillery: Malathion 50.  I also have some
Diazanon, but the Malathion label mentions fruits and veggies
more, so I figured that I'll try that first.  It's been about
a week and three sprayings, but this morning, I found an aphid.
I think I'll give the Malathion another week and then go to
the Diazanon.


I've been reading an Ortho book on garden pests along with
"Homegrown Hops" (which is a pretty good book, but contradicts
the guy at Freshops in a few places) and the Ortho book
mentions checking at night -- some of my little enemies may
be night-feeders.  If aphids are my only problem, it's off
to the lady bug store for me.


I would have prefered to go all-natural, but at the rate I was
losing leaves, I would have lost all above-ground growth in
a week, so I went with chemistry.


I'm still open to natural gardening, but will probably wait
till next year.  I planted the rhyzomes late this spring and
probably would worry a lot less if my plants weren't so
young.  Hopefully, next year my plants will be 15 feet at
this time (instead of 6 feet) and the leaves will be so big
that I won't have to worry.


Al.

I made what I call "Ginger Bock-and-a-Half" about a month and a half ago,
and have had great success with it. Yet there may or may not be something
in ginger that retards the fermentation, I don't know; I only used about 
2 - 3 gramms of fresh sliced/skinned ginger root for a high O.G. 5'ish gallon
batch of dark half-mash half-amber-extract batch. Also, I added the ginger
just before the finishing hops, so as to just give what I calculated would
be a HINT o'ginger.


I had no problems with any stage. Some friends say its the best beer they 
have ever tasted, great head retention and carbonation. Maybe you used too
much ginger, it is a very powerful root.

Subject: Oregon Brewers Festival




Last year I had the pleasure of attending the Oregon Brewer's Festival.
I have one word of advice, GO!! It is a great opportunity to taste beers 
from all over the Northwest and beyond. This year they are expecting
something like 46 breweries present. The festival is very well run, you pay
for each sample as you go which tends to get people away from the "I paid my
$25 and now I'm going to get my money's worth" attitude. It's held in a
pleasant park along the Willamette River. There is food and live music too.


Last year, I spent part of an afternoon tasting beers with Fred Eckhardt.
During that time, I was mistaken for Charlie Papazian three times!!


Needless to say, it was a good time.

        I saw this and thought 'Gee how do you keep from getting large 
ammounts of O2 into the hot mash material'?  Would it seriously affect
the oxydation (sp) of the final wort?  And would this create the off 
flavors that Mike is talking about?

Subject: Brewery Tours


Just a few thoughts on some breweries I visited yesterday.  I 
took a trip to the local Anheuser-Busch plant in Baldwinsville, 
N.Y., and the F.X. Matts Brewery in Utica New York.  Tomorrow, 
weather willing (I want to ride my motorcycle) I'm going to go to 
the Genesee Brewery in Rochester, N.Y.


Anheuser-Busch--A totally boring brewery.  They don't get you 
in to the guts of the place, you basically see the periphery.  
They show you a five minute film about how they brew and how 
good they are doing it.  They showed the top of a fermenter, 
and that's about it.  The receptionist was pretty good looking 
tho'; she had a wonderful phone voice.


The tour guide was pretty uninformed, she didn't even know 
what type of hops they used!  I spied Saaz in the hops room 
they showed us, anyway.  They just kept stressing about how 
their "product" was quality controlled to provide consistency.


The tour guide's boss also told someone who asked, that bock 
beer was made by cleaning out the bottom of fermenters!  The 
boss claimed to know more than her worker.  I couldn't believe it!


I tried all their beers, and concluded that Bud *still* sucks.  Their 
non-alcohol beer is pretty lame, O'Doul's.  


F.X. Matts--I like this place because when you walk in, it is like 
the parlor of someoneUs turn of the century house.  Nice sitting 
chairs, elaborate woodwork and nice displays of old Matt's stuff.  
I was a little pissed because they charged 2$ for admission and a 
tour.  Pretty lame as far as I'm concerned.  A tour promotes 
drinking the product, and I don't think Matt's is in that bad shape 
that they need 2$ from people.  Anyway....


The tour starts with a history of the founders and then moves in 
to a room with grains, adjuncts and hops.  All there for people to 
touch.  Nice.  Then it moved to a room with a brew kettle.  The 
guide showed how stuff went into the kettle from each of the 
areas and where the mash tun was.


We then went to the primary fermenters and the lagering room.  
Man the lagering room was cold, 32 f'ing degrees!  They then 
showed us the bottling and labeling aspect.


The tour ends in their bar, where you could get two cold ones--
either Matt's beer or root beer.  They also had a gift shop with all 
the stuff they brew, and with a nice 8 pack of all the contract 
brews they do:  Samuel Adams *Ale*, Dock Street Ale, Albany 
Amber, Brooklyn Lager, Newman's and I can't remember the last 
one, so don't get mad.  Saranac 1888 is in there, but they don't 
contract brew it, they just brew it.


Matt's felt much more like a family deal, Bud was so damn 
corporate.  They even had Eagle snacks at Bud!


One interesting thing.  I met an Assistant Brewer from Miller.  We 
BS'ed about beer and he told me a few things.  


One is that he claims the reason that Miller RGenuineS Draft 
doesn't skunk, tho' it's in clear bottles is the hops that they use.  
I can't remember what hops it was, but it was something I hadn't 
heard of.


Two is that he claims that there is very little difference between 
"Dry" beers and "Lite" beers.  He said they are both inundated
with a lot of yeast when pitched, to get rid of the fermentables.  
That gets rid of the calories in the sugar, then they dilute the 
beer with water so it's not high in alcohol.  The "Dry" and "Lite"
beers he said were just degrees of fermentables.


He also said that they had tried a wheat beer in the midwest, 
hoping to appeal to farmers.  It was called "Dakota"but he said it 
failed miserably.


The thing I didnt like about him was the way he referred to beer 
as "product". I guess thats the way that Miller, Bud and the like 
see beer, but I dont. I like messing with it and seeing what 
happens.  I haven't brewed a hell of a lot, but I do it for a hobby, 
not a job.  I don't see it as a pruduct but something I made.  He 
just kept calling every damn thing a "product."


Anyway, thats about it.  Sorry I rambled on for so long.


Keep on Brewin'!
