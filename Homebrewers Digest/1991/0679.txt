I'd make a mead.  If the yield was really high (if its a big tree)
I might even consider apricot wine.


Last summer I made 6 cases (pints!) of apricot mead, took it to a
really big bash (500-600), and it disappeared *really* quick.  
Everyone really enjoyed it.  FWIW, this was a quick mead -- very
sweet, highly carbonated, definately dangerous if allowed to warm.

Subject: Boulder Watering holes


Having spent some time in Boulder, I thought I'd throw in my two cents on
what and where.


Concerning the Walnut Brewery: they had just opened it as I was graduating.
My impression is that it is an inferior brewery when compared to the Wyncoop
Brewery at Union and Wyncoop in Denver.  The guys who made the Wyncoop helped
construct the Walnut brewery, but they seemed to have kept the better batches
down in Denver.


Old Chicago's is fun - I say go there on a Friday starting at 4:00 when
Happy hour opens.  You get a discount on beer and dollar mini-pizas.  Once
you're down that way, you'll find that a crawl on the Pearl Street Mall is
a must.  There are a number of bars there.  Some, such as Pearl's, have
some OK beers on tap.  


Names are not my specialty, but if you want directions to the Pearl Street
Mall bars that have Guinness, Sam Adams, Boulder Beer, and other decent
beers on tap, e-mail me at GKUSHMER`at`RUBY.TUFTS.EDU.  I'll fumble through
directions and landmarks.


In summary, the whole outdoor mall is fun and all the spots are very 
close.  Hit it on Thursday and Saturday for the really active crowds.

Subject: Re: Impressed by Anchor Steam Beer


David Taylor (DAVID`at`phillip.edu.au) writes in #678 that he's impressed with
Anchor Steam and Anchor Brewery in general.  Me too.


I am pleased to report that the "largest of the micros" (or is it the "smallest
of the majors" or just a damn good craft brewery) is still operating in the
same way as when Jackson profiled it (hey, that was only a year ago).  In
addition to their Steam Beer, they make Liberty Ale (a hoppy Pale Ale), Anchor
Porter (which is really a stout), Anchor Wheat (a fine example of American
Wheat beer, which I had heard would be available sometime this year in bottles,
but I think is still only available to their draft accounts), Old Foghorn (a
sturdy barleywine), and their annual Christmas Beer (which everyone I know
calls "Anchor Christmas" even though the labels say "Our Special Ale").  In
addition, they have done several small runs of specialty beers (the Sumarian
beer that was discussed here in HBD and another beer that they told us about
when I took the tour but can't remember much about except that it was available
only in the neighborhood for a couple of weeks and that the proceeds went to
some children's charity).


By the way, Anchor has been around for decades.  Legend has it that Fritz (who
is, of course, an heir to the Maytag appliance fortune) used to quaff a few
Steam Beers at a neighborhood tavern in the 1960s.  One day his beertender told
him to have an extra one, the bar was down to its last keg and the brewery was
closing its doors forever at the end of the week.  Fritz stepped in and bought
the brewery, keeping it open.   At the time, Anchor had quality control
problems and a shaky reputation due to the hit-or-miss nature of the beer they
sold.  Over the course of the next dozen or so years, Fritz instituted more
standardization, instilled a sense of pride in the workforce, and drastically
raised the quality of the beer Anchor produced.  At some point, the brewery
even stopped losing money!  The reputation of Anchor soared.


Oops, I'm gushing.  Others will, no doubt, chime in with a lot more details
than I can muster this early in the morning.  Suffice to say, Anchor is alive
and well.

Would it be possible to introduce the ladybugs earlier? I have heard that
one can purchase ladybugs mail-order for this purpose. Anyone tried it?


"Nuking" is sometimes called for, no doubt, but a few weeks ago my small
bush bean patch was suddenly swarming with bean beetles, chewing holes in
all the leaves; I spent 20 minutes or so picking them off by hand and des-
troying them, and voila, no more beetles ever since! Surprised the heck out
of me, didn't think they could be "defeated" so simply.

Full-Name: Ted Manahan


Dan (c/o Shannon) asks about blackberry mead. I too have been planning
to try a blackberry mead, as well as a blackberry ale, this summer.
I just moved to Oregon last fall; there are an amazing number of
wild blackberry plants here!


For the mead I plan to use 10 lbs. clover honey, 7 lbs. blackberries,
and maybe a little tea to give it some astringency. I'll probably use 7
lbs. of blackberries for the ale too. I plan to pasteurize the berries
at about 170 degrees, but not to boil them for fear of causing pectin
haze.


Any comments on the above plan?

Well, lemme tell ya about the Anchor brewery tour I got back in 1977 or
78... A couple of friends and I decided to drive up to San Francisco for
the weekend. We arrived in the early afternoon, I think on December 30 or
31. Being a brewery kind of guy, I suggested we hunt down the Anchor
brewery and take the tour. All brewerys have tours every hour on the hour,
right?


I looked up Anchor's address in the phone book, and we drove over. They
were located in a small warehouse near the docks. The front door was
locked, so we rang the bell. A guy answered the door and asked what we
wanted. I explained that I liked Anchor Steam, and wanted to tour the
brewery. He said, "Well, we're just starting our year end meeting, and my
secretary isn't here today... But what the hell, come on in. I'm Fritz
Maytag, the owner."


Fritz proceeded to introduce us to every employee of the Anchor Brewing
Company (all 4 of them, except the absent secretary, of course), sat us
down in a room full of beer memorabilia and pointed at the taps projecting
from the large tanks whose ends formed one wall of the room. "That one's
Steam, and the other one's Porter," he said. "We have to get our meeting
started now, but you can stay and sample some beer if you want." He then
shook hands all around, and went off to attend to business.


The brewery has moved to larger quarters, but I suspect the attitude hasn't
changed in the 12 or 13 years since I was there, and won't as long as Fritz
Maytag remains in charge. He loves what he does, makes money at it, and
doesn't need to make money anyway. I can't really picture him selling out
to Megabrew, Inc.

Corona makes more than one grain mill.  I remember a flyer that
came from William's Brewing a while back, they had a deal on
some Corona mills that they accidentally got that were the
"wrong" ones.  They said that it would be ok for grinding
flour, but probably not strong enough for cracking malt.  I
think the heavy-duty one common for brew duty is the Corn Mill.

So I called up the US distributor. Not good news. She said:
1. We have no MeV yeast in stock
2. MeV is reorganizing [didn't say why, but her tone was downbeat]
3. Mayer doesn't ship/sell it in the summer due to problems with heat 
4. They'll sell it in the fall, *if* MeV is still around 


Yow! so stock up now on their strains -- especially their exceptional
weissbier yeast -- and put 'em on slants for posterity.


Or perhaps MeV fan mail might help?

Greetings,
        As long as we've been bashing industrial beers, I thought I'd 
mention something I noticed on tv the other day.  Has anyone 
seen the Coors Extra Gold commercials where they gloat about how Bud 
drinkers prefer it to Bud (some accomplishment, eh?)?  At the end they
mention that the "beer" is SLOW brewed.  Do you think that they just sit 
around and casually take their time, or is it brewed by mentally deficient 
(i.e. slow) people?

Subject: 40 Ounce bottles for HomeBrew


Howdy!
        I've been reading this digest for about six months now and finally I'm
sending something to it myself, and more importantly getting ready to brew
my first batch.  


        My question is this.  I have collected a lot of those 40 ounce 
Malt Liquor bottles (King Kobra, Mickeys, etc) and was thinking about using
them for bottling homebrew in.  Yes, I can see all your shocked faces now...
"He actually drinks that stuff???".   Well, as a poor college student I can
rarely afford to buy Watney's or Double Diamond or any of those other 
expensive beers I like (That's one of the reasons I want to brew my own :)
Anyhow, has anyone out there used these kinds of bottles for homebrew?  The
fellow at our local homebrew supply store in Albuquerque (The Grape Arbor)
sells screw on caps for them that look pretty sturdy.  He recommended that
I use Grolsh bottles, but I really don't want to run around to all
the bars and try to collect a mess of 'em if I can use the bottles I already
have.  I think these bottles would be Ideal, since you don't have to fill
as many, and they can be resealed.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks!

I just heard that there have been > 100,000 copies of Charlie Papazian's
"The Complete Joy of Home Brewing" sold to date.


Assuming every homebrewer has bought one copy, that means there are
at least 100 K folks who now or in the past have homebrewed.


Perhaps that explains the AHA membership of > 10,000 !

From what I understand, the hop harvest occurs more-or-less
simultaneously throughout the Northwest--it begins about the middle of
August and lasts some 6-8 weeks after that.  New crop hops will
therefore be available around Sept. 1, although it would be naive of us
to think that all purveyors of hops are going to immediately dump their
remaining stock of 1990 hops out into the yards to rot.  


The Freshops folks (I forget their names) do this as a part-time thing,
I believe; that's why the answering machine.  I think if you put a
"please call me" message on the machine, with an idea of when they can
best reach you, you'll hear back from them. 


From an earlier HBD, a poster complained of having aphids eating his
hops until only 5% of the leaf mass remained.  Sorry, but that damage
ain't aphids--they don't have mouths.  Aphids have little sucking
probosci like hypodermic syringes, and they live on plant juices that
they tap like subdermal rivers.  So if you're leaves are being eaten,
there's another culprit.

Howdy!
        Well, I finally went to the local beer and winemaking supply store
and started picking up equipment.  I realized that I had a question.  This
could probably be answered in either Miller's or Papazian's books, but
they're still on order.  The question:  If I'm going to be doing a one 
step fermentation, do I need to have a carboy that is a gallon or three
bigger than the amount of beer I'm brewing to account for the foam, or
is this where I would be able to get away with a five gallon carboy for
a five gallon batch using a blowoff tube?  Thanks!
