   I have a friend who wants to make his own malt.  Does anybody
have any suggestions for how to go about this?  References?

Yow!  This is practically a religious question.  Trying to be
more-or-less dispassionate you have two choices:


1) Use a 5-gallon carboy and use the blow-off method.  This means
wedging a very large (1", 1.5"?) diameter tube in the top of the
carboy with the other end in a large bucket of water.  All the
kraeusen and such will be sent out the tube into the bucket
during the primary fermentation.


2) Use a 7-gallon carboy and just attach an air-lock.


Which is better I will leave to those who wish to argue about
relative merits.  Suffice to say that I use 2 because I can.

        My partner (who's VAX account has been deleted) is getting ready to 
move to Orono, Maine.  So naturally he wants to know about the state of things
there (terrible pun, I know).  Info on brewpubs, clubs and supply shops can be
e-mailed to me.
        Thanks

For single stage fermentation you'll need a 7 gallon carboy with a
fermentation lock or a 5 gallon carboy with a blow-off tube. You'll lose
about a quart of potential beer using the blow-off tube, along with some
hop resins and other stuff that some folks feel doesn't belong in your
beer.


Because I often leave beer sitting in the carboy for ridiculous periods of
time, waiting for an opportunity to go to the basement and bottle it, I do
two-stage fermentations. I have a 7 gallon carboy for a primary, and 5
gallon carboys for secondarys.

Hi fellow brewers,
   I made my first batch yesterday, so I can say that now :) Since I didn't
have any homebrew on hand, I think I worried too much, but everything's
bubbling away now.
   I live in New Haven Ct, someone on this digest does too, and someone is now
moving to Storrs, CT. If there isn't a brew club let's organize one. Send me
e-mail at the address below.
   My boyfriend just came back from Monteray Calif. and went to the Monteray
Brewing Company pub. He says it is a lovely atmosphere, the people were very
pleasant and the food was good. However, he says that the beer (ale, stout and
something else) was all too yeasty and not very good. Oh well.

Subject: Anchor Steam


I have to say, I'm a firm believer in Anchor Steam (unfortunately,
it's rather difficult to get here in northern Alabama).  I first had
it on tap at the Sun Club in Tempe, AZ and was hooked from the first
glass.  I have since had both Anchor Porter and Liberty Ale and enjoy
them very much.  Those are, however, the only Anchor products I've
had the pleasure to enjoy.  Hmmm, I think I'll take a trip to
Nashville and see if I can get any up there....


Curiously enough, I first learned of Anchor Steam in Robert Parker's
Spenser novels, back before I knew that there were any American
beers worth drinking.  Anchor Steam turned me around.

Subject: Peristaltic pumps.


After doing a bit of digging, I found out what a peristaltic pump is.  It 
does not touch the fluid, it acts on the very flexible tubing and gently 
moves the fluid along.  Perfect for sort of sterile wort.  I rushed home 
and dug out the Carolina Bio catalog and found the peristaltic pump.  Oh, 
it's $330.  Ah well, maybe Cole Parmer will have more and cheaper ones, so 
I broke my arm lifting that tome of a catalog.


Sure enough, they had pages and pages of peristaltic pumps, ranging in 
price from about $225 to over $2,500.  Still, $225 is a bit much to move 
wort.  Does anyone know of a inexpensive peristaltic pump, or those terms 
mutually exclusive?


oh well, back to the siphon.  I have a miligram scale and a ph meter ahead 
of the pump, so it'll be awhile.

Both phone numbers given in Digest 679 for MeV are bogus - one gives an
answering machine that doesn't seem to be a company, the other is not in
service.


Bell Canada directory assistance doesn't have a listing for the company.

Subject: Transfering hot wort to chiller


Greetings!


Three of us (from the Cornell contingent) have put together a couple of 
counter-flow wort chillers, using 3/8" copper tubing and 3/4" garden hose.
Thanks to this Digest, we know how to clean the inside of the tubing...
extended discussion on this point way back in March/April were most helpful.
What we *don't* know is how to get the near-boiling wort into the tubing......
 
One wants to avoid oxidizing the boiling wort, so we believe that dumping it 
into a large, spigoted container would probably not be the best plan.  We are 
a bit hesitant to drill holes in our stainless steel brewpots (but may end up 
doing so yet).  And siphoning a boiling liquid is probably unreasonable.


So, how do YOU effect this transfer?  And how do you achieve hop removal?


Thanks for your assistance,

Subject: How many Homebrewers




Well the AHA estimates I've seen say there are over 1 millions homebrewers
(still only 1/250 = .4% of US population). I don't know that I believe it, 
and if I do then that means that at ~10,000 members the AHA has only 
1% of all homebrewers joining, a pretty poor rate, though homebrewers are
a notoriously independent lot.


Take all this with a grain of salt. My recollection of these numbers is hazy at
best, and who knows if they were right to being with??

assume that you are moderate in everything.
you now have an excess of moderation, a contradiction.


excessiveness is clearly the way to go...
