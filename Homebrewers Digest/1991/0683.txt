Does anyone have a recipe (or two, or three, or...) for an Irish Ale?  If 
so, would you be good enough to post it?  Also, other than the AHA 
definition, does anyone have a good description of what one of these is?


Thanks...Gary

I've never had to deal with either sulfur or iron in my water.  But you
ought to get a copy of the transcripts from this year's AHA conference;
they should be out by the end of the year.  Greg Noonan gave a very
informative demonstration on testing water, including using a set of
inexpensive test kits to determine the make up of your water.  I'm
sure that all the details will be included in the transcripts.

Subject: What light spectrum effects beer?




I've been wondering, what part of the light spectrum effects the hops in
beer. Does fluorescent or indirect sunlight contain this part of the
light spectrum.


Also for the NYC area HBD folks the "Zip City Brewpub" will be opening
around the end of August (their estimate). The address is 3 West 18th
Street (NYC) and phone # is 212-366-6333.

The Brewer's Worksheet is available from the various archives and is an
Excel spreadsheet I wrote to do recipe formulation work.  It will
assist in devising water treatment, beer color and original gravity,
and hop bitterness.  It has a lookup table for malts and adjuncts that
can be expanded if I forgot something that you want to use.  The water
treatment calculator takes entries of water salts and determines total
ppm from a base water you supply (from a water report).  If you also
supply the ion concentrations of a target water, it will give you the
differences and a % difference to assist in getting the overall profile
correct.  It also lets you select what units you want to work with
throughout the process (e.g., you can work in pounds or kgs, ounces or
grams, gallons or liters, and so on).  A brewer over on CompuServe, Art
Steinmetz, uploaded a version that had been translated to 1-2-3 on the
PC (sorry, I don't have a copy--would someone be willing to download
it and send it over to aem?).


The manual you get with The Brewer's Worksheet implies that this is a
commercial product.  I had thought about selling it, but decided that
polishing a spreadsheet template was more work than it was worth, so it
really is free.


I am working on a for-sale formulator/batch logger called The Brewer's
Planner.  This is written in C and the first version will be for the
Mac.  It should be available in the September time frame (look for an
ad in the Fall Zymurgy).  I demoed a prototype of it at the NH
Conference, and a lot of people seemed pretty interested.  I anticipate
that I'll sell it for $50, to keep it affordable.  I hope to release
one for the PC early next year.  (If this is too commercial, somebody
tell me and I'll shut up. ;-)


Other folks are doing similar things.  I know that larryba up in
Seattle is working on a formulator written in Visual Basic, and Doug
Henderson has a HyperCard stack with some interesting heuristics for
automatically determining water treatment.

Hi-
  What is the difference between an attenuative yeast and an unattenuative
one?  
                          Thanks,

Subject: Watermelon Beer


I was reading the newspaper last night and I read a trivia piece that
said the Russians make a beer from watermelon juice. This sounded timely
and interesting though I can't imagine a Watermelon Stout. Is there anyone
out there who has ever used watermelon juice in making beer and could
provide some details?


Thanks,

Has anyone noticed a difference in the Teleford's dry malt extract lately?  I
used to use it exclusively, because it's good malt and was significantly
cheaper than the syrup, but for a time I was unable to get it from my local
supplier.  He now has it again, but it looks very different than it used to.
Teleford's used to have a crystaline quality to it; i.e., light used to shine
off the facets in the malt.  Now it is a very fine, dull powder much like
American Eagle dry.  Have they changed the way they malt their grains?  Are
they still using two-row malt or have they started using the 6-row stuff?  I
haven't had an opportunity to try the new Teleford's, so I can't tell whether
it tastes the same or not.  Anyone?

I too live in the country, and my water is not that great, particularly
in the summer when the well is a little low, or in the spring, when the
well is a little high.  I solved this problem by buying my water at the
store.  I buy the cheapest water I can find, usually about $2.50 for
five gallons of water.  It usually states on the label that it is
water from the Little Rock municipal water supply. (I think that means
they treat the water from the Arkansas River.)  It has made a big
improvement in my beer.  In fact, the large improvement for $2.50
convinced me to spend another couple of bucks per batch on liquid
yeast.  Easily the two biggest improvements to my beer.

I have been using well water with a high iron content for over a year
with no ill effects to my beer, that I can notice.  My water has a
distinctive odor to it, and I don't care to drink it straight out of the
tap.  I had often wondered what it was doing to my beer, if anything, so
I tried an experiment.  I hauled Colorado Springs city water (quite good,
actually) home in 6 gallon jugs and used it to make my beer.  I made 3
batches with city water, and discovered that it made absolutely no
discernable difference in taste whether I used my well water or city water.
Note that some styles of beer need softer or harder water than other styles,
but I haven't been able to notice any difference when I make the same beer
with my hard well water or the soft city water.


Why don't you make a batch from each well using the same recipe for
comparison purposes and then let us know how they turn out?

It probably did but all-grain brewing is long enough without

AH HA!!  If (and I'm not sure from your posting) you were just
letting the sparge water run free through the spigot on your
lauter tun, it's no wonder it never ran clear.  By all means
use a sparging bag or some other type of straining mechanism
to strain out the husks.


Don't give up on the 2 row just yet.  6-row requires a step
mash, is more complicated and difficult to work with, and 
as far as I can tell, doesn't taste any better, anyway.


(Is that the sound of rushing flames coming up behind me?) :-)


>If I still have to resort

Let's hope not.  Bear down on the straining of the husks from
the sparge water.  It really sounds like this is the source
of your problem.

From: Tom Bower <bower`at`hprnlme1.rose.hp.com>
Subject: HBD Posting
Full-Name: Tom Bower


Two items for my first posting:


1.) Water Analysis.  When I moved into my latest house I requested a water
analysis from the local water agency.  The documentation they sent me was
skimpy and lacked detail.  It just didn't have the information I wanted in
order to understand my brewmaking water.  Then, one day while wandering
through the local Sears I came upon their water-filter/softener department,
and found that they offer a FREE water analysis service.  It works like this:


You think you may want to purchase a water filter or softener.  You pick up
from Sears a little plastic sample bottle and postage-prepaid envelope.  You
take it home, fill it with water from your preferred brewmaking water faucet,
close it, bag it and mail it off.  A couple weeks later you get a nice, big
fat report - your free water analysis!  (The first step in the above process
is optional. :)


2.) Calculating the temperature to cool the wort to.  In making an extract
beer, my brewpot usually boils about 3 gallons.  Therefore I need to top off
my primary fermenter with 2-2.5 gallons of water before pitching the yeast.


Since the temperature of my top-off water is usually not proper pitching
temperature and my goal is to cool the 3 gallons of hot wort down to the
point where I can add the top-off water and pitch the yeast immediately,
I want to be able to calculate the proper temperature to cool the wort to
(using my immersion chiller) such that the resulting mix ends up being a
good pitching temperature.


If one assumes that all the liquids involved have the properties of plain
water (the properties invoved are density and specific heat) then the for-
mula for the temperature to cool the wort to is:


                             Top-off Volume
Temp.wort = Temp.pitching + ----------------- (Temp.pitching - Temp.top-off)
                             Hot Wort Volume


But as we all know, the density of wort is somewhat higher than water, and
the specific heat is probably somewhat different as well.


Right now I'm trying to work through some numbers to see if the likely dif-
ferences are going to make more than a few degrees' difference in the outcome,
but I'm curious as to whether others have attempted to do this.


Of course, the other option is to make sure my top-off water is heated to
a good pitching temperature to begin with; then I just cool the hot wort to
match and not worry.

hmm. they seem to be getting cheapert by the minute.
Maybe if I wait until next week, I can REALLY get a bargain :-)

I did the same thing when I tasted my Wyeast british ale starter and
found it to be infected.  I used Wyeast german ale instead.  It was
a little slow to start, but worked fine.  The damn thing took an entire
month to ferment, but I talked to a friend who (presumably) let his
package incubate, and hada long fermentation, too.


I re-cultured the dregs for the next batch, and with a ready starter
bottle, it still took 24 hrs to start to krausen.  I aereated this
batch fully - we'll see if it still takes a month.


Back on the subject of infected Wyeast British ale yeast.  I thought
I was at fault when I made the starter bottle, so I ordered another
package.  When I arrived, the package has already started to swell,
and the bubble had not been burst yet!  Could Wyeast have released
an infected batch?  This has only happened on British Ale packets
dated April 10 for me.  I cut open the foil, and tasted the solution,
and it was slightly sour, but certainly not "vinegary".  I then
cultured what was in the bubble, but I'll probably never use it.




cheers!

Regarding using ginger in beer slowing down yeast: I make ginger beer
that has 1/2lb of fresh ginger in 2 gallons of water, and it certainly'
doesn't slow down the fermentation in any way.




My mother's recipe to get rid of aphids:


Mix 2 cups of vegetable oil, and three tablespoons of dishwashing 
liquid together.


Taks two tablespoons of this liquid, and mix with 1 quart of water.
Thouroughly spray plants with this liquid once a week.
It apparently controls several types of bugs.
