No, we're the same person.  (Me and me, I mean, not me and CR.
He's the one with the beard.)  Since I had to pay for it, I added
in things like taxes and the cents part of the price tag.  Thanks
to all for the carboy deal leads.  If I find something remarkable,
I'll be sure to remark.


Speaking of Chinatown, has anyone tried brewing with ginseng ?  
A beer than not only cures its own hangover, but is an
aphrodisiac to boot....  Sounds too good to be legal.

Subject:  Troubleshooting a failing batch


I'm currently fermenting my 6th batch of beer - A Canadian Ale (The 
"traditional" package from Alternative Beverage; scoff if you must).  I
have never had a problem in my first 5 batches, but this batch doesn't seem
to be going quite right.  I cooked up everything on (last) Thursday night,
added
the yeast and let it go.  By Friday afternoon, there was definite
fermentation
going on.  But, Friday night, my A/C broke down, and ever since then my 
apartment has been above 85 degrees (it's been a real joy, let me tell you).
Anyway, when I went to check it this morning to see if I could bottle this
weekend, I noticed that it had not only not clarified, but that there were
still hunks of "stuff" floating around in it (the normal stuff you see swirling
around during active fermentation).  So, I'm wondering if the heat might have
killed off the yeast before it had a chance to finish fermenting.  Assuming
that this is true (and I'll be able to take a S.G. reading to verify this),
is there anything I can do to salvage this batch?  I'm going to be out of
town all next week, so I also would like to know if it is ok to let it sit
like this for another week.  I sure would hate to pour all this work down the
drain!

        I still have some of this yeast in the bottom of my
secondary. It's on its second batch of beer, so I know it's
viable 8<:^), so if anybody in the SoCal area would like to
come over and pull some slants off it, they're welcome.


        I'm going to miss MeV; Wyeast wants a fortune for
their pure S. Delbruckii strain, and I'll want to make wheat

I know I posted this before, and several people expressed an interest, but
just in case there are any more of you who didn't see it or had forgotten......


The Ithaca Brewers' Union is planning a trip to Vernon Valley, NJ, Action Park,
and the Clement Brewing Company this weekend (July 27-28).  We have arranged to
receive an owner-guided tour of the brewery, thanks to James Clement, who also
owns a brewpub here in Ithaca.  The tour will take place Saturday at 2:00pm,
and will be followed by a tasting of Clement beer (including the Blond Double
Bock), a homebrew tasting (all who come are encouraged to bring some, with a 
drinking glass), and then all the homebrewers will go to dinner.  Many of us 
are staying overnight in the area, then going to Action Park the next day to 
participate in the German Festival and go on all the water rides.  If you 
would like more information, please send e-mail to me directly or call me.


About 10 of us from Ithaca are planning on making the trip, and we expect a 
carload each from Philadelphia and the four New Jersey homebrew clubs, plus
5-10 from the New York City Homebrewers Guild.  Plus, at least 4 people from
this Digest are coming from around NJ and southern NY.  This is a good oppor-
tunity for all the clubs to get to know one another, not to mention a chance 
for those of you who think you might like to become active in a brewclub to 
see what several Mid-Atlantic clubs are all about.

Well, don't all of you get your airplane tickets to S.F. too quickly.  I drove
up to SF Chinatown yesterday to check out this $42/$39 stainless steel pot. 
Well folks it isn't stainless,it's aluminum!  I talked at length with the owner
and he verified that the pot was aluminum.  Not to waste the trip,  I scouted
several other places and found a 8 gallon pot that really looked like
Stainless,  but didn't have a magnet to check it.  I'll probably go back up
next week to re-check since this pot was nothing short of beautiful.

Subject: Juniper Beer?


Well, the Junipers are all covered with berries.  Blowing off the cobwebs
from the back of my brain brings forth a memory of someone writing about
Juniper beer many digests ago.


Is it worth trying?  Just for a lark?  Yes, I like gin, so I wouldn't
find the Juniper taste to be offensive.


How much of the berry harvest should I use for a 5 gallon batch?


Do they go into the boil?  Or is it better to "dry hop" the
berries?  Should they be crushed first?


Would Juniper go better with a "lawnmower" beer or with something
heavier?


If you've done this before, please do tell!

Alec asks:
>  What is the difference between an attenuative yeast and an unattenuative
>one?


An attenuative yeast eats more of the sugars in your wort leaving a
less sweet beer and making more alcohol (see Dry Beer).  A less
attenuative yeast leaves more sugars behind in the final beer.  Wyeast
provides a sheet that describes its yeasts including "apparent attenuation."
I'm not sure what this means.  The attenuations range from (I believe)
67% to (I believe) 78%.  I once posted a copy of this sheet, but I seem
to have deleted it.  Maybe some kind soul can send you a copy or you
can call or write to Wyeast (I don't have their number or address here)
for the sheet.  Here's some useful info from Pete Soper on Wyeast, however
I believe that Wyeast is a U.S. company in either Oregon or Washington
state (just for the record, I don't use a starter and get activity in
about 12 hours):

It is my understanding that the "bubble" in the Wyeast package is
the sugar and the stuff around it is yeast solution.  Am I right?

Yuck-ola !!!  When I talked with the salesperson, I was assured
that it was.  Additionally, it came with a nice label on the side
stating that it was stainless.  I'll go have another talk with
them.  Whether or not it is, the morals include: Always Be Careful,
Carry A Magnet, and Keep Your Receipt.
