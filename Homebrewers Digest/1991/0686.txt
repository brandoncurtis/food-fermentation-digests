>I'm going to miss MeV; Wyeast wants a fortune for their pure S. Delbruckii
My way around this was to purchase Wyeast's Weizenbier yeast (No. 3056 - a
blend of S. cerevisiae and S. delbrueckii) and to plate it out on a Petri dish
containing malt agar. The individual S. cerevisiae and S. delbrueckii colonies
that formed displayed radically different colony morphologies. The S. cerevisiae
colonies were smooth, small and round domes, typical of the majority of S.
cerevisiae colonies on malt agar. The S. delbrueckii colonies grew more rapidly
and spread out flatter, with jagged edges around the colony perimeter. They
looked exactly like the colonies I had obtained many moons ago after plating
the pure M.eV S. delbrueckii strain.


I then picked a well isolated S. delbrueckii colony from the plate and used it
to inoculate a small volume (50 ml) of sterile wort. This was scaled up to a
500 ml culture which I used to make a batch of Weizenbier. The result was a
nice tangy Weizen with plenty of clovelike phenols. :-D


If you culture yeasts on agar plates I recommend this procedure. If not I
recommend looking into home culturing. It's not as complicated as it first
seems. I'd be willing to send pure S. delbrueckii to brewers within reasonable
mailing range (I live in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Maybe there are other HD
subscribers/yeast culturers willing to do the same in their local areas.

Subject: Bottling from kegged beer?
Full-Name: Tom Bower


I got my Cornelius keg mostly to bypass the onerous chores associated
with bottling my homebrews, but sometimes I'd like to bottle some of a 
batch anyway -- for transportability.


So, what's the best way to bottle some when you're also kegging?


   1.) Pull off some of the flat brew before kegging.  Prime it with
       corn sugar based on the volume, and bottle.  Assuming I'm only
       going to do a half-dozen bottles or so, what's the best way?
       Some sugar per bottle, or make up a syrup to add to the whole
       bunch?  What's the best proportion on a per-ounce basis?




   2.) Bottle some of the already-carbonated beer straight out of the keg.
       Are there any tricks/gotchas with this?  Does naturally-carbonated
       work as well as CO2-tank-carbonated for bottling?


   3.) Other methods?

Yup, good ideas. Liquid yeast pitched into a starter is probably an even

Subject: SS vs Al revisited




OK, my vote. The winner for best method is...


Weight, well actually density. If you have some container big enough to
determine the displacement of the pot, and a scale to weigh it, then you can
determine it's density, and thus easily know whether it's Al or SS.


As for Craig Artley:
        In all the places I've lived in the last fre years I've gotten city
water specs. All of them had bacteria ranges in the level of 1 per 10,000 parts
water (ie real low). Boiling to sterilize is a waste of time. Boiling to remove
volatile chlorines however is worthwhile.


If you have a big enough brewpot (see SS vs Al debates... :-) then you don't
need to pre-boil you're water, just boil all your wort and use a wort chiller.
If you don't well pre-boiling is good, but I'd say far from a mantra.

Hello,
I started my first batch of beer (a brown ale) Sunday July 13. I think I
pitched the yeast a bit early (the wort was not 78 degrees), but it seemed to
be doing just fine. July 18 or 19 I racked it into a second carboy to get it
off the trub (a friend who homebrews says it's too hot to leave it there). It
has not been bubbling much at all since then. The temperature has been over 85
each day since before I racked, and got up to 102 last Saturday. Have my yeast
all died? Will taking a SG reading let me know anything? (I forgot to do an
original SG reading, but the kit had predicted final gravity readings). It also
gave off banana smells. Is this really bad? I thought brown ales were supposed
to be fruity, and I do like bananas... When I racked it it tasted like it had
fermented.

Sorry I missed this question the first time I read this Digest
issue.  "Rope" is a really weird effect of certain bacterial
contaminants, where gelatinous filaments are formed, often
accompanied by a sort of oily texture and a lactic acid sourness. 
By almost any standard it's revolting, but it's one of the stages
lambics usually go through.  Some lambics never get beyond it.  In
my present batch, it appeared as if the top 1" or so was utterly
crammed with clear-to-whitish tubifex worms.  Within a couple of
weeks of pitching the Brettanomyces culture, it had cleared up.

Subject: reCulturing Yeast


Mark Castleman asked about saving a successful yeast.


I recently cultured the yeast from a SNPA bottle and have since pitched a batch 
with it (the batch in the T-shirts). Everything smells and looks good. When I rack 
the beer off, I figure on swirling-up and bottling some of the yeast-cake itself 
and sticking it, unprimed, directly into the fridge. I figure that if the yeast 
survived that sort of treatment before it got to me, it can take some more of it. 
So long as it's already dormant it seems it should work. 


That's how I plan to go about it unless someone here can show me that it won't work.




 -Carl `This is all conjecture, I've never done it either' West




P.S. The yeast was cultured *in* the SNPA bottle (after pouring out the beer) by 
adding progressively larger amounts of weak wort, then allowing it to ferment out 
and go dormant. At which point I tasted, flamed and capped it and stuck it in the 
fridge for a couple of weeks. That part seems to have worked.

Hello again,
   We went on a tour of New Haven Brewing Company, a local micro. They make Elm
City, Connecticut Ale, Blackwell Stout and Mr. Mike's light (made light by
replacing some barley with wheat and fermenting to only 2.3%). They use local
water and boil it 3-4 hours but add nothing to treat it. (New Haven water has
lots of bacterial problems and they use lots of Chlorine to combat it in the
water supply) They mash, sparge, ferment (at very cold temps) and then filter
(cold filtered). They carbonate in a "bright beer" tank with a stone that lets
them put CO2 back in, then bottle.
   One can't taste the beer there, they are afraid of suits. They used to let
people have up to 2 beers, but got sued twice and lost insurance once (in only
2 years of operation). Suit one was by a City Alderman who hurt his gums on the
crab dip at the opening party. Chris (who gave the tour) couldn't remember the
second suit. The insurance loss was strange. They had a homebrew club coming
in, and were having a small party for the club (a keg and some munchies). A
couple came and wanted a tour (they were not with the club) they were given a
short tour, told about the club coming in, and the couple asked could they stay
for the long tour? They were allowed to stay, and no one kept a real close
watch on them. When the party started, the homebrew club acted responsibly,
talked, ate, drank some beer. The guy with the couple drank himself sick. Turns
out that the woman was a secretary with an insurance company and when NHB
applied for insurance she told her boss "don't give them insurance they got my
boyfriend drunk." Now the brewery is applying for a license as a brewpub as
well as a micro so they can serve beer after their tours.
   Now they are having to fight Molsen. Molsen and Volvo are sponsoring a
Tennis tournament in New Haven and have paid all the local merchants to run
Molsen specials (normally few bars have it, it doesn't sell locally). They are
sponsoring a beer garden and concerts on the Green, etc. NHB has just begun to
advertise more, and are getting drowned out by the big corporation. Support the
little guys, buy local beer!

Subject: SS/Al covers


  I have been contemplating the purchase of a stainless brewpot from
Rapids, Inc.  Expensive at some $90, but I think it may be worth it.  On
the other hand, a s.s. cover for the pot goes for a good chunk of $ too,
somewhere around $20-30, whereas an aluminum cover goes for less than half
of that.  Anyone know if there's any reason *not* to put an Al cover on
a stainless pot?


  Re. boiling all your brew water:  I use municipal water that comes from
a lake.  The water quality is better in the winter than it is in the summer.
That's a subjective statement, (it tastes better in the winter), but it also
makes some qualitative sense.  Summer lake water has a higher and more active
bacteria level, and treatment requires balancing between chlorine and bacteria
levels.  I haven't boiled all my water in the past, and I've produced some
fine beer, but the beer I've made in the summer sometimes "soured" after a while
(months, usually), whereas winter-made beer hasn't soured.  There's a zillion
possible reasons for this other than the water, but it seems to me that if
you've got a way to cool and store the top-off water, it would eliminate a
possible major source of contaminants, especially in the warmer months if
your water supply is like mine.


  Still no response on my question of how much it costs to start up a brewpub
or microbrewery.  Anybody know?

Does anyone know where I can obtain a stainless steel fermenter with a conical
bottom on it (just like the pros!) that holds about 6 gallons??  I had this
great idea that if I cut the bottom off of a Cornelius Keg, and welded a 
stainless funnel on the bottom, I would have just what I need.  The trouble
was that I could not find a funnel large enough.  A custom funnel costs about
$250.  Anyhow, you get the idea of what I'm looking for.  Any suggestions where
to find it??

Try the lid from a wok.  You should be able to get away with a small lip
around the inside of the keg.  One of my fellow Maltose Falcons (NOT Darryl
Richman!) made a fluid level indicator for his keg out of a toilet bowl float
so that he didn't have to stand on a ladder to check it.  I haven't started
building my 15 gal. setup yet.


I haven't made the index of HB digests for June yet since I am missing some. 
Did anyone get a whole no. 667?  I saw references about Europe.  I am going to
beer heaven (Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Denmark) next month.


I was able to get a 10 deg. F. drop in temperature using the wet T-shirt
method.  The upside-down jug is a good idea for refilling the tub with water. 
I used a fan several feet away to help the effect.  Puting the fan too close
causes the shirt to dry up faster than it can wick.

Subject: Area Homebrew Clubs?


Someone mentioned a trip to the microbrewery in NJ.  I was wondering where the
local homebrew clubs are in the SE and Central PA area (Reading & State College
if that helps.)?  Also...any news on what's tapping at the PA Micro's??  I'd
like to try to "make my rounds" before returning to school in August...anything
really good out there (besides the Beer Fest going on now at Stoudt's up the
road 7mi. in Adamstown)?

Subject: Beer tasting in Boston


While listening to the radio this weekend, I heard an
advertisment for a beer tasting, sponsored by WBUR (Boston).
The date is Thursday August 15, and the cost is 30
bucks.  It will run from 6 to 10, and is supposed to
be the largest beer tasting on the East Coast this 
year.  Brewers from every New England state except
Rhode Island will be present.  (I wonder why Hope is not
involved...) Also, several restraunts and snack food 
companies will be offering their wares.
The location is 808 Commonwealth Ave. Boston.


You can order tickets in advance by calling WBUR at 
(617)353-3800 and using your MC / Visa card. They recommend
buying tickets in advance.


EMail me if you're interested; maybe we can get a whole gang
of homebrewers together.

Subject: Kegging Question






        I now have obtained a root beer keg from the local pepsi distributor,
what I'm wondering is what I'll have to do to get this baby in action ??  The
keg has two fittings, each fitting has 3 pegs on it and a valve on the top that
goes in when you push on it (such technical terms !!). Can I go to the local
hardware store and get what I'll need to attach the CO2 and the tapper or will
I have to go back to the distibutor and get the pieces I need ??


        On a side note has anyone had the Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager yet,
I wasn't real impressed but maybe it's just me. If at first your not happy,
drink it, drink it again !!

I would like to get my hands on this but can't find it on mthvax at Miami.
Can anyone point me to an archive site FTP'able from Aus. where I may pick
it up? My last few brews have varied from what was intended so feel the need
to tighten up my recipe formulations.

Greetings!
I am about to attempt my first batch and would like to trouble the experts
for a little advice before I forge blindly ahead.  I have been reading
the Digest (and anything else I can find) for about two months now and
have poured over so much info that it is becoming a bit muddled!  Any advice
would be greatly appreciated.
I purchased a "starter kit" from the best-known local supplier (read only
local supplier) and got everything but a glass carboy (I know...the Digest's
Beginner file recommends one. I guess I just got so caught up in the excitement
of it all I forgot).  Anyway, the supplier suggests I forgo secondary fermen-
tation in the carboy by priming the bottles.  I know I have read opinions
regarding this here before, but forget what the concensus was.  Should I 
take the slightly more complicated route and procure a carboy first, or
is simplicity worth the cost in flavor for the first batch?  I have a hopped
malt extract (IRONMASTER Brown Ale) to keep it simple, but should I also
add some finishing hops or is that getting a bit too esoteric for a first
batch?  Another concern is that I live in the desert.  The days are about
105 degrees right now and keeping the house at 65 degrees for aging the 
bottled brew would raise the per bottle cost beyond reason.  Is 78 - 80 degrees
OK or will it ruin the quality of the beer?


Thanks in advance for any help.  This Digest has been the single greatest
inducement for my interest in homebrewing...thanks to all involved!


Frank

Subject: Re: making malt


I suspect that it's not practical to make barley malt in the home,
but there are people who would disagree.  One home soda/wine/beer
book advises doing just that thing.


I have made wheat malt, but just a couple of pounds to flavor some
beer.  Buy whole wheat at the health food store, cover it with water
and let it sit in the sun for a couple of days to start sprouting.
Dry in the oven at low temperature, stirring regularly.  Grind and
use in the mash.


Lots of trouble.  Add in oven and labor and it's cheaper to buy it.
