Subject: fruit in beer




Regarding the request on berries (beeries;') in beer, or for than matter
any fruits. I would think that somewhere between 5 - 10lbs. of fruit
would be a good starting point, keeping in mind the strength of the 
fruit flavor, and the beer flavor. 
For example, Cherries in the Snow, has 10lbs of sour cherries, 
but their flavor is not that strong.
 I believe that boiling most fruits would be bad, because this would set the
pectin in it, and cause haze problems (or jelly). At the end of the boil,
turn off the heat, wait a few minutes, and add the crushed fruit, and steep 
for 15-30minutes, leave the fruit in the primary.
 NOTE: I also believe most larger fruits ike peaches, plums should be peeled
because the skins have some pretty bitter stuff in them. This is easily done
if you scald them in boiling water for a few minutes.

Subject: $$ for micro/brewpub


Well, someone asked me to post the results of my survey of startup costs
for a microbrewery/brewpub.  So here they are:  Costs range from "A few
thousand" well into the millions.  The general consensus was that it would
take between $200 to 300K.  Big bucks. It seems that it is possible to save $$
by manufacturing your own equipment and/or buying it used.  Renovating a
building is a major cost.  Making a super-yuppie fern bar with mahogany
et al. is a major cost.  Wanting to compete with the bigger micros. will
cost you more in equipment.  It is very easy to spend alot of money very
quickly.  It is not very easy to get people (ie. banks) to give you the money.
Brewpubs/micros are still often considered fads, and restaraunts and bars
are not the most secure investment anyway.  The most important piece of
advice I received is to plan well, then plan well again, and always plan on 
being a businessman first and a brewer second.  That takes alot of the fun
out of it, but that's the way it is.  It's very similar to playing music
for a living; it's supposed to be fun, but in fact you spend alot of effort
being a businessman, in support of the fun of actually playing.  Keeping the
business in line allows you the freedom to enjoy your art/science.


Hey Darryl, speaking of used equipment, what's the chance of me picking up
some used oak casks from the Pilsner Urquell brewery?

Put the hops in a hop bag. They're pretty cheap, and you can get disposable

I use the nylon ones for all my hopping and they keep things neat.


(You could always just use cheesecloth, or probably nylon)

Try tying a copper (or stainless) wound pot scrubber around the pick-up tube

difficult to clog.

No personal experience but the consensus is thumbs down.  Old soda

a CO2 keg but in the end you will be much more pleased with them.

Holding and regulating the pressure are the most common complaints

Greg Noonan recommends 1/4 c. slurry per 5 gallon batch.


>What are the flavor repercussions?


I'm not sure about this one but I think excessive esters will be 
produced in a too rapid fermentation.


>Are there any warning signs?


Yeah, beer foaming all over the place.  Fermentation over in a couple 
of days.


>If I pitch a whole lot-o-yeast, should I not aerate so much?


You can't aerate too much unless you're shooting straight O2 into the 
cooled wort.  The beautifully simple suggestion of drilling an 1/8" 
(or two?) hole towards the end of the siphon hose sounds like the way 
to go.  It wouldn't hurt to slosh the beer around in the fermenter as 
well.


Do this to cool wort, though. As Martin Lodahl pointed out a couple of 
months ago, one should not try aerating warm or hot wort. 


>Does overpitching cause `yeast bite'?


I don't know.  I've never tasted anything like 'yeast bite'.  My dog 
bites.  Snakes bite.  But frankly, my yeast don't bite!!  Can't speak 
for anyone else's though.  :-)


>If not, what does cause it?


Who knows.  Methinks it's a myth.

Don't know what it tastes like but it hurts like hell.

No.  I think the scars are there for life.


Mal Card asks:


  There is a 20 quart stainless steel pot (light guage) on
  sale at Lechmere's for $27.00. Usually only $35.00.


  Would this this be an adequate size for an all-grain brew?
  Or is all-grain boiling as subject to boilovers as extract
  boiling?


20 quarts (5 gallons) just isn't big enough.  You'll boil away a 
gallon of liquid and have a gallon of trub left in the bottom of the 
kettle when you make an all-grain beer.  7 gallons is a minimum as far 
as convenience goes.  You can get away with 6 gallons by topping up at 
the end of the boil.

Much ink has been spilled and many terminal keys tapped on this one.  
Some say you should cool the wort down as far as you can to increase 
the cold break as much as possible and pitch.  This will definitely 
increase the lag time, though, as you are finding out.  IF you have 
been your usual scrupulously clean and sterile self, a long lag phase 
won't hurt the beer.


The other camp (and the one I subscribe to) is cool the wort to 70 
degrees and pitch.  Yeast propogates quite rapidly at 70 degrees and 
fermentation is likely to get off to a quick and rapid start.  After 
pitching, wait a few hours, and put the fermenter in the fridge.  By 
the time the wort cools to fermenting temperature, the yeast will be 
up and running.

I think this is correct if I remember my chemistry correctly.  I'll double check tonight
just to make sure.  


OK, for a solid disolved in some liquid:


ppm = (10^6 * wsolid * awliquid * m)/(awsolid * wliquid)


where


10^6 = 1,000,000
wsolid = weight of solid in grams
awliquid = atomic wieght of the liquid. This is 18 for water if I remember correctly.
m = number of atoms or molecules of the thing you are interested in that a given solid
         contributes to solution per molecule of the solid (this is important
        for salts, which is mainly what we are interested in in checking the chemistry of the
        brew water.  For instance if you are adding CaCl2 to water m would be 1 when calculating 
        ppm for Ca but would be 2 when calculating ppm for Cl.  (This has an official term
        but I can't remember it, molality maybe?)
awsolid = atomic weight of solid (your on your own with this one, get a periodic chart).
wliquid = weight of liquid in grams (1 cc of water weighs 1 gram at 4 degrees C).


If any of the above is incorrect, please let me know.  If anyone wants the derivation of the
above equation let me know, I'll send it to them.

Sure!  To convert from PPM to mg/l, just multiply by 1.0.  To convert
from mg/l to PPM, divide by 1.0.  Or is it the other way around ... ? :-)


No, seriously folks ... for all practical purposes, the two units of

Yes, I just started brewing this year, and since I am lazy I knew
from the start that I wasn't willing to bottle.  I borrowed a friend's
copy of Zymurgy, and saw the advertisement for the beer sphere.  Mark
Fritz was the name of the company, in Potsdam, NY...although they
answered the phone by a different name the last time I called.
I called up and ordered the home draft system for $180 because it sounded
like a good price to me.  That consisted of a batch latch (which mounts
on the top of a party ball making it reusable), a 5.2gal ball, a 5lb
CO2 tank (filled), regulator, plus all the necessary hoses, etc.  
Additional batch latches are overpriced at $19.95 each, but I got one
a few weeks later in order to have multiple batches going.  You also
need disposable seals for each batch of beer, at a cost of about $1 each.
These are punctured when you tap the ball.  I bought a ball of Coors
(yech, I gave the beer to a friend for his birthday) and the system
works well that reclaimed ball.


I have no complaints about the system; it works well.  However, I think
now that for the same money I could have gotten more sturdy kegs than
the party balls.


> How do the beer balls compare to soda kegs?


Since I haven't used soda kegs, I can't answer this, except to say
that it seems to me that the soda kegs are a more convenient shape,
plus they have the handles on top.

1) Use the shift key on your keyboard.  Capiatalized, mixed-case prose is 
easier to read.  Capital letters act like fining agents - they attract the 
hops, allowing cleaner siphoning ;-)


2) Put your dry hops in a mesh bag.  No hops will get into the siphon.  The
problem with this is that you might have problems removing the bag from the 
carboy.  I solve this problem by doing my dry hopping in a Cornelluis keg.

buy one because of the problems he mentions.  However, I did pay $50
for the stainless unit that Scott Birdwell is selling at DeFalcos in
Houston, and I am quite happy.  This has big plastic knobs and the
beer/CO2 valve is a three way, quarter turn on-off-on valve.  The
stainless pieces have got to cost more than the $50--Scott wink-winked

the supply can be a bit irregular.  I suggest you go for it, as a

As far as I know, neither is better than the other.  The main reason to
choose one over the other is availability of used kegs in your area
(if you plan to buy used kegs).  I bought all of mine new from Foxx,
so availability was not an issue (not that I think it would have been

Are you using hop pellets?  Since I started dryhopping (last brewing
season) I would never do without.  My beers finally have the bouquet
that a SNPA or Sam Adams have.  I love it!!!  Anyway, I have always
used whole (leaf) hops instead of pellets for dryhopping and they
simply float on top (even up to 6 weeks -- that's the longest I've
dryhopped).  I still use pellets for the boil -- they stay fresh
longer.  I use a hop bag in the boil and just throw the hop leaves
into the fermentor after the krauesen falls.  I've yet to have a
clog or to break the siphon since I've started to dryhop.

   b.  1 gram = 1000 milligrams
   c.  from a and b we have - 1 litre = 1,000,000 mg
   d.  from c - mg/L and ppm are the same


   Please correct me if this is wrong.  If everything about making
beer were this simple, there'd be no fun in it ;-)

    Could someone please direct me to mail order places where I can buy the
parts for my first homebrewing as well as books? Does a FAQ exist for
this digest?

  I agree 100% with Marty's assessment of the Foxx filler. I spent
$30 for ball valves and built a pop-off pressure regulator and 
now after overhauling my Foxx filler I get decent results without
turning the air blue or needing any bandaids. But for the total 
investment I could have bought a different filler in the first 
place and missed out on all the fun.

   Sure, for a 3-3.5 gallon batch size. All-grain brewing is
   subject to initial boil volumes larger than the eventual
   batch size. For a 5 gallon batch size you will be happier 
   with an 8 gallon pot.

This is now called "London Ale" yeast by Wyeast. The problems I
referred to happened quite some time ago and Wyeast was honest
about the situation and withdrew the strain for several months.
It was reintroduced and in the 18 months or so since I made the 
comments quoted above I've used this strain
a lot, from Wyeast packets, after plating it out on dishes and 
from slants. I've had no new problems and have found 
this yeast to make wonderful ales with complex flavor profiles.

                            BEER YEAST
 
 Every book I have ever read and every person I have asked, says bread yeast 
 makes yucky beer but I have never heard it from anyone who has ever actually 
 tried it.
 
 I would like to hear from someone who has made good beer with beer yeast that 
 has tried bread yeast.
 
 In light of the fact that all beer and ale yeast are the same species as 
 bread yeast, I find it hard to believe that any residual taste could be 
 significantly different.
 
 I am even having a hard time believing there is a difference between top and 
 bottom fermenting yeasts.  They look and act pretty much the same, as far as 
 I can tell.

I purchaced a counterpressure bottle filler from DeFalcos in Texas (214)
233-7895.  I am very happy with it.


There is also an old artical in Zymurgy on how to make one yourself.

I got some nice glassware from The Brewery in New York (800) 762-2560

If you hate bottling go for a stainless soda keg setup.  It might cost more
on the outset but it will be well worth it.


>What kind of experience have you folks had with this device?


None personally, but everyone that I have heard of that had one eventually
swithed to the stainless setup.
