Well, the Boulder Brewery products are being sold on the East Coast for very
LOW prices. ($3.99 a sixer) and the stout is not as good as I recall it
being. The Porter and the Pale Ale are better but still not as good as they
were ten or so years ago. These are being sold with Monrovia Club Beer. This
is from Liberia which has been in a state of civil war for over a year.
Hows old is this stuff? It tastes good (sort of like Singha) but gives one a
headache. Is this like the San Miguel and the BamityBam (33 beer from Nam)
that was doctored with formaldehyde?
  The Monrovia Club is also being sold for $3.99 and there is tons of it....

In today's (7-30) HBD Russ Gelinas suggests "wet-hopping" in lieu of "dry
hopping.  I think, and this is really only an opinion unsupported by hard
scientific evidence, that any boiling of the hops will drive off some of the
volatiles.  And I think that the retention of these volatiles is a critical
factor in dry hopping.  However, Noonan, as I recall, does recommend using
some sort of hop tea to increase the hop nose in a lager at bottling time
(it's in his "Brewing Lager Beer" though I don't have the exact page
number).


Jack Schmidling quotes Leigh P. Beadle to the effect that extract-based beers
should never be boiled.  I'm not convinced.  How does Beadle propose that one
extract the alpha acids from hops used in conjunction with an unhopped extract.
It looks to me like Beadle is the one who should know better.


Boulder Stout (as I recall this is really a misnomer) is almost undrinkable
according to Anton E. Skaugset.  While I wouldn't go quite that far, I agree
that this isn't one of the finest examples of the style.  We (the infamaous
IBU) held a dark ale tasting back in February, and included in the tasting
were two of Boulder's products (there is that nasty term again, but in this
case it seems very appropirate).  Neither the Boulder Stout nor the Boulder
Porter were terrribly impressive, both seemed rather thin, and borderline
insipid; and neither was really very exemplary of the style one would expect
when reading the labels.  Perhaps they have changed the product specifications
since Jackson rated them.


Water, water, everywhere.  But the problem is what, or how much of it, is in
it.  I'm basking in the glow of this flame (too bad you can't can it or
somthing David, it would solve your cold weather ale fermentation problems).


Now, if Darryl is really Steve, my question is "why aren't we getting some
prize winning bock to drink at the IBU meetings?"  IB ergo U?


And, lastly, a question.  I've been wondering for a while, after reading it
in Noonan's book and more recently in "The Practical Brewer" about the formula
for calculating the pounds of extract in a barrel of wort of a particular
density.  The formulae, with minor transformations of the denominator, that
are given for this purpose in these two references add the degrees Balling
to the weight of a barrel of water, then multiply this result by the degrees
Balling.  After the appropriate division, either by 100 or 3100, the result is
presented as the pounds of extract, in either a barrel or a gallon.  So, what
gives here?  Why is the density measure added to the weight and then also used
to multiply the result?  If my muddled description is inadequate I apologize.
I'll consult the afforementioned references and give the full details of the
formulae tomorrow.

Subject: Hops, bags, yeast, & malt....


Dry Hopping:


  There should not be any difference in the out come of your beer
using pellets, leaf, or plug hops.  I don't think that I would ever
use pellets, but to each their own.  I have always used plugs and 
just put them into the secondary and rack the beer right on top.
I feel that one advantage is that leaf/plug hops float thus adding
another barrier to infection.  I also feel that leaf/plug hops 
impart a much better aroma and bitterness than pellets.  Sure, it is
a little harder when you go to bottle and yes you do leave a little
more brew in the carboy but, it's the effect of dry hopping that I
am looking for and not just the ease of the operation.  It is well
worth the effort and really only adds another 15 min. or so to the
bottling procedure.  As far as using hop bags in the boil and then
reusing them for dry hop is like saving your boiling hops for your
next batch.  If you use fresh hops for bittering then I use fresh
hop for dry hopping.  Really, it does not cost that much more to 
use fresh hops, it makes a better homebrew.


Hop Bags:


  I have tried hopping in hop bags and without and the brews without
have had a better bitterness and aroma without.  You all realize that
this is purely subjective.  After reading Dave Lines' 'The Big Book
of Brewing' it seems to me that more flavor of the hops is released
when they are allowed to bubble freely in your wort rather than just
roll around in a bag.  I always wondered how you get the hop flavor
from those hops stuck in the middle of the bag?  Any way, I strain off
as much as I can when I transfer the wort to a siphon bucket I use
with my wort chiller.  Again, I use plug hops so I do not have the grit
problem with pellets.  What leaf/plug hops the strainer does not get
stays in my siphon bucket.  Just one more of the many different ways in
the world of brewing a better beer.


Bread Yeast:


  Yeuck!!!!!  I tried this in a pinch one time and will NEVER make that
mistake again.  A most terrible yeast after taste.


Malt Aroma:


  This is a very interesting question and one that I thought would
bring out all the master brews comments.  Not being a master brewer,
yet, and only just finished my fourth all grain batch, all grain is
the way to go and it's more fun too, I will put my two dollars, inflation
is such a bother, in on what little has been written for homebrewers.
I seems that the German beers seem to impart that malt aroma and taste.
There seems to be a corrilation between this and the type of barley they
use.  I have a batch going now based on Papazians' Honey lager where I
substitued 5 lbs. of Munich malt for the extract.  I also toasted 2 of
the 5 lbs. based on Papazian.  I am hoping that this gives a more malt
aroma and taste, alas I am still three weeks away from bottling.  The
only other soulution is to experiment with all grain batches.  I cannot
see how an extract brewer could get more malt into their brew without
using grain that made up more than 50% of the O.S.G.  Just a thought.
Has anyone asked Papazian or Miller or Burch?


Last A Question:


  Please define what constitutes a CREAM ALE.  Another mystery of brewing.

Since the wood stove causes large temperature variations upstairs
in the (New England) winter, I started fermenting in the basement.
This worked fine until the basement temp dropped to around 50 (too
cold for ales, not cold enough for lagers).  So I built a carboy
sized cabinet out of 3/4" plywood.  It has a false bottom (with holes
drilled through it) into which I placed a doorless toaster oven.
The oven is controlled by a regular room thermostat (through a relay)
placed in the upper part near the carboy.  The oven control is turned
way down (about 100 degrees) so the whole thing doesn't over-heat.
It works great, keeping the carboy at a constant 65 degrees (or
whatever the thermostat is set to).

Subject: ppm -> mg/l


OK one last word and I'll shut up about this thing.  As far as all the
brewing books I've read, ppm is indeed equal to mg/l, no matter what I 
said the first time.  However, as was mentioned, ppm is not a very useful
measurement if you are concerned about the actual ionic concentration
of a solution (number of ions in solution).  For instance 1 ppm of Ca 
does NOT have the same ionic concentration as 1 ppm of Na.  Also, strictly 
speaking, 1 ppm = 1 mg/l only at 4 degrees C where 1 cc of water weighs 
(has a mass of, actually) 1 gram.  If you are interested in the actual
number of ions in solution, you will have to use the formula I posted
a couple days ago (similar to the one Tom Strasser posted).  As far as 
I am concerned, the total ions in solution should be more important 
than their weight in solution (chemically speaking), but as was stated, 
it is much more convenient to state measurements in mass/volume since 
most people can handle this easier, even though there is a simple 
conversion from  weight to number of molecules in a substance if you 
have a periodic chart handy.  OH well, enough said, back to brewing!


 -Bill Dyer


P.S.  Someone stated that 1 liter of water = 1000 mg, it actually 
          = 1000 grams = 1000000 mg.

Thats very interesting, because just yesterday I was trying to think

to me in a fit of insanity.  OK everybody, will throwing some oranges 
in the brew make good beer or will it just screw everything up.  I have

Well, IMHO (not IMBO), I have never heard of skimming of this hot

Yes, but the question of initial yeast population is a different
one (IMHO) than speed of fermentation.  The "lag time" is the
amount of time it takes for the yeast to reproduce and build up a
sufficient population to start the fermentation.  More initial
yeast, less "lag time".  Too much initial yeast?  I don't know.

I don't know as I agree with that.  My fermentations haven't
seemed to *end* any faster, they just *begin* faster with more
yeast.

Again, I have the same question as the original questioner.  My
understanding is that you aerate the wort to allow the yeast to
be fruitful (not fruity) and multiply.  Yeast don't need any
oxygen to *ferment*, just to reproduce.  So, if you put in enough
yeast, they won't need to reproduce (can start fermenting right
away) and won't need any oxygen at all.  (At least this is what
logic tells me, but is it right?)

                           MALTING BARLEY
 
 
 I am trying to malt my own barley and have come to recall why I gave up on 
 the idea the first time I tried it about 15 years ago.
 
 The germination rate is only about 30% which results in mashing about 70% 
 rotten mush.
 
 My first reaction is that it is just old barley but the 15 time interval (and 
 new barley of course) with the same results makes me suspicious.
 
 It now occurs to me that there may be a trick to breaking the dormancy of 
 barley.  
 
 Does anyone have any advice?
 
 Has anyone out there malted barley?
 ...............
 
 Am I correct to assume that when rice or other grains are use in beer that 
 they are malted like barley?

I can see it now, some malthead is going to put a fitting on the lid of 
his boiling pot so he can attach his counter-flow wort cooler and cool 
the steam coming off his wort, and he'll be careful that the boil doesn't 
get so high that it blocks the lid-fitting with bits of hops. 


*Then* he'll probably go and save this precious distilled essence of malt 
and hop aroma and add it back in to the secondary, or in an extreme case 
he might add it to the beer at bottling time.


Jeeze, it's scary just thinking about the extremes someone might go to to 
get a particular flavor in their beer. 


Why not settle for something simple, y'know, like a lambic.

The question:


Before I stirred it up I noticed that there was a light colored

Not that I can figure out how to separate them,

        My third batch of homebrew has been stuck now for about 3 weeks.
        
        Started off with 1 can M+F light unhopped, boiled with 1 lb. crushed
crystal malt, 1 lb. corn sugar, 2 oz. Cluster hops and 1 tsp. non-iodized table salt (I couldn't resist).  Final volume was ~3.5 gal.  I cooled the wort in 
about 40 minutes in the covered brew kettle in the sink, strained out the 
hops and spent grain while pouring into the primary fermenter and pitched 
Red Star Ale Yeast straight from the packets into the fermenter.  The wort 
was brought up to five gallons by the addition of 1.5 gal. sterile (boiled) 
water.


        The wort bubbled for a few hours the next day and stopped.  I waited
a week, siphoned off some of the wort, re-boiled, placed in a sterile beer
bottle fitted with an airlock and added another packet of Red Star Ale Yeast
to that.  The next day that was going strongly, so I pitched it back into 
the primary.  The primary fermented longer this time (about a day) before
slacking and dying.  The ferment has now been stationary for more that 2
weeks.  


        This ferment is nowhere near complete... Any ideas?


        I thought the wort would be aerated enough by the straining.  Even 
if it wasn't, I have picked up the primary and shaken it in an effort to
aerate the beer.  


        All help greatly appreciated.

Subject: Lager question


Hi


        Here's a question for all the lager experts out there. I bottled a
lager yesterday that had been fermenting for four weeks at 45-50F. The
recipe used 4lb of a John Bull hopped lager extract and about 1-1/2 cups of
crystal malt. When I prepared the wort I didn't realize that the extract was
hopped, so I may have used too much hops. I used 1oz of Cluster pellets in
the boil and 1-1/4 oz Hallataur pellets as a finishing hop. The yeast was
Whitbread lager yeast. Here's what happened:


It appeared as if fermenting was done. I was noticing no signs of activity in
teh air lock. When I started bottling, I found the beer was very gassy. For
example, when I siphoned from the fermenter to a carboy, the beer foamed up in
the carboy, almost like a head. When I put the beer in bottles (160z Grolsch 
with good gaskets) I saw bubbles rising in the beer after I sealed the botlles.


Did I bottle too soon? Is this bubbling continued fermentation? It was very hot
when I bottled, so the temperature change in the wort was great. Once I got
the bottles back in the 'fridge at about 40F, the bubbles stopped rising.


Comments. Thanx in advance.


E-mail is OK too.

Well of course you could do this, but the effect would not be the same as
dry hopping. The reason we dry hop is that dry hopping imparts volatile
hop aromatics (things with funny names like geraniol) into the beer. Because
they are volatile, they are driven off easily during the boil. By making a
hop tea, you will drive off the aromatics just as you would during the boil.
In short, hop teas are no substitute for dry hopping.


After careful research and experimentation, I have determined that :


        ppm = 42;
        mg/l = 6 X 8;


Further evidence suggests that these two quantities may in fact be equal,
but the program is still running.

Yeast autolysis can definitely wreck havoc upon your beer. Miller suggests
leaving the dregs from your fermenter out in the open to give a sense for 
unforgettable stench given off by autolysis. However, my understanding is
that yeast bite and autolysis are different phenomena. Yeast bite is
allegedly caused by pitching too much yeast, thereby largely circumventing
the reactions that normally occur during the yeast's respiratory/growth phase.
I read somewhere (maybe Noonan?) that yeast bite is more of a concern of 
commercial breweries, and that homebrewers weren't likely to encounter it
unless they pitched the entire dregs from one batch into another.


In any case, it sounds like yeast bite is nothing to *worry* about.

Amidst all the rampant confusion and misinformation regarding PPM vs. mg/l,
srussell`at`snoopy.msc.cornell.edu (Stephen Russell) says in HBD #690:


> But, hey, let's let Tom [Strasser] and John Polstra fight it out ...


Fine, I'm game.


First, let's review the original question that was asked, in HBD #688,
by rich`at`progress.COM (Rich Lenihan):


> Both the town and apartment water analysis report substances in terms
> of milligrams per litre but all of the brewing guides I've read talk

So that's the question: how do we convert from mg/l into ppm?  My
response in HBD #689 was:


> ... for all practical purposes, the two units of measure are the same.


Let's take a look at the "Conversion Factors" table in the back of the
CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.  Lo and behold, we find the
following (this is a direct quote, and the footnote appears in the
original):


    To convert from                to                multiply by
    ---------------                --                -----------
    ...                                ...                ...
    milligrams/liter                parts/million*        1
    ...                                ...                ...


    *Density of 1 gram per milliliter of solvent.


In homebrewing the solvent is water, and *for all practical purposes*
(that's what I wrote), the density of water is 1 gram per milliliter.
We'll come back to that in a moment.


In case further evidence is needed, I cite the following direct quote
from the Seattle Water Department's 1989 water analysis report:


    Results given in Milligrams per liter, i.e., parts per million (ppm).


Now, also in HBD #689, dyer`at`marble.rtsg.mot.com (Bill Dyer) came up
with a complicated answer involving atomic weights:


> ppm = (10^6 * wsolid * awliquid * m)/(awsolid * wliquid)


which was hailed in HBD #690 by strasser`at`raj2.tn.cornell.edu (Tom Strasser)
as the one true answer.  While there probably exists a question to
which the above equation is the correct answer, that question is not
the one that was asked.  Both Bill Dyer and Tom Strasser seem to think
that PPM means atoms per million atoms, but it simply does not mean
that.  In water analysis, PPM is in terms of mass, not atoms and not
volume.  Always.  Period.  Don't take my word for it -- get on the
phone and talk to the chemist at your local water department.


Now back to the density issue.  In HBD #690, Steve
Thornton <NETWRK`at`HARVARDA.HARVARD.EDU> writes:


> 1 liter does indeed equal 1000 grams -- of pure water at 4 Centigrade.


Actually, it's at 3.98 degrees Centigrade, if you want to get picky
about it.  And at 20 degrees C (roughly room temperature) it is 998.23
grams, which again *for practical purposes* is 1000 grams.  Do you think
your scale has an accuracy of 0.2%?


> You wouldn't expect a liter of Mercury to weigh the same as a liter of

In water analysis, which is what we are discussing, the solvent is
water.  Not mercury.  Not alcohol.

What matters is the density of the solvent (water), not of the solute.
However, this comment does bring up an interesting (but *for practical
purposes* insignificant) point.  The CRC Handbook seems to imply (but
does not directly state) that PPM is the ratio of solute to solvent.  In
that case, the density of the solute would not matter at all.  However,
sometimes the concentrations of solutions are expressed as the ratio of
solute to *solution*, i.e., solute/(solute+solvent).  In that case, the
density of the solute would enter into the equation.  But again, for the
concentrations involved in brewing and in water analysis, there would be
no *practical* difference.  Remember, at 100 PPM (a typical value) we
are talking about a solute concentration of 0.01%.  In a liter of water,
that's 0.1 grams out of 1000 grams.  You couldn't even measure the
difference at home.


Sorry for the strident tone of this posting, but when I am "corrected"
with unsubstantiated misinformation, it makes me grumpy.

heating pad isn't really big enough to "wrap" around the carboy.  I just
rubber-banded it to the side, set the carboy on a few thicknesses of towel,

to keep the beer several degrees above room temperature.

Sorry Bill and everyone else.
I use pellets for the boil in a hop bag so I don't have to strain
them out later, and whole-leaf hops (without a hop bag) for dryhopping.
The pellets disperse throughout the whole kettle and I would rather pull
them out with the bag, cool the wort with my immersion chiller, and then
pour the wort carefully into the carboy through a large, funnel.  The
funnel has a sieve in the bottom, which periodically clogs with trub
anyway (at which time I stop pouring, let it drain, and dump the sieve).
It would clog instantly if I didn't use a hop bag.  By the way, I think
hop bags (and grain bags, for that matter) are not nylon but polyester
(however, I may be wrong).

I'm not 100% sure, but I think that as soon as you begin heating the
hops, you begin losing aromatics, which is the main reason for dryhopping
anyway: HOP BOUQUET.  I used to put up to an ounce of Hallertauer pellets
into the kettle after turning off the heat, and let them sit there for
two hours with the cover on the kettle, but never got the hop nose I get
when dryhopping with an ounce of Hallertauer leaf hops.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what kind of yeast to use for

Root beer is/should be somewhat sweet, so there will still be
fermentables in the pop unless I use some "fake" sugar.  I may just try
a beer yeast when I make the root beer.  Better still, if I'm
motivated, I may divide the batch in two portions and try a controlled

   Maybe not, but it can give you a few ideas.  My brewing partner and

My recollection is that Papazian and Miller actually agree (!) that growth
(yeast -> YEAST!!) and fermentation ( sugar -> ethanol & CO2 ) are two
separate phases. When you pitch the yeast starts doubling every N minutes
(N controlled mostly by temperature and aeration?); by the time you see
krausen the yeast has reproduced about as much as it's going to and is
using sugar for energy instead of construction.


> are bounded by a single membrane and contain hydrolytic enzymes 
> (these guys react with water producing a weak acid OR base)


True in a close sense but leaves out the hydrolyzed party. Hydrolysis is
the reversal of a reaction in which two substances (frequently an ester and
an organic acid) were merged into one by squeezing out water, e.g.:


                           H+
        H3CCOOH + HOCH2CH3 -> H3CCOOCH2CH3 + H20


(acetic acid + ethanol, catalyzed by acid, yields ethyl acetate + water)


The most familiar reversal of this is called saponification:


        H3C(CH2)nCOO-CH2
                     |                NaOH
        H3C(CH2)nCOO-CH    +3H20  ->        3 H3C(CH2)nCOOH + HOH2CCHOHCH2OH
                     |                        -> H3C(CH2)nCOONa
        H3C(CH2)nCOO-CH2


fat catalyzed by alkali yields soap plus glycerine.


(Hydrolysis will produce weak acids or weak bases depending on the catalyst
and the ingredients. In this case the fatty acid will immediately react
with the catalyst (as shown), but the fatty acid is weak enough that its
salt, in the absence of strong alkali, will absorb H+ from (increase pH of,
