In HDB #693 Tom Bower asks:


> 1.) How do you keep your brew from becoming infected when dry-hopping?


I've been wondering this too.  I assume it is the hops themselves.  After
all, one of the reasons hops are added (or why they were added originally)
is because of their qualities as a preservative.  Is this right?

Subject:  Sparging Success and Mashing Advice


I saw the posting about Kurt Swanson's all grain experience and
the sparging part sounded familiar.


A while ago I posted a message complaining about murky sparge
runnings and I mused about adding a peristaltic pump to the
process.  Don't bother.  I think my problem was the sparge bag.
It did not tightly contact the sides of my lauter tun and I think
that the wort was leaking out the sides of the bag rather than
running through the full eight inches of grain husks.


I bought another plastic pail that fit into my first pail.  The
first pail has the spigot.  I drilled a bizillion 1/16" holes
into the new pail, and installed the new holy pail inside the
spigoted pail.  This makes one great lauter tun.  The first time
I used it I got bright and clear wort after just three sauce pans
worth of recycling.  Sparging still takes an hour though.  


I have used the new lauter tun three times.  Once I had a bad
grain crush that caused foggy runnings.  The grain was not
crushed enough.  There were many even uncracked grains.  This
batch did not run bright and clear.  The wort ran very quickly
through the grain bed and stayed foggy.  Watch your crushes.


I am drinking my original sparge bag beer these days and it is
quite delicious despite the lack of perfect clarity.  Don't toss
those foggy runnings!

Don't care what the textbooks say, I have always found the effects of both
temperature and pH to have relatively little influence on dextrin content.
A prolonged, dilute mash is a much more effective way of achieving a dry
beer, if you like that sort of thing.
