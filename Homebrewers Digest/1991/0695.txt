Amazing that it took so long for this problem to appear- if the first
character of a line is a dot, some (or most) mailers interpret that as
"end of message"! Thanks to Carl West for inadvertantly alerting us
to that bug in the digestifying script...The script will automatically
fix this in the future.


This digest contains all the truncated articles from 694.


Many of you have sent me mail complaining about the problem, and
requesting that I send another copy of 694. I'm sorry, but I cannot
respond personally to all these requests. In this case, I think
that everyone experienced the truncation problem, but even in
isolated cases of missing digests, please do not ask me to resend
an issue, but instead try to get it from the archives. I will try
my best to keep the archives up to date.

Yup I tried it in a gallon batch. This is how I found out what 
yeast-bite tastes like. When I try it again, I'm going to dump 
out about half of the yeast. Note that I was doing single-stage 
fermentations, so *all* the yeast from the first batch was `pitched' 
into the second and third, just `pitching' from a primary 
might solve the problem.

My local supermarket has started carrying a german pilsener called 
Bitberger.  (I can't see the keg, so I'm not sure of the spelling.)


These 5 liter keglets are a good idea for a social occasion where homebrew 
might run short.  I haven't tried this beer, and don't really want to spend 
$13.59 to try it before I have an idea of it's quality.  Anyone tried 
Bitberger?  Is it a decent beer?

While I'm waiting for my order of books to come from the AOB and deciding on my
next purchases of equipment (to do liquid yeast culturing, all-grain batches &
kegging into plastic), I have a few more questions for the collective mind of
the Digest.  A friend of mine asked if I could brew goodies like what he had in
Leeds, UK during his "semester abroad" studying at the University there.  What
I need are extract/mash recipes for a chocolate-colored Mild Ale, a Bitter like
*John* Smith's (not Sam's), and some ideas for a *sweet* (not dry) Hard Cider.
Any brit's or experienced folks have any info, I'd appreciate it!

To answer Kinney Baughman's query about the possible typo in Phil's Christmas 
Ale Recipe:  Yes, the second M&F amber malt listing *is* a typo.  Other than 
that, the recipe is right as listed.


I have a copy of Vol.2, #10 of The Wort Alert, the Hop Barley & the Alers 
newsletter from Nov. 1990.  Phil's recipe, called "Anne's Choice Christmas Ale" 
is printed there.  Incidentally, Phil also took 1st place in the 1990 National 
Homebrew Competition with this brew.

        Works great. Use a hop bag to keep the hops from
plugging the pickup tube, and boil the bag for a few minutses
before dropping the hops in and tossing down the hatch. Expect
to wait a week or two before the flavor/aroma changes much, but
this is (so far, in my experience) the best way to get hop
aromatics into your beer.


        Methinks you doth worry too much. Cold temperatures
may slow down an infection, but won't stop one. Alcohol and
healthy yeast will.

Among the many brands of extract that I've used, four of my best
batches have been made with M&F Old Ale Extract.  Generally speaking, for 5
gallons, 1 can of Old Ale Extract, 0 to .5 lbs of Crystal Malt, 2 to 3 lbs of
Light Dried Malt Extract (M&F or Laaglander, if it makes a difference)
1 to 2 oz of Hallertauer Pellets (boil), 0 to 1 oz Hallertauer Pellets
(finishing), 0 to 2 oz Cascade Leaf Hops (dryhopping), and Muntona or Wyeast
Ale yeasts.  (Warning:  As I have mentioned before, Muntona Yeast produces
quite a bit of clove taste and aroma -- I'm not very fond of cloves so
I will avoid Muntona in the future, but that's no reason you should.)


I have not used any of the other M&F products, so I cannot comment on them,
but just for the record, I wanted to add a positive data point for the
Old Ale Extract.  Notice: I had no stuck ferments (I never have, nor have
any of my brews ended up in the garden -- all at least pleasantly drinkable).

Tom Bower asks about dryhopping and sanitation.


I thought about this for a long time and then finally, stopped
worrying, took 2 oz of leaf hops out of the fridge and dumped
them in the primary (the day after the krausen fell).  I read
somewhere that, if the hops are dry, there is nothing for
bacteria to live on (dry leaves and lupulin oils -- that's it).
The beer turned out the best I've ever made and now I would
rather not brew than not dryhop (well, maybe that too extreme).
I have not had any infections from the dryhopping (almost 1 year
of brewing since starting to dryhop).  Relax.

I brewed this Christmas Ale las year, and I followed the first comment
above, leaving out the extra 3 lbs of dry malt.  I followed the rest of
the recipe exactly.  However, when I measured a sample of the final wort
solution (WITH spices and honey) it was nowhere near 1.069.  I don't 
remember exactly what it was, but I think it was under 1.050. I was 
worried that the brew would turn out weak, so I boiled up another couple
of lbs of dry malt that I had lying around in as little water as I could
get away with, and added it to the fermenter.  Then I let it ferment.  


Even with the last minute change to the recipe, this beer was great.
I only waited about a month after bottling to drink it, and it was fine
then and just got better as the year went by.  


I want to brew this beer again, now, so it will be just right for the 
holiday season, but the extra 3 lb question is nagging at me.  Anyone 
else have an opinion?  Does anyone want to do the math?


Thanks,  Chris

I've never tried pressure cooking wort, so I have no practical experience
with this, but I can offer a little theory......


According to The Practical Brewer (compiled by the Master Brewer's
Association of America), pressure cooking wort has been tried by the
big guys. It has its advantages and disadvantages.


The advantages are that some of the things that we want to happen during
the boil happen much more quickly. Alpha acids isomerize at an accelerated
pace, and protein flocculation rates double for every 4 degrees C that the 
temp is increased. Thus if you could get the temp up to 112 C, you could
achieve some of the results of a one hour boil in only 7 1/2 minutes. 
Furthermore, the shorter boil causes less carmelization of wort sugars and 
destruction of yeast nutrients.


On the down side, there are volatile compounds in wort that are generally
considered undesirable. Certain amino acids, if not destroyed, provide a
source of sulphur which the yeast will turn into things like H2S and DMS.
During an open boil, the sulphur is driven off as H2S, but it will stay in
your wort if pressure boiled.


Another disadvantage is that the accelerated trub formation causes increased
coprecipitation of protein and hop resins, which results in a decrease in
hop utilization. This is a big deal for major league brewers who are guided
by economic considerations. As homebrewers, we can laugh with glee and add
more hops. 


The Practical Brewer goes on to recommend that brewers who boil under 
pressure follow this with an open boil at atmospheric pressure, or flash 
the wort in a vapor separator at reduced pressure. Starting to sound like 
alot of trouble. (Honey, where do we keep the vapor separator??)
 
Having said all that, pressure cooking your wort would still be an interesting 
experiment. After all, the people who wrote The Practical Brewer have titles
like "Supervisory Brewmaster, Moosehead Breweries Ltd.", and "Director of
Brewing Research and Development, Adolph Coors Company"; people who seem to
think that any flavor compound is an undesirable one. 


Who knows, this technique may produce just that malt character you've been
seeking. If you decide to give it a go, let us know how it comes out.


Cheers,
CR

Subject: Plastic fermentation vessels


Greetings to fellow homebrewers and netters all!


I have in the past heard various stern warnings against using plastic
2-liter soda bottles and similar beasties in any stage of brewing (well,
they make rather silly fermentation vessels anyhow...) because ethanol
will dissolve the solvent used to produce the plastic.  I'm not
especially keen on using these bottles anyhow.  Since then, I've
discovered that I can get 6-gallon plastic water carbouys at work,
however, and it occurs to me that they could be extraordinarily useful
for home brewing.  I'd like to know if anyone out there has knows if
these are safe for brewing (certainly home brewers do use _some_ kinds
of plastic), and if so whether anyone has experience with them and can
offer helpful hints, caveats, etc. (e.g., are the molding lines big
enough inside to trap bacteria, what's the best way to clean one

ALCOHOL ABUSE IN THE THIRD WORLD


Widespread "problem drinking" is relatively new to the Third World. But
the health and social damage caused by excessive alcohol consumption is
already becoming extremely serious in most developing countries. So far,
governments seldom recognize drinking as a problem even though it now
drastically affects agricultural output, worker productivity, and child
health. Indeed, governments often promote alcohol production by over-
stating its economic benefits to the nation.


Many people see alcohol use as a symbol of elevated social status and
this belief is encouraged in advertising by multinational alcohol pro-
ducers. Where significant fractions of men drink, the whole burden of
farm work often shifts to women. Since commercial brew is expensive,
home brewing thrives as small, unregulated industry. Home-brews often
are made from the same grains used locally for food, thus competing with
the local food supply. In some countries, a third to a half of average
per capita income (excluding the informal economy) is spent on beer, and
more than half of all patients admitted to medical centers are alcohol-
ics or problem drinkers.


According to Lori Heise (recently of San Pedro de Laguna, Guatemala), a
few developing countries have decided that the social costs of unbridled
alcohol use are no longer acceptable. But home brewing is an important
source of income to some families. So instead of enforcing prohibitions,
some governments try to provide credit and job training to help the
people assume new roles in the informal economy. Swaziland is having
some success in school programs that help young people under 15 years of
age toward responsible individual development, which includes resisting
peer pressures to drink. According to Heise, the greatest successes are
reported where individual communities, with effective group or individ-
ual leadership, have "exercised this power to restrict alcohol availa-
bility or challenge public drunkenness."

Is there any significant difference between dried and liquid
malt extract?  I looked quickly at TCJoH on my way to work this

between the two.

Sorry if this old news, but a higher boiling temperature will hasten both
hop bitterness extraction and the hot break, so this is a plus if your
cooker is big enough. Beware of pressure cooking high gravity worts,
because this will produce a caramel character (could actually be
interesting I suppose).


Another use of the cooker is to extract hop aroma. Alexander's "Brewing
Lager Beer" recommends raising the temperature just to working pressure,
then switching it off and resting for 15 minutes. I have always found these
sort of infusion techniques to produce a more harsh flavour than cold aroma
extraction, probably because some extra bitterness is extracted as well.
Another variation is to boil under reflux (ie, collect and return the
vapour) by fitting a vertical water-cooled condensing column to the outlet
of the cooker. Even this method seems to lack something, suggesting that
heat disintegrates as well as dissipates hop fragrance. The imaginative
amongst you could probably think of other uses for the aforementioned
equipment, but far be it from me to encourage illegal activities in a
public forum ...

Subject: re:  Malt Aromatics


When you cover the pot while boiling you do hold in a number of elements
that would otherwise boil off, including large quantities of DMS.  DMS
will be scrubbed out during a vigorous primary fermentation also, but not
as efficiently.  I would wonder if the malt aroma you're noticing isn't at
least partly due to this DMS character, which in lower concentrations
can add sweet notes.  As the concentration increases, these change into
sweet corn and then take a more vegetative character into turnips and
cabbage.  In fact, a quick look through "Principles of Brewing Science"
by Dr. George Fix indicates that DMS at 1 to 2x the flavor threshold
(30ug/L) produce "malty lagerlike notes", and at this secondary flavor
characteristic level, DMS is a key taste discriminator between ales
and lagers.

Greetings,


Did anyone receive a complete copy of today's HBD (#694)?  I did not and when
I requested a replacement from netlib I got another truncated version.  So,
what gives?


In the truncated version I received, there was a letter from Justin regarding
his sparging setup.  Now, my question is "Are those 'bizillion' holes measured
on a parts per gazillion basis, or are they bizillion holes per litre? :-)
Seriously though, I have used the two bucket system for all of my full mashes,
to good effect.  With the exception of wheat beers, I always get quite clear
runoffs after recycling a gallon or so.


I want my HBD.


Ooogy wawa,

Subject: refrigerator questions




What types of refrigerators do people use for fermentation and lagering?
Are regular kitchen fridges built strongly enough so that the shelves
support a full carboy (I doubt it!)?  It seems to me that the ideal
configuration for a beer fridge would be some sort of horizontally
oriented box with a good solid floor, a shape totallyu useless for all
other refrigerator purposes.  A freezer would be OK, but it would
be better if the door were on the side.


I guess I could just wait until I win the lottery and then build a 
custom insulated chamber with a custom-made refrigeration unit.  I'd
probably set it up with a couple of different zones so's I could ferment
and lager at the same time.


Has anyone ever seen any plans for some sort of water-jacket heat
exchanger for a fermentation setup?  A friend suggested that thermo-
electric modules could be employed, but methinks this would be a little
bizarre and a lot expensive.  Right now, I've got a hokey swamp cooler
evaporative heat exchanger that lets me do ale fermentation, but it's
useless for lagers.


Oh well, I can't really fit a refrigerator in my apartment anyway, 
unless I got rid of my wife (hmm...).  I am curious though.

Subject: rampant infections


I have a severe problem that I hope somebody can help me with.


I have had to toss my last two batches of beer due to really horrible,
awful, slimy, foul smelling infections.  Well, probably not that bad,
but bad enough.


I used to produce some really good beer, but lately I can't seem to
keep the "undesirable elements" out of my fermenter.


I am not aware that I have been doing anything different from my
traditional procedures.  Most of my brews are extract and I usually do
a boil of only about 3 gallons, adding 2 gallons or so of chilled
bottled spring water to the fermenter.


I do the primary ferment in a 7 gallon carboy, and I do secondary in a
5 gallon carboy.  I recently replaced all carboy stoppers and siphon
hoses.  I sanitize everything in a chlorine bleach solution and rinse
with hot tap water.  I am very careful with my siphoning procedures,
probably to excess.  i.e. I do things like wipe around the mouth of
the carboy with a piece of gauze soaked in ethanol before putting in a
stopper or a siphon hose.  I'm getting absolutely anal with my process
and nothing seems to help.


Now the "Clean out the Closet Porter" that I brewed a while back is
growing some ugly looking scum on the surface.  I hadn't had a chance
to bottle it, but I didn't worry since, of course, I felt that I had
done everything properly and that I could leave it in secondary for
another week or two.  The temp. where I stored the fermenter has not
gotten above 70 degrees F. and typically stays at about 65.


Could I have a nasty infection in my kitchen that permeates
everything?  Could my bottled water supply (Poland Springs) have gone
bad?  Could my cat be spitting in the fermenter when I'm not looking?
Will I have to hose down my kitchen with sanitizing solution?  Would
an ionizing air filter help?


Help!  I'm starting to worry!  And I'm all out of homebrew.  I sure
hope that a fellow BFD or two bring some good beer to the next
meeting...  How are the Lambics coming Mike?

Could someone help a beginner?  I started a batch of M & F hopped
amber, which I've done before with no problems, but this time I added
about 4-5 ounces of ginger (peeled and chopped up in blender) when I
boiled it.  The next day no bubbles or CO2 smell/bite.  I was afraid
the yeast was bad so I added more.  Still no luck.  After 5 days now
it still smells OK (gingery) but does not seem to be fermenting.


What did I do wrong?  What should I do next time?
Can I save this batch or does it go on the garden?

Subject: German beers


I had the good fortune to attend a conference in Berlin, Germany.
While I didn't take very good notes on the particular beers that were
served, I never came across a poor example of brewing science.  All
beers were excellent pilsners.  Either at the conference dinners or
the sidewalk cafes.  One of the interesting features of the way they
server beers: Apparently the length of time it takes to pour a beer is
a measure of the quality of the beer and the bartender.  It takes
anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes to poor a good beer.  (You have to wait
for the head to die down before you can continue to fill the glass!)
So my question to this list is: How long does it take _you_ to pour a
beer?


On the way through Frankfurt am Main, I was able to sample an
interesting "brew" called apfelwein.  This apple wine was interesting
with a sharp aftertaste, but not of hops.  I had to sample another
just to be sure and realize that this too was a good taste of Germany.


Tschuess!
