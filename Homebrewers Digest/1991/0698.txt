Subject: RE: Oatmeal Stout Recipe


I don't know how this recipe is, as I haven't started brewing yet,
but it was posted a few months ago.  (I save all recipes in the
hopes that one day I'll be able to try them all. :-) 


I hope it's a good one.  Let me know.  And, to whoever originally
posted this, thanks!  






        8lb British Amber Malt Extract
        0.5lb Plack Patent grain (cracked)
        0.5lb roasted barley (cracked)
        0.5lb Chocolate Malt grain (cracked)
        1lb Steel Cut Oats
        2oz Eroica (boil)
        1oz Fuggles (finishing)
        Whitbread ale yeast


Procedure:


Crack all grains (except the oats), add to about 2 gal cold water (incl 
oats), bring to a boil (my table top range takes almost an hour to do
this). Remove the grains with a strainer when boiling and add the malt 
extract and boiling hops. Boil for an hour. Add the finishing hops and 
continue boil for a minute or two. Turn off heat and let steep for 15min. 
Put about 4-6" of ice into a plastic bin and strain the wort into it. 
Sparge.  Bring up to volume (5.25 gal) with cold water and mix well.
I find that the temp by now is down enough to pitch (i.e. <80F). Rack into
6gal glass carboy and pitch the yeast (I just throw in the dry stuff).
Use a blow off tube for the first couple of days! I.e. A plastic tube from
the carboy into a jar of water. Bottle when the fermentation is done
(usually 2-3 weeks).


NOTE: Quaker Oats can be substituted for steel cut oats.

Greetings fellow brewers,


We seem to be recycling on some topics lately.  In the interest of advancing
the discussion, I thought that a few thumbrules might be useful.  So here
goes:


1.  If you buy liquid yeast cultures, make a starter.


2.  If you are going to be travelling buy Michael Jackson's "Pocket Guide
    to Beer."


3.  Homebrew can't make you sick; but drinking it can.


4.  Don't mess with John Polstra.


5.  There is more than one way to dry hop a beer, your mileage may vary.


6.  Don't touch Rodney's beer.


7.  Singha is a Thai beer.


8.  Optimal storage of dried yeast is at someone else's house; that way you
    won't be tempted to use any.

Here in Davis there's a brewpub called Sudwerks, which serves traditional
German style beers. A pilsner takes forever to pour, simply because of the
thick, long lasting head. The beer is allowed to drop straight to the
bottom of a tall pilsner glass, generating lots of foam. The foam is
allowed to subside, and more beer is added until only about 1" of head
remains. No special tap, just the proper glass and good beer. The process
takes time, but results in an incredibly dense and creamy head. I've been
accused of having a dense head, but never a creamy one...

Subject: Pouring Times




     A comment or two on beer pouring time.  I studied as an
undergrad for eight months in Bavaria (which is, of course, where
my beer love comes from) and had a few German beers myself.




In HBD697 Kinney Baughman writes

There has been sombe confusion here, actually the case in Germany
is that the length of pour is a gauge of how good a *Pilsner* is,
not other beers.  The Bavarians are adamant about this, and have a
rule of thumb that it takes 7 minutes to pour a good Pilsner.  They
take this rule so seriously that many of them will actually look at
their watch when they order to ascertain that the beer is not
delivered in less than 7 minutes!  It should be noted that, if
another type of beer is ordered when the pilsner is, this beer will
probably be delivered in a minute or two, while the pilsner will
come later, after at least 7 minutes.

     I seriously doubt they do this in Bavaria for their beers, to
my knowledge, Guinness alone in employing nitrogen dispensing.
     I didn't spend enough time outside of Bavaria to recall
whether pilsners in other parts of the country are poured in this
manner, but I suspect in many places they are, Bavarian beer
standards have a way of turning up throughout Germany.  
     One place this also seems to be common is in Pilsn, Czech. 
When I was there, the server would start your next glass of *fresh*
Urquell at the correct time before you finished you previous one
(say, about 7 minutes before you were done).  The next beer would
then be delivered to your table at the moment you finished your
beer.  I found this quite enjoyable as the (1986) black market
exchange rate made the cost of each glass about a nickel!  Needless
to say, we kept our server busy.




> So are the long pours in Germany a function of the tap system or
> the style of beer?  Expiring minds want to know.


Well, I was curious of this myself when I was there because the
pour is almost exclusively foam when it exits the tap.  It comes
out very slowly, however, so it is not a function of overpressure
or carbonation.  As a homebrewer of continental pilsners myself I
thought perhaps my head retention was inferior which was why I
could not get this head.  Alas, while I have made pilsners with
excellent head retention (Kinney has tasted them), they did not
approximate what I saw in Bavaria.  
     I found an explanation I believe from the Braukunst (?)
kegging supply store in Minnesota.  The owner claims that the
Germans use a different tap which aerates the beer on pouring.  He
described a taste test at a Chicago Brewery where they use a tap
that can pour in the standard manner, or aerate.  He claims this
aeration adds significantly to the taste of the poured beer.  This
test so impressed him that he imported this tap from Germany, and
now sells it (for $47).  I have considered getting it, but don't
have the bucks.  I am curious, does anyone have, or know of someone
who has one?

P.S. - How about you Darryl, did you get a look at the taps in
Pilsn?

Subject: comments on US Guinness


I too love Guinness, and have had the opportunity to have it on tap
and in the bottle in a number of different countries.  While it was
generally good in Europe, the quality in the US (at least on tap)
ranges from quite poor to almost excellent.  There are a number of
establishments in my local area which serve it on tap, and my
experiences here as well as in Irish pubs in Boston lead me to
believe that Guiness must be fresh to have that incredible flavor on
tap.  Unfortunately, most of the places which serve it on tap serve
so little that the kegs become miserable in no time.


By far and away the best I've had in the states was in a pub in
Boston, where it appeared that they consumed at least a keg every
day.  This was only slightly off the quality I found in Ireland.
Locally there is a pub run by some Brits which has a nice range of
UK brews on tap, and the nationality of the owners brings in enough
other UK folk that the Guinness is consumed fast enough to keep it
reasonably fresh.  On the far end, another bar in the area keeps a
fair number of imported beers on tap, however 90% of the customers
drink MassiveUSCorporationBackwash(TM), and about 5% of the
remaining folk drink Guinness, so their kegs are usually worse than
the bottled product.


Also, someone commented on the foamy head/C02/nitrogen setup.  I've
been lead to understand that the creaminess of the head is a product
of the high pressure at which it is pumped (60 psi?) and the aerating
effect of the specialized spigot.  The nitrogen is used (I believe
as the majority (75%?) of the gases) because it doesn't go into
solution very easily, therefore it can be used for the high pressure
work.

        Hey, thanks you all for the mead recipes. I'm going grocery

        I think it's going to be a very satisfying experience. I don't
know what mead looks like, or smells like, or tastes like, so just as
long as the end product gets me f'd up, I guess I'll call it a

        (I know there are many people out there who have water
analyses done for their brew supplies, and grow their own hybrid hops,
and have gadzillions of dollars of beer-making equipment, and

you all, I apologize for my utter unprofessionalism. May I rot in a
land where fermentation never occurs)
        BTW, you can't get poisoned and like die from homebrew, can you?
Right? 
        On other things - the slow pouring beer story is fascinating.
7 minutes is a looong time to wait for a beer, though. I'd probably be

a stupid question but why do you all over in England drink your beer

Subject: Sugared Extracts


A discussion of the adulteration of malt extracts with corn sugars
has been going on over in the newsgroup rec.food.drink, and Paul
Chisholm of Bell Labs asked me to let HBD in on the secret.  I
started the whole fracas by making a cryptic reference to recent
research that cast the purity of extracts in doubt, and Doug DeMers
of Amdahl immediately asked for sources, and more information.  So
the following day I posted this:


The flap all began in Zymurgy, Vol. 13 #5, Winter 1990.  On page 15,
in Dan Fink's "Brew News" column, was an item describing a report
presented by Professor Michael Ingledew of the University of
Saskatchewan to the 1990 meeting of the American Society of Brewing
Chemists, on research he and his colleagues were doing on the
composition of malt extracts.  This research, a combination of High
Performance  Liquid Chromatography and fermentation studies,
disclosed the substantial unlabeled presence of glucose syrup,
invert syrup/liquid sucrose, and high fructose corn syrup in the
extracts tested.  They also discovered poor fermentation from some
extracts, due to a deficiency in the free amino nitrogen content
normally provided by barley malt (had any stuck fermentations
lately?).  In the presentation, they did not identify the extracts
tested.


I don't have to tell you what a storm that raised!  The AHA followed
up on it, and in Dan Fink's column (page 14) in the Summer 1991
issue of Zymurgy (Vol. 14 #2) they published a letter from Professor
Ingledew in which he said that they indeed were NOT planning to release
the names of the extracts tested.  They felt they couldn't be sure
whether the adulteration was done by the manufacturers, or by the
distributors.  They also felt their sample might not be representative,
as they had only tested 44 "lager" extracts, and no "ale" extracts 
(their terms).  They didn't feel they had the time or money to handle
either additional testing or possible legal action.  They also felt
that the burden of following up on the problem they'd identified 
rested with the brewing industry, through the marketplace.  Then
Professor Ingledew closed with this paragraph: 


        In spite of my comments above, I have complete
        confidence in the results obtained in my lab by
        my colleagues.  There is no doubt that some
        manufacturers are profiting from the addition
        of lower cost corn sugars to malt extract.


Well!  Where does that leave us?  Neither of the articles made it
clear what percentage of the extracts tested had been "juiced", or
to what degree.  And, of course, we have no idea what they were
testing.


I hope you're not too terribly depressed.

Since I am a *big* guinness fan, I must agree that how a guinness is pulled
makes a noticable difference in the taste.  Some places ( in the states)
turn the tap pressure way down.  This keeps the brew from foaming and reduces
the amount of time spent waiting for the head to settle.  But it makes the
beer taste thin and bitter, and of course, Guinness looks much nicer with a
thick creamy head.


We have an Irish Pub a few block from my house that is run by an expatriate
Irishman.  He says another problem with getting *good* Guinness is storing it
properly.  They have the same problem in Ireland.  Ask the locals where the 
best pubs are, because not all of them pour a good Guinness.  Interestingly
enough, one place to avoid Guinness is at the brewery itself.


cheers


Guinness is a wonderful brew,
but does it have just one 'n' or two?

A friend of mine at work claims he makes a homebrew, affectionately known as
"moose-heiny" for its resemblance to Moosehead and Heineken, the brewing of
which he accomplishes with BOTH lager and ale yeasts pitched together at the 
same time.  The initial fermentation is done at warmer temperatures, and the 
latter portion in a fridge.  He says he can detect some of the characteristics
of each in the final beer (which I have not tasted).  And the process sounds 
like a mix, as well.


My question is:  has anyone else out there in HBD-land done this?  Is it 
reasonable to expect that the ale yeast will take off during the first (warm)
fermentation, and the lager yeast will clean up afterwards in the fridge?


What think ye?

Thanks for the plug, Ken!  Yep, it was our club, the Gold Country
Brewers Assn., that ran the show, in conjunction with the California
State Fair.  And it was a BIG one.  Ken Buswell, Brook Ostrom, and
Jim Long played crucial roles in making this a superbly organized
event (I can say that, not having contributed to its success at
all).  And yes, I was a judge.  For about 10 days before the finals,
panels of judges  narrowed down the field.  No panel had fewer than
three judges, nor more than 14 beers, and all had at least one BJCP
participant.  The finals received a surprising amount of coverage,
and the journalists were treated to all the (ahem!) hospitality we
could offer, which seems to have borne fruit.  It's been a
long-standing practice to bring in BJCP judges from other clubs for
the finals, and the cast of characters looked surprisingly like the
group that did the Left Coast First Round of the Nationals ...


Best of Show was won by Ray Call of Stockton, for a pale ale --
considering the number of these entered, it must have been SOME pale
ale!  Congratulations, Ray!

In HOMEBREW Digest #697, Jay Hersh offered:

I agree with that.

And I would definitely include fungi, and am tempted to include wild
yeast as well.

Well, if it's THAT obvious, I for one, usually won't.  But it
usually isn't that obvious.  Gushers, for example, can also be a
result of (damn severe) overcarbonation, of otherwise harmless wild
yeast, or of mishandling.  I'd hate to dump a beer untasted because
it had been mishandled by contest personnel.

Good rule, if the contamination is that clear-cut.

In light of my recent experiences, I'm coming around to your point
of view on this, Jay.  I've been trying to give every beer the best
shot I could, but as my experience grows, so does my caution.


> Have you gotten sick from beers without obvious signs of contamination??


Yes.  The one that gave the whole panel headaches and slight vertigo
had no other sign of trouble, except a strange moldy note in the
aftertaste.

I have read that the incredible head is due to the fact that the beer is
dispensed at very high pressure.  It is also well known that nitrogen is
not very soluble in beer (the Rotterdam (I believe that's the name) brewpub
in Toronto uses a nitrogen/CO2 mix to dispense their beer because when they
used pure CO2, it caused too much carbonation).  Putting those two facts
together, the following is simply my speculation, but: I suspect that the
reason Guinness uses their special tap system and nitrogen is to allow them
to dipense at the high pressure without causing carbonation like Coca-cola.
I have not heard the 25% nitrogen, but for my above theory to work, it
should probably be mostly nitrogen and only a small amount of CO2.


Al the Speculator.

 Subject:  MALTING BARLEY, AGAIN
 
 I note, with some cynicism, Darryl Richman's comment in Zymurgy, that the 
 brewmaster of Pilsner Urguell seemed totally ignorant of the malting process.
 
 From the responses I received to a very basic question on malting, that 
 particular form of ignorance seems to apply equally to home brewers.
 
 The diagram in the article came tantalizingly close to answering my question 
 but left out details that could be used in action.
 
 As I suspected, in order to get acceptable germination, dormancy must be 
 broken.  He talks about three steeping periods and a temperature range but 
 leaves out what separates one "period" from another.  
 
 What happens after 21 hours at 15-17 degs that seperates this period from the 
 next 21 hour period or from the final 17 hour period?
 
 I have been experimenting with freezing, friging and steeping but surely 
 someone out there can save me from re-inventing the wheel.
 
 Darryl.... where are you?  Finish your article.
