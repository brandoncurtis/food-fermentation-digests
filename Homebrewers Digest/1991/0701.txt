As I understand it, the 'higher gravity' for weizenbock and dunkelweizen is
about what you get from two cans.  What is a regular batch for most styles
is high gravity for wheat beers.


This may not be %100 correct, I am just going by what I have been told by
judges when entering my weizens.

Subject: Wort Chilling


Seems to me that the price of extract keeps going up and up. To counter the
trend, I'm thinking of going to all-grain. I do partial grain brewing now
(3-5 lbs grain with 5 lbs extract, for example), so it won't be that great
a step. I know I need to get a 8g brew pot, I have a nice mash tun (4g SS
stock pot), a lautering system will be easy to devise (based on Papazian's
Zappap (sp?) system). The one thing that has me stumped is the wort
chiller. 


I had thought that getting a lenth of copper pipe and having a friendly
local plumber coil it for me would be a start. I could then sweat solder
(using non-lead solder, of course) some elbows and straight runs of pipe on
to the coil; perhaps using some flexible hosing and hose clamps for areas
where one might need to be able to bend the tube. I thought I might even
put a valve and perhaps a thermometer on the output side.


I had then thought that putting the coil of the chiller in my kitchen sink
and surrounding it with crushed ice water would cool the boiling wort
appropriately. But will it? Is there a way to figure out what the resultant
temp of the wort would be? I'd hate to end up with wort that was at 120F
and risk possible infection waiting for it to cool in the carboy prior to
pitching. 


Any comments, answers, etc are welcome!


Prost!

Subject:      Re: Specific gravity and fermentables




Russ Gelinas asks if a high-temp mash full of dextrins or a low-temp mash
full of fermentables will have a higher specific gravity.  I'm not expert
enough as a masher to give you an answer in terms of yields.  However, I
claim that original gravity and % fermentables are independent of each other.
If you add enough corn sugar to a batch, you can get the O.G. up very high
and still have a very light-bodied beer (like malt liquor, yuck) because all
the sugar is fermentable.  Conversely, if you add corn syrup or boiled oatmeal
to the wort, you will again increase the gravity, but without adding much in
terms of fermentables.  After all, the yeast can't assimilate the dextrins in
Karo or the glucans in oatmeal.  Adding these adjuncts (which I don't recomm-
end) will produce a syrupy heavy-bodied beer.
  Specific gravity is the mass of one cubic centimeter of wort, measured in
grams.  Any carbohydrate that dissolves in water will increase the initial
gravity, whether or not it is fermentable.  Body in beer is related to the
viscosity of the beer, which depends on the presence and the length of non-
fermentables (whether these are dextrins and glucans or peptides has been a
matter of intense debate in earlier HBD's)
  So, Russ, whether you mash hot or cold, if your yield is the same, your OG
will be the same whether it is due to dextrins or fermentables.
  Did I answer the right question?

Subject: Liquid nitrogen in wort.


Greetings,
        David Klein suggests using liquid nitrogen or dry ice for chilling
wort.  I believe, as David suggests, that nothing will probably be living in 
either, however the thing that I would be concerned about is what chemicals 
(or other debris) is mixed in.  One never knows what was in a nitrogen dewer 
in the past.  I know lots of people that have broken off pieces of tubing 
into dewars, and I've often seen bugs and dirt in them also.  Then there are 
always people (like me) who dip everything they can find in the room into 
liquid nitrogen just for fun.
        All of this is just something to consider before actually 
adding liquid nitrogen directly to wort.  But of course, against my own advice, 
I have put it directly into things that I have consumed and I'm still alive.  
So I guess what I am saying is you might want to think about where something 
has been before putting it in your wort, and that microbes are not the only 
thing to worry about.
  
G'Day,

I have a severe problem that I hope somebody can help me with.


I have had to toss my last two batches of beer due to really horrible,
awful, slimy, foul smelling infections.  Well, probably not that bad,
but bad enough.


I used to produce some really good beer, but lately I can't seem to
keep the "undesirable elements" out of my fermenter.


I am not aware that I have been doing anything different from my
traditional procedures.  Most of my brews are extract and I usually do
a boil of only about 3 gallons, adding 2 gallons or so of chilled
bottled spring water to the fermenter.  This procedure has,
historically, worked quite well for my extract brews.  I occasionally
do a full boil when a partial mash has been involved, but these are a
pain since I don't have a wort chiller (yet.)


I do the primary ferment in a 7 gallon carboy, and I do secondary in a
5 gallon carboy.  I recently replaced all carboy stoppers and siphon
hoses.  I sanitize everything in a chlorine bleach solution and rinse
with hot tap water.  I am very careful with my siphoning procedures,
probably to excess.  i.e. I do things like wipe around the mouth of
the carboy with a piece of gauze soaked in ethanol before putting in a
stopper or a siphon hose.  I'm getting absolutely anal with my process
and nothing seems to help.


Now the "Clean out the Closet Porter" (one of the few full boil
batches that I do) that I brewed a while back is growing some ugly
looking scum on the surface.  I hadn't had a chance to bottle it, but
I didn't worry since, of course, I felt that I had done everything
properly and that I could leave it in secondary for another week or
two.  The temp. where I stored the fermenter has not gotten above 70
degrees F. and typically stays at about 65.


Could I have a nasty infection in my kitchen that permeates
everything?  Could my bottled water supply (Poland Springs) have gone
bad?  Could my cat be spitting in the fermenter when I'm not looking?
Will I have to hose down my kitchen with sanitizing solution?  Would
an ionizing air filter help?


Help!  I'm starting to worry!  And I'm all out of homebrew.

  p.s. You can buy directly from the factory (mail order) at the

I've seen some really disturbing allegations that the beers poured in
some Munich beer gardens and at Oktoberfest are routinely shy of a
liter.  While there may be some rogue pourers who commit this crime, it
should be noted that at Oktoberfest several inspectors patrol the tents
with a notched stick used to randomly inspected just-poured glasses of
beer.  If a short glass is found, the customer gets it free and the
perp is fined.

 Whoops...


    After yesterdays submission about liquid nitrogen, I checked the good
old CRC, and checked some numbers. First (for what it maters) the T of
lN2 is -195 C (not -177 C) But, unfortunately, the specific heat it only
about 0.2 kcal/(l*degree C). The heat of vaporization buys a 2 degree
reduction in the water temp for 5 gallons water, and 1 liter of lN2. So,
the calcuations show that one needs 15-20 l of lN2 (4 - 5 gallons). this
is quite a bit of liquid to carry home. (or buy at 3-4 $ per gallon.)


     I also did the calc for dry ice, and found that about 25 Kg (>50 lbs)
would do the trick. I don't remember how much that costs though...


Well, it was for for a while...

Subject: oatmeal


  Steel cut oatmeal needs to be mashed.  Because off the heat and pressure
used to make rolled oats, howver, they (rolled) do not need to be mashed.
I made a stout using 1 lb. steel cut oats mashed with 3.5 lbs of pale malt (and
then added to 6 lbs of dry malt), and it turned out delicious.  But it has 
no head.  It's well carbonated, but the head disappears almost immediately.  
My guess is that it's because of something in the oatmeal (proteins? oils?).
What could I use the next time to increase the head retention?  Wheat flakes?
Barley flakes?


  And, could someone please send me the address of the infamous Colonel John?
It's time for one of those 7 gallon carboys.  Thanks.

Subject: re SG qq


   Don't confuse SG and viscosity. SG is density; dissolving sugar in water
doesn't increase the volume proportionately, so the density goes up.
Viscosity is a much touchier subject, but I would guess that green wort
with more unfermentables would have a higher viscosity---not sure whether
it would be measurable, but many thickeners are naturally-occurring sugar
polymers (cf cornstarch).
   I would assume that converting the same weight of starch to solubles
would produce the same SG regardless of the mix of fermentables and
unfermentables (dimers vs oligomers?). It's possible there's some effect
from hydrolysis of the sugar bonds, but I'm not sure which effect


        c12h22o11 + h2o -> 2 c6h12o6


will have on density (e.g., do the smaller molecules hydrate more or less
effectively?, does absorbing h2o reduce the volume by more or less than
it's expanded by increasing the mass of the solute?); in either case it's
likely to be very small.

Hello all,


Just recently I had the pleasure of touring around Washington state.
As part of the "vacation" my wife and I went through a number of
brewpubs in the Seattle area (thanks to the people who emailed lists
to me telling me where they were and describing them -- that
information was invaluable!).  One place that I missed, though, was
the Red Hook millibrewery.  One reason I call them a millibrewery is
that they seem to have a larger capacity and distribution than a
microbrewery would.  I find their ESB beer excellent (we had this beer
numerous times during our travels throughout the state).  Has anyone
taken the tour (apparently they discuss their recipe and methods
extensively) and more specifically does anyone have a recipe they feel
approximates this beer?  I would be very interested in attempting to
make this beer.


Thanks for the information

Howdy all!


     I was wondering how many out there have ever used Whitbread's lager
yeast.  I've used it a couple of times, and have been pretty well satisfied
with it.  However,  I've never done a test comparing it with any other
lager yeasts on the market, so I haven't been able to judge whether the
final product leans towards malty, clean, complex, hoppy, etc.  Note, while
this is a dry yeast, it was favorably reviewed in Zymurgy's special yeast
issue a couple years back.  The main reason I have used it, as opposed to
any of the fine liquid cultures, is that it seems to be a fairly potent
strain (even at temperatures below 45 F), while some of the liquid strains
I have used can really dddrrraaaaggg the fermentation along slowly.


     Anyhow, any feedback would certainly be appreciated,
                                                           Mike

My first batch of mead was also Barkshack Gingermead and I loved it. I have
made 12 batches of mead so far and my technique has changed quite drastically
since that first batch a la Papazian.


To start with, I only make still (non-carbonated) mead now because I find mead
to be more of a wine-like beverage, high in alcohol and splendid when given
time to age. I found that carbonated mead resembles Champale too much (anyone
out there remember Champale?) but this is of course an "IMHO" so put your blow
torches away!


I ferment my mead at 18C (65F) for 6 days in primary, 3 weeks in secondary and
3 months in tertiary. Needless to say that my O.G.'s average 1.090-1.100. I
use standard wine yeasts (Pasteur or Epernay) although I am interested in
getting my hands on a culture of mead yeast. I age my bottled mead in corked
wine bottles for 1 year (minimum) in a wine cellar which can be anywhere
between 10-15C (50-60F) depending on the season.


In terms of processing, I boil the honey/water mixture for 30 minutes and chill
it by using a counter-flow wort chiller. After this I usually add various
fruits to the cooled solution along with some yeast nutrients and tannin. When
adding fruit(s) I always add 1/4 tsp. pottasium metabisulfite per gallon to
sterilize the mixture and let it stand (covered) for 24 hours before pitching
the yeast. This is how wine musts are sterilized since boiling fruit will set
the pectins and cause chill haze problems, as well as ruin the delicate fruit
flavours one wishes to enjoy later.


I will post a recipe in HD soon to clear up some of the above generalizations
since I am preparing this posting without having access to my recipe book.


Mike


PS- mead IS an aphrodisiac!!!

Your problems are more likely due to microbial contamination from bacteria or
wild yeast, either a result of a less-than-sterile culturing environment or
from the source of yeast itself. One cannot be sure though without knowing
more about how you culture yeast and what temperature your kitchen is.


I had problems culturing Chimay yeast from the bottle until I got into agar
plate culturing to isolate single colonies from a potential background of
nasty beasties. I finally achieved success (2nd place in the Canadian Amateur
Brewers Association 'All About Ales' contest) with the following method:


 - inoculate 50 mls of sterile (pressure cooked) unhopped wort with 2 mls of
  yeast slurry from a bottle of Chimay. Apply an airlock and wait for signs of
  activity (3-4 days).


 - streak out a loopful of this culture onto an agar plate (do a few plates)
  and let colonies develop (3-5 days).


 - pick a single colony and inoculate 10-50 mls of sterile wort. I did this for
  ten colonies in ten separate tubes.


 - after 3-5 days remove 1-2 mls of each fermented sample and taste. At this
  point I was shocked at how raunchy some of the fermented wort samples were
  with flavours ranging from burnt rubber to eggs to a beautiful Chimay-like
  fruitiness. Needless to say I saved the later culture and scaled it up to
  500 mls to pitch into a batch of Trappist Ale.


Now I am aware that this may draw some fire from those of you who know that
Chimay is fermented using a blend of five different yeast strains. I have
obviously only purified one strain using the above method. Unfortunately all
of the colonies on my agar plates appeared morphologically the same but my
flavour analysis indicated that different yeasts were present, and certainly
more than five strains I assure you! Obviously there were some unwelcome
intruders along with the proper strains and a more detailed analysis (genetic
and/or molecular) would be required to come up with the proper combination of
strains...but to no avail, the ale was fairly authentic and dream inducing.


For those of you who responded directly to my posting a few HD's ago about
purifying S. delbrueckii and who suggested I prepare a letter describing agar
plate culturing, stay tuned. It's in the works but is taking a backseat to
*less important* ;-) commitments.

Subject: ship beer from Australia to US




Well, I'm at my wits end. 


I am trying to find out what needs to be done to ship a case of beer from
Australia to Sacramento California. There is a gentleman who is so kind
as to ship from Australia.


However, when I try to find out legalities and impotation, all I get is the
run-around from the US government customs office and the BATF.


Has someone done this before? Is it as easy as just having it sent thru the
mail to my house, or ?????


Please relpy to robertn`at`folsm3.intel.com, and I will post the results here.


Thanx in advance,

Just to amplify a bit, the English "Real Ale" people, CAMRA, who have pretty
much finished off the enemy in the most successful consumer revolt in
history, violently object to the presence of _any_ CO2 not produced by the
beer itself, preferring natural cask pressure to what they call "blanket"
pressure (forcing the good stuff out by the top pressure of an externally
applied gas. That's what those quaint hand pumps are for, and why the beer
is relatively flat to an American. A seven-minute wait sounds intolerable
to me. Well, maybe if the result is Guiness.....
