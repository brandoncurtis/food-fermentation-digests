Howdy fellow brewmaniacs!


    I had a first...my first BAAAAD batch.  I've been brewing for about
    3 1/2 years now, and was getting a little cocky, so I figure it was
    bound to happen.  Went something like this:


    After about 6 days (which I thought was a short fermentation at the
    time), the fermentation stopped.  S.G. looked pretty good...not  as
    good as hoped, but still acceptable.  Wrong Answer!   I  was making
    some mighty fine glass grenades.  The time came to open  the  first
    one of the batch...


    Glass and beer shot 20 feet across my house, peppering the walls in
    my living room, dining room, and kitchen.  On the way to the walls,
    the glass opened my thumb to the bone.  Yee-hah.  The mess was hor-
    rible, as you might imagine.  I bled like a stuck pig.


    The moral of the story?  If you're in the least bit wary about  how
    your fermentation has progressed...be careful opening the first one
    of the batch!  I just (very cautiously) opened one of my new batch,
    an oatmeal stout, last night.  Perfecto.  My hands were shaking.  I
    am very glad that I open bottles out (away from my body),  and  not
    up toward my face.


    How can I be sure that the bottle I am about to open is not a bomb?
    Any hints would make opening the first bottle of a batch much  less
    traumatic for me, from now on.


                                                Mitch

I use 10M of 8mm copper tubing (easy to coil by hand and lots of
surface area for the volume) placed in the kitchen sink under running
water at 15C. I syphon the almost boiling wort through and it comes
out at approx. 18C. It takes about 20 mins to do 5 gallons.


I've not done the sums, but I suspect your crushed ice water would
warm up too quickly - there's a lot of heat to be transfered!

Here is some questions:


1. What is Corn Sugar ?
   (Sorry for this stupid question but I have never seen this type
    of sugar in Sweden or the U.K. )


2. I noticed that Boot's in the U.K. have two different yeast strains
   Beer Yeast and Genuin Beer Yeast.
   What's the difference betwen them ?
   Is the Genuin yeast a real top-fermenting yeast ?

I'd bet on the water. Try boiling ~ 3-4 gallons a day or 2 ahead. 
Cool it overnite in the pot and the pour it into the 7 gallon carboy 
and cool to ~40F in a fridge. Also as a precaution, never add unboiled 
water (finings, primer, etc.). When racking to the secondary, add 
boiled and cooled to room temp water to top off.

something drinkable. In that case, you would need to re-pitch with yeast

I am somewhat allergic to potasium metabisulfite, as are a number of
asthmatics, I hear.  Some champagnes, labelled ``Contains Sulfites'' have
really set me off, so I would like to avoid using them in my recipes for
mead.


Wouldn't you get the same effect if you boiled/simmered the honey, allowed
fermentation to begin until a high alcohol level was achieved, *then* added
fruit?


To be honest, I did use the sulfite trick for my first batch of mead, and
it hasn't bothered me. Of course, subsequent batches without haven't either!


Am I missing something?  [Where's Cher Feinstein, by the way?]

Sorry Russ but this goes against my understanding of the use of oats, etc.  ALL
forms of oats must be mashed.  Any form other than oatmeal must be "cooked"
prior to mashing (just like rice and whole barley) in order to get the starch
into the proper condition.  The action of "rolling" oats (or other grains) to
get "meal" or "flaked" versions does the same work as cooking and they may be
added directly to the mash.  Adding non-mashed oatmeal to a brew only increases
the starch content of the wort which does not ferment out as it never becomes
sugar.  I believe Miller covers this in TCHoHB.


I doubt I have to make this request in this Digest, as I know I hear if I'm off
base, however, Please correct me if I am in error here.


Thanks, RW...

  Kevin's got a problem with infection.  Here's my suggestions:  boil *all*
of your water, including the Poland Spring water.  It can't hurt.  Cool your
wort as fast as possible, and keep it covered.  Use all new tubing.  Buy a
new bottle filler.  Use only squeaky-clean bottles.  Soak them overnight in a
bleach solution.  Boil your bottlecaps.  Wash down your whole kitchen.  Keep
drafts away when brewing.  Wear clean clothes when brewing.  Don't weed the
garden while you're waiting for the wort to cool.  An open window on a windy
summer day is an invitation for *things* to come into your clean kitchen.
I guess most of all, think of any and all ways for those *things* to get into
your wort, and eliminate them.
  The worst case would be to just wait until the summer *thing* activity
calms down with the cooler fall weather.  But that would mean months without
homebrew....hmmmm, I wouldn't want to risk that.   Good luck.

Dearest fellow homebrewers,
 
In case you haven't heard (and believe me I *CHECKED* past issues before
posting this for fear of being shot down in flames ;-) )
 
While traveling throught the Santa Cruz mountains here in California, Slug and
I passed through the quite little town of Boulder Creek.  Lo and behold there
on the main drag (Highway 9) was the 'Boulder Creek Brewing Co. & Cafe'.  Much
to our pleasure it was open for business (last time we went through Boulder
Creek they were under construction, approx. 9/90).
 
The beertender, Stacey (great name, huh?), assured us they'd been doing a
booming business since their opening in 10/90.  This was backed up completely
by the fine beers we tasted.  The first, a marzen, was INCREDIBLE!  The second
was a bock and equally incredible.  The final offering was a Red Ale.  We
didn't try this one.  The first two were so incredible that we each had a
second pint of the same beer.
 
As for the food, what a menu.  After reading it over it was easy to tell that
the proprietor knows what goes with good beer.  All I can say is GARLIC FRIES
TO DIE FOR!!!  Incredible burgers, we tried the cheese, bacon and mushrooms and
the cheese and avacado (*VERY* Santa Cruz-ish ;-).
 
Anyway, I heartily reccomend the Boulder Creek Brewing Co. and Cafe to anyone
passing through Boulder Creek.  We enjoyed it so much that we decided it would
be a delightful drive from our home in Mountain View on a lazy Sunday
afternoon.  It could also be paired with a trip to the Bonny Doon Winery in
Bonny Doon!  Anyway, for what its worth, there ya have it...

To all of you who felt themselves inundated with e-mail from the Cider list

I have received some scripts from Rob G (your humble HBD coordinator) and 
seem to have successfully got them working (and blew 1/2 a day, but what the
heck it's that or write PEX documentation Ugh...).


So now the Cider list is a 2 times a day (11AM & 6PM EWT....Eastern 
Whatchamacallit Time) in a digest format.


It won't send you empty digests (I hope :-)


After Cider Season is over I can drop it down to once a day, or leave it as is.
Personally I prefer the fast turnaround (and frequent distractions) provided by
the mailing list, but a few people voted with their feet, and I figured that no
one else would mind a digest format since they are used to the HBD.


So once more (Sorry to eat your bandwidth...)


To get on the list please do the following:

Subject: Brewing salts (CaCl)




Howdy,


My terminal has no editor functions so please excuse the typo's.


I wrote in last week asking about obtaining CaCl.  Thanks to all out
there to told me where I could get the stuff.  Since no one responded
to the article yesterday about the ineffectiveness of CaCl fotr
removing carbonate and bicarboneate, I thought I'd demonstrate my
limited knowledge of chemistry, and perhaps embarass the hell out of
my self in the process.


In any case, here's my perception of how CaCl would remove carbonate
and bicarbonate without any ill effects.  I've got c;lost (close) to
700 ppm of carbonate in my water, and only about 75 ppm of Calcium.
In order to remove all that carbonate my idea was to first boil the
water.  This would convert the carbonate (I mean bicarbonate) into
carbonate.  Whil boiling I would add a sufficient about of CaCl.  The
Calcium would go into solution as an ion, in the presence of carbonate
\would precipitate out calcium carbontate.  Meanwhile, the cholirne
ion that is also dissolved in the water would become volatlile and
evaporeate into Cl2 in the air.  So I would have precipitated out all the
bicarbonate in my water with the calcium, and the clhlorine ions would
evaporate harmelessly into the air.  Problem solvesd, and not b (no bad)
tatste imparted on my water.


Please correct me if I am wrong about the above chemistry (but don't
correct my typo's please!).  Miller talks about similar reactions using
Calcium sulfate, but I don't want to add all that sulfate to my water
which already has too much to being with (begin with).


The final alternative is to buy bottled water.  What a drag!


Thanks to all you who have a better knowledge of the chemical world
than I do--I'm ust a simple biologist.  Hey, better living through chemisty
right?


Adios.

Well, yes the sediment is yeast, but there's a great deal more to making
a Lambic than simply culturing the dregs of a bottle of Lambic.  There
are no less than three types of bacteria and three types of yeast that
conspire to make Lambic.  If you simply cultured the dregs, you would
get part of the flavor, but not all of it.  Get Jean-Xavier Guinard's
book "Lambic" from the AHA Classic Beer Series, if you are really serious
about making a pseudo-Lambic.  Call the AHA at (303)447-0816 to order.

Since corn sugar is 100% fermentable and dry malt extract is not,
you need to use more dry malt extract than you would corn sugar
when priming.  I use 20% more (by weight) dry malt extract than
corn sugar (based on what a recipe might say).

More CO2 dissolves in the beer when it's cold.  When it's warm, much of

also (which I understand are an obscure tap as well).

Subject: Thomas Jefferson, Fellow Homebrewer


Gary Varner, an old graduate school buddy, sent me this the other
day.  Thought I'd share it with the Digest.
- ------------- 
Today as I looked (for wholly unrelated reasons) through a copy of
_Thomas_Jefferson's_Farmbook_ (a facsimile of Jefferson's records
plus excerpts from many letters) I ran across some letters he
wrote regarding homebrewing.  They illustrate some of the eternal
verities of the malted beverage. 
 
 
1) You can never have too many good bottles on hand.
 
      "I am now engaged in brewing a year's supply of malt strong
      beer, which however I have no chance of saving but by
      a supply of quart jugs from you.  I recieved [sic] (I think)
      10 1/2 dozen and must ask the favor of 4 gross more [=576]
      for which Mr. Gibson will pay your bill."  (letter to
      Richard Randolph, written at Monticello, March 20, 1814)
 
 
2) Not everybody's a hophead. 
 
      "Our brewing of the last autumn is generally good, altho'
      not as much as that of the preceding year, the batch we are
      now using is excellent.  That which Peter Hemings did for
      Mr. Bankhead was good, and the brewing of corn which he did
      here after your departure would have been good, but that he
      spoiled it by over-hopping.  A little more experience
      however will make him a good brewer.  My absence in Bedford
      in the spring prevented our preparing some malt then, which
      I now regret."  (letter to Joseph Miller, written at
      Monticello, June 26, 1815)
 
 
3) Some people disagree with the German beer purity law.
 
      "During the revolutionary war, the brewers on James river
      used Indian corn almost exclusively of all other.  In
      my family brewing I have used wheat also as we do not raise
      barley." (letter to Joseph Coppinger, written at Monticello,
      April 25, 1815)

With all due respect to Bill's calculations, I brew empirically.
Before I built my immersion chiller, I used to make 2 gallon
boils and add 1 gallon of partially frozen pre-boiled water
and two gallons of pre-boiled water from the fridge at about
40F.  After all that, my wort was at about 75F, at which time
I could safely splash it into the carboy and pitch.

No, I really don't care if the subject heading is spelled wrong.


Well, I certainly got a plethera of responces to the thermometer incident.  Yes, it was mercury.  Never fear, I was outside at the time.  Only a little bit got on my sandwich.  The rest splashed into the pool.


Putting that foolishness aside, I recall someone asking about hopped extracts awhile back.  Nobody posted the summary from Zymurgy, special hop issue '90.  So, for those of you who have no access to Zymurgy, here's a treat...
