works great.  The only drawback is the time it takes to settle,
but when I get done with the sparging I'm already 4 hours into
the brewing process, and need too take a break for a few hours,
anyway.  Even if the spargins finally run clear, let them
sit a few hours, and you'll be suprised at how many husks
settle out.  I now recycle only the first quart or two of
runoff, let the spargins settle and rack.  My spargings never
seem to run clear until I add the sparge water.  The husks take
up a very small volume (O.K. I guess there is another drawback);
expect to lose a quart of wort, tops.


Has anybody noticed:
the fewer husks in the boil, the better hot break?

Subject: Beer proof plug information request


I saw a most unusual glass carboy this weekend.  It is a 5 gallon carboy,
solid glass, with a nipple molded onto the side about an inch up.  The
nipple tappers to about a 3/8" O.D. opening.  Immediatly, I thought "wow,
this thing is just the right height that I could brew in here and drain
it, leaving the yeast cake/trub behind."  Then unpleasant reality hit.  What
would I use to plug the hole while I am brewing?  I not only have to find
a beer proof material to plug the hole to a few weeks, I also have to find
something to allow me to drain this without spewing beer all over basement
while I connect a hose to the nipple (unless I just want it to shoot out and
I'll catch it in a bucket, kind of a bad idea for several reasons).  About
the only reasonable thing I could think of is to put a length of food grade
hose on the nipple with a length longer than height of the carboy and loop it
up so the end is above the top of the wort.  I am concerned about this too.
I suppose I could sanitize the inside of the hose and rig up something to keep
it closed and clean inside.  What about the wort/beer in the hose?  Would
enough yeast sneak in there for complete fermentation, or would I have spoiling
wort mingling with my beer?  That stuff would be washed out first and I could
dump it as I flush out my hose, but still, there it sits next to my beer ...
Not even to mention my concern over getting a slow enough flow rate that I
don't wash a lot of yeast off the top of the cake.


Has anyone ever used something like this?  Does it sound like a lot of
trouble and expense ($29) and possible contamination because I hate siponing
so much?  Should I just get a pump instead?  Any ideas, jokes, puns, flames,
personal slanders, spelling or gramatical corrections?  I'll be offline for
the next week, but I look forward to any responses.

I have read that Utah has a 3.2% law that covers *all* types of beer.  Even
malt liquors have to be less than 3.2% alcohol.  Seems to me that would make
for some pretty weak stouts.  Anyone in Utah buying Schlitz Malt Liquor for
the extra *kick* is just fooling themselves.


This was based on information compilied by the Beer Institute (formerly the 
United States Brewers Association) but is 5 or 6 years old (maybe more).

Subject: carbonation in soda pop


In HBD-709 Jack Schmidling <arf`at`ddsw1.mcs.com>, talking about
homebrewed root beer, says:


> UNLIKE ORDINARY BEVERAGES THAT GO FLAT AFTER OPENING, IF YOU RE-CAP

> RE-CARBONATE.


Is this because the yeasties in commercial beverages have been killed
by pasturization?  Or are commercial root beers carbonated by CO2
injection?

Perhaps someone can explain what happened here: Long ago, I left a
couple bottles of soda (probably Pepsi, but that was too long ago to
remember) in the back of my pickup when I went skiing and came back to
find them nearly frozen.  Since we were miles from nowhere and that
was all we had left to drink, we popped off the tops.  Nothing
happened - not even the normal *ffffpppttt* - the soda in the neck was
frozen solid.  As it began to melt, however, the soda started frothing
and eventually got to gushing out of the bottle quite a bit.


I didn't question why back then because this was the first experience
I'd had with soda that was that cold.  But Jack's scenario suggests
that the colder the soda is, the less it should gush.  Or was my
soda's reaction because it was changing from a solid to liquid?

Well, thought i would let everyone know what happened:


we served the beer and a fair amount of it got drunk, so it couldn't
have been *all* bad...


but, it is still bvery young and the root beer taste is there to stay.
i am going to let it sit for a couple of weeks and see if the tastes
have mellowed more.


the biggest thing that i learned is that there is more to making a
lightly flavored beer than just going easy on the hops.  this beer
could definitly have used more hops!


thanks for all the helpful advice!

Subject: decoction mashing, lauter tun temp.




I tried a decoction mash over the weekend, and was satisfied with the
technique and the effects.  Overall, I'd say it's a more involving and
more satisfying process than step-infusion mashing.  There's something
about boiling the thick porridge of grain that convinces me that
*something* is going on.  Temperature control is more precise, as well;
I don't have to put up with my stove.


My setup consists of an Igloo 36 qt. mash tun and a 33 qt. ceramic-on-
steel boiler.  The Igloo works extremely well at keeping the temperature
constant.


I learned that it's a big pain to undershoot, and that as much grain as
possible should be boiled for the acid rest--->saccharification rest
decoction.  It's easier to let the excess hot grain cool if there's too
much than to cope with the mash being too cool.


One question: what techniques do people use to keep the mash in the
lauter tun warm while sparging?  Mine is insulated, and when I 
recirculate I drain into a saucepan directly on a portable electric
stove element.  It stills cools off too much.

The implication here (that John Bull adds corn sugar) may be undeserved.  
Just because a beer is fruity or because someone attributes some quality
of "cider" to it, does not mean that there is corn (or other) sugar added
to the extract.  Dave failed to mention the fermentation temperature.  The
fact that the can says "lager" does not mean if will automatically be a lager.
What makes it a lager is the fermentation temperature.  A "lager extract"
fermented with a bottom fermenting (lager) yeast at 70F will taste like an
ale.  No doubt about it.                            ^^^


Let's not be too quick to "cry sugar."

Subject: Flat Cornelius, Gingane, and Magic


Heydie Brewmeisters!
        Wow, this newsletter is really getting huge!  I've been just filing
them away recently, and I was very pleasantly suprised at how very large this
has become.
        First a bit about flat beer in Cornelius (sp?) kegs.  I consistantly
turn out well carbonated, and sometimes very well carbonated, beers from 
Cornelius kegs.  The secret to assuring carbonation and preventing gushers is
to prime with low amounts of sugar or krausen (1/3 cup sugar, 1-2 cups malt
extract at fermentation strength) and to put on a significant quantity of 
carbon dioxide (20 psi or more).  I've heard some complaints about 'artific-
ially carbonating' beers by putting on high CO2, but to artificially 
carbonate requires _lots_ of gas (add 50 psi, shake, repeat indefinately).
The reason you're ending up with flat beer is that the seals around the 
central fill port require at least 15 psi to seal properly (the working 
pressures for syryp are around 80 - 100 psi) and much below this value will
allow all pressure to escape.  It is essential to maintain pressure early, 
since this is when the beer is still fermenting and building up a good level 
of CO2 in solution; later when the beer is saturated with CO2 losing pressure
is not as much of a problem.  If you end up with overcarbonated beer, don't be
afraid of letting off some steam with the pressure release and letting the
beer reach a new (less gushy) equilibrium.
        Schmidt productions listed a long recipe for ginger ale, and so I
thought I'd slap together a short recipe for ginger champagne (gingane).  
There are a couple of considerations....first, this stuff is high octane
brew (10% alcohol and up) and it is very similar to champagne (high gas
pressure) so I would ask you to be very careful with your bottles (use 
_only_ champagne bottles) or avoid the danger of explosion and use a 
Cornelius keg.  Don't let this stuff ferment out completely so it has a 
bit of residual sweetness to mask any slight off flavours...being made of 
sugar and ginger, it has no body to mask imperfections.  Fruit is also a 
nice addition, either with the pre-fermented mass or in the Dutch style as
a final addition a few hours (1 day tops) before bottling.


                        GINGANE ala RANSOMNIA


                1 - 2 lbs. ginger (yes, pounds!)


                5 - 7 lbs. corn sugar


                1 - 2 lbs. sucrose (table sugar)


                juice of several (3) citroids (lemon, lime, grapefruit,
                        or combination of high citric fruits like lime
                        with oranges)


                various additives (fruitoids, spice thangs, herbs,
                        hops, or whatever floats yer boat)


                2 packages champagne yeast


        Chop ginger (leave that skin on!) in discs and blend with hot water.
        Use plenty of water, then filter homogenized ginger through 
        several layers of cheesecloth.  Squeeze dry, then add more water
        and squeeze again.  Add water to make about 2 gallons, heat, and
        dissolve in sugars.  Bring to boil, add citroid juices, and 
        boil stirring frequently (to avoid excessive sugar carmelization)
        for about 30 minutes.
                Pour into fermenter containing 2 + gallons cold water 
        carefully (to avoid hot stuff on cold glass) and add more water
        to make about 5 gallons.  Pitch.  Ferment.  Bottle.  Drink.
                If adding fruit, do so 5 minutes after you stop boil and
        give it 10 minutes to pastuerize a bit.  Dump the whole bleeding
        thing into the fermenter, and strain off the fruit when passing
        into secondary (or just fergit the secondary and strain when
        bottling).  I personally prefer to make a fruit extract (blend
        fruit and strain off juice) and add the juice to the finished 
        product.  Remember to bottle before fermentation stops, and be
        careful about the priming (1/2 to a maximum of 3/4 cup).


Gosh, this was supposed to be a short recipe....ah well, my mouth gushes over.
        A last blurb about magic....  We've all humorously jibed about what the
phase of the moon, or astological sign of the brew party, or even bad and evil
influences does to your brew; I personally find astrology offensive, and I
think the phase of the moon primarily affects tides, but your attitude and
emanations (for lack of a word that hasn't been New Aged into uselessness) are
seriously all important to brewing.  Brewing has only recently been made into
a science, and like all sciences (I'm a scientist, and so I can at least talk
out my ass with assurance) discounts the effects of subjective (i.e. 
personal and non-reproducible) reality.  Beer is a mystery, and being able to
describe what happens chemically or dissect the constituents of a fine brew
does nothing for understanding the 'whats' of a beer.  Science is inherently
descriptive, and cannot say much about just what something is; we can 
precisely describe the behavior of something, but what exactly that something
is is still a matter for the philosopher.  I can say that I know the way I
feel influences the beer I make (to the extent that I never sanitize and
don't bother with secondaries) by making the living organisms that produce it
happy (for lack of a better word).
        However, I cannot put down in black and white how I do it.  This is 
the essence of magic, and unfortunately the above diatribe has mainly tried to
communicate to you the uncommunicatable.  I will end this lame monologue with
the thought that you really should think of your beer as an expression and 
extension of your self, not as a cooking project or experiment.

Subject: ???Aluminum Kegs/Mead/Chemistry???




Howdy All,


I've got a few questions for the HBD peanut gallery:


1) On two occasions I have kegged a batch of beer in Aluminum
Anheuser-Busch kegs.  They're pretty easy to get open, you've just got
to remove a coil spring on top (after carefully depressurizing, of
course!!) and the ball valve/outlet tube assembly comes out all in one
piece.  The problem is, on both occasions the kegged beer came out
substantially darker (more amberer??) than I had anticipated.  Darker
in fact, than some of the same batch that I had bottled alongside the
keg brew.  I've been brewing for a couple'o'years so I realize light
malts won't give me 'Bud-colored' brews.  The brew tasted fine, but it
was difficult to get some less adventursome friends to try it simply
because of the color (Rascist Bastards!).  My questions are these:


   a) Is the yeast reacting with the Aluminum to cause this effect?
   b) Can I get Alzheimer's from drinking it?
   c) Am I simply losing my mind?
   d) Has the yeast's reacting with the Aluminum given me Alzheimer's
      from drinking it and I'm losing my mind?






2)  I recently tried my hand at brewing a fruit flavored Mead.  I used
the following recipe (approximately) for 6.5 Gallons:
   12 #      Goldenrod Honey
    2 Qts.   Cherry Wine Kit (Whole cherries - pits, stems, the works)
  2.5 Gal.   Grapefruit Juice
   .5 Oz.    Hallertauer Hops (The beer brewer in me - what can I say)
  1.5 Oz.    Acid Blend
   Some      Pectic Enzyme
    6        Campden Tablets
    1 Pkt.   Mead Yeast


I mixed all of the above (except for 1 gallon of G.J.) in warm water
(not boiled) filling the fermentor up to 5 - 5.5 gallons.  A day later
I pitched the yeast from a 1 Quart starter.  Primary fermentation
seemed to go pretty well and after about two weeks I racked into a
6.5 gallon secondary.  I topped the secondary off with another gallon
of G.J. which I had sterilized (maybe?) by mixing in a couple more
Campden tablets the day before.  Well, it's about 6 weeks later and
I'm still getting a fairly heavy Sulphery nose from the neck of the
Carbouy when I chance to sniff in.  Well, here they come:




  a) Will the sulphery smell go away if I ignore it?
  b) Will it go away if I don't ignore it - i.e. anything I can or
     oughtta be doing??
  c) Did I just plain dump too much Sulpher in, in the form of Campden
     Tablets?
  d) Can anybody tell me if there was any method to my madness (no
     Altzheimer's jokes, please)?
  e) Any recommendations whether this Mead will turn out better if I
     carbonate it (which at this point, I intend to do), or would it
     best be treated like a wine??


Any comments as to the positives/negatives of the steps I've taken
would be greatly appreciated.  Looking forward to your responses ...

P.S. - Tim, was that 3 parts sorcery to 1 part fluids, with a pinch of
Chem. Eng.???
