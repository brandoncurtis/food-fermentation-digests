Subject: Central Mass Brewclub.


Awhile back I asked if anyone knew of a brewclub in the Central Mass 
area.  The responses I received confirmed that there are no brewclubs 
in the Central Mass area.  Extra extra read all about it!  A home 
brewers and vintners supply shop from Upton Mass is looking to start 
up a club.  So far there are 4 people interested and we are looking 
for more before the club is officially started.  You may contact 
Scott or David at (508) 529-6014 or 1-800-626-2371 if you are 
interested in joining.  By the way their prices are excellent and 
they are willing to get anything you need.  
Looking forward to meeting more homebrewers.  Greg.

Ok, if you go north from Iowa, you end up in Minnesota. I was right the
first time. That's enough of that.


Martin L., you may be right, I might be confusing Rapids with Carolina Bio.
Supply re. individuals vs. businesses.


I'm definitely confused this week.  Lack of sleep I guess.


I've got a half-batch that's been fermenting 16 days now, with Wyeast Chico 
Ale yeast. It's still in the primary, and it's about done.  It's also about 
time for another batch, and I'd like to reuse the yeast. F. Barleywine's 
mysticism aside, I don't want to just pour the wort onto the yeast cake in 
the carboy; there's a solid line of crud about halfway up that I'd rather 
avoid.  So I was thinking of bottling the half-batch, and setting aside the 
first and last bottles (to be sure I get the one with the most yeast, if you
follow my logic), and pitch those into the next batch.  Isn't that the way
it was done (more or less) for centuries, before yeast cultures were made
available?  Having the yeast in bottles would also loosen up the timetable
(somewhat) for the new batch.  And it does add a nice touch of that mysticism, 
sacrificing some current brew for the future (hmmm, vaguely pagan mysticism at
that, how appropriate).

Are you sure that it's aluminum, not stainless? I thought that's why

Subject: Yeast infection? (agar plate culture)


I snarfed some unfiltered weizenbier from a brewpub and marked up an
wort-agar plate with it a couple days ago. Now I find a couple funny
looking areas on it, dark blue-green in the center with white surrounding
areas looking kinda furry. I assume this is *not* what I want?


Seems kind of early to see any signs of life that I *want*; I would have
thought it would take about a week to see desired critters. Can I just let
it hang out for a while and see if I get colonies along the streak line I
made, or will the plate get infected by these invaders?


Anyone care to describe what a weizenbier yeast from Weihenstephen looks
like? (furry, not green in the center, etc?)


Thanks.

In Colorado, grocery stores are limited to selling 3.2% alcohol *BY WEIGHT*
beer.  I can't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure the other states that
deal with 3.2 beer measure in % by weight also.

These are the only ones available in our grocery stores as well.  Liquor stores
can sell more potent stuff, but not on Sundays. (Funny though, I can't
seem to find anything in the State constitution which would validate
Sunday being treated differently from any other day of the week!)


>My question is this- what is the percent of alcohol in most of these beers
>otherwise?


Well, first of all, 3.2% by weight is about 3.9% by volume.  This is pretty
close to the figures I've heard for the Standard American Lager, and actually
higher than the Standard American Lite.  Now this is pure speculation on
my part, but I'd wager that the 3.2 Bud carried at 7-11 is identical to the
"high-point" Bud carried at Liquor stores; I'd bet the family farm (if there
was one) that Bud Lite is the same at both localities.  From personal experience,
I got just as drunk in college drinking 3.2 beer as I did drinking the stuff
from Liquor stores.


Luckily, since I started homebrewing I haven't had to deal with any of it!

Subject: The magic of brewing.


I couldn't resist commenting on the latest "brewing is magic" thread.


Thank you Father Barleywine, you inject just the right amount of insanity 
whenever it's needed.  [grin]


I love the science of brewing.  I love learning of the many chemical 
reactions and the exotic sugars and proteins that go to make up a delicious 
brew.  However, when I put kettle on stove and open up some ingredients, I 
forget the science and enter into the magic world of the 11th century 
alchemist.  If I had a cone hat with stars and moons on it, a la Merlin, 
I'd wear it when I brew.  I use the science to plan things, but the 
execution is strictly under the control of the netherworld.


Although I cannot prove it scientifically, I am convinced that the universe 
responds to attitudes.  I am in total agreement that my attitude towards my 
beer will influence its outcome.  (This is going to convince you that I'm a 
certified loon.)  I can command away the microbes that could damage my 
brew, and command to action those that make it what it should be.  (Do I 
really mean that ... well ... I'm not discounting it completely.)


Although I'm not nuts on the most popular of the homebrew books, the advice 
to "relax" is the best that could be given.  Oh yes, be sure you talk 
nicely to the yeast.  (In fact, they really like Bach and Vivaldi, 
especially the concerti grosii.)


See, I told you that I was crazy ... but that is all right because I make 
good beer.

Ok so I'm from DC and think I know of a few good places for beer. There is the Brickskeller with all their bottled beer, or the Four Providences for a
good slow pour Guiness, or you can go up to Baltimore for some good 
brewpubs.  Does anyone know of any other good local (ie. MD VA DC)  pubs or
bars, specifically ones serving good KEG beers!


BTW Old Dominion Brewing Co just came out with a new beer.  It is a light ale
(called, oddly enough, Dominion Ale).  I tried it last night and was suitably
impressed.  I don't know where else it is available except for Chevy Chase
Liqours, Though I am sure it will be readily available soon (Chevy Chase just
got their first case in on friday, the bottles were marked Aug 21)

In HBD 710, Thomas Manteufel described a special glass carboy he found

I am a crumugeon about some things. Sanitation is a tough enough struggle
(I've made quite a bit of contaminated beer myself) for homebrewers
without adding all sorts of gee-gaws to collect crud in. I'd just be
nervous about it - one of the beauties of the glass carboy is its
perfectly smooth interior finish, which cannot hide anything if you
follow relatively simple cleaning and sanitizing procedures. This gizmo
would complicate all that. What do you have against siphoning?

Subject: Root Beer


I recently had some delicious root beer made by a local microbrewer, Thomas
Kemper. The ingredients listed Sassafras extract and vanillia as the
only flavors.  There was other stuff as well: carmel color, corn sugar,
maltodextrin, phosporic acid and carbonated water.


Several months ago I talked with the Kemper head brewer) and he said that the
sassafras extract comes from only a few licenced processors since the raw
stuff is apparently quite carcinogenic.  I presume the maltodextrin is
responsible for the lush creamy mouth feel and head.  The rest is standard
pop ingredients.


The point is, do y'all have any recommendations for the flavor essence for
root beer?  I looked in my local supermarket for some "hires extract" that my
dad used way back when and all they had was some totally artificial and
loaded with odd chemical components stuff from Shilling (i.e. no sassafras in
it at all!)


This stuff from Kemper was *GREAT* and I would love to have a keg of it
next to my ales in the fridge (there is always room for one more tap!)


Thanks, in advance.

From: Conn Copas <C.V.Copas`at`loughborough.ac.uk>
Subject: Re : cidery tastes


There are at least three different classes of substances which can give
beer a fruity flavour : esters, aldehydes and fusel oil (higher alcohols).


Esters are generally well-received in ales and are encouraged by the use of
certain yeasts and also by high gravity ferments. In fact, some brews are
fermented at double strength, then later diluted, for this reason. Esters
can also be a product of maturation, according to the principle that
alcohol + organic acid  gives ester (slowly). Some acids esterify more
effectively than others, with some winemakers advocating additions of
succinic acid for this purpose. Could be an interesting experiment in beer
: you might possibly wind up with some appealing fruit flavours, or you
might wind up with a vinous tasting beer.


Just to contradict myself a little, I have noticed that hop aroma degrades
with maturation. I have always been under the impression that this aroma
was primarily due to esters. Possibly not ?


Aldehydes are a precursor to alcohol (ethanol) during yeast metabolism. In
other words, they are present in green beer, but should vanish with
maturation. They taste a fraction sickly and are poisonous. Fusel oil is
encouraged by certain yeasts, warm ferments, and nutrient deficiencies. It
too is sickly and reputedly toxic. Both aldehydes and fusel oil are thought
to be implicated in hangovers. If you will pardon an anecdote, the last
time I was in Munich, I had 1 litre of what looked and tasted like a very
young draught hefe weizen with dinner. The dinner was not particularly
exotic (after all, this WAS Germany) and I had no other intoxicants (honest
to God) ! Next morning, my head felt like trolls had danced on it during
the night (to steal a phrase).


Back to the point. When people complain about 'homebrew flavours',
'bubblegum flavours' and maybe 'cidery flavours', I suspect they are often
referring to aldehydes and/or fusel oil. This suspicion is reinforced if
the brew drinks cleaner with maturation.


Back onto toxicity. I now take the point that unhulled adjuncts have a
place in brewing. But this has led me to question whether the
rolling/flaking process has any effect on cellulose content in the cereal.
If not, one is introducing one of the precursors to methanol into the brew;
yet another nasty substance.


Just when you thought it was safe to ... RDWHAHB ?

jeg: I have read that Utah has a 3.2% law that covers *all* types of

jeg: Seems to me that would make for some pretty weak stouts.


I believe that only applies to beer *sold* in Utah, not *produced* in
Utah.  Alternatively, that Irish Stout has a lot more kick to it than
any other 3.2% beer I've ever had.  Maybe it's all just fusel oils....

Geez Looueez, what a recipe for mead!
        
        As you might have gathered, I'm replying to Chuck's recipe for cherry
mead and the resultant nasty suphur odor.  Chuck, try:
        1)  Cutting the addition of grapefruit juice to naught, and 
                using lemons or limes (3 - 5) instead.
        2)  Boil the stuff...I've had no problem with boiling up the 
                mead constituents (honey, water, and citrus juices) and
                then adding the fruit after it has cooled a bit.
        3)  Ack!  Dispense with the Campden tablets.  What an idea, 
                sterilizing components for a brew that tasted great before
                Pastuer was a sparkle in his father's eye.  Honey has
                all sorts of nasty antibiotics in it (when was the last
                time you found mold on your honey?) including, of course,
                high sugar content, and if your yeast isn't kicking ass on
                all competitors very soon after hitting the meniscus, you 
                need to get some different yeast.
        4)  Dispense with the acid and pectic enzyme.  Unnecessary and 
                probably expensive.
        5)  On the yeast note, try using champagne yeast.  If you prime it
                a bit, the mead has a delightful small-bubble sparkle that
                will tickle away your troubles (and champagne yeast will
                ferment out enough alcohol to savage any remaining ones).
Personally, I like both wine (flat) and sparkling meads.  Frankly, I could
drink mead continually, sing off key, and bathe in it too.  Mead is truly the
drink of the gods, while beer is the soothing nectar of their resulting well-
wishes for the prosperity of mankind.  Besides, mead is _really_ easy to make
(especially after killing yourself to produce a fine all-malt extravaganza).


                                Hope I helped a bit...

hiya


this may sound dorky but what about putting some hose on the 'nipple' 
(ooooooeeerrrrr!) and then blocking it with a couple of bulldog clips?


i s'pose you would need hose that would be a bit more flexible than the
average food-grade stuff (thinner perhaps?). 


in our lab (molecular bio) we use these things like thumbscrews for closing
off hoses (and for torture...) maybe a vice or something may work the same.


if you know someone who works in a lab they may be able to get some glass
taps which slot in to bits of hose, this may also work but i'm not too sure
what the pressure would be like inside the hose.


good luck

If you are talking about the newer style of kegs (from your
description, it looks like it), they are stainless steel.  *If* you
could purchase them, you could cut the top off (except for the
handles) and have one heck of a brewpot.  There was an article in
_Zymurgy_ a coupla years ago on disassembly of the top, careful
about that spring!  The older Hoff-Stevens stainless kegs can be
repurchased.  They can be cut (with caution) with a steel cutting
blade on a circular saw, grind or file the edges when done.
