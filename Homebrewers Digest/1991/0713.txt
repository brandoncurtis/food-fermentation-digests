I have AC and kept it at 75F, and kept a water bath around my
fermenter; my friend had none and the temps varied but his basement
probably averaged 85F.  I kept accusing him of using too much sugar
in his brews, but finally realized that temperature was the actual
culprit.  He used various kinds of dry, unattenuative ale yeasts,
but all the brews had a distinctive, hard to explain, pseudo-cidery
flavor.  Some of mine certainly had esters (banana), but nothing
near what his did.  His spring brews had no such flavor.

Now I'm confused.  Is that saying that 5% beer must be labeled as malt
liquor?  As far as I know, 5% beer (not malt liquor) is available
everywhere, but on Sundays only 3.2% beer can be sold - and I don't
know how true this is, since I've seen some 7-11s advertising 5% beer
on Sunday...

Hi Bill,


In the last Homebrewer's Digest you asked about some club activities.
Two interesting ones come to mind that our club (Ann Arbor Brewers
Guild) has sponsored.  One was called "bad brew."  In this one, a
series of additives was introduced into beer that approximated some
brewing artifacts (large amount of esters, fusils, ethel alchohol,
etc.) such that people can correspond tastes to these artifacts.  This
is an ongoing program and it has been very informative.  Another
activity that has been interesting is for the whole club to brew a
specific recipe.  We have done this with a number of recipes (an
extract, partial mash, and full mash) such that everyone can get
involved.  We end up tasting the end product(s) and try to ascertain
the differences in taste of the (presumably the same) beers.  We then
try to understand the differences in brewing techniques and see how
they forment these differences.  This has caused alot of good brewing
technical interchange since one variable (the recipe) has now been
fixed.


Hope this helps,


Nik

Subject: 2nd generation yeast & heresies


1.  I made one of my finest beers using yeast I cultured from a friend's
homebrew (thanks again, Ralph).  Of course, he started with good yeast,
but I am still amazed at how well the yeast stays in the bottom of the
bottle even with a somewhat careless pouring.
    The only thing about such an operation is that there are more chances
for the stuff to get infected while you are culturing.  But for me, culturing
off finished brew (drink the beer, reculture the dregs), is far more
efficient than trying to save slurry.  No disrepect to Father Barleywine,
but I can't imagine what effect the trub and spent gunk has on the next
batch. It just doesn't sound natural.


2.   Our local heretic posed the question of why the often benevolent (and
equally often malevolent) Mother Nature would design a natural system that
only occurs at unnatural temperatures.  I suspect that our extracting sugars
from the barley is UNnatural.  That is, our Mother Earth intended for
little baby plants to get the goodies inside the barley -- not a bunch
of beer swilling humans.  Thankfully, She is looking the other way while
we work our own version of alchemy.

Subject: yeast slurry


  I guess I was a little unclear in my wording about saving the slurry from 
the primary.  I realize that you can always culture a starter from the 
conditioned bottles.  I also realize that you can stir up the slurry and save 
that.  I've done both of those.  There are a couple of parameters in this case
that make me want to handle it differently.
  The yeast has not flocculated very well, and I believe there is quite a bit
of trub.  So stirring up the slurry may give me a low yeast-to-trub ratio.
Also, the most recently active yeast is still in suspension, not in the 
slurry.  It seems to me the way to get the cleanest and most active yeast is 
to save a couple of pints when I rack to a new carboy before bottling.


  Now the real question is why doesn't this yeast, Wyeast Chico Ale, settle
out very well?  Certainly Sierra Nevada Ales have a solid pack on the bottom
of the bottle.  *Someone* published a test report on Wyeast yeast, and Chico
ale was said to be a low-medium floculator, which seems to be the case.  How
does Sierra Nevada do it?

Stephen Jay Gould has written extensively on various aspects of this
fallacy, and given it at least one elaborate name; you should definitely
read as much of his work as you can find if you are trying to figure out
"why nature invented" anything.
   His basic observation is that nothing in nature is deliberate, or
maximally efficient. Among the reasons for this are:
 - evolution is accidental. Natural selection culls some traits and
strengthens others, but not very strongly unless there's a massive
[dis]advantage---ordinary variations generally aren't strong enough to be
subject to selection. Populations drift and mutate, and often we can't even
make a good guess at why selection pushed in a certain direction (we don't
\know/ that giraffes evolved long necks to eat high leaves; there could
have been some other force, or even accident, that let them fill this
niche).
 - nature has to cover a wide variety of conditions. A machine shop can be
precise because everything is controlled; biology has to survive extremes
of temperature, food, and water. An organism that can survive extremes is
more likely to be around after a few decades than one that is very good at
filling a narrow niche.


   Another factor is simple thermodynamics: most chemical reactions go
faster when heated. The better the enzymes can survive serious heat, the
more likely the grain is to reproduce (see above); that they will actually
work faster at this temperature is incidental. In fact, high-temp activity
could be unhelpful, breaking down the starch faster than the resulting
sugar can be assembled into cellulose---have you every seen your mash
sprout?

Subject: Re : heresies


Conn V. Copas enhances his heretical position by adding a new heresy to
ones he's already espoused.  However, I don't find anything heretical,
nor even more than mildly controversial about what he says.  I believe
the key to profficient and successful brewing is an understanding of
the processes involved and what parts the brewer wants to manipulate
and why.  The actual how of it isn't particularly important, and can
employ whatever the brewer has available or can buy or fabricate.


Conn's newest heresy seems to revolve around the question of why would
an enzyme system evolve that is most efficient at unnatural
temperatures.  The answer, to my mind, is that the definition of "most
efficient" is different for us as brewers than for the barley plants
that make those enzymes.  Their concern (if plants have concern) for
efficiency is with the enclosing system that provides energy for growth
from starch without benefit of sunlight, which is a plant's primary
energy pathway.


In this sense, "most efficient" is probably defined as that which
provides the breakdown of starch at a pace that closely matches the
rate of sugar consumption.  The plant throttles this rate by generating
the right level of enzyme concentration for about 60F to match this
pace.  That's why there's an ability for brewers to convert unmalted
adjuncts at the higher temperature--the balance at 60F is a very high
level for 150F.  On the other hand, a plant can't make use of all that
sugar in a matter of an hour, and it would be subject to rotting and
vigorous consumption by animals.

If you're going to buy fruit to flavor your beer, I'd recommend you buy
fruit juice.  What I did recently was to add one quart of blueberry
juice to one gallon of pale ale - the rest of the ale was bottled as
usual.  I did this in the secondary fermenter, not the primary like you
would have to do to sterilize fruit.  Specifically, I added the juice
when I racked off the rest of the ale for bottling.  It then fermented
a couple more weeks.


The only deficiency is that the blueberry flavor does not come out
without a little sweetness.  So, when I serve Bluebeerd, I add a
teaspoon of sugar to each glass in the form of syrup.


As far as proportions, with blueberry I think it's hard to overdo the
fruit.  At 25% juice, it is barely noticeable as a blueberry flavor - I
taste something, but can't identify it as blueberry till I add the
sugar.

|I understand that it takes a certain kind of luck to get crown

|even bother trying. 


In my past life as an extract brewer, I always used recycled twist off
bottles and capped them with regular crown caps.  After the 4-5th bottling
the edges of the threads started chipping and they became a bear to twist
off (gee, i had to use a church key).  So I would tossed them and get another
batch.  Big deal.


Nowdays I use soda kegs for regular consumption and shorty seltzer bottles (
styrofoam wrapped, platic screw caps) for transporting beer to social
functions.  The bottles seem infinitely reusable and the styrofoam sides keep
the beer at temp longer.  Plus a pint bottle is soo compact!  I have not
conditioned beer in one of these, but I can't see any reason why it wouldn't
work just fine.  Be careful boiling polyethylene caps: they might warp.  Cold
sanitization (bleach) might be better.


Yes, the lights are off in my fridge as well when the door is shut.


Cheers.

The carcinogenic ingredient in sassafras is safrol.  It is
confirmed to be carcinogenic, though I forget what type
of cancer it is implicated in. It can be removed from the

I think most people would agree that it's healthy to question the necessity of
dogmatic procedures. Hopefully the dogma will be replaced with scientific 
principle. However, there will always remain some subjectivity as to the effect
of the application of those principles.

Agreed. However, you can't blindly rely on the double-blinds of others. I know
plenty of beer enthusiasts who just can't distinguish certain flavors. I 
consider phenols in a pale ale to be a fault. Others will never notice it.

When brewers and brewing textbooks say 'enzyme efficiency', aren't they really 
saying 'enzyme efficiency during mashing'? The temperature of the mash is
partially intended to destroy (gelatinize) the kernal and dissolve its 
carbohydrates. This is not the same goal as the life-processes for which the 
enzymes were intended, where less mechanical action is involved. So, I don't 
find it odd that the mash efficiency temperature of enzymes would be different 
from the life-process efficiency temperature of those same enzymes.


And I suspect that if you go ahead and sparge the contents of your compost
heap, you will get a fermentable fluid. :-)

I'd avoid anything furry. Sounds like the white stuff is also mold.


Another suggestion is to get more of the yeast slurry from the Weizenbier and
add 2-5 mls of it to 50 mls of sterile wort. See if the yeast can get going in
this environment and then streak out a few plates of this culture.


The one problem I foresee is that most authentic Weizens are naturally
conditioned with a lager yeast which is added at the time of priming. You may
be wasting your energy if that is the case with the beer from which you are
getting the yeast.


Send me your snail-mail address and I'll mail you pure S. delbrueckii when the

In Australia, most beer is in screw-top bottles.  They have very few of
our 'long necks'.  Homebrewers use a thinner cap, labelled 'twist off' on
the package, which is pressed on with a standard bench press capper.  


I have tried some of these on American screw top bottles.  It requires a

OK, I'll bite. 
What's unusual about chilling wort and putting yeast on top??

Mother Nature would not have optimized the enzyme system for grain to make
beer. She would optimize the system such that grain could best make more
grain. As far as the unsuspecting little barley kernels are concerned, that
enzyme system is what will allow it to nourish itself during the early days
of spring while it begins to sprout. The little bit of starch in the grain
must sustain the fledgling plant until it is able to photosynthesize. Thus 
it must be doled out slowly - not converted all at once as we brewer's strive 
for. It follows that the strains best adapted to survive the germination 
phase would prevail. (Until, of course, man steps in and mucks around with 
everything.) As brewers, we are very fortunate that our goals require only
a small, easily achieved deviation from nature's course.


In fact, we should be grateful that some deviation is necessary. For if the 
conditions required for making beer were too "natural", then all the grains 
would be turning themselves into beer in the fields, and then where would we 
be??? :-)

Conn it depends a lot on whose doing the tasting. If your palatte is untrained,
or insensitive or both, then obviously off flavors deriving from brewing
technique don't matter. Then again perhaps neither does recipe formulation (in
the extreme, see my signature) so why not brew Miller clones??


We do Dr. Beer trinaing sessions (me & Steve Stroud) and find that some people
just aren't sensitive to certain substances. Others just don't know what to
look for or how to sort out and identify what it is they're tasting.
My personal experience is that after trainign my palette some I began to detect
off flavors in beers I was making that I hadn't recognized for what they were
previously. Adjustment of my brewing technique eliminated these.

For the NJ area folks, a new supply store is scheduled to open around
August 15th.


                        The Home Brewery of New Jersey
                        118 Fort Lee Road
                        Teaneck, NJ 07666
                        1-800-426-BREW


They also have locations in CA, MO and NV. 


A quote from the catalog, "We do not sell beer or wine ingredients to 
minors. Its not illegal, it's just not right; so if you are under 21, 
please don't order". The founder (Sam Wammack) is an ex-cop, so watch 
out if you visit the Ozark, MO store.


Just out of curiosity, do many of the under 21 HBD readers ever have
any problems ordering supplies?

Nature never meant for the enzymes to change the starch to sugar as quickly
as we do.  It meant for the starch to be converted to sugar only at the rate
at which the growing barley plant can use it.  Nice try, but I'm just too
relaxed to get short-circuited at this point in time.

Subject: Yeast Caking, Aluminum, and "Oh no not AGAIN!"


This one is for all of you who groan every time you see a Father B. posting...


        It has been a while since I proclaimed again my heretical belief in 
the brew without sanity philosophy.  There has been a lot of discussion of 
using yeast from the bottom of the fermenter, and to keep my dirty fingers
in the discussion I'd like to raise a few points:


        1)  Try racking off your beer for bottling just as you finish the
                preparations for your next brew, and within 20 minutes of
                uncovering the yeast cake, pour in your next (cooled) batch
                of wort.  Close your eyes if necessary so you won't see the
                brown ring of scuzze on the walls of your fermenter.  Pray to
                your favorite deity or just stare at a spot on your wall.
                Stick on the fermentation lock and don't even look at that 
                carbouy until tomorrow.  I guarantee that a good yeast batch
                will produce a couple (I've tried 11) sequential batches of
                beer, and that the dried dead yeasties on the walls of your
                carbouy will not be (detectably) detrimental.  Some final
                suggestions:  ferment as cold as possible, and use a good
                yeast.


        2)  Be really careful when storing trub in your refrigerator unless
                you really enjoy cleaning dried malt substance/yeast off 
                your refrigerator/vegetables/catsup bottles.  Just a warning


        3)  Try keeping a culture (adding yeast cake to fresh wort) instead,
                using about 1/2 - 1 cup yeast of good texture to about 3/4
                gallon wort.  This will last a while, and you don't need
                to worry too much about catching the yeast in log phase (i.e.
                2 - 3 days old).


        4)  Please don't sanitize everything (anything!).  Keep your equipment
                clean, free of deposits, and above all dry in storage.  I know
                you don't want to hear it from me again, but you really don't
                need to bleach/boil/Campden/irradiate items used in typical
                brewing.  Culturing yeast is an entirely different ball game.


        The "Oh no not AGAIN" was in reference to the Great Aluminum Debate.
There have been many many MANY postings about whether aluminum will discolor
wort/beer, cause Alzheimer's Disease, and everything else that our diverse
collection of posters could blue-sky.  Aluminum will dissolve into aqueous 
solutions, particularly acidic ones (like beer), but my personal philosophy
is that aluminum exposed to beer (wort) before fermentation will dissolve in
it and then be efficiently sucked up (chelated) by the hordes of yeasties
which pass the total wort volume through themselves many times over during the
course of a brew.  Admittedly, you are drinking some of these yeasties too in
your final beer, but most sit languidly on the bottom.  Relax, use aluminum,
and worry about the carcinogenic compounds you run into at high concentrations
at work every day.
        Ah, another diatribe smoking out of the keyboard!  Please, flame me!
I thrive on abuse.

Chlorine/pH meter:


I came across a catalog that contained a combination chlorine/pH meter
for use with swimming pools.  It's about $50.  Has anyone tried one of
these?  Are they accurate enough?  Seems like it would be real handy.




Mashing pot:


Has anyone tried mashing pot?  ...just kidding...
Seriously, what size pot is needed to mash, say, 10 lbs of grain?
I already have a 10 gal SS pot to boil in.  Is a 5 gal SS pot large enough
for mashing a maximum of 10 lbs of grain?

I have decided to invite a few homebrewing acquaintances over for
a "Beer Tasting Session".  To the best of my knowledge this is a
first for all of us.  I intend to ask each participant to bring
two bottles, preferably homebrew, but possibly a favorite
commercial product for comparison.  How do _you_ conduct tastings?
What might you suggest that would contribute to the event?  One
person has suggested that I provide score sheets so that we can rate
the brews, then compare, and have a record for the future.  Does
anybody have a sample of such a rating sheet? (Preferably electronic,
though you could fax it to me, we are in the midst of a mail strike
right now).


What about munchies, anything special you recommend? (nothing too
mouth numbing for obvious reasons :-).


All suggestions welcome, if you are within reasonable distance of
Burlington, Ontario, Canada, and wish to attend (no date set, 
probably mid to late September) send me an email message.

 Aside from the environmentally unfriendly use of throw-away

 sterilizing glass petri dishes in a microwave oven with good

 A few drops of water in the bottom create steam and, I

[ Just to clarify things, DMS is a chemical, and not a living organism.
  However, a bacterial infection of the wort could cause "large" amounts
  of DMS to be produced.  ]


> Does it have an effect on the taste or

     I've been told that, in high concentrations, DMS can give beer a
hint of "cooked vegetables" or "shellfish".  Perhaps someone who knows
more can give a better description.


     If you're interested in finding about what causes various
off-flavors, you may want to get a copy of the 1987 special issue of
Zymurgy, which is entirely dedicated to "troubleshooting" problems with
beer flavor.  The special issues of Zymurgy seem to get periodically
reprinted, and should be available at your local beer supply store (if
not, mail-order places have it).  However, note that they're not cheap,
being about $8.00 for a 64-page magazine (in the case of the 1987
issue), but I think that they're worth it if you plan to do any serious
beer-brewing.
