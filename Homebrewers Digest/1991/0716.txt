Someone (ie, me) posted this recently :


>Lastly, another part-mythical creature : the malt extract 'tang'. Fact or
>fiction ?  


My reply is try putting your brain in gear before you post in future. If
you look at the labels on tins of malt extract, you will notice that some
contain caramel. This is used as a colouring, but the worse examples can
impart an 'acidy' flavour as well. IMHO, the addition of caramel to
extracts (or for that matter to beer) suggests that the manufacturer has
something to hide. Apologies to Newcastle Brown Ale fans :-)


One of my standard tricks when using extracts is to boost the final gravity
with partially fermentable malto-dextrin powder. I have tried either adding
this to the boiler or adding a solution at bottling time. The boiled
dextrin often seems to attenuate too far whereas the bottled dextrin seems
to remain unfermented for months. So I am now entertaining two theories : 


a) Boiling the malto-dextrin causes some chemical change into more
fermentable sugars, or


b) Adding malto-dextrin to a voracious primary ferment causes more of it to
be consumed.


Any ideas ?

Regarding the handles on 33 qt ceramic on steel pots:


I don't trust these things either.  When I'm moving a full pot, I
lift it by the lip rather than the handles.  I can just see five
gallons of boiling wort spilliing all over the front of my body.
OUCH!

  Yesterday, members of the James River Homebrewers served local microbrewery
products to interested persons at the Valentine Museum's Labor Day bash.
   Two Virginia breweries were represented; Old Dominion (w. filtered and 
unfiltered lager) and the Virginia Brewing Co. (Dark Horse Amber, Gold Cup
Pilsner and Gold Cup Light).
   Reps from the breweries were present as were local historical archeologists
and historian who discussed the history of brewing in Virginia.
  (IMHO, the unfiltered Old Dominion was the best...)

I doubt it.  I've noticed that most tropical beers are lagers, which
require artificial refrigeration of the fermenting vessels virtually
everywhere.  That being the case, the only difference between the
physical plant required to produce Belikan and that required to
produce Molsen's, is the size of the refrigeration system, as the
temperature differential between the air and the beer is greater
in Belize than in Canada.  The temperature outside the vessels 
is otherwise irrelevant, I would imagine.

33-qt. ceramic-on-steel kettle, but notes:

I think of this with every batch I brew.  I use one of these
kettles, and have recently begun thinking in terms of using it as a
mash kettle full-time, and saving my pennies for a SS kettle as a
boiler.  Every time I lift that kettle from the stove to the sink it
"talks" to me, but I don't yet see the little telltale cracks in the
ceramic indicating flex damage.  Those handles are the weak point,
beyond a doubt.  Rather than use the handles in the manner they were
(apparently) intended, I now pick up the full kettle (using oven
mitts) by the sides, looping my thumbs through the handles for
slippage control.  Not a perfect method, but it seems to strain them
less.  I also clear the kitchen of kids, dogs, cats, spouses, and
other living things and obstacles.  It still scares Hell out of me.
In my opinion, that's the only problem with using one of these
kettles.

Well, you're both wrong and you're both right, in my opinion.  I'm sure
Fr. B. would agree that it's possible for a homebrewer to make a beer
with a bacterial infection.  It can be achieved by simply cooling the
boiled wort slowly, or even easier, by adding a teensy little bit of
yeast at the beginning of the ferment so it will have to compete with
lots of other beasts for the "sugar pie."  


My experience has been similar to his. I think I worried far too much,
and for too long, about cleanliness, when in reality the major problems
I had with *my* process control were lack of sufficient yeast quantity
for pitching (potentially solved by the fresh-wort-in-over-the-top
technique he espouses) and inadequate oxygen in the cooled wort.  The
beers I've done since discovering those faults have been remarkable, and
I'm brewing in an environment that is clean but in no way "sanitary."


Just another data point, as it were.

Oh, *sorry* Steve!  I hate to think that I could have been the cause of
anothers injuries.  I'm glad you didn't get hurt.  As I said in my 
posting I hadn't actually tried the recepies, but posted them because
of their all_natural contents.

I can't comment specificaly on the recipy I posted (haven't tried it yet).
I would suggest that anyone try makeing a normal soda with an extract 
before you try one of those recipies.  This would give you a little insight 
into the procedures used in making sodas.  You could then apply these 
procedures to the all_natural recipies.  For example; the appropriate time 
to bottle so things don't explode.


I think cane sugar in place of the honey would be fine for soda.
This might also help with the exploding bottle problems, the
champagne yeast could continue to slowly ferment the honey for a few
weeks, resulting in the increase of pressure.  You could also try an 
ale yeast in place of the champagne.  This would ferment less of the
sugars and you would also loose the champagne flavors.


> btw, Bob, how did your batch turn out (assuming it's still intact?)


I got side tracked into makeing a batch of sugar-free iced-tea.  Pretty 
tasty, and oh what a caffine jolt!  It's funny you mention Nutrasweet.
I was trying to find some bulk but couldn't, so I ended up using 
good old saccarin (sp?).


I think my next soda will be a sugar-free cola.  (Once I find some
bulk Nutrasweet).


Cheers,

Leading, we should note, to their ultimate downfall!  I'll bet the Party
made them use Red Star yeast, too.  It's a real pity... I'd love to have
the Red Square concession for "Lenin Lager, served in a commemorative
pewter tombstein."  Sure, "Stalin Stout" would never sell, but I'd make a
killing with my dopplebock, "Dictator,"  and what about "Glorious Workers'
Proletariat Socialist Soviet Revolutionary Red Ale" ?  (Sold in 22-ounce
bottles, of course, to provide enough room for the label.)


In a related issue, it struck me yesterday that "Oprah" is "Harpo" spelled
backwards.  Well, actually "harpO," but you get my drift.  She's probably
put a few sixpacks away, too, so it's even more relevant.


Hmm... it's no wonder the Russians stick to vodka.  How do you make

Subject: First All-Grain Batch




Hello, being a glutton for punishment, and a veteran of a whole whopping
4 extract brews, I would like to try an all-grain brew.  What I would
like is opinions on techniques for making a first all-grain wort.
I guess simplicity is the key, I would rather buy extra grain than sweat
getting optimal extraction efficiency.  I've scanned Papasian and Burch and
realize there are a varity of mash techniques available, I'm looking for
suggestion on which I should use as a first timer.


I have a 33qt ceramic on steel pot, a 22qt al. pot, and the normal variety
of kitchen pots and pans and utensils.  I realize I'm missing something to
hold the grain while I sparge, need suggestions here too.  Over the past
few months, I've heard of people use stacked 5 gal plastic buckets, "Igloo"
type coolers, etc.


I will be re-using the cake from some Williams ale-yeast, which will conveniently
become available while cooking the mash...


Receipts, techniques, and hardware suggestions are all welcome.

Subject: Reusing Yeast Cake & Soda Kegs


Well I decided to reuse my yeast cake from my previous batch of Xmas
Ale for my current 'Get Rid of Old Extracts Ale'.  Unlike Father Barleywine
I am using Chico Ale Yeast, and have decided to dry hop this mess.
After an hour or two on the yeast cake there was an occasional glub,
this morning that sucker was bubbling almost continuously.


On another note I recently picked up a kegging system using soda kegs and
bought some used kegs which still had product in them so I dumped them out
and rinsed them thoroughly, and I was going to keg my beer into one of them
but after I put some boiling water into it to rinse out the sterilizing
solution (I imagine even Father Barleywine washes out used bottles well)
it started smelling like Pepsi.  Right now I have it soaking with a baking
soda solution in it.  I'm wondering it the smell is coming from the
rubber seal, they're still good but should I replace them anyways???
Also I bought my setup from Foxx, but they just sent me a box with no
instructions at all, I'm a reasonably intelligent guy and got everything
hooked and running in no time at all but is there something I should
know about putting beer in kegs.  A friend of mine here at work says
you only need 1/4 of priming sugar for priming in a keg and to keep
the pressure at 5psi, I read on the HBD here that the seals don't seal
unless subjected to 10-15 psi, so I initially pressurized it to 12psi to
make sure that it sealed well then released some co2 to get it down to 5psi. 


Also my friend at work here says that pepsi no longer uses kegs, and that
they ship their syrup in boxes with a plastic bag inside, and that they
have a large amount of empty kegs lying around. (his brother worked for
the local bottling company, and now works at VFW (or something like that)
that has all of these boxes of syrup laying around connected to their
system so I trust he knows what he's talking about.)  The point is, does
anyone know if this is just our local bottling co, or is this nationwide?
