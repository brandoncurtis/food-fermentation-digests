Anchor Wheat isn't trying to emulate South German Weizen.  Fritz Maytag
has called Anchor Wheat his "lawnmower beer", it's the lightest beer
in the Anchor line.  There's a local (I'm in San Diego) brewpub that
also makes it's lighest beer with a proportion of wheat.  And Byron
Burch, brewer/author, mentioned somewhere (I think it was the Yeast
issue of Zymurgy) that one of the Wyeast strains was well suited
to "California style wheat beer".  It seems to be a lighter (color,
body, alcohol), more balanced/less hoppy version of Pale Ale.


Speaking of "lawnmower beer", did Fritz invent this term, or did
he take it and apply it to his wheat beer?  The Anchor brewery tour
was the first place I'd heard it.

I have noticed this same symptom in a few of my brews -but generally only in 
darker, more full bodied projects. Any help out there?


Secondly, I was recently in Bennington, Vermont, and tried a local brew

reminded me of tea. Are there other brews out there with a similar flavor?
Also, how can I achieve this at home?

Subject: priming bucket, DME vs corn sugar


Greetings, mad scientists....


In HBD #723, Rich Lenihan asks:


>A couple questions on priming:


>1.  [text omitted]  My question:  Is there a compelling reason why I
>*should* use a bottling bucket? 


Two reasons I can think of:  one, to insure proper mixing of the priming solu-
tion and the wort (I put the priming solution in the bucket first, then siphon
the wort in with it); two, to minimize the amount of sediment that gets 
carried into the bottles.  These are interrelated, for in order to mix well 
you might stir up the sediment.  Disadvantage: one more siphoning step that 
may introduce oxygen and microorganisms.


>2. [text omitted] is there a compelling reason (ie. from
>a taste or aesthetic standpoint) why I should switch to DME [for priming]?


Caveat:  I have not performed the A-B comparison experiment on this topic.


According to Miller in TCHoHB, you will find a distinct taste difference.
This is due to corn sugar being fully fermentable whereas malt extract is not.
(this is also why you have to use more DME...1 1/4 cups vs 3/4 cups, I believe
I read in Zymurgy last year)  Esters, diacetyl, etc., get produced from a
DME fermentation, not from one with corn sugar.  These levels will be higher 
in your beer as a result.  Miller therefore recommends against extract priming
for lagers and gives cautious approval for ales, in which esters and diacetyl
are an acceptable part of the flavor/aroma profile.


Na zdrojie,

Personally, I have found that using the bottling bucket approach
gives me bottled beer with no sediment (except some small amount
of dead yeast, presumably).  No longer do I pour carefully to
avoid sediment getting into the glass.  I don't see any
carbonation differences, either.

I use either 3/4 cup corn sugar or over a cup of DME for the same
level of carbonation.  No, I haven't really noticed the
difference, but it makes me feel better as a beer purist :-)

     One mole of water weighs about 18 grams and has 6.02252E+23 molecules.
One liter of water weighs exactly 1000 grams at 4 degrees centigrade.  That
gives 1000/18.0 = 55.6 moles of water in one liter of water.  55.6 times
Avogadro's number is 3.35E+25 molecules in one liter of water.  So, if you
have a ppm figure, you then need to change it to a parts per liter figure,
which is done like so:


     ppm/1000000 * 3.35E+25/Liter = ppL (parts per Liter).




     Now, change ppL to milligrams by finding the molar weight of the ion,
the number of moles of the ion, and multiplying:


     n = ppL/6.02252E+23 = number of moles.


     n*molar weight = g/L.  Now multiply by 1000 and you'll have mg/L.


Hope this helps,

I, too, used this priming method for years, out of simple ignorance of any
alternative for a while, and then out of a belief that it minimized risk of
infection. I now use the priming bucket (actually I use a priming carboy)
method. The main advantages are that I get *much* less sediment in the
bottles using this technique, and the beer seems to clear faster and more
completely.

Subject: DME vs corn sugar; bottling bucket


In HBD 723 Rich Lenihan wonders about using DME as a substitute for corn 
sugar in priming.  Only about 2/3 of the sugars contained in DME are
fermentable while corn sugar (glucose) is completely fermentable.  Thus,
you should use about 50% more DME than corn sugar to get the same level
of carbonation.  It's unlikely that one could detect the taste difference
resulting from priming with one or the other in most full-bodied beers.  A
cup of corn sugar is only about 1/3 lb.


Rich also wonders why people use bottling buckets.  Good question since
transferring the beer to another container before bottling has many 
disadvantages such as (1) adding oxygen to the beer (2) exposure to 
additional surfaces which increases the risk of contamination (3) increased
time in bottling.  Its very easy to use a carboy headpack to start the
siphon directly from the carboy and avoid these worries.

Subject: A sweet ending


     Several weeks ago, in this august forum, I asked for help with my
problems of too-sweet beer.  The answer most people suggested, you'll recall,
was:  more hops.  The stout I brewed subsequent to receiving this advice is
now done, and I can report back, like I promised.  In addition to the hops in
the hopped extract, I used 1 oz. of Bullions (alpha = 9) at the beginning of
the boil, a half ounce of Northern Brewers halfway through the boil (alpha =
?) and a half ounce of Cascades to finish.  Therein followed a short
fermentation in the mid to high 70's.  When I opened the first bottle, it
wasn't at all sweet.  It was, in fact, bitter (yaayy!), with a nice creamy
head that lasts nearly to the end of the glass.  The beer has less body than I
expected, and the roasted barley flavor comes through stronger than I
expected.  In addition to the hops, I suspect that the roasted barley may be
covering up some of the sweetness.  The beer won't win any awards, but when I
finished the first glass, I said to myself, "Hmm, I think I'll have another." 
So, I'm on the right track.


     Again, thanks.

From: larryba`at`microsoft.com
Subject: HBD #733 & Dave Rose


Dave Rose has several questions.  Here are some of my Opinions:


Klages: Universal malt.  Can mashed any old way.  Low husk content, low
husk tannins, high diastatic power, good yields, dirt cheap.  Klages are
"fully Modified" meaning protein rest is optional.  I made a stout with
7lb of klages, 1lb flaked barley, 1lb roast barley - single infusion mash
and it cleared out fine after a couple of months.  I did a step mash of the
same recipie and it also cleared just fine.


Haze: if you have haze even when the beer is warm it could be one of the
following: starch (incomplete conversion), Yeast: non-flocculent or Infection.
My beers (ales) never cleared until I started adding gelatine when racking to
the keg (1/2 tsp dissolved in 1 cup boiling water).  Of course they never
were allowed to age very long either %-}


Head: commercial beers sometimes use head helpers.  You can use a little
wheat or barley flakes to get a similar effect.  If you keep it down to 4oz/
5gal batch you probably won't see any protein haze even if you only do a
single infusion mash.  Head retention also seems to be a function of
conditioning - maybe you are just drinking too fast?


Plastic taste: My wife claims/complains that all my beers have a unique
aroma in the burps.  As best I can tell it is due to the late addition of
hops in the kettle, typically 1 oz of something aromatic for the last minute
before chilling.  My stouts, which have no late additions, don't have that
effect.  Perhaps this is what you are noticing?

Subject: Extract yields...


I am curious about how high extract yields are among the all-grain brewers out
there.  The oft-quoted number from Miller is 33.  I have rarely gotten above 
30, and though I am working on solving this, I wonder whether others are 
doing better on a regular basis.  If you want a real eye-opener, go through
some of the Zymurgy special issues and look at the award-winning recipes. 
I don't have an issue with me, but when I figured out the yields for all the
recipes (excluding those that add adjuncts which make the calculation more
complicated) I didn't find anyone getting over 30.  The average was something 
like 25 and some were as low as 17!  There seemed to be an inverse relationship
between the yield and the amount of grains being used, i.e. the worst yields
were in barley wines and the like where lots of grains were being handled. This
makes me suspect that a lot of the loss comes in sparging, since it is hard for
me to understand why starch conversion efficiency would be dependent upon the
size of the mash.  In open defiance of all the laws of homebrewing, I am 
*worrying* about improving my extract, and I'm interested in hearing the 
experiences of others.  Thanks.   d.

Now I've had a pump such as this sitting near the top my wish list for

trick but I would like to hear from those of you with some experience

Hi All,


Well, my second batch has been in the bottle about a week. It's the
Raspberry Stout from "The Winners Circle".


I opened a bottle last night to see how it's getting along and was
immediately disappointed. Very undercarbonated. In my first batch I had
used 3/4 cup of corn sugar and ended up with overcarbonation and so I
back off to 1/2 cup. Am I going to see any more carbonation over time?


Also, though the smell is wonderful and has the mouth feel of a good
stout, there is a very harsh aftertaste. I'm hoping that it will smooth
out as it ages, but wondered if anybody has any comments.

well gang, the concensus seems to be that i jumped in to the far extreme of
the beer scale.  perchance i should have started off with a beer a tad
milder than bigfoot.  i was a little worried that all these real beers 
would be that strong.  mom tried to tell me it was a special occasion beer 
that should be shared, but i thought the redskins beating the cowboys on 
monday night football was occassion enough and that she was just trying to 
horn in on my beer.   luckily when i couldn't finish it she was there to
save it from the sink.  so now i'm looking forward to trying more beer, of
a milder nature.  just about everyone suggested SN pale ale, so that shall
be my next monday night football half time experiment.  and it just so
happens that i am lucky enough to have a few in the house, along with SN
porter, stout, and pale bock (which will follow soon after the pale ale), if
i can get them away from my brothers.  i don't know how much they go for
out here in maryland.  i've only seen the SN pale ale around here and 
that was about $7 for a 6 pack, plus i get a discount cause my brother works
at the liquor store.  we got the rest when me sister came out to visit.  she
lives within walking distance of SN brewing, and the family makes her bring
beer whenever she comes to visit.  she brought some summerfest last time, 
but that disappeared before i even saw the bottle.  it figures that with all
those choices on the shelf, i would pick the most potent.  i just couldn't
resist that cute little lable with the big foot on it.  i'm looking forward
to experimenting.  thanks everyone for the input and advice!

All the recent discussion of preparing yeast cultures leads me to ask

a bottle of this beer - does it have a layer of sediment at the bottom

Hey all,


I've heard this and that about various schemes to keep a fermenter cool,
but what I'd be really charged about is a strain of yeast that allows
high temperature fermentation without too much in the way of bizarre flavors.


So, does anyone know of a yeast strain that can stand fermenting at an
average ambient temp of 80 deg (F)?  By stand it, I mean will ferment at
that temperature without producing an inordinate amount of esters or
phenols or whatever get produced at high temps.  If anyone does know of
such a critter, I'd also appreciate it if I could find out where to get it.
All I can get at my local shop is red star and Whitbread.

Hey all,


Let's say I go out tonight and buy some Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Let's
say I drink two while I cook up a quart of wort.  Now suppose I do the
voo-doo necessary to culture the yeast out of the SNPA bottles, and in
two days I've got my yeasties munching away at the wort.


What if I don't want to brew for say, 3 weeks?  Is it possible to keep my
solution around for that long and gently awaken it a day or 3 before I
brew?  Or should I just wait and culture the yeast later?  


Whatever the case, that Pale Ale is starting to sound pretty good ...

There are two reasons for NOT priming the way that you do: 1) the
possibility of uneven carbonation (more priming sugar in some bottles,
less in others) and 2) stirring up trub.  When you rack the beer
off the trub into the priming bucket, it is easier to stir the
priming sugar into the beer since you don't have to worry about
stirring up the trub.

Dextrose (corn sugar) is 100% fermentable.  DME is not.  On the average,
you should use about 20% more DME (*BY WEIGHT*) than dextrose to get
the same amount of fermenable sugar.  I use DME, not really because
I feel that the small amount of dextrose used for priming would cause
a detectable change in the flavor, but rather because I simply feel
better using all malt.

The twist-offs are not reused -- in civilized communities, they are

You know, the kind you can drop from waist-high onto a wooden floor and
they won't break?  Before I switched to kegging, I only used those.

Weizen 500ml, and St. Sebastiaan (sp?) (750ml (?), ceramic bottles, really
cool looking, perfect for those beers with a really nasty chill-haze ;^).

Subject: More yeast


Kent Dinkel asks about introducing more yeast into the carboy if the SG is too high.


Apart from there being too little oxygen in the wort, another possible cause of a stuck ferment is having the yeast flocculate out too early. Rather than pitching more yeast it is not a bad idea to first rack the wort plus a little of the sediment in the bottom into another carboy, to see if the fermentation starts up again.  This has the effect of rousing some of the yeast back into suspension, and is a sort of homebrew equivelant of the Yorkshire square system used by Samuel Smith who use a very flocculating yeast.


Also Conn Copas feels that if a beer comes in a bottle it can't be called a bitter.


While this may be technically true, it is possible to rack bitter from a keg into a bottle, this is the method I used to win the English and Scottish bitter class at this years AHA National competition, and I was satisfied that the resulting bottled beer was almost indistinguishable from the real thing. I was trying to produce a reasonable facsimile of Brakespears Bitter, which is my drink of choice when I visit home.

really no such thing as "cheap" lab glassware, I fear), as is their
service, their selection is outstanding, and if there's a minimum

If you rack to a fresh, sanitized container, you leave behind all
the trash on the bottom of the fermentor.  None of that will end up
in bottle or keg, no matter how vigorously you mix in the priming
solution.  That's the advantage.

You don't need to be a "purist" to add to your technique.  DME is
not necessarily better than corn sugar for priming purposes, but it
definitely is different, and if you have control of both, you can
apply whichever gives the effect you want, in a given batch.  Yes,
it takes more DME than it does corn sugar to achieve a given
carbonation level.  If I were making a pale ale, for example, I
might use 1/2 cup corn sugar, or I might use 2/3 to 3/4 cup DME. 
The difference would be "beadier" bubbles and better head retention
in the DME batch, but also more "fruitiness", a wider array of
esters, which you may not always want.  In this year's batches,
I've made about 3 DME-primed batches for every corn sugar-primed
one, but that's primarily a reflection on the styles I've been
brewing in.  And remember, a DME-primed batch needs more time to
condition!

My first immersion chiller used 100' of 1/4" tubing, and in many
ways it worked very well indeed, but I must agree with your
reasoning about throughput.  At any reasonable pressure (defined as
a pressure where I wasn't plagued with leaks) the water would just
drool out of the output hose, piping hot.  I always had the feeling
that it transferred all the heat it was going to in the first few
feet of the coil.  I never tested this, but it always appeared that
the rate of temperature change of the wort was very slow at first,
gathering speed later.  Last winter, I foolishly stored it with some
cooling water still in it, and an exceptionally hard freeze
destroyed it.  The replacement was made with 3/8" tubing, which seem
to chill more quickly, especially after I connect the icewater
recirculation pump (I always needed a wastegate system with the
other chiller, to keep the pressure within range).  Interestingly,
the water coming out the other end isn't nearly as hot.

Personally, I've never found flaming (in the Usenet sense) to be at
all effective in discouraging pests, no matter where in the food
chain they may be.  What John was talking about was straight from the
realm of microbio lab technique.  If you have a Bunsen burner (or
equivalent), pass the item gently and fairly quickly through the
flame.  You want to singe the beasties on the outside, not bake the
ones on the inside.  You can achieve the same effect by wiping it
down with alcohol, then flaming it with a cigarette lighter.  Try
not to flame your fingers in the process ... it hurts!  (Voice of

Greetings All:


I feel like a stranger in these parts, it's been so long since I 
posted.  School has begun in these Appalachian mountains and my 
students have me grading papers, studying and reading instead of 
brewing and playing on the computer.


Here come a few comments:


Randy, who may no longer be on the net pointed out:


>I learned a lesson in my present batch.  Watch out that leftover hops (from
>pellets) does not plug your blowoff hose!  Kinda makes a mess on the floor,
>the walls, and the ceiling......


I suspect Randy's been reading The Complete Joy of Homebrewing, a good 
book except that Charlie thinks you can blow off through siphon hose.  
You may get away with it for a while but sooner or later you get 
burned.  So for all you new brewers,  tear out that page in Charlie's 
book and buy 1" ID hose from the plumbing store and jam it down into 
the neck of the carboy and blow-off through it.  You'll NEVER pop a 
cork with one of those monster hoses.  Blow-off is a great technique.  
Don't give up on it because you've been using the wrong equipment.


Elsewhere:


>The problem with the vinyl tubing was, when it got hot, it got really soft,
>and when it got really soft it fell over and kinked, and when that happened,
>it blew right off the copper tubing which then shot hot water all over the ceil
>Now the vinyl is twist-tied to the input hose so it won't kink.


Use washing machine hose if you can.  It takes hot water without 
getting soft.


And from a couple of weeks ago:


>I usually fill the carboy with hot
>water and bleach and let it soak overnight if there's serious scum in it.


>Chris Shenton 


A minor point, which you probably know but some of the newer brewers 
may not.  The hot water and bleach solution IS good for loosening the 
scum.  But hot water breaks down clorox and shouldn't be used to 
sterilize a full carboy since the heat of the water and the clorox 
would work against each other.  B-Brite, by the way, is good for 
loosening that gunk.


And here's one I'm responsible for since I'm the one who advocated pot 
scrubbers on the end of the pick-up tubes in the first place.


>I've been plagued by a slight metallic taste in some of my brews, not all.

Sorry Darren.  I've never noticed a metallic taste in my beers but I'm 
bothered by the fact that it might be possible.  SO, right beside the 
shelf in the grocery store where you found the Copper wound pot 
scrubbers, look for the STAINLESS STEEL pot scrubbers.  They should 
take care of the problem without having to buy a new one each time.


Good to see you derelicts again.  (You, too, Darryl.)  And a pat on the 
back to Rob for providing the HBD for us all.  


And now, back to the books.

production by several orders of magnitude.  I need to find a source of
bulk 5-gal pin-lock soda kegs.  I can do the reconditioning; that they
be cheap is the item of highest priority.  


I appreciate any pointers anyone out there can give me. 


One comment on a recent thread: (inviting flames, I might add)
I don't know how anyone can call him/herself a brewer and be without a
hydrometer.  I use mine constantly, and have found as a result how
pitifully slow extract reduction is in my beers compared to commercial
breweries.  I'm fixing that by now being so retentive about sanitation
that I neglect getting sufficient oxygen into my beers, and to try to
repitch yeast to the greatest degree practicable.

Well, my Stout it fermenting nicely, and I have an easy question for
all of you experienced homebrewers:  The specific gravity was 1.052 at
80 degrees fahrenheit.  The hydrometer gives accurate readings at *60*
degrees fahrenheit.  Is there a formula I can apply to determine the
actual specific gravity?




By the way, I'd like to thank all of the people who helped me,
including, in no particular order,  Robert Keil, John De Carlo,
Pat Waara, Sean Conway, Judy Bergwerk, Mike McNally, Stephen Russel,
Chad Epifanio, and anyone else who I have inadvertantly left out.
Thanks a lot ... you make participating in the list worthwhile!


I'll post the stout recipe I used after I taste it and decide if I
want to unleash it upon the world....

A friend asked me where the name WYeast originated from.  Apparently the
name originally had nothing to do with yeast.  Help?


Is anyone going to the Great American Beer Festival in Denver October 4-5.
I have heard both good and bad things about this event and would still like
more feedback.


Finally, after a lapse of 14 months I have started brewing again with a
hopefully-Christmas ale from one of the earlier recipes posted here.
Unfortunately it started out at 1072, after 2 days was 1040,
after 5 days was 1032, after 12 days 1028, and it has seemed to stay there.
This seems to be a high specific gravity to bottle at.  Any suggestions?


Thanks,

can you convert a full mash recipe to a partial mash recipe?
do you simply substitute x amount of pale malt extract for
x amount of pale grains?  is it 1 to 1 conversion?


also, when the recipe calls for special grains (crystal malt,
munich malt, chocolate etc), do you add these to the barley malt
and mash like anything else?  


and if you have a partial mash porter, please send it to me.  thanks.
