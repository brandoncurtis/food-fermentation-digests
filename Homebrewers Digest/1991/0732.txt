Oh well, I suppose If I don't want to be a hypocrite, I
should post something substantial:


Munich Beer:


10 lbs pale alt Malt
5 lbs munich malt
 .5 lb dextrin malt
1.5 lb amber crystal malt
1 0z gypsum
 .333 oz burton H2O salts
5.5 g hallertauer 90 min
1.5 oz cascase 60 min
 .25 oz cascase 30 min
 .25 cascase 15 min
wyeast munich beer yeast


the sparge stuck, so i got out a big strainer and sparged
individual 1 lb strainerfulls of grain.  I let the stuff
settle, and it cleared up.  After the boil, I had
3 gal 1.077 S.G. wort. fermented 2 months, added 
polyclar, racked and dryhopped with 1/4 oz hallertau
pellets two days later, moved to room temp a week later,
let sit for a week, and bottled.  Finished the
last bottle the other night.


You should get twice as much with a good sparge.
The wort really needed to to be dry hopped longer -
the pellets never really completely dissolved,
and kind of filtered themselves out in the siphon.


Serve very cold or very warm.

     A few years ago, someone gave me a beer kit that essentially consisted
of a heavily reinforced (nylon mesh) plastic bag containing liquid malt.
The bag had a tap spigot and a cap (w/pressure valve) for filling (just add
water and the included packet of dry yeast, and, voila, beer in a couple
of weeks).  There was absolutely no boiling, etc., involved.  Just add water
and yeast.


     After adding the water and yeast, and waiting for a couple of weeks,
I tried the beer.  While it was "drinkable", it had a pronounced acidic
taste, which I believe was caused by a mild bacterial infection.  Once you
got used to the taste, it wasn't bad, but you had to get used to it
(drinking more than one pint at a time certainly helped ;-).


     Now, I don't know what instructions come with the brew kit that you've
seen.  If if comes with instructions on sanitizing the keg, etc., the beer
may turn out all right.  If it doesn't, you're probably taking a chance.

 Indeed!  As they say, "too many cooks, spoil the broth".  However, they can't 
 spoil it by talking about it.  In this case, talking about it can save the

  Pardon my (seeming) ignorance, but what exactly is attenuation re:
yeast?
  Also, is the Wyeast Altbier a slow yeast? I have used the London ale and
the german ale Wyeast and they were quick to finish primary (5-8 days).
I pitched the alt 2 weeks ago and the fermentation lock is still bubbling
away. Since i am going in for surgery Friday and will not be able to lift
a carboy for a week, would the Wyeast Alt be Ok for another 10 days?

Interesting question! I have been an enthusiastic, if non-professional cook
for more than 15 years, while my credentials as a scientist are strictly
those of an interested amateur.
 
I hadn't really thought of it this way, but yes, I approached brewing (which
I have been doing for about three or four years now) very much as I do
cooking: Read a lot and use recipes at first, but thereafter, go by
intuition and invent my own recipes, except when I want to duplicate a new
style, in which case I always follow a recipe (more or less) for the FIRST
batch.
 
I'll post this question (or an intuitive variation) on the CompuServe Beer
Forum to see how an overlapping group of brewers responds.

  Jeff F., A couple of questions about the yeast washing technique:  You 
said  to cool the sterile water to 38 degF.  Is that for lager yeast *and* 
ale  yeast?  Seems like it might be a shock to ale yeast sitting at 65 degF 
to go to 38 that quickly.  The other question is why do the viable yeasts
go into suspension in the water?  Is that just the nature of yeast, they
like to swim?


  Re. sour beer/Guiness:  I've got a "bad" case of brown ale, lactic infected,

wasn't a brown ale by any stretch, but it did have that fuzzy sourness of a 
lambic!  I'm going to put some into the dark depths of my cellar to age for
a year or so.  *Another* interesting experiment.  I'll put one into my next
batch of stout too.  When should I add it, at bottling time?

How about applauding the good ads out there?  What do you all think of
the new ad for Lite?  The one with the TV repairman who says "looks
like we gotta drain it"?  That actor is great....(the tv owner).
Watching last weekend during the football game, my wife and I decided
he did a great job of simultaneously portraying a "you've got to be
kidding" look and a "but, hey, cool if it works" look.


But calling commercials with the swedish bikini team selling beer with
sex seems a little strong.  I think the intent is a little more at
presenting a very humourous, totally unbelievable situation....
some people respond to that
type of humour and some don't (at least I thought it was funny, and
definitely did not see it as being very sexy (to me)).


What about the commercial with a whole group of people playing
volleyball on the beach?  Both men and women in bathing suits?  Is is
mutually offensive or non-offensive?

This is ridiculous.  Rape?  By definition, a rape victim is not willing
to perform the act, whatever the "act" is.  These women sure don't look
to be under duress to me, and they take the money for the work.  If you
have to say something criminal is going on, I'd guess you meant to say
prostitution.  Either way, such a statement is wrong.


And....commercials being the reason for violent crime?  I don't believe
commercials, pornography, etc...has anything to do with violent crime.
The same violent crimes were being committed prior to the existance of
"dirty pictures".  Violent crimes are the result of humans having a
lack of respect for anything but themselves...plain and simple.  Rotten
people are rotten people, whether they read/watch scantily clad women
commercials or go to church 7 days a week.

Yes, I've done this twice.  I leave the spruce in for the entire boil,
and use mostly dark extract in the recipe, and less hops than I would
if I didn't have the spruce.  It seems to matter that the growth be
new growth; the flavor the time I mixed in some old twigs was more
aggressively spruce than I really wanted.  I don't know anything about
the taxonomy of spruce trees; both the trees I used seemed to be OK.

I've got a light wheat lager sitting in a secondary fermenter now.  My
partial mash recipe for 5 gallons:


              3.3 lb  M&F light extract
                1 lb  Malted wheat
              3/4 oz  Hallertauer (boiling)
              1/4 oz  Hallertauer (finishing)
                2 tsp Gypsum
              1/4 tsp Alpha Amylase
                1 tsp Irish Moss
              3/4 cup Dextrose (conditioning)
                      Wyeast Pilsner Culture


Mash the wheat with Alpha Amylase at 135 F for 1-3 hours in 1 qt of
water.  Test with Iodine.  Sparge with 3 qt of water and boil before
adding the extract to avoid enzymatic changes to the barley malt.  Irish
Moss for the last 10 minutes of the boil and the finishing hops for the
last 2 minutes.  Ferment at 40-45 F for 6 weeks to 3 months.


I found that all the starch completed conversion at the end of one hour.
I held the mash temp at 130-135 in about 1 quart of water by mashing in
a microwave oven with a temperature probe.  The dissolved sugars were
fairly low.  SG was 1.027.


My thinking was that I wanted to extract as much fermentable sugars as
possible from the wheat I was using as an adjunct, as the wort is an
extremely light one.  I made it lightly hopped so that the hopping
wouldn't overpower the tanginess of the small amount of wheat.  I also
lagered to hopefully get a smoother, less estery quality.


You might consider mashing wheat with added enzymes.   I did it because
I partial-mashed; you might wish to do so because of a high wheat to
barley ratio.

Noticed the mention of spelt (a grain) in HBD 725.  Our local food coop
has been 'pushing' spelt as an alternative grain.  I forget why it's
supposed to be better, but for some, just different is sufficient
reason to try.  Apparently, it's mentioned in the Bible, and is now
coming back to some level of popularity.  Look around at "alternative"
grain suppliers, you may be able to find some locally.

Thanks for the yeast washing report.


My subsequent experiment with yeast washing bore out what Jeff says about
the 2 jar abbreviation: when doing the wash on a primary that had already had
much of the trub (cold break and hot break) removed before pitching,
the yeast sediment in the second jar was almost pure white in color.  The
water in the second bottle after sedimentation
was straw colored; I tend to think this
is not a problem, the main point being getting rid of trub.


Logsdon's demonstration fermenter
had a tremendous amount of trub in the bottom, yet
as Jeff says, the second jar looked pretty good.


P.S.: I'm looking forward to the Wyeast pamphlet Jeff and Dave are working
on.

        I have not brewed any myself, but I tasted some at a
club meeting. I'm going to try to reproduce the "interview"
our Glorious Leader conducted of the perpetrator of this
concoction.


        Glorious Leader: So this is your banana beer?


        Perpetrator: Yep.


        GL: So what was your procedure?


        P: I made up a medium bodied ale, and threw the
             bananas into the boil.


        GL: Whole bananas?


        P: Peels and all.


        GL: How much did you use?


        P: Fifteen pounds.


        GL: Why so much?


        P: They were on sale!


        The setting was a "Dr. Beer"-like tasting, and this
stuff was mouth-puckeringly bad. Horribly astringent, probably
from the peels. I can't imagine the starchy fruit adding much
besides chill haze to a brew, but if it were mashed along with
some malt you might get some fermentables out of it. The
banana esters, if present in this glop, were so overpowered
they were undetectable.

It seems that beer companies (silly ones anyway) think that bimbos are the only
way to sell beer - I have a friend who works for an ad agency, and he has worked
on two beer ads (for different companies) for TV.  While going through a
preliminary version of the first commercial, which already *had* "bimbos" in it,
he was told by the company rep "Great, but give them all bigger breasts"
(actually the language might have been even *more* sexist).  The second
commercial he did didn't have any women in it at all, just a climber ascending
a very famous Washington peak (hint hint as to what beer it is), and when the
company rep saw it, he said "Great, but where are the bimbos" (his wording, not
mine), so my friend had to add a scene at the end of the commercial which took
place on a beach! You would think that maybe they could just concentrate on
making good beer (how silly).

Subject: Plastic carboys.


All this talk about plastic has made me nervous.  I recently started a batch
of blackberry wine and sealed it in a plastic homemade carboy.  The body of the
carboy is a 20 litre bucket which was used commercialy for pickle
transportation.  Before you scream about flavor leeching from the previous
product let me tell you that I have used this for brewing cider, ale, and
stouts, with no off flavors.  The wine is fermenting happily but the length
of fermentation with some of the recent postings has me a little worried.
I will check when I get home to see if I can get a idea of the kind of
plastic used.  I figured that plastic which was ok to transport vinegar
would be ok for fermenting in.  Anyways given the current level of flames on
this digest I thought I could start another flame war.  So I will step to one
side put on my asbestos suit and let the fire start.

Subject: taking a sample for hydrometer reading




Tim Carlson wants to know how you get a sample from your fermenter to take a
hydrometer reading.


I use a (dedicated) basting bulb, the thing you use to baste turkeys.  Sanitize
it and then suck out as much as you need from the fermenter, put it into the
tube your hydrometer came in and drop the hydrometer in.  Take a reading.  Taste
the brew (or throw it out, but don't put it back in the fermenter!).  And keep
relaxing.

Subject: Banana beer, oh no ; Carlsberg emulator wanted.


Let me start be saying that I'm a beginner so don't laugh.
I read in HD#731 somthing about banana tasting beer, and that that means
the brew has gone wrong. That worries me, because I have my first batch
brewing right now, and it's been bubbling off a pleasant smelling
banana like scent from about half a day or so after it started bubbling.
It's an extract brew, Muntons Traditional Bitter. It said on the can
that it should brew at 18 to 21 deg c, but I had a hard time keeping
the temp down at first (I overlooked one radiator) but it never was more
than 22 degs in the room. From the second day or so the temp has been
around 20 deg c. Have I messed it up completely?
 Whatever happens with this kit, I have plans or dreams of brewing pilsner
from raw material. My all time favourite pilsner (or Lager as
most people wrongfully call it, at least in eng talking countries) is
Carlsberg Hof. It tastes almost as their export type, but not as good
(in my mouth anyway). I know that it isn't an all grain brew but has some
corn in it (did I get that right?), that's just about all i know. Has 
anyone got the recipe
of a good Carlsberg emulator? Do you think the brewery would help out
with a recipe (not likely I guess) or even a rough description?
If you wonder wy I'm so keen or brewing the stuff my self, just
consider the following: 33cl of real beer (not almost alc free) is 
at least 10 SEK that is about 1.4 USD or 10 GBP here in Sweden.


Thanx in advance.

Subject: extract double stout recipe


I made this recipe in November or December 1986.  I've still got a few
bottles, and I took one to the Ann Arbor Brewer's Guild meeting a
couple of weeks ago.  All who tried it (I poured out *small* tastes!)
agreed that it was quite good.  So I dug it out and am posting it for
your amusement/edification/use.  I have a "mod.recipes" n/troff source
for the recipe (it looks sort of like a Unix man page, but requires
special recipe macros for formatting).  If you would prefer that form,
I can send it to you upon request.


                          Double stout beer


          I would not recommend making this as your first beer, but if you
          are into brewing, and like a strong stout, then give this one a
          try.  Don't be in a hurry to drink it, though, it really benefits
          from a long aging.  I got the original recipe from Peter Lester
          in rec.food.drink, and formatted it for my local brewfriends.
          Then I thought that the net at large might enjoy it, too, so here
          it is with some additional notes from my experience at making it.


     INGREDIENTS (Makes about 2 cases)
          3 U.S. gallons
                    water
          2 1/2 oz  Bullion hops
          10 lbs    dark malt extract
          1 lb      black patent malt
          2 lbs     crystal malt
          1/2 lb    flaked barley
          1/4 lb    roasted barley
          1/2       licorice stick (see note below)
          1 tsp     ascorbic acid
          1/2 tsp   citric acid
          1 tsp     Irish moss
          1 1/2 oz  Golding hops
          2 tsp     yeast nutrient
          3/4 oz    ale yeast (three standard packages)


     PROCEDURE


               (1)  Combine water and Bullion hops.  Boil for 20 minutes.


               (2)  Add dark malt extract.  Boil for 20 minutes.


               (3)  Add black patent malt through Irish moss.  Boil for 5
                    minutes.


               (4)  Remove from heat and add Golding hops.  Steep for 5
                    minutes.


               (5)  Cool and add yeast nutrient and ale yeast.


               (6)  When fermentation has "stopped", add priming sugar and
                    bottle.


     NOTES
          Lester's initial specific gravity was 1.086 and his final
          specific gravity was 1.020 (alcohol about 8%).  His fermentation
          time was 11 days (a slow batch).


          My batch fermented in about a week (house temperature ranging
          between 60 and 68).  It was barely drinkable after 6 weeks, but
          delicious after 3 months. It's now been almost 5 years, and the last 
          few bottles are a little faded and mellow but still quite good.

Subject: Mail Order Malt






In HBD731, Kurt Swanson asks...


What experiences have other people had in securing a source for cheap, quality
malt?


In my experience, there are 2 stores nearby, here in Chicago.  One has good
quality grain, if you're willing to pay $1.25/lb, with no volume discount.  The
other has moderate prices, a volume discount, and bugs in the grain...


So, I tried a couple mail-order places.  The Malt House in Indiana sent me
25lbs. of 2-row for $17, but shipped it in a brown-paper grocery bag, sealed
with masking tape.  It was not completely dry, developed mold, and had some
dormant (and some not-so-dormant) bugs that looked curiously like malted grain,
except for the fact that barley doesn't have six legs.  The last place I
ordered from was The Malt Shop/Kettle Moraine Vineyards, in Wisconsin. except
for Rye malt, everything they had for sale was under $1/lb, and they have a
volume discount.  They also shipped it in thick, sealed, plastic bags of small
size - definite plus...


Does anyone have a good source for grain in the midwest (i'd like to stay in
UPS zone 2 to reduce shipping cost)???  Otherwise, it seems like the Malt Shop
is the way to go...


- ---- here's my experiences....


I have purchased mail-order grain from the Malt House and Stew's Brew
so far.


I have had the best results from Stew's Brew, with each batch getting
a good extract yield, and with very good clearing. He won't say what
kind of malt it is, but it looks and acts like a 6-row variety. It's
good quality, and a good price, ($17.50/32 lbs + shipping) so I'll
continue to use it.


The 50# of 2-row Klages I bought from the Malt House came in a brown
paper sack, and was clean and bug-free. I immediately removed it
from the bag and put it in double plastic bags inside of a large
plastic container with a lid, so it has stayed fresh just fine. The
extract rates have been OK, but not as consistent as with Stews malt.
I try to do about the same mashing procedure each time, but variances
are inevitable. The biggest problem I have had is with haze. The
beer is slow to clear, and I have found it necessary to use Polyclar
to get acceptable clarity. I'm sure by finding the "right" mashing
schedule, the haze can be reduced, but I haven't hit it yet. At
$29/50 lbs + shipping, the price is reasonable.


For what it's worth,
Alan Gerhardt

Subject: Recipes, Cooking


Hello Brewnuts!
        I've been asked to contribute a recipe to the general fund of human 
knowledge, so here goes:


                Wanking Fresh Deathbrew


                (not for the faint of heart)




        This is an all-malt brew, and the recipe is designed for
        a ten gallon batch, which is my standard.




        crush:
                20 lbs. 2-row brewer's malt*
                 4 lbs. 80 l crystal malt
                
        add crushed malt (I use a relatively fine grind; the grain is de-
        husked and the kernel broken into roughly square bits, perhaps
        three or four pieces per kernel) to:


                 5 gallons water at 135 degrees


        stir, add a bit of near boiling water to get about 120 -
 125 degree
        protein rest.
        After thirty minutes of stir-well-every-10-minutes (by the way, I
        use a pair of 40 quart cooler chests for mashing) add boiling water
        gradually (usually takes 2 gallons) to raise temperature to 155
        degrees.  Do this in stages...add a quart or two, stir well, stick
        in your thermometer, give it 5, read, add, repeat.  It takes a 
        while to equilibrate temps in the porridge, and you can easily 
        bring your mash to 170 degrees (a no no) if you add too fast.
        Let this sit with periodic (I usually figure that when my glass
        [16 ozs for the precisionists] is empty I need to stir the mash)
        stirring for a few hours (relax, get shit-faced).  The cooler chests
        hold heat very well, and I never did like messing with iodine.


        I sparge in another chest using a piece of anodized aluminum sheet
        with many little holes punched in it for a sparge filter.  The mundane
        use for this item is as a screen replacement for screen doors...it
        has 3 - 4 mm holes, and is available at hardware stores.  I merely
        cut and folded the whole sheet and screwed stainless steel screws
        into the bottom to hold the bottom about 2 inches from the bottom
        of the chest, stuck it in (being extremely careful about keeping the
        sides of this contraption right against the sides of the chest to
        prevent channeling of the sparge water down the sides), and then
        to use it:
        Add enough sparge water (170 - 180 degrees) to cover bottom of 
        sparge filter, carefully scoop in mash to form a nice filter bed,
        and gradually let the stuff settle, maintaining a slow flow.
        Another essential part of the sparger is a siphon break.  This is 
        a piece of tubing connecting the cooler drain to a T-junction, with
        one leg of the T open and the other connected to a piece of tubing
        leading to your boiler.  The open leg breaks any siphon effect, and
        by keeping the T at just below the fluid level in your sparger you
        maintain just that amount of hydrostatic pressure on your filter bed.
        Merely draining your sparger out the drain puts too  much pressure
        on the bed, compacting it and causing a stuck sparge.
        I sparge with:
                        11 gallons water
        
        This allows me to leave most of the bed intact and still suspended in
        fluid, minimizing the particulates.  Run some of the first runnings
        back into the sparger until you get some filtration effect.
        Sparge until the wort ain't sweet no more...my most scientific method
        for insuring good brew.  Periodically disturb the top inch or two
        of the sparge bed...you get more particulates that way, but it prevents
        some of the worst channeling.


        Collect up all that good stuff (I sparge off between 11 and 13 gallons
        depending on how long I want to drink while boiling) and boil roil
        troil and trouble (Ah, how Shakespeare would have loved me).
        About 30 minutes before you finally tire of boiling, add:


                5 ozs. Fuggles leaf hop**


        Rejoice in the aroma!  Offer up a joyous shout to the various and
        exquisite spirits of brewing and Baccanalia (sp?).  If you're 
        following my directions, you're probably fairly soused by now, so
        they are smiling upon you.
        Turn off the boil.  Caper briefly.  Add:


                2 ozs. Hallertauer leaf hop


        Ponder the irony of English and Germans producing hops which meet
        in splendid harmony.  Offer another shout to barbaric war-like 
        tribes peacefully inbibing.
        Cover.
        Cool.
        Slam that wortski onto a fermenting morass, the cake(s) from your
        last brew, recently stripped of their beery covering.  Or be 
        conventional, and use Whitbread Ale from the packet.
        Oh yes, the gravity on my last Deathbrew was about 1.063, which
        I consider on the light side.  Very nice red color.


        *I buy all my grain with a consortium of homebrewers from Briess
        Maltster near Madison, WI.  I'll get the address if anyone is 
        interested.  We buy in >1000 lb lots, and get the nice price break
        (my two row was about $38/100 lb).


        **I buy all hops from Freshops, which is somewhere out in CA.  I'll
        get that address too...our last buy was in >10 lb batches, and we
        paid about $7 - 9/lb., depending on variety.  Actually, I think 
        they're in OR, in the Williamette valley.  Exquisite hops.  Knock
        your nose off.


Well, there it is, in all of it's verbage and splendour.  I'll post a 
Christmas recipe without all the instructions sometime.  Love and kisses...

Subject: Strange flavor in bock


Last spring I made my first attempt at a lager beer - an American
bock style to be precise.  Everything went well and I have aged the
beer in the bottles all summer in the refrigerator, sampling one 
occaisionally.  Early on, I noticed an odd flavor - I can't really
describe it as I've never encountered anything like it before, but I
decided that it might be described as "mediciney", which I have heard
indicates phenols.  Whatever it is, I had hoped that it would go away
with age, but instead it became stronger and the beer is almost
undrinkable now.


The interesting thing is, I just got back from visiting a friend to
whom I'd given some of this beer just after it was bottled.  I told
him to age it in the fridge for awhile, but he forgot and kept it in
a warm closet for 3 months or so before putting it in the fridge.
His bottles taste good!  There is a hint of the off-flavor in his 
bottles, but it is very faint.


So why is the beer that was treated right bad and the beer that was
treated wrong good?  Anybody have any theories on this?

The return of cooler weather here in Texas has me starting up my
homebrewery again.  While making up a batch of India Pale Ale last
night, I discovered that the summer humidity had turned my DME into
something better suited to building a house out of rather than 
brewing beer from.  After several hours with a hammer and lots of
hot water, I finally managed to get it all dissolved.


I can assure you that I intend to store my water-loving DME more
carefully in the future, and to try not to keep any over the summer,
but, should it happen again, do any of you brew-experts have any 
suggestions on how to soften it up again?

To Tsamsel:


I've been brewing for seven years, mostly all-grain; I've been cooking
considerably longer than that, mostly East Asian (Chinese, Thai, etc.), even
spent some time cooking professionally. I *always* use a recipe to brew,
although it is generally self-generated. I model everything in advance on a
computer spreadsheet--very primitive, but it works. This allows me to control
the water chemistry, the hopping rate, and the mash cycle (therefore the
starting and finishing gravities): in other words, I know in advance how the
beer should turn out. The mental state of cooking is very different, for me,
than for brewing. During the brewing process, everything seems to move very
slowly and the final result is weeks or months away; while I'm cooking, I can
get instant feedback in terms of taste and aroma just by dipping into the food,
and I can make adjustments as I go. Then again, I'm usually trying to replicate
either a past creation or a classic (Lion's Head or Su Tung Po Pork), so I work
from a recipe of some sort when I cook. I'm not a *slave* to it, mind you, but
the recipe provides the framework.


To Tim Carlson:


Use the poor man's "wine thief": a *new* turkey baster. Sanitize it with
chlorine solution and suck out enough for the gravity reading. (Usually it takes
a couple of slurps; keep it sanitized in between.) DON'T put the sample back.
Drink it; even when it hasn't begun fermenting, the wort will give you lots of
clues about the final product. Besides, it tastes good, or it should.


To Anton Skaugset:


You're not "wasting" hops by adding them to the boil if you're going to dry-hop;
you are simply increasing the punch, and ensuring more hop *flavor*. In my
hoppiest ale, I add hops every 15 minutes through the 90 minute boil, add hops
in the hopback, and dry-hop in the keg. Whoosh. But then, I love hops!

I grew up on a farm in the Ozarks, where I was taught by my parents how
to cook, can, and also butcher and preserve meats.  I carried the canning
hobby to college with me when I went to Oregon State University for
grad school.  Corvallis was a great place for obtaining cheap fruits and
vegetables.  Later, I moved to Central Oregon, where fresh vegetables
and fruit are very difficult to find.  Home brewing became a good
substitute for the canning hobby, and even has its more enticing reward.


I have never followed a recipe exactly, out of a book, and I have only
tried to reproduce a particular recipe of my own two or three times.
I like the variety of trying different things.  Normally, I don't measure
any of the ingredients carefully, nor do I use strict measurement in
the amounts of water.  However, I do pay strict attention to temperature,
both during the mash and during the fermentation of my lagers.  I give
ales a free rein of temperature.

supplies as well as beer) has some pretty good prices.  


Pale 2 row malt (klages) and pale 6 row malt
1 lb........$.89
10 lbs.....$6.90 (69 cents per lb)
50 lbs....$29.50 (59 cents per lb)


They have a wide variety of specialty malts here they are. (lovibond ratings)
Munich Malt (10), (20), (30)
Crystal Malt (10), (20), (32), (40), (50), (60), (70), (80), (90), (120)
Vienna Malt (5)
Victory Malt (25) (says it's the same as toasted malt)
Cara Pils
Special Roast Malt (45) (a double malted barley)
Roasted Unmalted Barley (300)
Chocolate Malt (350)
Black Malt or Black Prinz (550) (can you say black...sure you can, the catalog
                                 says this malt has a bland flavor profile
                                 and is used mainly as a coloring agent)
Black Barley (550) (this is the black stuff with flavor)
Wheat Malt
1 lb.......$1.25
10 lbs.....$9.90 (99 cents per lb)
50 lbs....$39.50 (79 cents per lb)


Other Brewing grains that they have are Wild Rice (I was supprised to find
out talking to James that wild rice is a member of the barley family, and
is not closely related to the regular rice that A-B adds to bud.) Rolled
Oats, Flaked Corn, and Flaked Barley, all of these are $1.25 a pound, or
$5.00 for 5 lbs.


All of the above are american grains, I know that that they also have some
british grains including a british crystal malt that tastes really different
than the crystal made from american grains.  They're order line is
1-800-234-0685, hours from 9-5 M-F and the regular phone if have questions
or want them to send you a catalog or something is 612-331-2833.


I have been very happy doing business with them, they're real nice folks.

Batch #22
Helles Belles Maibock
Cat's Meow p.86
"My First Lager"


9# pale DME
1# crystal 40L
1# Munich malt
1# 2-row toasted
7 HBU Hallertauer = 1.53 oz (4.5%) -leaf
7 HBU Tettnanger = 1.84 oz (3.8%) -leaf
~1/2 oz Hallertauer finish
~1/2 oz Tettnanger finish
Whitbread lager yeast


"The toasted malt was done 5 minutes in a 350F oven."  My toasted malt
caught fire and filled the house with smoke.  Fortunately only toasted
1/2# at a time.  Boiling 3 gal. H2O.  Will pour into fermenter & add
chilled wort later.  Took all the shelves out of refrigerator to make
room for fermenter - there's hardly any room for beer!
As usual, put grains in bag in kettle, added 2 gal cold water, brought
to a boil.  Meantime, put ~4 oz cold water, ~2 tbsp corn sugar, yeast
in beer bottle w/airlock to hydrate.


I should call this "Murphy's Maibock" because everything went wrong.
I put the preboiled water in the refrigerator, but it doesn't get cold
enough in there, so I dropped in one of those reuseable ice packs to
help cool it.  When grains began to boil (over) I took the bag out and
added 3 gallons of water, hops, DME.  Boiled 50 min.  Added finishing
hops.  Boiled 10 minutes.  Cooled to ~75F.  Preboiled water was still
warm to the touch, but what the hell.  Removed (melted) ice pack and
started syphon.  Clogged.  Cleared.  Clogged.  Cleared.  etc.  Hed to
restart syphon each time.  Finally got tired of this, so I rinsed out
the grain bag, hung it in the fermenter, and poured from the kettle.
Filled bucket to top because I should have added ~1.5 gallons instead
of 3.  Syphoned out 1 gallon of beer and POURED IT OUT.  There are
hops all over my kitchen.  There are probably harmful bacteria all
over my beer.  It's not nearly heavy enough.


Oh well.

As a new (6 batches thus far) extract/partial mash homebrewer, I have
successfully used this technique for my last 4 batches.  My final temperature is
usually in the low 70's.  It enables me to pitch the yeast without any undue
delays.  I too would appreciate comments on any drawbacks to this technique.
