Subject: Anchor's Spruce beer


Contrary to an opinion in a recent HBD (which I can't find because I got
overzealous in tossing duplicates and tossed originals), I think the
balance in the Anchor Spruce beer (brewed for GABF X) was just right.  The
basic beer was relatively light, so as not to distract one's tastebuds,
but the amount of spruce essence was just about right.  It was definitely
there, at the level of "yeah, OK"--without being either "there's a little
something funny here but I can't tell what" or "jeez, that's strong."


It's not something I'm ready to sign up for drinking as an everyday beer
(unlike Steam), but if this were the way beer were made, I wouldn't be put
off it.


Maybe, if you find the spruce essence too strong, it's because you don't
spend enough time among evergreens?  (You might suggest that I spend too
much time there; I'll remonstrate that I don't think that's possible.:-)

I think this whole thing is getting way too commercial for HBD.  Perhaps
I'd feel better if arf were teaching standard homebrew practice, but the
couple go-rounds we've had here suggest that he's putting iconoclasm ahead
of basic teaching, and in the process he's getting us to help with the
editing.  Even if that were not the case, I'm not sure I'd like HBD as an
advertising medium.

I tried some sour mash beers at the last AHA conference.  IMHO, the sourness
was _completely_ different than the lambic sourness.  I've chosen to avoid
this route in creating pseudo-lambics.  Your mileage may vary.


> Also, is there a retail source for belgian yeast?
As far as I can tell there are no retail sources for the yeast/bacteria yet.
I know that Wyeast is planning to market a trappist yeast this fall, but
this is _not_ suitable (at least not alone) for lambics.  One of the
reasons you can't get these cultures commercially is that they scare the
s___ out of most commercial establishments -- most of the yeasts and
bacterias used in making lambics are considered fairly nasty contaminants.
I should note here that I have _never_ had any rampant infections in
the time I've been using these critters.


Sources for cultures as well as all sorts of helpfull hints are discussed in
the lambic mailing list.  You can join this mailing list by sending a note to:

John's Raspberry Ale
- --------------------


Ingredients:
        6 lbs.  Williams' English Light malt extract
        1/2 lb. crystal malt (unknown Lovibond)


        2 oz.   Hallertau hops (4.0 AA%)  (45 minutes)
        1/2 oz. Hallertau hops (4.0 AA%)  (5 minutes)


        4 lbs.  raspberries


        Wyeast liquid yeast (can't remember which ale yeast
           was used, and the ink ran there when it got wet.
           I think it was the London ale, but not sure.)


Directions:


        Prepared 1 quart starter two nights before.  Didn't get a
        heavy krauesen, just started to get a light foam covering
        at pitching time.


        Purchased raspberries at farmers' market the day before,
        then tossed in the freezer overnight (to break down cell
        walls or something).


        Pre-boiled some water.  Cooled some and froze some.


        Prepared wort as usual, steeping crystal malt in 150-160F
        water while the brew pot water was heating up and sparged
        into the brewpot.  Boiled about an hour.


        At the end of the boil, I just tossed all the raspberries
        into the brewpot and let sit for fifteen minutes.  Wort
        was pretty cool by then.


        The first scary part--I couldn't filter out the hops and
        trub without leaving behind raspberries.  So I tossed
        *everything* into the fermenter.  With the raspberries
        in there, I figured I couldn't get any S.G. readings, so
        didn't try.


        In spite of everything, this came out very very well,
        with rave reviews from everyone.

We made a batch of this ourselves Sunday, and measured the gravity at about
1.050.  I agree, the extra three pounds of dry extract is required to reach
the stated gravity.


This was an awfully fun batch to brew, BTW.  The aroma was just wonderful,
and with the first cold autumn winds beginning to blow it really started to
put me in a holiday spirit.  In fact, at one point I thought I heard the
prancing of 32 tiny hooves on the roof (but then, I was already pretty
"relaxed," shall we say, at that point.) 8-)

Subject: Rotokegs and SA Octoberfest


 About the Rotokeg... I had one and never had a successful batch with it.
The first problem I had with it was with the pressure regulator. As the
pressure would increase it would open as expected to vent the excess. But
when the pressure decreased, it wouldn't fully close and all the pressure
would be lost. I replaced it with a pressure gauge and manual vent system a
friend set up for me. This worked until the seam by the filler opening
split and I gave up. The one I had was the big ball and was made of two
pieces, "welded" together. I gave up at this point. I now have the English
brown barrel type of keg that I've never had problems with. I just received
some info on the Batch Latch system that allows you to convert a beer ball
to use as a keg. It looks interesting. Has anyone tried it?


 About Sam Adams Octoberfest... I bought it this weekend and I was
disappointed. Compared to some other fest beers I thought it was thin and
lacked sufficient malt character. It seemed to me to be an attempt to appeal
to the BudMiller drinker and not an emulation of a particular style. As a
side note, Sam Adams Wheat Beer appeared in my local outlet in late
Spetember and doesn't seem to be selling quickly. I've yet to try it as my
thoughts have moved on ales ( it get cold early here in Western NY ).

Ooops - I think I just sent two blank messages - sorry.


Anyways, John Reed asked if anyone has tried this year's S.A. Oktoberfest
beer.  I have, and I thought it was OK.


I can't be very scientific about this, but all I can say is that it tasted
like a Sam Adams product (hop characteristics?) as opposed to the Oktober-
fest brew I was drinking in the Paulaner Tent two weeks ago.


Still worth a chug tho.  (In otherwords, it didn't taste like any German
beer I've had recently).

I forget who told me this, but I heard that Sam Adams wasn't a brewer
at all.  Rather, he was the area's largest malter, and sold malted barley.

Subject:  Pear Beer?


I have a pear tree in my back yard that produces prodigious
amounts of fruit that I usually wind up throwing away.  As a
brewer, other possibilities come to mind...


Does pear beer sound good or gross?


I imagine I would wash the pears is a sodium metabisulfate
solution, peel them, chop them up some, and toss them into the
primary fermenter as soon as the yeast looks like it has taken
control of the wort.  


I plan to rely on the yeast to maintain sterility rather than
pasteurizing the fruit by any boiling.  I would not want boil off
any of the volatile aromatics of the fruit.  These are what I
like best about pears.


Has anyone had such a beverage?


Should I do it with a lager or an ale?

  First, I have heard that Sam Adams was actually a *maltster*, not a brewer,
for what that's worth.


  Those of you who sparge all at once in a big cooler, do you use a rectangular
cooler or a cylindrical one?  How did you cut the slots in the copper tubing?


  Re. yeast slurry:  Last night I pitched saved slurry dated 9/17/91.  It was
the 3rd batch for that yeast, originally Wyeast Chico ale.  I saved myself
from worrying by making up a starter with it, and by tasting the beer layer
that was on top.  The beer was fine, the starter was fast, and so when the
6 gallons of brew didn't start fermenting after 6 hours, I didn't worry.  It
was fermenting madly this morning.


  A good way to enhance wort chilling is to have 2 chillers, connected by
plastic tubing.  The first is connected to the faucet, and sits in a bucket of 
ice, the other (bigger) one sits in the wort.  Especially helpful if your
tap water is warm.


  Here's what I brewed:


   Stout Stout
   --------------
   10 lb. pale malt (2-row)
    1 lb. roasted barley
    1 lb. flaked barley
   0.5 lb. crystal malt
   1+ oz. centennial whole hops (at 10.1 AAU)  (science or art?)  boil 60 min.
   no finishing hops
   Wyeast Chico ale slurry


   Mash water: 3 gallons `at` 170 degF
   Mash in: 153 deg F for 90 minutes
   Mash out:  forgot to do it
   Sparge: 5 gallons `at` 170 deg F


   Don't know what the OG was, but it should be in the 1.050 range, or higher
if you get better extraction rates.  This one should be prime by Halloween.

I have seen and had both Sam Adams Boston Ale, and their Stock Ale.  I 
suspect they are identical because I couldn't tell any difference with both 
bottles at my elbo.  I've wondered about this labeling anomaly.  Last time 
I bought the Boston Ale, the bottles said Stock Ale on them, even though

Subject: Father Barleywine's yeast reuse trick -- first attempt


A couple weeks ago I made up a double batch of basic weizenbier -- 13.2#
American Classic wheat-beer extract (60% wheat, 40% barley), some
hallertauer, some tettnanger, and finish with haller again. I pitched a
750ml starter of Wyeast wheat-beer yeast into the two carboys and
fermentation was going in under 24 hours. 


After a week I racked to secondaries, and a week after that began brewing
another double batch, the same recipe as above but with 50% more extract
and alphas. While it was chilling, I siphoned the beer out of the carboys
and into kegs, priming with a gallon saved wort split between the two kegs.


I then dumped the new wort on top of the yeast in the secondaries, and the
stuff took off in well under 8 hours, almost explosively! I came home to
find the foam had gotten into the airlock, displaced the water, and was not
happily bubbling out through the top, coating the carboy in gooey muck and
dribbling all over the counter. I was delighted!


Now it's calmed down and the krausen looks great -- dense bubbles and so
on. This technique is a winner. One question, Father: this is great for doing
multiple batches of the same or similar beer (same yeast); what do you do
if you want a different style, just start over with a new yeast?


A question for HBD-land: Wyeast wheat-beer is (unfortunately) a mix of
S. Delbrukii a basic beer yeast. Do you think repitching like this would
select for eventual domination by one or the other strain?


One other thing: I think F.B. pitches on top of the yeast bed in the
*primary*. I understand his rational about not having to clean stuff and
worry about new sources for contamination. Mine was too full of muck for me
to want to do that, hence the secondary.

My response to the request for tried and tested recipes:


Here's my best ever brew:


Don's Most Wickid Ale (A.K.A. number nine, number nine, number nine...)


6 lb. Pale ale malt
3/4 lb. crystal malt
1/4 lb. black patent malt


1 lb. corn sugar
1 cup blackstrap molases
(strong stuff. don't mess with any wimpy Brer Rabbit stuff.)


Wyeast 1028 London Ale yeast


10 AAU Northern Brewer, 60 min. boil
6 AAU Cascade, steep


1/2 cu. corn sugar to prime


yield:  52 12-oz bottles (5 gal. batch)
OG 1.052
FG 1.010


Mashed grains in 10 qt. water at 150 F for 90 min
mash pH 5.5
mash-out  5 min. `at` 168 F
sparge with 5 gal. water `at`168 F


Disolved sugar and molases into runnings
Boiled 90 min.
Cooled.  Let sit over night. Racked off trub and pitched yeast.
Temp at pitching: 62F
After five days in primary, racked to secondary.  Left for ten days.
Racked into bottling bucket with disolved priming sugar and bottled.
All fermenting and conditioning was done at 60-65F.


Tasting notes:
Tasted quite smoky and bitter at bottling.  Kind of like a Porter
rather than the brown ale I had in mind.
Four weeks later...WOW!
Both the smokyness and bitterness had mellowed.  The beer was very dark,
very malty with a complex flavor from the molases and black patent malt.
The malt was balanced perfectly by the hops.  My best beer yet.
Had a thick, rich, smooth and long lasting head.


I've tried to reproduce this beer.  That effort has been bottle
conditioning for three weeks now.  I'll know soon how it turned out.


I'm not aware of any commercial brew with which this beer can be
compared.  It sits between the brown ales available and something
like an imperial stout or Mackeson XXX.  


Finally, don't Knock the use of a pound of sugar.  It comes to only 
about 1/7 of fermentables, sugar is standard in British brewing
and most importantly IT WORKED!

Once I used Irish moss in my kettle.  Maybe I used too much, but when it

>Brian Bliss asks if anyone has added amylase to the secondary.


The last beer I made consisted of a partial mash of 1 pound
of wheat flakes which I mashed by adding amalayse extract to just
the wheat and some water.  Not knowing whether the amalayse contained
alpha or beta or both, I just held the "mash" at 150F for an hour.
A few weeks later, activity in the secondary had stopped but the beer
was still cloudy.  So I said what the hell and tossed in a teaspoon
of amalayse.  The next day, there was a krausen on top!  Good thing
I had left a fair bit of space or things would have been messy.
It took about another 2 months for activity to subside enough for me
to feel safe bottling it.  It turned out great.  Very clean taste, and
as a friend said "hey, this stuff has absolutely no aftertase".  After
all, I essentially just did the same thing as the big breweries do to
make dry beer -- use extra enzymes to get more complete fermentation.
The next time I do this, I will mash at 135F for an hour, and add more
hops by dry hopping.  The long time in the secondary didn't help the
beer's hop bouquet or flavour.

Subject: Shocking Yeast Story..


Just what is the symptoms of temperature shock to yeast?


Three days after claiming I never worry about minor temperature
differentials when pitching lager yeast, I seem to have a dead batch.
I pitched about 1 cup of dormant lager yeast at 53f, that had been
very active two weeks before when "fed" a pint of .028 wort, into 5.5
gals of 1.050 wort at 73f.  I then stuck the fermenter into the fridge
at 48f.  Now, two days later there is no sign of fermentation.


This is wYeast bavarian lager.  It was very slow `at` 48f for my Vienna
Angst lager (tasty stuff, even if I did bite my fingers off waiting
for the four week ferment to complete!).  I thought, for sure,
repitching a cup of the yeast would make the next batch o beer ferment
much faster.  The yeast did ferment out the pint of extra wort very
fast (one day!) and the resulting beer (decanted off the yeast before
pitching, tasted pretty good, if a bit green, being only two weeks old.

The brewery in Cambridge, Maryland, which produces Wild Goose also makes
Thomas Point Light, which is not to be confused with "lite beer"; it is a
tasty pale ale with just a bit less body and hops than Wild Goose.
(TPL is named for a navigational marker well known to all who sail the
Chesapeake Bay). I believe these guys also make Saint Michael's Nonalcoholic
beer, which is the only example of this genre which I have actually enjoyed.

I drink Anchor Steam when on the left coast so I don't know if Sam Adams
Boston Ale has made it there, but it is available in bottles in most decent
beer stores in the Baltimore/D.C. area. We also see a decent variety of
their limited edition beers, such as Wheat, Doppelbock, and Oktoberfest,
at various times of the year.




And thanks to everyone who replied to my (feeble) idea to cut bottle washing
time by popping your rinsed bottles into the microwave. Many folks pointed
out that you can't heat a dry bottle (or a dry anything) with a microwave.
Darryl Steve Russell Richman had further good advice:

My hope was that, though the bottles are dry, the microbes which would
infect the beer would have enough water to be scorched to harmlessness
in very little time. My sundry siblings with PhD's in biochemistry and
botany said this would be true for active bacteria and wild yeasts, but
that spores don't have enough water in them to be acted on by microwaves;
and spores are the primary source of infection. They recommended cooking
the bottles at 500 F for 45 minutes. They're used to lab glassware so
they couldn't say what that would do to a beer bottle.


Btw, thanks to Father Barleywine for the repitching idea. My partner and
I brewed a pumpkin ale using Bavarian Ale yeast, then poured the wort for
an Oktoberfest beer onto the yeast cake. Fermentation was extremely
vigorous within five hours (at 75 F). We're glad we used a gallon jug on
the receiving end of our blow-off tube.

I am not certain about the origins of the name for Fritz Maytag's place, but
there is an Anchor Brewery in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England.  It brews under
the name of Gibbs Mew PLC.  I did not have a chance to sample them this trip

The recent spate of messages about UK brews brought back fond memories
of my trip to the UK and Austria in August and I just can't resist
posting something about the brews and pubs I enjoyed.


A week on the Isle of Skye, in Scotland, was rather unimpressive for
ale, probably because the region is still strongly dominated by
prohibition sentiments.  However, our lst night in Scotland was in
Glasgow where we stumbled upon a wonderful pub, The Halt, just around
the corner from the youth hostel. A free house, they had 8 brews on
tap; 2 were "specials" which change regularly (the signs on the taps
were hand written).  That night the specials were Old Peculiar and
"Cask #3 Ale".  The former astounded me with its richness and
mouth-feel; I had only previously had it bottled -- what a
difference!.  Didn't try the ale.  Also available were Murphy's Irish
Stout, Guinness, McEwan's Bitter and Lager, Harp Lager and one other
lager.  All of this served up to the sounds of a very good jazz
quartet (Wednesday's are jazz, Thrusdays are a folk jam).  The Halt is
no tourist trap; we were rubbing shoulders at the bar with folks who
clearly had it as their local.


Later in the trip we were in Cambridge where I got hooked on Greene
King Abbot Ale, the definitive heavy duty ale, IMHO!  It was
particularly enjoyably served with lunch at The Zebra.  Honourable
mention to The Royal Oaks in Barrington, a pleasant bank holiday
afternoon's cycle ride outside Cambridge.  Also worth a sip is Greene
King IPA.


In Austria the August heat of continental summer caused me to revise
my opinion of lager, particularly the hoppy Styrian varieties (from
south-eastern Austria) served ice cold.  I also very much enjoyed my
first opportunity to try weissebier.  The Styrian stiftbier and Wiener
dunkelbier are dark, rich beers with little hoppiness and an almost
molasses-like taste that took a little getting used to.


Travelling sure is a pleasant way to expand one's beer horizons...

I can attest to the fact that it is, in fact, available over here on
the left coast.  In fact, it's all over the place.  I've seen it in
supermarkets (Lucky) and liquor stores - heck, even Pizzeria Uno
restaurants here in Sillycon Valley have the beer on tap.

I just happened to pick up a six pack last week while I was at a
conference in San Diego, of all places.  (Can't get much further from
Boston than San Diego and still be in the conterminous 48 states!)
The Octoberfest is quite a good beer with all the flavor and possibly
even more body than found in Samuel Adams regular brew.  It comes
highly reccomended, at least by me!

In theory, it would; microbes, like most living organisms, are mostly water.


However, the problem is hitting something that small with a microwave in
a reasonable amount of time. Think of microbes as kernels of popcorn you're
trying to pop, and consider that there are always unpopped kernels in
microwave[d] popcorn, even the prepackaged stuff with the special bag.
Skipping a technical explanation [read: I've forgotten most of it], the
odds of hitting something the size of a kernel with a microwave (whose
wavelength is probably larger than the kernel) is small; you can pop corn
only by putting so many kernels together that a wave going through that
neighborhood \has/ to hit one or another of them.


If you nuked a dry bottle long enough (hours? days?) you'd probably get the
microbe population low enough for safety---but in the meantime, as Darryl
points out, you'd burn out the microwave generator (because 99.99...% of
the energy it's putting out isn't getting absorbed).

 <It's my understanding that microwave energy requires moisture to generate
 heat (those bi-polar water molecules oscillating in the field, you know).
 
 We have discussed this subject under sterilizing petri dishes and yeast 
 culture stuff but the same applies here.
 
 Although, I have not done the double blind experiments, it appears that a few 
 drops of water and one minute does the trick.  I have been sterilizing a 
 hummingbird feeder bottle for several years by nuking it for one min with a 
 few drops of water in it.  It was regularly turning to vinigar before I 
 started this procedure.
 
 However, I believe that water is unnecessary because living organisms contain 
 water and because micro-organisms are so small, they would be instantaneously 
 exploded with a very short exposure to micro waves.
 
 I do not know about the moisture content of spores but as it takes one hour 
 of steam at 10 psi to destroy Botulism spores, normal sterilization used by 
 brewers would not affect them anyway.
 
 My guess is that wild yeasts and the "normal" spoilage bacteria found in 
 homebrew, could be killed in a microwave oven without ever warming the bottle 
 or harming the magnetron.  If it makes you feel better, put a cup of water in 
 the oven, not in the bottles.  However, all it will do is absorb energy that 
 would otherwise zap the microbes and increase the time proportionately.
 
 I will try to devise an experiment to determine the validity of this 
 hypothesis.

                NEVERMIND!!!!!!!!!
 
 Since typing this up, I did some experiments.  the most telling is...
 
 I placed .2 grams of dried yeast (Fleishman's baking) in each of (3) 10 ml
 glass bottles.
 
        # 1 control
        # 2 nuked for 10 seconds
        # 3 nuked for 30 seconds
 
 Added 5 ml of sterilized sugar water to each and screwed on plastic caps.
 
 One hour later they all appeared to fermenting vigorously and gas escaped 
 when the caps were loosened.
 ..............
 
 Apparently, dormant dry yeast is dry enough to make it immune to microwave 
 energy.
 
 So, it appears that sterilizing bottles in a microwave requires enough water 
 to generate steam and enough time to heat the bottle thouroughly.  This makes 
 it totally uneconomical for anything outher than a couple of bottles or petri 
 dishes and lab samples.

Subject: On #738 & 739


In Digest #738/To Ron Carlson:


First thing you should do is brew another batch of beer; get over this weirdness
about warnings from the brewing gods. Without knowing anything about your beer
but that it was a "scotch ale", I'm necessarily guessing, but I would suggest
that the "liver" was protein. This past spring I brewed a wheat beer with a very
high proportion of wheat malt, and discovered great grey pads of latex floating
in my boil. I suspected they didn't belong there, since I'd never seen such a
thing before, so I fished them out. The beer was fine. It's possible that some
failure in the mash resulted in your wort containing some unhydrolizable
protein. Some of this probably scorched on your heating element, as well.


To Dave Ballard:


Do you rack your beer to a secondary fermenter? I started doing this a long time
ago, partly to resolve the very problem you're describing. This process leaves a
lot of mung back in the first carboy; when it comes time to rack from the
secondary to the bottling bucket, there's very little yeast left to carry over.
The little red thang works just fine then.


To Brian Bliss:


The idea of adding amylase *at all* is fairly bizarre; certainly I can think of
no earthly reason to add it in the boil. The WYeast product is a weizenbier
strain but I have found it difficult to consistently reproduce the clove flavor
associated with these beers. Best result was when Dave used a combination of the
weizenbier and a lager yeast with a relatively warm ferment (60^?). Purty good.


To Darryl:


We got ex-editors, too. Namely me, ex-editor of the OBC. Pleased as punch, by
the bye, to hear that you're moving to the Northwest. Good choice. Under our new
laws, of course, you'll need to find someone willing to *leave* when you arrive.
Who have you chosen?


To Jack Schmidling:


I'm not concerned that you list me as a source, I'm concerned that you describe
the transcription of my notes on a five-minute telephone conversation as
"research." I'm also somewhat nonplussed to hear that you've never tasted anyone
else's homebrew. Howcum? The guy who suggested your beer would taste "cidery"
because of oxidation has got it wrong. Oxidized beer generally tastes remarkably
like cardboard, although in extreme cases the oxidation apparently imparts a
sherry-like quality (haven't run across this enough to personally verify it). I
was fortunate enough to taste a beer a long-time homebrewer brought into
Steinbart's once. He'd been culturing his own yeast for 40 years, and made a
remarkably clean beer from Blue Ribbon extract and lots of sugar. It was
actually pretty tasty--if you like 7-UP; didn't taste much like beer. The cidery
quality comes from an excessive amount of non-malt sugar.


To Steve Carter:


Like you, I've had to take beer in and out of the fridge many times; never had a
problem.


To Brian Smithey:


Samuel Adams Boston Ale is available in Portland, OR. I believe that it is
brewed in Boston rather than here at the Blitz Weinhard Brewery as the West
Coast SA Lager is. Not sure about their specialty beers. We never did see the SA
Wheat Beer that I kept hearing about on the CompuServe Forum. Their Oktoberfest
should be out; last year's was really yummy.


On #739/To Brian Kush:


You're serving your beer too damn cold! The beer should last fine, just
periodically (every time you change the keg) clean the lines and the tap
thoroughly. A local supply store should have the proper cleaners.


And to respond to a request for recipes, here is my current version of House
Ale. Very simple and received with universal acclaim:


For 5 gallons


British ale malt        9#
British crystal                1/2#

Mash with 3-1/2 gals. of water at 155^F (our water is very soft; I add
4 gr gypsum and .25 g epsom salts in mash; double that in the sparge water) for
90 minutes (sometimes much less; check with iodine at 45 min.).


Sparge to 6 gallons, boil 90 minutes. After 15 minutes, add 3/4 oz. Eroica. At
end-boil, add 1 ounce Mt. Hood hops. Ferment at 65^F with WYeast American Ale
yeast (in starter). Bottle two weeks later, drink one week later. Yummy.

With all the newsletters, newsgroups, magazines and mailing lists I've
been through (lots of time to read while batch #1 readies for bottling
:-), I'm not sure if this has already been mentioned.  I apologize if
it has.  The only forum I _know_ to have mention of this is
_Yankee_Brew_News_ (free at Modern Brewer, Barleymalt & Vine, etc.).


Barleymalt & Vine, a local homebrew supplier, is hosting a visit by
Charlie Papazian, who will be signing copies of the new edition of his
_Complete_Joy_Of_Homebrewing_.  He'll be at the Framingham store (280
Worcester Road == Route 9) from 10am to 2pm, and at the West Roxbury
store (4 Corey Street, just off the VFW Parkway) from 2:30pm to 6pm.  A
dinner and beer-tasting is to follow at the Boston Fencing Club.
tickets for the dinner are $30 (for $37 they throw in a copy of the
book), and reservations may be made by calling the Framingham store
at 508-820-3392.

Subject: Neophyte's Impressions Of Boston-Area Suppliers




As we prepare to bottle our first batch, I thought I'd take time out to
offer my observations on several local suppliers.  I visited their
stores as we prepared to get into this hobby, and at various times
since.


Barleymalt & Vine   280 Worcester Rd. Framingham 508-820-3392


    The Framingham store (in the basement of a store for collectors of
    records and baseball cards) is reportedly new; the original, which
    I've not visited, is in West Roxbury.  Fairly extensive inventory
    of extracts, including Munton & Fison in bulk.  Standard array of
    tools and books.  The place looks sparse, but is actually
    well-stocked.  Prices consistent with other shops.  Ad says prices
    recently dropped, but cashier said prices actually went up a bit
    recently.


Boston Brewin'             75 Maple Street Danvers 01923 508-777-2337.


    Homebrew and darts.  Not as many extracts as other shops, but 
    he picked the key ones.  Prices compare favorably, except for the
    True-Brew kit, which is about $15 higher than elsewhere.  Definitely
    worth a visit when you don't care to drive into town.  


Modern Brewer       2034 Mass. Av. Cambridge 02140 617-868-5580


    My favorite, so far, and right around the corner from work.  Second
    most-extensive selection of canned extracts, and one of only two
    selling bulk that I know of.  Best selection of books and all the
    Zymurgy special issues.  Lots o' yeast (two refrigerators - no
    waiting :-).  Prices acceptable (better deals on gadgets than raw
    material), particularly on equipment kits (this is where we got 
    our gear).


Wine and Beer Hobby 180 New Boston St. Woburn 01801 617-662-0872


    Helpful hint: this is in the Woburn industrial park near the mall.
    The town fathers apparently decided to cut it off from the rest of
    New Boston Street, which is residential.  Don't  try to pick it up
    near the Purity Supreme and head north; get off at the Washington
    Street exit and head south.


    Most extensive selection of canned extracts and chemicals, with
    slightly higher prices.  Fair selection of books.  Equipment kits
    priced a bit steep.  Prices on new bottles highest of the four
    stores.  Worth the trip to see the hot-tub-sized winemaking vats.


Hope this is of some use.  Off to the kitchen now :-).


                                -Jim.

A while back I posted a request for an uncompressed version of the Cat's Meow
recipe book with the promise to forward copies to readers who do not have
access to FTP or who do not have a unix based machine. The response was
overwhelming and I sent out a copy to every reader who requested one from me.
I hope everyone got theirs. If you didn't it's not my fault.


I have had to use a friend's E-mail account to do this because of a limited
quota allotment in my own account. Well, it's coming to the time when I must
hand control of the account back to its rightful owner. Therefore I am writing
to notify HDers that my offer to send uncompressed copies will stand until this
Friday, October 11th, 1991. If you need a copy let me know ASAP.
