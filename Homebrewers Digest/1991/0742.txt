If you sent in an article recently that has not appeared in the digest
(including this one), please re-send it. A file with incorrect
permissions caused all incoming articles since last Wednesday to be
silently devnullified (ie, thrown away without a trace.)


Also, for all those who are worried about missing digests, there have
been *no* digests sent out since last week. The last one was #741,
dated October 9.


If you sent me a message asking about what happened, I probably
ignored it. Sorry, but it's impossible to reply personally to
everyone. You'll also probably notice that I've stopped sending
replies for most requests, though I do act on them. Subscription
requests are still replied to automatically. Requests for back 
issues are, unfortunately, completely ignored.

Subject: Yeast and Spec. Grav's.


There's been a few questions lately about yeast and characteristics associated
with them.  Here is a retype of some information I received from Wyeast
relative to their yeast.  This information was obtained a while ago and
supposedly this was to be updated and expanded.  If anyone has the latest
update I would appreciate a copy of it from you since Wyeast wasn't too
tickled that I contacted them directly.  Sorry if there are any typos.


YEAST CHARACTERISTICS


   Some yeast strains are more active and vigorous than others.  Lager strains
   in particular do not show as much activity on the surface as many of the
   Ale strains.  We provide an adequate quantity of yeast to complete fermen-
   tation with varying amounts of lag time depending on strain, freshness,
   handling, and temperature.  If you find it too slow, make a starter as
   recommended on the package.  In any event, a closed fermenter with an
   airlock is recommended.


TEMPERATURE


   The slow onset of visible signs of fermentation can be improved by starting
   fermentation at 75 deg. F (24 deg. C) until activity is evident, then
   moving to your desired fermentation temperature.  A few degrees does make
   a significant difference without adversely affecting flavor.


   The normal temperature for Ale yeast range from 60-75 deg. F (16-24 deg. C)
   A few strains ferment well down to 55 deg. F (13 deg. C).  68 deg. F (20
   deg. C) is a good average.  Lager strains normally ferment from 32-75 deg.
   F (0-24 deg. C).  50-55 deg. F (10-12 deg. C) is customary for primary
   fermentation.  A slow steady reduction to 32 deg. F (0 deg. C) during
   secondary fermentation typically works well.


   The fermentation rate is directly related to temperature.  The lower the
   temperature, the slower fermentation commences.  Fluctuations in tempera-
   ture such as cooling and warming from night to day can adversely affect
   yeast performance.


ATTENUATION


   Apparent attenuation of yeast normally ranges from 67-77%.  The attenuation
   is determined by the composition of the wort or juice and the yeast strain
   used.  Each yeast strain ferments different sugars to varying degrees,
   resulting in higher or lower final gravities.  This will affect the resid-
   ual sweetness and body.


FLOCCULATION


   All brewing yeast flocculate.  The degree and type of flocculation varies
   for different yeast.  Some strains clump into very lary flocculate.  Some
   floc very little into a more granular consistency.  Most yeast strains
   clump and flocculate to a moderate degree.


pH RANGES


   Typical pH range for yeast fermentations begins at about 5.1 and optimally
   4.8.  During the course of fermentation the pH reduces to typically 3.9-
   4.1 and as low as 3.1 in some wines.


ALCOHOL TOLERANCES


   The alcohol tolerance for most brewing yeast is as least to 8%.  Barley
   wines to 12% can be produced by most Ale strains.  Pitching rates need to
   be increased proportionally to higher gravities.  Alternately, Champagne
   and Wine yeast can be used for high gravities sometimes reaching alcohols
   to 18%.


YEAST PROFILES

   added to juice any time after the onset of yeast fermentation when sulfur
   dioxide is less than 15 ppm.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There have also been some questions about Spec. Grav's. and conversion to 60
deg. F (15.6 deg. C).  The following is the information that came with my
hydrometer.


   TEMPERATURE CONVERSION


   This hydrometer gives an accurate reading when the temperature of the
   liquid is 60 deg. F (15.6 deg. C).  The following tables show how to
   correct for temperature difference.


               Temperature
             ---------------         Spec. Grav.
             deg. F   deg. C         Correction
             ------   ------         ----------
               50      10.0            - 0.5
               60      15.6              0
               70      21.1            + 1
               77      25.0            + 2
               84      28.9            + 3
               95      35.0            + 5
              105      40.6            + 7


   Example:


      Specific Gravity is:       1.100   at 84 deg. F.
      Correction figure is:     +    3   to correct to 60 deg. F.
                                 -----
      Corrected Spec. Grav. is:  1.103
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I plot Correction vs. Temperature and keep this plot in the back of my
brewing note book for quick and handy visual reference.  This data does not
yield a linear relationship thus a graph is quicker to work with than some
polynomial equation. 


I hope some of this information helps.

Subject: Boston Ale




The Boston Ale is brewed in 2 places. 
A lot of the draft Ale, particularly for local consumption is brewed here in
Boston in the Jamaica Plain brewery using what used to be Bill Newman's Albany
Amber brewing setup. I am told that the bottling line there is fully functional
and that from time to time they do bottle some of the Boston Ale brewed there.


However most of the Boston Ale found in the bottles is brewed at the F.X.
Matt's brewing company in Utica, N.Y. under contract. Also some of the keg beer
found outside the Boston market is brewed there as well.


The Lager product, both bottle and draft is produced by the Pittsburgh Brewing
Co. of Pittsburgh. Pa. under contract.


This information is correvt as of sometime earlier this summer when I was at
the brewery, though these arrangements are fluid (get the pun :-), and of
course may have changed.
