Bill wisely included the recipes *and* fermentation temperatures, but
my possible source for the "Bandaid (tm)" flavor/smell is, alas, unrelated
to these two pieces of information.  The off flavor/smell is due to phenolics.
According to the Zymurgy troubleshooting issue, Troubleshooting chart, it
can be caused by:


Chlorinated (tap) water, wild yeast, bacteria, oversparging of mash, boiling
grains, cleaning compound residue, plastic hoses and gaskets, and defective
bottlecap linings.


I ommitted a few causes listed in the Troubleshooting Chart from the
troubleshooting issue (Vol 10, #4, Special issue 1987) because I disagree
with them (so there!) and have included a few which I think are less likely
to cause the particular flavor with which you are concerned (bottlecap
linings, oversparging and boiling grains, specifically) but this is just
intuition.  I have not personally had this problem, so I'm afraid my
suggestions are based upon reading, combined with intuition, but for what
it's worth, I think that the most likely sources are:


1. chlorinated sanitizing solution residue (solution: rinse better) and


2. chlorinated water (solution: boil all the water you are using in the beer).

A general comment, not part of any previous debate...


Jack sez:
>I used to see the owner of the local 
 brew shop standing outside his shop watching cars go by, every time I passed 
 and I just assumed the hobby was as unpopular as it ever.


Poor guy. Don't know what he's doing wrong. My friend Jeff owns the Modern
Brewer here in Cambridge, Ma. He's been open a little over a year and he's
doing really good business right now, even with the bad economy. My observation
is that the growth in interest in micro-brewed beers and homebrewing is very
strong. Of course these are my observations here in Beantown (and a few other
areas I've traveled to, your mileage may vary..)


> My target was and still is all those people out there that do not even know 
 that one can make drinkable beer at home.  Let's face it, most of them like 
 Bud.


My personal experience is that few people go from Bud to homebrew. Typically
they "discover" microbrews or imports and their tastes change before they make
the leap to brewing themselves. Again your mileage may vary.. (hey let's
introduce a new acronym for this... YMMV)

Jack I'm not sure what to make of this reply, I think you may have
misunderstood. The cloviness comes from the YEAST  not the wheat malt..., 
Red Star Ale, which you said you used to use until recently if I read this right,
(which I stopped using long ago after a friend got the banana beer that tasted 
more like bananas than bananas do..) is reputed to produce clove flavors under 
certain fermentation conditions (I don't know what these are supposed to be).

What to do if you don't have a convenient dark storage place for your
fermenting beer?


Take a standard brown grocery bag and cut a hole in the center of the bottom.
Make this hole slightly larger than the neck of your carboy. Invert the bag
and place it over your five gallon carboy, it's a perfect fit.


I'm sure if you put the carboy in direct sunlight in Southern California (;-)
you could still damage the beer, but under "normal" circumstances you should
be OK. If you want added protection, use two bags.

Subject: Hey,  Jackie baby - chill out.


Not everyone on the HBD is your nemesis.  Either you are pulling
peoples cords just to see what kind of boing they make or you are
being a bit too defensive.


Anyway, my recipe for oxidized doctored beer was a attempt in helping
you understand the oxidized flavor/aroma in beer so you would be
better equiped to detect it in your homebrew beer.  I don't necessarily
think that you will detect oxidation in your "mishandled" beer.  Why?
Because it is my belief that if you have
active yeast in your beer, oxidation may not be an issue.  Beer that
is primed and bottled has live yeast in it.  Live yeast is very
reductive (?) and chews up the oxygen + reduces the oxidized
components.  I have heard that damaged beer can be revived by adding
fresh wort, yeast and letting it re-ferment. I think that is what
happens for many home brews: they are harsh at first (green?) and
then as they age they mellow out.  I think it is the yeast doing it's
magic. Comment, Dave Rose, George Fix?


Anyway, I lager in the refer (ales and lagers) until the beer is
fairly clear.  I then keg and artifically carbonate.  There is little
or no yeast activity at this point.  If I am not careful about O2
infiltration I get a distinct "stale" taste/smell to my beers (sample
of 2 out of 17 so far).  I have never had that happen with bottled
homebrew or kegs I primed. Typically, my beers are very drinkable/clean
as soon as I carbonate them.  Aging helps, but not nearly as much as
it helped my old, sloppy, bottled extract beers of long ago.


The point is that you may well be right that oxidation is not an
issue for homebrews if the air infiltration is not grotesque and
there is a secondary ferment in the bottle.  It probably depends upon
the gestalt of your brewing setup.  What works for you might not work
in all cases.  Knowing the defects and what the underlying causese are
can help you determine what is important for your setup (or videos!)


As for skunk beer in Miller bottles: I trust you were kidding me...
The beer has been doctored, not the glass!

Subject:    priming with honey


I posted an article in the last week of September about priming
with honey when someone else was asking.  Anyways, for a 5 US
gallon batch, I use about 3 or 3.5 oz of liquid honey, but I
tend to prefer a lighter carbonated beer when compared to my
homebrewing buddies.  You are better off brewing a flatter beer
the first time, and then adjusting the amount of honey you use.


Make sure you boil the honey with some water to kill off any
live cultures that might exist in the honey.  It also makes the
priming "sugar" mix better with the beer.  I just pour the boiled
honey and water into my priming pail shortly after starting my
siphon from the carboy.  Never had a problem.

A while back someone(I think it was Chris Shenton) asked about doctoring 
beer in order to train judges etc. 


Our club has done this several times in the past with good results.


In addition to skunky(light struck) and oxidized beers mentioned in HBD we 
have used the following:


          Metalic taste       FeSO4
                                                                                sweet taste         sugar
          acidic              lactic acid or vinegar
          alcoholic           vodka
          medicine taste      listerine
          phenolic            phenol
          butterscotch        diacetyl(use butter or buterscotch flavoring)
          ester flavor        bannana oil


In place of the listerine and the phenol last time we used oil of cloves.  
This seemed to work as well or better than the listerine and phenol and is 
easier to get than the phenol for most people.


Hope this helps.

When I read this,"Everytime I sit in the courtyard at Produce Row, sipping a

To Pat Patterson:


Here's some results from the honey-priming experiment I did:
I didn't want to reply until I had some results.  I used 1/2 cup of clover
honey from the grocery store, and it worked great.  I just boiled it in a
pint or two of water and primed as usual.  A week later I've got plenty of
carbonation and no off-flavors.  I wouldn't use more than 1/2 cup.

I'd be quite surprised Dave if you use unplugged sterile pipettes to dispense
your yeast. The fibrous plug found in the top of culturing pipettes is tightly
packed and adsorbant enough to stop potential microbial contamination carried
by microscopic particles dispelled with each humid breath.

If you've ever done animal cell culture or bacterial culture using media much
richer than liquid malt or malt/agar you'd know, from painful experience, that
breath is not sterile.

I'd tend to agree with this without any contradiction to my above comments. The
media conditions must be hospitable to potential contaminants and acidic hopped
wort may not be well received by the types of microbes in your breath.
Furthermore, no homebrewer's wort is "sterile" but this poses no problem if
enough healthy yeast are pitched to outgrow other life forms. I'm still extra
careful anyways. It helps me RDWHAHB. ;-}

centre, requires the B-complex to provide cofactors for various detox pathways.
The high demand for B-vitamins results more in a shortage than an imbalance.
I've had better luck taking time-released B-complex prior to indulgence rather
than after but either way will help. As mentioned above, plenty of water is
still the best treatment since it rehydrates the spinal fluids and helps to
flush ones system of toxins. Taking a teaspoon of fructose rich honey along with
water also provides the liver with a good energy source.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but are you sure that _seeds_ were specified in
the recipe? Coriander seeds have a _very different_ flavor from the
leaves, which are yet again different from the root. Three completely
different spices from one incredibly groovy plant. I can't remember the
recipe that was given, but the leaf flavor is the most common one in
most forms of cooking (aka chinese parsley). Off the top of my head, I
would think I'd prefer the leaf flavor (common in Mexican and Indian cooking)
in beer to the seeds. But then, maybe I'm completely off base.

Subject: Counterflow chillers


Greetings friends and neighbors:


I've been quiet enough lately.  Guess I should put my two cents in on 
the chiller discussion.  I'm not trying to be testy.  Just want to 
make sure things remain balanced. 


And please, let's don't ever say "m_m__y" again.  It's a stupid word 
and besides, my Mom wouldn't even think of making beer!


>While on the subject, I'd like to add a couple more reasons that I feel the
>immersion chiller is better than the counterflow type:

>tubing, and


Actually I find sanitation and cleaning of the counterflow chiller to 
be just as easy and effective as sanitizing the immersion type.  Drain 
the chiller body of cooling water after a round of brewing and siphon 
boiling hot water through the empty chiller until the boiling hot 
water exits the bottom.  Store it dry.  


Before the next brewing session, I generally siphon some of my just-
prepared, ever-present solution of 1 Tbsp. clorox to 1 gallon of water 
sterilant solution through the copper and let it sit for 20-30 
minutes.  That's not enough to corrode the copper, BTW.  Then just to 
make EXTRA sure that everything's sterile, I start my chilling session 
with the chiller dry, so that immediately after the short clorox soak, 
the copper comes into contact with boiling hot wort.  If boiling hot 
wort is good enough to sterilize the outside of immersion chillers, 
it's good enough to sterilize the inside of counterflow chillers, too, 
unless I'm missing something. :-)


>3. I, personally, would not want to start a siphon (with my mouth (besides
>the sanitation risk) or by other means (turkey baster, etc.)) on a 170+ F
>liquid!


Me neither.  That's why I (a) either let the clorox water that's 
inside the chiller start the siphon or (b) insert a small 2" piece of 
3/8" tubing into the end of the siphon hose and suck on it.  When the 
wort approaches the mouth, pinch the hose shut, remove the tubing, and 
direct the flow to the fermenter.


I do like the fact that the counterflow chiller chills the wort very 
quickly.  One drop of wort goes from 212 degreess to 70 degrees in 
about 6 seconds and then comes into immediate contact with the yeast.  
Not much time for a bacterial infection there.


Whichever chiller you decide to use -- and in the end it is a matter 
of personal choice -- I do agree that it's the time-saving features of 
the chiller that I enjoy the most.  But I happily accept the 
associated reduced risk of contamination and better cold-break.


While on the subject of time-saving, again, I might as well make the 
point that the counterflow chiller saves more time especially if you 
make a habit of siphoning into the fermenter anyway.  With the 
counterflow, you can start siphoning into the fermenter immediately.  
With the immersion, you have to wait 20 or 30 minutes for the wort to 
chill before you can begin the siphon. 


A nit-picking point, I admit.  But, hey, at least I'm not arguing 
about whether oxidation is a real phenomenon.  The first 3 or 4 
batches of beer that I kegged were deep-sixed because I couldn't tell 
whether it was beer or some sort of weird sherry.


As for initiating homebrewers into our hobby,  I emphasize the 
following:


Use good ingredients, good recipes, and good clean equipment.  Make up 
a 4 or 5 gallon batch of sterilant and soak everything that touches 
the cooled beer in it for 20 or 30 minutes.  Keep racking to a 
minimum.  When it's time to rack, treat your beer like your lover.  Be 
gentle with her.  Don't abuse her.  Don't slap her around or dump her 
into bed, er, I mean, the carboy.  Ease her into it.   Talk nice to 
her.  Let her know you care. 


See!  That wasn't difficult was it?  Homebrewing is easy. 


Hey, Darryl, you radical!  You've gone from "Eunuchs" to Microsoft and 
MSDOS!!!  My how the mighty have fallen!  Is there any hope left for 
us all?  Where is the truth?  What is realty?

Hi.  Last night I brewed up some beer and when I had everything in the

temperature should be about 70 - 75 degrees I waited till the next
morning, but I had trouble relaxing.  It seems to me, in retrospect,
that it would have been ok at that temperature.  So for the future,
what is considered the outside pitching temperature for ale yeast and

I am still convinced that I have read of a study that compared a

wort/beer to be deficient in some molecules that are considered
good in beer.  I could swear this was done at UC Davis.  However,
I can't find a reference, but some of my Beer & Brewing books are

blow-off makes your beer marginally less tasty.


Anyway, I bring this up to the net to see if anyone can find a
thorough study that either supports or refutes my belief.

A brewer friend of mine regularly uses lactose in his stouts to
get them sweeter, so it is fairly common.


A caveat!  Please warn your guests that you have done so, in case
one of them may be lactose-intolerant.  It is no fun for them, as
they will usually not suspect beer of containing lactose and not
prepare properly.

Someone commented that swing-top bottles were unacceptable at AHA

would like to suggest that for competitions, please use nice clean
unscratched 12 oz. standard longnecks.  It is ok to use 10 to 14 oz.
brown or green bottles (please do spectrophotometer readings to test
for light blockage between 423-587 nanometers ;-) but it is much
better to use the standard bottles, it makes life easier for
everyone.  I have directed an AHA state competition and a judged a 
coupla AHA nationals and its makes life easier if the bottles are 
all uniform.  I talked to Dave Welker (AHA national director) about 
this and he had to disqualify some good brews because they were out

RE: Hangovers
Alcohol gets converted (by alcohol dehydrogenase) to acetaldehyde,
which is sickening, it builds up because alcohol is converted to
acetaldehyde faster than acetaldehyde is broken down.  The
acetaldehyde probably causes the majority of problems (along with
fusel oils) it causes direct cell damage and is a free radical.  
L-Cystine scavenges the free radicals off of the acetaldehyde 
and in single blind experiments (unpublished observations) it seems 
to alleviate the 'edge' of a hangover when given with lots of 
water and b vitamin complex prior to processing the majority of 
the alcohol consumed. Interested parties ;) are refered to

The Saffron Superkeg, a 6+ US gallon plastic keg with an (optional?) cap
for CO2 cylinders and a pressure relief valve, is distributed in the US
by Crosby & Baker.  Your homebrew store should be able to order it from
them.


It happens that I kegged my first batch in one last night, so I can't
give any practical results yet.  However, be warned, as I was, that such
kegs are designed for British "real ale" levels of carbonation, i.e.,
very low.  The Superkeg is designed for at most 15 psi, which is the
nominal level at which the relief valve opens.  Since I'm drinking my
last batch (a porter) by keeping the bottles at room temperature, and
letting the beer sit a few minutes after opening to allow it go flat
(it tastes best to me like that), I don't expect a problem.  "Your

A couple of months back there were a couple of 
postings regarding bacteria found in a Wyeast
package of German Ale yeast #1007.  Being that
I use this particular yeast a lot and have had
no problems with it I had my homebrew shop check
into the report and see if they could find 
anything out from the manufacturer. 


They finally got a change to call Wyeast regarding
the reports about an infected batch of #1007.  
According to Wyeast they have not had any reports
of an infected batch of yeast.  They do inspect each
batch, but for obvious reasons not each package.
They do take these reports seriously and are looking
into the matter.


So, if and when I get any more info I will post it.


Still not worrying,

  First, R. Al M. talked about some "ring-around-the-bottle".  Most likely

  Thomas M. got "possible food poisoning" from his infected wort.  Yes, it's
possible, but more likely you just picked up a flu bug.  There's a bug out
now (I'm just over it, knock on wood), that mimics food poisoning pretty
well, with stomach pains that are *unbelievable*.  In the past I got what
I thought was food poisoning after eating at a restaurant, went to the
emergency room, and found 5 other people with the same symptoms, who hadn't
eaten at the restaurant.  The culprit?  Flu. The hospital folk said 
"stomach distress" cases are much more likely to be the flu than food 
poisoning.  So it could have been FP, but my experience says it's not likely,

Well, that *is* pretty nervous ;-).  I guess I've not made myself clear,
and I'm sorry about that.  From the point of view of the brewer, it makes
sense to protect their beer as well as is necessary with their methods.
For homebrewers, this may not require the use of dark brown bottles, since
they (often) know better.  For a commercial brewer bottle color may not
matter at all since ignorant retailers (by far the majority) can hurt
them regardless.


But, from the point of view of the taster/judge, bottle color makes no
difference, since a clear bottle may contain perfectly fine beer, and the
darkest brown bottle may contain skunk juice.  I take as my starting
point that commercial beer will be skunky if I don't know how it was
treated, and that homebrew will not (since there is a "real" person
behind it who would do their best not to hurt it).  I also wanted to
make the point, since I've heard about judges who automatically assume that
beer in a green bottle is of lower quality than brown (and more than once),
that that is an outrageous and unwarranted assumption.

Let me try to ferment two worts with one pitch, as it were.  I've tried
to duplicate Xingu, but reduce some of the roast barley bite.  I think
I've succeeded, though I haven't done a side by side comparison.  I
believe that Xingu is what's known in the UK as a milk stout, as I
believe that lactose is used to add body and to very slightly sweeten
the flavor.


Here's "Josh's Better Xingu."  Again, it's close to Xingu, but I think
its better:


To make 5 gallons:


6.6 lbs M&F Dark Extract
1   lb  Crystal Malt
1/2 lb  Chocolate Malt
1/4 lb  Black Patent Malt
1/4 lb  Roast Barley
1/2 lb  Lactose
2   oz  Northern Brewer (Boiling only.  No finishing hops.)
        Gypsum
3/4 cup Dextrose (priming)
        Wyeast 1028


Crack and steep specialty grains at 150 F for about an hour in 1/2 gal
water.  Sparge with 1.5 gallons of 165 F water.  Add the extract and
Gypsum.  When boiling, add the hops.  Boil for one hour, add the
lactose to the boil for the last 15 minutes.


Primary 3-7 days
Secondary 7-14 days

Jack, most of us who use "blow-off" methodologies do so using a 5
gallon carboy as the primary fermentation vessel.  The benefits are
closed fermentation and removal of crap with reduced risk of infection.


>BTW, I like skimming.  It makes me feel like I am contributing something to

You'd mentioned earlier (in rec.crafts.brewing) that you've been losing
two out of ten batches to contamination.  It may be possible that your
open fermentation and/or skim technique may be contributing to this.


I used to use a 7.5 gallon plastic tub, and skim, and had similar
problems, no matter how careful I was with sanitation.  I switched to
a closed fermentation technique some years ago and haven't had an
infection since.  I truly believe this was due to airborne stuff in
my house, as the same procedures and ingredients would produce great
beer one time and weed killer the next, due to infection.


Check out Papazian's book.  The first section, supposedly for beginners,
will show you the carboy/blowoff methodology and has a great discussion
on using plastic primary fermenters at its end.

Hey now-  I just wanted to add my $.02 on light damage and skunkiness
since I had a recent problem concerning just that.  I decided (after 
some prompting) to enter my first batch, a pale ale, in the NYCHG
competition in NYC on 11/2.  I was pretty psyched 'cause the stuff 
came out really good and has been improving with age.  The age at
judging time was about 5 weeks after bottling.  


Anyway, I check out the judges sheets after the contest and their only 
real complaint was skunkiness.  Now, I had a bottle of the stuff on the 
night of 11/1 and it was anything but skunky.  I cracked open a left-over
bottle at the competition and sure enough it smelled/tasted like Pepe le
Peu's bathwater!  All I can figure out is this-  when I dropped my 
three bottles off at Greg Zaccardi's (who did a great job organizing
by the way), we were standing around bs-ing for like 10 or 15 minutes and
the bottled were in the sun.  The were brown Whitbred bottles, really thick.


I guess this doesn't add much to the conversation other than more 
proof that exposure of even just 10 or 15 minutes is enough to do
some extensive damage...

Due to numerous requests (four, to be exact) here's the "recipe" for

We didn't keep any notes on the garlic beer, so here's my best recollection:


6# plain light extract syrup (hopped?  who knows...)
2oz Cascade leaf (60 min)
2oz Cascade leaf (10 min)
one Big Thing of garlic (maybe half the size of your fist)
Whitbread dry ale yeast


The procedure is the same as for any simple extract beer.  Chop up the
garlic and throw it into the boil for the full 60 minutes.  If you
don't want quite so much garlic flavor, strain the garlic bits out
before racking (we didn't).

Yow!  It's Very Important!  You can get good results without aerating
(although you didn't this time), but if you want your yeast to really
take off, aeration makes all the difference.  Here's what I do:


        - Rack into carboy (or bucket or whatever)
        - Seal it up
        - Shake it and roll it and slosh it for two or three minutes
        - Open it up and pitch the yeast

A little, but probably not much.  Try shaking the hell out of it.  This
should stir up the sediment and aerate it at the same time.  If that
doesn't help, jeez I don't know...maybe your yeast died somewhere
between the packet and the beer.


>My wort is still okay, right?


Probably...


>I can go out and get some more yeast and pitch again, right?


Absolutely.  It sounds like that's probably the best bet.  You might
want to throw some dry yeast in right away instead of waiting for
another Wyeast packet to inflate...  (asbestos on)


good luck

UV filters for cameras DO work.  Ordinary glass only blocks SHORT wave UV,

Try this...  With a decent 35mm SLR, and color film (especially slide)
shoot some distant scenic pictures of say mountains on a reasonably
clear day.  Shoot a few more with a standard (SKY) UV filter.  Shoot some
more with a HAZE filter.  The pictures shot with a naked lens will show a
