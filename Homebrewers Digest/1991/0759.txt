        Though I am reluctant to continue what is essentially a very boring
thread, I do not use plugged pipettes.  They are just open, sterile, glass
pipettes.

        It is true that I havent done cell culture work in some time, but
I don't think the result would be any different.  Cell culture work is tough
because the generation times of the cells are so long that fast growing
organisms can easily take over the culture; I don't think it has much to
do with the culture media.  The media we use in the lab is a good deal 
richer than liquid malt.  It's yeast extract, peptone, and glucose as a 
carbon source.  Granted I have not performed the experiment with fetal calf
serum or some other cell culture medium, but I doubt I would get a different
result.


        Anyway, we both agree (I think) on the important aspect of this issue:
That in wort the technique is safe.  Whether that's because breath is sterile
or because what critters it contains are present in very low titer or can't
grow in wort isn't really the issue.


        I'm also happy to note that the 'm' word is taking it's knocks out
there.  But I am also concerned that "your mileage may vary" is rapidly
taking it's place as annoying phraseology of the moment....

In Homebrew Digest #757 (November 07, 1991) Richard Stueven
(Richard.Stueven`at`Corp.Sun.COM) responds to a query in Homebrew Digest

I thought "someone else" would address the question, which I think was
missed by Richard.  That is, liquid yeast, even when properly
activated, does not supply sufficient quantities of active yeast for a
vigorous start to fermentation of a 5 gallon batch.  Certainly,
aeration _is_ important, but I think this is secondary to creating a
"sufficient" quantity of active starter.


J>>  [... from #756]    But, by this time, the package was filled with
J>>lots of gas -- like, I was half expecting it to splatter all over the
J>>room when I opened it up. (It didn't.) So I dribbled the yeast into my
J>>carboy.


Creating a "sufficient" quantity of active starter has been recommended
by other contributors in HBD;  in Miller's book, and it might even be
on the Wyeast package.  Otherwise, you'll experience long lag times.
Jacob, I'll bet by now your fermentation has taken off.


Here's what I do for building the starter solution:


About five days before I intend to brew, I pop the inner "bubble" inside
the Wyeast package, and set it aside on the counter in my kitchen.  A
couple of days later when the packet is swollen, I sanitize a 12 oz beer
bottle and fermentation lock and beer-bottle-size stopper.  I open my
jar of "canned starter wort" (a la Miller) and measure about 3/4 of a
beer bottle (_NOT_ with the sanitized one!) into a covered saucepan.  I
bring this wort to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes.  I do this because
I can my starter wort in quart jars and keep the opened jars
refrigerated.  Some people rehydrate dried malt extract instead of
using "canned starter";  I'm told that works just fine, too.


The covered saucepan goes into the freezer to cool down to ~80-90
degrees F.  I flame the mouth of the sanitized beer bottle (with a
propane torch, but only briefly!) and pour the cooled wort into the
bottle.  The swollen liquid yeast packet is swabbed with alcohol, and
the scissors run through the flame of the propane torch.  I shake the
packet and then snip off one of the upper corners.  The contents are
carefully poured into the sanitized beer bottle, and the fermentation
lock placed on the bottle.  The bottle is then agitated (to aerate) and
set aside.


In a day or so when active fermentation is observed, I sanitize a 22 oz
beer bottle;  boil/cool another ~3/4 of a 12 oz beer bottle's worth of
starter;  flame the mouth of the 22 oz beer bottle and pour the cooled
wort into the 22 oz bottle and agitate to aerate.  The 12 oz bottle of
already-fermenting starter is poured into the 22 oz beer bottle, and
the fermentation lock placed on the larger bottle.  A day or so later,
I've got a pint of vigorous starter, suitable for pitching.


Some people recommend making even greater quantities, like a quart
(another day to double from a pint) or even a half-gallon (doubled
again).  I once did a half-gallon starter, and the fermentation took
off like a shot!  Even with a low starting gravity 5 gallon batch in a
6.5 gallon carboy, I had significant blowoff through the blowoff tube!
For all practical purposes, fermentation was complete within 24 hours!

Tee, hee.  Couldn't resist.


Regarding dry vs wet yeasts.  I notice that in the Zymurgy yeast issue
one manufacture of dry yeast got pretty darn high marks for yeast quality -
even better than *most* of the wet yeasts tested (not many).  That was
Whitbread Ale and Lager yeast.  I have been using the ale exclusively for
the last year with good results.  Certainly there has not been any defects
that could be obviously traced to the yeast variety.  Even recycling the
yeast several times produced excellent results.  Now that is cheap yeast!


My latest lager was jumped started with a packet of Whitbread Lager.  I was
pretty nervous since I have always used "Official Wet Lager Yeast" in the
past.  However, it appears to have turned out Ok.  It looks, tastes and
smells like a lager.


It is my opinion that unless one is a Very Refined Super Duper Brewer
that the whitbread yeast can take one pretty far down the road to perfect
beer.  It is cheap, it is Vigorus, it is clean and as Father Barleywine noted
the Ale will ferment in lager temps producing lager like beers.


My guess is that having a large amount of viable yeast prevents a whole rash
of other problems that get introduced when underpitching wet yeast. Yeah, I
know a starter is the right thing to do, but sometimes it just doesn't work
out correctly and one still gets the 48-72 hour lag period.  In my experience
that never happens with a packet of whitbread.


Cheers!

        Just to clarify this a bit, it is really sub-500 nm light which
is of concern here.  The 400 nm limit was somewhat artificially placed
on this issue by the measurement range of my equipment.  Note that the
lower the wavelength is from 500 nm, the more efficient it will be in
lightstriking beer, with the most efficient damage taking place in the
UV.  As I've stated this damage may occur up to 520 nm, but is unlikely
to take place very efficiently here. 
        Another reason the 400-500 nm range was singled out by me was 
that it is the light which is most likely to effect even the most careful
homebrewer (or retailer) because incandescent lights have significant
intensity at these wavelengths (not to mention the more harmful
flourescent, sunlight sources).  Therefore, if you have the choice, I
recommend you keep your beer in brown bottles, especially for
competitions where you don't know for sure how they'll be stored.  And
yes, I do have green bottles which I use on occasion :-).

        I wholeheartedly agree that bottle color should not prejudice a
judge on the merits of a beer in competition.  I definitely do my best
not to think about such thinks when judging, and to concentrate on what
I'm tasting.  I do think that as far as the normal homebrewer is
concerned, this statement is clouding the issue of bottle color.  What I
tried to show in my previous submission was that brown bottles are
definitely more resistant to the lightstruck flaw than green or
clear bottles.  This had not been previously proven, at least to me.  In
addition, however, I stated that brown bottles are not the answer to the
problem, as Dave's submission indicated:

What is important to keep track of here is that Dave's entries
would have definitely been worse if he had used green or clear bottles,
and that is true regardless of whether you believe the <500 nm or the
520 nm camps (I've already put my word in on that one).  I just felt it
was very important to stress this as the most important point of
this lightstruck discussion from a practical standpoint, and I didn't
want it to get lost in all this other discussion.

So Darryl (or whoever), while we're on the subject, what do you think of Rager's
vs. Burch's kettle hop utilization numbers?  From personal results, I'm in
Burch's corner on this one.  For those unfamiliar, these two
sources vary considerably in the 25 to 45 minute boiling time regime.
While these numbers are approximations which will vary from batch to
batch, we the homebrewers have to start with a number somewhere, and then
adjust our results accordingly.

Comments well-taken.  The trouble I have with this theory is that it
doesn't explain the correlation to types or brands of beer.  Below is
a list of beers that give me a headache:


        Nearly all brands of US beer.
        Some German beers consumed in Germany.
        Any and all bottled or fresh microbrewed beer.


Below is a list of beers that have never given me a headache regardless
of quantity consumed:


        My home-brewed beer.
        A certain beer brewed commercially right here in Oregon
                and costing very little per 1/2 case.
        Most German beers comsumed in Germany.


To me this continues to be the greatest mystery about beer and home

Hello!  I just wanted to drop a quick Email to give my greetings and

        I have seen those beginning kits that is basically a big bag that
one fills with water (I assume) and lets it ferment for awhile.  I think
they may require a bit more care than that but I not sure.  Nonetheless,
is this an easy place to start?  Do they work?  I think those sorts of

 components.  I have heard that damaged beer can be revived by adding
 fresh wort, yeast and letting it re-ferment. I think that is what
 happens for many home brews: they are harsh at first (green?) and
 then as they age they mellow out.  I think it is the yeast doing it's
 magic. Comment, Dave Rose, George Fix?
 
 This is great.  You start out by boinking me for being a boor then procede to

 Not sure how to transmit gestalt on a video tape but I think we finally have

I've gotten to the point where I'm happy with the flavor of my brews and
I'm working on appearance; more specifically chillproofing.  I've had

Irish moss is traditional in the brewing of ales.  What of its use in

Should it refuse to clear, I am considering using gelatin finings.  My
concern is that gelatin is known to precipitate yeast.  Should I
anticipate any problem with having enough yeast to bottle condition 
after gelatin fining?


As a final aside, Miller says that oxidation during sparging can
contribute to chill haze and recommends finding a sparging method
that minimizes splashing.  I myself use a two-quart pitcher to
transfer sparge water into my lauter tun.  This does involve 
considerable splashing.  Any comments on the relative contribution
of sparge splashing to chill haze?  What about ideas for splash-free
sparging in a 5-gallon food bucket lauter tun?  I tend to think that
splashing at this point isn't too critical because 1) the water and
wort are at 168F or less and hence not as reactive as boiling wort,
and 2) any O2 dissolved into the wort at this point that hasn't
reacted may be driven off during the subsequent boil.


Any Ideas are appreciated.

Would some kind soul keep us informed of the play dates/times on the Discovery
Channel for the "BEER HUNTER"?
  Also, garlic and chiles do keep away pestiferous arthropodal fauna.
  And the lower stem of cilantro is more "root" flavored than the leaf. I use
it for Thai curry.

Hey now-  I finally ventured across the river from Piscataway to New
Brunswick to check out a place called The Old Bay.  They have amazing
New Orleans style food as well as Clements and Stoudts on tap.  We
chatted with the bartender and managed to get samples of a pilsner
and ale from Stoudts and a red ale from Clements (the best of the 
three).  He then brought over a glass and announced it was something 
new from Clements- a blonde double bock.  It was a beautiful gold color
with a really nice head, and lots of chill haze.  It tasted great! Real
nice hop/malt balance, leaning towards malt with a definite alcohol
twang (it's about 9% by volume).  For those of you around central NJ,
you gotta give it a try.


Does anyone have any thoughts on how to make a blonde double bock?  I would
assume there's a ton pf pale malt to start with, due to the color and 
haze.  I would definitely like to give it a try.


Oh yeah, the line of the night had to be when the bartender asks: "You 
guys aren't by any chance homebrewers, are you?"  That got quite a chuckle...


later!

I found a copy of Roger Protz's "The Real Ale Drinker's Almanac" in a
Chicago bookstore.  It's definitely a nice-to-have if you enjoy
bitters and pale ales and want to brew them.  Here's what he says
about Hook Norton Best Bitter.


Original Gravity:  1036
Alcohol by Volume:  3.3%


Ingredients:  Maris Otter pale malt 94%
              flaked maize           6%
              caramel for coloring
              Fuggles, Goldings, and Challenger whole hops


Tasting notes:


Nose--pronounced hop resin aroma with grain and fruit developing
Palate--Light dry balance of grain and hop with delicate finish and
        some citric fruit notes
Comments--A distinctive pale bitter with some light fruit complexity.

Subject:  Canning Wort


Some people e-mailed me requesting more info on my canning procedure, so
I figured I'd post it to the digest.  Sorry I've taken so long to do
this.


The main thing I use the canning for is making priming solutions.  I
also sometimes use it to make pre-prepared starters.


To make a priming solution I added whatever amount (I usually use around
1 cup) of dry malt extract to 1 qt canning jars and then fill the jars
with hot water.  Put the lids on the jars and shake to mix up the
extract.  The extract doesn't need to be completely dissolved, the
canning will take care of things.


Put the jars and some water in the pressure cooker, close it up, and
start heating.  If you have the type with a weight that controls
pressure, leave it off until steam has been to escaping for about 10
minutes.


Put on the weight and monitor the pressure.  When it hits 15 lbs, start
your timer.  Depending on your stove, you may have to cut back on the
heat to keep the pressure from rising.


After 15 minutes, turn off the stove and let the cooker cool.  When it
is cool, take the jars out and put them somewhere to cool further.  Try
to avoid drafty places!


To prime with this stuff, just wipe the top of the jar with some
sterilant, open the jar, and pour!


That's about it, it really can't be much easier.  I realize that
pressure canning is a bit overboard, from what I understand you really
don't need to cook at 15 lbs for 15 minutes to kill the things that
might get into your beer (they die much easier).  BUT I don't think this
a real hassle and I relax better knowing that there ain't nothing going
to live in there.

     Date: 08-Nov-91      Time: 10:07 AM       Msg: EXT02204


          Hi folks,
          here are the recipes for food made with beer that I promised about 2
          weeks ago. Sorry it took so long, I had to take a trip to Kansas City.
          This was in a Gannett Westchester Co. NY newspaper. By the way, I had
          Boulevard Beer (a pale ale I think) in KC. It was nice with lots of
          hops (at least I think so; my palate is not yet truly educated.)




             A cold beer in a frosty mug is the perfect drink for a hot summer's
          day. But beer does not only have to be a quick thirst-quencher, it can
          (and should) be savored for its aroma, and because of its aroma, it
          can also successfully be used in cooking. Beer dishes such as the
          meatball and the vegetable recipe that follows taste particularly good
          in chillier weather. A warming bowl of spinach and beer soup with
          Cheddar cheese and a bit of sausage, accompanied by a thick slice of
          fresh whole grain bread, makes a meal. If you have the time, you could
          serve the garlic/zucchini fritters with the soup. They make excellent
          hors d'oeuvres or snacks as well. It is one of my prize recipes. Serve
          them freshly made when they are hot and crispy.
            Just as in cooking with wine: the better the beer, the better the
          dish. I have indicated some of the brands appropriate for a particular
          recipe. Each brand will impart its own unique flavor. Try some of the
          beers from the micro-breweries now springing up all over the country.


          Mother's meatballs with beer


          Preparation time: about 10 minutes
          Cooking time: about 20 minutes


          1 thick slice bread, crusts removed
          2 tablespoons milk or water
          1 pound lean ground beef, or meatloaf mixture of beef/veal/pork
          1 egg
          2 tablespoons minced onion
          1 teaspoon salt, or less
          Freshly ground black pepper
          1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
          Butter or margarine for frying
          2 cups Heineken or similar beer, at room temperature


             Soak the bread in the milk or water and squeeze dry. Stir or knead
          into the meat together with the egg,onion and spices. Form into four
          balls. Heat the butter or margarine, and brown the meatballs on all
          sides. Pour in 1 cup of the beer. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat
          and cover the pan. Simmer for about 15 minutes. Check to see that it
          does not cook dry and add more beer when needed. Serve as is, or
          thicken the sauce with cornstarch, if desired.


          Cabbage saute with beer


          Preparation time: about 10 minutes
          Cooking time: 10 minutes


          3 tablespoons butter, margarine or oil
          4 cups shredded or finely cut green cabbage
          3 large carrots, peeled and coarsely grated
          1 tablespoon flour
          Salt and sugar to taste
          4 ounces Bass ale or similar beer


             Heat the butter, margarine, or oil and saute the cabbage and
          carrots for ffve minutes in the butter, stirring frequently. Sprinkle
          with flour, salt and a little sugar. Mix and stir in the beer. Cover
          and cook for 5 minutes over low heat.


          Peter's beer soup with spinach, cheese and sausage


          Preparation time: about 15-2 minutes


          Cooking time: 15 minutes


          1/2 pound breakfast sausage, not Italian sausage
          1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil
          1 pound fresh spinach, washed and coarsely chopped
          4 scallions, finely chopped
          l/4 cup flour
          2 cups skim milk
          1 cup or more full-bodied beer, such as Heineken, Grolsch, Molson
          8 ounces of grated Cheddar cheese
          Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste


             Cut the sausage into small slices or pieces and brown in a pan,
          large enough to hold the soup. Drain and set sausage aside. Heat the
          oil. Add the scallions and cook for 3 minutes, then add the chopped
          spinach. Cook and stir until the spinach is wilted. Add the sausage.
          Sprinkle the mixture with the flour. Slowly add--while stirring--the
          skim milk. If you need to hold the soup, prepare it up to this point.
          When ready to serve add the beer. Bring to a boil. Add the cheese.
          Cook until melted. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve
          immediately.


          Garlie zucchini fritters made with a beer batter


          Preparation time: 5 minutes, standing time about 20-30 minutes


          Cooking time: 3-5 minutes


          1 cup self-rising flour
          6-7 ounces of beer such as Budweiser
          2 or 3 small zucchini, approximately 3/4 cup when cut as directed
          1 large, or 2 smaller, cloves of garlic, minced
          2 heaping tablespoons minced fresh chives OR finely minced scallions
          with green parts
          1/4 teaspoon salt
          Freshly ground pepper
          Vegetable oil for frying


             Cut the zucchini into 6 strips lengthwise and cut them across into
          thin slivers. Combine the flour and beer into a smooth thick paste.
          Add the zucchini, chives or scallions, garlic, salt, lots of freshly
          ground pepper and combine. It will seem barely enough to cover the
          zucchini pieces. Let it stand to rise for about 20-30 minutes. After
          it stands, if the batter is too thick add a little more beer, if too
          thin add a little more flour. Heat some oil in a saucepan or deep
          fryer (or better yet a wok) to about 340 F. Scoop out a tablespoon of
          batter and push it off the spoon with the aid of another spoon and let
          it carefully drop into the hot oil. Turn to fry golden on both sides.
          Remove and drain on paper towels. Continue until all batter is used.
          Keep them hot in an oven set at 300 F. if necessary. They can also
          briefly be reheated in the microwave. They are best served
          immediately.

Jack, I promise you that anyone you haven't alienated by your repeated
plugging of your products has now been alienated by this.  Your ignorance
of many elements of the brewing process has already made itself evident in
your postings, yet now you claim that your video is more interesting than that
put together by Charlie Papazian?


I've never met either of you, but I've read both your work.  From his
editorials in Zymurgy to his book to second-hand accounts of his antics,
it's obvious that Papazian is one heck of an interesting person.  I suppose
"interesting" applies to your writing as well, though I'd be more inclined 
to use "bizarre."


I have just one question.  In your video, do you include a plug for the
AHA?

 How's that for a descriptive subject line?


 Someone mentioned having an Orval dated 1990/2, and it was skunky.  I've

not skunky.  They did have that tremendous thick foamy head, though.


 Re. cloves: I pick up clove flavor in *all* German beer. The one beer I made 
with Wyeast German Ale (#1007?) had that same clove taste.  I can't drink
real wheat beer because of the cloves. Anyone else as sensitive to it as me?


 To the gloater: Goudenband?  Had one last night.  Fuller's ESB?  Got 3 of 'em
left in my cellar.  SS Stout?  Had a SS Imperial Stout a couple of days ago.
And there's still more in my collection from Yankee Spirits, but it's almost 
time to go back.....


 Re. hangovers: I've also heard that restoring potassium helps cure a hangover.
Bananas seem to help, as does tomato juice (hair-of-dog vodka is optional).

        Though I am reluctant to continue what is essentially a very boring
thread, I do not use plugged pipettes.  They are just open, sterile, glass
pipettes.

        It is true that I havent done cell culture work in some time, but
I don't think the result would be any different.  Cell culture work is tough
because the generation times of the cells are so long that fast growing
organisms can easily take over the culture; I don't think it has much to
do with the culture media.  The media we use in the lab is a good deal 
richer than liquid malt.  It's yeast extract, peptone, and glucose as a 
carbon source.  Granted I have not performed the experiment with fetal calf
serum or some other cell culture medium, but I doubt I would get a different
result.


        Anyway, we both agree (I think) on the important aspect of this issue:
That in wort the technique is safe.  Whether that's because breath is sterile
or because what critters it contains are present in very low titer or can't
grow in wort isn't really the issue.


        I'm also happy to note that the 'm' word is taking it's knocks out
there.  But I am also concerned that "your mileage may vary" is rapidly
taking it's place as annoying phraseology of the moment....

Subject: Honey Priming, Rats


To Mike McNally:


You wrote that you don't see the point in priming with honey, because the
small amount will make no taste difference.  I agree; this is the same
principle that says people can prime with corn sugar, even though they
wouldn't normally use it in their brew.  The reason I primed my last batch
with honey is this:  I had cleaned and sterilized all of my bottles before I
realized I had no corn sugar, no dry malt, nothing.  It was table sugar or
honey or wait until I could get to the HB store.  The honey, to my tongue,
had no taste effect; it just gave me carbonation, as I desired.


To Curt Freeman:


Touche...  Now, does anyone have any real information on blowoff?  Maybe
Zymurgy or one of the oft-quoted HB Bibles gives something more than "...it's
really a personal preference...".  I used a blowoff tube for my first few
batches.  Then I got a 7 gal. carboy and commenced to just putting the f-lock
on top at the start of fermentation.  With 5 gal. batches, so far, there's
never been enough krausen to reach the f-lock, and I can't taste a difference
(rats *ss or otherwise).  BTW, I'm not a big stout man (I'm sort of medium
sized :0), but your recipe is intriguing...

I now do all-grain, but did a *real* simple weizen a month back which got
raves from a friend who lived in Munich for 3 years, from my homebrew
club, and was quite favorably received by one who is a certified judge.


I'll try to reproduce the recipe from memory as best I can.  First, I
consulted Eckard (not him, his book -- *great* resource) to see what
hopping levels are appropriate for Bavarian style Weizens -- they are
pretty low -- and then cranked IBU's to ounces for Hallertauer and
Tettnanger at three boil times.  I can't remember them, so you'll have to
do this yourself, or write me direct and I'll scrounge up the actual
amounts I used.


Weizen-1 (for 11 gallons)


13.2#        American Classic wheat beer extract syrup (60% wheat, 40% barley)
?? oz        Hallertauer leaf (~ 5% alpha) 60 minutes
?? oz        Tettnanger leaf (~ 5% alpha) 30 minutes
?? oz        Hallertauer leaf (~ 5% alpha) 15 minutes
750 ml        Wyeast wheat beer culture
12 gal        Water


Boil the whole batch for 60 minutes, adding hops as specified.
Force cool.
Save 1 gallon for priming in fridge.
Split yeast between two carboys, then siphon beer in.
It fermented about 10 days at 60-70F
Primed with 1/2 gallon of the saved wort in each of 2 kegs, siphoned the
beer in and let sit for 3 weeks at ~60F. 


Sorry, I didn't take OG or FG readings.


Not as good as the beer from Schneiderweisskeller (Munich), but it had
the right clove aroma, a very slight tartness, and good body. Perhaps a bit
dark for style, but that's hard to avoid using extract.


I kegged a clone of it last night which had 50% more malt and hops; I used
Father Barleywine's yeast cake trick. Ummmm... getting thirsty thinking
about it.

Subject: Potassium used as water hardener?




 A friend recently gave me a 500-tablet bottle of potassium supplements. I
was wondering if I could use this stuff as a water hardener, considering the
price was right...8*)


 The contents of the tablets are:


 Potassium: 99 mg.




 There are mentions of other goodies, like stearic acid, magnesium stearate
and silica, but heaven only knows what THAT stuff's in there for, as the
potassium is in the form of potassium gluconate.


                                                Opinions?
