Subject: Glass Fermenters


After my strong recommendations regarding the use of glass 
fermenters I would like to relate an interesting story about one of 
the brewers in our club. Seems this brewer kept bringing 
obviously infected beers to our meetings and asking "what I am 
doing wrong?". We would all ask the usual questions, The 
fermenter was always high on the list of potential sources for 
contamination. He was using a glass carboy. After months of this 
quizzing I suggested maybe he should take up sewing :-- /  Well 
one day he walks in with the solution to the mystery. While he was 
cleaning his carboy he couldn't remove a particular stain. After 
getting his glasses (brewers over forty will relate to this) he 
discovered the stain was not really a stain but a bubble on the 
inside of the carboy. There was this green blob living very happily 
in that bubble. He bought a new carboy and yep his infection 
problems went away. He now brews award winning beers 
consistently. So, check those new and used carboy closely! 
Stainless definitely has an advantage in this respect. I'll relate 
another story about plastic fermenters at another time.

After boiling and cooling, you WANT to aerate the wort thoroughly. It's the
only time you really want to introduce lots of oxygen into the wort, so the
yeast can utilize it during the respiration phase. Low oxygen levels tend
to cause slower starts, longer fermentations, and a higher probability of
stuck fermentations. (If your parenthetical note was a bit of humor, please
ignore my response... I've been out of touch for a couple of weeks, and
can't tell who's for real around here anymore)

      Since my brewing partner is off staggering from brewpub to
      brewpub in Washington, I thought that I'd pick up the slack
      here...

In fact, we did use the seed and not the leaf, and the flavour bears
      no resemblance to the mexican/chinese flavour.  I must admit, I
      am intrigued now and would like to brew a lager with the leaf in
      the boil.  The coriander beer is wonderful, though, even with
      the much maligned Red Star yeast.

              MORE ON THE OXIDATION MOMILY
 
 This evening I had the opportunity to check my taste buds against some 
 experts at a meeting of the Chicago Beer Society.  Before I present their 
 opinion of my oxidation experiment, a little background.....
 
 As a debunker of MOMILIES, I decided to conduct my own experiment regarding 
 assertion that the billowing foam in my video "BREW IT AT HOME", would cause 
 oxidation leading to "cidery" or "cardboardy" tastes.
 
 The experiment goes like this:
 
 I brewed a batch of extract beer following all the does and don'ts derived 
 from the discussion on oxidation.  No splashing, foam and minimum head space.  
 I even tilted the bottles until the filler head was covered to preclude 
 turbulence at that point.
 
 I left about a quart of beer in the priming vessel and did just the opposite 
 to this.  I abused it in every way I could think of.  I sloshed it around for 
 several minutes.  I poured it into a quart bottle through a funnel and then 
 decanted it back and forth into another bottle about a dozen times.  I then 
 poured this into three 12 oz bottles, with a funnel, leaving about 3 inches 
 of head space.
 
 The bottles were numbered T1, T2 and T3.  They are to be opened and tasted at 
 30 day intervals and compared with the control samples.
 
 We tasted T1 today {10/14} and neither my wife nor I could detect the 
 slightest difference.
 
 ..........
 
 Tonite 11/7,  I poured samples for three certified judges and several 
 lurkers, of a control bottle and T2.  They had no idea what was done to T2, 
 only that it was the same batch and given special treatment.  No clue as to 
 good or bad treatment.
 
 The concensus of the judges was that T2 is "cleaner and smoother" than the 
 control.
 
 I rest my case on that one.
 ...............
 
 It was a fun time and we met a lot of fine people and sampled a lot of beer.  
 Marilyn liked everyone she tasted better than the last one.  I naturally 
 liked mine best.  In spite of this, I let her drive home.
 
 What really made the evening was meeting at least three readers of HBD and 
 usenet.  It reconfirmed my faith in the fact that in spite of all the big 
 mouths (me included) there are a lot of neat people out there who just yawn 
 and enjoy it.
 
 I left a copy of "BREW IT AT HOME" with one of the judges to look at and post 
 a review.
 
 So hopefully, we can hear some comments on a video that someone has actually 
 viewed.

Subject:  red tail?


gang,


i was recently in california on business/fun.  when my friend heard i was
going, she begged me to bring back a six pack of red tail ale, 
(it is unavailable anywhere here on the east coast, and california is
a little far to go for beer, even great beer) saying that it was 
incredible, the best beer she's ever tasted, etc.  now while i was there 
buying this beer, the thought occured to me to grap a six for myself (of
course not realizing just how heavy this stuff is along with two bottles
of wine to carry through an airport).  now my question is, is this stuff
really that good?  should i wait until i am not rushed so as to savor
each bottle, or just grab em and chug on my way out to the local bar?
what do i have to look forward to?  and is the light in my refrigerator 
going to turn it to skunk juice if i keep it in there too long?

Flame on!!


OK. I've had it!


Both behind the scenes and on the scene, there have been plenty of 
complaints about how the signal to noise ratio has been increasing on 
the HBD these days.  The cause?  (I hate to even say it..)  Big Jack's 
refusal to respect the norms concerning commercial advertising on the 
Internet. 


As a business person who loves the HBD and wants to see it return to 
the HBD of old, allow me to make a few points.  And then, frankly, I'm 
ready for this crap to come to an end.  Direct all flames/comments to 
me personally.  Let's not waste this bandwidth any more.  I'm sorry 
about this post but "I'm mad as hell and can't take it anymore."


Jack, I know you think you're cute and quick and witty the way you 
keep sliding in comments about your maybe-good-maybe-bad video.  But 
you're stretching the bounds of decency now, Pal, and I'm asking you 
wake up and smell the coffee.  Wrap that doubled-barrelled immersion/
counterflow chiller you "invented" around your neck and chill out! 
Your surreptitious references to your enterprise is out of place and 
in bad taste.  You're only fooling yourself.  We know all about your 
cursed video by now.  My God, man, you won't let us forget about it! 


I appreciate the fact that after making a dozen batches of beer, you 
feel the need to enlighten the world about how easy homebrewing beer 
is.  Great!  Fine!  Why you think a dozen batches of beer qualifies 
you as saviour of the world is beyond me.  But from the tone of your 
posts, lack of ego is a disease from which you do not suffer.  You've 
made your freaking video now.  You've pummeled us over the head about 
it.  We all have enough information before us, behind us, and on top 
of us to make up our minds about it.  Or do you think because the 
money isn't pouring in from all us netters that we're all just too 
stupid to know a good thing when we hear about it?  Or maybe the 
comment you made about how some of us are "silly people" reflect your 
deep down opinion of us. 


Speaking as a business person, now let me bust a few of your bubbles.  
Welcome to the homebrewing business world.  This is the world where if 
you're in it to make money, you're suffering from oxidation of the 
brain!  If all you have is one video to sell you'll be belly up in a 
year if not before.  If you're going to sell anything at all, you have 
to advertise in a COMMERCIAL forum.  I suggest Zymurgy.  4 ads a year 
will set you back about $1000.  That's a lot of VHS tape, Jack!  And 
your product is competing against products produced by people who have 
been brewing beer for over 15 years.  Gee! I wonder whose opinion I'd 
be better off following? 


I'm begging, I'm pleading, I'm on my knees to you to cease and 
desist.  We've had a good thing going here in the Digest for as long 
as I've been a subscriber.  I've learned more here about making beer 
than anywhere.  I participate as a homebrewer.  I go out of my way NOT 
to mention my products and my business.  (Can you name my business?  
I doubt it.)  A question was asked about one of my products a couple 
of weeks ago.  Did you see me answer it in these electronic pages?  
No.  I handled it the way I always handle them.  Quietly.  Behind the 
scenes.  And since you don't seem to be able to take a hint, let me 
tell you outright.  THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HANDLED!!  The crass, 
Madison 5th Avenue type commercialism you've seen fit to bombard us 
with makes me want to puke.  And in the process, you've caused the 
quality of the Digest to go downhill.  


Having said all this, let me point out that we really are more than 
happy to have you in the Digest.  Don't get me wrong.  The purpose here 
is to discuss homebrewing related issues.  If in the natural course of 
discussion, someone wants to talk about the relative merits of all the 
videos available, fine, then jump in and TRY to make objective 
comments about the products under discussion.  But you're totally out 
of line to initiate the discussion yourself.  And you're simply out of 
touch to refuse to let it run its course.


So from one Digest subscriber/businessperson to another,  get a grip. 
You've already achieved pariah-level notoriety.  You're not doing 
yourself, your business, nor the Digest any good.


Flame off!


Sorry to take up bandwidth, you guys.  But like a bad case of jock-
itch, I've been hoping that Schmidlyitis would die the death it 
deserved.  Consider this a bottle of castor oil down the throat of the 
demon.


Now back to our regular scheduled programming.


Regretfully,

Hi John:


I'll bet you knew I'd bite on this one.  John and I have discussed 
some of this before in Fidonet's Zymurgy forum.   Below is an edited 
version of some of those discussions. 


But before I begin:


>Because blowing off or skimming foam doesn't make a rat's *ss bit of 
>difference, IMHO.  (that ought to start a nice little flame war...) 
>Cheers! 
>Norm 


Sure.  Now that flaming is my business, here I go...  :-)


- -------


I admit the blow-off method is a much disputed technique.  My opinion 
comes from my own personal experience.  I definitely think my beers 
have improved from this system.  The point I usually make along these 
lines is to taste the brown scum that forms on the kraeusen head.  
Since never in my wildest dreams would I intentionally add anything so 
bitter to my beer on purpose, I've found comfort in letting the blow-
off method remove it for me.


John has made the point to me before that fermentation is a chemical,
not just a mechanical process and that perhaps some of those bitter 
consituents get processed in the course of fermentation.  That's a 
good point and I am in no position to say one way or the other. 


Still, looking at the literature, I find that skimming is at least 
advised in most of the brewing textbooks.  A look at my copy of 
_Malting and Brewing Science_, Page 652: (Discussion on the progress 
of primary fermentation...)  The head gradually collapses, leaving a 
dark-coloured, bitter-tasting scum  which should be separated from the 
beer by skimming or suction.  Some breweries arrange for this scum to 
stick to the roof of the fermenter and then be removed by special 
chutes at the side of the vessel.  Another suggestion is that plastic 
balls floating in the fermenter will retain the scum while the 
fermenter is drained.  (Interesting suggestion, huh?)" 


_The Practical Brewer_ also says that the beer should be skimmed, 
though more to collect the yeast than to remove bitter substances:
"As the fermentation proceeds, a head forms.... The yeast flocculates, 
rises to the top and is pre-skimmed during the next 24 hours leaving a 
layer of around 3-5 cm thickness behind.  One method of skimming or 
yeast collection is the use of a built-in funnel arrangement at the 
liquid level into which the yeast flows and is then transported 
through pipes to the yeast room.  Another method is the use of a 
mechanically operated board travelling over the liquid level pushing 
the yeast towards a collection point.  (I have seen systems like this 
in a couple of the breweries I've toured in Belgium.-krb)  Such systems 
often make use of vacuum pumps to collect the yeast."


I guess I'd argue at this point that even if they skim to collect the 
yeast, they're taking the bitter scum along with it as they do. 


An important point here is to do those things that you deem important 
to improving your beer, given your own personal experiences.  My early 
homebrews (pre-blow-off) suffered from a bitter astringency that I 
found objectionable.  The first beer I tried using the blow-off method 
didn't have it and I've never gone back. 


I do have a tendency to get on my soap-box about the blow-off method, 
though, so my apologies to all.  But I was falsely accused of blowing 
carboys a couple of years ago by none other than Zymurgy, the same 
guys who said it's OK to blow-off using siphon hose.  In my Less Than 
Humble Opinion,  that one section in _The Complete Joy of Homebrewing_
(an otherwise excellent book, I should add) has done more to cloud 
this issue than anything else.  But such is life... 


To wit,


>From Ken Johnson:


>Subject: Yeast poppers (the flying carboy cap)

This is why Michael Lewis, of UC Davis, who first came up with the 
idea of the blow-off for homebrewers, advised stuffing 1" ID hose into 
the neck of a carboy.  Nothing will clog those suckers.  I'm extremely 
surprised that Charlie, knowing full well that his advice has caused 
hundreds of homebrewers to suffer the popped cork syndrome, refuses to 
amend that portion of his book. 


So spread the word.  Don't blow-off through siphon hose.  Regardless 
of what the "The Book" says.

My understanding is that micro-beasties dont *grow* in honey but 
they do *survive*, just waiting for the day when someone dilutes 
it with water and makes life liveable again. 


The very simplest way to make a mead is to mix a bunch o' honey 
and water together and let it go, no cooking, no quality control, 
no guarantees. The wild yeasts in the honey will do the job. 
I don't recommend it.

for the posting "The past week". It was an idea that had crossed my mind but
I simply didn't have the guts. Someone else recently mentioned that the mood
of HD had changed recently and has been less-than-friendly at times. I agree.


It really doesn't matter how it all got started. Everyone involved is guilty
of fanning the flames. I enjoy reading HD. It can be informative and fun.
Unfortunately the recent rash of direct insults, insinuating subject headers,
string pulling and general impoliteness has left me considering cancelling my
subscription. It's probably best to send hostile letters directly to the person
one wishes to make miserable. The sense of personal vindication should be the
same and it'll clean up HD a little. Anyways, I doubt that many readers are
impressed or amused at how cunning and sarcastic other people can be. I only
speak from my own little soapbox but it is quite possible that I'd get solid
backing on this issue if I'd call for it.


I've taken the time to go through a few back issues and it's clear that EVERY
subscriber responds well to an alternate viewpoint provided it is stated
diplomatically. Let's all chill out, chill a few beers and slip in a smiley

The homebrew world has actually heard of that one before, using an ice-water
slurry or cold running water as you mentioned. It works much like a counterflow
system but isn't as efficient as counterflow in achieving a rapid local drop in
temperature. Counterflow is the way to go if one is concerned about efficiency.
I know many brewers would attest that the method described by Jack or the
immersion chiller method are both easier to setup. I chose counterflow after
seeing a 'make-it-yourself' article in Zymurgy (I don't have the reference with
me) and I have had no headaches or problems with it. In the final analysis they
all work well and the important point is that chilling your wort by any method
available will help you make better beer. Go with the flow %-}

Hmmmmm .... we could be slowly developing the ultimate drinkers diet here on
HD. Time released B-vitamins, honey, Gatorade, bananas and water, water, water.
The problem is we're not leaving enough room for the beer! ;-)


Actually, I have heard that dehydration does lead to ion channel abnormalities

I'll check into it with a friend of mine who should know the answer. BTW, it's

It is true that bacteria and molds will not GROW in honey, since
the cells are unable to absorb any moisture.  However, they do
not automatically die.  They just lay dormant and wake up with
a killer case of cotton mouth, and set off to drink your beer.

Just for the record, Baderbrau gives me a headache.  So does Samuel Adams,
for that matter.  Miller Lite (my unobtrusive, "what, you don't carry Sierra
Nevada?!?," lawnmower, wedding, bowling beer), does not.  Nor do any of the
Sierra Nevada, Sam Smith's, or Belgian brewery products.  Two Budweisers in
one night and the next morning I have a "looking for a gun to shoot myself"
headache!  One of these days I'll do the experiment right, including
duplicating meals the days of the drinking, and then having the beers
analyzed, to see what component the headache beers have in common.


I'd like to point out that in his last two posts, Jack seems to have taken

To Jeanne Sova:
I was deeply moved by your post in HBD#758. I feel, however, there is
another interpretation of "affaire de Schmidling". Imagine yourself in
a room with a bunch of people just learning to drive. Imagine someone
speaking to this group about the advantages of driving down one way streets
the wrong way at a high rate of speed. I suspect you might have 
something to say. Your comments might even become a bit pointed if
the speaker defensively insists that he has been using this procedure
all his life without harm.


I cannot tell you the number of times beginning home brewers have told
me at meetings about how much help people like Al,Jay,Jeff,Larry,
Mike,etc. have given them. All of these people have played a very
constructive role as mentors in the best sense of that term. There is a
home brewing community, and while it is quite diverse , a "tough crowd"
it is not. Be assured that the comradery among those men and women who
love and brew beer is as strong as ever. I sincerely hope that this 
aspect is visible to you.

Jack, as far as "you" are concerned your beer has never tasted like cider or
cardboard.  These are flavors (along with many others found in beer) which
different people have different sensitivities to.  This is why I suggest you
have an independent palate, preferably one that has experience with homebrew,
taste your experimental brew against your control batch.  Many people like some
of the flavors/aromas which occur as "flaws" in brewing.  This is especially
true of fruity esters which show up in many ales.


As far as cardboard is concerned, it isn't so much the taste as the aroma which
exibits a character which comes closest to that of "wet cardboard".  This is
not to say that it "is" the smell of wet cardboard, but that, when many people
perceive it in beer, it "reminds" them of the smell of wet cardboard.  It is a
device to describe an off aroma in the brew, as are many other terms which
brewers use to verbalize what their senses tell them about beer.


If you are happy with your beer as it is, then keep on brewing as you are. 
However your position that things like oxidation and off flavors/aromas don't
exist or occur, simply because you have not experienced them, is poor science. 
 Perhaps your environment allows you to brew with a casual attitude towards
certain accepted practices and still succeed.  I have no idea since I don't
know you or your beer.  When you begin to get feedback from other brewers you
may get confirmation of your abilities, or you may find that there are some
things in your beer which you are not aware of.  Enter a competition where your
beer will be judged anonymously and then review the judges' comments with an
open mind.  Get a second opinion, Jack.

  I am very disturbed by the many  references to making ALES 
 with BOTTOM fermenting yeasts and vice versa. Anyone out there 
 know your definitions of beer style? While it is possible to cold
 ferment with a top fermenting(ale) yeast, the resulting beverage is
 not a lager beer(maybe an alt though). The reference to a dark brown
 beer that was bottom fermented as an "obvious ale" is way off base.
 The color of a beer is the result of the grains used to make it, not
 the yeasts.
  Want to redefine your ale-lager values? Buy a bottle of EKU28
 (Germany) and a bottle of DUVEL(Belgium). Try these beers side by 
 side. The EKU28 is very dark, thick and malty, it is also a lager
 beer. The DUVEL is so pale that it is almost clear, and it is an 
 ale.
  Before making any more beer ignorant statements try reading some
 descriptive beer styles books, they are widely available.

Subject:  Draught Guinness in a can!?!          Time:11:22 AM    Date:10/30/91
THIS IS NOT A COMMERCIAL ENDORSEMENT


I had the good fortune to be invited to attend a very special beer happening
(am I dating myself with that term?) recently by Tom Dahldorf of the California
Celebrator.  The event was Guinness' unveiling of their new product, Pub
Draught Guinness.  Now, I can hear the lot of you saying to yourselves "Yeah,
yeah, another 'draft beer in a can', big deal".  But this one is different. 
For the most part this product actually does what it is supposed to do!


Anyone who has had Guinness Stout on draught and from a bottle knows there is a
vast difference between the two brews.  The brewery makes no secret of the fact
that the recipes are different not only between the kegged version and the
bottled, but also between different bottled markets.  Now the folks at Guinness
have developed a system which dispenses their stout from a can in such a way as
to rival a pub tap.  They have been working on this for some 20 years and the
final method was preceded by over 100 failed attempts.


The problem has always been the fact that draught Guinness is (or should be)
dispensed with a mixture of Nitrogen and CO2 gasses rather than the
conventional CO2 alone.  The nitrogen is used because it makes very fine
bubbles while it is not absorbed into the brew as the CO2 is, thus it does not
"over-carbonate" the beer.  Also a special faucet is preferred which, in
combination with the gasses, creates that wonderful creamy brown head which
lasts to the bottom of the glass.  The new can combines the original kegged
stout recipe with technology which creates the draught effect to a tee.


Dr. Alan Forage, creator of the technology, was on hand to explain the
mechanics of the new can.  This is the way the system works:  The 16.9 ounce
can (containing 14.9 ounces of beer) is fitted with a small plastic device
(Guinness calls it a "smoothifier") which sits in the bottom of the can.  This
device has a pocket or cavity which is open to the atmosphere via a pin hole in
its top.  The can is evacuated of oxygen and filled with beer.  Prior to
sealing the can, a dose of liquid nitrogen is added to the beer.  The can is
closed and as the liquid nitrogen warms a pressure is created.  The pressure
forces about 1% of the beer and nitrogen into the plastic cavity.   When the
can is opened, the pressure is released and the small amount of beer in the
cavity is forced back through the pinhole quite violently.  The agitation
created by this "geyser" mixes the nitrogen with the beer in such a way as to
reproduce the tap handle character.  Open up the first empty can you have in
order to see what the "smoothifier" looks like.


Prior to serving, the beer must be chilled.  Guinness suggests a two hour stint
in a refrigerator, with a target serving temperature of 45-50 degrees (if
opened while warm, the beer gushes with excess force).  This is the one area
where flavor will be variable since most American refrigerators hold their
temperatures closer to 35-40 degrees.  We all know the colder the beer the less
the flavors are perceptible.  Education will be the key here.  The entire
contents should be emptied into a 16 ounce glass.  The head which forms is
exactly like that of the draught version.  And yes, it does last to the bottom
of the glass.


How does it taste?  In my opinion, this is virtually the same as what you get
at a well maintained pub.  The texture is right on.  The flavor is wonderful. 
I suspect there may be some slight differences as a result of the volume of the
package (14.9 ounces vs. 15.5 gallons) but I didn't notice any.  According to
Declan Maguire, group marketing director of Guinness Import Company here in the
U.S., extensive taste comparisons were made throughout Ireland and England
during the development of the product.  This includes side-by-side blind
tastings with the original version.


The cans come in packages of 4.  The suggested price is $5.99.  The stout is 4%
alcohol by volume.  Guinness is releasing the new product in the San Francisco,
Chicago, and Baltimore/Washington D.C. areas to begin with.  Locally, Safeway
stores are carrying it at $3.00/2 cans.  The cans can be recycled just like
other aluminum ones.  I suspect the insert is made from the same plastic which
is used to coat the inside of the can and will burn off during the recycling
process.


Congratulations to Guinness on the success of this new package.

I made this same mistake once myself and was corrected by several
kind souls on the Digest.  My mistake was to state that, since the
beer was yet to be fermented, aerating hot wort was OK.  Several
posters corrected me by saying that, since the wort was hot, the
oxidation reactions took place much faster and that the wort should
be cooled to below 80F before aerating.  When I began doing this
(mind you this was more than 3 years ago), I finally brewed my first
light-colored beer.  All my previous beers were very brown even
though I used the same ingredients!  My palate was not as developed
as it is now, but I faintly recall a sherry-like flavor in all those
early beers.  I guess I just thought it belonged in my beer and didn't
question it.


I don't know if it's true that the yeast "reduces the oxidized
components."  I had never heard this, but would agree with you
that oxidation after fermentation is much more serious than
oxidation before fermentation.  I would be interested to know
if that reduction really does take place.

Good point!  I hadn't thought of that.  All in all, it's 6 of 1,

Yes it's possible.  It depends, remember, on your tapwater temperature.
Mine is 50' of 3/8" OD (I believe) and I get down to 75F in 20 min.

 You seem to have answered your own question.  I brew in the basement with an 
 annual temperature range of 50 to 80 degrees.  This obviously affects the 
 vigor of the fermentation and the level to which one can fill the carboy to 
 control wort loss.

 Thanks for the comments.  However, one of the things I find most confusing in 
 this discussion about yeast is use of the term "strain".  In any science that 
 I am aware of (we are talking botany with yeast), the word strain is used to 
 identify a predictable and known variation of a species.
 
 For example, bread yeast and ale yeast are variations (different strains) of 
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single species.
 
 You have identified two different species.   It's like the difference between 
 a rose bush and an apple tree (same genus, different species) as compared to 
 a red rose and a pink one (same species, different strains).
 
 This may seem like trivia but I suggest that it is far more relevant to 
 understanding beer characteristics than whether one says "blow-out" or "blow 
 off".  In one case, it offends science; in the other, just shop talk.

Does anyone out there have any good recipes for ginger beer or other non
alcoholic drinks?  It's mainly ginger beer recipes I'm after though...once
made a really great batch but lost the recipe :(


Happy brewing..
