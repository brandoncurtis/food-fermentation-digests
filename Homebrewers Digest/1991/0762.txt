Hi, before I too join the Jack/Commercialism thread, I thought it would
be good to actually post a few things about homebrewing so...


I need some help.  I need a bio-tech. type person in eastern MA/southern NH
to run some tests for me.  More specifically, I'd like someone to determine
the 'purity' of a number of cultures I have.  These are not common everyday
cultures, and cannot be easily replaced.  In fact, they're not even
Saccaromyces cultures.  To the best of my knowledge they are fairly
uncontaminated, but I would like that verified.  Further, if I'm wrong,
I'll need some isolation work done.  Finally, I'd like to have a few 
master tubes placed in an ultra-low temp freezer.  I am willing to
pay/barter for these services -- the reason I'm asking here is that
a fellow HBDer might not rake me over the coals as much.  Anyone
interested should send me e-mail for details.


(how about that, HBDs first Help-Wanted)


and something to add to the general discussion:


How does one place a false bottom inside a 15gal keg?  I've been
trying to figure this one out for a while.  I've come up with a
number of good techniques, but all of them involve welding inside
the keg.  I know that someone at the last AHA conference gave a
talk on building a 15gal keg-brewery, but I can't remember upon
what the false bottom reseted.  Does it fit snugly into that
lower reenforcing band with some feet for hold up the middle?  Does
it sit on the bottom weld in the very bottom of the keg?


and finally,

Yes, I've dealt with Kinney before, although he might not remember it.
I've had nothing but good experiences in dealing with him.


Anyway, on to my main point, are you trying to tell me that you missed
that *entire*line* of smilies in my original message?  Were you reading
the original through a sarcasim filter?  Actually, I agree with you about
98%.  Generally commercialism on HBD should be avoided, but I do believe
it should be ok to use it as a forum for selling surplus or old
equipment and the like NOT as a replacement for Zymurgy ads.  A while
back it was suggested that such announcements be limited to
something in the neighborhood of 5 lines.  I like that idea.

Draught Guinnes in a can is not all that new.  They were coming out with it
a few years ago while I was still living in England (they used the theme
from Hawaii 5-0 to promote it.  That was a kick).  


Every time I go back, my ex-girlfriend's dad stocks the fridge with them.  I
just have to drink it out of courtesy, and he just feels obligated to 
finish off what I can't :-}.  


But seriously, it tastes pretty good and is worth a couple bucks to try
just once. Now that it's coming to the U.S., I'm hoping to do the same.

Subject:      Chillers redux




Some comments and a question or two on chillers.


I have been very interested in the relative merits of immersion
and counter-flow chillers, and thought it might be useful to
summarize some of that information as background to a few questions.


Speed of chilling:  It sounds like either type can chill a five
gallon batch in 15 to 20 minutes, the important distinction being
that with an immersion chiller this is a parallel process (each
little bit of wort takes the same time to cool) whereas the
counterflow chiller is a serial process (each little bit of wort
cools in a matter of seconds, but they have to wait their turn).
Also, with a counterflow chiller, the wort is protected from
oxidation and contamination during the entire time it is being
chilled (assuming the chiller is properly sanitized).
Here I would definitely give the advantage to counterflow.


Cold break:  If I understand correctly, this is a function of how
fast the drop in temperature happens. Advantage counterflow.


Ease of sanitizing:  The immersion cooler can be put in the boiler
for the last part of the boil.  The counter-flow must be either
pre-sanitized, or you can run some of the boil through before
turning on the chilled water (I don't think I'd trust this, myself).
Some folks have indicated a certain nervousness about how you make
sure that the inside of a copper pipe is really clean - it's really
hard to see in there! Advantage here goes to the immersion chiller.


Cost:  Depends a lot on your construction techniques and skill at
scrouging.  A counterflow chiller is more work to put together, and
involves more fittings, but it uses less copper tubing.  Immersion
chillers are both more available and cheaper from commercial sources.
Probable advantage: immersion.


Efficiency of water use:  Dead heat.  Both can recirculate water
if you live in a place where that's a problem.


Separation of wort from trub/cold break:  Here is where I have a
question or two.  The immersion chiller has no problem here - you
can whirlpool the cooled wort and then siphon off carefully, leaving
most of the trub and cold break behind.  With the counterflow
chiller, the trub can be left behind, but the cold break would seem
to end up in the primary.  So how do you counter-flowers out there
deal with the (very good) cold break?  Do you just ferment on top
of it, or do you use an intermediate vessel where you can whirlpool
and aerate and then rack to your primary?

First let me begin with with a few replies to recent posts.

Wow!  Who is this Marilyn and what does it take to get her to one of
our tastings!  This truly was a Bacchanalia in every sense of the word,
huh?  (Yes, I know what you meant..."every one" and not "everyone",
but couldn't resist the humour possible).


Seriously, though, about your post, I think it's great that you
actually tried this oxidation experiment.  I, too, have never noticed
the awful effects of oxidation when I know I screwed up somewhere and
splashed a lot.  However, I'd also have to ask about your experiments
concerning the storage conditions.  As we all know, certian reactions
(well most reactions) exhibit a temperature dependant rate.  Depending
on at what temperature these beers were stored, you may not notice any
effects.  Further, there are actually two problems with splashing, as I
understand it.  First, there is oxidation.  Again, as I understand it,
this is really only a concern while the wort is really hot.  Oxidation
is a chemical reaction.  Then, there is aerobic activity, which is
caused when yeast get exposed to oxygen while fermenting.  This is a
biochemical reaction.  How would one structure experiments in order to
isolate one effect from the other?  I don't know for sure about that,
but I think it would have been interesting if you'd actually abused 9
bottles, stored 3 batches of 3 at various temperatures, and opened one
from each batch of 3 over time.  You can't flame someone for noticing
oxygen effects if they're storing their beer at 85F and you have yours
in a cold room.




SECOND TOPIC : Gloaters...


I'd like to take an opportunity to thank all who suggested things to
do, beers to drink, etc... in my somewhat recent request for
information of Belgium and Germany.  Also, I guess, I'd like to gloat!


We spent 5 days in Belgium followed by about 10 days in Germany.
German beer is very good, for what it is, but is far less "interesting"
than the stuff in Belgium....ergo...reccommendation.  Go to Germany
first, then Belgium.  The beer highlight in Belgium had to be the
Kulminator.  For you gloaters paying $5 for Duvel at Weinkeller, I had
a 1985 Stille Nacht for less, and a 1980 Chimay Blue for $7.  This
place is absolutley fabulous for variety.  Also excellent were Liefmans
Goudenband and Rodenbach Grand Cru.  Of course there were several
others including Orval, several frambois'es, krieks, gueze's, etc...
Apparently there is a bit of controversy over a recent decision to
start filtering Duvel....in any case, the stuff I bought here had yeast
in it, the stuff over there did not.  One thing you notice for sure is
that something horrible often happens to this beer in transit when they
import it, because it all tasted better over there (and it wasn't just
atmosphere).


Germany was fun too.  We visited both Hofbrauhaus and Andechs.  The
four in our group thought the Hofbrauhaus was a lot of fun, but both
the beer and atmosphere at Andechs were better.  We also had the
opportunity to have real Budvar Budweiser on tap, which was quite good.
Someone here made mention of these brewery hotels in this forum.  We
stayed one day at Hirsch hotel/brewery in Ottobeuren.  Some of
the beer here was not good; however, both the light and dark spezial
made up for this.  Also, if anyone is going over there, or if the
person who's keeping the database of pubs/ etc...  wants to know about
it, we picked up a whole little booklet about brewery hotels all over
germany while we were there.  I wish I could actually list the beers we
tried, but they are far too numerous to even remember.  The best part
of German beer, or better stated, the part we enjoyed the most was
getting fresh Weizen and Dunkel Weizen, as that is what is most
difficult to come by in this part of the states.  One more
note...although this is a beer forum, if you're driving through the
wine regions and enjoy wine at all, don't miss a chance to taste some
wonderful wine and experience great atmosphere all for a reasonable
price.


Overall, we were able to bring back 27 assorted bottles of beer of
varying sizes and styles, much of which was bought at Maroun Markt -
the largest beer market in the world.  It's like going out and buying a
case of Bud here to go there and buy a case of Weizen.


FINAL TOPIC : Porters...


Another side advantage of the recent trip was that when I came home,
two batches of homebrew that were bottled before we left seemed to age
gracefully.  We had made a weizenbock and a porter.  The latter had me
worried upon initial tasting because I used a pound of black patent as
someone else did in the Winners Circle.  The initial tasting of this
beer indicated that there was far too much black patent.  Now, though,
either my taste buds are accustomed or this beer aged very nicely.  So
what I'm asking is how much dark grain do the rest of you porter lovers
use and what do you feel is the optimal "time in bottle"?

It is finally time to retire my old plastic fermenter, and I am trying to
decide whether to start using the blow-off method.  My first brews also
suffered from a bitter astringency (to say it was "objectionable" is an
understatement).  As my skill as a brewer increased, the harshness faded.  Now
that I have switched to all-grain brewing, there is no hint of that old
harshness left (so all the other flaws come through clearly!). I wonder if the
blow off method is like a long aging period for ales.  A month or so in the
basement greatly improved those old harsh ales, but now my brew is drinkable as
soon as it's carbonated.  Perhaps the blow-off method allows the beginner to
get away with not-so-great brewing technique.  Has anyone ever stopped using
the blow-off method once they became "expert" brewers?  Then again, maybe all
those early brews permanently desensitized my tongue, and I just don't notice
the astringency anymore.

To Micah Millspaw:


I think most people in this forum know the difference between a lager yeast
and an ale yeast (and therefore the difference between a lager and an ale).
It is easy to stereotype, though, since most lagers running around (the US
anyway) are lighter recipes, and most ales (who are greatly outnumbered) tend
to be darker and more full-bodied.  The point is well-taken but has it really
been _that_ prevalent on the hbd?


To All:


With all of the microbreweries popping up around, does anyone know of a job
opening?  I'm thinking of maybe an apprentice taster position... 80)

Subject: Trouble shooting bad beer...




I thought it would be useful to list some common problems of bad beer and 
what MOST LIKELY could be the reasons for why they turned bad.  None of these 
quotes are my own but come directly from Charlie Papazians' first edition 
of the "The Complete Joy of Home brewing" (my bible).


BTW: Bravo to "BAUGHMANKR"!!!


*******************************************************************************


All excerpts from TCJOHB by Papazian are in qoutes (just protecting myself. I
dont want to become another Joe Biden or the Joaquim ? from BU)...


CIDERY FLAVORS


        "The number one reason why homebrewers may brew a cidery flavor
         beer is that an excessive amount of corn sugar and especially
         cane (or beet) sugar is used."


SOUR FLAVORS


        "Bacterial infection often enhanced by warm brewery temperatures and
         sluggish fermentations are to blame for sour beer."


MOLDY BEER


        "Moldy beer is the result of inadequate cleaning of equipment and
         undue exposure to microorganisms. Mold also is more likely to develop
         with inaprpopiate lagering (aging) at temperatures above 60 degrees F
         (16 C)."


CLOUDY BEER


        "The problem is, again, another kind of bacterial infection. It isn't
         the fault of the malt nor the sugars, and unless you are using
         very old or contaminated yeast, it isn't the yeast's fault either."


FLAT BEER


        "I don't know of a reason unless you've left an excessive amount of
         sterilant in your bottles or you are storing your beer at
         excessively cool temperatures."


         My $ 0.02 cents worth - you forgot to add priming sugar... OR its
         the morning after the frat party and you are drinking the leftover
         beer out of the keg.


OVERCARBONATED BEER


        "The simple explanation is that you've added too much priming
         sugar."


STRANGE AFTERTASTES


        "If you've got'em, either leave those baby diapers out of the brew
         of keep the risk of bacterial infections to a minimum."


         A FAMOUS DADILY - he who brews with diapers may get bad beer.  Anyone
         want to try experiments


APPARENT PREMATURELY STUCK FERMENTION


        "More often than not you're worrying... Aeration of the wort and choice
         of yeasts will make some difference, but usually minimal.  Roll with
         the punch and bottle when fermentation has stopped or is neglible."

OK for dogs, but apparently it can be a very effective way to kill a cat. 
I have this from a veterinarian who has watched too many cats die in the 
arms of their owners after they had been `treated' at home with garlic. 
Apparently it does bad things to their blood (exactly what, I don't remember).


I know it doesn't have anything to do with beer, but I couldn't let it pass.

Subject: Cardboard Nose


        Thought I'd pass on a recent experience with cardboard nose 
beers. I helped judge last week at the Calif. All State Homebrew 
Competition. This comp. is always well run and great fun. Lots of brew 
discussions, food, music and of course BEER. Great job again this 
year! The San Andreas Malts won the coveted homebrew club of the 
year award this year. They deserve it. When I got there I noticed they 
were using glasses for the judging samples instead of plastic cups. I 
was relieved to see Steve Norris busy rinsing that cardboard smell 
out of the glasses with a hot water rinse. Since Steve don't enter 
competitions anymore, they make him do the dishes. Anyway the first 
few beers we judged had a distinct cardboard (sometimes almond like) 
nose. I knew it couldn't be the glasses I saw them being rinsed and 
they smelled clean prior to pouring. I ran into this same thing at the 
Calif. State Fair comp. 2 years ago. If your sensitive to this smell, its 
like judging next to someone who is smoking. I got a plastic cup and 
we poured the next beer into a rinsed glass and the plastic cup, and 
the smell was only in the "rinsed" glass. I don't understand what is 
going on here but it ain't good for beer competitions. I stayed with the 
plastic cup for the rest of the judging, rinsing after each beer. Maybe 
the smells get released when the beer hits the glass do to the alcohol 
or ph or something. I think all competitions should switch to clear 
plastic cups to prevent this problem. What the hell their cheap.

Hi all. First, thanks for all the help with my little questions. My
Wyeast got going the very minute I sent my last panicky note. (All it
took was a little of that Preventitive Murphy's Law.) I got a good
deal on a carboy: $5 a pop at Bonne Sante in Hyde Park. They don't
have them very often though. Call ahead.


Now, another recipe from _The Closet of Sir Kenelme Digbie, Kt.
Opened_ (London: H. Brome, 1669) since the last one seemed quite
popular. This is from page 94. (Reproduced without permission,
naturally.)


A RECEIPT FOR METHEGLIN OF MY LADY WINDEBANKE
Take four Gallons of water; add to it, these Herbs and Spices
following. Pellitory of the Wall, Sage, Thyme, of each a quarter of a
handful, as much Clove gilly-flowers, with half as much Borage and
Bugloss flowers, a little Hyssop, Five or six Eringo-roots, three or
four Parsley-roots: one Fennel-root, the pith taken out, a few
Red-nettle-roots, and a little Harts-tongue. Boil these Roots and
Herbs half an hour; Then take out the Roots and Herbs, and put in the
Spices grosly beaten in a Canvass-bag, viz. Cloves, Mace, of each half
an Ounce, and as much Cinnamon, of Nutmeg an Ounce, with two Ounces of
Ginger, and a Gallon of Honey: boil all these together half an hour
longer, but do not skim it at all: let it boil in, and set it a
cooling after you have taken it off the fire. When it is cold, put six
spoonfuls of barm to it, and let it work twelve hours at least; then
Tun it, and put a little Limon-peel into it: and then you may bottle
it, if you please.


This one definitely sounds like Fun. Are there any opinions about why
one shouldn't skim this one? I don't see any source of yeast in here.
No clarifiers or eggdrometers either. If I can actually find all those
Roots and Herbs, I'll let you folks know how it turns out.


I have one other question (which I could probably do some research on
instead but I think there might be some interest in this here, maybe):


Has anybody out there heard of or seen, tasted or made beer with
quinine as an added flavoring? I really like drinking tonic water
straight, so this idea intrigues me. Maybe I'm weird, so what?

I recall reading a story some years back about a family who received
cadmium poisoning by using refrigerator shelves as barbecue grills!!
Apparently the metallic coating on the shelves contained cadmium, which
was absorbed into the food as it cooked. Don't remember any other details,
but ever since I've avoided placing raw food, such as fruits or veggies,
directly on the refrigerator shelf just in case.


Can anyone comment about this?  It's a bit off the subject, but surely
worth any enlightenment possible due to the seriousness of the effects.
All I can say is that whoever decided to use cadmium in a product such
as refrigerator shelving has to be criminally stupid, imo. Not that the
person who decided to use them for grilling was being real smart either.


I don't know if cadmium is still used this way, but I surely hope not!!

I'd think that with your stated goal of helping bring newcomers into the
homebrewing hobby you would naturally want to tell them how to get in touch
with the AHA.  It is, after all, the largest homebrewing association in
America, if not the world, not to mention a tremendous source of useful
information.  Even if you don't care to join the organization yourself, it
would seem sensible to at least inform your viewers of its existence.

OK, if it is impossible for homegrowers to determine the AA content of your 
hops, how do you figure out how much of your hops to use?  Many recipes call
for x amount of bittering units.  Do you just guess?

When using the licorice root be sure to bruise it (beat the hell out of

This brings up an interesting point. Just what is meant by "naturally
carbonated" in the commercial sense. I know of one case where a beer is touted
as naturally carbonated simply because it is not mixed with deoxygenated and
highly carbonated water on its way to the bottling line (a process employed by
the big breweries). The fermented beer is cold-filtered and placed in cold
storage where it is allowed to carbonate slowly under constant CO2 pressure. It
is then bottled under pressure. This avoids having to filter carbonated beer
under pressure which would create obvious problems.


The Okanagan Spring Brewery in Vernon, British Columbia, Canada, bottles just
like the average homebrewer .... yeast and all!!! Doesn't seem to stop the
customers. I guess quality beer sells itself. ;-)

Subject: The Color of Beer


Help me with the colors of my beers.  I know SRM is a measure of color--I've
even read about it.  But for the life of me I can't remember where, and I
can't locate anything in any of my books, digests, or Zymurgys.  (Of course,
that doesn't mean it's not there--I just can find it by using the indices,
tables of contents, and relatively detailed perusal.)  So question number 1: 
What's SRM, how is it measured, etc.?


Second:  I'm trying to produce a beer about the color of Anchor Steam.  The
recipe I'm using only has light dried malt extract, a little bit of pale malt,
and 2 cups of crystal malt, so it's primarily the crystal that's responsible
for the color.  I only have available to me 60 Lovibond crystal and 120
lovibond.  Last time, I used all 60L and it was too light.  I have since
learned (from the most recent Zymurgy) that the color I'm shooting for is 11-
13 SRM (whatever the hell that means; see question number 1).  So, question
number 2 is:  Assuming I only want to use 2 cups of crystal, how do I get 11-
13 SRM?  Do I use all 120L or some combination of 60 and 120?  What
combination would that be?


thanks,
- --frank


p.s.  If you'd have told me that by batch #7 I would be worrying about
esoteric things like the exact color of my beer, I'd have told you you were
nuts.  But, hey, I guess the learning curve's steep.

    I also have very hard well water. I do have a sediment filter

    the hole when one of my neighbors noticed my pump cycling on and

    typical of a bad tank. I had the tank replaceed and the effervescence
    went away and the pump cycled correctly.

I couldn't tell who sponsored the message (maybe "Friends of Louis

picture this guy making his own homebrew..."Hey, honey, how long am I
supposed to leave the beer in the oven???" 


Which actually raises some questions:
    1. Why would a beer be pasteurized?  As a yeast-icide method?  Won't
       heat affect the flavor of the beer?  Is this why Coors "cold-filters"?
    2. At what point in the process would a brewer pasteurize his beer?

This is particularly sad/humorous since Pilsner Urquell (arguably the

Subject: corriander and chile peppers


Brian, noting the connection between cooking and homebrewing, asks about
cuisines that use chiles, but not corriander, or vice versa:


Yeah, you're right.  A lot of homebrewers cook.  I got started cooking first,
and picked up homebrewing second.  I'm pretty expert on Chinese, and ok on
Indian and Thai.  I can't comment on Mexican.  You're correct, the three Asian
cuisines use both chiles and cilantro (corriander).  I think it's just an
accident of geography.  Also, keep in mind that Chinese is a very varied
cuisine, and although cilantro is pretty widespread, chiles are used in any
significant quantities only in Szechuan and Hunan cuisine, but very little or
not at all in Cantonese, Fukienese, Tawainese, Shanghai, and Mandarin
cuisines, although these latter types do make use of cilantro.  In Indian and
Thai, both chiles and cilantro are everywhere.  The seeds, roots, and leaves
are all used in Indian and Thai.  In Chinese, it's primarily the leaves.


Now, here's a cuisine (another one I'm fairly expert at) that uses chiles, but
not cilantro:  Cajun and Creole.  Both Cajun and Creole use a lot of chile,
primarily cayenne and tabasco peppers, but virtually no cilantro.  Cilantro
just isn't cultivated in Louisiana.


I would also be tempted to say that real Southern Barbecue is a cuisine (yes,
I would define it as a cuisine) that uses chiles, but not cilantro, but the
importance of chiles in BBQ is arguable, so maybe this shouldn't count as an
example.


Ok, enough non-homebrewing talk.  I'm taking it to email.

  Is there any reason for not doing a primary ferment in a 10 gallon stainless
brewpot?  Cook, cool, and pitch right into the pot.  Not much chance for "bad
stuff" to get in.  Granted you would not be able to rack off the trub.  You'd 
also have to deal with the cover somehow, maybe cut a hole in it?  I can see
it maybe working for simple ales: quick single-stage ferment, bottle right 
from the brewpot.  Comments?

While in DC last week I went to an ethiopian restaurant where they had
Tej, an ethiopian mead.  It was *wonderful*.  Does anyone have a recipe?
