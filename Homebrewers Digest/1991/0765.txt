Used to be there were two ways of pasteurizing in a commercial brewery:


        "tunnel" - after bottling, bottles go through a heated tunnel.
        This is obviously hard on the beer, since you have to heat the
        bottle long enough to get the entire contents up to temp.  You
        can neither heat nor cool too quickly or you'll break the bottle.


        "flash" - beer is passed through a heated section of tubing on its
        way into the bottle.  Heating/cooling happens much faster.  As I
        understood the process, it was a little trickier--and obviously
        the bottling line has to be clean.


Used to be that almost all large-scale commercial brewers pasteurized their
beer, and most used the tunnel method.  I don't know how much it's changed
with the ultra-fine filtering that's now practical, but I think it would be
interesting if anyone knows.


As for the bumper sticker:

Coors was one brewer which did not pasteurize even "back then".  This is
*one* reason they kept such tight control on distribution/sales of their
beer...regardless of whether you like their beer, at least they understood
that it was a perishable food.  They tried to ensure that it didn't travel
too far and stayed cold.  (Obviously, with beer as light as Coors, *any*
off-taste is a serious problem.)


OK, now, the rest of this is just for information.  I take no position on
the politics; I don't want to talk about the politics here because the
topic is beer...but if you want to make sense of the bumper sticker and the
matter of pasteurization, here goes:  There are various Coors businesses
held by various members of the Coors family.  As a rule they have been
active in politics and quite conservative.  There is a long-standing feud
between the brewery management and organized labor--e.g., labor accuses
management of union-busting or discriminatory practices; management accuses
labor of featherbedding.  After one particularly bitter dispute some years
ago, a campaign began on the labor side (not to say that the unions
approved it _per_se_) to convince people that Coors was somehow unhealthy
or potentially dangerous because, unlike most other beers, it wasn't
pasteurized.  It was not because of any particular incident related to
unpasteurized beer; it was just a means of manipulating public opinion.  I
don't think it had much effect, and in fact I'm surprised to see such a
sticker still around these days (with more beers not being pasteurized).

Subject:  Make a lauter tun




I've got a keg (one of the 15.5 gallon ones) that I plan on making into
a lauter tun.  I'm pretty sure I know HOW I want to make it.


So, get to the point you say.  Well here is my question:


I know this thing will be fine for batches on the order of 10 gallons,
but will it be too small for 5 gallon batches?  I don't think I will
want to make a double batch EVERY time.


Thanks!

 Subject: ORGANIC MALT
 
 Good news for the health food nuts.
 
 My research into nitrosamines in beer has ended by finding a source of malt 
 that not only contains the absolute minimum levels of nitrosamines but is 
 also available in an organically grown version.
 
 BACKGROUND:
 
 Nitrosamines (a dangerous carcinogen) are produced in malt by the chemical 
 reaction between combustion by-products and precursers generated by 
 germination.  
 
 Nitrosamines can be reduced in two ways.  The first and most expensive is to 
 use indirect kilning where in the grain is heated through heat exchangers to 
 avoid contact with flame products.
 
 The second method is "sulphuring" wherein elemental sulphur is sprayed on the 
 grain before and during kilning.  I have no idea what the chemistry is but it 
 reduces the nitrosamine production significantly...  by "coincidence", just 
 enough to get directly kilned malt just under the 10 PPB FDA limit.
 
 The most effective process is to do both procedures.  This typically results 
 in undetectable levels (less than 1PPB) of nitrosamines.
 
 The major producer of malt in this country is Bries and its affiliates and 
 from what little I could extract in telephone conversations with the 
 president, all their malt, except crystal malt is direct/sulphur.
 
 Nitrosamine production is maximal in malt that is kilned with high moisture 
 content such as crystal malt.  That is why it must be indirectly kilned and 
 sulphured just to meet the FDA max.
 
 Minnesota Malting, makes malt using any of all of the above in addition to 
 supplying organically grown grain, if desired.  What they call "organic malt" 
 is indirect without sulphur because there customer doesn't want any chemicals 
 added but it is still organically grown.
 
 They will sell 25 lbs bags, ship UPS and the price is .55 per lb plus 
 shipping.
 
 I just received a bag of two row today and for what it is worth, the 25 lb 
 bag weighs 32 lbs.  It seems to meet all the criteria for good malt according 
 to Noonan.  I will give it a try in a couple of days.  
 
 Just specify 2 row or 6 row, indirect. You will have to check on the price of 
 the organically grown.  I am not sure if it is the same.

Subject: Boots bitter kits




Howdy,
  One of my co-workers just returned from England and brought me two cans
of Boots Bitter concentrated wort.  I've never heard any reviews, comments,
flames, praises, etc. on this brand, so I was wondering if anyone has tried
it.  It sez on the can it uses 'hop extract'.  Should I add some hops to
the boil???  The instructions also say to use 2lbs sugar, I think I'm gonna
use a couple #'s of honey instead.  Good Idea or Bad Medicine??  It also
comes with a little foil pouch of dry 'genuine Brewers yeast'.  Any ideas?
should I just trash it and use wyeast, or can this be used w/ a starter?


   Any responses would be greatly appreciated.


   BTW, has anyone developed any recipe databases for DOS?  I saw some
mentions of hypercard stacks for this purpose but nada on IBMs.  Let me
know if there is any interest.

This reminds me.  I know the Wyeast package recommends using a
1.020 SG starter (less than half a typical wort SG).  Is there in
fact a likelihood that Kevin killed his yeast (or shocked or
whatever) by using much more extract than called for?

Looks like I confused some people (oops):  I mentioned that the carboy
had a greenish tinge only as a passing reference.  There probably was a
layer of film from some food coloring that dissolved and left the carboy's
normal color - clear with a greenish tinge.  The thing is old and so I'm
not worried about the color.


Thanks everyone for the advice on chemical agents to get rid of the rust
spot. I'll get that soon.

Actually, 15 minutes is much longer than you need, assuming there are
no scratches or other places for the nasties to hide.  I have been
told, by someone who should know, that a very weak bleach solution
(10-20ppm, about a "capful" in 5 gallons) will kill almost all the
bacteria in 10 seconds.  A nice advantage of using such a dilute
concentration is that you don't have to rinse afterwards (especially
nice, if you suspect the cleanliness of your water source).

To Kenneth Munno:
I tried the same trick, but with Chimay Red.  I used two bottles also dated
10/90.  The starter consisted of 1/2 cup of DME and 2 cups water.  It took
about a week at 70F for any activity to appear.  The Abbey Ale that I brewed
with this yeast is probably one of the finest beers I've made to date.  It is
an all-grain recipe which I'll post if anybody is interested.


To all HBD:
Is it normal to take this long when culturing yeast from a bottle of
commercial beer?  I believe that the yeast used by Chimay actually consists of
five different strains (kinds?).  If I re-pitched this yeast several times
wouldn't one of the more dominant strains take over?

Subject: Bitchez Brew Stout




This came out fantastic.  I highly recommend brewing it.


6 lbs. dark dry malt (M&F)
2 lbs. amber dry malt (M&F)
 .75 lb. roasted barley
 .5 lb. black patent
1 lb. crystal malt
2 CUPS (not lbs) Quaker Oats
2 oz. fresh Bullions hops (boil)
 .6 oz. fresh Willammette hops (finish)
Whitbread Ale Yeast


Add hops in last 5-6 minutes of the boil.  All specialty grains should
be cracked, first.  Soak the specialty grains & Quaker Oats in cold
water for 15 minutes, bring to a boil, remove grains with strainer as
wort comes to a boil.  This has an awful hot-break, and needs to be
nursed for about 5 minutes before you can leave it safely.  I went
light on the Oatmeal because the oils in it tend to be detrimental
towards head retention.


Comments:  This beer improves substantially after about 2 weeks in the
bottle, as hop aroma subsides and the large amount of roasted barley
assumes it's place in the forefront.  It's my favorite beer to date,
but if I were going to brew it again I might cut back on the roasted
barley by about .25 lb, and lessen the boiling hops (either to 1 oz.
of Bullions, or 1.5 of some lower alpha hop).  Whitbread ale yeast was
used because of the low attenuation rate:  this stout is NOT sweet,
but has lots and lots of body.

 >> mine sits on top of a 2500 deg , forced air melting furnace and brings
 7 gals to boil in about 15 min. you can't possibly hurt a steel kettle on 
 anything even that hot
 
  > I don't know what you used to determine you temperature but it would not 
 be possible to boil water or wort in a controlled manner at 2500  degrees F. 
 The problem is (and its just a small problem) that carbon  steel melts at 
 2500 degrees F. Stainless steel and aluminum have much  lower melting temps. 
 I suggest that you try using a tantalum kettle  it won't melt till 5100 
 degrees F. And just so you know water boils  at 212 and is a gas after that.
 
 I will try to be gentle responding to this utter rubbish.  I don't want to be 
 accused of being confrontational.
 
 1.  I measure the flame temperature with a thermocouple pyrometer.  This 
 instrument is to a foundry what a hydrometer is to a brewery.
 
 2.  SS contains chromium which has a melting temperature around 3500 F.  This 
 puts the melting point of the alloy significantly above that of carbon steel.
 
 3.  Aluminum melts around 1200 F.  To lump aluminum with SS is misleading at 
 minimum.
 
 4.  Precisely because water boils at 212 F and turns into an expanding, 
 cooling gas, one can heat it in kettles without worrying about the kettles 
 melting.  This is true, even if the flame temp is far above the melting point 
 of the kettle.
 
 Aside from an oxy-acetyline tourch, with its intensley hot and concentrated 
 flame, you can not melt a steel kettle in an ordinary flame, particularly if 
 full of water.  A  empty steel kettle will sit on my furnace all day and 
 never melt.  It will get red hot and eventually oxidize and fall apart but it 
 will never melt.  An aluminum kettle would melt into a puddle in a couple of 
 minutes if empty, but boil water all day.

 While I am counter-flaming, I would like to point out that most reasonable

 anything I have ever said.
 
 >Occasionally (once per 10 batches), I run boiling water through
  just to be anal. 
 
 Just what does such gutter talk have to do with beer making?  And why is it 
 necessary and accepted without anyone else objecting?
 
 From: KARL DESCH <KCDESCH`at`ucs.indiana.edu>
 
 >1.  This keg appears to be all aluminum.  If memory serves me correctly 
 Papazian suggests to avoid using aluminum as a boiling pot.  What about SS 
 makes it better than aluminum?
 
 It has a much stronger tendancy to leave your brain cells intact.  Oops, 
 forgot to turn off flame.
 
 Although there is a great deal of debate about the cause and effect of 
 aluminum found in the brains of Alzheimer victims, the implication is far too 
 freightening to even consider using an aluminum kettle for long term boiling.
 
 Do yourself a favor and take it to a recycling center and consider the sawing 
 an aerobic exercise.

Why don't you try liquid hop extract??
Jeff Pzena, owner of the Modern Brewer & a friend of mine was carrying a bottle
around at a party he had last week adding it directly to the homebrew.
Now there's a hophead!!

Subject: Gingered Ale




Brewed, aged 1 month, and sampled.  Pure heaven.


"Old-Time Jaspers Gingered Ale"


A five gallon recipe


9 lbs. Pale dry malt extract (M&F)
 .75 lbs. crystal malt, cracked
3 lbs. light clover honey
1 oz. Hallertau hops (boil)
1/2 oz. Hallertau hops (finish)
6 oz. fresh ginger, peeled and grated
grated peels of 4 oranges
1.5 tsp. cinnamon
 .5 tsp. nutmeg
1.5 tsp. Irish moss
Whitbread Ale yeast


SG: 1.071    FG: 1.019


First, a word about the hops:  Yes, Hallertau is a lager hop.
However, the ginger and orange peel both go a long way towards both
bittering and flavoring the beer.  Using a more assertive ale hop
would a) add too much bitterness and b) overpower the other flavors
that I want to come through.  Besides, Hallertau has that spicy touch
that makes this perfect for a holiday brew.


This brew is just barely sweet, at the threshold of perception.  A
strong, heavy body follows, the ginger and orange blending together
and taking you through from the middrink to the aftertaste.  Th
finish is incredibly long, both the high alcohol content and the
ginger-orange aftertaste lingering for a full 8 or 9 seconds after
swallowing.


Using a more attenuative yeast would make this drier and more
alcoholic, but I like the balance given by the Whitbread.  Primary
fermentation took about 6 days, 6 days in secondary, aged 1 month at
tasting.  This beer is copper colored; I'm thinking of making a
version with a little lactose instead of the crystal malt to try to
retain the sweetness while having a paler color.  Irish moss is a
necessity with this brew.

several other unsubtle plugs for the now infamous CR02 product...




God Jack must your every  response contain a plug.
WE'RE SICK OF IT ALREADY!!! GIVE IT F***** REST!


Do you expect people to take your advice/comments seriosuly when every one is
prefaced by these completely unsubtle plugs for your commercial products.
Do you think you're cute or clever. You're not, you're just progressively more 
annoying.


There was absolutely no need to insert this plug in your responses
and it shows a COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT for the members of this forum
(as opposed to Kinney B's behavior who has many more products he could plug 
than you do, but is always respectful of this forum).


I had begun to think that perhaps you were becoming a little more considerate 
in your postings of the readers of the HBD. I can see now I was mistaken.


PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE 
I am asking politely and on behalf of all the brewers in this forum.
If you have any respect for other brewers leave the plugs out. 
If you choose to participate in this forum then stick to the issues
and save the plugs for private e-mail.

Sounds like another good argument in favor of using pitchers (one of my
favorite judge related crusades :-)...


Competitions I have worked the beers were served at pitchers, and the glasses
collected and rinsed separately. Once they were removed from the boxes and
cleaned the never touched cardboard during the judging. Sounds like some
procedural changes there might help a lot. Also we often just rinse our own
from water in pitchers right at the table, saves the stewards some work.


>So the environment looses out on this one.


Umm, I'll fight you on this one. At least you can use HDPE 1 or 2 glasses and
collect them and give them over to recylcing...


Russ sez:

AAAck. I never use soap on my beer glasses. I use B-brite. There are other
cleaning agents that many/most bars use. Soap is much more difficult to rinse
clean without leaving a film. The cleaners bars use (sorry don't know any brand
names) are chosen because they do rinse clean. B-Brite also does, which is why
I use it on my glassware. Perhaps this is a little anal, but I have found soap
doesn't rinse nearly as well. I'd suggest changing your cleaning agent. Soap
also may not clean away the cardboard aroma.

Subject: Stress Testing Beer


To Larryba on stress testing your beers. 


This is not a new idea. Many micros test their brewery operations in 
this manor. They take samples from several different points in the 
brewery, cap the bottles and let them sit at room temp. By observing 
the turbidity of the sample, one can correlate cleanliness. I think 4 
days plus indicates adequate cleanliness. George Fix has related 
some procedures for the practical homebrewer in a paper he 
presented a few years ago at an AHA conference. He also discusses 
other easy steps to allow one to test their brewing operation with 
minimal high tech tools. Interested parties can contact the AHA for 
conference transcripts. I like the one comment George made once. "If 
you want to give your beers the ultimate stress test, just ship them 
via UPS anywhere !". Low level bacterial contamination has been the 
death of several microbrewers and a continuing problem for others. 
These low levels of contamination really starts showing up when the 
brewers start bottling their beers. The average liquor/grocery store is 
as good a tester as UPS.


On a more  humorous note, I recently toured the AB facility in 
Fairfield,Ca. The tour didn't go through the brew house. They said they 
were "remodeling". I have always contended that the American 
brewing industry is determined to convince the average American 
beer drinker that the more beer tastes like water the better it is.  This 
way they can just bottle water and like magic they have mega profit. 
Well I think they have succeeded. I speculate that they really DIDN'T 
have a brew house at AB. They are just bottling carbonated water. You 
can do your own testing to verify this hypothesis. Just blind taste their 
beer next to a cold glass of carbonated water. I rest may case.

morning, folks!


   i have a question about the term/style called "strong ale". could someone
please pass along a definition and/or the names of some examples?
or maybe even a favorite recipe ;-)


neil mager asks about well water with dissolved oxygen - nope, its not the
tank. all of my neighbors with deep wells (mine is ~530') have the same
condition. i am, however, no longer convinced that it is really oxygen.

RE: CARDBOARD IN COMPETITION GLASSES
A suggestion for Russ Wigglesworth:
Trash the cardboard boxes and invest in some plastic crates, like the ones
commonly used by restuarants and cafeterias to hold their glassware. They
might be available through a restuarant supply outlet, or perhaps your
friendly local brewpub manager can help you locate the crates.
