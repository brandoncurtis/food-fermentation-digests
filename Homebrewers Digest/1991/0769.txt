I'm heading over to Scotland in a few days to tour the pubs, uh, I
mean for business, so the digest will be running all on its own for a
couple of weeks. Please try to behave while I'm gone, and note that
change and unsubscribe requests will not be handled for a while.  If
the digest stops, please don't panic! At worst, it'll be gone for a
few days (or weeks), and at best, there should (might) be somebody
available here to fix it. There's also a tiny chance I'll be able to
check my email while I'm away.

 Subject: Whose Kegs Anyway?
 
 >In all this talk about using stainless steel kegs for kettles and 
 fermenters, I've noticed one small detail missing: Most of these kegs belong 
 to someone else! To me, this has two elements, one moral and one political. 
 The first is that, since most kegs are the property of breweries, it's simple 
 theft to cut them up and use them for kettles. While it's true that this is 
 less expensive--for you--than buying a SS kettle from a kitchen supply store, 
 it's *not* less expensive for the brewery which has to replace it. Kegs are
 expensive.
 
 BRAVO!  My only regret is that I did not think of this first.  I have three 
 "stolen" kegs in my basement but I did recently by a SS brewpot for my 
 belated penance.  I fell a little less guilty because mine are aluminum but 
 your point is well taken, as it should be.  It's a bit like pirating videos 
 or software.  Come to think of it, it's much worse.  It's like stealing 
 hardware.

 Subject: Window screen
 
 Jack writes:

 <All the modern window screens I've seen in my area, are made of some mystery
 metal.  It doesn't rust, so it's not steel, it oxidizes too easily and the
 oxide is too dark to be aluminum.  Maybe it's galvanized steel.  The oxide
 comes off on your hands very easily.  Jack's idea is inventive, but I would
 recommend against using window screen. 
 
 The term "window screen" is more to define the mesh size and type than the 
 specific material.  Although I am using "hardware cloth" as it is called, 
 window screen is also available in copper and stainless if you hunt around.
 
 I believe that "hardware cloth" is galvanized steel.  I currently am taking a 
 zink suplement with my daily vitimins so I doubt that any zink leaching off 
 the little bit of screen would do anything other than save a few more of my 
 brain cells.

 Subject: Window screen revisited
 
 >I just had another thought about the screen-around-the-pipe lauter
 tun.  If the only exit for a large diameter container was centrally
 located, a lot of sugars could be left behind in the grain.  The
 sparge water can sit stagnant at the sides of the tun where there is
 little "current." 
 
 That is why it took an intrepid experimenter to risk a batch of beer to check 
 it out.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  That is also why I 
 included my method for checking on the sparge completeness in the article.
 
 However, what actually happened was that my wort was boiling and burning 
 under the false bottom and I lifted it, foolishly thinking that I could put 
 it back in when ready to sparge.  The "intrepid experimenter"  was actually a 
 victim of his own stupidity but got lucky.  Don't knock it till you try it.
 
 I did another batch this weekend this way and got the same results.  That 
 makes 4 with only the pipe and screen.  BTW, the pipe is 1/4 in and only 
 three inches long and the screen only extends about two inches.
 
 Now that I have my ten gal SS pot, I have advanced the process another step 
 and made sparging much simpler.  Instead of retiring the enamel kettle, I am 
 still using it for mashing.  BTW, mine has now developed the "creaking 
 handle" syndrome but at least at mash temp, it is easy to lift by the lip 
 with potholders.
 
 I use the SS kettle to heat the sparging water and it runs directly into the 
 mash kettle (moved down to a stool), thence into the jug.  The whole business 
 is more or less automatic and needs only a watchful eye.  
 
 I start heating the water about an hour before the mash cycle is complete and 
 it takes about that long to come to a boil.....  I can't wait to hear from 
 the moms on boiling sparge water.  
 
 I did, however,  learn about turning wort into baked on enamel.  Mom got that 
 one right.

Subject: Need Learned Opinions On Beers To Buy


Gentle Beer Fanciers--


This request has nothing to do with Brewing Beer, per se, but rather
with Evaluating Beer.  I haven't brewed yet, but I will soon, and would
like some experienced and/or learned opinions.


I find there are some commercial beers for sale out there that are not
too bad.  But that's my taste.  I'd like to hear if anyone has anything
good to say about popularly priced beers.  In other words, if you couldn't
brew, and you couldn't spend $10 for a six of <insert favourite mini/micro
brew name here>, what would you buy?


For instance:  Coors has a Christmas beer out now.  The label says Stout,
but if it's a Stout, my name's Porter.  In comparison to normal Coors,
it's a solid at room temperature, however.  And "In My Humble Opionon"
it's pretty good.  Any Comments?


I lived in Germany for six years and drank 'microbrewery' beer every
day (and it was !!CHEAP!!).  The selection at my local 'drink-market'
was great (almost all in nice, uniform, brown, returnable 0.5L bottles).
The problem then was not choosing a good beer, but trying to taste them
all in 6 years...


Now, I live in Raleigh, NC.  We have "State Liquor" here and although
one can buy Beer and Wine in grocery stores, there seems to be a subtle
pressure on the part of the Bureaucracy to limit the number of available
beers to a Few Major Brands.  Or I may have it wrong, it may be that nothing
but MilBudLob is acceptable to the consumer here.  Remember that this is
the same state that let a Chicken Processing Plant go uninspected for
11 years while the ice cream plant next door (and employing only 6 people)
was inspected several times over the last 5 years.  And this is the state
that elected Terry Sanford and Jesse Helms.  But the weather's nice
and the beaches are clean, so it's not a bad place...


Many of the beer names that I see flashing by on my screen here are not
available in my area.  Or at least I haven't found them yet.  So I'd
appreciate hearing about 'national brands' that won't turn my toenails
green or empty my wallet.


Thanks.


I'll summarize, so don't post unless you feel it's essential or can't
reach me by mail (it happens).

Subject: Label removing


Sterling asks about label removing.


I used to use Washing Soda (Sodium Carbonate) when I used to use bottles.
I recall someone else mentioning Washing Soda in a recent post so I'd
like to recount an experience I had with Washing Soda:


I found that Washing Soda in hot tap water worked really well to remove
labels from bottles, even the foil ones, so I proceeded to do a large
number of them at one time.  I let the bottles soak for 8 or 10 hours
(I don't really recall exactly) and then rinsed them inside and out
with plenty of hot water.  I prodeeded to sanitize as usual, with
bleach solution, followed by hot tapwater rinse, and then upside-down
into a case lined with paper towels.  Everything went fine until I
set up to bottle.  When the bottles dried, I noticed a white residue
on the outside (all over, not just where the label was).  If it's on
the outside, then it must also be on the inside.  No amount of washing
could remove the residue, however, I could mechanically rub the residue
off.  I figured it was either the Sodium Carbonate or the glue or
some byproduct of the Sodium Carbonate and glue or Sodium Carbonate
and the foil labels.  I did quite poorly in chem, so I wasn't sure
what it was, but I was pretty sure that the Sodium Carbonate was
alkaline.  If I soaked the bottles in an acid, maybe it would convert
the residue into a soluble salt.  I chose lemon juice and it worked.
a 4 hour soak in dilute lemon juice followed by a hot water rinse
removed the residue.


After all that, I'd like to recommend that you maybe fill your bottles
with plain water and cap them before soaking them in the Washing Soda
solution (i.e. keep the Washing Soda OUTSIDE the bottles).  Maybe
someone with more knowledge of Chem could comment on whether my problem
was due to the glue or foil or if Sodium Carbonate should be avoided
for cleaning glassware.


Al.

I would like information and tips on the Axbridge Microbrewery (one of which
I just bought).  It's basically a bag in which both the primary and
secondary fermentation takes place, and from which you can tap a glass
of beer after 21 days.  Any special recipies out there?  Any hints or
pitfalls I should look out for?

From: Eric Mintz <ericm`at`bach>
Subject: Specific Gravity before and after boil 


I'm now on my 7th batch of all-grain brews and I noticed something
surprising (to me, anyway :-) on this last batch. I measured SG before
and after the boil for the first time (in the previous batches, I either
measured before or after, but not both).  I expected the SG to be higher
due to the evaporation from the boil, right?  WRONG!  The SG dropped!
The only explanation I could think of is that the trub (before
precipitation -- that is, while still in solution) contributed some to
the SG.  Either that or I screwed up my before-boil measurement :-).
Anyone care to take a stab at what's going on here?

Subject: Thermal properties of materials, polyethylene tubing




Here is data on melting points (deg Fahrenheit) and thermal conductivities (Btu-ft/hr-ft2-F):


Material      Melting point     Thermal cond.   Comments 
- --------      -------------     ------------  ------------------------------
Cast iron       2000 - 2200       18 -  30
Aluminum alloys  890 - 1215       67 - 128    Pure Al: higher value, each pair
304/316 SS      1600 - 1700*        9.4       The stainless you'll probably get
Glass            930 - 2800**    0.4 - 0.84   Pure silica: high values


*  Maximum use temperatures:  metallurgy is more important than melting point.
** Softening point:  these are supercooled liquids, so the viscosity keeps 
dropping with temperature.  No true m.p. exists.


To convert temperatures to deg C, subtract 32 and then divide by 1.8.  To 
convert the thermal conductivities to W-cm/cm2-C, multiply by 3.44x10-4.  There,
now whether you prefer metric or English units, you've got it!


By the way, I've heard the comparison that cast iron and stainless steel are 
comparable insulators to glass.  The numbers above say glass is at least ten 
times better!  My source of information: Machine Design 1987 Materials Reference
Issue.  Now, anyone who wants to do the calculations regarding meltdown of pots
can, with the help of a good Chemical/Mechanical Engineering textbook.  Oh yeah,
it helps if you're an engineer (we still need a few train drivers, right?).


Tubing:
If anyone wants some clear polyethylene tubing at $0.30/ft, I have some in 20 ft
lengths.  It's really good for keg hose: no plasticizers to leach.  A bit stiff.
If you want it, please don't clutter the Digest, order direct via email.  This 
isn't really a commercial; I'd ordered this for fellow QUAFF members, but only
a couple came through with $$.

Subject: Detergents, Label Removal, and TSP


Boy, what you learn on the HBD.  I've found the thread about soap vs.
detergent useful for a couple of reasons.  First of all, the fact that the
soap film kills beer head goes a long way toward explaining why my good 'n
bubbly homebrew lacks a good head.  I handwash all my glasses (the drought,
ya know,) and am thinking about changing my dishwashing brand to something
"cleaner".  Larry Barello recommends Dawn...any other suggestions?  (thanks
also to Larry for providing the ingredients to check for.)


Second detergent notion:  Sterling Udell (HBD#767) asks:


>I've heard that prolonged soaking in the proper chemical will make even
>the most recalcitrant labels float right off.  Problem is, I can't
>remember _what_ chemical it is.


In HBD #766, Larry B. mentions Washing Soda (sodium carbonate).  I'd like to
add my suggestion of TSP (Tri Sodium Phosphate, a powder available at
hardware stores) mixed with water.  I used a 30+ gallon garbage can to hold
the bottles and the solution overnight (had a *lot* of bottles).  Funny
thing:  The labels on the crown cap bottles slide off easily; the labels on
the screw tops don't.  Consistent for different brands.  Go figure.  Of
course, a thorough washing of the bottles should follow.


Now then, to the homebrewing audience:  Waddaya think about TSP?  Good or
bad?

PS:  Thanks to all for the pasteurizing info, based on my "Up Yoors Coors"  
entry.  I certainly wouldn't consider removing my yeast (it wouldn't be
"real ale", but then again, it probably would be a "real pain"!), but just
think:  Anchor flash pasteurizes and Coors doesn't, and then compare the
flavor.  I know the ingredients and process differ, but that flashing,
amazingly, can't be all bad.

Subject: Late Boil-up


Damndest thing.  In all my year of brewing :)  I've never seen anything
like it.


OK, everyone knows how much wort likes to boil over when you first
start it at 212 degrees.  I know this as well as anyone, having suffered
through a boilover of what my brewpartner termed "biblical proportions"
last spring.


Hopefully everyone knows how to get through this, too.  I don't recall
who tipped us off to this, but it was someone here on the HBD . . . When
the wort forms a head and starts making a run for the edge of the pot,
you pour a splash of cold water in it.  Puts it right in its place,
which is back in the pot.


But this is off the subject.  Usually, I have to do this maybe 4 or 5
times - 10 or 12 for a particularly ornery brew - and then the foam
breaks up and the wort settles in and boils happily.  No problem.


Until tonight.  I was boiling up a batch of stout, pretty basic in
most respects.  I had given the wort the cold-water treatment maybe
half a dozen times, and it had started behaving nicely.  I went off to
do the dishes.  At 47 minutes of boil, some innate brewsense told me to
look over my shoulder . . . Sure enough, the wort was just making its
break.  I leaped to the stove, killed the burner, moved the pot, and
started it heating again.  I cleaned up the spill (not much) and went
back to the dishes (i had to clear the sink for wort chilling), but
10 minutes later, the wort did its thing again.  This time I was ready
with the cold water, but I still didn't understand it.


Anyway, I finished the batch, and it's happily starting its ferment in
my closet as I type.  But I still don't know why it started boiling up
again so late.  I'm not excessively experienced - about 20 batches -n
but I've NEVER seen this happen before.  Has anyone else?  Do you
have any clue why?  Or how to avoid it?


Many thanks . . .

Subject:  A review of Sisson's (a brewpub in Baltimore, MD)


Sisson's can be found just south of the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore.  It's
about six block south of the MD Science Center (from there, go south on Light
St. and turn right on Cross, Sisson's is #36, on the right).  In a seedy part
of town, but aren't all great bars?  (maybe not the Top of the Mark).
They have three house brews on tap: Marble Golden Ale, Amber Ale, and Stout.


Marble Golden: A pleasingly bitter and creamy textured concoction with strong
hop aroma and flavor.  The hops definitely are out in front of the malt, but
the malt that's there is slightly sweet, yet light and sneaking around
in the background.  The color is a beautiful gold, and the flavor assertive.
The beer's body was just enough to make it swallow well (not something to chew
on).  I give it a 17 on the 20 point scale.  A beer I'll drink again.


Amber:  A very malty, somewhat sweet brew.  Color was pleasing, kinda rosy; a
bit paler than Sam Adams.  The aroma was dull, and the flavor nutty with a
tiny hint of clove.  Hop character was lacking (in my biased hophead opinion)
but the body was good (very frothy, nice head, substantial mouthfeel).  My
wife commented "it coats your tongue," but I thought it was within reason.
I gave it a 13.


Stout: Deep brown, moderately bitter and not too sweet.  I always end up
comparing stouts to Guiness Stout, and I thought this one was
less sweet, slgithly more bitter, maltier, and with less body.  The head
was disappointing.  Lots of flavors to sort through: malty with roasted
(black patent, even) tones, hints of yeastiness (I thought of once-risen
bread dough), and butterscotch.  I gave it a 14.


About the place: good bottled beer selection, also an excellent restaurant.
They specialize in cajun/creole, but the seafood caught my eye.  They have a
Gumbo du jour, and a soup, and a pasta.  I missed the "Bay Scallops and
Linguini with Lobstercream Sauce," but I think i may go back for it.
Great dessert menu--don't miss the Black Pearl Pie, sort of a warm cookie
(chocolate chip) cut in wedges.  If you go, be sure to get tickets for the
Monet exhibit at the BMA, closing Jan 16, '92.  Worth a day trip from DC.


BTW "the 20 point scale" is from Papazian, p. 318.  I used it in hopes
of being more objective.

Subject:      Bottles and labels


If you want sturdy bottles with labels that come off easily, try to
find re-usable bottles.  In this area (the northeast) Yeungling
brews are my choice.  Since the brewery has to remove the labels to
re-use the bottles, they don't put them on with the horrible glues
that are used for throw-away bottles.  Yeungling labels slide right off
after three minutes in hot water!  Plus the bottles are nice heavy brown
long-necks.  And the beer that comes in them is fine stuff - my favorite
is their porter.


I agree with Michael Hall that Dos Equis labels are the WORST!  To me,
they are just not worth the effort.  Why no leave the labels on, you
say?  Well, I'm a little anal about that....

I did a Medline search for reviews on the subject of Alzheimers a few days ago
so I could track down some reading to refresh my memory on this topic. I won't
bore digest readers with the details of recent statistical and molecular
genetic findings since this is a beer digest, but it appears that the
aluminum issue is one of those things that was blown out of proportion. The
genetic component of the disease is what is grabbing the interest of the
scientific community since predisposition to Alzheimers may be predictable and
possibly treatable in the future through genetic diagnosis and manipulation.
That is why the proposed study is irrelevent and as stated "it would be
impossible to isolate this as the only difference between the two populations".
That is a flaw of the statistical approach which is often revealed by more
solid 'real' data. Furtheremore, two populations selected for their differences
in predisposition to Alzheimers likely have many genetic differences. The study
has a bias before it even begins. I just Relax, Don't Worry, Have a Mitchum ...
for my friends' sake. ;-)




I agree with all the replies to Larry Barello wrt DMS problems. It seems that
he has all the bases covered except for the malt variable.

Good to hear from another Canadian, eh? Yeast lysis is affected both by time
and temperature. A rule of thumb is max. 14 days in primary if you're doing a
single-stage fermentation. Racking too late risks oxidation. Once your beer is
in the secondary you can relax on the order of months since the yeast carried
over in suspension is healthy. I'd recommend bottling soon unless you
fermented this batch at cooler temperatures ie. 60F instead of the average
68-72F.

I've noticed this recently as well. It seems that the digest is limited to
approximately 50K per issue. Postings appear to be put into a queue as they are
received and cut off at 50K (look at the date/time received in the headers). 
This is another good reason to get the flame noise down to zero.

Personally, I think that the three brands that I have mentioned
come pretty close to achieving this, with the exception that
the St. Pauli Girls and Becks are green and the Dos Equis are
label-clingers and a little less sturdy.




    I don't have quite the perfect beer, but I have one that's
close.  The brand is Wisconsin Club, brewed by Huber, and availiable
in the upper midwest.  It has the following good points:


 - Sturdy dark brown bottles (12 oz bar bottles)


 - Labels come off so easily that the condensation on the outside of the
  bottle is often sufficient


 - CHEAP  (I've gotten it for $6/case!)


Main disadvantage is, as you might expect, the beer isn't that great.
But it's no worse than any other industrial swill, suitable for drinking
after mowing the lawn, etc.


Or, the TRUE perfect beer, by the preceding definition:  Homebrew!  :)

I hope that is Cranberry Lambic and not Cranberry Beer, and that is
Cranberry Lambic from 1990.  I tasted this year's Cranbery Beer on
draught, and it tastes like Samuel Adams Lager with cranberry juice
in it.  Bleechhh :-b  As you recall, last year I had their Cranberry
Lambic (and even their table cards called it a lambic) and it was 
great (make that GREAT :-) ).  A pink foamy head, the taste of fresh
soured milk and cranberries, and a deep red color.  This year, their
is little or no head, the color is a dull yellow/red/orange, it tastes
like someone added cranberry juice to the beer.  Actually, I tried 
that last year at home - added cranberry juice to beer - and it tasted
just like this year's catastrophe...  Even this year's table card says
it is a Cranberry Beer, brewed in the lambic style.  It's terrible :-p
When the waitress brought the beer, I gave her a look of surprise when
I saw the beer.  She said it was not as good as last year.  That was
an understatement if I ever heard one...


Sorry that you didn't get a chance to try their Cranberry Lambic - 1990
style.  Please pass along my sincerest regrets and condolences to
Samuel Adams on the passing away of a great brew...

This past weekend myself and five other members of our homebrew club
had the pleasure of attending a homebrew tasting with Michael Jackson
in Minneapolis. Michael did all of the homebrew tasting but we had
our hands full tasting all of the brewpub's beer. Sherlock's Home
had their own bitter, scottish ale, stout, porter, lager, pale ale, and
light on tap. They also had a sweet and dry cider on tap (imported).
We missed the winter warmer (xmas beer) by a week. They also feature a
number of single malt scotches. The ales were all hand-drawn in the
English style. All the beers I  sampled were very tasty. The brews
were $3 for a 20 oz. pint. Minnesota doesn't have a surplus of brewpubs
but this one is definitely worth trying.


The Beer Hunter was a cogenial and entertaining fellow. His talk and
comments on the homebrew were well recieved and he signed books for
a couple of hours. Does anyone know how this guy got his job and if he
needs an assistant?


I'm also dying to try a can of Guinness. Local distributors say it will
be a while before it makes to Minnesota, and even longer to Rochester.
I'll be in Chicago soon and hopefully I can find it there.

    I can recommend a type of bottle that fits this bill almost perfectly.  I
use IBC brand Root Beer bottles for much of my homebrew.  The bottles are
brown, sturdy, and have no labels at all on them from the start.  It costs less
than cheap beer and my 4-year-old son is all too glad to empty them for me.  I
have also seen A&W Root Beer in this type of bottle but have never used them.
This is excellent root beer too.  We used to say that IBC stood for "It's
Better'n Coke".  I bottled my last batch entirely in these bottles.

In my experience, bottles from the Whitbread Brewery in the UK (Whitbread
Ale, Mackeson's Stout) are gloriously heavy and thick, a rich dark brown in
color, and the labels peel off easily after twenty minutes of soaking in
hot water.  In addition, one of the beers (either the ale or the stout) never
seems to leave a moldy scum, so the first-time washing out is made much easier
as well.


The only real disadvantages are that the beers _are_ expensive, and that not
enough people around here have the class to drink the stuff, so when I buy
bottles from the package store there aren't many Whitbread bottles to be had.
But they fit all your other criteria.  If you decide to get a lot of Whit-
bread, I'll help you empty the bottles.  (:->)

I want to add my comments on the Homebrew Store and its owner Pat. My
only order from this store so far has been as a result of an add in
Zymergy for a 7.5 gallon SS pot. I called to order the pot, and Pat
talked me into buying a King Cooker and two beer kits too! Quite a
salesman, he is.


The whole deal cost me $150. I'm pretty happy with the stuff. The SS pot
is a little thin, but that's what I expected. The cooker really does the
job - it gets as hot as I feel comfortable with. The kits are high
quality. I got a partial mash S. German wheat beer (with the special
clove flavored yeast) and a full extract pale ale.


Prices are good. Pat likes to talk and has opinions on the 'best' way to
brew. He does seem to know of what he speaks.


The Homebrew Store doesn't take Visa. You have to mail your order in.
Pat says this keeps prices down. He could be right.

On the recent question about removing bottles labels.  I don't use TSP or

Any remaining glue then comes off easily with a plastic scrub pad.  I've

My personal favorite bottles are from Anchor. They are sturdy,
brown, filled with good beer, and the labels come off easily.
I guess the only drawback is that it's not a cheap beer, but 
then life's too short........


Many German beers come in those 1/2 liter bottles, which look like
miniature inverted cylindro-conical fermenters. They are a very 
handy size, since bottling 5 gallons requires only 35-40 of these,
instead of 50-55 12oz'ers. Some come with foil labels and are really
a drag to remove, the paper ones come off pretty easily however.
On the down side, these bottles often aren't accepted in competitions.


I've found that whatever nasty chemical I use to remove labels, it
gets easier if you use hot water. The glue softens more quickly at 
higher temps.

I can't recall the source (Maybe Mom told me ;-), but I remember hearing

smaller deposits so that people would still buy draft beer. The theory
being that $20 was enough to motivate people to return kegs because there
wasn't much else you could do with them anyway. Enter the homebrewer.

   stewed cabbage/vegetables.


2. There seems to be some confusion regarding malts.  One person

   *less* DMS potential vs continental malts.  George Fix specifically
   mentioned continental malts as having more sulpher compounds and gave
   me some pointers on how to reduce their influence (a: hops, b: keep

   the opposite direction.  Bottom line is that I plan on doing, not in
   the near future, two experiments:


   o re-do the klages pilsner and see if venting the kettle during
     the steeps (or eliminate the steep) does the trick.


   o Get some german pilsner malts and see if that does the trick.


   Given that the GWM pale malt is so cheap when purchased in bulk, I am
   somewhat motivated in trying to make it work. Actually trying to make
   Klages work might be futile: already my "german Pils" made with klages
   taste reminiscent of Bud.  Ack!

   that Diacytal is primarily a yeast byproduct (as apposed to DMS that
   can be produced by bacteria).  Anyone know if there are specific

Ale and Lager, although I prefer the Lager), I anxiously got the beer home and
waited for the perfect moment to drink the lambic.  Well, I wasn't impressed. 
In fact, the taste reminded me of what my mouth tastes like the morning after
having too much the night before.  What went wrong?  Is this a typical lambic? 
I also found the Lightship to be pretty watery (but then again it IS a light
beer).  Well, at least I got to enjoy the Ales and Lagers.


Cheers,
