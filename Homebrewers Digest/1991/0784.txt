They also have other goodies like restaurant-quality beer glasses and mugs, and lots of draft beer equipment and plumbing.  There is a 'stainless steel beer chiller' which is used to chill beer inline on its way to the draft arm which could be used as a wort chiller.  They also have CO2 tanks and regulators, etc.

Subject: Re-using Yeast


I need some expert opinion on re-using yeast.  Approximately a month
ago, I saved from my primary frementer two scoops of the dregs.
The yeast for this batch was Wyeast American Ale.  I put the dregs
into a sanitized plastic container.  I covered the dregs with a few
inches of fremented homebrew and stored it in the fridge.


The question is, will I be able to use this yeast for my next batch?
Should I use a low gravity starter to get the yeast active or can I
simply dump the contents into the chilled wort.  Would it be
worthwhile to seperate the trub from the yeast sediment?  I recall
reading a post in the HBD about this, but I was unsuccessful in
attempt to find it.  Does anyone remember the subject line or the
issue number?  What "things" should I look for, or smell, in able to
determine if it is infected.  Or has it been stored too long to reuse?


BTW, the yeast was used for an IPA and is planned to be pitched into a
brown ale.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: Pilsen Mash


On Decoction Mashing:


The following is from H. Lloyd Hind's Brewing Science & Practice, Volume II,
written in the 1930s, during a chapter on decoction mashing: "It is then heated
to the boiling point, again at the rate of about 1-1/2^F a minute, and boiled
for times which may vary from 1/4 hour for pale beers to 3/4 hour for dark, when
it is pumped back to the mash tun."


He specifically spells out the variant employed at Pilsen:


"Only two vessels are used, a combined mash and lauter tun and a copper. The
mash is made at the rate of 6 to 6.3 hectos per 100 kg. . . . to give a first
wort of 12.5 or about 1.050. The initial rise of temperature given for each mash
[below] is secured by pumping an appropriate proportion of the main mash from
the mash tun to the copper, where sufficient boiling liquor or boiling mash, as
the case may be, had been retained to give the required increase. The starred
figures represent temperatures in the mash tun. The others are temperatures in
the copper.

To Peter Gaspar: Gale's is available here in Oregon, for a good bit of money. It
may be in a pint bottle; think it's with standard crown cap. Hmm, on reflection
the bottle might be embossed. I will check if you want. I think it definitely
needs time in the bottle. Your 12 year old may be optimum. One I tasted was
definitely too young. Ooog.


To George Fix: Thanks for answering the call on sour mashes. I know about the
resilience of coliforms from working in a bacteriology lab in a food processing
plant. Some of the spinach we were testing had gone through the dryers (very,
very hot dryers) in clumps and the levels inside the clumps were astronomical.

Brian Capouch asks about sizes for the tubing in counterflow chillers...
Everyone I know who has used 1/4" tubing has regretted it.  They are just
too slow.  3/8" is better.  Now if you're into brewing fast, my
counterflow chiller is made using 25' of 1/2" tubing, and it will take
5 gallons of boiling wort down to 80 F in under five minutes.  My boiler
drains from the bottom - it might be difficult to start 1/2" as a
siphon.  For general guidelines, I'd say about 16-18' of 3/8".  Other
opinions?

Lots of good questions <grin>.


The Wyeast liquid yeast packets recommend a starter of 1.020 SG
wort.  No mention is made of hops, though.  I don't know of any
good reason to put hops in your starter, but there might be some.


If you use dry malt extract, such that 1 lb. in 1 gallon gives
1.040 SG, then a 1 pint starter would use:


        1 lb.                                     1

Well, I stopped using mine because there is no way to control
exactly how much beer gets in the bottle.  The volume taken up by
the filler itself leaves *way too much* headspace in the bottle.
So I have to top off each bottle separately from a small pitcher.
Way too much work.


Now if there was a bottle filler with a manual switch controlled
from the top, so I could fill the bottle as much as I wanted, it
would have the advantages of both systems.

Subject: Yeast herds, Berghoff Bock, Rambling


Frank Tutzauer's yeast culturing discussion got me thinking about this
concept of only using one or two "generations" of a particular strain to
avoid promulgating a bad characteristic or two.  Do this make sense?  You
actually have dozens, hundreds, thousands, of generations of the yeast in a
single batch, no?  I mean you start off with a small number of yeast cells
and by the time your beer is at full-krausen, you've got lots and lots,
right?  I'm not disputing the claim that one shouldn't keep reusing a batch
of yeast, I'm just curious about this.  Is a generation considered to be a
"herd" (MOO! :-) of yeast that hasn't gone dormant, therefore each time a
"herd" of yeast runs out of food, that is considered to be a "generation"?


Last night I picked up a six-pack of an American bock brewed by Berghoff.
They claim to brew in the old-world German style, blah, blah, blah.  The beer
was good, not great.  The only other beer I have to compare in that range is
Paulaner Salvator, a double bock.  The Salvator is clearly more alcoholic, as
I would expect, but it is also much smoother tasting.  The Berghoff has a
slightly unpleasant edge to it that I can't really put my finger on, except
to say that I've tasted other beers with it.  I don't think it is skunky,
although the beer is packaged in green bottles.  Have others tried this brew?
What was your impression?  I'm looking for a detailed description because I'm
trying to hone my beer evaluation skills a bit, and this is a bit of a
stumper for me.


Martin Lodahl's brewing woes amused me, but I can relate.  Believe me, I can
relate.  Kinney Baughman's Jim Koch gripes amused me, but I like the beer.  I
hear you Kinney, but I let it roll off like water on a duck's back, 'cause I
know its just marketing (something close to lawyering).


I'd also be willing to pick up the digest on rec.crafts.brewing if that's
what it takes.  Good plan, Fritz.

In yesterdays posting regarding a pasta maker into grain mill, I wrote:


>Put in some grain and try out your new rolling mill.  Iterate on the grinding

This should say: "Test the mill with some grain.  Use a gap appropriate for
your grain.  If the grain fails to be forced between the rollers, go back 
and resurface the rollers until you have a rougher texture.  Continue this 
process as necessary."


You will have good cracking with only one pass (not iteratively as the first
posting seemed to say).  Accept no substitutes.

While shopping for cookware gifts yesterday, I found a mill that grinds using
three grooved rollers with an adjustable spacing.  The rollers are about 4"
in length and located at the vertices of an inverted triangle.  The retail
price ( which this establishment sells at ) was around $80.  A bit pricey
compared to a Corona, but much better than $200 for a homemade one.  I think
the manufacturer is Mikasa or something that sounds similar.

All the above intuitions are correct.  In fact I shared them when I 
designed the first version of the counter-flow chiller that I sell.  I 
chose 5/16" OD tubing for that model.  95% of the time it works fine.  
It's a little slower on the siphon (`at` 30 minutes) but very efficient.  
However, it's too efficient for big, high gravity brews and the cold-
break is so pronounced that some people complained that it clogged the 
siphon.  Two years ago I switched to using 3/8" tubing.  With a strong 
water flow it works fine.  From my kitchen sink, I found that on the 
average the water exiting the chiller was about 10 degrees warmer than 
the smaller pipe.  If the wort coming out is too warm there are two 
things you can do.  (1)  Use a pinch clamp on the end of the exit hose 
to slow down the flow of wort.  (2) Try to connect to an outside 
faucet. The outside faucet at my house generates about three times the 
flow of water than does my kitchen sink.  No one has yet to complain 
of a clogged chiller with the larger tubing, BTW. 


The other thing to remember is to keep the water housing of the 
chiller as small as possible.  Heat exchangers are more efficient the 
more the coolant turns over.


Tom Dimock observes:


>On roller mills  -  the reference in HBD 780 to building a roller
>mill using the rollers from a grocery store checkout came from a
>small book on building your own brewery.  


That's Bill Owens' book, _How to Build a Small Brewery_.  It's still 
being published.  Overall a good book.  And at $5.00 or so, a good 
value for the info.


>In doing some serious "wetware simulations" (i.e. kicking back with
>a homebrew and thinking about it), I came up with several unknowns.


Your allusion to 'wetware' caused me to think about the possibility of 
using the pasta machine as a wet-mill roller.  Wet-mills are touted as 
the best possible solution to the mill problem.  They crush the 
grains while generating absolutely no powder.  Conjecture tells me 
that the wet grains would be 'tackier' and would pass through the 
smoother rollers of the pasta machine.  That could save roughing up 
the rollers so that the machine could still serve that function.  It's 
probably easier on the machine anyway. 


OK you kitchen tinkerers.  Get to it and try it out.  I don't have a 
pasta maker (yet).  After some homemade lasagna at a friends house a 
month ago using her own pasta, I admit to thoughts of purchasing one.  
Now if it can double as a wet-mill roller.......

Well, I thought it was good logic too but I was wrong.  I made a wort chiller
from 1/4" tubing immersed in ice water.  It worked great as far as cooling the 
wort goes, but it had several other problems, namely the throughput was way too
slow and on top of that it clogged.  It took about an hour to cool the first
3 or so gallons of a 5 gallon batch.  At that point the thing clogged and I had
to run some boiling water through to clean the clog and finish the cooling.  


A slow throughput is one thing but over an hour is too long for me.  I tried 
increasing the flow by raising the bucket (I sat it on top of the fridge)
but that didn't help much.  I am going to do one of two things to solve this
problem, either shorten the length of my current copper coil or go out and buy
some bigger stuff, I havn't decided yet which is better.  From feeling the wort
coller as it is now, the wort seemed to be cool about half way through the tubing
so I can probably cut down the length by about 1/3 (it is about 30' now I think).
This should increase the flow by 50% if I remember correctly. Of course to solve the
clogging problem, I may keep the length and go to the 3/8 tube.  Or as a third 
alternative I could cut the tube I have now in half a connect a Y to it.  This 
should double the flow.  Actually if I could remember all the fluid dynamics 
and thermodynamics I learned in college I could figure out exactly how long and 
how big my tube needs to be, but that is too much work so I will just guess.

I have just recently received a 'trippel Cosendonk' belgian ale 'Brewed and
Bottled by Brewery du Bonq, for Brewery Consendonk, Oud-Turnout, Belgium.'


I have not consumed this ale yet, intrigued by the idea of culturing the
yeast visible in the bottom of the bottle. Does anyone know about either
of these breweries or the beer itself?  Do they practice the deception of 
using a different yeast to bottle with than to ferment with, like some....
Or is the yeast the original and makes a fantastic trippel??

Mash in at 10pm (or whenever it gets quiet).  Caffeine is optional.
Actually I have only tried this once, but it was a remarkable

Subject: Phil's Philler -- review




Since there have been some questions about bottle fillers on the Digest,
I thot' I'd throw in my two cents worth.


I've always bottled with a bottling bucket, with a spigot attached (no
stopped siphonings for me!) and a length of 3/8" dia. tubing leading to the
bottles.  After two batches of this setup, having to pinch the hose and
dribble beer all over the floor between bottles was getting to me, and I
wanted a filler.
  The brew store had a Phil's Philler, which is a brass mechanism about the
twelve inches when collapsed, and an additional half inch when extended.
The wide end (containing, I suspect, the valve) fits inside a 3/8" tube
very snugly; no problems with slippage.  The wide end is 3" long.  The narrow
part has a bevelled end and the tubing is thin.  When the mechanism is
fully extended, a pinhole can be seen in the narrow tube just before it
meets the wide tube.
  After the bottling setup is prepared, the philler is inserted in a bottle
and pressed against the bottom (there are about 2-3" of the filler over the
height of a 12 oz. bottle; I've used it with 28 oz. bottles with no
trouble, however).  The bevelled edge keeps the beer from damming up; the 
beer swirls around and fills the bottle with very little bubbling.  The
philler can be held at various positions between fully open (compressed) and
fully closed (extended) and regulate the flow of beer; helpful during the
end of the fill when the beer is going up the neck.
  The niftiest part of the mechanism is as follows: when the fill is complete,
you simply remove the philler, and the beer remains at the level it was
while the philler was in.  This is because the valve is above the fill line,
and the pinhole is an air bleed, thus the beer inside the tube inside the
bottle remains when the philler is removed; the only displacement is the 
volume of the metal and not its contents.  Brilliant.
  Now for the downside.  Despite claims that the mechanism is stickproof, I've
overfilled my share of bottles when gravity could not overcome stiction.
(a small spring would help immensely, but would probably increase the price
a great deal).  An interim solution I've found is to use two hands, one
on the large tube and one on the small.  This is less work than trying to
pinch off a siphon tube and aim for the next bottle, but is hard on the knees
if your bucket is on the table and your bottles are on the ground.  A bit
of practice is necessary to get a consistent fill level on all your bottles,
and if the flow is stopped before the bottle is full, a surge of air will
percolate through the bottle.  (I've found this to be not much, tho' it is
annoying).  Lastly, this gadget retails for $9.00 or so.  I wouldn't have
paid that much for it, but I would pay $4.00.
  It has speeded up -- and even more importantly, made neater -- my bottling
procedure by a great deal.  I'm glad I have it.

equals $4.00 paid.  :->

Next time on Phinney Ridge, try the 74th St. Ale House at 74th & Greenwood.
They have numerous micros on tap and an occasional cider.  It's a good
fallback if the Trolleyman is full.

I've been using this method for 4-5 years now, and have found that 
although CP's formula has its limitations, it's pretty good.  As I 
recall (if brewing books were at here at work, I'd never get anything 
done!), the amount of gyle suggested is directly proportional to the 
amount of green beer, and inversely proportional to the OG of the gyle.
It works out to 48oz of 1.040 gyle in 5 gallons. If the gravity goes
up to 1.080, the quantity drops to 24oz.


Now, what this formula fails to account for, is that not all 1.040
worts are created equal. The ratio of fermentables to nonfermentables
varies considerably, and thus the amount of carbonation varies also.


If one were so inclined, a formula could be developed based on both
OG (original gravity) and TG (terminal gravity), which gets around
this problem, but has some of its own. To determine the amount of gyle
to hold back for priming, you'd have to be able to predict the TG
beforehand (difficult, especially if it's a new recipe), or hold back
extra and only use what's called for after measuring the TG (read
wasted beer!). Based on all of that, I've been content to use CP's
numbers with an adjustment to account for the fact that my worts are 
typically very rich in unfermentables (mash temps ~158F).


Another consideration is that beers primed with gyle generally take
longer to carbonate than those primed with sugar. Regarding Andy's
problem, it could be that all that is required is a little more time.
I've got some questions :


        1. How long has the beer been in the bottle???


        2. What was the final yield???


        3. What proportion of the wort sugars came from the 
        extract vs. the mash???


        4. What was the mash temp?


All of these factors will influence the CO2 level. If I had to 
venture a guess, I'd suspect that time is the most likely. Perhaps 
waiting another week or two will solve the problem.


Cheers,

Hi folks,
   My fiance loves the smell of making beer. I tend to do it on a weekend day
when he has to work, because he invariably comes over (just when the pot is
starting to boil over), unbraids my hair and plays with it (over the cooking
proto-beer, and I shed lots :( ) and does nuzzly things while telling me how
wonderful I am to make him beer. While this is going on, the pot boils over,
and I smack him good. When he comes home and beer has been made in his absence,
(my preferred course of action) he bounds across the room exclaiming my virtues
to the skies, and says how great it is to come home to the smell of home cooked
beer.
   When I lived in Williamsburg, VA, we could smell the Anheuser-Busch folks
making beer, and after people figured out what it was they just said, "oh,
Busch is making beer. Hey, maybe we should go over to Busch (gardens) tomorrow
for the free tour. We can ride the monorail and see THE RUMBLE OF HOOFBEATS THE
RATTLE OF CHAINS again." No one ever said it smelled bad. We always associated
the smell with free beer.

Has anyone used the KitchenAid grain mill?  I have never seen it
and I wonder whether it cuts our mustard.


Also, the diagrams I have seen of professional roller mills have
three sets of rollers.  Each successive set has a smaller gap
between the rollers.  


My guess is that the three roller set design improves the
throughput of the mill more than it defines final crush quality.
Further, I guess is that if we homebrewers are willing to let
crushing take a little longer per pound, a pasta maker with
roughed up rollers could be just the ticket.  Now to motorize it...


Does anybody know differently?

Bottling wands are discussed occasionally.  Usually, however, not until
someone has a problem with bottling.  I would not bottle without one --
they are great.  On the one that I have, the gizmo at the end is orange
and contains a spring to shut off the flow.  I intend to bottle (instead
of kegging) the batch currently in the primary since it is a
ginger/orange/cinnamon/nutmeg ale and not for everyday consumption.  I

The SA that we get on the West Coast is brewed in Portland (That's 
Oregon, not Maine, silly), by the Blitz-Weinhard Brewery. When I 
toured that brewery in July, the generally uninformed tourguide
claimed he knew nothing of this, which was consistent. When I 
mentioned it to the two guys serving in the hospitality room, their 
eyes got wide and they started whispering as if it were some well 
kept secret that I had just divulged. They eventually admitted that 
SA was made there, but said they had been instructed not to talk about 
it. Since Jim Koch admits that SA is contract brewed, I could only 
conclude that BW didn't want their loyal fans to know that they were 
making "Boston" Lager.

Ok Jackaroo! I'll tell you what I thought of "THE VIDEO". I'll even
tell everyone on the net, so hold onto your shorts, cause here we go!


While visiting a friend to whom you sent a sample, we drank some exceptional
homebrew, and watched your video. So...


The video as a whole to approach a first attempt at brewing is good. It in 
fact kinda parralleled my first expierience. I think it would be helpful to
get a first time brewer off the ground. But now, syrup and sugar, yuck!


The overall flow was good, as were the cute little light signs you used to 
tell times and ingredient measurements.


However, here are a few things I noticed that you might want to change.


Get rid of the fruit flies! The "By the way, those are fruit flies" sure didn't
do much to reinforce the first rule, sanitation. 


I don't know about other brewers, but I stay away from wooden spoons, as is 
seen in the video. A stainless steel spoon, or even plastic would be better.
Who knows what is hiding in the porous wood!


Clean your stove. It looked like somebody had cooked a splattering hambuger
before you decided to brew.


You should make your kitchen look like one of those TV cooking shows.
The only thing visible in the kitchen should be brewing stuff. Especially
inside the refridgerator. Unless maybe you want to show some beer time
munchies next to the beer...


Lose the advertisement for that Baderbrau stuff. I've never seen the stuff
before, and didn't care for the big advertising spot, even if everyone does
have thier price. A quik tour was fun, but not the big ad.


To sanitize the bottles, did I miss something? The only part I remember was
in the rootbeer part, where Marilyn poured the solution from bottle to bottle.
Isn't it better to soak those bottles to insure sanitation??? Did I miss
something when I checked the barbeque???


So, are these flames? No, they're just a few minor recomendations. Were the
flame wars justified? Yes and no. It is hard to visualize exactly what is
going on across a keyboard. I think many flames would only have beed sparks,
had the video been viewed.


Jack, I'll give you a fairly solid "B". It was good, and would prove helpful
to a new brewer. But, there are odds and ends that need tying up. Your working
on citizenship now, so we'll give you a "Acceptable" in that catagory :-)

Yes.  Plain and simple.  Since you aren't mashing, you don't have to
worry about pH, minerals, etc.  Some might say: "Hey!  If you're making
a Burton Ale, don't you want to make your water have the same mineral
profile as the wells in the Trent river valley?"  Well, yes and no...
it depends.  It depends on your extract.  If you have an extract that
was made in Burton upon Trent, I suspect that they did not remove any
of the minerals prior to making the wort that became the extract.  When
they evaporated away the water, they left behind the minerals.  The
minerals should still be in the extract.  However, one of my favorite
extracts, the one I use for my favorite Bitter, is Munton & Fison Old Ale
Kit.  But when I use a can of this extract and add 1.5 to 3 lbs of light
dried extract, plus some boiling hops and dryhops, I add 1/3 oz Burton Water
Salts from Wines Inc. to my 5 gal of relatively soft Chicago water.
Oops... I forgot to mention the Brewer's Choice British Ale yeast from 
Wyeast Labs (#1028, I believe).  I'm slowly approaching what I remember
of the Ales I drank on tap in England, but my memory is fading and
getting clouded by the bottled versions I get here.  The bottom line is,
you can use distilled water for extract brewing, but you may want to
optionally add minerals to taste.

I called my water dept when I lived in Hickory Hills, IL and asked for
"the latest water analysis report."  They sent me one within a few days.
It contained everything I had expected -- all the minerals, etc.  When
I moved to Palos Hills, IL (the next suburb south of Hickory Hills),
I did the same, but got a different animal entirely.  What they sent
me was six or so bacterial counts.  Not what I had expected.  I haven't
tried again, explaining that I want mineral concentrations.


Hmmm... <dialing>... Hello? ....


Well, I just got around to it.  The lady at the water department wasn't
sure, so she transferred me to the Palos Hills Commissioner of Public Works!
Imagine that!  As soon as I said "mineral content,"  he said  "oh, yeah --
you want a Chicago water analysis."  I asked if that will be just like
the water out of the tap in Palos and he said yes.  After a few minutes
of discussion, I found out that Hickory Hills used to blend Chicago and
well water.  I had noticed that some months the water would stain the
sink and on other months it would not.  That explains that.  So when you
talk to your Water Dept rep, ask if your water is blended and if the
ratio changes from month to month.


The Commish said I should get the analysis in a day or two.

I have used, and continue to use, the yeast bank. I find it pretty easy,
and the thawed yeast can be built up into a viable culture. Be warned
that the yeast seems somewhat weak upon thawing. I suspect that many
cells are killed by this process. However, once you have built up a few
of them they work just as well as the original batch.


The process that seems to work best for me involves using three stages
of starter - two tablespoons, 0.5 cup, and .75 quart. This takes four or
five days from thawing the yeast until it is ready to pitch.


I found that the original five test tubes were not enough - buy extras.
I like to keep five tubes of each yeast type. 


I have a batch of lager going in my garage as I type this. The yeast is
about six months old, Bavarian Lager. I expect it to turn out well!

get the pasta maker for Xmas one year, use it once, put it away, get the
motor for Xmas the next year, and actually use the thing about 10-20
times til you get bored!).  Seriously, tho.  The motor drive works
great, and saves muchos sore shoulders if you are a wimp.
