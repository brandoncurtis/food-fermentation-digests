>From what I have gathered from soc.culture.nordic (in the evil Usenet world),
brewing is completely legal in Sweden, and quite popular because of:
1 - Cost - Beer is so heavily taxed (a morality and socialism thing) that one
           beer in a bar can cost you US$7...


2 - Variety - Beer strength is limited (that morality thing again)...


I do not know of supply houses there, but according to Zymurgy, Vol. 14, N0. 5,
(Winter 1991), a club does exist. Contact:

Subject: New (in several ways) WYeast!!!


I went this past saturday to Chicago INdoor Garden Supply, my vote for
Chicagoland's best homebrew store, and purchased some yeast.  In the WYeast bin
they had several new looking packages. I picked up & later purchased the Pilsen
lager...  The package is still gold foil, but there is no longer any sticker on
it, instead information is printed directly on the package on both sides...  AS
I scrupulously studied the package, I noticed the packing date - Jan 1 1992!
Three days old!  This thing'll probably explode in my hand when I crack the
inner seal this weekend...


Also, I notice a couple different Wyeasts I had never seen before, one was
champagne yeast, but I can't remember the other... how long have they marketed
the champagne?

Mike sez:

I felt it worth pointing out that this is indeed an extreme case.  I'm 
not sure where Mike bought his copper but the tubing I buy from the 
local plumbing supply never has anything remotely similar to the stuff 
Mike describes.                                      


>contortions related to cleaning the copper deleted<


 ..an admiral tale of perseverance, Mike!

I usually follow this procedure with a quick siphon of my clorox 
solution and store dry.  The little bit of clorox will help insure 
sterilization but it's not enough to cause any appreciable corrosion.  
In fact I used to store my chillers with a clorox solution inside them 
from one brewing session to the next and the chiller held up fine.


When I pull out my chiller for the next session, I boil up about a 
gallon of water and siphon it through the dry chiller to insure 
sterilization prior to taking the wort through it.


Jim asks:

>Then run the necessary amount of 170-180 F water through the same grain bed
>and cheesecloth, (again just once), to make 6 gals.... and be done with it.
>It'd take minutes, rather then 1-2 hours.


I'm all with you on this one, Jim.  I usually re-cycle once just to 
set the grain bed.  Then I drain the lauter tun completely to get the 
thickest runnings out of there.  After that, I run a normal sparge 
until 6 gallons are collected.  45 minutes.  No reason to take 1-2 
hours.

 Someone posted calculations for the amount of water to get to 
 a specific strike temperature. YOu forgot to include the specific heat of
 the malt, and water. Although I forget the exact formula, and values, it 
 is needed if you rare going to do this. A friend and I tried to set up
 a spread sheet so we could do infusion mashes directly by calculations
 This included measuring the specific heat of malt in a calorimeter (thermos).
 Off we went brewing, and although the first step was OK, subsequent 
 steps always required corrections. After several experiments, and careful
 checking of our caluculations and formulas, we concluded that the 
 specific heat of the malt must change  as it is mashed. THis makes sense
 given the dramatic change in the malt, but still makes us unsure on 
 where the heat goes as the specific heat changes. I'll see if I can dig
 up our formula (out of the CRC handbook), and the values we measured
 for specific heat of dry malt. If you are only going to do a single step,
 it should work OK.


 Joining CAMRA with Pounds Sterling? Why not join Camra Canada? Then you could 
 pay in Loonies Bronze? I don't know the address, I'll see if I can get it?
 Also you can write a check in any currency. All you have to do is mark the
 currency on the cheque. At least I can at my bank. NOTE: they do charge a 
 service charge for clearing a cheque in a foreign currency. 


 What is Klages Malt. I bought a kilo the other day, and can't find any
 info on what it is?


 Butterscotch flavor, and Diacytl: YOu can increase diacytl in you beer two ways
 Low oxygen wort at pitching will tend to cause the yeast to produce more 
 diacytl. Boiling all your water will cause low low oxygen wort.
 Most yeasts create diacytl as an intermediate fermentation product,and later
 re-metabolize it, If you strip the yeast out early in the fermentation,
 by cold shocking it, or adding finings before racking to secondary.
 you will preserve this diacytl. Although the subsequent fermentations 
 will go a little slower, You won't have problems with carbonation.
 At least I never have. I have been using these methods to 
 produce buttery english ales ala Samuel Smith for years.

Here is an example of the spread sheet for calculating infusion step
mash water additions.
For the first single step mash, the formula is
Mnw=        (Tf-Ts)(SHg*Mg+HCtun)/(Tnw-Tf)*SHw


Where Mnw is mass of water to add kg (1 litre= 1 kg)
      Tf is desired final temp  C
            Ts is original grain temp C
      SHg is specific heat of grain joules/kg C
      Mg is mass of grain kg
      SHw is specific heat of waterJoules/kg C
      Tnw is temp of water to be added C
      HCtun is heat capacity of mash tun (ignore. Preheat tun)
NOTE:all are metric SI units. "what is that in real gallons?"

Subject: Mead, Nutrients, Germany


Greetings all,
    Got some questions for ya's.   First, I've tried to make a mead.  I pretty
much followed Papazians new appendix on making mead.  My 3 Gallon batch had:


              5 kilos Imker honig (trans: 11 lbs beekeeper honey)
              48 oz red Raspberries
              1/2 tsp Irish Moss
              Champagne Yeast in starter of 
                        1/2 cup Corn Sugar
                        1 tsp Yeast Nutrient
                        1 cup H2O


   I boiled the honey in 1 gallon H2O, turned off the heat, added the rasp-
berries, let steep for about 30 minutes, then dumped all into a plastic primary
and brought total volume to 3 gallons.  OG was (eek!) 1.142!!  So, I pitched
the yeast the next morning and let it go.  Last night, (5 days later) I racked 
to a glass secondary w/ an addition couple tsps. of nutrient dissolved in a cup
of H2O, grav = 1.080.  


   Now for the problem.  This stuff smelled like baby larks bladders 
boiled in ox bile.  I mean it was downright NASTY smellin'.  I couldn't bring 
myself to even attempt tasting it.  I asked my wife (who normally doesn't like
homebrews) to help describe the smell.  Funny part is, she couldn't smell any-
thing but a slight raspberry odor.  She promptly drank my sample and proclaimed
"Yum, Fruit Punch with a kick!!," and left.  I was amazed.  Has this ever 
happened to anyone else?  Am I having some sort of olefactory hallucination?


   Second, the yeast nutrient I got is labeled DiAmmonium Phoshate, but
w/o any instructions.  So how much should I use for, oh, say a mead?  Would
this have some have any affect on my nasel imagination??


In HBD #796, Jim Grady ask about homebrew distributers in Germany:
   Yeah Jim, I'm in Germany.  I'm sorry to report that I haven't found any
distributers, nor have I confirmed the legality of homebrewing.  I'll be taking a tour the the BBK (Bavarian Brewery of Kaiserslautern) on 29 Jan, so I may
have more info then.  I'll be sure to post a review...

How about good evidence that it does... to the tune of about 13 gallons of
beer and mead?  We started brewing about this time last year, and made
three decent batches of beer in a couple of months.  We never bothered
boiling all our water, using cold tap water to top off our extract
brews.  No problem.


As spring set in, we brewed a pale ale.  It was very nice when we bottled
it, by far our best effort, so we quickly followed it up with another batch
and, while we were cooking, a batch of mead.  About 2 weeks later, we
noticed a slight plastic flavor and smell to our beer, which within a week 
or two became so strong that the beer was undrinkable.  Chlorophenols, 
we figured.  Had to toss about three gallons of that wonderful elixir.


Then when it came time to bottle the pale ale and mead we'd just brewed, we
found the same stench already developed.  Scratch ten more gallons.


Our reasoning was that the spring had brought with it a bacteria bloom, and
the water treatment plant had countered by upping the chlorine levels.  As
a result, our beers suddenly contained much more chlorine and, perhaps,
some new bacteria; a good recipe for chlorophenols.  It's worth noting
that our second and third batches, brewed before our first plastic pale
ale, never developed this problem even after more than 9 months had passed
in the bottle.


We now religiously boil our water (we even have it blessed! 8-) and have
not had a recurrence of this tragedy.

To my knowledge, nothing... but then again, there's a lot of difference
between what's acceptable for household water and beer.  Your water doesn't
require sanitized conditions, so little bacteria-harboring pockets of
grease wouldn't matter.  Grease/oil that may be insoluble in tap water
might be more soluble in hot wort.  You don't expect a glass of water to
maintain a nice head.  You don't fuss with water for hours, store it for
weeks, then bottle it in individual 12-oz bottles and give it to friends.

I boil our local tap water because it is FULL of bicarbonate, which buffers 
mash pH. I get a heaped teaspoonful of scum, sediment and precipitate after 
a 15 minute boil. The amount of precipitate varies with the length of boil 
and I have found it is possible to overdo it, resulting in a mash pH which 
is too low. Now I just boil for 5 minutes and no more.


Incidentally, another interesting experiment worth trying is to taste a 
series samples taken throught the brewing process. Taste a bit of wort 
every half hour during mash and boil, and then each day for the first week 
of fermentation. and weekly thereafter. It's instructive and fasinating to 
discover just how the character of your brew shifts as it passes though its 
various stages. It shows you just when and in what way the important changes 
occur; where you are wasting time with an unncecessary wait; when you may be 
spoiling the flavour by underdoing or overdoing something.  Your tastebuds 
will reveal things no amount of technical apparatus can show. It was a 
surprise to me, for example, just how much sparging washes out the flavour 
of the wort (one day I MUST try fermenting a full strength batch, WOW!!!).

it back then. Mine didn't claim to prevent boil-overs, only that it would
automatically stir the contents. As such, it works on low viscosity liquids
like wort, but not heavy sauces. I used it when I made batches on my electric
stove and it prevented the wort from being scorched every time. It did not
produce enough of a stirring motion to prevent a boilover, but it was useful
for overcoming the effects of electric stove hot-spots.


Since I started brewing outside with a King Kooker rocket engine, the baffle
on the unit seems to prevent hot spots on the kettle and the pyrex ashtray is
no longer being used.

Subject: sour mash


  I'd like to share my sour mashing experiences with the list, so others
will not repeat my mistakes.


  I used papazian's method of cooling the mash to 130F, and adding some
cracked malt.  


  My first attempt did not sour at all for about 12 hours.  At that time,
i mucked about in it, and uncovered it.  The next morning, it had a white
film, and smelled like rotting corn.  I covered it with saran wrap,
and let it continue.  It got really nasty, and rancid.  the rotting corn
smell made you retch.  I dumped it.  In retrospect, it might have been
fine.


  I have seen conflicting opinions on this question:  ARE THE SOURING
BACTERIA AEROBIC?  If not, cover the mash, if so, leave it uncovered.


  BTW:  I was using wheat malt from great fermentations, and pale
2-row from Minnesota malting.  I think the mash was 2# wheat malt,
5# pale, 1# barley flakes.


  with the same mash, i tried again.  this time i added some
acidopholis capsules, and covered.  the capsules were crom barley
malt culture (great for us lactose sensitive people) obtained
at the health food store.  This time i covered the mash.
After two days the mash pH dropped to about 3.4, and it smelled
only slightly rancid.  I boiled 90 min.  The finished product
is sharply acidic, but with a hint of remaining rancid flavor.
I think that this Lactobacillus Acidopholis contributes this
rancid character which is not driven off in the boil.


  How will sulpher levels effect the souring?  How much sulpher
does Minnesota malting use?  Not only did the first mash smell
sulphery, but the second mash gave me hints of sulpher too.
On the second mash, i goofed and charred a bit of malt.  This
scorching produced not just your usual burning food smell,
but definite sulpher overtones.  In fact, the sulpher smell
was stronger than the burnt food smell.  Does all scorched
malt produce this smell? (this was the first time i schorched malt)


  Bob Jones : could you ask Micah Millspaw how much of the mash he
soured, and how much he did regular?  with that information i can try
M. Millspaw's technique outlined in HBD 796.


   Aaron (I'm gonna emulate berliner weisse even if it kills me) Birenboim


P.S.  Anybody know where I can get a buttermilk starter culture?  Martin
      Lohdal tasted a nice Berliner Weisse emulation made by pitching
      buttermilk starter with the yeast.  I's sure like to avoid that 
      stinky sour mash!

As I understand it the grant serves two purposes:


1 It provides a handy place to grab a sample during run-off to determine
clarity.


2 It allows the brewer to balance the flow of wort during run-off. 
I think if the flow is uneven there is a risk of part of the mash compacting
and getting stuck, causing a loss in efficiency.


At Boulder Beer I recall that they have a series of pipes, each with a valve
and a gauge.


A friend of mine peeked behind the grant at Anchor and said that all
the taps were connected to the same pipe.

Ok.  If I do decide that I want to boil my tap water to rid it of chlorine,
bacteria, etc. how long should I boil it?  I would suppose that it would be long
enough to rid the water of the nasty stuff, but not so long that any minerals in
the water become concentrated too much from the reduced volume.  What would
therefore be the acceptable range?

I've been skimming the pre-boil scum for years and I've detected no

you'll find it to be quite astringent--another reason I'm happy to have 
it out of there.

Looks like it's time to post my usual warning about blowing off 
through siphon hose.  ***DON'T DO IT***  It's dangerous.  If you're 
blowing off using a right-side up carboy, use the 1" ID siphon hose.  
For those interested in the upside-down system, the BrewCap uses 1/2" 
hose and we've found that to be as small as you can go and still be 
safe.  No one's ever blown a carboy with the BrewCap. 


And lastly, some feedback for you guys who rely on word-wrap on your

By any chance, was Oz's blowoff tube a simple 3/8" siphon hose?
I haven't read Papazian's New CJoHB, but in the first issue he
recommended a regular siphon hose for a blowoff tube.  I had a
similar misforture as Oz, but luckily only my stopper blew.  There
was beer dripping from the ceiling in the aftermath and only 2 of 5
gallons left in the carboy.  Since then I switched to a 5/8" OD --
1/2" ID hose and have had no problems.  You can even use a 1.125"
hose right in the neck of the carboy (no stopper).

I checked the Troubleshooting issue of Zymurgy and found nothing that
you could have done wrong in the table or the section on Metallic taste.
It could be your water, but as I wrote recently, if you're used to the
taste of the water, you shouldn't be that sensitive to that taste in the
beer.  Get a water analysis and check the Iron content.  The Troubleshooting
issue did, however, mention that two constituents (1-octen-3-One and
1,5-Octadien-2-one) have the source "Lipids from malt or brewing adjuncts
such as rice, corn, etc."  This would be the fault of the extract manufacturer.
What brand was it?  Maybe other Digesters have had problems with this
extract?

Subject: Samuel Smith's CORRECTION


Recently, I posted a discussion of fermenter dimensions in which I
said that the shape (actually, the shallowness) of the fermenters
used by Samuel Smith's Tadcaster Brewery causes an increase in the
production of diacetyl.  I had read this somewhere a while ago and
I'm not sure if the dimensions of the fermenter have anything to do
with diacetyl production.


Yesterday, I received my copy of Terry Foster's "Pale Ale" from the
AHA.  I immediately checked the fermenters used in Tadcaster and
sure enough, nothing is mentioned about dimensions.  I hope Terry
forgives me for quoting one paragraph, but I'm certain that
any serious Pale Ale brewer will eventually buy this book anyway
- -- I love it!  Here's what Terry writes on pp. 20-21:


"        Yorkshire brewers in another important pale are brewing center,
Tadcaster, had a different type of yeast and developed their own technique
for handling it.  This was the Yorkshire Stone Square System.  It is a
circulating system like the Burton Union System, but with a very different
purpose.  Circulation in the Unions is designed to acheive good separation
of a poor-settling yeast from the beer.  The Yorkshire brewers had a highly
flocculent yeast which would rapidly settle out, giving poor attenuation
in traditional "rounds."  So the Stone Square circulation system was 
designed to continually rouse the fermenting wort, keeping the yeast
in suspension until full attenuationhad been achieved.  A side effect of
using such yeasts is that the beer may have high levels of diacetyl; the
resulting "butterscotch" flavor is often an accepted characteristic of
beers brewed in this way.  Incidently, in the British hombrewing revival
of the 1960's and 70's, such rousing was mistakenly assumed to be essential
for all yeasts and recipes often recommended rousing the wort twice daily.
Not only is this usually unnecessary, it is also an excellent way of starting
bacterial infections!"


In the associated picture of the "Slate tanks of the Yorkshire Stone Square
system," the tanks appear to be about 8' by 8' and (if the brewer in the
picture is not on a ladder) about 4' high.

I always understood these things "worked" by making a hellatious noise
that tells you when the pot is just starting to boil (clatter clatter).
Then you come running and turn down the heat or dump in cold water or
whatever.  Do the instructions give any clue about this?  I can't think
of any reason why a glass disk would inhibit foaming.

As I've stated in this forum before, I use a 7-gallon carboy and fermentation
lock as my primary fermenter.  I don't worry about blowoff or blowoff hoses
or the associated problems with plugged hoses, because of the considerable
gap between my 5 gallons of wort and the top of the carboy.


Well, Dave Ballard's little fairy tale got me to thinking (sometimes I needs
a jump start).  If, during high kraeusen, my wort scum did actually rise
enough to find its way into the f-lock (and somehow plugging it), I'd be in
deep doo-doo like our buddy Oz was.


Now, since deep doo-doo is not the desired effect, I have a question:


CO2 is heavier than O2 right?  So, if I was to put my stopper (with f-lock,
or blowoff hose for that matter) on a bit loosely, and pressure did find a
way to build up, the stopper would simply fly off.  In the normal case, where
this did not happen, O2 would not find its way into my carboy, would it?
(OK, I lied - two questions).  Assuming all this is true, even if the stopper
took a trip toward the ceiling, CO2 would still blanket the brew and protect
it.


For safety sake, I'll use a very light touch on my next batch, unless
someone comes up with a good reason against.  Comments?

Hello,


Has anyone every tried Northwestern Brand malt extract?  The syrup is packaged
in plastic bags inside a cardboard box.  My local homebrew supply shop has 
3.3lbs hopped bags for a reasonable $7.95.  I was considering buying their 
Weizen extract for my next batch.

book for christmas, hoping to get him started and get me lots of
homebrew.  but he can't seem to get past chapter 2, where it tells
him to go to the refrigerator and get a beer!!  how do i get him
past this part and on to making me beer??  :-)

since I'm considering making a recirculating infusion mash system with a
pump to transfer to the boiler: should I be concerned?  How did you 
redesign?  Just a simple gravity feed or was there more to it than that?
The basic ideas of my design are below.  Any comments are appreciated.


Vessels:  1/2 of a stainless steel drum, ~27.5 gallons with a false bottom
                (perf. stainless 30% open, 1/8" holes) resting on a stainless
                angle iron X.  1/2" stainless steel nipple mig welded 1"
                up from the base of the vessel  (affectionately known as
                the mash-tun from hell -- currently sitting in my hallway)
        (probably) two 15.5gal kegs welded one on top of the other.
            (cut the top off one, the bottom off the other, step a lip
            into one and weld.  1/2" nipple in the bottom from transfer
            both in and out.  I have yet to make this one.


The mash tun (1/2 drum) will have a pump attached to its nipple.  This
will pump to a set of valves which either directs the flow through a tube
flash heater or to the boiler nipple.  If the flow is through the heater
it is then directed to a set of nipples up the side of the drum.  Only
one of these will be open.  This will allow the recirculation to occur at
the highest level possible without going over the top of the mash.  These
nipples will be on the opposite side of the vessel so flow must be across the
grain.  I do plan to do a lot of stirring to distribute the heat.  Heater
control will be via a little bit of techie wizardy -- a microcomputer
which will control both flow as well as clip the AC to the heater.


The boiler, two kegs welded together, will have at least one hot water
heater affixed to the bottom a la a *big* BrewHeat.  Yes, I know some
people believe this will lead to scorching, but I havn't had such a problem
with the BrewHeat & I believe with care this will not really effect things
much, if at all.  The input/output to/from the boiler will be through the
single nipple in the bottom.  A valve will be attached to allow input from
the mash tun pump or output to a cooler and eventually an output keg 
(gravity fed).

Well, yet another screwed up batch from the Serious Live Rabbits Brewery....


Some friends and I attempted a 4-gallon version of "Quick Mead" from the
Cat's Meow recipe book, using 7 pounds of honey and increasing spices
and such accordingly.  I boiled the honeywort for maybe 20 minutes to kill
anything that may have been living in the honey; the reason we did this
batch was to use up some old, crystallized honey that we had lying around.
I made a yeast started and pitched it when it started to foam.  Nine days
later, there is NO activity.  None.  Nada.  I haven't checked S.G., but
the stuff doesn't smell fermented, and there's no yeast sediment in the
bottom.


So, how did I screw up?  Is Edme ale yeast not suitable for honey?  Am I
just too impatient?  Is crystallized honey chemically changed into
something unfermentable?  Help save this poor carboy of sugar water,
pleeeeeeze....


oh, p.s.:  2 pounds of the honey used was fresh and normal, so you'd think
that SOMETHING would happen....
