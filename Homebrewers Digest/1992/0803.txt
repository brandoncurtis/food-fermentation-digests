Subject: 'Dry-malting'




I had an ale produced by the Boulder brewing company recently at a club meeting. 
It was delicious, but what most intrigued me was the nose...it smelled like 
fresh, malted grain, just like sticking your head into a feed bag.


Some of us thought that this might be a result of 'dry-malting', an analog to 
dry-hopping. Anyone have any information on this?


I plan on trying it with my next batch; a pound or so of malted 2-row in the 
secondary.

May be that your water supply uses chloramine for disinfection, as mine
does.  This doesn't smell like chlorine, but some of its breakdown
products do.  According to the chemist I talked to at the local water
plant, it takes 3-4 days for the breakdown to occur, and it is usually
helped along by nitrifying bacteria in the water mains.  It only
happens when the temperature is warm (above 14C in the pipe), and so is
usually evident in late summer and fall, and then only if you live far
from the plant in "pipe distance", as I do.


No doubt the effervescence in your hot water is due to gasses coming
out of solution.  Whether the chloramine is among these gasses, I don't
know.  I boil all my brewing water now (since talking to the chemist). 
Who knows what those nitrifying bacteria might do to my wort, not to
mention the chloramine.


"Relief" may be on the way, though, but at a cost.  The paper reported
recently that new federal regulations will probably require the Ann Arbor
water treatment facility to switch to ozone for disinfection.  This
will make the water bill go up by 25-30%, but will mean that there
won't be "any" chlorine in the water (and fewer bacteria, too).

Subject: weizen/weisse


I was doing my bedtime beer reading last night, and here's what
Jackson's New World Guide says.


In south Germany, Weisse and Weizen are used interchangeably, although
Jackson's column heading refers to the south German style as Weizen.
This is the style most of us are likely to be familiar with:  50-60%
wheat malt, relatively low hopping, use of sacchromyces delbruckii.


In north Germany, notably Berlin and Bremen, the Berliner Weisse style
(and never Weizen to my knowledge) is a low-gravity (low 1030s), sour
wheat beer, very lightly hopped, and fermented with lactobacillus  
delbruckii (that Delbruck got around!).

Subject: hop shoots as delicacy


As I understand it, hop shoots as food are served for only a very
limited time during the year, namely the time when the hops are just
sprouting.  As the very young hop shoots are beginning to grow, they
will force their way out of the hop mound.  Until they really get
going, they are very small and white rather than green.  To cultivate
hops for eating, throw a bit of dirt on the young sprouts to keep them
white.  After they've grown some and turned green, they're tough and
"thorny."

You write:
 
 This also happens to be the most efficient method of producing nitrosamines 
 and even the hardliners like Breis, make crystal malt by the indirect 
 process.  That is, by kilning it in such a way that it is never exposed to 
 the combustion products of a gas flame.  This also led me to stop making malt 
 in my kitchen oven.


Obvious solution: get an electric oven!  My favorite cooking combo is gas
range and electric oven. You can't dry things effectively in a gas oven
because of the H2O in the combustion products (I learned this trying to
make meringues).

All of your tubing needs can be supplied by: U.S. Plastics Corp.,
1390 Neubrecht Road, Lima, Ohio 45801.  There phone is (800)-
537-9724. They have just about any size/type of tubing made.  
The vinyl tubing that you are probably looking for comes in
 ...,7/8, 15/16, 1, 1-1/16, 1-1/8,.. OD and so on.  
You should be able to find just the right size.
They cost about $6.80/10' for the 1" tubing and you must
buy in 5' lengths.  They also have FDA, USDA, USP approved
B-IV type lined tubing that cost $20.60/10' for the 1" OD stuff.

Hello all.  I have a few questions about culturing yeast.


I was reading Papazian and understand about getting the sterile wort in the
bottles.  However, then he says to dump some pure yeast culture in the first
bottle.  I assume he means wyeast.  However, do you dump it all in one bottle,
or do you put a little in all bottles.  It seems to me that you would put
a little in all bottles, so it can multiply and you would have 12 bottles
full of cultured yeast.


But back to his method.  If you put it all in one bottle, he seems to imply
that you then dump the first bottle in the second and so on.  That makes no
sense to me.  Bottles are only so big. 


I am sure I am missreading him, and I plan to go buy millers book friday to
see what he has to say.  But could you please explain the procedure to me.
I understand about getting the sterile wort, but what do you do after that.


Thanks for the help on this and everything.  I hope I get net access when I
start working.

ps.  speaking of that, does anyone know anything about public user unix

While I don't know about the 60's, Coors is now and has been (for many
years, at least) a non-union operation.  But they do have beer on tap
in the lunchroom.  I've seen it on tours.  The tour guides say the policy
is that anyone not operating machinery (lift trucks, bottling machines,
etc.) is free to drink the beer.  But if you get drunk, you loose your
job.  The guides say that has never been a problem.


All in all, I think Coors is a really good company, even if I don't like
all of their products.  If only they would make Winterfest all year long....
Of course, I'm biased!  Coors sends excess steam from the brewery over
here to heat many of the campus buildings.

Sierra Nevada repitches their yeast from batch to batch.  They do not
harvest yeast fom the Bigfoot Ale, however, because the high alcohol
content makes it likely that the yeast will have mutated.


So, the yeast in the Bigfoot bottle is descended from the Pale Ale
yeast, but may not be identicle.

I don't think this will really do anything at all Rich. Honey ferments out


pretty cleanly if it is allowed to ferment completely. If I want to get any
honey flavor into my beer at all I use a minimum of two pounds. Still, this
is like adding corn sugar - you get a boost in alcohol but not much 
change in flavor.

You still have to aerate your wort. So assuming you have plenty of 
turbulence when you siphon into the fermenter then the yeast won't
get burried and you shouldn't have to worry.

        Belgian Ale                #1214


        California Lager        #2112


Her number is (512) 832-9045.


I have no affiliation with St. Patrick's.  I *will* be a customer soon.

I'm not sure about the glass that is used for carboys but i believe that 
window glass removes a significant about of UV.  Putting a black light

Subject: Priming with Malt




After brewing several batches of reasonably good beer, I have noticed a
strange aftertaste which diminishes over time. When I taste the beer
immediately before bottling and carbonation it is fantastic. However, the
finished product never tastes even close. My sanitation could not be better
short of an autoclave. I have been priming these extract brews with corn
sugar could this be the problem. How does one prime with malt? I would like
to boil up some dried extract and add it to the unprimed beer before
bottling. Papazian mentions krausening with unfermented wort, but I would
rather just use malt instead of sugar. Any suggestions on how much malt
extract to use would be appreciated.


When I brewed in Massachusetts I never had this problem with an identical
setup and procedure. So maybe the problem is Chicago water and not the use of
sugar, but then again the beer tastes great before bottling. I am getting
frustrated because prior to bottling I think I have made an ambrosia of the
gods, but after priming in the bottle the taste alters considerably for the
worse, although still much better than Bud etc. What is happening here?
Anyone else have a similar problem. How was it solved? Help!!!


Thanks in Advance,

I've been stewing about this top/bottom fermenting thing ever since Micah 
mentioned it several weeks ago. I remember reading in one of the brewing
tomes (Noonan? or was it Miller?) that top fermenting = ale and bottom
fermenting = lager is not strictly true. Several strains of ale yeast 
available to the home brewer are bottom fermenters. I don't remember if it
was stated that there are any top fermenting lager strains. Does anybody else
remember this or do I need to go and dredge up a reference?

There have been a couple of questions about Nierra Sevada lately :


From: quinnt`at`turing.med.ge.com (Tom Quinn 5-4291)


>I'd been keeping my eye out for the Pale Ale both to

Storing Sierra right next to Bud is clearly undesirable, but you may be OK
anyway. :-0 :-) Oh yeah, warm storage isn't ideal either. 


A seldom mentioned advantage of making starter cultures is that one has the
opportunity to do quality control checks (yumm) along the way. First of all,
smell and taste the Sierra. Second, taste it again. Third.....


If you find anything off, don't bother making a culture from it. Hold out
for a fresher source. (Fire up those flame throwers!) Yeah, I live in the 
SF area, so that's easy for me to say. There are probably folks out there
who will maintain that you can get a perfectly viable yeast from a beer that
is light struck, oxidized, etc.... This is probably OK if you are willing
to streak the yeast on a petri dish and isolate a healthy colony. If however,
you simply plan to dump the dregs into sterile wort, your best bet is to 
get hold of a clean, fresh tasting sample.


Once you've made your starter and it's ready to pitch, smell and taste it.
It may be bready, yeasty or overly sweet, but above all it should be clean.
If you detect any defects, don't use it. If it tastes fine, then it's
probably OK to pitch, even if it was stacked next to cases of Bud.

I believe that Sierra uses notches on the label to encode the date. There
are no months written there, but the key to the code has been published.
Zymurgy?? I met some Wort Processors at the 1990 AHA convention in Oakland
who had this little card that deciphered the date when properly aligned
with the label. Maybe JaH knows of this.

I've heard that Sierra uses the same yeast for all of their products.
Since Bigfoot is pretty serious stuff, it's safe to say that Sierra
yeast works well for barleywines. You're better off getting your yeast
from a Pale Ale though. It will be healthier because the higher levels
of alcohol in Bigfoot are more toxic to yeast. It will also be fresher
because Bigfoot requires a longer maturation period than Pale Ale. Living 
at the bottom of a bottle of Bigfoot is difficult, even if you happen
to be a yeast cell :-)

Out here in CA, there is a chain of stores called TAP Plastics. They are
pretty well stocked with hoses of various sizes and compositions. There
is also a store called Hoses Unlimited (San Leandro), which pretty much 
says it all. I doubt that they mail order, so check the Yellow Pages under

Holy Moly! That's a good chunk of change for a UV sterilizer. If you want to
experiment with UV sterilization there's a lot cheaper route to go. UV 
sterilizers are used by aquariust types to kill parasites. Here are some 
selected prices from "That Fish Place", a mail order outfit that I do business 
with:


        Aquanetics 30 watt inline UV sterilizer ......  94.89
        Hawaiian Marine 30 watt inline sterilizer .... 199.89
        30 watt UV replacement bulb ..................  25.49


Sorry, I don't know the flow rates these sterilizers will support but you can
be sure they're less than 1 gal/min. You could probably do 5 gallons in an
hour or two but that's a purely random guess on my part.

Subject: Radiation Sterilization


 That was a nice writeup on radiation by Mike Hall in hbd #802.  I would like
to add something about the use of microwaves that has been questioned occasionally.
Microwaves will not sterilize wort or equipment.  The microwave ovens can sterilize
or pasteurize by heating its contents to an appropriate temperature but the
microwaves themselves have a small or no effect on killing microorganisms.  I say
that not because I'm a microbiologist or a nuclear physicist but because I use
a microwave oven periodically for warming bread dough to make it rise.  It heats
the dough very evenly and can really speed up the rising provided that you do not
heat the dough too much.  My conclusion from this is that the yeast is not dying;
it is actually thriving.


I have not, however, gone so far as to heat my yeast starter solution in the
microwave oven because I am afraid of the microwaves causing mutations in the beer
yeast.  Perhaps a microbiologist can respond as to whether this paranoia of mine
is justified.  Mutations of bread yeast would not bother me because they are there
only to produce CO2.


Sterilization in a microwave is practical provided that there is sufficient water
and not very much metal inside.  I've heard that if you violate either of these two
rules you run the risk of destroying the klystron.  I have a friend, though, who
has put many different kinds of things in his microwave such as foil and light
bulbs (no cats though) and his still works.  


The temperatures required for sterilization are:  250 F for steam sterilization and
300 F for dry sterilization.  Pasteurization temperature is typically 150 F which
would kill all yeast and most (99% ?) bacteria.  These temperatures should apply
inside a microwave oven also.

    The reasoning seems sound, and it is true that oxygen-deficient wort
    will cause your yeast to have trouble reproducing, but 2 gallons of
    air sitting on top of your 5 gallons of wort are not going to enter
    the wort unless you shake.  I think the rate that the air will dissolve
    into the wort, if it simply sits quietly, is very slow and aeration
    during the filling of the carboy would be several orders of magnitude
    more than aeration from the air sitting quietly.  Comments?
    Al.




Al's comments are very true.  A great deal of air will disolve into wort
if it's surface is disturbed or agitated, and very little if it is not.  


I found out about this when I was researching aeration techniques for
my aquariums.  Basically what was said is that if the surface of the water
is disturbed, air will be disolved into the water.  So I experimented by
rigging up a water pump with a tube on the pumps outlet.  I pierced the
tube every 3"-4" (approx 1/8" dia hole) over the length of the tube.
Placing the tube under water, orienting it so that the pumps output just
barely disturbed the surface.  None of the fishies that I put in the tank
suffered from O2 starvation (this was 2 years ago).  I have now converted
all my tanks to using this method.  It's quieter (can't here it from a few
feet away), simpler, and seems to aerate the water more efficiently than
those d*mn air pumps!


Oops!  Sorry for excess detail - but seeing as how wort is mostly water...

       I just racked a light lager to secondary last night.  I dry-hopped
    it with an oz. of Saaz.  It's actually gonna be more of a steam beer (TM),
    since it's been fermenting at about 50 degF.  Anyway, the important info
    is that the primary was done *in the brewpot*.  I cooked it up, chilled it 
    with an immersion chiller, pitched, covered, and moved it to the cool room.  
    It was a Rapids 10 gal. pot.  It worked great.  The cover is loose enough to 
    allow CO2 out.  One odd thing is that the brewpot is now as clean as it has 
    ever been.  There were minor scorch marks on the bottom, from the 2 gas flames
    I use to cook with, but now the bottom is absolutely clean.  Hmmmm.  The 
    pot itself cleaned *very* easily.  Obviously, if you're concerned about 
    racking off the cold break, this is not for you.  But it's quick and easy.  
    We'll see how the beer turns out.  Recommended, so far.


I've been doing this for about a year now.  It works great, and has freed up
my old fermenter for use as a carboy.  I can now brew approx twice as often
as I used to.

    Charlie P. mentioned in his posting that he was going off in search of
    "the oldest brewery in the americas."  Anyone have any idea what that 
    may be?  I _think_  that Jackson's book says that Yeungling (sp), in
    Pottstown, PA, is the oldest in the US.  I assume that "the americas"
    means both continents.  Which do you think has the older brewing history,
    north or south america?  


On a recent trip to New Hampshire, I tried "Frank Jones Indian Pale Ale".
The Frank Jones Brewry (Portsmouth, Maine)claimed to be the oldest brewry
in the US (I have forgotten the date they were established).  The brewry
closed their doors during prohibition, and reopened a few years ago.  They
claim that the recipes they are using are the origial, authentic recipes
used when established, or was it when they closed their doors?  Good
Indian Pale.


I vote for south america; Inca, Myan (sp), et al.

I just checked TCJoHB and TNCJoHB and nowhere does Charlie mention
ammonia salt nutrients for meads.  In the 1st edition, he simply
says "3 teaspoons of yeast nutrient" in the one mead recipe listed,
the "Barkshack Gingermead."  In the 2nd edition, there are three
recipes for mead and in the two new ones it says "1/4 oz. yeast
extract" which he describes as the "guts" of yeast cells.  The
"Barkshack Gingermead" recipe now recommends that you add either
the yeast nutrient or the yeast extract.


Now... I don't know about either of these nutrients, or whether the
only variety of yeast nutrient is the ammonia salt type, but I
just wanted to clear this up.  I disagree with some of the things
that Charlie has written, but I disagree a lot more with Miller.
By the way, as I read Miller, I marked things with which I disagree.
Maybe I'll post a couple for debate someday.
Al.
