Subject: Random thoughts on carboy handles, grain mill rollers


Someone, I don't remember who, and it was a long time ago, posted the
suggestion to use a plastic milk crate to hold the carboy.  I have a
plastic milk crate and it does work well.  The carboy is a little smaller
than the crate, so there is room to slid my fingers into the handles.
The weight of the full carboy rests on its base, and doesn't hang from
the neck like it would from a handle.  The plastic absorbs some of the
shock when I set it down on a hard cement floor.  Legal cheapo milk
crates may be purchasd for a few bucks.  Illegal ones are cheaper.
To be fair, carboy handles may be better when holding a full wet carboy
sideways to dump out the sanitizing water.  I can rest the carboy on the
side of the laundry tub (still in the handy crate) when I empty it, so
supporting it is no problem.


All this talk of knurling and scoring grain mill rollers to grab the grain
has me wondering:  Why not coat the rollers with some sort of rubber, like
a stick-on sheet, or hot dipping, to grip the grain.  If the rubber is
thin enough, or hard enough, the grain should get crushed just fine.  Has
anyone ever done this?  Or is a silly idea for some reason I haven't
thought of?

Subject: RIMS Temperature Controller?


I have been using a RIMS unit ( a la R. Morris ) for a while with good
results.


I built the temperature controller he used per his diagram posted on
Compuserve, and could not get it to work. ( Yes, I checked and quadruple-
checked the wiring, and replaced parts, and all that ) I suspect device
parametric differences, such as drive current, etc.


In any case, it doesn't work. I have a 100K NTC thermistor encapsulated
and positioned in the wort flow.  I have plotted the resistance curve
and presently read the resistance to determine temperature, while 
turning on the heating element to get to the desired temperature.
This hasn't been so bad, because once you get the mash to the desired
temperature, it tends to stay there for a while, and it still beats the
stir/scorch/cuss/scramble method.


I still would like to have real temperature control though. Does anybody
have a tried and true temperature controller circuit which would work
for something like this?


I'm in the process of upgrading the system by using a "mash tun from hell"
similar to the one described in the digest some time ago 
in place of the cooler.  If there is any interest, I'll post some of my
contruction details and/or experiences.

iterature says you can go 6-7 generations, but out
of fear of mutations, etc., I have always stopped at 3. Since I usually
prepare about 10-15 tubes at a time, my $3.50 pouch of Wyeast goes a
long way, and each tube ends up costing me 25-30 cents, mostly because 
of the cost of the solution.

Greetings,


        Lately, fragments of postings have dealt with the use of chemicals to
foster Yeast colonies.  Would someone please address this topic in detail,
comparing and contrasting the various Yeast Nutrients, Yeast Energizers,
and Brewing salts?


        I flew from Rochester, NY to Minneapolis, MN a couple of weeks ago with
a full case of home brew.  It fit neatly under my seat.  I had no trouble
bringing it past the security inspection point.  I had only one mishap, the
straps of the duffle bag which contained the case tore off while I was boarding
in Rochester so when I switched planes in Detroit I ended up walking a fair
piece with the bag cradled in my arms like a newborn baby...


        Sipping a bottle of my brew the other day, I noticed a hint of banana.
I wonder if somehow esters were formed.  Being something of a novice, I don't
doubt that my lousy technique is at fault.  Does anyone know which parameter(s)
the beer considered when deciding to ester or not to ester?


Cheers,

Jeff Frane kindly responded to my query offline, and I think it is of
general interest, so his note follows.  By "information," I meant the
stuff posted in the past on the other wyeast strains, such as optimal
temperature for ferment, apparent attentuation, flavors in the
resultant beers, and so on.  Jeff Beta-tested the Belgian strain, and
his comments appear below.

In today's Digest, you ask if anyone has information about two
new WYeast strains. What, specifically, do you want to know?


I've brewed with the Belgian strain, as a sort of Beta site for
WYeast. Haven't talked with Dave about my results yet, but I will
say that if you use it, I would strongly recommend holding the
fermentation temperature down below 60F. (This on advice of
Martin Lodahl.) I kept it at 65F and resulting beer was VERY
estery; this is in line with Martin's experience with Chimay
yeast. Luckily, my wife loves all that fruit, but it's not what
I had in mind.


On the positive side, it took a 1.072 wort down to 1.012 in about
a week, maybe less. It has taken quite a while to clear in the bottle;
or anyway, longer than I'm used to with Sierra ale yeast.


The "California lager" yeast is a genuine, st**m b**r yeast.
If that's the kind of beer you're interested in, this is probably
your best choice.


If I learn anything more, I'll post. I believe the yeasts are
in the stores now; there was a considerable delay because the
package manufacturer failed to deliver on time.

Subject: Doubling batch size after Primary in SS Boiling Pot.




Hey all, I've got a hyperthetical question for ya' ...


Suppose you had a SS pot capable of boiling and fermenting 10 gallons of wort.
S'pose also, that what you really wanted was 15 gallons of beer.


Presuming that we designed our 10 gallon batch to have an OG 1.5 times higher
than our 15 gallon would have been (wiollhaven!?), is it possible to add the
extra 5 gallons of water (boiled of course!) after primary fermentation without
adversely affecting the finished product?


A few subquestions on this subject:


1)  Would it be best to aerate the extra 5 gallons of water and carefully rack
the wort onto it for secondary fermentation?  Or would the oxygen added during
this "secondary" aeration tend to oxidize the beer?


2)  Will the ensuing secondary fermentation be vigorous or turbulent enough to
thoroughly mix the beer and ensure a good blending of the various flavoring and
aromatic components?


3) Has anybody tried this and with what results?

I don't know if this is a good idea.  You had better be sure you've
sanitized the grain -- steam maybe?  A common source of bacterial
infection is grinding the grain in the same room you fill the fermenter.
The grain dust carries a lot of bacteria.

Tony Babinec says that Jackson's Book says:


>>In south Germany, Weisse and Weizen are used interchangeably, although
>>Jackson's column heading refers to the south German style as Weizen.


With all due respect to the esteemed Mr. Jackson, I beg to differ:
In southern Germany (Bavaria or better, Bayern), use of the term Weisse
anywhere but on the label is rare.  The people ("Volksmund") do not refer
to their Weissbier as Weisse or as Weissbier:  they call it Weizen.  If
you ask for a Weisse in Nuernberg or Munich you'll get a funny look.  If
you ask for Weizen, they'll ask "Hefe oder Kristall?" meaning with or
without yeast.  Real Weizen drinkers drink Hefeweizen, carefully pouring
it by putting the bottle completely into the glass holding both at a 30'
angle (from the table) and allowing the foam to be sucked into the bottle.
The bottle is slowly pulled from the glass keeping the mouth 1-2cm from
the level of the beer as the glass is raised to vertical.  This does take
practice, and is best tried for the first time outside or over a sink.
A small amount of head left in the bottle is allowed to 'condense' back
into beer, and then is swirled around to pick up the yeast -- this is then
poured into the glass, causing what is locally known as 'the snowstorm
effect'.  Living in Bavaria is living in Beer Heaven.  There are lots
of different Weizens to try many of which are wonderful (Erdinger is 
excellent,  Schneider is good,  Kitzmann and Tucher are nothing to write
home about).

I had some Anchor Foghorn on draft the other night in Pasadena and it

I complained to our waitron who told me ``It's supposed to taste like that.''

        Morton's lite salt is made from potassium chloride (along with
some sodium chloride; I believe it's a 50%/50% blend).  Potassium is
directly underneath sodium in the periodic table: it has the same
valence, similar properties, etc.  Calcium is next to potassium; it has
an extra electron in its outer shell (8-8-2 vs. 8-8-1), so it combines
with two chlorine atoms to form CaCl2.

To correct a few minor nits:


The beer is actually called Frank Jones Portsmouth Ale, and it is in the style
of an India Pale Ale.  The Frank Jones Brewery in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
not Maine, isn't yet on-line, so its beers are still being contract brewed at
Catamount Brewing Company in White River Junction, Vermont.


I've never heard of Frank Jones claiming to have been the oldest U.S. brewery,
but he did claim to be the world's largest, though it's thought that he was
using a bit of license making that claim.  The original brewery did take up
much real estate in Portsmouth around the turn of the century, and Jones had a
brewery in Boston at one point too.


The current Frank Jones brewery is owned by partners Don Jones and Lee Ann
Lombardi.  Don is a relative of Frank's, great-grandson I think.


There are presently two Frank Jones beers:  Portsmouth Ale is a hoppy, bitter
India Pale Ale, and Frank Jones Special Reserve is a high-gravity, high-alcohol,
delicious ale that is similar in style to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  The Special
Reserve is currently only available in NH state liquor stores, due to arcane
state regulations regarding the alcohol content of beer in NH.  Normally beer
is sold in supermarkets and variety stores in NH.


Frank Jones Ale is available on tap in several locations around Portsmouth,
and one of them, The Rusty Hammer, has many pieces of original Frank Jones 
breweriana.  Check it out if in the area, and look for the brewery to open soon.
And get some Special Reserve, it's a winner!


The oldest (established) brewery in America?  I think it's Molson, which dates
back to 1786?

Just an FYI for all out there responding to my query about chlorine and
hot tap water.  Seattle water is surface run off from protected mountain
valleys.  There is little treatment other than settling ponds, a coarse
filter and CL2 injection at the main intake and at each reservoir.


I believe that about ten years ago Seattle started treating the water with a
little lime to protect the water pipes in older houses (a little coating of
lime to prevent corrosion and leaching of lead).  The net result is very soft
water with just a tad of calcium carbonate hardness (20ppm or so).

That was the problem that most disturbed me about one of those pH pens.  The
probe part of the instrument is not replaceable, but pH probes do wear out.
I built a pH meter which uses a Digital Volt Meter (DVM) for the readout,
and use a low cost ($35) pH probe I bought from Cole-Parmer.  The accuracy
is much better, and all I replace is the probe, not the entire instrument.
pH probes are perishable and there is not much that can be done about it.

I am going to use this method on my next batch.  I found an item that
is similar to an airstone, but is a smooth porous ceramic tube with rubber
end grommets.  This will fit perfectly on the end of a 2 ft. piece of 10mm.
glass tubing.  The plastic tubing connects the air pump to the glass
tubing.  Both tubing and diffuser are easy to sanitize with boiling water.
I am not going to worry (!) about the bacteria that may be present.  I think
that the amount present would be small.  I thought of enclosing the air pump
in a small box with a quartz UV tube that I have, but I am not sure I want
to blow ozone through my beer either.  (Talk about oxidized beer)  You
can buy filters from Cole-Parmer that will filter the bacteria from the air,
but I didn't want to spend over $100 for a package of 100 filters.  Maybe
we could split the package 20 ways?


On the subject of UV lamps for sterilization, does anyone have any reference
books that deal with exposure time and penetration of UV radiation at 254nm?
I checked a local electrical distributor and I can get a 15 watt, 18 inch
germicidal tube ($22) that will fit my undercounter light in the kitchen.
I want to use this for area sterilization while I am doing my yeast culturing.
I know this wavelength UV will burn skin and eyes, so I WILL be wearing

Tanker Ale is the name of the beer Perry is describing, if that will help anyone
answer Perry's question.  I've drunk Tanker Ale on three occasions, and have
always been very impressed by the amount of fresh grain aroma in it.  Actually,
the one Perry tried on Saturday may have been a little old, because it was less
impressive than the other two I've had.  Still good though.


If anyone knows how Boulder Brewing Company does it, I'd like to hear.
Curiously, when I see printed mention of BBC's products, Tanker Ale is never
mentioned.

It only took me about an hour to put a bizzilion holes in the bottom of
one of those buckets. The problem is that you generally drill from the 
bottom and that little plastic curley-cues are left on the other side
which, in this case, is the inside of the bucket. The curley-cues tend to
partly block the holes. I took a single-edged razor blade and trimmed
them off. Melting holes (or slots) is another alternative which might
make globs but no curley-cues. I bet it's a lot slower though since you'll
have to heat the knife for each hole/slot. With a power drill it's just

 Good question.  I guess the only answer I can think of is, why make new 
 poison just because you think it will go away?  That's not a very good answer 
 but that's because it was a very good question.  I simply applied what makes 
 sense for drinking water to brewing without thinking it through.
 
 >I have noticed that hot water from my tap usually comes out effervescent and
 never smells clorinated, unlike the cold water which sometimes smells
 clorinated - Usually near the end of summer when supplies are low.
 
 I noticed something else about hot tap water and did some experiments that 
 convinced me that using cold water is a MOMILY.  Fill a glass with hot tap 
 water and one with cold and let them sit over night then taste them in the 
 morning.  In the case of Chicago water at least, the cold water usually has a 
 very unpleasant taste after sitting out.  
 
 I found this by accident because I frequently noted that water served by 
 restaurants around Chicago had a very foreign taste.  When I noted the same 
 taste at restaurants IN Chicago, the scientist in me came out because I drink 
 Chicago water at home and it never tastes that way, until I tasted some that 
 was left out over night.
 
 Although I now boil my water to get more miles out of my nifty SS brewpot, I 
 had been just keeping several pitchers out for for drinking water.  I fill 
 them from the hot water tap and generally sit for 24 hours before drinking.
 
 This does indeed get rid of the chlorine and other volatiles, just takes 
 longer than boiling.

 When you prime with malt you will find the opposite situation.  After you add 
 the malt solution, the beer takes on a raw malt taste that goes away with 
 time.

 Boil about a cup in a litttle water and use just like sugar.

While this has been discussed to death, here's one more data point.  It
is possible to sanitize stuff in a microwave, but only at low pressure. 
Essentially, the gases turn to plasma, which does a very good job of
killing off everything in the container. Practical applications of this
technology for medical sanitation are expected to be a year or two out,
unfortunately.  It has the added benefit of not getting too hot,  so you
can sanitize some of that plastic tubing, etc. :-).

Subject: Unmalted rye in brewing


Greetings,


As I write this I'm roasting a pound of unmalted rye in my oven (375' F, 35
min. so far). The idea is to make the following take off on a stout.


                7 lb.        2 row Klages
                1 lb.        carastan
                1 lb.        roasted unmalted rye
                1 lb.        flaked rye


The procedure will include a 30 min. protein rest and a 60 min sacc. rest at
appropriate temperatures and the right hopping for a semi-dry stout. My main
question is, has anyone done this and if so is it good? Also if anyone has
experience roasting grain, unmalted or not, I'd love to hear about it.  I'm
just tired of paying up to 5X what our friendly HB store owners are paying for
grain. Yes I buy my 2 row in bulk and the carastan too ($0.30 and $0.37/lb.) 
but I don't use enough of the dark grains to justify 50 lb bags (I only wish).
If there is interest in this and if I get some good roasting info I will
gladly summarize in this august journal.

I'd say as far as the wine-theif, fermentation lock, etc go this should work
but probably wouldn't be easy. You probably have to heat enough that the
actual equipment gets hot. I don't think that the bacteria or yeast would
have enough polar molecules (like water) to absorb much microwave so
you'd have to rely on the heat from the surfaces to kill them. (To clarify,
they may be 99% water but they have a very small cross-section.) In this case
you might as well put them in the oven. Bleach is probably the quickest and
most reliable. Since I obviously don't know a heck of a lot about it I'll move
on to what I do know and the main reason for the post:

There are all kinds of epoxies available.  There are formulations
available that don't become brittle and some that are approved for food
containers.  Sorry I can't recommend a specific brand.  Read the
labels carefully and check around.


You can improve the bond by sanding around the crack to roughen it up
so the epoxy will have more to hold onto.  Most epoxies don't bond well
to smooth surfaces.  Also, covering the crack with some sort of strong
synthetic cloth that you can permeate with epoxy will make the patch
much stronger, and more flexible.


Food grade epoxies can be very handy for building homebrew equipment.
Be sure you give them plenty of time to cure so they lose all their
volatile constituents before using them.




Good luck.
