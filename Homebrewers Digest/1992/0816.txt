The beer in question is produced by the Kalamazoo Brewing Co., a
microbrewery.  In general, it's pretty good, but somewhat variable.  The
sediment must be yeast, as I believe he bottle-conditions.  (The owner is
Larry Bell, thus "Bell's".)

Subject: cold water "momily"


(Oooh.  There's that word again!-)


Recent conversation with a British friend perhaps sheds some light on the
hot versus cold water issue.  (I first ran into this in brewing tea, where
the proper method starts with cold tap water.) Apparently, standard
plumbing practice in Britain is to run the water main to a cistern in the
attic, and to supply (almost) all the water taps in the house from the
cistern.  The only exception is a single cold water tap in the kitchen. 
Now, you may not want to drink water that has been sitting in a tank for
some unknown period of time before you get it, so you typically will drink
water only from the kitchen cold tap, and not from any of the hot taps. 


Why the cistern?  Well, apparently in many places, the ancient water mains
just aren't large enough to handle everybody turning on their showers at
the same time.... (Or so he said.)  The cisterns provide a measure of
buffering.

Subject: azeotropes, NA beer


I can only chuckle at some of the recent postings regarding whether Jack's NA
beer procedure will work or won't and why, lots of handwaving, vapor
pressures, equiilibrium mixtures, blah, blah, blah......


My advice to Chip H. and Chuck C. is that if wish to apply Raoult's Law to a
system, make sure that the system you're looking at obeys the law before you 
start making generalizations.


In the case of ethanol/water, it is not an ideal system and all of the
calculations you performed are meaningless.  Due to molecular interactions,
ethanol and water form a minimum boiling mixture called an azeotrope which, at
atmospheric pressure, boils at 78.2 degrees Centigrade (lower than either EtOH
or water) with a composition of 95.6% ethanol and 4.4% water.  (At lower
pressures the percent of alcohol in this azeotrope actually increases).


In practice this means that if you boil a water/ethanol mixture, what will boil
off initially is this azeotrope (4.4 : 95.6) until one of the two components is
totally distilled, then the remaining component will distill.


In Jack's system this ratio may be slightly different since there are small
amounts of other components in the beer and since Jack doesn't quite hit the
boiling point (172.8 deg. F) of the azeotrope.  However, as Jean Hunter
pointed out, the ratio is at least 10:1 EtOH:water and is probably even
higher.


If Jack is getting >1 cup evaporation from 1 gallon of beer (assumed 5%
alc./vol) by his procedure, he is more than likely making NA (<0.5% alc.)
beer.    I'll leave it to you to do the math. I'd be very interested in seeing
any results that Jean might get from an HPLC analysis of Jack's NA beer.

> Just how much CO2 does it take to carbonate a 5 gal batch?


I, too, am curious what mileage other folks are getting.  I've been a wastrel
with my CO2, so I think my back-of-envelope numbers should be a good 
outside guess.  I've kegged, carbonated, and dispensed two (2) 5-gal soda
kegs.  I also used the CO2 to force sanitizing and rinse water through the
pickup-tubes on 12 keg-cleanings.  Toss in as many pressurizations of the 
empty tanks for storage.  I also put a blanket of CO2 down before siphoning 
into the keg.  My 5lb tank has gone from 800PSIg to 760PSIg.  It is grossly 
unfair to say that each keg cost 20PSI but using that as another outside 
approximation shows the tank's good for 35-40 kegs (cleaning, kegging, and
dispensing), my guess is closer to 60.  My refills are $7, so $.20 a keg is 
chicken feed to me.  But my  sample is admitedly too small and is statisticly
inconclusive.  I've heard you're not supposed to empty the CO2 tank, how far 
down have folks taken it?

I noticed you were using Wyeast English Ale yeast.  Is this
1028 or 1084?  I would suspect 1028.  Try using 1084.  I have
made porters/brown ale with 1084 and the creamyness is there.


Wyeast has told me that 1084 is great for porters and fruit
beers since it adds a touch of creamyness.  You will get a
slight amount of diacetyl from the 1084, but not that 
woody/bold/mineral taste which 1028 leaves.

Subject: Re: Force Carbonation


I have a 5lb bottle of CO2 and it lasted for around 18 kegs o
beer (firestone).  I forced carbonated most of them (around 12).


I got the bottle refilled at a local welding supply for $8.
Actually I traded in my bottle for an refilled one - that way my
gas supply was "down" for only 15 minutes.


Question:when you carbonate, do you have problems with beer being
forced back into the gas line?  Does carbonating through the "out"
tube prevent this from happening?  The reason beer is forced back
out the gas line is due to inertia (hammering) from the sloshing
beer.

The following is excerted from an article in the Stockton Record, 
a reputable daily rag from Stockton, CA, dated 2/2/92, byline Sarah Williams.
The title is:   STOCKTON NATIVE'S BEER-KEG DEATH STUMPS FAMILY
"     The family of a Stockton native killed by a ruptured beer keg is trying
to sort through the freak accident. 
      Clinton Richard Doan, ... died Wednesday at his Kethcum, Idaho, home
after he opened a refrigerator in his garage.
      "When he went to put his lunch in the refrigerator, the beer keg exploded
in his face and killed him," said Doan's mother, Dorothea Doan Evans of
Washington.
      Evans said her son's wife, Donna, had tried to put his lunch in the
refrigerator but was unable to because the keg had expanded. When he tried,
he was killed.
      The family has not determined whether it will sue, Evans said.
      According to sheriff's reports, a faulty regulator could be to blame
for the extreme pressure inside the keg.
      The keg shot upward and hit Doan in the head after its bottom cracked..."


What a way to go! The article did not say whether the keg held industrial
Milbudiken or,(perish the thought) homebrew. And we thought bottles and
carboys were dangerous! Does anyone in Idaho netland know more of this tragedy?

Well, my guess is that the brewery is trying to imply some
sort of quality - Bavaria is known around the world for its
beer, whereas Baden is known for its wine...This is probably
why so many beers in the US have names like Augsburger (i.e.n.b.

It is possible that it is under 0 Celsius since the alcohol will lower the
freezing temperature a little (how much depends on strength, but it's probably
not too much).


This isn't however a ferment it is an aging (aka lagering), by the time it hits
these cold cellars it should have done most if not all of it's fermenting.

Hello-
        This may have been discussed at one point but I'm afraid I am new

Is using Hydrogen Peroxide an acceptable substitute?  If not, then why do so
many suppliers sell stuff like B-Brite?  Good beer is important, but let's
not forget the environment...BTW, what's all this about tap water - is
this a general truth (i.e. rinsing out after sanitizing will reinfect) or
does this depend on your water...Baltimore City, while known for crime

We use it to brew, so why not use it to rinse, post-sanitization?

What I meant was to use finings two days before the second racking and
not the first.  I don't have any data saying that you shouldn't fine
your yeast out of suspension early in the ferment, but intuatively,
it doesn't sound like a good idea to me.  I think that, to get more
diacetyl to remain in your beer, the yeast should be precipitated out
and the beer racked off it basically when the beer is almost done
fermenting.  Comments?

After trying a wonderfully delightful barleywine at a local brewpub
(Seabright in Santa Cruz) I got the bug to make one yesterday.
Unfortunatly, all I had to work from was the basic outline from the
table in TCJOHB and no recipe. I've always been one to improvise
but had a few questions I was hoping to get answered by this
knowledgeable (and relaxed) group.


Recipe:


11 lbs pale malt extract (generic)
4 oz. Fuggles (4.2%) Boiling
3/4 oz. Fuggles Finishing


I plan to pitch Wyeast Belgian Ale for primary fermentation and then
rack to secondary and pitch a champagne to finish it off.


Questions:


What is the traditional time of finishing hops? I had no clue so
compromised at 5 minutes...


How long to age in secondary before bottling?


Expected time needed to condition in bottles?

 I've tried many of Larry Bell's different brews (Kalamazoo Brewing Co.)
 and they all have a little hint of sourness in the background.  In general,
 I do like his beers though.


 I believe it does have something to do with the yeast.  I've cultured
 yeast from one of his ales, but the starter had that same sour taste,
 so I chickened out and didn't pitch it.


 If you do try it, I'd like to know how your beer turns out.

 That is a most generous offer and if you had posted your mailing address it 
 would be on the way.  However, upon further consideration, it seems not only 
 a waste of energy but hardly in the true "scientific tradition".  After all, 
 what is to prevent me from re-bottling a can each, of Old Style and 
 Kingsbury?
 
 There have been several highly technical responses that address my method 
 from theoretical viewpoints.  There was one "sure-fire" alternative that 
 boils the blazes out of the beer and several hunches that maybe, it would 
 work.
 
 The scientific tradition demands that other experimenters attempt to 
 reproduce my experiment, then evaluate and publish THEIR results.  Remember 
 "cold fusion"?  We would still be arguing about it if critics only theorized.
 
 Admitedly, the weakness of my "paper" is that the analysis of the results are 
 subjective because I have no way of measuring the alcohol other than how it 
 makes me feel.  Not very precise but a measure, nevertheless.
 
 I suggest that anyone who has the capability of measuring alcohol in beer 
 take a bottle of their own and pour half of it into a beaker.  Heat this to 
 170F (uncovered) and let it cool (uncovered) and make the tests on this and 
 the other half of the bottle.
 
 Then, tell us it DOESN'T work.  "Can't" work, simply is not good enough.
 
 The only caution I inject is that a Bunsen burner, full blast on a 100 ml 
 beaker may not simulate the heating rate of gas stove on a gallon.  I think 
 the total time is irrelevant because it is proportional to volume but heating 
 rate might affect the results.

 WOW!  Encouraging a daughter interested in slimemold is not even on the same 
 plane as a few batches of beer.   If you have never seen slime mold grow, I 
 suggest it is worth the risk.  I spent months doing this and filming them for 
 my video on fungus.  Unfortunately, no one told me how "easy" it was.
 
 But I suspect that only a routine amount of care should allow both pursuits

Why not use the real thing.  Mocha-Java as in Mocha Mattari (from Yemen)
and Java Estate (from, uh, Java).  This is one of the finest and smoothest
coffee blends ever.  It can be brewed VERY strong and stay smooth, yet is
very tasty and delicate when brewed medium light.  A note to the uninitiated
(into coffee snobbery, that is ;-), many "Moka" blends are made with either
no or next to no Mocha (the commonest substitute is Ethiopian Harrar + Java,
the worst is 10-20% real Mocha/Java blended with Columbian/Mexican generic
coffee beans).  (I know, coffee belongs in rec.food.drink, but it came up
here...  ;->  )  Another side note, dark roasts seem to have a higher oil
content in the brewed coffee than light roasts.   As I understand, you 
absolutely do NOT want to introduce any kinda oils in brewing as they
oxidise easily (read "rancid!" |~< )

Yeast produces CO2 also, right?  I've always wondered about this.
More specifically, does the secondary (CO2) fermenation further raise
the alcohol level?  And, if not, what triggers the yeast to produce bubbles

the need for blowoff, etc.

that L.A. beers are made with special enzymes that aid the yeasties in
reducing the sugars to other than alcohol (what? more CO2?)

ihmo (worth $0.00) Anchor Porter is a Stout.  Try Sierra Nevada Porter
for a more representive sample of the style  (careful, tho, the SNP can
be quite stale when bought at the wrong store.  use the beer calculator ;o)

Following the thread of boiling beer to make a nonalcoholic beer:
In response to cjh`at`vallance.HQ.Ileaf.COM (Chip Hitchcock) I wrote:


>Regarding the formula for vapor pressure- I think there is a units problem

He had written:


>This gives a vapor pressure ratio of 2.51 at 10C, 2.30 at 75C, and 2.22 at
                             =====
which I read without the word "ratio".  Ooops.  Like a lawyer chasing a
malpractice suit, I quickly pointed out Chip's "error", without even trying
his formulae.  I apologize to Chip for mistakenly accusing him of bad data,
and I'd like to thank him for pointing out my error (in great detail ;-) 


Now, can we all agree that boiling a beer just ain't gonna' make it
nonalcoholic?


Sorry for the misunderstanding,

Subject: various bottling methods


I recently tried several bottling methods that worked
or didn't work for me.


I used a TSP soak on two cases of bottles.  The TSP didn't
quite remove all the stains from inside the bottles.  The
labels came off easily for all bottles except for one particular
brand(I think it was Bud or Bud Light).  A subsiquent soak in
bleach removed all stains from inside the bottles.


Lately I've been using my dishwasher to clean bottles.  It has
a "Sanitary Wash" cycle that consists of a long wash in 170F
water followed by a heat drying cycle.  I've not had any 
problems yet, as long as the bottles don't have any stains.


Unwilling to cap 96 bottles for a party I was planning, I 
bottled two batches in regular 2-liter soda bottles.  I
just rinsed out the soda, used a bleach soak, filled with
beer, and used the original cap.  This worked much better
than I expected, and I saw no difference between the beer in
the 2-liter bottles and the beer in the 12oz bottles, except
perhaps that the 2-liter bottles had developed a bit more
carbonation.


Of course champainge bottles work well.  Sparkling cider
bottles also make great containers.

Subject: fennel spice beer


Just recently I brewed a batch of spiced stong lager.
The spice used was fennel(sp?), which I think is also called
anise(sp?).  The recipe is as follows:


"Bengal Butt Kicker"
15   lbs Klages                                OG: 1.070
2.75 lbs Munich                                IBU:  ~35-40
1    lb  Amber crystal                        Color:  dark orange
 .25  lb  Chocolate
1    oz  Northern Brewers 10%AA  (60min)
1    oz  N. Brewers (15 min)
0.5  oz  Cascades 5.9%AA  (15min)
2    oz  fresh fennel (15 min)
6    oz  fresh orange peel (15 min)
0.5  tsp Irish Moss(15 min)
1    cp  American Lager yeast slurry
10       Bengal Spice tea bags, "dry hopped"
0.75 cp  Corn sugar to prime


Upwards infusion mash, low-temp conversion.
Used water with high carbonate hardness.


So far, the young beer tastes great with an unusual
taste that is difficult to describe.  I hadn't seen
mention of using fennel before, so I thought I'd
mention it.

Subject: REQUEST: Millet Beer (sic)


A friend of mine spent some time abroad(I can't quite
remember where), and he used to party with a local 
liquer made from fermented Millet grain.  Aparently
the stuff is abysmal, but he wants to make some for
a friend who is coming to the US.  


As far as I can fathom, the grain is steeped until
the seed just begins to germinate.  Then it is dried
in the sun, turning often to ensure even drying.
It is then added to enough water to make everything
damp again, and exposed to wild yeast.  It ferments
for a week or so in a vat.  When it is time to drink
it, boiling water is added to the fermenting grain,
stirred for five min, then drank with a straw.


Somehow this doesn't seem quite kosher, but this is 
the best I could do with info extracted from him 
combined with brief info from an old Zymurgy article
entitled "Beer and the Origins of Cereal Grains"


If by any chance somebody knows the real scoop on
this, please let me know.  Otherwise, I'll let you
know how my version tastes in a week or two.
