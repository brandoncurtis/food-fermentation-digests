Subject: homebrew club responsibility question




A question for the homebrew club officers out there.


How do you handle, ummm, "release of responsibility" in your club?  
Namely, if someone gets into trouble after a meeting, you don't want 
the club to be held responsible.  


I'm part of a group organizing a new club in NJ.  Right now, this
responsibility is "understood,"  that is, we're small 
enough that the charter members tend to know this implicitly, and handle 
themselves accordingly.  I'm somewhat concerned that down the road, when the 
club is larger, when we are more active, that something will happen and 
the officers will get their asses burned.


We won't always be meeting in a bar. So we won't always have the 
legal cover that such a place like that provides.


I'd appreciate knowing how people handle this.

Subject: ENOUGH FLAMING ALREADY!


This post is not about beer. It's about the level of FLAMING and HOSTILITY
that's been going on in this journal.


                        ENOUGH IS F**KING ENOUGH!!!


I used to enjoy reading this journal, but the level of hostility
between posters has been pumped up so high, that quite frankly, reading
the journal just plain sucks sometimes!


Is it possible for people to disagree here while still remaining civil
and courteous? Would you talk to this other person face-to-face with the
same disgust and anger that you do on the network? You'd probably go home
with a broken nose if you did! I don't read this journal to pick up 
tension and anger; I think we all have enough to deal with in our jobs
and lives elsewhere. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A HOBBY, REMEMBER???


So let's cool it, huh? And discuss the brewing we enjoy with a little
lighter heart? Thanks.

Tom,


A couple of years ago, I transcribed a list of brew establishments
that I found in the California Celebrator.  The list contained brew
pubs, micro-breweries and supply houses.  At the time, the list was
probably quite complete, but by now it's likely out of date.  I'll
append a copy anyway, as there are hopefully more additions to the
list than there are deletions.  (I'll not append the list to HBD as
it's already in the archives (file 8910.shar.Z).  However, if an HBD
reader would like the list, I will happily entertain mail requests.)


I doubt you'll find much in the way of quality brew *on* Treasure
Island, as it's mostly (if not entirely) a naval reservation.  It is,
however, but a short drive from there to Oakland, Berkeley and San
Francisco, where a number of pubs/breweries are located.  Since the
list is so old, I suggest you call first to see if an establishment is
still in business before visiting.


There is also a "tour" in the Bay Area called BART'n'brew.  BART is
Bay Area Rapid Transit, a train/subway system we have here in the Bay.
I have not yet done this, but there are supposed to be a number of
brew pubs (6?) within a few blocks walking distance from BART stations
throughout the bay.  I'll try to get details from a friend who has
done it.

Regarding storage of pre-crushed grain:  I buy 20 or 40 pounds at a
time, then split it into four-pound bags.  One-gallon Ziplock baggies
are about the right size for four pounds of grain.  I store them in a
kitchen cupboard so they're handy.

How could I resist? I called the San Jose office of the Treasury Department
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and had a pleasant conversation
with Jerome Stayer and Inspector Amy Ulszewski. It turns out that BATF
does not issue any such document as a "shipping permit." They do issue
*operating* permits to breweries, wineries, and distilleries, and it's
possible that this permit is what UPS wants to see. However, Amy said
that BATF has no Federal policy or regulation concerning the shipment
of alcohol by individuals, save that alcoholic beverages may not be
shipped by the US Postal Service. So far as Federal law is concerned,
any private carrier can ship beer anywhere.


Now for the bad news: although there is no Federal policy, there is
a patchwork of state regulations which carriers must obey, and the
Inspector speculates that the difficulty in complying with these
regulations is what keeps shippers out of the shipping business.
(My wife belongs to the Alexander Valley Vineyards wine club, and
we get two bottles every couple of months or so, shipped through UPS!
The box does have a stamp on the front saying "Contains alcoholic
beverages; adult signature required.") Amy suggested contacting every 
private carrier in the book until you find one that will accept the shipment.


So I thanked them very much and called the local Federal Express office.
Big surprise: they won't accept alcoholic beverages from individuals.
A very pleasant and sympathetic fellow read to me from the policy book,
which said (somewhat abridged), "Alcoholic Beverages: Due to various state
regulations alcoholic beverages can only be accepted if processed by 
[some automatic FedEx computer device whose name I didn't catch], or
if they are shipped from one licensed distributor or manufacturer to 
another licensed distributor or manufacturer." Large Fed Ex customers
(>= 10 packages/day) can get a hand-held thingy from Fed Ex for processing
the packages, and it apparently already knows the state laws or something.
The whatchamacallit is free, but you have to have volume to get one.


That's as far as I went today. Anyone else care to run with this?


There's a business oppotunity in here somewhere, but I just can't
figure out where it is. Speculation: could a liquor store or distributor
be conned into providing this service, for a hopefully modest fee?
Perhaps the AHA should negotiate with shipping companies, so that at least
sanctioned events could get policy approval? (Let's ship a case or two
of real IPA to UPS' chairman and CEO.)

Subject: Chlorine (George Fix)


I am somewhat uneasy about the dilute chlorine solutions recommended
in recent posts. These will control  health threating bacteria 
relevant to swimming pools, but I am concerned about the effectiveness
of say a 10-20 mg/l (ppm) free available chlorine (FAC) solution on
bacteria that are relevant to beer. Remarkably, the latter, like our
yeast, are health positive, and the last things one would want to
remove from a swimming pool. On the other hand, they are capable of
turning our beers into pickle juice, and tend to be more resistant to
chlorine than pathogens.


It is my belief based on personal experience as well as data published
in the literature that 100 mg/l FAC is needed to properly sanitize
brewing equipment. In the context of bleach one sometimes sees a 200mg/l
figure quoted, but I believe this refers to the sodium hypochlorite
(NaOCl) content. As noted in an earlier post, the molecular wts. of
Na, O, and Cl are 22.99, 15.999, and 35.453, so the concentraion of
NaOCl is roughly double the FAC. Bleach is theoretically 5.25% NaOCl,
but this can decrease both with age and temperature. I recall measuring
some where the NaOCl content had dropped to 2.5%. Thus, Bob Jones'
recommendation of 1oz. (2T) per gallon sounds like a good figure to
work with. Experience has shown that with 100mg/l of FAC only 15 mins.
of contact time is needed ( and generally usually less).


This subject is somewhat complicated by the fact that if we were 100%
efficient at cleaning, then chemical sanitation could be eliminated
entirely. From 1975-1985 I was on the faculty of CMU at Pittsburg, and
had during this period the good fortune to work on several projects at
the tiny Straub Brewery in St. Marys, Pa. Gibby Straub, who was the
brewmaster at that time, told me that they went from 1933 to 1954
without ever using any chemical cleaners or sanitizers. Never once
during this period did they dump a brew. In fact, they operated at
full capacity during the entire period, and were only one of three
small breweries (say 30,000 bbl/yr. or less) to survive the 1950's
and 1960's. Anchor and Frankenmuth were the other two. When they
cleaned in the old days they really cleaned. Gibby told me that 
their rule was 2 hrs. cleaning for each hr. brewing. In the 1950's
came modern union work rules, and in particular a 8hr. work day. At
that point chemically based sanitation systems became a necessity.


As mentioned in earlier posts I now prefer iodophor to chlorine. 
Something I forgot to mention was that dilute solutions of iodophor
(1oz. per 5 gallons) is entirely satisfactory. Moreover, a 5-10 min.
contact time is adequate. There is another product called peracidic acid
which has become very popular in German breweries. It is a modern
version of vinegar sanitation (widely used in traditional German brewing),
and consists of acetic acid and some hydogen peroxide. The latter seem
more natural to beer than iodine. If anyone has had any experience with
it, or knows where to get some, I would be gratiful for the info.

Here is my list of Bay Area brewpubs, broken down by mass transit transfer
point.  Most of the directional information is pretty general (I don't have
street addresses), but should get you there.  I make no claims of completeness;
this is off the top of my head, and the top of my head is pretty weak when it
comes to the San Jose area (I know that there is a Gordon Biersch and a Tied
House there, as well as a third brewpub downtown; I just don't know where they
are located).


BART:
        Berkeley
                Triple Rock Brewery (Shattuck Avenue, about three blocks north
                  of BART station).
                Bison Brewery (Telegraph Avenue, seven blocks south of UC-
                  Berkeley.  Walk or take AC Transit 40 southbound).


        Oakland Civic Center
                Pacific Coast Brewing Company (On Washington near Eighth Street,
                  about four blocks south and one block west of BART station).
                Tied House Alameda (Take AC Transit 51 southbound to first
                  Alameda stop; walk north to the estuary, and continue west).


        Hayward
                Buffalo Bill's Brewpub (On B street, two blocks west of BART).


        San Francisco Embarcadero
                Gordon Biersch (The old Hills Brothers plant, about three or
                  four blocks south of Embarcadero station on Spear Street.
                  (not open yet)).


        San Francisco Powell/Montgomery
                San Francisco Brewing Company (Columbus Street, between Broadway
                  and Montgomery; walk north on Stockton (long!) or take MUNI 30
                  Stockton).


        San Francisco Civic Center
                Twenty Tank Brewery (11th Street between Folsom and Harrison,
                  about four blocks south of Civic Center station).  


CalTrain:
        Palo Alto
                Gordon Biersch (On Emerson, 1-2 blocks east of University, 2
                  blocks north of CalTrain station).


        Mountain View
                Tied House Mountain View (corner of Villa and Bryant, 1 block
                  south and one block west of CalTrain station).


Golden Gate Ferry:
        Larkspur
                Marin Brewing Company (Larkspur Landing Shopping Center, across
                  Sir Francis Drake from Larkspur ferry terminal).


Note that this is just a list of brewpubs; I've left off microbreweries (only
two--Anchor in SF and Lind in San Leandro--are accessible via transit these
days; Pete's is contract brewed by August Schell, and Devil Mountain has moved
their works from the old Walnut Creek train depot to Benicia) and beer bars.
Hopefully some kind soul will correct my errors and fill in my omissions.

Subject: new staling-inhibiting bottle caps


The AHA has distributed some anti-oxidation bottlecaps to homebrew clubs
and encouraged their trial use.  Recently, I witnessed a comparison
taste test.  Steve Kemp, of Brewers of the South Suburbs (of
Chicago), brewed and bottled a hoppy spiced beer in December and randomly 
capped his bottles with either regular bottle caps or the anti-oxidation
caps.  Last Friday, this split batch was distributed at the B.O.S.S.
meeting for side-by-side tasting.  The anti-oxidant-capped beer was in
no uncertain terms more hop- and spice-aromatic and hop-flavored than
the regular capped beer.  Note that the tasting was not done blindly,
but instead side-by-side, but there was no doubt regarding differences
between the beers.


I have no other information on the bottle caps.  I am a member of AHA,
but have no affiliation with the manufacturer of the caps.

<Ooog, what a diatribe!


<- --Jeff Frane


Jeff is right, Dave and Jenny have done well.  The problem is they charge
an outrageous amount for thier product and they wont sell direct to YOU
the homebrewer (I know, cause I tried hard).  So Jeff is right, capitalism
is not dead and no longer does Wyeast have a monopoly on the market.  They
do have a monopoly on that fancy package that seems to explode on so many
of us (my friend lost $4.50 worth of the stuff last night :-) :-).  So the
market has responded with another manufacturer.  This guy provides the basics,
a Yeast bank (if you want it), and culture media.  Granted, its not as easy
as breaking a seal but, you get what you need for massive cost savings.
Think about it, is 50 ml of yeast slurry out of some package that was sittin
around for how long, in how hot a temperature really what you want to throw
into your seven hour labor of love?  And if you are making a starter, then
how much more effort is it to make several starters and work the yeast up?
That way you know what you have and you can culture your house flavors/
house characteristics if you want to.  Once again, I HAVE NO FINANCIAL
INTEREST IN THIS EFFORT.  I JUST WANT MORE HOMEBREWERS MAKING BETTER BEER
FOR LESS MONEY!  If interested,

I forgot to answer Caitrin's question of HOW to get that great
Cascades aroma.  You're right -- *dry hopping*.  Add a ounce of
Cascades leaf hops (the fresher the better -- they start to smell
stale after six months or so -- even refrigerated) to the primary,
immediately after the kraeusen collapses.  The acidity, alcohol and
very active yeast should take care of any nasties that may be lurking
among the hops.  Just make sure the hops are stored dry so they don't
begin to mildew.  I love dryhopped beer so much that my brewpartner
had a heck of a time talking me out of dryhopping a brown ale we made
(not true to style, you see).
Al.

Liberty Ale from Anchor uses 100% cascade hops. And yes, they do dry hop
it, during secondary/conditioning fermentation.

Subject: Quantity of yeast to use




        The last time I was at Beer Makers, my local brew store, they
sold me some G. W. Kent dry yeast.  I used it to make my beer, which
practically fermented overnight (VERY rapid fermentation; I still let it
sit seven days in the carboy).  I commented to them thusly: "If that one
packet of yeast fermented that fast I could have probably have done OK
with half the packet."  They told me that I should always use the whole
packet, that using half the yeasts in one batch and half in the other
was not a good idea.  "Why?"  I asked.  The answer was on the order of
"just because" ... no real reason.


        So, home brewers of earth -- is there any reason why one cannot
use half a package of virile yeast such as the G. W. Kent English Ale
and save the other half for the next batch?  Inputs appreciated!  Cheers,

Subject: American brewing terminology




As an English new subscriber to HBD, I am finding some of the terminology
used by the transatlantic brother/sisterhood a mite confusing. 
With particular reference to HBD#820, what the hell is 2-row/6-row malt?


If I can sort out what it all means, I'll post one or two of my
favourite recipes in a form that can be understood over there.


Also, I've caught the end of the discussion on using bleach as a 
sanitizing agent. This has probably been said (and shot down in 
flames) here before, but I find the use of any chlorine-based sanitizer
"a bit daft". So, ok, it kills all known germs, but it also kills all
known yeast. Therefore, you have to rinse the equipment. If you rinse
with tap water, you might as well not have bothered to sanitize, if you
use 'sterile' water, you're going to spend a lot of time/money boiling
rinse water.


"So what do you use, you smart-ass limey?" Basically, a strong, warm
solution of sodium metabisulphite acidified with citric acid.
Because the yeast can withstand sulphite ions in low concentration,
you don't need to rinse at all - just drain it off properly. I've
been using this approach for 15 years and have only ever lost two 
batches of beer (due to infestation by a wonderful British phenomenon 
called thunderflies). Sorry if this sounds a bit self-righteous.

Subject: Pilsner Urquell bargain


People living in Southern California or traveling this way might
be interested in a bargain (I think) in Pilsner Urquell:
$4.99/six at the Trader Joe chain.  I had been paying more like
$8/six.  Does this reflect a nation-wide price reduction or is it
just a local fluke?

Subject: Wyeast Starter - DO IT


While one can just allow a Wyeast pouch to puff up before pitching, there
are some problems:
(1) Timing:  it is tough to get the pouch to be at the right place when YOU
             want it to be.  Some brewers have had exploding pouches.
(2) Quantity:  some beers like lagers need a higher volume of yeast to get
               off the starting block.


Making a starter is pretty routine stuff, after a little practice:
[1] sanitize a 32 oz bottle, cork, airlock
[2] boil 50 oz water w/.75 cups light malt extract (I use the dry stuff) for
    30 to 45 minutes or until you have 22 to 26 oz, or thereabouts.
[3] Chill in sink down to 65-75f.
[4] Add contents of pouch.  Shake well.  Put air lock on top.
[5] Leave at room temperature for a day or so.  High krausen should occur 
    within two days easy. 
[6] a sprig of hops can be used if you wish.


Read Papazian
 for his treatment of the issue as well.
