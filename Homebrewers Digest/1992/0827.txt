rember that beer malt has the barly husk still intact thus it would add
quite a bit of bran to your diet.

Subject: Re: Mashing in the Microwave


Tom Haley asked about mashing in the microwave.


The problem with this is that the heating in microwaves is very uneven.  
You would get hot spots which would destroy enzymes and may even burst the
starch granules, which would not get a chance to undergo saccharification
because of a local lack of enzymes.  A microwave chamber would only be a 
satisfactory heat source if the mash were stirred constantly.  Because of 
the more rapid local heating of the microwave, the stirring would be much 
more important than with a heat source.


I've done decoction, infusion, and stovetop mashes.  IMO, the easiest is
the stovetop mash a la Dave Line, unless you have a very large mashing tun,
in which case a single-step infusion mash is the easiest.

Subject: St.Sixtus yeast


     I've successfully cultured the yeast from a bottle of St.Sixtus Ale,
a Belgium abbey ale (although I think it's the version made *outside* of
the abbey).  Delicious ale.  The question is, what yeast have I got?  Is
it a conditioning yeast or (one of?) the main fermenting yeast(s)?  The
aroma from the starter is heavenly (Ha!) : cinnamon, cloves, flowery.  I
can't wait to brew with it.


     Re. light on fermeting carboy:  I was in a kitchen/wine/homebrew
shop recently, and as a demo, they had a fermenting carboy on display,
sitting on a counter, with all the bright store lights shining right on
and into it.  It was for a homebrew class!  Sort of wish I could be there
when they crack into their first "Pepe' Le Peu" brew!

Subject: Batting .250


After almost 2 years of fairly successful brewing, I have falling into
a "infection" slump.  Three of my last four batches have gone South.
The first batch I attributed it to lax cleanliness (the sin of hubris
- -- "My batches never get infected").  The next one went fine, so I
figured I had learned my lesson.  Then the third went bad.  With the
fourth batch I was more careful than any batch in the last 2 years and
still it is infected.


After I calmed myself (I couldn't RELAX because I was out of
homebrew), I started to think more carefully about what was different
about the second batch.  The only thing that I came up with was that
I had used hop plugs for the three bad batches and hop pellets for the
one good one.  I have had successful batches with hop plugs, but I am
pretty sure that these three are the only ones in which I used plugs
for the finishing hops.  Could it be that the finishing hops plugs are
the culprit?  


I noticed that when I toss them into the boil they take a minute or
two to break up (unplug?).  This is also about the time that I stop
the boil.  Perhaps, nasty microbes are hiding in the center of of
these plugs and are not exposed to the boil long enough?  What do say
ye?  Is this a good possibility or a red herring?


Thanks.

i brewed a extract brew this weekend, chilled the wort fairly quickly
with an immersion chiller ( <15 mins), and then poured the cool wort
into the carboy leaving behind a small amount of trub. after about 10
minutes, when i was going to add the yeast, i noticed a considerable
amount of matter (protein?) precipitating out of the wort. i added the
yeast anyway and the matter settled out after about four hours (before
the yeast took off). the yeast have not stirred up the precipitate and
i will rack to a secondary after seven days.
now the questions: should i have let the precipitate drop out first, then
rack into another carboy, or continue as i have been? is this a sign of
poor extract? (john bull amber unhopped)

I once lived in the Central Valley of California and tried brewing
where the summer temperatures soar in to the mid-hundreds.  Well, OK,
the low-hundreds, but it *felt* like the mid-hundreds.  Even our air
conditioned house didn't get much below 80.


My solution was to place the fermenter in our spare bathtub half full
of water.  I made sure the water level was above the wort level, but
below the top of the fermenter.  Of course, this assumes you have
ample air space at the top of your fermentation vessel to prevent the
tub water from sloshing on top of it and possibly leaking in.


To control the temperature of the tub water, I kept a couple of gallon
milk jugs of ice in the freezer.  I would monitor the water temp, and
as it crept up a few degrees from 65F, I would plop the milk jugs in
the tub and wait until it dropped a few degrees below 65.  Then I'd
return the jugs to the freezer and start the cycle again.


Using this method, I was able to keep the temperature within a few
degrees of 65 with only one or two dippings a day.  With the ice in
the tub, the water temp would drop below 65 within about 10 minutes.
Naturally, your mileage may vary...

Subject: Why's this? and culture supplier comment


    First, an interesting thing happened on a batch of India Pale Ale that my
brew partner and I brewed in January.  When we were ready to pitch the yeast,
we siphoned off a sample of the wort to take a gravity reading.  We both have
hydrometers so we took two readings on the same sample.  The interesting thing
is that my hydrometer read 1.088 and his read 1.080.  When we racked to the
secondary, we again took gravity readings with both hydrometers.  Mine read
1.022 and his read 1.019.  When we bottled, mine read 1.020 and his 1.018.
Anyone want to venture a guess as to why there is a difference and why it
lessened as the wort fermented out?  The hydrometers came from different places
and their appearance is slightly different if it matters.


    Second, I would like to thank whoever posted the information about the new
yeast culturing equipment supplier.  It was concise and informative.  Darren
also posted a comment on the supplier as he had received a catalog.  I see
absolutely nothing wrong with either of these posts.  I have obtained a wealth
of supplier information from these pages and it is one of the most useful
functions of this digest.  Relax people.  To paraphrase (the real) Ferris
Bueller, don't be so tight that someone could shove a lump of coal up your *ss
and get a diamond.  Keep the information flowing.  Also, someone mentioned that
a local homebrew supplier was culturing their own yeast.  The Homebrewers'
Store, 1-800-TAP-BREW, cultures their own yeast.  It comes in a vial with a
Teflon cap and costs $2.00 if ordered with at least $10.00 of other merchandise.
It costs $3.00 otherwise.  I have only used it once but I was quite pleased
with it.  The prices are great and $10.00 buys a good deal there.  Even with
shipping to Alabama from their location in Washington state, I find it hard to
beat his prices on most items.  Just another information point.  My only
affiliation is that I am a satisfied customer blah blah blah.

Subject: Sourdough starter




Someone inquired a few days ago about making a sourdough starter from
scratch.  Here is a technique I found in the LA Times, 31Jan91 p. H20,
that worked the one time I tried it (and since then I've just kept my
starter going with water and flour each week)


Recipie:  2.5 oz. Russet potato, peeled and cut into small pieces
            unbleached (organic if possible) white flour


1.  Combine potato and 1.5 cups water in a saucepan
2.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer for 15 minutes.
3.  Pour contents into a glass container and mash potatos with a fork
4.  Cool to room temp
5.  Gradually stir in 7.5 oz flour until it forms a stiff batter
6.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in a warm place
7.  In 6-8 hours it will begin to grey.  Stir vigourously and recover
8.  Taste after 24 hours--should taste like mild cheese
9.  Stir, let stand another 24 hours covered
10. After the second 24 hours it should have a sour taste
11. Stir in 4 Tablespoons of water and 1.25 oz flour
12. Let stand another 48 hours
13. Stir in 4 T water and 3 oz flour until sticky and heavy
14. Let stand until it triples in volume (about 8 hours)--Don't cover!
15. Starter is complete!  Refresh every week by stirring in 1/8 cup
    water and 1 oz flour.  Keep covered, but loosly enough to allow
    gases to escape.


If you want more details, or are interested in recipies, check out
the article in the LA Times.  As I said, this method worked for me
the first time, although the tastes and smells didn't occur at
exactly the times listed in the recipie.  Don't sweat it.  Good luck.

Subject: Thanks You For Your Support


Dear Fellow Brewers,


It's been four days now since I embarked on this odyssey of home brewing
and I think I'm coming to grips with the idea of parenthood.  Thanks to
the advise, guidance, and experience from other brewers, especiallyfrom
those who contacted me directly, I no longer fear that my firstborn will
be deformed.  (Unique, certainly, but not deformed!)


My concerns now are more along the lines of particular methods of
fermentation.  Presently, I'm planning to rack my beer off to a second,
closed fermenter (glass carboy) and store it for about two more weeks
before bottling.  My question is whether or not in the future I should
just stick with a single-staged fermenter.  My primary fermenter now is
a trash-can-like container with a tight lid, but no fermentation lock.
(There's enough space between the beer and the lid that I'm not worried
about the top blowing off, and I'm under the impression that the lid is
tight enough not to allow nasties in, especially with the negative
pressure created inside by the fermentation process, while still allow-
ing those gasses to escape.)


If I use the single-staged method, should I install a lock on the lid
of the trash can, or employ a Barton Union System with a blow-off hose
at the top of the carboy?And if I use the carboy, what's the best
way to get hydrometer readings?  Finally, although I've already heard
from a few others on this topic (thanks!!), what's the best way to use
a syphon for racking and bottling?


Again, thanks to all for your input.  I'll keep you informed.


John

Subject: Further hydrometer question clarification


    One other interesting thing that I forgot to include in my hydrometer
question is that both of our instruments read 1.000 in tap water.  My hydrometer
is somewhat larger and heavier that his and it has what apppears to be lead
shot in the bottom covered by a red substance (glue?).  His has what appears to
be solid lead in the bottom.

Does anyone have a recipe or any insight into recreating the lager
served at U Fleku in Prague? I've been trying to do this but having
minimal success.


Also, I've always thought that ales must be brewed at room temp
in order for ale yeast to work -- isn't that what defined an ale,
warm (rrom temp) top fermentation? Originally I only made ales and
this winter I started making some lagers and in the cold basement they
seem to do very well -- even better than my ales. So, I opine that
room temp is defin. OK for ales.

       Hello.


       Sorry I've taken so long to get back with this. Work has been very busy.
       The recipe for Kumiss is eluding me. I know I have it in a book
       somewhere. As I recall, there was something about putting mare's milk in
       a leather sack (perhaps an old stomach of some animal?) in the sun by the
       front door and kicking it as you went in and out. I'll still look for
       that one.


       Now that we have Jack's bread recipe (which I plan to try next time I
       brew), we have to make beer, make bread with the grains, take any
       leftover bread and make kwas, and take the kwas leavings to make bread
       pudding.


       This is from FOLK WINES, CORDIALS AND BRANDIES by M.A. Jagendorf Vanguard
       Press ISBN 0-8149-0125-5 $22.50. When he refers to yeast and sugar he
       means fleischman's bread yeast and household cane sugar.


       Bread Wine and Kwas


       If you are adventurous in your viniculture, and if you have made it a
       truly exciting avocation or hobby, make a wine of the Staff of Life.


       A wine of bread, a semi-wine I would call it, is very common among Slavic
       people. I have spoken earlier of Kwas. It is a wine, a very mild one,
       containing about 6 percent alcohol. It is very common in Russia, Parts of
       Austria, and Rumania -- in fact, in all countries that have a Slavic
       population.


       To make it pleasing for your use, you will have to add spices or honey --
       unless you develop a taste for its particular sour flavor.


       Of course, the lore of bread runs through the world without end. It was a
       food from the earliest days of time. There are innumerable miracles
       connected with it. There are innumerable references to it in all the lore
       and history of the world. But it is far too great a lore to set down, so
       I will turn to the wine.


       You need:       1 to 2 gals. water
                       2 lemons
                       raisins
                       spices (different kinds, but not too much)
                       1 to 2 lbs. sugar for each gallon of water
                       2 to 3 lbs. black bread for each gallon of water


       1. put the water into an enamel pot.
       2. wash and peel the lemons thinly, and put the rinds into the water.
       Squeeze the juice of the lemons and put that in. add the raisins, cut up
       as well as possible. put the spices (cloves, caraway, coriander, a few
       peppercorns, and any others you favor) into a little cloth bag and put it
       in the pot. bring the water to the boiling point.
       3. dissolve the sugar in the boiling water.












       4. slice the bread and toast it, taking care not to burn it. put it into
       the crock. (if you have stale, hard, whole-wheat bread, it can be used
       without toasting.)
       5. when the water is still quite hot, pour it over the bread. cover the
       crock and set it in a warm place. if you have used good wheat bread, it
       will start fermenting very quickly without any yeast. stir it with a
       wooded spoon every day.
       6. when it has ceased fermenting, let it rest for a few days so that the
       bread settles. then siphon off the wine and clear it.


       It is best to put the wine into strong bottles -- champagne or heavy
       burgundy bottles -- then cork it, wiring the corks. You may get a
       powerful, bubbling champagne, which will force out any ordinary cork or
       even explode an ordinary bottle.


       Bread wine matures quickly, but it is best to let it rest for a year.


       KWAS


       There are many ways of making kwas. The method varies with the locality.
       In Bukowina, a province of Austria where there are many Slavic folks,
       kwas was made with apples and had a pleasant cidery, slightly sourish
       taste.


       I have chosen the simplest of the recipes, and you can try it, making it
       once for the sheer novelty of it. It is modified from a recipe of Harry
       Rubin and Vasily Le Gros, of the Monastery of Our Lady of Kursk, about a
       mile from my farm. The kwas is made at the monastery by one of the monks.


       You need:  3 lbs. stale, well-baked rye bread
                  5 gals. water
                  3 lbs. raisins
                  2 lbs. dark molasses (or honey)
                  1/2 oz. yeast (2 pkgs)
                  1 tsp. whole-wheat flour


       1. Cut the bread into small pieces and put them into a crock or barrel.
       2. Boil the water and pour it over the bread. Add the cut-up raisins.
       Cover the crock well with a tablecloth and let the liquid stand until it
       cools.
       3. Filter it through a napkin or towel, but do not squeeze it.
       4. Pour into the liquid the molasses (or honey); use a greater amount if
       you want a sweet wine. Mix thoroughly.
       5. Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water and pour it in, and also add
       the flour.
       6. Cove and place in a warm room (65 - 70 deg.). Let the must stand until
       it starts fermenting, then filter it. Pour it into bottles, putting two
       raisins into each bottle. After a few days, it should be good to drink.


       At the monastery, the priest makes it somewhat differently, using little
       syrup and no raisins. The result is a very sour drink.


       In Bukowina, small whole apples were put in the water before boiling it,
       and one was put into each glass of kwas when you bought it.

 Amazing what leaving off a quote mark in the subject will do.  This is what 
 yesterday's posting should have looked like.....

 Subject: Nutritional Value of Homebrew
 
 >So, my question is: how nutritious can a homebrew be?  or a good stout
 for that matter? 
 
 I will leave that to the nutritionists.
 
 > how would one go about making a "healthy" beer?
 
 I feel the most unhealthy aspects of beer, homemade or otherwise is the 
 nitrosamine factor.  This is an issue that has been glossed over by the 
 industry and totally cured by some and bandaided by others.
 
 The first step to nitrosamine free beer is to use only malt produced by 
 indirectly fired kilning.  Several companies produce such malt and I buy mine 
 from Minnesota Malting.  One of the largest producers of homebrew malt, Breis 
 uses DIRECTLY fired kilns for all except crystal malt and should be avoided 
 like a plague.  It took about an hour on the phone to squeeze this 
 information out of them.  They would like to talk about anything but 
 nitrosamines.
 
 The next step is to remove all chlorine from the brewing water before it gets 
 anywhere near your malt.  I boil all water before use.
 
 Although the jury is still out on aluminum and Alzheimer's, I would avoid 
 using aluminum anywhere in the brewing process.
 
 If you have a thing about organic food, Minnesota Malting will even provide 
 an organically grown malt.
 
 Aside from those few things, if you stick to Reinheightsgbot, there is 
 nothing else to talk about.
 
 >Least my question be interpreted as anti-bread, let me state for the
 record that i enjoy baking and eating bread at least as much as
 brewing and drinking beer!
 
 Considering the wonderful bread that can be made with spent grain, you have 
 just compleated the circle.

 BEER BREAD RECIPE
 
 I seem to have left out an important detail.....
 
 
 > Roll dough into bars about  2" in diameter and the length of your baking
 > sheets or form loaves for bread pans.
 
           LET RISE AGAIN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR IN WARM PLACE
 
  >Bake at 375 F for 25 min.

Subject: Homebrew Club E-mail Database...42 clubs so far


Greetings, all.


In my quest to get an e-mail address from as many homebrewing clubs in the
US and Canada as possible, I posted a call for folks to send their e-mail
addresses to me.  


The twin goals of this database:  to aid the clubs in recruiting new members
and to promote interclub activities.


So far, I have gotten responses from the following 42 clubs:

===========================


If anyone wishes to contact one of these clubs, please send e-mail to me
with your request (no auto-daemon, I'll be doing this manually).


If anyone else wishes to be added to the database, send me e-mail with
your state/provincial two letter abbreviation and club name in the subject
header (such as "MN/Timberworts")


Note:  I still have yet to hear from anyone in Connecticut (hey Steve Morley,
aren't you out there??), PA, WI, much of TX, and other places where I do know
that clubs are 'thick'.  Even in my home state, just 2 of 11 known clubs
have responded.


Still, it's a start.  I would appreciate it if you would inform members of
your club with e-mail who are *not* on the HBD of this database.


Cheers and beers,


STEVE
