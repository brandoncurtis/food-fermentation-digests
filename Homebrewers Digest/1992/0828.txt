Subject: Starch ferments


I'm afraid to say that I am confused and, consequently, less relaxed. All these
recipes for bread wine, sake, etc, appear to employ starch as an energy source
for yeast, which leads one to question why we brewers are so fussy about
conversion to sugars during mashing. Even the making of bread itself is a 
classic example of something some brewing texts would claim should not work.
Surely the yeasts being employed are not especially different. Are there
enzymes present in rice/wheat flours which do convert starch over a wide range
of temperatures ?

Subject: CAMRA...


As a member of CAMRA, I was a bit disturbed about the comments made in the HBD 
regarding CAMRA Canada.  I sent the two complaints that were logged in the 
Digest (anonymously and with permission) to CAMRA for comment.  Below is their 
reply, exactly as scanned and OCRed. I have added notations to represent the 
logo and signature where they occurred, and have corrected the footer to account 
for the inability of the OCR package to interpret the strange font and color 
correctly. If anyone wishes, I will post the letter I sent to CAMRA as well.


I have been a happy member, and what they say is true - the newspaper (What's 
Brewing) is good, albeit topical. Since I plan to spend as much time there as 
possible, I think it is useful. Those who don't go to the UK may not.


Cheers...Gary

Dear Mr Mason,




Thank you for your letter about CAMRA Canada.








I must point out that CAMRA Canada has no organisational link with
CAMRA UK. We are entirely separate organisations, although we
recognise them as a 'sister organisation' with shared aims. Many
members of CAMRA Canada are also members of CAMRA UK.




I am sorry if people have had difficulties dealing with them.
CAMRA UK is large enough to have a full-time staff, whereas CAMRA
Canada, I believe, is still run entirely by volunteers.




I very much doubt that CAMRA Canada are 'a bunch of swift-talking
con artists'. We understand from individual members over there
that they are having problems at the moment, but I doubt this is
due to any deliberate intention to take people's money.




I'd be grateful if you could publicise the above through the
computer network, for the benefit of those interested.




You might also tell people that joining CAMRA UK costs only
fourteen pounds per year, for which you get our sixteen page
monthly paper airmailed - reliably! Pretty good value, we think.








Thanks for writing.      I appreciate your concern.




Yours sincerely

Subject: Berliner Weisse tasting results


  I went to the Unfermentables meeting last night  (denver area brew club).
I got some feedback on my "Berliner" weisse:


  This was a beer soured a la papazian, except that i added
some acidopholis capsules to the souring mash.  I believe that
most of the souring was due to the bacteria in the capsules.


  Many commented that the sourness was in fact different from
the usual sour mash.  Different, but not necessarily better or worse.
All said the beer was clean, which is unusual for sour mashes,
a good point for my technique.


  Most said the souring (caried out to pH 3.4) was about right on,
although i found it to be a bit too sour for my taste.


  Most said the hop level was about right on (1 oz. hollertau boil).


  The only consistent criticism was a grainy flavor.  This could be
due to many things.  It may just be that letting the GRIST sour
extracted something nasty from husks, etc.  My fix for that problem
would be to sparge, then sour the LIQUOR with pills ONLY, no
raw grain.  I will most likely do this for my next experiment.
I am trying to plate the capsules out now, to try and seperate
bacteria strains out.  If there are any differences i can see
in the colonies, I will sour some wort from a single colony,
and taste/smell the results.  I will use only the most pleasing
sour wort for the next souring.


  Another souring method id to use a prolonged acid rest in the
mash (like 3-5 days at 90F).  One fellow said the best sour mashed
beer he had was made with this technique.


  Now we fall to the discussion with another guy trying to make
a berliner weisse.  he had seen the brewery in germany.
He said they pitch a pure Lactobcillus Delbreuckii along with a 
standard ale yeast.  If anybody knows were i can get a pure
L. Delbreuckii, let me know.


  One other interesting part of the brewery was that they put
the hops in the MASH!  This allows them to use more wheat.
My recipe had little wheat, it was about like:


  5 lbs. pale
  1 lb munich
  1 lb barley flakes
  2 lb wheat malt


  Next time i will try something more like


  3.5 lbs pale
  1 lb wheat flakes
  2.5 - 3 lbs wheat malt
  1.5 is oz hollertau IN THE MASH


  Oh one more thing on the pills.  They do not smell much like
other sour mashes.  I cultured some up in  a test tube and smelled
it.  It has a grainy putridness, but not as strong as a sour mash.
It is possible that the"grainy" cahracter was due to the bacteria
strain.  I will try to see if culturing up from single cells
will yield a clean strain of lactic acid producer.


  And, of course, I'd like to hear about any sour mash/sour
beer experience anyone has had.

Subject: Cold Break


jeorg`at`chs.com (Houck) asked about cold break.  My personal feeling is that
you should try to get as much of the trub as you can comfortably get
(without worrying) out of the fermentor before pitching the yeast.  For some
people, this means that they don't remove any of the trub (I think they
worry too much about infection, but to each their own...).  In general, it
seems that it takes at least 30 minutes for the majority of the trub to
precipitate after cooling (this is based on my own observations).  As long
as the wort is cool (below 70F, is my recommendation), you shouldn't have
too much problem letting it sit in a sealed carbouy for a couple of hours.
NOTE: I did not say that you *can't* get an infection.  You certainly can
get infections, but I've been using this method for a couple of years without
any problem at all.  After the trub has settled, you can rack it off.  I
lose about 1/2 gallon of wort using this method.  I've heard that the wastage
can be recovered by filtering it and using it for priming, but I've never
tried it (a 10% loss of extract and hop utilization is not significant to me).
In actual fact, I cool my wort down to about 45 degrees F and then let it
sit in the carbouy for up to a day before I rack and pitch.  I then use a
non-blowoff method for fermentation.  I've heard rumors that a blowoff method
negates the need for removing the trub, but I find it hard to believe and
have not heard of anyone who has done a side by side comparison.  All I know
is that after I started doing this, my beer has improved immensly (the
improvement was better than going to all grain, or switching to liquid
yeast).  I will go as far as to say that if you do not use blowoff and
do not make an effort to get rid of a significant quantity trub BEFORE you
pitch the yeast, you will almost certainly have a fusel alcohol problem.
(OK, wait a second while I put on my ring of fire protection -- there we
go, flame away!).  I've never used a blowoff method, so I can't make any
rational comments on it (though I do find it fascinating that people claim
that their beer is less harsh using blowoff.  I don't buy the hop resin
argument, so maybe it does have something to do with trub...).  Anyway,
sorry for the length of this post, but this is something of a religious
topic with me...


                Mike


P.S. All unhopped malt extract will produce large quantities of trub when
used.  It is not really a function of the quality of the extract.

No, it's a sign that you did everything correctly, and got the
boil going really good for at least an hour.  With strains of
yeast that take off quickly and vigorously (i.e. most dry yeasts
like whitbread ale/lager, or M&F ale), the yeast will stir up the
trub on the bottom of the fermenter.  with these, you should wait
for the trub to settle, then rack to a new carboy, aereate, and
then pitch.  If you pitch before you rack, when you return to siphon,
it might bee too late (It's impossible to siphon vigorously fermenting
wort - the CO2 released keeps stopping the sipon, and in this
particular case, the chunks of trub will clog the siphon or any
sort of filter you try to put over it).


Most wyeasts are so slow to take off that you are safe pitching
and then racking later.  A friend of mine feels that you should always
do vice-versa, since much of the yeast will settle out with the trub,
but I feel this stuff is mostly dead yeast, and that that the healthy
yeast will stay in suspension.  With a lager yeast at cold temperatures,
It will probably never ferment vigorously enough to stir up the
precipitate, but you are still better off racking, because of
"yeast autolysis" (according to Miller), but I have left lagers on
the bed of trub for months, and never noticed a problem.  Then
again, most of these batches have had polyclar added.


If I fail to siphon the wort from the trub and it gets stirred up
back into solution, I always use a clarifier - usually gelatin,
but polyclar works great at a low temperature, and I always use
polyclar If I feel that a great deal of tannin made it into the boil
in the form of grain husks not filtered in the sparge.

P.S. you will usually notice significantly more hot break in the bottom
of the fermenter when using hop pellets.

Subject: light on fermenting carboy


I recently got a new carboy, and since it came in a box, a method for
ensuring darkness seemed obvious.  I cut a ~2" diameter hole in the
bottom of the box, and now when it's fermenting I just invert the box
over the carboy.  A perfect fit, with the fermentation lock sticking
out the hole.  


I'm sure a little light gets in around the hole, but not much.
Whenever I want to look at the ferment, I can just lift the box.  Very
nice.  The box isn't even ruined for its original use: the hole isn't
big enough to damage its structure, so I could still store/move the
carboy in it.


Anyway, just my $0.02 worth . . .

On the subject of using spent grains in your bread, I am not sure
the issue of proper grinding was made clear.  Any brewing grains
that are not properly ground can crack your teeth (well, some
can).  So, whether you want to put the grains in your bread or
your granola or your cookies, please be sure that there are no
hard lumps left in the spent grains.

Subject:  Heat Yield and Measure Conversion


Greetings,


        I have an electric stove.  Were I to buy a 6 gallon SS stock pot, would
I be able to bring 5 gallons of wort to a boil?  I'm not asking for armchair
calculations, I am asking for empirical observations.  It seems like most people
who mention boiling a large wort also mention doing so with high BTU devices.
If you have boiled 5+ gallons on a regular electric stove, please let me know.
I would hate to invest in a large brewpot and then have it produce only warmish
wort.


        Is there a reference wherein the densities of cooking ingredients are
listed.  I have many recipes that give amounts in mass units.  I do not own a
kitchen scale, and so I would like to be able to convert masses into volumes.  I
am specifically interested in doing said conversion for honey, flour, and sugar.
I realize that densities will vary, but I don't think ballpark conversions are
unreasonable to expect.  Thanks, Mr. Schmidling, for the bread recipe.  I'll be
sure to give it a try.


Cheers,

About a week ago, I brewed a batch of extract/mash weiss bier that was
supposed to make six gallons.  Since I don't have a six gallon *glass*
carboy and didn't want to have any leftover ingredients, I figured
I'd make the 6 gallon recipe in a 5 gallon carboy.  I knew
under-dilution would make for a thick wort, and figured the alcohol
content would be higher in the fermenter than usual, but I calculated
max alcohol content at around 7 percent, so I figured my yeast should
be fine.


Everything seems fine so far, though a bit slower than usual.  The
ferment IS thick, but seems in good shape, and is just finishing
fermentation.  I plan to rack to a 6 gallon plastic bucket, dilute to
approx 6 gallons (proper SG), prime, then bottle.  Has anybody ever
tried this approach before?  As I said, my main concern is that the
higher concentration of alcohol could kill the yeast before it has a
chance to fully ferment all fermentables.  If this happens, I could
end up with exploding bottles.  Also, I thought the higher
concentration might tend to change the flavor of my brew.  Any
thoughts, experiences, etc out there?  I'll be bottling shortly, so if
there's interest, I'll let you all know how it turns out.

Greetings from an exiled US Hombrewer in OZ!


1) I inherited a "hand-held-temperature-compensated-optical 
   refractometer" (whew!) from my wine-making dad.  I've been using it
   for a while now in place of my hydrometer and I wondered if other
   homebrewers have used one.  I think its a great tool since it only
   uses a drop or two of beer (no waste and no dunking in the carboy etc.)
   Mine reads out in degrees Brix (~ percent sugar content by weight I think)
   from 0 to 30 with 0.2 gradations.  Since its weight % I've just been
   subtracting final from initial readings and dividing by two to get alcohol
   % by weight (i.e. 14B-4B=10 10/2 ==> 5% by weight).  Any experience with
   refractometers and a "correct" conversion from Brix to HBD SG would be
   appreciated!  


2) Any other HBD'ers from Australia out there?

When dry hopping, or pouring the wort over beer after chilling, what is the
best way to sanitize the hops to reduce infections?

  Can i make a reasonable choclate or black patent malt by roasting
my pale malt in the oven?  If so... what temps... what times.

Mike Tavis asks: could hop plugs be infecting his beer?


Hops are a natural disinfectant -- I think you may be on a wild goose
chase.  How about your plastic equipment (primary fermenter bucket,
siphon hoses, bottling valve, etc); are they getting scratched up or
opaque?  If so, that could be a source of infection.  How about your
bottle caps or your bottles?  The stopper for your secondary fermenter?


Good luck!  Oh, and about being out of HomeBrew: RELAX -- what a great
excuse to run out and by a 6 of <insert your favorite expensive import
here> :-)

Well, this is it, I finally found a job (with no e-mail facilities
unfortunatly).  Thanks to all for all the useful information that
I have recieved over the years.  I will miss this forum a lot.
As soon as e-mail facilities are and running at my new place, I will
re-subscribe.  Thanks again to all (sigh)...

I had a similar experience using a John Bull Master Class bitter kit.  I got
an amazing amount of cold break about an hour after transfering it to the
carboy and pitching.  This was the first use of my new imersion chiller and
figured that was the reason.   The beer came out clean as a whistle, but still
has a slight amount of chill haze.  Would waiting an hour and then racking off
the cold break cause less chill haze?  Would it be worth the infection risk?

I know this is a bit off the theme of the digest, but it has come up
several times over the last few months.  I've reviewed the literature
on Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as part of my medical education.  I believe
the jury is IN on aluminum, and the verdict is NOT GUILTY.  Several studies
clearly show Al does not directly cause AD.  While it is still possible,
other culprits, namely amyloid acumulation and genetics, appear much
more likely to the cause (etiology, in the vernacular).  The brain lesions
found in AD do indeed contain Al, but the same levels of Al are found in
normal peoples' brains.  Al may contribute to the disease in those who are
susceptible, so the "watch out for demon aluminum" may be valid for those
whose ancestors died of AD.  The rest of us can RELAX!


One of the pieces of evidence supporting the genetic origin of AD is
interesting...Down's syndrome victims have a much higher incidence of
AD than the normal population.  Since these people have an extra chromo-
some 21, the search for the AD gene has focused there.  One attempt has
failed, but the gene can't hide forever.


Sorry for the deep science, but with all the (interesting!) physics
and chemistry that get tossed around this digest, I had to put my $.02
in.  BTW, thanks to those who post recipies; I've brewed two and both
were excellent.  Also, if anyone wants references for the above,
Email me.
