(Hope this isn't a duplicate post)


This weekend I bottled a batch of Pale Ale.  I set the carboy outside
overnight in the cold to cause any additional "stuff" to settle out.
There was about 2 inches of ice on the top when I went to siphon off.
All this doesn't concern me, however,  the beer was _very_ cold when I
bottled it.  When the beer warms to room temperature will it cause
excessive pressure?


Also, have I stunned the yeast with the cold beer and should I worry
about carbonation?  (I have a right to worry; I just drank my last
homebrew.)

Brett of Australia writes >>... I dont know whether they will ship overseas...


I was going to write that US Customs does not permit any plant or meat 
products into the country but then remembered all the European hops imported
here. Does anyone know the regulations for importing hops.

Subject: Dead hops and the cider digest


The outfit that I bought the hops from last year is sending me new plants
this year at no cost.  Because of the limited timeframe in which one is
supposed to be able to buy and plant hops I was just looking for a way
to insure that I had viable plants this year and did not have to go another
season without starting some plants.  I've been assured that this next shipment
will grow successfully.  We will see.

Subject: arf asks about lagers and ales


Here are some generalizations about lagers and ales.


A lager is a beer fermented with lager yeast at lager fermentation
temperatures and then cold-lagered.


A lager yeast, other things equal, ferments some of the larger
molecular sugars.  The end result is a slightly more attenuated beer
that is less sweet and has a "cleaner" taste.


Lager fermentation temperatures are, say, 45 to 55 degrees.  Other
things equal, fermenting at these colder temperatures, provided the
yeast is capable of it, minimizes production of esters which, if
present, would produce "fruity" flavors in the beer.  Fermenting at
these temperatures takes longer, at least for homebrewers.  If an ale
can ferment in 3 to 7 days, lagers can routinely take 3 weeks or more,
provided you've pitched with an adequate amount of starter.
Inadequate pitching, or fermenting at a colder temperature, will prolong
this process.


Cold lagering means quietly storing the beer at cold temperatures, say
33 to 40 degrees.  This helps smooth and finish the beer, and helps
the yeast to drop out.


Another aspect of the "clean" lager flavor is historical.  Before
yeasts and fermentation were fully understood, brewers would scoop the
foam from one batch of beer, throw it into another batch, and keep
fermentation going.  As lager yeasts tended to be bottom fermenters,
they were less likely to combine with or be displaced by airborn yeasts
or other strange microorganisms.


An ale is a beer made with ale yeast at ale temperatures
which may or may not be cold-conditioned.


Ale yeasts tend not to process some of the higher-weight molecular
sugars, resulting in a relatively less attenuated and slightly sweeter
beer.


Ale yeast perform best in the range of 60 to 70 degrees, although some
can work well at slightly lower temperatures.  Especially at the
higher end of the range, esters are produced.  This also varies by
strain of yeast, with some yeasts (Wyeast "American" ale) fermenting
"cleaner" and others (Wyeast "British" ale) fermenting fruitier.
Homebrewers will sometimes make an ale and ferment with "American" ale
yeast in the mid-50s.  On the other hand, many homebrewers have no
control over temperature, and the kitchen cupboard in the summer can
get into the high-70s or more.


Ales can be "lagered," that is, cold-conditioned.  This can help drop
the yeast out.  An example of a "yeasty" ale might be an unfiltered
English real ale, while an example of an "unyeasty" ale might be a
cold-conditioned and filtered German ale (Kolsch or Alt).


In addition to the above broad generalities, there are hybrid styles.
A "Steam," or California Common beer (as "Steam" is trademarked by
Anchor) is a hoppy, amber beer fermented with a lager yeast at ale
temperatures.  Fred Eckhardt describes other hybrid styles, such as
Cream Ale.


Most American "industrial" beers are lagers.  This in itself doesn't
make them bad.  They do tend to generally lack flavor, whether the
flavor be from malt, hops, yeast, or anything else.  One can make
intensely flavorful lagers.  Without getting into the "Best American
Beer" debate, Sam Adams Doppelbock is a good commercial example.

Subject: HBU and IBU confusion


HBU is a recipe dosage.  You take into account the alpha acid content
of the hops when measuring them out for an intended beer style.


IBU is a chemical measurement of the bitterness of the finished beer.
Beer styles have accepted ranges of bitterness.  In general, you won't
know the IBU of your homebrew or a commercial beer without getting a
chemical analysis of the bottle of beer.


What happens in between hop dosage and bitterness of the finished
beer are things like length of boil, vigor of boil, oxidation of the
beer, and so forth.


Taking the above into account, for a given beer, the IBU number is
anywhere from 3 to 4.5 times the HBU number.


You have to try a recipe or formulate one with hop additions, make
beer using as good a process as you can, and taste the finished product.
Then, adjust your hopping up or down.


The Hops Special Issue of Zymurgy has some good articles with formulas
detailing how to guesstimate the bitterness of your finished beer.

Subject: Problems with long ferment--WYeast 1056


Hello.  I don't know if this is relevant to the discussion, but I had
a small problem with 1056 last November (or perhaps December, I can't
remember).  Anyway, my original gravity was 1.068, but it only fermented
down to around 1.028.  This seemed somewhat strange to me, but since I
had not used 1056 for anything with a higher gravity than about 1.050,
I just thought the alcohol tolerance might be low.  The beer tastes great,
though (myabe a little sweet...).  I also made a few cultures of it.
The cultures seem to look a little bit different than the last time I
cultured 1056, but I can't be sure, because I haven't done it in about a
year.  Anyway, the yeast seemed to be fast enough, just didn't ferment
out as far as I expected.

Subject: Anchor Christmas Ales


To any to all:
        Having recently gained access to this wealth of knowledge digest
I have decided to seek help on some questions that have been burning in 
me for some time.
        At the risk of stepping on the recipie creators (toes, feelings)
does anyone know an approximate recipie for either of Anchor's excellent
Christmas ales of 1990 or 1991.  That 90 was oh so wonderful.  Even if 
you only have a guestimate of what the special ingredents were I would
appreciate your input.


Thanks ...      Aaron

INTRODUCTION


This guide is intended to identify the specific areas of knowledge
that are required to pass the BJCP exam.  It is not intended to teach
you what you need to know to pass the exam, but rather to help you
organize your thoughts and identify topics that deserve further study.
The bibliography can help you locate sources for further information,
however there is no substitute for experience.


When you take the exam, be sure to take a couple of mechanical pencils
with extra leads (or whatever you like to write with), a big eraser,
and plenty of lined paper (I prefer graph paper).


A note on spelling: There are no umlauts in the ASCII character set.
I tried using the correct German alternative spelling by putting an
'e' after the vowel.  It seems that it is customary in English to
simply drop the umlaut, i.e.  Kolsch instead of Koelsch,  so that's
what I did in this document.

At the risk of sounding contradictory, the jury has delivered judgement where
I am concerned. Agreed, I would have difficulty discriminating two closely
related varieties, such as Hallertau and Saaz, but no amount of boiling will
disguise a generous dose of Northern Brewer in a pilsener. Goldings I find to
give a very noticeable blackcurrant flavour in light beers. Last year's wild
hops smelt wonderful in a dried state, but were overwhelmingly coarse/sickly
in terms of flavour.

Jack writes:

Ales are inherently fruity and lagers are not fruity.  The lower fermentation
temperatures cause the yeast to produce less of the esters which give beer a
fruity aroma and flavor.  Another flavor component that is acceptable in small
amounts in ale and not in lager is diacetyl -- a butterscotch flavor (try
Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale or Newcastle Brown Ale for a taste of
high-diacetyl ales).  (You can try Orval or St. Louis Gueuze as an example of
very fruity ales.)

According to David Miller in his book Continental Pilsener, there are three
major reasons for lagering: "clarification, carbonation and flavor maturation,"
but adds that the last of these "can be largely eliminated by modern
fermentation techniques," which he describes.  He is not very specific,
however, regarding this "flavor maturation."  One aspect that is clearly
part of what he calls "flavor maturation" is the reduction of diacetyl.
Part of the "modern fermentation techniques" he describes involve methods
to reduce the diacetyl that is normally produced by the yeast earlier in
the ferment and then reduced by the yeast during lagering.  A reduction in
the creation of diacetyl lessens the time needed to reduce it.


Why not filter in stead of lagering to clarify?  Well, Miller addresses this
also.  Filtering will not only remove the yeast, but also proteins which are
essential to the head retention, body and flavor of the finished beer.
As you well know, American industrial beers don't have any head retention
and little or no body, so filtering is simply part of the process of making
beer of the American industrial style.

In my own personal brewing, I don't think it's worth while, but I *like* the
fruity flavors of ales.  I will be brewing lagers this summer in my fridge
just to see if can brew a lager, but not because they are one of my favorite
styles.


> Breweries spend zillions to lager so I presume there must be a reason but as

As noted by Miller, modern fermentation techniques can reduce the need to
lager as long, and filtering also reduces the need to lager, so modern
breweries don't need to expend gobs of money to make lager.

If you've tried liquid yeast and it hasn't improved your beer from dry yeast,
then you've got sanitation problems.  Switching to Wyeast improved my beer
a quantum leap -- no longer was it unmistakably "home brewed"...  in a
double-blind test against commercial English Ales it held it's own.

I think you are directing the blame in the wrong place -- I've never had a
problem with bacterial infection when I've used Wyeast and a recent batch
made with M&F dry yeast did.  If there's a bacterial infection, I blame
environment (dusty basement, etc.) or technique (sanitizing the racking tube
and then putting it on top of the drier, etc.).  This brings up a point I
haven't noticed in HBD: I transfer from kettle to primary and primary to
secondary in my laundry room -- I make it a point to NOT USE THE DRIER
FOR AT LEAST TWO DAYS BEFORE DOING BEER TRANSFER.  The dust that gets
kicked up is sure to find it's way into the beer.

Specifically, american beer (and soda) crown caps work on american
"champagne" (sparkling wine, actually) bottles.  This brings up another
point I'd like to ask everyone about -- do you know where I can get a
capper and caps to fit Lindeman's bottles (they are a bit bigger than
the american crown cap)?

One could write 10 Mbytes on your questions, and I'm afraid
that if I start, I will.  These are pretty complex issues.
I suggest you pick up the All-grain special issue of Zymurgy
(call the AHA at 303-447-0816).  There's a great article on
Step Infusion vs. Decoction by David Miller in it.  Please note
that he fails to mention the down-side of the decoctions:
boiling the grains will extract tannins from the husks which
will increase the astringency of your beer and will cause
chill-haze problems.

Subject: Effects of Light on Beer




        What exactly is the effect of light on fermenting beer?? I am
aware that a 'skunky' smell/taste can be produced if light is allowed
to react with a batch of homebrew, but, at what magnitudes??  The
reason I am posing this question, is that I successfully brewed my
first two batches without any protection from light (ignorance is bliss)
and both turned out fine. The batches were allowed to ferment in a
glass carboy behind a shower curtain in an unused bathroom with a big
window and fluorescent lights. True not a lot of direct light, but
plenty of indirect. The brews were a brown ale and a stout, would the
dark colors have afforded some degree of natural protection?? I have
since fermented with covered carboy's with no taste difference detected.
Any response will be greatly appreciated. If enough interest is
generated, I will post a summary.

If you have any dry malt, that's ideal. I think you need about 30%
more than corn sugar. Extract syrup also works, but I'm not sure of
the proportions there. Just boil some up in enough water to make it
pourable, then use like normal.


I regularly prime with (unfermented) saved wort -- works well.

Yeah, it's a pain. AAUs and HBUs are the same thing, as far as I've
ever been able to tell: ounces X alpha. The problem with it is
that it ignores the quantity of beer (eg: 10 AAUs in 5 gallons will
taste different than 10 AAUs in 10 gallons). That's my biggest
complaint -- it doesn't describe bitterness in a batch-size
independent way. (In it's defense, it *is* like saying 10# grain -- in
5 gallons, or 10 gallons?)


I've switched to IBUs because I can compare with known beers
bitterness like those listed in Fred Eckerds wonderfully useful
(hype!) book, The Essentials of Beer Styles.


I still use AAUs or -- gasp -- ounces when I'm using the hops after
the boil, when their bitterness will *not* be extracted. IBUs are
meaningless there, because IBUs also depend on the hop utilization
based on boiling time.


Hope this helps more than it confuses.

Subject: Pure Dry Yeast?


Would any of you buy liquid cultures if pure dry yeast cultures were 
available? I know I wouldn't. Why don't someone take the next step and
make dry yeast cultures? I would have never guessed brewers would pay
$3.50 for yeast. I suspect we all would pay even a little more for pure
dry yeast. Think of the advantages, more stable, higher pitch rates and no
breaking pouches. I would venture a guess that Wyeast would be out of
business almost overnight. Could it be that complex to take the next step
and vacuum dehydrate the pure liquid culture? Sounds like a good side
business for someone.

I've been receiving HBD for only a few weeks.  With regard to home grown hops,
and hop storage in general, has anyone tried the vacuum sealers for food
leftovers?  Seems to me like an ideal way to minimize oxidation of home grown
hops.

After using Wyeast for around 7 - 10 batches I finally had my first
problem and it is just like the problem Ray had in HBD #836 - the inner
packet would not break. The problem I feel is that there was too much oxygen
in the outer packet, so not enough pressure could be placed on the inner
packet. At one point I had my entire weight (140lb) on the packet and
nothing happened (I was impressed that the outside packet held), so then
I tried to isolate the inner packet at one end and squeeze, but the
outside packet broke. Unlike Ray I used the inner packet in a starter -
hope there is enough nutrient to get it going!


The Wyeast package I used was dated Jan 1 92 - is it possible the
yeast nutrient picked up some sort of infection which made the packet
swell a little more than normal or could there have been just a little
to much oxygen placed in the packet during manufacturing?

          Priming help


Wow.  Thanks to everone who responded so fast on corn sugar substitutes for
priming.  The suggestions came fast a furious for awhile there.  Here's a
summary in order of suggestion:


1) Honey:  By far the popular suggestion; sworn by some as preferable in
general
2) Cane sugar: Some said it would taste a little worse, but not much
3) DME: See past "discussions" in HBD about the merits of this 
4) Brown sugar: Some said this was more appropriate for a Pale Ale anyway
5) Molasses: ditto
6) Corn Syrup: worth a shot
7) Coca Cola: just kidding


As it turns out, the net has come through and someone in my brewing club 
("Hey now-") can "lend" me some priming suger (hmm, how's he going to ask for
it to be paid back I wonder...).  Nice to know the HBD can still show a
friendly face.

Probably you ought to try drinking some good lagers; it's as difficult
explaining the difference between ale and lager to someone who clearly
doesn't understand it as explaining color to a blind man.

If you're ignoring liquid yeast, you can't be looking too hard.

Yes, it's pretty obvious from all the evidence, that WYeast was
responsible for your contaminated beer.  Although you don't believe in
using liquid yeast, so clearly this wasn't the problem with *your* beer.
Hmmmm. 


It really gets your goat that somewhere someone is doing something right
and making a living at it, doesn't it?
