of an editor, or professional counseling.  As an alternative, he would be
doing the list a favor by not sending any more postings.

Jack, the judging of amateur beers is to compare them against commercial
standards.  And, as there are many different strains from Wyeast and other
labs, attunement isn't the issue.  Next week, Goose Island will begin
accepting beers for the national competition.  Why not take a few of your
beers there and enter 'em?  Then, should you win, you'll have done it with
Edme dry yeast.  Now, can we put this issue to rest for a few months?

It comes down to (surprise!) the almighty dollar.  The bread makers, both
commercial and home bakers, are quite happy, I believe, with the quality of
the bread yeasts.  The only lot who desire improvement are the brewers, and I
mean the home brewers.  The commmercial brewers have no need for a quality
dry yeast because they have a good handle on culturing their own pure
yeast.  The homebrewer is the only market for such a product, and until now,
the market is too small for the capital investment risk.  Note that I say
"until now".  It is very possible that work will commence in this area and
produce the pure dry yeast that you seek, but it will take $$$'s.  Are you
willing to invest your hard-earned (or easily-inherited) dollars to this
cause?  Do you believe it to be a viable business?  The government obviously
isn't going to invest the research money (they've got better things to do
with your money), how about you?  All of this is, of course, just MHO.

Subject: Liberty Ale and W'yeast


About a month ago, I asked for suggestions on how to duplicate Liberty Ale.
The following recipe is based on Jim Busch's suggestions. Everyone who
replied emphasized dry hopping and Cascade hops. This seems to have done the
trick.


5.5 lbs light malt extract
 .5 lbs crystal malt
1 1/2 oz Fuggles hop plugs for 60 min. 
1 oz Cascade 30 min
1 1/2 oz last 10 min (added in handfulls every 2 min or so)
W'yeast American Ale yeast
1 1/2 oz Cascade whole hops for dry hopping


The brewing procedure was pretty much standard. Fermented from 1040 down to
about 1010 in two weeks. I dry hopped it in the secondary for 1 1/2 weeks.
Using only whole cascades (apart from the fuggles for bittering), really made
a differance in flavour and aroma of the beer. My best beer ever, and IMHO
better than most beer available in the local store (cheaper too). I attribute
the success of this beer entirely to the use of liquid yeast, or perhaps also
merly to changing yeast. Previous brews were marred by a slight tang, which I
eventually traced to the yeast (thank you Jack Schmidling). The american ale
yeast made all the difference in the world. Everyone should at least try it,
if only in the spirit of fun. After all, thats why I brew in the first place.


My next brew will be similar but I am aiming for an English bitter. I plan to
use the same recipe, only more bittering hops, and subsituting Kent Goldings
for the cascade. I have access to whole K.G.s from British Columbia; are
these any good? Should I adjust my amounts? I am planning on using w'yeast
london ale, any problems with this yeast?


Thanks to all for helping me make great beer!!


Cheers,
Caitrin

    Exactly!  With microbrewed beer rising in popularity (and with this year's
drop in sales of the brewing giants' "product") how long do you think it will
be before AB or Miller or Adolph Coors, etc. "wish to buy a stake in Anchor"
or Sam Adams or Sierra Nevada, to name just a few.  The U.S. brewing giants
have the resources to buy up the competition and would rather do so than 
compete directly.  Too many bean counters telling them that real beer is a
"fad" or only a "niche" market.

    I agree with Desmond here.  I am against any of the big U.S. breweries
getting their hands on a brewery that puts out good quality real beer.  Look
what they've done to their own beer!

    This is it in a nutshell.  Time and again we have heard people describe
touring these megabreweries in awe of their sheer size and resources.  They
easily have all of the tools necessary to produce real beer if they so desired.
But, remember people, you really want clear, piss-yellow, ultra-light rice and
corn beer!  Their market researchers told them so.  People who appreciate beer
true to its tradition do not exist in these people's minds!  I understand that
Miller produces (produced?) an all-barley beer called "Miller Special Reserve".
My cousin works for Miller in Huntsville and he said (a year or two ago) that
they were test-marketing it in larger cities, with the closest to us being
Atlanta.  I saw it advertised the last time I was in Boulder but, with all of
the known good beer around, I didn't get around to trying it.  Anyway, I asked
my cousin recently if we were likely to see Miller Special Reserve in Huntsville
anytime soon.  His reply?  "We're more likely to see the new Ultra-light beer
they're coming out with".  Progress man, progress.

In and of themselves they are good beer yeasts, but they are produced in such

Subject: hop pellets vs whole bitterness


Jeff Miller points out that chopping up the hops will result in
more bitterness in the beer (same boiling times).  This is 
consistent with the fact that the %AA utilization is about 15%
greater for hop pellets than whole hops for equal boiling times.
That is 10 HBU of pellets is equivalent to about 11.5 HBU of 
whole hops.

Subject: roasted vs black barley


There are 2 'roasted' barley grains (not malted) from breiss.
One is called roasted barley and the other black barley.  i have
been mistakenly using roasted barley to add the dry acrid flavor
to stouts for several years.  it is actually black barley that is
principly responsible for this.  black barley is very dark, much like
black patent malt.  roasted barley is lighter much like chocolate malt.
Chocolate malt adds a dark red hue to beer; i'm not sure what color
roasted barley adds, maybe the same.

Apparently not. Not only was Kathy Ireland on the cover of Zymurgy a
few years back, but (hold on to your hats) she is also part owner of
the SLO Brewing Co, a brewpub in San Luis Obispo, CA. She is unable to
publicly endorse her own business because of contractual agreements
with Anheuser-Busch.


Then again, perhaps it's just as well. The thought of a micro with one

truly frightening. Leave the bikinis to the big boys.

Subject: mash/lauter tun, Bud


   I made a lauter tun this weekend out of a 10 gall. cylindrical water
cooler and a stainless steel bowl.  I punched about 50 holes in the bowl
(be careful, the burred edges are *sharp*, ouch!), and set it on a small
inverted plate in the cooler.  Too snug to fit in at first, but a cut
in the rim of the bowl allowed it to overlap, and then it can be made snug 
again.  It worked great!  Pour whole mash and all sparge water right into it, 
let sit for 10 minutes, and let it drain.  Recycle some.  What a breeze! 
Seeyalater Zapap!  I've heard that it's possible to also mash in the cooler.
How is that done?  Seems to me it would be hard to get an even mix, and there's
a fairly large space under the strainer-bowl that would be just liquid, no
grains.  Perhaps that really has little effect?  It would be nice to do an 
infusion/sparge all in one container.....


   What is the difference between Budvar, and European Budweiser?  I ask
because I was just given a bottle of Budweiser from, it appears, Czechslovakia.
Budvar is a different beer, yes?

A description of Wyeast in a homebrew catalog that I have (BREWHAUS,
Knoxville, TN) reads:


 ... "The bag kit contains a small plastic bag of nutrient solution
within a larger bag containing yeast cells in suspension. The yeast 
ferments within the large bag when activated by breaking the inner bag 
of nutrient." ...


If that's the case, then G.C. must either have a dead batch or bathtub 
gin by now. Also, Brian's YEAST was infected with NUTRIENT, and not the 
other way around.


Is any confirmation available yet? Someone affiliated with Wyeast would
surely know.

Subject: No more BudMillCoorschlitz bashing, please!


I've read this Digest for a long time, and have observed the following dichotomy 
consistently time and time again:


"We as homebrewers try to maintain a personna of casual tolerance of others, 
both recipes, techniques, and attitudes. However, this personna has the 
unfortunate habit of loving to hate the large brewers of the U.S."


While I'm not partial to BudMillCoorschlitz myself, nevertheless, these brewers 
are extremely adept at consistently producing classic examples of North American 
lagers. This is a recognized style of beer, (and, BTW, VERY difficult for the 
homebrewer to duplicate), and should be accorded some degree of respect, however 
slight...


I have toured several breweries belonging to the Big Three, and have always been 
impressed with the enthusiastic response of brewery personnel when they find out 
that I'm a homebrewer. One brewery chemist (from A-B, no less!) went way out of 
his way to help me answer a question, consulting with his collegues at other 
brewery locations and calling me back a week later...So much for the Big Brother 
Brewery attitude so often expressed here...


Just because we make our own beer, doesn't mean we make better beer (Ask a beer 
judge!). Besides, how many of us guzzled BudMillCoorschlitz like crazy before we  
figured this homebrew thing out? Think about it!


Flames eagerly accepted. Please forward to post1`at`llnl.gov.

Subject: The Professor on shipping beer


The Spring issue of Zymurgy showed up at my house yesterday.  Besides
having lots of info about the June AHA conference here in Milwaukee,
there was a letter to the Professor (Surfeit?) in which the writer asked
about shipping beer.  The following is an excerpt copied without permission
from pages 55-56 of the Spring 1991 Zymurgy:


Writer: ...(1) I recently mailed some samples of beer and mead to a friend.
               They never got there.  As it turns out, the Mailing
               Requirements Office got it (because of damage), inspected it
               and decided that the contents contained "beer containing 0.5
               percent or more alchohol content by weight as defined in
               Chapter 51 of the Internal Revenue Code."  Well, I knew it
               had to be over 0.5 percent, but I didn't know that anything
               over 0.5 percent by weight was "NONMAILABLE" (their caps).
               It turns out that neither UPS nor any of the other carriers
               I've called will take it either.  So how _does_ one ship
               homemade beer, mead, etc.?
               ...


The Professor: Well, actually, beer is mailable with carriers if it is for
               analytical purposes, or if it is intrastate.  I know New
               York and California, for example, have been able to mail
               order wine and mead, but there are some minor regulations.
               Doing it interstate is technically not allowed if not for
               analytical purposes.  How are you going to ship your brews
               to a friend?  I don't know how you'll do it and frankly I
               don't need to be told as long as your friend eventually has
               the pleasure of enjoying your beer.  Shhhh.
               ...

So I guess they aren't able to offer any practical advice on getting
entries to the regional judgings - I suspect they must be very careful
about suggesting ways around the regulations.  Think I could convince a UPS
counter guy that I'm sending this box to Goose Island Brewery for
analytical purposes?

Hello,
 I've been thinking about brewing a beer that has the most hops possible --
with out getting into the off flavors (if any), dead yeasties, or
contaminations from the hops.


Whole hops or pellets anyone?
Has anybody an idea, or perhaps a recipe?
Is there a limmit to the amount of hops one may add to brew?


There are no flavor qualifications.
I'm looking for a slightly bitter beer, with good aroma, though.


Post or e-mail.  I'll summurize if you like.


Thanks for any help

If anyone has any information, please send it to me too.  One of the
members of the local homebrew club served in South Korea as part of
the Peace Corps.  He has vague rememberances of it (it was > 20 years ago).


On a related note, I sent Charlie Papazian a letter telling about MAKKOLLI
because I heard that CP was writing a book on native beers from around the
world.  Since he never replied to my letter, is Charlie really doing such
a book?

Kathy Ireland is promoting Bud for their St Patrick's day blitz. (Ireland,
get it?) I suppose it makes as much sense as drinking bland American beer 
on St Patrick's day.


Also it does seem strange, not only because she is/was a homebrewer, but
because she was partial owner of a brewpub/microbrewery in California.


Of course she is a model and this is her job. I find Michael Jackson's
commercials for Blitz-Weinhart (?) a little more puzzling.

Did you try making a batch using all 4 yeasts together?  It might make
a difference to the finished product.  I sure wish I had some more time
so I could try some neat experiments like this.

Quick scenario:


1. 20 people enter a homebrew competition
2. 19 use liquid yeast
3. all 3 winners use liquid yeast


Which of the following is true:


a. all the winners use liquid yeast
b. liquid yeast is better than dry yeast


Answer:


a is true
b may be true but cannot be determined from the above scenario.


Stop using examples that prove nothing as evidence that liquid yeast
is better than dry yeast.  It is probably also true that all the winners
at the AHA brewed beer and not wine, but this is not evidence that
beer is better than wine.

Alan Mayman  inquires about the need to proof dry yeast before pitching into
fresh wort.  I used to proof dry Whitbread yeast.  I found out that in fact I 
obtained stronger and quicker starts by dumping the yeast directly into the 
carboy.
