they also have a special mardi gras bock from stoudt's that isn't bad.
just wanted to let you know.


also-  has anyone gotten ahold of the new "phil's lauter tun" yet?
bill at the home brewery was playing around with one he had just gotten in

I too, resent the fact that the Big Boys seem to be working so hard to remove
"choice" from the beer-drinker's vocabulary.  You must realize, though, that
the brewers have a job to do, families to feed, etc.  It's the marketeers,
IMHO, who are doing the dirty work by pushing only the style of beer which
appeals to the largest percent of the populace.  This style of beer also, not
coincidentally, is the style in which folks drink a larger quantity at a
sitting.  I don't know about the rest of you out there, but when I drink a
good hearty homebrew or a nice full-bodied beer of any sort it's usually a
single beer I drink.  It satisfies me without me having to drink 6 or 8 eight
of them (which is the horror of horrors in beer market land).


I guess the real point to be made here is that there are lots of folks
working at the BB Breweries and that, I suspect, a good portion of them are a
lot like you and me.

Subject: Aluminum and Honeymoon


Just a couple of comments.


On Aluminum, I have also heard all the reservations and warnings.  
Recently however, I was able to attend an Advanced Homebrewing seminar 
at University of California at Davis.  The professor running the brewing 
department of the school said that the Aluminum issue had been looked 
into thoroughly.  Aluminum pots, and even adding aluminum salts to the 
brew had no noticeable effect on the quality of the beer.  However, he 
did say that you get what you pay for, and an aluminum pot wouldn't last 
as long as a stainless one, and would require more cleaning...


As for honeymoon, my Webster's (not all Webster's being alike) indicates 
that it's a transliteration of the Old Norse for "hjunottsmanathr" 
(diacritical marks not included) literally of "wedding night month".  It 
will be interesting to see what other etymologies are identified.

Subject: The Big Boys, a different approach.


A post in today's digest reminded me that Coors makes a very good beer in 
the augumn/winter, "Winterfest."  If the big boys started making decent 
beer, with their capacity for stability and repeatability, they'd make 
wonderful stuff.  Now, they don't because they believe the market isn't 
there.  The fact is that they have, wittingly, or unwittingly, created the 
market to be what it is by their ad campaigns.


Though I couldn't prove it, I bet that if they received enough mail asking 
them to make better beers, with specific suggestions and style ideas, they 
might listen.  The place to start is with Coors.  I suggest a letter 
writing campaign asking them to make Winterfest on a year 'round basis.  
I wonder just what they'd do if they received a couple thousand letters 
asking this?  Maybe I'm hoping in vain, but I don't think so.  It might 
take fifty thousand letters, but we ought to be able to generate that 
volume if we put our minds to it.  


While I'm one of the first to bash the biggies for their beer, I am coming 
to think that we homebrewers cannot afford to garnar their ill will.  It 
seems to me that we are in a position to put a lot of pressure on them to 
make good beer.  For starters, does anyone have Coors address and the names 
of a few top execs?


I don't think for a minute that Coors, A-B or Miller would make good beer 
if they didn't think there was a market for it, they aren't in the business 
for the art of brewing, but the profit motive can be used in both 
directions.  I'd like opinions of others on this, am I spinning my wheels, 
or is there a chance?

Subject: hop roots by mail


I thought I'd add my two cents worth on hop roots by mail.  Last
weekend I got my hops in the mail from Nichols Nursery in Albany
Oregon.  The roots arrived surrounded by a thick layer of moss to keep
them moist, each individually wrapped in butcher paper.  They sell
four kinds of roots: Tettninger, Willamette, Cascade, and Nugget.  The
roots came with detailed instructions on how to plant and when to
harvest.  So this weekend I was busy getting my hands dirty putting
them in the soil.

Subject: Liquid vs. Dry Yeast


My $0.02 on the matter of liquid vs. dry yeast:


Everyone sez the biggest difference is in contaminants in the dry yeast.
I brewed a dozen batches at least with dry yeast (Munton & Fison Ale) and
had no contamination problems. I use standard sterilization techniques.


My reason for switching to Wyeast was that every ale I made, no matter the
style, had the same subtle "bad taste" running through them. Now, it's hard
to quantify or describe that "bad taste", and I fear that by describing it
as "cardboard" or "cloves" I'm going to open that whole way-too-long flame
session about oxidation again. Suffice it to say that when I switched to
liquid yeast, the bad taste went away. Completely.


I don't believe it to be oxidation-related, or anything else for that matter,
because nothing in my technique changed at all. Except the yeast. I was 
often disappointed by the off-flavors in my dry-yeast ales, and no longer
have that problem, so I'm convinced liquid yeast has made the difference.


Maybe contamination in the dry yeast was the culprit?

On the question of Why Yeast? Wye Not.


That's to say: it's pronounced Why Yeast. It is, in fact, a regional
pun, because Wyeast was the local Indian name for Mt Hood, which one can
see from the window of the lab and which appears on the label.  As one
person has commented, though, it's kind of like calling your business
Yahweh Yeast and I'm sure there are a few people around who consider
this use of the name sacriligeous.

Subject: more questions


Dear Brewers,


I have a few more questions about wort preparation.  First, I've seen
the phrases "cold break"and "hot break" periodically here in the HBD
as well as in other published recipies.  What do these phrases mean?
As a beginner (relying largely on extracts and luck...) are these
terms things I need to know now, or when I attempt more elaborate
recipies?


My next questions are a little embarrassing to ask.  I am attempting
my second batch (brewed last Sat. eve.), relying somewhat loosely on
Bravery's recipe for "Super Strong Ale."  I should emphasize the
"somewhat loosely" here.  The recipe calls for 3 lbs of dark extract
(I'm using approx. 4 lbs of nut brown ale extract); up to 2 gals of
water {??} (I'm using about 2.5); and 2.5 lbs of demerara sugar (I'm
using about 1.3 lbs. light brown sugar mixed with approx. 1.5 lbs
corn sugar).  I boiled for 25 min., sat the boiler in a tub of cold
water until the temp. fell to about 65 F. (about 30 min ?), siphoned
into 5 gal. carboy (which will act as single stage chamber), pitched
(dry) and set it out on the back porch under the beer-box.  I've sinse
moved it twice (agitating it a bit ?), and it is now fermenting in
the pantry at approx. 75 F.  The O.S.G. was *REALLY* high (just over
1.1  {panic begins to set in}) and the taste was as sweet as syrup!


My concerns now are 1) there appears to be whiter/paler areas in the
fermentataion foam (infection?); and 2) will the extraordinarily high
OSG mean that I'm brewing some God-aweful monstrocity? Or that Bravery
really means that this is a "Super Strong" ale?  I don't want to brew
a high-octane furnature polish remover, but I'm afraid that's what's
happening.... Oh yeah, there's also a sediment at the bottom of the
chamber, and I think it might be the brown sugar.  Fermentation is
going well enough.. almost too well!  Is there a peak %-age where
alcohol production ceases?  ANY insight is grately appreciated on
this one!!


My firstborn is due on the 17th, but I snuck a peek last Sat. (to assist
me with this next batch, of course).  I must say that I'm a little
disappointed with the carbonation, though.  Then again, maybe it was
still too early to tell?  Any insight?


Thanks, and Happy St. Pat's to all!

From: Tom Bower <bower`at`hprnlme1.rose.hp.com>
Subject: Dry Hopping, Ale Yeast Fermentation Temps


Recently a friend and I made a 10-gallon batch of ale which we split into
two large carboys and pitched with different yeast starters: the first, with
re-used WYEAST British Ale from a previous batch, and the second with some
SNPA yeast (started from a six-pack worth of bottles...YUM!).


Questions for the HBD'ers:


1.)  I want to dry hop.  I was going to throw an ounce of whole Cascades into
     the carboy after the krauesen (sp?) falls.  If these things are floating
     around loose, how do I rack to secondary without plugging up the siphon
     or leaving a bunch of beer behind?  Is it possible to put the hops into
     a sanitized hop bag or something? (Then how do I get it into the mouth
     of the carboy!?)  At least in the 7-gallon carboy I've got plenty of
     headroom for it.


2.)  The two yeasts I'm trying are behaving rather differently.  The British
     yeast (maybe because it was re-used and started with a greater population)
     took off and fermented vigorously, even at my basement temp. of 57 deg. F,
     while the SNPA yeast was extremely slow.  In fact, I even went and got a
     pack of WYEAST #1056 (American Ale, which I read here IS the SNPA yeast)
     and pitched that as well when I still had almost no activity after 2 1/2
     days.  I suspect that the temperature is a bit on the cool side for this
     yeast; does anyone have know what the "ideal" temperatures are for these
     little buggers?  It's now been 4 days and the British yeasties are still
     popping, lots of CO2 and rollicking yeast motion in the carboy, while the
     SNPA guys appear to be working but much more slowly.  So far, no sign of
     contamination, just vastly different fermentation rates at this temp.  
     Both carboys were at equal temperature, both were agitated to oxygenate
     the cooled wort...the only visible difference at pitching time was that
     the British batch had more trub in the bottom than the other.
     
In the meantime, I'm just not worrying, and looking forward to trying these
two ales which will be the same except for the yeast they were fermented with.


Any comments from others with experience using these yeasts or with the
mechanics of dry-hopping will be appreciated!

        About those 5-gal stainless steel pots on sale at Ames,
one of the reasons they're so cheap may be that they aren't

Have you ever cooked tomato sauce in a highly oxidized (read: almost
black inside) aluminum pot?  After cooking, the inside of the pot

sauce.


Wort is acidic.  (Is it as acidic as tomato sauce?  Don't know, never
did a Ph test on tomato sauce!)


How much aluminum (or aluminum oxide) gets into the wort?  Don't know
that either.


But when you consider that parts per million of substances like sodium
and magnesium salts have a definite effect on taste and finish,
wouldn't you rather that your brewpot *not* contribute anything to the
flavor of your beer, particularly a metallic flavor?

Funny, me defending A-B, but they did make an attempt to market a Dark
beer a while back.  (Can't remember if it was marketed as Bud Dark or
Michelob Dark.  I think it was the latter.)  They even had a television
ad campaign (which I loathed), wherein Martin Mull mouthed lines like
"Some people think that dark beer is only for people named Gunter with
thick necks...", or words very much to that effect.


The slogan was "Don't be afraid of the Dark", accompanied by appropriate
"spooky" sounds, like wolves baying.  Typical marketing pap.


Sure made it sound like A-B's marketing people didn't think the average
American beer-drinking public was ready for it, though.


(Not that it was anything special, anyway.  It had more flavor and
mouth feel than Bud, but 1) that's not hard to do and 2) it wasn't a
particularly wonderful flavor, either.  Certainly no competition for,
say, Beck's Dark or Heineken Dark.


I don't even know if they still market it.

Subject: A weird story


        Here's a weird story I heard from a source that I
would normally consider very reliable. According to this
guy, you can stop a bottle of beer from losing carbonation
by sticking a silver spoon down into the neck of the bottle
(thin end first, I suppose). He says that this was real
common when beer tended to come in big bottles and
families tended to have a lot of actual silverware around.
Indeed, that one of the outcries associated with the rise
of stainless steel was that this trick no longer worked.


        What do you think about this? He says the silver
"bonds" with the CO2 in some way as to create a "vapor
lock" that stops the CO2 from escaping. I would dismiss
this as total hogwash except that as I mentioned, the
guy is usually really on top of things. He swears up and
down that you can drink half your beer, shove a silver
spoon in, and drink the rest tomorrow.


        Anyone else heard anything about this? I have
a silver carving set that barely fits my carboy neck,
but nothing else of silver, so I can't try it.

Subject: Streak plates & purity


        I've been noticing alot of people talking about plating out Red Star 
Ale Yeast to determine its purity.  The most recent posting mentioned having 
found 3 out of 1000 colonies being bacteria and many of the yeast colonies 
being slow growing.  This lead the person to not worry about contamination of 
the yeast.  The problem here is threefold.  First, the media used is 
presumably selective for yeast. This means that there may be alot of bacteria 
in the yeast that simply won't grow well on it.  Second, bacteria as a rule 
grow much faster than fungi (including yeast)  That means that 3 bacterial 
cells stand a fair chance at overrunning 997 yeasts.  Third, are the slow 
growing yeasts.  the chance that they are mutants of the correct strain is 
low, otherwise they would be found to some extent on the plates streaked with 
the strong colonies.  The mutation rate is not high enough to produce that 
number of mutants in a supposedly pure culture.  This doesn't worry me as much
as the bacteria though because the fast growing yeast should overrun the slow 
growers.  I would be interested to see the results if someone were to plate 
the yeast on media selective for bacteria such as TSA or CBA.  Brucella agar 
incubated anaerobically would also be interesting.  By the way, I'm just 
putting forth my opinion and suggesting an experiment, so please nobody 
mistake this for some kind flame.  Sorry if I sound paranoid.

Subject: yeast culturing


Can anyone and everyone who has experience with yeast culturing please send
me detailed info on the process.  I am interested in all aspects and every
level from the simplest homebrew processes to the most elaborate brewery
techniques (at least those used by micros and brewpubs.)  I have had a basic
microbiology class in college, but I need specifics such as media recipes
for stock culture maintainance and media recipes for selection and separation
of bacterial contaminants and wild yeast identification.  Also, does anyone
know of a book or article describing the aforementioned subjects with regard
to microbrewery applications?  I have access to a small incubator and also to
a small autoclave, plus incidental equipment.  Eventually, I would like to 
develop a standard procedure for stock maintainance and purity analysis for
homebrewers who are courageous enough to venture into this realm.


Thanks very much,

 I had habitually re-hydrated yeast in a small amount of wort until I went to 
 my first CBS meeting where I was told to re-hydrate with plain, sterile 
 water.
 
 This seemed absurd to me because of previous experience with bread yeast but 
 after trying it and getting vigorous ferment within an hour, I have become a 
 believer.
 
 Just to refresh my data base, I put some bread yeast in 100 ml of warm 
 sterile water last night and absolutely nothing happened aside from disolving 
 the yeast.
 
 It seems apparent that EDME (I can't speak for any other) contains a 
 de-hydrated nutrent/starter in the yeast mix and bread yeast does not.
 
 Does anyone know if I got this right and if it is true of all dyr beer yeast?
 
 
 >From: R_GELINAS`at`UNHH.UNH.EDU (Russ Gelinas)
 
 > If the yeast is in the outer Wyeast packet, then why not just cut it open 
 *wihout* ever breaking the inner seal, and just make a starter yourself? 
 
 I find it incredible that, with all the expert opinion on Wyeast, this very 
 fundamental question is still floating around.

 >I have been getting a low yield out of my grain and I expect it to be in
 my sparging. The malt ingredients are :
 
 8 lb klages
 1/2 lb crystal
 1/2 lb munich
 
 >I do an infusion mash for about 45 minutes in 2.5 gallons water. The iodine
 test shows full conversion. I then dump the whole mess out to my ZapPap
 lauter tun. I then slowly pour in my 4 gallons 170 degree sparg water,
 keeping the level of the water above the grain bed. I open the tap on
 the bottom bucket all the way and the water dumps through in about 15
 minutes. 
 
 Don't know what a ZapPap is but my first suggestion is to use boiling water.   
 If you take issue with this, I will be happy to repost my study on infusion 
 water temp.
 
 Secondly, it may be a momily but, most experts recommend about 15 min per gal 
 as opposed to the whole batch.  Cut the flow rate.
 
 >My sg after my 45 minute boil is only 1.032. This seems to be way to low
 after looking at various recepies. 
 
 Not too shabby but there is room for improvement.
 
 Your short boil time would indicate that you are not concentrating the wort 
 much and this is one of the objectives of boiling.  You can get at least 10 
 gallons of wort out of 9 lbs of grain if you use 1.010 as the low end cutoff.  
 If you boil the ten gals down to 5 gallons, you will substantially increase 
 the yield.

Subject: More on Red Star


The plate of Red Star ale yeast I plated 10 days ago still has few
bacterial colonies (up to 7 out of 1000 now), but it is covered with
evil-looking _molds_, about a dozen Penicillium-like ones (white and
blue and fluffy), and an absolutely disgusting slimy brownish one. This
plate looks worse than any that I have ever seen! 


The pure colonies on the other hand continue to grow nicely, and have
not given rise to any petite mutants after two restreakings.

Hello,
I will be attending the AHA '92 conference in Milwaukee with another
member from our local homebrew club (Oregon Brew Crew), and was wanting
very much to cut down on expenses. Would any brewers (or non) in the
Milwaukee area be willing to put a few fellow brewers up, perhaps in
exchange for the same at the upcoming Oregon Brewers Festival?
I would greatly appreciate it. The conference fees are $220, the flight
will be 200-300, and the ... We can guarantee a six pack of homebrew
to sweeten the deal. Any takers?

Subject: The homebrew FAQ...a few modest suggestions




The current FAQ (created by Kurt) is a great start, but needs to be
expanded greatly. Some topics that seem to come up over and over again,
which should be addressed in greater or lesser detail by the FAQ:


 - What are the differences between different styles/brands of yeast?


 - What is a minimal list of equipment to get started brewing (extract)?


 - What is 'all-grain' brewing? Why should I consider doing it?


 - What are the differences between various types of barley (2-row, 6-row,
  Klages...)


 - What kind of equipment do I need to start kegging my beer? Where can I
  get it?


I could go on and on, but for now...while it is still small, you should also
consider organizing the FAQ by sections, as it is kind of randomly un-
organized at the moment. Given what's there so far, I'd suggest:


 - Introduction (how is beer made, etc)
 - Brewing equipment and suppliers
 - Brewing techniques
 - All-grain brewing
 - Recipies and sources (Cat's Meow, etc)
 - Resources/clubs/literature (AHA, Zymurgy, Papazian, etc)
 - Net stuff (what is the HBD, etc)


Also, you might watch out for assuming that *everyone* has access to ftp
archives and the like. Many of us are at leaf sites and can only dream of
that kind of access that you kids [ :-) ] at institutions of higher learning
take for granted. If other sources are available, you might want to list
them also.


A great start; let's work together on it and then we, too, can smugly answer
questions with the infamous "Look it up in the FAQ!"
