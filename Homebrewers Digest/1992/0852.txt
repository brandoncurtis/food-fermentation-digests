One of my favourite blended brews is Greene King's Suffolk Strong Ale. It has a
gravity of around 60, a clear ebony colour, and a very distinctive port
characteristic. Dave Line gives a recipe which basically involves blending 2
gallons of a mature barley wine with 3 gallons of new pale ale. I can't say
that I've tried it, but I am dubious of obtaining the port note by his method,
as most barley wine does not possess this characteristic. The bottle label
states that wood aging is employed, and I am wondering whether GK use discarded
port casks. Either that or the yeast could be special. Ideas anyone ?

                        EASY MASH 4
 
                      (Another Sequel)
 
 
 This was originally posted leaving out a lot of details, 
 some of which were filled in by the Sequel.  This edition 
 further simplifies the process and leaves out unnecessary 
 steps.
               ........................
 
 As I intend to produce a new video on all grain brewing, I 
 would appreciate any and all CONSTRUCTIVE comments.
 
 My intent was to develop an all grain process that reduces 
 the cost and effort to the minimum while producing a high 
 quality beer.
 
 As I have the same aversion to plastic as I do to aluminum 
 and to keep within the budget of most hobbiests, I decided 
 to base the system around the old enameled 8 gal kettle that 
 grandma used for canning.
 
 The same kettle is used for mashing, sparging and again 
 after dumping the spent grains, for the boil.   It is never 
 lifted full so the problem of handles falling off is not an 
 issue.
 
 A few simple mods are required to make it fit the process.  
 A small brass spiggot is fitted to the bottom with a short 
 piece of pipe extending several inches toward the center on 
 the inside.
 
 A small piece of window screen is rolled several times 
 around the pipe and secured with a hose clamp or twisted 
 copper wire.   The screen roll extends several inches past 
 the end of the pipe and the last inch is bent over itself to 
 prevent anything from entering the spiggot that has not 
 passed through several layers of screen.   This simple 
 expedient eliminates the need for the traditionl "false 
 bottom" with a zillion holes and seems to prove that simple 
 is frequently better.
 
 Mashing is begun by "doughing in" 3 gals of hot tap water to 
 8 lbs of milled (2 row/6 row) malt.  When thoroughly mixed, 
 apply heat to the kettle and bring the temperature up to 
 155F.  Stir regularly to prevent scorching and to distribute 
 the heat.  When the "strike" temp is reached, reduce the 
 heat and stir occassionally and maintian 155F for 60 min.
 
 After 60 mins at 155, crank up the heat and continue 
 stirring until 175 degrees is reached.  Hold this temp for 
 15 mins, then turn off the heat and let it rest while 
 heating water on another burner.  If you have control over 
 the hot water heater, you can get it almost hot enough out 
 of the tap.   
 
 The level of wort in the kettle should be about an inch 
 above the grain when it settles.   Lay a small bowl on top 
 of the grain to distribute the sparging water and minimize 
 the disturbance of the grain.  The edge of the bowl must be 
 kept below the water level.
 
 Open the spiggot just a trickle and run the wort into a cup 
 or jug till it runs clear.  This typically takes less than 
 one cup.  Pour the turbid runoff back into the kettle 
 (bowl).
 
 The object of sparging is to extract as much sugar from the 
 grain as possible.  The longer it takes, the more efficient 
 the extraction.  Adjust the outflow so that it takes about 
 20 min to obtain one gallon.  Add the boiling water as 
 necessary whenever the level drops near the rim of the bowl.
 
 The first runoff should be about 1.080 and you quit when it 
 gets below 1.010.  The total blend will produce 6 to 7 
 gallons at about 1.030 which, after boiling will yield 5 to 
 6 gals at 1.040.
 
 The seven gallons of wort will just fit into the kettle for 
 the boil but it is best to start with about five and add the 
 rest as evaporation makes more room avaiable.  A minimal one 
 hour boil will evaporate about a gallon so you can play with 
 the volumes in various ways.  You can increase the gravity 
 by more boiling or boil less and have more beer.
 
 Add half of your hops as soon as boiling begins.  Save one 
 forth for the end and the remainder at regular intervals 
 during the boil.
 
 After the boil, it is tapped into the primary after cooling, 
 either overnight or with a wort chiller if you have one.  I 
 actually draw it off a gallon at a time so that I can shake 
 it vigorously and "glug " it into the primary to oxygenate 
 it prior to pitching yeast.
 
 The rest of the process is just like extract beer.  The only 
 difference is that it will take longer for the beer to 
 clear.
 
 The kettle seems to be universally available for about $35 
 and the rest of the stuff can be had for less than $5, 
 making it a pretty inexpensive system.
 
 For those afraid to try all grain, I can simply say that 
 (for me), the quality of my beer has made a quantum leap 
 forward and it was like falling off a log.
 
 I do not doubt that some people can make good beer with 
 extracts but I can now honestly say, I don't think I ever 
 did.  All grain brewing takes a bit more time and effort but 
 the satisfaction is immence and dollar-a-gallon beer is also 
 no small part of the compensation.

   Dan Strahs asked about homebrew seltzer.  I have done this.  It works
fine.  Use about 2-3 tbsp sugar/2 l.  Perhaps more.  I added some
lime juice for flavor.  a pinch of champagne yeast.  I also used
2 liter plastic bottles.  When the bottle gets hard, refrigerate.
If the bottle goes flat, leave it out until its hard again.

Martinelli-brand are not only cappable and strong, but carry a

Perhaps there IS a problem with your sparge technique, Jack.  I always
brew all-grain, and I've never had a haze problem (except for the one
time I used Irish Moss, ironically).  You might, just in the interest
of science, try lowering your sparge water temperature on a batch and
see if that helps the clarity.  Much of the haze could be unconverted
starches that will settle only reluctantly.


I could be wrong, of course, but I do know about my own beers.  I've
never used sparge water hotter than 170 degrees.

I just recently read an article about dry beers in "All About Beer" magazine.
The article stated that dry beer was invented in the early part of this
century in the U.S.  The process involved removing the barley husks before
the mash, a very expensive process.  The Japanese picked up this process a
few short years ago and made it profitable (it's like deja vu all over
again).  Anyway, the concept caught on again in the U.S., but I'm quite sure
that the big U.S. brewers don't remove the husks from all the barley before
brewing (the Japanese probably don't remove it all either).  Anyone have any
more details about the "dry beer" phenomenon?

Subject: Chiller-less cooling




All this talk about fancy wort chillers has got me wondering (but still 
relaxing) if my chilling method is too casual.


After the boil (malt extract and seperate hops) I have ~2.5 gallons of 
wort.  I put the stainless steel kettle in the sink in the garage.  
I fill the sink up to the wort level and add six ice trays of ice cubes.  
I stir the ice water every five minutes.  After 15 minutes I dump the 
water and repeat.  


After less than 30 minutes the wort is down to 100 degress F.  I combine 
with 2.5 gallon of off-the-shelf "purified water" that has been in the 
deep freeze for the brew session (~2 hours).  The mixture is then 
very close to 70 degrees F so I pitch.  I don't use the blowoff method and 
rack to a secondary after 2 to 5 days BTW.


My concerns:  


1.  The garage sink is not very clean.  I do keep the lid on the kettle 
at all times except when measuring the temperature.


2.  Perhaps I should add the hot wort and cold water to the plastic 
primary fermenter and pitch the next day when the mixture is down to 
the correct temperature.  Wouldn't this give more time for infection to 
get into the beer before fermenting takes over.


3.  An immersion chiller would take another large pot for sterilizing.  
Or do folks pour the wort into the primary and boil the chiller in the 
wort cook pot.


How silly am I being with my methods?  I'm on my ~seventh batch and am 
almost able to make a resonable tasing beer everytime.  I'm concentrating 
on getting a good process and experimenting with various recipes sold 
at the local brew store before moving to more complicated methods.

I was in Poland last summer, and drank a fairly large amount of beer.
I believe almost all the beer sold in Poland is of the style Dave
Miller calls "Northern European Pilsner".  They frequently will have a
local beer for cheap, and charge a premium for an imported German
beer.  (Beck's is common.)  The one place I did A-B comparisons, the
German beer was draft, and had noticeable hop aroma; the local beer
was in a bottle and had about the same hop bitterness, and I would
guess Original Gravity, but no hop bitterness.


None of the relatives I visited was a brewer, but they did discuss
(but not demonstrate) some post-brew "recipes" involving adding honey
and hot water.


One of the older relatives that I didn't have a chance to talk with
used to make various distilled liquors (we called them "Uncle Kazik's
hooch") using various fruit and honey as fermentable material.  I'm
not aware that he ever made beer.  My Grandmother had made fruit
wine's in her adolescence on a Polish Farm, without using fermentation
locks or commercial yeast, or any of the "modern" technology we take
for granted.


There is also a kitchen tradition of making things with fermented rye
bread.  My Cousin Barbara (the best cook I visited) made a dish which
combined the fermented rye bread with some kind of organ meat (I don't
remember the details) in a casserole.  Of course it was baked, so it
didn't end up being alcoholic.  There has been a recent thread here of
kvas recipes, which you might want to look at.

  Bottle terminology.
Is there some confusion out there about returnable vs. reuseable bottles?
It was my understanding that the returnable bottles, from my neck of the woods,
were the same as the non-returnable bottles, from the land of
no-bottle-deposits.   And that both these bottles were different (read not as
heavy or strong) as reuseable bottles (often refered to as bar bottles.)


Is this general confusion, regional confusion, or just plain-old-confusion on

I make carbonated water as a first step in my soda pop recipe, with

However once I add rootbeer or cola flavouring, it masks any off flavours,

Most of the judges I know use copper immersion chillers, none has

fact that brewers, both big and small, have and continue to use
copper boiling vessels, which if copper conmtacting hot wort were

I'm not a chemist (in fact, barely passed Chem in college), but I can't
see how a copper tube can add anything but copper to your wort.  You
should cool your wort as fast as possible for two reasons: 1) the sooner you
get to pitching temperature, the sooner you can pitch the less time
wild yeasts and bacteria have to take hold in your wort, and 2) while
the wort is dropping from 212F to 140F, DMS is being produced (DMS will
give your beer a "cooked corn" taste).


>Does anyone else share the view that copper will oxidize hot wort?  He says

SS is good also, but I don't think there's any problem with using copper
and a *lot* cheaper than SS.

Big deal -- releasing CO2 is not an issue.

Another no-op.  The yeast doesn't care.  Transfer of beer will, indeed,
introduce some oxygen -- I agree.


>The only time one should rack to a secondary is for a long ( > 1 month)
>cool lagering.  Otherwise, a single-stage fermentation is sufficient.


Yes.  I agree here also.  I have been using single-stage for virtually
all my ales for the last few years.  I am considering going to two-stage
to see if it makes a difference.  My plan is to compare:


1. single-stage + no blowoff
2. single-stage + blowoff
3. two-stage + no blowoff
4. two-stage + blowoff


The reason I plan to use the two-stage is to get the beer off the trub.
Even though I use a chiller and lately have been waiting for an hour
after bringing the wort down to 70F to transfer to the primary, I still
get a lot of trub after a day or two.


If you are lagering, or if the ferment is being done at a very low temp
(i.e. you will have a long ferment) you should rack the beer off the
trub and dead yeast before autolysis sets in.


>Does anyone share this view, or care to dismiss it?  Recent discussion about
>dry-hopping indicate that lots of people regularly use a secondary.


Not necessarily.  I simply dump my dryhops into the primary after the
kraeusen falls - after a day or two, I swirl the carboy to wet all the
hops.

Subject: Phil's Mash System; Filtering your water


Recently, someone posted asking if anyone had had any experience with the
"Phil's Mashing System" lately advertised in _Zymurgy_ by the Listermann
Mfg. Co. I recently bought one of these for about $35 from The Home Brewery
in San Bernardino, Calif.


The bulk of the system consists of a pair of food-grade plastic buckets,
each with a quarter-inch hole drilled into the side at the bottom. Other
components include a pair of PVC hoses with hose clamps; a drilled, formed
plastic plate for a false bottom; and a very clever brass sparging
apparatus mounted on a rigid PVC frame.


To set the system up, you put your brew kettle on the floor, the lauter
bucket on a chair or other low support, and the other bucket (for sparge
water) up on a counter or other high support. You set the sparge apparatus
atop the lauter bucket, and connect the hose from the water bucket to it.
When you open the hose clamp, the sparge arm spins, sprinkling the sparge
water gently over the grain. The other hose clamp controls the outflow of
sweet extract into your kettle.


The only problem I had was using the two hose clamps to control the inflow
and outflow. The effective range of the clamps is only wide-open to two
stops. Closing the clamps any more effectively halts the flow. Also, I need
to set the water supply atop a case of bottles to have sufficient water
pressure to drive the sparge arm after half the water is used.


This was my first attempt at all-grain brewing. All the books say you need
at least 8 to 10 gallons of boiling capacity, but I am limited to my
6-gallon kettle. So, I just compensated by using extra grain. From 10
pounds of Klages malt, I got about 5 1/2 gallons of 1050 wort.


To those extract brewers who are scared of all-grain brewing (as I was), I
say: FEAR NOT! It is *MUCH* easier than I thought it would be, and it adds
only a couple of hours to the brewing process. I have two batches of
all-grain pale ale in the other room happily fermenting away. I can harldy
wait to taste and compare with my extract brews!


Someone was asking about the iodine test. The iodine-starch reaction is
very fast, almost instantaneous. If you don't get a blue-black result
within 1 second, that's a negative test. If you let the test sit around for
a few minutes, you will get some small black particles. With Klages malt, I
got conversion after a half hour.


It was an almost magical feeling to see and taste the mash turn from bland
and starchy to golden and sweet.


=====---===---===


Brian Davis asked about filtering water. I always filter my water with one
of those small Water Pik filters to get rid of the chlorine. I've never
brewed with unfiltered water, so I can't make a comparison, but it
definitely improves coffee.

I'm speaking of the video in general, as an intro to homebrewing for
newbies. Generally, people don't want to start by malting. And since
there's no discussion of mashing, there's no point in showing people how to
malt. This would be a good thing to put into your mashing video, if you
haven't already. For beginners, tho, a discussion of the process would
suffice to give them general background info and spark some interest. See
what I mean?

Subject: hop vines: vertical or horizontal?


Hello fellow Brewpeoples.


David Van Iderstine mentioned in HBD #851 that hops should be trained
sideways, and not up.  This has raised a good question.  It seems to be
conventional wisdom that they should be trained straight up--about 20
feet up in fact.  Maybe the big-time hop farmers only do this to save
space and grow more hops per acre.  Maybe they would indeed grow better
if they were trained horizontally.  Maybe it doesn't matter, as long as
they get plenty of sun.


Enter the HOMEBREW digest, a wealth of experience.


First, has anyone tried growing hops BOTH ways, and found one way produces
a higher yield?  (Hmm, I thought not.)  OK, does anyone know of a friend
(in the same general geographic location) who grows it differently than
you do?  How does your yield compare with your friends'?


I've just planted my hops, and am NOT looking forward to (read: dreading)
buying a BIG ladder; buying 20' poles; standing them in the ground;
stringing cable and twine; and trying to harvest hops that are growing
straight up 16 feet or so.


The idea of sending them up 6 feet or so and then over to the eves on my
roof sounds MUCH easier.  And, it would provide a wonderful shade for my
back yard.  It would probably look pretty cool too.  Does anyone grow
them in this way?  How big is your yield (or is that a personal question)?


I would appreciate any informed comments or stories from experience
(please, no speculation--we have enough of that in this forum).


Thanks a heap,

>almost universally agreed to "fruitiness" of ale leaves me in the cold.


Personally, I'm not sure if I could tell the difference in a blind tasting
of Ales versus Lagers.  I'm also not sure if many "experts" could.  As in
the rest of nature, there is no clear dividing line between the flavor of
Ales and the flavor of Lagers -- all beers are somewhere on the frutiness
continuum.  Another "stick-in-the-spokes" of this issue is something like
Samuel Adams Boston Lager, which is so highly dryhopped so as to make it
difficult to perceive esters, that I don't think even Michael Jackson
would be able to tell if it was a Lager or an Ale in a blind tasting.


>The only fruit I have ever tasted in my ale was bananas and apples resulting 
>from contaminated yeast and the use of sugar.


As I've noted in a previous post, my Chemistry skills are pretty poor,
therefore, for the sake of discussion, I would like to present my
understanding and would greatly appreciate concurrence/correction from
experts.  Here goes:


It is my understanding that esters are the product of alcohols and
organic acids.  The well-known "banana" ester is isoamyl acetate, which
I assume is the product of isoamyl alcohol and acetic acid.  I also
assume that the yeast does more than create the alcohol, rather the
reaction between the alcohol and the acid takes place in the yeast cell
(George?  Help?).  In any event (I digress) I don't think Jack should
immediately blame contamination for esters -- many yeasts are "chosen"
for their ester production (try St. Louis Gueuze for the fruitiest beer
I've ever tasted, that did not have fruit added).


The bottom line is that all beers have some esters, and IMHO while there
may be a theoretical division between Ale and Lager, there is no *real*
division (it depends on the sensitivity of the taster, among other things).
On the other hand, I don't think it's wrong for a judge to taste a beer
entered in the Pilsener category and to say "too estery for style."  A
judge should have pretty-much tuned his/her senses to conform to the
AHA/HWBTA style definitions and should be aware of their taste/smell
(hyper)sensitivities.

Subject: Racking for clarification


I saw some interesting instructions for racking on a beer kit recently. The
advice was to rack from the secondary fermenter, wait a day, then rack into the
bottle. No explanation was given, and it at first seemed to me that the second
racking might not achieve much in the way of clarification. It then got me
thinking about the behaviour of some of my wines, and I have noticed that if I
rack a quite mature wine, it can often throw an unexpected deposit the next
day. Maybe some equilibrium principle operates with yeast/trub, ie, a constant
proportion of the absolute amount present tends to remain in suspension. 
Alternatively, racking is also sometimes recommended as a means of inhibiting
any residual ferment, the idea being that one can reduce the amount of viable
yeast below some threshold by this method. It would be interesting to know
whether any of this applies to brewing.

 >Jack, I know when you said to just let the chiller sit in the wort for
 30 minutes without turning the water on, you were defining an experiment
 of sorts.  I'd just like to say that in practice, you want to turn the water
 on immediately to cool the wort as quickly as possible.
 
 I understand but the longer it sits, the more time is has to settle out.  My 
 thinking is that if it sits after chilling, it is subject to infection and 
 without mucking up the lid, the kettle can not be covered properly while the 
 chiller is inside.  One obviously does not want to remove the chiller after 
 thewort is chilled.  If it sits for 30 minutes hot it can not get infected 
 and is not much different from an additional 30 min boil for a chemestry 
 stand point but it gets an extra 30 settling time.
 
 My poke at in-line chillers was to point out that they are inferior in this 
 respect unless an additional settling step is added after chilling.  This is 
 just another step, with all the attendant sanitizing and clean up details 
 that make brewing too much like work.
 
 >  In fact, the faster you cool, the more fluffy stuff you'll see.  That 
 stuff is the cold break.
 
 >The hot break happens during the boil, when proteins, etc. clump together.
 
 The problem with these terms is that in one instance they indicate a stage in 
 a process and in another/both they indicate physical stuff.
 
 >I believe the hot break is happening at the time when boilover is most
 likely, although I've seen it happen before then.  The differentiation, as
 I understand it, is *when (at what temperature)* the break occurs.  The break
 material  itself is more or less the same.
 
 In my experience, somewhere well into the boil, stuff starts coagulating into 
 what looks like egg-drop soup.  If this point is the "hot break", I accept 
 the definition but let's call the stuff something else.
 
 Similarly, the "cold break" should be some temperature at which this stuff 
 collects and drops to the bottom during chilling.  Again, in my experience, 
 it is a very specific point AND much of the stuff clumps together and floats 
 to the top.  The wort goes from cloudy and turbid to crystal clear in a 
 period of a minute or two when the correct "break point?" temperature is 
 reached.
 
 I have big troubles understanding how this works or can be as effectively 
 utilized with an in-line chiller.
 
 All this simply defines the phenomenon without suggesting a solution.  I 
 offer as a solution to confine the use of the terms hot/cold break to the 
 process stage at which something happens and add your favorite expletive when 
 talking about the stuff.  Like.... "hot break stuff"..   If STUFF is good 
 enough for Carl Sagan, it's good enough for me.

 The only problem you will run into is that you are left with a yeasty taste 
 that is not very pleasant.  A dash of lemon or one of the many additives used 
 by commercial bottlers will sove the problem.
 
 Use 1/8 tsp yeast and 2 tbs sugar for one gallon and bottle in one litre 
 plastic bottles.  Refrigerate when hard.

I have a friend who loans me a digital scale from time to time so I can
weigh my hops out to the nearest .01 g :^) While I was was doing this, I
happened to glance over at the ol' bottle collection and decided to
throw a few samples on the scale to see if I could maybe figure out
which bottles have more glass, and presumably, would be less likely to
fail with repeated refillings.
 
Now granted, there are other variables involved here, for instance, the
shape of the bottle could account for more difference in strength than the 
amount of glass, but I thought you people might find the results
interesting. Here they are:


337g  The Winner! :^) The heaviest bottle I could find: Cerveza
      Pacifico.


318g  Returnable longlecks from most major breweries. (tested: Bud,  
      Leinenkugel's, Huber. All were within 2g of this weight)


292g  Celebrator Dopplebock
276g  Bass
274g  Young's
263g  Samuel Adams
262g  Pinkus Homebrew (11.2 oz. bottle)
259g  Any Pete's or Schell no-refill but _not_ twist-off
