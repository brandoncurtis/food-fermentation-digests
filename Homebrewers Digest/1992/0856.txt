Subject: steam beer help


I want to make a reasonable approximation to Anchor Steam.  I
have the new cat's meow (which has few steam beer recipes), but
I'd like any hints anyone can offer on making the brew.


Any specific tips on the mash?  I've heard N. Brewer hops is
the thing, but any special hopping rates?  HBUs?  I'll be
trying the Wyeast California Lager.  What about adjuncts?
Fermentation time and temps?


thanks.

Subject: raspberry ale




Does anyone have suggestions for an extract-based raspberry ale (amounts of
raspberries, hops, adjunct grains, even a recipe?)?  I'm thinking about
something like:
        5 lbs amber malt syrup
        1-2 pkgs frozen raspberries
        2 oz Cascade hops (boiling)
        1 oz ?? (finishing)
        1/2 lb crystal malt...


for a 5 gallon batch.  The primary goal is something like a bitter with
raspberry flavor, and maybe even a red-ish tinge. 


If I don't care about clearing (the taste is the main important point with
me) , is there any problems with pectin in the beer (or should I not add the
crushed berries until the wort starts to cool on general principle?)




Advice, ideas welcome, flames (seems like there is still too much
intolerance on here -- USE PERSONAL EMAIL, FOLKS!  I read the same stuff as
the rest of you HBD'ers, and if you are hot under the collar because someone
sounds arrogant or annoying, don't tell me, since I don't care) send 'em to
/dev/null... 


And keep them there.


But about those raspberries... No stout recipes, please.  As much as I'm
interested in trying CP's Cherries in the Snow or his Rasp Stout, I've got
anxious roommates to please (taste-bud and time-wise)...


thanks,

Subject: chiller


   Something I'd like to add about using an immersion wort chiller:  the
water that exits the chiller is *extremely* hot.  I use it rinse off my
already sanitized stainless spoon, which I then use to gently stir the 
cooling wort into a vortex.


   Someone was confused about the order of chilling/pitching steps.  Here's
what I do.
  (1) Chill (and stir, as above)
  (2) Remove chiller when wort is cooled
  (3) Pitch yeast
  (4) Stir into vortex again (make sure the spoon (and your arm) is sanitized!
     This is the step most likely to introduce bacteria/mold/etc.)
  (5) Let sit for 1-2 hours
  (6) Transfer to carboy

Mead makers,


I'm getting ready to brew a mead, and was hoping that the experienced
mead-makers out there could post a summary of the flavor characteristics
of some of the different honeys available.  Just looking at the shelf in
the grocery store last evening I saw alfalfa, clover, wildflower, and a
couple of others.


Also, anybody in the area (Denver/Boulder/CoSprings) feel free to recommend
a supplier, I'm sure that Safeway isn't the cheapest place to buy large
volumes of honey.


Thanks,

Subject: Leinenkugel Tours


I have been on the tour, and the brewery is truly a museum piece - with
twisty passages, the aforementioned steep stairways, climbing over pipes
and hoses, and wonderful classic huge mysterious pieces of America's
Industrial Past going "hiss hiss hiss" as levers move up and down and
whirlygigs whirl. Bring your camera, especially if you're into industrial
history.


However, the best part of Chippewa Falls must be its bars. All small,
friendly, places that treat tourists same as locals, and proudly sell a
10 oz glass of the local product for $.25. At happy hour it's $.20! And
it is, of course, VERY fresh, so while Leinenkugel's is not exactly a
four-star beer, it is one of the better representatives of the American
Pale Pilsner Style, so despite my beer-geekdom, I found fresh
Leinenkugel's very enjoyable on a hot July afternoon after all those
stairs on the brewery tour.


Whoda' thought such an environment would give birth to the world's
fastest computers.

Subject: Re: Can Liquid Yeast Pkgs Explode? YES!!!


After several years of reliable performance from Wyeast's packaging,
they changed something early in 1992, and a number of people have
reported bursting packages. Not only is this a waste of very good yeast,
it is a mess. Wyeast's quality control people are said to be VERY
concerned, and we all hope they fix this problem soon.


What to do since you can't brew right away: Make a starter, as per the
instructions on the Wyeast package or in many books. The Wyeast package
is itself a starter, and so you're simply enlarging the starter. This
is a good idea even without the fear of bursting, since the quantity of
wort in the package gives just barely a high enough pitching rate to
insure rapid commencement of fermentation and the protection from
infection and worry which that will give you.

Subject: Negative Pressurein the Blow Off


Dear Brewers


First, I want to thank all who responded to my post re: "milky-caramel"
appearance to my wort.  I'd like to thank in particular Steve Hamburg
and Mark Easter for their insights and experience.  Thanks all... I'm
not worrying...  At least I wasn't until this morning...


When I got up this morning to check on how well my wort was clearing -
it had progressed to about half way into the wort - I noticed that the
blowoff tube had filled with clear water, obviously sucked in from the
catch recepticle!  (Maybe *that's* why Pap. suggests replacing the blow
off tube with a fermentation lock!!)


I suspect that, because of the temperature drop last night - I've got
the carboy out on the back porch - the wort condensed a bit and the
negative pressure sucked up the chloronated water in the recepticle.
Now, the tube is quite long (about 6' or so), so I suspect that if any
of the water did get into the wort, it was minimal.


Still, I replaced the tube with a lock, but now I've got yet another set
of questions for the Illuminati:
     1) Will the small amount of HCl-ated water that was sucked into the
     wort do any damage?
     2) Will the exposure to the air (when I switched from the blowoff
     tube to the lock) effect the wort?
     3) Is there now a possibility that, having replaced the blowoff
     with a lock, any further fluxuation in temperature/pressure will
     suck in (contaminating) air through the lock?


Thanks for the responses


John

Subject: brown sugar & molasses




> ... brown sugar == molasses & cane sugar


well, I for one can taste the difference between beers made with
brown sugar and those made with molasses, and beleive me, brown sugar
is prefereable, being quite appropriate in an english ale.
molasses leaves a much more distinctive taste, very sweet, and
objectionable in excess.  I've used 2 lbs of brown sugar in a 1.075 OG,
1.020 FG ale before and it was yummy.  My brewing partner used 1/4
cup molasses in 4 separate batches - It was quite at home in
the english ales, budefinitely a different flavor from brown
sugar.  It was not at home in a lager.  After the 4th batch,
we're both sick of molasses.  I've also used an entire 16 oz.
bottle of molasses before in a 1.088 OG 1.033 FG dark cherry ale,
and it worked wonderfully - the residual sweetness balanced the
acidic cherries nicely.  I was thinking about adding some molasses
to make a sweet cherry mead, but I'll stick with brown sugar
for the most part, from now on.

My recipe is water + carbon dioxide.


Seriously. I tried carbonating water by fermenting a little sugar and
never had any luck. It carbonated but tasted terrible. Since getting
a CO_2 canister I just pressurize a keg of water to about 25psi and serve.


Of course, an alternative is to buy a seltzer bottle and some of those
CO_2 cartridges. It's a little more expensive but not much. Besides,
you can also buy NO_2 cartridges and make whip cream (or something ;-)

Subject: Only nose knows


I read the ongoing thread about ales vs lagers and can't help but wonder
how many brewers that have difficulty differentiating subtle aromatic and
taste differences in beers are smokers? Most smokers would be hard pressed to
identify gross differences in smells between ANY two items (I'm really trying
to be nice and general here) much less the subtle differences in beer aromas.
I remember the Mr. Wizard test where he closes a kids eyes and holds thier
nose and ask them what they are biting into. When they bite into an onion
they think they are biting into an apple. Once he lets the kid smell, the kid
immediately knows its an onion. I would suggest a smoker has a partial nose
clip on at all times :-).

Subject: forced carbonation


Hello All...


I have a few questions regarding Forced Carbonation.  I have gone
through past HBD and have downloaded the CO2 chart from the
archives so I think I've got somewhat of an idea of the general
process.  But, there are still a few grey areas...


What I've got so far is this:
  Rack to the keg; pressurize to about 30psi and shake real well;
  lower pressure to that specified on the CO2 chart based on
  temperature and desired carbonation level.


Now for the questions:
  First of all, does the above pretty well describe the process
  or am I all wet from the get-go?


  Is it necessary to chill the beer down as much as possible to
  aid the CO2 going into solution?  If yes, what are the effects
  when the beer is warmed back up to serving temperature?


  After initial pressurization to 30psi, how long is it recommended
  to keep the beer at that pressure before lowering it to the chart
  pressure?


  Is it sufficient to pressurize the keg and then remove the gas, 
  or should the gas be left on for the entire rest.


  After the 30psi pressurization I assume the keg must be vented and
  then re-pressurized to the chart pressure.  After which, how long
  is the recommended chart pressure rest?


  Should the chart pressure rest be done at serving temperature or
  as cold as possible?


  Lastly, (whew!) do you all think that there would be any benefit
  in connecting the gas line to the *output* of the keg so that the
  gas would have to actually bubble through the beer while 
  pressurizing?


Thanks in advance for any light you all may be able shed on the
above...

I currently have a Koelsch-esque brew fermenting with a rather stinky
air about it. That's roughly 15% wheat and German Ale Wyeast. I
mustered up the courage to taste it, nose held, and it's seems fine.
I'm not worried. I also used the slurry from the Koelsch for my Fine
Line Barleywine (aka Sleepout Imperative Stout), and this brew smells
fine -- good, even.


That reminds me . . .


Said barleywine is based on the Empirical Stout recipe in Meow I
(sorry, but I don't remember the creator off-hand). This recipe calls
for a primary ferment using some Ale Wyeast or other, and then, when
this yeast has passed on (so to speak), a secondary ferment using
champagne yeast. Does anyone have any comments on this technique? How
would it work on a mead?


Cheers,
Jake.

Before I made the move to all grain, I too wanted to have more influence
over my beers. Not just head color, but in every respect possible. Short 
going all grain, there are things one can do.


Try using the palest extract available, regardless of whether you're
making a light lager or a stout. Starting from this point, you can
then adjust the color and malt character by adding specialty malts
(crystal, chocolate, etc.) as desired. Especially in darker brews, the
color and flavor contributions of the extract become less significant,
giving the extract brewer greater control over the outcome.

Someone wanted to know about a combination thermometer-hydrometer.
Well, I use one sold by Crosby & Baker, catalog # 3103.
It has a thermometer range of approx. 0-215F and a standard 3-scale hydrometer.
I don't know if C & B sells retail. (I buy the hydrometers for my brewery!)
The price in their wholesale catalog is $8.10, so you might expect to pay
$15.00 for it at a homebrew shop.  Their address is:


                Crosby & Baker
                999 Main Road
                P.O. Box 3409
                Westport, Massachusetts 02790


                (800) 992-0141
                (508) 636-5154




(Insert standard disclaimer here.)










Since I recieved only one or two responses to my question about brewing
microbiology, I will restate it more specifically:




        Where can I find, or who can provide me with specific info
        on detection and identification of beer spoiling organisms?
        Specifically, I'm interested in preparing selective and
        differential media for the culture of :


                1.  Obesumbacterium proteus
                2.  Escherichia spp.
                3.  Lactobacillus spp.
                4.  Pediococcus spp.
                5.  Acetobacter spp.
                6.  Acetomonas spp.
                7.  Zymomonas spp.
                8.  Aerobacter spp.


        Of course, I am particularly interested with techniques commonly
        employed by breweries.  I have access to incubators and autoclaves,
        and I also have basic streaking-plating-culturing experience.


        Perhaps someone who has attended the Siebel Institute's Course
        on Microbiology could point me in the right direction or even
        sell me a copy of their notebooks.


        Also, related yeast handling techniques would be appreciated.


        Does anyone know the cost of a Difco Manual?




Finally, what exactly is the difference between Hallertau mittelfreuh and
Hallertau hersbrucker?  I know the mittelfreuh is regarded as the nobler of 
the two, but what else?  Are mittelfreuhs available to homebrewers in
the U.S.?  Can we get mittelfreuh rhizomes?  Do the suppliers know the
difference?  Etc.
 
Perhaps Dr. Farnsworth could help me with my microbio question as I know
that he at one time sold culturing equipment to homebrewers.
