Subject: Urubamba/Chicha beer


     In the most recent issue of ALL ABOUT BEER (May 1992), there was an
article called "The Brewsters of Urubamba" by Alan D. Eames.  The article
focused on a beer called "Chicha".  Is there anyone out there who can
supply more info about the beer, particularly what type of corn was used,
what type of yeast is employed and anything else about extra ingredients?
Please do not repeat the article.  I am looking for more info about this
beer OTHER than what appeared in the article.  Please send any responses
by private email.  Thanks ahead of time.

Subject: raspberry ale


Thanks to everyone for the suggestions, recipes, and comments.  You all know
who you are!  I was going to post the recipe I'm going to use in brewing
tommorow, but I think I'll wait until I taste the result. Plans include 24oz
raspberries right after the boil, and 24oz in the secondary.  The one
question I have is how should I prepare the raspberries for the secondary?
Granted, there is a bit less chance of infection at this point, but still...
Do people just risk the infection and dump in the fruit, or do they steam
the fruit first? (I'd assume this might kill off nasties with out creating
too much jelly...). 


If anyone is interested in the information I got, email me and I'll compile
the lot and send them; since some have been posted here, I see no need to
waste bandwidth...


thanks again,

In helping a friend who is moving clean out his barn, I acquired two
very old beer bottles.  Both of these bottles have raised lettering
(any labels that might have been were long gone).  I was wondering if
any of you beer historians out there have any information on the
breweries.


The first bottle was from Gerhard Lang Brewery in Buffalo, N.Y., and
the second was from the Springfield Brewing Company, in Springfield,
Mass.

Could one reduce the chances of contaminates/beasties in dried yeast by
re-hydrate yeast in water and then add grain alcohol up to 5%-10% ?  The
yeast water, alcohol could then be added to a starter solution if one were
so inclined. Are the contaminates/beasties is dried yeast alcohol resistant?
Thanks for any information,

Subject: smoking/beer-tasting


Bob Jones asks about being a smoker and a beer taster.


I used to smoke (quit in sept 90 after 16 years).  One of the
reasons I quit was that I entered a beer in the `88 nationals and
got terrible reviews.  After receiving the judging forms, I
pulled out a refridgerated bottle of the same beer and tried to
identify the flavors/smells etc.  I couldn't.  At the time,
I figured that it could be the fact that was a smoker.  In
retrospect, I think it was 60% smoke and 40% inexperience.
I am still learning a lot (who says "when I stop learning, bury me?")
but quitting smoking has made tasting a much more enjoyable and
intense experience.

Since those of us atttending the AHA conference will be at the Mark
Plaza, Downtown, I'd suggest the Water Street Brewpub as a HBD meeting
place. It's not far out of the way from the Mark Plaza, and it's also not
too far from Marquette University's environs. Furthermore, its easy to
find even by strangers to Milwaukee. Best of all, it's an actual brewpub,
(albeit extract) which like all good brewpubs has hits and misses, but
their hits can be excellent. Food is great, and not terribly costly.

I almost hate to stoop to flaming Jack S, but ...


Brewing (according to Funk & Wagnalls) is the process of making fermented
undistilled liquids, as beer or ale.


It is the fermentation process which determines if you are brewing,
not the process up to the point of fermentation. In fact, one may argue
that producing NA beer may not be brewing. As I read the laws in Canada,
they relate to alcoholic beverages - which dictate what I can or can
not do with my product. Non-Alcoholic beverages fall under different
legislation which are much more relaxed than for alcoholic beverages.


As for the mashing, etc. Jack should maybe talk to the Wine Industry and
inform them that they are not "BREWING."

Even if we all can't manage to meet in one place, why not a unique ID for
all the HBD'ers like a red H on your coference badge. You know like the
scarlett letter. Everyone would ask "what does the red H mean?" and we

Hello all!
  I just have a quick question that you might be able to help me with.  I
tried to make a sour mash and do not think it soured.  I really don't have
any way of knowing accurately the ph.


There is the question:  Does anyone know where I can buy some PH paper that
will go down to about 3.4 or 3.5  I have not been able to find anything this
low in any cataglogs.  I do not make wine yet, but I was under the impression
that for wine, you need low PH paper.   


Well I will keep this short....If anyone knows of someplace I can get this

source = Gerald Fink, et al (`at` Whitehead Institute) and MIT
keyword (s) = Saccharaomyces cerevisiae / captive behavior
              filimentous phase / domestication / starvation 




The old Field vrs Laboratory observation style philosophies
recently took a turn for the interesting in the yeast arena.


It seemed to be commonly accepted by the majority of Saccharomyces
researchers that although most of its relatives (other similar molds) 
went through a filamentous phase and that Saccharomyces had been so 
domesticated over the years that it either never had the ability 
or had lost it.  Now researchers have reason so suspect their 
assumptions.


Fink first suspected a contaminant because it did not resemble the
normally observed structure, but Carlos Gimeno (grad. stu.) pointed out
that the alien could have successful sex with Saccharomyces. 


The missing phase seems to be caused by the fact that,
in the lab, the ingredients for growth are all provided for. 
The filamentious phase seems to be activated by starvation. 


Fink claims that given free reign the yeast would ...
 
"If you let just one cell divide at its maximal rate, it would form a
layer around the earth 10 feet deep after just 2 weeks."
(ed. everybody "pitch" in and LETS TRY IT!)


The new structure seems to be invoked by reduced environmental nitrogen 
levels, which causes buds not to not seperate.  A bud does not break away 
and that daughter bud does not breakaway. This "chaining" activity allows
the yeast to penetrate agar media, and has been hypothesised to be a
foraging mechanism. The yeast penetration effect seems to be regulated 
by nitrogen levels.

Hey Darryl,


I read your interesting post on Lager beers and it seems to make sense, 
but I'm puzzled by one thing.  You said Lagering provided a way to produce
beers in the warm summer months.  But I thought Lagers fermented at 
temperatures COLDER than normal - thats why people make Lagers in their
refridgerators.  Am I mistaken?  Or did you mean that in the summer the
beer WAS made in an icehouse or something?  Along those same lines, I 
thought a Steam beer was a Lager made at Ale temperatures (i.e. normal 
San Franciso temperatures - especially in the summer!).  And how could
SF's temp.s be warmer than anyone else's unless it was someone else's
icebox?  


Thanks,
Chris

Thanks for posting the list! I did a similar (although not so thorough)
comparison last fall (and didn't post results :-().  What I found, is
that for items like bulk grain and bulk DME, the shipping cost becomes a
significant portion of the final bill.  As a result, I went looking for
the closest supplier rather than the cheapest.  The Brewhaus in
Knoxville, Tennessee did well for me on both counts.  Bulk pale malt
from Great Western Malting costs about $1.00 per # by the time it gets
to my door, whereas pale malt from the Brewhaus ($35 for 55lb) costs
about $0.82.  For hops shipping costs probably aren't that big a deal. 


It's just something to consider.


> Also, buying in bulk will lower these prices.


I've noticed that the people who have the best prices for bulk don't
have the best prices for small quantities (sometimes not even close)
and the reverse.

For some reason, the file brewsheet.ps, as it appears on mthvax, has an
error: the character that is supposed to print as a box (for checking off
options) instead appears as a "member of" character (curved E).  You can
easily fix this by:


load brewsheet.ps into your favorite editor.  Find the line that looks
like this:


[ 300 ] /lasy10.300 `at`newfont


This line has the first occurrence of lasy10.300 in the file.  Two lines

characters out): 
[<007FF801FFF...
  ...7FF8> 24 26 -3 3 27.673] 50 `at`dc


Replace those two lines with these four:

I have a hydrometer without instructions.  I'm trying to find out what the correction factor is for temperature.  I was wondering if anyone had some info on this.  


I usually take hydrometer readings right before pitching (at approximately 95 degrees F) and right before bottling (at approximately 65 degrees F).  I suspect that the correction factor is very low but I'm not sure.  Right now I feel that I might be comparing apples to oranges.  


Any help would be appreciated.

warm enough in San Francisco to make steam beer a necessity? I used to
spend an occasional weekend at conventions in Oakland or San Jose, so I
never believed Mark Twain's "The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer
in San Francisco." Then I arrived in SF proper in mid-July, driving down 101
with the fog flooding through the gaps in the coastal hills and virtually
covering the Golden Gate, and nearly froze downtown; and now a physicist
friend who taught in Sacramento for two years says that's standard (due to
rising air in the central valley sucking cold wet air off the ocean?).
   So how did it happen that ]room-temperature[ lagers were necessary? Were
they really brewing across the bay? Or is a daytime high of 50 not cold
enough even for the older styles of lagers? Or (global warming on the east
coast to the contrary---the Charles almost never freezes hard enough to
walk across any more) was it actually warmer in SF in the last century?
   For that matter, how/when did lagers spread compared to mechanical
refrigeration? 1840 is well before compressors, and somewhere around the
start of ice-block refrigerator cars for cattle carcases. The word means
"cave", I'm told because that's where the beer was stored to stay cool;
were there no caves or cool cellars available in SF? Or wasn't there enough
ice inland from SF in the winter (considering that there's skiing within
easy reach of LA) that summer brewing should have been possible?

Jack-


As a professional baker and chef, I find your analogy of using extracts
to be rather infuriating. I use extracts in my work every day. Am I less
of a baker because I don't soak vanilla beans in alcohol to extract the
essence? Am I less of a baker because I use mixes instead of gathering
together flour, leavening agents, sugar, etc., which is what a mix is
made of in the first place? 


In the future, I suggest that you refer yourself to a cook before making
such a weak argument, thus setting up a straw man to be knocked down.


I also find your "women/cooks" to be a fundamentally insulting phrase.
Not all women are cooks, nor are all cooks women, and I would estimate
that neither party agrees with your conjectures.

Subject: Mystery Chunks...


Greetings, All!


This is my first submission to the digest. I have been brewing for 3 - 4 
months now, with 6 batches under my belt ( not literally :-> ). My recipes so
far have been extract, and up until recently have been fairly "purist" and
have not used corn sugar in the recipes, only malt extract for the fermantable
sugar (I did use honey once). I only use corn sugar for bottling.


My question/problem is this. I recently made a batch with corn sugar as one of
the ingredients, but it accounted for only about 15% of the fermentables. 
I boiled it with the rest of the wort for an hour, then tossed it into the
carboy. When it was cool enough, I pitched.
The next morning, There were big whitish chunks floating on the top, and 
suspended throughout the liquid. This did not appear to be trub, as I saw
that settle out before I went to bed. This looked nothing like anything
I had ever seen in the carboy. The fermentation also had not started yet, and 
was about 12 hours behind schedule (based on all previous fermentations).


Was this the corn sugar coagulating out, perhaps? Or might it have been the
yeast? (it was rehydrated Edme, what I've always used)


Any thoughts or enlightenments would be appreciated. See you in Milwaukee!

Hmmm, I didn't express myself well, did I?  Lagering was a means 
to being able to consume beer in the warm summer months, not 
produce it in that season.  It required brewing a full year's 
worth of beer in the cold winter and finding some cache that 
stayed cold during the summer, like caves in the hills. 


San Francisco never gets down to the necessary lagering temps 
due to the strong moderating effect of the ocean.  Before 
widespread mechanical refrigeration (a product from the 1880s, 
well after Steam beer was created for the benefit of the 
'49ers), there was no way to make a lager beer in SF, regardless 
of season.  Any attempt to do so would produce a more estery 
beer that fermented explosively.

Well, anecdotal evidence aside, it is usually quite pleasant in SF
(ignoring the rain) from spring through fall, and even a 50s high is
warmer than most traditional lager primary temperatures.  For example,
Pilsner Urquell never lets their beer rise above 48F, and during
most of the time it is in the neighborhood of 40F.  Of course,
that's only the primary;  during secondary, the temperature is 34F.
This is not a common occurance in Baghdad by the Bay.  However, 50F
is warm enough to give most lager yeasts a real kick.

I believe that the pioneering work of Dreher (Brauerei Schweicat 
in Vienna) and Seydlmayer (Spaten in Munich) with respect to 
refrigeration occured in the late 1880s.  Fix has the date in 
his "Vienna".  The lager revolution required a number of events,
but it began with the understanding of how to culture pure yeast
strains en mass.  Cheap glass also helped.  But until mechanical
refrigeration, the beer generally couldn't be made in the summer.


The word "lager" is from the German word "lagern" which means 
"to store". I'm not aware of any caves in the SF area that would 
have been local enough to keep the cold temperatures throughout 
a summer. 


And, of course, you look at distances with a jaundiced, modern 
eye, as do I. But remember, 140 years ago, 20 miles was a great 
distance and required most of a day. Consider that it took a 
week to transport the mirror up to Mt. Hamilton in the San Jose 
area at the turn of the century, and it was only about 25 miles 
away. The skiing in LA is in Wrightwood, a solid 75 miles from 
downtown, along a modern, highly engineered road. To get to an 
ice field in LA during the winter, using horse drawn wagons 
would be well nigh impossible.

Subject: Lager vs Ale


Darryl Richman said some very good things about the comment 4/7 and I would
like to add a couple more:  
[1] In Germany the ales (alts/kolsch's and I think weizens) are conditioned
    (lagered) near freezing for up to a month to make for a smoother taste.
    I remember an alt in Duesseldorf with a label that said "top fermented
    lagered beer"  (in German of course).
[2] There is no such thing as an isipid bland lager beer in Germany (unless
    you happen upon an American Bud in who knows I don't know where place).
    
Most homebrewers that return from Europe have a better idea of how good a
lager beer can really be.  That is the challenge; to do it at home.
