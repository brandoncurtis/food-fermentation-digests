Subject: first try at bottling with DME




Hi all,


    Well I got to try my first beer bottled with DME instead of sugar.
I think it does taste a little better. I would like to thank the three
people that sent or posted suggestions to me.

>From their suggestions I used 1 1/4 cups of DME. The only thing is, it
doesn't have the nice head my last batch did(same recipe). Of course
it's only been a week in the bottle.


Oh one more thing, out garage saleing this weekend I came up with a
Cornelius keg, 20# CO2 cylinder and a regulator....all for $8.50. That's
right $8.50 total.


Happy brewing

Subject: Spent grain


Just to add to the spent grain discssion.  I have been to the big AB plant
in St. Louis.  They hall their grain to farmers by the train load.


I have given my spent grain to my fowl and they show little inerest in it.


According to Malting and Brewing Science the grain has little food value
for farm critters and should only be used for a suppliment.

  I recently masde a batch of ale.  Using a the best of two recipes, one bock
and the other trappist ale.  Then adding yeast culture from a bottle of Chimay
 Can I enter this under AHA rules as a belgian ale?

Subject: Weizen yeast


I am brewing a Weizenbier, using my own starter with the Wyeast as currently packaged.
Are there any Bavarian wheat-beers available in this country
that I could have used to make up a starter? Miller says that most of them
have the t-f yeast filtered out and replaced with a b-f variety at bottling.

        If the initial load is the problem, and 1/6 hp will sustain operation
        then a capacitor start motor may do the trick. They're designed
        for high torque start up. Perhaps a small one from a dead fridge
        or other suitable donor could be used.

The Beer Game is all about the human tendency towards blindness to 
systemic factors, and not really at all about beer.  Check out Peter
Senge's excellent book, "The Fifth Discipline" (Doubleday/Currency, New
York, 1990) for a discussion of the Beer Game in context.

Subject: fermenters and seals


   A number of people have sent in saying they had problems with sealing
plastic buckets. Is it possible they're not locking the lid all the way
down? The plastic buckets I've seen have a \very/ \strong/ locking rim
(this may be a legal requirement for so-called "food grade" buckets, but
some supply shops may be selling something else); prying it off carelessly
is a good way to lose a fingernail. I also wouldn't automatically endorse
the sealing properties of carboys. I have several 3-gallon carboys (I've
been doing tweaking on half batches) with the standard orange soft-plastic
caps and have found most cap/carboy combinations don't seal tightly enough
to force exhaust CO2 through the fermentation lock; I've used various
gimmicks, including props, string around the outside, and plastic washers
(made from the seals on 5-gallon water jugs) inside to make a tighter seal,
but haven't figured out whether I've run into a bad line of caps or the
neck of the 3-gallon carboy is just a hair smaller/shorter.

Subject: Romulan Ale




Micah asks about coloring for Romulan Ale.  What comes to mind is Blueberries.
Sometimes Blueberries turn red in food, and sometimes stay bluish purple 
(not as blue as in the movies)  I think it's a pH thing.  Try it and let us
know, it sounds fun.  BTW is Romulan ale hopped?


There is a commercial beer that is made with blueberries that I had in
Seattle.  It was quite good but not enough to make me remember the name. 
As I recall the color was not very dramatic, and my host told me that they
use *green* berries.  The flavor was nice, and not overpowering.

a lot of micros and brewpubs simply flush their spent grains. 
>From what I understand as long as the sewage system can handle
them (i.e. it is not ancient and dilapadated) many communities
are actually happy to have them in the sewage system (I have read
this in articles and been told this by some pub brewers) since
it provides a source of nutrient in the sewage treatment plants,
many of which are based on microbial decomposition, in which they
have to add a certain level of nutrient to insure proper health
of the microbes. The spent grains supplement this in some systems...

From: m14051`at`mwvm.mitre.org (John DeCarlo)
Subject: Can CO2 be Useful?


Radical question #1:     Are air-locks really useful?


Is there any harm in having CO2 in solution, carbonating the fermenting
beer?  Why not keep all the CO2 in the fermenter, instead of wastefully
letting it out in the environment?


Disadvantages:  1)  You could exceed the pressure holding capability of
the fermenter, causing an explosion or other catastrophic failure.   2)
Increased pressure could affect the fermentation adversely.  3) No more
listening to "glub, glub".


Advantages:  The more CO2 in solution, the less likelihood of oxidizing
the liquid when racking (to secondary, bottling bucket, bottles).


So, does any of this make any sense?  As background, I use an S-shaped
air lock, that came with a little red cap.  When I started, I jammed the
cap on tight, thinking that was what it was for.  But no "glub, glub",
so I stopped doing that.  But maybe it would be useful after all?

One of my favorite things about the digest is the recipes.  By all means,
post them!  Break the recipes into groups of three or four if you aren't
comfortable posting them all at once.  LBNL, add them to the archives
and/or cat's meow.

Subject: Re: Evening Brewing, Morning Racking - When to pitch?


I received three mailed responses (thanks guys) to the above
question.  One said pitch after cooling (evening), one
said after racking (morning), and one quoted both Miller (pitch
in the evening - the trub's oxygen is good for the yeast), and
Fix (pitch in the morning after racking off the trub - yes the
yeast will use the trub's oxygen, but you won't like what's left
over).  So the score is 1.5 to 1.5.


I'm off for a week and a half, so I won't be able to follow this
until after I'm back, but I've seen arguments both ways and I'm 
wondering if a consensus is possible (assuming infection is not
an issue - which, of course, it can be).

Subject:      Irish Red Ale




I have two questions: Is there such a thing as an Irish Red Ale beer style?
Secondly, if there is can anyone give me a good recipe for one? I had an
excellent one at the Vermont Pub and Brewery, but I'm beginning to lose faith.
Whenever I ask the owners of the local Homebrew stores they just give me a
blank look and talk about how to achieve the color. I know that there has to
be more to it than that, but then again if it doesn't really exist per se....I
did peek into Michael Jackson's beer guide and saw Irish Red Ale on his family
tree of beers so I'm not quite willing to give up yet. Am I missing something
I should knowabout? If you do have a recipe for me, please keep in mind that
I'm still brewing with extracts. Thanks for any help you can give me.

Subject: Re: irish moss


Wanpus asks about irish moss and clarity.


I'd like to point out that if your beer is cloudy, it does not
necessarily mean protein-tannin (chill) haze or yeast haze.
Finings will take out either the protein or the tannin (depending
on the type of finings) and chilling for a week will usually help
drop out the yeast.  If you're using finings and chilling your
beer in advance of drinking it (or waiting for gravity to drop
the yeast out) and still are drinking cloudy beer, then either you've
added a ton of protein (e.g. wheat malt has a lot, so does unmalted
barley) or you've got an infection.  That's right, certain wild yeasts
will never come out of suspension and a bacterial infection can also
make your beer cloudy.  Check your sanitation.

Subject: Evening brewers, morning rackers


In response to Dale Veeneman's post, I've been doing this
(letting the cold break stuff settle out, then racking
to primary) for the last couple of batches. I have a strong
feeling, backed up by two no-ferments, that if you pitch
the yeast before settling and racking, you may be throwing
away much of the yeast when you rack. It's tempting to
want to get that yeast in as soon as possible, but for
the best pitching rate I think you want to pitch after you
rack to the primary. The risk of infection in the meantime
can be reduced if you can chill the wort way down before
the settling period.

Subject: Hops as food


The hops I planted last Spring did OK for their first year, but now they
are sending up lots of new shoots, and I can see that the second year 
will be a fantastic increase in yield over the first.
 
I went out this evening and culled all but the three strongest shoots 
from each rhizome, tool the culls (all between one and four inches 
long) in the house and sauteed them gently in a little butter, just 
barely long enough so they were completely wilted and beginning to 
soften (I like my pasta al dente, too).
 
Took them out of the pan, blotted the excess butter with a paper 
towel, put them on a plate and dug in.  WOW!!! All the stories are 
true!  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  I would describe the flavor as slightly 
sweet, slightly salty, definitely nutty.  Slightly reminiscent of 
asparagus, but far superior.
 
I didn't notice any difference between the blanched ones that had 
been covered with mulch, and the deep green ones that have been 
in full sun, so I'm a bit skeptical of the value of "mounding" them.
 
In short, if you have any room to grow hops around your house, 
this Springtime treat alone could make it worth your while.  Well, 
no, actually it's probably a much bigger thrill (at least for this 
brewer) just to be able to say you used your own hops in a 
particular batch.  My experience last year indicated that the 
fines that got the most sunlight produced the best yields, but 
that could also be coincidence -- we'll see this year.
