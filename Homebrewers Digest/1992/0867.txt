I have always been told that the standard orange 2-spout
carboy cap is made specifically for the 5-gallon carboys
marked Made in Mexico.  It works well on my three.  But
I have another one made in Canada, and it doesn't give
a good seal.  Drilled rubber stoppers definitely seem to
be the way to go for anything but the 5-gal Mexicans.




It's not too late to plant hops for this year in northern NJ, but only just.


Plant your rhizomes (order from any decent supplier, such as those who
advertise in Zymurgy), but make sure you keep different varieties at
least 6-8 feet apart.  Those roots really spread out under the surface
and before you know it you might not be able to tell which shoots are
coming from which variety of root!


Plenty of sun seems to work best.

          RE>fermenters and seals


I just bought an orange cap for my carboy (I like the idea of having two
openings during blow off).  I checked the seal by putting it on the carboy and
trying to blow as much air as I could into the carboy through one of the holes
in the cap.  I wasn't able to force any air to leak out the sides, so I'm
assuming I can get a decent seal.  We'll find out after this weekend...

What is Beer Across America.  If they send out stuff like Boulevard
Brewery's Irish Ale, I'm definitley interested.  If you could give us
an idea of what it is, the quality of the beer, addresses, phone
numbers, etc.  I know I am real interested.


In reference to Boulevard Brewery Bully Porter, Brian Bliss says:

I guess I've always been confused about this.  What is the standard
for porter?

I had a batch with some gushers but no apparent infection.  After
repeated sampling :-) I noticed that while some gushed, many others had
little or no carbonation.  Casting my thoughts back to a frenzied
exam-week evening of bottling I came to the conclusion that my priming
sugar had probably not been evenly distributed through the beer; some
bottles got too much sugar and some got too little.

A couple of days ago I wrote about going all-grain. I received this

I also live out in the boonies. In fact, the area I live in in Central
Oregon is called "Boonesborough."  It's half-way between Bend
and Redmond. The water here comes from a deep well and is perfect
for lager.


I found both the balance and the grain mill (Corona) at second hand
stores. The balance cost $7 and the mill $15. It takes some looking
around. Sorry, I should have mentioned these also. Still, even if 
you have to buy them new, you will win in the long run. A half-case
of regular store-bought US beer is about $7 now. A six of micro is
at least $7. Considering you get over two cases of 12 oz bottles
from 5 gallons, home brewing makes up the difference really fast.
The equipment cost is trivial compared to six-months worth of 
buying commercial brew instead of all-grain brewing.

            WORLD'S LARGEST HOMEBREW COMPETITION SETS TONE
                FOR 1992 NATIONAL HOMEBREW CONFERENCE


Boulder, Colo.--  The American Homebrewers Association today announced
that the National Homebrew Competition, the world's largest 
competition of its type, broke all previous records for participation.


To accommodate the vast number of entries, more than 2,200 in all and
635 more than last year's 1,565 entries, the National Competition was
broken into four regional first round judging sites for beer and
one site for sake and cider.  The competition was hosted in the West by
Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco, Calif., in the Rockies by
Boulder Beer Company in  Boulder, Colo., in the Midwest by Goose Island
Brewing Company in Chicago, Ill., and in the East by Boston Beer 
Company in Jamaica Plain, Mass.  Sake and cider, both first time 
categories at the National Competition, were judged at F.H. Steinbart
in Portland, Ore. and Boston Beer Company in Jamaica Plain respectively.


"The host breweries make the whole Competition possible," said Karen
Barela, AHA vice president.  "If the breweries didn't open their doors
to us and support homebrewing as much as they do, the size and interest
in the National Competition would be much more limited.  The really provide
an incredible amount of support for homebrewing."


The National Competition provides an opportunity for homebrewers to 
receive unbiased feedback on the quality of their beers, mead, cider
and sake from a panel of trained judges certified in the Beer Judge
Certification Program.  Beers, meads, sakes, and ciders are judges
according to style.  In the beer judging alone there are 24 different
categories and 57 different subcategories.


With 2,200 beers, meads, ciders and sakes distributed across the country
and ready for judging, entrants eagerly await the May 8 announcement
of which entries have been selected to go on to the second round.  Both
the second and final rounds will be judged at the AHA National 
Homebrewers Conference June 9 to 13 at the Marc Plaza Hotel in 
Milwaukee, Wis.


National Competition winners as well as the Best of Show (single best beer),
Ninkasi Award (brewer who receives the most points) and the Club High
Point Award (homebrew club that has entered the most winning entries
throughout the year), will be awarded at the National Homebrewers Conference 
Grand banquet and awards ceremony on June 12, 1992.

Hey now,


Me and a pal brewed a batch of beer 2 weeks ago (today) unfortunately we
have not had a chance to bottle it.  Now we are wondering if we spoiled
the batch.  Should we bottle it anyway?  Should we dump it?  Should we
bottle it and then give it as gifts to our enemies? Etc.


A quick response would be greatly appreciated becuase if we are going to
bottle we need to do it tonight.  Thanks in advnace.


Later...

In HBD 866, bliss`at`csrd.uiuc.edu (Brian Bliss) mentioned:

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


I don't know if I dozed off during some earlier mention of these folks on
HBD, but I 'accidentally stayed awake for it' this time.  Faster than
this Vermont weather(*) changes, I've discovered the following:


- --B.A.A. is (indeed) to beer what BOMC and POMC are to books and lingerie.
- --The monthly cost is $13.75 plus $3.xx s/h in Illinois, and $7.xx s/h to
   the rest of the USA (oops, forgot to ask about canada, etc).
- --Each month, a six-pack each of two beers show up on your porch via UPS.
- --Their phone number is 800-854-BEER, (854-2337), and yes, they'd gladly
  send me a brochure.


NOTE!! Twice I've mentioned interstate shipping of beer.  Since there seemed
to never be a full resolution on that problem here on HBD (or I've missed that
text, too), I asked the guy at B.A.A. about how they work with UPS.


They ship via some small-packet airfreight carrier (I forget the name) to
the state of the addressee, to a UPS drop point.  Then UPS carries it to
the door.  This way, UPS doesn't cross state borders with beer.  While I'm
curious about how flying 34000 feet above the stateline succeeds where UPS
ground fails, this does suggest alternatives for shipping beer, doesn't it?

Last month I decided to go for it.  Here's my recipe for Blackout Brown Ale
(named after the storm-related blackout that happened while making it):


        5 Gallons


        7#        Klages Malt
        1/4#        Chocolate Malt
        1/4#        Patent Malt
        1/2#        80L Crystal
        1 oz        Willamette Hops (3.8% alpha)        (one hour boil)
        4/5 oz        Perle Hops (8.5% alpha)                (30 min boil)
        1/2 t        Irish Moss                        (15 min boil)
        1/2 oz        Willamette Hops (3.8% alpha)        (dry hopped)
                Wyeast English Ale yeast
        3/4 c        Corn sugar                        (priming)


I used Papazian's temperature-controlled mash:


        30 min `at` 122 F
        90 min `at` 155-145 F
        sparge `at` 170 F


Total boil time was one hour.


        3/22        Cooled; pitched yeast.  Initial gravity:        1.042
        3/28        Racked and dry-hopped.  Intermediate gravity:        1.012
        4/6        Primed and bottled.        Final gravity:                1.008


One word: Mmmm!  I was aiming for an English mild, and missed--too dark and
too hoppy a nose for style.  Nice body, with a good balance between the malt
and the hops; the first thing that hits you, however, is the Willamette nose.


Looking back at the process, I'm surprised at how easy it was (even with
thunderstorms and blackouts while it was going on--thank your choice of supreme
being for gas stoves).


Cheers!

Subject: CO2 & Yeast Cell Walls




Hi All,


I'm not an experienced enough brewer to do more than
speculate, but:


The idea of having all of the pressure build up in the 
fermentor because the CO2 may be a good thing leads me 
to ask:


Wouldn't this break the yeast cell walls?  I mean the
argument for using a hydration step in water rather 
than in wort is because of cell damage.  So, wouldn't
the pressure be as bad for the yeasties as tossing
them straight into wort for hydration purposes?


 . . . Unless its because once in the wort and reproducing
they grow stronger - being already hydrated an all . . .


Just a thought,

I often get my liquid yeast mail order from The Frozen Wort, at P.O. Box 988,
Greenfield, MA. 01302. The phone number is (413)773-5920. The guy who runs it
is Charlie Olchowski, a very nice guy. He's also head of the Valley Fermenters,
the homebrew club for the Connecticut River Valley area (in Mass.). I phone my
orders in & he bills me with the shipment. He stocks all the Wyeast varieties.


Another potential source for liquid yeasts is Sierra Nevada beers. Buy a six,
pour off all but the bottom into a pitcher, and then pour the bottom slurry 
from the bottles into a sterilized vessel. Add some pre-sterilized starter
wort (say 1 cup extract in 1 qt. water), an air-lock, and let that go for a
couple days. Once the bubbling slows down or stops, it can be pitched in
your full batch. A friend does this regularly; the Sierra Nevada yeast is
actually the same as one of the Wyeast varieties. 


Of course, any commercial beer that has yeast on the bottom can be prepared
this way.

     Although I can't quite claim that this is an "authentic" altbier recipe
(wrong yeast), it *is* good, and it would probably be just as good with
Wyeast #1007 (German).  Enjoy!


     4# US Two Row (Klages/Harrington)
     3.25# 10L Munich
     4 oz. 80L Crystal
     8 oz. Wheat Malt
     1/2 oz. Black Patent     (just for color :-)
     1/2 oz. 5.5% alpha Willamette (boil)
     1/2 oz. 6.1% alpha East Kent Goldings (boil)
     1 oz. 2.9% alpha Hallertauer (finish)
     Wyeast #1056 (American Ale aka Sierra Nevada) yeast
     2/3 C. Corn sugar (for priming)


     Mash in: 11 qt. water `at` 137F  pH 5.2
     Protein Rest: 30 mins. `at` 131F
     Conversion Rest: 60 mins. `at` 155F
     Mash out: 5 mins. `at` 168F
     Sparge: 5 gal. `at` 170F


     Boil: 90 mins.
     Hops: 2 additions, 45 & 10 minutes before end of boil.


     OG: 1.047
     FG: 1.012


     This is a well balanced brew.  To be closer to authentic, you should age
it for a month in the fridge after bottling and waiting for the brew to 
carbonate.  It's also quite nice aged at room temperature.


     The bittering hops were just what I happened to have on hand (I didn't
have enough Willamette :-).  If one were to worry about the hops they were
using, one could use a heap of Hallertauer for bittering, but I can think of
better uses for such a fine hop.  Perle would serve nicely for bittering.  Of
course, for finishing/dry hopping you could go nuts with various combinations
of Hallertauer, Tetnanger, Saaz, etc.

         0:45:                1 oz Kent Goldings

         1:00:                Cooled; strained off of trub; pitched yeast. OG: 1.043


Racked after six days; primed and bottled after seven more.  FG: 1.008


Heavenly KG aroma; big mouthfeel; nice malt and hop flavors up front, with a
good hop bite going down.  Definitely not Lawnmower Brew.


For those who haven't tried mashing: give it a go.  It's not hard; in fact,
I'm posting this while mashing a wheat beer.


Time to go stir,

Subject: Jack Schmidling's NA Beer (very long!)


Saturday, Jean Hunter ran a Dr. Beer seminar in which several Ithaca
Brewers' Union members were able to taste a standard beer that had
been doctored by adding food grade flavors or by fermentation/storage
conditions.  After we had finished, we had the opportunity to taste
Jack Schmidling's NA homebrew, as well as Freeport NA "brew".  My
analysis of these two NA beers appears below, along with a listing of
some of my judging qualifications.


Judging and Brewing experience: I have been a homebrewer for 3 years,
primarily of ales due to the temperature stability of my basement 
at 60F.  I am currently doing partial mashes; however I will start
doing full mashes with a RIMS unit in the fall.  I will not take the AHA 
Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) Exam for another week; however
I already have 5 judging points from 3 AHA-sponsored competitions
(including 3 from judging the first round of the 1992 AHA Nationals
at Boston).  Disclaimer:  I have no bias towards Jack Schmidling as a
result of any so-called "flame wars", and am no way affiliated with him
or the brewers of Freeport NA.


Freeport NA:  The color is golden to amber, very clear, and conditioning
        is sufficient to produces a moderate head.  The aroma and taste are
        predominately piney or woody in character, and the finish is very
        clean.  I found the flavor profile to be somewhat short, yet 
        surprisingly complex for a NA brew.


Jack's NA:  The beer was in a clear Corona bottle, which enabled us to
        see a small colony (about 1/4" in diameter) floating on the
        surface of the liquid.  Jean Hunter remarked that the colony
        was there when she received the bottle in the mail.  The color
        was pale, however it was very cloudy.  The bottle had been
        refrigerated, so it could have been chill haze; however I didn't
        let the beer warm up to test this hypothesis.  The conditioning
        level was similar to the Freeport.  The aroma was faintly herbal,
        but phenolics were also detectable.  The taste was also herbal,
        with some phenolic astringency in the finish.  The flavor profile 
        of this brew lasted longer than the Freeport; however it seemed more
        like an herbal tea than a beer.  As for the alcohol level, Jean
        has not yet checked this on the chromatograph, so the question
        of distillation efficiency remains unanswered.


Conclusion:  I found both of these brews lacking in the qualities necessary
to define them as beers.  I haven't tried any other commercial versions of
this style and I don't know of any AHA description of this style.  However
if I assign a 29 out of 50 to Freeport (which puts it at the high end of the
good range), then Jack Schmidling's beer would be a 24 (the high end of the
drinkable range).  Both brews suffer from having one-dimensional flavor
profiles, while Jack's loses points in aroma, appearance, flavor, and
overall impression.


    Jack, I recommend that you be extra careful with sanitation, since more
microorganisms can exist at the lower alcohol level (as you are no doubt
already aware of).  Also, since your brew still contains isomerized-hop
and sulphur compounds, you are taking an unnecessary risk of photochemical
damage by using clear bottles.  Hopefully the reason you sent this bottle
to Jean is because you are trying to get rid of it :-)


Cheers,
        Scott Bickham

Subject: Michael Jackson's book "The Gret Beers of Belgium"




I mentioned this book a while back on HBD and the lambic list, since it was
something I was sure many here would be interested in.  I picked up a copy
in Belgium, and have never seen it here.  It was available in both English
and Flemish (I didn't see any in Waloon, though I'd expect it to avaiable in
that, too).  


A number of people asked for the ISBN and other info.  What number, you ask?
I don't remember.  But here it is:


The Great Beers of Belgium, A Complete Guide and Celebration of a Unique
Culture, by Michael Jackson

I bought it in Brugge at this shop:


de reyghere boekhandel

Needless to say, it's a fantastic book.  269 pages.
