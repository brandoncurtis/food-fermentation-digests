Subject: New Amsterdam Ale recipe?


Can anyone recommend a recipe (hopefully extract, but I'll take whatever
I can get) that will duplicate New Amsterdam Ale (New Amsterdam Brewing
Co., Utica NY)?  Barring that, can someone at least tell me what style
of beer it is?


My relatively uneducated guess is that it is some sort of pale ale.  I'm
just a lowly extract brewer with only three batches to my name -- my
first and only IPA attempt has been (so far) somewhat dissapointing.
[Will the oak flavor subside as the beer ages? It's only been a week,
but all I can taste is oak! In reviewing Papazian and the Cat's Meow, I
see that oak is very optional for IPA's -- next time I'll probably leave
it out! But I digress...]


According to the label: "New Amsterdam Ale has a rich malty flavor with
a pleasently bitter aftertaste.  Whole hop flowers are added after
fermentation in a process called `dry hopping' to provide the wonderful
spicy and fruity aroma".  I'll go along with that. It's the spiciness
and fruitiness that distinguishes this ale from others I've tried. Is it
simply a matter of taking a common pale ale recipe and dry hopping with
the proper variety of hops?


So:
        1) can someone suggest an extract recipe? all-grain?
        2) what style does it most closely resemble?
        3) Even w/out a recipe, can you suggest what sort of hops are used?


Is there a book similar to Dave Line's "Brewing Beers Like Those You
Buy" (which I understand deals strictly with british brew), but focusing
on US beers?

This is not necessarily true.  If some bottles gush and others don't it
could very well be improper mixing of the priming sugar.

Why would you want to use an orange cap instead of a stopper and airlock?
Even if you use a blow-off tube, the diameter of the orange thing is too
small (unless you like plugged tubes and carboy bombs).

Subject: clear bottles


With all the junk I have read about clear bottles here in the HBD over the
last couple of years, I finally decided to throw my two cents into the mash.
I keg now, but I bottled for many years.  I far preferred clear (Miller)
bottles to anything else because they showed off the color of the beer so
well.  Oh, Heresy!!  (quick, repeat the mantra: "clear, bad; brown, good" until
he goes away...:-).  Okay, clear bottles plus beer plus light gives problems.
Fine.  I was not in the habit of storing my beer either in the sun or under
flourescent lights.  When I got the bottles I also got these great light-tight
bottle holders (I think they call them "cases" :-)) that the bottles came in.
Once I bottled the beer, I put it into the case (just in case there are some
who don't know what I mean, when long-neck beer bottles are sold by the case
they come in heavy cardboard boxes with split tops that fold together to make
a nice-stackable unit) to condition and age.  Since it is inside the case, the
color of the bottle is irrelevant.  When I got ready to drink it, I placed it
into the refrigerator, another notably dark environment.  So unless you plan
on placing your beer on grocery store shelves or out in then sun don't worry
about the color of the glass.  And clear bottles are prettier.   So there.

I wanted to print out the postscript version of the Cat's Meow but
I had a small problem.  My postscript printer was down.  Since
I did have an HP Laserjet handy, I used Ghostscript 2.4 to create 
a version that would print on the HP.  For 'fun', I also made a version
that should work with the Epson dot matrix printers.  Unfortunately,
the laserjet file was very large, but the Epson file came out to be
about 10 MBytes, 2.5 MBytes when compressed 3.4 MBytes when uuencoded.  


If anyone with an Epson would like to see if this will print out 
I'll break it up and email it to you.


Cheers,

By all means bottle it!  At the fermentation temperatures I use, 57F to
68F (depending on where in the basement I put the carboy), my Wyeast-powered
brews take at least a week to ferment-out and some (like my Orval clone)
take much longer.  If you use dry yeast at 80F, it can ferment-out in 24 hours
(albeit making all kinds of higher alcohols in the process), but there's no
problem having the finished beer sitting around for a week or two.  If you
know it will be sitting around longer than two weeks, you should rack it off
the trub and dead yeast.  Even if the finished beer was to sit around for
four or six weeks, you should bottle it anyway -- the worst thing that will
happen is your beer may develop a slight "yeasty" flavor -- certainly not
bad enough to dump the batch!

Subject: Micro-Mashing


I have been brewing all-grain for about three years now with good
results, but my interest in experimenting with new recipes has led me
to brewing 3 gallon batches. Needless to say this is a lot of work to
go to for such a small batch.


I have come up with a solution that is easy and saves me a lot of
worrying (sorry Charlie). So I will pass on this mashing technique to
the rest of you for comments and such.


1) Cut off the bottom 6 inches off a plastic 5 gallon bucket with a
saber saw or hand saw (don't use a shipping knife, too dangerous).


2) Make sure it fits into your micro-wave oven!


3) Pour in enough water for 5 lbs of cracked malt (about a quart per
pound of grain or slightly more).


4) Set your micro-wave to 70-80% power setting and set the timer for
about 25 minutes (assuming a 600-700 watt oven).


5) Stop the oven every 5 minutes and stir the mash well. Also
check the temperature rise to estimate the amount of time to reach the
first rest point.                                 


6) When the temperature hits 118-122 F stop the oven and let sit for 30
minutes in the oven with the door closed. This is a very important
step if you want haze free beer that ferments well. Something to do
with breaking down long chain proteins and freeing up nutrients for
the yeast. I have never experienced chill haze with or without irish
moss as long as I do a good protein rest.


7) start up the oven again and continue to stop every 5 minutes and
stir well.


8) when the mash hits 155 F stop the oven, stir well and then let rest
for 10 minutes.


9) The temperature will have fallen a few degrees so run the oven for
another few minutes and let rest for 10 minutes.


10) Continue this process for 45 minutes or until the mash passes the
iodine test.(I just wait out the time, the iodine test is a little
tricky to interpret correctly and makes me worry!)


11) Run the oven on full power and stop to stir and check temperature
until the 170 F point has been reached. Let rest for 10 minutes. This
step is also very important because the elevated temperature kills off
enzyme activity that would shift your sugar to dextrins ratio and give
your beer a thin body with a high alcohol content. I forgot this once
and my wort fermented over night to completion. Tasted a little bitter
due to low dextrin content and was thin. On the positive side the beer
was very clean due to the rapid ferment.


12) Sparge as usual and so on ...


Let me know how this works for you, I have used it two times with
consistent results.

I read and re-read the AHA Competition rules a half dozen times (just to
be on the safe side) and I've come to the conclusion that you can enter
a beer in each subcategory.  The reason for my re-reading was because I
brewed a stout in January and it was (in my opinion) halfway between a
dry and a sweet stout, but very good.  So, I entered it in both the
Foreign Stout (stronger version of dry stout) and Sweet Stout subcategories.


Since I was a judge at the Midwestern Regional, I had the opportunity to
look into my stout's progress.  After completing my flight of Traditional
German Bocks, I wandered over to the stout tables.  Alas, neither of my
stouts had made the cut, but both had scored 38.5 (from two *different*
judging teams -- talk about judging consistency!).  I didn't get a chance
to see the score sheets, but I suspect one beer got: "a bit too sweet to
be a Foreign Stout" and the other: "a bit too dry to be a Sweet Stout."


Oh well, back to the old drawing board.


By the way, since the judging was over, I did get a chance to taste
the three Midwestern Stouts heading for the Second Round in Milwaukee.
They *were* measurably better than mine and deserved the 40+ scores they
got.  Heavenly!!!


One final note.  I am convinced that the quality of *all* the beers at the
Second Round of the AHA Nationals will be better than 95% of the commercial
beers in the world and par with the other 5%.  I'm proud to be associated
with Homebrewing, as we all should be.  Charlie, take a bow.

Subject: Dry hopping


Brian asks:
 
        I have noticed lately that many of the subscribers to this
        digest extoll the virtues of dry-hopping. What are the realtive
        advatages/disadvantages of dry-hopping vs. adding flavor hops
        late in the boil ?


No question in my mind -- the room-filling hop bouquets some beers have
are not possible without dryhopping.  Dryhopping is much more efficient
at adding bouquet than adding hops in the last minute of the boil.
Flavor hops are a bit different (in my opinion) than finishing hops.  I
add flavor hops in the last 15 minutes of the boil.  15 minutes will boil
off most of the bouquet, but will add hop flavor.  Finishing hops are
usually added in the last 1 to 5 minutes of the boil.


The disadvantages to dryhopping are:


1. marginally increased chance of infection,


2. slightly more troublesome racking (leaf hops float -- I suggest using
them), and


3. you lose a bit of beer (that which is trapped in the hops) when racking
to the priming bucket.

Hi folks,


   I plan on brewing a serrano pepper beer this week and I need to
know the best way to introduce this into the beer.  I had a pepper
beer at the last Small Brewers Festival in CA that was excellent.
The brewer mentioned using serranos and I think making a tea out of
it.
   My first guess is to make the tea and pour it in with the
finishing hops during the steep. My second thought is to add it
upon racking into the secondary or possibly with the bottling
sugar at bottle time.   Any suggestions?

Subject: odd ingredients


Dear Brewers,


I have a couple of questions (So what else is new, right?!)


First of all, with all of the advise this network sends, there has
been none so valuable as: "What ever happens, never throw out a batch,
unless it turns out to be utterly impalitable (which is, of course, up
to the individual brewer's tastes).  So, my latest lager - that highly
gingered and spruced flavored batch of terpentine - is still sitting
on my back porch in two 1 gal jugs.  However both are acting completely
differently from eachother.  One, which is filled to the neck, is
bubbling and forming a kreausen-like foam (this, after the initial
kreausen fell in the primary and I rached into these 1 gal. secondarys).
but the lock is not passing bubbles!! (?)  There's nothing wrong with
the lock, either.  Finally, the brew is still a familiar milky white-ish
and yeast is still 'swimming' throughout.


The other 1 gal secondary is filled about 3/4 full, but is clearing
and seems healthy enough, with bubbles steadily passing through the lock
and a normal amount of bubbles collecting at the surface.  So, I guess
the question I have about this batch (did I mention that the 1 gal. jugs
contain the same brew - racked from a primary) is, "What gives?"  Why is
one the fuller jug sluggish, and the less-full one behaving?  Could this
result from improper cleaning (although I tend to be maticulous about
cleaning, but this one jug was a *bitch* to clean!)


Ok, now for the second set of questions..


Has anyone used or know about using hearts of palm as an ingredient
in a wort?  Now, before y'all laugh yourselves blue, let me try to
briefly explain:  For about 10 years now my brothers, close friends and
I have been getting together in the Everglades every Christmas for an
all-night campfire and acoustic jam session (we're all acomplished
musicians to various extents).  So, what I want to do is try to capture
in a beer (preferably a lager, but that may prove difficult during the
summer months) that flavor of a campfire in the 'Glades.  So I'm
thinking about a HINT of spruce (not like what's in my present batch)
and a bit of liquid smoke (again, only a hint) and possibly those
palm hearts, reminescent of the palmetto palms in the 'Glades.  So,
if anyone knows anything along these lines, I'd appreciate your
experience and advise.  E-mail me personally if you don't want to
be exposed on the network!!


Thanks!!

I had a first occurance with my last batch.  After the primary was com-

some got into my bottles anyway.  Will this pose a problem?

As close as I can tell, it is like rock candy made from (I forget
now, I believe it was) beets.  When I made my Lambic (still fermenting)
I used, what I thought was, the closest sugar I had in the house:
refined cane sugar.  My theory was, that candy sugar was sucrose.
I don't remember where I read about the candy sugar (Guinard maybe)
but I think it was white.  Comments?

Clearly, Brian, you have never met my Labrador Retriever. This dog will

Deer antlers, turnips, cabbages from the garden and anything the cat
forgets to bury. This weekend I put out pieces of a coconut for the

and licks up the malt that spills. But what does she like best of all?
Of course! The finished product!

 Just so there is no confusion here, the initial load is not a problem on just 
 about any motor larger than the one supplied with the MALTMILL.   The 1/30th 
 HP motor supplied is INTENDED to stall under a load sufficient to cause 
 personal injury.  I do not want to lose my house over what started out as a

 As shipped, it will mill forever if fed grain at the same rate as it comes

 volume user might wish to put on a larger motor but that forces HIM to assume 
 the liability for personal injury.
 
 BTW, there was one very important feature left off of the recent comparison 
 between three malt processors.
 
 The MALTMILL is the only one made in America by Americans.
 
 The Corona is made in Columbia and the Marcato is made in Italy.
 
 Every MALTMILL purchased, keeps one American employed for one day.
 And that includes not only yours truly, but lumberjacks, machinists, screw 
 manufacturers, tool factories, box manufacturers, telephone and 
 communications workers, UPS and a host of other AMERICANS.

Subject: Sierra Nevada Ale yeast


I've seen numerous remarks on culturing the yeast from a bottle of Sierra
Nevada Pale Ale under the assumption that it's the same as Wyeast 1056. When
I toured their brewery, the guide mentioned that they repitch yeast at bottling
time in order to achieve the bottle conditioning. I asked if it was the same as
the brewing yeast. He said that it was a different, more flocculant strain
which stuck well to the bottom of the bottle. Given that their conditioning
temperatures are in the 40s (Farenheit), it would also seem to be a lager
yeast (I didn't ask this).


Anybody have information to the contrary?
