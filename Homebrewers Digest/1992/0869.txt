  Al replited to russ that "candy sugar"  was likely to be cane
or sucrose.  At a talk i attended from the brewmeister of the
"New Belgium Brewery", Ft. Collins, CO...  he mentioned that
"candy sugar" was the secret ingredient of many trappists.
He defined candy sugar at Turbinado or Demura...  Both of which
are available in the grocery store near me.  Look for them tucked
away in the bottom shelf of the sugar section.  They are not big
sellers, and do not get a prominent display space.

The only information I have to the contrary is the information I got when I
took the toor of SN.  The guide, when I asked this very same question, defferred
to one of the other workers (who seemed to be intimately involved in the brewing
process but I didn't get a chance to iquire further) who said that they used only
one yeast type (except for the Bigfoot Barley Wine) for primary, secondary
and bottle conditioning.

          Hello:


          Just two quick questions... I've certainly enjoyed the
          Nitrogen heads found on so many Stouts today, I was
          wondering why this gas give off such a nice head and why it
          isn't used in other beers?


          Secondly, I've noticed over the years that most brewers
          don't usually provide the amount of mash-in water used.  Is
          there a rule of thumb for gallons of water to
          grains mashed in?  I simply eyeball it until I think the
          grain/water ratio is not too think.


          Thanks in advance

Yep.  It's possible they've changed their procedures in the last 10
months, but at a Sensory Evaluation seminar at UCDavis last June I
met a microbiologist from Sierra Nevada who said they condition with
yeast from the fermentors, after an acid wash.  They don't use the
washed yeast for pitching;  only for conditioning.


As an aside, I believe it speaks volumes for Sierra Nevada's
approach to quality that a brewery that size actually HAS such a job
description as "microbiologist".


You mention conditioning temperatures in the 40s;  consider this: 
many ale yeasts that will stay in suspension in the 60s will drop
right out in the 40s, providing as tight a yeast cake as one
could want.  I assume they start the conditioning process at a
warmer temperature and then go down to there, unless they also
artificially carbonate (which would make sense to me).  At those
temperatures, they really don't need to maintain a second yeast
strain.

I've had my share of ballistic carboy caps--okay, maybe more than my share.  I
did several things.


First, I went out and got some tubing with an inner diameter equal to the outer
diameter of the carboy cap's central (larger) opening.  This will give you
about double the cross section of the tubing-inside-the-opening arrangement.


Second, and more important, I made sure to filter my wort when putting it into
the carboy.  Nothing fancy, just passed it through a kitchen strainer and into
a funnel that has a plastic screen in the bottom.  This is particularly handy
when whole hops have been used.  Even when in a boiling bag, some of the bracts
sneak out with the sole intent of clogging your blowoff tube.  It takes a
little longer to get it into the carboy, but what gets into the carboy stays
there!


The best solution is to do something discussed here recently.  Let the break
material settle out a bit and rack the wort off the trub before fermentation
gets going.  I did this for a barley wine and left behind a gallon(!) of break
material.  I can only imagine the carboy cap fireworks that might have ensued
with that batch!


Since I've taken these steps, I've had no more bottle rockets and no more irate
telephone calls from my wife after finding hops on the ceiling.  But I probably
won't be able to replicate that batch of "Calamity Amber".  Such is life.

Subject: pepper beer 


I would suggest adding the pepper as late in the process as possible.


Long ago I made a hot pepper mead. I put the peppers (crushed red) in
the boil at the start. I cooled it and pitched it. Talk about a slow
start! There was no krausen for the first 3 or 4 weeks. My theory is
that there were only a few yeast cells that could stand up to the
anti-biotic properties of the hot peppers and it took them that long
to take over the must.


Were I you, I'd roast the peppers and try either dry-peppering in the
secondary or the bottles themselves (smile when you drink that beer).

As Al said in HBD #868 go ahead and bottle it.  I just bottled a batch of
Stout that had been sitting 11 weeks in the primary (about 2 months longer
than I planned).  The uncarbonated beer tasted fine, a bit thin but due to
the recipe not the bottling lag.


On another note I'ld just like to say that I've been reading HBD for a week
now and am pleased with what I've seen.

 >Subject: Jack Schmidling's NA Beer (very long!)
 
 >Saturday, Jean Hunter ran a Dr. Beer seminar in which several Ithaca
 Brewers' Union members were able to taste a standard beer that had
 been doctored by adding food grade flavors or by fermentation/storage
 conditions.  After we had finished, we had the opportunity to taste
 Jack Schmidling's NA homebrew, as well as Freeport NA "brew".  My
 analysis of these two NA beers appears below, along with a listing of
 some of my judging qualifications.
 
 >Jack's NA:  The beer was in a clear Corona bottle, which enabled us to
         see a small colony (about 1/4" in diameter) floating on the
         surface of the liquid.  Jean Hunter remarked that the colony
         was there when she received the bottle in the mail.  The color
         was pale, however it was very cloudy.  The bottle had been
         refrigerated, so it could have been chill haze; however I didn't
         let the beer warm up to test this hypothesis.  The conditioning
         level was similar to the Freeport.  The aroma was faintly herbal,
         but phenolics were also detectable.  The taste was also herbal,
         with some phenolic astringency in the finish.  The flavor profile
         of this brew lasted longer than the Freeport; however it seemed more
         like an herbal tea than a beer.  As for the alcohol level, Jean
         has not yet checked this on the chromatograph, so the question
         of distillation efficiency remains unanswered.
 
 I am not sure if I should be just irritated or downright outraged at all 
 this.
 
 After being accused of everything biggotry to being a charlatain, I sent Jean 
 some samples to be analyzed for alcoholic content on Mar 16.  I also included 
 a complementary copy of "Brew It At Home" as a token of appreciation for her 
 help.   I have sent mail to her three times since sending the samples and she 
 has declined to respond and this is the first feedback I have received.
 
 There were four different samples, produced in different ways and none of 
 them were intended to represent anything other than samples for chemical 
 analysis.   There was only one that I would even consider drinkable.  One was 
 boiled to reduce the volume by 50% another was a blend of 4 different beers, 
 one was in a plastic bottle and none were aged or cleared prior to sending.
 
 In the future, I will have a hard time taking criticism of my articles 
 seriously.  
 
 >Jack, I recommend that you be extra careful with sanitation, since more
 microorganisms can exist at the lower alcohol level (as you are no doubt
 already aware of).
 
 As a matter of fact, I was no uninterested in anything but the alcoholic 
 content that I didn't even sanitize the bottles.  I just rinsed and filled 
 them.  I might have done a lot of things differently had I not been deceived 
 as to the purpose.
 
 >Also, since your brew still contains isomerized-hop and sulphur compounds, 
 you are taking an unnecessary risk of photochemicaldamage by using clear 
 bottles.  Hopefully the reason you sent this bottle to Jean is because you 
 are trying to get rid of it :-)
 
 What you think of as a joke, is precisely why I used the clear bottles.  They 
 are from Miller High Life and I only use them when I don't care what the beer 
 tastes like or when I can control the environment.
 
 Now that you have all had your fun, is it asking to much to answer the only 
 question the samples were sent to address.
 
 What is the alcohol content?

Subject: Vienna recipes (George Fix)


Laurie and I would like to thank Craig Olzenak for his kind comments
about our book. After a initial trimming of potential recipes we
decided to go with whatever formulations did the best in sanctioned
competitions, independent of our personal preferences. There were no
conflicts with the standard Vienna, and it is the formulation that
won 1st in the '87 nationals. It also won best of show in the EHA
competition in New Orleans of that year. It has also proven to be
quite serviceable for the most important use of homebrew, namely as
a beer to have on hand for visitors and special social events.


We started to "debug" the festival beer (Marzen/Oktoberfest) in '88, and
this one caused us considerable grief. The first version, still our favorite,
used the recipe on page 57 except 120 degree caramel malt was used instead
of the 20 degree. We share Craig's love of the dark malt flavors! However
and alas, the version was clobbered in competitions. Typical comments
included "way too big for style", "dark malt flavors are overpowering",
and in Texas competitions (Dixie Cup) it was criticized for being
underhopped. The latter is a predictable regional response, but one
with some validity. We tried a lot of different things including different
yeast strains and higher hopping rates, but the overall performance was
generally poor. In 1990 we started cutting back on the dark malt
profile, and in particular started using the 20 degree malt. We also
started using English caramel malt exclusively. The effect of these two
changes was dramatic. It won 1st place in the 1990 LA Fair, the 1990
Riverside Cal Fair, the 1990 Dixie Cup, and the 1991 Bidal Society
Comp. in Wisc. It was also entered in the New England conf., however
that one was sharply marked down for being overhopped. The last time it
was entered was the 1991 nationals where it won 3rd place. The two beers
that came in front of it were in the standard Vienna motif, and it
has been our experience that this version (SG=1.050-1.055) will generally
do better than the festbier (SG=1.060-1.063). All of the commercial 
"Oktoberfests" available in the US fall into the lower part of the first 
gravity range, and apparently most judges not to mention basic beer drinkers 
have grown accustomed to the lower gravity versions, although a SG in the
range 1.050-1.055 is hardly a weak beer. 




P.S. Those going to the microbrewer's conference next week in Milwaukee
should stop by the Brewers Research and Development Co.'s booth and say hello.
There will be some exciting new equipment on display. JV Northwest and Pub
Systems can be counted on to display some interesting things as well. All of
this should give one an indication of the striking technological revolution
that has been taking place these last few years vis a vis equipment for small
scale brewing.

I've just used Wyeast for the second time.  The first time, I brewed a
stout with 1007.  It had a wonderfully high kreausen (>3" !).  This
time, I'm brewing a Pale Ale with 1028.  It's producing CO2 like a
banshee but the kreausen is less than 1" high.  Is this characteristic
of the yeast or my wort (or is it common for the kreausen height to
vary)?  In other words: what in the wort is going on here?  :-)
