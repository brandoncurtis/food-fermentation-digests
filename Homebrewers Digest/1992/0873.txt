In case you were all wondering what happened to the digest on Tuesday
and Wednesday, here's the story. Late Monday afternoon, a manager
armed with our root password though that my disk was a tape drive
and successfully wrote a tar image to it, thus destroying part of the
filesystem containing all the digest scripts. I just finished piecing
it all back together, and I think the digest should pick up where
it left off. Thank you all for relaxing and not freaking out!

I just bought an Airstat from American Brewmaster (I think that was the name).
They advertised the airstat in the latest issue of Zymurgy.  I don't have the

  A couple of hops questions:


  It is thought to be a good idea to allow just 3 or 4 shoots to grow.  I've 
got a plant with 6 very healthy shoots. I was thinking of having 3 lines, with 
2 shoots on each line.  Good idea? Bad idea?


  Does the method of making a plant split into 2 main branches by snipping
off the top work for hops?

It is my understanding (from Charlie's TCJoHB, I believe) that TSP
(trisodium phosphate) is a good cleaner (for label removal, I believe),
but not a sanitizer.  I believe George Fix introduced Iodophor to the
HBD and recommends it for SS because Chlorine Bleach reacts with SS.


I purchased a bottle of Iodophor a few months ago, but had been
hesitant to use it, not knowing the proper concentration to use.
As an experiment, I bottled a batch where half the bottles were
sanitized with 200ppm Iodophor and half with 200ppm Chlorine Bleach.
After sanitizing (with one of those Italian-made, red-and-white
bottle sanitizers) I rinsed with hot tapwater using my Jet bottle
washer.


Two weeks later, all the Iodophor bottles have ring-around-the-collar.
None of the Bleach bottles do (yet -- see NOTICE).


NOTICE:  I had recently developed a ring-around-the-collar problem
in my brewery (read, basement).  I was using 100-200ppm Chlorine
Bleach but was not changing it (I would used the same gallon of
sanitizing solution for the entire batch -- bad idea).  I had gotten
cocky and my sanitation had become lax.  I've since become more
careful when sanitizing and have not had problems with the ring-around
 -the-collar (knock on wood).  Note, that some bottles had more RATC
and some had less.  Some brews did not have any.  When it did appear,
it would show up as pinhead-sized dots at the liquid level, unevenly
spaced around the entire circumferance.  I will check for a correlation
with dryhopping tonight.


I just re-read a personal email conversation with George, who said that
the Chlorine in my municipal water will (to some degree) counteract
the Iodophor.  He suggested that I add more Iodophor till a "good color
is established."  Hmmm. Maybe I should have added more Iodophor?
The Iodophor I'm using has an indicator which makes the solution amber
when it is working and clear when it should be changed.  The solution
I used was about the color of American Light Lager.  Maybe I should
have added Iodophor till the color was like Bass Ale?  George?  Maybe
the problem is in my water (Palos Hills municipal -- purchased from
Chicago South branch)?


Has anyone identified the creature(s) responsible for ring-around-the
 -collar?  I assume it's aerobic since it only hangs out at the liquid
level.  I have not tasted any acidity in any of my RATC brews -- I had
assumed, therefore, that it was a mold.  In fact, I have not noticed any
ill-effects from the RATC other than cosmetic.  Comments?

Subject: Light-struck beer


I had read in the HBD, that a week or two in the dark at 50F will "cure"
light struck beer.  I just finished a six of Newcastle Brown Ale.  I recall
that the beer was stored at room temp under fluorescent lights in the store.
The first bottle (1 day of chilling at 50F) smelled skunky.  Subsequent
bottles (after a week or so at 50F) did not have a skunky smell.  Anyone
else notice this phenomenon?

You goofed in your calculations somewhere.  According to the Zymurgy
Hop Special Issue (I use this issue so much I should buy another one ;^),
"Steam"-clones should have 40 IBU.  According to the calculations in
the Hop Special Issue, if you are making 5 gallons with a boiling gravity
under 1050 and want 40 IBU using a 60 minute boil of 8.5%AA hops, you
should use 1.051077 ounces of hops.  I suggest rounding to 1 oz.


I don't have my copy here at work so I cannot accurately calculate the
actual IBU you used (you didn't post the boil gravity anyway), but
a thumbnail calculation would indicate you got somewhere around 32 IBU.


DON'T DISCOUNT BOIL GRAVITY -- I DID ONCE ON A 1084 BOIL AND WILL NEVER
FORGET TO DO IT AGAIN!  The IPA I made would go well on pancakes.

Well we are finally finished here in San Francisco.  We concluded our judging
of 761 entries this past Saturday.  With the exception of having a few larger
flights than we'd have liked, everything went pretty much as we planned.


I'd like to say "Thanks!" to all who participated.  We had a great turnout of
judges, stewards, and volunteers.


Special "Thanks!" to Bruce Joseph and Anchor for allowing us to disrupt the
brewery for the month of April.


Now on to Milwaukee!

1.  Kilning is important because it begins the destruction of the enzymes,
    which is continued into the mash process.  Ordinary drying will not do
    this.  Kilning the malts also changes the color of malts by producing
    melanoidins via the Maillard reaction.  DMS is also destroyed in the
    strong kilning that pale ale malts undergo.


2.  Alkaline steep waters can check microbial growth and steep phenolic
    materials from the grain.  Non-Reinheitsgebot maltsters sometimes use
    gibberic acid or potassium bromate to reduce malting losses.  A
    decent reference on this is "Malting and Brewing Science", ed. by
    D.E. Briggs et.al., London; New York: Chapman and Hall (1981-82). I
    don't know if you can find this book, but it is kept on reserve here
    at one of the Cornell libraries.


3.  I remember reading that if the malt is dried correctly, then the roots
    fall off very easily.  They actually have a high nutritional value for
    livestock, so maltsters go through great efforts to recover and sell
    the roots.


Keep us posted - this is something I'm interested in trying someday.

Subject: Pepper experience




Sorry I'm lagging a bit on my response, but I did want to put in my 2"
worth.  A while back, my brother decided to try making some stir-fry
dish from scratch.  The recipe called for roasted red peppers (the HOT
kind...).  My mom and I just just happened to be in the house at the
time he decided to roast the peppers...


He put them in a small skillet and started dry-roasting them on the
stove.  After a few seconds, they started giving off a light smoke. 
All of a sudden, my brother started coughing like he couldn't stop,
then ran outside with the skillet.  I went into the kitchen to see if
he was alright, and I started coughing too.  I had to run outside and
join him, where we both just stood there coughing.  After about 10
minutes, we were finally able to go back into the kitchen.  We ended
up opening all the doors just to get rid of the fumes.  When we'd
finally thought the house was pretty much free of fumes, we heard this
endless coughing coming from upstairs - turns out the fumes had drifted
up there too!  


Anyway, the moral of this story is, if you're planning on roasting red
peppers (for beer, or whatever), do it outside on the barbecue and
wear a bandana - the fumes are unbearable!  BTW, the peppers tasted
great!

Ok, I finally ordered a refrigerator thermostat and I hope to make
my first lager this weekend, a pilsner.


I know that these are traditionally made from less modified
malts which require a protein rest, but I plan to use
fully modified British pale malt and do a single stage
infusion in a picnic cooler, unless someone here can
successfully talk me out of it.


Are there any *REAL* problems with making a pilsner from
British malt, such as serious off flavors?  I know the
color should be okay, since I've made very pale beers
from the same malt.


Thanks for your consideration,

Not exactly.  Under the new system, only one beer is required for the
first round.  "Winners" of the first round (three beers in each category)
are notified (by May 8th this year, I believe) and asked to send another
two bottles for the second round judging.  I don't know exactly what
happens to the extra bottles if brewers send three instead of one to the
first round.

Not quite.  The brewer's are asked to send a second and third bottle for
the second round.  One of these bottles will be used for the second round
judging.  The other will be used if the beer wins first place in the
category and goes on to the "Best of Show" judging.

Simply put:  a) yes; b) no; c) no problem in your backyard; propane cookers are
not recommended for indoor use, but you can get away with it if your area is
VERY WELL ventilated (open windows, doors); d) many sources -- Alternative
Beverage in NC sells the simple and effective Cajun Cooker, as do others.


I've used a propane burner for over a year now, and definitely recommend one 
as a fairly inexpensive alternative to slow, stove top boiling.  If you thought
you had a good rolling boil before, think again.  You'll also easily cut an
hour off your brewing schedule by reaching that boil substantially faster.  Go
for it!

Subject: Fining without cruelty


Dear HBD,


I usually fine my beer, a day or two before moving from secondary
to barrel, with either gelatin or ininglass. This works fine, and
I get crytal-clear beer after 4-5 days in barrel (of course, it
may clear OK without fining, but I've never tried it). The problem is,
my partner is a vegetarian, and objects to my putting animal products
in the beer she drinks. Up to now, I've managed to convince her that
all the fining agent drops out of the final product, but I'm not sure
that's too convincing. My question is: is there a fining agent which
I can use with a clear conscience? 


I brew mainly ales with the occasional Pilsner (the latter brews tend
to be significantly cloudier, probably protein haze due to my
inefficient decoction mash technique).


P.S. Can someone send me an address/phone/FAX number for Zymurgy
so that I can get an overseas subscription?

 Great minds travel the same roads.  My wife and I were poring over my 
 collection of winemaking books trying to integrate all the recipes and 
 procedure into one that makes sense.  Talk about contradictions and 
 momilies...  
 
 Steep one day... steep seven days.
 Remove all the green calixes..  don't bother.
 Steep in boiling water...  never boil.
 Don't steep at all, just ferment the whole mess.
 
 My wife spotted a vacant factory with about an acre of yellow but you just 
 know the day we go to pick, the lawn mowers will be pulling away.
 
 I am pure culturing Red Star champaign yeast for this project so I can't 
 start till the yeast is ready and we are shooting for this weekend.
 
 >I'm up scaling the following 1 gallon recipie:
 
         4 pints dandelion flowers (as little "green" as possible)
         18 oz chopped sultanas (white raisins)
    
 Thank you.... we were wondering what sultanas were...  My wife suggested 
 sultans' wives.
 
 
         1 1/2 lbs corn sugar
         3 teaspoons citric acid
         2 camden tablets
 
 Here is what we came up with:
 
 4  gallons dandelions
 4  gallons water
 8  lemmons
 4  lb raisins
 10 lb sugar
 
 
 Bring water to boil.  Dump in the stuff and pitch when cool.
 
 >The recipie calls for making a "dandelion tea" by steeping the flowers in
 a warm water for 24 hours.  I've done this part and the "tea" is a yellow-
 brown color with a very grassy smell and taste.  Is this what is supposed to
 happen? I've tasted and smelled the flowers very carefully and quite frankly
 they don't taste like much at all. Will some "magic" happen durring fementation
 and aging (not at all uncommon in this type of endevor)?
  
 I think the whole thing is a conspiracy.  It seems like dandelion wine is to 
 wine what Bud is to beer.  I made some years ago but have no recollection of 
 how or what it tasted like but like you, I was itching to give it a whirl.

 All of those sound pretty important to me.  One you missed is that it would 
 rot during the 4 to six week curing period if the water content was not 
 reduced to very low levels.
 
 The most obvious and important probably is the taste.  It just does not taste 
 like malt if just dried.  The kilining brings out the sweet malty flavor.

     speed up the sprouting process more than is preferrable.)
 
 Rinsing three or four times a day should keep the bacteria to undetectable 
 levels and is just good hygene.  Anything you mix with the grain will be 
 absorbed and get into the beer.  Stick with water.
 
 > * Is there an easy way to remove the roots from the grain?  Is it really
     necessary to bother?
 
 By the time it is ready to kiln, they sort of take care or themselves.  I 
 just reverse the drying fan and they just blow away.
 
 >Some have said that feedstore barley has the wrong protein content for
 making beer.  I don't buy this.  It may be inappropriate for some
 styles of beer, or for making light beers.
 
 The only problem I have had with feedstore barley is a 50% viability which 
 means that 50% of my malt is rotting barley.  As I had no other source, I 
 gave up.
 
 BTW, congratualtions on taking home brewing one step further.  No one will 
 accuse you of being a cake mix brewer.

Subject: USE OF GELATIN


Continuing the questions about finings:


How do people like to use gelatin in beer?  Does it work for clarification?
It's supposed to snag the suspended yeast and pull it to the bottom.
If I put gelatin in at bottling time, will I have problems with achieving
carbonation?  Will I get carbonation at all?


Please advise.
thanks.
