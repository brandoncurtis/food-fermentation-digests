Subject: Driving across america...


I'm finishing classes May 8, and heading west for the summer...


Since I have spare time, I'd love to check out 'the sights' as I go, but
don't recall if an archived index exists for these or if I need to rely
on HBD member suggestions.  Just in case, my current itinerary is FLEXIBLY:


     Burlington VT -- Rochester NY -- Pittsburg  PA -- St Louis  MO --
       Lawrence KS -- Denver    CO   then either to -- Flagstaff AZ before
going thru Utah or -- Laramie/Cheyenne & Jackson WY.


I'm also a blues-music nut, so any knowlege on where to go for that in
St Louis is appreciated.  Please let me know if you've got favorites along
this path that I should look into, be it brewpubs, breweries, browse-worthy
suppliers, etc.  For that matter, if you need an excuse to visit your
favorite hangout, give me contact info and I'll buy you a (what else?!).


Thanks in advance,

Subject: Recycling Yeast


Fellow Brewers,


        I am looking for a less maintenance intensive yeast 'culturing'
        method. I have Leistad's book on the subject, and thanks to the
        contributors to the HBD I have many other 'primers'. BUT, I am by
        no stretch of the imagination a micro-biologist AND I have no
        wish to be (all of the primers and Leistad's book advocate the
        microbiological approach).


        I have seen numerous mention of people re-using the yeast slurry
        from the primary or secondary. Would anyone care to post a
        procedure/process/primer on how to get 2-3 batches from one
        packet of yeast (liquid or otherwise).
        
        I guess what I am after, is a means of storing yeast for a period
        of time AFTER it has been used to make a batch and re-using said
        yeast to make another batch. 


        I hope that the great wealth of knowledge represented here can
        come to the aid of people like me who have neither the time to
        be a mad scientist (not intended as a flame) or the knowledge,
        equipment, space, patience, etc... etc... Thanks in advance to
        any and all who respond.


        Yours in brewing,

Hi everyone!


I just made reservations to spend my honeymoon in Maui next month
(gloat gloat :-).  Does anyone know of any local brews or microbreweries
to visit?  I have a feeling that we are going to work up quite a
thirst lolling around the white sand beaches worshipping the sun...
Thanks in advance.

Thanks to everyone who commented on my dandelion wine query.  It seems
there is little optimism that it will be more than raisin/sugar
wine.  My batch is currently fermenting and I'll post the results 
in a few weeks/months.  
        I have a recipie for rose petal wine, maybe that will be next.

Well, I called BAA last night after strong encouragement from several HBDers,
and they confirmed that they do indeed ship nationally (sorry, forgot to ask 
about HI, AK, territories of overseas).  Needless to say, I joined up.
I am curious about the packaging - anyone have good / bad experiences with
breakage, etc.??  Thanks to all who wrote me,   Volker radavfs`at`ube.ub.umd.edu

I have had good luch broiling chilis in my electric oven. Place the
chilis about 6" from the heat element and broil until the skin blisters.
Then turn the chilis over and do the other side. Let them cool, then
peel the skin off - it comes off easily. I used do a couple grocery
sacks full in the fall and freeze them for year round use. Yum! I never
tried them in beer, though beer does go well with chili flavored food...


A word of warning - use plastic gloves. The oil is powerful enough to
cause pain for hours if you don't!

Here's an example of one other thing not to worry about.
Water (and presumably beer) is essentially an incompressible
fluid. That means that if you push on the top of it harder
basically nothing happens. If you don't believe me try 
squeezing a completely full plastic soda bottle (no air in
the top now - that's cheating) and a completely empty
(except for air) soda bottle. The full one will deform but
not compress.


It's true that more CO_2 goes into solution under pressure
but that's because of the surface interaction. The gas
diffuses both ways across the surface but the bubbles 
coming out of the beer say "Woha, too much pressure
out there. I'm going back into the beer to relax!"


The bottom line is that you shouldn't have to worry about
yeast cell walls. The purpose of hydrating is to reduce 
osmotic pressure which is a completely different story.


If you really want to put your beer under CO_2 pressure
while fermenting (and I'm still unclear why) then you need
to use some sort of relief valve. A cheap one is to blow off
into a column of water. Unfortunately to get an extra 1.5 atm 
of pressure you need a 50 foot column of water :-)

Subject: Stout (or is it Porter) Recipe


 Stout, or is it Porter by another name?


 5 gallon batch 


 Grains:
         1 Lb roasted barley
         1 lb Crystal (~100 lovibond)
         1 lb pale malt
         2 oz black patent
 crack, put in bruheat with 6 gal or so, in grain bag.


 Rest at 110-115 for 15 minutes.


 Mash circa 150 for about 40 minutes (full conversion via
 iodine test and wait a bit) There's not really much to convert.


 Sparge, but don't cook the flippin' hulls.


 Add:
         1 Can (1.5kg) John Bull Dark unhopped 
         1 Can (1.5kg) John Bull Amber unhopped
 (I'm sure somebody else's unhopped extract would do just fine, too.)


 Boil until hot break starts.  Skim well.  Either this likes
 to throw scum or my grain cracking is bad, but who cares.


 Add 1 oz galena hops. Boil for 45 min or so, skimming when necessary.
 You will find some scum here, too.


 Add a pinch of irish moss.
 Wait 5 minutes.


 Add 1/2 oz fuggles and 1 oz cascades,
 and boil for 5 minutes.  Before boil stops, bring total
 volume to about 5.5 gal, of which you'll use 5 gal.


 Cool (I use immersion chiller-  expect a cold break, too)


 Rack to carboy.


 Pitch with Whitbread's Ale yeast (I plan to try some
 Wyeast as soon as I get the chance, but I have nothing
 against Whitbreads.). I don't use a blowoff, but
 I do have a spare bathroom with a spare bathtub to
 put the carboy in.  I just use a good ol' s-lock.   


 Starts at somewhere around 1.045 (I don't let it cool far
 enough to know for sure.)


 Finishes in about a 1.5 week for me at about 1.23 or so, circa
 64-65 deg. F  There are lots of unfermentables in this beer, no kidding.


 Rack back to bruheat, prime with 1/2 C light DME 
 boiled in 1qt of water or so. Stir cooled priming liquid
 into bruheat.


 Bottle.


 **NOTE** this beer has enough unfermentable stuff in it that
 you do NOT want wild yeast in it, or you will get gushers
 that taste rather (as he mixes his metaphors) like something 
 you'd rather see in an old Godzilla movie.  So, get out
 that chlorox and b-brite.)(NO! Don't MIX them. No! No! NO!)


 It conditions sorta slow, it's not dried out for about
 three weeks here.


 This tastes a bit like Sheaf stout, but without the
 "I'm too old" flavor.  After it sits on the tongue,
 it's sweeter (but not at first taste, you need to break
 some of the higher sugars with your pepsin first).


 It's hoppier, it could probably stand to condition
 a while longer.  I've thought to add some cara-pils
 but I have yet to get around to it.


 Head retention is so-so.


 People must like it, I've gone through the last batch in about
 2 weeks after conditioning, with lots of cheerful help.

  OFFICE MEMO          yeast culturing addendum              
Date:5/1/92
i hope you liked my last post. i wish to thank larry stuntz for
reviewing
it, he pointed out a few things that i may need to clarify. first of
all, the solid agar should be gelantinous, but stronger than jello.
therefore, when streaking a plate, be gentle. keep the loop on top and
do not  mar the  the surface. if you wish to scale the recipe, shoot
for 2% (w/v) agar. my quantity was a guess, but it is plenty. agar is
derived from red algae,  and its quality is dependent on its purity.
for homebrewer's purposes, it does not have to be real high grade.
therefore, i think that the chinese agar-agar (found in oriental marts)
would probably be fine.

Hi folks,


Sorry to flame, but I am really getting tired of some individual (whose initals 
are js) who just can not post a message without the obligatory "real" brewer 
BS. Any time I read a post from this individual I just stop relaxing because I
know his arrogance and self-importance will creep into it somehow. The most 
recent posting by this "real" homebrewer went on pretty innocently, but alas it
was too good to be true, for the last line was


> BTW, congratualtions on taking home brewing one step further.  No one will
> accuse you of being a cake mix brewer.


I do not care what your or anyones definition of brewing is. I make beer.
Period. I and my friends enjoy it, and I will continue to make it the way
I prefer to make it. 


Drop it already, guy. We are getting sick of it and it only continues to lessen
your credibility with us.


For the rest, I am sorry to flame, but it's really been annoying. We are all 
sharing a rewarding hobby here, and I enjoy learning more about it. However I
do not enjoy the few people who have to lord advanced techniques over us. I 
respect the extra effort that goes into all-grain brewing, but do not respect
those who do not respect us.


So if you don't like it or my extract brewing, you can bite me. To the rest,
keep the good advice and questions coming.


Relax,
