Subject: Hop poles




Sorry I didn't think of mentioning it earlier, but I think I found
a truely great way to grow/harvest hops.  Make a flag pole and run
the hop strings up it for growing, and lower for harvest.


I did this this year by taking 4 10' 2x4's and joined them with LOTS
of screws to make a 20' 4x4.  Then I rigged it with two sets of
pulleys (needed to run a flag as well as hops :) and planted it 5
feet in the ground.  Finally, I attached a 2" ring on the hop side
cord and then attached strings to the ring.  Finally I took staked
the other end of the hop ropes to the ground, adjusted the lengths,
and ran them up the pole.  I now have 9 very happy vines growing
that are easily over 9 feet tall.  I'm really looking forward to
harvest this year!

The strawberries are ripe, and my wife picked lots of them!  I'm
interested in making a strawberry mead, and while I'm quite capable of
inventing a recipe myself, I'm happy to listen to other people's ideas
on how to go about it.  So, how would you go about it?

Subject: Beer Head and Fruit




Brewers,


I have one comment and one question:


1. Regarding the point at which fruit should be added in the homebrewing
process, my conclusion was the following: Adding fruit anywhere in the
boil would cause haze in the end. Therefore, assuming that a lighter style
beer is the desired product my intention with my first batch next month
is to add it to the secondary so that bacteria and the wild things are
not encouraged due to the alcohol content present there. However, should
a darker beer be sought (cherry stout for instance), I do not believe there
should be a problem in adding the fruit to the boil, if appearance is all
that is at stake.


2. I have about two years and a few dozen batches behind me now and I have
a question regarding beer head. I have brewed both extract and grain beers,
but I have the persistent problem of a short-lived head. Meaning that the
head does not last long in the glass soon after it is poured. Initially
after the beer is poured it is a nice uniformly small-bubbled creamy head
but does not last long. I had a problem with crushing my grain too finely
which I have corrected. I also thought about how much detergent may have
been used in cleaning the glasses and have corrected that already. Could
water quality affect head? Could the presence of both cold and hot break
in the fermenter destroy head? I could use some experience and knowledge
on this issue. 


Thanks

Howdy All,


Someone posted, not too long ago, about an Italian grain mill (Marcado?) that I can't seem to
find anywhere in the state of Virginia.


Could the poster of that message, or anyone who knows where to get one, email me 
about it.  I'd really be dysfunctionally happy if I could find one.


A thousand thanks,


Alan

The entry fees never have, nor do I think ever will, cover the cost of
BIG prizes.  I assume that you are talking about trips to Norway, etc.
These BIG prizes are provided by sponsors.  I am not associated with the
AHA other than being a member (I'm not an officer or anything -- I'm not
even a Zymurgy author yet), but I'll bet the AHA (as well as its membership)
would be very grateful if you could convince a few importers or breweries
to sponsor some prizes.


I believe that annually, the AHA prints a financials report.  I've seen one
and I assure you that no one at the AHA is getting rich.


Maybe someone who knows for sure, can comment on where the $7.50/$9.50
goes.


Al.

Well, I don't enter for the prizes.  I enter for the feedback (of
course, I'm not expecting to win any prizes at this stage in my
brewing development) and recognition of my peers.  I say, if you're
only in it for the money, good riddance!

Subject: Fine sediment




               I want to say thanks to all those who answered my query re.
          beer styles. It helped alot for all of us novice brewers in my
          brewgroup, FAB. Now I have another question!
               Last evening I tried some of my latest brew - a lager,
          probably actually a steam or common beer (thanks) - and noticed a
          deposit of fine sediment up the sides of the bottle, almost to
          the neck. When poured, this fine material mixed with the beer
          making it cloudy. I did not notice an off flavour - actually it
          was quite good :-) - but the beer did not look pleasing. Is this
          normal (i.e. does it happen often)? How could I have prevented
          it? I did rack into a secondary fermenter and racked again just
          before bottling.

You should pre-boil the water you use in your mash, in order to
driver off the chlorine.  If you don't, the chlorine will create
a buffer, and the grains will not lower the ph appropriately. 
>From my experience, if I did not boil off the chlorine, I could
not get the mash ph below 5.8 or 5.9, no matter how much gypsum I
added, but if I pre-boiled the water, I could reach the recommended
mash ph of 5.3 quite easily.


Now days I preboil the mash water and add a tsp of gypsum and leave
it at that, especially when making dark beers; It's hard to get an
accurate reading when the dark malts in the wort stain the ph paper.

Hi,


   I was wondering if someone could tell me ..... When brewing all grain
beer, why you need to boil the whole batch at once in one pot? Why can't
you do it like with extracts and boil 2-3 gallons and add them to preboiled
cooled water in the fermenter?

Subject: Brewing at high altitude


Just another data point:  At a Belgian beer tasting I attended at the 
Brickskeller in DC a few weeks back, the owner of the New Belgium Brewery in
Boulder, CO, mentioned the first time he tried to send some of his wonderful
trappist ale (previously found mostly at elevations above 6,000 feet), the
stuff was pretty flat.  So if you're used to acieving a certain degree of 
carbonation with X amount of priming sugar, consider increasing it if the
beer will be consumed closer to sea level.  That way, you'll have a nice
foamy head on your homebrew (which you're drinking to help you not worry about
the toothpaste tube that exploded in your underwear) when you visit friends
in San Francisco.

I finally came to the conclusion that I want to try to innoculate a
30 gallon batch of wort by starting the yeast like this...


petri dish -> quart mason jar -> gallon jug 


To this end I have aquired a real nice (brand -> 'All American') 
mondo size pressure cooker.  It will hold a gallon glass jug (the 
kind apple juice comes in) with an air lock, upright.  I am looking 
for a autoclavable air lock of the type which can do reverse flow 
(for when it cools).  Anyone know where I can get such a beast, or 
have an idea for how to make one?


tnx!
