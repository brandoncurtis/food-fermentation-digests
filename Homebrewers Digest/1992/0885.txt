 >I have a rather large ten gallon brewpot that was a gift from my father in
 which I brew everything including extract and all grain. When I am doing
 all grain brews however, I must lug this thing with about 5-7 gallons of
 boiling hot liquid through my kitchen, living room, down a flight of stairs,
 across my basement to my workshop which is where I have an area cool enough
 (unfinished part of the basement) to ferment anytype of ale or lager.
 
 The most obvious step would be to chill the wort in the kitchen before moving 
 it downstairs.
 
 If your are going to ferment in the kettle, all you need is enough gal jugs 
 to hold the wort till you get it cleaned out and moved downstairs.  If you 
 have a separate fermenter, you only need one.  The aeration it gets being 
 glugged from the jug into the fermenter is also useful for oxyginating the 
 wort prior to pitching.
 
 Personally, I would never carry boiling stuff around.  You are just asking 
 for trouble.

 whether your sparge water level is above or below the top of the

 I'll post a summary of the responses I receive.
 
 Now I suppose tomorrow's Digest will be flooded with answers.  I assumed 
 there would be no shortage of responses.
 
 Here's the word from the World's Greatet Brewery, the home of ARF Generic 
 Ale......
 
 Unless you can spray the sparge water, evenly over the entire surface for the 
 total sparge time, it is most efficient to keep the water level above the 
 grain top.  This keeps the whole mess in solution until you are into the 
 dregs.
 
 >Sparge water amount:
 
 >I'm planning a brew using 15lbs of pale malt.  Using 1 qt/lb of grain,
 I'll be using 4 gallons of water in the mash.
 
 Sounds a little stiff.  But the important point is that you have a nice 
 creamy "dough-in".  It should be about the consistancy of runny oatmeal.  I 
 use 3.5 gals with 10 lbs malt.
 
 > Do I still sparge with 5  gallons?  Less?  More?
 
 You sparge till the gravity gets below 1.010.  Depending on lots of variables 
 you should get 10 to 15 gals of wort from 15 lbs.  You can quit anytime you 
 want but you are just throwing away good beer.

Subject: Electronic weighing scale


On page C9 of the 5/19 Wall Street Journal there is an ad for an electronic
weighing scale.  It claims 1gm resolution (no mention of accuracy) and a
range > 5lb or 2kg.  THe price is $49.00, incl shipping.  Sounds like 
a good deal since nice, spring loaded scales (e.g. braun, etc) cost $20-
$30.  It has selectable Oz, Gm display and a taring function.


The place is:   Nam Tai Electonics Ltd.

Sorry this was a cc of a message to a local discussion group.


BBC is Boston Beer Co. makers of Sam Adams products.
BBW is Boston Beer Works, a respectable new brewpub that just opened 
across the street from Fenway Park.


Seems the BBC waited until after the BBW had opened (i.e. purchased signage, 
did lots of interior decorating with the BBW name, printed stuff like
coasters, menus, napkins, etc....)  and then decided to sue them over the
name (they have trademarked Boston Beer Co and claim the BBW name is too
similar, and thus must enforce or lose their trademark).


Since everyone else around here knew for months before hand what the name of
the place was gonna be, we find it hard to believe that the Sam Adams folks 
could have missed it. Also since they market their stuff under the Sam Adams
name (and few buyers actualy know the real name of the company, i.e. BBC)
many are dubious of the claim that the BBW name intereferes or threatens the
BBCs product. Most of us feel like the Sam Adams people if they had a gripe
should have engaged in discussion up front and come to some reasonable solution.




Don't want to take up any more bandwidth, but if you want to call and gripe, 
the number is 617-522-3400 I think an address is on the side of the bottles,
there is none in the phone book and i don't know off hand (well it I think the
bottles say The Brewery, Germania St., Boston, Ma... zip=?????)

The A-B Asst. Brewmeister that came to our brewclub meeting told us
that the beechwood chips are used to provide more surface area for
the yeast.  He didn't mention anything about fining.  We are going on

Subject: Mega Batch (HELP) :*)




Howdy All,


        This is it, my brew buddy and I are ready to take the plunge into
some larger batches, we have aquired a nice 40-45 gal. stainless steel vat 
from a nearby dairy, even has a stirring wand in it !! We have a nice pump
to help do the sparge and as of this moment we have four 10 gal. milk cans
to be used for something ??  We also have a Creole Cook'r and a 100lb. 
propane tank. So I would really like some input from all of you on how 
much grain, hops and so forth we would need for a batch of this size.
        As of now we are still doing 5 gal. batches, so we use 1.33 qts.
of water per lb. of grain, if we use 10 lbs. of grain we mash with approx. 
11 qts. and use around 5 gals. of water to sparge with. So if we want to make
30 gals. of beer do we just use 6 times as much of everything ??
Say 60lbs. grain, 20 gals, of mash water and 15 gals. to sparge with ???
        So if there is anyone out there who has experience doing the mega 
batches, could you please help us out, maybe a recipe ???  Any ideas on
how to crush the grain ??  We've got some cleaning to do so we probably won't
try it for another couple of weeks or so. Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated !!  I can honestly say I've never REALLY worried about any of 
the 5 gal. batches before, but I am getting a tad worried about 30 gals. of
brew, I'm sure once I see and smell 30 gals. of black as night stout, I WILL
relax :*)
        Yes I can hear it now :


              Me:  How many pounds of Northern Brewer do you have ??


Homebrew Supply :  Do you mean pounds or ounces ??


              Me:  You heard me right, I mean pounds !!


Homebrew Supply :  Uh, okay, let me check !!


              Me:  Great, you don't happen to have a pallet of grain !!




   


                                  Keep on Brewin'  we're gettin there..

While on this topic, I thought I'd bring up my experience. First, I
bring up active 
cultures from single colonies (see my "too-scientific" yeast primer
from a few issues
ago). I have found that it is best to scale up gradually (ie. single
colony --> small 
culture--> large culture, etc.). The reason is purely from the
perspective of
avoiding contamination. If you inoculate a medium with 1% active cells,
it has
a greater chance of outcompeting anything in that other 99% than if you
inoculate
with only .001%. This is a well established fact that is exploited by
people who
run fermentations (including non-alcoholic ones). Also consider that
most home-
brewers do not sterilize, but only sanitize their wort through boiling.
Thus, you
will be doing your yeast a favor if you give them a numerical advantage
over other
organisms. The bottom line: SCALING UP PRESERVES CULTURE INTEGRITY.
Hope this clears things up. Cheers!

Subject: Yeast, Pumps, Propane and Festivals




Got about 8cents to put in:


        1)  Jeff Mizener was asking about siphoning:  I would think some
            sort of fluid pump for indoor fountains would do the trick
            I'm not sure what flow rate to use, obviously greater that
            natural flow but at higher rates one runs the risk of sucking
            out trub and/or sediment.  I just stick the tubes into the hose
            VERY tight fit, try finding hose with a smaller inner diameter.


        2)  I'ld second Brian Bliss's comments on yeast population.  
            Qualitatively,  I figure yeast grow exponentially limited
            by the amount of food and alcohol content.  When you pitch
            into starter then a day later into the wort you're introducing
            orders more yeast cells than pitching directly into the wort.
            What have the micro-bio's have to say?


        3)  The problem with cookers indoors (ie: basements) is that
            propane is heavier than air and if you have a leak or incomplete
            combustion, the propane will collect on the floor running the risk
            of explosion (static electric discharge is enough to trigger)
            hence the need to use them outdoors or with an industrial,
            NOT a kitchen ventilation hood.


Finally 4)  Since we've had postings on East and West Coast brew fests
            Fort Collins, Colorado is having its 3rd Annual Colorado
            Brewer's Festival Saturday June 27.  About 20 Colorado
            commercial brewers (over 20 if you count Coors and A.B.)
            will be pouring in the Old Town area, bands and food too.

Subject: Source for maple syrup


          I've been reading with interest the submissions on brewing
          with maple syrup.  Being a former Vermonter, I've come
          to learn that maple syrup is overpriced in most locations,
          and you don't *have* to brew with the grade A light amber
          that is usually offered in the shiny little tins.  Our local
          food cooperative sells grade A dark amber for about $2.40
          per pound, which is comparable to buying quality malt
          extract or extremely good honey.  I have seen bulk maple
          syrup for sale by the pound for similar prices in many food
          cooperatives and natural food stores.  Check it out!


          Another option is to purchase Canadian maple syrup (from
          Quebec and Ontario).  It is typically less than $2.00 per
          pound and the quality is fine.

Just wanted to say that I enjoy the discussion here very much, and it
is a useful and happy education for me.  I recently was given a soft

Subject: Beechwood Fining


In 883, Michael Biondo asked about using Beechwood slats or chips as fining
agents as used by A-B and as Jackson says, it's "an old method still used by
some Bavarian Brewers to clarify beer."


My understanding (from Miller or Papazian, I can't recall) is that the wood
acts as an aid to flocculation.  The yeast clings to the wood and
flocculation is enhanced.  I also understand that metal slats are used in
some breweries because the wood is expensive (in time, materials) to
sanitize than metal.


I can't recall if ionization plays a major role here or not.  Likely, it
does, as us homebrewers use clarifiers like polyclar that are quite
effective as aids to flocculation and settling of yeast cells.
