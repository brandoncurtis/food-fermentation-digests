The famous smoke-beer brewery Schlenkerla in Bamberg,Germany does it !


Each batch is 5000 litre,they make two batches each week and each
fermenting vessel contains 10000 litre.

Subject: Several Yeast Questions


Up until now, I have been brewing with Red Star Ale Yeast (no rotten tomatoes,
please!), with relatively good success.  Now I want to move on to good yeast,
and maintaining pure cultures of that yeast.  My questions are:
        1)  Is there a significantly better dry finishing (high or low
            attenuating, I can never remember the nomenclature) ale yeast
            than Chico Ale (Wyeast 1056).  I have heard good things about it.
        2)  I plan to prepare about a year's worth of single use stock tube
            slants, so I don't have to worry about too much mutation.  How
            stable is Chico Ale genetically.  I have heard that some other
            strains are quite unstable.
        3)  (This one is unrelated to my own yeast concerns)  If the yeast
            used for trappist ale is a mixture of several species and/or 
            strains, how would one go about making a trappist from pure
            culture?  Stated differently, what sort of pitching ratios of
            the different strains should be used.


        Comments about my past use of Red Star should be made to me personally,
but I think help with my other CURRENT problems should be posted to the digest.


Thanks for your help!

I would guess that you could continue until you ran out of space or
patience.  Of course, you would want to stop the cycle eventually so
you could complete your brew!  All that work is bound to make you

Watch out!!!  Lots of nasties will be growing in this water!!!
De-humidifiers work by passing large quantities of the room's air over a
cooling coil, where condensation of excess moisture takes place.  Any wee
beasties suspended in the air can be trapped in the water droplets on the
coil and will drip into the collector along with them.  You say yourself
that the cellar gets "musty"; you're smelling moulds and mildews, or at
least their spores suspended in the air.


Sounds like an efficient way to infect your beer with everything there is
to infect it with in your house!

School's over and brew season is slowing down so I hope to get back to

Hugh Bynum mentioned tubing benders as a way to bend copper.  They do the
trick.  But you can also been copper fairly easily by bending it around
something that's already round, like a tree limb!  The key is to hold the
tubing firmly to the surface as you bend.  I use a nail that's bent over 
in a right angle so that the tail of the "L" is a little more than 3/8" 
above the surface of the limb.

Subject:  Chocolate in beer




Chocolate and Brown Ale being important staples in my life, I decided
to mix the two in a brew.  It came out OK:  it had a subtle chocolate
smell, but no real chocolate taste.


We used 8oz of unsweetened baker's chocolate in a slightly modified 5
gallon batch of Papazian's Elbro Nerkte Brown Ale.  We added it to
the boil at finishing time (with the finishing hops) along with
1/3c of dark brown sugar.


My only comment is that the "real" chocolate has fats in it which
(during fermentation) coagulate and make what look like enormous corn
flakes on the top of the wort.  I simply siphoned around them when
racking.


Another note:  it is habit for me to taste anything which come in
contact with the brew (that way you know which ingredients create
what tastes in the beer).  Well, I tasted one of these flakes (which
smelled like chocolate).  DON'T BOTHER!  They tasted awful!  Like fat
with a lot of hops.  VERY bitter.  VERY icky.

Hi Noel, the acidic nature of a mash will remove the oxydized layer
from the copper (kitchen hint: use ketchup to "clean" copper pans because
its acid will brighten them).  The amount of copper ions removed should
be consumed by the yeast without a problem[*].   Many folks use the
slotted copper pipe system for lautering, so I suspect a yeast problem
(assuming that all cleaning used beer-safe chemicals).


Bob Devine
[*] While some copper is okay, too much can be damaging.  Big commercial
breweries do use copper boil kettles but don't use copper pipes or
copper lager & holding tanks not only because of cost concerns but because
the first runnings through copper do have a much higher concentration so
that a more consistent "product" is obtained with stainless steel.

I made up a batch this spring.  I used 2 of the kits, 1 lbs dry
light malt extract, 1 oz hallertau, brought the wort volume up 
to 5 gallons for the boil, cooled with a wort chiller, aereated
and pitched whitbread ale yeast.


The yeast packet that came with the kit says "product of england",
so I figured that it was regular brewing yeast, and not really
appropriate to make a lambic (tell me if I'm wrong), but of couse,
whitbread ale isn't either.  So what I got is a cherry beer, but
not lambic.  Nevermind - It was delicious (and it's all gone).
Give it at least 2 months in the bottle to age and clarify.


A cheaper route, but not as foolproof, is just to add 5 lb or
so of cherries and a little acid blend to a normal pale ale.
For a more authentic flavor, I've been able to culture the dregs
from a bottle of Timmerman's peche (no luck with Lindemann's) but
haven't yet had the guts to risk an entire batch with uncertain yeast.


I got my kits from the Grape & Grain in Springfeild, IL.
(1-800-524-6469) for $17.95 each (ouch!).  Their prices are
usually a little more expensive than other stores (but not
too far out of line, like the local hobby shop), but the owner
is friendly, and fellow homebrewer, and gives good advice.

Subject: A use for spent grains


I've discovered a rather innovative use for my spent grains.  (Then again,
everytime I think I've discovered something new, I find out that someone
else in HBD- land has already tried it.)  To start your day off right, try
sprinkling a spoonful of dried grains over a bowl of cereal.  This adds
texture, flavor, nutrition, and general peace of mind.  Since I'm an
extract/specialty grain brewer, I don't generate more than about 1 lb per 5
gallon batch.  Over a long period of time, the amount of grains I produce
is pretty close to the amount I eat.  Except for that batch of Rainy Day
Porter, which generated too many grains for me to bother with. 


Trust me, your colon will thank you.

Howdy!


Does anyone out there live in the Kalamazoo, Michigan area, or have visited
there recently?


I used to live there (grew up there) and am wondering if anyone has recently
stopped by the Kalamazoo Brewery in downtown KZOO.  I used to frequent the
establishment quite often to partake in the fabulous brews.  They had a great
amber ale, porter, and lager (I think) which were usually readily available.
I even managed to get my hands on a case of Cherry Stout one christmas (it was
a limited edition type deal) which was very good.  At the time I wasn't 
homebrewing myself, but now that I'm over my head in homebrew I'd like to try
to reproduce that porter.  I can't get any in Albany, NY.


If anyone lives there, visted there, or knows the brew of which I'm speaking
please let me know.  I don't know if they hand out recipes, but I'd like to
get an idea of some possible ingredients so I can come close to it.  If you
know of it, or live there and can ask around, I'd appreciate any response.


Thanks -

Bill asks about the Brewferm Kriek kit and making Kriek from scratch.


I've tried the Brewferm Kriek kit and offered it up for review at
BOSS (Brewers of South Suburbia (Chicago's)), CBS (Chicago Beer
Society) and Headhunters (Sugar Grove -- near Aurora, IL) club meetings
and the concensus is that it is not a Kriek by any stretch of the
imagination.  I used two cans of the Brewferm Kriek in a 5 gallon batch
and used Wyeast #1028 in stead of the kit yeast.  Barely any cherry flavor.
Not a bad beer, but not nearly enough cherry flavor.  It had a sourness,
but that was probably from the citric acid which is listed on the label.


On to bigger an better things: homebrewed pseudo-Lambics (I offer that
we should respect the natural process of making Lambics and therefore
respect the appellations "Lambic," "Kriek," "Framboise," etc.).  I have
a 15 gallon batch of pseudo-Lambic fermenting in my basement.  You can
get two of the most dominant beasties from G.W.Kent in Ann Arbor Michigan.
You'll have to go through your retailer.  My retailer charged me $8 each
for Brettanomyces Lambicus and Pediococcus Cerevisiae.  The third of the
three dominant beasties is Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (I used Wyeast #1056
- -- Chico Ale) which is your basic Ale yeast.  Pick up J-X Guinard's book,
"Lambic."  It has a lot of good info and the history (much of which is
still alive in Belgium) makes for interesting reading too.  The amounts
of cherries needed to make pseudo-Kriek are staggering.  Granted, the
Sharbeek cherries used by the most-traditional Belgian brewers have a
very high pit-to-pulp ratio, but if my memory serves me correctly, ene
brewer uses 300 lbs of cherries with 30 gallons of Lambic to make their
Kriek.  I plan to use 13.5 lbs of pitted cherries (I would have used
unpitted, but at the time when I bought them, the only unsweetened ones
I could find were pitted and frozen) with 3.5 gallons of my pseudo-Lambic.


You know where you can find me immediately after the Conference:  in Michigan
picking cherries -- I'll have to buy another freezer just for cherries (that
will make six fridges at my house!).

Yes, there are 3 strains (see the Zymurgy special Yeast issue mentioned
by Noel Damon or a posting to HBD by George Fix).  If you've cultivated
it, you likely only have one of the 3 strains (or even a wild yeast!).
I suggest it is not worth the bother to cultivate Whitbread because you
need to grow all 3 strains and then combine them in the right proportion
(which may not be 1:1:1...).


As an experiment, go ahead with a small batch based on your yeast culture.
If it takes off quickly, you have strain #1.  If it has a long lag time,
it's #2 or #3.

My coffee : beer intake ratio is about 7 : 1, so I think I have the
experience to strongly recommend that NOBODY EVER BOIL BREWED COFFEE.
The flavor of coffee is very delicate, and essentially any temperature
changes other than the conventional brew-N-cool (or ice) will
probably damage it. You don't even want to keep it hot for very long.
If you're going to the expense of using gourmet coffee, you should
probably just brew in like normal, near the end of the boil, and just
pour it in to the wort as it's cooling.


(I don't have any experience with the cold, acid-free (viz. acid-LESS)
method of coffee brewing yet. That might work even better, as it's
supposed to be much smoother, if you're adding coffee flavor to a beer
as harmonious as the Platonic Pumpernickel Porter.)


Good luck and have fun,
Jake.

Subject: Mint Beers?




        Hi,
                I'm thinking of making a batch of mint beer.
                Could anybody suggest amounts? When to add
                to the boil? Comments?


                I'm presently looking at basically a 2row
                mash with a little wheat&crystal malt add
                in. Not much in the way of bitterness. But
                how much mint???
                Thanks
                Nick

        In yesterdays post about the malt mill I omitted some information.


particle size refers to the grain diametre this averages approx .150 inch


any roll diametre will work as long as the tangent of the angle of nip is
less than the coefficient of friction between the roll surface and the
particle (grain). Also I have no desire to make any additional mills for
sale. Have fun....

As long as I'm here, a question about automating grain mills. I found one
at a flea market recently. Since I already have one, I thought I would
motorize the second one. I have a 1/2 hp motor and speed reducer. Has
anyone out there done this as Papazian describes?

In #1 I don't agree with the need for a Lager Malt - unless you are
using an English Pale Ale malt.  Any domestic 2-row Malt should be
active enough to convert reasonable amounts of unmalted adjunct.  I
have used GWM Pale Malt (Klages/Harrington mix) with as much as 20%
unmalted adjunct (i.e. 7lb of malt + 2lb of unmalted barley/oats)
and had no problem with conversion.  


With regard to #2, I thought the conventional advice was to use a small
amount of molasses rather than Brown sugar.  The sugar seems to contribute
an undesirable tast to beer (cidery/thin) - and besides, the brown, in
brown sugar is just molasses added to regular sugar.

The subject of Whitbred ales three strains has been discussed here several ti
times.  If I'm not mistaken, gfix has described the rather impressive in
interactions of these three strains, throughout the fermentation cycle.  My
apologies the Mr. Fix for my foggy memory, but I think that one strain is a
fairly quick starter, one dominates through the middle of the fermentation cycle
and the final strain finishes off the brew as the alcohol level forces the f
the first two strains into dormancy.

We also siphon our hot wort from upstairs to downstairs via a looong siphon
hose, and yes, those plastic siphon tubes ARE affected(read melted) by hot
wort. There is a store in Seattle called Brewers Warehouse who sells copper
siphon tube(~6 bucks). I dont know thei number, but they advertize in
Zymurgy.

As I understand, and I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm wrong :-),
Vermont has the largest number of micros/brewpubs per capita:


Population: circa 550,000
Micros/Brewpubs:
  Catamount
  Vermont Pub & Brewery
  Mountain Brewers (Long trail ale)
  Otter Creek
2 others in brattleboro I believe, but only counting the 4 above,
we get about 1 micro/brewpub per 150,000 residents.

Subject: Wort Chiller Lengths




In response to the query about wort chiller lengths, I decided
to work out an answer (my specialty is thermal hydraulics). It
is rather more complicated than one might think. In fact, my
entire response is about 200 lines long! I'm thinking about
submitting it to Zymurgy (does anyone have any experience with
submitting articles that they would like to share?). 


Anyway, since it is so long, and since I may submit it for 
publication, I have decided not to post it right now. I will 
probably post it eventually. If anyone would really like to 
see it now and will promise to me that they won't usurp my
rights to it, I will send it by email.
