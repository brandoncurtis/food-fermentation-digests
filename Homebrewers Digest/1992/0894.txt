I lived in Boulder for the summer a couple of years ago and I found supplies as
well as an incredible beer selection (international & micro) at the giant
Liquor Mart downtown. Boulder gets the best of both coasts.

Subject: beer warmer


  Some people use the "wet t-shirt and pan of water" method to keep their
carboy cool in the summer heat.  I have just the opposite problem; my
brewroom stays at 60 degF in the summer (in the winter it's heated). Wyeast 
1056 (Chico Ale) just doesn't seem to like it that cold; it was *very* slow 
to start, and not making any krausen at all.  Not wanting to move 6.5 gallons 
of beer to a warmer spot, I instead filled 6 gallon-jars with hot tap water, 
and surrounded the carboy with them.  This morning the little carboy closet 
is 68 degF, and there's a nice krausen.  I suppose it might also work the
opposite way with ice-water in the jars.

To convert from g/l to ppm multily by 1000.  For example:  0.100 g/l of CaCO3
would be equivalent to 100 ppm carbonate hardness.  Are you sure the numbers
are in g/l and not mg/l?  My water anaysis list the mineral content in the
latter ( mg/l ).  In this case the conversion is really simple ( you multiply
by 1 :-).

Ok. I can beat that:

Of course, we're talking about magnitudes of zero, but I still think I've

Aside:
  First of all, I'd like to point out that I'm not at all affiliated
  with Wyeast, other than being a satisfied customer.


  It appears that too many Wyeast users blame the yeast for infections
  rather than their sanitation techniques.  I've been using Wyeast for
  three years and have yet to have an infected batch since starting to
  use Wyeast (except for one made with Munton & Fison Dry Yeast).  The
  four years of dry yeast brewing prior to that, had many infected
  batches, but then again, I was less-skilled back then also.


I don't recall how long it took a recent Chimay-clone to ferment out
using Wyeast Belgian Ale yeast, but I think it may have been a bit longer
than most.  The problem with the banana aroma is because you are
fermenting at too high a temperature.  I forget who it was that posted
this phenomenon a few months ago (Martin maybe?) but I, foolishly, confirmed
it.  My ferment was at a consistent 65F and *that* was too warm.  The beer
turned out quite authentic except for the banana aroma.  "Darn!" I said
to myself, and plan to soon try it again at 57F.  The moral of the story
is:


        Ferment Wyeast Belgian Ale yeast well below 65F,
        unless you really like bananas.


Al.

I'd bet you get as much inaccuracy from a typical $5-10 hydrometer as from
the mathematical approximation; I would assume any report of specific
gravity to have a possible error of +/- .002 (effectively, ~5% for typical
changes in gravity), given the coarseness of the markings and the
difficulty of finding the meniscus precisely. But 5% is still likely to be
about as precise as a dieter can measure (absent a scale that is
inconveniently large to carry to meals).

mecca!?  Hey, that's in Franconia (Germany), with the cities of Bamberg
and Forchheim as the main axis!  Or maybe the Rheinland, with Duesseldorf
and Koeln as the axis ... ;-)


Well, I live in Seattle - Maritime Pacific is a bit over a mile and a half
from my house, and Red Hook is two and a half miles down the road.  Really,
Jackson's _Pocket Guide to Beer_ is a reasonably reliable guide, but for
maximum pubbing in a small area, check out the Fremont district, home of
the Red Door, the Dubliner, the Triangle Pub, and Red Hook's Trolleyman Pub.


The Red Door has the best selection, but is also filled to the rafters with
what we used to call yuppies.  The food is quite good, and the place is
impossible to get into or be heard in (I've nicknamed it the Loud Door) on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.  All local breweries are well-rep-
resented, and there are also a couple of imports on draught; Fullers ESB is
usually among them.  The Dubliner - formerly Poor Richard's - is right next
to the Red Door, not quite as upscale, but it serves as a sort of spillover
pub for those seeking a less-crowded room.  Live music has been a part of
this venue in the past.  Red Hook and Full Sail are available, among others.
The Triangle - so named for the shape of the room - is a recent remodel of
a dive, and the improvement is substantial.  Eight beers on tap, including
Full Sail, Red Hook ESB, Maritime Pacific Dark, Pyramid Wheaten, Widmer
Hefeweizen, and Guinness Stout.  And then there's the Trolleyman, the pub
located in the Red Hook Brewery complex, in a building that used to house
streetcars (when Seattle had 'em).  Strictly Red Hook products on tap, no-
smoking room, and quite popular at weekends.  In short, Fremont, starting
at North 34th Street and Fremont Avenue North, can be the site of a worth-
while pub crawl, with four pubs in walking distance of each other.


There are other pubs scattered around town, including my favourite brewpub,
the Big Time, located on University Way N.E.  Wonderful, full-flavoured
ales are brewed here.  Farther afield, there's the Maple Leaf Grill - pub
atmosphere, restaurant-quality food, and Thomas Kemper's Hefeweizen among
the dozen taps, the best hefeweizen made in the N.W. (IMHO).  Find this one
up on Roosevelt Ave. N.E. at 89th.  Also good is the 74th Street Ale House,
at Greenwood Ave. N. and N. 74th.  Or the Latona, at Latona Ave. N. and N.
65th Street, although I don't usually care for the music in the evenings.
And then there are two old standbys - Murphy's on 45th, in new, larger
premises, and Cooper's, on Lake City Way.  All of these pubs will satisfy
your desire for N.W. ales and ambiance.


This is a sampling of what's available - I've mentioned mostly neighbourhood
pubs, rather than more upscale places downtown.


E-mail me if you need more info, or if you need help finding one of the
pubs - or if you need help in emptying a pitcher :-).

Subject: g/l (re: mineral content of my water)


One of the things that I love about the metric system is how all of the units
are tied together.  An example of this is the relationship between mass,
volume, and length.  One liter is (or was originally) defined as the volume
of a cube ten centimeters per side.  A kilogram was defined as the mass of one
liter of water at four degrees celsius (the temperature at which water is at its
most dense at one atmosphere pressure).  Note that because of a change in the
definition of the length of a meter (from a fraction of the distance  from the
equator to the North Pole to the distance some number of waves travels, these
definitions are probably no longer exact, unless the defs of liter and gram
were altered, as well.  The above is probably close enough for our purposes,
however.


Given this, a number with units g/l roughly gives you how many parts per
thousand of a compound or ion there are.  Dividing this by 1000  gives you
parts per million or mg/l.

Subject: ppm conversion




In response to John Fitzgerald's <johnf`at`ccgate.SanDiegoCA.NCR.COM> question
on June 2:


          1 ppm (parts per million) is equal to 1 mg/l.  Therefore, 


          1 g/l = 1000 mg/l = 1000 ppm.  So just multiply g/l by 1000


          to get ppm.


Good luck,
Kurt

Are you sure it was in g/L and not mg/L? mg/L is equivalent to ppm.


Anyway, if it was in g/L that's equivalent to parts per thousand.
Multiply by 1000 to get parts per million: 


X g/L * 1000 mg/g = 1000X mg/L = 1000X ppm
