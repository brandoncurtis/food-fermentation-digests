        Hi all, 


        The other day I was able to help out on a friends first
        full mash.  I was suprised as to how easy it was!  
        The whole process took about 6 hours and aside from the
        fact that I don't own a 8 gallon brewpot I know I could
        do it now with no problems.  However...


        All I have is a 4 gallon brewpot.  So I'm thinking of moving
        up to a partial mash.  (I've been all extracts up till now)
        Papazian didn't go real deep into them and all the recipes were
        lagers.  Anyone care to send me some hints?  Recipes, how much
        grain, water, extract, etc.  Also all of Papazian's recipes
        called for a step mash compared to the straight 150 deg mash?
        He also mashed the crystal, specialty grains, too.  Why?


        Any help would be appreciated.
        
                                Cheers,  Cu

Brett Lindenbach wrote a great piece on the growth of yeast that deserves 
repeating:


John, the idea behind this is that you want to pitch when the yeast are
most active. Here's a quicky on  how yeast (and other microorganisms)
grow (usually):
(monospace)

            TIME
   = lag phase
   + log phase
   - stationary phase


High krausen will occur during mid- to late-log phase, evidenced by the
healthy head. During this period, the yeast is gorging on all that nice
sugar, and dividing rapidly. Consequently, it will be able to take over
the wort very quickly. Thus, the yeast will be happy, and risk of
infection minimized. Happy brewing!

I wanted to comment that this curve (when modified slightly) applies to
populations of people as well as yeast, though the time frame is expanded
significantly.  Thus:

It should be noted that yeast also have a decay phase, and the junk at the 
bottom of a well-aged bottle of home-brew more closely resembles 
Campden than the Big Apple.

I like my beer bitter and hoppy.  So far the bitterest, hoppiest
beer I have found is Geary's Pale Ale (brewed right here in Maine :).


Is there any commercial beer which can beat Geary's in these areas?

Northwesterners,

I plan to visit the following brew pubs: Big Time, Pacific Northwest Brewing
Co., Pike Place, the Trolleyman/Red Hook, and Cooper's Northwest Alehouse 
(for both the beer and the darts).  Are there any glaring omissions in my
itinerary, and can anyone recommend reasonably priced accomodations?  Please

Ho, hum.  Yeah. I have heard this more times than I can count.  I still don't
buy it.  I have been brewing for over 10 years and have always used plastic
fermenters.  I clean them with greenies (green scrubbing pads) as often as not
and I am sure they have scratches in them.  While I have no doubt some bacteria
could hide in them, I am under no impression that I have a sterile
environment.  Period.  Not only does sanitizing not kill everything, but when
you put your beer in the fermenter (and especially when you aerate it) you
will *undoubtably* get some bacteria in it.  Now, if I had an infected batch
I might think twice about reusing the bucket if it were scratched, because we
are now dealing with a known problem source.  But until then I see no reason
to believe that nasty bacteria will spontaneously grow in scratches in the
plastic.   If they come in, they will come in from the air (from which we have
no protection in any event).

Sean, I don't have any rules of thumb based on SG etc., but I will say 1 oz.
will overpower any brew I can think of.  Half that amount has proven to be on
the verge of "too much" for me in a few different brews (and I love hops!).
I'd start with about 1/3 oz. for full hop aroma.  Just MHO.

As a homebrewer who's located in Mountain View,CA, I'd like to share my
opinion.  Let me state first, I've never asked the water company for a report
on the water.  I *DO* know that I don't like the taste of the water that comes
out of the tap, so we get bottled water for drinking.  My partner and I use the
same bottled water for our beer.  The rationale -- if it doesn't taste good,
don't use it.  Works for us.  We get our bottled water at a local store(Pure
Water is the store name) for only $.25/gallon.  There's probably isn't any
safety hazard in using the tap water, we just choose not to!  Anyway there's my
two cents worth:-)!

1 gallon of propane = about 92,000 btu, I believe.  When my regulator for
the house froze up I temporarily substituted the one from a barbecue.  The
BBQ is 40,000 btu, and the regulator worked ok with the 60K drier, or the
range, but the flames started getting lower if I tried both.  From that I 
would guess that you won't be running full pressure with a barbecue regulator.
Of course, yours could be more overbuilt than the one I used.

Look on the bottom and see if there is a number inside a triangle.  #2
(the most common for small water & milk jugs) is high density
polyethylene, which was the first thing they started recycling around
here. #1 is PETE, the kind used in soda bottles.

Subject: soda kegs in HBD#898




In HBD#898 Dan Graham asked some questions about using soda kegs without 
pressure release valves.  [I would have responded to you directly Dan, but 
your email address is pretty ugly :) and I'm sure my mail program wouldn't be 
able to digest it.]


Two fellow homebrewers and I have been using soda kegs with and without the 
separate release valves that you are looking for. Don't worry, you don't have 
the wrong kinda of kegs!  The difference is in the lids, and lids with release 
valves are available (our homebrew shop sells them, but they are pricy, about 
$18-19 just for a new lid!).  We use both kinds of lids (acutally 3 kinds, one 
has what looks like a one-time pressure valve that would only open if the 
presure got too high, and then probably need replacing) interchangably, 
without much preference.  We always figured that the kegs are rated to 
withstand 130 psi, and our beer is not primed to come anywhere close to that.
If we are ever concerned about the internal pressure getting to high, the 
little valve in the top of the 2-pin stem always works to release a little CO2 
(unless the keg is very very full).  Note, it's the 3 pin stem that ususally 
goes to the feeder tube for the liquid, and thus results in the showers of 
brew/soda-syrup.


I hope this helps.


John Fitzgerald


BTW, the kegs also make great mini grain silos! We buy grain in bulk, and 
store it in a keg, pressurized with CO2.  So far it seems to keep pretty well.
