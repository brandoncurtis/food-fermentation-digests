Hi,
        Does anybody know of anyplace that sells agar at
        reasonable prices? A local place wants almost $100
        for one[1!] pound of Malt extract Agar. They also
        want $50 for a pound of DME.[This isn't a homebrew
        place put a chemical supply house]


        If this doesn't pan out has anybody in Canada
        ordered from the Brewers Resource? How long did it
        take to clear customs?
        Thanks
        Nick

Subject: sediment in wine


To any of you wine makers out there:


After learing how easy and fun it is to make beer, my wife said "now if you
could only make wine too...". This past summer I fermented 10 g of grape juice
following directions from friends, books, and tips from a "quick" wine kit.
Everything went smoothly.  I bottled the white wine in December so that I could
use my caraboys again for some beer.  The wine seemed clear, so I did not use
any finnings before botteling. Now I have sediment on the corks (bottles stored 
upside down) so when the wine is poured into glasses, the otherwise clear wine
is degraded (at least visually, maybe in taste).  The wine tastes great 
straight out of the bottle, but we want to serve it to friends and would like
to have it clear.


My question is what should I do with about 40 bottles of wine that all have
some sediment on the corks?  I tried filtering some thru coffee filters
which removed the particles, but the wine seemed to oxidize badly. Any ideas???


Thanks in advance!

Having just returned from the AHA National Conference, I'd like to comment
on a number of posts received while I was away.  By the way, I strongly
urge everyone to try to attend the next Conference which will be held in
Portland, OR, next summer.  Not only are there *barrels* of information
to be gained from the sessions (my favorites were the session on Yeast
by George Fix and the session on Brewing Lambics by Martin Lodahl and
Mike Sharp), but you also get to taste *hundreds* of homebrewed beers
while standing shoulder-to-shoulder with such brewing luminaries as Charlie
Papazian, George Fix, Dave Miller, Byron Burch, and Fred Eckhardt.


>From the matching faces with logins file:  everyone is much younger in
person than they seem on the net.  Given the amount of knowledge that
HBD members have, you would expect them to look like old, grey-haired
brewmasters.  Not so.  In addition, homebrewers are the friendliest
people in the world.  Period.  If you steped up to a homebrewer at the
conference who was pouring a vintage 1967 Thomas Hardy's Ale, and they
noticed your glass was empty, they would pour you some... nevermind that
they haven't even had a chance to read your nametag.

So far, you have excellent technique.

Yes.  I think this should be your first improvement.  Note that
when you increase your boil volume to the full 5 to 6 gallons,
you will get better hop utilization due to the lower boil gravity,
so be careful.  See the article by Jackie Rager (who I got to meet
and with whom I shared a Blueberry Porter provided by one of the New
York area homebrew clubs) in the Hops Special Issue of Zymurgy to
see what kind of change you can expect from your full boil.


>(ii) use a bottle of oxygen to aerate the wort before pitching,


I would call this overkill.  Good aeration is enough.  (Ironically,)
Alberta Rager will have an article in the Conference Transcripts
on aeration -- she suggests using a bubbler stone, an aquarium pump
and a 2micron inline filter for aeration, but I would leave this
improvement for later.


>(iii) use a 7 gallon carboy
>instead of a plastic fermenter for primary fermentation (where
>can one get a 7 gallon carboy?),


Even a 5 gallon carboy will help you keep things more sanitary than
plastic, but as noted by Darryl Richman recently, he's been using
an HDPE fermenter for years and has brewed prize-winning beers with it.


>(iv) use kegs of some sort
>rather than bottles (this would make life easier, I think, but
>shouldn't improve the beer) and




>(v) use a larger volume of starter, say one liter.


The difference between 750ml and 1 liter is minor.  Personally,
I think that 750ml is enough if you pitch when the starter is most
active.


Additional improvements:


        - try adding specialy grains, like Crystal, Chocolate, Black Patent
          (I simply crush them, put them in a grain bag, and suspend the
          bag in the water as I bring it to 170F, then remove the grains.)
          The grains will give your beer a more malty flavor and aroma
          than just simply using extract.


        - try some different malt extracts.  I've found that Northwestern
          Extract seems to give a high terminal gravity.  Other extracts
          give slightly different flavors too.


        - Dryhop.  Try 1 oz of Willamette or Goldings or Fuggles in the
          secondary (the last 10 days before bottling).  Try Liberty Ale
          of Young's Special London Ale to see what dryhopping can do for
          beer bouquet.

I think it may have to do with the low gravity of starters (I use 1018),
but high-krauesen is really, at best, 1/8 inch, sometimes none at all.
I know I wrote "high krauesen" in a hurry and I really hadn't thought-out
my post properly or explained myself thoroughly.  Usually, I just time
the bubbles and scale down from a 5 gallon batch -- 1 bubble per 80 seconds
in a 16 ounce starter is (for practical purposes) 1 bubble per 2 seconds
in a 5 gallon batch.  I consider anything aproaching 1 bubble per 2 minutes
to be "high krauesen" in a 16-32 ounce starter.

I feel that you have underhopped.  1/2 oz of 4.0% Fuggles is quite low
for a 5 gallon batch of 1060 Ale.  I would have used 1.5 ounces.


>So how much of the Hersbrucker (a = 2.6) do i throw in the secondary? Is

I suggest 1 ounce for the last 10 days in the secondary.  At first, the
dry hop bouquet may be overpowering (if that's possible, but I'm a hophead)
at first but will mellow out in a week or two.  Note: I heard at the
conference, that Smartcaps(tm) will make your hop bouquet last much longer.
If this is true, then you may want to try Smartcaps and use 1/2 ounce of
Hersbrucker.

Nils/John:


   Last year at the WBUR "Brewers Offering" my brew partner and I
   compared side by side the two beers we considered the hoppiest in
   the neighborhood.  My palate my have been a little impaired but we
   found Geary's Pale to be the second in bitterness to Post Road.  I
   would imagine that you can get it in Maine... it's brewed for
   the Marlborough Brewing Company by our friends in White River
   Junction.

Perhaps surprisingly, Grant actually reduced the hops in his beers just a
bit from the early days.  Bert Grant worked in the hops trade (I don't
recall just what he did) before he started brewing commercially.  The man
*really* likes hops.  I still remember the first time he brought his beer
to the Great American Beer Festival--the India Pale Ale (which is supposed
to be a hoppy style anyway) was overwhelming.  It *was* good, though.


I wonder if Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale was counted in that "hoppiest
beer in America" comparison.  (Maybe not, because it's seasonal.)  It's
certainly been one of the hoppiest beers I've had over the years.

It's hard to draw the line for "general distribution" though.  The growth
in the numbers of people who like substantial beer has been enough that
Anchor and Sierra Nevada are almost common...and they're quite a step up
from SA in hops content.

My friend went to the PB brewhouse here in San Diego, and saw several
boxes haning from the ceiling.  He asked what they were, and was
told they are take-home gallons of beer!  He brought me one (nice guy --
cost $16.00 !!  Anyway, I had never heard of this before and was wondering
if anyone else has seen this sort of thing.  It was quite good.  
Cardboard box with 1-gallon plastic container inside, came along with a
plastic tap that you replace the lid with.  


Cool packaging!

 Not sure what you are starting in what but.....
 
 After 24 hours, I get a ring of bubbles around a half inch of wort in a slant 
 tube.
 
 This gets poured into 50 ml wort and 24 hours later will foam when agitated.
 
 This gets poured into 200 ml wort which will foam up just like fermenting 
 beer within 24 hours.
 
 If I have the time and motivation, this I pitch into 500 ml wort and it
 foams away in 24 hours.
 
 I guess the bottom line is, it takes four days to do it right.
 ..............
 
 
 I would like to express my good will and warm feelings to all the great 
 people I met at the AHA conference in Milwaukee last week.  I even extend 
 that to the HBD celebrity who refused to shake my hand or taste the "World's 
 Greatest Beer".  After composing my flaming expose' of the twit I decided to 
 give it one more try and flatter myself in thinking that I must still be the 
 world's greatest salesman.   Finally, with great condecension, he tasted the 
 "World's Greatest Beer" and couldn't find anything wrong with it.

Subject: Gravity of Starter Cultures




Why is a relatively low gravity (1.020) recommended for
yeast starter cultures?


The last few batches my friend and I made were from higher
gravities (~1.040-50), first by accident and then on purpose.
The cultures seemed very happy, and the lag time after pitching
seemed shorter (very subjective observations).


Is there any problem with this, other than using more malt extract
than is absolutely necessary?
