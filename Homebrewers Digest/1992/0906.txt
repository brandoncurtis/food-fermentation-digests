I have heard that, but not experienced it.  My process starts
with throwing the fruit in the freezer at least several hours
before brewing, sometimes the night before.  People tell me that
this breaks down cell walls, making it easier for the essence to
get into your beer.  I then toss this in as soon as I turn off
the heat and let sit for 15 minutes.  So, it may be that by
starting frozen and adding to boiling-hot wort, the result is
really a steeping at 170F or somesuch and thus avoiding any
pectin haze--I don't know.

Yow!  Personal tastes will vary, but *please*, IMNSHO, use Kent

Let me add my own perspective here.  When I go to a meeting of my
local homebrewers club and taste a homebrew, my remarks will be
tailored to the skill and experience of the brewer.  If it is
someone more skilled or at least more experienced than I, I might
say "Hmmm, how did you get it so hoppy?  Ten pounds of high alpha
acid hops?" and go on from there.  If I am talking to someone who
has only had Budmillob, maybe Guiness, and is now brewing a pale
ale or bitter, I will very often suggest that they taste several
other beers (commercial or fellow homebrew examples) and see if
there is something there they would prefer.  Then I can make
suggestions on possible changes to recipes or processes, if they
desire.


In Jack's case, I would have also recommended he try other beers
that I thought were good, because he has only recently been
exposed to good homebrew.


Finally, whenever the issue of "stylistic quibbles" comes up, you
can expect that ten people will have at least a dozen opinions on
it.  As a general rule, balance is a good thing, though it can
certainly be overdone.  Luckily, the local homebrew club has
plenty of people who know nothing of balance and brew that way,
just to keep the rest of us in line.

Subject: Spruce Beer Questions


     I have made many beers using spruce extract and I like them a
lot, but I've got some questions about technique.


     The first spruce-flavored beer I made was Papazian's Goat
Scrotum Ale, simply as a lark.  I added the spruce essence (1 oz)
at the beginning of the boil, as directed, and the kitchen was
filled with this marvelous aroma that I'd never have connected with
a tree.


     The beer was great.  The spruce was surprisingly subtle, and
I strongly recommend it for those who like richly flavored beers. 
I've made a batch every year or so since then.


     This year I had a brainstorm.  Hey, I said, I love the smell
during the boil, but am I boiling off all those great aromatics? 
What if I added the essence at the end instead of the beginning?


     So it goes.  I added the essence with the finishing hops
(shedding a manly tear for the lost smells) and proceeded as usual,
although I did a little dry-hopping this batch.  Looked good so
far.  When I sampled the ale a week later I realized that I had
been right - the batch was more aromatic.


     Much more.  I still like it, but I'm afraid that it'll be too
strong for my guests.  This is a major disappointment, since this
style was always one of my 'show-off' beers for new homebrew
drinkers.  I hope things mellow with age.


     My question is about timing.  When should I add the essence
and how much should I use?  Are there two options (add lots early
or a little at the end)?  Anyone played around with this?

In HBD #905 Eric Pepke gives a good overview of English Bitter. I would
like to add two things:


1) Eric Says:
> One more thing: do not use Cascade hops under any circumstances.  Use
Northern > Brewer or something like that.


   Also try Fuggles for bittering and Kent Goldings for Finish. Both
are            excellent.


2) He also says: 
>The only American beer I have ever tasted which comes anywhere near to

I cannot agree more! Since my only trip to England (darn!) I have been
on an unending quest for English style ales especially Bitters. This
quest alone started me homebrewing. Only a week after my trip to the
U.K. I had a chance to go to the Commonwelth Brewery in Boston and
tried their bitter. It is very good and the best at emulating real
English bitter that I have found in the U.S.  TRY THIS BEER!


No, I'm not even lucky enough to work for them! I just like the beer.

Cherries, on the other hand, do not totally ferment away.
I brewed up a 6 gal batch of Cherry Bock with 10 lbs of Dark X
and 6 lbs cherries, and you can definitely taste the cherries
through all the malt.  It's been aging for just over a year now.
The beer forms a nice pink head, and if you look close, you can
watch the red "bleed" away in little rivulets.

You add it to the hot wort at the end of the boil to sanitize the
fruit as much as possible without turning into jello by boiling it.
If you add it after the wort cools, add a few campden tablets to
the cherry slurry, let sit a few hours, and then mix with the
wort, or if you haven't pitched the yeast yet, add the tablets to
the entire mixture, let sit, and pitch.

The latest isssue of Zymurgy has an entire article about this subject.  I
found the suggestions quite surprising compared to fruit beers I have tasted
in the past.  Some real interesting ideas.  


He suggests something like .5 to 2 pounds of cherries per gallon.  Use as light
of malt as possible, and hop as little as possible.  If I remember right he 
suggests cutting the hops down to 1/3 of what you would normally use.  He
makes some comments about Papazian's method of adding fruit at the end of the
boil and also talks about adding the fruit after the wort has cooled and 
aging the beer with fruit.  


Since all kinds of fruit are now available, I was thinking about trying 
several of his methods to see which I would like better.  I was quite 
surprised to read that aging with fruit would probably result in a surface
infection which is unsightly in the bottle.  He says that if you use a keg, 
you draw from the bottom first and can't see the mold so it doesn't matter (!).
He claims you can't taste the mold that forms.  This seems to go against just
about everything I have learned about brewing to date and has me really 
curious.

Beers of all styles should have a balance between sweetness and bitterness,
malt flavor and hop flavor, malt nose and hop nose.  This balance is
different for each style of beer.  For example, in the Munich Dunkel style,
malt dominates and in the India Pale Ale style, hop bitterness dominates.
Don't blame the AHA for the figures listed, they are a complilation of
data collected from analysis of typical beers of the style.  Note that
both the gravity and IBU values in each case are a range, to account for
differences among breweries and regions.

Actually, historically, breweries in hop growing regions have a tendency to
brew hoppier beers.  This is not surprising.  It's not fair to say that
the hop rates in the Pacific Northwest are the correct ones and that the
hop rates in the Midwest are too low.  There are regional differences in
beers throughout the world.  Consider Brown Ales in Nothern Great Britain
and in Southern Great Britain.

appreciate (and support) the regional differences in beers.

Subject: Reading SG from wort after it's in the Carboy?




A while back I started having problems with contaminated batches, so
I switched from dry to liquid yeast and also recently switched
from a plastic primary fermenter to a glass carboy... The difference
has been phenomenal! I've brewed four straight batches with this
setup that have all had superb results!


But there is one problem with this setup over the plastic setup: How
do I take SG readings? 


I've tried using the blow off to read my OG but I'm convinced the
stuff that's blown off is not representative of the whole batch.
(i.e. I've gotten results that must be incorrect: Stuff like <1.030
for a 5 gallon batch with 8lbs of amber extract, 3lbs of specialty
grains, etc. and a very large variance (somtimes down, sometimes up
(!)) over short periods of time in SG readings.)


And for FG, the blow off has stopped so I don't even have that to
work with. 


I can measure FG at bottling time but by that time I've already
siphoned it out of the carboy so if it has not actually reached its
FG I have to bottle anyway. This happened to me recently on an
otherwise great Bitter, the result was a very over-carbonated beer
since it had to finish fermenting in the bottle (fortunately none
blew up)! If the beer isn't ice-cold it will gush and even if poured
carefully it has mega-head which takes a while to dissipate to a
drinkable level.


So, does anyone have any sure fire methods for measuring SG when
brewing malt extract recipes with glass? I want to minimize the risk
of ruining a batch since that's why went to the trouble of
switching, but I still want to know when I can bottle and how
much alcohol my beers contain (seeing as how this is *invariably*
the first question a non-brewer asks when sampling one of my beers.
sigh).

A friend and I tried strawberry beer loosely based on Papazian's
recommendations. We added 10 lbs of crushed frozen berries after the boil
for the primary fermentation. Then we added 5 lbs of crushed frozen berries
to the secondary. I don't know how much the second addition affected
things, but we have received a number of good comments on the finished

Folks,


Please ignore the other post, I sent an old file by mistake ...
this is what I really meant to say ...




Folks,


I recently received a catalouge from American Brewmaster.  They
advertise a brand of DME called "American CLassic (insert Trade
Mark thingy here)".  They also make a few claims that I'd like to
run by all youse on the Digest for comment ...


It goes like this ...


 ...Our stuff is excellent, blah blah blah ... "and the worts are
concentrated using the most technologically advanced, high vacuum
distillation process, assuring you" blah, blah, blah ...


"... Higher quality control during the malt extraction produces a
cleaner malt.  You will therefore notice a reduced trub level in
your primary fermentor and as much as a 50% reduction in sediment
in the bottle with single stage fermentation.  Trub is a major
source of off-flavors in beer through the production of esters
and fusel alcohols."


There was a recent thread about Trub producing off-flavors, but I
seem to recall that it ended in a hung-Digest?


Has anybody got any theories as to what effects (and why) this
high-vac distillation will have on the body and clarity of the
finished beer?  Anybody tried this stuff? It's not just American
Eagle under a different name, is it?


Send to me and I'll summarize,

Subject: Al Marshall, Hops and Balance


Al Marshall launched a typical Portland-area tirade, based on his
impressions of George Fix's comments on Jack Schmidling's World's
Greatest Beer.  Having not only tasted WGB, but being a Portland-area
hopfreak _and_ a BJCP judge gives me a little room to move here, I
think.


Al, you _know_ how much I love hops and you also know I agree with you
about the attitude toward hoppiness outside the Great NW.  But... George
didn't not say the beer was too hoppy, he said it was out of balance and
needed more maltiness to weigh up against the bitterness.  I tasted that
beer and I think George understated the problem; Bob Jones was a bit
crueler but more on the mark.


More to the point, I think you are wrong in general: I think bitterness
is great but when it exists in a
(sorry, Jack) thin and otherwise flavorless beer, you don't get good
beer. It's not a question of being out of style; it's just a question of
whether it tasted good or not.  Jack's beer wasn't contaminated (which
is good, but I would expect that of any brewer who had made more than a
couple of batches) but it also wasn't tasty.  As far as I'm concerned, a
beer that has only one flavor element--bitterness--is missing the boat.
I think it could have been improved considerably--not necessarily by
adding a lot of malt--but simply by bringing in some other flavor
elements.  With all that bitterness, a profundity of hop _flavor_ would
have made for a better beer.


It is true, folks, that the Midwest suffers from a sort of lupuphobia;
by the last night I was stumbling around, sobbing pitifully for some
hops.  Some creep snatched the last bottle of Liberty Ale from before my
eyes at the Banquet, risking death and dismemberment.  Good thing I'm a
nice guy.

In response to the query about Wyeast cultures and high-gravity beer, I'd

happened to me when I brewed my batch of Elbo Nerkte (allegedly) Brown Ale.


I'd suggest doing it this way: put the wort into your bucket and place the
top on but don't seal it up.  That's right, just lay the sucker on there, 
and put a piece of tape over the fermentation-lock hole just to keep 
gunk from getting in.  If it makes you feel better, you can put a VERY
LIGHT weight on top to keep the cat from getting in.  This will allow you
plenty of ventilation for the CO2 to escape, and the likelihood that other
stuff will get in is quite small, particularly considering that the CO2 will
create a modest positive pressure in the bucket--thereby keeping various
biological bugs on the outside.


Once the kreusen has fallen (or close to it), rack the beer into a carboy.
By this time the most ferocious activity will be over, and you won't be
losing your wort on the floor.  You'll also leave behind a fair bit of
scum and have yourself a cleaner beer.  By the way, there's no reason you
can't peek into the bucket from time to time to see how the kreusen is coming
along. Some people will even use a sanitized spoon or skimmer to take the
foam off (it carries dead yeast, oils, and other stuff, I"m told).  And
of course, relax and don't worry.  Especially about having to mop the floor.
