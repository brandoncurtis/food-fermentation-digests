I use an Electrim bin with a sparge bag. This means you have to use rather 
more water, about 3 gallons, but you don't get problems with grain sitting 
on the element and hot spots are easy to stir in. I stir it about every 30 
mins. Every 10 mins is likely to do more harm than good - you're going to 
cool it excessively.


I have had no problems with getting the temp to stay completely steady but 
it is a bit cooler at the top. I get 155 near the element, 150 at the top. 
I've found it's best to leave the stat set between the two 'M's of the word 
"SIMMER" above the knob. If it needs boosting turn it up to 6 for five 
minutes, set back, stir and check the temperature. If it needs cooling, 
splosh in half a cupful of cold water, stir and check. But don't get too fussy, 
you are more likely to make matters worse. There is a lot of thermal inertia 
in 9 lbs grain plus 2.5-3 gallons of water and you are likely to keep over 
correcting. Give it 20 minutes to settle between trying to make adjustments.
When it's about right, leave it.


Temperature is important but it won't ruin the beer if you are a few degrees 
out, it just means you have to give it a bit longer. It is supposed to affect 
the taste slightly - warmer mashes leave more dextrins so sweeter beers, but 
I'll bet there aren't many who can honestly say they can tell.

> Should my sparge water be boiling when I start, TCJOHB says
> 170, does it matter? 


Hot (170-180) but don't bother boiling. It's not crucial but malt sugars 
dissolve better if the water is really hot. Boil up a few kettlefuls as you
are sparging to keep it hot.


> I'm not worrying, 


Definitely the right attitude! I'm sure you'll get the best beer you've 
ever made.

Howdy folks!


   I would like to convert an upright freezer into a cool place for my
   brew for ferment and age.  I have looked for "conversion" kits in
   this area, and have found only one available.  Unfortunately, it
   costs $75.  Does anyone out there in netland have a cheap (less than
   $40) solution to my problem?  If so, I'd love to hear from ya!

Subject: Lagering and priming


Hi,


I've been lagering two batches o' beer for about two months in
Cornelius kegs at 32 degrees f. Its about time to bottle them (I dont
have the equipment to keg 'em) and I need to kow about priming.


I made a culture from 2206 Bavarian Lager yeast.  If I warm up the two
batehs to 60 degrees before bottling, will there be enough active
yeast so that i can just do the 3/4 cup of corn sugar thing?  I'd
rather not do another culture if I dont have to--but I will if
necessary.  Any thoughts?

Ok, so what is all that white gloppy stuff that forms when the wort
begins to boil?  Did someone say that it's protein?  And should I work
to remove it (skim it off?).  Inquiring minds want to know!

The hefe part just means that there is yeast in the bottle, most likely you are
already making it this way, unless you're filtering the brew.  I usually buy
these types of (import) beers because I feel that it travels better if it has
some yeast in it.

Since my blowoff tube never contacts the wort/beer (at least not the brew I
drink), I just soak it in a real strong Tide tm detergent (no scent) and hot
water and it comes right off, then I rinse it really well, then I clorox it.
I used to use count-off, alconox, and micro brand cleaners but Tide works just
as well and its cheaper too.

I've noticed that one-infusion mashes seem to take longer than
using a protein rest, also.  I beleive the difference is just
the time it takes for the grain to get thouroughly soaked in
the mash water, which can be a good 10-20 minutes.  With such
mashes, I've also had much better luck enough adding hot water
to bring the temp to 140-145, and then slowly raising it to the
desired temp, rather than immediately raising the temp with
water to the lower 150's.  anyway, the iodine test should tell.

5.5 * 36 / 9 = 22 pts/lb


which is the lower end of the acceptable range for me.  The only
time I usually get more than 25 pts/lb is when I use wheat malt
and get into 3 hr. sparges.


As for the rest of my technique, in summary, Corona grain mill,
Zapap lauter tun with sparge bag, grind the grain the day before,
I try to check ph, but I usually make dark beers and they stain the
ph paper enough that it's practially useless, mash for 2 hrs, and my
final extraction rates are based upon how much I got after I siphon
the beer off the .25 - .75 gal of hot break.


Which brings up another question, why do my hydrometer readings
go up after I let the hot break settle out?  The stuff is heavier
than the wort (it sinks)... what gives?

"hefe" means yeast, and hefeweizen contains a significant amount of yeast
in solution, whereas a krystallweizen does not, usually due to filtering.
Most homebrews are considered a hefeweizen (unless the brewmaster has a
filtering system).  Most commercial hefeweizen have had (the brewing yeast
possibly filtered out and) a non-flocculating strains added prior to bottling,
which is especially neccessary if the beer is pasteurized.   Has anyone
tried this, and what did you use for the non-flocculating yeast?  Wyeast
3056 seems to flocculate more than I want; I would prefer more yeast in
my hefeweizen.  (I guess I could just stir up the dead yeast on the bottom
of the fermenter prior to bottling, and pour out all the sediment at
serving time...)

Bob,


Run a long string or rope through the tube (use a weight or stream of
water to help if necessary), tie a piece of cloth into the middle of
the rope, (make sure that the cloth is big enough to make a tight fit
in the tube), stand on one end of the rope, hold the other end up high
in your hand and with the other hand move the tube up and down thus
scrubbing the inside of the tube. You could use a bottle or carboy
brush for this instead of the cloth. Cheaper than those brushes is
taking apart a _new_ toilet brush, straighten the bristle-wire out and
pull that through the tube.


Works on mine.

With 9 lbs of pale ale malt, I get a SG of 1.055.
All my water is preboiled to remove chlorine.
When I add the grains to 170 deg water, the temp drops to 153 deg.
The pH is too low (4.7).  I was adding CaCO3, but it had very
little effect on pH and my mash wasnt completely converting.
I then started adding 1 tsp gypsum to my mash and the effects
were very noticable. I mash for 2 hours and even though the
pH is too low, it converts completely.


As for grain bags, I dont use one. I keep my water level at
least 2" above the grain bed.  I dont see how a grain bag
will help me.  I take a full hour to sparge.  Sparge water
treated with lactic acid to pH 5.7. I have even had a SG of 1.057
with 9 lbs of grain.

Hi All,
   I thought I'd report on my pepper beer experiment that I queried
you all about.  Most recommendations leaned towards adding the pepper
as late as possible in the process.  Here's what I did.


Recipe (for 4 gallons)
    6 lbs light liquid extract
    1.0 oz Hallertauer hops  (~ 4.8 AAU) boiling 50 minutes
    1.0 oz hallertauer hops              steep   15 minutes
    Wyeast Pilsen yeast (I don't have my notes with me can't remember
number)     Serrano chile added at bottling


    Ferment at 50 degrees for 1 week. Then ferment at 45 degrees for 3
    weeks.  At bottling cut up serrano and add slices to each bottle.


What I did was cut up one chile and set aside 6 bottles for dry
peppering. The rest of the batch was just bottled as is. I labeled my
6 bottles 1 to 6 and put a little more pepper in each beer.


Taste results: The non peppered beer is way malty but it has mellowed
nicely after 3 weeks at 40 degrees. Dare I say it is not balanced.
The peppered bottles are good.  The ones with the least pepper (one
thin slice 1/8 inch) don't have any pronounced heat but have an
incredibly dry and abrupt finish. You wouldn't know it was pepper that
added the strangeness.  The ones that were more highly peppered (two
1/8 inch slices) begin to feel the heat.  This seems to be the right
amount to use to get the flavor and slight feel of the pepper with
burning a hole in ye gut. The flavor only comes through in the finish
and you can tell it's pepper. The last two bottles are waiting for our
next homebrew meeting.  Hopefully it'll have the good slowburn.  By
the way, the peppers did not seem to have any effect on the physical
characteristics of the beer (head or color).


When I do this again I will go for the 1/4 inch slices in some sort of
ale. In fact the IPA in primary could turn into India Peppered Ale.
Also on the agenda for the future would be attempting a pepper tea at
bottling. The problem with this is the extrapolation of the number of
peppers to use and the pepper extraction rate when made into a tea.


Overall I really like this beer and I think that it could be a good
subcategory for just about any beer style.


Now how can I figure the pepper extraction rate in IPUs (International
Peppering Units) ?

Subject: Low yields


In HBD  #913, Larry Barello writes
> Regardless of the dextrine maltose balance, the OG should be pretty
> consistent.  
In reply to Kinney Baughman's claim that a high mash tempreature in the
mash might be responsible for a low yield.  If my understanding of the
workings of the enzymes is correct, then Larry is right.  If Kinney
is right, sould some kind soul please e-mail me (or the HBD) to explain
why a higher proportion of dextrins lowers the SG?  I have often
mashed at temperatures higher that 150 for the purpose of getting
higher fianl gravity and have never noticed a statistically significant
ddecrease in yield.


Desmond Mottram elaborates on the issue of mash time (also first brought
up by Kinney).  Again, if this is a factor, I have to go back to drawing-
board.  It seems to me that once the starches have been glutenized
and dissolved, the OG is essentially determined.  What proportion of
the dissolved material is fermentable sugar, unfermantable sugar and
unconverted starch is abviously a matter of great concern, but is
in no way reflected in the density of the solution.


IF THIS IS WRONG, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!


I have always believed that lower-than-expected yields come from grinding
too coarsely, from sparging with too little water or from using
different ingredients (e.g. US malt for a British recipe) than called
for in the paradigm.

While I don't disagrre that if your info is accurate Young's hooping rates
are quite low, you should still realize that there is an inverse and quite
counter-intuitive relationship between hopping rates and batch size.


Because the wort quickly saturates with bittering acids in small batches
(of which you could consider 5 gallons) it becomes necessary to add quite 
a bit more hops to acheive the desired bitterness thanbn in larger batches.
This non-linear effect can be shown by doubling your batch size and exactly
doubling your recipe. I think you will find that the bitterness of the beer
actually undergoes a substantial increase, and that to preserve the reciupe
you'll have to cut back on the hops.


This being a non-linear effect I don't know a formula off hand. Perhaps George 
doesa and can provide us one on his return. I first became aware of this
phenomena when attending a talk by Finn Knudsen of Coors who spoke at the AHA
National Conference several years ago on scaling up recipes from 5 gallon 
test batches to a pilot brewery, to full production. The effect is deemed 
brewing to scale, and I expect many a homebrewer turned proi has encountered
this.




All that said, the hopping rates quoted for Young's still seem truly low.

Subject: Mash and Hops




First I'd like to thank everyone out there for all the advice on the net,
I didn't ask the questions but read the answers all the same.
Thought I will tell y'all about my setup, I recently started doing all grain,
and we have 2 setups:
1)        Mash in the oven in a stainless pot
        sparge in 2 plastic bucket with holes in bottom of the inner bucket and
        spigot on outer bucket.


2)        Mash in a 48 qt cooler with slotted copper pipes(15 ft) and faucet
        fitted to it. (The leftover copper tubing (~30ft) became a 2 layer
         wort chiller and it works fast too. )
        sparge in same.


I don't know if we were too impetuous and checked too often, but setup2
can't seem to keep a constant temp and we ended to having to reheat the
grain a lot and ended up putting all the stuff in the oven.
But either way it came out good, the mashing process took about
6 hours the first time (cooler) because of all the hassles and 4 hours
the second time because it kept tasting sweeter everytime we checked on it.


IMpale ale was made with setup2 and was dry hopped with Saaz pellets(cos
I like the smell, but can't buy it freash)
The beer that came out was a lot clearer and smoother than extract
brewing. I will highly recommend all-grain brewing, we had a BBQ outside while
the enzymes were working, so that wait was no problem.
IMpale ale was very tasty, but the hop flavour seemed to have become stronger
as it developed in the bottle. It's like drinking malty flower juice.


Anyway I have a question about hops, I am growing cascades, williamette,
nugget and Mt Hood in the backyard, the cascade is the only one with what
ressembles flowers, but they are small bases with white spikes sticking out
and not leafy like the stuff you buy. I am worried that I may have been
sold a male plant instead of a female plant (if there is such a thing for Hops)
Does anyone out there know?

Such an inpouring of (conflicting) information!  How will I ever

Lots of folks noted that the Golden Gate brewpub is gone.  Several
strongly recommended that I take the extra hours (2 each way!) to
drive up to Hopland and visit the Mendocino Brewing Co.  Seems
impractable for this trip, unless I can reschedule my flight several
hours earlier.  Comments the pubs actually in Berkeley included:


Triple Rock:
        You'll definitely want to visit [it].
        First Berkeley Brewpub.
        For sure!
        Popular close-to-campus hangout, but beware: they make lousy beer.
        Good, but staid... (same 3 house brews, no rotation)
        Great place to hoist a few, especially in summer, when it's
                not packed to the rafters with [students].
        Great beer and a great ambience.


Bison Brewing:
        Likes to experiment with herbs and flavorings ... espresso
                stout last year... Postmodern building
        Popular close-to-campus hangout, but beware: they make lousy beer.
        Good, but artsy and experimental ...(sage pale ale)
        Still exists, but I have never figured out why.  ... sour and
                unpleasant, though others like it.
        I dunno what kind of people you like to hang out with, ...
                maybe I should dye my hair black and look bored to fit in.
        The beer was baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad ... underhopped, sweet
                and boring.


Thanks to all.  Now I have to decide whether to try take extra time to
go up to Mendocino Brewing Co, or maybe try to visit Anchor (will they
take just one on a tour?)

Hi All,


I'm looking for North East based CAMRA type of organization.


Is anyone aware of a political organization primarily dedicated to
the promotion of beer?


This could either be an extension of CAMRA or another organization,
independent of any beer company.


I've recently become aware of The Beer Drinkers of America but I
know very little about them.  I have a gut feeling that this may be
just an organization which is sponsored by BudMilLob but set up to
appear as a grass roots organization.  Does anybody know anything
about them?


I ask all of these questions because there seems to a fair number
of people at least in the Boston area who are interested in the
politics of beer.  I would like to find a way to get all of these
people united into some form of organization.


So rather than trying to start up one on my own I thought it might
be better to merge in with an existing organization, like CAMRA.


Does CAMRA have a North East affiliation?


Can somebody please enlighten me, or point me in the right
direction?


Direct email responses would be preferred.

I'm giving him information on joining the digest, so expect a new
Baltimore area subscriber soon.


As to his problem, my feeling is that he is probably okay. I'm not sure,
but I think the beer he is talking about is a porter. It would be
intriguing to see what this brew tasted like after a five year primary,
if it were safe.


On the one hand,
    - alcohol acts as a preservative;
    - wines are commonly aged for years or decades;
    - Thomas Hardy ale is often aged for years, in the bottle; and
    - I've talked with other subscribers who regularly age their stouts
    for 18 months or more.


On the other hand,
    - this is in the carboy, not the bottle, and
    - it has been sitting in Larry's basement, but almost certainly has
        been subjected to fluctuating temperatures during that period.
    - it has had lots of opportunity to get infected.
    - my father's golden rule of spoiled seafood survival is "When in doubt,
        throw it out".


So what would you recommend? Is it possible that other, nastier alcohols
have been produced during this time? Or should he bottle and drink it
with careless abandon if it shows no obvious signs of infection?
                    Thanks!

Subject: Ladybugs


     Ladybugs are ruthless when it comes to consuming aphids.  Ladybugs
also prey upon a host of other pest insects as well.  There are quite a
number of mail order businesses that deal in ladybugs.  They are sold
(usually) by the 1/2 pint, pint and quart.  1/2 pints are around $11 and
full pints around $15.  Some businesses go the extra mile and ship the
bugs with a piece of dry ice to slow the bugs metabolism and to help
prevent mortalities.  These businesses advertise in the back pages of
most gardening magazines.  Check your library's magazine rack if you
like.  If anyone has trouble finding sources for ladybugs, send me
private email and I will dig up some catalogs for the info.


     The only complaint about ladybugs is that most if not all eventually
fly away.  It has to do with mating and such.  Your money literally flies
away.  Its kinda neat to watch.  If there is food present for the
ladybug, alot will hang around until the food (aphids, weevils, red
spiders and the like) source is depleted.


     A way to trick the ladybug into not immediately flying away is to
give the insect a splash of 7-UP just prior to placing the bug on the
plant.  The water in the soda wets their wings, thus grounding the insect
until the wings dry out.  The mentality is ". . . can't fly so I might as
well eat someting. . .".  The reason for 7-UP and not water is because
after the water evaporates, the sticky sugar thats left behind will
further make the ladybugs wings inoperative.  The sugar eventually will
disappear and the ladybug will regain flight but hopefully by that time
your aphids are history.  This method of using 7-UP is not harmful to the
ladybug.  I seem to remember that California has organic farming laws or
regulations or someting like that which also specifies this method.
