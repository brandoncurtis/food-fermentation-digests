Subject: IPA recipe


I just brewed my fourth batch of IPA based upon a recipe that Darryl
Richman gave me.  Since it is such a fine beer I thought I would share
my latest effort with the HBD.  The latest was modified a tad due to 
material shortages - the changes shouldn't affect the results too much.


        7lb GWM Pale Malt
        14oz 36L Carastan (Huge Baird)
        .5oz chocolate


        7.25 gal supply water treated with 14gm gypsum, 1.5 gm chalk


        Mash in with 8qt`at`170f for a target of 153-155f.  Conversion
        done in 30 minutes.  Mash out at 168.  Sparge with remaining
        supply liqour to collect 6.25 gal.  90 min boil.


        12gm chinook pellets for 60 min
        10gm willamette pellets for 5 min
        20gm kent goldings for 5 min


        1/4tsp irish moss for 10 min.


        OG 1.051 in 5.5 gal (needed to add a qt to bring the volume up)


        Ferment with Wyeast 1028 (london ale) at around 68f


        Rack to secondary after fermention dies down and dry hop with
        10gm cascade pellets and 20gm Kent Goldings.  Let sit until
        fermentation completely done (e.g. pellet crud sinks) - about
        a week or two.


        Prime/bottle/keg in the usual manner.  


The original recipe used 20gm each of willamette and Kent Goldings instead
of the chinooks, and used cascade instead of the willamette in the second
addition. Also, it used 12oz of 16L and 4oz of 70L crystal instead of 
the 36L stuff, above.  The changes should yield the same color and 
bitterness.  The aroma and body will be a bit different, but with all 
that dry hopping I doubt many will be able to tell the difference.
With the above hopping levels this beer is not as bitter as, say, Grants
IPA - but then I don't like overly hopped beers (shields up) - yet it is
bitter enough to make it an IPA and not just a random pale ale.


Cheers!

4 of July and I found myself at the door accidentally.(driving by on my
way up North)
They were having a big party in the back with a keg throwing contest.
The back was an outdoor beer garden with grape and hops growing all over.
The bartender told me that the hops outside were Cluster, and they were 
full of fragrant cones.
The brewmaster was running the keg throw and it looked pretty bizarre. In
a long sandbox, the contestant picks up this keg (75lbs for women, I
estimate 150 for men) and hurls it forward and it crashs into the sand!
 (The high score was 115 inches)
At one point, Someone egged me on to try it. Being on the scrawny side, I could
only lift it up over my legs, and I gave up (dislocated shoulders are no fun!).
The women hi score was 86 when I left the pub. 
They had Eye of the Hawk on tap (Red Tale X 2) and it was delicious. All the
other beers were good too, especially on tap.
Since everyone was busy having a good time, I didn't pester them about their
brewing procedure, but I found out that they don't dry hop! and they use
cascade and cluster (1/3, 2/3 or is it the other way)
Went back there on my way down (July 5) and they ran out of beer on tap
except for Red Tail and Black Hawk Stout.
Its a great place!
P.
p.s. At their gift store, they have a poster on the door that was given
 to them. It has a map of California and a list of all the brewing company in CA
plotted on the map, on each side of the poster are the name/address/phone
number of each brewing company or brewpub. The name of the printing company
was somewhere in san Jose. I forgot to copy the name. Have anyone seen
this poster? Do you know where I can get one?

I am also very interseted in this book, but have only seen it advertised.
My hope is that it will replace Dave Line's book which for us Americans 
can be difficult to follow and unfortunately is getting to be a bit out

Subject: Get-together at Oregon Brewer's Festival


Six people responded to say they are interested in gathering at the Fest.  Here
is when and where we will meet:


        Where: The Bridgeport Stand (where Bridgeport Brewery is pouring
               their beers) at the Festival location.  The Festival location
               is the Waterfront Park located along the river in downtown
               Portland.


        When:  Saturday, July 18, at 3PM


The Festival opens that day at noon and goes 'til 9PM.  I'm leaving for Oregon on July
10, so unfortunately I don't have much time to consult with the respondents.
The above time seems to work for everyone.  If someone has an alternative suggestion,
let me know soon.  Otherwise this is it.


See you there!

John,


I will be working at the Brewers Festival Friday night and probably be
attending for the purpose of consumptionearly Saturday afternoon. I've
found eqq  early attendance beneficial as the more popular (and often better)
brews tend to run out ealry in the day.


ANyway, as thhe event approaches, we can set out specifics to meet.

John:


I will be going to the Oregon brewer's Fest all 3 days.  I live in Southern Cal.
and have airplane reservations for the morning of the 17th.  I haven't made any
hotel reservations, I will be doing that tonight.  I'm also not sure yet if I am
going to rent a car.  I plan on calling one of the Brews Brothers to help me
work out the logistics.  I am also going to volunteer to help.  I hope to see
other Homebrew Digest subscribers there also.


The return address on the header of my message will not work since it is a new 
system and not in the nameserver tables yet.  You can try:


        haberman`at`192.42.141.199                (numeric address for system in header)
                or

Subject: ROOTBEER




My note on the possible hazards of genuine rootbeer
elicited a response from D. Popowich asking for details.
I lost his email address and this is tangentially related
to homebrewing, so here goes ...


Root beer is flavored with a distillate of the young shoots
or root bark of _Sassofras_variifolium_, a member of the 
laurel family.  (I remember shaving off pieces of bark to chew
upon as a child in Trumbull, CT.)  Sassafras has also been
used to make tea for medicinal and enjoyment, and to make a 
yellow dye.  In addition, an oil from sassafras fruit has been 
used in perfumery.


The trouble with sassafras is that it contains _safrole_, a
carcinogen (see the NTP 85-002, 1985).  Safrole (aka
5-(2-Propenyl)1,3-benzodioxole, aka allylcatechol methylene ether,
aka 4-allyl-1,2-methylenedioxybenzene, aka allyldioxybenzene 
methylene ether, aka m-allylpyrocatechin methylene ether) is 
about 75% of oil of sassafras.  It has been used as a topical
antiseptic and a pediculicide (lice treatment).  Its oral toxicity
in rats is 50% lethality at a dose of 1.95 g per kg.  
                             
So, if you must indulge, do so in moderation!

Subject: US book on Porter


I recently had the pleasure of meeting Bob Grossman at the Durden Park
Beer Circle, whilst he was over in London courtesy Young's brewery. I
believe it was his prize for being master brewer at last year's AHA. He
had with him a book entitled 'Porter' and I would be interested in 
getting a copy. Can anyone give me more details, as in Authors, correct/
full title, publisher, etc.


I would also be interested in knowing what other books are recommended
reading for the US homebrewer (full details please including ISBN)


Many thanks

Gases are *more* soluble in water as temperature drops,
and I suspect that beer is enough like water for this to hold
true in brew.


Specifically, the solubility of CO2 in H2O (ml per 100 ml `at` 760 mmHg)
is 171 `at` 0  degrees C,
is  88 `at` 20  "
and 36 `at` 60 ".


Perhaps the length of the tubing in the "jockeybox" is the problem.
The amount of beer sitting in the tubing and the amount of time
any sip of beer spend sitting in the tubing increase with tubing
length.  10 feet of tubing with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm2 
will easily accommodate an entire glass of beer.

An article in Zymurgy a couple of years back described a "Honeywell
T6031A 1029 Refrigeration temperature Controller" which is available for
less than $40 at any wholesale heating/cooling supply.  You get this
gizmo, which comes complete with a temperature probe, and wire it using a
3-prong heavy-duty air conditioner extension cord.  Synopsis of wiring
diagram: Those types of cords have three wires - a ribbed one, the center
one, and a smooth one; cut the smooth one to wire it into the controller.
If you've got a round cord with colored wires, cut the black one.  (Or
else look up the Zymurgy article for a real wiring diagram.) The article
even described how you can use self-adhesive hook gizmos to keep the
temperature probe line orderly.  That's all - and all parts are available

Subject: Kegging basics






 I have seen the light, and it is made of stainless steel....


 Greetings. After having asked several dozen stupid questions about kegging,
I have decided that I should pull all of this information together into one
article for the amusement and edification of the Digest. 


I. Items needed for a kegging setup 


 Kegging is the process of packaging beer so it may be dispensed. To this end,
you need a package. The normal container for the homebrewer is the Cornelius
or Firestone stainless-steel premix soft-drink container. It is available from
many sources, including restaurant auctions, scrapyards, cooperative soft-drink
retailers, and other sources. Use your ingenuity, and you will seldom go wrong.


 The other items to go with your keg are used for the dispensing process. They
allow you to dispense the beer under gas pressure, and to connect and disconnect
the equipment from your keg.


 These items are:


                A CO2 cylinder. Most hobbyists purchase a 5 Lb. one.


                a pressure regulator. This reduces the 800 PSI of gas
                pressure in the CO2 tank to a manageable dispensing
                pressure (usually 5 to 7 pounds).


                Hose with gas-in fitting. These items conduct the gas to
                the keg from the regulator, and allow you to connect the
                gas line to the keg.  The gas-in fittings come in either 
                ball or pin lock. Buy whichever fits the keg you obtain, 
                as one is as good as the other for the homebrewer.


                Liquid-out fitting and beer faucet. This is the part that
                  the beer actually comes out of. It has a fitting like the
                gas-in one, but keyed differently to prevent interchange.
                On the end of the hose from this fitting is a spigot to 
                control the flow. 


 When it comes to the pressure-regulating items and the gas bottle, don't
scrimp, as cheap or defective fittings can be very dangerous. Gas at 800
PSI is not trivial to handle, and an accident could be fatal. 




II. Preparing to keg - How to get ready.


 If you buy all of your equipment new, than you can skip this part. What I
am going to go into here is the cleaning and overhaul of a standard pin-
lock Firestone keg. Cornelius kegs are similar, but I have not worked with 
them and would not speak of them without personal experience.


 WIth a keg that has been used for soft drinks, the rubber parts that are in
contact with the drink become impregnated with the sugar syrups. These will
then flavor any beer you might bring in contact with them, so they need to be
replaced as part of the cleaning and preparation process. These are located
in the bases of the gas-in and liquid-out fittings, and around the lid of the
keg. 


 Remove the gas-in and liquid-out fittings, using a 13/16" open-end wrench
inserted through the gaps in the handle surround. Once loosened, these should
remove easily. Once unscrewed, set these aside, and remove the dip tubes from
the fittings welded to the tank. The gas dip tube is rather short, and the 
liquid dip tube is the long one that extends to the bottom of the tank. Remove
the o-rings from both of these and replace them with new ones from the hardware
store. O-rings of the proper size are easily availablein the plumbing area
of most good hardware stores. Reinsert the dip tubes and reinstall the fittings,
 tightening them with the wrench. Do not overtighten, as it is unnecessary and
will make it more difficult the next time.
NOTE: The gas-in fitting is the one with two lugs. The liquid-out fitting is
the one with three lugs. I got them mixed up too...8*)


 Replacement of the top gasket is easy. Just open the head by lifting the bail,
then drop the head down into the keg and rotate it to remove the lid from the
keg. The O-ring should come out with the lid. Simply remove it from the lid
and replace it. New ones of these should be available at your homebrew 
supplier, or try a pool supplier for a pump O-ring of the proper size. Bring
the old one as a comparison sample.


 CLeaning the keg is rather simple. I usually prepare a solution of washing soda and soak a new keg full of it for 24 hours, followed by purging the solution
with CO2 through the fittings on the tank. This is followed by 2 gallons of
boiling water, well-agitated in the tank to clear the residue, and purged thru
the fititngs with CO2. The boiling water rinse is also a god way to clean out
a tank before use, along with a weak chlorine rinse for sanitizing.


III. Kegging - The process


 Kegging is considerably simpler than bottling, but has a set of gotchas all
its own. 


 The first step is sanitizing the keg. I personally do this with a rinse of
hot water and B-Brite of a gallon or so, shaken in a sealed keg, then expelled
through the keg plumbing with CO2. After this, I do the same thing with 
boiling water, again expelling through the plumbing, to clear the B-Brite 
residue. One pass is usually sufficient, though if I'm being paranoid, I'll do
it twice. After this step, you must handle the keg in a manner to retain the
sanitation. This means not taking out the lid and laying it down on the work-
bench in the basement. Treat the keg as you would a sanitized bottle ready to
 fill.


Next, add the priming syrup to the keg. I usually use 1/2 cup of sugar to 1 qt.
water, boiled for 10 minutes for sanitation. I cool this to blood temp, then
add it to the keg. Next, with a sanitized siphon hose,siphon your finished
beer into the keg, being careful not to splash, but swirling enough to get a 
good mix on the priming sugar. Once filled (keep the beer level below the CO2
inlet, otherwise don't worry), reinsert the lid and cinch it closed. Before
doing this, I usually turn on the CO2 to the keg and purge the airspace above
the beer to clear the residual air in the tank.


 With the keg sealed, pressurize it to 5-6 PSI to seat the head. If it begins
to leak, open and reseat it, which usually cures the problem. Make sure that
the lid isn't angled, which is easy to do and can cause leaking.


 Allow th beer to carbonate for 1-2 weeks before drinking. I usually discard
the first 1/2 mug out of the keg, as it brings the yeast out with it. After
that, it's home free.


                                        I need a beer after all this typing...

Subject: Adjusting ph of sparge water


I am an extract brewer who is looking into doing full mashes. I have been
reading up on the subject and, even better, reading all the old digests(a gold
mine of info). A couple of posts recently have confused me about the whole
mashing process. As I understand it, adjusting the ph of mash water is so that
the enzymes can convert the maximum amount of starches to sugar. If this is so
(correct me if it is not), after conversion is complete what purpose does
adjusting the ph of the sparge water accomplish? If the enzymes are done why
make the sparge water more acidic? Is there some other _good_ reason for doing
this? 


On another topic, I will be traveling to San Diego soon and would like up-to-
date info on brewpubs and bars with great tap beer. I searched through the
old digests and came up with these brewpubs:


    Pacific Beach Brewhouse
    La Jolla Brewing Co.
    Callahan's
    Old Columbia Brewing Co.
    Mission Brewery
    
If anyone could send me any more info on these or newer brew pubs it would be
greatly appreciated.

  Someone else will probably point this out, but just in case...I think
Jack S. meant to say *lager* yeast will continue to eat right down to the
freezing point.  Most, if not all (?) *ale* yeast will stop working well
above that point.  But your concern about storing lager yeast at cold

Subject: smoked beers


Liberty Malting of Seattle (see their ads in Zymurgy) carries a rauch
beer malt.  Their malts aren't cheap, and unless you're local, you'll
have to have them ship it to you.  But, it's an excellent malt.  A couple
pounds of it in your favorite recipe will impart a sweet, smoky flavor.


You can smoke malts on your backyard grill.  Use hickory, mesquite, or
fruit tree wood such as apple.  Wet the grain and dry it over the 
charcoal and wood fire.  You'll have to turn the grain to dry it 
evenly.  Those of you who attended AHA National in Milwaukee might 
have visited the Chicago Beer Society table or hospitality suite, where
we were serving a Russian Imperial Stout (first runnings) and a Porter
(second runnings) made with some smoked malt.


The commercial Rauch Biers most of us have access to are said to be in
the Vienna style.  Some German brewers also make a seasonal smoked Bock.
I also read somewhere in the Michael Jackson Pocket Guide that there
are a number of smoked wheat beers.  Other styles that would seem to
benefit from some smoked malt are Scotch Ale, in addition to the 
above-mentioned Porter and Russian Imperial Stout styles.


If you're an extract brewer, use a simple partial mash technique and some
smoked barley malt.  If you start with some smoked malt, crack it, steep
it, strain the water, and continue with your usual brewing process.

Subject: highly modified malts


On the prompting of local friends, and recent discussion in this forum,
I made a visit to the Sherlock's Home brewpub outside of Mpls.
(interesting that I just *happen* to live here...he..he..)  Very, very good....
Very smooth.  Perhaps I should visit England some day.....


But I digress.  I got hold of the Brewmaster ( great fellow!), and he made
quite a point that they use only English 'highly modified' malt.  From Papazian
I understand that this refers to grain that has been allowed to 'sprout' more,
increasing the enzyme content and reducing the starch content (it goes into 
forming the rootlets, which are discarded).


Now the question: has anyone out there experimented with USA versus 
English malt, and if so can you describe the difference in character 
they give to a brew? 


The Brewmaster at Sherlock's said forcefully "you CANNOT make english-style 
brews using USA malt."  Is it the highly modified malt that gives their 
brews their smooth character, or is it brewing skill, etc. etc....?

In Homebrew Digest #919 (8-Jul-92), smith%8616.span`at`fedex.msfc.nasa.gov asks:


> How can one add "body" to a quick mead?  


In my experience, adding more honey (two to four pounds per gallon) helps 
make the flavor more "real".  In addition, remember to skim off the white 
and brown foam when it is heating/boiling - that helps keep the taste clean.


I've found that adding bay-leaf and marjoram as spices with some fresh
ginger root and some lemon peel makes a really flavor-ful drink that
doesn't have that "thin-ness" that simple honey/water mix makes.


My basic recipe is lemon peel and ginger, and I've found that it is
refreshing in a "ginger-ale" way, but adding the bay-leaf in small amounts 
(one bay-leaf or two per 5-gal batch) adds a "woody" flavor to make it 
more beer-like.  The marjoram (or rosemary) adds a light flower-scent
which enhances the honey-nature of the drink.


Another way to improve body: use darker honeys - if you use a really dark 
honey, such as a "raw" wildflower honey, you can get something like a
"dark" mead.


Good luck!

    Silicone rubber caulks, unless marked "safe for aquarium use", contain
    poison (cyanide? arsenic compounds?  I don't remember) to resist the
    formation of mold and mildew when used outdoors or in dark, damp places.
    This poison will leach out over time and kill your fish if you use the
    standard caulk in an aquarium.  I would not use it in beer-making.  The
    "safe" kind should be all right.  The "solvent" released during curing
    is acetic acid, and is common to all silicone caulks.  It shouldn't do
    any worse than sting your eyes if you get too close while the caulk is
    setting up.

    If you buy it as "Aquarium Sealer" in a pet store, then yes, it will be
    much more expensive.  If you just go to the hardware store and get a
    tube that's marked "safe for aquaria", then it shouldn't be any more
    expensive than the standard mildew-resistant stuff.

Howdy,


First of all, this mailing list is awesome.  It's the first thing I read
each morning, and makes my day usually.


I am a novice brewer, with about 20 batches under my belt, and am interested
in getting a load of new recipes to try.  Does anyone have an archive of
recipes they can send me?  Hypercard stacks?  I use extracts now, but will
be switching to all-grain next month.


What is a cold break?  Hot break?


Why didn't my lager ferment after nearly a month in the fridge?   I suspect
that the temperature was around 38-42 degrees in there?  Is this too cold?
It's sittin' on the counter now, having fermented at about 70f for a week,
and is finally ready to bottle.  Glad I took a "final" gravity after  I
took it out of the fridge.


It there anyone else out there who brews 10 gallons at a time?  Do you
do anything different because of that?


Is there anyone else in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill area reading this?


Thanks for the time and the raffle ticket!

    I also have a very high iron content in my water. I use a
    water filter which filters out most of the iron from the
    water. The one we use is for the whole house, however you can
    purchase filters that hook up under the kitchen sink. Sears
    has a good selection of filter holders and filters
    specifically for iron removal. Also, most home building supply
    stores carry these. Prices are usually less the $50.


    If you get one of these, you can then use sanitizer you like.

Does that mean you advocate not introducing oxygen into the keg?
I know some people say that they flush the air out with CO2

I have wondered about this myself.  Does anyone have an
explanation for it?  Considering that your bottled beer will last
a year at basement temps just fine, why shouldn't a keg do the
same?  Is it because air gets in when you tap the keg?  Or do
just microorganisms get in?  Or what?

I think the unit Brian is describing is the Hunter Air-Stat (or something
very close to that name).  I have one that I use to control my 'fridge.  
It works perfectly well, controlling the temperature within +-2 degrees F
of the set-point.  I believe the lower limit on the temperature is 35
degrees and the upper limit is 99 (but don't quote me on it :-).  I'm sure 
it would work as well with a freezer.  It works just like Brian describes 
it.  This unit has been discussed many times in this digest.  I found mine 
at a semi-local hardware store called Home Depot.  I think these are in 
serveral regions around the country.  It cost about $25.  You may be able 
to find it in many do-it-yourself stores.

Has anyone else noticed that the Wyeast #3056 (Bavarian wheat) seems to be
less "clovey" and rich since they changed their packaging?  I make weizen
quite a bit, and lately my batches just haven't been as rich as they used
to be.  Perhaps Jeff Frane knows something about this.

I've used cloves for spiced ales, and my advice would be *go easy*.  It
doesn't take much to add that character.  I had good luck by simmering
3-4 whole cloves (not crushed) in water, then adding the whole thing to
the primary.


In fact, I'll post the recipe.  I'm normally an all-grain brewer, but
this is a twist on a kit beer.  I find that spices tend to mask any sort
of "canned" flavors, and with the time you save you can brew a lot of
it, like for a party.  The spices balanced perfectly after a few weeks
in the bottle.


        Easy Spiced Brown Ale


        MountMellick Brown Ale Kit
        3-4 whole cloves
        3 whole cinnamon sticks
        1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
        4 oranges
        1/8 cup Hallertau hops (fresh)


        Simmer spices, hops, and zest of 1 orange in 1 qt water for
        30-45 minutes.  Make Brown Ale according to 3.6 gallon recipe.
        Add spice mixture (do not strain) and zest of other three
        oranges to wort.  Ferment, strain, and bottle according to kit
        instructions.

 Mike Daly asks about where to purchase bottled California beers while visiting
San Francisco. The following are all in San Francisco in various parts of the
city.


The Jug Shop
1567 Pacific Ave (at Polk)
Good selection of locally produced beers including Marin Brewing Co.


Cannery Wine Cellar
The Cannery at Fisherman's Wharf
Large selection of local and international beers. Expensive. Also great
selection of Single Malts.


Coit Liquors
Columbus Ave. and Union St.
OK selection of local beers. Very well priced. (You might still find some SN
Mai Bock if you are here in the next two weeks or so)


Liquor Barn
201 Bayshore Blvd.
OK selection of local beers. Poorly handled.


Almost all Safeways have some local stuff these days. Anderson Valley,
Winchester, Rogue, Mendocino to name a few I have spied. Both the Northpoint
and Marina Safeways have these and I am told selection is similar elsewhere in
the city.


Enjoy the trip!

Subject: oats and other adjuncts


As I understand it, specialty grains do not need to be mashed.  They
could be mashed, but only really need to be sparged.  Is this true?
Is it better to mash them, or not mash them?  Is it bad to mash them?


And what is the difference between Quaker oats, Steel-cut oats, milled
oats, rolled oats etc?  As I gather from yesterday's digest, they
need to be mashed.  Do you throw them in with the mash or cook them
first?
