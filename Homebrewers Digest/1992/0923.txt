 A couple of questions on sparging. 1. Why cant one reuse the sparge
 water to decrease the amount needed. Perhaps also get better yield?
 2. Why cant one add cold water to the fermenter with mash recipes like
 one does in extract?

Lately I've heard of people talking about not wanting to use Clorine.
Why not??  I started out using B-brite (5-6 years ago), but for the last

Subject: grinding grain in the kitchen??


Is there a danger in grinding grain in the same room that I brew in? 
I think I remember hearing/reading about the grain dust causing
contamination problems, but I'm not sure.  Should I be grinding my grain
in the basement, or maybe doing it a day in advance??  Help ....


Does it matter if I use a MALTMILL or not :-) :-)


Thanks,
Richard Stern


PS.  Here's the MALTMILL #100 tally as I see.  Jack's post was the last
one in digest #917.  Digest 918 had 14 posts, 919 had 22 posts and 920
had 33 posts for a total of 69.  That means if there are at least 31 posts
in this digest (#921), then the winner is the 31st entry in this digest.
Is it me??  :-)  (at least I've asked reasonable questions in each post).

Subject: English vs. American malt


Hi,


This is in regard to someones query about the difference between English
and American malts.  I may not have had huge experience in this area, but
I have made about 15 all-grain batches for each of American and English malt.
I get my malt in 50lb sacks from William's Brewing here in California.
The american kind is called Klagges and the english kind is called English Pale
Ale.  Both are fully modified, and I believe both are from 2-row malt.  This
information is for Williams only, since I have no experience with others.


The add in the catalogue stated that for the "authentic" English taste, you
needed English Pale Ale malt.  Beliveing this, I bought a 50lb sack of 
Klagges, and a 55lb sack of English Pale Ale.  I brewed a pale batch out
of each, using cultured English Ale yeast, also originally form Williams.
The recipes were not exact, but they were close in style.  They were made
about a month apart.  Oh, and both were made using single step infusion
process as recommended by some for British beers.


I liked them both, but to be honest, I could not tell if one malt was
obviously superior to the other.  I cannot comment on the "authenticity"
of the English flavor since I have never been across the Atlantic.
All in all, I couldn't tell much of a difference between the two.  
Discalimer:  These are my own views of similar beers in an uncontrolled
experiment.

True.


"Almost all Safeways have some local stuff these days."


True.


There are a few good stores in the Haight ... one liquor store I can think
of that has a nice variety, maybe two. Some exotics can also be found at
a liquor store on Cole Street, right between Carl and Parnassus.


Down around the intersection of Haight and Fillmore is a bar called the
Toronado, which has a nice selection of beers on tap. Perhaps the widest
selection in the city. You'd find a wealth of suggestions here, since a
goodly percentage of the clientele are home brewers. ( Seems that brewing
and indoor home gardening go hand in hand. :-) Alas, it's a somewhat
rowdy crowd, so I advise that you dress 'comfortably' ... levis, leather,
avoid allowing yourself to be stereotyped as a 'suit'.

Subject:  Colorado Brewers Festival - Review


Well, nobody's mentioned anything about the Colorado Brewers Festival
held in Fort Collins, CO held this past June 27, so here's a review (it's also
an entry in the WORLD'S GREATEST GIVEAWAY!).


Setup:
This was the third annual festival, held in Old Town Square.  The organizers 
are finally figuring out how to do it right.  Last year, it was crammed into
a small area and was a madhouse.  This year, they closed off a section of the
street downtown and put the serving lines there.  Much better.  You could
actually get a beer in under 5 minutes, compared to 20-30 last year.  The food
vendors were in a separate area from the beer serving lines.


Beers:
The beer selection, well, how should I put it, SUCKED.  Each brewery was
limited to 1 beer, and most of them were lighter beers (last year they could
bring whatever they wanted to).  I'm a stout/porter drinker, and I was hard
pressed to find anything close to the style I like.  The darkest I could find
was "Black Bear Porter" from the San Juan Brewing Company.  I could see
daylight through it, so my craving for diluted malt syrup was not satisfied!
I was happy to see the serving lines for Anheuser-Busch and Coors were the
shortest, people were going for the beers with more flavor (America is 
being educated?).


Entertainment:
Several live bands performed.  The more I drank, the better they sounded.


Cost:
You bought a mug for $1.00.  Tokens for 6-ounce servings were $1.00 each.


Overall, the quality of beers was quite high, some had minor problems, but
I still had a great time.  A list of breweries and beers follows:


Anheuser-Busch                  Bud Dry
H.C. Berger Brewing             Indigo Ale
Boulder Beer/Wilderness Pub     Boulder Amber
Breckenridge Brewpub            Avalanche
Carver's Bakery/Cafe Brewery    Raspberry Wheat
Champion Brewing                Irish Red Ale
CooperSmith's Pub & Brewing     Dunkelweizen
Coors                           Coors Dry
Durango Brewing Co.             Durango Dark Lager
Flying Dog Brewpub              Doggie Style
Hubcap Brewery                  Summer Celebration
Idle Spur Crested Butte         Red Lady

Subject: 1993 Conference, maltmill


1993 Conference:


I read in the last Zymurgy that the 1993 conference will be moved into
August so as to be around the same time as the Oregon Brewer's Festival.
Recently, I read here that the Festival is in July this year. So, does
anyone have the real poop on this coordination effort ?
Are both events going to be held within the same week or what ?


Maltmill:


I purchased a maltmill a few months ago and have used it in about 10 batches
of all grain. I think these 3 statements sum up the pros of the product:


1. My extract efficiency went up around 4 points per pound.
2. I had an astringency problem with most of my previous batches. I attributed
   this to a poor crush with too much powder. Alas, I cound never rid myself
   of the powder without leaving 1/2 of the grain untouched. So far, all 5
   batches tasted have lacked this bitterness.
3. I can crush my grain bill 75 % faster than with a Corona (I sold it to a
   friend). 


The cons ?


1. I have a hard time catching the crushed grain as it leaves the mill. I
   have to wrap the entire unit inside a plastic bag. I need to fabricate
   some kind of chute to direct the grain to a receptacle.
2. Sometimes, a piece of grain goes in funny and pushes the 2 rollers apart
   to the point where they stop making contact. I have to reverse direction
   for 1/2 a turn and then continue.


All in all, I think the mill is great. I bought the roller spacing option
which allows you to vary the space between the rollers for tweaking. I
recommend against it. I suspect the problem I have with intermittent slipping
is somehow related. In the right hands, I imagine you could do wonders with
the option, but I think it works fine without it. I've crushed Briess Wheat,
Briess Klages, Briess Crystal, Munton & Fison ale lager and specialty malts
without moving the rollers and gotten terrific results. The couple of times
I attempted adjustment were disasters (for me, anyway).


Congratulations on a great product, Jack.

Subject: FWD: A Couple of Recipes ...




Folks,


Here are two recipes that have worked out really well for
me in the past.  The first is a simple "kit" beer, the
second an all-grain.


1) Porter? Porter?  -  Recipe for 5 gallons.


        6.6#  Telford's Porter (2 cans)
        1 oz. Styrian Goldings Plugs (alpha 5.3)
                Bittering (1hr)
        1 oz. Hallertau Plugs (alpha 2.9)
                Flavoring (10 min)
        Wyeast #1056


        O.G. = 1.048
        F.G. = 1.020


Add the 2 cans of malt extract to 3 gallons boiling water,
bring the mix back to a boil, then add Bittering Hops.  I
used a hop bag, so the utilization probably wasn't that
teriffic, but then again the malts are pre-hopped some, so
I wasn't too concerned about that.  Add finishing hops
with 10 min left in the boil.  Add tap water to 5 gallons,
cool to 75F and pitch yeast starter (~12oz).  Lag time is
about 12 hours.


This produces a well-balanced (there's that word again!)
porter, neither too dry nor too sweet. I currently have a
batch of this fermenting with Wyeast Irish Stout Yeast to
see if that will make it a wee bit drier.




2)  ChuckWeiser  -  Recipe for 5 gallons.


        5.0#  Lager Malt
        1.0#  Flaked Maize
        0.5#  Rice Syrup/Solids
        1 oz. Hallertau Leaf (alpha 4.0)
                Bittering (1 hr)
        1 oz. Saaz Leaf (alpha 3.0)
                Bittering (1 hr)
        1/4oz.Tettnang Leaf (alpha 4.0)
                Finishing (Boil 5 min, steep 10 min)
        Wyeast #2124


        O.G. = 1.038
        F.G. = 1.008


Mash Schedule:


30 min - Protein Rest `at`132F
90 min - Slowly raise temp to 155F
15 min - `at`155F
15 min - Mash-out `at`170




Bring mash liquid to a boil, add bittering hops (no hop
bag for this one), boil 1hr.  Add finishing hops, boil 5
minutes, steep 10 minutes, pour into primary, cool to 75F,
and pitch yeast starter ...




This recipe produces a light - but not thin tasting -
North American style lager (steam?).  The Tettnang
Finishing hops gave a really nice fresh aroma to the beer.


Good luck,


 -Chuck-

"On Tap" is put out by the World Beer Review people (Steve Johnson, I believe).
It details brewpubs and micros in the U.S. with a page showing locations,
directions, beers available, and info about the type of place (fern bar, yuppie
hangout, sleazepit or whatever).  It was put out in 1991 (I think) and there is
already a supplement out. It costs about $15 and the supplement costs about
$10. WBR has ads in Zymurgy, and is located in Clemson, SC. If anybody is
really interested, and can't find them in Zymurgy, I will post the address (I
don't have it with me now). 


I don't have the supplement yet, but I do have "On Tap" and I would recommend
it to anybody that does a lot of traveling to different cities and wants to
check out the local beer.


And, no, I have no connection to WBR.

Subject: Keg priming questions


Now I've done it!  It seems I've slightly over-primed my first (Cornelius)
keg of beer.  I went and used 2/3 C dextrose before bothering to read the
TCJOHB appendix on kegging.  What's my best bet for reducing the resulting
carbonation level in the keg?  Should I bother?


The beer, a coriander/orange brew, has been under 10 psi of CO2 at about
60-65F for a week now.  Should I bleed off some of the CO2 in the headspace
to allow more of the dissolved CO2 to come out of solution?  Should I chill
the keg down first?  Should I forget it and simply serve it good and cold
to keep the CO2 in solution?


The recent posts regarding kegging have been most helpful.  Any further
tips  would also be greatly appreciated.  Sure beats the heck out of
bottling!


On a related question, how does one use the CO2 table (plotting volumes of
CO2 in beer as a function of PSI and temperature) found in the LISTSERV
archive?

I recently bought one from American Brewmaster mail-order after seeing their ad
in the latest Zymurgy.  If you can find it in the air-conditioning section
of a hardware store like Keith did, you'll save a couple of bucks by 
eliminating the middle-man.  Williams charged me $29.  Works great.
 
Anyway, here's a related story.  Now that it's a little too warm to ferment
for us basement-deprived brewers,  I decided to make use of that little 
refrigerator I had in my college dorm way back when.  It's much too small
for a 5 gallon carboy, so I removed the door, made a wood-frame box, 
lined it with 2-inch stryrofoam, weather-stripped its face, and butted it up
against the little fridge.  The top is removable, and I secured it to the
little fridge with bungee cords.  I plugged the fridge into the temperature  
controller last night.  I easily maintained a temperature of 50 F for its
first test.  


I'm curious to see how cold I can make it.  The entire unit sits on a 
shelf in my garage.  When comparing it to a full-sized fridge, it's a 
great space and money saver.

I'm fairly new to the Homebrew Digest (a month or so) and am not familiar
with such etiquette as repeating past postings.  In the short time I've
been reading the HBD, I've seen enough messages that begin "I'm new..."
that it's probably safe to assume that quite a few readers haven't seen
the Wyeast posting mentioned above, so I will include it here.  (I've
waited one issue to see if anyone else was going to post this.)


But first, I must point out that the Zymurgy special issue from 1989
was on yeast, and had a good article by Byron Burch entitled "Of Yeasts
and Beer Styles" that gives addition (subjective) information.  I'd
type in the descriptions of my favorites, but I'm pressed for time
today, and don't know about copyright problems.


Now, here is the relevant information from CompuServe's WYEAST.TXT
(which as you can see, originated on the Homebrew Digest!):

From: D_KRUS`at`UNHH.UNH.EDU (Daniel L. Krus)
Subject: Yeast and Spec. Grav's.


There's been a few questions lately about yeast and characteristics
associated
with them.  Here is a retype of some information I received from Wyeast
relative to their yeast.  This information was obtained a while ago and
supposedly this was to be updated and expanded.  If anyone has the latest
update I would appreciate a copy of it from you since Wyeast wasn't too
tickled that I contacted them directly.  Sorry if there are any typos.


(Information about NEW strains Belgian Ale [#1214] and California Lager
[#2112] contributed Jan. 23, 1992, by Beer Forum member Bill McKinless,
of The Home Brewery in Teaneck, N.J.)


YEAST CHARACTERISTICS


Some yeast strains are more active and vigorous than others.  Lager
strains
in particular do not show as much activity on the surface as many of the
Ale strains.  We provide an adequate quantity of yeast to complete
fermen-
tation with varying amounts of lag time depending on strain, freshness,
handling, and temperature.  If you find it too slow, make a starter as
recommended on the package.  In any event, a closed fermenter with an
airlock is recommended.


TEMPERATURE


The slow onset of visible signs of fermentation can be improved by
starting
fermentation at 75 deg. F (24 deg. C) until activity is evident, then
moving to your desired fermentation temperature.  A few degrees does
make
a significant difference without adversely affecting flavor.


The normal temperature for Ale yeast range from 60-75 deg. F (16-24 deg.
C)
A few strains ferment well down to 55 deg. F (13 deg. C).  68 deg. F (20
deg. C) is a good average.  Lager strains normally ferment from 32-75
deg.
F (0-24 deg. C).  50-55 deg. F (10-12 deg. C) is customary for primary
fermentation.  A slow steady reduction to 32 deg. F (0 deg. C) during
secondary fermentation typically works well.


The fermentation rate is directly related to temperature.  The lower the
temperature, the slower fermentation commences.  Fluctuations in
tempera-
ture such as cooling and warming from night to day can adversely affect
yeast performance.


ATTENUATION


Apparent attenuation of yeast normally ranges from 67-77%.  The
attenuation
is determined by the composition of the wort or juice and the yeast
strain
used.  Each yeast strain ferments different sugars to varying degrees,
resulting in higher or lower final gravities.  This will affect the
resid-
ual sweetness and body.


FLOCCULATION


All brewing yeast flocculate.  The degree and type of flocculation
varies
for different yeast.  Some strains clump into very lary flocculate.
Some
floc very little into a more granular consistency.  Most yeast strains
clump and flocculate to a moderate degree.


pH RANGES


Typical pH range for yeast fermentations begins at about 5.1 and
optimally
4.8.  During the course of fermentation the pH reduces to typically 3.9-
4.1 and as low as 3.1 in some wines.


ALCOHOL TOLERANCES


The alcohol tolerance for most brewing yeast is as least to 8%.  Barley
wines to 12% can be produced by most Ale strains.  Pitching rates need
to
be increased proportionally to higher gravities.  Alternately, Champagne
and Wine yeast can be used for high gravities sometimes reaching
alcohols
to 18%.

Boston Brewing Co. Tour 


I was recently in Boston for a conference, so I decided to check out
the Boston Brewing Company (Samuel Adams beers). I took the "T"
(subway) down south of town to Jamaica Plain, and walked through a
pretty bad neighborhood to get to the brewery. They only conduct tours
twice a week (Saturdays and Thursdays), so I planned ahead. There is a
nice area with lots of old Boston beer memorabilia to look at while
waiting for the tour to start. There is also a display (*inside* an old
conditioning tank) which takes you through the process of making beer
and gets you to answer some trick questions about beer.


Soon the tour gets started, and a young fellow takes you around and
shows you their brewing set-up. His knowledge is somewhat lacking
(couldn't even *name* another type of hops besides Hallertauer when
queried), but probably adequate for the general public. The brewery is
rather small; it only brews beer for the Boston area. Another brewery
in Utica, NY brews for the east coast, and west coast Samuel Adams is
brewed in Portland, OR.


Boston Brewing Co. is definitely a brewery with an attitude. They are
decidedly snooty about beer, and about their beer in particular. They
make a big deal out of a number of things:


  1. Their beer follows Reinheitsgebot (the German beer purity law) and
     is the only American beer sold in Germany.
     
  2. European beer is not fresh and is adulterated with corn for the
     American market (of course they are mainly referring to Heineken
     and Becks, but they don't make a distinction).
     
  3. The big American brewers are great brewers, but don't brew good
     beers.
  4. Beers bottled in green or clear bottles are skunky. They talk
     about the bottle color being determined by the marketing
     department when the bottles are green. They use Miller as an
     example of a beer that gets skunky because it is in a clear
     bottle, but we homebrewers know that Miller can get away with a
     clear bottle only because it chemically treats its beers to
     prevent skunkiness.
     
  5. They won the Great American Beer Festival three years running. The
     story I've heard on the net is that Sam Adams won the consumer
     preference poll because they hired a fetching young lass in a
     revealing outfit to serve their beer and ask for votes. I've also
     heard that this kind of unfair campaigning was the main reason
     that the consumer preference poll was discontinued, leaving only
     the blind panel judging. 


After the tour, you are escorted into a tasting room where you can
sample their wares. We tried Samuel Adams Lager, Samuel Adams Ale, and
Samuel Adams Wheat. I must admit that, even though I was a bit put off
by their cockiness, I really like their beers. I would describe them as
assertively hopped, but not as strongly hopped as an Anchor or a Sierra
Nevada beer. They also have a nice maltiness, and the wheat beer had a
hint of a clove taste, as well as good wheat character. They also make
seasonal beers, including an Oktoberfest, a Winter Ale, a Double Bock,
the famous Cranberry Wheat beer (made with a touch of maple syrup for
New England flavor), and possibly a Cream Stout (they had just made a
small batch when I was there). Alas, they had no samples of their other
brews for sale (believe me, I searched).


All in all, it was an enjoyable tour, with the tasting being the high
point. One note for future tour-takers: the tour guide doesn't keep a
good watch on the tap while he's tending the souvenir store, and a
quick refill of your pitcher is easily accomplished :-).

I made a rosemary ale last month.  My basil beer came out well, so
I thought rosemary was worth a try (that is, my girlfriend thought
it was worth a try).  It came out okay, pretty dry (low mash
temps)and clean.  I will offer this advice:  1/2 oz of fresh
rosemary in three gallons of beer is too much.
It will be good for cooking though.


Also, does anyone have a good Anchor Porter recipe?  How is Charlie's
Silver Dollar Porter?  Should I use California Lager yeast or
Irish Ale?

100?


Anyway, I've been meaning to ask this for a while, but now seems like
an oportune moment.


Why do most sources suggest adding the malt extract once the water has
started boiling?  Is there any advantage to adding it then?  I did so
last time, but was a bit slow with the stirring and ended up with quite
a mess from burnt extract and would much rather add the extract when the
water is warm.  I suppose that if I am #100, this may be a moot point as
I will start up all grain, but on the off chance that I am not, any reason
not to add the extract at lower temps.

Subject: Guinness Story




My wife was in DC recently, and when she called back to ask
if there was anything there that I wanted her to bring back,
my mind immediately turned to beer (at least metaphorically).


I remembered reading in a recent HBD that DC was one of the
test markets for Pub Draught Guinness in a can (I had tried
one earlier that I managed to snag in San Francisco), so I 
remarked that a can or two of that delicious stuff (see note 
at end) might be nice, if she could swing it. New Mexico is 
not a thriving distribution center for odd beers. 


Well, I didn't think much more of it until she got home and 
I found out that she had brought me --- not a can --- not
two cans --- but a CASE of Pub Draught Guinness!! I was 
ecstatic! 


It turns out that she had done it the easiest way possible:
she just checked the whole case as luggage. She figured that,
since it was in cans, it would probably be okay. Anyway, if 
a few cans did break, the majority would be okay and the 
hassle factor would be minimized. 


Well, the whole case made it to our house okay, and I am now
(figuratively) sitting on what is in all probability the
only case of Pub Draught Guinness in New Mexico. They taste
excellent, with no signs of travel fatigue. What a wonderful 
wife I have! And she doesn't even like stout! (You all have 
permission to show this to your wives for inspiration :-)


Mike Hall


Note: For those of you that don't know, the Guinness people 
have been working on a way to distribute their draught version
(which is significantly different from their bottled version)
easily. Their draught version is "carbonated" with nitrogen,
giving it extremely small bubbles and a very creamy head that
lasts until the end of the beer. They finally came up with a
way that uses a little plastic insert filled with nitrogen 
inside a can of beer, with a little hole to let the nitrogen
squirt out when the can is opened. It tastes very similar to
the draught version. I love it --- it's almost like chocolate
milk with a kick. There was a long article in the HBD on it
around the time it first came out; check your archives if
you want further info.

My guess is that the key problem here is the *quick* part. Honey is a 
notoriously slow fermenter, and even after fermentation tends to improve
with age. Part of that improvement is a perceived thickness. My first batch
of mead was made with only 5 lbs honey, and even after severe aging (I'll
be celebrating the remaining 4 bottles 3rd birthday soon - by drinking one!)
they are still thin compared to my batch made with 7.5 lbs of honey.

Try this recipe:
1 qt boiling water
4 tea bags
lots of ice
sugar to taste


This is a real quick recipe that is very satisfying on a hot day. I guess
you could substitue honey for the sugar to get that *mead* taste >:-)
But seriously, as far as I know, there is no one month recipe for mead if
you plan on using honey (is there any other way?), but if anyone else knows
of one I'd be very interested to here it.


Do they make steroids for yeast?

Howdy gang,


This Saturday (7/11) is the annual KQED Beerfest in San Francisco. For
those within range that are unaware of it, I highly reccommend this event.
There are representatives from breweries all over the world, and of course
samples of all their brews, as well as many different types of grub.
$30 gets you in, buys you a glass and a map, and the rest is up to you. You
get 3 hours to taste/chug this wide variety of beer and food, and its an
excellent oppurtunity to try all those styles and brands that you never 
have got around to. The hardest part is trying to remember which brews you
liked the best after the 103rd sample, but I like a challenge! Finding the
exit afterwards can be quite thrilling as well.
For those that can make it, its well worth the time and money. Unfortunately
I don't remember the address, but its somewhere around 4th and Townsend. I'm
sure you can find out more in the newspaper, or even by calling KQED.


                          Hope to see you all there,

but also because Paul Holborn, the brewmeister is a great guy.  He was behind
