Subject: Re: Storage of kegged beer




John wonders why kegged beer won't store for a year at room
temp. 


I have never wondered about it.  I assumed that kegged beer, under
pressure, would last at room temp just as long as bottled beer.
Although I have not stored beer in kegs at room temp (68f) for
long periods, I have had some beers in the keg at 48f for nearly
a year with no undesirable results.  I have pulled kegs from the
refer for months at a time (partial kegs) without any ill effects.


If anything is different about kegs, at least for me, it is that my
keg tends to be the secondary so I have a fair amount of yeast in
the bottom (say, 1/8 cup or so).  It is possible with large amounts
of yeast that autolysis could set in over a long period of time.


Bottom line for me is that I ain't gonna worry about it.


Cheers!

Subject: Re: oats and other adjuncts


Technically, steel cut oats are RAW and need to be cooked to liberate
the starch.  Probably what happens is that they are chopped up so fine
and the enzymes floating around in a 2 hour mash (:-) have an opportunity
to liquify the starch and conversion happens.


All other forms of oats (flat ones, that is) have been pre-cooked in
the squishing process.  This also holds true for barley, wheat, tritical,
etc.  They don't need ot be cooked.


Also, regarding mashing of specialty grains.  From a technical point
of view all crystal malts (down to cara-pils) have already been "mashed"
in the husk.  Toasted malts (vienna->black patent) have not.  Those 
that have not may dump starch into your brew which might cause a 
warm haze (worse when cold).


As a point of reference: I have easily mashed 7lb of pale malt (us 2-row)
and 1lb each of rolled oats and roast barley to make a fine stout that
has no haze whatsoever.  Granted, you need a strong light to tell!  Oh,
to complete the recipe: 1.25oz of chinooks for 60min.  Yum, yum.


Cheers!

What temperature did you ferment at?  I have heard that keeping the
temp `at` 70-75 F favours the S. Delbruckii more that lower temps, which
favour S. Cervasae (Ale yeast, however you spell it).  My last wheat
beer use Wyeast Bavarian Wheat yeast in the new packaging, and it's
plenty "clovey".  The temp in the basement was around 70F during the
major portion of the fermentation.

Case in point: the IPA recipe I presented in the HBD yesterday: I madi
it first with Marris Otter malt from Liberty and a second time with
Great Western Malting Pale Malt (some mix of klages and harrington).  
Although the first rendition seemed a bit maltier, in fact most people
couldn't really notice the difference.  I think that the high hopping
level of the IPA + the dry hopping might have masked some subtle malt
charactoristic.


Oh, the GWM versions did better in club tasting than the English malt
versions.


One thing about true englishmalts, they are kilned higher than US malts
and thus are a bit darker.  I think that compensating with 10-15% low
Lovibond crystal (say 16L) would largely mask the difference both
in color, body and malt character.


Cheers.

> As I understand it, specialty grains do not need to be mashed.


Personally, I think all grains need to be mashed.  For a partial
mash, If you're just using .5-1 lb of crystal malt or other specialty
grain, you can just add an oz. or two of amylaze enzyme and leave the
wort at 150F for 20 minutes (based on experience this seems to work).
Otherwise, you need to have 50% lager malt (or more pale ale than that)
to provide the appropriate enzymes for starch conversion. (as per
TCHOHB, aka. Miller).


Make quite certain that you get as much grain as possible out before
boosting the temp above 170F, or you will be rewarded with an astringent
taste that takes a long time at cold temps to mellow.


Many people think that It's alright just to steep the grain, and
you're more than welcome to disagree with me.  It certainly 
doesn't ruin the beer if you do (steep the grain).

It depends upon the yeast.  I sucessfully fermented my first all-grain
batch at 33F in my fridge, using Wyeast Munich Lager yeast.  I took
it our after 3 months, and the SG had fropped from 1.077 to 1.027.
I let sit sit a room temp another week, and it dropped to 1.020.


BTW, the sparge got stuck, I broke my putter trying to get it unstuck,
a lot of husk material made it though the grain bed, and I only wound
up with 3 gal of 1.077 wort from 15 lbs of grain.  I added polyclar towards
the end of the primary (in the fridge) to help settle out the tannins,
and it probably was one of the best beers I've ever made :-)


Other lager yeasts don't like it that cold, I guess...

Subject: Ale Yeast




In the last week I have brewed a Cherry-Honey-Weiss beer from grain.
My recipe looks like this:


6# 2 Row English Pale Malt
4# Malted Wheat
Gypsum (for adjusting PH)
Irish Moss (Clarity)
10.5# Cherries
1# Honey
1 oz Saaz Hops - Boiling
1/4 oz Saaz Hops - Finishing


 I mashed using 10 qts at 140 F strike heat for a protein rest at 130 F.
Then added an additional 5 qts at 200 F to bring to a starch conversion
at 150 F raised to 158 F, with a mash-out at 168 F. Sparged with 5 gallons
of water at 168 F recovering over 6.5 - 7 gallons. Boiled for two hours.
Chilled down to about 70 F, pitched yeast. OG=1.040 at 70F. After two
days FG=1.060 and still bubbling. I racked off the trub (a little late
granted) onto 10.5# of frozen/macerated cherries. In addition, I added
1# of honey (boiled with about 1 pint of water). After this point, I saw
no more activity w.r.t. fermentation. I tried adding some yeast energizer
and extra packet of dried yeast with no success. I believe at least two things
could have happened:


1. The frozen cherries chilled the fermenting liquid down to a temperature
level below that where ale is productive or active.


2. The freezing of cherries does not thoroughly eliminate the bacteria and wild 
yeasts that I had tried to freeze out.




I had sampled some opinion from several people on the digest and many said that
freezing the fruit is an effective means of killing the un-wanteds. Has
anybody else got any experience or advice?  The batch does not taste bad 
although the cherry taste is none to prominent.

PS; I must say that these whole grain batches sure make me enjoy extract brewing
since I finished this one at 3:15 am. I slept happily though.

Subject: re: Oats


In digest #919, Russ talks about brewing with Oats and Flaked Barey and
Wheat. Russ, I'd like a slight clarification regarding your treatment of
oats.  Are you saying that oats, such as Old-Fashioned Quaker
Oats, should be boiled prior to mashing?


My understanding was that flaked grains were pressed between
hot rollers which ends up cooking the grain.  As a result, flaked
barley does not need special treatment prior to the mash.  I.e.,
just add it along with the rest of the dried grains.


I'm not a true stout drinker but my girlfriend is.  So I've been
trying to make a good oatmeal stout.  I used 1 lb. uncooked
Quaker Quick Oats last time.  It imparted little (no?) flavor
or character to the beer.  This time I used 1 lb. Quaker Old-Fashioned
Oats which had been cooked to a nice gelatinous goo.  Am I on the
right track or would you suggest I do it differently?  Also is
this the right choice for oats, i.e., Old-Fashioned Oats?

In Australia there is a product used in the food and hotel industry 
called "Stag" which is used for caulking, sealing, etc. It is non-toxic
but should be kept away from naked flames.  I have used it to seal around
the tap of my fermenter (plastic). It doesn't affect the taste, it works,
and its not expensive.  Its normally available in a tube weighing about 
100 grams.

Howdy,


Once before, a long time ago, I had enquired about how one goes about
rousing yeast.  The response I received suggested vigorous agitation
of the brew for several minutes.


Alas, Monday night I finally admitted to myself that my fermentation
had stuck & tried this method out with no success.


Is the agitation supposed to introduce oxygen?  I hated the idea of
stirring up all that gack on the bottom, would racking violently be
a better alternative?  Please help, I hate wallowing in ignorance :(

I normally use fresh fruit, purchased at farmer's markets, but
got a good deal on some canned cherries designed for pie filling.
There are no food colorings, preservatives, or additives in these
cans, just cherries and sugar.  I presume there isn't too much
sugar since they are supposed to be sour cherries for a sour
cherry pie.


So, I am really tempted to use these to make a cherry weizen, but
want at least some sort of "I tried this and it turned out OK"

Subject: kegging




Kegged beer will of course keep just as long if not longer at room 
temperature as bottled beer.  Crown caps leak; a well-sealed keg
does not and this is why the kegged beer may keep longer.


The notion that o-rings from a used soda keg must be replaced because
the soda syrup has impregnated the rubber is a myth for the most part.
Sugars and flavor components will come out or off of the o-rings simply
by soaking in water.  The only way in which these things would be
permanently impregnated is if there were some actual chemical bonding
between the rubber and the stuff.  this seems most unlikely.


Additionally, since the o-rings are not in contact with the beer then
the idea that even some minute residual odor will destroy the flavor
profile of a malty beer seems very unlikely.

Subject: raspberry beer


Greetings,


The raspberries here (WI) are near ripe, and the time has come to formulate a 
recipe to utilize them. I'm not looking to make a framboise lambic, just a
good raspberry beer. I've seen a few good recipes in CM2 and pretty much know
whats going into it, but my concern is when to add the fresh fruit? There seem
to be a few schools of thought here:


1) add the fruit (pureed, whatever) at the end of the boil, steep 'em for 
   x minutes, dump everything in the primary.


2) add the fruit to the secondary.


3) both, ~75% primary, ~25% secondary.


If you add the fruit to the end of the boil, won't you lose a lot of the 
aromatics, and won't most of its sweetness ferment out in the primary? And if 
you add to the secondary, how do you "sanitize" fresh fruit? Is "sanitized"
fruit even a concern in the secondary, since the yeast already has a strong 
foothold _and_ alcohol is present?


And last of all, am I the 100th posting? ;->  :-D  d8=


If any of you (and I'm sure there are) have made fruit beers, clue me in. I 
have fantasized about raspberry beer all year. If I can get enough berries, I
also plan on also doing a mead (melomel) using them. Post here or reply 
personal, your choice. Thanks much.


I'll let you all know how it turns out.

I question the wisdom of using even a weak bleach solution to sanitize
stainless steel kegs, as suggested by alan Richter. Chlorine will corode
stainless if left in contact long enough. If you're meticulous about

Iodophor, a commercial, iodine-basaed sanitizer taht works on contact.

Subject: adjunct grains & mashing


The purpose of mashing in all-grain brewing is starch conversion.  That is,
the starches and other large molecules in the barley malt are converted
by enzymes in the barley malt to fermentable and unfermentable sugars.


Most (unmalted) adjunct grains must first be simmered or cooked until
they are "gelatinized."  If you can find adjunct grains in flaked form,
they are already gelatinized.  I've found flaked wheat, flaked rye, flaked
barley, and flaked maize at either homebrew shops or health food sections
of grocery stores.  


The gelatinized cereal or the flaked grain is added to the mash.  You're
relying on the "enzyme power" in the barley malt to convert not only the
barley malt's starches but also the adjunct's starches.  Thus, someone
on HBD advised a "mini-mash."  Some brewers first perform a protein 
rest at 122 to 131 degrees F for 30 to 45 minutes with the adjunct grains
added at mash-in before boosting to starch conversion temperature in the
low 150s.


"Specialty grains" include crystal malt, chocolate malt, black patent
malt, and (unmalted) roasted barley.  Crystal malt is already converted.
The dark malts are used for their flavor, aroma, and color properties.
Thus, some brewers add specialty grains at mash out.  Because they don't
need to be converted, extract brewers can crack and steep the specialty
grains in water, strain the grains from the water, and proceed with their
brew.

Subject: Campden Tablets


I recently made a mead in which I wanted to keep as much of the honey aroma as
possible.  I therefore used sulfite (campden tablets) rather than boiling
to keep the nice honey aroma.  Unfortunately, I looked at a wine book that 
suggested 2 tablets per gallon for the initialial sulfiting of the "must". 


Well, this was too much for the mead, as it killed several pitchings of 
yeast.  Finally, I ended up boiling the mead anyway to try to drive off some
of the SO2.  After 2 more yeast pitchings, it took off and has been fermenting
just fine for several weeks now.  If anyone else wants too use sulfite to keep
the volatiles in the mead, I STRONGLY suggest no more than one tablet per 
gallon.


Now my question: In the Lambic book by Guinard, he talks about certain sulfite
concentrations for sanitizing barrels, etc.  Since I don't have an accurate
scale available to me, I was wondering if anyone knew the approximate sulfite
concentration when one Campden tablet is dissolved in 1 gallon of liquid?


OK, I admit it, I really do want to know the answer to my question, but the
timing of the request is a blatent attempt at winning a malt mill, since I'm
thinking about buying one anyway...

I have kegged three of my batches to date.  I don't add priming
sugar.  Instead, I siphon the beer into the keg, seal it and add
CO2.  I crank the pressure up to 25psi or so, invert the keg, and
occasionally give it a good shake.  I reach drinkable carbonation
levels within a day.  


Does anybody think that priming (natural carbonation) is a better
way to go than forced carbonation?

I keep a plastic canister of dried malt extract around for many of reasons, 
such as for adding a little to a recipe to boost the OG, but I mainly keep 
it for the the purposes of making a starter solution for a yeast culture.  
The DME is much more easy to deal with than liquid and keeps a loooonnnnggg 
time if it is sealed.  Tupperware (TM) works well for the purpose.  You can
measure with a measuring cup, estimating the weight or actually weighing it
on a scale.  I just "guesstimate" and seem to have good results.


You mighe want to give DME a try.

TCJOHB (revised) and it turned out great. I ended up going out of town at
the end of the primary and decided to rack it into the carboy for a week

Subject: Clove taste and warm kegs.


Greetings,
        I have had experience with clove flavors in my beers.  Bad experience,
actually.  I found that using old plastic fermenters (no matter how well
santized) and long (at least two weeks), high temperature (higher than 70 F) 
ferments, I got a clove-like flavor whether I liked it or not.  I usually used
Edme ale yeast.  When I switched to glass and cooler fermenting it went away
(even with the same yeast).  Of course, it might be due to the local wild 
yeast, so it may not happen to everyone.
        On to the subject of warm kegs.  I don't keg very often, but I have 
a soda keg of ale in my basement from last fall (I know I should be drinking
more--it's a side effect of the late stages of grad school).  I did tap it last
fall but just didn't finish it, so it has been kept at 60-70 F since then.  I
do occasionally tap it and drink some.  It still tastes fine to me (and my 
friends).  I do sanitize my kegs very carefully and dispense
beer with CO2 (essential if you want it to last more than a day).  
That's just my data point.


                G'day,

Steve Kennedy aske why you need other grains when mashing oats.


There are no enzymes in oats. You need the grain to supply these enzymes in
order to convert the starch into sugar. The only way to get around this would
be to use some enzyme extract, like koji, to convert the oat starch. If you
have a local supplier of such an extract, try it. Otherwise just follow the 1
to 1 recipe I stated previously. When I was doing extracts I would mash all my
specialty grains with the oats so my mini-mash looked like this:


1lb oats
 .5lb roasted
 .5lb black patent
2lb 2 or 6 row
1 to 1.5 gallon water
bring mash to 155 degrees and hold for 1 hour. Pour grains into colander and
rinse with an equal amount of water at 170 degrees. Add extract to this liquid
and bring to maximum volume for your kettle for the boil.


I never found the contribution of fermentables from such an oat mash to be
significant enough to alter the basic extract recipe. My stouts tend to hang
around the 1.055 - 1.060 range so I would target the lower number based on the
extract and take the mash sugar as "gravy".


There may be no advantage to "mashing" specialty grains when used with
extracts, however I never liked the idea of adding specialty grains to the
kettle and then fishing them out prior to adding the extract. I knew I wouldn't
be able to remove all the grains and don't like boiling them. I always steeped
my specialty grains in 150+ degree water for 30 minutes or so then rinsed them
into the kettle. Doing the actual mashing was a painless step to take and just
added another 30 minutes to my session.


I have never tried diastatic syrup so I can't speak to its benefits. If "pale
malt" (as in British Pale) is to be your adjunct you shouldn't need the DMS as
pale malt will supply sufficient enzymes to mash itself.


On another topic:


Douglas DeMers talks about his "bitter dregs" and says:


>Additional 1 gallon of sparge was prepared when gravity of runnings
>was so high.  Even after an addition gallon of sparge, the runnings
>were high, IMO.  The little red worms in the compost heap were happy,
>though!  Next time, I'll use more gypsum to bring the ph down to 5.7!


Your recipe calls for 1 lb of Black Patent in a 5 gallon batch. I'd expect your
pH to be too low as a result of the black malt, not too high. You quote a
reading of 5.0 at your initial rest of 135 degrees so it sounds like calcium
carbonate would be the "drug of choice" here rather than gypsum. Regardless 5.0
is certainly an acceptable level. What does the pH have to do with high final
runnings? It sounds like you got ample conversion. Wouldn't high final runnings
be a result of a too quick sparge rather than chemistry?


And, Russ Gelinas (the other Russ) says:


>An easy way to remember which keg fitting (2 pins or 3 pins)
>goes with which dip tube (co2 or liquid) is to think that the
>beer tube is "more important", and so has a higher number of pins


The liquid tube is also LONGER and so the association with a LARGER number of
pins works as well.(;-)

Subject: mashing oats




Oats have no diastatic capacity; they can't starch-convert themselves.
The process of mashing is more than just getting the grain hot and wet.
Barley and wheat (and maybe rye) contain lots of amylase enzymes that
become active at mash temperatures.  The enzymes break the starches
down to simpler sugars that are fermentable (and taste sweet).

/-/ello,


        A few beginner's questions, please.


        Four weeks ago, I put my first batch of "ale" (John Bull Amber
   extract + Wyeast #2112; yes, a weird combo) into bottles.  I put 12
   bottles in the refrigerator at 35-40 degrees F and kept the rest in
   the basement at 65-75 degrees F.


        Did I make a mistake by putting the 12 bottles in the fridge?
   Will any secondary fermentation have taken place in the fridge?  In
   general, does it matter what temperature ales are kept at after
   being bottled?  If I did make a mistake with the 12 bottles, can it
   be corrected now, 4 weeks later?


        How long, in general, must ales stay in the bottles before
   they become drinkable?


        I think I'll try a bottle from the basement first.


        Thank you for any information.

Yes.  Using the procedure you describe, they will not contribute any
significant sugars to the wort, whereas they will if you mash them.
As for the amount they (ideally) contribute, Miller has a table
in TCHoHB listing figures for various grains, though most people
only acheive 80%-90% of the ideal.

Just put saran wrap over it, and store it in a cool place, or
seal it in an air-tight container.  Mold will probably develop
on the surface over the period of a few months.  Just skim off
the mold before using it, and/or strain out the chunks that make
it into the boil.


As for measuring it, I have an old can that had 3.3 lb of extract
in it, and I just guesstimate.


If you warm the extract, it becomes less viscuous.

If you add amylase enzyme to the wort and keep it at 150F for
10-20 minutes, the tendency to boil over is reduced (It's on
par with all-grain batches).

Hey Gang!  A couple of quick questions for you all.


1)  Does anyone have a good recipe for Blueberry beer?  There is a local
contest coming up that features fruit beers, and I would like to brew one
up.  An all grain recipe is preferable, but a good extract recipe would be ok.


2)  I keg my beer using soda kegs, and I also ferment in soda kegs.  I recently
finished a ferment and discovered that I could not clean all of the crud
(left behind) off of the keg using a 24hour soak in TSP followed by a sponge
bath.  The sponge that I was using had one of those green abrasive pads on
it so I used it.  It cleaned the stuff off without any troubles at all.
However, after examining the inside of the keg, I could see patchy sections
of small scratches where I used the pad.  The scratches are definitely small
(I can't feel them with my finger, or finger nail).  But, I was concerned that
these may be a place that little nasties may take up residence and trash the
next brew I ferment in this keg.  Does anyone have any idea if I really need
to be concerned about this?  If it is a problem, can I fix the keg (steel
wool - very fine grade maybe)?  Hopefully the scratches simply indicate an
area where the surface 'polish' is different....

Oatmeal and steel-cut oats do not contain amylase enzyme, which is
necessary to convert the starchy oats into sugars.  Lager malt
is a good source of amylase, or you can add diastatic malt syrup
or supply the enzyme from a refined source.  The advantage of the
lager malt is that the husk material forms a grain bed which will
act as a filter when you sparge.  Ale malt will work also, but 
is not quite as high in enzyme content.


More On Diastatic Malt Syrup:

Pale malt is not an adjunct.  (Most) anything that is malted supplies amylaze
enzyme, anything that has not been malted doesn't, and is callled an adjunct.
Other than the terminology, you're on the right track.

        Old-established brewery in Wilkes-Barre, Penn.  Products 
        include _Stegmaier 1857_ (**), a super-premium lager with a
        hint of new-mown hay in the nose and a hoppy finish, and 
        _Stegmaier Porter_ (**->***), once said to contain licorice
        which it no longer does, but still tastes of it (a small
        proportion of molasses is used, perhaps that is the tang?).
        The brewery has also produced a cherry beer, an oatbran lager
        (for the health-freak market), and a gin-flavored malt
        liquor, _Sting Ray_.
