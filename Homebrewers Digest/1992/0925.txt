As a fairly new keg user I thought I would add my $0.02 worth about kegs and 
kegging.


I now have 4 soda kegs and use them for both primary and secondary fermentation.
In two of the kegs I have short (~1 in) copper caps on the bottom of the pick-up
tubes, the caps keep me from pulling up alot of yeast from the bottom of the 
keg, these are my primary tanks. After three to five days in the primary I 
transfer to the secondary and let the beer ferment out. In both the primary and 
secordary I use blow off hoses.  I then prime with corn suger as usual and let 
it condition as needed. I have let stouts condition up to 6 months without any 
refrigeration. Kegs should work just like bottles, if properly sealed and 
unopened they can last for months with no problems.  If you want to force 
carbonation or counter-pressure bottle you must to have a refrigerator, the beer
must be cold (30-40 degF) in order the get the co2 into the beer. I just pick-up
a good used regfrigerator for $ 25, it is not pretty but work just fine.  Last 
winter I just kept my drinking kegs in the garage and they stayed about the 
right temperature for drinking but with the warmer weather this no longer works.
I do not filter my beer yet but  I would like to add this option, as I 
understand it is quite simple to construct a filter using a water type filter 
housing and 0.5 micron filter. There are a number of very good articles in 
Zymurgy about most of this stuff, if you anyone wants these e-mail me and I'll 
pass on the info. A last piont about tanks my first tank was a 2.5 lb tank and I
got two or three batches out of one fill, this included transfering, drinking 
and cleaning. I bought this tank used with a current hydro-test ( all co2 tanks 
must have current hydro-testing to be filled) for $ 30 for a fire e, I just got 
a 20 lb tank for $20 from a scrap guy but it must be hydro-test at a cost of 
about $20 before I can fill it. 


In short I love my kegs and my total cost so far I only have less than $ 150 in 
the whole set-up including the refrigerator.

Subject:      Re: HBD 920




Greetings all,
  In #920 Craig Vandeventer asks about the need for adjusting the pH of sparge
water.
  Craig, this has, as I recall, been previously discussed on the digest, and
is also covered in some of the homebrewing books, Miller in particular.  The
basic reason for adjusting the pH of your sparge water is to avoid extracting
tannins from the malt husks, especially as you near the end of the sparge and
the pH of the naturally rises.  With a significant portion of dark roasted
malt in the grist this probably won't be a problem, but is definitely a
concern with paler beers.  The tannins, if extracted, will impart some rather
harsh and astringent notes to your beer.


  Also in #920, Phil Calvin DoD #242, asks a load of questions.  Among them
are: What is a cold break?  Hot break?
  This is something akin to beating a dead horse, given the extended
discussion that went on not too long ago.  Be that as it may, the short
answers are that hot break is the proteins which become insoluble during the
wort boil, the ones which make up the trub in the bottom of your kettle, and
cold break is the proteins that become insoluble during wort chilling, the
ones which end up in the bottom of your fermenter (assuming that you didn't
run the hot break through the chiller).  Since this we've been around the
block on this one several times recently, if anyone wants to pick nits on my
simple descriptions please do so via private e-mail.


  And lastly, also in #920, Bryan Gros asks about mashing specialty malts, and
about working with the various types of oats out there.
  Bryan, I think that if you ask two homebrewers about whether or not you
should mash specialty malts you will probably get at least three opinions.
For what its worth, my opinion is that if you are doing at least a partial
mash already, you should include the specialty malts in the mash.  Some of
these malts may still contain some starch, which the mash should convert.
Even when that isn't the case, I think that the end result is a better
marriage of malt flavors if the whole bill of goods is mashed together.  For
extract brews, with no mashing involved, you probably should just R,DW,HAH.
  As to the oats, Quaker oats (at least their oatmeal) are simply rolled oats
with a brand name.  I don't think that steel cut oats have been rolled, and
don't know what the hell milled oats are.  Any rolled oats, branded or
generic, can be added directly to your mash as their starch has already been
gelatinized by the rolling process.  With the steel cut oats you should
probably cook them first to gelatinize the starch and make it amenable to
enzymatic conversion in the mash kettle.  Since the starch in the rolled oats
has already been gelatinized, they would be the best choice, unless for some
strange reason you want to extend the amount of time it takes you to
accomplish your mash.

You will have to figure the storage pressure by trial and error.  40psi
at 50f will give you 4.5 volumes of CO2 - explosive by any measure!


If you have a british style beer you want ~2 volumes.  At 50f
the equilibium pressure is 12lb  I store and deliver my beers at 48f and
around 15-18lb.  A little fizzy for english, a little flat for german.
No big, I just pour from a great height to kill the carbonation.  It 
mostly works out in the end.  For german beers you want around 2.5-3
volumes which works out to 18-24psi.


The table I am working from comes in the fall 1990 Beverage Peoples News.
Their info line is 1-707-544-2520 (greater fermentations of Santa Rosa).
Perhaps they can give you a back copy?  It also has a good discussion of
force carbonating your beer.


Cheers!

Subject: Fridge thermostats


Roger suggests using the Honeywell thermostat for converting a fridge
to our temerature range.  I put forth that a Hunter AirStat or
Hunter Energy Miser (?) window air-conditioner thermostats are much
easier to use and are cheaper.  I paid $24.95 for mine at Builder's
Square.  It plugs into the wall outlet, the fridge (or in my case
chest freezer) plugs into the outlet on the front of the unit and
a remote sensor is at the end of a ~3 foot plastic covered wire.
No cutting of wires needed.  A different Builder's Square in my area
charges $29.95 for the same unit -- I was told it was because that
store suffers from a lot of shoplifting.  If you live in Anchorage,
and window air conditioners are foreign to your area, ask your hardware
store owner to order it from Hunter (the ceiling fan people) and make
sure you get the model that has the outlet on the front (the window
air-conditioner model).

Subject: re: seeking Heineken-like beer


Someone asked for a recipe to get a Heineken-like beer.
A favorite of my friends is recipe based on the Complete Joy of
Homebrewing's  "Dutch Pilsener" recipe in the partial mash
Section (intermediate section?). Sorry, I don't have the recipe
in the right form since I am at work but from memory I substitute 
Alexander's Pale extract for his extract and use Wyeast Danish Lager
or Wyeast European Lager (which I prefer). However, I don't
make it as real lager since I do it in the dead of winter with
my 60 degree basement. Finally, I found a hopping pattern of using
half the suggested bittering hops with 15 minutes to go rather than
all at the beginning of the boil gives a better flavor.


I made this several times and recommend especially for those wanting
to go from extract to all-grain but are prefer to play it safe. Partial
mashing is a good way to make the transition.

I think the problem I had was that this was industrial beer being
dispensed continuously from a rented (grungy lines) jockeybox.  I still
believe, though, that the pressure would have to be pretty high to get the
CO2 to dissolve into the beer in the keg which is at, say 68F.  This
would be much too high a pressure for dispensing the beer.  Even
if the beer got to spend a few hours at 50F, so much of the dissolved CO2
would stay in solution when the beer finally came out of the faucet,
the pressure drop may still cause it to foam a lot.  That was my
hypothesis regrding the situation presented.

I do advocate minimizing the introduction of oxygen after fermentation

I have wondered about this myself.  Does anyone have an
explanation for it?  Considering that your bottled beer will last
a year at basement temps just fine, why shouldn't a keg do the
same?  Is it because air gets in when you tap the keg?  Or do
just microorganisms get in?  Or what?


Well, if your sanitation is good, it should not *spoil* whether in
bottles or kegs, however, the flavor and primarily the nose suffer
more at 70F than at 50F.

 I have a better idea, send me the Kitchenaid and I will do a review.  I have

 As a point of interest, I offered to swap a MALTMILL for one of those Italian

 Of course the same offer applies to your Kitchenaide :)

 I think it is, "Or what?"  Which of course translates to MOMILY.
 
 There clearly is no difference other than scale.
 
 However, the recurrent use of the terms "air" and "oxygen" could be clues.  
 Neither can get into a properly sealed and stored keg.  
 
 It may not be obvious to the casual reader but the use of hand pumps on party 
 kegs is one reason kegs, so abused, go bad.  The hand pump obviously pumps 
 air into the keg which guarantees oxidation and limits the drinkable life to 
 weeks if not days.

Subject: Re: adjusting pH of sparge


Craig asks "why adjust the pH of the sparge water?"


The reason for this is that high pH water tends to extract more
astringent flavors from the husks of the grains.  Lowering the
pH (making the sparge water more acidic) will extract less of
these undesirable flavors.

Hi all,
                This past weekend, while brewing up a festbier, my brewing
        partner and I conducted a side-by-side comparison of the older,
        contract-brewed by Catamount version of Frank Jones, and the new,
        brewed in Portsmouth version.
                It seemed to both of us that the older version had both
        slightly more hop bitterness, and slightly more hop flavor.  It 
        (the older version) also seemed just a bit lighter in color.  Does
        anyone know if Frank Jones changed the recipe?  Has anyone else
        noticed the difference??
                
                BTW, this change will not dissuade me from drinking and        
        enjoying Frank Jones.  IMHO, still a fine beer, even if it is

Subject: RE:  Strawberries, Pectic Enzyme


I have brewed 3 or 4 batches of strawberry ale, and have had pretty good
results of the last two.  I would recommend adding the strawberries around
the same time you would dry hop, after most fermentation has subsided, to
reduce "scrubbing" of the volatile strawberry essence.  The little sugar that
is present in the fruit may be enough to affect carbonation, so I would
let the fermentation go at least a few more days.  You can add the berries
to the primary, but definitely rack after a few days.  I wouldn't recommend
adding the fruit just before bottling.  Pectic enzyme works very well to
reduce the pectin haze caused by heat pasteurization, which I would strongly
recommend you do.  I use 1/2 Tablespoon per gallon, and it worked so well
and so quickly that you could probably cut back to half that.  The stuff works
in less than 24 hours.  


I forgot one other thing:  I use about 1.5 lbs./gallon of beer, and end up
with an awesome pink-amber color, strong strawberry nose and finish, and a
mild strawberry flavor.  Tastes best after it is allowed to warm up a bit
out of the fridge.  Good luck with it!

Subject: partial mash questions...






Query for the collective consceincousness of the HBD.  I have been doing
partial mashes for the last 6 or so batches (2-4 lbs of grain in a gallon
or so of water).  One of these days I'll have the money to take it full
scale, but until such a time I have a question about my sparge method.


My current method is to mash the grains in my 5 gallon brew pot for about
one hour at 150-155 degrees.  Meanwhile I bring another gallon or so of
water to about 185 degrees in the 3gal pot and then put this into the 
bottling bucket.  Next I pour the wort through my spagettii strainer,
which is covered with cheese cloth and supended above the 3 gal pot.
After pouring throut the strainer, I move it (now full of grains) to
the 5 gallon pot and pour the wort through the grain bed again, in the
hopes that a nice filter bed has been set. Next I pour the water from
the bottling bucket (while has by now drop to about 170) slowly through
the grains.  Sometimes I place a small dish in the center of the grains
so the water does not disturb the grain bed.


What concerns me is that the wort drips down from the strainer to the 
kettle bottom.  Will this do anything other than possibly darken the
wort?  Can anyone suggest improvements to my methods? If I decided to
try an all grain bach could I split my boil between the 5 and 3 gallon
kettles?


I figure to do 5 gallons all grain I need a better sparge system, a
7-10gallon kettle ( owch! $$$), and of course (let this be #100) a
MALTMILL or the likes.  Does anyone out there have an opinion on the
Phil's Sparge sysstem, or any other ready made spargers?  Are you
just plain better off making your own?


I've rambled enough,
Walter

Subject: Maltmill Contest




It's not hard to count the number of posts since Jack's Contest Offer. As of
the end of digest #920 I counted 70 posts. Now, what's to keep me from 
writing a little com file that sends 30 copies of 


"Do I Win?"


That should give me a pretty good shot at it. I guess the only thing that
would keep me from doing that is the shame of such a desperate attempt
to win a MaltMill when I don't even mill my own grain anyway. Of course
If I did have a mill I probably would mill my own grain... Hmmm.


Note also that the last three digests had 15, 23, and 32 messages in that
order. So I predict that this digest (Friday #921) will contain the winner!


See Ya

Subject: Mendicino Brewing Company's 4th of July Picnic




Phoebe Couch's post about the 4th of July festivities reminds me of my
trip up there. I got married last year on the 6th of July in Santa Rosa.
I didn't really want to have a traditional get-wasted-and-watch-women-
take-off-their-cloths batchelor party so a bunch of friends and i rented
a van and a driver and headed up there. 


We missed most of the festivities during the day but were there for the
end of the BBQ and for the band in the evening. I hadn't seen most of my
California friends for a while so we spent most of the evening sampling
various pitchers and yacking it up. As the evening got cooler everyone
moved inside except us and one other couple who ended up having sex on
the picnic table next to us. So my question is: was that just a special
floor show the brewery put on for us that night or is that typical of
the Mendicino Brewing Company?


Sure brings back memories - but only up to an uncertain point in the evening!

You might try Keg Systems Plus, 2802 E. Madison St. #165, Seattle, WA 98112
(206) 322-2037.  He advertises in Zymurgy regularly.  I've bought several
items from him, and my wife bought a nifty jockeybox for me for Christmas.
(Double Tap Stainless Steel Cold  $229.  A little pricey, but it's pretty
efficient.  Doesn't require nearly the ice as a coil system.)  Used 20 lb
tanks go for $67.  Unfortunately, he doesn't sell used 5 lb.  You might
also try welding supply houses, and even the classifieds under building
equipment.


A used tank is the only way to go. The welding supply store where I get
my gas doesn't refill your tank when you take it in.  They just exchange
it for another tank that is full.  It saves them a lot of time doing it
that way.  5 lbs will probably be fine with only two kegs.  I've got
3 five gallons and 5 three gallons, and I have been able to survive with
just 5 lbs, but I am seriously considering adding a 20 lb tank.  It seems
like I always run out of gas just before a party or brew-club meeting.




Kevin asks:

I don't have any long term experience, but I've kept kegs in my garage
(which probably ranges from 60-80 degrees) for a couple of months with
no noticable degradation in quality.  (I bought another refer at a
garage sale to take care of the problem, but the damn thing won't work.
Anyone want to recharge my refrigerator in exchange for some beer or
cider?)
These have been mostly ales, but several of them have been filtered (no
yeast to protect them), and still have survived a month or so at room
temperature.  (It probably helps that they're under pressure.)




Charlie (me) asks:


If I can talk my wife into a road trip, does anybody have any suggestions
on where to stay in Portland this coming Friday and Saturday?  Something
close to the festival, clean, and if possible a pool (can be VERY small,
but my 2-1/2 year old twins won't be very happy after the 3 hour drive, so
I will need something to get them to lighten up).


Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Adding more honey won't necessarily work. Honey is very fermentable.
That means that you end up with very few unfermentable sugars left 
when it is done. Doubling the amount of honey used will double the
unfermentable sugars but will that really make a difference? To get
more body you really have to add enough honey that the alcohol level
gets high enough that the yeast stops working and you have 
_unfermented_ honey left over. Using a low-attenuating yeast will
help but you'll never get a 'quick' mead that way. Be careful with
sanitizing bottles too. Any unfermented sugar means danger of bottle
bombs!

I think some of the confusion here is because people forget (3).


3. Immersion -- run hot wort though a coil of tubing which is
immersed in a bath of cold water.


I started out using (3) but found that I had some problems with
blockage of the tubing by hops - especially hop pellets. Other than
that the technique works great. You get most of the advantages of
a counter-flow chiller without all the plumbing and yet you don't
have to use as much water as you do with (1). 


All that not withstanding a blocked chiller is a really difficult
thing to unclog so I converted my (#3) to a (#1) by ataching fittings
to connect it to a garden hose. (This also went along with my move
from the kitchen to the garage for brewing.)


I don't have any suggestions on how to clear up the ambiguity of
what gets immersed in what but let's not jump on someone for being
stupid (as some - not the above poster) have done.

P.S. I was wrong about HBD #921. It only had 25 messages which brings
the total to 95. It will be #922 for sure :-) Also I'm relieved that
I can post stuff without looking like I'm out for a grain mill. I'm
sure I won't be in the first 5 tomorrow. It just happens to be 
Friday afternoon on a slow day and I happened to have 7 digests
backed up in my mail directory.

There are two New Mexico brew clubs that I know about. The one in
Albuquerque is called the Dukes of Ale. (Albuquerque is nick-named
the Duke City for some strange reason.) They can be reached (among
other ways) by calling Dan Baughman. He should be in the phone book.


The other one is the Los Alamos Hill Hoppers. We are obviously in
Los Alamos. Probably a bit of a haul to come up here to drink beer
but you can get sample copies of our newsletter by writing to
Mike Hall (editor) at "hall`at`lanl.gov".


If anyone knows about other New Mexico brew clubs let me know so
we can get in touch.

Subject: Hops question


             I ordered some Willamette Hops from a brand-new homebrew supply
        shop that opened in Manhattan [Yea!!! Now Manhattan has TWO (yes, 2)
        shops! ].  I used the hops today when making Rocky Raccoon's Honey
        Lager (more or less, from TCJOHB).  The hops were from a distributor
        called Wines, Inc.  The hops appeared to be in detiorated condition
        (leaves not attached to cones, lots of loose yellow powder I'm 
        interpreting as lupulin) and there was foreign material present
        (darker green leaves and stems).  The foreign material appeared
        homogeneous as I watched it toil and boil in my wort. 
        
        My question is:


        Is this foreign material hops vine and leaf as I suspect, was it 
        harmful to my beer and has anyone had this experience?

Subject: Belgian caramel malts


     The latest installment to the Association of Brewer's Classic Beer
Styles Series, Belgian Ale by Pierre Rajotte, makes a brief yet
informative reference to a few of the new Belgian malts that are now
available to homebrewers in the US:


     ". . . Carapils (10 to 20 EBC, 4 to 8 L) gives added body to light
colored beers and is used mainly in Pilsener brewing.  Caravienne (30 to
60 EBC, 12 to 23 L) is used in the brewing of lighter colored Specials
and Abbey type beers.  Caramunich or crystal malt (140 to 160 EBC, 53 to
60 L) has a definite coloring effect.  Finally, Special B is a highly
colored caramel malt of 300 to 500 EBC (113 to 188 L) and gives a rich
caramel-malt taste.  It is used in Scotch ales and stouts brewed under
license in Belgium.  Darker Specials and Abbey beers at times use this
type of caramel malt.  Its effect is noticeable in beers, giving lots of
additional body and coloring.  Beers using Special B have more
well-rounded malt character than beers colored with only "candi" sugar. .
 . ."


     Those of you who have obtained some of this new and wonderful malt
and don't quite know what to do with it (like me) now have some direction
towards its use.

Subject: SF Brewpubs & Maltmill


Thanks to Nick Cuccia's terrific list of beer establishments in the SF
Bay area, I had a terrific visit there last week.
 
Got to Pacific Coast Brewing Co. in Oakland (marvelous atmosphere, 
good food, only average house beers but a fabulous selection on tap); 
Buffalo Bill's in Hayward (what can I say -- a classic and good, well-
balanced beers with character); Gordon Biersch in Palo Alto (nice 
place, a bit pricey, and good average beers); Twenty Tank Brewery in 
San Francisco (a real dive, but again good food and pretty good beer.  
Also a very friendly and informative assistant brewmaster on hand).  
Tried the Marin Brewing Co. in Larkspur, but got there while they were 
closed for the holiday.  Looked like a fern bar from the window, but I 
hear their beer is good.  What a trip!
 
It got me thinking about how far we've come in just the last five
years.  With this kind of variety (and even the beers I rated as 
average were "head" and shoulders above their big commercial cousins)
our standards are getting higher, too.  Maybe we'll get to be a real
beer country yet.  Does anyone know where the big three candidates 
stand on microbreweries and brewpubs?
 
Also, I would guess that I might have been that 100th buyer of the 
maltmill who gave Jack the idea for the lottery.  I have to admit I was 
skeptical, but after seeing one at the AHA conference last month and 
rereading George Fix's favorable review, I took the plunge.  After one
trial, I'm glad I did -- got an almost perfect crush and improved my
extraction rate.  Usual disclaimers, but thought in fairness I should 
let people have another unbiased opinion.

Subject: FL, OH brewpubs; fruit sanitizing suggestion; maltmill


I will be doing some traveling soon; and was hoping to find some brewpubs in
the Fl panhandle or southern AL (is that redundant?).  If anyone knows some
good spots, send me a message (and I'll post a summary) or post it, what the 
heck.  "S94WELKER`at`USUHSB.BITNET" is my short address.
Second, I have a suggestion for those who hope to sanitize apples for cider...
or any other fruit for brewing.  Blanch them.  This means "dunk in boiling H2O"
for a while.  I think killing off some of the bugs on the surface would give
the yeasties an advantage (and with the other methods suggested, increase the
odds of a large yeast population).  I have used this method for strawberries
which were added to my secondary, and I had no infections.  For apples, 
blanching would have the added advantage of removing wax (added by distribu-
tors) and some of the chemicals (although those are a trivial consideration--
cirrhosis and DUIs are our primary threats).


Finally, I am posting this message at this time because of the maltmill 
shenanigans js is pulling.  I am hoping I will be the big winner so
I can refuse the prize (being a satisfied extract brewer with no plans to
change).  Do you watch ESPN, Jack?  Well, now you won't need to.


While the DC area is devoid of brewpubs, we have a number of bars well-stocked
with microbeers (tops is the Brickskeller; 500+ varieties).  Travelers to our
city (fair it ain't) should definitely see the place and have one of the 7 SN
products, or Dolle Brewers' Bos Keun.

Greetings,


I am looking for a source for a large, stainless brewpot to use for a full
boil.  What size do most people use, 8-10 gallon?  I know I could find
something at a restaurant supply store but it would probably cost over $100.
I think I have read here that some people have used old kegs with the top
cut off.  Is this true?  What kind of kegs are they?  Anybody have any other
ideas for brewpots?  It doesn't have to be pretty but cheap would be nice.

Subject: re: unrefridgerated kegs


In digest #921 Kevin asks about keeping beer in unrefridgerated kegs.  I've been doing
this for about a year now.  The beer keeps well at 65F but its character will
continue to change.  Keeping the beer at 50-55F slows down the maturation process.
Also if you bottle from the keg and then chill the bottled beer it tends to be flat,
since the carbonation level in the warm keg will be much lower than that of the
chilled bottle temp.  Apart from these minor problems you shouldn't have any problems.
The Hunter Air Stat is definitely the way to go.  I've bought the Air Stat I just
haven't gotten 'round to finding a refridgerator.  I just can't wait to carry it up
the stairs:-)
