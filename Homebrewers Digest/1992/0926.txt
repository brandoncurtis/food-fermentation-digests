 At the risk of being commercial, I demonstrate how to make a small batch of

 buy than make.  Perhaps one of the nice people out there who received free

 >Can anyone add to Al's observations on this topic.  I plan to start kegging
 with my next batch of beer.  I don't have a place to keep kegs cold.   I
 do have a small dorm sized refrigerator which I plan to run some tubing
 through.  Effectively the same as a "jockeybox".
 
 I can only add by disagreeing totally.  I have no fridge in my basement and 
 have never refrigerated kegs.  I do not know about your jockey box but I use 
 a "cold plate" which is a stainless tube serpentine imbeded in a cast 
 aluminum plate.  It is about 8 X 12 X 1 and cools beer as fast you I can draw 
 it.  It holds less than two oz of beer and two cups of cubes will chill a 
 couple of glasses.   It sits in the bottom of a plastic dish pan with the tap 
 on top of that.  I brought it to Milwaukee with a keg of you know what.
 
 In my experience, "after chilling" gives the ultimate control in carbonation.  
 No matter what level the carbonation is in the keg, chilling on the way out 
 will force the carbonation to stay in the beer.  It also allows you to 
 maintain a higher CO2 pressure in the keg than could normally be used for 
 dispensing because of the restriction in the plate.
 
 It also makes bottling a snap.  Release the pressure in the keg to just 
 enough to move the beer and foamless, chilled beer runs into the bottle.
 
 The plate is available from any bar supply house.

 >What ale yeast is this?? Did you mean lager yeast. All the Ale yeasts I have
 ever used tend to floculate out and go  dormant when I drop them to cold
 temperatures (like say below 45F), in fact I, and many many brewers

 clarify the beer, it even has a technical name for it, called cold conditioning.
 
 >Care to enlighten us???
 
 Sure.  Most readers didn't need enlightening.  They recognized the error and 
 answered the question.  But some folks just can not ever let an opportunity 
 to be nasty pass.
 
 Obviously, I was talking about lager yeast and the problem I anticipated by 
 storing culture slants.
 
 To try again..... in light of the fact that lager yeast ferments down to 
 freezing, how is it possible to store culture slants in a refrigerator for 
 months without depleting the media.  I am in the habit of tightening the caps 
 on ale yeast culture tubes but this seems like a prescription for disaster 
 with lager yeast.
 
 Now, would you like to try again?

I have found that Beer Distributors have CO2 tanks taps etc. and are


usually very helpful.


I bought a refrigerator conversion kit for $130.00 consisting of:


  5# CO2 tank w/reg
  tap to fit through door
  all hoses & connectors


I have both types of keg hookups Genny type (12 horse Ale)
or Coors type (George Killian's Irish Red) I have a hose clamp
that I can use to change and when I start kegging in Pepsico Kegs
I will just change to that.


I may put a short length of hose and 'Quick disconects' on all of them.

Subject: Counterflow chiller plans, killer sparge gadget


I realize this has been asked before, but, like everyone, I didn't save
the discussion because I didn't need it at the time.


Does anyone have plans they can [e]mail me for a counterflow wort
chiller?  The concept is pretty straightforward, but it isn't obvious
how to build some of the fittings.


Thanks in advance.  As payment, here's a handy tip for you all-grain
brewers out there.


Tonight we just tried out some new lautering hardware that beats the
Zapap lauter tun hands down (Charlie, how could you have lead us astray?
:-).  Build a sparge "manifold" out of 1/2" copper tubing with slits in
it that goes in the bottom of the mash tun.  When you're done mashing,
simply siphon off the sweet wort and pour the sparge water over the top
of the grain.  No need to transfer the mash to another container or
drill holes in you mash pot.


The manifold is made with about 5 feet of tubing, 4 tees, 5 endcaps, one
elbow, and one step-down for matching the size of the plastic hose.  We
mash in a round pot, so it looks something like (attempted silly ASCII
graphics follow):


                                   _
                                   |
                                   +----]
                            [------+
                                   +------]
                              [----+
                                   |
                         90 deg up \========----->to hose


The horizontal arms have 4-6 slots cut in them, 3/4" apart, facing
downward, and sit in the bottom of the tun.  Then the elbow turns up the
side of the tun and connects to the siphoning hose.  Standard copper
fittings are tight enough you don't even have to solder.  Just cut the
pieces of tubing so that the manifold fits snugly in the bottom of your
tun.


It sparges just as well as the Zapap unit, and is easier to use, and
cost only $5 to make.  Oh, make sure you put the manifold into the
tun *before* you add the grain, not after.

Subject: Trub


I just made a batch of beer, and this is the first time I have worried (yes,
I worried!) about letting the trub settle out.  Only problem is that it took
overnight for it to all fall out, even after the wort is completely cooled.
My question is how much damage can be done by letting the stuff sit over-
night to let the trub settle out, then rack to another carboy and pitch the
yeast.  I know there is a significant risk of infection, but I think I can
control for that.  What risks of oxidation or other things exist, and how
much should worry about them?  Does anyone know a better way than I propose?

Subject: Volume Brewers: Any wheat beer recipes?


        A couple of brewers in our homebrew club asked for some help 
in formulating a recipe for a Weizen or Dunkelweizen.  They will be making
a 50 gallon batch, so any tips on doing a sparge with approximately 50 lbs.
of wheat will be very useful.


        Since I am on the subject of Weizens, this style, as well as Alt
and Koelsch beers benefit from a cold lagering during the secondary stage.
Since most ale yeasts are almost dormant at 45 F, would it be beneficial
to innoculate the beer with a lager yeast before the lagering period?  If
anyone has ever tried this, I would be interested in finding out the results.


Happy Brewing,

Subject: Novice brewer needs help


As a novice brewer I have a few questions about home brewing.


1. What are the best sterilsing agents and procedures to use in order to prevent the little airborne nasties infecting my brew.


2. If one brews from commercially available kits and then adds additional driedmalt to the brew (instead of sugar) can you experience problems with the yeast not being capable of fully fermenting the liquor due to high malt content? (if yes - how do you overcome it? )


3. What's with this racking the beer after primary fermentation? In Australia, no one mucks around with this step. I know it is supposed to allow for a much clearer beer but aren't you increasing the chance of infection?  If anyone does use this method with success can you please let me know exactly what steps you go through in terms of sterilisation, when to rack, how long , etc.


4.Does anyone out there have a list of the various hops varieties available and whether their use is suitable for enhancing aroma or bitterness or both?


5. Can anyone give me the address and fax number of zymurgy so that I may subscribe?

Good Morning all,


Just a bit more about silicone caulking.  As I understand it, there
are silicone grades available that are FDA approved for food use.  They 
should handle both the temperature and the pH of the mash.  They will
corrode a copper pipe, however.  The acetic acid released as they cure
is responsible.  Also, when trying to seal a thermoplastic cooler, they
may require a primer to adhere properly.  The primer may not be FDA approved.
Therefore, it is suggested that a mechanical solution be found instead.

Thanks to Nick for the further info.  Also, thanks Russ for
the list of places to shop (and not shop).  Now for the tough
problem.  Suppose I walk into one of these places and there
in front of me is a set of shelves with 50 (ok, I'm dreaming, maybe
20) different local beers.  Which are worth packing up and
bringing back to Wisconson on the airplane?


I have had some of the Anchor and SN products, and I plan on looking
for additional varieties which they don't ship (I found the SN Mai Bock
in Ft. Collins CO.  Very nice.  Almost convinced me to start lagering.).


I have had mixed impressions of the San Andreas Brewing Co's Richter
Scale Ale -- the first year was very good, the last one I had tasted
like orange juice....I think I'll skip them.  I seem to remember
that Devil's Mt. is out of business....too bad, I liked their porter.
I'll get some of the Dead Cat Alley (or what ever they call themselves)
products, but I still have a half of a suitcase left....suggestions?


I am especially interested in varieties which I can buy in less than
6packs -- 10 different 6packs leads to either lots of fat about the
nether regions (and problems walking) or leaving something behind

It sounds to me like the odor was derived from the stocking, but not 
necessarily the nylon itself. The obvious explanation would be your
girlfriend's feet. But since we treat brewing as a science, I feel that
you are now responsible for proving this theory. At your soonest convenience,
please stick her feet in a pot of water and gradually raise the temperature.
Take careful notes as to which temperatures produce the aforementioned odor.
If the odor begans to dissapate as you approach 170'F, then we can safely
say that we have identified the cause. Try not to confuse the smell of the
boiling flesh with the unidentified odor.

My silicone sealant that is manufactured by Dow Corning and marketed by DAP
has this on its label:
        SAFE FOR FOOD CONTACT:  When cured and washed, ingredients
                                which remain or which could migrate
                                to food are listed in FDA Regulation
                                No. 21 CFR 177.2600.
There is also nothing in the Material Safety Data Sheet that would indicate
food contact should be avoided.  I don't have a copy of the FDA regulation,
so I don't know what chemicals are available for migration.  I personally
would not worry about the short term exposure of wort leaching something
poisonous from cured RTV.


Chris Lyons asked about an alternative to chlorine in sanitizers.  I have 
just switched to Iodophor because of a recommendation by George Fix.  In the
recommended concentrations, rinsing is not needed.  I have only used this for
my last batch which is still in the primary, so I can't confirm its efficacy.
Price wise, it if fairly expensive.  I bought a case of 6, 1/2 liter bottles
for about $30, which I figure is a lifetime supply. One quarter fluid ounce
of Iodophor makes 2 1/2 gallons of solution with 12.5 ppm titratable iodine.


I was going to post on my home-made temperature controller for a refrigerator
that used a Hunter programmable thermostat.  The nice thing about it over
the Air-Stat is that the set point can be set lower than 40F.  However, it
is no longer available and the new Hunter thermostats have a "feature" in

Well, my rye zomes really did their thing.  I have hop vines
approaching the gutter from which their support string hangs.


When do the hop cones start showing up?


And yes, some mysterious bug seems to like hops.  Most of the
leaves have holes in them.  I have sprayed twice with malithion
(sp?), but the invisible bug keeps coming back.

Subject:  calculating yield


I have noticed a few questions about converting from dry extract to syrup
or from all grain to extract.  The easiest way to convert SG's is to know
what the yield of each item is and convert.  If a recipe  calls for a SG of
1.050 and one pound of dry malt yields 45 pts/gal = 9 pts/5 gal, you would
need 50/9 = 5.55 lbs of dry malt.  Also if a recipe calls for 7 lbs of
grains which yields about 35 pts/gal (I know this is ideal, but you get
the idea) 7 * 35 = 245pts total, 245/45(pts for dry) = 5.44 lbs of dry
malt.  I know this may be confusing, not the math but the way I have
explained it.


Here are two lists of yields which were posted previously (sorry for

I treat my entire supply water with gypsum (about 1gm/gal). That seems
to acidify the mash and the sparge quite well.  I get excellent extract
yields, but I wouldn't draw the conclusion that my yields are a result
of my sparge water acidification.

Subject:      Jockey Box


I,ve been using a jockey box that I bought from Foxx for several years
now. The trick to pouring beer with a nice creamy head and retaining
a nice level of carbonation is to run the CO2 pressure at 21 lbs.
You need this high level of pressure because your draft lines are very
long. If the pressure is not sufficient, the CO2 escapes from the beer
because there is not enough pressure to keep it in suspension. The CO2
pressure actually drops over the distance that the beer has to travel
and by the time it reaches your tap it's at the proper pressure. A lot
of people mistakenly think that when they have their first tapping
system that if they're getting a lot of foam when pouring a beer that
the pressure is too high - it's just the opposite, it's too low. There
is a formula, which eludes just now, for calculating line pressure but
the standard pressure for 20 to 30 feet of draft line is 21 lbs, start
at this pressure first and then adjust - if still a little too foamy
then raise it a few pounds.
I keg my beer in Cornelious kegs and bottles but the kegged beer tastes
much fresher and the head is always creamier. I have also setup a refrig-
erator system. If anyone has any questions about any of these systems,
I would be happy to answer your questions. I,ve been using these kegging
systems now for almost ten years.


May your beer give you good head!!!

John asks about Wyeast wheat yeast.


I've used this once, fermented at 69F and got no clove character.
I've since spoken to several others who have used it, as well as
a few posts in HBD awhile ago, and the consensus is that you need
to ferment at a higher temperature, say, 75F or 80F to get the clove
character.  Wyeast wheat yeast (#3056, I believe) is a mixture of
S. cerevisiae and S. Delbrueckii.  It's the Delbrueckii that gives
the beer that clove character so necessary for the Bavarian Weizen
style.  It appears, from what I've read and heard, that higher temps
favor the Delbrueckii.

I recently made a batch of Belgian ale using some Belgian malt I ordered
from Liberty.  The malt is distinctly different.


I haven't found Chimay yeast to be slow at all.  In fact, since I
started using better aeration techniques, I've found it to be pretty
snappy.


I am not fond of banana odors in my beer, so I try to keep the 
fermentation temperature below 70 degrees.  I still get a great deal
of that "Belgian" character to the beer.

From: tony`at`spss.com (Tony Babinec)
Subject: brewing your own sierra nevada pale ale


This recipe ought to get you close.  Try it, see how the beer turns out,
and then make changes.


Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, the bottle product, has a starting gravity of
1.052, while Sierra Nevada Draught Ale, the draft product, has an SG of
1.048.  The draft product tastes a bit sweeter, too.  Malts in the grain bill
include pale malt, crystal malt, and dextrine malt (aka cara-pils).  Hops
used are Perle and Cascade.  The yeast is their own, which you can culture
from the bottle or obtain as Wyeast "American" ale.  


So, for a 5-gallon batch, assuming 75% extraction efficiency, try this:


9        pounds U.S. 2-row pale malt
0.5      pounds crystal malt (60L)
0.25-0.5 pounds cara-pils malt


1 ounce Perle (alpha=6.5), 60 minutes until end of boil
0.5 ounce Cascade (alpha=6.3), 15 minutes until end of boil
0.5 ounce Cascade (alpha=6.3), end of boil


Wyeast "American" ale


Mash at starch conversion temperature of 153/5 degrees F.


Comments:  the crystal malt is fairly dark for some color, the cara-pils
is there for added body and sweetness.  But, don't overdo it with the
specialty grains.  The relatively high starch conversion temperature will
promote body and sweetness.  Perles are the signature bittering hop, while
Cascades are for flavor and aroma.  If I remember, SNPA comes in at about
32-35 IBUs, and the above hop schedule should get you in the ballpark.  I
don't believe Chico dry-hops SNPA, but go ahead if you so desire.

Subject: Source for reconditioned CO2 tanks


In HBD #921 Dan Roman asked about a source for a source for used CO2 tanks.


There's a company called Bev-Con International (BCI) which lists
reconditioned CO2 cylinders (2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 pound sizes) in their
catalog.  I acquired their catalog/price list through the N.H. based Brew
Free or Die homebrew club. As an example of their prices, the price list I
have lists a 5# reconditioned cylinder for $32.50 (I don't know if this
includes the cap/valve). I haven't looked extensively at a lot of
catalogs/brochures that carry kegs and CO2 cylinders, but in all that I have
seen, this is the first place that I noticed that sells reconditioned CO2
cylinders.


Anyway, the contact information:


                       Bev-Con International
                       6400 Highway 51 South
                           P.O. Box 396
                        Brighton, TN 38011


                       Phone: (901) 476-8000
                       WATS:  (800) 284-9410
                       FAX:   (901) 476-4811


In addition to CO2 cylinders, their price list includes  various makes of
beverage tanks (ex. Cornelius) in various sizes, as well as many different
types of standard 1/4 & 1/2 size barrels.


Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with BCI and in fact I haven't bought
anything from BCI (yet), so this is not even a recommendation.  I was
recently helping someone else look for a source for reconditioned CO2
cylinders so that's why I noticed BCI sells them and why I have the
information.


happy kegging!

the midwest and here in the Northwest we use Great Western's 2-row
(which seems to be a blend of Klages and Harrington these days).


It may also have something to do with the quality of the wheat
malt.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear that he uses the stuff from
Briess, which I wouldn't feed to the ducks.  I've used either the
British or the German wheat malts to excellent effect; both are big
fat grains (with no barley mixed in as has been the case in the past
with Briess).

Once again, my own experience has been completely the opposite,
and I've heard the same here in the HBD.  I brewed with this
yeast strain last fall, and the beer went from 1.072 to 1.012 in
five days.  This is not what I'd call a slow yeast!


It's entirely possible that the problem is a lack of oxygen in
the wort.  A shortage of O2 will not necessarily be reflected in
a long lag time, but will definitely cause an almost-endless
fermentation.  It's also possible that you under-pitched; I
definitely worked my up from the original bag through starters
before pitching the yeast into such a high-gravity wort.


If the yeast is not working well for you from the original
Wyeast supply, then washing it isn't likely to help.  Washing
the yeast pack from the fermenter before storing it in the
refrigerator is another story.

Date:7/14/92
Brewers! I have noticed the topic of reusing yeast has come up again,
and would like to comment, as I have had some success with this
technique. When bottling, I dump the yeast from the bottom of the
carboy into sterile bottles, cap, and keep refrigerated. A few days
ahead of brewing, I pitch into some sanitary wort (Premade, bottled,
and refrigerated) to make a starter. When this topic last came up,
people said to use the yeast within 3 weeks of refrigerating, but I
have had no trouble resuscitating a 3 mo. old culture. Also, someone
(Al, I think) mentioned washing the yeast with sanitary water. I have
tried this, but found no great advantage. Any junk in the yeast settles
out (just be careful when pitching into starter), will settle out of
the starter (also pour carefully), not to mention diluted into 5 gal.
of wort. Reusing in this way has produced much shorter lag times than
when I used to keep agar plates (although single colony starters can't
be beat for strain purity).  I have kept a Chimay culture, a Chico
(WYeast), and German lager (WYeast) going serially for several batches,
and only keep a library of stock plates as backup. By the way, I have
detected no contamination by colony morphology and microscopy. The one
caveat I must add is to practice better than average sanitation.
Anyways, IMHO maintaining yeast strains is better than buying new
because with time, the yeast become well adapted to you, your setup,
and your beer. It truly makes a yeast your own. -Brett

John Freeborg asks about acidifying sparge water.


According to Dr. Lewis at UC Davis, water is not a good buffer, ie. water's
ability to alter pH is very weak. In a contest between a mash of 5.0 - 5.5 and
sufficient sparge water at 6.5 - 7.5 the mash will win. Only if your local
water is on the alkaline side should you worry about modifying the pH prior to
sparge. Lewis says that there is no harm in adding lactic acid to sparge water,
especially if it makes you feel better about your beer, however the benefit is
psychological only.

Here's a blueberry beer I made recently.  The blueberry character isn't
as pronounced as I'd like; I think it's partly because the berries
weren't particularly ripe.  The fruit is very subtle, and imparts a
pleasing wine-like characteristic and acidity.  I thought a brown ale
would lend itself well to the blueberries, and I must say I'm happy
with the combination.


        Brown and Blue Ale


        6.5 lbs pale malt
        .5  lbs wheat malt
        .75 lbs 80L crystal malt
        4   oz  black patent malt (uncracked)
        2   oz  roasted barley (uncracked)
        1   oz  Goldings (4.9% alpha)
        .5  oz  Fuggles (4.5% alpha)
        5   lbs fresh blueberries
        WYeast #1084 (Irish ale)


Procedure:  mash in 2 gal.  at 130F, protein rest 30 min at 125F, add
1.25 gal, mash 30 min at 150F, raise temp to 158F until converted (15
min), mash out 10 min at 170F.
Sparge with 4 gallons to yield 5.5 gal at 1.046.  Add Fuggles and .75
oz of Goldings after 20 minutes of boil, boil 60 min, add last .25 oz of
Goldings and boil 15 min more.
Rinse blueberries in a dilute sulfite solution (after weeding out the
fuzzy ones), puree, and add to primary along with yeast.


This gave me 5.5 gal of beer with OG 1.046 not counting the blueberries
(how the heck do you measure gravity with all those solids in there?).
There was lots of blueberry aroma coming from the fermenter the first
couple of days, but not very much when I racked after 4 days.  I bottled
after 4 more days in the secondary, at a FG of 1.010.


I think lots of aroma volatiles got lost with all the outgassing in the
primary; I think next time I may wait to add the berries to the
secondary.  I may also skip the roasted barley, and use only .5 lb of
40L crystal so the blue from the berries is more obvious.


The next batch is going to be a cherry wheat, with lots of tart
baking cherries in the secondary and a looong maceration.  Yum!
