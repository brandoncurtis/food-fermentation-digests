De Wolf-Cosyns Maltings is one of Belgium's oldest and largest
floor malting plants.  They supply many of Belgium's lambic brewers
along with more conventional breweries in Northern Europe.  Only
the finest European barley and wheat are used.  The barley (all
two-row) and wheat berries are larger than domestic malts.  The
dark grains are flavorful and not in the least harsh or astringent.


Here is a listing of the available malts along with color ratings:


Base Malts
pale ale           3.5 -   4.5L
pilsen             1.5 -   2
wheat              1.4 -   1.8


Color Malts
Munich             7   -   8
Aromatic          23   -  28


Caramel Malts
Caramel-Pils       5   -  10
Caravienne        15   -  30
CaraMunich        70   -  80
Special B        150   - 250


Roasted Malts
Biscuit           23   -  33
Chocolate        450   - 550
Black Malt       700   - 800
Roasted Barley   700   - 800


Here are some comments on the malts.  Note that Pierre Rajotte's
Belgian Ale book mentions some of these.  The color ratings given
above differ a bit from those in Rajotte's book, but the ones
listed above are from the supplier.


The pilsner malt rivals the finest pilsner malt available.  It
should be used instead of U.S 2-row or 6-row for such styles as
Trippels, wit beers, and various Specials.  Note that George Fix's
Vienna book also argued that Pilsner malt should be the base malt
for the Vienna-Marzen-Fest style.  You might also use it in your
best Pilsner.


The Munich and Aromatic malts provide malt aroma, body, and color. 
The Aromatic is slightly darker than a dark Munich, and its name
says it all so far as aroma and taste are concerned.


The CaraPils (not to be confused with American Cara-Pils!),
CaraVienne, and CaraMunich are basically very fine crystal malts
comparable to 10L, 30L, and 80L crystal malts you might use.  The
Special B is a highly colored caramel malt that, in Rajotte's
words, "...Gives a rich caramel-malt taste.  It is used in Scotch
ales and stouts brewed under license in Belgium.  Darker Specials
and Abbey beers at times use this type of caramel malt.  Its effect
is noticeable in beers, giving lots of additional body and
coloring.  Beers using Special B have more well-rounded malt
character than beers colored with only candi sugar."  Again, George
Fix in his Vienna book argues for using the finest crystal malts to
avoid astringency in the beer, especially for that style.


At homebrew club meetings, those of us in the Chicago Beer Society
have been able to sample these malts, as the local Siebel
Institute's retail branch had them.  NOTE, however, that Siebel
Institute is not a supplier of these malts.  Moreover, the Siebel
Institute exists to serve commercial brewing and not the
homebrewing community.  I know of a number of suppliers of the
grains.  Standard disclaimer here:  I have no commercial interest,
but figured that those whose appetites are whetted would want to
know where to get the grains!  I don't know prices, so call the
establishment.


 - Tim Norris, Chicago, IL 312-545-4004--Tim runs a basement
homebrew shop.  He suggests that homebrew clubs get a collective
order together, but is willing to ship small orders.


 - North Brewery Supplies, Franklin, WI 414-761-1018--Brian North
runs a basement homebrew shop located between Milwaukee and
Kenosha.  For those of you thinking of getting into kegging, Brian
has all sorts of stuff, and can service and refurbish equipment.
Call from 6-9 pm his time.


 - Alternative Beverage, Streamwood, IL--Don't have their phone
number, but their ad is in Zymurgy.  Owner Dave Itel (Ittel?) runs
a very complete homebrew and gardening shop.  As of this writing,
they either have the grains or will be getting them shortly.


 - Great Fermentations of Santa Rosa:  I don't have their catalog
with me, but I recall seeing some of the Belgian malts mentioned.

Subject: Re:  Yellowing Hops


Hops are subject to "wilt", a disease that spreads from the ground up. I
ordered and planted Cascades from Freshops in Oregon, and they recommended
training the hops straight up for at least 6' before going horizontal, and
then (when the vines are leafy enough) removing all the leaves between 6'
and ground. This will prevent the wilt from spreading upward. For the first
year, though, the plants are not really energetic enough to grow that fast
or large quickly enough, so I've been plucking the leaves as they show
symptoms. Next year, the plants will have a more extensive root system,
and will grow quickly enough to "escape" the wilt. 


Oh, they also recommended, after the first year, to prune the first growth
off, in favor of "more hardy" second growth.

Subject: Hop vine pruning and lagering refrigerator




        Congratulations, Jack.  You certainly stirred up interest in HBD
during the summer doldrums.


        A few weeks ago I was complaining here that my hop rhizomes weren't
growing, so naturally they are now growing all too well.  I have assiduously
pruned back new shoots after letting 2 or 3 climb on twine, and now there
are 3-5 ft vines from each rhizome.  At the junction of each leaf pair with
vine, however, there are new shoots orthogonal to the leaves.  Since these
shoots develop leaves, etc., and appeared to be new vines I have been nipping
them in the bud, so to speak.  It just dawned on me that these might be the
beginnings of flower cones, so I'm "shooting" myself in the foot.  In
pictures that I've seen of flowering hops, though, I've never seen leaves
on the "burrs" that go from the vine to flowers.  Any thoughts from
experienced hop growers?  Anyone with a climate similar to Cleveland
getting flowers already?


        I have been contemplating getting a cheap fridge and a Hunter
Airstat for both lagering and an eventual kegging setup.  I recently saw
someone suggest a chest type freezer instead of an upright fridge.  I am
concerned, however, that getting 5 gal of beer in and out or an chest type
unit will be difficult, and that the height of the chest will not be
sufficient. Any experience?  


Thanks in advance.

Hi,
  I have a friend who will be visiting the South Shore Boston area
soon and asked me to find out if there are any good package stores in
that area.  He specifically does not want to drive into Boston (yes,
he KNOWS what he will be missing!) He is looking for a good selection
of beers to bring back home with him.

Subject: wort chillers






I've recently manufactured a counterflow wort chiller out of garden
hose and copper tube. It works great, with one exception. After it has
sat between batches it seems to develop a sort of light blue flakey
substance inside the copper tubing, requiring quite a bit of
flushing before all is removed. Does anyone have any idea what this is
or if it is harmful to me or the beer. It would seem to me that there
must still be microscopic quantities of the material entering the wort
and ultimately my belly.

While this is the first time I post such a request, I've seen

I have just come into possesion of 5 old coca-cola kegs (3 bucks
a pop from the scrap metal yard).  I know much has been written 
in the digests about the use of these kegs but alas I just skimmed
them (not having a keg of my own). I was hoping someone might
have a reference or compendium of advice on the refit and use

Subject: Belle Vue Kriek LA


I live in the Washington, D.C. area, where the weather is beastly hot at 
the moment, and often sickeningly humid.  I'm also a passionate Belgian
beer fan, but even a dose of air conditioning is not enough to get me in
the right frame of mind to tackle one of the beers in the fridge, most 
of which weigh in at at least 8% alchohol.
        Recently a group of Belgian friends blew through town, and brought
me a CARE package of beers and chocolate.  Among these was a Belle Vue
Kriek LA.  Kriek means cherry beer, and LA means low alchohol.  The beer
is 1.5% by volume, ranking it in the Belgian category III, for table beers.
        At first look it seemed to me that this was just the kind of beers
that would be dreamed up by the boys down the hall in marketing--the next
great thing after dry beer!  (More filling, less taste!)  This doubt
was not assuaged by the fact that Belle Vue is owned by that slimy Belgian
octopus, Interbrew.
        In fact, it was surprising how not bad it was.  Rich red cherry
color, but not fluorescent.  Excellent head.  A slightly sweet taste
(a Belle Vue trademark).  Not terribly complex, but very pleasant.  What
was lacking was a bit of tartness, which I overcame by the oral application
of some dark chocolate esters (and a very good match it was).
        So, the boys in marketing win one.  The stuff was pleasant to 
drink, left no fog on the brain, and--HOLY COW--had taste!  What a concept!
This has been the universal problem with all the low-alchohol beers I've
ever run into, and has indirectly sharpened my interest in gin (why drink
beer when all that's available is Sharps and Coors?).
        In fact, I'd even be willing to buy the stuff again, if it didn't
come from t\ose Interbrew slime-balls.  But the issue is this--why not
add some flavor?  Why not have low alchohol beer, when it can be satisfying?
As advocates of responsible drinking, I think this is the sort of thing
we could definitely use more of.


On a vaguely related topic, I mentioned to our Belgian visitors my interest
in Pierre Rajotte's new book on Belgian brewing, and the difficulty of
getting candy sugar for brewing.  Rajotte states that it's available from
brewery suppliers in 50 pound bags.  I mean, I'm ambitious enough, but that's
a lot of sugar to schlep around.  Anyway, our guests said that the stuff is
available almost everywhere--supermarkets, etc.--in both the light and
dark varieties.  I'm trying to get some via our next courier (end of Aug.),
and will post any news on this front.

OK, here is my understanding--others will correct me where I am
wrong <g>.


1) The warmer the water, the easier it is to dissolve the
   extract.
2) The extract will burn if it sits on the bottom of the pot
   while there is high heat being applied.


Therefore, you want to stir the extract into very warm water not
on the heat.  That is why the advice is to get the water boiling
(it won't get any hotter than that), take it off the heat, stir
in the extract (previously warmed up), put it back on the heat
when it is all stirred up (no more sitting on the bottom of the
pot).


With a flame, just turn off the flame.  With an electric heating
element, you have to lift the pot off the hot element until no
more extract is on the bottom of the pot.

Subject: Where to get started?


Hi all,
    I am new to this beer brewing stuff, and would like some tips on how
to get started.  Any info would be helpful.  What equipment I need,
where to get grains and other ingredients, how to store the beer, etc. 
If you can direct me to a good publication on the subject that would be
great.  If you happen to be in the Pittsburgh area and can lead me to
sources for ingredients and equipment, that would be most appreciated. 
I don't know whether it matters, but I would like to brew some stouts
and porters (just because I seem to like these type of beer in general).
 I know absolutely nothing about the process of brewing beer other than
the fact that you have some grains and some yeast, so keep any info on a
beginners level.


Thanks,
    Steve

Yet another way to remember which keg fitting (2 or 3

OK, I'm going to take the plunge with this batch and try dry hopping.  I'm

I'm pretty sure about the quantity of hops I want to use but I'm not sure
about how long to leave them in.  I usually secondary for about two weeks
with most of my brews.  Is this long enough/too long if I dry hop in the
secondary?

Jack et al:


Please, Jack, I'm sure your heart was in the right place, but... the key
to a good, interesting Digest is not quantity, but quality.  The reason
that certain issues of the Digest are interesting is because the people
who are contributing are _involved_ in the discussion.  This may keep
the volume down (which, admit it, makes it easier to read through the
Digest in a reasonable period), but it also keeps the discussion lively
and current.  Right now, I've been waiting for three days for my
response to someone to be posted -- and the Digest has been filled with
people who are posting comments purely to enter the maltmill lottery.


I can't see what good this is doing, particularly if these people -- who
have previously been silent here -- go back to reading and never
contributing.


So, Jack, please if you want to give away malt mills, do so, but don't
tell anyone that's what you're planning.  Let people contribute to the
Digest because they have something to say, and allow the normal
day-to-day fluctuations in volume to continue.  That way people can get
back to asking questions and getting responses in a day or two, rather
than in a week.  And I, for one, can stop reading endless postings of
"Did I win?"

Subject: All Grain is Expensive (NOT)


I hear this sentiment about all grain brewing often--it's expensive. I will
summarize what I spent and let you judge for yourself. I used Dave Miller's
book for a reference. Here goes.
 
         Boiling kettle: 33 qt enamelware                $30  
         Mash tun: 20 qt enamel ware                        $15
         Lauter tun: 2-5 gal plastic buckets                $ 3 each
                     plastic spigot                        $ 4
                     "ensolite" pad (insulation)                $ 5  
         Box for mash tun: 4' x 4' x 1/4" plywood        $ 7
                           spray-in insulation                $ 4 
         Corona mill                                        $13 (Goodwill)
         Pulleys and motor for corona (I'm lazy)                $10 (ditto)
                                                        ----
                                                         $91
 
I save between $5 and $15 on each 5 gal batch(I buy grain in bulk). I
have made 30 batches with this equipment and couldn't be happier. I use a 60
qt camp cooler for holding my hot sparge water and do a gravity feed with the
cooler up high, the lauter tun in the middle and boiler down low. BTW the way,
beers made with this equip *have* done well in competitions. The only reason
I'll change is to get bigger, i.e. 1/2 barrel size.

Subject: Cider and it's yeast 






Sorry for the delayed reply...
In HBD #921 Andy Phillips commented:


>The traditional way of making 
farmhouse (ie. homebrew) cider is simply to crush apples, press out
the juice and allow it to ferment without any additions, even yeast.
Fermentation relies on infection by wild yeasts from the air. You
could try this, but I wouldn't recommend it - there is no guarantee 
that a suitable wild yeast will fall from the heavens, and there will
be plenty of other bugs waiting their chance to turn your apple juice
into cider vinegar.




        Well this is slightly misleading Andy. The source of the 
        wild yeasts is not waiting to drop from the heavens. It is
        already right there on the apples at crushing time. Right
        around the stem on almoist all apples is a yellowish, powdery
        substance, referred to by growers as the "bloom". This is
        wild yeasts which collect on the apples, from the air, and
        from insects (i.e. bees) which are responsible for the flowers
        pollination to begin with. 


        They are not just random yeasts. They live in orchards because
        they ferment fruit sugars well and are able to propagate there.
        I too was skeptical at first, but Paul Correnty (Resident NE
        Cider guru) convinced me to try a ferment with only the yeasts
        present in the pressed cider itself. It is truly wonderful!!
        (and it just got edged out for 3rd place in the AHA National
        by my buddy Bob Gorman.... :-( ).


        So while exposing your cider to air is not recommended, it
        is quite possible to make very good cider with the wild yeasts
        that occur naturaaly on the apples, and thus in the pressed cider.
        One does however have to have a little more patience perhaps, 
        as these yeasts are slower to start, and like a long fermentation
        and aging period. Also fortification prior to fermentation is 
        recommended as they are very voracious fermenters....

A few days ago I posted a description of my partial mash techniques and

After this post I didn't recieve the HBD's for a few days. This was the
end of last week when Rob explained out the postings swamping his

Did anybody see this post?  Can anyone comment on Phil's (or the likes)

According to an article I read recently (in the Food section of the
San Jose Mercury News, but it may have been reprinted from somewhere
else), there are two methods used commercially.  One of them was a
vacuum distillation process.  The other did involve a special strain
of yeast -- not one that didn't produce alcohol, but one that basically
didn't ferment very much at all.  The article didn't go into much more
detail -- presumably this would mean that they start with an extremely
low initial gravity, and perhaps add carbonation?  I'm not sure.

I think that my answer of adding more honey was not targetted at the
actual question asked by the original poster.  In my experience, adding 
more honey can help make the mead "better".  If one makes a quick-mead, 
where one bottles before the primary fermentation finishes (my usual 
practice), one gets significant unfermented sugar left, and this adds 
significant flavor and "richness" to the mead.  As commented above, this
does lead to glass grenades if the bottles are not refrigerated relatively
quickly.  I have heard one tale (on this forum, I think) of a recipe for
mead that has you open a bottle a week until the pressure in each succeeding
bottle "scares you".  Then, hold a party immediately and drink off the
entire batch.


In my experience, the choice of honey adds richness to the taste and
experience, because of the source of the sugars (nectar).  Molasses
honey, buckwheat honey, orange blossom honey, "raw wildflower honey",
all add unique flavors and texture to the taste of the drink, as
does the choice of spices.  One friend of mine added a pound of crushed
ginger to every gallon of his batch of "quick mead" (two pounds of
honey per gallon) and ginger lovers in our group thought it was
wonderful!  They called it "death by ginger".


Now, if you mean "thickness" when you say "body" (i.e., the way that a 
liqueur has a very viscous flow), then you really would have to add a
lot of honey to exceed the capabilities of the yeast to consume it and
make alcohol.  I've seen mead like this only once, a long time ago, and
I thought it was wonderful!  It was over two years in the making, and
the amount of it was very limitted.  Someday I'll have the patience to
try that recipe!


May your bottles never burst!

I have heard of an interesting solution. Find an old water heater and make sure
that it is stainless steel lined, which is supposedly fairly common. Then you
simply saw it off at what ever level you prefer, giving you a boiling pot up
to maybe 40 gallon capacity. The beauty of this is that the unit comes complete
with a nice stand and best yet - a built in burner! Just hook this puppy up
to a gas line (refrain from ingesting home brews previous to this part) and 
fire it up. One other addition that you might need is to add a drain spigot
if the model that you have doesn't already have one. Overall, this is a rather
inexpensive (assuming you find a junker water heater that will work), and not
overly difficult project to create for yourself.
Disclaimer: I've never actually seen one of these in use...

Several issues back (sorry, I lost my files), reference was made to the

At the moment I use heat to sanitize my bottles (actually, I bake them),
and have avoided using the dishwasher for this purpose because the water
does not reach the required temperature of 170 F.  Given the above 
information about the detergent, does this mean that using the dishwasher

I would like to brew a pale ale, and am considering culturing yeasts

from Kalamazoo have yeast in the bottle (it's been too long since i've

 Just for the record, according to Jean Hunter's gas chromatograph, the sample

 Don't know that it is genetically altered but they definitely use yeast that 
 produces less alcohol but that is about the extent of my knowledge.
 
 I would think that a simple expedient would be simply to use less sugar/malt 
 in the brew to begin with.  Judging by what that rubbish tastes like, they do 
 not need any magic yeast.

 I suppose I am getting suckered again but I will assume this is a sincere 
 question.
 
 Malted barley must be crushed before it can be properly mashed.  There are 
 many ways of doing this including, rolling pins, kitchen blenders, grain 
 grinders and roller mills.  Only the latter is designed for the task and does 
 the proper job.
 
 Although the efficiency of sugar extraction improves as the particle size 
 decreases, the major flaw that grinders, cutters and blenders have is that 
 they also pulverize the husk of the grain.   The mashing process, depends on 
 the intact husks to provide the needed filter bed when sparging the mashed 
 grain.  If the husks are pulverized, there is no filtering and impossibly 
 turbid wort results in addtion to the fact that the husks will end up in the 
 boil.
 
 Roller mills, squeeze the grain between sets of rollers and only crush the 
 grain enough to release the malt so that it can be reached by the mashing 
 water.  The husk is left intact.
 
 Until very recently, there was no ROLLER mill available to the home brewer.

It is interesting the notion of a "lager" malt.  Now I have no
doubt that there is such a grain out there, but I believe that the
realities of modern brewing make lager malt archaic.  Let me explain.


I have heard, and claimed that most US lager malts are in fact
fully modified and can be mashed with a single step infusion.  I have
also hear that most German brewers are now using single step infusion
mashing.  


Last weekend, at the Oregon Brewers Festival, I had a long discussion
with some maltsters from Great Western Malting (GWM) regarding their
Pale Malt.  This stuff is a 2-Row blend of fully modified malt.  The 
reason it is fully modified is to MAXIMIZE the enzyme content - needed
for the high adjunct ratios in Bud, etc. beers.  It is blended to
produce a highly consistent product.  The big boys simply demand that.
This is the same base malt used by many west coast microbrewers.  It
is also the same malt that many, erroneously, call Klages.  yes, there
is klages in it, but ther eis also Harrington, Crystal and some other
names I now forget.  If your malt supplier has Huge Baird malts, their
"klages" malt is most likely the GWM pale malt as GWM distributes HB
specialties.  


The bottom line is that step mashing is probably a quaint practice that
is a hangover from big commercial breweries that use lots of rice and
corn (where step mashing is still needed).  For most practical purposes,
using all malt recipes with US and european malts single step infusion
mashing is adequate and sufficient and won't produce chill haze.  
I forgot to ask them about their 6-row stuff, but I believe the same 
story holds as members of the Brews Brothers of Seattle have reported
single step infusion mashing of 6-Row working out just fine.


So, anyone else out there given up step mashing when doing all malt
recipes and been satisfied with the results?  Anyone else have any
evidence to support or debunk my claims, above?


I look forward to hearing from Y'all.


Cheers!
