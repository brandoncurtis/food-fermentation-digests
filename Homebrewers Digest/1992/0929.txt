I think the consensus was that while the dishwasher may not
effectively *clean* your bottles, it can do a good job of
*sanitizing* them if it has a "heated dry" type cycle.  The steam
from that cycle should sanitize quite nicely.

Subject: Mead Yeast Nutrients




I have since misplaced my copy, but one of Byron Burch's
advertisements (in the form of a newspaper, with articles and
such), mentioned a special Mead Yeast that they carry.


The gist of the article was that without proper nutrients, it
takes a long time for mead to ferment.  And that if you used a
beer yeast nutrient set, it would give a harsh taste that would
take a lot of aging to remove.  Therefore, using a special mead
yeast would get you that wonderfully-aged mead taste in much less
than a year.


Before I embark on such a proposition, has anyone tested this new
yeast nutrient formulation and found it significantly better for
their meads?

Hello brewers,

I simply pitch as soon as my wort is cool enough, then rack the wort off
the trub a few hours later.  When the house is cooler, the yeast are
slower to get started, so I can leave it overnight. I should add that
I only brew ales, so I don't worry about the yeasties hiding
in the trub.  As long as I rack before the respiration stage is over,
I don't worry about the risk of oxidation.


Does anyone have any comments on Windsor English Ale Yeast from Canada?
Due to poor planning on my part, I couldn't get liquid yeast for my last
batch, and was unable to get Whitbread Ale. :^(  Windsor fermented 
out 7 pounds of malt extract in about 36 hours (at 78 degrees).  It only 
took about 4 hours to finish up the respiration stage.  Are the yeasties
hyper because of the temp, or is it a characteristic of this strain?  
What sort of off-flavors are caused by high-temp fermentations?


Thanks in advance.

Hi All!


I'm not sure that this really qualifies as an "article" so much as
a request for information.  My wife and I have just moved to the 
New Haven, CT area from central Ohio and were wanting some info on 
brewpubs and/or microbreweries that offer tours that are in the area.
I am aware of the Elm City brewery here in New Haven -- are there others
that are within a couple of hours?  I haven't yet located any brewpubs
here, but haven't had the chance to search too hard yet.  Also, are
there any homebrew suppliers nearby?  Thanks in advance for the info --
I've only been brewing for a short time, but have found the digest a
good source of info and ideas.  If it would be better, you can send
your suggestions / information directly to me (to keep from cluttering
up the digest) at:

Based on my world-class understanding of chemistry, I'd guess that the
blue stuff that forms on your copper wort chiller is copper sulfate.
If I'm right, then you definitely want to get rid of it; it's toxic.
You might try rinsing with a little vinegar and salt in boiling water.

IMHO - Leave the Dead Cat (Piss) beer alone. They have had a serious infection
problem for a long time. Devil Mountain can't be out of business as I had their
Railroad Ale yesterday at the California Small Brewers Festival in Mt. View, Ca.
and it was very tasty. I would also skip the bottled versions of anything 
from Winchester. Although this is one of the first brew-pubs that got me 
hooked, I find the bottled versions boring and the pubs beers are not always
consistant.


Unfortunately, many of the beers served yesterday left something to be desired.
Many seemed to be quite young and a few were completely off - Monterey 
(as usual) and Boulder Creek Stout come to mind...


The Anderson Porter was delicious and a big hit, Mendocino Blue Heron Ale
was very disappointing yesterday, although I have had very good bottles in
the past. Anchor was there and thier products were great. They even had
Old Foghorn (Which used up about a third of my tokens!) Can you fit a keg
in your case? One from So. Ca. that I had never heard of "Rhino Chasers" 
had a very nice ale. Can't think of any other great beers that are also
available in bottles represented yesterday, but one other mention is a
hefeweizen from Gordon Birsch (of which I got the last glass!) which was
very tasty. I don't believe they sell in bottles though.

This is my first post.  I am planning to begin brewing soon,

Can you be more descriptive about these caps.  Do they carry 
screens or do they just elevate the bottom of the pick-up
tubes?

Subject: Re: Lager vs Ale malts?


I posted this to rec.crafts.brewing recently, but since the lager vs
ale malt discussion is continuing, I thought I'd repost it here for the
benefit of those who don't read r.c.b.  I also added few more comments.


Re: highly modified malts


According to a local (Ft.  Collins, CO) maltster/seed-lab technician Jim
Bruce, there is actually little difference in modification between
various malts.  He says that all malts these days (US ale, UK ale,
continental lager) are all highly modified; the differences are in the
kilning technique and in the barley itself.


Jim specializes in continental-style lager malts, which he says differ
from ale malts in protein content due to a longer, more gradual increase
in kilning temperature.  Ale malts have a shorter kilning time with a
sharper upwards temperature curve.  The end result is that lager malts
retain more proteins which are necessary to sustain the yeast over long
lagering periods.  Therefore, he says, you can use a lager malt to make
an ale, but not the other way around.  He also stresses that lager malts
will benefit from a multi-step mash to extract these proteins, whereas
ale malt can be used for a one-step infusion and achieve the same
protein extraction.


Larry Barello posts that "The bottom line is that step mashing is
probably a quaint practice that is a hangover from big commercial
breweries that use lots of rice and corn (where step mashing is still
needed)."  According to Jim, this isn't the case.  A step mash is useful
for ensuring a high-protein wort, not for converting adjuncts (though it
may be helpful there as well).  We all agree, however, that in terms of
enzymatic power and sugar extraction, lager and ale malts are
comparable.


Jim also maintains that the difference between US and UK pale malts is
that UK barley is grown in soils that are less heavily fertilized with
artificial fertilizers and therefore have a lower nitrogen content.


BTW, for those of you here in the central/south west region (CO, ID,
AZ, NM, UT, MT, WY, TX), there's an article on Jim in last month's Rocky
Mountain Brews.


For the record, I typically use a 3-step mash (122F for 30min, 150-155F
for about an hour, and 170F for 10 min).  It doesn't seem that much more
difficult than straight infusion.  I've done infusion mashes, but I've
never done a direct comparison.

Hi everyone,


I was interested in trying one of the Cranberry Ale recipies that I 
saw in The Cats Meow 2 but have a couple of questions:


        1) anyone ever try either of them and have some recommendations
           to give?


        2) should I use the bags of forzen cranberries that have been
           in the house freezer door for three years?  (I only
           moved in recently - don't blame me!)


One other thing that has been bugging me - does anyone know of a source for
beer barrels other than Beer Wine and Hobby in Woburn, MA?  I want
to give one of those a shot but don't like the prices (on anything)
at the only place that I know has any of these.




Cheers,

'Fraid so, Jane. All thanks to Texas State government and Anheiser-Busch
(disclaimer: so the story goes). The law says something along the lines of
"alcoholic beverages may not be sold on the same premises as they are brewed."
The result is that all the breweries must have hospitality rooms or
give the stuff away, etc. but that brewpubs are forbidden.


        However, I was talking with some friends about this the other
day, and one of them said that they knew of a place which made you
purchase coupons which could be then exchanged for beer. I don't know
if it would be possible to get round the law that way - maybe the ACLU
would be prepared to sponsor a test case ?


        On the bright side, there are a number of micro breweries in
Texas whose products can be purchase in draught here in Dallas. So
it's not all woe. Just make sure you visit the Gingerman, at the
corner of the Quadrangle (everyone knows where that is).

Yes, it was slightly negative, but only due to the beer selection (which
is the main reason I went!)  Reducing the waiting time is no excuse for
serving mainstream-style beer.  If they continue to limit selection and
only serve the styles they did this year, I WON'T be attending next year.


By all means, if you've never been, try to make it next year!

Subject: Yeast for a barleywine (recommendations please)?


I've got barleywine on the brain, and am looking forward to making one now
for this winter's consumption.  It'll be my first attempt, and I have a 
question:  I haven't seen much consensus on what yeast to use...  


There seem to be several schools of thought:


        - Use a wine yeast (exclusively)
        - Use an ale yeast (exclusively)
        - Use an ale yeast to start, then add a wine yeast later to finish


At the moment, I'm leaning toward using a hardy ale yeast;  the triple-strain
Whitbread comes to mind, as (from what I read here on the HBD) it contains one
strain which will survive the higher alcohol levels.  Also, I imagine the
SNPA American Ale yeast may do, since SN uses it for the Bigfoot.  I'm trying
to look at this barleywine as a strong beer rather than as a wine, and hope-
fully de-emphasize the wineyness.  All you barleywiners, what say ye??


Is the Whitbread 3-strain ale yeast available in liquid form? (like Wyeast?)


Any recommendations for a first-time BarleyWhiner?

For each of my two Coffee Stouts, I brewed a strong pot (8-10 cups) of
either Zimbabwe or Morroccan coffee from Peet's Coffees in Berkeley.
The flavor and aroma of good strong coffee was unmistakeable, but not
overwhelming.  I rated the first batch as one of my top three ever.  I
botched the third batch (didn't boil off nearly enough volume, so the
beer turned out Way Too Light) but the flavor was still quite good.

Let me start off by saying this is a true story.


A couple of years ago, a buddy of mine (Tim) returned to St. Louis from LA.
While living in California, he and another friend had an uncontrollable
urge for Busch beer.  Not Bud, not but Bussssch!, which I understand is not
marketed much out of the Midwest. (At the risk of detroying all crediability
on this forum, I can attest to the ingrain desire of all St. Louisiannes
for Busch.)  As a gesture of friendship, Tim decided to pack up a case of 
Busch and send it to his wayward friend in LA.  He packed up a case and
walking into the post office and plunked it down on the counter.  The
clerk hefted it onto the scale and noting the weight asked if he wanted
the package sent "book" rate.  Tim mis-understood and thought she was 
asking if he wanted it sent "Busch" rate. "You've got a special rate for 
that?" he asked.  So the next time your sending beer through the mail,
ask for the "Busch" rate.

    A mini-mash of the oatmeal will work as long as you also mash some
    malted barley with it, so that there will be enough enzymes to
    convert the starch in the oatmeal into sugar (oatmeal lacks the
    necessary enzymes).  I've done this a couple times with good
    results.


You might talk with Jay Hersh -- he once sent me a digest of his
extract-based oatmeal stout recipes.


Here's the recipe for my Oatmeal Cream Stout. It was pieced together by
comparing a number of Oatmeal and Cream Stout recipes posted to the HBD, as
well as information in Eckert's book: Essentials of Beer Style.


10#        pale ale malt
1#        roasted barley (500L)
0.5#        flaked barley (1.5L)
0.5#        crystal malt (60L)
0.5#        chocolate malt (400L)
1.3#        steel cut oats (from a health food store)
0.5#        lactose
9 aau        bullions pellets (9% alpha), boil 60 minutes
0.5 oz        fuggles pellets (3.4% alpha), boil 15 minutes
0.5 oz         fuggles pellets (3.4% alpha), steep
0.7 stick brewers licorice (boil)
starter culture of Wyeast Irish Ale #1084


Mash with 5 gallons 18 oz (48 oz/#) at 155-150F for 90 minutes.
Sparge with 3 gallons water at 165F, collecting 6.5 gallons for boil.
Boil 75 minutes, then force chill.
Save 1.5 liters boiled wort for priming, ferment the rest.


OG: 1.062
FG: 1.021 (high due to unfermentable lactose)


COMMENTS


We did a taste test against Youngs Oatmeal Stout, Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout,
and Watneys Cream Stout. It came out tasting **very** similar to Youngs:
same hop character, a little heavier, sweeter, and slightly less roasty; a
bit lighter in color (brown/red vs. brown/black). It was not as rich
tasting and full-bodied as the Sam Smiths. It was not as roasty/burnt as
Watneys, or as jet-black.


Next time, I would reduce the OG to about 1.050 to reduce alcohol a bit,
but add some dextrin malt for improved body. I'd aim a little more toward
the Watneys, as it's one of my all-time faves: slightly less lactose, but
more roasted malt.




As popular as this was, it didn't last very long. Next time, I'll
definitely do a double batch!

Subject: mashing wheat malt








Hi all,


        This past weekend I brewed an all grain dunkelweizen.  This
was my first experience with wheat malt, I changed my procedure
somewhat, and something unusual occured.
        Having read that wheat malt is high in protien, I did an
extended protien rest, holding the mash at 118F-122F for one hour.
I then raised the temperature of the mash to 155F for one hour,
checking temperature and stirring at 10-15 minute intervals.  This
mash took just over two hours to convert, as verified by several
iodine tests.  Using the same equipment and procedures(except for the
longer protien rest), I have never had a mash take longer than 1 to
1 1/2 hours, using English pale, German 2 row pilsner, Munich, etc.


So, my questions to those who have mashed wheat malt:


Is it normal that conversion took so long?  I had read that wheat
malt is very high in amalyse enzyme, I expected a somewhat shorter
mash than normal.


Is an extended protien rest desirable?  Could this have affected
the starch conversion?


Some specifics:


5 lbs. wheat malt
3 lbs. munich malt
2 lbs. 2 row lager malt 
1/2 lb. black malt - did'nt mash this, just crushed and added to
lauter tun.


1.25 qt/lb, water to grist ratio


Initial SG 1.055 after boiling down to 5.25 gallons, so my extraction
was reasonable.  In fact, everything about the brew seems normal,
except for the longer mash.


P.S.  There has been a fair amount of discussion on the net lately
regarding the clove character (or lack thereof) imparted by Wyeast
3056.  Some have posted that higher fermentation temperatures seem
to help provide more clove flavor.  The above batch is now 
fermenting away in my 72F-75F basement, so in two-three weeks I'll
have some data on this point.


                                                Cheers,
                                                Jim

You seem to forget that a lot of people don't find it obvious. Many people
read this forum to learn new things, and to them it's not obvious.


Additionally you are constantly in the habit of contradicting people,
and "debunking" even the most benign and commonly accepted of homebrewing
practices. How was I to know that you had made a simple mistake (in your
original text you mentioned Ale yeast twice in two places, seemingly quite
consistent. I'd perhaps had thought it simply a mistake if in one case you 
had had it right and the other wrong, the contradiction indicating a typo, 
but your post seemed to imply that once again you were challenging something)
rather than being engaged in propagating some new found wisdom.


Sorry Jack, but for one who is constantly passing himself off as an expert
on things, continually contradicting folks, pushing his products and opinions 
as the one "true religion", you're gonna have to do a little better.
If you can't make a short simple posting and not get something as basic
as lager and ale yeasts confused why should anyone believe your opinions
about any other issue. Your credibility problem is your own, and not of my 
making....






On the subject of Jockey Box's, John Francisco was on the right track.
According to Dave Miller, the pressure needed is related to tubing material
and length. He gave quite an in-depth talk on this at the AHA Conference
this year. I believe that notes from the conference are available through
the AHA (and there is some discount prrio to October I seem to recall), 
which would include the necessary info to calculate the proper pressure
for your line lengths (this seems to be very system specific). Sorry I
didn't take notes, so I only have my recollections of the general content
of the talk to guide you to those notes.






Dave Ballard asks about metallic tastes in an IPA. I had often noticed
many otherwise fine beers entered in contests having this flavor. The initial
assumption was the kind of pot used, but talking with George Fix and reading
his fine book now leads me to think otherwise. George indicates that in
beers with high hopping levels and low water hardness apparent metallic
flavors arise. While I have not done independent testing to verify this
I would suggest your consulting George's Principles of Brewing Science.
Do you know the hardness of your water?? Do you add anything to harden
the water?? My suggestion would be to start looking there.




There are no brewpubs in Texas. In Dallas the place to go is apparently
the Gingerman (sorry don't know the address) if you're looking for beer
selection.


In the past I have had great success in drying my hops in the oven.
I turn it on to the lowest heat setting, apprtoximately 125F, set them
on foil or cookie sheets and leave them overnight. My understanding is
that hop growers use a similar temperature but do this in a ventilated 
room rather than an oven, but this technique has worked OK for me the
2 years I have used it.

Subject: Re: dryhopping


Keith asks about how long to dryhop.  I used to dryhop in the primary
as soon as the krauesen falls so the high-power fermentation does not
lift the hops into the blowoff tube and clog it AND because the large
volume of CO2 would scrub a lot of the bouquet out of the brew.  Then,
the beer would sit for two or three weeks in the primary until I was
ready to bottle (we're talking ales here, of course).  I noticed that
if I waited longer before bottling, I got less bouquet, so I decided to
try a new approach.  What I now do, is dryhop 7 days before bottling.
I wait for the fermentation to complete, dryhop, wait 7 days and then
bottle/keg.

Subject: Beer yeast and dogs


I changed the subject to "beer yeast" because "brewer's yeast" is a
VERY different product from the yeast we brew with.


I discovered the benefits to letting my dog (a 10lb Bichon Frise) tipple
a little when I was bottling one of my brews.


I was doing this on my porch, spilling (as we often do) some of the wort
as I was siphoning it into the bottles.  Fuzzball came by and started
licking up the spillage.


Before this, Fuzzball was VERY tasty to fleas.  After this, her flea problem
magically disappeared.  Since this was the only change to her diet, I knew
I'd come on to something.  Now whenever I open a bottle, I let Fuzzball have
the sediment.  She enjoys it, and as long as I drink enough :-), she doesn't
have fleas.

 I would be interested to know how long you soaked them.  I never bought new 
 ones but I have soaked them overnight in: bleach, 100% alcohol, vinegar, 
 baking soda, lie water and several other things which now escape me.  I can 
 still smell coke on all four of the ones I have.  One of them that was only 
 casually soaked in bleach and carefully flushed with water, all but destroyed 
 a batch of beer.  The taste of coke was so strong, the beer was barely 
 drinkable.
 
 >Additionally, since the o-rings are not in contact with the beer then
 the idea that even some minute residual odor will destroy the flavor
 profile of a malty beer seems very unlikely.
 
 I would be interested to know how you think the o-ring seals without 
 contacting the beer.  My guess is that at least 30% of the large one sealing 
 the lid is exposed to beer on the inside.

 Welcome to the club.  I used to let it sit for a week to carbonate before I 
 learned that shaking the hell out of it would do the job in 15 minutes.  
 However, I am curious to know why you invert the keg.  It seems like an 
 unnecessary exercise.

 Just, pray tell, what is "our temperature range"?  I am having a hard time 
 not being bored with all this talk of fridge temp controllers.
 
 Baderbrau ferments, ages and bottles/kegs their beer at 50F.  This is a high 
 quality pilsner lager and any fridge I have ever seen can maintain 50F with 
 no outside help.
 
 What am I missing?

 would be much too high a pressure for dispensing the beer.  Even
 if the beer got to spend a few hours at 50F, so much of the dissolved CO2
 would stay in solution when the beer finally came out of the faucet,
 the pressure drop may still cause it to foam a lot.
 
 I think I see the light.  Your jokey box is a big coil of copper tubing with 
 all the potential problems outlined above.
 
 Whereas, the cold plate is a very short run of very small gage tubing in a 
 killer heat sink.  This seems to have  enough advantages to make it worth 
 starting over:
 
 1.   Holds only 2 oz of beer.
 
 2.   One cup of cubes will chill a glass or two.
 
 3.   Narrow tubing simulates long run without holding a lot of beer.
 
 The point of (3) is that you can boost the keg pressure to properly carbonate 
 beer at room temperature and still dispense it properly.

 doing things, aren't there?
 
 You can go one step farther (closer) and use only 6 inches of tubing and a 4 
 X 6 inch piece of window screen, rolled into a tube and clamped on to the 
 tubing.  I have been using this since my first all grain batch and see no 
 reason to ever get any more complicated.  If anyone is interested, I have all 
 the bits and pieces and instructions on doing it in a posting called 
 Easymash.  Just email if you want it.

Subject: Oatmeal Stout recipe


Al Korz chastisted me for including a partial recipe for Oatmeal Stout
in HBD #924 (an article about mashing oats and other specialty grains).
To set the record straight here is the entire recipe:


7lb Great Western MAlting (GWM) Pale Malt. (e.g. 2-row pale/lager/ale malt)
1lb Huge Baird (HB) Roast Barley (also supplied by GWM)
1lb Rolled Oats from my co-op.
8oz HB light caristan (e.g. 15-20L crystal)


Entire brewing water supply (7gal) treated with 5gm gypsum and 1 gm chalk
(calcium carbonate).


Mash in with 8qt `at` 137f, target temp 123f.
After 30 minutes, step with 5qt boiling water, target temp 154f
Conversion done in 20 minutes or so.  Mash out at 168.
Sparge with remaining supply water to collect 6 gal
boil 60 minutes with 35gm chinook pellets (13% alpha) Est. IBU 67
OG with 5.5 gal of wort is 1.054
Chill, pitch 12gm dry whitbread ale yeast.
TG after 6 days `at` 68f was 1.020, 3.73 %w/w, 183 cal/12oz
Fine with 1/2tsp gelatine dissolved in water when kegging.


I kegged with 1qt of wort recovered from the kettle after chilling.
I strain out the hops/trub with a fine hop bag and can the wort to
preserve it until kegging time.  It would work just as well to force
carbonate or use priming sugar.  Don;t over do it.  Stouts are not
supposed to be fizzy.  Still, with all that Oatmeal, the head is
tremendous!  Get out a fork and knife when drinking :=)


This stout has a smokey aroma - probably due to the large amount
of roast barley.  Even though it has a lot of hops, it seems balanced.
I think that Oatmeal makes teh resulting beer quite sweet.  If served
too cold (say 45f or below) it will be quite bitter.  At 50-55 it 
is like nectar.  Sip, sip - writing this article gave me a thirst so
I opened up a bottle.  Mmm, good stuff.  I bottled the last gal or so
from my keg to make room for another beer...


Cheers!
