Subject: Re: cleaning bruheat boiler


I've mashed and boiled in an Electrim bin (similar to the Bruheat
boiler I think) for several years, and kept the element clean by
switching it OFF during the mash, with a couple of heavy blankets
wrapped round the bin to conserve the heat.  I preheat the liquor to
about 71F before pitching the malt (8 lbs in 3.75 UK gallons) and the
temp. falls to around 66F.  After 3 hours it's usually around 61F. I
don't do any starch tests, but the wort comes out nicely balanced for
a dry-ish bitter - 5 gals at OG 1042. 


I tried using a grain bag, but gave it up in favour of a perforated
round splashguard of the kind used to cover frying pans.  I found one
which was just the right size to sit above the heating element and
tap, supported by 2 upturned glass dishes! 


One other hint - after running off the boiled wort, cover the element
with fresh hot water before it's had a chance to dry.  You can then
rub off most of the crud very easily.  Afterwards I run the heater for
a minute or two in the fresh water.

Subject: Malto dextrine, wort chiller filter


Greetings all!


Does anybody know how much malto dextrin to use in a 5 gallon batch of beer?
I remember seeing this question raised in the HBD before, but I don't remember
if it's ever been answered.


I used some in a brown ale recipe to add a little sweetness.  The guy at the
homebrew store didn't have much experience with malto dextrine and told me to
add the whole 8 oz bag.  I chickened out and only added 4 oz, but the beer was
still a little sweeter than what I was looking for.  (Of course, I also added 6
oz of crystal malt to the same batch which probably added to the overall
sweetness...  Why only change one variable when you can mess around with 6 or 7?
;-)


So, what's the scoop?  Anybody else out there ever use this stuff?  Charlie says
that malto dextrine will also add body to the beer, but Miller basically
pooh-poohs that idea and claims that it will add sweetness only.  From the
limited conversation I've seen about malto dextrin here on the net, I get the
impression that most homebrewers look down their noses at the stuff and would
be less likely to add it to their brew than stink-bait (or even silicone
caulking ;-).

I've used the copper-coil-in-a-bucket-of-ice-water method to cool my wort a few
times.  I use a technique gleaned from this very digest to strain the hop
leaves:  jam the end of your racking wand into a copper choreboy scrubbing pad.
I take the added precaution of threading some wire through the choreboy and
twisting it around the racking wand so the darned thing doesn't fall off in the
middle of the transfer.  (Anybody ever had a choreboy slip off or am I just
making extra work for myself?)


This method has worked pretty well for me so far.  The choreboy has only gotten
completely blocked with hop leaves once and that was near the end of the
transfer anyway.  FWIW, I'm probably going to switch over to hop pellets
exclusively next fall; I found out that one of my favorite beers (Summit Extra
Pale Ale) is made with hop pellets and having used both, I find hop pellets
easier to use than flowers/plugs.  The upshot being that I won't need to use the
choreboy anymore.


BTW, if you use one of those plastic racking canes like I *used* to, you'll find
that the nearly boiling hot wort will soften the plastic and make it curl
slightly.  Then if you try to heat it back up to straighten it out, it will snap
in two.  (Gee Rocky, I guess I don't know my own strength...)

 10gal. H20 coolers
For those of you who have tried to find these and failed, here's what worked
for me.  I called Rubbermaid and they gave me the number of their regional
distributer, who in turn gave me the number of their local sales rep., who told
me not a single retailer in the area bought the product.  So, what I did, was I
marched down to my neighborhood harware store (True Value) and had them special
order one for me.  Once they located the micro-fiche that had the Rubbermaid
cooler products on it, there was no muss or fuss.  I expect to have it in my
hot little hands in a week.  The only drawback is that, they insisted on
charging me FULL retail on it because they had to special order it.  Wholesale,
they go for about $32, but I ended up paying about $65 including tax.  So, if
you go this route, try to negotiate the price down a bit.

Subject: extract vs. all-grain


   To add in a data point, my last 20 or so batches have been all-grain.
As a test, my most recent was from from extract only, 3.3 lbs. BME wheat
(which is 1/2 wheat and 1/2 barley) and 3 lbs. dried malt, with 4th
generation liquid yeast.  It's not bad, but it doesn't nearly compare
to the fullness and richness of the all-grain batches.  It also has that
stereotypical homebrew tang.  I'm afraid there really may be no going
back.
   Fwiw, the batch will sit untouched for a week.  I'm on a prescription
drug that has an effect similar to Antabuse, the drug given to alcoholics
that makes them very ill if they have alcohol.  Hopefully that extra week of 
cold conditioning will make the batch more palatable.  Certainly, a week of
homebrew "cold turkey" should work in its favor...

Subject: Chiller and Sparging


>From the replies to my question about saving water it seem to me that some sort
of recirculation is the best idea. I also think my flow problems will be helped
by some more height from the brew pot to my primary. I have had a number of 
replies about holding 30 to 50 gal. of water and using it later but I just don't
have that kind of room or that many buckets.


A question here,


Why does Mike McNally want go to 50 deg.F this seem to be overkill to me unless
he is making lagers. I cool to about 70-75 deg.F and then ferment in by basement
which in the summer stays at 70-75 even on the hottest days. With my last brew,
running hot wort through the chiller in bucket of ice water, I used three bags 
of ice. The resulting wort was at 70 deg.F. I have had some replies on counter-
flow chillers and for the same final temp we are looking at about 40 gal. of 
tap water.


Now on to the sparging question,


What is the difference between mash-out and sparging. I understood that if you
mash out at 170 deg.F you raised the temp of the mash to 170 deg.F and then
keep it at this temp for some time. With sparging you let the mash water drain
out as you add sparge water, trying to keep the water level above the grian
bed. How could it take 2 hr to run water sparge water through your grain bed
unless the sparge was stuck(set mash?).


My plan is:


- -- Fill my cooler with grain add hot water for a final temp of 155 deg.F


- -- Let this sit until conversion about 1-2 hrs. I'll use the iodone test


- -- Recirculate until the run-off is not cloudly.


- -- Run 170-175 deg.F water(sparging?) throught the grain bed keep the water 
   level about 1/2-1 in about the grain bed untill the run-off is not longer
   sweet or I reach my 7 gal. volume.


- -- Then proceed as usual


I believe I am using a single step mash at 150 deg.F with a 170 deg.F sparge
I won't be using a protein rest or a mash-out. Did I discribe this right?


The reason I want a little discussion about this is that lately I have become
confused about what people are doing and I need some help. It seems that
sometimes people say mash-out when they are really sparging and the other way
around.


As usual I would like to thank everyone for there help, I have learn more
here than with all the books I own.

Subject: Wort Chilling, Some chilling thoughts...


Before making my immersion chiller, I advocated using a 2.5 gallon jug of
bottled water at near freezing temp to cool the wort down to pitching temp.
This worked very well for about 10 batches.  I now use my new toy, which will
cool 3 gallons of boiling wort to 80 degrees F in about 15 minutes while using
only 15 gallons of tap water (at ~65 deg F).  BTW the whole thing only cost
me $25 to build.  I then add the same bottled water, but at room temp. to bring
to 5 gallons.  I seems to me that combining the two techniques would easily
allow for cooling to a reasonable lager pitching temp.


Another idea, though much more elaborate, is to send the cooling water through
a copper coil submerged in an ice bath before it gets to the wort.  This would
cool the water down to around 40 deg, based on my crude measurements of the 
heat exchange of my chiller.  This idea may best be described as a flight of
fancy, but I always did like the t.v. show "MacGyver".


I'm interested to hear comments on my ideas, in public or private :-)

Subject: All Grain Brewing.


A few years back I splurged and bought myself the AutoMash(tm).  I set 
everything up the night before, program the timer and set the delay and go
to bed.  When I wake up it the morning the AutoMash is purring away stirring
the grain with "Ready to Sparge!" on it's display.  I can do up to a 6 step 
mash if I so desire.  I really like it because it does everything for you.
No stirring, no monitoring the temperature.  The kettle has a water jacket
in which the heating element is contained.  This in combination with the 
propellers really keep the temperature consistent, eliminating hot spots.


It wasn't cheap but there are a lot of fellow brewers that are more than 
willing to donate a few dollars to use it for the weekend.  It didn't take 
long to make up for the initial investment.  


If I have any complaint about the device it would be the difficulty in 
getting the grain out after it is done.  With the water jacket and the grain
combined, the thing is very heavy.  I usually have to scoop the grain out 
using a pan and dump it into the sparging vessel.  A minor annoyance compared
to fully automatic mashing.

I use the following chart that I calculated out.  I don't
use burton salts since I have not a clue as to what proportions of
gypsum, salt and epsom salt are in it.


Gypsum (calcium sulphate dihydrate):
      62ppm/gm/gal Ca++
     147ppm/gm/gal SO4-


Calcium Chloride dihydrate:
      73ppm/gm/gal Ca++
     127ppm/gm/gal CL-


Calcium Carbonate (precipitated chalk):
     107ppm/gm/gal Ca++
     157ppm/gm/gal CO3--


For making IPA I use 14gm gypsum and 1.5gm chalk in seven gallons 
of supply liquor, of which 6 gals gets into the beer (5.5 gal after boil) 
 - that works out to something near 300ppm of sulphate.


Sorry I don't have volume conversions handy.  I have heard that 
one tsp is about 5 grams.  The best thing to do is get a cheap 
loading scale from a gun shop.  Or, if you have $50 to blow, 
there is a place in Vancouver BC that sells an electronic
scale.  I got one and checked it out; it is pretty accurate
compared to my triple beam.  I measured 5, 75 anmd
300 gram objects and it was within 2gm `at`300 and within a gm (
the resolution limit) in the lower ranges.


The place is NamTai and they can be reached at 1-800-661-8831.
It costs US $49 and that includes shipping.  I saw the ad for 
this scale in the Wall Street Journal several months ago.

Ah, that famous protein rest...  I have made a half dozen wheat
beers with 50:50 wheat to barley malt.  the last two I made I 
dispensed with the protein rest and saw no evidence of protein
induced chill haze.  Maybe I didn't chill it enough (48f).  But,
given what I know about US, in particular Great Western Malting, malts
I would say that protein rests for even wheat beers is a waste of
time.


Going out on a limb: the *only* time you need a protein rest is when
using unmalted adjuncts, in particular oats, wheat or barley.  And then
only if the adjunct is more than an ounce /gal of brew.  I.e. don't
worry if you are just adding 4oz as a heading agent.

It depends on the yeast I'm using, but I usually gun for 18-20 C. That was
with a flow-through chiller. (Beer in coils, coils in partially plugged
kitchen sink with cold water running). The output temperature depended on how
quickly I let the wort drain through the tubing: faster=hotter output. But
tonight I'm debuting a new counterflow chiller that I made yesterday. Can't

OK, I'll bite: why use the stainer gizmo if you're gonna put your
grain in a porous grain-bag anyway?


I use a set up similar to you two, but I have a large, round plastic
collander which fits snugly and seals tightly around the edges when
pushed to the bottom of the cooler. I wanted to avoid the grain bag
because when I first started mashing (with the Zapap lauter tun), much
of the sparge/wort ran down between the bag and the walls of the tun
- -- path of least resistance and capillary action I imagine; it avoided
the grain and gave a low extraction rate. Also, the collander fits
tightly enough that it doesn't budge when you dump all the grain or
mash onto it. (Remember to run some string through it so you can pull
it out, though!)


Your milage may vary, blah, blah, blah. :-)

        I have a question regarding dry hopping with hop plugs.  It seems the hop plugs
        are just a little too large to easily fit through the mouth of the carboy.  In
        the past I have attempted to break the plug in two by working it back and forth
        in my hands, which is no easy task (and probably an infection risk).  A knife
        did not seem to work too well either.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to
        how to get the hop plug easily into the carboy?  Thanks.


Sounds like you can just crush the plugs in the bag that it came in (with
a roller or a hammer) or put it in a (coffee) grinder. 
I usually use a funnel and the handle of a spoon to push the hops thru.

You're close, but you're missing one very important thing. Your solution would
be right *if* you were mixing zero degree water with your wort. However, you're
not just mixing zero degree water (and getting the cooling power of the water),
you're also mixing ice, which has additional cooling power. [Note 1] The cooling
power of water is referred to as the specific heat, C_p, which is


    C   = 1 cal / g C
     p
     
In other words, it takes one calorie to raise the temperature of one gram of
water one degree Celsius. [Note 2] The cooling power of ice (at 0 C) is referred 
to as the heat of fusion, H_ls, which is


    H   = 80 cal / g
     ls
     
In other words, it takes 80 calories to melt one gram of ice at 0 C into one
gram of water at 0 C. In addition, ice can exist at different temperatures, and
supercooled ice has a cooling power of roughly


    C   = .5 cal / g C
     p
 
How about an example for clarity. First of all, let's assume that the specific
gravity of water, wort and ice is roughly constant. That lets us work in terms
of volume instead of weight and doesn't add significant error. Then, assume
that we have five gallons of hot (100 C) wort and a tub full of 3 gallons of
ice at -10 C and 2 gallons of water at 0 C. Further assume that the specific
heat of the wort is the same as water, and calculate the final temperature of
the collection after it has come to a thermal equilibrium.  First let's do an
energy balance:


Wort                          Water

and...


245 = 10 T


T = 24.5 C 


Since we dropped some units along the way, we don't know what the number of
calories each contributed is, but we can determine the relative amounts of heat
transferred:


Wort       Water  Subcooled ice   ice    Melted ice water


377.5      -49    -15             -240   -73.5           = 0


You can see that the water helped, and the melted ice water and the subcooled
ice helped some too, but the majority of the cooling was done by the melting of
the ice itself. In fact, let's calculate just how much ice melting (not considering
the melted ice) it would take to cool 5 gallons of wort to room temperature
(about 20 C):


5 (100 - 20) + X (-80) = 0


X = 5 gallons of ice.


In fact, that's a good and easy thing to remember: you need as many gallons of
ice as you have wort in order to cool your wort 80 degrees C (and have 0 C ice
water left over). If your final water temperature is higher, or your ice was 
colder than 0 C, then you need less, of course.


Therefore, I think that the answer to all the water shortage problems is to trade
water for energy. Namely, freeze your water to increase its cooling power. Here's
a tip: Use old milk/OJ/whatever cartons to freeze blocks of ice for cooling. Then
rip off the cardboard for a good chunk of ice. It's not sterile, but if it doesn't
touch your wort, who cares?

Subject: All-grain mashing time


Here's my $0.02:


My brewing day is about 12-hours long, but in that time, my 
brewing-partner and I eat, drink and talk, with copious amounts of 
each.  Since I spend most of my time (like right now) sitting in front 
of a CRT, 12 hours of human contact is refreshing.  Were he unable to 
make it to a particular session, I do not think that I would do a 
three-decoction mash like I usually do; I would probably do something 
that takes only six hours or so.  My point is simple: brewing with 
someone else is more fun than doing it alone; it's also a little 
easier, as every now and then you need 4 hands.  Lastly, you may find 
it difficult to get someone to brew with; however, I dare say that most 
of us know at least one person who is "kind of interested".  Invite 
them over and/or offer to teach them how.  The world needs more brewers... :)

Subject: Blue stuff, pick-up tubes, o-rings, etc.


Some of this is dated.  Sorry.  The posting glut of a couple of weeks 
ago knocked me out of synch.  


As for the thread on the blue-stuff in copper wort chillers:


Mike sez:


>Based on my world-class understanding of chemistry, I'd guess that the
>blue stuff that forms on your copper wort chiller is copper sulfate.

Hate to butt heads with your world-class understanding of chemistry, 
Mike, :-) but the blue stuff ain't copper sulfate.  Copper sulfate 
is formed from trying to sterilize the copper with sodium 
metabisulphite and that's why treating copper with sodium met is 
generally discouraged.  And you're right.  You would definitely want 
to get rid of that stuff.  


In another post, Jeff speculates:


>Glenn asks about little blue flakes coming out of his wort chiller.

Well, since clorox doesn't contain acetic acid, I would doubt it's 
verdigris.  This does raise the question of whether cleaning copper 
with vinegar is a good idea since it IS acetic acid. 


I've noticed it in my chillers down through the years and have never 
worried about it.  I figured that since it was particulate matter that 
it settled out with the yeast and never made into a bottle of beer 
anyway.


Still I guess it is time to call out the chemists.  What is that stuff?  
Could it be the cause of my curly hair?  :-)

I use this same part in the construction of the BrewChiller.  I'll go 
out on a limb and sell these to anyone who wants them if you'll send 
send me a dollar bill, a 29 cent stamp and a self-addressed stamped

That may be all well and good, Donald, and it makes a nice 
intellectual argument but all I can say is that you should have  
tasted that nice Coca-cola lager I made about 8 years ago when I 
switched over to kegs.  Buy new O-rings.  And don't think twice about 
it.  It is definitely NOT a myth.  You can go ahead and put your next 
batch of all-grain into a keg with old o-rings.  But don't say that I 
and several others of us haven't warned you.  (I'm not trying to be a 
smart a**.  But you seem adamant about this and I don't want you to 
ruin a batch of beer.)


Tom Feller asks:

Don't solder the end of the tube closed.  Cut the end cap off and 
solder an inverted 3/4" copper cap on the end of the tube.  In effect, 
it does the same thing the little orange caps do on the plastic siphon 
canes.  It causes the wort to be sucked from above instead of from 
below.  Tie a copper wound, Chore-Boy pot scrubber to the bottom of the 
tube to filter out the hops.  In addition you can tie some mosquito 
netting or a fine-mesh hop bag around that to further improve the 
filter action. 


And finally, Mike asks:


>What temperatures do people normally shoot for when chilling?


Though I'm sure some would disagree, I shoot for 70 degrees when 
chilling.  According to Dave Logsdon at Wyeast, this is a very 
comfortable temperature for yeast and they show a dramatic increase in 
growth compared to even 60 or 65 degrees.  Then I take the fermenter 
to the basement (55 degrees).  By the time the wort reaches ambient 
basement temperatures the yeast have had a chance to bask for a while 
in 70 degree wort and are up and running.  To me, it seems to be the 
best of both worlds.

Subject: Answers to Bruheat questions




Brett Shorten asks about cleaning the Bruheat:


I've been using a Bruheat for 11 years and distributing them for 6.  
By far, the best way to clean the element is to use B-Brite.  After a 
round of making beer, rinse the bucket, fill it with enough water to 
cover the element, add a tablespoon or two of B-Brite and boil.  The 
white coating of sugar that is always on the element will float off in 
a minute or two.  If the element is already blackened, you may need to 
add more B-Brite and boil for a longer period of time, interspersed 
with some soaking.


I just discovered this last year and am amazed at how good a job B-
Brite does.  It's non-abrasive and keeps the element shiny clean.
BTW, it cleans the plastic bucket extraordinarily well, too.

Use Brillo pads or copper scrubbers only as a last resort.  They will 
scratch off the plating.  I find that this is only necessary when 
cleaning an element that hasn't been cleaned since God knows how long.  
Routine boiling with B-Brite should eliminate the need to ever use an 
abrasive pad.

The rubber washers were a big problem in one of the shipments I 
received a year or so ago.  They improved the quality in the last few 
shipments but even those aren't as good as the old black washers they 
used to use.  Those suckers lasted for years.  


Anyway, I've got spares.  Again, send me a self-adressed stamped 
envelope and I'll send you 3 or 4 for free. 


While we're on the subject, I rewrote the instructions for the Bruheat 
in the spring.  They're much improved over the old instructions.  The 
B-Brite routine is covered and, among other things, a trouble-shooting 
guide is included .  I know there are a lot of Bruheat users on the 
net so if you want a copy of the new instructions, email me and I'll 
send them to you. 


Whew!  Lots of talk about the Bruheat lately.  Norm writes:

I always advise transferring the goods to a separate lauter tun and 
sparging back into the Bruheat.  By doing this, you can be bringing 
the wort to a boil as you sparge.  This is a big time-saver.


Use a quart pot to ladle several quarts of the mash over to the lauter 
tun to take some of the weight from the Bruheat.  You can then pour 
the last bit of the mash over, give a quick rinse to the Bruheat, and 
start sparging back into it.  Fairly simple process, actually.


Cheers!

I've been using a Thorne-Electrim Bruheat clone for a while now, with
no real problems. I don't use a grain bag as such, but rather a square
metre of terylene netting which I knot under the handle. This
functions reasonably well, as it hangs down into the bin most of the
way to the element when full of grain. I drain and sparge directly
from the bin as well, which has the disadvantage of not freeing the
bin to heat sparge water but is otherwise convenient. 


The one observation I have made is that I need to use a lot of mashing
water. When I went according to the book (Wheeler) I got a miserable
efficiency, under 70%. This is presumably because of the free volume
under the grain. However, this week I brewed and used the ridiculously
high ratio of 4 galls (imperial, about 18 litres) to 7.5 pounds of
grain. This, and a careful sparge, resulted in my highest extraction
yet, about 89%. Wheeler suggests a thin mash results in a sweeter
beer; I'm waiting to see. (**Comments welcome**)


It's great for single-step mashing (I don't make lagers, but I imagine
a multi-step mash would be quite convenient). I heat the water to c.
72C, stir in the grain (tired arms!) and generally find the temp to
have dropped to c. 67C. I wrap a few old sweaters around the bin, and
that keeps the temp very solid, dropping no more than 2 deg. in 45
mins. It thus generally needs no more than one heating boost in a 1h30
mash (stir vigorously while heating!). 


Tip: when you're interested in raising the temperature, rather than
maintaining a boil or mash, bypass the simmerstat. This cycles on and
off even when below the desired temp, and really slows things down
when you're trying to get the boil started. I have an old kettle with
similar connections, so I use the lead from that: it'll bring the
spargings to a boil in little over half an hour.

 tubing or window screen over a pipe to filter the wort from the grain, I have

 looks like a flower with petals that unfold to double the diameter and that

 I can't help but wonder how messing (literally) around with a grain bag fits 
 into your "less work" equation.
 
 It seems to me that filling, installing, emptying and cleaning a grain bag is 
 far more work than hosing out a bucket or kettle with a built in strainer.  
 Of course you can reduce the work by using a new one each time but then the 
 cost goes up.
 
 Am I missing something?

Fellow Brewers,




Personally, I enjoy the discussion w.r.t. grain v. extract  brewing since
I am at a point where I have done both and enjoy both. Specifically
regarding extract brewing, I would like to know if any large or small
evaluation of extracts or extract kits has been undertaken? I am sure
that I can go through the Cat's Meow and come up with a top
five extracts by looking through the recipes but I sure would like
to survey people's opinions on:


1. Top ten extract kits (kind with yeast, already hopped, add sugar etc.)


2. Top ten extracts (hopped or unhopped versions)


3. Comments


I will be glad to post the results if brewers would send me e-mail 
privately. Use the e-mail address in the header. I think that this would
be a nice compilation in order to help out new brewers in the choice
of extract with which to start.

I apologise for not giving credits but I'm having a few problems with 
hanging on to HBDs once read. One person mentioned problems cleaning 
his Bruheat boiler and someone else recommended a grain bag but said 
take care not to melt it on the element.


A grain bag certainly works for me, I never have to give the element more 
than a good scrub with a pot scourer to bring it up bright and shiny. I've 
never had to dismantle the element either, though I've only done 10 or so 
batches with it so far. Furthermore the grain bag I bought specifically 
said that the bag was constructed of heat resistant materials which would 
not melt on contact with the element, provided it was covered with water or 
wort. I'd suggest looking out for one of these.


Someone else mentioned having to transfer the grains to sparge them, again 
not necessary if your mash tun (lauter tun? I'm British) has a tap at the 
bottom. When the mash has finished just crack open the tap and run sparge 
water in at the top as the wort runs out.


Lastly, anyone going to the Great British Beer Festival at Olympia, London,

In HBD 939, Pat sez:

You're right, trying to "cut" the plug with a knife doesn't work very well.  The


way I do it, is to put the plug (flat side down) on a cutting board, take a shar

STURDY knife and pierce the tip into the center of the plug.  I then bear down a

work the knife back and forth.  After you work the tip through the plug, about h

pieces with your hands.  I repeat, tho, use a sturdy knife since it can take a
considerable amount of leverage to work the knife through the plug.
