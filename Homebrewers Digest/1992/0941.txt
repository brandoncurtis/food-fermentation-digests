Subject: Counter Flow Chillers


hi all,


i have a problem with the volume of water required for utilizing
counter flow - i know of no other way around using one, so i need to
try and minimize the amount of water used.


what i have is 2 25 foot (1/2" copper inside 1" plastic hose)


        to cool the batch to 80 F - i have been typically using 1.5 times
        the wort in water.  the water is at approx 65-70 F. the hot water
        coming out is at approx 120 - 130 F.  Wort in at 200 - 210 F. i would
        like to use less water and get the temp of the wort lower.  i have
        seen other posts regarding water usage in the 3 times range. 


what i would like to know 


        1) would adding another 50 feet of chiller help get temp down to
                65-70 F range (water in) and also would it cut down the water
                usage?? i am assuming with the current set up the performance
                is a little low - hot water out is prehaps to cold??


        2) does anyone have the "rocket science" part - formula for modeling
                the flows(wort and water), lengths, temps.... etc?? 






thanx in advance

Maybe it is, but that can't be the ingredient that makes it a sanitizer.  I've 
always assumed that the active ingredient in B-Brite is Sodium Perborate, a 
form of active oxygen and the key ingredient in non-chlorine bleach;  in fact, 
I'm under the assumption that B-Brite *IS* just non-chlorine bleach, sans the 
perfume.


Does anyone know differently?

On this issue I have good and bad news to Mike, but good news to
everyone else using the "immersion in ice" type chiller where
the wort is siphoned into a copper coil which is 
immersed in ice water.  The bad news is that when phase changes
occur (solid ice to liquid water) the formula that Mike used,
which he derived from the averaging formula


    Vc*Tc + Vb*Tb = (Vc + Vb)*Tt                    (1)


is no longer valid.  


The good news is: the actual target temperature will be much lower
than prediced by (1) due to the latent heat required to change (melt)
32 degree F ice into 32 degree water.  For example, if you "mix"
equal amounts (by weight) of boiling water at 212 degrees (F) and
ice at 10 degrees (F) (a typical temperature inside a freezer) you
get water in equilibrium at about 52 degrees (F).  The formula
for computing the equilibrium temperature (assuming the equilibrium
state is liquid and the wort has the same thermal properties as water)
is 


   Tt = (Tb*Vb + (0.453*Ti - 73)*Vi) / (Vi + Vb)     (2)




where Vi and Ti are the volume and tempurature of the ice.
In this formula, 0.453 is the ratio of heat capacities  of ice to water,
and 73 is the value for the latent heat required to change ice
to water divided by the heat capacity of water. 
Of course, for equation (2) to have some validity, the ice will have
to be constantly stirred so that the equilibrium temperature
approximates what is actually occuring in the wort chiller.
Also, if you initially add water to the ice in your bucket, you
can approximate the effects by first modifying the volume and 
temperature of the "boil" (as if the water was added to it) using (1),
and then apply (2) with the modified values for Vb and Tb.
The bottom line is that you need only about 6  gallons of ice
to reduce the temperature of boiling wort to 50 degrees F.

My new arpartment only has an electric stove so I find myself in the market
for a "cajun cooker". Can anyone with experience with these devices make a
recommendation on performance, cost, availability, etc...?


I was at a garden party last weekend and got into a discussion on the
golden hops (not a brewing variety) that the owner was raising. He made a
comment that I thought might be of interest to all of the hop growers on
the net. It appears that when some varieties of hop vines are cut open, the
"sap" (for lack of a better word) can react with the sun. If the grower
brushes the hop vine with bare skin (ie, an arm) and doesn't wash off the
"sap", it can react with the sun light to cause a rather severe burn on the
skin (Maybe "photocaustic" is the right word, but I don't know for sure).
These burns can be very painful and can cause scars. It's not the kind of
thing that is going to happen immediately, though I have been told that
with some plants it can occur very quickly. It's probably early still to
start thinking about cutting down your hop vines, but I thought it would be
worth passing on the info. This isn't something to be paranoid about, just
be careful if you are like me and you don't wear a shirt when you spend the
day "cutting back" the garden during the final sunny days of the season. To
be on the safe side, though, I'll wear a long-sleeved shirt and gloves when
cutting down my hops in the future . . .

Subject: mill experiences




I brewed with grain crushed in my own mill yesterday for the first
time, and I'm pleased.  It may seem amazing, but I've brewed lots
of all-grain batches (maybe 30) and I've never had a mill.  On my
last two brews I crushed with a marble rolling pin (laugh away).


I have a Marga Molino, fitted with an extended hopper and an output
chute fashioned from some plastic scraps picked up at a local plastic
store.  It's fitted to a board with a hole cut through to match the
geometry of the chute.  The collection bucket is positioned on a shelf
below the hole.  I drove the mill with a 3/8" boring bit fitted to a
variable-speed power drill.


The crush took a little longer than I thought, but overall I did a
little over 10 pounds of grain in just under an hour.  For a
significant portion of the time I had the mill adjusted a little too
tight, so next time I'll probably finish a lot faster.


Even when the mill was too tight, the crush seemed very complete, much
more so than that achieved by my former source of crushed grain, the
Fermentation Settlement in San Jose (which is not to bad-mouth them).
The husks came through very nicely, most completely intact.  I did get
a lot of flower, but since the husks were there I didn't worry.  When I
loosened up the mill I noticed that I still got flour, but less.


At mash-in, several big starch clumps formed.  These I broke up with a
wire whisk with little effort.  The mash went fine and I had complete
conversion in a little over an hour.  Sparge was not unusual, perhaps a
little on the quick side.  When it ran clear, it ran *real* clear.


The best part was that my extract efficiency was *way* better than
before.  The OG of the five gallons was about 64, giving a utilization
of about 31.  Previously, I had never gotten better than maybe 27.


Thus, if you don't have a mill, get one.  The Marga is OK, and I'm sure
the MALTMILL is too.

Greetings fellow homebrewers...


Thanks to those who provided advice on drying hops.   I have
a further question..


     Is there any reason why I souldn't use freshly picked hops for brewing.
(eg. direct from the vine to the pot). Must they always be dried before
using.


Aside.... As a data point.   I live in Massachusetts and just harvested
my Centennial hops this weekend. I planted them in April (1 vine) and picked
about 2/3 of them ( 1/2 pound). My Mt Hoods are just starting to cone now.


Thanks in advance......

the word that professionals give to a properly carbontated beer that
tingles on the tongue a little. My interpretation of mouth feel up 
to this point was more a measure of body.  My question is: does
mouth feel refer only to carbonation and its sensation?






        Hmm, for myself and other judges I know of these are both
        correct, i.e. mouthfeel is a measure of smootheness and fullness
        of the beer, and how well blended the carbonation is. In other
        words how the beer feels in your mouth. This is a complex
        sensation, and comprises an interplay of the factors of body 
        and carbonation (poor carbonation feels prickly or sharp
        and "bites" at your tongue).

        Dry hopping, a different approach. I have recently begun
dry hopping my beer after fermentation and after kegging. I take my
beer filter canister and a cheap ($2) 5 micron filter put the filter
in the canister and shove 1\2oz of aroma hops into the canister around
the filter. I then use CO2 to push the beer thru the hop filled filter
into another keg. IMHO this gives a very noticable hop bouquet and 
adds no bitterness, it also eliminates some of the messy problems
that occur with normal dry hopping methods.
======================================================================
        All grain brewing. I do it because its way way cheaper
than using extracts. Malt extracts at retail prices are about $3
per pound in my area, I pay about 21 cents per pound for barley 
malt. As for the time it takes, my brewing equipment is semi-auto 
mated, but even with that I see about 4-4 1\2 hours for a 16 gallon
batch. Most of that time does not require my presence, I pop into
the brew house for the mash in, go eat breakfast, come back for the 
mash out and sparge ( the sweet wort is being pumped into the kettle
as comes out of the mash tun) as soon as a boil is achieved I leave
again come back in an hour make hop additions, for the rest of the 
boil the only times that I go near the kettle is to add hops. I do 
clean up the mash tun and prep the primary fermenter during the 
boil time but doesn't take much. I usualy get a lot of yard work 
done while brewing.

Subject: N-A, The Secret


 
 To: Homebrew Digest
 Fm: Jack Schmidling
 
 Cynic that I am, while pondering the discussions about low alcohol yeast and 
 exotic processes used by the majors to produce low alcohol beer, I took the 
 insipid taste and total lack of beer character this stuff has as a major clue 
 to the secret.
 
 Having two gallons left after kegging a batch of stout, I added one "exotic" 
 step to my N-A process.
 
 As a review, I heat the ready-for-bottling beer to 170F (uncovered) and hold 
 it there for 30 minutes.  I then let it cool (uncovered) to 150F at which 
 point it is below the Pasteurization temp and must be covered and cooled for 
 bottling or kegging.  I then tap this into a keg and cool it in a bucket of 
 running water.  When room temp I force carbonate it.
 
 According to Jeane Hunter's gas chromatograph tests on samples I sent to her, 
 this results in about 1.3% alcohol.
 
 The "exotic" step I added to this batch was to add a gallon of WATER prior to 
 kegging.   
 
 We had it last night with pizza (on beer bread crust, of course) and Marilyn 
 and I agreed that it was the best N-A we have made to date.  It has a nice 
 creamy head, tastes like stout with just a hint of coffee from the roasted 
 barley.  The N-A usually takes about a week to lose the cooked taste for the 
 heating but this stuff tasted great after 24 hours.
 
 I have little doubt that another gallon or two of water would still leave us 
 with more flavor and beer character than the stuff from the majors and reduce 
 the alcohol well below the .5% level required of N-A.
 
 I also have little doubt that this is the expedient the majors use to achieve 
 the low alcohol level.
 
 The addition of water not only reduces the alcohol level but obviously also 
 the calories.  It reduces the body and total character but the basic "taste" 
 is not lost and off flavors are of course, reduced as well.

Subject: One gallon mead?




I have been thinking of making a one-gallon mead from a Leatherwood honey
(made in Tasmania) that my housemate brought home.  I have a package of
Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast that consistently yields me good results
in larger batches - but I'm questioning the wisdom of dumping that entire
package into one gallon of water/honey.


Meanwhile, I have in a secondary in my basement five or so gallons of 
mead that has been inactive for at least three weeks.  It's looking 
very clear, yet I was thinking that maybe I could take some of the mead
from that carboy and dump it in the one galloner.  Would the inactive yeast
from that mead work in this new environment?  Or is this a bad idea?


Maybe I should re-hydrate the Red Star package and dump some of it in the
one-gallon carboy? I could get a mason jar, sterilize it, and put the 
majority of the yeast in that in my fridge.


While I'm at it - does anyone have a yeast strain they like that they
could recommend?  And I don't mean something that one of you chemistry
goons made up on your research grant :-)  I'm looking for some commercial
alternatives that I can get.

Subject: Diacetyl Rest question


Does anyone have any parametric experience with diacetyl rests and
has a good handle on what limits should be respected?
I seem to recall from the Practical Brewer, that temperatures in the 
range of 60-65f reduce diacetyl quickly to very low values.


I have a lager that has mostly fermented out at 48f.  I have moved it
to my Ale fermentation box (e.g. the laundry room) and it is around 62f.
Since it is mostly fermented out I am not too worried about excess
ester production while the yeast completes the fermentation.  After it
completes fermentation I plan on kegging, carbonating and lagering at
40f for a month or until it clears.


Oh, I am using a Pilsner Urquell D yeast.  I don't know anything more 
about it than that.  


Thanks!

Subject: Querying the experts


Hate to do it folks, but its amateur chemistry time again. First, the reasons
behind head retention. Miller states that proteins reduce surface tension of
CO2 bubbles, thus facilitating retention. This piece of reasoning was also
repeated in a recent Zymurgy article. This doesn't sound altogether intuitive
to me. Also, I distinctly remember a physics class in which we added detergent
to water in order to reduce its surface tension; yet detergent is the nemesis
of head retention. So what gives?


Secondly, Rajotte (in "Belgian Ale") and formation of higher alcohols. He makes
a rather vague claim that yeast activity increases said alcohols, therefore
oxygenation of the wort prior to pitching reduces same. From my reading of Fix,
I understood the opposite to be true. I presume there are complex interactions
between a variety of factors such as yeast strain and health, free nitrogen,
temperature, specific gravity, fructose content, fat content and dissolved 
oxygen, so is it possible to state a general rule? I seem to remember one of
the Beer Hunter episodes in which a brewery used a technique to promote the
formation of fusel oil late in the fermentation, whereas Rajotte seems to be
more concerned with what happens during respiration.

For Brewers in the New Hmpshire Seacost area there is a new homebrew
supply store that I found in Portsmouth NH. It's called the Olde Port
Brew Haus and is located on Islington street across from Plaza 800.
They have a medium-small selection of mostly extract brewing supplies
with some bulk grain. They're just starting up and seem to be open so
suggestions. The first time I went in I mentioned that they should have
something and the next time I went in they had stocked it. 


The bes thing about this p[lace is their prices seem about 10% BELOW
most other stores in the area. I don't know if they do mail order but
their phone number is (603) 430-8904. Give them a call and find out.


No I donn't own stock or anything like that - just like their prices.

        Hi All,


        In HBD# 940, Tom Feller asks:


>What is the difference between mash-out and sparging. I understood
>that if you mash out at 170 deg.F you raised the temp of the mash
>to 170 deg.F and then keep it at this temp for some time.


        That's a pretty accurate description of mash out.  It's done to
stop enzyme activity and to help avoid a set mash.


>How could it take 2 hr to run water sparge water through your
>grain bed unless the sparge was stuck(set mash?).


        Two hours seems a little lengthy to me as well, but it is
certainly possible.  My first all grain batch, I set the tap on
the lauter tun for the merest trickle, i.e., if I just nudged it
the runoff would stop entirely.  Two hours of sparging later, the
runoff still measured around 1.053.  Anxious to get on with it, I
opened the tap, and ran the remainder of the sparge water through
quickly.
        I've done a half dozen batches since then, each time increasing
the runoff rate and carefully recording the SG and final volume.
At the moment, I'm averaging 5 gallons sparge water through 9-10
pounds of grain in just under one hour, and still getting 30-32
points/pound/gallon.  The plan is to keep increasing the runoff rate
until I see a significant dropoff in extraction, in an attempt to
achieve a good time/quality tradeoff.
        I mention this because of the recent thread regarding sparge
times.  I think it's interesting that the times reported by other
net.brewers vary so much.  Anyone else out there drawn this sort
of correlation between sparge time and extraction?


>My plan is:


>Fill my cooler with grain add hot water for a final temp of 155 deg.F


        This is single step infusion mashing, works well with highly
modified malts.


>Let this sit until conversion about 1-2 hrs. I'll use the iodone test


        Using iodine is a good practice, you want to be sure conversion
is complete.  I suspect it won't take 2 hours for conversion though,
especially with highly modified malt.  I'd start iodine testing at
45 minutes to 1 hour.


>Recirculate until the run-off is not cloudly.


>Run 170-175 deg.F water(sparging?) throught the grain bed keep the
water level about 1/2-1 in about the grain bed untill the run-off is
not longer sweet or I reach my 7 gal. volume.


        I use both the hydrometer and the taste test to determine when to
quit sparging, and have found that the taste of tannin first becomes 
noticeable around 1.020.  At about 1.015 - 1.010, there is no longer
any detectable sweetness, this is when I stop.  Surprisingly, these
three events (no sweetness in runoff, 1.010 on the hydrometer, and
full pre-boil volume achieved) all seem to occur at just about the
same time.


>Did I discribe this right?


        You did, and you're on the right track, your plan looks good to
me, should work just fine.

Hi everyone,


I just started using plugged hops on my last few batches, and in my
enthusiasm I just have to add my $.02.


I break up the plugs quite easily with a pair of sharp kitchen shears.
Rather than slicing it into pie-like wedges, I take advantage of the 
"cleavage planes" within the compressed plug. I have found you can start
a notch in the side of the plug, then peel it apart into two thinner
plugs (of course, the same can be accomplished by inserting a thin, sharp
knife into the side and twisting a little). Once it is in thinner
sections, you can easily fold (tear if you prefer) the layers and stuff
them in the carboy. Other than fresh hops, nothing beats the smell of
those inner plug layers.


I just get the sections small enough to fit in (with a little force) the
carboy. After just a few days in the secondary, the hop plug separates the
rest of the
way by itself.


Gee, and I couldn't understand why all the "dull" postings on breaking the
inner seal of a Wyeast package!  Just goes to show you: Given the proper
context, any tidbit of info can be significant.

Subject: Tun in Again


I can see the advantage of a lauter tun separate from my Bruheat mash tun /
boiler (starting the boil in parallel with the sparge).  My question is this:
If I use a grain bag in my Bruheat will it support the entire weight of, say,
10lbs of wet grain (how much would this weigh?)?  I'd like to pick up the
entire mass of wet grain and place it into the lauter tun in one easy step.
What I don't want to do is rip open my grain bag and drop (pour?) the goods
onto my kitchen floor (likely resulting in happy dogs and an unhappy wife).
I suppose I'm just being lazy, but then "laziness is the father of invention".

I've gotten several pieces of mail about chilling to 50 degrees.  Most

I chill to a low temperature because I want a good break and I want to
let the break settle for several hours (overnight).  The low temperature
improves the cold break *and* reduces the probability of contamination.
I don't have any means of refrigeration other thatn the chiller which
will drop the temperature so effectively.


I like to ferment at 60-65 degrees anyway.  I've had mixed results with
the beers I've fermented warmer than that.

In his talk on wort chillers at the Conference, Jeff Frane said the most
enlightening (to me) fact of the whole conference: that cold break begins
at 65F.  Wow!  Since then, I've been chilling down to 60F with my immersion
chiller, waiting a half hour or an hour for the cold break to form and then
running very warm water through the chiller to bring the wort back to
pitching temperature.  Note that this is also possible with a counterflow
chiller and the coil-in-bucket chiller, but you must siphon twice.  I need
to use only very warm water because although my chiller outlet hose is
PE and can withstand a lot of heat, the inlet hose is only PVC and melted
once when I ran 140F water through it (it buldged out and then burst like
a bad radiator hose).

Simply put, mash-out is the final act of mashing.  By boosting the heat of
your mash to 170-175F and holding for about five minutes, you effectively end 
starch conversion.  After mash-out you can begin the recirculation process
and then move on to sparging.  Some eschew the mash-out, just as others prefer
not to use a protein rest.  If you're happy with your results, that's cool, but
I recommend both steps.  But the fact of the matter is, there should be no
confusing mash-out and sparging -- they are definitely NOT the same thing.

Subject: Malto-dextrine


I am certainly not the final authority on brewing, and most of my 
knowledge is still based on reading rather than experience.  This 
disclaimer aside:


I did an experiment at home to see what the results of using malto-
dextrine and lactose would be in terms of flavor, mouthfeel, and
added gravity.  Two one-gallon batches of water were prepared, one
with a cup of MD, the other with a cup of lactose.  Both were boiled
and cooled.


Both added substantially to mouthfeel.  The malto-dextrine added 
nothing at all in terms of flavor, while the lactose added a very
slightly sweet taste--really rather mild, but noticeable.  Each
raised the gravity of one gallon of water from 1.000 to 1.014.  If
I'm not mistaken, this rise in gravity consists entirely of unfermentabe
sugars, and would therefore remain after fermentation is complete.


As for use of these, I'm still experimenting.  My philosophy at the 
moment is that both serve as extract-brew equivilents of dextrine
malt.  Armed with the gravity results above, I therefore use the
malto-dextrine to supply the same number of gravity points as
the desired amount of dextrine malt (1/2 pound of dextrine malt
is pretty common, with a whole pound for fuller, more substantial
beers).  I don't have my notes here, but this comes out to about
1/2 or 1 cup of the above.  I've seen recipes here on HBD that
use as much as 14 ounces of lactose.  


If I'm doing something wrong here I'll be glad to be corrected--
I hate wasting beer!

Subject: lauter/mash tuns


Crhis Shelton asks why use a strainer/steamer if a grain bag is also being
used. Although I have not experimented without both the steamer and bag, the
theory is this: the steamer raises the level of the grain above the drain
(which is set into the side of the tun) so that as the grain is sparged the
sparge water drips from the grain bed with a horizontil cross-section
equivalient to the daiameter of the tun and then collects beneath the steamer
and flows to the drain; the grain bag provides a finer filter for the bottom
of the grain and generally keeps the grain bed together to make clean up
easier. Not using the steamer may lead to plugging the drain and not using the
grain bag might lead to grain falling through the steamer and flowing through
the drain.


A collander filter in the bottom of the tun probably does much the same thing
as I have described, but I would guess clean up is tougher than with a grain
bag. With the bag, I just lift out the grain, set in in the sink to finish
dripping and carry it out to the garden. Since I am keeping the sparge water
to within a half inch of the top of the grain bed to keep it afloat, I have
not had a problem with sparge water running down the side of the tun and not
sparging the grain. At least I think I do not have that problem.




Another reader aske whether a grain bag really makes it easier to clean up,
since the bag has to be emptied and washed and what not. Putting the grain bag
in the tun takes about 15 seconds and removing the grain in the bag less time.
Rinsing out the tun after removal of the bag is quicker than it would be if
the bag were not used, I think, since there is less grain to rinse out and
cleaning the bag consists of dumping the grain in the garden, turning the bag
inside out and rinsing it for a minute or so in the sink. I have not been
sanitizing the bag as it is nylon and the wort does get boiled. I do not think
this is a big deal, and makes it easier to move the grain out--but the $7 for
the bag might not be worth it to everyone.

So, what is an appropriate pitching temperature for Lagers?  I have 
seen brewers go through extreme lengths to make sure both the pitching
yeast and the wort are at fermentation temps (e.g. 48f) and I have
seen others (yours truely) just chuck the yeast (room temp or refer
temp) into the wort that comes out of the chiller (~65-75f).  Both
work fine.  In fact it would appear that my RDWHAHB method
works better since the yeast goes through the lag time faster due 
to the higher temperatures.  Of course, by the time the yeast gets
really going, my beers are at 48f (~6-24hr depending upon the quality
of the starter).

You're right about the difference between mash-out and sparging.  There are
two reasons for mash-out that I can think of: 1) stopping conversion (in
some cases, as when making a highly dextrinous wort, you may want to stop
conversion before all the dextrins are converted to fermentables) and
2) raising the temperature of the *grain* to 170F so the sugar flows more
easily away from the husk material (this way, you don't use sparge water to
warm the grain and the grist stays at 170F (or as close to it as your
insulation allows) for the entire duration of the sparge).


A 2-hour sparge does sound excessive, but too fast a sparge will also
lower your extraction efficiency.

I use a Gott cooler with a copper tube with slots in the bottom.
The grain bag gets set into it when dry, and tied down around the cooler top.
Then I add water and grain, alternating and stirring. The grain bag really
is no problem. In fact I think it makes cleaning a little easier.


When I'm done I can carry the cooler out to the compost pile, lift
the grain bag out, and invert it to dump out the grain. Then I simply rinse
it and let it dry.


I certainly wouldn't say it makes things any harder, and perhaps makes
cleanup a little easier. While I know plenty of folks who use a collander
or vegetable steamer false bottom and no grain bag approach with good results,
using the grain bag what and slotted pipe combination as I have also
works fine.
