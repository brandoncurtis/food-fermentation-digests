Yeas, Andy.  Flaked grains are already gelatinized in the "flaking" process
(grians are steamed and then rolled) and do not need to be cooked before
introducing them into the mash-tun.  Raw grains need to crushed/cracked and
cooked to break up the starch globules to allow the enzymes gain access.


So it sounds like you don't have a problem.  More info on the cooking process
can be had in books like M&B Science or the Practical Brewer.

I have noticed that SN porter is smoother, creamier, better balanced than
other porters I have tried (or brewed).  Does anyone have a recipe (grain or
extract) for a SN porter like brew?  Any clues as to how to get that 
creamy taste?

It depends whether you are concerned about thermal expansion/contraction.
That is, beer and glass rates being different and glass being breakable.
But I agree with what Jack implies, which I take to be that O2 in the
headspace is probably not a problem for bottled conditioned beers. Stay
relaxed with the hobby. Remember there isn't much O2 up there, yeast is
a good 'scavenger' of O2 whilst growing and it will probably use it all
up during the first few days of bottle conditioning anyway.


Unless, of course, someone else knows better :-)

 RE^2: chillers
In #947, Mr de Armond says:

First, the siphoning in the counter-flow chiller, under standard operating
procedure, refers to the siphoning of the wort through the inner tube of the
chiller, not the outer tube through which tap water is driven.  So in both
cases the coolant is being driven by pressure.   Aside, with a long enough
siphon you can develop some pretty good pressure.  Ever empty a waterbed, on
the fourth floor, with a garden hose dropping all the way to the ground? :-)


Second, I beleive that the velocity in question is the velocity of the wort
relative to the coolant, or cooling element.  This leads me to beleive that the
wort being siphoned through the counter-flow would have a greater velocity than
the wort in which the immersion chiller is immerged.  And since the heat
transfer rate is proportional to velocity, the tubbing length of the immersion
chiller would have to be greater.  Of course if you stirred very vigorously,
the wort in the pot (immersion) may have a greater velocity.


I am the proud owner of a counter-flow chiller that works extremely well (read
fast), though I admit is a water hog.  I think that each type of chiller has
its own points.  I love the fact that mine works so fast, but on the other
hand, I don't like that it can't leave all that cold-break in the brew-pot,
instead of my primary, like an immersion chiller would.

We may not have brewpubs (it's called the "Budweiser law") - but we do have
pubs that engage in "tap wars".  Frontrunners in the tap race are the Brewery
Tap in the oldest part of downtown historical district and LeVeau's in the 
museum district.  They each have around 40 to 50 brews on tap.


I-10 & Hwy 6 is not exactly happenin' central.  The only good place I know of
in the vicinity is the Hops House at 2321-A Hwy 6 S., 496-0623.  The best 
places are around Rice University:  the Gingerman, Munchies, Churchill's (at the
Red Lion Restaurant), McGonigle's Mucky Duck, Crown & Serpent, LeVeau's and 
several others.  All have Sierra Nevada on tap - my minimum requirement.
 
Beer Central is at DeFalco's Home Wine and Beer Supplies, 5611 Morningside, in
the Rice Village, 1 mile south of Hwy 59, Greenbriar exit, 1 block west of 
Greenbriar near University Blvd.  Greenbriar borders the campus.  Just walk 
into DeFalco's and ask where you can get a decent beer in this town, and you'll
be deluged with suggestions.  Their number is 523-8154.  Hours are 10-6 M-F, 
'til 8 Thurs, plus 10-4 Saturdays.
  
The Foam Rangers Homebrew Club meets the third Friday - 8/21 - it gets pretty 
wild - there are often other club activities.  Call DeFalco's for info.
Tell 'em I (John Adams) said "Hi!".  I live near the Astrodome + that's the

Subject: Mashing from Micah Millspaw




Adding to the mash discusions. I suggested the use of the insulated 
cooler type mash tun because it can be used with both single temp. infusion
mashes and upward step infusion mashes. It is a simple thing to increase
the mash temperature by adding more hot water at the time it is needed
for the step increase. The mash out can be conducted the same way. This
approach to mashing is a part of the gentle mash that can reduce the
effects of hot oxygen reactions. By way of explaination, I start the mash
fairly tight 20-24oz per lb. and add sufficiently hot water to make the
temperature steps I want without exceding 32oz per lb grain to water, for
a normal mash. For a first run only mash I use up to 48-50oz per lb.
Also no stirring as the hot water is either underlet or sprayed or both
at the same time. My mash\lauter tun is loaded with temp. probes and it
works very well. I have been mashing in this way for the past four years
and have many ribbons to show for it. Also it is easy and I'm lazy.

  I just moved to a plavce which has an apple and a crab-apple
tree.  The apple tree should produce some nice, big, red
apples.  right now they're medium sized and dropping like flies.
They are actually edible, but quite tart.  Should I try to save
these (perhaps by freezing) for cider?  Also, can crab-apples
be pressed in your usual apple press (i plan to rent one).


  Is there some measure of acidity by which i can guage my addition
of immature and crab-apples.  I have no idea of what kind of apples
this tree produces, so the cider mixture percentages published
in my cider book are of no help to me.

Subject: malt prices


In HBD #947, Brian asks about malt prices.  $0.95/lb in 55 lb quantities is
high.  Try a friendly micro-brewery if one is nearby.  One of our locals will
sell any of the grains they use to homebrewers in just about any quantity for
$0.50/lb.  That's OK if you want to use Briess lager malt and specialty grains,
but then sometimes beggars can't be choosers.  I know that at that price, the
micro is still making money.  Their only caveat is that you call ahead and make
sure it's not brew day or bottling day when you want to stop by, and I wouldn't
go in and ask for only one pound.  The folks in our club who take advantage of
this deal usually coordinate their purchase and buy in full sack quantities.
This place will even run the grain thru their roller mill for a small fee. (a
couple of bucks per sack)  I've heard that many micro's will do this as long as
you don't interrupt them when they're busy.  You can still get your specialty
grains from your local HB, so as not to p*ss them off.


One the *really* high side, there's a local shop (left over from the Wine-Art
days) which gets a lot of first-time homebrewers/winemakers.  This shop asks
$3.95 for a one-pound bag of pale malt!  They buy it pre-packaged from Wines,
Inc.  The other shop in town is at least smart enough to buy in bulk (or go in
with the micro on pallet loads) and break stuff down into 1, 5, and 10 lb bags,
and charges a reasonable price.  Guess who gets the repeat business??

   If you are near the denver area, and have some hops which
grow well in our climate, I would like to be able to take a 
few cuttings.  please.  i will not harm your plants in any way.
All i should need is a leaf or two... or perhaps the tip of
new growth on a vine.... only a couple of cm worth.  you
won't get any yield from new growth from now this year anyway.


   thanks in advance,

I don't know much about wheat allergies, but I do know about beer.
The turbidity in a hefeweizen is from yeast, not wheat; both hefe
and klar beers are filtered.  I would predict that if one causes an
allergic reaction, so will the other (unless the B vitamins in the
yeast counteract the allergy).


Most beer doesn't have wheat in it anyway, so a doctor who advises
against "most beer" is not beer-aware.

Wow! You guys are really advanced.  I've just browsed through two issues
of Homebrew and I'm lost.  I need some advice for a total novice (don't
laugh, you have to start somewhere)?


My roommate and I were given one of these homebrew kits, so we gave it 
a whirl.  Of course, we didn't know the importance of proper sanitation and
the first batch was contaminated ("This is the best wine I've had in a long
time").  For the next, we properly sanitized a bottled-water carbuoy and
made the second kit with the indicated amount of sugar.  Sure enough, the
beer was good, but had a 'caramelly' flavor.  So a friend told us to use
no sugar and double malt extract.  This gave great results with a rich,
lager-style beer.  Our friends were baffled by the Old Milwaukee labels
and Tab caps ("I got 'em 'cause they were cheap.").


Any suggestions why this works with the double malt?  Any other suggestions?


Thanks!

A month ago I did my first all-extract/no-mash brew since I switched
to all-grain/mostly grain a year ago.  (Well, there was the brewferm
lambic kriek kit batch, but that doesn't count).  Anyway, I boiled the
full amount vigirously for an hour before adding any hops, and then
added fuggles/goldings over the next hour.  I cooled with an immersion
wort-chiller, and got a good 1.5" of hot break in the bottom of the
carboy, the same I usually get with all-grain.

I think you've hit the nail on the head with the oxidation comment...


Anyway, the batch had a 4 lb edme strong ale kit, 4 lb of unhopped
amber extract, and 2 lbs of lt. brown sugar in it.  hops were:
1 oz goldingss leaf (old), 1 oz fuggle leaf (old), 1 oz fuggle
pellets (fresh), about 1/3 of each at 60, 40, & 20 min.
I also added 1/2 tsp of netmeg at the finish, and 1/2 tsp irish moss.
Edme ale yeat (wyeast belgian ale starter went bad, & I coldn't find
the packet of whitbread ale yeast I thought I had).  OG 1.071, FG 1.013.
I siphoned off the hot break into another carboy like I usually do,
then aereated and pitched.  I left it in the primary for 3 weeks,
at room temp (80F+).  I bottled with 140 g corn sugar, and another
re-hydrated packet of edme ale yeast, since the alcohol content is
pretty high.


I tasted it last night after a week in the bottle, and it seems
to have developed a decent amount of carbonation already.
It's got an alcohol nose to it, plenty of body, balanced by more
than enough fuggly flavor, which blends into the nutmeg/brown sugar
(the former is fading rapidly) sweetness, which fades again into hoppiness,
leaving a clean palate.  Lets see, that's 5 different sensations, at
different times, and I'm quite pleased.  Once you taste it, you have
to drink more - I only took sips, but I never sat the glass down until
it was empty!  A (non-homebrewing) friend came over, I poured him a glass,
and it too was empty before it touched the table.  Anyway, it's better
than many (but certainly not all) of my all-grain batches.


I had expected a FG in the 1.025 range, and consequently overhopped.
(The year old hops were quite a bit fresher than I thought, since
they were vacuum-packed.)  Obviously, I didn't caramelize it
much in the boil, or the FG would be higher than 1.013.
Aging should mellow it, and do it good.


If you do a full boil, you don't have to worry as much about
caramelization.  I seem to remember from Miller that 2.5 gal of 
1.100 wort will caramelize 4X as much as 5 gal 1.050 wort, and
will be twice as caramelized when diluted to 5 gal.


Boil the heck out of it...

Actually it wasn't a bore at all and there wasn't much repeating of the same
old tired lines from popular books.  This was a great forum for discussing
the various techniques people have discovered that work better or somehow 
disproved what was printed in the books.  Everyone would try the changes and
report back what they thought and how it went.  It was a very constructive 
process.  The 'experts' on the list played more of a mentor role offering what
they knew and what they experienced to be taken at face value.  It was up
to the reader to decide if they would like to take the advice or try something
that better fit their way of brewing.  


Then there were the many humorous brewing accounts frequently posted by people
such as Florian Bell.  Florian has his own way of doing things and it works 
for him.  Unfortunately Florian doesn't post much any more and much of that 
'Entertaining' flavor of the digest has long since disappeared, being
replaced by the more forceful 'technical' brewers who seemed to have this 
unrelenting drive to *make* you understand why they are *right* and others are
*wrong*.  


I think the "problem" is that people think that everyone brews for the same
reason. They can't imagine anyone not having the same motivation for
brewing.  Some people brew to accurately reproduce specific styles, some 
people brew to make a beer they enjoy drinking, some people brew because 
they like the brewing process.  Each of these people will have a different
way that is right for them or works for them. Now, it seems, that one has to 
risk public ridicule if they post their experiences even though it may not
be 'technically' correct.  I, like many, feel it's not worth it.  I get 
enough of that crap at work and my brewing is intended to help me relax from 
that.

   No, it sounds like the forum for discussion about home brewing
   topics, that it is supposed to be. People thinking for
   themselves will only add new or different perspectives to the
   discussion. They won't add flames. There is no reason to attack 
   someone personally because of their view on a particular
   topic. After all, this is a home brewing forum, not a
   presidential election :-). 




    On to more important topics:


   I brewed a wheat beer which should be done aging this
   weekend. This week, four bottles decided to break. To prime, I used 
   one gallon of sweet wort that I drew off before pitching. The other
   bottles seem fine so I don't think I overcarbonated (over
   primed?) and the gravity levels were right on target. I guess
   its time to be a little more selective about the bottles I use for bottling.
   The ones that broke tended to be a little thinner than most of
   the others. 


   Wheat beer tends to have more of a head than most other beers.
   Whats the cause of this? Do these beers have a higher CO2
   content causing the head (and breaking bottles)? Julius Echter
   bottles are pretty heavy - probably a good reason for that!




   Saturday night, Lobster, Steamers, & fresh Wheat beer... can't wait.

 I was referring to the standard practice of nursing along a batch of wine to

 The sugar is added during the late stage of fermentation.  If all the sugar 
 is added at the beginning, it can OD the yeast and stick or worse yet if you 
 miscalculate, the yeast dies and the wine is too sweet.
 
 The practice is to start with a gravity that you know will ferment out and 
 then add sugar in small increments each time fermentation ceases until the 
 desired degree of dryness is achieved.  This can take several months but it 
 is the time tested way of doing it.

 I think you are sadly mistaken if you think the beer in the kettle without

 As a point of interest, I pure culture RS Champaign a few weeks ago for my 
 next batch of wine and both petri dishes turned up mould colonies.  One dish 
 was never opened after inocculation as a control and the other was the one 
 transferred to the slants.  Both had the same species of mould.
 
 My next batch should be interesting.  I don't have enough of anything but 
 apples to make 5 gallons so I picked the mullberries and elderberries as they 
 ripened and froze them.  Looks like the grapes and apples will be ripe about 
 the same time.  I also found out that elderberries need to be dried before 
 use. Fresh, they are tasteless but dried, are very fruity.
 
 > I have always had to fortify them somewhat so that they did not ferment out

 That is one way to do it but adding sugar and letting it ferment seems more 
 natural but that is a moot point.
 
 >I personally do not like sweetening after fermentation, and would rather
 choose the right yeast and level of fortification so that the final

 I don't consider fermentation over till bottling time but more importantly 
 your method sounds too much like Gallo.  And unless you get real lucky, you 
 can easily miss the mark.

Subject: Head Space, etc . . .


In HBD #947, Jack Schmidling writes that you could bottle leaving no head
space. This is 180 degrees out of phase with what more than 20 other people
have told me. They said that you have to have a minimum of one half-inch of
space at the top or the bottle won't properly carbonate. I've never thought
to ignore this advice so I don't know what happens if you fill it to the
brim. Considering that the pro breweries do this, I'll run with the pack on
this one. 


Also Jack, you state that maybe people are starting to think for themselves
here and that is what is causing the recent flame-outs. Well thinking for
yourself and being an asshole are entirely independent characteristics. And
I'm not referring to you with that statement, but with a few of the others
recently posted. As a relative novice (I've only been at this for about 25
batches), I have learned a great deal through the more experienced brewers
debating the different aspects of brewing. Challenging the techniques of
others helps everyone to understand the underlying art. No one is saying
that we can't think for ourselves, but rather that we should keep it to a
constructive confrontation.


And finally, the peach weissen turned out to be pretty tasty. I used 12 lbs
of California white peaches and I should probably have only used 9. It does
have that banana flavor to it. What causes that? Is it from fermenting it
at too high a temperature? Will it mellow out over time? Anyway, the next
attempt is an all-grain stout (my first all-grain). Based on the
discussions I expect it too be fun.

This seems like sound advice to me.  Certainly, SmartCaps should be able to 
prevent, or greatly reduce, aborption into my mead of oxygen in the 
headspeace.  But, I am also concerned with oxidation that can occur during 
racking and bottling.  (If I ever get a kegging setup, I won't have this 
problem anymore ;-)  


It's just occurred to me that the kinetics of the oxidation reaction might
be slow so that dissolved oxygen could come out of solution as head-space
O2 is absorbed by SmartCaps.  Any comments on that? 


Assuming that the kinetics are not MUCH slower than the aborbtion on the
caps, I am back to my original question:  Has anyone used ascorbic acid in
a mead?  I am wondering about the effectiveness, procedures, and side
effects. 


Thanks for any advice,  (and thanks to Rob for maintaining this forum)

Flaming refers to the act of setting fire to somebody's words, and is
rather usenet-ese in its usage, although it is reaching wider acceptance
("my supervisor was really annoyed and sent me flame mail").  Yep, I'm
finding that certain individuals get really boring when all they do is
whine and criticise, unless they somehow manage to impart some useful
knowledge in the whining and criticism.  Such are the pitfalls of usenet
and many e-mail lists.  Ignore it; think of 'em as so many wrong numbers,
when the misdialing idiot blames you for his/her mistake. :-)  It would
also be really useful if the flamers took it to e-mail... and maybe we
could stand less adjectives like 'stupid', 'lame', and such.  A few more
fresh lupulins, that's what we could *all* use, to put the 'lax' back in
relax!


On to the more important (and not stupid!) question of exploding bottles.
I have been brewing for about a year, and have never had an explosion
(well, except for the bottle that broke when I dropped it - but I think the
concrete floor may have helped that along!).  Non-impact bottle explosions 
seem to have two causes - infected bottlings and overpriming.  Infected
bottling usually means that the bottles were insufficiently sanitised, or
that the beer may have been infected going in.  This is not as common a
reason as overpriming, as most homebrewers (you included) seem to under-
stand that keeping it reasonably clean is important and fundamental.  So
let's see if you're overpriming.


What priming method are you using?  If you're adding a measured dosage of
sugar to each bottle, you're asking for trouble.  Much better is to prepare
a priming solution - a cup of dry malt extract dissolved in a pint of
boiling water, and added to the 5-gallon batch in a priming bucket, will
produce a slow, but steady and non-exploding carbonisation.  Other priming
agents - 3/4 cup of corn sugar, or a mixture of 1/4 cup of fruit syrup plus
2/3 cup DME, all dissolved in one pint of water - will work well too, with
the fruit syrup contributing something unique to the flavour profile; it
sure worked well with a raspberry wheat and a raspberry amber ale!


Relax, don't worry, and make sure you don't get hurt by the exploding
bottles!  Better luck next time.
