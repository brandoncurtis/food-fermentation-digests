Subject: Syphons


Starting syphon:  Sterilize hose. Stick enough hose in liquid to be
syphoned so that a length greater than twice the distance from the
surface of the liquid to the top of the container is submerged.
With sterilized fingers (however), fold the hose double (above the
top of container) and pinch the fold between thumb and forefinger,
thus entrapping a length of air (or whatever gas was in the hose)
and enough liquid to reach from the surface over the top of the 
container and down the outside to a point below the liquid level.
Withdraw the hose from the container until the liquid level
is above the top of the container. Fold and pinch the hose at the
liquid level (you may release the first pinch at this point). 
Insert the free end of the hose into the receiving vessel. 
Withdraw the hose from the liquid being careful to keep the end
below the surface. Bring the pinched fold down outside the container
to a point below the surface of the liquid in the container.
Release the pinch. The syphon will start. This process is trivially
simple if the container is full but requires some dexterity if
the liquid level is low. Practice with water. Play with length
of submerged hose until you're comfortable. Smooth motions work
best. 


Regarding bubbles in syphon: Bubbles forming at junction of syphon
"cane" and hose have been addressed. (Pinch the bubble and it goes
away) My experience is that when bubbles form in syphon hoses used
alone, they occur at the point where the hose contacts the edge of 
the vessel being drained. I believe this happens because the hose
flattens at this spot, thereby constricting the flow, locally 
increasing the velocity of the liquid, and therefore, the turbulence
(same flattening, albeit less, occurs at the bend in syphon "canes").
The agitation thus produced drives the carbon dioxide out of solution.
To prevent this one needs to keep the hose round. A short length of
garden hose (~8 inches) slipped over the syphon hose and positioned
at the edge of the container stiffens the system sufficiently
to avoid the problem.

Subject: Re: coors light and vinometer




What the Light ad didn't mention is that for many brands the "light" beer is 
just the regular beer watered down a bit (I don't know for SURE about Coors).
So the "concentrated Coors light" being tanked around may in fact just be the
normal Coors beer.




On vinometers:


What they measure is sort of a balance between specific gravity and
surface tension.  The implicit assumption is that the alcoholic fluid
has been fermented dry. fine for dry wine, but for beer or sweet wine,
it won't read correctly.  Dry wine has a specific gravity in the range
of .998 or so, while finished homebrew is often around 1.010 (and
varies a lot).

    Pardon me if this topic has been discussed before but I am new to
HBD and to brewing.
    I've just racked my first batch of brew into the secondary
fermenter and I am beginning to wonder about bottling and priming.


    What's the best way to mix the priming sugar into the fermented
beer before bottling?


    According to Mr. Papazian's book the sugar syrup should be poured
into a carboy and then the wort siphoned on top of it. Will this
method mix the sugar in well enough or should the beer be stirred
afterwards?

I'm off to London for 8 days early next month and would like to tour a local
brewery or two while there.  Does anyone know if there are any breweries open
to the public for tours in London???


While I'm there can anyone suggest some good pubs to try??  Which local brews
should I try -- which should I avoid??

        Hi All,


                There has been considerable discussion in this forum and RCB
        recently regarding procedures for handling of siphon tubes, surgical
        gloves, etc.  I'd like to relate an experience from a high school biology
        course.
                The course instructor came in one day with a culture containing
        some kind of common bacteria (I can't recall which kind, this happened
        almost 25 years ago).  She placed some of the culture on an sterile petri 
        dish with no growth medium, and put it aside.  The next day, examination
        of the culture under a microscope revealed the culture was completely
        dead, as there was nothing in the petri dish on which it could feed.
        She then took another sample of living bacteria from the original,
        healthy culture, and placed it in the palm of her hand for one minute.
        She scraped the culture off her hand, and placed it on a slide.  This
        culture was almost completely dead, there were only a few cells
        remaining that were left alive!
                The lesson for that day was that human skin contains a natural
        bacteriacide that protects us from all those airborne micro-nasties that
        we all go to such great lengths to keep out of our beer.  It's what enables
        us to live in the air without being ill constantly.
        
        DISCLAIMER:
        I have absolutely no background in medical science, but I did observe this
        firsthand.  I have also brewed over 200 batches of beer in the past seven 
        years, and have never had an infection that was the result of touching
        siphon tubes with my hands.  I even start my siphon by forming an "o-ring"
        over the end of the tube with my thumb and forefinger, for the purpose of
        avoiding direct contact with my mouth.  Now, I would'nt recommend racking
        beer after changing the oil in the family car, but I feel as long as
        brewers keep their hands clean, touching a siphon tube will not cause an
        infection.  IMHO, wearing surgical gloves, etc., qualifies as excessive
        worry.
                If there are any net.brewers with training in medicine/biology out
        there that know more about this than I do, perhaps they would care to
        comment.


                                         Cheers,
                                          Jim

        After sampling a May wine from a local winery I was very
        impressed with the flavor of Woodruf(f?).  If anyone has
        used this herb before in mead or beer...
        
In Berlin people drink Berliner Weisse, a sour-tasting Weizenbier,
out of glasses that could best be described (with my limited eloquence)
as a half of a small fishbowl or an half-sphere ice cream sundae
glass.


Into this (IMHO unpalatable) beer they introduce one of two additives:


        Raspberry Syrup (red)
                or
        Woodruf Extract.


Its being neither "Hopfen" nor "Malz" would preclude its being used in
German beers.  I don't like the stuff, but it is "interesting".

Subject: Easy sterile yeast transfer


Avoiding infection during yeast culturing on plates or
slants is imperative.  Several methods are used to reduce
the chance of infection, such as:


     o    working very quickly, so that plates and slants
          have a minumum exposure to the environment


     o    making multiple plates or slants at the same time,
          to increase the chance of successful transfer


     o    wearing a mask and/or hat


     o    wiping down the work area with 200ppm chlorine.


Truly sterile transfer is not easily accomplished in the
home environment without building a sterile box.


Here's a simple, cheap, easy way to build a sterile box,
without needing any skill or special materials whatsoever(my
requirements).  The only tools required to build it are
scissors and tape.  This box design came from a friend who
uses one to culture orchids instead of yeast, but the
requirements are the same.


Ingredients:


     Cardboard box
     Aluminum foil
     Plastic wrap (eg: Saran)
     Plastic dishwashing gloves (eg: Playtex)
     Spray bottle
     Chlorine


To sterilize equipment and materials going into the box, use
whatever you use to sterilize slants and plates, such as:


     Canning jars (eg: Mason)
     Pressure canner (15 minutes at 15 psi)


Building your sterile box:


  1. Cut all four of the top flaps off the box.
  2. Cut down two sides at an angle to make a work area
     opening, leaving a lip on the bottom, like so:


          Side View                     Front View


          |------\                      |         |
          |       \                     |         |
          |        \                    |         |
          |         \                   |         |
          |          \                  |         |
          |           \                 |         |
          |            |                |---------|
          |------------|                |---------|


  3. Line the inside with aluminum foil.  Leave no cardboard
     exposed.
  4. Tape your plastic wrap to the back of the box, so that
     it drapes over the opening you've cut.




When you sterilize your slants and plates, also sterilize
your transfer equipment, such as loops or eyedroppers (the
latter for making slants from Wyeast).  Do this by sealing
them in canning jars (with a little water) prior to pressure
canning 'em.  Also, can a plain jar of sterile water to use
as a rinse.


Put on your gloves, place all equipment inside the box, and
spray 200ppm chlorine onto the box walls, floor, the plastic
wrap, and the exterior of all your slants, tubes, canning
jars, and the gloves themselves.


Dip anything that comes in contact with your yeast samples
in the sterile water to rinse off the chlorine prior to
opening it.


Tada!  It's not a thousand dollar sterile hood, but it beats
the kitchen table and allows you to work a little more
slowly..Also, if the box gets ratty from use it's real easy
to make a new one.

 If it was a roller mill, designed for malt, it is not likely your problem.
 
 I hate to sound like a broken record but my guess is that your mash cooled 
 off.  To resolve the question, you need to check the temp of the mash from 
 top to bottom.  The bare minimum is to take a reading of the run off.
 
 I do not think the hole size is very important because it is the husks that 
 do the filtering.  The holes just keep the husks from clogging the spigot. 
 What is probably happening is that your thick mash, which consists mainly of 
 sugar and starch is turning to glue because of the temp and glogging the 
 holes.
 
 The solution is hotter sparge water.  My system is no doubt different from 
 yours but (in spite of all contrary advice) I use boiling water and my runoff 
 is only around 140 to 150F but that is aparently enough to prevent glue 
 formation.

 Sure.  Most brew/wine shops carry them.  They work very well but,

 Mine says about 7% no matter what kind of beer I put in it, even NA.

Subject: copper; woodruff


In HBD # 956, Tom Feller is getting problems with copper in his brew.
Copper is quite poisonous, and can cause severe disorders, especially
colic, diarrhea, and vomiting (and that's at low doses). I would
recommend using the contaminated brews as slug bait.


Copper is not such a problem at the beginning of the brewing process
(copper kettle, lauter tun, chiller, etc) because yeast uses some copper
for growth, and most of the rest precipitates into the trub as complexes
with tannins.  Once the beer has cleared, however, any additional copper
will stay in solution.


Alan Mayman asked about woodruff. There was a long discussion on the
subject last year in the Beer Forum on Compuserve. From a German friend,
I learned that woodruff has to be gathered early, as it just flowers,
for best aroma. Then last summer, while visiting my parents in France, I
found out that my father has a fairly nice patch of it in the back of
the garden. It is a very unprepossessing plant with round leaves, the
kind one would never pay attention to, although it is said that the
little white flowers are very pretty.


The aroma of woodruff is that of coumarin, and it is the basis of the
green syrup that the Berliners put in their Berliner Weisse when they
are not putting raspberry.

I would suspect not a conspiracy, but whether the editor of the Tribune has
a USENET account, or reads the HBD .... ;-D


Okay, now the real reason I'm here today. I was wondering if it would be
possible to ferment in the primary as normal, and before the fermenting is
complete rack into a 5 gal. soda keg, seal up, and let the ferment finish
in there. 


I realize you'd probably have to time it right, but would that not eliminate
the need to prime? Would the finishing ferment provide the carbonation? Am
I risking death and dismemberment if I do this too soon?


Has this been beaten to death before? :->


Cheers,

asked if I had anything to declare... I simply unzipped my hockey

        Hi All,


        In HBD#957, Chuck Cox writes:


        >>It is extremely rare taht
        >>returning Americans get their bags opened.


        >I have to strongly disagree with this statement.


          I have to go along with Chuck on this one, I have traveled extensively
        in Europe, Mexico, and the Carribean, always on a civilian passport.
        I have always breezed through customs when entering another country,
        the only times I was ever searched was re-entering my own country.
        Chuck is also correct that Boston is horrible.  I was searched there
        because I was carrying a single bottle of gin through for a 
        travelling companion.  You get one bottle duty free, so I had'nt
        put it down on the declaration form.  I was detained for 20 minutes
        while they searched through three suitcases full of dirty laundry.
        Poetic justice, I suppose.
          Another horrible re-entry point is at the Mexican border at San
        Ysidro.  The pinheads down there think that if you're young, male,
        and carrying a bag then you are obviously smuggling drugs.  Our
        tax dollars at work. *SIGH*


          Sorry for turning this into soc.politics or alt.drugs, gang, I did
        actually have a brewing related question.  I recently aquired an
        Igloo 10 gallon round cooler, which I'd like to use for both mashing
        and sparging.  The problem is the spigot is one of those push button
        types.  I had planned to remove the spigot, bore out the hole with
        a hole saw, and replace it with the plastic tap from my existing
        lauter tun.  A friend advised me that it's difficult to reseal these
        coolers once the original spigot is removed.  He suggested I cut the
        end off the original spigot and replace it with a small threaded
        brass faucet.  The problem is it's not obvious where to make the cut.
        The push button portion meets with the spout where the liquid comes
        out, I would have to cut it absolutely flush with the outer wall of
        the cooler to get a round hole.  Anywhere else along the spigot, and
        the hole would be oblong, and would'nt take a threaded tap without
        leaking.
                Anyone else done this? (Kevin, I know you're out there).  Any
        advice would be appreciated.

Subject: Baking bottles


Recently an HBD reader inquired about sanitizing bottles, and one
respondant described his process for heat sanitizing.  In summary,
this consisted of cleaning the bottles, covering them with a 2" x
2" aluminum foil "cap", and then baking them for 1.5 hours at
400 degrees.


I use an identical procedure, with the exception that I bake at
200 degrees for about half an hour.  To be exact, I fill the 
oven and close it, turn on the heat, and turn it off after half
an hour.  As I understand it, sanitizing requires 170 degree
heat, with a contact time of about 15 minutes.  200 at 20 minutes
or so therefore already has a fudge factor built in.  I've never
had a problem with a contaminated bottle.


I might also add that sanitizing with the aluminum cap on means
you can leave the bottle unfilled for some time without losing
your sanitary state.  I'm too nervous to let my baked bottles
sit for weeks, but I have done bottles the day before bottling.
This is particularly convenient when you'll be bottling at
someone else's house--you can show up with two cases ready to
go.  (Note: remove the aluminum foil before bottling!)


My thanks to the infamous Mr. Pete, brew-devil of the great
Northwest, for suggesting this technique.


Last thoughts: I can fit a case of bottles into my oven.
At 200 you can remove the bottles relatively quickly, and they
don't take too long to cool--I've baked my bottles, set them
out, and bottled within about 45 minutes.

Why chill your wort before the primary?


In no particular order:


1. You can pitch sooner.  (Reduces infection risk.)
2. You can do a full-volume boil (helps with hop utilization -- you
   can use less hops, and reduces caramelization).  Note that with
   all-grain brewing you have to do a full-volume boil.
3. You get the "cold break" in the kettle (if you use an immersion
   chiller) instead of in the fermenter.  Reduces trub volume in the
   fermenter and generally makes for a cleaner ferment (IMHO).
4. You have less risk of oxidation when transfering the wort from the
   kettle to the fermenter.  In fact, you can aerate during the
   transfer or immediately after (or before, I suppose).  At a
   minimum, oxidation will darken your wort.  It can also lead to
   off-flavors (Note to potential flamers: I said "It CAN ...", not
   "It WILL".
5. I pitch the yeast into the brew kettle while the trub is settling.
   This way it (presumably) gets to use some of the nice proteinaceous
   material in the "break", but it doesn't sit on it throughout the
   whole fermentation.
6. You don't risk cracking your carboy with hot wort.

 I thought I needed to clarify this since I am the network access for 
 Dr. Schiller.  I just got off the phone with martin and we cleared up
 this confusion.  We had a discussion a while back about different 
 breweries that ferment with one yeast and condition with another.  The
 obvious ones that come to mind are Bavarian HefeWeizens (top fermented
 with a single cell culture from Weinhenstephan that produces Banana
 esters and copious anoumts of phenolics due to the production of
 4-vinyl guaiacol, filtered and repitched with a flocculant lager
 strain) and Belgium Ales (fermented with almost any mix of strains and
 often conditioned with another strain).  Somehow this concept got 
 confused with the process that Sierra Nevada employs.  Sierra brews 
 all of thier excellent ales with the same strain, an ale yeast that
 apparently originated from Narragansett (sp?).  After primary 
 fermentation is complete, the beer is filtered (I believe they sterile
 filter) and force carbonated in the bright beer tank.  The carbonation
 level is above 2 atmospheres (about 90+% of the final carbonation).
 After this stage, the beer is primed with about 4 pounds of the SAME
 ale yeast per 200 BBls.  This is an incredibly small amount of yeast
 for bottle conditioning and would not work well without the previous
 force carbonation of the product. This yeast then produces the final
 carbonation level desired.  This method has numerous advantages over
 traditional krausening in that the initial product filtering helps
 to maintain quality control (remove any fermentation affected yeast 
 cells, provide a sterile environment) possible fermentation modified
 stage allows the brewery to only add a minute amount of yeast (ever
 noticed how little yeast sediment is in a Sierra product?)
 
 Hope this helps clear up the confusion.  Look for an upcoming post
 So, the yeast many of us culture from the Sierra bottles is actually
 the same yeast as that used in the fermentation, just healthier.
 Dont forget to culture up 1 liter for all five gallon starters.

I started my first brew on Tuesday night.  I think I did everything

thing is that by Friday morning the bubbling appears to have stopped. 
It may be bubbling slowing, but I didn't stand around to check.  There

not sure.  Any advice or reassurances would be appreciated.


Also, I'll be bottling next week, and I'm a bit concerned about
sanitizing the bottles.  I was going to use Chlorox in a large barrel
and soak the bottle for a short time, then take then out and empty them.
 Ater that I was thinking of running them through a rinse and dry cycle
in my dishwasher.  Would this be OK?  What if I just rinsed the bottles
by hand and allowed them to drain upside down for a while?


Thanks in advance.  I'm excited about this first round.

I don't believe that cara-pils malt has to be mashed.  Cara-pils (dextrin malt)
is produced in much the same way as crystal malt, but kilned at a much lower
temperature so as to impart little or no color.  The process used to produce
crystal and dextrin malt essentially "mashes" the grain in the husk.  The malt
is held at a temperature near the upper limit of the saccharification range in
a 100% humidity environment for a period of time and then kilned.  Thus, the 
starches in the grain are converted primarily to dextrins which is exactly what
we want in order to add body, head retention, a little residual sweetness, etc.
to our beer.


A while back there was quite a debate in this forum as to whether these dextrins
will be converted to simpler sugars during mashing and whether or not mashing
negates the effect we are trying to achieve by adding them in the first place.
As always many of us have our own opinions on this topic...


As for throwing in a chicken beak and the heart of a cow killed at a full moon
along with the Cara-pils, I always do this.  Doesn't everyone?  ;^)

This is partially correct. I have it from Steve Harrison at the brewery that
they do filter their Pale Ale and then introduce yeast for culturing in the
bottle. The yeast which is used is a washed version of the same yeast used to
ferment the ale in the first place. So, while it isn't the exact yeast which
fermented that particular batch, it is the same yeast strain.


As long as we're talking SN yeast, Steve also told me that they do not re-use
the yeast which goes into Bigfoot or Celebration Ale. They use the same yeast
as for the Pale Ale but find that after the yeast gets through the higher
alcohol fermentations of the other two products it mutates and behaves "very
strangely". The yeast is dumped after these seasonal beers are brewed.


This discussion was prompted when I tried to brew a Celebration clone using
yeast from 3 bottles of last years' Celebration Ale. The yeast behaved like
lager yeast in that it never formed the typical SN pancake, nor much of any
foam on the surface of the primary. The beer came out fine, but I wouldn't do
it again because of the unpredictability of the yeast. Other brewers I have
spoken with have had similar experiences when trying to culture from Bigfoot
bottles.


I use SN yeast (from bottles) for all of my ales and have never had a problem.
I take the dregs from 3 bottles and put them into a 1200 ml wort at about 1.035
with 1/8 teaspoon of nutrient. The starter is ready for use in 4 - 5 days. My
10 gallon primaries take off within 6 hours.

Subject: RE: Propane/NG indoors


In HBD 579, Steve Anatasi asks about relative merits and safety of propane
vs natural gas.  For indoor use, **good ventilation** is very important. 
In a closed space, a burner can snarfle up a lot of the oxygen and replace
it with CO2 and (to a much lesser extent) carbon monoxide.  This doesn't
bother the beer, but it might make you ill.  Assuming the burners are
working properly, there isn't much difference in the exhaust gasses from
the two fuels.


There is a considerable difference in safety, if you have a gas leak. 
Propane is heavier than air, tends to flow and pool like invisible
gasoline.  Propane also has a much wider explosive mixture % with air.  If
you are going to use propane indoors, test all your gas joints with soap
solution to be sure they are leak-free.


Another Great Moment in Brewing History:  I once had an exciting adventure
with an indoor propane leak.  A supply hose for a burner on a bench-top
developed a leak.  My spark lighter ran out of flint after I had opened
the tank valve.  I turned the gas off at the burner, but this left the
leaky hose still going.  Because I had opened the valve without lighting
the gas, there was some gas odor.  I walked across the room, got a new
flint and went back to the burner.  I opened the burner valve and
WHOOOMMMP!! 


Suddenly I had the entire benchtop aflame, with the flames spilling off
the edge of the counter like a Niagra Falls of fire.  As the fire hit the
floor, it flashed the pool of propane that had collected around my feet. 
It was all over in the blink of an eye (now missing eyebrows).  I was VERY
surprised.  I was very lucky that I hadn't dithered any longer getting the
flint for the lighter.


Propane does not need to be enclosed in order to be explosive.  A friend
of mine once watched his boss get tossed twenty feet by a propane
explosion in an open storage nook on the outside of a building.


All these horror stories aside, many homes and trailers use propane for
heat and cooking.  I have two burners that I use for brewing.  Propane is
less expensive to get started with, is more expensive per BTU.  NG costs
less to use and more to install.  Use good ventilation and test for leaks.

David Klumpp outlines his method of sanitizing bottles in the oven. I have been
using a similar approach.


I use Anchor bottles and clean them as they empty, then soak them overnight in
a mild bleach solution just prior to bottling. I then rinse with a jet-washer
and hot tap water. Differing from Dave, I heat the rinsed, but still wet,
bottles to 350 degrees and hold for 30 minutes. I figure the steam action
produced helps a bit. I then allow the bottles to cool slowly to prevent
cracking. I bottle as soon as the bottles are cool enough to handle. I warn you
that I don't bottle too often. Perhaps a batch of barleywine and a holiday
batch each year. Nevertheless, barleywine from 2 years ago is still clean and
beast-free.

Well, everybody else has posted their labelling strategy; might as well join
the fun.  I used the dots like several other posters, white ones mostly (cause
they didn't have colored ones in my earlier bottling days).  I would take a
date stamp and stamp the bottling date on all of them, then write enough
description above and below the date to identify it.  M/F Amber, HT was a
common one (Munton & Fison Amber, Halletauer hops).  Sure, it took a few
minutes to write out 50 of these, but really not very long.  When I was at
max production I was about 7 batches ahead, drinking 5 or 6 of them at once.
I would never have kept a cryptic batch number straight, but a simple
'IH Bitter' (Iron Horse Bitter), 'Georgie Brown Ale' or whatever meant I --
and my guests -- always knew what we were getting.

Ok, that was great!  Now let's see if we can put this into practical
terms.  I could therefore _assume_;


1) That non-chlorine bleach could be used in place of B-Brite as a
   _cleaning_ agent.


2) That non-chlorine bleach could be used in place of B-Brite as a
   _sanitizing_ agent.


Does this make sense?


Can anyone offer more insight into the wonders of B-Brite vs.
non-chlorine bleach?


Thanks,
