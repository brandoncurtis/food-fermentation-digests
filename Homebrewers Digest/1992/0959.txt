This is a bit off the subject, but i do not know where to go.
My mother just returned from Peru, and at my request brought
back some of their odd corn varieties.  One of which is
a special corn they grow to ferment, which has large kernels.
I am thinking about planting some next spring, and emulating
their recipe, which unfortunately is sketchy.


  1) soak and drain the corn
  2) re-fill with water
  3) cook for a while
  4) add honey
  5) let ferment spontaneously


Well... i do not want to introduce some kind of incredibly
nasty weed to the continent, so how can i find out if this
is OK?


Also... for you o-chem, bio-chem gurus:


   can corn be converted by boiling, or do i need a warm
temp rest like barley.  


   Do you think that there may have been a germination
period between the soaking and the cooking?


   My mom's friend will return to peru for x-mas.  At that
time he can get me some of the famed "chicha morada"
purple corn, that they use there for making a yummy
cool-aid like drink.  Just boil the whole purple corn
cobs for a while, and add sugar.  (use the corn like
tea bags)  I have had this chicha morada in LA, and it was
quite good.  I also hear that there is a fermented chicha
morada beverage, which i will try to emulate.  The only
think i know about chicha morada is from the article that
somebody posted here or to HBD about a guy who went into the
indian territories of peru.  i think it was published in
outside or something.

Subject: When to measure SG and what to include?


In HBD #957, Jack talks about when to measure SG and sez:
 
>...If you measure it after the boil, use the volume after the boil and 
>be sure to include the trub left in the bottom of the kettle in the volume.


Any other opinions?  I've always done what Jack says, but I'm never
sure if it's right.  Specifically:


 - the trub is in solution before the cold break and in suspension
   after, right?  


 - stuff in suspension doesn't affect SG readings, right?  (E.g.
   throwing wood chips or marbles into wort wouldn't change the
   hydrometer reading.)


 - Does stuff in suspension take up more room than stuff in solution?


 - If the answer to the last on is `yes', then doesn't it mean
   that pre-boil SG is different from post-boil SG, whether you
   include the trub volume or not?


Only wondering.  Wish I remembered more of my pchem.


Cheers,
Rob

Subject: Cajun Cooker Enclosure


Sometime back, Phil Miller asked :


>How long can I expect a standard tank of propane to last if I use
>a Cajun Cooker type burner to heat my wort for boiling (i.e., rocket
>blast mode to bring 5-6 gallons to a boil and then idle mode to
>maintain a vigorous boil for 1 1/2 hours)?


About two years ago, Kinney Baughman introduced me to the Cajun Cooker/
Bunsen Burner from Hell. In the intervening time I've worked out a way to
get more mileage out of my propane tank. It was a bit of a project, but
I enjoyed it.


The first time I used it, I was brewing outside on a windy day. When
Alexandra peered out of a second story window, she was shocked to see the
entire garden shimmering from the heat. Being a master of the obvious, I
deduced that too much heat was going into the garden, and not enough into 
the beer. At the end of the brew day, my just filled 20 lb propane tank was
75-80% consumed.


I decided to try to improve my efficiency, and seeking inspiration took a 
quick look at industrial boiler designs. A common design for high efficiency
entails enclosing the kettle in an outer jacket, and putting the flame
between the two. Further enhancements include adding intake vents at the
bottom, directing the intake gasses thru the center of the flame and not
around it, and providing an exhaust vent at the top. So I went to my friendly 
neighborhood homebrew supply shop (Oak Barrel in Berkeley) to get one of these.


What I came home with was an empty 55 gallon drum - malt extract of course.
>From this, I fashioned an enclosure with the afore mentioned vents and
manifolds, added holes for a gas line in and a wort line out, and installed a
door for easy access to the inside. The entire boiler assembly, kettle (Bud
keg), burner, support/manifold, rests inside the 55 gallon drum. 


Overall, I'm very happy with the results. The flames are protected from the 
elements, and heat transfer is greatly improved (ie the garden no longer 
shimmers). I now get 4-5 brew sessions (heat mash water, heat sparge water, 
1 1/2 hour boil) on a single fill. As an added benefit, some of the jet engine 
noise is muffled.


One of these days I'll get around to modifying those 45 gallon double jacketed 
tanks in my back yard.


Cheers,
CR

I'm going to be in San Antonio, TX for a week in mid November.  I under-
stand that there are no brewpubs in Texas.  I like to drink good beer,
listen to good stomping music, and eat good local food.  If you have any
advice re: these items in San Antonio, please drop me an e-mail
directly.  I don't always have time to read everything in HBD.
Thanks.  Have fun.

Subject: Sanitizing Bottles..


My method for what it's worth...I wash out my bottles immediately after pouring
the contents into my glass (except the ones I scrounge from the recycle bins
around my house).  Next, I throw them in with all the other dishes currently
in the dishwasher and wash them before storing.  When it's time to bottle, I
bring them out, shoot them with a bottle washer (read invaluable tool).  I
run my dishwasher empty and about half way through the cycle, open the door
and dump a little household bleach in it to clean the inside.  Next I load
the bottles into it and run it.  Again about half way through the cycle, I
open the door and dump a little bleach in.  Finally, I let the heating element
dry the bottles.  I don't open the dishwasher until I'm ready to fill the 
first bottle.  I've got a fairly efficient bottling system (and a good brew
partner), IMHO, and from dishwasher to capper is a snap...so the bottom line
is I've never had any problems with infection since I started using this
technique.  This may not be for everybody (like people living in water
restricted areas, but slight modifications might work) but it seems to work
for me.
Now a question...
Why in the H am I getting low hydrometer readings on extract brews??  Am I
just *lame* or what?? (no I haven't ruled out that possibility).  The 
instructions that came with the meter are pretty simple, but the OG always
seems to be low.  The info in Line's BB of B (those formulas on page 149,
I think) seem to produce the expected OGs, but who knows.  I check the meter
in 60F H20 and it is fine...I read a recent posting about problem readings so
this isn't just my imagination (but then again the 60's were...).  Any thoughts?Thanks in advance for any opinions or enlightenment.

This is in response to Chis Campanelli's request for suppliers of fruit
crushing and pressing equipment that would be appropriate for cider making.


My list is basically formatted as follows:


        Supplier
        Address
        Phone Number(s)
        Supplies                Price


Note that since I haven't dealt with many of these vendors, inclusion in this
list does not constitute an endorsement; it just means that I have their
catalog handy.


If you have any additions, post them!

Subject: Storage of bleach solutions


A number of texts say that re-use of bleach solutions is not advisable, whereas
it is OK for sulphite up to 3 weeks. Is this suggesting that chlorine degrades
with time, even in a sealed container?

Subject: sanitation and questions


Hi everyone...
I have a couple of questions and a few thoughts (about brewing)


1.  What is the difference between aeration and oxydation?


2.  Re: Sanitation.... How do the breweries handle this? Do they ever
     get bad batches that they must dump or do they have some magic way
     of salvaging....


    Some brewers use open fermenters  (Anchor, Pilsner Urquell, etc). Why
    don't they have sanitary problems. I would never think of fermenting
    in the open, but Pilsner Urquell does it in caves with no apparent
    problems.... Any comments?


3.  How is alpha acid content measured and Can I easily do it at home for
    my home grown hops. Will the AA content of homegrown hops vary significantly
    from the published ranges for a given species.


Thanks in advance....

    Also, with the Digest now being over 1000 lines virtually every day , I 
think it prudent to remind everyone to try and shorten their signature files 
to a line or two.  With so many articles every day, signature lines make up a 
significant part of the total bandwidth.  For what it's worth...

     The last time I was in germany, the 1986 octoberfest, I stopped up in
Bamberg Germany to pick up a friend who was stationed there. We stayed a
couple nights in the area and sampled some quality brew. There was one type
that I absolutely loved but I have never seen any bottled form of it, much
less a brewpub that serves it. It is served with a thin lemon slice in a
pilsner glass and is a wheat beer known as "crystalweissen". Being german I
understand what the name means(doesn't take a genious). What I was wondering
was, does any body have a recipe for said beer?

Subject: Starting siphons


I read this trick in the digest a long time ago and it works well for me...


1. Put a short piece of sanitized hose (or plastic tube) on the "out" end of
   your siphon.
2. Put the "in" end of your siphon in the wort.
3. Lift up a bunch of the siphon hose and suck a bunch of wort into the tube,
   but not enough to get "over the hump" and into your dirty mouth.
4. Drop the filled siphon hose so it is below the level in the carboy, but keep
   the "out" end up high. Pull of the dirty piece from step 1.


Your siphon is ready to run. I also use a plastic cane at both ends of my
siphon hose. It makes handling the thing much easier. See Below...

I would like to make a cherry ale and thought that I had heard someone

When I went to check it out, all I could find was 100% cherry juice.
I was going to use about 5 lbs of cherries for a 5 gallon batch.  If I

equivalent?  Has anyone out there used the juice before?  Also, are there
any clarifying agents needed when you use fruits (or juice) in beer?  I was

hi all


one method a friend in Canada uses - very well to boot - is to declare all
bottles as Yeast Samples - for lab purposes, not for consumption.


to really do this you have to remove the labels (relable with coded - home
brew type to keep them identifiable) and add the yeast sample not for 
human consumption lab crap.


this friend makes trips to/from the US/Canada and Europe amonst others

this type of duty free transfer - to expunge it upon the customs people.

Subject: Oktoberfest, priming & siphoning


First, travel question:


        When is Oktoberfest (the one in Munich)?


Other stuff:


I've had the bubbles-form-at-the-intersection-of-the-racking-tube-and-
siphon-hose blues for some time now.  I have used tiny hose clamps, 
cable ties (Ty-Wraps) and heavy twist ties to try to get a seal.  The
cable tie works well but costs a cable tie per batch.  Does anyone have
a reusable solution?  We seem to have a lot of chemists out there...
I know that the problem is caused by a siphon hose that's slightly too
large, caused by what we in industry politely call "production tolerances".
The tiny hose clamps work pretty well if you put them where the racking
tube is _straight_.  Any suggestions?


When people bulk prime, they add (something sweet) to the beer in the
fermenter.  Then they presumably stir it up.  Which causes all sorts
of gunk to be stirred up from the bottom.  Do we all solve this problem
by racking first to another container?  (Primary > secondary > priming vessel?)
Or what?


Neat idea for starting siphons:  At my local homebrew dealer I saw a little
pump humming away attached to a tube that went down inside a little 'mini
carboy' (a gallon jug) to a thing with thousands of tiny holes in it out of 
which  were streaming tiny bubbles.  In the middle of the tube was a small 
disk-shaped thingy.  In response to my question, it was explained that this
thingy was a filter and the whole assembly was used to oxygenate beer
during the early stages of fermentation.  The filter keeps the nasties
out.  Cool.  Now we use an orange carboy cap connected to the filter
to the pump (a simple aquarium pump they said).  Through the other hole 
goes the racking tube into the beer, with the siphon hose at the other
end.  An on-off switch controls the pump.


Overkill, right?  I thought so.  Sorry.

these were all that were available to earlier brewers.  Wineries
use them (old bourbon kegs sometimes) to age red wines for 
that oaky taste.  Does anyone use wooden kegs to store beer?
Would there be some taste advantage to doing so? How would 
you make them clean enough to use? I've read in books

As with all these discussions, your brewing environment comes
into play.  I routinely leave my brew in the secondary for weeks
and months (I have a porter in the secondary that has been there
since April).  As the proud father of a 27-month old and a 4
month old, plus having other duties around the house, bottling
may take a back seat to other activities.  So, I keep plenty of
secondaries around.


Anyway, I have never had a carbonation problem no matter how long
I left it in the secondary, but then my basement never gets below
55 and is mostly around 60 in the winter and 68-70 in the summer.
If I put some bottles in the refrigerator too soon, then they
won't be fully carbonated.


So, do what works for you, but try to isolate the important
variables in your environment (is priming sugar being left in the
sludge of your bottling bucket, are you storing bottles in the
fridge, are the caps on tight, etc.?) and only worry about the
right ones.  I no longer worry about some aspects, but my dusty,
moldy, mildewy basement requires that I not skip any sanitizing
steps while I am racking down there.

That is what I use (actually, nowadays, I just buy the little

However, this works poorly when you have guests trying many

The basic concern with using ice is that it may be highly
contaminated.  There is often quite a bit of bacteria in a home
freezer, not to mention the possibility of picking up strange
tastes or smells.


I always boil up some water, put it in heavy plastic and cover,

Well, I expect I am asking a lot, but it cannot hurt to try.


I am currently an extract brewer and have been buying whatever the
brewstore I am shopping at carries in bulk, since it is both cheaper
and I can get whatever quantity I want.  I would like to try some
other extracts, but I have a difficult time in what amounts to about
double what I pay for bulk extract without knowing whether it would
be better (or even as good).


So, what I was wondering was whether anyone had ever made a 
(semi)comprehensive survey of extract (kits) that are available, rating
quality of beer made, characteristics of the extract, average price
and whatnot (basically a Consumer's Report article on malt extracts).


Barring that, what extracts have you used that you like/dislike?

Subject: mashing in a jacket (and tie)


While I am trying to get some stainless false-bottoms for the
AcoustiMash, I am also formulating the first recipe.  I will be brewing
a 10 gallon stout, probably around 1060 OG.  I know its not exactly
traditional, but its based on a recipe I really like. 


In planning the mash, I ran into an interesting question involving heat
loss when mashing-in.  We know that you generally heat your mash water
about 18 deg F over your initial mash temperature to accomodate the
relatively cool grain.  This assumes you are using an insulated mash
tun. 


The AcoustiMash has a substantial (>20gal) thermostatically heated water
jacket surrounding the two tuns.  The mash water comes from this jacket. 
Tests, extrapolation, and some wild guesses suggest that when full of
water, I can expect about 1 degree F temperature rise per minute from
the 1.5kW heater.  Since the system heats much faster than it cools, it
would be better to under-shoot than over-shoot the initial temperature. 


My gut feeling is that I should simply set the thermostat for the
initial mash temperature, and stir the mash well for a few minutes.  I
think the system has so much thermal mass that the grain won't have any
serious effect on the equilibrium temperature.  Theoretically, any minor
cooling would be quickly handled by the heater. 


Any comments?

Subject: SG temp. adjustments


Can anyone give me the adjustments to SG readings at different
temperatures?  I guess this scale is pretty
non-linear?


I was trying to measure the gravity of my spargings last
weekend and wasn't sure how much to adjust for the 
temperature.  The measurements were interesting however.


After the sparge I got a reading of the wort of about 54.
This would be at around 150F.  I was shooting for about 75
(Christmas beer), so I ran to the store and got some bulk
extract syrup.  I figured I'd worry about where I lost my
efficiency later, and added three pounds of syrup.  The
man at the store figured one pound of syrup would raise
the gravity of 5 gallons of wort by 7 points.  My
gravity measurement after the boil and after the added
syrup, and after cooling to 60F was 92!  (for 3.5 to 4
gallons of wort).  So I guess I didn't need to add
the syrup after all.  And my efficiency is not as bad
as I thought.  I gotta get rid of this electric stove
though...

From: Frank Tutzauer <COMFRANK`at`ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu>
Subject: a different kind of fermentation


Hi ya'll.  Well, I finally (after 3 weeks :-O ) racked my steam beer.
After tasting and taking a s.g., it is clear that the fermenation has
not proceeded the way it usually does.  Nothing really to worry about,
but I thought I'd ask for your ideas about what you think is going on.


First, the recipe:  I used 6 lbs of light dried malt extract, some crystal,
some pale malt, 1 oz of 6.5 Northern Brewers for 50 min, 1 oz for 1 min,
(I estimated about 30 or so International Bittering Units)
and Wyeast 2035 (American Lager).  It's a recipe I have made many times
before.  I ferment anywhere from the high 50s to the low 70s depending
on time of year.  It usually finishes anywhere from 1.008 to about 1.015,
and is one of my favorite beers to brew.


After racking, I tasted the sample.  Very good, but too sweet.  A hydrometer
reading confirmed:  1.022, higher than I expected after three weeks
(although I once bottled at 1.028--fermentation definitely over--and it
was my best batch ever.  I had more hops that time, though.)


O.k.  Differences in procedure between this batch and others of the
same ilk.


1.  The yeast had been frozen with glycerin.  Usually, I make a starter
from the package, or from bottle dregs.  This is the first time I've
ever used the glycerin.  The yeast had (I guess) settled to the
bottom.  I poured off most of the glycerin and used the test tube
dregs to make my starter.  I don't know whether or not there was
yeast suspended in the discarded glycerin.  This time the starter smelled 
and tasted "woody"--usually it smells and tastes like sour apples.


2.  I used Laaglander dried malt extract.  Usually I use Munton
& Fison.


3.  This was the second batch I made using my new wort chiller.  So
I had a full boil (instead of three gallons), and I had a MUCH bigger
cold break.  Since I'm still learning about the chiller, I ended up
with a lot more trub in the fermenter than usual.  (No way I expected
that much, so I didn't give it long enough to settle--and then I was too 
lazy to rack.)


4.  I let it go three weeks in the primary.  Usually, I rack after about
four days, or if I'm lazy, let it go two weeks and then bottle.  


There was a very vigorous ferment, but without as much blowoff or
kraeusen as usual.  Although what stuck to the shoulders of the
carboy was denser than usual.  For the first few days, the "woody"
smell, rather than the "sour apples" smell emanated from the 
carboy.  The beer has not cleared as well as usual
(but jeez with all that trub, it's to be expected.  The little
orange thingy on the racking tube wasn't even big enough to
clear the trub/yeast!)


So I'm interested in your opinions on why the gravity is still
so high.  My guesses are:


1.  The freezer/glycerin mutated, degraded, or otherwise affected
the yeast.


2.  The heat knocked out the yeast.  It IS a lager yeast, afterall,
and I suppose there might have been a day or two up above 75F, 
but most of the time the temp was 68-73.


3.  Laaglander is a lot less fermentable than M&F.


4.  The quantitiy of trub and length of time spent on the trub
adversely affected fermentation.


Right now, I'm leaning to a combination of 1 and 3.  Since the
starter smelled and tasted differently, the yeast was obviously
somehow different.  Also, I bet the extract is less fermentable, 
although I have no experience with Laaglander, so I don't know.


Anyway, my current plan is to let it go another week in the secondary.
The sweetness doesn't bother me that much, because I can always
doctor it up with a little isomerized hop extract before bottling.
I suppose I could pitch some more yeast, but right now I'm inclined
to RDWHAHB.  On the other hand, I AM curious as to what you folks
think is going on here.  Like the one guy's sig file says, when
I stop learning, bury me.

Well, the folks on R.C.B couldn't help me with this, so I'll ask here.
(Actually, I would have asked here first, but I didn't have my
digest address handy.)  


We all know that when naturally carbonating a Cornelius keg, you
decrease the amount of priming sugar--like down to 1/3 of a cup,
rather than the usual 3/4 c. for bottles.  My question is this:  Why?
My reasoning is that five gallons of beer is five gallons of beer,
and the 5-6 psi you use for sealing the seals and dispensing the
beer shouldn't make that much difference.  Does it?  Or is there
some other reason?

Yes basically the grooves ran from one of the roller to the other 
along the long axis of the roller, as Darren acurately depicted.


I only put 4 grooves into 1 of the 2 top rollers. These grooves
were placed at right angles (i.e. evenly distributed) about
the roller. I considered using as many as 8, but things seemed
to work well with only 4 so I stopped there. I think if you added
too many then you would reduce the surface area without grooves, which 
does the crushing. The crush occurs between the top 2 rollers and the third 
(bottom) roller.


I dissassembled the unit to put the grooves on, but by popping off the 
plastic hopper up top the rollers are directly acessible (it is made to
pop off without breaking...) and you can just pick one of the 2 top rollers
and score it right in place with the unit bolted to a bench. Score a groove, 
rotate the rollers 90 degrees, score a groove and repeat.....

Subject: Bacteria on the Hands


There was a note in the last HBD about the use of hands on
siphon tubes, and the bacteria on them.  I don't recall who it was
but he described his science teacher's growth experiment.


The claim that makes me cringe is that of "hands having a natural
bacteriocide".  There is some truth to this, but it is a bit off
and potentially dangerously misleading.


FYI:  There are two major classes of microoganisms found on hands (skin)
Resident= the normal flora of the hands (bacteria, yeasts, fungi, - these 
are generally harmless, and difficult to remove.) Transient= "passing"
microbes often picked up from other surfaces.  Are generally easier to
remove and can be potentially pathogenic (depending on the type/source).
There is some truth to the "natural bacteriocide" in that the resident
microbes can actually serve some protection from transients by outcompeting
them for nutrients and even producing inhibitory metabolites.


The real problem here:  is that transients come off easily. That can mean
into your beer or on your siphon tubes.  If you eat a salmonella covered 
chicken sandwich, then dip your hands in your brew, you're asking for 
trouble.  In the same respect, picking your nose, scratching your butt,
petting your dog- can result in similar transfer of "bad bugs".


My suggestion:  Don't be paranoid, be sensible.  Wash your hands thoroughly
before contacting your beer/beer implements.  Dipping them into your 
chlorine solution wouldn't hurt either (unless it's REALLY strong!).  If you 
are worried (first, don't be...) then use a scrub brush, and wash down 
several times.  Use common sense and sanitary practice.  Don't change the baby's diaper as you bottle your beer.  But do not believe that your hands
are naturally sterile and "protected" from picking up bacteria.
You are a jungle of microorganisms.  From your hair to your toe nails
You contain  a plethora of bugs you probably don't want in your beer.
(this does include your breath btw.  Just as you wouldn't want to sneeze
into a carboy, its best to avoid puffing in your beer too.)  If you don't
believe me- get a plate of rich medium and stick your finger on it.
Then count the number of colors/shapes/sizes of growth which appear in a 
week.  It's impressive.  


Another note:  For culturing yeasts.  I would highly recommend the use of
flame ( a good time for flaming...) on such things as inoculating loops,
test tubes etc.  Rinsing them with chlorine is not always a good idea.
1.  You don't want chlorine solutions contacting the yeast culture.
2.  Chlorine can damage inoculating loop metal, and other metals...etc.
Besides for ~ $10-15 you can get a small propane torch and tank of gas to 


sterilize utensils/glassware.  Alternatively-  dipping into EtOH, then 
burning the EtOH will effectively sterilize many surfaces.  
(Esp glass rods).Gas flames are a common piece of equipment in any micro 
lab.  The sterile box sounded like an easy thing to create.  I just use 
the desk in my bedroom sprayed down w/lysol and wiped with EtOH.  It is 
away from the bathroom/kitchen "cultures" of wild bugs.  It is also a good 
idea to turn of fans, close windows, or doors to minimize movement of air.
A small propane burner takes up less space, and a good room probably do 
more for me than a sterile hood would (I have several at work/school- but 
feel comfortable with a careful technique, decent space, and some 
common sense)
