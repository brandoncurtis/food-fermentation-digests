}
}Invert sugar can be simply described, I have been told, as the mirror image
}of a conventional cane sugar molecule, IE, laevo ( left-handed ) versus
}dextro ( right-handed ) structure.
}


I feel that as a chemist I have to stop this one before it grows into another
myth. 


The first poster got it right.  Invert sugar is the product of breaking
apart sucrose into its two constituent parts, glucose and fructose, via 
a process called hydrolysis.  Another issue is raised here, that of handedness
or what is called chirality in chemistry.  Sucrose does indeed have a 
handedness to it.  Molecules that have this property also have the property
of rotating plane polarised light (Polaroid lenses will polarise light into
one plane by only letting that one through and this is why you get no 
transmission if you hold two such lenses in front of each other at the 
right rotation with respect to each other).  The direction of rotation 
is not related in a simple way to the handedness of the molecule.  Sucrose is
dextrorotatory -it rotates light in a right handed screw direction.  Dextrose
is also dextrorotatory and fructose, also called levulose, is levorotatory -
it rotates light in a left handed direction.  Fructose rotates light to the
left slightly more that dextrose does to the right, and the invert sugar 
mix is therefore slightly levorotatory as a result. 


}All of the taste, allegedly, but none of the consequences, as the molecule
}does not 'fit' into reserved niches where normal sugars will, and passes out
}of the body without influencing tooth decay, obesity, or any other concerns.
 
I am sorry to have to say this, but this is utter nonsense.  Sucrose is 
processed by your digestive system into glucose and fructose.  Glucose is
the fuel for all energy processes in the body, the only thing you brain 
actually uses as 'food' is glucose.


}It was first refined in the late 1940s, I believe, but - for obscure reasons
}associated with a supposed bad taste that was later found to be unduplicated
}by scientists reproducing the solution, decades later - it never made it to
}the market, until recently. ( My guess is that the sugar industry paid big
}bucks to suppress it. )


Here again, invert sugar has been know for a long time.  It is actually 
slightly sweeter than cane sugar. It is used commercially in confections and 
brewing and processes that require retaining moisture. 


}I'm wondering if the purpose of its addition to beer brewing is to sweeten the
}beer without providing sustenance for those little yeastie beasties ... I kind
}of prefer honey, myself, but I may give invert sugar a try, now.

Subject:      Ketone Headaches


After Kieran O'Connor's post regarding headaches, I e-mailed him with my
thoughts and then the next day read Mike Mahler's post suggesting that
a high level of ketones might be the reason. Now here are my questions:
   *  what causes the creation of ketones?
   *  is there some indication of a high level of ketones (eg heavy
      kreusen in the primary...)?
   *  will inadequate rinse of chlorine bleach create high ketone levels?
   *  will inadequate rinse cause chlorine headaches? :-)
   *  does using a blow-off tube help reduce headaches (whatever their
      cause)?
   *  what else might be the cause? dry yeast? infection? sediment?

So far I have been marking my brews by putting marks on the caps, but
this is not a very elegant solution.  I'd like to use labels on the
bottles, but I don't want to have to soak them off after each use.
Other than resorting to masking tape, are there labels available that
peel off easily?

Subject: headaches caused by yeast?


Greetings,


I fortunately do not suffer from headaches, but my wife does. One of the
things that seems to bring them on is yeast. She often gets headaches after
drinking homebrew OR commercial beers with yeast still in the bottle (like the
old Boulder Beers). Other beers do not seem to cause this problem.

The French word for grape is "raisin".  Therein may lie the confusion.

My error in measure has been pointed out to me.  Three pints is

or some good local bottled stuff. By the way, I picked up a six pack of Red
Tail Ale, brewed in hopland, CA by Mendacino brewery and it is damn good.

I want to put in a short pitch for Nightwing Enterprises. I had a chat
with the fellow who runs this business at the AHA conference last June.
He is interested in beer history, and is thinking of doing some field
research and writing a book on traditional beers of Africa. 


His beer glasses look pretty good too.

Subject: Cheaper Yards of Ale


 Hold on!  I too was yearning for those Yard glasses after seeing them in
 Denver for the first time.  I noticed them in Zymurgy and other brew type
 catalogs for about $49.00 for a half yard and more for yards.  Then I went
 to the outlet mall in Gilroy California and ventured into the glass outlet
 store ( which is now being merged with the Corning outlet store ) and lo and
 behold they had yards, half yards, and foots of Ale!  The great thing is that
 the prices were $29.00 for a yard, $19.00 for a half yard, and $11.00 for a
 foot!  These are the exact same as the ones I've seen in the catalogs.  I got
a half yard which holds 32 oz to the brim.  This is great for a big brew of
22 oz or 25 oz.  I was told the yards hold 60 oz.  If anyone wants the phone
number to this store I have it at home.  I don't think they mail order but
maybe they can do something.

Yep, you can use #800 wetordry, use it wet, (the dust would be _bad_ to
breath). This will leave you with a `ground glass' finish. Actually,
depending on how much glass you wish to remove, you might want to start
with some #400 or #600, then go to #800, then maybe even #1200 or
#1600. If you have access to jewelry polishing equipment, you might be
able to get it down to a smooth, shiny surface again. Watch out for
heat buildup if you're using machines, it'll crack the glass. 
Lots o' work.


Good luck.

Perhaps you should have bought The King of Slugbait, Budweiser.  An issue
of Zymurgy last year noted that in a study done at a university in Colorado
(I think), Budweiser was preferred by 5 out of 6 slugs!


The advertisement potential is staggering!  What better endorsement could a
brewer ask for?  Swedish bikini team move over.  Here come the Bud Slugs!

Subject: Cooper's Extract & Yeast


Al Korzonas mentions good results from Cooper's kit yeast.  I have to
had my agreement.  If I was absolutely unable to find a clean liquid
yeast and had to use dry yeast, Cooper's is the only strain I'd risk.  I
made a couple of batches with it a few years ago (with two cans of
Cooper's extract, no sugar, and some finishing hops) and made an
amazingly good ale.  I also had WYeast clean up the yeast and brewed
with it as a pure culture and it was a bang-up strain.  I think the
primary brewing yeast is very vigorous and this makes up for the slight
contamination (yes there was some).

Subject: AHA mead competition




This is a commentary on the BOS judging at the AHA nationals in 
Milwaukee.  I base my comments entirely on facts outlined in Friday's
HBD by Gordon Olson (thru Michael Hall).  Based on those facts and the
Rules and Regulations governing the AHA competition, it is clear that
the first and third place awards in the Traditional Mead category and
the BOS award, Mead Maker of the Year, and perhaps top club award
should all be changed.


First let me say that I know none of the principals involved personally.
Neither Byron Burch, Micah Millspaw, Gordon Olson, David Welker, ...
Nor do I question in any way the integrity or sincerity of any of the
people involved.  In fact, it is transparent by Gordon's post that
he is conscientious, sincere, honest and well-intentioned.  He should
be respected and commended both for the integrity he brought to the
competition as well as the candidness of his post.


However, the Rules and Regulations of the competition were not followed
on the last day of judging and this directly affected the outcome in
both the traditional mead class as well as BOS.  The rules clearly
state that the BOS judging will involve the 1st place winners from
each class.  A mistake was made, apparently by David Welker, in
bringing the 1st, 2nd, 3rd place to the BOS judging.  The judges
then erred in judging the 6 meads although this is quite
understandable considering the organizer presented them for 
judging.  Finally, score sheets from the previous round were
altered in order that the BOS judging appeared to be within
the rules and regulations.  In other words, the judges were aware
of the fact that they could not award the BOS award to the 3rd
place mead in a class.  


These series of mistakes, however honest and well-meaning they were,
have seriously diminished the integrity of the competition.  Fortunately,
I believe all of the data is available to correct these errors and
restore the credibility of the competition.  The rules and regulations
were followed through the finals of each class judging. It is a
simple matter to award the proper award to Micah Milspaw and Byron 
Burch based on those results.  The BOS award should properly
be awarded to either Micah's mead or the 1st place mead from the
other category based on the scoresheets of the final day of
judging as the rules clearly suggest.  That is easily done if
the AHA retains copies of the scoresheets.  If the AHA does not
retain the scoresheets, it is not which of those 2, and only those
2, should get BOS.  I would suggest it be awarded jointly in that
case.  (i meant to say it is not CLEAR which of those, and only
those 2 should get BOS).  Finally, it is my understanding that the
club competition was very close this year and i suspect that
a proper amendment of the results inthe mead competition might 
well affect that as well.


I am not a judge nor a member of a club (except D.U.M.B., donalds
united making beer) nor have i entered a competition for several years.
But I do think competitions have a good deal of value for 
homebrewing, but that value is greatly diminished if the integrity
of the competition is compromised as in this case.  Hopefully, this
will be rectified by the AHA in the near future.


Finally, I wish to emphasize once again that I do not believe for
a second that Gordon Olson nor anyone else involved did anything
other than make an HONEST mistake.

Subject: Accessing the Homebrew Archives.


I apologize for the length of this but I think it's necessary given
the number of people having problems accessing the archives.  Besides,
the length of the digests seems to have dropped a bit since the MALTMILL
lottery debacle.




The Homebrew Archive at Sierra.Stanford.EDU has been very active of
late.  At the same time there have been a lot of errors reported when
people try of access files incorrectly.  To help those of you who have
been having problems and to help keep my mailbox clean I thought I'd
post a short tutorial.  Following are instructions for accessing the
archives either via ftp or via mail using the listserver.  Appologies
to those of you to whom this is old news, but we were all young once :-).




FTP Access:


This is the preferred method.  Use your local ftp program to connect
to Sierra.Stanford.EDU, do not use the telnet or rlogin programs.  If
your system can't resolve the name you can try using the IP address,
36.2.0.98, instead.  Once connected to Sierra you log in as "anonymous"
or "ftp", either will do.  No password is required but tradition and
courtesy says that you should type in your user id and hostname in
place of the password (i.e. name`at`host).


Once logged in you connect to the homebrew directory.


        cd pub/homebrew


The commands "dir" or "ls" will show you the files and directories
there.  Unless you know exactly what you want I recommend that you first
retrieve the index of available files.


        get index


Many of the files are compressed (these have a .Z suffix) and a few are
PC or Macintosh binary executables.  You will need to set the transfer
mode to type binary BEFORE you get these files.  You do this by typing
"binary" to the ftp prompt.


        binary


Since a binary transfer mode will work on text files as well, I generally
make it a habit to set to binary mode first thing.


When retrieving files in a subdirectory you can either connect to the
directory and then get the file or you can stay where you are and
get the file by specifying the relative path name.  The following
are equivalent:


        cd 1992                                get 1992/9206.shar.Z
        get 9206.shar.Z


For those of you unfamiliar with Unix (tm) conventions, the parent
directory is referred to at "..", so to move up to the parent directory
you would type


        cd ..


To make use of compressed (*.Z files) or uuencoded (*.uu or *.uue)
files you will need to have the uncompress or uudecode utilities on
your system.  C language versions of these utilities are available at
Sierra in the pub/source directory.




Listserver Access:


A listserver is available for those of you without ftp access.  The
listserver looks for certain commands in the body of a mail message and
mails help information or requested files back to the originator.  The
listserver software on Sierra is VERY picky about the format of its
commands so you have to be careful.


The standard for internet text messages (rfc822 if you care) says that
a mail message consists of several header lines (To:, From:, Subject:,
etc.) separated from the message body by a blank line.  The only line
in the header that the listserver cares about is the From: or Reply-To:
line, so the Subject: and other header lines are ignored.


The listserver expects that the body of the message contains only
listserver requests.  If it sees anything that it doesn't recognize it
will generate an error message and stop processing the message at that
point.  Several people have mail utilities that generate special memo
format lines at the top of the message body.  These confuse the
listserver and cause it to reject the message.  Other people put one or
more signature lines at the end of the message.  Since these lines are
at the end of the message they don't stop the listserver from
successfully processing the requests but they will cause it to generate
an error message (both to you and to me).  To avoid this you should
follow the convention that says that signature lines are preceded by a
line beginning with two dashes (--).


Mail to the listserver should be sent to listserv`at`sierra.Stanford.EDU.
If you haven't used the listserver before I recommend that you first
ask for the help file.  Send a message to the listserver consisting of
the word help on a line by itself.  To get a listing of the files
available from the homebrew archive put the following on a line by itself.


        index homebrew


The "get" command is used to get to have the listserver send you a
copy of an archived file.  The general format of the get command is


        get <archive> <file>


The archive of the digests from November 1991 are stored in the file
9111.shar in the 1991 directory.  To get this file send:


        get homebrew 1991/9111.shar


The listserver will in some cases break files into pieces if they're
larger than 100K.  The index indicates when a file will be sent in more
than one part.


The current month's digests are stored as individual files.  They are
stored under the homebrew-new archive so in order to get one of this
month's digest before they're archived send:


        get homebrew-new NNN


to get issue number NNN.


Here's an example of a request for the homebrew index file and a copy
of the shar file containing the Digests from November 1991.


        To: listserv`at`sierra.Stanford.EDU
        Subject:  (not required)


        index homebrew


        get homebrew 1991/9111.shar                


        --
        SIGNATURE


If you have a problem with or questions about the listserver send mail to


        listserv-manager`at`Sierra.Stanford.EDU

I guess that there is a lot of interest in Maple Ale as I have had many
messages asking for a post on the recipe. Anyway I just used a basic pale ale
recipe and added the maple syrup. I decided to use Scottish crystal malt(I
bought it from the Home Winemaking and Brewing shop in woodland hills, Ca.(home
of the Maltose Falcons ;-)) because it had such a rich, thick, malty aroma. I
think that this would make a good base for a christmas ale by adding some
cara-pils(I think that a good christmas ale should be a little heavy in the
mouth feel), and an assortment of various spices and orange peel. The recipe
called for 5 lbs. of malt extract syrup. The reason for 5 lbs. not 6 was that I
had used the other pound for priming of another batch and also in making
starters for my yeast. Anyway here is the recipe:


                          Pale Maple Ale


  6 gal.        brewing water
  5 lbs.         Malt Extract Syrup(Amber)
0.5 lbs.        Scottish Crystal Malt 80L
0.5 lbs.        Wheat Malt(dry extract)
  1 qt.                Maple Syrup(Dark, Grade A)
  1 oz.                English Goldings hops (5.2%) 60 min. boil
0.5 oz.                   "           "           "  (5.2%) 30 min. boil
0.5 oz.                   "           "           "  (5.2%) 10 min. boil/steep
  2 tsps.        Irish Moss
  2 tsps.        Gypsum
  1 pkg.        Wyeast #1028 London Ale yeast


Procedure:
1. Prepaired yeast per instructions on package. When yeast pkg. was swollen I
added it to 500ml sterile starter.
2. I steeped the crack crystal malt in 2 qts. 150 F water for 30 min.(I put the
pot in the 150 F preheated oven) Sparged the grain into the boiling pot with
another 2 qts. of 170 degree water. Added enough water to bring volume in
boiling pot to 5 gallons. Brought this to a boil.
3. Added Malt Extract syrup, Wheat malt, gypsum, and 1 oz. hops. Boiled for 30
min.
4. After 30 min. of boil, I added 1 qt. Maple syrup and 0.5 oz. hops. boiled
for an additional 20 min.
5. At 50 min. mark of boil I added 2 tsps. Irish Moss and the last 0.5 oz. of
hops. I let this boil for additional 10 min. then covered, turned of flame, and
allow it to steep for 5 min.
6. Chilled, strained, and racked into primary fermenter. Pitch yeast.


SG        1.054
OG        1.008


Notes:
The ale was in the primary fermenter for about 5 days(it had a head on it that
was about 4 in. tall). Transfered to secondary and allowed to finish ferment
(another 7 days). I used 1.5 cups Malt extract to prime.


I tried the ale after 5 days in the bottle and was extremly pleased with the
brew. The only thing is that it is a little dry(lost some of it's
sweetness(maybe another 0.5 lb. of crystal)). I will do this one again, but I
think that I will use another yeast type (maybe Wyeast european ale #?).


(I hope this will be of some assitance. Sorry if I rambled on, but I think I
broke my little toe this morning and the medication is taking its toll)

>From time to time I go off on a tangent and brew nothing but one
particular style of beer.  I do this in the hopes of getting the style
down cold through repetition and experimentation.


My latest style of study has been Imperial Stouts.  I have been brewing
this style all summer, ten batches all together.  Talk about a beer out
of season.  Ahhh, drinking a full-bodied, high gravity beer in the heat
of July (rawlp!).


Due to it's neutral qualities, I used Wyeast Chico ale yeast (#1056) for
all batches.  Onc interesting discovery is that reusing the yeast cake
after a high gravity beer made the second beer exceptionally dry.  In
fact the beers using repitched yeast were so dry they were unpleasant and
subsequently dumped.


Many interesting Imperial Stouts were produced.  The one I liked the most
had all the trappings of an Imperial Stout but without that expected
alcoholic flavor.  A Big Beer without the Burn.  The alcoholic strength
was present but the corresponding alcoholic flavor was masked by the
"brick house" body.  The beer was so thick it looked like 10-40w motor
oil.  Really.

I'm trying to get an opinion about a Bruheat knockoff called the Thorsen
Electric Bin.  I haven't had much luck with response from the folks on
Compuserve.  Has anyone out here used and/or heard of the Thorsen Electric
Bin?


>From the advertisement, I can tell that it is similar to the Bruheat anly it
is 117VAC and is a little slower to come to temp.


Any response will be appreciated.

Does anyone have any information on how glass styles came into existance?


What is the reasoning behind using a Pint Glass, Pilsner, Mug, etc?

I have used MailServers and ListServers before, even Telnet and FTP commands,
but I am unable to retrieve files from the ListServ`at`sierra.stanford.edu.


Can someone help me out here?


I've read the help file and tried several variations of GET, but all that 
I find in my mailbox is something like "...no such file exists."

Subject: Aerating wort


Over the last week I've seen several references to AERATION of wort.  Sounds
like oxygenating the wort.


I'm a beginning homebrewer on my second batch.  Is this something I need to
be concerned with?

Subject: homebrew and headaches




I don't recall the specifics, but in Charlie P.'s book TNCJOHB
he mentions that using a blow off tube will force out some of
the nasties that "can" be attributed to causing headaches.
This was in one of the sections focusing on brewing with extracts.
I don't use a blow off tube myself, but haven't had a problem
with headaches either.
