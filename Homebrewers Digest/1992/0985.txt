Pierre Jelenc, pcj1`at`cunixf.cc.columbia.edu shares an interesting
point about the contents of a chanpagne package of Wyeast:

First, if the pack was swelling before puncture, it was probably a 
defective sample. The other interesting point is the contamination
level.  We examined a pack of Wyeast Ale (I dont recall which one)
in the spring and were astonished to see the quantity of peddiococcus
(spelling??).  Just another data point.

I have noted this same phenomonon.  It seems particularly noticable in 
highly hopped american pale ales, typically when Cascade or Centennial 
hops are used.  I also noted the same thing when I was drinking the 
Alts in the Altstadt area of Duesseldorf.  I suspect some correlation
between very high hopping levels and citrous notes.  I'm sure there is
a good chemical explanation to this.

>From 'Penguin Book of Homebrewing and Wine-Making'
Basic apple wine
Mixed apples  8 to 16 lbs
sugar as standard syrup  2 to 3 lb
pectinaze
rohament P
acid blend if necessary
yeast
A.P or white wine as starter
vitaminzed nutrient as starter


Summarized: wash apples, rinse and crush apples and put in sulphited water
before they go brown.( 1 campden tablet per gallon). Cover fruit withnot
more than 6 pints of water in which pectinaze and rohament P has been dissolved
and leave for 24 hrs, after which the apples should be pureed. Add hot water to
 bring to desired gallonage at fermentation temp and stir in sugar, nutrient
and yeast starter.
After a week strain off pulp, put under fermentation lock and proceed as
'usual'. Drinkable at 3 months, better at 6.
For cyser, substitute 1/2 pint white grape concentrate for 1/2 lb sugar.
For mead cyser
honey 2lb
apple juice 1/2 gal
acid blend 2 teaspoons(check pH, about 3)
tannin 1/4 teaspoon
vitaminized wine yeast nutrient
mead, white wine or A.P. yeast starter
pectinaze 1 tablespoon


Ferment apple juice. nutrient and half the acid should be added.
Diluted honey, rest of acid and tannin are mixed together and added immediately
 after first fermentation slackens.


Dissolve honey in warm water and sulphited at 100 ppm (2 tablet per gallon),
dissolve other ingredients and make up to desired volume. leave closely covered
 for 24 hrs before yeasting.
Acid mix - 4 parts each of malic and tartaric and 2 parts of citric. juice of
2 lemons will do in a pinch.




Never tried any of this.

Subject: Clorox+ammonia=phosgene


Stuart Siegler suggests (tongue in cheek?) mixing
Clorox with ammonia. This produces phosgene, a 
poison gas used by both sides in world war I.
When it is inhaled, hydrochloric acid is formed in
the lungs causing them to fill with fluid. This can
be life threatening.

I'll be in Vancouver, B.C. in a couple of weeks.  I've had some pretty ok beer
there at Granville Island Brewery.  Is there anything else worth checking out?
How about a good downtown pub (or two or three)?

Dave Coombs asks about peeling oranges:


I use a lot of orange zest: for brewing, for an occasional cocktail, but
mostly for putting in my morning cup of black coffee (try it, you'll like
it). Here's how I do it:


Take a whole unpeeled orange and with a standard potato/carrot peeler slowly
slice a spiral of zest from the "north pole" of the orange to the "south
pole". With a little practice you can even get it all off in one cotinuous
strip. I keep the excess in a small glass jar in the fridge. If you like,
leave the peel out on the kitchen counter for a few days. It will dry and
curl up. This will keep in a jar in the cupboard. You can grind the dried
peel into a powder to be used in your spice beer or you can use it fresh. I
find the veggie peeler makes it easy to remove the zest and not the white
part (the pith) which is very bitter.

Subject: Re: Orange Peels


Dave Coombs <coombs`at`cme.nist.gov> asks about zesting oranges.  The
easiest way to do this is, of course, to use an orange zester.  Such a
tool can be had for $5 or so (US) at your favorite kitchen supply store.


Just so you know what you're looking for, it will have a handle, then a
small curved head with sharp holes in it running parallel to the handle.
Sort of hard to describe, so I'll try a silly ASCII picture.  This is
looking at it from the front, down the length of the handle:


                         -------
                        /       \
                        O-O-O-O-O


You simply scrape it along the peel, and the holes gouge out thin strips
of the outer peel with no white pith.  The reason you want to avoid the
pith is that it's very bitter; all the essential oils you want are
contained in the orange zest.


Since everyone is gearing up to make Xmas brews (including me), here's
an easy recipe that turns out extremely good.  I'm normally an all-grain
brewer, but it's easier to make large quantities of extract brews for
parties and things, and the spices tend to cover up some of the extract
qualities.  Of course, you could use the same spicing technique for an
all-grain batch, too.


Remember to go easy on the spices.  The flaw with a lot of commercial
Xmas brews is that the spices overwhelm the flavor of the beer rather
than complement it.


        Quick & Easy Spiced Brown Ale


        MountMellick Brown Ale Kit
        3-4 whole cloves
        3 whole cinnamon sticks
        1/4 tsp nutmeg
        4 oranges
        1/8 cup fresh Hallertau hops (leaf)


        Simmer spices, hops, and zest of 1 orange in 1 qt water for
        30-45 minutes.  Make brown ale according to 3.6 gallon recipe.
        Add spice mixture (do not strain) and zest of other three
        oranges to wort.  Ferment, strain, and bottle according to kit
        instructions.  The flavors balance very nicely after only a
        short aging time, but it gets better after a couple of months.
        An excellent holiday beer.

Dear Brewers


I have a couple of things to post:


First, I'll me moving to a new e-address, so any personal responses
should go to xlpsjgn`at`luccpua.it.luc.edu (John Norton).  I'll still be
at this present address until the end of the month (I think?).  I'll
be re-subscribing at my new address soon.


Secondly, my appologies to the HBD net for a short personal, but I need
to contact ERIK (of Glo:gg fame) re: Glo:gg here in the Sweedish Village
in Chicago.  I couldn't find the Glo:gg essence - with the high alcohol
content - but did find a glo:gg "mixer" of sorts.  It comes in a 16oz(?)
bottle and might be usable in the later stages of the boil??  Please
advise.  And/or, if anyone else on the HBD can advise us as to using
something like this, please let us know.  It's not in a concentrated
form, but is , well,  like a mixer like you'd get at a grocery store:
just add the booze.


Finally, I just wanted to say that I bottled the Weiss I'd been brewing
and snuck a peek at it after only 2 days in the bottle.  With the
exception of an expectedly low carbonation (it should get better as the
brew matures) I thought it was quite good, but still not the Weiss-
like brew that I'm used to; it didn't have the characteristic Weiss
bite, but more of a Samule Adams taste (like I said, I'm not complaining
Papezain's recipe (this was what I used) says that it should be ready
in a few more days - 10 max - but is this really enough time for an
all extract, 50/50 wheat weiss to mature?  Thanks in advance for any
reactions.

In a recent (981?) HBD, Russ Gelinas asked about a upcoming Wyeast
version of steam beer yeast.


I was at Kedco on Long Island on Saturday (10/3).  They had JUST
recieved a Wyeast shipment (dated 9/30!!).  One of the offerings
was "California"; I'm _almost_ certain the number was 1214.  The
fellow at the store said it was to be used at ale tempretures, but
could be "lagered" in the secondary (I hope I'm quoting correctly).
This is probably your answer, Russ.  I bought a packet, but haven't
tried it yet.


If anyone has/does soon, please consider sending me a short post
about what primary/secondary temperatures you used.

Dave, I use a citrus peeler made by Sunkist.  It has a "zest peeler" on
one end of it.  You can get them at most any grocery store in the 
produce dept.  They are only a $1 or so.  The motivation for removing the
white fleshy part of the rind is that it leaves a bitter flavor.

To summarize the responses I received, the motivation for using citrus
zests is to get the great oils that lie near the surface of the rinds
without the bitterness from the "white stuff" underneath.  Potato
peelers have been suggested.  I'm not sure it would work much better
on the slippery rind than the grater did, but it might.  Another
suggestion is a nutmeg grater.  Here's one response verbatim.  Thanks

I saw a device that is designed for zesting fruit.  I'll try my hand at
ASCII drawing:


            Side View:                      Front View:
   -------------------===========             _______

The device has a smooth metal plate much like a spatula that rides on the
fruit's rind and a sharp 1/8 inch square "box" that cuts the zest.


My mother showed me the unit though I'm not sure where she got it.  I would

Subject: Yeast Starters


I recently bought Dave Miller new book,_Brewing the World's Great Beers_
(I think that is right) and was reading his section on making yeast
starters. He says to put some noble hops in the starter, in the past
I have never done this. I believe the reasoning is the hops offer some
perservative action. I use a presure cooker to can by wort and believe
that 10 min at 240 degF should kill any unwanted living things. I am
sure that the pressure cooker does a far better job than adding hops.


I do have a couple of question about making starters,


Do I really need to boil my DME before canning? When I remove my wort
for the canner it is boiling away so in effect I am boiling it twice.


Should I transfer the trub from my canned wort into my starter jar?
It has been stated that the yeast will use the trub as it starts to 
ferment so I have always transfered this to help the yeast start.


Happy Brewing

Subject: cider


Garrett Hildebrand, Andy Kurtz and Charles Spiteri (+ others?) have
been pursuing a cider thread lately.  My $0.015:


You can make a great beverage, simply and quickly, from "soft
cider" and ale yeast.  However, I _strongly_recommend_ yeast nutrient.
I have some stuff that seems pretty standard.  From "Wine Inc."
A 2 oz. bag cost <$2 and has enough for many gallons (1 tsp/gal).


The following is embarassingly easy for any brewer, and produces
good results. Start with a 0.5 gal. or 1 gal. bottle of juice.
All that seems to matter is that it's sugar- and preservative-free.
I've used juice reconstituted from concentrate as well as stuff that
has never been concentrated.  Filtered as well as unfiltered.  "Ye
olde all-natural family farm" brand as well as major US food
conglomerates.


Remove the top.  Pour off two cups.  Drink one, mix the other with
yeast nutrient and dried ale yeast (I've used Edme).  Return to the
bottle and affix an air-lock.


  Q:  Does anybody use Wyeast with cider?  Which variety(ies)?


A starting gravity in the 1045-1050 range seems typical.  Final gravity
will be near 1000, so it's quite dry and apt to be - ahem - cidery.
It also has a fair kick to it, being 6% or more alcolhol by volume.
Siphon it off the dregs and drink immediately or bottle.  You can
pour more juice (with nutrient) on top of the dregs for your next batch.
I get good results in 10 days, but I suspect it would be acceptable in
a week.  Before I started using yeast nutrient, it took longer.
In any case, bottle aging gives a mellower drink.


I've never had `vinegar' problems, but the nose does recoil a bit at
the first whiff upon removing the airlock: lots of alcohol and acid
seem to get trapped in the head-space.


For either sweet cider or strong cider, add a pound of brown sugar
per gallon.  With ale yeast, the alcohol whould eventually kill the
yeast leaving residual sugar.  Alternately, use champagne yeast to
get something the strength of table wine.  The latter needs months
of aging to mellow out.


I have 3.5 gallons of regular and one gallon of sweet fermenting now.
I'm thinking about experimenting with added fruits later this season.
In fact, I added half a pound of raisins to the sweet cider, following
a recommendation in the HBD two years ago.  Has anybody tried other
fruits?


Cheers,

There are two breweries in Indianapolis. The first to open was the
Indianapolis Brewing Company. They are a micro, not a brewpub, so you 
can't drink there (unless of course you know someone :-). Their Dusseldorfer
Alt is quite good, although it wouldn't please a true Alt-head. At one point
they landed an account at the Hoosierdome, selling their Pils to basketball
fans during Pacer games. This was something of a coup, giving them some much
needed public exposure. They've had their ups and downs, but are hanging in
there. If you call them (317-898-1235), they'll be happy to tell you where 
their accounts are, which would be a good starting point in seeking specialty
beer houses.


The best place I've found to imbibe in Indy is the Broad Ripple Brewing
Company. As the name suggests, this pub/brewery is located in the Broad
Ripple district, very near 65th and Cornell. They make some good beers
(their ESB won a gold at the '91 GABF), and carry an interesting variety
of midwestern micros. Proprietor John Hill drives all over the midwest
to keep his establishment well stocked. 


Indiana's archaic laws have forced John to jump through some hoops, including 
making the pub and brewery two separate businesses with separate addresses. 
They are in a single building, but there can be no doorway directly between 
them. To go from pub to brewery, one must go outside and down a sidewalk and 
then into the brewery. This can be fun in January. Initially John was told 
that there could be no beer lines running between the two businesses, and 
that he would have to keg the beer in the brewery and wheel it down the 
sidewalk. He managed to get around that bit of stupidity, but must still 
maintain separate records of each business, and "sell" his beer from the 
brewery to its only customer, the pub. Last I heard business was doing well.


Enjoy,

Subject: Wyeast Problem?




     I recently brewed two batches of different beers on two consecutive 
     days.  For the first, I used two packages of dubious yeast:  A 
     (yikes!) Red Star Ale and the yeast supplied with a M&F Old Ale kit.  
     I brewed an India Dark Ale (at least, that's what I call it).  I made 
     up a starter by taking out two tablespoons of boiling wort and adding 
     water to cool it to 100 degrees F.  The second batch was a stout, and 
     I used Wyeast Irish Yeast.  The package was completely inflated with 
     CO-2 when I cut it.
     
     Here's the interesting part.  The IDA began visible fermentation 
     within two hours.  It took the Wyeast 2 days to begin actively 
     fermenting.  Is this normal?  Both are fermenting side by side in the 
     same closet, and both brews were essentially identical with respect to 
     sanitation practices.  What gives?
     
     Incidently, what do you call a beer that uses an India Pale Ale recipe 
     (including oak chips) with 3 of the seven lbs of light DME replaced 
     with dark DME?  Is there another name for India Dark Ale?

   Did anyone out there in HB-Digest Land get a chance to make it to the
Great American Beer Fest in Denver this past weekend?  I got to go, but
only made it one night (therefore, I missed out on a lot of the beers 
that were there).  There were over 700 beers there this year (I think I
tried to taste them all!!!).  I was curious to hear what others might
have to say regarding favorite beers/brewers, etc.  Personally, I tried
one from somewhere back east (I think) called Pumpkin Spice that I
fell in love with...(the trick was that it had no pumpkin at all in it).


Either post responses or feel free to mail me directly,

  While formulated in a recipe today I realized how empirical most of my OG
estimates are when doing an extract/partial mash recipe. For mashed grains I
know that I get 28-30 pts/lb/gal.  However, I don't even really have a rule
of thumb measure for extracts.  Obviously each brand will vary and I wonder
if anyone out there has a chart that says for lists pts/lb/gal for different
brands of syrup and DME.  I'd guess that DME gives about 38  pts/lb/gal and
most liquid extract give around 34 pts/lb/gal.  However, again rather 
intuitively, I think I get the about the same O.G. using say 2  4lb. cans of 
Alexanders or 2 3.3lb cans of M&F.


Anybody out there got any info,
Walter

Subject: Trappist Ale (?)




This coming weekend I'm planning a brew that I hope will be a something 
close to a trappist ale.  Being the first beer of the new brewing season,
I'm doing a "quick and dirty" partial mash.  I'm using the Belgian malts 
for the first time.  The grains will be:


1.0 lb Biscuit malt
0.5 lb Belgian Crystal (what is this 50L)
0.5 lb Special B (120L ?)
0.5 lb Roasted Chocolate


I'll mash the above for 45 minutes or so and then sparge.  And boil with
6 lb of Northwestern Amber Extract and 1 lb of pure dried wheat extract.
The expected OG will thus be in the 1.055 to 1.065 range.
Hopping rate will be 35 IBUs worth (? this may be wrong but I'll look it 
up) of Tettinger pellets and Kent golding plugs, at least three additions
with a Tettinger steep and a Golding dry hop. I popped my belgian ale 
Wyeast and will make up at least a 16 oz starter around thursday (brewing
saturday night). This will be a full boil with an emmersion chill.


So what does the collective consciousness think?  Will this be at all in right
general style? (this is an off the top of the head recipe) Will the biscuit
malt have enough enzymes for a happy mash? does it matter?  should I use
some pale malt?  I don't know if Golding dry hops are appropriate but
they're spicy finish seems like it should be OK. Besides they're sooo good
I can't resist. I'm I just hopelessly lame? ;-}


Thanks in advance for any comments/advice,
Walt

 >I will always remember my evening at Zum Uerige, drinking perhaps the
 best beer I have ever had, and watching the staff roll the wooden barrels
 out to be dispensed by gravity. (I wonder if the wooden barrels have
 something to do with the magical flavor.
 
 When I was in Munich, I noted that the Hofbrau Haus did the same thing and it 
 would depend on your opinion of that beer.  I suspect it is not considered to 
 have any magical flavor :)

 All the time.
 
 >if so why?  
 
 Because my starter is a pint drawn from the previous batch after chilling.  
 It is my last hydrometer sample and instead of risking contaminating by 
 pouring it back, I use it to start the next batch (after sterilizing of 
 course).  Aside from that, it gives the yeast a foretaste of what it will be 
 doing soon in a big way.  Seems like a reasonable thing to do.  There are 
 those who would dilute it down to about 1.020 but I quit doing it when it 
 didn't seem to make any difference.

 >The colonies growing from the Champagne yeast package described in my
 previous post have now been examined by several knowledgeable people in
 the micro department. The large colonies appear to be healthy
 Saccharomyces, but the small ones are in fact bacteria!!
 
 You are violating net protocol.  Wyeast is NEVER contaminated.
 
 > They appear to be some sort of bacillus, thin rods which aggregate easily, 
 clearly not E. coli or salmonella.
 
 Just for the record, E coli is a bacillus.
 
 >The consensus is that it should not be too surprizing that bacilli grow
 poorly on YPD plates, especially since many if not most are anaerobes
 and these plates were aerobic.
 
 E. coli is aerobic and faculative anerobe.
 
 >There are now two problems, therefore: where does the contamination
 come from, and why were there yeast both in the inner and outer
 compartments.
 
 It's a conspiracy :)
