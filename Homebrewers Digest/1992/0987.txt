Is not WYeast #2112 'California Lager' yeast the high temperature lager yeast 
that everyone is asking about?? I have used it two or three times with good 
success making steam beers ( about all that seems possible at times, in east 
tennessee).  Also, it appears that WYeast uses 2000 series numbers for their 
lager yeasts and the 1000 series for ale yeasts and 3000 series for some 
others (Wheat beer yeast, I think).  Anyway, thats my dimes worth!

  I just wanted to let other HBD'ers know about an article in the months
Popular Mechanics.  It's a brief two page'r about Homebrewing, micro-brews,
and (mostly) the new Zip City brewery in NY City.


  It's worth a 5 - 10 minute stop at the magazine rack in your nearest
drug store. :-)


  They do a nice job of summarizing how Zip City makes and dispenses their
brews, which is not in the usual fashion.  Check it out.

Subject: Wyeast California and Belgian


I posted in HBD 985 about Wyeast 1214 & Wyeast California. 
In HBD 986, Phil Hultin suggested that they are not one in the same.
Phil is right.


   California is 1212


   Belgian    is 1214


Both are newer Wyeast strains, so there is no corrresponding check-off
box for either on the package.  The number is written on the package
in pen without a name for cross-reference.  So, when I visited Kedco
on Saturday, I was given the wrong package by mistake.  An honest
mistake by the folks at Kedco which I had know way of knowing about.
Many thanks to Phil for pointing out the problem; I would have been
mighty surprised (and confused) if I'd made steam beer with Belgian
yeast!


Ken at Kedco says that California, despite having a 1000-series number,
is a bottom-fermenting yeast.  It works well at temperatures up to 
68 Fahrenheit.  Sounds like Steam Beer to me.


Cheers,

  So, Micah, are you saying that homebrewers should make a yeast starter
out of a plain ol' powdered sugar solution?  I think we might be in for
a discussion....


  Jack S.: You're concerned about nitrosamines which are found in malt
which has come from gas-fired kilning.  Do you have any numbers wrt. the
amount of these chemicals in such malt, as opposed to the amount found
in say, a grilled hamburger, or toast?

Subject: wort coolers.


    I've been ploughing through back numbers of the HBD, thinking about
making a cooler from 3/8 tubing as most notes seem to recommend, and I noted
how many people were concerned about saving water, or whose tap water came
too warm to use. Here's an idea, (it might have been suggested before though)
 Make TWO coolers, and connect them in series. Put the first in a bucket of
ice-water. Fill the complete system with water from the tap, then connect the
inlet and outlet to each side of a drill-powered pump (Pump outlet to the ice-
bucket). Bingo! a cooler, with minimal water usage. It even keeps the wort on
the outside where the tubing can be cleaned! and if the drill is a variable
speed job, you can optimise the flow rate!
   Any comments? any criticisms?
       Happy brewing

Have you ever had problems with secondary fermentations of residual
sugars (that is, any exploding bottles)? Since you gave no priming info,
I assume this will produce still cider.  Have you ever made carbonated
cider?

In answer to the questions about my post of Quick-n-Easy Spiced Brown
Ale (in digest #985, in case you missed it).


> 1) What type of yeast to use... I'm assuming it'll be an ale yeast,

Just use your favorite ale yeast.  I used dry before, but will probably
use liquid this time around.  The spices will help mask any mild
infections, if you get one.  I suppose you could make this beer as a
lager as well, but the fuitiness and esters in an ale seem to go well
with the spices.

As it was supposed to be Quick-n-Easy, I did do a single stage ferment.
I don't think, though, that racking after 5 days or a week would hurt
the spice characteristic.  Remember, the recipe calls for simmering the
spices beforehand to "extract" the flavors.  The hop addition to the
simmer was just an afterthought, and the beer turned out well enough
that I didn't want to mess with the recipe.  The small amount used
wasn't enough to cause any clogging problems, either in the airlock or
at bottling time.

Of course!  My recipe certainly isn't the only one out there.  I just
happened onto a combination of beer and spices that balanced very
nicely.  Other good spices might include corriander, allspice, cardamom,
ginger....  Just go easy on them so you don't overpower the beer.  You
can also vary the base beer to get different effects (use a different
kit, hop your own, or brew all-grain.  Of course, it gets less
Quick-n-Easy the more involved you get).

 Boston Stock Altbier?/Seabright Brewery
Hidy ho neighbors,


I was on vaction last week (honeymoon actually) so its taken me a while to
catch up on my digest reading, and consequently I am a little late catching on
to the Altbier thread.


When I returned, I found the results of the '92 GABF in my mailbox and saw that
Samuel Adams Boston Stock Ale had won a gold in the Dusseldorf Altbier
catagory. No silver or bronze was awarded.


Now my question is:  Is Boston Stock Ale really representitive of the
Dusseldorf Alt style?  Or did the The Boston Beer Company enter it in a
catagory with no other entries so that they could win the gold medal necessary
for their tried and true marketing campaign?  "Samuel Adams has won a gold
medal at the Great American Brew Festival N years in a row."




On an other note.  While I was on my honeymoon, I happened upon the Seabright
Brewery in Santa Cruz CA.  One of their special brews was call Century Red and
my wife, not being much of a hop-head, loved it's dark, sweet maltiness.  Has
anyone out in HbD land tried this and if so could you help me make a guess at
an all-grain recipe for it?  I tried to talk to the brewer, but he was at the
GABF picking up his three, count 'em,  (1 gold, 2 silver) medals.  While I only
tried the Red, it sounds like they brew a good deal of quality ale there.

I'm not a chemist, and can't directly answer your question, but here's a
data point and more speculation.


Plastic soda bottles are usually made of PETE, polyethylene
terephthalate.


When hard liquor (e.g. 100-proof vodka) is packaged in "plastic"
bottles, the material used is almost always clear polycarbonate
("Lexan").  Since I'm pretty sure PETE is cheaper, there must be
another reason they don't use it.

The former message about mixing bleach and ammonia was incorrect.
Phosgene contains carbon, bleach does not.  There is no way to form
phosgene from this mixture.  However, (mono)chloramine IS formed and
is nasty.  Incidentally, this is now commonly used as the sanitizer
in municipal water supplies, since it is longer acting than chlorine
gas (and unable to form chlorinated organic compounds at the use level).


Just had to clear up the chemistry a bit.

In HBD #986, ZLPAJGN asked:


> If this is the case, then wouldn't pelletized hops be better than leaf?


Offhand, I can't think of ANY situation in which pelletized hops would
be better than whole flower (NB: it is the flower, not the leaf, that we
use!).  This is, of course IMHO.


Perhaps some of you out there can suggest advantages for pellets I am
unaware of?


BTW, The best hops I currently know of are packaged in 1/2 oz "bungs",
which consist of, you guessed it, 1/2 oz of fresh whole flowers
compressed (not minced and packed)  into a plug.  On addition to the boil,
the bung expands and releases the whole flowers into the brew.  I have
got mine via my brother in Vancouver, but they come from Morris Hanbury
International Hop Merchants (USA) Inc., in Washington State.
