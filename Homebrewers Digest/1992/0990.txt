I would like to brew some pre-hops beer, and wonder whether or not any one
has information of the use of yarrow to bitter the brew?
thanks.

I was just looking at a recent HBD where I posted the article Eric

attribute him for the effort and wish to apologize now for not doing
so.

Subject: Bass Ale: I.P.A. or "just" P.A.


   This is my first entry to the HBD, so if any errors are made, please
forgive me. I have a question about Pale Ale. Is Bass Ale a Pale Ale or
is it an I.P.A.? I noticed on the bottle there are the initals I.P.A. and
I thought it was "just" a pale ale. 
   Also, I have the Cat's meow as well as Papizan's tomb and was wondering
what any of you may reccomend in the way of a P.A. or I.P.A. recipe.
   Has anyone ever tried Summit Extra Pale Ale? I live in Minnesota and
it's made here. I had some and it tased kind of burnt to me, espically
in comparrison to Bass. Thanks for your time.

In Andersonville, in Chicago, you can buy this essence from Ericsson's
Deli, around 5500 N. Clark.  It's is a few doors north across the
street from the Swedish American Museum.  Also, Wikstr|m's Deli,
across the street sells it.  At Ericsson's, it lies on a shoulder high
shelf on the far right side of the northern wall of the store, near
the front door, next to some various syrups.


The stuff is ok, but if you want to make gl|gg, use the ingredients
instead.  I don't like the bottle mix - (Den {r ganska d}lig...)...
The "essence" is water-based, same as the essence here in Sweden.


Of course, if you're going to waste it in some beer attempt, buy the
bottle.  (I can post my family's recipe if there is interest.)
Incidentally, you can buy gl|gg at Ann Sather's restaurants in
Chicago, one of which is right next door to the Swedish American
Museum...


Say "hi" to the old lady at Ericsson's if you go...

   Does anybody happen to have a source for soda keg lids.  I can get a few
kegs but the lids are missing.  These are oval shaped lids with a lever on top
to hold them in place.  Thanks for any info!

   What is the fermentation schedule of Steam Beer?  Does it follow
a simple English ale type time frame, or does it require some longer
fermentation time like a lager?

OK brewers, start your engines! We have decided on the catagories for this 
 years Bay Area Brewoff, at Lyon's Brewery in Dublin, Ca. The competition 
 will be held on Jan 24, 1993. Last year we had a Holiday beer catagory as 
 an experiment. The response was so good, we are going to do it again. So 
 start thinking about those holiday beers now! The other more traditional 
 catagories are as follows -
 
 Pale Ale - American, India & English
 Dry Stout
 Porter
 Barley Wine
 Amber Lager (Steam style)
 Mead (all types)
 Holiday beer
 
 I will post additional competition entry details in coming months.

Subject: Beer Prices at Brewpubs


We have a "new" brewpub opening in the area whose beer prices I consider too
expensive.  Please send me via private mail your knowlege of prices at your
local brewpubs.  Please include the price per quantity (if you know the prices
of several size quantities, please send them all!), name of brewpub, location, 
and your feelings as to whether the price is reasonable.  I consider 
$1.75 for 8 ounces OK to take guests to try 3 or 4 times a year but NOT good 
enough to make it a regular hangout.  If I get enough responses, I plan to
share this information with the new owners to try and get them to adjust their
prices.  THANK YOU!!!!!

          Gold: Olde English 800 Malt Liquor, Pabst Brewing, Milwaukee.
          Silver: Silver Thunder Malt Liquor, Stroh Brewery Co., Detroit.
          Bronze: Colt 45 Malt Liquor, G. Heileman Brewing Co., La Crosse, Wis.


What is this this stuff?  What makes a beer a malt liquor?


Just Curious.

>Does anyone have any experience with this item?


Well, one batch, still in the fermenter. So far, I like it. It does not
leak. I have drawn off the trub, yeast, and hydrometer samples without
opening the system to infection. This is very important in my house
because the kitchen is _uncleanable_ [carpeted floor, dropped ceiling,
stuccoed walls, and two indoor/outdoor hunting cats].

Subject: Food w/ Beer, Gloegg, "Crabtree" vs. "Pasteur"


A trice of random thoughts:


The Goose Island Brewery in Chicago serves homemade potato chips that
I found to be quite excellent with beer. Very low (if any) salt,
lightly sweetened and spiced -- kind of a honey-roast flavor. If anyone
knows where I can buy chips like these, please tell! (Goose Island is
serving an incredible Oatmeal Stout right now, and didn't even card
me!)


John, I have seen Gloegg / Glo:gg for sale in Chicago. I don't know
exactly where you were looking, but I came across it in a little
Swedish gourmet shop on Clark just a couple blocks north of Foster. It
was availible there in August, anyway. (Would've emailed you, but I
can't do Bitnet.)


Quick question for Dr. Fix and the other yeast experts: What are these
so-called "Crabtree" and "Pasteur" effects that you-all keep
mentioning? Hmm?

drink in public establishments.

  Jack, I counldn't resist this one. I, and most other homebrewers,
 while appreciating the appearance of our beers, even more appreciate
 the taste, with which (i hope) we have no trouble. Perhaps if you brewed
 something other than the WGB or ARF the taste would be more to your
 liking and you wouldn't have to relie on appearances, after all they
 can be deceiving.

Subject: Cranberry Ale?


Hello


I just racked my first Christmas ale into a secondary and tasted it. 
Wonderfull stuff. Now I don't want to make a plain ale next time I brew. 
Since it was Thanksgiving this past weekend in Canada I had the idea of 
adding cranberrys to my next batch of beer. 


Q1..How much cranberry should I use? Do I crush them?
Q2..Should I add a sweet berry to offset the sourness of the cranberries?
Q3..Anyone with a recipe for an extract cranberry ale?
Q4..Fruit are added at the end of the boil, steeped and transfered into the 
primary. When I rack the beer to the secondary do I also transfer the fruit?


Thanks for any help. I would also like to thank the digest for helping me 
move up from a beginner to an intermediate brewer.

Subject: Looking for anchor extract recipe


Hello Fellow Brewers - 
        I am looking for an extract based recipe for anchor
steam beer.  I don't want to seem picky, but I am looking for
something you have actually
made, twiddled the recipe, and as far as you know uses the
same hops, yeast as anchor.  
I know Papazian has a recipe, but I have gotten the
impression from reading HBD that the results are good
but not great.
        Since I have the great fortune to live near
the brewery, I am planning on a tour soon too to learn
what I can.  I'll summarize results/info on batch.
Email is fine.


Thanks,

Hi!


I'm ready to invest in the equipment necessary to keg my beer into
soda kegs.  I know that this topic has been discussed at length
from time to time here on HBD, but unfortunately, I'm not sure
where to get all I need to know in one place.  Ideally, any
ftp site with the necessary info would be great.  I need to know
about the relative merits of the different kegging systems and
what equipment is necessary to implement such a system.  Another
IMPORTANT bit I need to know is where I can purchase the kegs, 
regulators, and CO2 cylinders at the most reasonable prices.
Mail-order is OK, but I'd like to find a Boulder/Denver source
if possible (gotta support the local economy.)
