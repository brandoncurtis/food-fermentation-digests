Can anyone in the know out there post a description of American Wheat Ale.
I've sampled "AWA's" that have been so close to Weizens that I don't know
why the brewer differenciated. On the other side of the spectrum, many
micro's (Dave Miller's being an example) brew a wheat ale that is so 
pedestrian that you'd never know there was wheat in it (The main reason for
the beer seems to be to have an exotic name yet still appeal to the timid
masses).  So what's the "official" line on American Wheat Ale?


Enquiring minds want to know,

Subject: Our Man Tim


Tim Norris asked that the following be posted:


Siebel is restructuring themselves and in the process are shedding some
of their distribution responsibilities, of which the Belgian malts is
one.  Schrier will be picking up the Belgian malt distribution and expect
an increase of maybe a penny per pound.  While Schrier will concentrate
only on supplying micros and brewpubs, they have no plans to allow any
one single distributor to handle the retail side.  If an malt gets
dropped by Schrier, it will be replaced with a higher quality malt to
replace it.


So the bottom line to the nervous nellies (myself included) is that the
Belgian malt supply to the US is not expected to be interupted, the
price will rise ever so slightly, and no one single retailer will be
allowed exclusive distribution rights.


The question now is: how trustworthy is Schrier?  Will they keep their
word?

In HBD #990, Jack Thompson asks:


> I would like to brew some pre-hops beer, and wonder whether or not any one
> has information of the use of yarrow to bitter the brew?


Although I cannot answer the question directly, I can say that there was a
book (I don't know if it still in print) called "Recipes for Prizewinning
Wines" by Bryan Acton (or it may have been Peter Duncan).  It had a recipe
for Yarrow Wine in its herb wine section and that may serve as a starting
point for you.  The author said that this wine was used primarily for
medicinal purposes.  It tasted awful (but then again, there was probably
no sweetness to balance the bitterness) but was supposed to be a great
help with colds and catarrh.


I cannot find my copy; I bought it in 1973 or so and lost it during a hiatus
in brewing.  I have not seen it in stores sinces then.  It was published by
"Amateur Winemaker" - the same folks who publish Acton & Duncan's "Progressive
Winemaking".


If you cannot find that book, you also might want to check C.J.J. Berry's
book "First Steps in Winemaking."  He has a bazillion recipes including
an "Onion Wine" so he may have tried yarrow by now as well.


Good luck!

Hey now-  It was bound to happen, right?  I brew the best batch of my
short brewing career- a liberty ale-ish thang that is perfectly clear,
perfectly balanced, basically just perfect.  I dry-hopped in the 
secondary with hops grown in a friend's garden (thanks bonehead!) 
and let it sit for about 2 weeks.  I racked to a tertiary on Sunday
to let some residual hop junk settle out and planned to bottle
on Monday or Tuesday.


So I head down to the basement yesterday after work to start gathering
bottles and from a distance the beer in the carboy looks like it has
started to ferment again 'cause there's some sort of head on it.  I move
in for a closer look.  My draw drops, my eyes roll back in my head,
a blood-curdling cry echoes throughout the house.  The surface of the 
beer is covered with a thin white scum.  It's kind of lacy looking with
little fuzzy nodules here and there with vein-like things extending 
into the film.  It looks like the stuff the people had on them when they
crawled out of the pods in "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers."  


I made a valid attemp at bottling anyway, although I'm sure the bottles
will develop the same thing since it looked like there were little pieces of 
stuff floating throughout the bucket when i primed.  It still tasted 
and smelled okay, so I don't know.


Any thoughts on what it is?  I didn't do anything to the hops before I 
added them to the secondary, but I think if it was caused by them it would 
have appeared sooner.  I sanitzed the carboy in my usual manner (bleach 
soak) and basically did nothing different from my usual routine?  I'm 
pretty bummed, so any info would be greatly appreciated.  If the scum 
forms in the bottle I would be more than happy to send some to anyone 
who wants to take a look first hand.

Subject: re: glo:gg


     Several people have commented on glo:gg essence and I just thought
I'd put in my .02.  John was saying that he wanted to make his own
extract from the glo:gg spices that he had purchased but it
was mostly raisins.  It is true that glo:gg is
served with raisins in it, but I don't think that is what it is spiced
with.  The raisins are added in addition to the spices.  So if you are
going to steep the spices to try and make your own tincture I would lose
the raisins.  But, why not just add the spices at the end of the boil
like finishing hops? instead of trying to make a tincture.


     Kurt (and others) have mentioned that the essence is available
in the Chicago area.  He says that the extract is water based just
like that found in Sweden.  If this is the case then to make your
own extract all you have to do is steep the ingredients in water
to get the goodness out of them.  I have glo:gg essence that I
bought in Valbo, (right outside of Ga:vle) Sweden from the pharmacy
(apoteket).  It is not a water based mixture but is alcohol based,
and is what I will be using to make a Christmas ale.  As I have
mentioned before, it comes in 25 ml bottles and is 63% alcohol.
If you would want to make a tincture like this I suggest making
up a solution of grain alcohol, the spices and water.  Make the
volume of alcohol 65% and water 35%.  Heat this covered until it
comes to a boil.  Let cool and strain off the spices.  I have never
tried this so you might want to heat it a little longer. Experiment|


     Kurt also mentioned he had a family recipe for glo:gg.  I have
spent Christmas in Sweden, and I have tried many different family's
glo:gg but noone ever gave me a real recipe.  If you post it I would
greatly appreciate it.

Subject: Insulating my boiling pot?


Last night, I was watching my 5+ gallons of wort barely boiling, with
the 11000 BTU burner on full blast under it, and was trying to figure
out what I could do, short of buying a "Cajun Cooker" (and propane, or
extending my gas piping outside), to get it to boil faster (or at
all!)  


I dimly recalled a posting in this forum several years ago wherein the
brewer wrapped his pot in some sort of insulation (newspapers?) to get
better performance.  Since I've got a black pot (ceramic on steel) I
imagine that there could be significant heat loss from the sides of
the pot.  I tried wrapping newspaper around the pot, but it started to
char (sitting on a gas burner, after all).


Then I cannibalized an old water heater insulation blanket that I
had never used.  Figured the fiberglass wouldn't burn (but see below).
I did pull off the plastic backing.  This worked, and I was actually
able to sustain a vigorous rolling boil with the lid partly covering
the pot.  But I'm not happy about having that "naked" fiberglass so
near to my food.  


*** So, here's the question: Has anyone figured out a good solution to the
*** problem of insulating the sides of a large pot?


Along the way, I tried to put the pot over two burners, but the
configuration of my cooktop makes this essentially impossible (the
control knobs end up underneath the pot -- not a good situation).  I
did manage to melt/burn a little of the fiberglass in the process.
(It smelled sort of "plastic-like", so maybe it's not really
fiberglass.)  Those gas flames are hot!

Subject: what is am malt liquor? / beer vs ale etc.


An American Malt Liquor is a blond lager with an alcohol strength
stronger than an American Premium.  I am not a commercial brewer,
and am not certain of the law here, but I believe the cutoff is
something like 5% alcohol or something like a 1.050 starting
gravity.  The analogy might be to the German Pilsner and German
Export styles, with the latter being higher in gravity.  Of course,
the American beers are nowhere near so hoppy as the German!
In my humble opinion, most American Malt Liquors are rather sweet
and undistinguished in taste, or at least that's what I recall.


U.S. law imposes certain labeling requirements on the commercial
brewer.  A "beer" falls below the above cutoff, while an "ale" or
"malt liquor" fall above.  Again, I invite someone with more
knowledge of commercial brewing and the law to add to this.  But,
you'll notice, for example, that Old Foghorn labels have described
it as "a barley wine-style ale."  I'm guessing that they must call
it an ale by law, and by describing it as a barley wine style, they
are clueing us in as to its strength and style.


In a related vein, you will notice that some of the German import
Oktoberfests are "beers," while others will have a label such as
"Oktoberfestbier."  Examples of the former tend to be lighter in
color, less flavorful, and, it seems, under 1.050 or so in SG.
Examples of the latter include Spaten and Paulaner, which in my
opinion are tasty and exemplary of style.  In "Vienna," George and
Laurie Fix point out that many of the German Fest beers are in the
1.051 - 1.055 SG range, which would make them "bier" and not
"beer."  Or, so I am surmising.

Subject: pale ale vs ipa/what is bass ale?




Historically, India Pale Ale was a high-gravity, highly hopped,
pale (as opposed to brown) beer brewed to withstand the sea voyage
to British colonial outposts, where you can imagine that it, along
with gin, was a drink of choice.  Today, such a beer would be
called a barley wine.  


While there are shadings of style rather than a sharp demarcation,
AHA style guidelines at least indicate:


       pale ale      india pale ale
SG   1.044 - 1.056   1.050 - 1.060
BU      20 - 40         40 - 60
color    4 - 11          8 - 14


Terry Foster's Pale Ale book suggests higher gravities, higher
hoppiness, and less crystal malt in the grain bill for IPAs.  Also,
as already pointed out in HBD, NO OAK CHIPS!  In actual commercial
usage, the above guidelines haven't been strictly followed.  Bass
Ale's label has changed repeatedly through the years, but as noted,
carries an IPA designation, while in fact it is a pale ale by the
above style descriptions.  A glance at CAMRA publications shows
that "IPA" has been used by certain breweries to refer to what are
actually bitters which are well below 1.050 in SG.


To emulate Bass Ale, follow the pale ale guidelines and use British
ingredients (malts or extracts, hops) and an appropriate ale yeast.
Anyone have a recipe that is a bass ale knockoff?

>Q1..How much cranberry should I use? Do I crush them?


I made a cranberry beer using a little under 3 lbs of Ocean Spray 
cranberries.  They were frozen in the fridge and I pureed them 
right before adding them to the wort.  They were added right after I 
turned the heat off and their semi-frozen state brought the boil
straight down. 


Then after letting them steep for ten or so minutes, I threw in an
immersion wort chiller and took the temp down to 80F.


>Q2..Should I add a sweet berry to offset the sourness of the cranberries?


My cranberry ale came out to be light and tart.  It has a nice flavor
profile on its own.  Add it only if you want to change the flavor of the
end product to something sweeter, but try not to overpower the cranberry
flavor too much.


>Q3..Anyone with a recipe for an extract cranberry ale?


My notes are at home, but I took this as a variant of something I saw
in the Cats Meow II.  


        5 lbs Light Malt Extract
        1 lb. sugar
        1 1/4 oz Fuggles (Boiling 30 min)
        3/4 oz Fuggles (Finishing 10 min)
        Irish Moss
        Gypsum
        Munton & Fison Dry Ale yeast
        
        3 lbs pureed frozen Cranberries


I got two cases out of it.  If you want the exact recipie, ask me on
email and I'll go drag out the notes.  BTW - I primed with brown sugar.




>Q4..Fruit are added at the end of the boil, steeped and transfered into the 
primary. When I rack the beer to the secondary do I also transfer the fruit?


I had a strainer over the funnel hole and would let the wort drip through 
it.  Then I would press it a bit with the ladling spoon and scoop it out
into a bowl.  This took a little while, and some of the wort was left
behind in the saturated cranberries (I used hop bags and grain sacks so that
there wasn't a lot of other stuff).  But I topped it off with some tap
water (gasp!) and got a nice two cases out of it.


Some of it was bound to get through though, and sometimes I find a cranberry
seed in the bottom of my beer.  I recommend you start NOW so that the
beer may age properly - this is something that gets better with age.

As I believe someone else mentioned, the hops are for antibacterial

I'm reconsidering my technique (I'm thinking about using higher-gravity
starters, based upon what George and others have written), but I've been
using 1 ounce (weight) of light DME in 16 ounces of water, boiled 10
minutes, then cooled for my 1.020 starters.  At $9 for 3 pounds, that's
19 cents per 16 ounces of starter -- hardly expensive.  Perhaps it's more
humid by you -- that's the only reason I can think of it being messy, but
during my normal (Oct to June) brewing season, it's not humid enough to
make my DME cake-up if I keep in in a sealed plastic container.

Perhaps, but this conflicts directly with Noonan's claim that if yeast
is given a high-glucose environment, they shut down their maltose
(di- and tri- saccharide, I mean) metabolism pathways in lieu of (as you
said) the "easy sugars."  Noonan suggests that yeast raised in a high-glucose
environment will take some time to re-start their di- and tri-saccharide
pathways, resulting in longer lag times.


However, Bob Jones has reported *no increase in lag times* from switching
to sucrose starters and Micah gets 2 hour lag times (see below), so perhaps
this is an error in Noonan's book?


Then, in a followup post, Micah says:


>  So heres what I do to just build up a starter.
> I boil water and powdered sugar together with some yeast nutrient for


Ahhh... I wondered about this after your first post.  On the other
hand, as we know from Rob Bradley's post, not all yeast nutrients
are alike.  What kind of yeast nutrient do you use, Micah?

Given the fact that you use yeast nutrient, I willing to concede that
perhaps sucrose+nutrient is a viable alternative to malt extract for
starters.  In addition, you note that you add additional sugar with
successively higher concentrations, which is acclimating the yeast for
their plunge into higher gravity wort -- seeings how this increase in
gravity (and osmotic pressure) is gradual -- this may be the best
argument for this use.


As I see it, all that needs to be determined is if Noonan is right or
wrong (biologically, I mean, as there are already Micah's and Bob Jones'
empirical data points that Noonan has, at least, overstated it's importance)
about the increased lag time from yeast raised on glucose.  Perhaps Noonan was
not using nutrient and thus was creating weak yeast?  George's post on
the EBC's results seems to support the malt starter argument, but perhaps
they did not use nutrients with the non-malt starters either?  Mead-makers
have repeatedly reported problems with amino-acid-deficient ferments.


Personally, I think I will continue to use malt extract, but will try
incorporating Micah's "successively higher-gravity" procedure.

Subject: Pressure cooker & Labels


I'm almost as excited about this, my first posting, as I am about tonight's
decisive NLCS playoff game.  What a great reason to have a homebrew!
First a question:  My neighbor just got hold of a 5-gallon pressure cooker.
We wanted to use it for brewing (extracts and specialty grains).  Has anyone
out there in network land ever brewed this way?  Do you reduce boiling time
due to higher temperatures?  What about adding hops, etc.  Will the higher
temps damage the "enzymes" in the malt or produce nasty by-products?  Any
help would be appreciated.
Also - I've been following the labeling debate & thought I'd mention my
variation.  I use small round "file markers" from the office supply store
to label each bottlecap.  They come in many colors, but I just use one until
the package is gone.  I simply number each batch in my "brewlog" and post a
chart on my refrigerator.  Each bottlecap has a number on it corresponding to
the batch.  A look at the bottlecap and a look at the chart tells me what 
kind of beer I've just grabbed, and reminds me to close the fridge door.

Malt Liquor is largely just a legal term.  Some states in the US
require any beer over 6% alcohol by volume to be called Malt Liquor.
Therefore you get some good imported beers, like barley wines, dopple
bocks, etc. getting labeled "Malt Liquor" just to satisfy varying state
laws.  You also get a class of boring American light lager which gets
called the same thing on purpose.  The above beers have little more
character than your typical Budweiser/Coors/Miller type beers.  They
just have more corn syrup added to the fermenter to give them more 
alcohol.


As has been pointed out, the only reason GABF gives awards for this swill
is so they can stroke the big brewers who sponser the event.

I was just wondering if anyone out there is familiar with the Mendocino
Brewing Company. I have spotted a few bottles of their product lately
and wonder if it is worth a purchase. If anyone knows anything please
post it.  MANGE BABY!!!!  nothing but cheese all of the time!  ---Rick

        There's a place near where I live in Worcester, MA. called
        the Scandinavian Bakery and they sell Glogg base (what they
        say is used to make Glogg) in quart bottles.  


        The phone number is 508.755.0474


        $4.40 for 25.44 ounces


        The basic scoop is you use equal portions of the base and vodka, 
        some port wine and a seasonings        bag that has the raisins, orange
        peel, and other stuff in it.


        Give them a call if you're interested.  Tell them MahlerHund
        Breweries sent ya (the dog kennel that brews beer).  ;-)

Subject: Hop substitutes?


Hello,


I have recently been informed that way back in the old days, 1700's or so, 
that the plant species Myrica gale was used to bitter beer instead of hops. 
Has anyone tried this and how much do I use.  It grows around any lake here 
in NNorthern Ontario. Also, are there any other common plants that anyone
uses to bitter their beer instead of hops?  I've made tea with the Myrica 
gale and I'm wondering if I should make a tea and then add it to the wort or 
if I should just boil the dried leaves in the wort.


On the topic of hops. Where do I get rhizoids for growing my own hops?
What type should I use a 43 degrees N latitude?

Don't mean to be nosey, but I saw this address in a post on Fidonet and thought I would investigate.


Is this a conference or a private address? ?


I just started homebrewing and wouldn't mind conversing about the hobby.

 >Lowenbrau Dark took exactly one medal: a Silver in the Dark Lager catagory.  
 I assume that what you`re really trying to point out is that several 
 catagories seemed to be dominated by the megabreweries.
 
 Not at all.  What I am pointing out is that, unless Miller changed the recipe 
 since first introducing Lowerbrau Dark, the only way they could win a medal 
 in the Dark Lager catagory is if it was the only dark lager entered.  It is 
 pitiful at best.  It is nothing but caramel colored Miller.
 
 >  This is no accident - the characteristics of these catagories were 
 designed to allow the megabreweries to win some medals.
 
 Dark Lager?  You gotta be kidding.  That is about as general as it can get.
 
 >Some people may cry `foul` for this.....
 
 Not me, I say farce.
