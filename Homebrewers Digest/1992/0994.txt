Subject: Pilot batch, unhopped


Just before the Yarrow thread began, I got a notion I'd like to
brew some unhopped ale.  I made a half-gallon pilot batch yesterday
while brewing up a regular (5 gallon) batch of porter. My experience
may illuminate Chris Cook's question in HBD992 about brewing 5 x 1 gal
batches and the responses by Brian Schuth and Al Korz.


With 8-10 lb. of grist, UK malt and a hanging bag sparger I get
a pretty consistent 30-33 pt/lb.  I mashed 1 lb. Munton & Fison pale
ale malt and sparged in a large strainer (arranging the grains to
follow the shape of the strainer -- a flattened hemisphere -- with
uniform thickness) with the usual amounts of mash and sparge water
scaled down to 1 pound.  The result was 1/2 gallon at 1048, a
miserable 24 pt/lb :-(


In a few weeks I'lll let the list know how this unhopped ale tastes.
Is the lack of hops likely to affect the fermentation in any way?


Cheers,

Subject: Reynolds Tapper - info?


hey folks.


This past weekend I acquired a 2 1/2 gallon mini-keg called a "Reynolds
Tapper."  It has a built-in tap (labeled "Falstaff" which I assume is some
cheap Yankee beer :) and is barrel-shaped, meant to lie on its side, cask-
style.  It is filled from one end, and the sealing cap has some funky
valves and a gas cylinder in it.  It looks like the idea is, you fill this
with beer, stopper it, and charge the cylinder with enough CO2 to dispense
the brew.  Neato.


So, the question:  does anyone know where to get specs, info, replacement
parts etc. for this thing?  Are they still in use north of Mason-Dixon
somewhere?  Can anyone tell me what sort of tools/fittings are necessary
to open and close the stopper, and fill the cylinder?  The valves are truly
weird looking and the HUGE snapring holding on the stopper is a real pain.


This little keg would be great to keep in the fridge with half-a-batch of 
HB, or to take to parties sans CO2 setup, if I could just get it refurbished.

Subject: 8-to-10 gallon boiling kettle ...


I have now made three all-grain batches and it has become clear 
to me that a larger kettle would be helpful.  I currently have a 
5 gallon kettle and find myself having to evaporate the wort down 
to add more of the runoff.  Does anyone have any recommendations 
on a place which sells 8 to 10 gallon kettles at a reasonable 
price.  I do have one restriction  ...  my stove has a flat 
heating element and the bottom of the kettle needs to be flat to
contact the heating element.  I was able to find a 33 quart kettle,
but it had a concave bottom and would not contact my heating element.
I would like to get past this problem and try out several recipes 
in mind.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


                                   Thank you!

Hi-
I'd like to prime with molasses.  Papazian suggests 1 cup/5 gallon batch.
Unfortunately, he doesn't specify the type of molasses.   As many of you have
guessed, the beer is Yorkshire's Old Peculiar and the list of fermentables
includes 2#s dark brown sugar.


I have 12oz. of Brer Rabbit dark `full flavor' molasses I'd like to use. The
question is, how much?

known as sweet gale, bog myrtle (cf HULTINP`at`QUCDN.QueensU.CA in #993) or
meadow fern; deciduous aromatic shrub, grows throughout northern
hemisphere, leaves and branches are used in England to season ale. No

    I tried all last week to contact Lee Nicholson, co-founder and original
Brewmaster at Birmingham Brewing, but was unable to reach him.  I called the
brewery and talked to John Zanteson, who is the current brewmaster.  Lee had
hired John, who came from Mendocino in Hopland, when he was still with the
brewery.  Anyway, John said that Lee had been in arbitration hearings all last
week over his status with the brewery and his lawyer partner.  No decision has
been returned by the arbitrator yet.  Lee may be reinstated in the end but I
think that John is more than capable of brewing a quality beer, as long as the
lawyer will let him.


    As for the taste changing, I'm not sure.  The Red Mountain Red Ale was
first brewed for the City Stages festival in Birmingham.  Lee said that they
tweaked the recipe for that brew after the first run but I don't think it has
been changed since.  The Gold Ale and Golden Lager were both shipped on the
first brewing run, one of Lee's major complaints against his partner.  Lee
felt that they should brew a test batch of each before putting it into the mass
market in order to fine-tune them and get them right.  The lawyer won out and
the gold lager we got briefly here in Huntsville (on draught) was cloudy.
They may have been fine-tuning these brews in the field so to speak.  We just
got the Red Mountain Red in bottles here last week and it tastes quite good.
It is still better on tap at Dugan's in Birmingham but I'm glad to have the
bottled version in town.  I don't think they've shipped the Gold Ale or
Golden Lager up here in bottles yet.  They also brewed a wheat beer but they 
only brewed a single run and it is almost gone according to John.  They have 
not yet decided whether to brew it again.  I also asked about the possibility 
of them brewing a Christmas beer but John said that the packaging costs for a 
special brew were prohibitive at this time.  He said they plan to "do some 
specialty brews" starting in the spring.  I'll post more after I talk to Lee.

In practice, however, it doesn't happen. I know a few people who use
pressure cookers all the time without ay problems. The biggest hazard
is getting a hop seed stuck in the valve (they fit quite nicely) which
results in the safety valve blowing (and the ceiling of your brewery gets
re-decorated). Construct a gauze filter around the pressure valve inside
the lid to prevent that happening (Another use for that window screen stuff
you have over there?). 


With pressure cooking, boiling time can be reduced (15 mins at 10lb might
be enough for some beers).
However, you don't get as much reduction in volume so you cannot sparge
as long and then rely on the boil to get the volume back down. Sparge
efficiency is therfore more important, but that might not be a bad thing.
Also you don't get as much DMS boiled off, so it might be best if you
stick to normal kettles for beers where DMS is a problem. Otherwise, try
it and let us know how you get on. Meanwhile I shall relax ...

Subject: Oops! -Lager yeast goof..




Hello,
    My roommate and I have a concern and thought this might be a legitimate
forum to ask about it.  We are relatively new to all grain brewing.  
Yesterday, we were happily brewing up our Christmas/Holiday offering.  
We were brewing a brownish ale with all of the obligatory holiday spicings
(including nutmeg,cloves,cinnamon,etc).  Everything was going find until
it was time to add the yeast.  As I was about to pour it in, I noticed that
it was lager yeast instead of ale yeast.  Being the wild and crazy guys that
we are (not to mention, the stores were closed and we couldn't get more yeast),
we decided to go ahead and put it in anyway.  Now the problem, as I see it,
is that we should allow fermentation to take place in a cooler environment
for the yeast to be able to do it's thing( is this correct?).  We do not
have an environment to do so.  Are we wasting our time allowing it to
ferment at room temperature (about 68 F.) or not.  Does anyone see any 
problems that are going to arise from this situation.  If so, is there
anything we can/should do at this point to save our beloved holiday beer.


Thank you very much in advance,

Well, I've never attempted to defend myself against charges of being
a beer snob, and I'm not going to start now ;-)!


But what bothers me more than either snobbery or bland taste is 
unwarrented pretension.  I consider Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout
a snob's beer.  It's WAY overpriced, and I refuse to buy it
for that reason, but it is definitely great beer and the snobbery
is justified.  At the other end of the spectrum is the bland
mega-brewery products we all love to bash.  Sure they're tasteless,
but they're also cheap and rarely pretend to be anything they aren't;
I tend to avoid them, but their existance doesn't bother me.


In between are the pretentious beers- little better in quality
than the tasteless stuff, but priced like a snob beer- and this stuff
bugs me.  Into this category I lump Carona, most mass market
Euro imports, most mass market Canadian beers, and, getting back
to the subject, American Wheat Ale (of course there are a few
exceptions to the rule, like Grant's and Schell's;  the stereotype
I'm bashing is exemplified by Anchor Wheat or Wheat Hook).
Hey, if Anchor and Red Hook charged $3.50 a six pack for their
wheat beers I'd have no complaint, and would even buy some for
lawn mowing purposes.  Lowering their prices they'd also sell
more to the masses, supporting the production of their good beers
and introducing more people to their well made beers. Charging
the same price as they do for Liberty Ale or Ballard Bitter is
down right offensive, and reeks of UNWARRENTED snobbery to this
accused and confessed beer snob.

Sorry for spreading misinformation.  In my last post about efficient wort

brewpubs in Santa Cruz - Seabright Brewery and Santa Cruz Brewery/Front St. 
Pub.  The third I was thinking of is Boulder Creek Brewing Co.  Boulder Creek

I'm about to brew up a steam beer and was wondering....does any one 
have any experience with this yeast at room temp?  I'd like to get a 
little more mileage and was thinking of doing up one of my generic ales 
and use some of the cal. lager stuff (wyeast 2112) after I cook up 
the steam beer.  I've got room in the cool box for only a single 
carboy at a time and the second batch would have to ferment at 
room temps (around 70-77 F depending upon how the building screws
around with the heating system).


(If no one gets around to responding by tomorrow night I'll just have to

Subject: Stuck fermentation?


I have acquired 2 15 gallon carboys for brewing beer.  I have used them for 
three batches now and I have had problems with each one.  Each time I have 
brewed in them, I simply took a 5 gal recipe and multiplied all of the 
ingredients by 3. After the secondary fermentation, the specific gravity 
would be about 1.020. This would normally mean stuck fermentation.  I can 
usually get the fermentation going again if I stir up the bottom vigorously.
I have been told that if you multiply a recipe by more than two, stuck 
fermentation is unavoidable because the centre of the carboy has a much higher 
temperature than the sides of the carboy thereby damaging active yeast. Is 
there anyone who knows how to avoid these problems for brewing batches over 5 
gallons?

Subject: Extract Astringency


I'm halfway through the starch conversion on a batch a Kolsch and
have some time to kill so I flip open Miller's TCHoHB into the
"MASH" section. Reading the steps for the 400th time I note that he
mentions that mash out in a picknick cooler requires removing a
portion of the mash and boiling it, then return to the mashtun to
raise to mashout temps. This seems to me to be a sort of
pseudo decoction mash, and got me wondering about the whole thing.


I use the stove pot - insulated box nethod for mashing and
I've never done a decoction mash, always infusions. I assume that
sparging above 168F is not good because of tannins creating
astringincy and other negative effects will result. My question for
the decocters in the crowd is; why does boiling a portion of the
grist not extract tannins during a decoction?
