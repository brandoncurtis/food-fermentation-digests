Subject: Mini Batches.  Approach/Bottles


 This is in response to a post by:


 Chris Cook
 cook`at`uars.dnet.nasa.gov$
 
 on brewing small batches.  (I'm way behind so this has probably been
 answered ten times already!   SOrry...)
 
 What I've chosen to do for the sake of experiment- is to brew a base beer
 I feel comfortable with (and pretty certain of-  ya know, no frills, just
 lots of hops!)  and then pull some aside for 1 gallon batch, and modify 
 the hell out of it.  I recently made a Pumkin Beer (way scaled down from 
 the Pumkin  mash in the Meow...)  Fruiting a third of a fifteen gallon 
 batch works well.  
 Just pull some wort aside at the end of a boi- and steep it w/fruit.
 
 What it sounds like you're after is mini-mashes.  I haven't done that.
 When I put in the time (most every sunday) to do a mash, I prefer not to
 waste time with only one gallon.  So I've scaled up.   BUT- it is quite 
 do-able, and some author type had a system for mini mashes geared at an 
 introduction to mashing.  You may need to modify equipment to handle a smaller
 volume, yet still establish an adequate grain bed.  
 


 As for gallon jugs...  Go but some cider or cransberry juice.  Drink it,
 or ferment it!  and you've got a jug! You'll just have to find the right 
 stopper.  I have a few, some from the lab, some from juice.  Right now
 I have two working on a cranberry mead (that was one bottle!)
 
         Happy hopping.  Go for it!                J.Wyllie  SLK6P`at`cc.usu.edu

Subject: more on vinegary cider


Following my earlier posting(s) on vinegary cider, here is
another thought, which follows a discussion with a Herefordshire
cidermaker last weekend.


Cider naturally has a high acidity, but this is, initially
at least, due to malic acid. I'm not sure that my palate
would distinguish between malate and acetate very well,
given a general appley background. So it may be that what
seems at first to be vinegary cider is actually acid with
malate. Apparently during the maturing process the malate
is converted into citrate which makes the flavour less "rough"
but this can take several months.


I realise that I implied in my first post that naturally-
conditioned beer has a short shelflife. I was thinking
about cask-conditioned ales here (I bottle very little of my
beer) - of course bottle-conditioned beer keeps almost for
ever (given the chance). Interestingly, cask cider does
not rely on a pressurised CO2 blanket for preservation, but on
the thick layer of aerobic fungus, dead animals, etc. which
forms on the surface of the liquid. So they say, anyway.

Subject: pellet hops


I have used pellet hops rather than leaf hops for my last two batches,
and both of them have been seriously overhopped.


It could be that the scale I use at home to weigh the leaves is
calibrated differently than the scale at the home brew shop where I
weighed the pellets.  However, Dave Miller hints that extraction rates
for pellets may be higher than for leaves.


Does anyone have a formula (formal or informal) to compensate for this
effect, or experience to suggest that the effect is minimal and
doesn't need to be compensated for?


That is, if you would use 2 ounces of 6% alpha leaves, would you use
1.7 or 1.5 ounces of 6& alpha pellets?


                Thanks,
                Laura

Just to clear up what appears to be a common confusion: yeast ARE
FUNGI.  I asked a local mycologist about where yeast appear in the
fungus taxonomy (I was taking a class in mushroom identification from
him at the time).  He said that modern classification systems place
"yeast" in several classes, depending on their characteristics.  For
example many budding yeast, of which Saccharomyces are our favorite
example, are in the Ascomycetes, while fission yeast (which split into
two "identical" cells, rather than budding) are in a different class
(I don't remember which).


I think the reclassification has been based on similarities and
differences in the DNA sequences of the various yeasts & fungi.


Anyway, the upshot is that the above sentence should read "Ragi is a
symbiotic combination of yeasts and other fungi..."

Subject: Wyeast European Ale Yeast


hi all,


any one used Wyeast European Ale Yeast??  any comments on it??


it has been said (by i assume Wyeast) that this is a slow fermenter. 
it also said the is left a brew with a malty flavor (unattenuative).


my story:


brewed a starter of great proportion (6 gallons).  let it ferment till the 
head fell.  brewed a 1.049 batch of 40 Gallons, cooled and pitched the entire
6 gallon stater.  it was slow to bubble and never got going (like others
have done).  even the starter was slow (head took long time (many days) to 
fall).  the gravity after a week has only gotten down to 1.030 or so.  it 
still bubble occasionally.  temp of the beer has been in the lower 60's F 
thru-out the week.


side note here: i usually do a "fast ferment", and i did on this one also.


the fast ferment is down to 1.010, this after a week - which is good, maybe
a little lower than i would like it but it did ferment out.  so i know the
problem is not the yeast/wort.  my guess is the yeast like it warm.


to give it the possible warmth it may need i have turned on the heater in the
room where the ferment is taking place.  overnite it did not seem to make
much differnece.  Rousing does not appear to make much of difference either. 




any daya point from the net???

Subject: RE: bottling from keg






Hi All,


In HBD#998, Jay Marshall asks:


>A question to those of you who keg...


>If you want to put some of your wonderful kegged brew into a bottle for
>consumption elsewhere, what methods do you use?  I am just starting to
>keg and would still like to be able to take some along occasionally.


   I bottle from my kegs frequently using a procedure I learned from
Bill Slack.
   A day or so in advance, put 40psi on the keg, and get it
cold, about 40F or so.  This will get the beer fairly well carbonated.
Sanitize some bottles, and put them in the freezer an hour or so
before bottling.  Get a piece of poly tubing long enough to fit all the
way to the bottom of the bottles, and slip it over the end of the
picnic tap.  Place a catch basin on the floor in front of the fridge,
this process can get a little messy.  Attach the CO2 tank, bleed all
the pressure from the keg.  Put just enough gas on to dispense the
beer (5-7 psi or so) in order to avoid excess foaming.  Insert the tube
all the way to the bottom of the bottle.  Fill slowly with beer, raising
the tube as the bottle fills, keeping the end of the tube just below
the surface of the beer.  Adjust flow to minimize foaming.  You'll figure
it out by the second bottle.  Fill all the way to the top, leave no
headspace.  Don't worry if it overflows a little.  Cap *immediately*,
the CO2 will come out of solution quickly.  I use Fischer swingtops so I
can cap the bottle with one hand, and don't have to screw around with
another piece of equipment, a bottle capper.  If you use crown caps,
keep a cap in the capper if it has a magnetic insert.  The sooner you
can get the cap on, the better.  Voila, a sediment free bottle of
homebrew, ready for a road trip.




                                  Cheers,
                                    Jim

Subject: Does dry hopping slow the terminal fermentation?






In all the posts on dry hopping, I don't recall a diuscussion of the effect 
I've seen in my last two batches of PA.


Both batches were all grain, with 90% pale malt and 10% dark crystal, and
SG's of around 1040.  For the first I used the yeast described here
recently from Young's brewery, and the second time I used Wyeast 1056. THe
major differences were when I added the dry hops (cascade pellets).


The first time I made a major blunder.  I added 1 oz of cascade pellets to
a 7 gal batch too soon, in retrospect.  This was on day three of an active
ferment, when I would normally switch from a blowoff tube to an air lock. 
Well, with the hops debris and the tendency of the Young's yeast to float
anyway, I got a slow ooze of junk up through the lock of what looked like
baby poop.  A major mess.  The real problem, though, after all that was
cleaned up, was that the ferment continued at a slow pace for 4 full weeks.
 Sheesh, I wanted to bottle but it just kept going and going.  I figured
that it was a quirk of the new Young's yeast.


For the second batch, with 1056 I wised up and waited until fermentation was
very slow.  Maybe I should have waited another couple of days, but I was
leaving town and wanted to bottle when I got back.  The hops this time
stayed in the carboy, but when I got back the ferment was still trickling
along.  Now it's three weeks and there is still active CO2 production, and
suspended yeast and sediment.  


I've never had ferments take so long to complete; I frequently bottle at
day 10 (without dry hopping).  It seems that either 1) The hops have slowed
the pace of the ferment by half or more, so it drags on and on, or  2) The
hops have somehow increased the amount of available fermentables in the
batch, maybe by increasing the fermentability of the higher sugars.


Do you guys have experience with similar phenomena?  One thing for sure is
that I will wait next time until the carboy is dead still before adding the
dry hops....

Subject: Water Quality


        
        For those of you with municipal water problems, I'd like
        to reccomend a water filter that I've been using for 3 years.
        It's made by Amtek and is also available at Sears for about
        $170 (however, a local place sells the original Amtek version
        for $100 on sale).  It's an under kitchensink model and filters
        chlorine and chloramine out of the water EXTREMELY well.  It
        uses two charcoal canisters in series and has a nice water
        fountain style faucet you can attach to your sink.  The typical
        plastic hoses used for brewing fit over the end perfectly
        which makes filling the brew pot simple while it's heating
        on the stove.  You can also use other cartridges for different
        level sof sediment, even down to 5 microns.


        The replacement cartridges are $8.00 for the carbon, 20 micron,
        ($5.00 on sale usually and they last about 1000 gallons, less
        with our water which has ALOT of chlorine).  They have another
        cartridge that claims to filter out heavy metals, including lead
        and it's $22.40 for one, so I'm not sure you need to use two since
        they package them as singles while the others are two
        in a package.  I use the carbon ones and a whole house filter 
        downstairs with a 20 micron sediment filter, which helps extend
        the life of the carbon filters upstairs at the sink (they die
        from clogging usually, not from dead charcoal).


        Anyway, considering beer is most affected by the water you use,
        it's a wise investment, not to mention that you'll have clean drinking
        and cooking water.

From: Darryl Richman <darrylri`at`microsoft.com>
Subject: re: Decoction and Tannin Extraction


The question of extraction of tannins is complex, and I do not have an 
answer.  I have got an opinion, however, which I will express in this note.


Although it would seem that the common advice to not boil grains (that 
will be used as flavoring adjuncts in an extract brew) conflicts with 
the whole notion of decoction mashing (where the thickest part of the 
mash--a concentration of the grist with little water--is boiled 
vigorously), that is not necessarily so.  The two processes are used 
for different reasons and in different environments.


Decocting is used to obtain the best extract with less than fully 
modified malt.  Such malt, which we have often characterized here as 
continental malt, not only has a lower diastatic power (fewer enzymes), 
but has more of its starch locked up in a tight, hard protein matrix, 
which protects the starchy food source from attack by molds until the 
seed breaks the matrix down to make use of it.  As modification 
proceeds, more of the matrix is dissolved.  If the malt is not well 
enough modified, some amount of starch will be unavailable to attack 
and degradation by enzymes.  Boiling the malt in a decoct, through heat 
and mechanical action, breaks open the remaining matrix.


(BTW, my experience with the imported continental malts available now 
is that there is little additional extract to be gained from decoction.)


When using malts as an adjunct to extract brewing, we are interested in 
obtaining the aroma and flavor from the grain.  It would be nice if any 
starches available were converted to sugars, but it is my perception 
that this is not usually a focus of the brewer.  In this process, a 
small quantity of malt is added to a relatively large amount of water;  
its enzymes are highly diluted, and the phytic acid formed is much 
weaker than in a full mash, making it much less likely that any 
alkaline buffering in the mash liquor can be overcome.


Glen Anderson is, in my opinion, definitely on the right trail in 
surmising that acidifying sparge water may reduce tannin yield.


It is this same pH concern that occurs at the end of the sparge, when 
many brewers will terminate the collection from the lauter tun while 
there is still some measurable extract being obtained (often at 1.010 
or even higher)--because the pH has risen above, say, 6.  As the acid 
wort is drawn off during sparging, the water replacing it has a 
stronger and stronger effect on the pH in the mash bed.  This leads us 
to the same situation as occurs in the extract brewing above.  In these 
situations of higher alkalinity, higher temperatures will increase 
tannin extraction.  I do not know what the exact relationship is 
between temperature, pH, and tannin extraction.


                --Darryl Richman

Genentech, a Bay Area biotech company, recently opened up its new
headquarters building.  A large bronce statue is placed in a prominent
spot.  What is unusual about the statue is that it is of the 2 founders
sitting at a table drinking beer.  It is intended to capture the initial
discussion they had over a couple of beers that has lead to the current
successful company.


Beer has a long history of being a catalyst for new ventures.  I think
it was Compaq computer that started off in the same way (Rod Canion drew
a picture of a portable computer on a napkin).


I suspect there is a difference from wine, which is typically drunk
after the company has been established.

So I'm finally catching up with the 10-5 to 10/13 backlog of hbds 
that arrived while I was away...

A pediococcus infection has a ropy, lacy appearance.
Note that Pediococcus is used in lambic fermentations,
requiring extended amounts of time to do its stuff.
Too bad you hopped the heck out of the batch, or you
might have a shot at converting it to a pseudo-lambic.

I suscribe to them, and personally, I wish they would create specialized
mailinglists.  I would definitely rather be on a dark ale mailinglist - 
I'm sick of receiving pilsners!


I was really happy in May when they sent out Dock Street Amber (IMHO,
the best brew they've carried), and another red ale to boot.  This month's
selection was 2 pilsners, which has kind of got me p.o'ed.  They
have yet to send out a porter or a stout, and seem to be going with
"mainstream" beers, afraid to deviate from the norm and piss anybody off.


Case in point: last month they sent out Ed's Cave Creek pilsner.  Now
they advertized Ed's Cave Creek Chili beer, but you had to special
order it, probably thinking it was too exotic to be the selection of
the month.  I subscribe to BAA so I can expand my beer horizons, and
wish they'd open up a little, sending out some off-the-wall stuff, even
if there's a person or two who may not like a particular selection.


I should also get off my butt and on the phone and talk to a person
in charge, instead of bitching about it on the hbd...

Subject: Lauter tuns


I thought that I had covered this before, but since there still seems to
be some confusion as to the theory behind the statements, I have, through
the magic of ascii graphics, illustrated the theoretical basis for my
contention that runoff from a single point is less efficient (in terms of
extract) than runoff from multiple points.  I have also taken this opportunity
to illustrate a third system, used by some, which I also feel is inferior to
the lautering system described as SYSTEM #2.  All these diagrams are gross
exaggerations of the paths of the sparge water and, at the least, the "first
runnings" will make their way to the outlet, wherever it may be.  Note that
the law of physics upon which all three of these theories are based, is:


      "The sparge water will tend to take the path of least resistance."


[Actually, it is a phenomenon called "channelling"].




SYSTEM #1
   Lautering system which draws runoff from a single point:

       |                                     |

       |...............\      /..............|                    "stagnant"
       |................\    /...............|                    sparge
       |.................\  _________________|__V                 water
       |..................\ |                    \
       |..................  |___________________  |
       |_____________________________________|  | |




Once "the sparge water (indicated by arrows) finds the path to the outlet,"
it will continue to take the shortest path to the outlet, leaving much of
the grain barely touched by the sparge water.  In addition to the direct
path, some channelling would occur along the walls and bottom of the
container.


*****************************************************************************


SYSTEM #2
  Lautering system in which the runoff is drawn from multiple points from
  the bottom, such as the "Zapap Lauter Tun" described by Charile Papazian,
  the "spargebag*-in-a-bucket system" described by Dave Miller, or the
  "slotted-copper-tube-manifold-in-a-picnic-cooler" (sorry, don't know who
  introduced this system):


       |                                   |
       |                                   |
       |                                   |
       |------------top of grain bed-------|     * Note that I specifially
       |                                   |       say "spargebag" as opposed
       |                                   |       to grainbag.  To me the
       |   |      |      |      |      |   |       difference is that the
       |   |      |      |      |      |   |       former has non-porous sides
       |   |      |      |      |      |   |       whereas the latter has
       |   |      |      |      |      |   |       porous sides.  See system
       |   |      |      |      |      |   |       #3, below.
       |   |      |      |      |      |   |
       |   v      v      v      v      v   |

       |..\ /....\ /....\ /....\ /....\ /..|                  "stagnant"
       |--- ------ ------ ------ ------ ---|                  sparge
       |    ^                            __|__V               water
       |    |                                  \
       |    perforated or mesh bottom    _____  |
       |___________________________________|  | |




Since the path of resistance to any of the holes at the bottom is equivalent,
the runoff should exit through each of them in approximately equal amounts,
thereby roughly equally distributing the sparge water throughout the entire
grain bed.  Actually, if you've got several hundred holes, the stagnant
areas would be so small, that they would be inconsequential to the efficiency.
As in system #1, channelling would also occur along the walls of the container.


*****************************************************************************


SYSTEM #3
   Lautering system in which the runoff is taken from multiple points on
   the *sides* and bottom, like the "grainbag-in-a-bucket" system:

In this case, the path of least resistance is the "holes" in the mesh bag
in the sides, near the top of the bag.  In ascii graphics, this was very
hard to illustrate, but my intention was to show that more sparge water
would tend to exit the bag near the top, less would exit partway down the
side of the bag, less and less as we look at points further down the side
of the mesh bag.


In summary, it is my contention that system #2 is the most efficient of
these three systems and virtually all lautering systems can be approximated
by one of these three systems.

Subject: Roller Mill from Junk




A good while back there appeared in the digest a series of posts
re. the possible use of conveyor belt rollers in fabricating a
roller mill.  While I don't exactly recall what all was said, I
seem to remember the thread ending with someone actually pricing
new rollors and finding the cost way to prohibitive.


Well, the idea always stuck in my head.  So one afternoon I 
decided to call around to a few scrap/salvage/junk yards to see
what I could find.  Sure enough, they all had scrapped/junked
conveyor belts.


So with a little scrounging, I've found my roller mill, basically
complete and ready to go.  As it turns out, it's not conveyor belt
rollers that you are after - the piece you are really after is 
called a 'tail-end'.  It's the unit at the end of the conveyor 
which the belt wraps around, and optionally, which provides the 
driving force for the belt.


The unit I found consisted of two rollers, 18" long by 6" dia. that
are ball-bearing mounted onto two side plates.  Each side plate has
adjustment bolts to position one of the rollers in relation to the
other.  The other roller is the driving roller and had a 6" chain
sprocket mounted on the end of the shaft.  A simple crank arm can
easily be bolted right to the sprocket for hand operation or the
sprocket removed and replaced by pulley for a motorized operation.


As I said, basically complete & ready to go and, all for only
25 bucks.  Of course it was pretty badly rusted but a trip to a
friendly sandblaster made short work of that.


After getting it cleaned up, I mounted the side plates to a 
wooden base, adjusted the roller gap to .050", fabricated a hopper
to hold the grain and mounted a crank arm to the chain sprocket - a
functional roller mill.  With hand operation, the unit will crush
a pound of grain in less than a minute.  The crush is of roller mill
quality ie. well crushed kernal with husks intact.


That's about it from the mill front ...

Subject: Weeping Radish brewpub


Visited "The Weeping Radish", a brewpub on Roanoke Island in Albermarle
sound near Nag's Head in North Carolina. It's part of a German restaurant
whose proprietor is originally from Bavaria, near Munich. They brew three
beers, a helles and an amber, which are "always" on hand, and an Oktober-
fest which isn't. There is a brewery tour available which turns out to be
just standing around looking through a large window while the tour guide
talks. It's interesting enough though, and I wouldn't let a bunch (25)
of tourists get any closer to my wort either.


We heard about some of the difficulties they encountered in getting started:
At the urging of his brother, the owner imported a "brewery" from Germany, 
which turned out to be a container full of pipes, tanks and pumps with no
hint at all regarding assembly or operation. (The brothers no longer speak to 
each other.) There were also no provisions at the time to allow brewpubs in
North Carolina, a situation which the owner was instrumental (through his
state Assemblyman) in getting corrected. The Feds insisted on a seperate
bonded warehouse to store finished (i.e. taxed) goods. He solved this problem
using a technique employed by the local tobacco industry; a line painted
on the floor dividing the bonded section from the unbonded. Another rule
required that the beer be dispensed from a "portable" container. He had
planned to serve the brew directly from the lagering tun (about 300 gallons)
via pipes to the bars. That one was avoided by attaching wheels to the tuns
(they never move).


They get their malt from Briess already cracked. Some was passed around.
I was impressed by the uniformity. Every grain was perfectly cracked (none
were crushed) and there was no flour at all. For the helles they use a mix
of 2-row and 6-row pale barley (unspecified ratio) mashed at 160F for one hour
and sparged at 170F for about one hour. The sparging effluent was visible
and was absolutely clear. Hops are Hallertauer and Saaz with a one hour
boil using superheated steam piped through a coil in the brewpot, which
is stainless steel. The guide didn't know the detailed hop schedule nor
the gravities but said the beer is "about 5%" alcohol. A very substantial
counterflow heat exchanger chills the wort to about 50F in fifteen minutes.


Fermentation is with "Bavarian" yeast for one week at 50F in open vats. 
Fresh yeast is shipped regularly from Germany and is not reused. We were
told of batches which were discarded because of the yeast being delayed
in customs. They lager at 45F for six weeks "except sometimes in the 
summer when we run short". 


Amber beer is achieved by the addition of what appeared to be chocolate malt.
 
Four people seemed to comprise the brewing staff. While we were there, three
of them were standing around (on break?) and one was filling bottles. Once 
a year a brewmaster from Bavaria spends six weeks correcting any bad habits
picked up since his last visit. 


The product is sold only at the pub either in glasses, one liter Grolsch-
type bottles or one gallon mini-barrels (tin cans). Prices are $1.75 for
8 oz, $3.00 a half liter, $5.00 a liter, $6.00 for the Grolsch-type bottle
($4.00 for a refill) and $11.00 for a mini-barrel.


Total production is 26,000 gallons per year.


The helles is good but a bit variable. I tasted two batches. Both were 
true to type but one tasted cleaner than the other. I liked the amber 
better. All the beers were better than the food.


The name derives from a snack food customarially served in the owner's
home district to accompany beer. A large, mild radish is sliced into
a spiral; salt is sprinkled into the cut and the radish is reassembled.
The salt draws moisture out of the flesh. The resultant solution dribbles
down the sides of the radish, giving the appearance of tears.

Subject: efficiency/crystal caramel malt/EBC


Hello all of you,


Two subjects:
 -    crystal malt and caramel malt
     There is a big difference between these two!
     crystal malt: the grain is soaked in water and kept at 65
     Centrigrade (for one hour), so that the strach in the
     grain is converted to sugar. After that the grain is
     heated to 110 - 120 centigrade. The water evaporates and
     the sugar gets a crystal like structure. (depending on
     the length of the heating the crystal malts gets darker)
     caramel malt: after the sprouting of the grains, they are
     heated to 160 centigrade. The grain gets the color of
     chocalate or caramel.
 -    efficiency
     I define efficiency as being:
     eff1=     'total amount of extracted sugar' * 100 /
               'total amount of fermentable sugar in malt' 


     Sometimes people define efficiency (in my opinion wron-
     gly) as being:
     eff2=     'total amount of fermentable sugar in malt' *
               100/'total weight of malt'


     I would say: eff1 is the efficiency, which is dependant
     on the method of brewing/experience of brewer. Eff2 is
     more a natural parameter, by nature some malts have more
     fermentable sugar then others. It is dependant on the
     natural process of growing and dependent on producing the
     malts.




Now I have a question related to the color of the malt. I
understand that there is defined in US the SRM or Lovibond (by
definition both are different). In Europe we have EBC (its
definition is: the number of ml of jodide in 100 ml water
which give the same color as the beer). My question to you is:
What is the definition of SRM and Lovibond?


All the best,




Victor
