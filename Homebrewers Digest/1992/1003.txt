I had assumed no stirring during the lautering -- see below.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but digest #997 is the first I've heard that you
stir the grain bed *DURING* the sparge.  I recall from one of your first
posts, that you have a bowl sitting (partially submerged) in the top of
the grain bed into which you pour the sparge water.  This seemed to imply
to me that you were not stirring.  I also believe that you had mentioned
that you used a knife or skewer of some kind to poke holes in the grain bed
to restart the runoff if the sparge got stuck (I'm not 100% sure, perhaps
this was someone else).  The reason this restarts the sparge is because
poking things into the grain bed *creates* channels -- *direct* routes to
the outlet.

I had a personal email conversation with Chip Hitchcock in which I wrote
the following regarding this same issue:

korz>If the runoff valve was off, the stirring would just, as you say, be moving

korz>(the channel sticks around for a while -- once the water finds a way

No complicated systems are needed.  Draw off a quart or two and dump it in
the top.  The reason for the turbid wort is usually a too-fine a crush.
A rollermill (such as the modified Mercado Mill or yes, the infamous MALTMILL)
is virtually essential to getting a good crush with a minimum of flour.

It seems that if this needs to be done multiple times, and the first few
ounces are turbid each time (which I'm quite sure will happen), the amount
of turbid runoff can add up, no?

Starting with a properly-crushed malt, it seems to me that a "start it and
just add sparge water system" is simpler than one which requires stirring.
Agree with you that a simple lautering system with a minimum of expensive
equipment is the best solution, so what's simpler than a couple of buckets
with some holes in one -- you can even get the food-grade buckets free
from bakeries.


Nevertheless, perhaps the only way to resolve this is experimentally.
We should, for the good of homebrewing, compare these systems and report
back.  We'll have to meet on neutral ground of course ;^).

Subject: SNPA Comments


In my haste to post a summary of the responses I received for my
requests for information on the SNPA yeast, etc., I neglected to
include the authors names that should have accompanied the
comments. My apologies to the authors, and I therefore post:


Phillip Seitz (0004531571`at`mcimail.com) went to a Sierra Nevada
tasting meeting and posted the OG, FG, grains and hops.


Tony Babinec (tony`at`spss.com) described the differences between the
bottle and draught versions, provided a sample recipe, and provided
the comments section.


Rick Larson (rick`at`melkor.uucp) was kind enough to compile and foward
the above information. He also fowarded the recipe posted, which
looks to be the best of the lot.


I also received tidbits of information reflected in the posting from
other sources, too numerous to mention.


One last thing, apparently many folkes disagree with my neo-Gaelic
spelling of recipe at the top of the recipe :).  I'll put aside my
Goidelic origins and promise to use the US version from now on......


Thanks again.....

Subject: powdered brew


  It's not homebrew, but maybe JS can freeze-dry some of his low alcohol
brew and have another product to push :-)  From Canoe magazine:


   South Hills Dry Beer Flavored Dry Beverage, consisting of "malt and
dried-beer extracts".  It makes a modest head, and "packs enough
carbohydrates" to justify drinking it (sounds tasteless).  A 1/2 oz.
packet makes an 8 to 10 oz. serving.  Add vodka/grain alcohol to taste.
$.99 each.  South Hills Dry Beverages, 765 Mimosa Ave. Eugene, OR, 97405,
503-343-3558.


   I've go no interest in South Hills, and only a curious interest in
their dry beer.

In HBD#998, Jay Marshall asks:

I strongly recommend using a counter-pressure bottle filler. When
a C-P filler is properly used carbonation of the beer is maintained
and oxygen is vertually eliminated from the bottle. They are simple to
use and maintain and are the method by which almost all commercial
carbonated beverages are packaged.

I have had some experience with big batches and one of the problems that
has to be overcome is temperature control of the fermenter or its 
surroundings. It can be difficult sometimes to keep the temperature low
enough but when things get to cold it can be even more of a pain. Your
40 gallons of liquid is a great big thermal flywheel and it will take
quite a while for it to warm up, so just be patcient. Low 60 won't
hurt the yeast but it may take a while in recovering. Don't try to
heat things up rapidly it will cause problems.
 If you or anyone else out in hb land is planning on brewing
big batches you need to come up with some sort of temperature control.
I built a fermentation room ( heavily insulated closet type room in
the shed that I brew in) and use an A\C with a Hunter air stat to control
it, it works great and didn't cost to much.
 Also, I don't know what shape your fermenter is but that can
effect fermentation efficientcy as well. There is a lot of info on
fermenter design in the commercial brewing texts, check the local library
and with the MBAA for reprints.

One of my more important responsibilities here is the keeper of
the happy hour list.  This involves addition/deletions of name,
and, of course, the weekly mailing on friday.  Well, I came up
with a good one this week (actually, I wrote last wee), and it
was suggested that I post it to a more public forum for your
entertainment:  


Emcee:         Ladies and Gentlem, will you welcome the host of our show,
         Mr. Art Fleming!
         <cheers>
Art:         Thank you, Thank you.  Today on the show we have three
         very famous people.  May I introduce to you, on the left,
         Gov. Bill Clinton!  In the center, we have independent
         presidential candidate Ross Perot!  And on the Right,
         we have President George Bush!
          [They had to put Perot Between Bush and Clinton to keep them
          from fighting:-)  Also, did you notice in the second debate
          how they had Bush on the left and Clinton on the right? - ed.]
Art:         Gentlemen, the categories for today are...
         "Beers"! ...
         "Bars"! ...
Clinton: No "Women" Category?
Art:         Just a second, we aren't finished yet, the third category is...
         "Women"!
         Mr. Perot, you won the coin toss. [A 3-headed coin?]
         Please choose a category.
Perot:         I'll take "Bars" for $100
Art:         And the answer is: "A Pint of Foster's costs $2.90 at this..."
Perot:         BUZZ! What is the Central Tap?
Art:         That the correct question! $100 to you, Mr Perot...
Perot:         Aw, chicken feed.  You know, I've been doing some research,
         and the Central Tap only Pays $122 per keg for Fosters.
         Now that works out to just $1 a pint.  That's a 190% profit!
         Even if you figure in labor and overhead -
Art:         Please pick a category, Mr. Perot.
Perot:         I'll take "Beers" for $100.
Art:         "This Bostonian lager beer was the winner of the Great American
         Beer Festival 3 years in a row"...
Perot:         BUZZ!  Hmmm. Let me take an opinion poll of the audience.
         Who thinks -
Art:         3 seconds, Mr. Perot.
Perot:         uh, Budweiser?
Art:         I'm sorry, that will cost you $100.  Would any of the remaining
         contestants like to try?
Bush:         BUZZ! What is Samuel Adam's Lager?  Such a patriot, Sam Adams,
         I really identify with him...
Art:         That's the correct question...
          [For those of you who don't know, the Great American Beer
          Festival (GABF) used to be held in a big hall, with each
          brewery having a table, serving samples to the public.
          Each guest was allowed 1 vote as to what he/she thought
          was the best beer when they were finished.  The tables
          were orignally arranged in alphabetical order, so "Adams"
          was the first beer most people tried.  There were so many
          breweries present that most guests could only sample a few,
          but nearly everyone tried "Sam Adams".  Anyway, it is only
          fitting that Bush respond correctly since he has so much
          experience rigging elections. - ed.]
Art:         and that's $100 for you, Mr. President.  that puts you out
         in front early on.  Your turn to pick a category...
Bush:         I'll take "Bars" for $200
Art:         "Bars" for $200, and the answer is:  Happy hour will be
         held at this bar on Friday the 30th, at 6:00.
Perot:         The Central Tap?
Art:         Your reponse must be in the form of a question, like it
         usually is, Mr. Perot.
Perot:         What is the Central Tap?
Art:         That's correct.  That puts you back in the race.
Perot:         Let me say that if you show up at happy hour, that I will
         be showing you exactly what happend to your beer dollar -
Art:         Please choose a category, Mr. Perot.
Perot:         "Beers" again, for $200
Art:          This traditional English ale is kegged before fermentation
         is complete, and can be characterized by weak carbonation -
Clinton: BUZZ!  What are bitters?  I tried some when I was a student
         at Oxford.
Art:         That's correct!
Bush:         Such Sleeeeeaaze.  I tell you, I really can't understand
         drinking THEIR beer in a foreign country, especially when 
         Anheusier-BUSCH is losing millions of dollars in lost
         revenue...

Art:         Your choice, Gov. Clinton.
Clinton: I'll take "Women", for $100
Bush:         Don't you usually spend more than that?
Clinton: (pointing at Bush with the 2nd knuckle of his index finger)
         Mud Slinger! Mud Slinger!
Bush:         I most emphatically deny that charge.  I have never taken

         resort to these tactics, um, I mean...
Art:         Gentlemen, Gentlemen...
Clinton: If you'll pardon the interruption, Mr. Fleming.

         Centerfold -
Clinton: Who was Dorothy Stratten?
Art:         And that's correct, Gov. Clinton.  That gives you $100,
         bringing your total to $300, giving you a $100 lead over
         Mr. Perot, and a $200 lead over President Bush -
Emcee:         BUZZ

Granted that draft beer should not be as carbonated as the bottled
kind.


Nevertheless, I have not yet been truly happy with the level of
carbonation in my kegged brew. I have lately tried to chill it a
little more, but while that improved things somewhat, the brew is
still somewhat still...


I have kegged stout, and various other ales. I prime the beer with
1/2 cup of corn sugar per 5 gal cornelius keg (with about 4.5 gal of
brew in it). The pressure in there by party time is about 25lbs.


I recently read on the HBD that hose diameters may have something to
do with carbonation, could someone expand on this?
Thanks,

In HBD 1002 Frank Tutzauer asks some kegging questions....


1. What the heck is a "cobra" tap?


Yes it is that black/cheap thing that goes on the end of a line for picnic
use. These things are silly, go out and buy a real tap and mount it though 
your frig wall. Leave the picnic tap in the closet, and use it for picnics.


2. What is line "width"?


Dave is talking about ID here.


3. What's the deal on the material composition of the line?


Line resistance or pressure drop per foot of line is dependent on the 
material. PVC line is what I use and 3/16 ID line has a drop of about 3 psi 
per foot. Therefore 4 feet has a 12 psi drop.


4. Is lift canceled out by drop?


Yes, all you have to worry about is the height of the tap. I don't think it 
is that critical in a home system. It sure is in a pub where the beer may 
be pushed up from the basement.


I wrote a short article in HBD about a month or so ago that explains 
some of the details that Dave covered in his talk. These techniques have 
vastly improved my draft system.

My question is this.....What spice, if any should I add? How much should I add?

Subject: Conversion Efficiency


 
 To: Homebrew Digest
 Fm: Jack Schmidling
 
 Much is made of conversion/extract efficiency.  If the brewer's numbers agree 
 with currently accepted numbers, one can brag about it, if not, one is forced 
 to make all sorts of excuses to avoid redicule or worse yet, lie about it and 
 cause no end of frustration for beginners.
 
 The most important thing to keep in mind is that the variables involved are 
 many and not only difficult to control but even more difficult to measure 
 accurately.
 
 The bottom line is that it is only an INDICATION of one's process quality and 
 far more a test of one's measurement skills and equipment.
 
 As one simple example, this weekend I compared the graduations on a number of 
 beakers and flasks in my lab and measuring cups in my kitchen.  The results 
 were amazing.
 
 I noted some of the beakers were labled "approx" over the graduated scale."
 I had always assumed this applied to the capacity and not the overall 
 calibration of the graduations.  WRONG!  I compared these with some others 
 marked +/- 5% and the difference was a staggering 15%.
 
 I performed the same tests on some kitchen measuring cups.  The Pyrex brand 
 was dead on and the "Ovenproof" was off by about 12%.
 
 This may seem like trivia but in order to arrive at a meaningful result, 
 every measurement error must be included in the result.  Most people do not 
 brew in beakers and flasks but some of us do use them for test and 
 measurement purposes and it is useful to be reminded that what seems obvious 
 is not always so.
 
 I note with interest that Al K has defined percent efficiency as the extent 
 to which actual extract agrees with the maximum possible as put forth by one 
 author with a particular type of malt.
 
 I find this a bit like defining the time it takes Santa to make his rounds 
 based on the diameter of the author's chimney.
 
 I suggest that we should stick to the points/per pound/per gallon to avoid 
 one more variable that just makes the results that much less useful.  
 
 It is also useful to point out that the terms extract and conversion are a 
 bit misleading and should be defined more clearly.
 
 I define conversion as the amount of sugar that ends up in the wort after 
 mashing is complete.  If one drains the mash tun at this point, the 
 pts/lb/gallon can be easily calculated and this provides an indication of the 
 mashing process, the malt, the water and other variables I probably am not 
 aware of.  This would provide the conversion efficiency or ratio.  
 
 If one goes on to sparge out the mash and makes the measurements again, one 
 now gets the extract efficiency or the ability to get the converted sugar out 
 of the mash.  This now depends on the lautering system and process and has 
 nothing to do with conversion or malt type.
 
 Most brewers only make the latter measurements and the results consequently 
 reflect the entire process and the materials used.
 
 The point of all this is that it is unwarranted to criticise a brewer's 
 equipment or his process or his materials for extract/conversion problems 
 based on end results.  There simply is not enough data to make that 
 judgement.
 
 >From: "Bob Jones" <bjones`at`novax.llnl.gov>
 >On the subject of sparge systems, I would point out that if possible you
 should try to minimize the hydrostatic pressure across the grain bed to
 minimize grain bed compaction. This can easily be done if you place your
 outflow slightly below the grain bed liquid level. Crude ascii graphic to
 follow......
 
 I won't argue with the physics of the approach but there is a fundamental end 
 problem.  You can not empty the tun below the outflow level unless you use a 
 hose to gain the necessary head, at which point, you will be back where you 
 would have been with the outflow on the bottom.

1) The CAMRA guide defines a "public bar" as "drink is cheaper" - my
question is what is the price difference between a public and non-public
pub and for the pubs not listed in CAMRA, how would one know if the pub
was a "public bar"?


2) "Free Bars" are mentioned in the description of bars - what is a free

Do any HBD's know of pubs not listed in the CAMRA guide one should not

If you think that a judge did a poor job judging your beer in 
competition, I feel that you should photocopy the judging form
and send it to the competition organizer with a note, explaining
your dissatisfaction.  NOTE that I DON'T mean that you should
complain that you thought you should have scored higher.  What
I do mean is cases like the one Rob mentioned above -- just a
number on a line and a comment like "no clove nose."   Also, if
the judges are abusive, for example, "this beer is awful -- it
tastes like urine."  Judges who write comments like this should
either clean up their act or get out of judging.  Its up to us
to give feedback to organizers so they can reprimand out-of-line
judges and keep them away from competitions if they don't shape
up.


For the record, I once used Wyeast Bavarian Wheat #3056, fermented
at 68F, and got no clove nose.  I have also tasted several Weizens
at CBS meetings made with this same yeast that did have a great clove
nose.  Since this particular yeast is a mixture of two strains, perhaps
freshness may be more important as one yeast will dominate if the
other is sluggish.  The package of #3056 I used was about three months
old.  Temperature is definately a factor with #3056 also.

In HBD #1002, Rob Malouf (malouf`at`Csli.Stanford.EDU) replied to Roger Deschner's
observations on weizen character:


>You shouldn't assume that the brewers made no attempt to use the right yeast.

>I just don't have the skill to achieve it.


Rob's comments on the Wyeast Bavarian Wheat (3056) are consistent with my own
experience and that of many other brewers, namely, it does not instantly impart
the signature clove character, at least not at first.  Generally, I have found
that the cloviness emerges after a couple of months of aging.  Of course, even
a not-clovey-enough-weizen can taste pretty damn good, so this may try your
patience!  Rob, if you've still got a few weizens hanging around, crack 'em
open and compare your tasting notes with the earlier samples.  I'd be interested
to see if you notice this as well.  If you've decided to give up on the 3056,
you might try the Wyeast European (1338 -- aka Alt).  I know many brewers who
swear by this is their weizens.  My guess is you have all the skill you need to
make an excellent weizen.  Sometimes all you need is time or a slight change in
recipe or process.  How did I find out?  I submitted weizens to competitions and
got the same comments.  I'm not getting them as often now.


Also agreed, judges shouldn't assume the worst of homebrewers, but frankly, 
since most of us ARE homebrewers, most of us don't.  We try to give helpful 
advice, but we often fall short.  Few judges, if any, would even attempt to
reverse engineer a beer.  In defense of Roger, there are times when the
advice you give is generally good, but doesn't apply to a specific case.  
I judged a lot of beers in Minneapolis, including some of the weizens, and 
I'd say there were a lot of entries from new brewers.  Naturally, this meant 
that there were plenty of extract beers brewed with dry yeasts.  New brewers 
also have a tough time with styles, and submit brews in the categories that they
think best approximate what they've made.  In general, the weizens were clear, 
refreshing, and under-carbonated.  The winner, a dunkel weizen, was quite good. 
Most of the others would have done better as American Wheats.  Unfortunately, 
the beers with the best clove character in the competition came from the Porter 
category!  Nyaaah!


A final point on Wheat beers in competitions.  In many events, beers submitted
as American Wheats get lumped together with the German Weizens, and the judging
sheets that get sent back to their brewers are full of comments on the lack of
clove character.  It's nice to see that more events have decided to separate
the two, even moving the American Wheat to a subset of American Light Lagers 
(as in AHA Nationals).  When you intentionally brew a beer NOT to have that 
clove character, you shouldn't be criticized for doing so.

Many thanks to all the HBDer's who responded to my questions on all-wheat

In HBD1002, Frank Tutzauer asks,
 
>1.  What the heck is a "cobra" tap?  He talks about two kinds of taps:  "bar"

I'm not sure, but I think the cobra tap has a pressure reducer built into the
handle. I have a simple bar-style (ball/lock) tap which has similar foaming 
problems, and a pressure reducing tap which does slightly resemble a cobra. 
The pressure reducer allows the line to stay at a high pressure, while 
reducing the final pressure at the tap to prevent high velocity exit foaming.
I got my tap from my local Cornelius distributor, I'm not sure what the 
catalog # is, e-mail me if you need it.
 
>2.  What is line "width"?  
>... But by "width" does he mean inside diameter?  
 
He must. No other term is relevant, unless he's making inferences about the
compliance (elasticity) of the hose, which for stiff flex-hose has negligible 
effect when compared to the I.D. for static (non-pulsatile) flow problems.
 
>If so, why didn't he use this term instead of the ambigous "width"? 
 
Maybe he's trying to de-jargonize for the engineering impaired.

Boundary layer slip. When a steady flow is set up along a surface, it is 
assumed that there is zero flow at the fluid/solid interface.

In reality, there is a tendency for some small amount of slip. 
Different materials have different "coefficients of sliding friction", based
on physical (roughness/smoothness) characteristics (most chemical 
characteristics for are lumped in the vicosity of the fluid). 
 
Of course, this is the simplest version. CO2 bubbles will alter the turbulance,
and velocity profiles, as will the head pressure etc, and it is in non-Newtonian
flow that slip seems to play a large role.

The time scale for this problem makes wall permeability a negligible effect. 
Material friction coefficient (roughness and smoothness) is more important.

1/16" vinyl is pretty stiff, and will only be a consideration for the flow
if the pressure is somehow oscillating very rapdily.

Not off hand, but all of these calculations are only of use for well
defined systems of pure liquids. Elbow joints and tube length between 
joints tend to complicate things, not to mention dissolved and undissolved CO2
and sugar/carbohydrate content. There are ways of calculating this stuff,
but the most practical solution is to make a gross calculation based only
on line length, I.D. and head pressure (including heighth differential) and
then take a few measurements at different pressures.

You got it. You only need to look at net differences in height.
 
The only reason you wouldn't, would be if 
a) you have pinhole leaks or leaky joints in the system line, or,
b) you are using a material that has anisotropic slip coefficients

Lincoln has a new brewpub called Crane River Brewpub and Cafe, which

Yes, I beleive that I can help. It is generally thought that malted wheat 
must be mashed with  malted barley in order to get starch conversion, this
is not so. Malted wheat has plenty of enzymes on its own. The problem
is that wheat malt has no husk to form a filter bed thus making lautering
(the removal and collection of the sugars from the mash) almost impossible.
A solution is to mix whole leaf hops through the wheat malt in the mash to
act as the filter in place of the grain husks. It may take a little more 
effort to do but will get what you want. This has been used by commercial 
breweries that make high percentage wheat beers (70% or more).
