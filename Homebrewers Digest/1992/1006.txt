Subject: questions, questions...


in HBD#1005 Peter Maxwell asks: a lot of questions.
I'll try to answer them to the best of my knowledge (everybody is
hereby invited to flame/correct/supplement/ridicule my erroneous ways)


>1.  How important is it to rack off the sedimented hot and cold break?
>    Miller and Papazian both indicate it's optional but recommended.  Is
>    there a real difference in taste?
Depends on the amount of break material and the time you want to store
your beer. If you used an extract or highly converted malt for a beer
that you'll drink in three weeks, the trub will not have a great effect.
In General: You don't want a decomposing proteine bouquet in your beer,
so racking of the break material is the safest way.


>2.  Is the presence of trub likely to interfere with fermentation and cause
>    it to get stuck?
I'd say on the contrary, yeast may find some nutrients in the trub,
but so will bacteria etc..


>3.  I read that the recommended practice is to pitch the yeast then wait 30
>minutes or longer, then rack off the trub before fermentation starts.  Why
>not simply let the wort settle for a while after it's been cooled and
>then rack into the fermenter?  This means one less step.
I use the second method, sometimes even let the wort settle (in a cold
place ) overnight.  The risk is that you take is contamination, the 
reward is a beer with less chance of chill haze.


>4.  When the yeast is initially pitched, does it go into suspension?  My
>fear is that if I pitch and then rack very soon afterwards I'll be
>leaving some of the yeast behind.
Not sure about the suspension for lager yeast, but top fermenting
yeast is supposed to multiply in suspension. Besides, in favourable
conditions your yeast population will double in an hour, so perhaps
you only increase the lag time a little by loosing some yeast.


>5.  Is there anything wrong in racking after fermentation has commenced?
>Is this too late?
This is what you do from primary to secondary (and from secondary 
to lagering for some beers), never had fermentation stop on those
occasions. But see below for effects of air contact.


>6.  Initial aeration is important for yeast growth.  Is aeration while
>racking off the trub to be avoided?  How long after pitching does
>additional aeration become bad?


This has come up a lot of times. I think net.common.wisdom boils
down to :())
1 No problem with oxygen in cold wort while yeast is 
  reproducing rapidly, the yeast will get at first.
2 Avoid oxygen in hot wort (oxydation) and almost-finished 
  beer (oxydation & contamination)

i'm planning on doing my first all grain batch

large pot on the stove to mash and a Zapap
lauter-tun.  How do transfer the mash to the
lauter tun?  Do you just pour it in?  How

Subject: belgian yeast




   I have been hearing a lot of talk about WYEAST belgian,
and annoying banana production.  I was no big fan of belgian
ale until I had Celis beers from austin texas, and some of
the New Belgium brewery products of Ft. Collins, CO.
The commonly available belgain trappists and specials...
namely Deuvel, Chimay Red, and Orval, all leave me cold.
They are just TOO severe.  Celis and New Belgium ales have
a more subdued and mellow spicyness that i would crawl naken on
my hands and knees through shards of broken glass for.


  I recently bought a bottle of Chimay red, and hated it... just
as i remembered.  I cultured the yeast anyway.  WOW... what a success!
I poured about 10 oz sterile wort into the chimay bottle.  In onlky a
little over 24 hours i had noticible airlock movement!  I have plated
out the yeast... but have yet to use it.  I let the bottle culture
finish out... and drank it this morning.  quite nice.  a pleasent
mellow spicyness... much like that of celis of New Belgium.  However,
this was just S.G. 1.020 wort.  A higher gravity may differ.


  This lead me to wonder if the WYEAST product really is a chimay
yeast?  Or is it possible that the yeast used for bottle conditioning
of chimay is NOT their primary yeast...  but a yeast that I may 
PREFER to their primary yeast.  we shall see.  just another data
point.


  BTW:  My chimay culture had NO banana at all.  In fact... it had
very little fruit either.  more of a mellow undefinable spicyness.
somewhere in the annise/fennel/corriander/clove area.

Subject: samuel smith


Michael Jackson's Pocket Guide provides a good, concise description
of the Samuel Smith process.


Samuel Smith's products have a "Yorkshire" character, imparted by
their fermentation system, choice of yeast, and hopping.  Samuel
Smith ferments in double-deck slate vessels which make for a
circulation of the yeast.  I believe Terry Foster's Pale Ale book
briefly describes this system, and some past HBD has a long posting
on the brewery setup.  Jackson maintains that the character
developed by the yeast in this system produces brews with a very
full texture and roundness.  And, the beers have a great deal of
interwoven hop character.  Try Samuel Smith's Pale Ale or Nut Brown
Ale and see whether you can taste these flavor components in the
beers.  The beers are very artfully done, in my humble opinion!


Does anyone know of an available ale yeast that is NOT highly 
flocculant and has an appropriate fruity/yeasty character?  One
could attempt to keep such a yeast roused by swirling the carboy
from time to time.  Wyeast "Irish" ale yeast might be used to
impart a bit of the buttery, diacetyl character these beers have.
Multiple late hop additions in the last 20 minutes of the boil,
plus some dry-hopping, might impart some hop complexity.


Samuel Smith beers go by different names in the U.S. and Great
Britain:


   Britain's Museum Ale (OG 1.048) is Samuel Smith's Pale Ale;
   Strong Brown (OG 1.048) is Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale;
   Nourishing Strong Stout (OG 1.048) is Samuel Smith's Taddy     
   Porter.


In Britain, Museum Ale is available as a cask-conditioned real ale!
Britain has no counterpart to Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout (1.048)
or Imperial Stout (OG 1.072).  As I understand it, the American
importer, Merchant du Vin, convinced Samuel Smith that there was a
market for these beers and encouraged SS to brew them.

Anyone know of a source for Pyrex -- or some other temperature

that can handle steam (about 212F), and something that can handle air
at about 500F.  Diameters need to be about 2-6" or so.


I've asked at plastics/plexiglass places and they indicate it's not
adequate for the 500F degree range.

Last time I was at Price Club, I noticed they had a beer making kit --
and this is on the conservative, behind-the-times, brewpub-poor
Right Coast :-)


Anyway, seemed a good deal for beginners. It had a carboy, rubber cap
with a couple hoses coming out of it (like a BrewCap?), brush(es?), a
high-quality capper, malt extract, and ``brewing sugar''; probably
some other things I've forgotten, too. I think the cost was about $40,
but I can't recall exactly.

Well, I did it right on Monday instead.  I replaced #41 Botched Brown
with #44 Not-So-Botched Brown.  To my surprise, it won first place in
the Brown Ale category at Brewmaster's Oktoberfest a couple of weeks

Last night I was fortunate enough to participate in a dinner so inspiring,

Coffee's Belgian Bistro in Livermore CA, and was prepared by Christian
VanHoutryve, the proprietor. The best description probably begins with

                Tasting of Bourgogne de Flanders


Christian has worked for many years perfecting his food and beer
combinations. Last night he was in top form. The complex interplay 
of the different flavors was a true gastonomical delight, and I wouldn't
hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. Ahhh, "But what of the beers?"
you ask.


The blind tasting was very enlightening. It was my first taste of Celis
Wit, and I was quite impressed, although one would expect nothing less of
the man who single-handedly revived this style. The Interbrew Hoegaarden
was softer and breadier, whereas Celis' beer was crisper and more refreshing.
Both were very aromatic from the coriander and orange peel. We all preferred
the Celis and are anxiously awaiting its appearance in CA, which should
happen in the next week or two.


The next brew was the four year old Hoegaarden, brewed when Celis was still
at the helm of the DeKluis brewery, before the takeover by Interbrew.
Needless to say, a four year old wit is well past its prime, but it held up
surprisingly well. The aromatics were largely diminished, but the beer was
still tasty and refreshing. On a recent visit to SF, Pierre Celis sampled
some of this brew from the same cellar. He too was surprised by its
relatively fresh condition.


We moved on to the Lindemann's gueuze. This is, in my opinion, not truly
representative of the style. I prefer the harder lambiks with more acidity
and Brettanomyces character. In contrast, Lindemann's is overly sweet. It
did however, complement the food well and was enjoyable in its own right.


The LaChouffe was one of the evening's truly outstanding beers, which is
saying alot. It is a specialty brew produced by an upstart brewery that
defies easy catigorization. It's fairly full bodied with a good deal of
residual sweetnesss, balanced by a substantial dosage of herbs and spices.
I read somewhere (Jackson?) that this beer was made with honey and a blend
of six spices. It was a very complex balance of flavors, and hard to single
out any of the spices, although some detected hints of clove and cinnamon.
A shame this one's not available in the US.


I'd had Rodenbach many times before, but never with Grenadine. The
unadulterated beer is quite tart, but the sweetness of the Grenadine
took the edge and added a fruity character. The flavors integrated quite 
well. I'm generally reluctant to add flavorings to beers, but Christain
insisted that this was the proper way to serve Rodenbach _after_ a meal.
I must admit that the resultant mixture was absolutely delcious at the time.


Finally we finished the evening with another specialty brew, Bourgogne de
Flanders. On my recent trip to Belgium, this was one of the few beers that
I drank more than once. Its deep reddish brown color and full spectrum of
flavors make it worthy of the noble title Bourgogne. It has a very present 
fruity flavor although no fruit is used. Even with its big flavor, this
award winning brew remains fairly light in body and is quite refreshing.


Overall it was a delightful evening that we won't soon forget. If you get the
chance to get out to Livermore, Mrs. Coffee's is definitely worth a visit.

I've read that if yeast ferment the trub, it will increase fusel alcohol
(higher, more complex alcohols) production.  In some beers, like Belgian
Strong beers, this is part of the style's flavor.  It has been also
theorized (proven?) that these fusel alcohols are, at least partly,
responsible for hangovers.


>2.  Is the presence of trub likely to interfere with fermentation and cause

No.  I can't see how it could.

There are a lot of nutrients in the trub that the yeast can use during their
respiration phase (the first phase of their life cycle) and so IDEALLY, you
would like them to feed them some of the trub, then take it away before
they go into the fermentation phase.


>4.  When the yeast is initially pitched, does it go into suspension?  My

Yes.  You'll leave a few hundred thousand behind, but what's that compared to 
a few trillion.


>5.  Is there anything wrong in racking after fermentation has commenced?
>    Is this too late?


No, but you could have trouble keeping a siphon going -- the CO2 that's
being produced can form a bubble in the line and break the siphon.  My
personal opinion is that increasing the height difference between the source
and destination vessels as big as possible will increase the velocity in
the hose and reduce your chances of breaking the siphon.


>6.  Initial aeration is important for yeast growth.  Is aeration while

You don't need to avoid aeration until after fermentation has begun and
even then, any excess O2 that gets dissolved will be scrubbed out by
the escaping CO2.  Once fermentation begins to subside, then additional
aeration is bad.

they wish. 


To my other question - nobody knew why the CAMRA guide list "public
bars" as "drink is cheaper" - is guess I'll find out when I get there. I
don't care what it cost - I demand "real ale". (I wrote this before
Don Scheidt's response in HBD 1005 - thanks, since I'll be with the wife
I'll have to check these places out myself while she is shopping because
she will prefer the nicer places).


Another point is that several people corrected me on the use of the
word "bar" and said it should be "pub" - well the reason I put the
statement in quotes was because it is a quote from the CAMRA guide.

Subject: Where to start?


  Two friends and I are ready to dip our feet into the waters of home 
brewing and would like some suggestions on where to buy our startup 
equipment. We saw an ad in a magazine selling a whole startup kit for 
$40, including tank, capper, caps, ingredients, book, etc. (I can't 
remember the outfit's name, but they offer a $5 rebate if you decide to 
return the equipment - that might help figure out who I'm talking about)
  Anyhow, is that a good deal? Should we try someplace locally? (we're in 
Nashville TN) Any suggestinos would be much appreciated.
  I imagine any group-related replies would be welcomed on this list, but 
please send specific responses to my mail address:

Subject: Beer Can Collecting


Howdy,
        I have recently aquired a 700+ can beer can collection, and am
looking for a book on the worth of the cans.  I have quite a few multiples,
and want to know what they are worth before going trading!


Thanks,
