Subject: Yeast Culturing and Storage Question.




I recently received an Advanced Yeast Culturing kit for my birthday.  
I am concerned about running out of the pre-poured wort agar plates.  
The plates are used for propogating and purifying yeast cultures.  
The plates are made out of plastic and are not reusable.  In the 
future I would like to continue using plates.  I have contacted a 
medical supply company for a catalog listing glass plates and culture 
tubes.  Now the big question:  How does one make the sterile brewers 
wort agar?  As you can see, I am trying to avoid purchasing the 
pre-poured slants and plates.  I would rather save the money for 
other brew-related purposes (all grain goodies).  Greg.

Subject: racking after respiration


I posted the following on Monday morning; it seems to have ended up
in Tumbolia:




           "B followed A, therefore A caused B."


This fallacious form of reasoning is very common, and I plead guilty
your honor, with an explanation.  Peter Maxwell and I have had the
following back-and-forth in #1007 & #1008:


>> ....then I got a
>> batch with an INCREDIBLE, UNDRINKABLE amount of diacetyl.  End of
>> experiment.  Back to racking on day 4.
> 
>Was this diacetyl produced BECAUSE you racked off earlier?  What happened?
>How could racking earlier than day 4 result in this?


I never claimed a causal connection, although I had hoped to get some
evidence one way or another from other HBDers. I'd love to find the
time and patience to test scientifically the effect of racking at 24
hours on diacetyl production.


My 1990 experiment came to an end based on laziness, not scientific
method.  Brewing a batch of beer requires so much work that I
hesitate to take a _chance_ on an experimental method that ended
in failure -- even once -- when I've successfully brewed scores
of batches another way.  Unscientific, but in keeping with a hobby
I view as being 45% art, 45% science and 10% magic.


Here's my experience racking within 12-24 hours of pitching.  All
batches are full-mash, using only malt and specialty malts.


Batch   Style     When racked                  Comments
- -----   -----     -----------                  --------
187     Pale Ale  Morning after (12-16 hrs.)   Up to my usual standards.
188     Mild Ale    "      "         "         "  "  "   "       "
189     Pale Ale  24 hours after pitching      Overpowering diacetyl.
190     Stout     planned at 16 hours          Was fermenting too
                                                 actively to siphon.


After being unable to rack #190, I bottled #189 and discovered the
diacetyl.  I have never since attempted racking after respiration.


>When the weather gets colder here I intend to try a
>lager and would like to know if there are any other gotchas regarding
>racking off trub.


Me too, except that mine will be a steam beer.  Advice, fellow HBDers?




++++ In HBD1009, Peter told us how a batch that was racked
     9 1/2 hours after pitching apparently died. +++++++




When I racked off the trub in batches 187-189, I seem to recall
that it also had the apparent effect of halting the fermentation.
Temporarily, in my case, as it always re-started itself.


I think it may be something like this: until high krausen, even our
top-fermenting friends tend to sit on the bottom, along with the
trub.  If you rack too early (9 1/2 hours, in your case), there's
not enough yeast in suspension.  If you wait until high krausen,
it's too late, because the furious bubbling makes siphoning impossible.
Someone like George Fix can probably tell us if this is accurate.
If so, then the whole procedure is like toast: "...just cook it 'til
it burns, and 20 seconds less."


>In future I'm leaving it alone.


A good piece of advice I read in _Northern_Brewer_ (the CABA quarterly)
about six years ago: "don't bugger with the beer".  Once the yeast
has been pitched, leave it be until you're ready to bottle/keg/rack
to secondary.  As a lapsed Catholic, I have a residual belief in the
efficacy of ritual, and always say a "domine" when I pitch my yeast.
Then it's out of my hands, at least until the krausen falls.  I wonder
if there's a suitable pagan deity whom I can invoke instead?  Perhaps
this Sumerian beer goddess mentioned in #1008-9, or some ancient Celtic
fermentation "spirit" :-)


Cheers,

Subject: Candi sugar experiment


I'm planning to conduct a kitchen experiment to determine just what it is
that candi sugar contributes to beer.  However, I'm no scientist and my
supplies of candi sugar are limited, so I'd welcome any comments on the 
following "experimental design":


3 test batches of 1 quart each


Each batch will have 1/4 lb DME (+/- 1.040), plus 100 grams of sugar


Batch 1: Corn sugar (the "control")
Batch 2: White sucre candi
Batch 3: Brown sucre candi


Ferment each batch with 50 ml starter from plated Sierra Nevada/Narragansett
yeast (the idea being to use something healthy but neutral in flavor)


Ferment to terminal gravity and bottle with 1/2 tsp corn sugar per bottle
(hard to rack and bulk prime with such small quantities)




Does this sound like the right way to go about it?

Subject: re:celis wit


According to recent information from Hoegaarden Wit brewers, 
they do not gelantize the raw wheat prior to mashing. What
I was told is that they imploy very long rests (45 min each) 
at protein stage (123-ish F), beta rest (144F-ish) followed  
by saccharification rest (60 min? 152?) and a mash off.   
Normal lautering follows, without a special lauter tun.


I realize this differs with the information from the Celis
post.  One would assume similar techniques in each brewery,
but since they are owned by different interests, anything
is possible.  I did find it quite interesting that the Celis
information claimed a simple one step infusion.  Note that 
the Celis post claimed using 6 row malt, not two row.  As
someone who has brewed a Wit using 45% raw spring soft wheat
and 5% raw steel cut oats, I can attest to the difficulty
of working with the grains.  Now maybe my mistake was using
soft wheat, since the Celis post indicated hard wheat.  I
also gelatinized the grains, but I believe the temp got too
low, resulting in a hardened mass.  My next go at this 
style will follow the multi-step mash bill, keeping the 
consistency loose and skipping the grain boiling step. Since
this is a very low gravity beer, it may not be necessary.


Any comments/experiances with the pros & cons of hard versus
soft wheat????

Oke, there is a theoretical maximum of extraction. We define extraction as
being the amount of stuff which can be extrated out of the grains. So this
includes (un)fermentable sugars and of course all other kind of stuff. Is this
interpretation of extraction oke??? If yes, then ...


>So if someone makes a batch with all 2-row, and gets 30ppg, he has a
>percent efficiency of 83% (30/36). 


Oke, this figure (Eff) will presumable be the same for that method of brewing
a single brewer is using. This figure will be quiet constant to the brewer and
type of malt, in my opinion. (real breweries will have high efficiency,
perhaps 100% and beginners lower).


This TM*Eff gives a figure for the OG, correct??? (be aware I do not have the
custom of using pts/lb/gallon, but I am trying to get the Papazian book [what
is the ISBN-number?]).


To get an idea about the FG one needs to know how much of the extract is
fermentable. This figure (Fer) is also different percentage for every malt.
E.g.  lager malt 65% of the extract is fermentable, for white sugar this is of
course 100%, for crystal (the European term!) it is 60%, brown sugar it is
95% and dark malt it is 60% (I have more info, but just as example;-) .


Using thus TM*Eff*Fer for every ingredient in the recipe, it is possible to
get a figure for the amount of fermentable sugar and thus a figure of the
amount of Alcohol. Furthermore having the a figure of UNfermentable stuff and
the amount of alcohol, one can calculate the FG.


All the best,

Hi Estes --


Unfortunately, there is only *one* brew-pub in St. Louis.  Fortunately, they 
make good beer.  The brewmaster is none other than Dave Miller, author of two 
books on homebrewing, and all-around nice guy.


Anyway, the pub is called "The Tap Room" and it is two blocks south of 
Washington Avenue on 21st Street.  As for landmarks, there really aren't any.  
This is not particularly close to the hotel -- maybe 16 blocks.  Any cab driver 
should be able to get you there from the Adams Mark.  It helps to approach the 
pub from the north, because 21st Street is one-way south.  Expect to spend $10 
on a big hamburger, plate of spicy fries and a pint of brew.  Just north of the 
hotel is an area called "Laclede's Landing".  There are bars, dance clubs, 
restaurants, etc (but no brew pubs) up there.  The Hotel desk should be able to 
direct you. I'm not much of a "night life" person, so I really can't make any 
specific recommendations.  If you like jazz music, one of the lounges in the 
Adams Mark itself has a reputation for bringing in good players.  If you like 
live Rock & Roll, check out Mississippi Nights.  The Riverfront Times newspaper 
is the best place to look for information about Laclede's Landing entertainment. 
It'll probably be available (free) in the hotel lobby.


Hope this helps.

HELP!!!




I'm stuck in a non-brewers land full of watery lager and can't find the 
ingredients for a good Stout!!!


Chocolate malt has now become (temporarily?) impossible to get in 
Sweden and I'm dying to brew a good Stout for some friends.


Does anyone out there have any ideas for suitable alternatives??
Anyone tried Cocoa or real chocolate??


I've got 10 kilos (20 lb) of crystal malt  if anyone has any ideas on a 
conversion process (have plenty of pilsener / normal malt as well)


I hope someone out there can help me out !


P.S. Is there many other folks out there in Sweden with the same 
problem?  So far I've tried ringing around both here in Stockholm and in 
Goteborg.


Thanks in advance for any suggestions

Subject: Wyeast Bavarian Lager fermentation temp


     Last Wednesday I tried to brew an extract/specialty grain
marzen loosley based on Papazian's Winky Dink Marzen.  OG was
around 1.050.  I cooled to around 70 degrees F and pitched Wyeast
Bavarian Lager yeast.  I then placed the fermenterin a refridgerator
at 45 degrees F.  No action for the first 12 hours.  I then raised the
temperature to around 50 deg.  Still no action.  Then I turned of the
fridge which is outside and the temperature stablized at around 55 deg.
After 72 hours there were no signs of fermentation.  At this point
I brought the fermenter inside in hopes that warmer temperatures
would activate the yeast (73 deg.)  Still no action :(


     It is now going on the 6th day and my concern is growing with
each passing minute.  Is the yeast dead or is it dormant?  As far
as I can see I have 4 choices: 1) Keep waiting in hopes that
fermentation starts.  2) Pitch more yeast.  3) Add some kind of yeast
nutrient. 4) Give up.  I would rather not choose option 4 as I was
looking forward to drinking some good beer.


     Has anyone experienced this problem with this yeast (or any
other lager yeast)?  Should I have waited for active fermentation
to start before chilling? or should I have just left it alone in the
fridge?  I know that some lagers are brewed over the course of many
months, but how long does it take for the primary fermentation to take
place?


     Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Before the drinking age became 21 for everything a few years ago,
3.2% alcohol by weight (about 4% by volume) beer was the only
alcohol 18-20 year-olds could buy.  There were no other restrictions
on alcohol strength.  21 and older could then and still can buy
any kind of beer, from Miller Lite to Samichlaus.  We don't
even have to call the stronger stuff "Malt Liquor," as many (most?)
other states do.


3.2 beer is still around, though, because it's the only kind of
alcohol grocery stores and convenience stores are allowed to sell
in Colorado.  This is a bit annoying.  Since 21 is now the age for
everything, I would like to be able to buy all types of beer and wine
in grocery stores.  Two factors prevent this from happening.  First,
the political climate is such that no law making drinking more
convenient is going to get passed, no matter how much sense it makes.
Second, the liquor stores will lobby hard against such a change, as
they are now the only source of wine and good beer.


Other blue laws in Colorado are nothing stronger than 3.2% beer can
be sold to anyone on Sunday (except in bars), and nothing at all
can be sold between midnight and 6 am (bars can sell 'til 2 am)
every day.

Subject: Texas-style wheat beer?!?!


Just because the world's formost authority on Belgian Wit beer has
taken up residence in Texas doesn't suddenly change the name of the
style does it?  Just kidding.  No, really -- Wit beer is a recently
 -revived style (by Pierre Celis at the DeKluis Brewery in Belgium before
the Belgian industrial-brew giant Interbrew bought him out) that has
been around probably longer than Texas has. 


I don't know about the cooking of the wheat in Witbier, perhaps Steve
could follow-up, but the wheat in traditional Lambiks (another very old
Belgian style of beer) is not pre-cooked... the only "cooking" of the
*unmalted* wheat that appears to occur is during the decoctions (this
is from memory -- I believe that Martin Lodahl first noted this -- Martin?)
so the extraction is quite low from the wheat.

Subject: gravity/trub




I recently brewed an extract-based Bass-Ale clone (supposedly) recipe that 
was posted here a couple hundred issues ago.


It went like this:


        6 lbs. English Light Xtract (William's)
        1.1 lbs Demarara sugar
        1 lb crystal
        Northern Brewer & Fuggles (I forget how much offhand)
        3 tsp gypsum, 1/2 tsp irish moss
        Wyeast British


I got an O.G. reading of 48.  After about a week in the primary I racked to a 
secondary last night and got a reading of about 18.


So here's the question:  in the past I've used Wyeast California and 
American.  In both cases after a week or so in the primary I got gravity 
readings much closer to the eventual finishing gravity of around 12, even 
with a heavy Christmas ale I brewed which had an OG of 60 or so (American 
used with that).  Does the British work more slowly?  Does it generally 
result in a higher FG?  Is there anything about the recipe design that would 
suggest a finishing gravity in the neighborhood of 18?


Not "worrying," just curious.


Also, I've been interested in th thread on yeast nutrients in trub.  I 
generally rack off the trub into my bucket primary as soon as the wort is 
cool (about 30 minutes for me) and then stir in the yeast.  I've been using 
Wyeast in standard wort starter solutions and I get excellent starts (usually 
within 6 hours) and, to my relatively untrained palate, pretty good beer.  If 
I were to pitch into the cooled wort in the brewpot, wait 30 minutes and THEN 
rack into the primary, as I think has been suggested, what specific 
improvements could I really expect in my finished product, and would those 
improvements be worth the additional risk of infection from waiting the extra 
time before sealing up the beer under the airlock?


Wizards of Wort, please advise!

 non-alcoholic beer, but dialysing out the alcohol makes perfect sense.
 
 It only makes sense if A-B had a tradition of using the best technology to 
 produce the finest tasting product.  In light of the fact they seem to use 
 what ever technology it takes to produce the cheapest beer no matter how 
 insipid it tastes, I humbly stick to my accusation that they dilute it as 
 major part of the alcohol reduction process.  Osmotic process such as you 
 describe are notoriously expensive and I know of no commercial use on the 
 scale of a major brewer.
 
 >I tend to doubt that A-B dilutes their regular beer by about seven-fold in 
 order to reduce alcohol from 3.5% to 0.5%.
 
 I did not mean to imply that dilution was the only measure taken to get 
 there, just that it was the most easily overlooked.
 
 My experiments with NA make it abundantly clear that dilution is one of their 
 secret weapons.
 
 The NA I made simply by heating to 170F and letting cool to 150F reduced the 
 alcohol in my beer to 1.3% according to mass spec measurements made by Jean 
 Hunter at Cornell.
 
 By diluting this with equal parts water we end up with .65% and a perfectly 
 drinkable beer.  It is not hard to imagine how they get it down to .5% with a 
 little more water.  Nor is is hard to believe this is their "secret process" 
 when one considers the insipid taste of their NA beer.
 
 On the other hand, if we start out with a malty, hoppy homebrew and process 
 it as I have described, we end up with an NA that has far more flavor and 
 character than even their premium stuff.

 Just a good example of one of the evils of the "electronic revolution".  It's 
 a lot harder to be unfriendly when you're eyeball to eyeball.  And it's a lot 
 easier to be objective about beer when you have a glass of it in your hand 
 than trying to reconstruct what it probably tastes like based on keyboard 
 entries.
 
 Nice thoughts, Chris...

     Thanks to all of those who answered my mail on first time brewing
jitters. I drank one at five days, one at seven, and a few at twelve -
WOW what a difference a few days make.


     The first was flat and kinda bitter.
     The second had more corbonation but still a little bitter.
     But the ones at twelve days were well on there way to full
     carbonation and surprisingly very smooth. The difference in
     just a few days was dramatic.


     I will slowly drink these as time goes on as I begin the wait
for another batch, now in the secondary, to age.


     Once again thanks - Gerald Wirtz - Stratus Computer

New Jersey brewpub news - the "issue" has been introduced to the state
senate and the bill number is S-614. The bill is now in the Law and
Public Safty Committee and in the People's Republic of NJ, only a select
few bills get out of this committee. Once this is accomplished the bill
must passed by the Senate and then the Assembly and if the Assembly adds
amendments, then it goes back to the Senate - isn't politics fun! To top
this fun off, every time the political process adjourns (I think every 2
years) the bill must be reintroduces again. I believe the homebrew bill
had to be reintroduced 2 times for example.


If anyone knows who we can abuse --- I mean encourage to help this bill
along and if anyone knows what the bill actually says (any political
science majors at Trenton State listening) that would be most helpful.


In other news a brewpub has just opened in the area:


                Mountain Valley Brewery
                Route 202 (ie Orange Ave/Franklin Turnpike)

                914-357-0101

                       11:30 - 4 F & Sat
                       12 - 12 Sun


Suffern is located just across the broder from Mahwah, NJ near route 87
and 17. They just opened 2 weeks ago and have a porter, pale ale, copper,
copper light (less malt) and an octoberfest will be up by the end of the

Subject: Brettanomyces in Porter


Hi Gang,


I have come across numerous references to Brettanomyces being one of
the yeasts present in the beers of Old England, notably Porters and Old
Ales. I assume that they are still used in beer such as Thomas Hardys.
If one wanted to make an 'authentic' porter then I imagine that the
process would be similar to making a p-lambic. The question is ... does
anyone have any idea which strain of Brettanomyces to use?
