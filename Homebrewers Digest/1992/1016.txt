Subject: Yeast pitching question & thanks


    First, I would like to thank all the people that gave me suggestions on
    getting started.  I appreciate your help thus far.  (Someone at a
    homebrew store said that beer people are extremely helpful, but that
    wine people are really stingy with helpful information..., any similar
    experiences?)


    Now, my question / story for the day:


    I am an extreme novice.  I am following the directions that I have been
    given, and what is written in Papazian's book.  However, my
    fermentation times are only about 1/2 of what they say I should be
    getting.  On the batch that I am fermenting now, I started it late
    Sunday, and it has almost completely subsided bubbling by this morning.
    Also, contrary to opinion, my massive activity does not start in 24/48
    hours, but in a matter of 2 or 3 hours.






    What am I doing wrong?  The instructions that I have been following say
    to hydrate the yeast, and then pitch into the carboy.  I have also seen
    that I should wait until the solution in the carboy has cooled.
    Which is correct?  (I would suspect since the way I did it (hydrate &
    pitch) is not working, the other way must be better).  If I should
    wait, what temperature should I wait for?


    Could someone please describe the event steps (and length of
    time) between the time you turn off your burner and put the blowoff
    tube onto the carboy?


    Finally, I local distributor gave me a taste of his India Pale Ale, and
    I _really_ would like to make this.  Any suggestions on a recipe (other
    than Papazian's)


    Thanks again.

Greetings. A friend with a taste for beer (but, alas, no network
connection) asks that I poll you for recommendations on where to find
interesting brew/brewpubs in Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. Thanks in
advance.


I was delighted with your unanimous recommmendation of the Cleveland
brewpub, Great Lakes Brewing Company. Of the close to half-dozen brews on
tap, their IPA-style topped my list -- rich, *very* hoppy, full of body. It
wasn't available in the bottle, but they filled a gallon jug from the tap;
our brewclub back in Bloomington, IN, enjoyed it almost a week later. It
held up superbly. GLBC's a very hospitable place. Don't miss it if you
visit the Cloven Land!  --Jan  (holloway`at`ucs.indiana.edu)

Since I once worked at a corn wet-milling plant in Germany, I believe
I can shed some light on this process. In the old days corn processors
found they could take the starch they separated from the rest of the
corn kernel, and break it down into sugar solutions (by an
acid hydrolysis?). With typical marketing hyperbole, they called this
"glucose" syrup, even though a lot of it was not glucose (ie a six
carbon sugar monomer) but rather maltose (a dimer) and other stuff.
I'm not sure if they ever solidified this stuff.


Then as technology progressed they became able to use enzymes to break
down the starch virtually 100% of the way to a simple (monomer) sugar.
This became "dextrose" even though chemically dextrose and glucose
are the same. Thus dextrose syrup and crystalline dextrose.


By the way, my dictionary defines "corn sugar" as dextrose and "corn
syrup" as the mixture of dextrose, maltose and other sugars mentioned
above.

Forget about it, it's not suitable for the coarse grinding (cracking
really) needed for beer making.  I've considered heavily modifying one
but it does not look to be worth the expense or effort if it can even be
done.  For what it costs you are better off getting the Marcato or
something (unless you got one as a gift already and don't mind hacking
it up).

From: "Spencer W. Thomas" <Spencer.W.Thomas`at`med.umich.edu>
Subject: Re: beer vs ale


There are differences of opinion here.  The "modern" view seems to be
that all fermented (hopped?) malt beverages are "beer", while "ales"
are fermented with top-fermenting "ale" yeasts.  However, I have seen
some writers use the term "beer" to mean exclusively "lager beer"
(thus "it is a beer and not an ale").


Lt. Col. Robert Gayre, who wrote the book "Wassail! In Mazers of
Mead," makes the distinction thusly: beer is a strong (in alcohol),
hopped fermented beverage, while ale is weaker and *not hopped*.  In
his opinion, both terms originally applied to a honey-based beverage,
but came to refer to malt-based beverages as mead-brewing declined
from the Middle Ages (and before) to the present.  His view would seem
to be in a distinct minority, at least in this country.  Any British
readers care to comment?

From: shaver`at`zeppelin.convex.com (Dave Shaver)
Subject: Inconsistent carbonation in bottles.


A little over a month ago I bottled a dark ale.  I used a scant 3/4 c.
of corn sugar to prime after dissolving the sugar in 2 c. boiling
water.  I'm pretty sure that I mixed in the priming sugar well enough.
I capped with a Brev wing capper after boiling the caps for about 10
minutes.  Since bottling the bottles have been stored at about 65-70 deg F.


The problem is that about half of the bottles have good carbonation and
great head retention while the other half are more-or-less flat.  (The
"flat" half do have a little carbonation, but they form only a very
weak head when decanted.  The head quickly disappears and the beer
tastes flat when drinking it.)


I'm wondering if:
        - I need to relax and hope the batch carbonates more evenly.
        - I capped some of the bottles wrong.
        - I didn't mix in the priming sugar well enough.
        - I did something else wrong.


Any suggestions?

EDITORIAL


Geez, I'm getting tired of hearing everyone hail "candi sugar" as some
Belgian miracle.  If it is indeed just rock candy, then it is simply
sucrose--TABLE SUGAR.  Everyone's got that in the house!  Just use sugar--
it's cheap.  It doesn't matter if it is in rock form, granulated form or
even powdered.  Sucrose is sucrose.  Just because someone once used a
foreign spelling, and everyone else propagated it, doesn't mean it's
anything special.


Look, if I were a candy maker (in any country) would I use some strange
and harder to get (read:  expensive) type of sugar?  No, I would use
sucrose.  It's cheaper and more readily available.  What other kinds of
sugar are there?  Fructose, lactose, maltose, glucose--when's the last
time you saw candy made from them?  When's the last time you saw them in
a grocery store?


There is a very bad tendency in this forum to take what one contributor
says, and increase it's credibility as people respond.  By the time you
see several articles on the subject, the word of the first contributor
is considered FACT--written in stone.  Hail, hail, I must go to Belgium
and get some of that miracle stuff, or else my pseudo-lambic's will be
terrible.  Look, there are a lot of WAY more important factors in creating
something as complex as a Lambic.


People, use a little judgement.

I've just bottled the second of two batches using that yeast and about your SG
and temp.  The first batch surprised me in that it wasn't quite finished after
three weeks, and I had to wait another before I had time to bottle.  I dry
hopped (1 oz Mt. Hood) that batch after one week in the fermenter (single 
ferment), and the CO2 from the continuing fermentation must have scrubbed most
of the aromatics because it has very little hop fragrance.  I tasted that
batch against Anchor and I was fairly pleased - I went overboard with the 
bittering hops, and the Anchor has a more complex flavor, but they were clearly
the same style of beer.


The second batch fermented for two weeks in the primary at slightly warmer 
temps (upstairs instead of cellar) then I racked to a secondary.  It finished 
in another week, and I then dry hopped and let it sit a fourth week.  At
bottling (last night) it had much more hop aroma than the first and it tasted 
GOOD.


I think this yeast can take higher temps, and it might even be more true to 
style if it is fermented warmer.

Subject: copper wort coolers and oxidation




While reading the latest special issue of Zymurgy I noticed an add 
for a stainless steel wort chiller.  As the price was rather high
I called the seller to ask why he thought a wort chiller should be
made of ss.  His explanation was this: After the boil, wort is oxidized
by contact with copper.  On the other hand I know that Pilsner Urquell, a
beer of unquestioned quality, stores the beer after cooling (I don't know
what material their coolers are made out of) in shallow copper containers 
so that the cold break may settle.  So the question is whether or not
the copper wort chillers that many of us are using are in fact compromising
the quality of our brews.

English traditional cider is often called 'scrumpy' (in the sense of 'rough').
This is because it is fermented with a mixture of wild yeasts and bacteria,
the apples are particularly high in tannin, the fruit pulp is occasionally
fermented (which increases tannin), and it is served cloudy, warm and flat.
Apple juice naturally makes a drink of around 7% alcohol by volume, yet some of
the French cidre I have tried has been much weaker. This suggests to me that
the drink has been diluted (and maybe fermented with a refined wine yeast,
using eating apples), which would tend to reduce the rough character.

Subject: Aging revisited


Oops!  I forgot one important point on aging beer: acetaldehyde.


Very young beer usually has acetaldehyde levels that are well above
it's 10 ppm flavor threshold.  Acetaldehyde has a "green apple" flavor
and aroma and is in the normal anarobic fermentation cycle:


glucose -> pyruvic acid -> acetaldehyde -> ethanol


Quoting from another of George Fix's articles in the Zymurgy Special
Issue on Troubleshooting:


"Thus in a normal fermentation, the acetaldehyde level will rise, typically
well above its flavor threshold of 10ppm, and then decrease as it is
converted to ethanol."


Then later goes on to say:


"For example, Budweiser is kraeusened after the primary fermentation
and is given only a brief cold storage [then, of course it's filtered and

Subject: Smadams Cranberry Lambic, Xmas brew pix


To whomever warned us about Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic:


Did you check if it was an old batch? There's a sale going on at a
local liquor store, a case of Smadams assorted brews for $14.99. It
was too good to be true. Everything they had was at least four months
past the expiration date. (Leave it to the FDA to let sleazy packies
sell spoiled beer while they crack down on "health" food stores and
neglect to inform the public about the consequences of irradiated
foods. FDA: Either keep your laws off my life, or at least pretend you
care about the people you're supposed to be protecting!)


'Scuse me.


My roommate and I ended up buying a six of Cranberry Lambic for $4. By
the way, it was packaged just like the assortment packs they sold last
Xmas. One Cranberry per six. Hint, hint. The stuff was more sour than
bitter or malty, and tasted nothing like cranberries. It was bad, old
beer. I don't think Smadams has even released this year's Xmas brew
yet. At least not in Chicago.


On a related note, does anyone have any favorite Xmas brews? I have
tried Sam Smith, Aass and Sierra Nevada so far. Sam Smith's was by far
the best of these three. Can anyone suggest how to get that kind of
Xmassy hop character in a homebrew without spices, following
Reinheitsgebot?


Ho ho ho,

Subject: Use of chocolate malt


I picked up a pound of chocolate malt at my local homebrew store after hearing
much about it giving beer a nutty flavor (which I like).  I'd like to add it
to my next batch of amber (extract), but have heard of using it crushed and
uncrushed.  What kind of difference in flavor does crushing it make?


Thanks in advance...Karl

Subject: Hopbacks and Wort Aeration
 
    I have a paradoxical question for the digest.  I have a very experienced
brewing friend (12+ years) who is a self-proclaimed hophead.  He uses
a hopback during his brewing procedures.  His setup is such that after the
boil is over he has a pump which moves his hot wort into a strainer
containing an ounce or two of fresh leaf hops.  As the hot wort filters
through the hops (picking up valuable aroma) it falls about a foot into
his hopback (a 5-gallon soda keg with the top cut off).  The bottom of
the hopback has a valve which is attached to a counter-flow wort
chiller.  He has won numerous AHA awards over the years for outstanding
pale ales and many other fine beers.


So the now the question:  Everything I've ever read says aerating *hot*
wort is very bad, but aerating cool wort before yeast pitching is good.
So how come his hopback doesn't introduce massive oxidation since the wort
is still hot as it falls into the hopback and then cooled very quickly
as it falls into the fermenter (aerating again)?

Subject: Beer aging


        Jack brought up the subject of aging beer in today's HBD.  The
problem?  Why does commercial beer get worse with age, while Homebrew
gets better (up to a point)?  The answer, of course, is that homebrew
is not filtered, and continues to mature in the bottle or keg.  Commercial
beer IS filtered, so that a) no more yeast settles out of suspension, 
b) no more corbonation is produced, and c) no more yeast by products are
released into the beer, all of which happens in homebrew while it ages
in the bottle.  If you filter and bottle your beer under pressure, then it
is best consumed fresh.  My homebrew is bottle conditioned, and is best aged
for at least 2 weeks if not a month or more to get nice and clear and
carbonated.

I always associated the metallic notes with adding too much water at
the end of the boil to bring up the total volume, instead of doing a
full boil.  It only seems to happen with dark malts.


>When the chocolate malt is added only 
>in the mash out, the metallic notes are not present.


I never tried adding chocolate malt only to the mash out.
Mashing definitely reduces the astringent flavor as opposed
to not mashing dark grains, but this may have to do with the
fact that a grain bed is filters the particles out more
effectively than a fine strainer.


> Nor does my water contain
>significant traces of iron. It is however possible that the extraction
>of metallic flavours from the darker malts is related to my high calcium
>hardness water.


Dark malts reduce the ph of the mash, and hard water can be quite acidic.
The dark malts also tend to discolor ph paper and make it read higher
than it actually is.  mashes with a ph below 5.0 can easily occurr (if
your mash water has no chlorine).


My batches that were metallic all had gypsum (or at least
burton water salts) added to them, just because it was part of
the recipe.  This further lowers the ph.  I no longer treat my
mash water, except to boil it to remove chlorine, but I've only
made 1 dark beer lately (a dry stout that turned out fine),
and that only had roasted barley in it, as far as dark malts go.

>darker specialty malts is a cure. I've had no problem with roasted barley
>in the mash itself, but have on occasion put it in the mash out in order
>to get a more subtle effect from the roast.


I've also noticed the problem mainly when using chocolate malt,
more so than with black patent or roasted barley.


On a final note, slight overcarbonation seems to exaggerate
the "metallic" effect.

Excellent point.  The system is not closed and with sufficient time would
EVENTUALLY reach equilibrium.  How long is eventually?  I have no idea.
At 60degF, what would be the rate of diffusion of CO2 through 10' of water,
from a 5/16" dia. 5psi CO2-water interface to a 3" dia. water-atmosphere
interface?  Since most of the time, the bottom carboy would have some water
in it, and since the copper pipe would be filled with water, what is the
rate of CO2 diffusion through 10' of water at 60degF over a 5/16" dia. from
water saturated with 5psi CO2 to water saturated at atmospheric pressure?
The rate of diffusion in answer to the latter question is (I suspect)
sufficiently low, but a real quantitative answer would be more satisfactory
than just my gut reaction.
