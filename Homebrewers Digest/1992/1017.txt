Subject: Candy sugar continued


Hmm.  Have I just been flamed?


In Thursday's HBD Alan Edwards launched a diatribe concerning the alleged
snobism of people who'd like to use candy sugar in Belgian style beers.  He
wondered if there really was any difference between this and standard sugars
such as glucose.


While it is not the point I want to make here, he may be right.  Having hauled
plenty of this stuff back from Belgium (using valuable space I usually reserve
for chocolate!), I have to say that the value of candy sugar in comparison
with other types is not immediately apparent.  While it does offer some color
and melts slowly, it tastes pretty much like. . . sugar.  It seems to me that
what's important is what it contributes to the final fermented product, but
I've yet to see or taste any good side-by-side comparisons (my own
experimental plans notwithstanding).  Herein lies the point.


Many contributors to HBD (and myself certainly among them) have a
tendency to pontificate on matters they don't fully understand.  This isn't as
reprehensible as it might seem, because any scientist will tell you that
understanding (and the proofs it must be built on) can be quite difficult to
come by.  Most of us (again, myself included) are too lazy, unskilled, or
downright impatient to actually test our claims and assumptions.  So we swap
folklore and half-understood wisdom instead.


I totally agree with Al concerning his skepticism, and suspect that his ideas
concerning glucose and candy sugar may be correct.  But I suspect that he,
like many of us, is expressing an opinion and does not have any more solid
ground to stand on than the rest of us.  How many of us have the patience and
discipline to prove what we're saying, anyway?    


I do recall reading good, solid reports on HBD.  A number of homebrewing
clubs have undertaken interesting experiments from time to time, and I've
appreciated their reports.  (My club, sadly, is less disciplined.)  As another
example, I think most of us appreciate George Fix's comments because he
seems to be one of the few who really know what they're talking about.  


How can we tighten this up?  Can we?  Should we?  


As for candy sugar, some Belgian brewers certainly use it, and it's not the
cheapest stuff you can get.  Does this mean they know something we don't? 
The truth is: I don't know (yet).

A friend and I are thinking of starting a brew club in our area,
since there are none to be found and join today. Is there a FAQ or a
file on a listserver or archive (I can't FTP) that outlines what one
would do to start and run a brew club. I'm interested in things like
the clubs mandate and mission, what kinds of activities the club
organizes and sponsors, if and what kinds of events clubs organize
etc....

Certainly. Your interpretation of Lt. Col. Robert Gayre was quite right
(although I'm not sure about the mead bit, nor the weak/strong link).
At the time that hops started to be used the unhopped fermented malt
beverage (usually with other herb instead of hops) was called ale. The
hopped drink was referred to as beer. Once hops became universal the two
words became (almost) synonymous. Now we have ales being different from
lagers but both being beers.

Well, I got one as a gift and its been working great for crushing
grain.  There is a dial on the front of the mill which allows you
to adjust the distance between the plates.  I've found that loosening
the dial about 30 clicks (depending on the size of the grain) works
fine.  No hacking is necessary.

I didn't write the warning, but I think the point of the original poster
was that the BBC was being picky about naming of beers and then was
incorrectly naming their beer a "Lambic."  My point is, that even if
the Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic [sic] tasted great, and even if it tasted
like a lambik, it would still be only a pseudo-lambik.  It's just the
same as the appelations "Cognac," "Bordeaux" or "Champagne" (the latter
which has lost it's exclusivity).  It's like a trademark.  Lambik is more
of a process than a style since even within the handful of Belgian breweries
that still follow the time-honored traditional method, there is much
variation in flavors.  In short: "You can't brew Lambik without Belgian
air!"


Sorry -- we all have our causes -- I know one of yours and now you know

Nope.  Just talked to the Hunter Sales Rep monday.  They only make one

It sure does, but a lot of the hot-side aeration smell undoubtedly gets
covered-up by the wonderful hop nose your friend gets.  I'll bet that
if he cooled before aeration and then dryhopped in the fermenter, his
beers would be even better and would taste good much longer (if they
don't get consumed first).

I recently found what looks to be an ideal wort aeration "Stone".


It is made of stainless steel and looks just like an aquarium air
stone, only a little coarser.  I have not used it in a batch yet,
because I haven't found any air filters, but I tried it in a pan
of water and it worked very well.

Dry yeasts tend to start much faster than liquid yeasts.  Liquid yeasts
are dormant until you give them food (i.e., pop the wort buldge in the
case of Wyeast).  Dry yeasts are fed lots of oxygen before dehydration
and are ready to go when they hit your wort.  Liquid yeasts need to
respire and build-up their numbers before switching to fermentation.


Also, fermentation time is highly dependent on temperature and the
yeast strain.  The yeast strain I cultured from Orval dregs is VERY
slow (3 weeks), whereas some dry yeasts I used in the past would
ferment-out in 3 days.

Dry yeasts can handle slightly higher pitching temperatures.  I've read
that they should be rehydrated in 100F water, which would imply that you
could pitch them in 100F wort, but you don't want to aerate your wort
when it is that hot.  Liquid yeasts are much more picky when it comes
to temperatures -- you don't want the wort temp to be far away from the
starter temperature.  I use liquid yeasts and an immersion wort chiller
to bring the wort to 70F.  I then aerate the wort and pitch the yeast.


When using dry yeasts, I recommend that you rehydrate in 100F water before
starting brewing.  By the time you've completed the boil and cooled the
wort to 80F, the yeast will probably hav cooled down to about 80F also.
Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast.

I use a wort chiller, and with Chicago tapwater my chilling time is
about 20 minutes for a 5 gallon (full batch) boil.  Add to that carrying
and handling time and we're talking about 30 minutes from end of boil to 
ready-to-pitch.  However, I've been waiting 1 hour after cooling to
allow the cold break to settle, but I think I'll drop this procedure
(it seems to take much longer than 1 hour and I don't think my 1 hour
wait makes much of a difference).  Therefore, my next batch (Sat) will
be about 30 minutes from end-of-boil to blowoff-tube-on.

This one works for me, but is a bit underhopped, I think:


IRS IPA `92


6.6 lbs Northwestern Gold Extract
1 lb Laaglander Light Dried Malt Extract
1.1 lb Roger's (Canadian) Demerara-Style Brown Sugar
2 oz Bullion Pellets (%AA unknown) -- (90 min boil)
1/2 oz East Kent Goldings Whole (4%AA) (15 min boil)
1 oz East Kent Goldings Whole (4%AA) (dryhop - last 7 days before bottling)
1/3 oz Wines Inc. Burton Water Salts
1/2 lb 6 row Crystal Malt (40L)
5 gallons distilled water
1 gallon Chicago (soft) tapwater
yeast recultured from 3 bottles of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale


OG: 1071, FG: 1020


Procedure:
Nothing special -- crush the crystal (actually, I used a rolling pin and
a ziplock bag) and put the crystal into a mesh grain bag.  Suspend the
bag in the pot from the spoon as the water and Burton Water Salts go
from cool to 165F.  Remove and let drain.  Bring to boil, add malt extracts
and hops in hop bags at the proper times.  Chill as quickly as possible.
Aerate and pitch.  Use blowoff method.

Sounds okay except for the boiling of the caps.  I suggest that a minute
in boiling water is more than enough.  I use simple 200ppm Chlorine
Bleach solution.  Boiling will ruin SmartCaps(tm) and will soften the
seals on regular caps.  I've never had inconsistent carbonation and
have been pretty relaxed about mixing in the priming sugar.


>        - I capped some of the bottles wrong.


Could be another problem.  Does your capper adjust to different
bottles well?  Mine is a bench capper and adjusts very easily.
I had problems with my Jet capper in that it only accepted one
type of bottle neck (it relied on the ring of glass at the top
to be a particular width).

I have both versions, and they are essentially the same. I wouldn't

I wrote a short review of this book for the WORLD'S GREATEST BREWSPAPER,
which I'll include here.


CR


==========================================================================




Given the growing fascination for Belgian beers in this country, the
introduction of Michael Jackson's The Great Beers of Belgium couldn't come at
a more appropriate time. This is a definitive work, and a must have for 
any fan of Belgian beers.


Jackson has long had a passion for this tiny country's beers, and his passion
shows in this well researched text. He begins by discussing the unique beer
culture that exists in Belgium, and the relationship between food and drink
there. There is a description of the ingredients typically used in Belgian
beers, and then the bulk of the book focuses the widely varying beer styles
that are uniquely Belgian.


Jackson proceeds to unravel the mysteries surrounding the major styles as only 
he can. Lambics, White Beers, Brown Beers, Red Beers, Saisons, Belgian Ales, 
Abbey Beers, Golden Strong Beers, and Regional Specialties are all included in 
this unprecedented work. There are stylistic descritions as well as highlights 
of individual breweries, including all five operating monastery breweries. If 
you don't know your Faros from your Flanders Browns, this book will definitely 
set you straight.


Finally, Jackson rounds out the book with a discussion of Belgian Cafes. He
describes some of the more famous cafes of Brussels, and then lists a few
specialty beer cafes around the country. There is even a brief listing of
establishments specializing in Belgian beers in other parts of the world,
including San Francisco.


This masterfully written, 271 page work is filled with over 250 full color
photographs. It is sure to occupy a place of pride in the library of any
serious beer afficionado.

Subject: RE: inconsistant carbonation


Dave Shaver writes that he is having trouble with his bottles not
conditioning.  I had similar problems until I:


1) Added a small amount of fresh yeast at bottling.


2) Stirred the priming in with a *sanitized* spoon.


3) Kept the bottles above 65F for the first five days.


4) Shook the bottles twice during the first week to resuspend the yeast.


3 and 4 were based on advice from the Cellar in Seattle.  They also
advised storing the bottles on their sides to expose more surface area for
the yeast.  2 was recommended by my friend Perry (Rev. 10X) Mills.  He had
noticed that SG readings varied between the top and bottom of his
secondary.  1 was based on reading here in the digest that yeasts get
"tired" when fermenting high gravity beers (mine range from 1.060 to 1.075).


All of these trick yeilded small improvements, and I am now very pleased
with the results.  Previously, developing good condition took as long as
six weeks.  Now my beers are tasteable (for the impatient) in one week,
well conditioned in two.  I have noticed that the high gravity dark ales
improve with time.  js may have been a trifle unkind to describe this as
"hiding defects."  Back in George Washington's day, porter wasn't really
considered drinkable if it was less than a year old.


I don't know the reason for the conditioning hassles.  The above tricks
solved the problem and they may help you.

I think in this case the author was refering to kegging the light
american beers.  In my experience only the darker, heavier beers improve
with age.  I've had terrific american style ales really go down hill
after only a few weeks.  On the other hand, I've had some stouts aged up
to a year and they've only gotten better.  


I don't know the Frankenmuth Brewery, but as Americans drink very little
dark beer on tap, I'd say the author just assumed that one only kegs
lighter beers.

          The reason no one responded is that your brother likely will be
          the first person in living memory actually moving to Charleston
          rather than away from it.
          
          As an ex-patriot Charleston home boy, I have the sad duty to
          inform you that this town gives the term "beer wasteland" a whole
          new meaning.
          
          I spent some time there recently because of a death in the
          family, and I found the situation worse than ever. Thank goodness
          I remembered to take along lots of homebrew.
          
          There are no brewpubs, mini, micro, or mega breweries within 200
          miles of Charleston (the nearest would be Cincinnati or
          Pittsburgh). The best beer store in town is the Cold Spot on
          Washington St West. It has a reasonable selection of imports.
          Next best is Campbell's Kwik Shop in Kanawha City. Last I
          remember, it actually carried Guinness and Bass Ale. One measure
          of the situation - There are exactly as many beer retailers
          listed in the phone book as there are bible retailers.
          
          Don't even bother with the bars or taverns - nothing served but
          Budmillob and, occasionally, Bass Ale.
          
          If you can get past all of that, Charleston does have a fairly
          good cultural and music scene. Check out Mountain Stage, recorded
          each Sunday at the WV Cultural Center at the Capitol. Also, spend
          some time at Trans Allegheny Books on Capitol St, one of my
          all-time favorite used book stores.

I have gotten a request from a friend of mine to find out if anyone
out there has tried to reproduce a beer called Goudenband (Belgian, O
I believe).  If so, or if anyone has any suggestions as to recipe
ideas, what yeast to use, etc, please let me know.


I have never tasted the beer so I really don't even know what style it
is.  He says you can't get it here in San Diego.  Thanks.

Agricultural product manufacturers offer a variety of "corn syrup" products
to commercial brewers.  They can control the types and quantities of sugars
to a remarkable degree, even approximating the sugar distribution in a
"typical" wort.  This development has been met with enthusiasm by many
commercial brewers.  One needs only to count the railroad tank cars bearing
the name of a midwest corn processor in front of the Rainier brewery here
in Seattle.

I had uneven carbonation problems for quite a while and finally traced it
to inadequate mixing of the beer and the priming sugar.  I was so afraid of
getting oxygen into the beer that it wasn't getting mixed.  I finally
started using a carboy for a priming vessel so I could throw a cork on top
and gently rouse the beer without splashing it.  The trick is to >quietly<
siphon the beer into the carboy with the priming solution already in it,
shake lightly to cause the beer to foam a bit, thus filling the airspace in
the carboy with CO2.  Warm priming solution in the bottom the the carboy
helps this process


A neat trick for underprimed beer is to pour 2 to 4 oz of "commercial" beer
(i.e. bland and overcarbonated) in the glass first.  There seems to be
enough carbonation to go around and the flavor change isn't too drastic.
Better than throwing flat homebrew away, anyhow

The key here is that the wort is cooled >immediately< after the oxygen is
introduced from aeration.  If the wort was splashed around and then let sit
around hot for a while , then trouble would occur.  My understanding is
that many commercial brewers introduce oxygen into the wort at the >HOT<
end of their wort chillers without problems!  Something about mixing in
better.  I imagine just as many introduce oxygen at the cold end too.










Hope this helps...

Subject: Closure on smoked beer


Hey, now.  Last summer, I asked for hints about making smoked beers.  The
published literature is pretty scanty, but the help from the HBD was great. 
Thanks to everyone.


Here is what I did and how it turned out.  (I'm going to try to put the recipe
in the format used in the Cat's Meow.  If we all did that, maybe it'll save
Karl and Mark a little effort down the road.)


                             Mongrel Ale (Smoked)


Source:   Frank Tutzauer (comfrank`at`ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu)
          Issue #????, 11/??/92


Ingredients:


          1 lb smoked crystal (60 L)
          1/2 lb smoked pale English 2-row
          1 lb Munich malt
          3 lbs amber M&F dried malt extract
          2 lbs light M&F dried malt extract
          1/2 oz. Galena pellets (alpha = 12.0; 60 min.)
          1/2 oz. Hallertauer pellets (alpha = 4.5; 15 min.)
          1/2 teaspoon, Irish Moss (15 min.)
          1/2 oz. Hallertauer pellets (alpha = 4.5; 1 min.)
          Wyeast 1007:  German Ale
          Heavy handed 3/4 cup corn sugar (priming)


Procedure:


Using a water smoker, I smoked the crystal and pale malt at about 170F over
hickory wood for 3-4 hours using heavy smoke.  When finished, the malt smelled
smokey, but didn't taste smokey, so I took half the crystal and gave it
another 3-4 hours.  This smelled REALLY smokey, but still didn't taste smokey.


On brew day, I cracked all grains and steeped them in 3 qts. of water for 45
minutes at 150-155F.  I sparged with 1 (US) gallon of 170F water,
recirculating twice (I wanted that smoke, and was willing to get a few more
tannins).  I added the runoff and extracts to the kettle, and topped up to 5
and 1/2 to 6 gallons of water.  I boiled 65 minutes adding the hops and Irish
Moss as shown.  I calculated the IBUs to be about 30, but the finished product
doesn't taste 30 IBUs worth of bitter (maybe my calculations were off; also my
crude measuring instruments mean that those quantities on the hops are, er,
approximate).  Cooled with an immersion chiller and pitched the yeast from a
starter.  


Comments:  


This beer was a big hit at my homebrew club.  It is a beautiful amber, but has
low head retention.  The first taste sensation is a light sweetness at the
front of the mouth; then a light bitterness, with a mild smokey finish at the
back sides of the tongue.  I personally think that it could use a little more
smoke, but my wife thinks it's perfect.  Also, I believe that the popularity
of it at my homebrew club is partly due to the fact that the smoke is not
overwhelming--most people just aren't used to heavily smoked foods.  (But I
am, which is why I think it can use more.)  The consensus at the homebrew club
was that if one did want to increase the smokiness, you should smoke more
grains, rather than apply more smoke to the original 1 and 1/2 pound quantity.


About the name--I know that smoked beer is a German tradition, so I threw in
some Munich and used German yeast.  But, geez, I had all this English malt and
extract laying around, hence "mongrel."  Also, I decided to make an ale
instead of a lager since it was the end of the summer and I hadn't yet gotten
a refridgerator.  Finally, I made a low gravity beer because I wanted to see
how the smoke played out, and therefore didn't want a lot of other flavors,
etc., to get in the way.
