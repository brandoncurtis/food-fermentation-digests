Subject: Yeast Hydration, oak chip steaming & Hawaii(?)


During this past weekend, whilst making a batch of IPA, I
accidentally overfilled my carboy.  By overfilling, I mean
that I did not have enough room to pitch the rehydrated
yeast.


Fortunately, I had not actually rehydrated the yeast at this
time, so I simply (using proper sanitation) siphoned off a
small amount of wort, and used that to rehydrate my yeast.


So far (day 3), everything seems to be normal.  My only
conclusion is that this was not a bad thing.


Question is: If this works (as it seems to), why would I
_not_ want to do it?  (After all, I have not seen this
prescribed in writings or postings).  Does anyone else
perform this rehydration technique?  What are your results?


Also, during the creation of my IPA, I found the need to
steam my wood chips.  Since I was doing about 4 things at
once, I really did not need another pot to watch on the
stove, so I frantically searched for a simpler way to steam
my wood chips.


The answer which popped into my mind was quite simple,
effective, and painless.  I popped them into my rice cooker
added some water, and turned the sucker on.  It will steam
the rice, er..., chips for about 30 minutes, and then it
will turn itself off, keeping the heat applied until you
are ready to use the wood chips.  (I am seriously
contemplatating putting some oak chips on top of my rice
next time; wonder what type of flavor that will lend to the
rice...)


Turned out quite aromatic (and hopefully well sanitized). 
Anybody else have experiences of this sort?


Finally, any brewers from Hawaii subscribed to this list?

Subject: Plastic Boilers


I would like to solicit opinions from those who boil their entire 
collection of wort.  We all know the price of eight-gallon pots can be
daunting, especially if they are of stainless steel.  And for those of us who
have small-burner, low-output electric ranges, and no propane "King Cooker,"
the prospect of doing a full boil can be intimidating.
 
How about using one of those food-grade plastic fermenting buckets with
an electric heating element?  This would be similar to the "Bruheat"
setup, but without the $80 price tag.  I am concerned about the plastic's
resistance to prolonged boiling temperatures.  A quick experiment in
which I filled my bucket with a couple of gallons of boiling water
resulted in a slight softening of the plastic, but there were no alarming
structural problems.  
 
To sum it up,
 
Advantages:
 
 -  Dirt cheap, full-boil rig.
 -  Potential to mash, and with the addition of a double bucket, to sparge 
   all in the same apparatus.
 
Disadvantages:
 
 -  Possible structural failure?
 -  Wort carmelization due to the element's localized heat concentration.
 -  High worry factor.  :-)
 
Comments?  Suggestions?

Subject: oxidation


An anecdote pointing out the need for care to not oxidize your wort:
Last winter I made a beer close to Papazian's Doctor Bock.  It got a
28 in the first round of the AHA National, even though it was quite
young (one of the comments was that it was yeasty tasting) and not
malty enough for the style.  I entered it in the Michigan State Fair
competition (in July), where it got a 35, and the comment that it
tasted oxidized.  I have to agree -- there is a definite "cardboard"
taste to it now.  (I have also had oxidized beers with a nice
sherry-like flavor, but not this one.)


What did I do to get this flavor?


I think it happened because I just poured the hot wort into the cold water
in the carboy.  There was lots of splashing and foam.  Fix claims that
dark beers are at greater risk of oxidation because the melanoidins
(certain dark-colored compounds) can become oxidized, and later act as
oxidizing agents as the beer ages.  I think this is what happened to
my beer, because the cardboard flavor definitely took several months
to develop.


Since then, I've built a wort chiller, so it won't happen again (I
hope).

About Jim's (jfunk) question on glass vs plastic fermenters


Personally I like to use a plastic primary and a glass secondary.
The plastic primary means no blowoff tube.  The plastic fermenter
should be food grade, and to avoid scratching I just hose it out
after use and soak it with bleach prior to its next use.  I never
have needed to scrub.

From: martin`at`gamma.intel.com (Martin Wilde)
Subject: Caramelly taste with crystal malt and McMenamins


I would like to get a big caramelly taste from the usage of Crystal (Caramel) 
malt.  I have heard using large quantities of Crystal 20L will give you a 
caramelly taste and a dark color is this true?.  Normally I would use about 
5% of crystal 80L to get the desired color, but the amount of caramelly taste 
is not as high as what I am looking for and would probably be too sweet in 
large amounts.  


I ran the numbers through the Lovibond formulas and about a 20% mix of 
Crystal 20L will give me the color I desire.  My only worry is will I get the 
desired caramelly taste?  I suspect I will need to mash at a lower mash 
temperature (148 degrees) to avoid getting too sweet of a beer with all that 
crystal present.


On a different subject, the McMenamin brothers have created a fine institute
for craft beers here in Oregon.  Since Oregon allows minors in most pubs
up until 8pm or so, the McMenamin folks have gone out of their way to make 
their pubs a wholesome family place (they now even have a childrens menu, 
including peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!!!).  As far as them not selling
anything other than their own beers, I don't believe they would do that, since
they have a hard time keeping up with production of their own beers.  The only 
complaint I would have against them, is that their beers seem to be getting 
thinner.  Maybe they are just trying to satisfy the majority of people.

Subject: Diacetyl problem


I have a problem with diacetyl in a recent batch I made.  Here are the
specifics:
        * recipe was the extract based Kolsch recipe in Dave Miller's
                "Brewing the World's Great Beers."
        * yeast was Wyeast European Ale (I can never remember the numbers)
        * the F.G. was higher than expected (1.017) but seemed about right
          given the minimum attenuation specified in the yeast profiles
          from Wyeast.
        * bottled on 30 Oct.; stored at about 60 deg. F
        * 1 week later, carbonation was fine and tasted fine to the best of
          my recollection (a little sweet though)
        * started cold conditioning at 40 deg F on ~8 Nov.
        * tasted on ~22 Nov and there was a pronounced butter flavor.


My question, naturally, is what do I do?


I have read about diacetyl rests at ~70 deg F but they all seem to be at
the end of the secondary, not in the bottle after a couple of weeks of 
cold-conditioning.


Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

 Telluride is a compound of the element tellurium which is frequently

 I guess the reason no one answered is because it is another one of those well 
 guarded industry secrets.
 
 All I know about it as that after about ten orders of Klages from Minnesota 
 Mining, I was told that it was no longer available and has been replaced by 
 Harrington.  The only answer I could get as to why was that the brewers like 
 it better.
 
 My experience with it (for what that is worth) is that I can not tell the 
 difference.  It looks the same, tastes the same, performs the same and the 
 beer tastes the same.  After using Belgian malts for a few batches now, it is 
 probably safe to say that comparing Klages with Harrington is sort of like 
 comparing Miller with Bud.

I posted a note to rec.crafts.brewing but have gotten no responses so I

I'm interested to know what sorts of things go into malt extracts.  I've
read both Papazian and Miller but neither say much except to mention that
they can be obtained in light, amber and dark.  What I really want to know
is what is done to make these color differences?  Does amber extract contain
anything like crystal malt or chocolate malt, for example.  Is it simply the
kiln temperature?

I think I know what the missing factor is regarding getting a head when
pouring from a tap (er, faucet actually -- the tap is the gizmo that attaches
to the keg): pressure drop.  If you only partially open a faucet, you are
restricting the flow and thus causing the beer to flow through a smaller
opening.  The resulting flow is higher in velocity.  This is called the
venturi effect.  When the flow finally crosses the constriction, the
flow slows and the pressure drops and much of the dissolved CO2 comes out
of solution.  This is "slow pour" that Baderbrau retailers are taught to
offer their customers.  The resulting beer is less carbonated than it would
have been with a "fast pour" where the faucet is opened full-throttle.


My theory, then, of why your "bottled-from-the-keg-without-a-counter-
ressure-bottle-filler" beers did not have a head, would have to be that
it was because of the loss of dissolved CO2 when you filled the bottles.
For those who are unfamiliar, counter-pressure bottle fillers work by
keeping the beer under pressure during the whole transfer process, thereby
eliminating (actually minimizing) the loss of CO2 (i.e. carbonation).

I think I responded to Walt directly, but it may be of general interest, so
I'll post.  I used to cool to 70F, wait an hour and then pour through a
strainer into the fermenter, leaving the last quart or so of wort (the
part with most of the hot- and cold-break in it (trub)) in the kettle
(sometimes more sometimes less -- different extracts, by the way, produce
different amounts of trub).  I've since (very recently) decided that the
1 hour rest after cooling does little, since only very little of the total
cold break settles in the first hour (it seems to take much longer).


Partly because I've read that blowoff (which I use) elimininates much
of the undesirable compounds created by fermenting on the trub (higher
alcohols) and partly because I refuse to worry (I take Charlie quite
seriously on this point), I simply chill to 70F, measure OG and run it
through a sieve/funnel into the carboy.

Did not dough-in properly, leaving balled starch.  You should add the liquor
(water) to the the grain and work it through -- Noonan makes a BIG deal
about this.  It would explain the unconverted starch in the spent grains.

double-meaning in our world: "...could be worse... you could be homeless."


Let's not be too proud with our allgrain batches here folks: if the
gravity is lower than you would like, add some malt extract.


Since we're on the subject of extract efficiency, I'd like to make one
more point regarding the importance of knowing your extract efficiency.
This was brought up elsewhere, so I can't take credit for remembering
it, nor can I remember who should be getting the credit (sorry):


Probably the most important reason for knowing your extract efficiency,
it is so you can compensate when you are trying to duplicate someone else's
recipe.  If you see that they are claiming 30 points per pound per gallon
(judging from their grain bill and OG) and you know you only get 25, you 
add 20% more of each grain (30/25 = 1.2 ==> 120% ==> 20% more needed).

Subject: "Stationary phase"


In the last HBD I wrote:
> You _DO_ want to pitch the yeast when its in
> the stationary phase.


This generated a lot of e-mail questions, so:


What I refered to here as the 'stationary phase' is really
the very beginning of the dormant phase.  In other words,
let you starter ferment out _then_ pitch it.  Don't let
it sit too long or you'll have other problems.


As far as the argument that vigorously multiplying yeast will
start your wort faster, the yeast have a limited supply of glycogen
and it gets depleated through culture growth (multiplication).
If you then pitch this starter with an already depleated glycogen
level into your wort then you'll have more of a lag since the
cells won't be able to multiply as quickly (due to the low glycogen levels)
[think of glycogen as the fuel that drives the cell]  By letting
the cells reach stationary phase they have stoped multiplying,
begun storing up glycogen again, and just generally getting ready
to go dormant.


At least thats the Reader's Digest version of what I go out of:
> Impact of Yeast Handling Procedures on Beer Flavor During Fermentation
> Pickerell et. all.
> American Society of Brewing Chemists (ASBC) Journal, Vol 49:2, 1991, pp.87-92


For those of you who asked about the ASBC address, I don't have it here.
I'll post it later.  Personally I've found more usefull information
for what I do [I'm keeping a _BIG_ yeast bank] in the J of Inst. Brew.
Your mileage may vary.  I'll post at address if I can find it.
Be warned that these journals are not cheap!

Subject: whirlpools to clear wort


A lot has been said about how certain places/people whirlpool the wort
before chilling.  My simple-minded question is that if formation of DMS is
deemed to be problem, what's wrong with chilling first and THEN whirlpooling
prior to racking into a fermenter.  That would seem to avoid both DMS and
oxidation problems.  There must be some reason for whirlpooling before
chilling but I'd like to know what it is.

Subject: hop suggestions for anchor steam, please


I'm planning an Anchor Steam clone.  I welcome any hopping suggestions
that have been tested, including unconventional ones.


Has anyone else had the same problems Murray Robinson experienced with
WYeast 2112?  Maybe I'll have to change my weekend brewing plans :-(


Thanks to those who replied re: SN and fruitiness.  I have been
asked to post my recipes and will do so shortly, after consulting
my notes.


Cheers,

Subject: Need someone to critique my beer?




        I've reached a point in my partial mash brewing where my
        beers are, in my opinion, pretty good.  I'd like to hopefully
        get someone to taste my beer to let me know what they think
        I could do to improve it if I also send along my brewing
        process.


        Would anyone tasters be willing to receive a bottle or two
        from me?


        Michael
