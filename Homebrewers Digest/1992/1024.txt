Subject: Weird Yeast Starter


I started a yeast culture the other day.  Took the dregs of two bottles
of homebrew from a batch of beer that was brewed with first generation
Wyeast Bohemian pilsener. The "wort" I used was a approximately a pint
of water and a little less than a half a pound of granulated sugar that
was boiled for 5 minutes. When it cooled I threw in a teaspoon of yeast
nutrient as well. The day after the starter was starting to bubble, I
noticed some almost clear agglomerations floating at the top of the
wort. Some of the same stuff was in suspension as well as lying on the
bottom. The stuff reminded me of the meat of a lemon (you know, floating
around in ice tea) although it is absolutely colorless. The gas
emanating from the airlock smelled like yeast.


Yesterday, I threw the stuff out since I didn't want to waste a batch of
beer not knowing whether it was an infection or not. Before chucking the
stuff into the sink, I poured the starter into a glass. The
agglomerations that were present before dissolved completely. Not a
trace of them in the glass.


Can a starter look like this without being infected? Can it be some sort
of bacterial contamination or or can it be the yeast nutrient?  I've
never seen a bacterial infection before so I have no idea what one looks
like.  The brew that I cultivated the starter from was the first batch
I've done with liquid yeast and the starter I used then sure didn't look
like this last one.

 Having had indifferent results when trying to freeze cultures for 
reuse, I resorted to buying a bottle of Freeze Shield from the Yeast
Bank folks. (At $2.and change, I figured it was cheap enough for an
experiment.)


 Unfortunately, I neglected to read the instruction sheet with one of
the Yeast Bank kits to check the mix concentration with active wort.


 Would some kind soul be so good as to forward me this information, as
well as a quick-and-dirty on the procedure?

Hey now-  I saw an ad somewhere (I think the new Zymurgy) for glass
blow-off tubes.  The ad claims (and i agree) that glass is easier to 
clean than plastic so you don't need to do as much work to get all
the gunk out.  I currently use a 1" i.d. tube that works really well 
but is a total bitch to clean, especially after a particularly violent
batch.


Has anyone seen or used one of these glass tubes?  


thanks

Yes, I've had bee problems during the summer, but I notice it mostly when
mashing and sparging, attracted by the sugars.  A few have been lost in the
boil (worker bee ale?) and fished out.  I have also noticed that when the sky
becomes overcast the bees go away.  I've never been stung though, so I assume
that they approve of my efforts.  Try making perry in the fall if you are
thrilled by the prospect of happy bees crawling on you (just don't let them
down your shirt collar or up your pant leg). 




On another note- I am flying to Boston this weekend.  I'm not sure where I will
be staying-somewhere near Harvard/Mass. Gen. Hosp., I assume.  What are the
beer-highlights of the area, assuming that I can escape for some free time?  I
have been to Commonwealth and will try to return.  Are there any other (or new)
brewpubs within subway distance?  Any interesting (rare) imports that are not
available elsewere (Michigan)? 
Thanks for the help.

Subject: Carbonating Mead


Hello,


I have just brewed my first batch of mead. So far, I have racked it twice.
I know that traditional mead is uncarbonated, however, I thought that 
carbonating it might be a nice touch.  I got to thinking that if the yeast
is all dead (and assumably it is, since the alcoholic content is in the order 
of 12-13%) and all of the suspended yeast has settled out, how will the mead
carbonate if I simply prime with corn sugar at bottling time?  My questions 
are as follows:


1) Should I carbonate the mead and if so how?
2) Does all of the yeast settle out? What happens in the carboy?
3) Is the alcoholic strength of the mead too strong to support any yeast 
   activities?


Thank you,


Greg.

More on wort pumps:
I use a Teel model 1P760A hot water booster pump.  About $60 (Granger).  It
works well for transfer of hot sparge water.  I'm a little concerned about
transfer of cold wort to fermentation vessels, unless you knock the thing down
and sanitize the impeller assembly.  The only problem that I have encountered
is that it does not pump boiling water well.  It tends to form an airlock above
95C even when well primed.  I'm also happier transfering hot wort by gravity
because the impeller seems rather abusive.

James P. Buchman  asks about buying shares of Baderbrau.


There was some chatter about it on Compuserve a few months ago.  It is (or at 
least was) on NASDAQ under BRAU.  Art Steinmetz did some digging around about 
Baderbrau's financial situation and posted the following:


*********************
From:    Art Steinmetz/NYC 76044,3204


I just pulled up some stats on BRAU on my handy-dandy screen. 
Pavichevich Brewing has yet to make a profit.  The stock has been trading, I
think, since 10/89 although the company has financial results going back to
1987.  The stock price ran up to 6-1/4 in 4/90 and promptly crashed to 1-1/2 by
the following Jan. It's quoted between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 for the last year.  Price
action is non-existant.  Volume is invisible. 1.56mm shares outstanding.


In October 1990 they defaulted on bonds they issued and owe $250k in back
interest on those.


They owe $1.25mm to Steel City National Bank of Chicago.


As of this Jan. they were in a capital crisis since operating revenue was
insufficient to meet operating needs.  They were trying to arrange $1.5mm
through a sale-leasback of the equipment.  Didn't happen.  Around June they
raised $426,000 in a private placement of stock.  They're still up to their
eyeballs in debt.  Total liabilities are $2.3mm vs. assets of $2.7mm as of
1992Q1.  They must have some more debt somewhere 'cuz my screen shows a negative
book value for the stock of $-0.20 per share.


Sales in the quarter ending April 30 were $227,000 vs. $237,000 previously. Beer
unit sales were up 6% but prices declined pursuant to their distribution deal
resulting in the drop in revenues.


Paterno Imports Ltd. has been their national distributor since June 1991.


They're hanging on by a thread.  Caveat Emptor.

Subject: Removing Chlorine


My brewing water comes off a private water association.  I went in to the
county health department to get a water analysis, just out of curiosity. 
The analysis was just puzzling, all of the substances tested for were low,
but the total dissolved solids was 450 ppm!  No idea what the unknown
goobers in the water are, but the district is out of compliance...


Anyway, I'm talking with my friend who works there and telling her about
my homebrewing...  I ask her about the chlorine levels, since I know the
water association has been docked for not controlling it properly.  I've
been concerned about getting the chlorine out of my mash and sparge water,
so I've been boiling it beforehand.  She tells me that boiling only
removes chlorination by pure chlorine gas!  Our water association uses
sodium hypochlorite (bleach).  This is not removed by boiling.  She says
that hypochlorite can be removed by two methods:  exposure to sunlight and
evaporation, and adding sodium thiosulphate (photographic hypo).


Setting my water out for a couple of days is not real practical (among
other things, I live in NW Washington state, so we won't see any UV for
another seven or eight months...), and I don't really want to add hypo to
my beer.  Ick!


The other thing that I learned is that there are three ways to chlorinate
water: gaseous chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, and chloramine (sp?).  I don't
know anything about chloramine, but my friend tells me that it is a more
stable form of chlorine compound.  She also tells me that < 4ppm chlorine
has little or no purifying effect, and > 8ppm is too much and will taste
of chlorine.  Supposedly, if it is done right, you can't taste the
chlorine...  We always have a strong taste of chlorine in the water and
2 out of 3 beer judges tell me I have phenols in my beer (sob...)


Does anybody know:


1) What are the reaction products of sodium hypochlorite and sodium
thiosulphate, and is this safe in beer?  (I suspect not...)


2) What will remove the chlorine from my water?


Thankz,
       Paul.

I also had a diacetyl problem.  I believe Miller advocates doing 
the diacetyl rest in the primary after fermentation subsides.  
Something to do with the lack of oxygen causing the yeast to 
absorb the diacetyl (speeded up with a temperature boost).  If 
you rack to the secondary before the diacetyl rest, then some oxygen
will be introduced and prevent the absorption of the diacetyl.


My current fermentation schedule is (for ales):
   1) 3 day primary fermentation at 65F.
   2) 2 day diacetyl rest at 70F in the primary.
   3) 7 to 21 days in secondary (in the coldest part of the 
      house) for clearing & dry hopping.


I haven't tasted any of the batches since switching to this 
schedule, but I'm hoping that this schedule solves my diacetyl 
problem.  I did notice the strong butter-scotch odor eminating from
the air lock disappear during the diacetyl rest period.

Subject: RE: Wyeast 2112, counter pressure bottling




Hi All,


   In HBD 1023, Rob Bradley asks:


>I'm planning an Anchor Steam clone.  I welcome any hopping suggestions
>that have been tested, including unconventional ones.


     Quite some time ago, someone posted to HBD describing a tour they
   had taken of the Anchor brewery in San Francisco.  This post went
   into such detail that it sounded like a report from an industrial
   espionage mission.  The poster reported that Anchor uses Northern
   Brewer for bittering and Hersbrucker for aroma.  According to Fred
   Eckhardt, the bittering level is 40 IBUs.  Anchor Steam(tm) :-)
   also has a considerable hop nose to it, so dry-hopping is indicated.


   Rob also asks:


>Has anyone else had the same problems Murray Robinson experienced with
>WYeast 2112?  Maybe I'll have to change my weekend brewing plans :-(


     Re-reading Murray's post(HBD 1022), my interpretation is that he
   was using liquid yeast for the first time, and was concerned that the
   *starter* was not showing much of a krausen.
     Murray didn't specify the gravity of his starter, but my
   understanding is that starters with a gravity of 1.020-1.025 won't
   display much of a krausen.  I've used liquid yeast exclusively for
   the past year or so, with starters of that gravity, and have never
   gotten the large krausen one normally associates with primary
   fermentation.  At most, I see a small ring of bubbles around the edge
   of the liquid, and some bubbles coming up through the solution, yet
   I've always gotten good vigorous fermentations using these starters.
     Coincidentally, I used Wyeast 2112 to brew an Anchor Steam(tm) clone
   this weekend.  The temperature in my basement is 58-60, I pitched
   the yeast mid-afternoon, when I checked it just before bedtime there
   was foam forming on top and bubbles in the airlock.  Looks good so far,
   so my advice to Murray and Rob is to relax.


   Also in HBD 1023, an interesting discussion between Al and Jack on
   counter-pressure bottling and carbonation.


     Until recently, I was one of those people who bottled from the keg
   without a counter pressure bottle filler.  Several HBDs ago, I posted
   a procedure for doing that which involved chilling the bottles and
   filling right to the top.  These steps are an attempt to minimize the
   CO2 passing out of solution due to the pressure drop that occurs 
   when the beer comes out of the tap.
         A few weeks ago, I obtained a counter pressure filler, and I've
   noticed the same phenomena that Jack reported.  Beers bottled with
   the counter pressure filler are much better carbonated than those
   bottled straight from the tap.  I agree with Al's conclusion that
   counter pressure fillers minimize the loss of CO2 by keeping the
   beer under pressure during the whole transfer process.
     Another advantage of the counter pressure fillers is that the
   bottle can be purged of oxygen prior to filling.  When bottling
   straight from the tap, the presence of oxygen in the bottle assures
   some amount of oxidation will occur, regardless of how quietly the
   bottle is filled.  If the beer is going to be consumed within a short
   period of time, this may not be significant.  However, if the beer
   is to be kept for several weeks, or submitted to a competition, I`d
   recommend a counter pressure filler.
     One more anecdotal point about the filling straight from the tap
   method, it's not exactly foolproof.  Some months ago, I went to a
   friend's house to help him bottle some beer from his keg.  He had used
   forced carbonation, and had gone a little overboard, as he kept the
   beer under 40 psi at 40F.  The beer was so highly carbonated, it
   foamed violently as soon as it hit the end of the tap, making it
   impossible to fill a bottle.  After about 30 minutes of trying, all
   we had achieved was an incredible mess, one-half gallon of homebrew
   sitting in a catch basin, another half-gallon sprayed about his cellar
   floor, six bottles half-filled with foam, and two very chagrined
   homebrewers.
     
                                   Cheers,
                                     Jim

I suggested that he may want to enter his beer in a competition.  Then it dawned

In regard to Jeff's idea to install a heating element in a plastic
bucket and use that to mash/sparge/boil.


Well, I've got experience here. I've done just that. Twice. My suggestion
is not to do it. 


I did this for mashing - nowhere near enough heat was produced for boiling.
(I boil on a stovetop, and even wimpy stoves put out more heat than
the element ever did) My experience with mashing in it was bad - the mash
was too hot near the element and too cold away from it, stir as I might.
Both of these Bruheat clones have been relegated to sparging duties, and
I now do the mash and boil on the stovetop.


As far as structural integrity, I made these 2-3 years ago and just recently
one sprang a leak around the spigot. No worries there!


In sum, I advise against.

Subject: Mash Thickness

 Fm: Jack Schmidling
 
 After reading an interesting article on barleywine by Micah in the current 
 issue of the Celebrator, I bagan to wonder about the reasons for thick 
 mashes.  He recommends using a megadose of malt in a mash of about normal 
 consistancy, to produce a high gravity wort without sparging.  George Fix has 
 also written about the advantages of minimal sparging.
 
 So I ask, why do we sparge at all?  Why not just mash 10 lbs of malt in 10 
 gallons of water, drain it off and start boiling?
 
 The search through my references was not very satisfying on the subject.  It 
 seems that the most repeated reason is that the enzyme efficiency is reduced. 
 But like so many other "problems" that claim this as the evil, the solution 
 is to simply mash a little longer or use more malt.
 
 Noonan goes one step further and says a "thick mash improves enzyme 
 performance.  In a thin mash, proteolytic and other heat-labile enzymes are 
 destroyed in the course of the rest: in a thick mash, they may survive into 
 the saccharification range."
 
 This makes no sense at all.  It reads more like a description of the survival 
 rate of wildebeasts as a result of herding than of chemestry.
 
 Can anyone support this legend with actual experience?
 
 Sparging is a "simple" and efficient way of extracting the sugar from the 
 grain but all other things being equal, it would be more conveninent to use a 
 thin mash and just a small final sparge to rinse out anything left behind.
 It would also greatly simplify that first plunge into all grain beer.

Subject: SN clone recipes, fruitiness revisited


I posted in HBD 1021 about my Sierra Nevada clones and asked questions
about fruitiness.  Some people have asked for recipes:


  Pale Ale  Porter 
  --------  ------ 
    7 lb      7 lb   UK 2-row pale ale malt (Munton & Fison)
    1 lb    1/2 lb   UK 2-row crystal malt ("Wine Inc." brand; Lovibond=?)
    ----    1/2 lb   UK 2-row chocolate malt ("Wine Inc.")


1 3/4 oz      1 oz   Cascade flowers, 1 hour boil (all hops 5.5% alpha)
    1 oz    1/2 oz   Cascade flowers, 30 minute boil
  1/2 oz    1/2 oz   Cascade flowers, 15 minute boil
  1/3 oz    1/2 oz   Cascade flowers, add after boil & steep 15 minutes
  1/5 oz    1/5 oz   Cascade flowers, dry hops


                     Wyeast 1056 for both


    1048      1050   Original gravity
    1012      1014   Final gravity


  Day  6    Day  6   Rack to secondary
No fining   Day  7   Gelatine finings
  Day  6    Day  8   Add dry hops
  Day 12    Day 18   Bottle


Infusion mash: Strike with 2 gallons at 167F
               Hold at 150F for 75 minutes
               Mash-out at 172F.


Sparge with 4 gallons at 172F.


Brew length was slightly more than 5 gallons.
Exactly 5 gallons racked to secondary.


What I would change:  For the porter, nothing :-)
For the pale ale, I would use Perle (as SN does) in the first hop
addition and fewer HBUs of it.  1 ounce of Perle at 7.6% was suggested
by Brian Batke.  He also suggested Perle for the 30 minute addition.


Other notes:  I like the effect of a 15 minute steep after the boil;
some might worry about DMS.  Some would think 5 grams of dry hops 
insufficient; perhaps I would use more if I didn't have the steeping
hops.  The slightly higher yield from the same weight of grist in
the porter may be explained by a different grain bag (you may recall
I lost my Brew-bits bag)-:


Tony Babinec suggests that an all-Cascade pale ale of this sort is
more in the style of Liberty Ale.  I agree, but I would add even 
more boiling hops and finishing hops if I were trying to clone it.




Some have suggested that SN is not very fruity beer.  I agree.
The fruitiness I was referring to was subtle.  The beer in question
was about 60F.  I had another SNPA this weekend.  It had been in
the fridge and then left at room temp for 30 minutes (so <50F?)
and at that temperature, there was no evident fruitiness.
Plenty of hop aroma and maltiness, though.


Finally, I said in 1021 "Ultimately, fuitiness derives from the malt",
or words to that effect, your honor.  By this, I never meant to
downplay the importance of yeast and temperature in ester production.
However, the chemical constituents of the esters don't fall from
the heavens, they come from the malt.  I was only wondering if what
effect, if any, the malt might have on ester production.


Cheers,

I would like some information on what exactly is oxidation of wort and

Mashing/sparging problems?


>Causes I can think of are:

If this was actually the temp it should not be a problem, I've seen my
highest yeilds from lower temp mashes 148-50 F.

Yes, a mash out should help because it tends to get more sugars in solution
which makes for more effective sparging. I think that the mashing end of
grain brewing is less of a problem than the sparging side, but it gets the
blame anyhow.


>4) I sparges too fast.


This is possible but not usually a physical possibility.


>5) the mash was too tight.  Miller recommends 1.33 quarts per pound.
 > This was indeed the tightest mash I have yet done  (Micah??? you say
 > you usually use a rather tight mash.....)


What I consider a tight mash is 24oz water /pound grain and not to excede
32oz/lb in a normal mash. The stiffer the mash (with in reason), better 
the more effective the enzyme activity. This also allows for more water 
to be slated for use in the mash out and sparge without add to the total 
amount of water used.
I would consider 1.3 qt/lb to be a very loose mash.


>6) As I said, this same sparging system has turned out 29-30 points, so I

I would not change this system then, but I would look at changing the
allocation of your mashing/sparging water.

I would just like to point out that any atempt to concentrate alcohol

of the volumes involved, it carries the same property forfiture and penalties
as the manufacture of illegal drugs. So be careful with this topic.

If you have a plastic container that will stay structurally sound at

I would consider a slight softening with water that has started to
cool down from boiling as an alarming structural problem.
 1. The temperature durring the boil will be a little higher.
 2. A full batch will exert more force on the plastic than a couple
    of gallons.
 3. The boiling time is probably longer than your test.
 
If you are still intent on trying it, I'd suggest a test run using
the more water than you intend, adding salt to bring up the 
specific gravity of the water above what you normally use, and
boiling for about twice as long.  Maybe doing this whole test in
a bath or wash tub and watching it the whole time would give you
some confidence.

Subject: leaving the trub in your wort


I know this has been covered before - about how the trub contains valuable 
food for the yeast - but I ususally ignored the issue because I wanted to get 
as much junk out of my beer as possible.  So I usually siphon the cooled wort 
from the brew pot to the primary, leaving the slimy stuff behind.  But this 
last batch I did something a little different.  


I pitched the clear wort in primary with an 8 oz. starter of Wyeast European 
Ale (1338) that was at full krausen.  I then took the muddy layer of trub, 
including lots of hops residue (from pellets), and transferred it into a 
sterlized 2 litre soda-pop bottle.  I had about 1/2 gallon of mud.  I added a 
few drops (8-10) of yeast that was left in the starter bottle, and placed the 
muddy concoction under fermentation lock.


Ten hours later very differnt things were happening in the 2 'batches'.  The 
muddy half-gallon had separated into 1/3 sediment, 2/3 fermenting beer.  The 5 
gallons in primary hadn't done anything.  The yeast came from the same source, 
the wort came from the same source, the temps were all the same, the only 
difference appears to be the trub contained in the half-gallon batch.  I 
didn't try to estimate the volumn of the 'few drops' of yeast, but it seems 
that 8 oz in 5 gallons is a better ratio than 'few drops' in half-gallon.
My last experience with batch 1338 took 24 hours to show signs of 
fermentation, but that was siphoned off the trub also.  I ended up siphoning 
the active wort off of the sediment, and into the non-active batch, and 
sometime during the night the 5 gallon batch took off. 


I'm not saying that this proves anything, but since I do 2-stage fermentation 
anyways, I'm thinking of leaving any cold-break material, hop residue, etc. 
all in primary and then siphoning off of it when going to secondary.  I figure
I will be at higher risk for producing chill haze, but it might be worth it.


Any comments/advice would be appreciated.

Subject: Brew Bees


Bob Jones brought up an interesting observation in regards to
bees and garage brewing.  I too brew in the garage, not out of
choice but because of a fascist, anti-brewing female thing. 
Well, that and maybe the Wave of Wort debacle, but I'm sure its
mostly the female thing.
 
I have bees visit when I brew.  A lone bee will show up around
mid-mash, soon to be followed by its friends.  By end of boil the
bees number about a dozen.  They appear to like the wort and
things that come into contact with it.  The stirring spoon,
thermometer and spent ph strips all get surreptitious
inspections.  When wort drips on the floor, the bees fasten
around the droplets like spokes on a wheel.  I assume its the
malt sugar they're after.
 
At first I thought having bees around while brewing was a bad
thing, what with sanitation and all that.  I went so far as to
try to rid the garage of bees via a badminton racket.  It became
a war of diminishing return and I soon gave up.  Although the
bees never noticed me running around in circles swinging a
badminton racket, the neighbors sure did.
 
I once asked an entomologist friend about bees and brewing.  He
went on and on about nectar, chemical receptors, wind direction,
sun elevation, hive dancing and food stores.  All well and good I
guess.  The next-door neighbor's ten year-old explained it
differently.  She said that bees like sweet stuff.  And they say
the smart ones have college degrees.
 
I no longer mind having bees around when I brew.  We both go
about our own business.  I'm careful not to step on them, I
politely shake them off the utensils and I keep my pint covered
with a coaster.  In return they've never stung me and they've
never once asked for free beer.  Not yet anyway.

Subject: can I rescue this batch?


A colleague and I have brewed a lager pilsner that suffers from a lack
of carbonation.  It tastes really great for about the first 10 seconds
after you open it, then it goes flat.  We have been experimenting with
the amount of priming sugar in the batch; that's the likely culprit.


We brewed it way back in September, then fermented it for 6 weeks.
The SG went from 1.042 down to 1.007, so the yeasties seem to have
done their work.  We then primed with 2/3 cup of corn sugar and
bottled it.  It's been in the bottles now for about 6 weeks.


But I'd like to try to rescue the batch.  Can I just open each bottle
and add a tad more sugar solution?  If so, how do I determine how much
and at what concentration?  Should I add more yeast as well?


Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Subject: WYEAST 2112 - Problems Solved


Thanks to everyone concerned with regards to the apparent problems I had had with 
WYEAST 2112 - California Lager. What has become perfectly clear is that when using a 
liquid yeast you must allow the yeast to reproduce to the maximum extent in the 
original packet if you wish to avoid lag times in the starter culture and finally the 
fermenter. I must admit that I probably pitched my yeast into a starter for two
reasons:


1) I had a new toy that I was itching to use and so probably pitched it a little early.
2) Autralians work in metric units not imperial so a 1 inch thick yeast packet is 
and arbitary measure of thickness to me.


Premature pitching of the yeast from packet to starter IMHO obviously results in 
significant lag times (in my case more than 48 hours) which then exposes the starter 
to potential spoiling by harmfull bacteria. Fortunately, my Munich Lager is now 
fermenting away furiously in the fermenter with no off smells or flavours.


thanks again,
