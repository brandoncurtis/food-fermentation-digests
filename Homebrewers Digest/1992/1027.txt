Subject: floating mashtuns


I use a "floating mash tun" most of the time and am very happy with it.
Can I suggest a few things following the recent posting.


From: "Wayde Nie, Eng.Phys. II"

Also carry out water treatment (on all the water note) eg gypsum

You don't need to worry too soon about changing the temp of the water.
Draw the strike water directly into the mash tun, adding the goods as
normal. Seal the lid and submerge in the boiler. Only now do you need
bother about the temp of the water in the boiler. Strike temp is higher
than initial mash temp so you now simply add cold water into the boiler
(and adjust thermostat) to get correct temp. The thermal inertia of the
goods in the mash is quite large and having it submerged in water that's
a little bit hot for a few moments won't alter its temp.


>                         Allow the mash to complete. After the
>mash, remove the mash tun from the boiler and adjust thermostat
>to sparge temp.


Again, no need to remove the mash tun from the boiler. As the water comes
up to sparge temp, the goods will only rise in temp a little - and that's
no bad thing because it's desirable to raise the temp for a "mash out"
anyway. (rather than let it stand for a short while and cool down a little)


>               Transfer the sparge water to another vessel and
>sparge through the mash tun back into the boiler. Boil your wort.
>when it's finished chill and drain into a primary.


It could be done by sparging into another vessel and then transferring into
the boiler after sparge, but the benefit of your way is that you can begin
to bring the first runnings of the wort to the boil before sparging is
complete.


I like to keep things simple, I hope that is of help. I have come to like
the floating mash tun method. But I suppose that's a personal choice.

Excellent safety advice - and compulsory in the UK

I suspect that setting your water out for a few days is easily practical.
Fill a santized carboy with water and put an airlock on it.  Set it in
front of a window.  There's at least some UV, even through clouds.


I used to remove chlorine this way (except without sanitation) to
prepare water for adding to a fishtank.  I couldn't smell any chlorine
after a day of waiting (there will be some smell when you first remove
the cap, but that will go away).  Later I started using sodium
thiosulphate.  The fish didn't die ;^)


Perhaps you should boil the water beforehand, so that you'll be sure
to have sterile dechlorinated water to add to your wort later.

Subject: cold break and malt extract




Regarding yeast nutrients in trub, and in particular one poster's experiment 
with making a yeast starter with trub in it (am I remembering right?) which 
started more quickly than one without: I am wondering if that is why I get 
such explosive starts when I pitch a fresh batch of cooled wort onto a yeast 
cake off of which I have just siphoned & bottled.


I've tried this a couple of times but generally I haven't been impressed with 
the results - a certain coarseness of flavor seems to occur which I might 
guess would be attributable to kicking all that yuck up through the beer one 
more time.


What about cooling, racking off the trub and pitching, but siphoning off just 
a LITTLE of the trub into the primary for some nutrients?  Any comments?


Regarding malt extract: I've been using William's stuff (syrup) largely because 
it's inexpensive and seems to be reputable.  Anybody want to confirm or dispute 
that?  Can I do better (other than going to partial or full mash, which I'll 
get to evENtually but not just yet)?  The various canned syrups seem to be 
substantially more expensive than William's pouch-ed syrup.  Apparently 
they buy theirs in bulk ("big drums") and then package in plastic pouches 
for shipping - but I don't know where they get the stuff from originally.  
Been meaning to ask.


Beerily yours,

Painful isn't it?  I've never had the problem with beers, only meads.  Watching
10 lb of hand-picked black raspberries fade is not a happy sight.  For this

heat (minimum past.temp) or NO TREATMENT at all.  I  have had no spoilage
problems most likely due to the high alcohol concentration.  I know this is not
much help as far as beers go, BUT in the case of bleached meads (and wine for
that matter) the alcohol formed in the fermentation extracts enough color from
the fruit skins that the beverage again becomes colored, although obvoiusly not
as intensly as it would have been.

Subject: hydrogen sulfide is yeast culture


Hello,


I have a few questions about culturing yeast. A friend of mine was nice 
enough to give me a few cultures of Wyeast. [Wyeast is impossible to get 
around here.] One of the slants he gave me has Wyeast 1007 in it. 


I received them about 2 weeks ago and I occationally vent 
them so they don't blow up, I also keep them in the fridge. Today when I 
vented it I found a really strong rotten egg smell come from that slant only. 
I remember reading something about hydrogen sulfide some time ago but I can't 
remember what it said. Can someone enlighten me to what is causing the 
production of hydrogen sulfide.


BTW, the slants were made and autoclaved in a microbiology lab at a local 
Univ. and proper aseptic technique was used to streak the slants.


Thanks

Subject: priming agents






On a recent Sunday afternoon, my brewpartners and I were getting ready
to perform a ritual bottling of a London-style ale when a conversation
like this occurred:


"Hey!  This is going to be a _great_ beer!  I can't wait to get this
bottled!"


"Me too!  Let's get started...  Where's the corn sugar???"


"I thought _you_ were going to buy the corn sugar?!?!"


"No, I thought _you_ were going to swing by the store and get it!"


"Aw, sh_t!!!"




So, we ended up with an aborted attempt at bottling.  (We _did_ realize
that we were without corn sugar before doing anything with the secondary
==> no lost beer.)




*******
However
*******
We realize that there oughtta be a way to use a bit of DME or other
non-table-sugars as a priming agent.  We thought about using DME at the
time, but the technique for doing so was not in our brewing repertoire,
so we erred on the side of caution and decided to wait until we could
get some corn sugar.


My question to the HBD is:  Other then corn sugar, what are other
acceptable priming agents and what is the technique for their use???

Subject: Boiling Hops




In yesterdays digest Rob (bradley`at`adx.adelphi) outlines his SN clone
experiments.  The following struck me:


>or the pale ale, I would use Perle (as SN does) in the first hop
addition and fewer HBUs of it.  1 ounce of Perle at 7.6% was suggested
by Brian Batke.  He also suggested Perle for the 30 minute addition.


>Tony Babinec suggests that an all-Cascade pale ale of this sort is
more in the style of Liberty Ale.  I agree, but I would add even
more boiling hops and finishing hops if I were trying to clone it.




I've always lived under the assumption that the 60 minute addition will
basically just give you bitterness. (ie. 2 oz of 5% cascades will be
indistinuishable from 1 oz of 10% clusters) And that only in the later 
additions would different hop types cause significant differences. 
Specifiacally, about > 30 minutes of boil would drive off all aroma 
and most flavor, >10 minutes would drive off much aroma and leave flavors,
and <10 min boil was required for significant aroma. 


I've seen a theory advanced that the above assumptions are false. That the
bitterness derived from high AA hops has a different characteristic than
the same IBU derived from, say, noble hops.


What does the Digest audience think?  Are 30 IBU of cascades and clusters
the same when derived from a 60 min boil?  At what point (minutes) do you
drive off most off the flavor? aroma?

The DeWolf-Cosyns Belgian Cara-Pils grain is very different from most other
Cara-Pils or "Dextrine Malts" as they are sometimes called.  Most are crunchy
whereas the Belgian is indeed chewey.

That bandaid flavor is phenolics.  The most common source of them is from
your yeast (Munton & Fison yeast is notorious for them) but the Troubleshooting
special issue of Zymurgy mentions that wheat malt can cause them also.
Perhaps there's something in the Belgian Cara-Pils that does this also.
However, I have not noticed this problem -- granted I've never used 2 pounds
in a batch!!!  It could simply be a reaction between your strain of yeast and
something in the the Cara-pils.

Much more reasonable -- I hope I get to taste it at tonight's CBS meeting.
If it is the world's greatest beer, I'll be honest and tell you I think so.

To make a long story short, Cara-Pils is the lightest-colored of a series of
Crystal malts.  They are "mashed in the shell" so to speak by being kilned
at mashing temperatures first, before being dried.  The temperature of the
drying is what determines the color of the final product.  DeWolf-Cosyns
make four Crystal malts:


Cara-Pils          5 - 10  Lovibond
Cara-Munich         15 - 30  L
Cara-Vienne         70 - 80  L
Special B        150 - 250 L

Amen.


Question:
Does anyone know how to measure the Lovibond rating of a malt?

You correct yourself later, but chloride and sulfate are very common in
beer indeed, especially in Burton Ales.  I agree, that not all chemistry is
bad, but the thought of drinking fixer is beyond me, and I'm crazy enough
to make Lambics (which look like sewers while fermenting).

The last two batches I have attempted to make a bitter simular to 
Red Hook. I have purchased bulk (55 pounds) of Laaglander Extra Light
spray malt, my problem is that both batches OG were 1.050-1.055 and 
finished at 1.028. I used both a Wyeast (Irish) for first batch, and
Muton and Fison dry (2 packages) for the second batch. My question is
are there a large amount of unfermentables in spray malts in general, 
or is this a problem with the Extra light variety ? I have not had a 
problem with cans of malt extract finishing so high.

I reply:
       Dave I have had similar results with Laaglander malts.  They tend to
produce a low Original Gravity and a high Final Gravity.  This is also
confirmed by Papazian in TCJOHB and by many other homebrewers.  My old standby
is Munton and Fison.  I've had excellent results with M&F and it ferments out
well.  My typical FG is in the teens for Pale Ale (using 7 - 8 lbs of M&F
light).  Greg.

Welcome to St. Louis, Jim.  In St. Louis, many natives consider a beer not made 
by Anheuser Busch to be "imported".  A severe case of "buy American".  But 
things are looking up.


There is one brewpub in St. Louis, called (suprise) St. Louis Brewery.  Dave 
Miller, the author of two well-known books on homebrewing, is the brewmaster 
there.  The restaurant/bar part of the business is called _The Tap Room_.  It is 
located at 2100 Locust Street.  Telephone 314/241-BEER.  The beer is quite good, 
but the character is never "up front" or "you CAN'T miss it obvious".  Remember, 
this is the land where Bud is the King.  Dave says his biggest seller is the 
Wheat Ale, followed by a Pils.  This despite a really good Oatmeal Stout that's 
nearly always available.  See how that works?  A big cheesburger, plate of spicy 
fries, and a pint of your favorite will run you about $10.  Standard disclaimers 
apply.


Homebrew suppliers: There are two in St. Louis.  Their addresses and a couple 
comments were in yesterday's Digest, I think. Maybe the day before.  If you 
missed it, send me e-mail and I'll forward the info. Homebrewing is still 
technically illegal in Missouri, but it seems the State has bigger fish to fry, 
and they leave us alone.  Some people are working on this sad situation, though. 
Maybe  there'll be more suppliers once this vestige of prohibition is 
eliminated.  After that, we go after the extortionary tax laws, right?  $7 tax 
on a barrel for small producers.  I don't know what AB pays.  More, I suspect.  
Just think, at least $7 tax on each barrel of..... water!!


Good local brands? HaHaHaHaHaHa!!  The only *good* local brand is St. Louis 
Brewery's brand: "Schlafly".  This is of course, opinion.  An appeal to the 
majority would reveal Bud, Busch, Michelob, etc to be the good local brands.


Oh -- the St. Louis Brews homebrew club meets at the Maplewood Community Center 
the first Thrusday of each month at 7:30 PM.  If you want directions after you 
move here, just send e-mail to tell me where you're driving from, and I'll give 
you directions.

Subject: re:plastic boilers,hot water heaters and floating mashtuns...


        I have been using a simple floating mash tun successfully for a number
of years now. Earlier I had mashed with a Burco but didn't find it to be very
"relaxing", mash-wise( lots of temperature spikes, etc.etc.) as well as boil-
wise (not enough "oomph").


        The device you describe sounds interesting but I wonder how well it 
would work with a step-mash.  Line's system is for simple infusion mashes only.
Bitters are really the only thing I brew (I'm a lazy kind of guy + I can't
relax enough to wait for a lager).  The reason this system works so well for a
simple  mash is that the large volume of water in which the mash vessel floats
effectively dampens any major changes in temperature.  The strike temperature
and ratio of water to goods that I typically use yields a mash temp of
151-153F.  After two hours in the immersion bath, I find that the temperature
of the mash will have only dropped to about 147-148F (the vessel is well
insulated + I don't add any additional heat during the mash). Your heating 
element would have to be capable of getting a large volume of water (approx.
5 gals is needed to float a mash kettle holding 7-8 lbs of grain + water)up to
temperature in short order. You mentioned this as a potential problem and, 
although I'm really not experienced in doing step mashes, I do know that
raising the temperature of 5 gals of water is a job.


        Where I live, electricity rates are outrageous.  I use a Cajun-cooker
type of arrangement, both for rapidity of boil as well as economy.  I also
realize that these devices would probably be frowned upon in the middle of an
apartment floor! :>)

Is it the real Dick Van Dyke who made the winning stout.  the photo

is that those van dyke boys are from Illinois.


also, Al touts the virtues of the new Lallemand dry beer yeasts. before
we fall for the fancy titles and nice product brochures, let's remember
that the same company has been making Doric for years and noone is 
raving about Doric.  I'm always skeptical when the ads give no
info whatsoever that would suggest the process has been changed or
cleaned up to produce better yeast.


I've only tasted one beer made with Windsor and it was poor.  not a very
scientific sample, but enough to deter me.


It's also noteworthy that the winning stout was made with Red STar 
dry champagne yeast, at least that's what's in zymurgy.  it's also
noteworthy that the recipe has an incredible 14+ ounces of hops and
licorice and molasses.  hardly a beer to even begin to look for 
off-flavors in.  Looks like a very original recipe and a beer that
could be set aside for a year.

* pellets Utilization factor ~ 30 and don't require full boil 
ie. 20 minutes still yield approximately full utilization. 
    
should be boiled no longer than 45 minutes. 


* leaf UF ~ 25 and need ~ 60 minutes to obtain full utilization 
at 20 minutes, bitterness contribution is small. 


* plugs UF ~20 -same timing as leaf. 
           
* any hops in a typical high gravity boil yield a substantial reduction
  in UF. 25%? This is real important to consider when going to all-grain.

Subject: Mash thickness, Blow-tube cleaning, Plastic cases


Mash thickness:


I've read differring opinions re: thin mash vs. thick mash.  Miller
states that thick mashes (1.33 qts water / lb. grain) encourages
initial starch conversion but discourages complete conversion.  Well,
as time goes on I find myself referring to Miller more and more and
my mashes are thick.  Also, a thick mash allows me to turn off the
stove when the mash reaches temp., cover and leave alone for 15-20
minutes, knowing that the thermal inertia of the mash will keep the
mash temp. within range.  For a recent batch, however, I mashed for 30
minutes at 122 F (approximately), then 90 minutes at 152 (again,
approximately) but conversion wasn't complete (according to iodine
test).  So, my brainstorm:  I heated about 1.5 gallons of water to 152
F and added it to the mash, stirred, covered, and let sit for another
30 minutes.  Voila!  Conversion complete.


Since then, I've done two mashes with a 30-minute sugar rest at the 
initial thickness (approx. 1-1.33qts/lb, I measure by consistency),
then decrease thickness (to about 2qts/lb) and mash for another 30
minutes, then mash-off at 168F.  Of course, I use less sparge water, 
but my extract efficiency has gone up (slightly) with these last batches.


I figure that this method gives me the best of both worlds - a thick
mash for initial starch conversion and a thin mash for complete
starch conversion.  The down side is that I have to twiddle with the
mash to keep the temp within range, but I can live with that.


Blow-tube cleaning:


I find a carboy brush to very good for 1" OD tubes.  Also, it's probably a 
good idea to replace your plastic tubing every so often.


Plastic Cases:


Some of the cardboard cases for my beer bottle collection are becoming
"structurally unsound".  I'd like to replace them with plastic cases.
These are like milk crates, but with slots for 24 beer/soda bottles.
I've seen them in Europe but not in the States.  Any ideas?

  I've made a stout that has been called "Guinness-like, but smoother,

It had 1 lb. of roasted barley (about 10%), so I was surprised by it's 
lack of "bite" (I like that bite).  I mashed all the grains.  My theory is 
that the sparge filtered out most of the tannins from the rb.  Steeping the 
rb after the sparge would give back the "bite".  So, mash for the smoothness of

To clean 1" ID blowoff hose, I've had good luck by forcing
a plug of paper towel through the hose a few times:


Wet a piece of paper towel, and form it into a plug that fits

your faucet tap:  if you have a garden-hose adaptor on your
sink, the tube should fit snugly over it.  
Use one hand as a hose clamp (omit at your peril), while
turning on the hot water.  Let the pressure force the plug
through, scouring the goop off.  Repeat as necessary.


It's fast and seems to work for me.  I also have pushed the plug
in a couple of inches, and poured bleach into this space, before
putting the tube onto the faucet.  I don't know if this helped, though.

You are kidding right?


Just in case you're not, the above is not a 'fact'.  There are no
reputable studies that prove or even suggest that THC stays in your body
forever.  Hell, THC is so unstable it breaks down in hours.  There are
some non-psychoactive metabolates that will stick around for a week or
two, but that's it.  In fact, there is absolutely no proof of any
long-term effects from marijuana, even though most researchers believe
smoking is harmful. 


As consumers of an oft-maligned drug (alcohol), we should be very wary
when prohibitionists start making absurd claims about other drugs.

My experience is that a metal tun supported by blocks conducts the heat much
faster than a plastic tun, and, besides, floating the tun is a bit of a dubious
proposition anyway. A thermostat is largely superfluous as the total volume of
goods plus water jacket has such a high thermal inertia. Regarding boiling, use
the highest wattage element for which your wall socket is rated. A 3000W
element will boil 5 galls of cold water in around 1/2 hour. I don't really
understand the complaints about this method being slow, as few stove top
elements put out any more power. I also don't understand the complaints about
wort caramelising on the element, unless people are pouring undissolved extract
in there. (Mashing with the grain in contact with a naked element is another
matter).

Subject: Re : quality of extract varies wildly


One of the problems I have noticed with many extract brew pubs is that even
high gravity brews seem to taste thin and insubstantial. This had led me to
theorise that some of the problems of extract (apart from adulteration) are due
to overboiling during the condensation stage, ie, too much protein gets 
precipitated. It would be interesting to test whether diastatic malts, boiled
under vacuum at low temperatures, are liable to the same problems. Another 
possible implication is that powders may contain 'less' than syrups. It also
calls into question the advisability of homebrewers boiling the extract even
further. I made a series of mini brews in milk bottles last week, which 
basically involved pouring boiling water onto extract powder and hop pellets,
then fermenting. All cleared without a hitch (and had adequate bitterness,
incidentally). Maybe one sign of extract quality, contrary to some peoples'
notions, is the amount of trub which it liberates. Another yardstick, again
somewhat unintuitive, could be lightness of colour. That is, if your taste buds
suggest the darker colour is not due to use of roasted malts or caramel, then
it is possible that the extract has become oxidised, which generally means less
malt flavour.

   JimG has a diacetyl problem, and described his final gravity as 1.017,
which is high for medium-strength beers.  I think the FG may be an indication
of a weak ferment, caused by lack of oxygen.  Lack of O2 will also increase
diacetyl production (or is it decrease the amount of re-absorbtion of diacetyl
by the yeast).  Either way, the beer is buttery.  Solution: Aerate the cooled
unfermented wort better.


   Most all-grainers seem to add water to the grist.  I add grist to the
water.  Seems this way would allow better mixing, with less dry spots.  I
see very few (or no) clumps when I stir it up.


   Freezing beer to concentrate it will also concentrate the "bad" things,
such as fusel alcohols, which can be toxic.  My question is, what is the
difference between drinking a glass of concentrate, as opposed to drinking
the 6 beers it took to make that concentrate?

I have a question....... I've made four batches of homebrew so far and 
they all seem to have something in common -----> a slight off taste and
smell.  The taste and smell seem to be kinda "yeasty".  The smell is 
exactly the same but not as strong as when you leave a 1/2 inch of brew
on the bottom of the bottle and swirl it to mix it with the sediment.  
I am very frustrated in that not only it has this slight "off smell" but
it can taste very "home-made".  The thing is I use single stage 
fermentation with no blowoff tube.  I chill boiled water, add it to the 
fermenter, add the slightly cooled wort to the fermenter, and pitch the 
yeast (the temperature was within range for an ale or lager).  I put it
in the 7 gallon plastic fermenter and put an airlock on top.  Fermentation
usually starts within 24 hours and I let it sit in the same plastic
fermenter for approx. 10-12 days.  At that point I bottle.  I've tried 
ales and lagers (both were fermented in the basement - temp 62 deg F).  The
lager was the liquid California type and ales were rehydrated dry type.  Can
anyone see an obvious flaw in this procedure?  Can it be no blowoff tube?
No secondary?  Anyone have the same problems?  Any fixes?

 The vast majority of "hemp" is grown for its fiber and not the flowers.   
 From the growers' point of view, hops has the advantage of vegetative 
 propagation and a perenial growth habbit.  This means that one can stay in 
 the hops business forever without ever allowing pollination.  
 
 This is not true of pot.  If you do not allow some pollination, you get no 
 seeds and extinction is inevitable.  I believe most pot is harvested as soon 
 as the flowers open and I do not see pollination as an issue.  The female 
 plant is supposed to have more THC but as they must be planted from seeds, 
 there is no way of predicting the sex.  The male plant can be identified at 
 flowering time and a removed by growers interested in maximum potency but not 
 by those motivated by maximum tonnage.
