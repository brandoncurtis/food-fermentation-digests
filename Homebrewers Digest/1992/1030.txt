In HBD #1029 Richard King asks about closed fermentations:  


>[snip] I been using a 5 gallon glass carboy

Richard, I do all my fermentations  closed, in a 6 1/2 gal carboy.  If you
cannot get one of those, try splitting the batch between two 5 gal carboys.
When the primary fermentation activity abates, siphon the two 'splits' 
into a single 5 gal carboy and procede as normal.


Richard also asks:


>Also, the water naturally causes a

>(which, after all, tastes pretty darn good). I'd be glad to hear

Try siphoning the boiled and cooled water into the carboy.

Subject: Baker's yeast conclusions & Alabama brewing


      Thanks to all who responded to my query about baking yeast.  The
      responses generally said that the two yeast types (baking /
      brewing) were physically the same, but cultured to perform
      differently.  Some people said they had (or knew someone) tried to
      use a baking yeast.  The results varied on the Baking beer quality.
      From: bland, to no better or no worse than Brewer beer.


      One respondant wanted to know how to make sourdough starters!
      I guess I will give it a try (once I get enough milk jugs to break
      my experiment into parts).  Can anyone give me the name of a sour
      beer so that I can see if I _really_ want to do this. 
      Alternatively, if you have had a real sour beer, please describe
      it.  (The sour-est beer I have had is Guiness.  I guess you can use
      this as a benchmark.)


      Finally, I'm getting my father a brewkit for Christmas.  He lives
      in Huntsville, Alabama.  Can anyone tell me if there are brewstores
      in the city?  What's the closest, if none are in Huntsville.


      Thanks again

Subject: re:bigfoot alcohol content


Thanks to the person who posted the info on Sierra Nevada products.
The information looked acurate up to the Bigfoot entry:


Bigfoot Ale


alcohol content:  10.1% by weight
starting gravity:  23 plato (1.092)
ending gravity:  6 plato
yeast:  ale yeast
bittering hops:  nugget
finishing hops:  cascade
dry hops:  centennial and cascade
malts:  2-row barley malt, caramel malt


Either I'm missing something, or the strength of this
beer is not 10.1 by weight.  I get 8.77 by volume,
23-6 * .516 = alcohol by volume (very roughly). Maybe
this formula doesnt hold for high gravity??

I recently purchased a Cornelius keg system from an out of town homebrew

that this was a detergent used in the dairy business to clean vessels.


Can anyone tell me exactly what this stuff is?  It is bright pink powder
and the instructions say to mix it up at a rate of 2 ounces per gallon of
water. They also state that this solution is reusable.


Any information on this stuff would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: thomas hardy's ale


Roger Protz of CAMRA has a nice description of Thomas Hardy's Ale
in his "European Beer Almanac":


alcohol by volume:  12%
degrees plato:  31
original gravity:  1125


Ingredients:  Maris Otter pale ale malt and crystal malt.  Fuggles,
Goldings, and Styrian hops.  60-70 units of bitterness.  Top
fermenting yeast.


Tasting Notes.


Nose:  'Brisk as a volcano.' (quote from Hardy's "The Mayor of
Casterbridge.")


Palate:  'Full in body; piquant, yet without a twang; free from
streakiness.'


Comments:  Thomas Hardy wrote with evident enthusiasm about the
beer of 'Casterbridge' (Dorchester) in his Wessex novels.  Eldridge
Pope have repaid the compliment with their classic bottle-
conditioned beer named in his honor.  It was brewed first in 1968
to mark the 40th anniversary of the writer's death but interest and
demand has meant that it is now brewed on a regular basis.  It is
dry-hopped and warm-conditioned for 3 months and is pitched 3 times
with yeast, twice during fermentation and then during conditioning. 
It continues to condition in the small nip bottle and the brewery
recommends that it is laid down for 5 years.  A new vintage is
brewed annually and each bottle is individually numbered.  When
opened there is a rich sherry or Madeira note beneath the intense
peppery hop aroma.  It is a remarkable example of British craft
brewing.


Michael Jackson states that some vintages have been aged in sherry
wood.  He gives the beer 4 stars.

This used to be a big selling point for Olympia beer, and they promoted

more."  (Yeah, right..."it's the water, and that's about all.")


Anyway, I guess they figured that nobody knew what an Artesian well
was, therefore it must make their beer better.  (Sort of like "Cold
Filtering".)

Subject: More on dry hop anarchy


Thanks to all who replied on dry hop anarchy. So, there are two possible
effects when you dry hop:


First, the immediate liberation of CO2 due to nucleation. If you don't
want too much of a mess make sure you have enough head space in your
secondary so the froth doesn't invade your airlock. Or, if you like
to kepp the carboy topped off, rack to another carboy which contains
the hops.


Second, the re-awakening of dormant yeast. I'm not sure what causes
this, but I guess it depends on the amount of fermentables left in
the carboy when dry hops are introduced. Maybe the CO2 scrubs away
enough of the yeast-toxic higher alcohols so that the little buggers
wake up, who knows?

Subject: citrus flavor from hops




Are there any hop experts out there? I am trying to identify 
what type of hop can be used to impart a citrusy aroma and 
character to a brew. I have tasted this in several Northwest
micro-brews and I am curious what the brewers did to get this 
flavor.


My interest is not entirely academic. When I tasted my latest
brew, on the way from the primary to secondary, I was astonished
to note that a citrusy flavor dominated. I cannot identify for
sure where this came from, because I used 3 varieties and an 
ungodly amount of hops in the finish. The brew was intended to
be dubbed 'Hop Bag Ale'. I enjoy the variety of flavors that 
hops can provide, but this latest development was truly unexpected.


I have looked in all my brew books for the aromatic qualities of
various hops and cannot find 'citrusy' listed for any of them. If
any of you have run across this scrap of information in your beer 
travels, please tell. 


Thanks!

Subject: RE: Cold Break Process


In response to Brian Bliss' post in HBD #1025...


I have been using a technique for some time which combines whirling, settling,
and syphoning the cooled wort with a secondary settling after syphoning into
a temporary container (a plastic fermenter) for 2 to 4 hours (depending on
the recipe).  In other words, my process is:


1) cool the wort to near room temperature (I use a wort cooler which takes
        my boiled wort down to about 85F in about 45 minutes)
2) remove wort cooler and whirl wort (with a sterile, plastic oar of course)
3) let settle for about 30 minutes (covered in the boiling vat)
4) syphon into temporary container (sterile, closed plastic fermenter)
5) let settle for 2 to 4 hours (I do this in the same place and ambient
        temperature where the yeast starter is running - which is also where 
        the actual ferment will take place.  This I feel minimizes the 
        thermal shock to the starter when I pitch.)
6) syphon into primary fermenter (7 gallon glass carboy) and pitch started 
        yeast  


Perhaps this is overkill, but I have been concerned in the past
with the off flavors I seem to get when ANY significant amount of the trube
gets into my primary fermenter.  Of course, the beers in which this occurred
could have had some other cause at fault, but since I have been doing this
the problems I had attributed to trube in the primary seem to have gone away.


As you can see I have opted for a very thorough trube elimination process, but
the down side is I have a relatively long period (2 - 5 hours) between when 
the wort is cooled and when I pitch the yeast.  You see, I am also concerned
about disturbing the yeast by syphoning after it is pitched, so I don't pitch
until the cold break settling and final syphon into the primary is completed.
I rationalize this by doing a good job with starting the yeast, and I usually
see the end of the lag phase about 6 to 8 hours after I pitch.


Any comments or feedback on this method?  I have been brewing all grain
ales and lagers like this for about two years now, and I seem to get 
consistently good results, or at least my friends and I find the results
acceptable.  Still, if there is a good reason to change this - for example
I realize I may be optomizing the wrong part of the process - I'm interested
in suggestions.  I will be starting my favorite (and most familiar) Nut Brown
Ale recipe this weekend, so experimentation is likely...

I am using it to carbonate home-made soft drinks but it isn't carbonating

I believe that the variety of bittering hops used can have a dramatic
taste\flavour effect in the finished beer. I can personaly taste the 
differences in beers and often can identify the type of hop, some are
good some offencive.

Iodophors will be totally effect at 12.5 ppm with a two min. soak time.
No rinse is needed. I think that 12.5 ppm is 1oz\5gallons.

So I'm sitting here, contemplating working on that neverending thesis
project. But no! I have a better idea!


Enjoy.




The Redhook Ale Brewery
3400 Phinney Ave North
Seattle WA  98103
(206) 548-8000
They give tours at, what was it, 3pm? Every day. The sampling at the end of
the tour is quite reasonable, and they have a pub attached to the brewery,
so you can wait for the tour to start.


The tour in itself isn't too impressive, what you see is a state of the art
brewery imported straight from Germany. The labels on the machinery are
still in German. You can apparently operate 90% of everything from a single
control panel that looks like it ought to belong into a nuclear power
plant. Ya know, the kind Homer Simpson sits behind? They stress that their
process is not computer controlled, but hey, imagine being able to push a
button that says 'mash out'. :)

So I'm sitting here, contemplating working on that neverending thesis
project. But no! I have a better idea!


Enjoy.




#The Redhook Ale Brewery
#3400 Phinney Ave North
#Seattle WA  98103
#(206) 548-8000
They give tours at, what was it, 3pm? Every day. The sampling at the end of
the tour is quite reasonable, and they have a pub attached to the brewery,
so you can wait for the tour to start.


The tour in itself isn't too impressive, what you see is a state of the art
brewery imported straight from Germany. The labels on the machinery are
still in German. You can apparently operate 90% of everything from a single
control panel that looks like it ought to belong into a nuclear power
plant. Ya know, the kind Homer Simpson sits behind? They stress that their
process is not computer controlled, but hey, imagine being able to push a
button that says 'mash out'. :)

Subject: Recipe for smooth stout


Ok, for those that ask, here is the recipe for a Stout I made recently. 
This is the Stout that was drinkable at 1 week old. I believe several 
things make this smoothness possible; adding roasted grains to the mashout, 
keeping black patent malt quantities small, adding some calcium carbonate 
and adjusting sparge water ph.


Batch size=10 gals


21# Pale malt (GW)
2# Roasted Barley (added at mashout)
5# Black Patent (added at mashout)
10oz Chocolate malt (added at mashout)
2# Cara pils
2# British crystal malt (80l)
2t Gypsum (in mash)
1t non-iodized salt (in kettle)
2t calcium carbonate (in kettle)
14grams Whitbread dry yeast (rehydrate in 100f water for 15 min)


Hops -


2oz Perle (AA7.6)
1oz cascade (AA6.7)


Brewing details -


* Single temp infusion mash at 154f for 60min
* mashin with 7.8 gals water at 171f
* add specialty grains noted above and mashout at 170f for 10 mins
* sparge with 9 gals 168f water to collect 13 gals wort (sparge water 
  treated with lactic acid to ph 5.7)
* Boil 90 mins
* Boil Perle for 75 mins
* Boil Cascade for 60 mins
* Total IBU approx 40
* ferment at 68f for 1 week, rack to keg, CO2 to 2.6 volumes


OG = 1068  FG = 1023


Enjoy,

 First off, I think you're lucky you didn't have a 5-gallon beer
grenade go off in your kitchen.  Seems like a more reasonable solution
is get a 7 gal. acid jug, which is what I use for a primary fermenter.
Many HB shops sell them for about $20 and they take a no. 7 stopper.
This allows me to ferment the full 5.5 gal with a fermentation lock.
Only once, with a barleywine, did the krauisen head reach the airlock.

Subject: sparging 


Jack suggested:
> one could mash with 8 gallons of water and drain it all off.


which reminded me of a post from florian who said in #720:


- -------------------------------------
>From time to time, I read and note various techniques for settling the
mash and sparging.  The usual technique mentioned in the books involves
spraying or sprinkling 178 F water over the mash to sparge.  In former
times, I did this, but was always unhappy with the results, which were
cloudy finished beer.  In the last year, I have been using a different
technique suggested by my brother-in-law.  Its success in my case has
been born out by 20-30 batches of beer.  It is the following:




The mash is performed in a picnic cooler of the rectangular variety,
large enough to hold all of the mash and all of the sparge water.
After the mash is complete, I add all the sparge water at once, at the
temperature 178 F.  Then, I stir it to evenly distribute the grain
slurry throughout the water.  I then let it sit for a "long time", 
usually 1/2 to 1 hour.  When I can open the lid and see that the 
mixture appears clear on top, I begin to draw off wort from the tap
at the bottom of the picnic cooler.  This initial runoff (about 1-2 gallons)
is poured back into the top of the cooler, making damn sure that the
contents of the cooler are not violently disturbed.  After that, the
wort is allowed to run out at whatever rate it wants to into the boiler
pot.  I don't pay any attention to how fast it comes out.  My only
objective is to get it out.  As soon as I have half of it run out, I
begin to heat it on the stove, using a second pot to catch the second
half of the runoff.  By the time it is all run out, there is only
a little while left before the boil begins.  


This technique differs from the usual in that I don't use fresh
sparge water to rinse the "end" of the grains.  Noting once more that
my conversion efficiencies come out close to the theoretical values
and also that the clarity of my final beers has improved, I must 
conclude that this33/1399  technique is better.  It certainly makes mashing
more enjoyable for me, since I don't have to let the runoff go at some
attenuated rate in order to improve sparging efficiency.  Being an
impatient person, I hated that part anyway.


Explanation?  Perhaps the "long time" sitting in the coole allows the
water to fully dissolve the available sugars, so that longer runoff
times are not needed.  In any case, it sure works for me!


Florian
- -----------------------------------




Which all makes me think that it might work well to perform your
favorite kind of mash, drain off the first runnings, _then_ dump in all
of your sparge water, let it set for `a long time', then drain it off
as florian describes.


Just an idea, maybe I'll try it someday.

From: korz`at`iepubj.att.com
Subject: Phosphoric acid


I checked Noonan's "Brewing Lager Beer" again last night and my
memory did not fail me this time.  In the chapter on Sanititation,
he has sections on each type of equipment material (Stainless, glass,
wood, plastic, etc) and then on each type of sanitizer or cleaner
(chlorine bleach, sodium metabisulphite, sodium hydroxide, etc.)


Under "Glass and Glazed porcelain," he says you can use virtually any
cleaner and virtually any sanitizer, but specifically says not to
use Phosphoric acid.  He could have meant just for glazed porcelain,
but he was not specific.


Later, under "Phosphoric acid," he says specifically to not use it
on glazed porcelain, and did not mention glass.


Therefore, I guess based on this and all the posts by those more
knowledgable in chemistry than I, my fears were unwarranted.


I did know about hydrofluoric acid.  I know that before modern
plastic, they used to store it in quartz containers -- it was in
quartz bottles in my grammar school chem lab (we didn't get to
touch anything -- the teacher (Mrs. Rudner) did the experiments
at the "podium").


Thanks to all.

Well, Naneenanena-na.  We actually get Young's winter ale here in
Champaign, IL, and also Anchor's christmas ale (same as special ale?).
It only serves us right, since the only other beers on your list that
we get are Sam Smith WW, SN Celebration Ale (excellent, btw), and Coor's
Winterfest :-). (I'm envious)


To my palate, Anchor's christmas ale is spiced with cinnamon and
nutmeg, and possibly coriander.  per chance, I made a similar
tasting ale 2 months ago spiced with 4 tbsp coriander, 1 cinammon
stick, and peel from 1 fresh orange.  they taste quite similar, but
mine had 2 lb turbinado sugar in it and was fermented with Wyeast Belgian;
OG 1.085, FG 1.017 => anchor's pretty light by comparison.
(btw, no banana in this one)


Young's Winter Ale has that distinctive Young's lip-smacking sweet
diacetyl character to it, multiplied by 1000.  Some say it's oxidized
(I for one); my friend loves it.

sob. sob. sniff.  we don't get bigfoot, either.
Oh well, it could be worse.  Dad likes Paulaner hefeweizen, so when I
visited recently, I searched every liquor store in Galesburg and came
up empty.  "Sure, we have all the imports: Heineken, St. Pauli light & Dark,
Corona, and Mooshead, too!", I was told all too often.

You're a tigger, too?  I thought I was the only one.  hmmm...

A 1.020 starter may be best for your yeast, but it tastes watery
and should the starter get infected, you may not be able to discern
the off flavors from the yeasty taste (until you've pitched it (in the
fermenter, not the wastebasket)) A higher SG starter fermented out
longer may not be the best for your yeast, but at least you can detect
infection easier and pitch it (in the wastebacket, not the fermenter).


I throw out about a third of my wyeast starters...

try "uncompress" (opposite of "compress")

Try adding oak chips - for some reason, they seem to rouse a stuck ferment.
If you don't want the oak flavor, then boil & rinse them repeatedly before
adding to the fermenter.

I've come across an old carboy which is in good condition other for
an unidentified stain on the bottom.  I have tried everything short
of nitric acid to remove it, with no success. Is this thing safe to
brew in, or should I make a terrarium out of it?  Any other ideas about
removing the mysterious deposits?
