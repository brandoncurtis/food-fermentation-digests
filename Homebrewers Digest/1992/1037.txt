Subject: Hypercard ideas for the Mac


Hi everyone,


I was looking through the archive at sumex-aim [Macintosh archive] and 
I found a couple of items that may be useful for homebrewers using a Mac.
I found a 2 hypercard stacks, one is a record book and the other is 
a stack designed for yeast research. I tried the record book and it seems
to work pretty good, there is also a calculator for converting SG to % alc.
which takes temperature into consideration. I have not tried the yeast
research aid. They can both be found at the following locations using
anonymous FTP.

        112265 Sep  3 19:01 yeast-research-aid-12.hqx


I did not write them...I just thought others might be interested in them.
I am still looking for a recipe formulator for the Mac, but , I have had
no luck. Does anyone know of one?


Can someone tell me how to submit something for the HBD archive.


Cheers.....Carlo

Subject: starch and iodine




Much of the starch stored in the grains is insoluble.  This is converted to
soluble starch, and then to complex sugars, and finally to simple sugars.
The starches that remain insoluble at the end of the mash are the things you
try to get rid of by sparging through a filter bed, and racking of the trub.
The starch you want to test for with iodine is the soluble starch, since this
is what is converted to sugars.

In HBD #1035 Jed (parsons1`at`husc.harvard.edu) writes:


"Recently, I gave some homebrew to a professor of mine who is eager to try it, 
but told me that her daughter had heard of some case in California where seven 
people had suffered paralysis because they drank someone's. . . homebrew. . . .  
they weren't cured of this until some smart person injected fetal tissue into 
their brains!"


        Well this story does have some basis in reality, but the daughter got 
certain parts of it wrong.  According to NPR's "All Things Considered" broadcast 
11/25/92 (sorry, I can't find a print source) several people in California ended 
up with severe Parkinson's symptoms after consuming a poorly synthesized batch 
of the drug Ecstasy (is it MDMA?).  Some did show strong improvements after 
fetal tissue was injected into their brains, much more than regular Parkinson's 
sufferers.  So I'm just planning to stay away from such home chemistry 
experiments and let my yeast do my work for me.  
        I'd read her the section out of Papazian's book where he emphasizes that 
no pathogens can grow in beer.  Short of using a lead counterflow chiller, I 
can't see how you could get anything worse than a hangover from homebrew.  
Though I remember one hangover where I *felt* paralyzed the next morning. :^)

Subject: yeast respiration


I just read in "Yeast, a practical approach" that S. cerevisiae cannot
metabolize oxidatively sugars at a concentration above 1%. This
concentration corresponds to a gravity of only 1.010, and thus makes me
wonder about the recommendation to use a starter at S.G. 1.020.


If it's going to ferment anyway, what's the point of a medium-low
gravity? Will the yeast switch to respiration after having fermented
half the sugar, and if so isn't an airlock self-defeating? Any comments
by yeast experts?


(Incidentally, the book is lousy. Terribly edited, not proof-read,
inadequate methods descriptions.)

Steve Dresler (a brewer at SN) said to brew it in this manner:

10# 2-row
1 1/2# caramel malt (I'll use 60L)
1 oz Chinook 60 min
3/4 oz Cascade 30 min
1 1/4 oz Cascade 2 min


Run chilled wort through an additional 1/2 oz Cascades. (!)


Rack fermented beer onto 1 2/3 oz Cascade hops for aging (2 weeks).


Sounds good, let's brew it!

I think we have three options, the third being draining *while* adding
water (i.e. adding water at the same rate as it's draining so that the
grain is always submerged (till you're done adding water).


Russ-- could you elaborate on why the acidity of the sparge would differ in
the different methods?

      I'm looking for information on several topics.  The first is
the recirculating infusion mashing system (RIMS) in the last special
issue of Zymurgy and I am thinking of building one.  :-\  Has anyone out
there built, used or seen one?  Also, I purchased the counter-pressure
filler from Fox and it works terribly.  :-c  How well do the others work?
(ie. Melvico and Benjamin Machine Products)  And, I've kegged beer
several times and I can't seem to get them to carbonate naturally and
have to force carbonate them.  Although they taste fine, why won't
they carbonate naturally?  :-t  
        Finally, how did Schlitz win a gold medal? :-`at`


I would appreciate opinions, advice and comments.  In lieu of that, 
beer will suffice.  %*) Thanks.

Subject: AHA


I have received a lot of private e-mail from people who have told me of
horror stories about how the AHA has ignored their submissions to Zymurgy,
or in other cases outright rejected them. What really frosts me off is that
most of this e-mail came from people I admire, and who bring a lot to the 
table in terms of experience and insights. I always thought that the lack
of diversity and less than ideal technical content was due to a shortage
of submissions. This is definitely not the case. There are enough homebrewers
out there with interesting material and unique experiences to keep Zymurgy
loaded with good stuff for the forseeable future. I am truely astonished and
dismayed that the AHA has not made use of this diversity and wealth of talent.
For what it is worth, I am going to complain loudly to anyone in that
organization who will listen to me about this. This policy makes absolutely
no sense, either for Zymurgy or for those of us who subscribe to it.

Umm, what concentration of this fragrant stuff is required to do the
trick?


Why, you learn about new sanitizers every day here on HBD!  Gummit,
I'm going to have to go out and buy a textbook to stay out in front
of the pack.  :-)


Now, the drawback of peracetic acid is that it will cost you something
like $100 for 3/4 lb.  And, of course, it can't be shipped by UPS.

Potassium sorbate. Also used in children's toothpaste, cheep sweet wine.
Once you get acclimated to it, you can taste it lots of things.


I was once given a sample of "Canadian Spring water" in a grocery store,
"naturally sweetened with fruit juice", the lady said as I supped.
YUK! -- *big* Potassium Sorbate - at least 1000 ppm.
The taste stayed on my palate for a full hour.

Subject: First tangle with the meadasaurus


I put a batch of basic mead into the primary 14 days ago.  This consists of 1
gallon of boiled honey, yeast nutrient, acid blend, finings, topped up to 5
gallons.  I pitched 1 package of wine yeast (rehydrated - no starter), attached
the fermentation lock, waited expectantly.  It took 6 days to start bubbling at
the lock, but it's still going strong now.  I'm worried by 2 things.  First is
the smell of rotten eggs, which I've never gotten with fermenting beers.
Is this typical of wine yeast, or fermenting honey, or is something other than
the intended micros thriving in there?  The second worry (I know I'm not
supposed to worry - but since I've already run afoul...) is the extended time
in the primary.  Assuming this stuff has a long way to go, am I risking
off-flavors, etc. by leaving it in there on the trub?  Should I rack to a
secondary?  I don't want the fermentation to stick.  The temp in my
Pennsylvania basement is about 63 degrees.  About how long will mead take to
ferment out at this temp.?  What can I do in case of stuck ferment, or just to
make sure the honey ferments out all the way - add new yeast at racking time? 
I want this batch to be as dry as possible.   Any help from you mead masters
would be wonderful.  If anyone would like to discuss mead, contact me.
