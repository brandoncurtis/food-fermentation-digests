I wouln'd normally respond to this since it further decreases the signal to
noise ratio here, but since it's Xmas, and we've got short digest anyway,
and... well I just know that if I point it out others won't waste bandwidth
*grin*....

Hiya, Jack, old buddy... I still have that video, and... now living in
Portland, am showing it to a whole new breed of (would be) brewers. ;)


What happened here is that most likely Todd replied to Richard's (can I
call him Dick? Rich? Rick?) submission in 2 ways: a reply to Richard
directly, and a cc: to the digest, or vice versa. In any case, direct
internet mail takes about 10 seconds to 10 minutes in any normal situation,
so Richard got the reply, and was able to respond with another cc: to the
digest in less than the 24 hour period that mail gets queued... (As a
matter of fact, there's almost 6 hours difference between the two
submissions, taking EST and PST into consideration) In any case, much like
I'm doing to you right now. You'll see this later on today, bright and
early, under the Xmas tree, while everyone else will get it stamped '26
Dec' and if they're lucky 'nuff to have home net access or cursed enough to
have to work, read it on Saturday morning. ;)


I'd like to take this chance to say (since I'm wasting bandwidth
already)... Hope you are having/had a good one, and you're truly a fun
bunch to listen to every day. :)


Mike

Subject: % alcohol by weight vs. by volume


Ok, I've had my silly post in the digest today, this one's serious. I know
some chemist out there has the answer at the tip of his/her CRC, but I
haven't got one around here.


How do I compute %alcohol by weigh in terms of %alcohol by volume. I know
it is a function of what type of beer I'm talking about, doppelbock being
usually much denser than others, but hey, the figure of %alcohol in water
would be just fine for an approximation.


Salvator (in OR) is 6% by weight. 1- does the percentage change state to
state? 2- what is that by volume?

       John:
      
       My e-mail to you is bouncing. I just heard that they
       may start brewing Fix beer again in Greece. Potential
       embarassment may be on its way. Get in touch when you 
       have time.

 >Jack-- you should gauge your feelings about styles more by Goose Island's
 brews -- they are much better examples of the style.
 
 I already did that and was summarily flamed by, er... ah... for posting my 
 opinions.  
 
 > Carbonation in the fermenter is usually a sign of too much back-pressure in 
 the airlock. .....   If it has, just unclog and let the beer de-gas before 
 priming and bottling.
 
 I seem to always be on the wrong side of the curve.  Several weeks ago, it 
 occured to me that if I put more water in my fermentation lock, it would give 
 me a head start on carbonation at kegging time.  I use the long, S-shaped 
 glass ones on the secondary and although I have no way of measuring the 
 pressure of a three inch colmun of water, there is enough CO2 in the beer to 
 make it plesantly drinkable.
 
 Baderbrau does their entire secondary fermentation under pressure and I 
 presume many brewers do the same.  I therefore concluded that the only reason 
 homebrewers do not do it was because of the problems of glass fermenters.
 
 >P.S.  You won't hear from me for a few weeks -- I'm not boycotting the HBD,
 I'm just on honeymoon Part 2.  See ya!
 
 That's too bad because I was planning on bringing a collection of samples of 
 WGB to the next meeting of CBS.  You may wish to re-schedule your honeymoon 
 to avoid missing such an historical opportunity.

 Has the video create a cult out there yet?  Most groups get together
 and dress real funny, shout out the lines on que, and pour a glass
 of homebrew over their heads at each SANFU.  The real sign of an
 ARF groupy is to know them ALL.  There are even a few words purposly 
 mispelled in the subtitles just to make it fun.
 
 >What happened here is that most likely Todd replied to Richard's (can I

 This has been a bad year for my conspiracies theories.  Seems pretty
 simple but I was just having fun anyway and as you see, I learn fast.

 Relax, don't worry..... use a MALTMILL and have a nice holiday.

Reading all these indignant opinions reminds me of the time Ken
Pavechevich, the maker of Baderbrau, came to talk with my homebrewing
club last spring. We shouldn't forget that in general the megabrewers
are even slimier than Jim Koch is. Ken told us stories of the
not-so-licit tactics employed by Miller, in attempting to hamper his
success in the market. Among other things, he heard reports from bar
owners that [thugs] from Miller had offered free kegs if they dropped
Baderbrau! He also told an iffier story about Miller trucks blocking
the way of one of his trucks, making him seem unreliable to his
customers. . . . I don't know if the megas are this nasty to all
micros: Baderbrau in particular comes in packages that might be more
appealing to your average Beer Drinker. (The labels are shiny, without
a lot of words, and the name even sounds vaguely like a cheap American
beer. I don't think the word `pilsener' even appears.) (I'm only
reporting Ken's `rumors' because they're hearsay, hence legally
useless, right?)


Anyway, I can imagine what a hard time the BBC is having holding what
ever ground they've gained in spite of the megabreweries' megastoopid
marketing techniques (that work! -- pitiful) and other slimy,
anything-for-a-profit-so-long-as-you're-SURE-we-won't-get-caught
methods. With this in mind, I do (when in a good mood) have a quantum
(not more) of sympathy for Jim Koch. Sam Adams beers are a major force
in the current American Beer Enlightenment. In this day and age, Koch
would not have been as successful as he is without using pushy,
sleazeball Big Business strategies. If Koch is getting a cozy sandwich
feeling between the megas and the micros, he might as well focus his
efforts below as well as above, no matter how meek the offending
microbrewery might be. Any good capitalist (in the narrow sense of
`effective') would tell you that. (Whether the Boston Beer Works is
actually a threat to the Boston Beer Company is very questionable.)


Before everyone jumps on me, I should point out that I'm happy to
boycott the BBC along with every other Big Business I comfortably can!
Sam Adams doesn't even taste that great anyway, except on tap.


Well, I hope everyone got lots of presents. I'm going to go read my
new copy of Michael Jackson's _New World of Beer_.


Cheers,
Jake.

I'm considering the construction of a mash tun with a false bottom. If I go with a metal screen, what is the preferred hole size or mesh # ?

Hi JS,


I am very interested in such a home brew forum as I saw you mention in the
news groups on usenet.  Please send me info on such a net on the air or
on the computer.  I would really appreciate it.


I also work at HP.  I am in ICBD at Corvallis.  I do all my hobby stuff 
such as this from home via OSU.  Please email me a response as I rarely have time to read the news groups.


Thanks a bunch!
