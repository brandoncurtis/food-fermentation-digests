There was a thread a while ago in the digest about 21-year-old beer.
I missed the start of it.  Is this a reference to "Majority Ale" as
described in Old British Beers and How to Make Them?


What an extravagance--20 lbs or so of grain for about 2 US gallons
of brew (once the recipe is resized).


I just found some more Thomas Hardy's Ale Vintage Sampler Packs. 
Even better, they are last year's!  That 1989 Thomas Hardy is pretty
good stuff ....

Amen, Ed! Yes, Richard, we all know how to use a phone book. When people
ask about places to visit in a city not their own, they are looking for
recommendations from locals, not listings of places out of the yellow
pages. What good are they? And what is that crap about people "having to"
respond? You certainly don't. In fact, I don't WANT a bunch of addresses
of places you don't know about. I want *recommendations* and *warnings*
of places you *do* know about. Just give a couple of names. When I get
there I'll use THE PHONE BOOK to get the numbers and addresses.


As for the queries and responses taking up too much of the digests...
Well, there a lot of other things I'd like to read about less than
discussions of brewpubs in Denver or Dallas or wherever:


lawsuits
lawyers
boycotts
trademarks
product marketing
the *business* of brewing
fine details of organic chemistry
autoclaves
 ...


Why are we picking and arguing like a bunch of old ladies about pub
recommendations when this kind of stuff goes on ad nauseum? Clearly,
this is no longer my forum, and I'm outta here. Call me if you guys
get to be fun to drink with again. I'm much more likely to visit a
brewpub than countersue Boston Beer, brew hectolitre batches, culture
yeast, or autoclave *anything*. Not that these aren't noble pursuits,
but I *have* a life *and* a career, and I don't need another. Thanks
for all the good info. It's been fun, mostly.


Are we lawyers? Are we protecting trademarks? Are we busting monopolies?
Are we professional chemists and microbiologists? Are we professional
brewers? I thought this forum was for HOME brewers and BEER enthusiasts.


How many recipes have been in the last 10 digests? 1? 2? Is anybody
brewing out there? I'm tempted to start my own digest. What'll I call
it? How about the HOME-BREWERS-WHO-DON'T-TAKE-THEMSELVES-TOO-SERIOUSLY
digest? That should keep it under 32K!


Happy New Year! I'll drink a beer for you guys!


Rob


P.S. Send those flames via e-mail. I'm dropping this puppy right NOW!
     (Richard: Please note that you don't HAVE TO flame me. It's
      just a suggestion. The phone book won't be needed, either.)

Are there any permanent effects to beer that has been frozen and thawed?

The impact of a 3" column of water on pressure is negligible. One
atmosphere (14.7 psi) is a column of water ~33 feet high (Torricelli
]discovered[ atmospheric pressure when he tried to pump water higher than
this in one stage), so you increased the pressure by .0076 atmosphere or
 .11 psi. Compare this with reports of (I recall) 15-30 psi for carbonation
in kegs. I doubt it takes this much to \keep/ carbonation in a keg
or bottle---does anyone around here know enough about CO2 solubility vs
temperature to estimate what [partial] pressure is necessary to keep, e.g.,
2 volumes of CO2 dissolved in beer at room temperature?.


This doesn't mean your beer didn't carbonate; it's a lot harder to mistake
carbonation than it is to mistake low levels of alcohol. But, as several
msgs have pointed out, only the excess CO2 over what dissolves comes out
the fermentation lock, so all but the greenest wort has some dissolved CO2
in it; the additional effect of your .11 psi vs a typical (guestimate)
 .03-.05 psi can't be much.
