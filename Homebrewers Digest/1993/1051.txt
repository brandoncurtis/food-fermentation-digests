Subject: Stuck fermentation?


I am a new homebrewer working on my first batch. I used 3.25 lbs of Edme
Bitter Hopped Malt Extract and 3 lbs of Laaglander Amber DME for 5 gallons.
I started the yeast (1 package Edme Ale Yeast) in one cup of water boiled
with 2 Tablespoons DME, at 80 degrees. 1 oz of Fuggles pellets were boiled
for 30 minutes, 2/3 oz of Hollertau for 10 minutes, and 1/3 oz Hollertau
for 5 minutes. The yeast was pitched at 90 degrees (is this too high? -- I
followed the online beginners guide from Rob Gardner, but have since read
that pitching should occur closer to 75-80 degrees).


A fermentation lock was placed on the primary (bucket) and the fermentation
begun in a 62 degree room. The OG was measured as 1.048. Bubbling began
within 5 hours and was vigorous the following day. My concern is that on
the second day the bubbling in the fermentation lock has completely
stopped. This seems too soon. Bubbling fermentation only occurred for 36
hours. As the bubbling had stopped, I opened the primary and measured a SG
of 1.022. This seems too high. My question is: what should I do now? Should
I rack to the secondary and wait for fermentation to restart? Is this the
fault of the Laaglander DME, which is apparently notorious for high TG's?
Do I need to add yeast nutrient? Do I need to add more yeast? Should I rack
to secondary and then bottle after a week? How will this high TG affect the
taste of the final product?


Thanks in advance for any advice.

Hi All,


  In HBD #1050, James Smith writes:

  Not such a dumb question, I think it's just that James has a much
different setup than mine.  I use soda kegs, not 1/2 barrels, and I
don't have taps installed in the fridge as he does.  I keep about
12-15 psi on the kegs as a "maintainence pressure".  When not in use,
I don't leave the hose barbs connected to the keg.  Both the gas "IN"
and liquid "OUT" fittings on soda kegs have a check valve in them, which
is closed when the hose barbs are removed, keeping the keg sealed. If
the hose barbs are left on, the check valve is open, and the only remaining
seal is between the small rubber gasket on the fitting and the inside of
the hose barb.  IMHO, this is a primary candidate for both gas and
(shudder) liquid leaks, not to mention the wear and tear on the valve
spring from keeping it compressed continually.

Subject: CO2 pressure


   Someone asked this before, and I don't remember seeing an answer,
so here it is again.  After beer has been carbonated in a keg, say to
2 volumes (or something like 20 lbs. at 50 degF), what pressure should
be kept in the keg to retain that level of carbonation all the way to
the last pint?  (the last pint being quaffed a couple/few weeks later,
and assuming no change in temperature)

Many HBD's ago, Jack S. described a wonderful-sounding contraption
called a "cold plate", I think.  I have the impression that the thing
is some sort of in-line rapid-chilling device that chills beer from
a room-temperature pressurized keg on the way to the glass.  Is that
correct?  If so, can these things be bought for not much money (i.e.,
less than the cost of a spare fridge to keep the kegs in)?

Subject: Cops are after you from Micah Millspaw


About this search for the still. This greatly concerns me, many times I
have had people who know that I homebrew, ask if I have a still
(with which I make the beer) I say no. When people come over and ask 
if they can see my brewing equipment, they look at it and say, so this is
the still. This line of questioning bothers me a great deal and I often
make efforts to explain. The problem is, that per BATF regs (a vestige
from the Volstead Act) it is not legal to possess a still (in the USA)
for any reason or use.(it is possible to obtain a permit from the BATF
but this requires a bond and so on) In the USA the possession of a still
can result in forfiture of the property that the still was found on as 
well as other punishment. The Volstead Act was the enforcement aspect
of Prohibition. The precedents set by this Act are the basis for the 
narcotics seizure and property forfiture laws. Start looking at the
BATF regulations and you will start to wonder if prohibition was actualy
repealed. 
 The rubb is that homebrewing equipment is basically the same
as the larger part of the stuff need to distill. It will most likely
be proven in court that the homebrewing equipment could be used for
illegal distillation wither it was or not. Be concerned this could happen
to you. Also discourage people from going around saying so and so has
a still and he makes beer. Because some, over zealous cop will break down
your door and arrest you and your will have to get a lawyer to prove
(at your expense) that you are innocent, if possible. It could be proven,
by an expert of course, that your homebrewing equipment is in fact 
potential distilling equipment and then what do you do, say yes it could
be used for that, but I didn't do it. Remember if your innocent can't
be convicted.
 It seems that many people beleive that brewing and distillation 
are the same. All that it could take is for someone to say that so and so
has a still (which you don't) and next thing you know the police are 
breaking down the door. Most are ignorant of the laws concerning the 
production of alcoholic beverages. I've encountered people who make their
own wine and brandy (making brandy is illegal) but were shocked at my
making beer because they were certain that homebrewing is illegal. These
same individuals later told me that it was legal for ethnic Portuguese only
to make their own brandy in California (and they actually beleive this).
 I've even had the pleasure of being grilled by the FBI over my
homebrewing. The FBI agent asked if I knew that I had admitted to commi-
ting an illegal act by naming homebrewing as one of my hobbies. There was 
also concern that if I was making beer that I was probably making other 
drugs as well. Make beer and your in bad company. They also annoyed my 
neighbors about this as well, which did little to improve my standing in 
the area. Also there is an article in the latest issue of American 
Brewer that tells of the state of Georgias efforts to stamp out homebrewing
by busting home beer and wine making shops for selling illegal parphen-
alia, such as yeast.
 I guess that the point that I am trying to get across is that this
could happen to any homebrewer. And that educating the public, ie.. friends,
neighbors,etc...,is the only way to prevent such an incident. Misinformation
can be very hazardous to you.

Subject: Lab Grade >= Food Grade ?


My biology teacher buddy just acquired an unused 5-gallon container which we
think might be useful somewhere in the brewing process.  It's a heavy-duty
opaque plastic "jug" with a screw-on lid about 6" diameter, with a spigot
near the bottom.  My friend believes that, since this vessel was intended for
lab experiments, the plastic is inert and free from bad chemicals, since
these might ruin the data.  He says it's "Lab Grade".  I have 2 questions:


Do any of you scientists out there know how a "lab grade" container
compares with "food grade"?  Would it be OK to consume beer that has come in
contact with a lab grade container, assuming it was clean to begin with?


Also, since the spigot is about 1.5" from the bottom of the container, I
thought it would make an ideal vessel for secondary fermentation, since we
could tap the beer right off the trub into bottles.  Also, if we left the
screw-on cap in place, we might be able to use it to carbonate or maybe lager
a batch in the fridge.  Any ideas about this?

First of all, you need to get the beer cold before you agitate it,
and secondly, do not disconnect the pressure lines before agitation-
the beer will absord the CO2 in the headspace and more is needed
from the tank after agitation begins.  How much pressure you need
depends upon how cold the beer is-you need less when it is colder.

Many people, and yours truly is as guilty as they come, detect astringency
very easily, and then consciously or unconsciously consider it a flaw. It
has been reported that overconcentration of one's brewing activities on
Viennese style beers can do this to one's palate! Nevertheless, as Martin's
comments suggest, with Lambik these issues are far more subtle. By the way,
I did fly the term "Herbstoffe" by some language experts and they noted that
the translation "grain astringent" was correct but incomplete. This term
also conveys a "unpleasant" feature as well. Thus, if "common use" rules
are used, then astringent tones like those cited above should not be
cited as examples of "Herbstoffe". Great point Martin. C.R. Saikley's
comments in HBD#1049 were, as always, dead on target as well.




I have also received some really witty e-mail from members of the Spider
Appreciation Society. They correctly point out, as did C.R. and Martin, that
spiders provide protection against fruit flies and other bugs. They also
make the excellent point that this is natural protection and does not involve
chemical cleaners, etc. Anyone with even the slightest social conscious will
be sensitive to and applaud that point. Nevertheless and alas, I remain a
hopelessly unreconstructed reactionary on this point, and if given a vote, it
would go toward removal of the cob webs. Perhaps this is related to the severe
emotional trama received upon walking into a room with an open fermenter in high
kraeusen, and with everything (including the sides of the fermenter) being
adorned with cob webs. Surely there is a better way to go. One that is natural,
yet one that is less stressful to those who worry about what it is that spiders
do after lunch.

Subject: KETTLE MASHING


 
 
 
                 KETTLE MASHING,   Part 2
 
 The following procedure is intended only as a starting point 
 that I know works well enough to assure a successful, first, 
 all-grain experience.  I do not want to get into endless 
 discussions about the pros and cons of the procedure at this 
 time nor do I even claim that I brew beer this way.  There 
 are an infinite number of variations that could be fodder 
 for future articles but the object of this one is to 
 introduce the approach and brew a simple batch of all grain 
 beer.
 
                      MASHING
 
 The first step is to dump 8 lbs of crushed pale malt into 
 the kettle.  Don't forget the screen!  Add 3 gallons of warm 
 tap water and mix thoroughly.
 
 Apply heat and raise temp to 155F.  Stir frequently to avoid 
 caramelizing and to distribute the heat.  Hold this temp for 
 30 minutes by adding heat and stirring as necessary.
 
 After 30 mins at 155F, crank up the heat and continue 
 stirring until 178F is reached.  This step is known as 
 "mashout" and is difficult or impossible to do with the 
 plastic bucket approach.  It is my opinion that it 
 eliminates one source of a common problem with first all 
 grain batches known as a "set mash.
 
 Hold this temp for 10 minsutes, then turn off the heat and 
 let it rest while heating water to a boil on another burner.  
 Use a pan that holds at least two quarts of water.
 
                     SPARGING
 
 The level of wort in the kettle should be about an inch 
 above the grain when it settles.   Lay a small bowl on top 
 of the grain to distribute the sparging water and minimize 
 the disturbance of the grain.
 
 Open the spigot just a trickle and run the wort into a cup 
 until it runs clear.  Pour the turbid runoff back into the 
 kettle.   With this setup, it will run clear after a few 
 ounces.  Again, as comparison, it sometimes takes gallons 
 with the other system and this must be recycled back into 
 the mash till it does run clear.
 
 The object of sparging is to extract as much sugar from the 
 grain as possible.  The longer it takes, the more efficient 
 the extraction.  Adjust the outflow so that it takes at lest 
 10 mins to fill a gallon jug.  Pour the boiling water into 
 the bowl as available or necessary to keep about an inch of 
 water over the grain.  The availability of boiling water 
 will probably be the limiting factor on sparge rate.
 
 Most brewers will tell you that the sparge water should not 
 exceed 170F but if you use boiling water in this system, the 
 average temp will be far below 170F and you will be lucky to 
 keep it above 150F.  You can fiddle on your next batch.  
 Trust my on the first.
 
 The first runoff should be about 1.080 and you quit when it 
 gets below 1.010.  The total blend will produce 6 to 7 
 gallons at about 1.035 which, after boiling will yield 5 to 
 6 gals at 1.040.  Collect the wort in gallon jugs or five 
 gallon plastic buckets (can't get away from them).

From: Richard Childers <rchilder`at`us.oracle.com>
Subject: Re:  COPS, homebrewing, and the WOD




Regarding the recent thread about the busted homebrewer, I see three
possibilities ... in order of likelihood :


        (1)        The cops were using the home brewing equipment in bad
                faith, since they knew he wasn't running a still but
                knew that the judge wouldn't know that and that the
                situation could be safely misrepresented, to get the
                warrant to bust him for marijuana cultivation - which,
                as others have noted, is far more a service to his
                community ... like homebrewing, it is being independent
                and productive and creative and nurturing - than a
                threat or anything that might damage the commonwealth
                that the COPS allege to represent.


        (2)        The cops were as stupid as the judge, and misled by the
                informant, who had a grudge, or a bias against marijuana.


        (3)        The guy was genuinely running a still ... which does not,
                prima facia, seem to be the case, although, off hand, I'm
                not sure it would be possible to prove this, since the
                equipment needed for both is essentially identical, and a
                wort cooler could probably be used as a distillation coil.
                This means this could happen to _any_ of us, and anything
                you have that is illegal on the premises will be used to
                justify their action - anything. Unregistered gun, for
                example, they could and probably would parley it into a
                federal case if they could, before they'd admit that they
                had made a mistake and owed you compensation / apologies.


                Personally, I don't see the difference between brewing
                beer, wine, and other alcohol so long as you are neither
                selling it nor creating a threat to the wellbeing of your
                neighbors.


                What this sort of implies is that if they're going to
                break down your door when you're _not_ distilling, and
                try to make it look like you are ... you may as well,
                anyway.


I think the circumstances suggest that marijuana was the target and home-
 -brewing was used to justify it, no thought given to the thousands of well-
 -meaning and generally law-abiding homebrewers. This is consistent with
War On Some Drugs thinking. How do y'all like it when it returns to roost ?

voice your opinion in defense of homebrewed beer, a subject near and
dear to most of our hearts.  I figure that that many of us (including
myself) do not watch shows such as COPs, however the rumblings heard
here weren't as bad as my personal rumbling when I read the
transcription of the segment sent to me by Rick Hapanowicz (after he
reviewed the video he mentioned here on Tuesday).  As discussed earlier
the show COPS broadcast an episode where they allegedly
arrested a man for distilling liquor, while in actuality all
they showed was homebrewing kegs, immersion chillers, being
confiscated and referred to these as illegal equipment.  The show
was so disturbing  to me personally that I have written a letter
to both the local Fox station and the producers of the COPS show,
and would like to very strongly encourage you to get as many
letters sent as possible from your own contacts.  I have already sent
out mail to club contacts throughout the country, which includes the
transcript of the show segment detailing what I personally feel are 
misrepresentations in the show.  I am willing to send this transcript to
anyone who wishes it, to encourage you to voice your opinion to your
local fox affiliates, and to the COPs producers at the address I have
given below. 
        A small number of brewers here have been apathetic about
the negative exposure, saying that the people who watch a show of
this nature aren't worth trying to educate.  I would like to
point out that this may not seem so trivial as some ignorant
neighbor results in your arrest and the confiscation of your
brewing equipment.
        So if each of you could take some time to vioce support for
homebrewing I feel it would be to the benefit of all involved.  I feel
this is one point most all of us should agree on, and hope we can make
our voice well heard.  If anyone would like a copy of the transcript, or
the letters I sent to COPs, and the local affiliate, I would be happy to
forward them in hopes that this would induce more response from
homebrewers around the country.  Thanks in advance for your efforts

Subject: Maibock Recipe






Fellow brewers...Just wanted to know if anyone has or has seen a recipe
for a brew similar to EKU Kulmbacher Maibock? This is my favorite brew but
it is 1) expensive 2) hard to find (if at all)..Currently, I am only a
lowly extract brewer but if my only choice is a grain recipe, it my be
enough encouragement to give it a shot. Thank you!

This is an excellent point.  Even though one may have had success in 
the past relying on tap water, there is no guarantee that the tap 
itself has not become contaminated by some food particle or other vector.

This is another good point.  You can, however, buy charcoal filters 
that are impregnated with silver, which acts as a bacteriostat.  These 
will eventually grow bacteria when they get near their usage limits.
