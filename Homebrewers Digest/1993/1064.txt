 This is probably not (maybe?) related to yeast but it is a good segue anyway.
 
 This past Sunday, I took a customer to lunch at the Goose and we did their 
 sample program.  All the beers were interesting and worth the taste.  
 However, the barlywine was absolutely vile.  My guest says this is what 
 barleywine tastes like and I politely dissented but did not argue.  The 
 customer is not always right but there is little to be gained by arguing with 
 one.
 
 I am not sure of the correct nomenclature but it tasted like the 
 screenprinting ink I use smells.  Back in the days before I cultured yeast, I 
 had made beer with that taste, more than once.   I recognize it as a defect 
 and not just something unique to barleywine because I never have made 
 barleywine.  
 
 Anybody have barleywine at the Goose lately?

John Isenhour asks about the bright yellow choose-a-mug beer survey.  I can
report that one arrived at our house last week, and that we took a similar
tack in answering it (i.e. listing "most often" brands of some obscurity
rather than Xing the mug of some megasuds).  However, I can't help anyone
figure out where the names came from; though I've got my name on several
beer related lists, the survey came addressed to my wife, who is on no such
thing.  Of course, we queered the results by making her name answer to my
habits, but that's a risk you take when you just mail out your surveys.  I
should add that they promised a "free mystery gift" for completing the
survey - the bait did its trick, as I would never have bothered with it if
there weren't something in it for me.  I just hope this isn't something to
help research Zima ClearMalt, or something equally horrifying; I expect my
mystery gift will be a voucher for a beverage I'd rather not have, in any
case.  Anyone else?

From: gjfix`at`utamat (George J Fix)
Subject: Nitrosamines


The work that first showed that nitrosamine is a potential carcinogen is
summarized in the following:


     Environmental Aspects of N-nitroso Compounds, Proceedings of a
     Working Conference held at the NE Center for Continuing Education,
     Univ. of New Hampshire, 22-24 Aug. 1977, IARC Publ. No. 19 (1978)


Following this report, a technical committee was formed and headed by
Dr. W.A. Harwick of Anheuser-Busch, Inc. This lead to various procedures
that could be used to control N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) levels in malt.
Their findings were published in the MBAA Tech. Qr. (Vol.17, No.4, 1980).


For the record, the highest NDMA level reported was in Bamberg Rauchbier.
It contained 5-15 parts per billon, and not 5 ppm as reported in HBD. This
also was the level reported in their malt. The NDMA levels of beer is typically 
9-10 times lower than in the malt used.


I feel it is perfectly legitimate to raise the possibility that beer with
higher than normal nitrosamine levels could be a health hazard. Nevertheless,
there are many aspects of this issue I do not fully understand. For example, 
population data shows that Bamberg has one of the highest rates of beer
consumption in Germany (no small feat!), yet its cancer and death rates
are near (and in fact slightly below) the average in Germany. I conjecture
if the fair citizens of Bamberg smoked cigarettes at the same rate they
consume Rauchbier, and if at the same time everyone else in Germany did not
smoke, then the Bamberg cancer and death rates would 5-10 times the German
average. This is a fair comparison since most German beer has very low NDMA
levels. While a formal linkage between cigarette smoking and cancer has not
been established, just about anyone's data shows that it is indeed real. If
Rauchbier is a health hazard, why doesn't this show up in the data? People
in Bamberg have been drinking this beer throughout the 20th century, and in
fact even longer.


There has been a serious "social cost" associated with the ban on smoked
malt. One casuality has been a beer called "Smoked Porter". It is a 
natural for brewpubs. For example, it and smoked salmon are a marriage
made in heaven, especially if capers are added as well. It is possible
for a brewpub to buy regular malt, and then smoke it themselves. Alaska Br.,
a micro, is doing just that, and at the same time winning all sorts of
ribbons at the GABFs for their version of smoked porter. Nevertheless,
the brewpubs I have been associated with have been reluctant to brew
a version for fear they would be accused of poisoning their customers.
It doesn't take much of this sort of thing to totally trash a small
commercial operation.


For the record, the Belgium base malts have very low NDMA levels, and
in fact are lower than most US malts. Other than that, they are perfectly
fine for brewing!

Subject: Corona versus JSP MaltMill


This post may come as a surprise to those who have followed my
battles with JS over the last year, but being a BJCP beer judge
teaches you the importance of being just and unbiased, which is
what I feel compelled to do regarding this point also.


Roy writes:
     OBTW, blind side-by-side comparisons between grists crushed with a
     corona mill and a "you know who" rollermill have shown the corona
     crushed grist to be superior. The Corona Mill produced less flour
     and smaller starch granules and the husk was left more intact.
     Analysis was done by several professional brewers and scores of
     accomplished homebrewers.


I find this so incredibly hard to believe, I find it difficult to
avoid calling it a lie.  With the proper adjustment, the Corona can,
indeed, produce smaller starch granules, but contrary to Roy's statement,
this will invariably produce *more* flour and *shred* the husks into
very small pieces.


Jack and I have this on-again/off-again war going on and during
one of the cease-fires, I purchased a JSP MaltMill.  I have compared
the crush with the MM against the crush done by various other means,
including the Corona, and I must honestly say that the MM crush is
*far* superior to the Corona and all other methods short of a $5500
professional rollermill.  I have used the MM with over 17 different
varieties of malted and unmalted barley and there has *never* been any
splintering of husk material by the MM as is *always* the case with
the Corona.

For the record, "doughing-in" is the addition of water to the grist
(which is highly recommended) not vice versa.  Adding the grist to
the strike liquor will work, but will create much more balled starch
than the opposite (see Noonan's "Brewing Lager Beer").

Subject: brown ale or porter?/samuel smith's


In the last HBD, Shreefal presents the following recipe for
comments:


   brown ale recipe


4 # light liquid extract
2 # english 2-row malt   <--- lager or ale malt?
1/4 # chocolate malt
1/4 # black patent malt
1 # light brown sugar


1 oz Goldings in the boil
1/2 oz Cascade boiling hops and finishing   <--- is that 1/2 oz   
                                            each for boiling and  
                                            finishing?
ale yeast


I'd like to comment on the recipe and the brown ale style.  This is
not a flame!


The AHA style guidelines for the english brown ale are:


1.040 - 1.050 SG
   15 - 25    IBUs
   15 - 22    color


Assuming the usual 5 gallon batch, the above recipe will produce a
beer in the mid-to-high 1.050s.  I played with it a bit in Chris
Campanelli's BRF program, but the gravity math would go
approximately as follows:


32 - 36 points of gravity for the liquid extract
10      points of gravity for the 2 pounds of malt
 5      points of gravity for the highly roasted malts
 8 -  9 points of gravity for 1 pound of sugar


So, strictly speaking, the beer is too big to be a brown ale.  In
gravity and color, it is more like a porter.  1/4# each of
chocolate malt and black malt will give the beer a dark brown-red
color.


What about hops?  As indicated, I don't know whether the hopping is
intended as:


1 oz Golding in boil             1 oz Golding in boil
1/2 oz Cascade in boil      OR   1/2 oz Cascade for finish
1/2 oz Cascade for finish 


Assuming a one-hour boil, the left hop schedule will produce
something like 30 IBUs, which is better suited to a porter, while
the right hop schedule will produce something like 25 IBUs, which
is suited to a brown ale.


A brown ale is brown in color and malt-accented in flavor.  While
there are different variants of brown ales, sample some Newcastle
Brown Ale or Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale.  


How about getting some color and flavor from dark crystal malt? 
For example, assuming a 5-gallon batch and 75% extract efficiency:


7-8 # pale malt (OR 5 # dry malt extract)
1 # 80L (dark) crystal malt


should produce an appropriate flavor and body.  For an attempt at
a "nut" flavor, try instead:


7-8 # pale malt (OR 5 # dry malt extract)
1 # 10L (light) crystal malt
2-3 ounces roasted barley


In either of the above, you can substitute some brown sugar for the
pale malt or dry malt extract.  I wouldn't use more than 1 pound of
sugar.  While pure refined sugar will ferment perfectly, brown
sugar has some added molasses that will leave some residual
unfermentables and their flavors in the beer.


Samuel Smith's Nut Brown ale is very nicely hopped.  To get some
hop flavor, which I think I taste in this particular beer, try a
hop addition at 20 minutes to end of boil.  Samuel Smith's uses a
unique yeast and fermentation setup.  For a bit of diacetyl
(butterscotchy) flavor in the beer, perhaps Wyeast Irish ale yeast
might be tried.

It seems that many, many brewers have problems getting their kegging systems
to work properly.  What is often forgotten (as Michael noted) is the length
of the liquid-side hose.  David Miller has a great article in the 1992
AHA Conference Proceedings on kegging systems.


The CO2 dissolved in the beer will come out of solution eventually.  We
would like most of it to come out of solution in our mouths, not earlier.
*When* the CO2 comes out of solution is based upon many things, including:


the temperature of the beer,
the pressure on the gas-side of the keg,
the length of the liquid-side hose,
the diameter of the liquid-side hose,
the smoothness of the walls of the liquid path
   (note this includes any gunk on the inside of the walls of the
    pickup tube, fittings, hose and faucet),
the amount of constriction of flow in the faucet, and
the cleanliness of the glass.


I dispense my 54F ales at between 7 and 12 psi (depending on the style),
down a 6 foot, 1/4" ID FOXX SUPERFLEX hose and (as Michael said) let the
keg cool for a good 24 hours so the force-carbonated beer can dissolve
the CO2 you pressed against it.

I think you're talking about the Whitbread yeast.  SNPA yeast and Wyeast
#1056 are both single-strain yeasts, whereas Whitbread and Wyeast #1098
are three-strain yeasts.  Slow fermentation from SNPA dregs might be
attibuted to under-oxygenation by brewers used to dry yeasts (which require
a lot less oxygen than Wyeast or dreg-cultured yeasts) or by extended
lag times resulting from temperature shock (be careful that your starter
and wort are as close to the same temperature as possible).

Subject: FAST Fermentation


I've seen articles in the past that suggested pouring a new batch
of wort over the trub remaining in the fermenter after racking
off for bottling. I gave this a try last weekend and recommend it
if for nothing else than the entertainment value. Fermentation
started in less than an hour, and after four hours the fireworks
had commenced. I have never seen such a vigorous fermentation!
The blowoff tube resembled flowing lava and I kept getting up
during the night to see if disaster (overflowed blowoff jar) had
struck. Luckily, the blowoff tub was longer than normal and the
height of the bend never allowed much wort to be blown off. I'm
sure that at least a gallon would have been blown off under normal
conditions. Fermentation was basically complete in less than 20
hours. I'll be racking to a secondary soon and I'll let you know
how it taste after bottling. Lag time is definitely not a problem
with this method.

Hi All,


  In HBD #1063, Peter Maxwell asks:


>Al gives us some interesting figures for hop storage which apply for, I

   I use pellets exclusively, and always store them in the freezer.  Pellets
tend to keep better than whole hops, storing them in the freezer seems to
prolong the shelf life even further.  I've used pellets that were stored in
this manner for 4 to 5 months, the beers came out fine, I didn't *notice*
any funny flavors or effect on hop utilization.  On the other hand, I`ve
read that sub-freezing temperatures can rupture the lupilin glands.
Assuming for the moment that this is true, how much of a problem would this
be with pellets?  IMHO, the milling and pressing processes used to make
pellets would rupture the glands anyway.  Comments, anyone??

   Tim, do you know to what extent the pilsner malt was modified?  I get
German pilsner malt that has a very low degree of modification.  On two 
occasions in the past, I used this malt as a base malt for light colored
ales.  Both times, I used a step mash with rests roughly similar in times
and temperatures to what Tim described.  The first batch, I got 27 pts/lb,
and 26 for the second.  I consistently get 30-32 pts/lb using step mashing
and highly modified malts, 34 pts/lb using decoction mashing and under-
modified pilsner malt.  IMHO, the combination of undermodified malt and
step or single infusion mashing will produce lower yields, the use of
these malts calls for decoction mashing.
   If the modification rating cannot be obtained from the supplier, there
are a couple of other ways to determine the degree to which a malt has been
modified.  Chew a few grains, if the malt is undermodified, the tips of
the grain will feel hard and steel-like against the teeth.  The degree of
modification can also be determined by examining the length of the
acrospire.  Use a razor or penknife to scrape away the husk, there will be
a fibrous looking growth that's a slightly different color than the rest
of the kernel.  If the length of this growth is 1/2 to 3/4 the length of
the kernel, the malt is undermodified.  If the length of the acrospire is
3/4 or more the length of the kernel, the malt is highly modified.
   There are pilsner malts available that are highly modified, I know
Munton & Fison produces such a malt, I'm sure there are others. 
        


                                   Cheers,
                                     Jim

   What's the optimum temperature range for Wyeast's California Common
yeast, aka. Steam (tm) beer yeast?   My Wyeast profile listing must be
out of date as CC yeast is not even listed;  Jeff F., do you have the
latest version?  Fwiw, it's fermenting madly at 60 degF.

Subject: wort chiller questions


Howdy All!
     I have a few questions regarding wort-chillers.  I am interested
in making my own chiller.  The type I have decided on is a copper coil
immersed in an ice-water bath.  The reason for this style is the desire
to conserve water (Colorado being a fairly arid state.)
     I am curious if anyone else uses this type of chiller.  If so, how
well does it work?  How long does it take to chill 5 gallons of wort to
a reasonable temperature?  How much ice is required?  What length of
what diameter tubing was used?
     Anything else I should know before leaping in and just making the
thing?  Enquiring minds want to know!


Thanks for any and all replies,
                                Mike Zulauf

Subject: Colour Units


I have just found a new supplier for my grain requirements who has data
sheets on the malt available. Specifically, it mentions a colour rating 
expressed in degrees EBC as opposed to degrees LOVIBOND. What is the conversion
factor between the two units.


Also the product specification mentions the following:


SPECIFICATION                PALE MALT                WHEAT MALT


Colour                        2.7 degrees LOVIBOND        4.5 degrees LOVIBOND
Total protein                eg 11.5%                14.5%
Soluble protein                eg 5.0%                        8.5%
Kolbach index                eg 43 (no units)        61 (no units)
Diastatic power                70 degrees L                160 degrees L
Viscosity                1.65 cp                        1.60 cp




Need I concern myself with any of these quantities? If so which ones are important
and what do the units mean? Does the above specification indicate a malt of good
or average quality?




Cheers,




Murray.

x
xThis ye
ar's competition will be bigger and better than ever with an expanded 
xformat which will include sp
eakers, demonstrations, and activities to 
xsupplement the greatest collection of homebrews we have
