Subject: Propensity Pilsner Lagering Questions


I am posting for a friend, but he made the following, and has a few questions:


Propensity Pilsner (from Papazian's NCJOHB)
Wyeast #2007 (I think it's a bavarian lager, but the # is definitely correct.)


OG: 1055


Primary Ferment for one week `at` 52F.
Racked to secondary.
Secondary Ferment is currently on it's NINTH week `at` 40F.
Still getting glugs every 60 seconds from normal 3-piece airlock.


Bottom of carboy currently has ~1 inch of all-one-color trub.
Color is crystal clear.


Questions:
Is this too long of a ferment?
Should this be re-racked into a third carboy to get it off the trub?
With 60sec/glug does he need to wait any longer before bottling?
If he bottles now, should he use less priming sugar since it's not finished?


Thanks

After reading Mr. Barbour's response to his hate mail, I tend to agree
with him - up to a limit...


The TV show cannot be expected to know all the ins & outs of
homebrewing, hang-gliding, tiddlywinks, and other pursuits.  And
"Cinema Verite" is worth preserving - BUT it should be prefaced as
such.  I think the show ought to begin with a disclaimer - "we show it
as it is - without any justification, morally or legally, on our
part."


Just my thought - if you find it distasteful you can send your

Mike Zulaf asks about tubing in ice chillers.


Mike, while I haven't built one of these specifically, I have seen one
work and can offer some general advice which may be of use to other
readers as well.


In general, don't go with any tubing smaller than 3/8" OD unless your
tubing length is very short (I built a counter flow chiller with 1/4"
and was sorry I wasted my time).  Because I use tap-temperature water,
I have a 30' length counterflow chiller.  If you are going to use ice
(and keep it icy) you can get away with less.  If ever in doubt about
your length, install a valve at the outlet of your copper coil so you
can slow down the flow if the outlet is not cold enough.  A friend of
mine who uses a chiller of the type you mentioned is convinced the 10'
length he used is too short.


MOST IMPORTANT!  Before you coil any tubing, take a q-tip, dip it in
rubbing alcohol, and swab around on the inside of the tubing.  If you
get black goo on the end, you've got machining oils inside and don't
want your beer to be in contact with that.  You need to clean out the
tubing by snaking a very stiff wire through it, lubricated with lots of
dish soap.  Pull a string through the tubing, tie cotton balls on the
string and pull them back and forth to scour the inside of the tubing.
Rinse the soap out (leaving the string in) and repeat the cotton ball
exercise.


If anyone wants my plans for a counter-flow chiller, send me email.

Subject: Culturing Sierra Nevada Dregs




Someone says:
) Rob Bradley asked about culturing Sierra Nevada dregs.  Isn't there three
) different strains involved in the fermentation, as well as three initially
) in the Wyeast 1056 pouch?  The first strain starts rapidly, but isn't
) tolerant to ethanol and settles out rapidly, and then a second strain takes
) over.  The third strain starts very slowly, but is responsible for the
) bottle conditioning.  I have heard of very slooow fermentations from
) yeast cultured from SNPA dregs, so maybe only the third strain is viable
) at that time.  Any comments?


My experience with 1056 and cultured Sierra Nevada is that they both
perform similarly (at least when neither is infected), are more attenuative
than 1098 and 1028, and generally finish more quickly than less attenuative
yeasts, particularly when the wort is dextrinous.


Even if your SNPA is a little old, you can still make a fine culture
from it.  The last one I did took several days to start up in a small
culture flask.  Fresh ones take only a day or two, or so they tell
me.  I've never seen a brand new SNPA out this way, although they
still taste just fine.  :-)


As another poster said, you must be confusing the Whitbread yeast
with SNPA/Chico/1056.  Now, what I remain confused on is whether the
real Whitbread triple strain is used in the Wyeast cultures.  My current
understanding is that it is not, that 1098 is a single strain.  I
know I've heard the answer to this several times over the past year
here, but it just doesn't sink in ... :-(


Finally, on a slightly different topic, has anyone here tried using
1084 (Irish) for purposes other than stouts and porters?  I feel like
trying it in bitter and mild ... perhaps it might make a good alt
yeast, too?

This is indeed what Noonan preaches.  I have always wondered about
the importance and significance of adding water to malt as opposed
to the converse.  Ok, so one can get "balled starch", wont it then
hydrate and become "non balled"?  Cant you just stir enough to 
completely mix the mash?  Since I do an upward step mash, the 
protein rest provides a 30 minute hydration period for the grains.
Wont this hydrolyze the grains and liquify the starches? Also, who
has ever seen a professional brewery doing this??  All of the breweries
I can  recall visiting do what most homebrewers do, raise a volume
of water to a given temp, and add the crushed grains onto the 
water.  This is one of the "Noonanisms" that I feel is rather un-
important to the overall beer quality.  THere are so many other
places for brewers to make significant improvements to quality
in brewing like malt/hops/yeast choices and even water chemistry.


Maybe I missed something somewhere....

Coincidence?  I think not!  (look at my e-mail address).  Interesting
about the drinkers of Rauchbier.  I wonder how much their diet (other
than beer) affects their cancer rate, ie. if a lot of beta-carotene
vegetables (sauerkraut perhaps?) negates the effects of the n.amines.

Curious.  I add the grist to the liquor, and get what seems to be a fine
dough-in.  It seems to allow for better mixing -> no dry spots.  How does
Noonan determine that it creates more "balled starch"?  Just what is 
"balled starch"?  Obviously I don't have the book.....

To continue the thread concerning nitrosoamines (specifically 


N-nitrosodimethylamine), they are indeed potent carcinogens but their level in


beer is relatively small (ave. 2 ppb) compared to such products as frankfurters


(0 - 84 ppb), fish and fish products (4 - 26 ppb), cheeses (2 - 26 ppb), 


and various meat products (1 to 80 ppb).   They are also found in tobacco 


smoke and are produced in the human body from reactions between nitrates 


and protein.  In reality, some of the more prominent carcinogens we should 


worry about are tobacco smoke both main and side-stream, grilled meat and 


fish products which contain potent heterocyclic amines, alcohol in excess,


mycotoxins found in moldy grain, and UV light.

Subject: Old trub, New wort story






Had to add my data point to the re-usable trub methodolgy.


Made a nice lager in my 50 degree basement, and decided to try
out the method of trub recycling. First I dumped the trub into 
a sterile pot, and covered it, then washed and sterilized the fermenter
(I use plastic for the first stage, but only have one usable bucket).
Brewed up another batch, let cool, and pitched the wort. Okay so far.


As reported, the first stage takes off like a house afire, even at 50F,
it looked like it would be ready within 5 days to rack to secondary.


But, around the fifth day, while making my customary wort check, I noticed
that the whole basement smelled of dirty diapers. And when I stepped into
the little side room that I keep my fermenters, the smell was overpowering.


(insert sound of sinking spirits)


Well, loathe that I am to dump $20 of malt down the drain, I waited one more 
day and then racked it to secondary.  And while checking the gravity, I tasted
the tube full of beer, and _no odd flavors_!  The  secondary seemed to be
clearing just fine, BUT, the odd smell persisted in the fermentation room.




To make a long story short, the ferment room is right next to the downstairs
bathroom, which we almost never use.  The p-trap in the shower had dried out,
allowing sewer gas to seep out into the ferment room through the plumbing 
access hole. Running the shower for a few minutes solved the problem.


The end of the story, is that the final product, a bitter lager turned out
beautifully, and I'm convinced that re-using trub is a viable alternative
but I would recommend it only for low temperature fermentation because of
the extremely fast start.


And run your basement shower every month or so to keep the  p-trap primed.


Bibo ergo sum.

Greetings,
        I was wondering if anyone can give me a source for caps
for Champagne bottles (28 mm?).  My roommate works at a restuarant
and has been bringing home a nice supply of champagne bottles which I
would love to be able to cap.  My capper does have the proper fittings
to handle the larger caps (as well as the standard ones) so all I need
are the caps and I'm in business.  I've checked with my local shops
(all 2 of them) and with William's mail order and so far have struck out.
Any ideas?

  I am using a six gallon Ropak bucket with a PVC manifold at the bottom for
my lauter tun.  There is a half inch adapter for PVC that screws directly into
the small spigot sold at my local brewshop.  This piece, a cross fitting,
three end caps and the 12 or so inches of PVC needed cost me a grand total of
about $2.50.  I slotted the bottom similarly to the copper coil method.  It
works fine, and seems to have improved my yields over the Zapap method.  I
attribute this to the elimination of the 1-1.5 gallon space between the two
buckets in the Zapap system.  Then again, I've only got about 6 all grain
batches under my belt :-), and experience may be what is increasing my yields.

In fact, Pellet hops have all the glands ruptured by the pellitization 
process.  The reason pellets are more stable is that they are highly 
compresses an d that naturally excludes oxygen infiltration.  The 
completely ruptured glands are the reason pellets have higher utilization
rates in the boil.

    Do we have any brewers in Central Florida (Orlando, Kissimmee, St. Cloud,
Lake Buena Vista, etc.) who read the Homebrew Digest?  If so, please contact
me via email.  Thanks!

I don't have a conversion, but here are some L/EBC pairs from Siebel's --
perhaps you can figure out your own conversion factor:


Lov    EBC
3.21   8
7.83   15
25.7   55
7.87   15
21.65  45
77.5   155
221    500
22.5   55
497.5  1100
557.5  1400
601    1400


Looks slightly non-linear at the ends, but roughly 1:2 in the middle.


Regarding the quality of this malt, I'd say it's quite good.  To compare,
the DeWolf-Cosyns Pale Ale Malt is:


3.21 degrees Lovibond
10.00% total protein
3.94% soluble protein
60 degrees Lintner (diastatic power)


Schreier 2-row Brewer's Malt is:


1.78 degrees Lovibond
12.4% total protein
5.10% soluble protein
131 degrees Lintner

Subject: re-using yeast in fermenter


Ron Karwoski writes about his experiences in pouring new wort over existing
yeast in the fermenter.  My questions relate to doing the same thing with
the secondary fermenter:


1.  If the secondary has been sitting a while (say a week or two) is the
sediment still viable yeast?


2.  After I've racked off for bottling, how long could I safely leave the
remnants?  I thought of just putting back the airlock and leaving it
untouched until the next brew.


3.  If I do 2 above, will it be necessary to "start" the yeast by adding a
small amount of sterile wort as per WYEAST starters?

Subject: Yeast Culturing Questions




I'm a new reader of HBD, and some recent discussions about culturing yeast 
prompt me to ask a few questions.  I started culturing yeasts a few weeks ago. 
I began with an ale and a lager strain that I purchased in slants from the 
mail order supply store I use.  I then had a microbiologist make me slants and 
petri dishes of solidified worts as per Paul Farnsworth's culturing article in 
the ZYMURGY Yeast and Beer Special Issue.  I inoculated two petri dishes with 
these strains, but of course I didn't want to stop there. 


Next, I took the sediment from a Trippel I had brewed using Wyeast #1214 
(Belgium Ale), cultured it, and inoculated another petri dish.


Then, I brewed a lager with a Whitbread Dry Lager Yeast and an ale with a 
Whitbread Dry Ale Yeast.  I first inoculated slants from the starter cultures 
I had made by rehydrating these two in sterile wort.  I had inoculated slants 
of the other three strains too, but all five of these slants were not as 
solidified as the petri dishes and I did not like what saw, so I disposed of 
them.  I still, however, wanted cultures of the two Whitbread varieties, so I 
inoculated petri dishes from the slurry I collected after the primary 
fermentation.


I also inoculated a petri dish from a starter culture I made from a Dry Edme 
Ale Yeast.


Now, my questions.  


Concerning the Belgian Ale Yeast from the Trippel, what are the chances that 
it has mutated or was a multiple-strain yeast?  (I am currently making a 
starter culture to use over the weekend.)


Are the Whitbread's Dry Ale and/or Lager Yeasts triple-strain yeasts, and if 
they are, does that mean that I have cultured only the third strain because I 
used the slurry from the primary fermentation?


Is there anything I should know about the Dry Edme I cultured?


I would appreciate any response from those more experienced than I in yeast 
culturing.


Thanks,

Al.


I disagree.  Let me be more specific: what Al says about higher alcohols
may well be true.  We don't really know what's wrong with Scott's beer.
I have, however, on three or so occasions over the years had awful,
unexplained (unexplainable?) solvent tastes/smells.  Similar to the
problem that JS mentioned in the Goose Island Barleywine (I tasted
the stuff in early January and agree (!!) with arf) in today's HBD,
but more pronounced.  In my private lexicon, this solvent taste is
"clinical".  I posted about it in the HBD in 1989, wondering about
possible connections with diacytel (consensus: no connection) and how
to avoid it (be careful with fermentation temperature and cleanliness,
I seem to recall).


At any rate, I twice bottled such beer, and the solvent never went
away, not even after a year.  It got worse, in fact, as the other
flavors mellowed.


So keep us posted, Scott.


Cheers,


Rob (bradley`at`adx.adelphi.edu)
