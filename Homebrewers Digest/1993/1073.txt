Subject: Calculating IBU's with the Utilization Function


Here's an example of how to use the hop utilization function in my previous
article, using the calculations in Jackie Rager's Zymurgy article:


UTILIZATION = 18.109069 + 13.862039 * hyptan[(MINUTES - 31.322749) / 18.267743]
    (Of course, you can drop a lot of those significant figures.)


    If the gravity of the boil exceeds 1.050:
ADJUSTMENT = (BOIL_GRAVITY - 1.050) / 0.2
    otherwise,
ADJUSTMENT = 0


IBU_PER_OZ  = UTILIZATION * ALPHA * 74.62 / (VOLUME * (1 + ADJUSTMENT));
    ALPHA is the percent alpha acids (eg. 5.2--don't devide by 100)
    VOLUME is the final number of gallons in the batch (usually 5).


    To calculate IBU's if you know the number of ounces of hops to be used:
IBU = OUNCES * IBU_PER_OZ
    To predict the number of ounces needed to hit a targed IBU:
OUNCES = IBU / IBU_PER_OZ
 


I've packaged those formulae into a nifty calculator for those of you
who are on a Unix machine, or a PC that has Perl installed.  (If there
is a demand, I can convert it to a C-shell script or a C program.)


It will calculate IBU's (International Bittering Units), given only:


 - amount of hops
 - alpha acid rating
 - length of boil
 - gravity of boil (if over 1.050)


It basically does what that mess of calculations in the Zymurgy article
does (but you don't have to think about it).  It will also do the
inverse--return the amount of hops required to reach a target IBU level.


If I typed:


ibu 1.5 8 45


The output would be:


1.50 ounces of hops with 8.0% alpha acid, boiled for 45 minutes
will produce 48.2 IBU's.


In the "inverse" mode:


ibu -i 49 8 60


would produce this output:


1.33 ounces of hops with 8.0% alpha acid, boiled for 60 minutes
will be required to produce 49.0 IBU's.


Here's the Perl script (called "ibu"):
___________________________________________________________________________
#!/usr/bin/perl


require "getopts.pl";


# set option variable defaults


$boil_gravity = 1.050;
$volume       = 5;


# read command line


if ((!&Getopts('iv:g:')) || ($#ARGV != 2))
  {
   printf STDERR qq/
Usage:
  ibu [-v volume] [-g boil_gravity] ounces percent_alpha minutes
      -v  Final volume in gallons.  The default is 5.
      -g  Gravity of boil if over 1.050.
or
  ibu -i [-v volume] [-g boil_gravity] target_ibu percent_alpha minutes
      -i  Inverse.  Return number of ounces required to hit target IBU's.


Example:
  ibu -g 1.082 1.5 8.3 30
/;
  exit 1;
  }


$inverse       = $opt_i;
$boil_gravity  = $opt_g if ($opt_g);
$volume        = $opt_v if ($opt_v);
$ounces        = $ARGV[0];
$ibu           = $ARGV[0];
$alpha         = $ARGV[1];
$minutes       = $ARGV[2];
 


if ($boil_gravity > 1.050)
  {$adjustment = ($boil_gravity - 1.050) / 0.2;}
else
  {$adjustment = 0;}
 


# calculate utilization from exponential equivalent of hyperbolic tangent
$exp         = ($minutes - 31.322749) / 18.267743;
$utilization = 0.18109069 + 0.13862039
             * (exp($exp) - exp(-$exp)) / (exp($exp) + exp(-$exp));
 


$ibu_per_oz  = $utilization * $alpha * 74.62 / ($volume * (1 + $adjustment));


unless ($inverse)
  {$ibu = $ounces * $ibu_per_oz;}
else
  {$ounces = $ibu / $ibu_per_oz;}
 


printf("%.2f ounces of hops with %.1f%% alpha acid, boiled for %d minutes",
       $ounces, $alpha, $minutes);
printf(" in %.3f wort", $boil_gravity) if ($opt_g);
printf("\nwill");
printf(" be required to") if ($inverse);
printf(" produce %.1f IBU's.\n", $ibu);

Subject: Extract and Proud




As one who has gotten a great deal of information out of HBD, and who finds 
it a great way to forget about work for twenty minutes a day, I really hate 
it when it degenerates into silly stuff like Pub-Info-Request-Wars and 
Extract-vs.-Grain wars.  


PLEASE LET'S NOT LET THIS GET OUT OF HAND, PEOPLE!


I have thought about doing the all-grain route, but frankly my present 
financial condition prevents me from investing in the additional equipment, 
and the fact that I have three children under the age of six lurking around 
my house makes the extra time involved impractical for me.  I also suspect 
that if I didn't know all-grain methods were available to the homebrewer, I 
would continue to drink my extract brews in complete bliss (o.k., and 
ignorance too).  Most of us extracters have very good reasons for staying 
with our present methods.


My inquiries regarding extract brewing have always been received gracefully 
and enthusiastically by readers of the HBD.  I would say that if there really 
ARE extract brewers who are intimidated by the level of discussion by all-
grainers, yeast-culturers, etc., they should do as I have done: ask anyway!  
It's your right.  If someone actually does respond "snobbishly," then flame 
the idiot by private e-mail and go on asking your questions publicly.


Relax, don't worry -- have an extract brew.

Subject: RE: soda kegs on tap




Hi All,


   From HBD #1071:


>Anybody have advice on how (and how long) to keep soda kegs on tap? I have
>not tried it for more than about two weeks, and there was a noticable
>change in the beer at the end. I did not take stringent measures against
>leaks, so I presume the deterioration was due to air getting into the keg.


   I'd say your presumption is probably correct.  I've kept beers in soda
kegs for over two months with absolutely no ill effects, the last pint tastes
as good or better than the first.  Sealed in a keg at a constant 45F,
protected from heat, light and air, beer should keep for quite some time,
certainly longer than two weeks.
   The poster didn't mention whether or not the kegs were kept refridgerated,
but I'm not sure this is a critical point.  Keeping them in a reasonably cool
place like a basement should be OK.  I believe the problem is the kegs were
not well sealed, allowing air to get in.
   Try keeping a maintainence pressure of 12-15 psi on the keg when not
dispensing.  This will help provide a tighter seal along the large O-ring.
Also, disconnect the CO2 tank and the cobra tap when not in use.  Leaving the
hose barbs installed keeps the check valves in the fitting open.  The only
remaining seal is the small rubber gasket between the hose barb and the
fitting, which I would not trust to keep the keg airtight over an
extended period.


                                   Cheers,
                                     Jim

Subject: Hops Cultivation




Short time listener, first time caller. When my spouse and I purchased
our home, we had the good fortune of inheriting a rather prolific hops
plant. Now that I've begun brewing, the plant is no longer just and
attractive ornamental, but offers practical benefits as well.


The Problem: I have no idea as to what variety these hops might be. We
live in the infamous Willamette Valley, so I at least have the obvious
first guess.  Does anyone out there know of a good reference book that
would allow me to key out this beast. Perhaps a "Peterson's Field
Guide to Hops and Grains."


Other Questions: Papazian suggests that the soil for growing hops should
be loamy and kept continually moist during the growing season. We have
excruciatingly high clay content in our soils and  have never watered at all.
Nevertheless the plant has done quite well. Will the quality of the
hops be affected by my lack of care? Or should I follow the adage "If
it ain't broke, don't fix it?"  Also, how much will AAU vary with time
of harvest, amount of watering, etc.  And lastly, is there any moderately
low-tech way of determining AAU of homegrown hops?


A good reference book on this subject would satisfy my needs, should you
not wish to clutter the e-waves.


Thanks in advance.  Spence.

 >Since many topics come up in cyclical manner it would be nice if they could

 A couple of points here.  Many of us barely literate computer users have no 
 idea of how to access a FAQ, if indeed it is something we can get at will.
 
 Compuserve stores just about everything of any value in library files that 
 are easily accessible but cost an arm and a leg to retrieve or even find out 
 what's there.  I have not read the header lately, but if such a things exists 
 for HBD readers, instructions on accessing it should be part of the HBD 
 header and in terms even I can understand.
 
 .....
 
 >Recirculation is a practice employed in the lautering of mashed grains where
 the turbid sweet wort is collected, as it is runoff, and recirculated through
 the grain bed until the runoff becomes clear.
 
 >Please consider this FAQ as a kind of HbD Request For Comment (RFC).  Please
 feel free to make any additions or corrections.
 
 My comment is that there exists a commercially available product for mashing 
 (name and availibity upon request) that runs clear in something less than one 
 cup and the whole discussion becomes academic.
 
 .........
 
 Having said that, the RFC aspect for a FAQ library is important and seems to 
 be lacking in the current system.  For example, I have badgered the person 
 who maintains the FAQ to include videos in his list of sources and the 
 request has been ignored for several years.

 >I wonder how many questions have not even been asked because the author is

 (Remember that discussion a while back about _real_ brewers?)
 
 How could I forget?  I suppose my more objective posting yesterday will also 
 be interpreted by some as intimidation but that was not my intent.
 
 I simply think it's time to call a spade, a spade and get on with brewing.  
 How one reacts to someone else's opinions, views and statements is his own 
 responsibility.  If one chooses to run away because some windbag uses big 
 words, I guess that's life.
 
 I would like to point out that before stumbling upon the HBD, I had spent 
 over twenty years (off and on) making barely drinkable (and mostly not) 
 rubbish.  And now look at me... the World's Greatest Brewer!  If I can glean 
 what is needed out of this forum, so can anyone else and I have little 
 sympathy for people who claim to be intimidated.
 
 >I suspect that the readership consists of more beginners than are 
 represented by the questions posed in the HBD.  And I think that, if 
 beginners realized that they make up a substantial part of the HBD community, 
 they would be more likely to pose "lower level" questions, and therefore, 
 improve their comprehension and brewing.
 
 That is a good point but I think it is already happening at a reasonable 
 level.  Compuserve deals with this problem by dividing the forum into Basic 
 and Tehnical message groups but that can't be done on the Digest so one just 
 has to wade through the stuff they are not interested in but fortunately it's 
 "free" here.  Someone could start up a beginners' digest but I think it would 
 be counter-productive.
 
 I don't doubt that some people may be intimidated but there are enough that 
 are not, to get out the questions and keep the discussions going.
 
 Back to spades.... "real brewers" was a poor choice of words and perhaps 
 trying to come up with a more appropriate one will still offend some but 
 pushing it under the rug doesn't help either.
 
 I still contend that mashing whole grains is another step up the ladder to 
 becoming the "complete brewer".  If many/most opt out, so be it.  We opt out 
 of many steps in the process but there is no reason to get paranoid about any 
 particular one of them.  Nor is there any reason to criticize those who 
 crusade for or against, any or all of them.

 I can't offer anything other than intuitive reasoning.  Wort is converted to 
 extract by evaporating the water.  In the case of dry extract almost all and 
 in the case of liquid much less.  Is seems that whatever they do to the wort 
 to get rid of the water has nothing to do with what we do to wort to make 
 beer and therefore, less is better.

After reading the posts of Ulick Stafford and Bill Szymczak, I realized
that Bud % alcohol must vary greatly from region to region even in the US.
In this "wonderful" state of Utah it is law that beer exceeding 3.2% 
alcohol by volume must be sold in liquor stores.  However, Bud is available
in any grocery store around here.


Our brewing club recently brewed a beer with chocolate in it.  Does anyone
have any idea on cleaning the oil out of the plastic tubing and buckets 
easily?  We were trying to avoid using dish washing detergent since they 
normally leave behind stuff for anti-spotting and who knows what else.  We
also were trying to avoid using a lot of water since we going through a 
major drought in the area.

I've been absent for a while, so I don't know what the last time was
that this was discussed.


The yeast in Chimay is not a single strain.  It is either 3 or 5.  I
forget which, but I think it is 3.  If you plate it and isolate a
single cell for building a culture, you will only get one of the
three.


Of course, you also avoid any other nasties that snuck into the bottle
in small numbers.

        Thanks for your response to my RIMS questions on the HBD.  I have

 - What is your method for sparging?
 - What are your approximate flow rates during the different stages?
 - How quickly does your heater cycle on and off?
 - Which is higher, the liquid level or the grain level and should it 
  matter?
 - Where does the diffuser go?  Does it float on top of the grain/wort?

It _was_ an ale.  When Coors started making it (1978?) it was an ale.
Somewhere along the way, they started making the lager.


When I first was drinking it ~1986, it was an ale and I liked it.  I
stopped buying it for a while (shifting to Bass), and when I bought it
again, I didn't like it much.  I later noticed that it was (in tiny
print) "lager" now.

Well, there are at least some of us out there who don't drink much beer.  I 
probably drink about 2 or 3 beers a week.  There are at least 12 cases of 
homebrew in my basement.


Like yours, my basement doesn't get below 50F during the winter nor much 
above 60F or so in the summer.  Also, I store all my beer in cardboard 
boxes with covers, so there is no exposure to light.


I brought a three-year-old holiday ale to a December homebrewer meeting.  
It had been seriously overhopped originally and now tasted like an OK ale--
none of the spice character was left, and only a normal amount of hop 
bitterness could be detected.  It wasn't oxidized, either.


I recently uncovered a two-year-old raspberry ale six pack.  Figured it 
would have none of the overpowering raspberry aroma and flavor of the 
original brew.  Boy, was I wrong!  Still smelled and tasted great!  I 
*would* say that it was past it's prime, though.


For that matter, I still have some 1990 Anchor holiday ale down there and 
it is starting to get a little worse but is still just fine.


What general rules or conlusions do I have?


1) Most beers will keep fine for at least a year under such conditions.  
   Many will keep for two or three just fine.  


2) Invite friends over to help you drink it if you like to brew as much as 
   I do.  Everyone is happy this way.

        The charters of the Digest and rec.crafts.brewing exclude wine 
making for some reason.  As both brewer and wine maker, I will risk 
flamage to comment here on wine making.  As far as wine kits go, I 
can't comment; I tend to avoid anything that looks like a recipe.  I 
don't see why you can't make a decent wine from kits, though.  I make
fruit wines, which can't really be compared to commercial (grape)
wines.  For example, I tend to like dry wines ("Hey, Stiles, you
call this good wine?  I call it gagging in the Sahara."), but fruit
wines generally exhibit their fruit character better if they have
some residual sweetness.
        Wine making skills/equipment overlap considerably with those
of brewing, but there are differences.  Also, the time scale is a lot
different (I don't have TIME for instant gratification, dammit!).
Get a good book on wine making.  A browse through the library is a 
good start.

Now, here's a question that could be answered by extract brewers and all 
grain brewers alike.


There was a *thin* thread (not quite overwhelmed by all the philosophizing 
and speculation about snobbishnes) recently about spiced ales.


Part of the discussion prompts me to wonder: has anyone tried BOTH the 
technique of adding whole spices at some point to the boil AND adding 
powdered spices at the end of the boil?  (Obviously, in different batches.)


I made my first spiced ale this year and boiled orange zest, ginger root, 
cinnamon sticks and whole cloves for about the last thirty minutes.  It has a 
bit more bite than I intended, although the beer does taste quite good.  I am 
wondering whether I boiled the stuff too long and whether powdered spices 
at the end of the boil would produce a "kinder, gentler" brew.


If anyone has a response of general interest, please post.  I would also be 
happy to summarize and post e-mail responses.

I have to agree about the freshness and general wonderfullness of hops
plugs.  I bought some recently (imported by Crosby & Baker, according
to the package) at Brew 'N' Grow (same as Alternative Garden Supply,
but in Detroit instead of Chicago).  I made a Bock with Hallertau & a
little Saaz.  What an aroma!  This was the first time I really
understood what is meant by the "spicy" aroma of Saaz.  Wow!


And the hops looked beautiful after I drained the wort.  Full cones
that half-filled my brewpot. 


The beer is still lagering, so I can't report on the taste, yet.

Subject: Diacetyl ?


I have recently begun brewing all grain batches, 5 or 6.  A constant
comment about my beers is that they contain noticable levels of
diacetyl.  I have done some research in the Zymurgy trouble shooting
issue and in Miller's CHOB and found:


1) Diacetyl is a by product of the early stage of fermentation when
oxygen is available to the yeast.
2) Its level of production is directly related to wort temperature,
i.e. warmer = more diacetyl.
3)Yeast will eventually reduce the diacetyl in the later stages of
fermentation.


I discussed my brewing process with an experienced all grain brewer
who too was having this problem with his beers.  We decide that since
the yeast strains we were using 1056 and 1098 are not noted for high
levels of diacetyl in their flavor profile that the following could 
be flaws in our brewing process:


1) Pitching into wort that was much warmer than the target fermentation
temperature.  We did this to reduce lag time.
2) Adding finings immediatley after racking to the secondary.  We did 
this to induce CO2 generation to purge the head space.  This would cause
the yeast to prematurely fall out of suspension thus reducing the
quantity and the time in which the yeast was reducing diacetyl.
3) Since we artifically carbonate our beer in soda kegs we would not
bolster the yeast population which could reduce diacetyl in the
conditioning phase.


What besides pitching to wort at fermentation temperatue and finning after
the yeast has settled or not at all what can we do to reduce the production
of diacetyl and increase its reduction later?  I still plan to artificially
carbonate it seems to make for clearer beer and I can drink it sooner, 3
days after kegging.


What can I do to produce high levels of diacetyl and minimize its reduction
if I want to brew something with a Samuel Smith profile?  Is a warm
ferment with a yeast strain noted for diacetyl production and fining
immediatley after primary fermentation the way to go ?

I know that the two most popular dry malt extracts, Munton & Fison
and Laaglander, are both made from 100% malt (note that the Laaglander
is a bit less fermentable, so use that to your advantage).  Many
syrups contain all kinds of other sugars, like corn and even sucrose.
I certainly would not want to simply dismiss all syrups -- there are
a great many that appear to be of very high quality.  I've narrowed
my use of extracts to a few that I feel are good (Northwestern, Munton
& Fison, John Bull, Alexander's, Coopers, Ireks and a few others)
and my extract batches have been par with my (and other's) all-grain
batches.

I've done empirical analysis of two batches of beer split into blowoff and
non-blowoff (non-skimming, also) sub-batches.  Beagle is partly right about
the hop resins, but is dead wrong in saying that:


1. *all* of them are in the foam, and


2. the oils and resins give the beer its body.

Part of the result of my blowoff/non-blowoff experiments was to determine that
I may lose some hop bitterness and a bit of hop flavor by using blowoff, but
I don't really want a lot most of what gets blown-off in my beer.  The
blowoff sub-batch was smoother, cleaner, less astringent and a bit less
bitter (note that I'm not a lupulophobe -- my last IPA had 80 IBU and I
thought it was a bit underhopped).  I urge you to try the blowoff method
for a beer or two and compare.

Timothy Morse        Mark Palmer                Ray Kall
Master Brewer        Manager and tour guide        Bartender, Waiter, Homebrewer


The first impression of this place might be oops I've stumbled into Cheers. It's
down stairs under the THE GARAGE building at 33 Dunster Street, Just a half 
block from Harvard Square and one block East of J.F. Kennedy Dr. It used to be a
restaurant called 33 Dunster Street.


The first thing you notice is the long bar with the stainless steal serving 
tanks enclosed in glass behind it. The bar has three sets of four towers, each 
having two taps. One hand pulled pump for either the casked Stout or the J.H. 
Pale Ale. They seemed to alternate between the two brews. Lots of back lit 
stained glass against the back wall which was left in place from when it was 33 Dunster Street.  
At the same end of the building and enclose behind the glass is a big copper 
mash-tun and fermentor from The Pub Brewing Company.


They get their pre-crushed malt from England and Hops from California, 
mashing with 700 pound of malt at 165 degrees. Gypsum is added to 
Cambridge's soft water. Extract is generally 430 gallons. The wort is counterflo
chilled and then fermented for three to five days.  The secondary is then racked 
to stainless steal cellar tanks for 10 to 21 days at 50 degrees. Some of their
ales are dry hopped with whole hops.  When aging is done they drop the temp to
36 degrees and run it through a DE filter and then to the serving tanks behind 
the bar. They use Krausing for carbonation and no CO2. They brew 14 barrels 
every three days.


The dining area is large and comfortable. I first arrived there Sat. night at 
11pm and the place was so packed I had to squeeze into the hostess stand to get
a Nut Brown Ale. The next morning I came back for Sunday brunch. It was great! I
had an Omelet that was stuffed with made-on-the-premise pork sausage in a BBQ 
sauce and a little jack cheese. Served with home fries that were quartered new 
potatoes saut ed in a garlic & onion sauce. Also served was a basket of baked 
goods from a local bakery, hot and wrapped in linen with a generous scoop of 
raspberry jam.


This brew house started nine months ago and has only been open about six 
months. Timothy Morse, Master Brewer who started out at Anchor Brewing, 
then went to Hope, WI and on to Commonwealth Brewing before starting at John 
Harvard's Brew House, has yet to pour his own brew here. It's been done under 
contract at Massachusetts Bay Brewing (Harpoon) due to hassles with the city of 
Cambridge over the  zoning. Apparently Cambridge viewed brewing as a fire 
hazard. Tim finally got to do his first brew Sat. Jan. 30,1993. 


O-K now for the good stuff.  Ray Kall the bartender, who is also a home brewer 
was very helpful, informative and friendly. In fact the entire staff here is 
well trained and friendly. He said that once Tim gets going with his own brew 
there should be some improvements. He hopes to brew traditional British 
(Burton on Trent) style.








I had a five brew sampler.


1. Was a nut brown ale:   Color was very good. I didn't get much aroma. It was 
drinkable but not exceptional. Not a Samuel Smith by any means.


2. Was a Highland Ale-a scotch:  My first taste of Scotch Ale so I can't comment
other that the FG (final gravity) seemed high but maybe normal for the style?


3. Was NEW TOWN LIGHT ALE:  Light golden color. Well carbonated. Good 
Fuggles hopping. My wife would love this one.


4. Was JOHN HARVARD'S PALE ALE:  Nice copper color and hoppy. Served 
either 'cold draught style' or 'cask conditioned and hand pulled' in the British 
manner and the Brew House's biggest seller. Had a nice sweet aftertaste.


5. Was an IRISH EXPORT STOUT:  This also was poured in two ways. Draft and 
cask. The cask was hand pulled and served warmer and less carbonated. Both 
were dark, malty, with a rich roasted flavor.  True to style. A full bodied, but
less bitter version of the famous Dublin Ale. This was my favorite.


The bill of fare for this very memorable Sunday brunch and the five brew 
sampler was $12.50. I went back one more time for dinner and the food was 
again excellent. I highly recommend the John Harvard Brew House.

The insight into the brewing process and the complete flexibility
in recipe formulation are what do it for me.  You can bake fine cake
from mixes and buy top-notch frozen puff pastry, but until you make
your own from scratch you are not fully educated.  Similarly, a complete

Really, it's not too expensive.  The beer is much cheaper (1/2 or less),
too.  I have spent much more on books and things like autoclaves and
culture tubes than I have on the equipment just needed to make all-grain
brews.  All you must have is a big pot (even the 20 qt Revereware
is ok, though a little small) and a lautering system.  <$100.

Don't be shy.  There is no need to brew from extract before working
with all grain.  When you get down to it, the process *is* forgiving.
The only thing it isn't is, er, quick.

At that temperature, well-made pale or amber beer will keep at least
a year.  Two or three, or more, wouldn't surprise me.  I don't recall
the last time I had a staled pale or amber brew, and I tend to keep
a few of almost every batch for 6-18 months.  Dark beers will eventually 
start to stale quite suddenly.


Room temperature storage is OK for most homebrew, too.  Again, I've
kept bottles for over a year at room temperature with no problems.

Jack, Jack, Jack!  It's the fact that some of us all-grain brewers
ARE elitist snobs with a superiority complex.  Furthermore, we know
we are, and we love it.  We demonstrate our affluent, care-free lifestyle
by spending 4-8 hours tending a process that saves us all of $10 per
2 cases of heer.  We buy grain by the 50lb/25kg sack and smile while
grunting past the open-mouthed folks carrying 1lb bags of crystal malt.


The process is longer and harder and more rewarding TO US.  I really
don't believe, though, that it is much more likely to produce a prize-
winning beer than extract brewing is in the hands of someone sufficiently
skilled ... or lucky.


I personally wouldn't have it any other way.  :-)  :-)

A very long time.  So long as nothing is moving around inside it,
it is still OK.  I've heard people say it goes stale after a while,
but I've not noticed this in some fairly old precrushed grain I've
gotten from a friend.


It WILL pick up moisture from the environment if the humidity is high
enough.  I think that this is responsible for the apparent loss of
yield seen by brewers who have let crushed grain sit for a day or
two.  The effect is on the order of 10%.


(Now, I once made a fine stout from a grain bill that accidentally
included a pound of flaked barley infested with weevils.  So even
a few bugs won't hurt you.)

Use a reasonably airtight enclosure (tub or tightly folded bag is
fine) and everything will work out swell.
