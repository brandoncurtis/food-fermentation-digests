Subject: hbus & ibus


First of all, thanks for all the charts and formulae for hbus -> ibus
given boiling time, S.G., etc.  I do still have a question however.  I
have seen that pellets have different utilization than whole hops (both
in this forum and in some of the homebrew books); indeed hop plugs have
yet another utilization rate.  Yet, none of the charts nor formulae
contain any reference to the form of the hops.  Does anyone have any
suggestions here?  Am I worrying too much?  Should I just use what I
have as a starting point and see how I like the results?

 >Subject: Special Archive Proposal
 
 Let me make another proposal.  How bout explaining what an archive is and how 
 one goes about accessing it before you expand on a special archive.
 
 ............
 
 >  Various, Snobs...
 
 Again, I am forced to defend my statements on "all-grain snobs" but prefer to 
 do it without personal references because this thread is simply going the 
 wrong way again.   I am sure that I could benefit from sensitivity training 
 but I wasn't able to sell my business at 40 and retire to a life of leasure 
 because I was a fool or a tyrant.  One key to success is to find out what 
 people really intend, want and mean and not try to explain to them what they 
 mean.
 
 I listed many reasons why people make extract or all-grain beer, some 
 positive and some negative and some with a value to be asigned by the brewer 
 or reader.  To isolate the meanest and thrash the messenger with it is not 
 only unfair but deflects the discussion into an endless stream of usless 
 personal attacks instead of getting to the bottom of the issue.
 
 Viz...... The economics is one major factor in the issue and it certainly is 
 true that one can make a batch of extract beer with less initial expense than 
 a single batch of all-grain beer.
 
 However, as one refines his extract process, he ends up within a few dollars  
 of an all-grain brewery.  When you get right down to it, the only thing one 
 really needs to do all-grain is a large enough kettle to boil it in.  These 
 are available for $30 at ACE Hardware and $5 more will get you a homemade 
 Easymasher in the same store.  I am sure if one haunts garage sales, one  
 could get it down even further.  That and less than $10 for ingredients will 
 put you in the all-grain business.    Most of the rest of the gadgets and 
 gizmos are just as useful and important to the serious extract brewer as they 
 are to the all-grainer.
 
 One final point, I posted the same article to Compuserve and received not a 
 single negative comment.  Again, I am not sure what this portends but it is 
 food for thought.
 
 >From: "Rick (R.) Cavasin" <cav`at`bnr.ca>
 
 >My incentive for using an iodophor was the hope that it could be reused more 
 than bleach (iodine less volatile than chlorine?) and hence less would go 
 down the drain (and into the air I'm breathing!).
 
 Precisely my reason (breathing) for trying it.  That is, in addition to the 
 fact that I got a free sample in the mail.  However, I don't think that it 
 has anywhere near the useful life of bleach.
 
 I do not feel comfortable with the 1 minute contact time with a sanitizer so 
 I always used bleach full strength or at least 50:50 and I use this stuff, 1 
 oz to the gal.  There is no shortage of clean water around here so I have no 
 qualms about thorough rinsing.
 
 I don't like the chlorine fumes and I usually wear a respirator when doing a 
 keg or my pump and hoses.  I like being able to do a simple one time rinse 
 with the iodophor and not having to worry about the fumes or pitting my kegs.
 
 I was a bit disconcerted when a fresh batch came through the pump almost 
 clear.  I suspected oxidation so I did some experiments by shaking samples in 
 closed testubes and the color does not change no matter how much or over what 
 period I shake it.
 
 I have no idea where the iodine goes or why it changes color.  The is not 
 enough water in the system to dilute that much.
 
 I guess, untill I have a bad batch of beer, I will continue to use it.
 
 As as aside, I tried using it for the starch test and it is totally ambiguous 
 and unsuited for the test.

OK,


I've got my 10 gal. cooler with false bottom and associated plumbing, 
I've got my 8.5 gal pot, and I've got my immersion chiller:  I guess
I'm ready to mash.  I am going to get 8-10 lbs of British Pale Ale 
malt this weekend and do "it".  However, I recall (please pardon my
poor memory) a thread (hey, a real thread and not a flame thread!) 
pertaining to high quality malts (Belgium?).  Could someone with a 
good handle on that thread please point me to the appropriate HBD 
issue numbers or email me a summary.  I am interested in using these 
malts.  Also, could someone post or email this newbie a description 
of what comprises a high quality malt (proteins/nitrogen/modification/?), 
i.e, what are the important factors.  Are all malts fully modified
these days?  How do you determine this information?  


Hey BadAssAstronomer, how about a few bottles of my first all-grain
batch?

Subject: DAB recipes? Yeast Culturing, and others.


      Does anyone have a recipe for a DAB beer clone?  If not, do you
      know what IBU it has?  What type of malt/hops would produce that
      flavor?


      Secondly, what is the general concensus on Bigfoot Barley Wine?  I
      tried it, and felt that it tasted EXACTLY like SN Pale Ale, only
      more alcoholic; I was not impressed... I expected something
      different.  Is this how a BW is supposed to taste?


      Could someone provide me with the number to one of the science
      houses that sells flasks & test tubes?


      Does anyone have any 'caveat emptors' for the mail order places
      that are advertised in Zymurgy?  (Are some less reliable than
      others?  I've noticed some strange variations in price too...)


      I've also gotten a book published by G.W. Kent on Culturing Yeast
      that should be avoided, if you like the English language.  The book
      seems to be technically correct, but is so full of errors (bad
      editing, grammatical errors) that I will probably write a nasty
      letter of complaint to the publisher (it's in its third!!!!!
      printing, and it STILL has this many errors).

For those of you who live in eastern Canada, I found a source
for 30 quart (US) stainless-steel pots.  I don't know who
manufactures them (no label) but they seem fairly sturdy.
The regular price is only $65 but I got one on sale for $50. 
I know the same pot is sold elsewhere for over twice this
price.  The address of the store is:

Subject: Re: Spiced Ales, DME vs. syrup


In HBD #1073, Jonathon Knight asks:


|>has anyone tried BOTH the technique of adding whole spices at some
|>point to the boil AND adding powdered spices at the end of the boil?


I used to add whole spices somewhere mid-boil, and found that, for some
of the spices, their aroma/taste was being boiled off, particularly things
like orange zest or vanilla. Others, like ginger, would last through and
overwhelm completely. I tend to steer clear of ginger now, both `cuz it
easily overwhelms, and I just don't like its flavor!


I switched over to powdered spices near the end of the boil (5-8 minutes)
and am much happier with the results now. It has become very easy to get
consistency from batch to batch with this method, I find. I've settled
in on a particular recipe of my own creation which I have made several 
years running now, and I can be assured it'll "taste right" when done.


There may be some dispute, though, over just how fresh powdered spices
might be, and that'd I think affect their utilization in the wort. The
only advantage I can see to whole spices over powdered is this "freshness
thing". And for certain spices, like orange zest, there is no powdered
alternative, nor need there be. Add that one near the end of the boil 
for best results. And be aware that "oily" spices, like coriander, will
severely affect head retention and even bottle conditioning (carbonation)-
that is, really retard it!


Finally, I find it easier to control quantities with the powdered
versions. And believe me, they're *small* quantities! Nothing over 1 1/2
teaspoons goes in, some as little as 1/2 teaspoon!


On the subject of dry malt vs. syrup extract-I use only Munton & Fison
dry malt extract, have for 5 or 6 years, make great beer w/it, see no 
reason to change. Also, I buy it 55 lbs. at a time, to minimize cost.
I go w/their lightest variety, & use specialty grains for flavor/color.

Subject: 3.2 a/w, Spaten Hefe Weizen, Never mind the full grainers, d


Tom Colvin regrets that only 3.2 alc beer is available in
grocery stores in Utah.  2 points.  That is not unusual even in
more liberal states such as Minnesota.  In Indana 3.2 are
not sold, but grocery stores need a licence to sell beer,
and can't sell it chilled.  And nowhere can sell it on Sundays,
unlike in neighbouring states due to a bible belt part in
the south.  But at least it is cheaper than neighbouring states,
and we don't have an inane law like MI's 10cent return charge
(but why can't all beer sale laws and prices be like Wisconsin?).


3.2 is 3.2 by weight ~4% by volume, so it is not gruesomely weak.
It is stronger than many European table beers.


Spaten usually sell Hefe Weizen under the brand name, Fransiskaner,
which is readily available.  I cultured from it once, think I got
Krausen, but by the time I was ready to pitch, it was not lively and
the culture seemed to have a aa tart lactic acid flavor, so I used a
substitute (Fleischman's baking yeast - don't laugh the beer eventually
was award winning), but I suspect with proper sanitation it is a viable
yeast.


Never mind whole grain snobs, us decocters look down upon them with an
even more snobbish disdain - what they are too lazy to stir a thick
decoction and spend up to 8 hours mashing (but then I only do double
decoctions and I'm sure triple decocters think I'm ignorant and lazy,
and hop growers and barley malters think they're lazy, and people who
grow and harvest, and malt and mash their own barley and wheat and
irish moss look down on them).  


RE natural carbonation.  I have had a hard time priming lagers even
with sterile wort, canned from the batch.  The perfectly cleared lagered
beers have so few viable yeast cells that carbonations takes 3 weeks or
more.  I will just prime ales and will now krauesen lagers in future
(and us krauseners look down with a snobbish disdain on primers - even
those who prime with sterile wort and especially those who think they`re
krauseners because they`ve never read a book more advanced than Papazian's
work, which of course us advanced snobs know, incorrectly defines 
Krauesening).

If you read the Celebrator this may be old news to you, but a new 
magazine devoted to the technical side of homebrewing, pub-brewing
or microbrewing is about to make its debut.  Called "Brewing Techniques",
it will break new ground in homebrewing (as far as I know) by being
an honest-to-goodness "peer review" journal.  The Editorial Advisory
Board (the peers who do the reviewing) consists of Patrick Baker, Byron 
Burch, Fred Eckhardt, Teri Fahrendorf, George Fix, Terry Foster, 
Mary Anne Gruber, Dave Miller, Greg Noonan, David Ryder and Bill
Siebel.  Impressive!  The clear wort of usable brewing information
certainly seems unlikely to be beclouded by the trub of unsupported
speculation presented as fact, with a panel like that reviewing
submissions.


The magazine will be published 6 times a year, at a subscription price
of $30.  For an unspecified time there will be a $24 introductory
rate for "charter" subscribers.  To subscribe, send a note with your 
name and address information to:

The books I've read seem to disdain the use of Chinook for aroma and
bouquet.  I've used 'em for both bittering and aroma and don't recall
that the results were particularly good or bad.  The complaints are
harshness and poor storability, if I recall.


Centennial is far superior in my opinion.  Try dry-hopping with a
half and half mixture of German Hallertau and Centennial.  Fragrant,
fresh, and yummy.  Wow!

Subject: fining -> diacetyl


Lee M.,
   I'd vote that adding finings early on in the secondary is what is
causing the high diacetyl in your beer.  In fact, this is just what happens
with Samuel Smith beers, except their yeast flocs out because of the 
nature of their slate fermentation vessels.  Give the yeast more time
in suspension in the secondary to reduce the diacetyl.
   Another source of high diacetyl is low oxygen levels at the beginning
of the primary ferment.  If your ferments are slow or weak, and finish
with a high final gravity, this may also be adding to your problem.

A Beer Odyssey


I don't much like sweet beers.  The Brown Ale style is not one of my
favorites.  I'm not so much a hophead as I am a "malthead".  I like
beers heavy, fairly dry, and very well-balanced.  Bitter is fine,
flowery is right out.  (I point this out so you'll have a handle on my
perspective later on.  Beer with me!)


Having said that, one of the best beers I've ever tasted is Downtown
Brown Ale, from Lost Coast Brewing in Eureka.  It's just sweet enough,
with just the right level of hops; it's one of my favorite beers of all
time.


I had my first taste of Downtown Brown Ale at the 1992 Fort Mason Beer
Festival in San Francisco, and I've enjoyed it at a number of
festivals since then.  I had always determined to visit the brewery
and sample their beers firsthand, and one particular weekend in August
was finally the right time.  My plan:  drive from San Leandro to
Eureka on Saturday, visit Lost Coast in Eureka and Humboldt Brewing in
Arcata (as long as I'm there), spend the night in Eureka, and drive
home Sunday morning.  Simple enough.


The Friday before the trip, I met my friend Jake at Brewpub on the
Green in Fremont.  We talked about his recent trip to the Hockey Hall
of Fame in Toronto, we had a great dinner (they make some fine
hamburgers there, honest!), and we had a taste of all of their beers:


        Wheat - 4.0%.  Seems to be an American style, but hints of
                Bavarian (clove) character.  Maybe a wheat lager?
        Lager - 4.2%.  Same characteristics as Wheat, but not as
                sweet.
        Amber - 4.2%.  Nice color, fruity like an amber should be.
                Good stuff.  Very slight Irish moss (?) flavor.
        ESB - 6.0%.  Just like the Amber, only more so.  The alcohol
                really comes through in the flavor.
        Porter - 5.0%.  OK - rather light and benign.  ("Benign" being
                the opposite of "assertive".)


Like many of the microbreweries, the brewers at Brewpub on the Green have
really improved their beers over the last year or so.  So many
breweries were making...well, bad beer a year or two ago, and those
same breweries are making some of the best now.  Brewpub on the Green
is no exception.


At eight o'clock in the morning on Saturday, August 15, I got in my
trusty Cougar and hit the road.  I fought the early weekend Bay Area
traffic and headed north on US 101.  As usual, I skipped breakfast...
why should today be any different?  (Little did I know...) Around ten
o'clock, I was feeling mighty dry.  I checked my map for potential
lunchtime stops...and there it was!  Just an hour away - the Mendocino
Brewing Company of Hopland, California!  I had been there before...good
beer, good food, and most importantly today, perfectly placed for a
lunchtime respite!


I drove into Hopland around 10:45, just a few minutes before opening
time.  I waited in my car, checking my Celebrator and my map for any
more potential stops on the way to Eureka.  Hmmm...Anderson Valley is
out of the way, and North Coast is even further.  Too bad.


Magically, the clock struck eleven...it's opening time!  And would you
believe the added bonus:  it was the brewery's Ninth Anniversary.
The party started immediately; the barbecue was fired up, and the Eye
of the Hawk Ale was flowing.  There was a geezer at the bar (named
"Norm", appropriately enough) who claimed that he had been there every
day since the day the place opened.  There was a camera crew working on
a documentary of Northern California brewpubs.  I tell ya, the place was
hoppin'!  For lunch:  a barbecued buffalo steak, done to perfection.  I had
a round of samplers to go with my lunch:


        Peregrine - Thin, yellow.  Very light.  Certainly a good
                "transition" beer, useful for the re-education of
                drinkers of industrial beer.
        Blue Heron - Somewhat better.  Slightly more body and flavor,
                little aroma.
        Red Tail - OK amber ale.  Good color, flavor not as strong as
                it could be.  MUCH better on tap than bottled!
        Black Hawk - Good black thick roasty.  A little sweeter than I
                like, but good enough for serious quaffing!
        Eye of the Hawk - I need a pint of this to tell if I really
                like it.


My pint of the Eye of the Hawk Ale was really remarkable.  It's their
"special" ale, brewed only for special occasions like today.  It's an
outstanding, full-bodied ale, darker than the Red Tail, and with a
similar but much more assertive flavor.  It's too bad this is such a
rare beer.

I was at G.W. Kent on Saturday, so I asked them about hops plugs.
Randy said they had added them to their catalog this year, but then
were unable to get any from the supplier.  Something about a bad crop
this year.  So, G.W. Kent is not shipping hops plugs at this time.  If
you thought you got some with the G.W. Kent label, you must be
confused.  The only ones I've seen are imported by Crosby & Baker.


He also said that as far as he knows, any plugs on the market now must
be from the 1991 crop.  If this is true, then my experience with plugs
speaks very well for their keeping ability.  As I said yesterday, the
plugs I bought recently had the freshest hops I've ever used.

 A most enlightening article.  However, if this is in response to the

I believe another poster mentioned that the media which contains the

Well, it has been pointed out in many texts and in this forum, that there's
BIG difference between soap and detergent.  I'm not a chemist, so I don't
really know what that difference is (chemists, please chime-in and explain).

1. Steal the sugar from a restaurant packet by packet.
2. When the flavor of the brew prevents it from being consumed, add some

I suggest the Hops Special issue of Zymurgy -- in it there are photos of
virtually every common hop cone and it's corresponding leaf.  Since you
live in the Willamette Valley, I suggest that you make use of the wealth
of local knowledge.  Take some cuttings to a grower and ask them to
identify.  I'll bet that the big commercial facilities have extensive
libraries too.

I give each plant about 6.25 gallons of water every morning via a
timer-controlled soaker hose.  Water makes a big difference.  Initially,
I gave each hill (4: Hallertauer, Hersbrucker, Nugget and Willamette)
three 1 foot coils of soaker hose for 15 minutes per day.  I soon noticed
that the Willamette was doing much better than the Nugget, which was doing
better than the Hersbrucker, etc.  I noticed that the soaker hose was
spewing more at the near end than at the far end (I should have known).
After re-arranging the hose to give the far-end hills more hose, the
growth rate seems to have evened out.

If you pick too early or too late, you will not get as much AAU as if
you picked at the right time.  It seems to me that the general consensus
is that when the cones begin to feel light, springy and papery as opposed to
heavier, smushy and damp, it's time to pick.  I found that not all the
hops are ripe at one time.  I just set up a ladder and picked-off the ripe
ones once per week.


I've asked about low-tech ways to determine %AA and the only one I could
come up with is brew experimental batches and use your tastebuds.  If
someone knows how to determine %AA using simple chem, please post!

OK, some more opinions:


1) Why should it make a difference whether the spices are powdered or not, 
   as far as your question goes?  Does it assume that all the spices are 
   left in the brewpot and none get into the primary?


2) I am now firmly convinced that the only way to add spices is to "dry 
   spice", by adding the spices only to the secondary.  After all, we know 
   that the amount of flavor and aroma contributed by hops boiled a long 
   time is much less than that of hops boiled a short time or hops not 
   boiled at all (dry hopping).  Why should spices be different?  And since 
   I only use spices for flavor and aroma, I dry spice.


Did a real nice job on my Pumpkin Pie Ale.  Plus, you don't have to use 
powdered spices if you don't want to, just let them sit longer in the 
secondary.

To the best of my memory, every source I've read says that Chimay is
brewed from a single yeast strain.  It has been widely publicised
that Father Theodore was the man who isolated Chimay's current
fermentation yeast and really cleaned up the beer.  I've read
somewhere, perhaps the bottle, that Chimay adds yeast during bottling
- -- I recall that there was no mention from this source of whether
the yeast added at bottling time is the same as the fermentation yeast
or different.  Nor do I recall if they mentioned filtering out the
fermentation yeast.  The bottling yeast may be the same as the
fermentation yeast since maintaining two strains of yeast is twice
as hard as maintaing one and it's not like the bottling yeast in
Chimay is a particularly good flocculator (like SNPA's yeast is).


Orval is brewed from a single yeast also, but then bottled with a
mixture of 5 yeast strains.  My source is one of the Jackson books
(either the pocket guide or the New World Guide to Beer... I suspect
the latter).  I feel, from my experiments, that one of the 5 bottling
strains is the fermentation strain, the one that produces the
characteristic banana/bubblegum nose of Orval.  


Another multi-strain yeast is Whitbread.  George Fix wrote this quite
a while ago that Whitbread is a three-strain yeast.  My cousin has noted
that along with the change in bottles, Whitbread Ale has lost that
characteristic "dark bread" flavor.  I have yet to verify this.  Anyone
else notice this? Note that Wyeast #1098 bears a striking resemblence to
Whitbread yeast ;^).

Subject: Malting Wheat


Does anyone out there know anything about malting wheat?


I buy (unmalted) whole wheat (for baking purposes) for about 15 cents
a pound.  Looking at this the other day, I thought I could make some
decent Weizen if I could maybe get a small batch of the wheat malted.
In addition to expanding my skills as a brewer, this would save me a
bundle over what my homebrew supplier charges for malted wheat (about
$1.50 per pound - an order of magnitude higher!) 
Anyway, I tried malting a little the other day, and found it hard to
determine when the grain was fully modified.  The "steely-mealy" test
(mentioned, I believe, by Miller) does not seem to work here. The
grain, when wet, is soft and mealy, but is completely steely when
dried. I even tried mashing several ounces of this malted wheat in a
"micro-micro" mash tun (along with about 33% 6-row barley malt), but
got very poor conversion.


Does anyone have any experience with this, or know any good references?
Email me, and I'll post any significant/interesting information, as
well as let you know if I have any success with this. (Or does
anyone else really care?)

Subject: BBW wins again!


Here's an update on the Sam Adams vs Boston Beer Works nonsense.


Jim Koch (dba Boston Beer Company, aka Sam Adams) lost his appeal in
Federal District Court.  Koch has the right to appeal again, and given
his attitude he is likely to do so.  His lawsuit against the
Commonwealth Brewing Co is still pending. 


I wasn't at the trial, but I heard that Koch presented witnesses who
claimed to have gone to the BBW, disliked the beer, and blamed it on the
BBC.  Under cross-examination they were all discredited.  One admitted
to being too drunk to remember any details of the visit.  Another
objected to a 'foul aroma' which turned out to be the smell of a batch
being brewed (something Sam Adams fans generally have to go to Pittsburg
to experience).  Like the original suit, the ruling on the appeal was
quick and decisive; Jim Koch does not own the word "Boston". 


So what happened to me?


Koch never followed up on the subpoena they served me.  We had to
reschedule it, and they never got back to me with a new date.  I think
they lost interest when it became obvious that I am not an employee or
representative of the Beer Works or the Sunset Grill, and that I was
hostile and well-prepared.  I got to keep the $46 federal witness fee,
and Koch had to spend some money to file & serve the subpoena, so I did
my part to waste Koch's money. 


I am still boycotting Sam Adams products, and I urge you all to do the
same.  Since Koch has introduced more lawsuits than beer styles in the
last year, I think it is safe to say that the Boston Beer Company is a
law firm and does not deserve to call itself a brewery.


I want to thank you all once again for your letters of encouragement and
outrage.  I had intended to keep them all in defiance of Koch's subpoena
of my personal correspondence, but I ran out of disk space and had to
delete them. 


By the way, I never heard from the person who is forwarding my posts to
Koch.  I am not surprised.  It is obvious that the weasel doesn't have
the spine to stand up for his/her own actions, typical for a Koch crony. 


To Koch & his email droid: You are both losers, and the brewing
community would be better off without you.  I will continue to publicly
criticize your business practices, and encourage consumers to boycott
your products.


I am thinking of starting a new brewery, "The Adams Family Boston
Brewing Company".  Any interested investors? Any interested attorneys?


(for those who recently tuned into the HBD: Jim Koch has taken to suing
any brewery that uses the word "Boston" in the company name or on any of
their products.  I, and all my personal correspondence referring to
local breweries were subpoenaed by Koch in his appeal against the Boston
Beer Works.  I have no affiliation with the BBW except as a satisfied
customer and friend of the owners.  The subpoena was pure harassment
meant to stifle my outspoken public criticism of Koch & Co.)

BINGO.  That's your problem, IMO.  I feel that you don't have to add
the finings to generate CO2 production -- by the time you are transfering
to the secondary you already have some C02 dissolved in the beer.  When
the beer travels over the top of the siphon hose (just past the highest point)
it is at slightly a lower pressure and some of the CO2 will come out of
solution, taking up your head space.  Another method, is to use your
kegging setup to squirt a bit of CO2 into the secondary before racking.
It's heavier than air and will minimize oxidation *during* transfer too.
