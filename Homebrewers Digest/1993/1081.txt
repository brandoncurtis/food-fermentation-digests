Subject: Re: Corn Sugar in Root Beer


Mike Gildner asks about using corn sugar in root beer.  I've used corn
sugar and Equal(tm) [asparatame] to make diet root beer for a friend's
father who is diabetic.  We used four cups (about a pound +/-) of corn
sugar and a huge number of packets of Equal following the substitution
directions.  It worked fine and was rated as better than store-bought.


Homebrewed soft drinks contain very little alcohol, since the CO2 stomps
the yeast after it reaches a certain level.  I've also made root beer and
force carbonated it in a 5-gal soda keg.


I don't know what the store-bought root beers use to increase the richness
of the mouth feel.  Small amounts of glycerine or Irish moss (carageenan)
are possibilities, but I don't know of anyone who has published recipes
for full-bodied root beer.

Subject: Micah's magical yeast starters


For a very short review, Micah advocated using powdered sugar for yeast
starters with some Difco nutrient. His claims of greater yeast growth got
all interested. I too have used this growth technique for a while with no
big obvious problems.


Now for the update.....


I recently decided to compare the two yeast starter techniques. The two
techniques being, standard starter (DME and water) and powdered sugar
starter. I split a 10 gallon batch of wort for comparison. Both starters
were the same gravity (1020) and volume and the yeast was the same (1028).
The two batches were fermented side by side at the same temp. I feed both
starters the morning of brew day. The powdered sugar starter (PSS) seemed to
generate much more yeast than the DME starter. The activity in the PSS was
almost zero through the whole growth phase, compared to the DME starter that
looks like a normal mini-fermentation. This is a bit troubling when you
observe the two side by side. I pitched them both and waited. The next
morning the DME starter batch was at high krausen, the PSS had no sign of
fermentation. The PSS started several hours later. The DME batch stopped
fermentation at about 3 days, and the PSS continued for several more days.
The terminal gravities were measured at about 1 week. The DME batch had
better attenuation than the PSS batch. The PSS batch never reached as low a
terminal gravity as the DME batch after several weeks. I have now kegged
them separately and will taste and continue my comparisons. My opinion at this
point in time is that although there may be much more yeast growth with a
PS starter the results when compared to a standard DME starter may not be
what one desires. I mentioned all this to Micah and he said it could be due
to the lack of Difco nutrient in the PSS. I don't think so. He thought the
results were interesting, too. He agrees now that PSS may not be so good.
Personally I am going back to DME starters, and don't recommend PS starters.
I'll post the taste off results when their all in.

Subject: yeast nutrition




Ok, say I want to make a quickish mead, but I don't
have any yeast nutrients.


I know that malt extracts have the required goodness.


How many lbs of malt extract would I need to add to the
boil (for a 5 gallon or 1 gallong batch) 
so that the yeast will be happy enough
to ferment in a reasonable amount of time?




I was thinking of maybe 1 lb honey and 1 lb extract per gallon
of water.  And using Champagne yeast.
Maybe 1lb honey and 1/2 lb extract per gallon will be
good enough?
Or three lbs honey and 1 lb extract for two gallons?

I have lots of these rollers.  I got them from a local conveyor manufacture
for $5/ea (or may it was $3.50...) anyway they would be a BAD choice for
roller mills.  A: they are welded thinwall pipe and do not roll true enough
for any kind of milling.  B: they have internal bearings, so there is no
decent way to drive them.


Try "Bearings Inc" - you can get conveyor belt drive ends (e.g. shaft driven,
not bearing rolling) 4"dia, 10" wide for $44/each.  They are custom built
because you don't want a crown on your roller mill.  The one I had priced
out included built in hubs.  That is cheaper than the standard rollers with
two-piece hubs.  They also had a precision roller (machined), but I didn't 
bother pricing it out.  I figured I could true up the standard rollers if
needed.


The company that actually makes the rollers is Van Gorp, in Iowa.
1-800-Van-Gorp  You want to specify a "Finish Bore Drum Conveyor Pulley"
And you want it "straight faced" not "crowned".

Subject: Refrigerators


Over the past year I have thrown away almost half of the
beer I've brewed, which is a bummer of such magnitude that
only a homebrewer can understand.  This has been due to the
high temperatures in our house, which typically range from
74-76 degrees F.  I can say from long, sad experience that
this imparts some highly undesirable flavors to beer,
(particularly high-gravity brews), and I have the bottles to
prove it.  We have no control over this heat, which comes
from the various steam pipes located throughout the floors
and walls.  Nor do we have a basement.


In one of those saint-like gestures sometimes made by
spouses of homebrewers, my wife has given me permission to
look for a refrigerator I could use for brewing. 
(Presumably this would be used in a conjunction with a
Hunter Airstat or similar device).


The problem--and the reason for her saintliness--is that our
house is quite small, and there is absolutely no
inconspicuous place to put a fridge.  We will have to live
with this thing constantly in our faces.  I am therefore
looking for the smallest possible (presumably dorm-type)
refrigerator that can hold a carboy with airlock.  I'll buy
new if necessary, as I am desperate.


Are any of you familiar with refrigerator models that are
currently available, or were available not long ago, that
fit this bill?

I tried adding some 88% lactic acid from GW Kent (I double checked to
make sure I had the right source this time) to my dry stout a few weeks
ago.  It tasted great.  The only side effect was that I passed out
after 5 pints and woke up with every muscle in my body sore as hell...

The mash probably also stayed too hot.  It needs to get into the
80-100 F range.  Then it will take only a few hours to sour appreciably.

The Imperial stout comes in a clear bottle and 50% of the time I
buy it, it is light-struck (skunky).  I don't drink much of the taddy
porter.

I loved the Dark Ale.  The following is palate-subjective, but it
seemed to have just enough diacetyl without seeming stale to taste
good (not that a beer needs diacetyl, but this one used it to its
flavor advantage, as do Smith's and (possibly too much) Young's). 


On the subject of staleness, try comparing a bottle of 1992 Thomas
Hardy's to a 1991 version...

Dock street amber was by far my favorite beer that BAA distributed

Assuming he doesn't object, I'd like to see a copy of the score sheet...

Okay, so there's nothing very extraordinary on the list, but it's
free beer (the best kind) and it's an opportunity to compare a
number of respectable commercial beers, side-by-side.  Actually,
the purpose of this tasting is to get some Beck's or Sam Adams (boo)
drinkers to be more adventurous.  Mainstreet normally does wine
tastings on Saturdays from 2 to 8, but this is their first beer
tasting.  Hopefully the turnout will be good, the owners will he
impressed and will do this more often, maybe next time with 11 Belgian
Lambiks!

Jon,  in answer to your request:


Mark and I brewed the maple ale on Labor Day so I don't recall the details of
the recipe.  I'll pull out my logbook when I get home tonight and give you 
the actual recipe tomorrow. 


If I remember right, we used half a quart of dark amber maple syrup.  The end
result was a pretty dry beer with a thin body.  I really liked it even though
it didn't turn out like we intended (a maple flavored PALE ALE).  The maple 
flavor was definitely there, but you can bend your brain trying to imagine what
maple syrup tastes like without the sugur.  


I think the maple sugur ferments out almost completely, and even seems to 
increase the overall attenuation.  The recipe was based on other pale ales 
we had done (which had real pale ale gravities and body).  The next
maple ale we do will have more crystal malt and maybe some carapils (going for 
more body).  Does anyone have any recommendations?


As for the Cat's Meow recipies, I have a hard copy and I can get it via FTP 
(read the daily HBD header for more info) but maybe someone who already has 
an electonic copy can volunteer to cut out the relevant recipies and E-mail 
them to you (southard`at`biology.UCSC.EDU).

I agree, that the word `Red' sounds unauthentic and that the lager
Coors makes likely bears little resemblance to anything that may have
been brewed in Ireland in years gone by.


That said Irish Red _ALE_ (yes ALE) seems to be an emerging American
style, based on recent offerings at a variety of microbreweries.
Ironically, Guy McDonnell mentioned one in the article immediately
below AL's post!  I posted here in January about the Chicago Brewing
Company's Legacy Irish Ale.  I find it a very tasty brew.  It is both
darker and more bitter than Killians'.  It's brewed in Chicago, Al;
you must have tried it.  The blurb on the bottle says Irish immigrant
brewers brewed in this style in 19th century Chicago.  It's certainly a
plausible tale.

I can't imagine too many people really want to duplicate Killian's
when they can brew somthing with more character.  Here's my suggestion,
based on my memory of Legacy Red Ale and my experience using smallish
amounts of more hightly roasted malts in pale ales:


 pale ale malt or pale malt extract for OG of about 1050
   (for extract recipes with attenuative yeast, include 1 # crystal,
    for all-grain with attenuative yeast, mash at a warmer temperature)
 2 ounces roasted barley (up to 3 if no crystal is used)
 Bittering hops for 30 IBU (CBS uses Chinook)
 Fuggles or Willamette to finish (CBS uses Willamette)
 Wyeast Irish yeast or a reliable dried yeast

Chuck Cox had a great suggestion for paying retribution to Jim Koch's (Sam
Adams) bad legal habits.  John Adams thought that, being born an Adams, he
could not be denied use of the name.  He's wrong, unless the law has changed in
the14 years since I visited the Bully Hill Winery on the Finger Lakes of New
York.
  During the tour of Bully Hill, I noticed that there were many paintings in
the tasting room signed by an artist named Walter S. ____; that is, the last
name was obliterated.  The same obliterated name was seen on various signs
around the winery giving inspiration to the workers about quality control and
the like.  I asked about this and was told that the owner was named Walter S.
Taylor, and he was a descendant of the founder of Taylor Wines.  Taylor Wines
had been acquired by Coca-Cola (Koch? could it be??) (or was it Pepsico?), and
they had obtained an injunction prohibiting Walter Taylor from using the Taylor
name in the marketing of Bully Hill wines.  So... Walter complied with the
order to the absurd limit.
  Bully Hill also produced bumper stickers stating:  "Drink Bully Hill wines --
the UN-Taylor"  (remember the 7-Up Un-cola campaign?)

Subject: The Taste of Dextrose




How many of you out there have tasted the corn dextrose that comes
in 50-lb bags?


Now, pure glucose is mildly sweet, and essentially tasteless otherwise.
But this stuff tastes like, well, wallpaper paste.  When I added 3
grams to a glass of water the taste was still distinct, though probably
threshold at best in beer.


Is it ALL like this?


Another argument for using sucrose or some other seriously refined
sugar for priming.  Or, <sigh>, malt extract.

Subject: Semi-beginner question


On the heels of Chuck's survey, I've got a semi-beginner question.  Would adding
rolled oats to a brew (a porter in this case) have any desireable effect if it
were used like other adjunct grains?  In other words, if I add a half pound of
rolled oats to 2 gal of water, bring it to a boil and remove the oats would
there be any useful result?  Unfortunately, I'm not set up to mash, hence my
question...  Thanks for any answers!

I have been thinking about the problem of contamination of yeast cultures by
wild yeasts and would like to ask a couple of questions.
1. If you had the possibility to test for wild yeast contamination, say with a
   kit of some sort, would it be still worthwhile if you had no means to get
   rid of those nasties (other then dumping the contaminated stock)?
2. How often does the problem occur in your homebrewing enterprise?

Just a few data points on Steve Tollefsrud's post, based on experience. 
My background is 10 years brewing extract kits, now two years all-grain.


I agree with Steve that extract brewing can keep a brewer just as occupied 
juggling with ingredients. Extract can beat all-grain in competitions. 
It's easier, quicker and requires less kit. Why do I prefer all-grain? 
Because all-grain consistently produces better beers for me than extract.
Maybe I'm such a useless brewer I can't get a good beer out of extract.

I think it was only Jack, who admits he sometimes puts his foot in his 
mouth. Best thing is to count ten and forget it. Mail direct if you must.

Disagree totally here. Factory extract in my experience is markedly 
inferior to wort extracted at home or brewery. Probably due to the 
processing required to eliminate the water. Far from being less 
significant, I consider it to be the _most_ significant factor in poorer 
flavour compared to all-grain. Only differences in hop rates come near to 
affecting taste as much. This is why it is essential to use the very best 
quality extract if you want to beat all-grain brews in competitions.

It's not my reason, and I doubt it is a common reason. Greater scope for 
experimenting maybe, and even that's debatable. As Steve says, all you do 
is throw more variables in the pot. I use all-grain, as said before, 
because it tastes _far_ better. That's the main reason I switched and the 
only reason I prefer it. Ah! that taste!

Whilst the "grain vs. extract" argument can be taken too far, I must
admit I agree with the instant coffee analogy.  After all, both
instant coffee and malt extract are concentrated forms of the original
substance. 


I brewed with extract for about 5 years before trying my first
all-grain brew, and since then I haven't looked back. I could say the
same about using instant and ground coffee, and also about
from-concentrate vs. freshly-squeezed orange juice.  In all three
cases, IMHO, the concentrated product lacks the clean, "zesty" quality
of the original.  The basic flavour is present, and about right, but it
seems somehow to be dulled.  I've an idea that this difference is
rather more important than any _additional_ flavours that may be
introduced by the concentrating process. 


OK, malt [extract] is only one ingredient, and not the major one for
flavouring purposes, but good fresh malt _does_ make a big
contribution to the taste.  I've drunk some fine beers made from
extract - and some dreadful all-grain brews.  But my own experience
with homebrew is that it's been well worth the change, if only to hear
from fellow imbibers the comment "this doesn't taste like homebrew,
it's just like <some commercial real ale>".

At the request of a few people, here's my chocolate porter recipe
that Sandy was bragging on a fwew issues back (blush):




3 lbs laaglander light dry malt
3 lbs laaglander amber dry malt
1/4 lb black patent malt
1/2 lb chocolate malt
2 1/4 lbs xtal malt (i had 32 deg lovibond laying around; 40 deg would be ok)
1/2 lb cara-pils
24 tablespoons cocoa powder


1 oz Northern Brewer hops (6.8% alpha), boiled 1 hour
1 oz Willamette (alpha not recorded) at finish of boil


Yeast was Whitbread dry ale yeast in a 1 qt starter


Steeped cracked grains in grain bag in 5 qts 160 deg F water.  Strained.
Brought water volume to 6 gallons, added dry malt, boiled one hour.
Chilled with immersion chiller, racked to primary, pitched yeast starter.


OG 1064  FG not recorded.  Bottled with 3/4 cup corn sugar to prime.


The beer was great tasting from the beginning, but after a month in the
bottle, the hop bitterness had diminished, allowing the chocolate
bitterness to come thru.  The beer was very rich and thick with a creamy
tan head.


My wife is a confirmed chocoholic (and porter lover), and is bugging
me to brew another batch.

>


Answers:
        1.  No, remember there are few hard and fast rules when it comes to 
             making homebrew.  My typical fermentation schedule is this:
             Brew and get the primary going on Saturday ... active fermentation
             by Sunday.  Then I normally rack (transfer) to the secondary the 
             next Saturday.  Then I bottle the following Saturday.  So ....
7 days
             in the primary and 7 days in the secondary.  Racking to the 
             secondary gets the beer off the trub and hops and dead yeast and
             appears to allow much more yeast to flocculate ... this means
             clearer beer in the bottle with much less sediment in the bottle.


        2.  It is important that you minimize the aeration at this stage.  The
             dissolved O2 from aeration will lead to premature staling of 
             your beer.  All you need to do is get the secondary end of the 
             racking tube (I use 3/8 tubing) under the surface of the beer as
             soon as possible.


        3.  Yes, there will be a lot of 'good' yeast left behind but you will 
             also leave behind a lot of dead yeast, trub (break material) and
             spent hop material.  Don't worry, there is plenty of yeast in 
             suspension that will carry over into the secondary.

Answers:
        First, once the fermentation is over, its beer, carbonated or not.
        1.  The normal priming method is this:  boil and cool 3/4 cup 
             corn sugar (or 1 to 1 1/4 cup dried malt extract, I never use 
             liquid extract, too hard to measure at this level) in 1 cup 
             water.  Place this sugar solution in the bottom of a clean and 
             sanitized 5 gal carboy (or what ever you use for a bottling 
             container) and rack the beer from your secondary onto this
             sugar solution, again, with as little aeration as possible.
             The sugar solution will go into solution with the beer with 
             no difficulty.  Bottle and enjoy a week or two later.


        2.  See 1


        3.  See 1


        4.  First, I would reccomend that you use unhopped extract (it 
             is difficult to predict the hopping rate in extracts) and hop
             the wort yourself.  This way you get the hop rate YOU like 
             and you get to use the variety of hops that are pleasing to 
             YOU.  The amount of DME (dried malt ecxtract?) that you 
             would need depends on the kind of beer that you want to 
             make.  For my 'normal' ales I like an OG of around 1.045,
             and I usually end up using 6-7 lbs of extracts (I like the 
             Northwestern extracts) total.

Subject: Aeration


I think this was in the gadgets issue of Zymurgy (maybe it was even
posted here months ago), but it's a neat idea that bears repeating.
It's not original to me, anyway.


I'm one of those who likes to rack (siphon) from the boiling pot into
my primary fermenter (maybe because it's hard to pour into the neck of
a carboy from a big pot).  I made a neat gadget that automagically
aerates the (cooled!) wort as it's siphoning.  I took some 3/8 OD copper
tubing (left over from building wort chiller, sparging manifold, etc.)
and cut a piece just slightly taller than the inside height of my
carboy.  A couple of inches down from the top (far enough down so it's
inside the neck of the carboy) I drilled four 1/16" holes.  I filed
notches in the bottom with a triangular file (this prevents it from
sitting flat on the bottom of the carboy and stopping the flow).  I
then insert this into the end of my racking tube, put it in the
carboy, and siphon.  The Bernoulli effect (knew that physics class
would come in handy some day) sucks air in through the holes, and it
gets well mixed with the wort.  Makes a nice head of bubbles in the
carboy, too.


Assuming you've got some copper tubing lying around, it's free and
easy.  Even if you don't, a couple of feet of tubing will cost you
maybe a buck?

Subject: Birmingham Brewing Tour (part III)


    Last we were taken into the cold storage room filled with kegs, cases of
bottled beer, and the unmistakable aroma of hops.  I thought I'd died and gone
to heaven.  John then took us back to the front of the brewery (a long walk of
perhaps 100 feet), pointed out some cups and two taps and said "help 
yourselves".  They had the golden ale and gold lager on tap.  There was no red
ale on tap because they didn't have any in kegs at the time.  I'll have to
recant my previous opinion of the golden ale.  I have had it in bottles here
in Huntsville and said that it was "good but nothing special".  After trying
it fresh at the brewery, I'll have to say that it is quite good.  It had a
wonderful hop aroma and flavor, balanced by good malt taste and topped off with
a creamy head.  The lager was very smooth and quite good as well.  John likened
it more to a Dortmunder style than a pils.  Being an ale man, I can't comment
on that comparison.


    I asked if he would tell me what was in the red ale, without giving away 
the farm of course.  He said they use 2-row, Munich, Caramel, and a "small
amount" of Chocolate malts in the brew.  The chocolate is there primarily to
add texture and complexity rather than color as that is derived from the
caramel malt.  Clusters are used for bittering with Fuggles and Cascades used
for flavor and aroma.


    When asked about brewing other types of beer he said he'd love to do a 
stout or a porter but they were afraid that it wouldn't sell here.  They do 
plan to brew a Christmas Ale of some sort this year and are, as yet, uncertain
as to whether it would be available only in Birmingham or in all markets.  
Their beer is currently available throughout Alabama in the "major" cities 
such as Birmingham, Huntsville, Decatur, Mobile, Montgomery, etc.  He wasn't 
sure how much of it made it into "outlying areas" as they deal only with 
distributors.  It is also available in some parts of Georgia and they are soon
going to have it in the Florida panhandle.


    Red Mountain Red will be in next month's Beer Across America shipment and
John was quite honored by that as they are such a new brewery.  He showed us
the last of 3200 cases on their way to the BAA people.


    They are migrating to twist-top bottles since the ones they use are not
returnable anyway.  This had an unexpected benefit to us as he gave us a half
case of the red ale and a half case of the golden ale to split from their trial
bottling runs.  That fresh red ale is something else indeed!


    John is justifiably proud of the brewery.  He says that, while it is quite
small in comparison to most others, "there are no finer micros anywhere, all
of the equipment is first-rate".


    Quite an enjoyable tour, particularly since I'd never seen the inside of
a brewery before.  John said that he is happy to give tours of virtually any
size, preferring those in the range of 1 - 4 people.  Larger tours are also
welcome but are not as "personal".  Just call to make sure he will be in and 
will have the time to show you around.  The address and phone number:

All Homebrewers:


Recently, I found a raspberry wheat beer in a fermenter that I forgot about. 
Please no flames--I know "stupid"!  Any way, it is about 7 months old and the
air lock appears to still be intact.  What I was wondering is if any one has 
had an experience like this and what did they do?  Did you bottle it any way? 
Did it turn out ok?  How might have using fruit changed this?


Any answers would be appreciated, but flames would not!  There seems to have 
been an extradonary number of flames for people who have valid questions to 
this group, we as a group should be more understanding and unless we have

Subject: is it too late for the secondary?


Greetings-
    I tried a partial mash of 1/2 lb. chocolate malt (crushed with a 
mortar and pestle) with a lager extract, and lacking a wort chiller, poured 
the hot wort and the hot break (out of ignorance) through a strainer and 
into a 5 gal. carboy with 3 gal. of water.  I let the cold water in the 
carboy cool the wort and pitched my yeast soon afterward.  (My milling 
"technique" had produced some powdery grains as well as granular grain 
fragments) .  The latest posts in the HBD have given me some concern about my 
crude methods.  Question- Has all the harm been done?  Should I bother 
racking to a secondary ASAP to get the wort away from the hot/cold break 
which formed a 1 inch layer on the bottom of my carboy?  The yeast is just 
now producing CO2 (very slowly) after 2 days of no activity at 65-70^F.  
Not worrying- just learning.
