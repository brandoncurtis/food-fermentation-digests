Subject: Why does my beer smell like bubble gum?




A few questions for those with more homebrewing experience:


1)  Why does my homebrew smell like bubblegum?  This is my third
    batch; I used the following ingredients:


        7 lb. container of Steinbart's Light liquid malt extract
        0.5 lb. dried light malt extract
        1 lb. crushed crystal malt
        1.5 oz cascade pellet hops (60 min)
        0.5 oz cascade hop pellets (10 min)
        1.2 oz cascade hop flowers (1 min)
        2 tsp gypsum
        0.5 tsp salt
        1 qt. Wyeast 1056 starter


    I put 1.5 gallons distilled water in a stainless pot.  I steeped the
    crystal malt about 30 min as the water was heating up, then 
    removed before full boil.  Added extracts, salt, gypsum, boiling
    hops, then aroma hops as indicated.  Placed boiling pot into sink
    full of ice cubes and chilled to ~80 degrees F.  Poured into carboy,
    without attempting to strain out pellet hop residue.  Topped with
    presumably sterile bottled water.  Pitched yeast solution when I felt
    that the wort had cooled to room temp.


    The next morning, about 12 hours after pitching, there was noticable
    activity. 36 hours after pitching, the fermentation was furious, and
    had actually churned up the trub into suspension.  BTW, I used a 
    blow-off tube.


    After 10 days, I bottled with 0.75 C corn sugar.  7 days after
    bottling, I tried one.  Carbonation was OK, but the beer smelled
    of bubblegum.  My wife thinks it smells like licorice, but to me
    it smells like a fresh package of Bazooka Joe.


    Does anyone know why this happened?  I realize that I haven't given
    it very long in the bottle.  I seem to remember reading about this
    phenomenon somewhere before, but I haven't been able to find it.




2)  I would really like to replicate Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  I really
    like its hoppy aroma.  My second batch of homebrew (recipe almost
    exactly that given for batch #3, above) had good hop aroma, but it
    disappeared after about 1 - 2 weeks.  The above batch has almost
    no hop aroma; maybe it is masked by the bubble gum scent.


    Why can't I get this nice hop aroma?  I have a few ideas:


        a) My hops are not fresh enough.


        b) boiling bag reduces hop aroma extraction


        c) I need to dry hop the beer


        d) Hop aroma carried off during blow-off 


    If anyone can help me out here, I would appreciate it.




Thanks a lot for your help.

   I asked if anyone had tried the Abbey Beer kit by "Brew Werk".  Of
course I meant "Brew Ferm" as you probably guessed.  Not such a good
showing for my first HBD intervention:(.
   Say did anyone catch The Simpsons last Thursday, the only show that
tells the truth about America?  Case in point: Homer skipped out of work to
go on the tour of the "Duff" brewery.  The guide boasted about Duff, Duff
Lite, and new Duff Dry.  The three huge tanks with those brands on them
were being filled, all out of the same mega-pipe.  If you don't look at the
show, reconsider. No I don't work for Fox.

Subject: Carbonation w/ Dry Ice?


I think this was rehashed some time ago, but I missed the discussion.  
Anyway, a friend and I have decided to try homebrewing and would like to 
brew a bier that we could share with our friends.  Unfortunately, most of our
friends would be turned off by a bier with "bugs" floating around in it.  So
we were wondering if we could carbonate our bier with dry ice.  We were 
thinking of putting some in the bier at bottling time.  The dry ice should
sublimate directly into solution with the bier.  Might take some experimentation
to find the dosage, but what do you think?


Thanx in advance.

When in London the best beers are Fullers and Youngs. Fullers is brewed in 
Chiswick and is common in West London, Youngs is brewed in Wandsworth
and common in south west London. The (once) good chain of "Firkin" (as in a
Firkin good pint) brewpubs eg Phoenix & Firkin, Frog & Firkin etc are also 
worth trying.


Try the following pubs:


Anglesea Arms, South Kensington
County Arms, Wandsworth
Dove, Hammersmith
Hand in Hand, Wimbledon
Orange Tree, Pimlico (brewpub)
Princess Louise, Holborn
Spotted Cow, Putney
Thatched House, Hammersmith
White Cross, Richmond
Windmill, Clapam Common


Get copies of CAMRA publications:
Good Beer Guide (national coverage, available in bookshops)
various local guides (available from CAMRA and some local bookshops)
London Drinker Magazine (available in some pubs, eg Dove and Anglesea)


Also Good Pub Guide (avaliable in bookshops), as good beers and good pubs 
don't necessarily go together. CAMRA often recommends good beer in grotty 
pubs. Only if both guides recommend it can the place be a certain hit.

Line, Wheeler and the notes that came with my hydrometer say not so. Stir 
the brew remove density layers, twirl the hydrometer to shake off bubbles 
below the surface, read the bottom of the meniscus. and remember to correct 
for temperature.


Surface bubbles clinging to the scale obscuring it are a real pain. Does 
anyone have suggestions for preventing this? I always blow a hole on the 
surface and keep blowing gently to stop more bubbles collecting, but it 
can't be good for hygiene.

Subject: Sierra Nevada Bock?


Well I did the dirty deed this weekend:  My first all grain batch (batch
number 25).  The recipe was supposed to be SNPA:


        10   lb  British Pale Ale Malt
        0.5  lb  British Crystal Malt (50 L)
        1     oz  Perle (8.1%)
        1/2 oz  Cascade Whole Hops - Flavor
        1     oz  Cascade Whole Hops - To Be Dry Hopped Next Week
        500 ml  Starter of WYeast 1056


Mashed the pale ale malt and crystal in 13 quarts treated (i.e. boiled) 
water at 150 F for 1.5 hr in a 10 gal Gott with a Phils Phalse Bottem.


Sparged with 4+ gal acidified (1/8 tsp "acid blend") to pH = 5.5 water at 
170 F.  Sparged to 6.5 gal.  The gravity at 6.5 gal was 1053.  This
implies:


        (53 pts) X (6.5gal) / 10.5 lbs  =  32.8 pts/lb/gal !


When boiled to 5.5 gal and racked to primary that yields an OG of 62.6.
What should I call this stuff?  Sierra Nevada Potent Ale? 


Anyway, the mash went very well.  The temperature drop was only 
two degrees over the 1.5 hrs (I preheated the Gott).  Now sparging,
that is another story.  I was somewhat overwhelmed by the 
sparging:  I kept drawing off wort and recirculating it but it 
never seemed to clear the way I expected it.  I finally said to hell
with it and ran off the initial wort and proceded to sparge 
with water to 6.5 gal.  There was still good sugar in the sparge 
at this point.   What is the lowdown on sparging?  How much do 
YOU recirculate?  Am I needlessly worrying?


All in all, an interesting adventure and it went much easier than
I expected.  Maybe Sierra Nevada Helles Bock?

I located some 3/4" round labels that are designed for use on
a laser printer; unfortunatly they seemed EXTREMELY expensive
at $15 a box but I don't recall how many labels were in a box.


I've used this size label before by writing on them and then
sticking them on  the caps; no mess on the bottle!  It seems
that with the proper font you could get beer name and possibly
bottling date or other info.

     Hello all.  Most of my previous brews have been fermented in
five gallon glass carboys used as primary fermenters followed by
secondary fermentation in another glass carboy.  Since I have
always been somewhat bothered about the quart or two loss of beer
from the blowoff of the primary fermenter, I recently invested in
a 6.5 gallon glass carboy.
     
     Since my new primary has a larger headspace, I do not get any
lost due to blowoff.  The beer that I have subsequently produced
have been good, but now I find that it has a tad more of a bitter
"bite" than before (but this only means a slightly longer aging
time before consuming the brew).  Any suggestions as to how to
remove the scummy resinous brown globs that float on the foam in a
sanitary fashion?  (Yes, I do believe that the blowoffs
from my previous setup remove the "nasties" and hence yield a
smoother beer.)


               Eagerly awaiting your suggestions, 


               Dan "Sven" Yee

Subject: Fermenter geometry


During my discussion with Pierre Celis, the subject of fermenter
geometry came up. He mentioned that the head or foam cap in a shallow open
fermenter was much more dense and stable than one in a closed smaller
fermenter. He said he don't understand it either. I know when I visit Anchor
and see their fermentations at high krausen I am only getting a snap shot of
the fermentation. Say Russ, when you've walked by that room several nites in
a row, have you EVER seen that foam fall? I don't know how any of this would
apply to us, it is just an interesting observation and may explain how open
fermentation can be safe in some cases.

Subject: More yeast when bottling cold lagers


After many successful Ales, I decided to try my hand at a true 
lager:  basic extract/crystal malt oktoberfest recipe with Wyeast
Bavarian liquid yeast.  Its been in the secondary for about a month
at 40-45F.  Do I need to add more yeast when I bottle it?  Some
folks around here say I should, others say that lager yeasts like the cold 
and will be ready to go as soon as I add in priming sugar and
give a stir.


One more data point: I'm dry hopping with a whole plug of hallertauer,
which is floating in a mass at the top of the fermenter.  Will
this act to precipitate yeast out of solution?


       -will

Andy Rowen asks about laser printer labels. 
I always use a laser printer to print my labels, but I don't use Avery
lables.  I use post-consumer recycled paper (i.e. the other side of
previously printed upon sheets!).  I print 8 to a sheet and cut on
a paper cutter, and stick to the bottles with a glue stick.  They
stay stuck on but come off easily when you want them to.

In HBD 1082 Andy Rowan asks about beer labels for laser printers.


3M (No I don't own stock in them), makes at least one kind of 8 1/2 X 11 
laser printer label.  Its adhesive is the post-it note kind, i.e., 
removeable.  They may also make one with stronger adhesive, since I've 
found that the post-it note kind, tends to peel off when the bottle is 
put into the refrigerator.


The main deal here though is that you can print up 9 labels on a single 
page, and then cut them up.  There are 3 score lines across the backing
so that you can peel the backing paper off once the labels are printed.

                             TCP
    


TCP is a term used by amateur beermakers in the UK to refer to
a particular group of off-flavours and odours reminiscent of
a commercially available antiseptic. These taints, although
not necessarily just trichlorophenols, are caused by phenolic
compounds. Beer will, typically, contain 100-200 parts per
million (ppm) of tannins ("tannin" being a term referring to a
large group of polyphenolic compounds) which come
predominantly from the barley, although there is some
contribution from the hops. Whilst in this form the flavour
threshold is quite high, when combined with chlorine their
contribution to flavour is quite out of proportion to their
concentration. The flavour thresholds for chlorinated phenols
is around 2-3 parts per billion (ppb).


The common causes of this taint are summarised along with
suggestions of how the taint might be avoided.


Water Supply


Chlorination is the almost universal method of sterilising
domestic water supplies. In the distribution system, chlorine
gas can be dissolved directly in the water, a hypochlorite
(e.g. sodium hypochlorite) can be added to the water, or a
chloramine process may be used. Whilst the first two methods
perform in fundamentally the same way, chloramines, which are
produced by combining chlorine with ammonia, persist many
times longer than free residual chlorine. Chloramines are
particularly useful on long transmission lines and where
reliable penetration into stagnant areas of the distribution
system is needed.


Although the level of chlorine in the water should be less
than 1 ppm, it is necessary for it to be removed before using
the water to make beer. To be safe, chlorine must not come in
contact with the phenols naturally occurring in wort and beer
so all added water must be treated wherever it is used in the
beermaking process, including water used in diluting a beer to
produce a beer of lower gravity.


If the supply is also contaminated with phenols then reactions
will occur resulting in unavoidable phenolic flavours.
Fortunately this is rare, the World Health Organisation and
European  regulations specify a permissible limit of 1 ppb of
phenolic substances, but water authorities endeavour to remove
all of the phenols as a matter of course, so as to avoid
undesirable flavours. If it does occur then beverages other
than beer, e.g. tea or homemade wine, will also be affected,
and the only practical solution is for the water to be passed
through an active carbon filter. This method is extremely
effective and reliable; it removes all the free chlorine and,
if flow rates are not too great, the phenolic compounds also.


In the majority of cases, where the supply is not contaminated
with phenols, other methods for the removal of chlorine may be
employed.


Commercially, a common recommendation is the addition of
sulphur dioxide, followed by rousing. The sulphur dioxide
almost instantaneously reacts with the free chlorine and also
removes any chloramines in just a few minutes. It is normal
for sodium (or potassium) metabisuphite to be used at the rate
of 1-2 mg per litre. The addition of one campden tablet to
five gallons of water will supply in excess of ten times the
required dose. It should be noted that this method affects the
levels of salts in the water, which might be undesirable, but
which should be allowed for in any subsequent water treatment.


It is more normal, however, for the amateur simply to boil the
water to drive off the chlorine. A boil of 20 minutes is
usually sufficient and this is no imposition because most
water treatments prior to brewing involve boiling the water.


Sterilisers


Chlorine from sterilising agents such as domestic bleach or
commercial cleansing agents, inadvertently left in fermenting
bins, on cooling coils or other equipment could be responsible
for the taint. All equipment, if sterilised initially with
chlorine containing agents should be thoroughly rinsed,
preferably with a dilute metabisulphite solution, prior to
use.


Wort Bacteria


Very few breweries, especially home breweries, are free from
contamination with enterobacteria which, if their growth
proceeds to any great extent, can impart very noticeable
odours and flavours to the beer. In particular, contamination
with Hafnia protea  (formerly Obesumbacterium proteus) or the
coliform bacteria Escherichia coli and those of genus
Klebsiella (Aerobacter), can be the cause of phenolic or
medicinal taints. They can also be responsible for other off-
flavours including a parsnip odour and the production of
celery-like flavours, and can influence the development of
high levels of diacetyl.


The action of these bacteria is severely inhibited during the
progress of fermentation, as the pH drops and the alcohol
rises,  but they multiply quite rapidly during the early
stages and, if allowed a sufficiently strong foothold, will
leave behind significant levels of their metabolic products.
The H. protea bacterium is also quite capable of surviving
fermentation and appears to be able to influence yeast
metabolism in a way that encourages a high final pH and final
gravity of the beer, and thus assists the survival of both it
and other enterobacteria.


These bacteria, being present in soil and vegetation and also
possibly present in very small numbers in the water supply,
are readily introduced into a brewery. Once established, they
can be persistent and difficult to remove, and are frequently
transferred, in the pitching yeast or by contaminated
equipment, onto successive brews.


Beer is at its most vulnerable between the cooling of the wort
and the time that a strong and active ferment is underway, so
this period must be kept to as short as possible. The normally
low pH of wines means that these bacteria are usually
inhibited and their presence is unlikely to cause phenolic
flavours in home made wines. Also, the naturally high acidity
of roasted grains means that dark beers are less susceptible
to these problems and, conversely, the higher pH of lagers
makes them more vulnerable.

Wild Yeasts


Wild yeast can be the cause of a number of problems in beer.
In addition to off-flavours the most common are surface films,
turbidity and gushing.


Phenolic flavours are known to be produced by certain wild
yeasts, including some strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
and S. carlsbergensis. Also certain strains have developed the
ability to kill other sensitive yeasts and, under appropriate
conditions, can begin to dominate fermentation. A number of
these strains, otherwise suitable for brewing, are
characterised by the unacceptable production of medicinal
flavours.


It may be worth noting the, perhaps extreme, case where one of
the strains of yeast used to ferment Bavarian wheat beers
produces 4-vinyl guaiacol. This gives the beer its
characteristic "clovelike" phenolic flavour.


Avoiding problems with wild yeasts is essentially a matter of
pitching yeasts free of infection and keeping equipment clean.
Continued reuse of a yeasts from previous brews can, over
time, contribute to a build up of contamination.


Avoiding Phenolic Off-flavours


1.The quality of domestic water supplies clearly varies
  greatly throughout the country, and within a single district
  is subject to seasonal fluctuation. All added water should
  be boiled prior to use and in extreme cases it might be
  necessary to filter the water through an active carbon
  filter prior to this boiling. As an alternative chlorine may
  be removed by the addition of metabisulphite but the added
  salts may make this undesirable.


2.Any equipment that might come in contact with the wort or
  beer, if sterilised initially with chlorine containing
  agents must be thoroughly rinsed, preferably with a dilute
  metabisuphite solution before use.


3.Microbial infections should be avoided by rapidly cooling
  the boiled and strained wort and getting the fermentation
  off to a good start by the addition of a sufficient quantity
  of an active yeast starter. If yeasts are being re-used from
  previous batches, fresh cultures should be obtained at
  regular intervals.

Subject: Hot Tip on dry hopping!


Ok boys and girls here is the hot tip of the month...


During the Calif. Allstate Competition I judged Barley wines with Steve
Harrison from Sierra Nevada. I mentioned to Steve how much better this years
Celebration Ale was than last years. It was more like it used to be about 8
years ago. He said it was the same exact recipe as last year! The ONLY thing
they did different was seal the fermentor after dry hopping to reduce
scrubbing the aromatics out with CO2 release.


Ok, I went home and tried this technique on a batch. What I did was rack to
a 5 gallon keg and place the dry hops in a nylon bag with a big brass ball
in it to help sink the bag and hops. I then sealed the keg and applied a
small pressure. Everyday as a passed by the kegs I gave it a sort of rocking
motion. After 1 week I opened the keg and fished out the hop bag with a coat
hanger that had been staightened. I resealed keg, cooled and artificially
carbonated. The results are really amazing! I have dry hopped many times and
NEVER had the results this technique provides. The resultant beer is like
taking a hand full of hops and rubbing them in your face with ever glass.
The beers head and clarity are amazing at two weeks. I did use 1 oz per 5
gallons and they were Centenials and very fresh. I will cut back on the next
dry hopped batch. You keggers must give this a try.


I'm already thinking about the next batch, a Pilsener with 100% Saaz and dry
hopped with Saaz.

Subject: Curious about Copper




Just a question out of idle curiosity that one of you chemists or historians
out there may be able to answer.


This weekend my father-in-law cycled over for a visit and we got on the subject
of brewing.  He is an ex-FBI agent, and was retelling a story about an 
investigation of an employee of the Pabst Brewery in (Milwaukee ?) back in the
late 40's.  At any rate, we started talking about the machinery and processes
etc (I have been known to be a gadget freak).  We both started wondering about
why copper is the traditional material of choice in most parts of the brewing
process.  We never figured it out, so I told him I'd ask the Digest.


Is copper's use a carry over from the days before stainless or is there some
quality about the metal that makes it the most desirable.


Although I minored in Chemistry years ago, it wasn't/isn't my strong suite, so
any answers in semi-technical/laymans terms would be appreciated and understood
better.  (Grammer wasn't my either favorite).

I just got one of these also, and did some experimentation to test for
this.  I did NOT see any variation with temp.  Maybe there is something in
your water that is changing as when it heats up.  Have you gone back and
forth in temp a couple of times with the same water to see if this is
repeatable?  The instructions imply that the readings should be good over a
temp range of 0 to 50 deg C (32 to 122 deg F).  I see some seeming random
variations with mine of about .1 units, but I see no obvious correlation to
temperature.

The local Brew pub that I frequent (Callahan's) uses pure O2 (at least it
comes from a green bottle).  His beer comes out good. Next time I see the

    That's because "diver's O2" is actually compressed *air*, not O2 at all.
The air that goes into a SCUBA cylinder has to be dry and oil-free, though it
is not any more "sterile" than the air it is made from.  An aquarium pump with
an in-line filter works well for this purpose.

Subject: Farewell wherever you fare


    Well, since I posted two articles this morning and the automagical reply
said that there are 51 articles ahead of mine in the queue, I'd better post
this today as well if it is to be seen before Friday.


    Friday, February 26th will be my last day here at Intergraph.  I am leaving
and going to work in Orlando for another company.  My access to the net (and
therefore email and the HBD) will cease with my leaving, at least until I buy
a PC for home.


    I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the HBD since 1990 when I subsribed.
Access to the Digest, as well as Charlie's book (recommended overwhelmingly by
the digest contributors) have made my brewing experiences most pleasant.  I
read for several months before I jumped in and I have yet to make a single
batch that was "bad".  At times in the past, as well as of late, the Digest
degenerates into a forum for "one-upmanship" and the usually high signal to
noise ratio goes the other way.  It gets carried out to the ridiculous and 
none of the participants seem willing to let it drop.  It eventually returns
to normal, though not without casualty.  Witness the formation another brewing
forum because of this very thing not so long ago.  If I might make a gentle
suggestion, think before you post.  As someone suggested long ago, if you see
a post to which you are considering an inflammatory response, have a homebrew 
first, sleep on it, and then, if you still must respond in that manner, do it
by email.  The Digest is constipated now from those wanting to get the last
word in on the all-grain vs extract snob issue.  Email it!  If you simply must
post to show your rapier wit or superior knowledge, do it on rec.crafts.brewing
since that type of thing is the norm on usenet.  You will dazzle many more by
doing so, if that is your aim.  If it is not, then email was more appropriate
anyway.  Think about it.  My hope is that, by the time I get a connection
again, things will be back to normal.  In the meantime I raise a glass to you
all and I look forward to when our paths cross again.

Chris,
        I would never boil ANY grains.  What I would do is get a grain bag and
        seep it in your wort until apx 180 deg F.  This allows some of the
        flavor and the nice unfermentables to enhance you beer.  Mashing 
        allows you to convert starch to sugar for more fermentables.  I 
        always seep something when I am doing and extract batch and sometimes
        even when doing a full mash.

Brew Dudes and Dudettes,


I have been using a refractometer for a few months now.  This past weekend
I decided to do an experiment to see how the refractometer readings match
up to hydrometer readings on beer.  I filled my test jar with an IPA and
put my hydrometer in and it read 1.015.  I took a drop of the IPA and put
it on my refractometer and it read 8.2% Brix.  Converting this number to
points S.G., its about 1.032!!  What gives here?  BTW, both numbers are
temperature corrected.

Subject: WYeast


I've got a few questions regarding the use of WYeast.  I'm fairly new  
to the joys of homebrewing, and up till now have only pitched dry  
yeast.  However, over the weekend I decided to hoist myself off the  
bottom rung of the ladder and try the recipie for an Irish Red Ale  
that appeared in HBD a few weeks back, which called for the WYeast.   
My questions are these:


1) The instructions state that a period of incubation is needed (1-3)  
days before pitching.  Why is that?  I assume that when you break the  
inner seal, some sort of ****cose is mixed with the yeast to wake  
them up from hibernation and thus this is some sort of proofing  
period to see if they're viable.


2) The rule of thumb is that 1 day is needed for each month beyond  
the manufacturing date on the foil pouch at the time of purchase.   
Well, the date stamped on mine was Feb 17, and I bought it on Feb 20,  
so I concluded that even less incubation time than a day would be  
necessary - was this a safe conclusion?  This suspicion was confirmed  
by what comes next...


3) Another instruction is that the foil pouch should expand to at  
least an inch diameter before pitching.  I broke the seal, kneaded  
the pouch well, and set it on top of my water heater which I guessed  
to be about the recommended 80F degrees for the incubation.  I  
checked on it three hours later, and the pouch had expanded to the  
point that it was very taut, and I thought it would burst if I waited  
much longer, so I went ahead and pitched it.  The instructions led me  
to believe that the fact of expansion was more important than the  
actual length of time of incubation - was that a correct  
interpretation?


4) My roommate brewed at the same time I did, and he used dry yeast.   
The next morning his carboy was bubbling merrily (as we've found to  
be a normal time span for dry yeast), but there wasn't even a hiccup  
in mine.  The following morning, however, mine was also bubbling,  
though with a tad more melancholy than my roommate's had the morning  
before.  The temperature in the pantry where the fermentation takes  
place is about 67-70F degrees.  Is this slow start normal?  Should I  
expect the total fermentation time to be longer than the usual two  
weeks?
