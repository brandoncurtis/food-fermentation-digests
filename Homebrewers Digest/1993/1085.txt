Subject: us vs Brit malt/ Fruit in beer


Some comments on recent posts:
US vs British Malt
According to the data provided by a grain vendors, NorthEast Brewers Supply,
they list the degree of modification for grains from 1 least modified to 4
most modified.  They indicate that the British grain they stock is "4"
while the US ,Klages + Harrington, as 3.  I have  been led to believe
that the less modified a malt the longer it takes to protein rest and
mash.  Taking this further, that the highly modified, British, malts 
often do not require a protein rest hence their single step infusion mash.
I have just brewed a cream ale using all US grains, my extraction rate was
essentially the same as the British malt I usally use.  The mash time was
essentially the same since I always do a 15-30 minute protein rest.  The
color was the palest I have ever brewed avery light yellow/ gold I could
never get a beer this pale using British malt. 
 -Fruit in Beer
I brewed a strawberry Ale this summer.  What I learned is add fruit to the
 secondary, like dry hopping, or all the aromatic properties will be lost out
 the air lock during active fermentation.  Lightly hop the brew or the subtle
fruit flavor will be over powered.  If the fruit has pectin in it add pectic
enzyme  or the beer will never clear, it breaks down the pectin.  Remember that
yeast metabolizes sugar, that sweet fruit juice will become alcohol and fruit
 essence.  
 - Apple Beer?  I don't know if this is a good combination, fermented apple 
juice is cider, and I find cidery tasting beer unenjoyable.  I have had
wonderful rasberry, strawberry and cranberry beers.


Brewing books:
As a beginner I found the Miller "Complete handbook of Home Brewing" more
informative than the original Papazian book.  I have not looked at the new
versions.  I would recommend some of the Zymurgy special issues to someone
wanting to improve their knowledge.  The Hops issue has useful information
on more accurately determining the level of bitterness in a beer.  The
Yeast issue has information on yeast reuse which make liquid yeast less
 costly per batch.  The Trouble shooting issue cover many flaor faults.

Subject: Fermenters,batch size and heat buildup


Hi,
        with all this talk about the perfect fermenter
        design I was wondering if somebody could comment at
        what point does the heat buildup become high enough
        to affect the ferment? Also are the Wyeast preferred
        temps for the ferment or ambient? So does a
        40-50litre ferment create enough heat to alter an
        ale ferment? How about lagers?


        Thanks
        Nick

Subject: lagering


I'm an extract brewer with a single stage fermentation setup.  Is there
any way to make a lager without a secondary fermenter.  I will be moving
soon, and don't want to buy a carboy until after I move.  I'd like to
take advantage of my cold basement temperatures, though.  I thought I
read something in a past HBD about lagering in the bottle.  Is this
possible?  If so, what is the procedure?  Would a viable alternative be
a single stage fermented steam beer?


Thanks in advance,

Subject: Fermenting on trub


Hello Everyone,


A few months ago there was discussion in this digest about fermenting
on the trub. There was some argument weither to rack your cooled wort
off of the trub as soon as it settles or to forget about it and pitch.


Well I did a little experiment with my last 2 batches of Scotch Ale.


Batch 1: After chilling I let the trub settle for 45min and then racked
the beer into a glass carboy and pitched the yeast [wyeast 1098].


Batch 2: After chilling I did not let the trub settle but I pitched
right away with wyeast 1098.


Observations:
Batch 1 had a fast fermentation and cleared quickly. It was ready to 
keg in 2 weeks. Single stage fermentation.
Batch 2 started in about the same time as Batch 1 but the fermentation
took longer and it never really cleared up. It was ready to keg in 3
weeks. Single stage fermentation.


Flavour:
Batch 1 had a nice clean taste with the usual flavours associated with
a dark ale, the specialty grains seemed to really come through in the beer.
It was really good and did not last to long.
Batch 2 is not very good at all. It's flavour and smell is musty, yeasty,
and somewhat astringent. I am having a hard time giving this stuff away.


Well you can say I learned my lesson and will from now on always let the 
trub settle and rack the beer off the trub before pitching.

Subject: Alcohol content of Homebrew


Being a relatively novice brewer, I enjoy gathering new information from this
digest.  I have seen several references to alcohol content in homebrew recently.
One dealt with siphoning trub into the secondary fermentor (creating more
fuesel alcohols), the other I dug up touched upon the relationship between
the body of the brew and the alcohol content.
  My questions:  When using partial mask method (following instructions from
a recipe for holding grains at specific temps for specified lengths of time,
then adding the resulting liquid to more water containing extract or DME),
is the temperature/time relationship the determinant factor in alcohol content
of the finished beer?  Some people tell me my beer seems to have higher alcohjol 
than they're used to (this would be commercial American or Canadian brews).  I
have never tried to calculate the alcohol content, but I would imagine that with
mashing variations, an accurate estimate might be way off.  What are the rules
of thumb for starch conversion vs. temperature?   
  I suppose the "trub" reference is a different factor in alcohol?  And how
does a blow-off tube affect alcohol?
  Thanks!

Subject: oxidation in the bottle


I've been wondering about beer oxidising when in the bottle, due to
excessive splashing in the syphoning/bottling process.  Given that yeast are
present in the bottle also (or else bottle conditioning wouldn't happen),
why don't they simply use any introduced oxygen to multiply before
fermenting the priming sugar?


A reasonable answer would be that oxidation takes place more quickly than
the yeast can remove the oxygen, but does anyone know the real answer?

Subject: yeast mutation


Jacob Galley posted a question dealing with yeast mutation.  Alcohol when 
metabolized can produce acetaldehyde which is mutagenic, but my guess is that 
since there are always spontaneous mutations occurring, if you use one yeast
batch for too long a time, you wind up selecting strains that will out compete
your original strains as the environment (wort) changes.

I used to use adhesive labels, and you're right, they're hell to get off.
I've read on the digest here that plain paper, dipped in milk (that's 
right!) will hold labels on well, once dry. When re-wetted, they supposedly
slip right off. I haven't tried it, as I've just plain given up labelling
(too paranoid, lazy, and ill-informed, you know ;-).

Subject: Saving Yeast


Hallo thar homebrewers!


My brewing partner and I recently started using liquid yeast and
are quite pleased with the results - the cost, however, is making
us wonder about whether or not we should buy a new packet every time
when a strain could be reused...I guess our question is this:  How
have the experiences of other digesters been regarding saving the
sludge?  Do you seal it up with some malt extract?  Do you put it
into a container that would allow stoppering/airlocking?  Just curious...
we saw a couple of possible containers the other day, but I thought I'd
beter write first...How about "Grolsch-type" bottles?


Thanks in advance for any input

I'd like to advise against this last suggestion, especially if you used a
different liquid yeast for the primary fermentation.  If the yeast you
add at bottling is more attenuative than the fermentation yeast you could
get exploding bottles.  Also, if you are using dry yeast in the primary
ferment and are bottling with the same yeast, I strongly suggest rehydrating
the yeast in both cases.  In a sort of newsletter from Lallemand (the
yeast manufacturer), they say that dry yeast rehydrated in wort (as opposed
to rehydrating in 104-115F sterile water) is more likely to produce
off-flavors.  I've found that the lag time was quite a bit longer when
I didn't rehydrate in water in recent tests with Coopers and Lallemand
yeasts.


On a related note, I have written in the past warning about the use of
the yeast that comes with Munton & Fison Kits (it use to be called
Muntona, but now I think it just says "yeast").  I said that it gave
very, very high levels of phenolic/clove aromas and flavors and that
I suggested it not be used.  I'd like to point out that I had not
rehydrated this yeast in water (since it was not mentioned by M&F in the
instructions).  Perhaps if the yeast is rehydrated in water, it may be more
acceptable in terms of the phenolic/clove flavors?  Note that this still
does not address the issue of bacterial infection of the dry yeast
which was a problem years ago with the Muntona yeast (eventually the
beers would become gushers... when I switched to Wyeast, I could keep
the beers for years without them becoming gushers, so it was NOT my
sanitation methods).

Subject: extract barleywine


A while back, amidst all the extract/all-grain ego-excreta, there was a
comment about "tang" of extract brews with a lot of malt.  The recent
"found beer" note (I like it!) reminded me of an extract barleywine we've
had for some years, with a fair stash turning up recently (in bottle).  It
was strong enough to start (1.095 OG) that we'd have been able to pick up
any off-flavors or especially any tang, but nobody who's tasted it has had
any complaint...either when it was young, or now, several years later.
(In its youth, we did some comparisons against Old Foghorn.  It came out in
a dead heat.  I loved it, and spent some considerable effort comparing the
two:-)


There was also a suggestion somewhere along the way that dry malt might be
better than canned.  This old barleywine was made with M&F spraymalt, so
FWIW there's a possible datapoint in favor of dry.  Anyone else made any
comparisons, or even have any good/bad single datapoints?  Most of my
brewing isn't beer these days, but barleywine is the one exception I'd
make, so if I brew extract I'd like to aim carefully.


I'm also intrigued by the processes.  I think I'd heard that the dried malt
was essentially "sprayed" and evaporated by dry air and low pressure, as
opposed to boiling off water.  If so, this would make a good case for why
dry malt would survive processing better than canned (less heat).  True?

        How well did you stir? How long before you checked
        the temp? Personally I add the water first. The
        cooler will suck up a fair bit of temp. With my
        larger cooler I count on losing close to 10F to the
        cooler itself. I also stir quite a bit during mashin
        to make sure no hot spots develop. I also tend to
        wait 1min at least before mashing in. I'm sure hot
        spots mean cold spots.

        Did you do any stirring during the mash? I usually
        stir a little bit every 15-20mins. Also I think most
        people will tell you that iodine results aren't
        perfect.

        I wonder if the temps weren't evened out during
        mashin.


>Now, the questions:

        I think that if you didn't stir at all it could. I
        personally don't do an iodine test. I just mash for
        a certain time. 1.5hours pale beers 2hours for
        stouts/porters. If you are worried I'd guess pulling
        off a sample and testing it's gravity would be
        better then an iodine test.

    Since I'm the author of the most recent of these brewery reviews, I have
to disagree.  From the heading of this most useful forum:


        "FORUM ON BEER, HOMEBREWING, AND RELATED ISSUES"


    I think that brewery tour reports certainly belong.  Mine was long so I
broke it into three parts.  It probably doesn't matter much to those who now
take for granted accessible microbreweries and their products but we, here in
Alabama, have had no such luxury until the opening of the micro in Birmingham.
Some of the most enjoyable and informative articles in this forum have been 
about brewery tours.  They give clues to those wishing to approximate a 
favorite beer on the brewing process and ingredients used in that beer as well
as interesting insight on the microbrewing industry which most of us support
whenever possible.


    Far more damaging and digest-clogging are the continued ramblings on such
banal subjects as the "all-grain snobbery" thread that is *still* continuing
and is even treated in some length at the end of this article containing a
"modest proposal" to shorten the digest.  We hear about which groups are "snobs"
(are not! are too!) and why and then we are treated to lenghty articles from
people in each group explaining why they, at least, do not fit this description
("I have *friends* who are all-grain/extract brewers - I can't be a snob!").

    How about let's just drop all the namecalling and criticizing articles?
I'll bet that those have taken up far more space than any brewery tour articles
combined.  Also, there *is* another brewing list which is always short.  I
get both but guess which one I've found most useful thus far, warts and all.

Greetings Brewmiesters,


  Just a couple of quick questions for the collective wisdom of the
HBD crowd.


     1.  I have just put a small amount of wyeast European Ale #1338
         in a sterile Fisher bottle with some lightly hopped weak wort
         (around SG 1020) and attached an air lock.  I would like
         to keep this as a starter base in my refridgerator.  When do
         I place it in the fridge, and when, with what and how often
         do I feed it?


     2.  Is it possible to make our own specialty malts (i.e. roasted,
         chocolate, black patent, etc.) from a regular 2 row?  How about
         crystals etc.?  This would certainly help cut down the costs.


  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

The efficiency of the fermentation is dependent on a lot of things, one
of them being the amount of yeast nutrients in the wort, another being
the amount of glucose/fructose/sucrose in the wort (recall Bob Jones'
et al. reports of high FGs with sucrose starters).  A lot depends on
the quality of the extract you use (see later in this post).

I suggest that you steep all the specialty grains before the boil (as the
water is coming up to 170F -- pull them out at 170F) since you would like
to coagulate any of the large proteins that you may have introduced from
the grains -- which will take the whole 60 min boil.

2 lbs is quite a bit of black patent for a 5 gallon batch.  I used 1/2 lb
roasted barley and 1/2 lb black patent in a recently tasted batch with
two cans (6.6#) of John Bull Dark syrup and it fermented out just fine
with Wyeast #1084.  I'd say a pound of black patent should be enough if
you are using light malt extract.

I used 3 ounces of Clusters for the boil and a half-ounce of Cascades
in the fermenter (after the kraeusen fell), but I would recommend adding
another 1 ounce of Fuggles or Goldings for the last 15 minutes of the
boil (for flavor). 


>can i grow decent hops in mid ohio?


Sure.  Give them plenty of sun, plenty of string to climb (15-20 feet!)
and lots of water (6-7 gallons per plant, per day).

It's not the level of the refinement, it's the type of sugar.  Too much
sucrose (cane or beet sugar), dextrose, glucose or fructose will give you
cidery flavors.  It may not be all your fault -- it could be the fault
of your extract (see below).

Pick up the Zymurgy special issue on Extract Brewing.  It has a listing
of virtually every extract brand that was available at the time (1986?).
One popular extract that was not available at the time is Northwestern.
I've spoken to the manufacturer and it is made from 100% barley malt
(except the Bavarian Weizen which is 65% wheat malt 35% barley malt) and
contains no other sugars, flavors or colorings.  The hopped extracts
contain the equivalent of 10 IBU of pre-isomerized hop extract (from
unlisted hop varieties, alas) for a 5 gallon batch in one 3.3 lb box.
(Therefore two 3.3# boxes in a 5 gallon batch will give you 20 IBU).

Subject: Call a spade a spade


What with the over-abundance of interesting and informative
braying about extract vs all-grain brewing, I have taken the
liberty of compiling a list which, I feel, best summarizes the
characteristics of the two types of brewers:
 
Extract:  Scum of the earth, lazy, ignorant, obtuse, oppressed,
white bread with no crust, born-out-of-wedlock complainers.
 
All-grain:  Scum of the earth, pompous, swaggering, self-
righteous, ill-tempered, intolerant, vain, incestuous braggarts.
 
Naturally I've left out the more colorful descriptors so as not
to offend the under-aged (or humor-impaired).
 
So it seems that no matter which brewing technique you employ,
you fall into one of the two categories.  Now I don't know about
the rest of you, but this is one scum-of-the-earth who would like
to put this topic to bed.  And if we don't do it toot sweet, I'll
be forced to post about other beer-related topics even more
vulgar than farting.  And let me tell you, there are a few.
 
You have been warned.

        From: Martin A. Lodahl <pbmoss!malodah`at`PacBell.COM>
        Subject: Sugared Extracts


        A discussion of the adulteration of malt extracts with corn sugars
        has been going on over in the newsgroup rec.food.drink, and Paul
        Chisholm of Bell Labs asked me to let HBD in on the secret.  I
        started the whole fracas by making a cryptic reference to recent
        research that cast the purity of extracts in doubt, and Doug DeMers
        of Amdahl immediately asked for sources, and more information.  So
        the following day I posted this:


        The flap all began in Zymurgy, Vol. 13 #5, Winter 1990.  On page 15,
        in Dan Fink's "Brew News" column, was an item describing a report
        presented by Professor Michael Ingledew of the University of
        Saskatchewan to the 1990 meeting of the American Society of Brewing
        Chemists, on research he and his colleagues were doing on the
        composition of malt extracts.  This research, a combination of High
        Performance  Liquid Chromatography and fermentation studies,
        disclosed the substantial unlabeled presence of glucose syrup,
        invert syrup/liquid sucrose, and high fructose corn syrup in the
        extracts tested.  They also discovered poor fermentation from some
        extracts, due to a deficiency in the free amino nitrogen content
        normally provided by barley malt (had any stuck fermentations
        lately?).  In the presentation, they did not identify the extracts
        tested.


        I don't have to tell you what a storm that raised!  The AHA followed
        up on it, and in Dan Fink's column (page 14) in the Summer 1991
        issue of Zymurgy (Vol. 14 #2) they published a letter from Professor
        Ingledew in which he said that they indeed were NOT planning to release
        the names of the extracts tested.  They felt they couldn't be sure
        whether the adulteration was done by the manufacturers, or by the
        distributors.  They also felt their sample might not be representative,
        as they had only tested 44 "lager" extracts, and no "ale" extracts 
        (their terms).  They didn't feel they had the time or money to handle
        either additional testing or possible legal action.  They also felt
        that the burden of following up on the problem they'd identified 
        rested with the brewing industry, through the marketplace.  Then
        Professor Ingledew closed with this paragraph: 


                In spite of my comments above, I have complete
                confidence in the results obtained in my lab by
                my colleagues.  There is no doubt that some
                manufacturers are profiting from the addition
                of lower cost corn sugars to malt extract.


        Well!  Where does that leave us?  Neither of the articles made it
        clear what percentage of the extracts tested had been "juiced", or
        to what degree.  And, of course, we have no idea what they were
        testing.


        I hope you're not too terribly depressed.

Data point:


I just bottled a bock (15.5B/SG 62) fermented with the Bohemian yeast.
I chose it because I wanted a high terminal gravity.  Instead, I ended
up with a very alcoholic, dry beer.  Hmmm.  If it weren't so clean,
I'd swear it was Belgian.  Fermentation temps were in the low 40s
and 30s; and -- as I recall -- the saccharification rest was held at
158 (2-decoction mash).

Sounds ok:
I did a simple experiment once with a bit of unfermented wort,
adding (96%) alcohol volumes to see the effect on measured
density:
F.G.= density of wort without the alcohol.
Numbers in the table are the measured values (with a hydrometer)
after adding the percentage of alcohol given in the columns
(All values +/- my accuracy; your mileage had better vary.... )

1040 |  1038  1036  1032  1029  1026


So, I would guess that your beer, with 32 gravity points of 
sugars, contains a little over 8% alcohol by volume,
which produces a 1015 hydrometer reading....

darker colour to the beer. Is this

 The only source I have found for SS screen is McMaster Carr but I have to buy 
 about $50 worth.  Not too practical if you are only making one.
 
 >  Also, what is a reasonable minimum length of mesh if its rolled into a 
 tube?
 
 Don't quite understand what you are doing but the tube in the EM is 6 inches 
 long and 3/8" in diameter.  It is pinched off at one end and slips over 3/8" 
 copper tubing on the other.  The tubing is bent so the screen rests on the 
 bottom.  This handles the entire task of the false bottom, slotted tube and 
 other such devices.

Subject: Gluten in beer


I believe that this was discussed before, or at least something similar,
but I do not know how it was resolved.


We will be having company over for dinner in a couple weeks and one of
the people coming cannot have any gluten in his diet.  The question
naturally is, would homebrew be a problem?


The discussion earlier was along the lines of how much wheat is in the
beer but "The Cook's Companion" says that barley has some gluten too
(albeit, not as much as wheat).  Furthermore, it says that gluten is a
protein.  This makes me ask a couple questions:
  1. Is it some of the protein that settles out in the hot or cold
        break?
  2. Is it one of the proteins responsible for aiding head retention (if
        indeed proteins are responsible)?  After all, wheat is high in
        gluten and wheat malt is often recommended to aid head
        retention.
  3. Is it a protein that is broken down in the protein rest or in the
        malting process?


e-mail or posting is fine.  I will summarize any e-mail responses I get.


Thanks for your help.
