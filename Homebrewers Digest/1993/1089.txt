I hate to tell you this HH, but you _do_ know the procedure for mashing.  You
are just doing it on a smaller scale.  My first mash was done this way,
called a partial mash, adding the extract from the grains to the extract from
the can.  To go all-grain, all you have to do is increase the amount of
grains and skip the extract.  Of course, that assumes you would ever want to
go all-grain, etc. etc. (ACKK! do I have to be PC here, too? - I hate this.)


Roy sez:

I tend to slightly disagree with this statement.  My experience tells me that
dry-hopping contributes greatly to the nose _and_ the flavor.  Also, and this
may be bunk, it seems to accentuate bitter hops as well.  I mean that,
although it doesn't actually add bittering, the bittering hops seem more
assertive when boosted with a large dose of dry hops.  This may only be true
when the two hops are the same or similar varieties (i.e. I haven't done any
real scientific research to prove/disprove my theories).

Subject: more powdered sugar


In HBD 1088, Eric said that "Powdered sugur is a mix of finely ground table sugur and cornstarch (about
60%/40%).  This is why powdered sugur doesn't cake or clump, and why you
don't substitute powdered sugur for regular sugur when baking (the doughs
become impossibly stiff)."


Wellll, at my local grocery, that stuff is called confectioners' sugar
and is intended for making cake icing and such.  100 percent powdered
sugar is available as well.  Some places might call it bartenders' sugar.
it mixers well in drinks, without leaving undissolved  grit.


Both types are clearly labelled as to contents.


That said, I only use dry malt for my yeast starters, canning 7 or 8 qts
at a time in a pressure canner.

Hello,


Does anyone have comments about the BREWCAP device that fits over
the top of a carboy. I'm thinking of buying one so I can draw
samples out of the carboy alittle easier.  Also, are there any
gizmos around that help start a siphon.  I can never get that
trick to work where you first fill the tube with water.

 However, here are the facts:
 
 The only thing on the rollers is a thin coating of rust-proofing oil.  This 
 is applied after they are knurled so they do not rust in inventory.  At the 
 time they are assembled, the rollers are wiped vigorously with a clean rag to 
 remove as much as possible.  The easiest way to get the rest of it off is to 
 mill a few pounds of malt with it and feed it to the birds.
 
 Our QC procedure here is to mill a pound with one mill out of every batch of 
 10 to make sure there are no systemic problems.  We simply blow it off with 
 an air hose after testing and you may have gotten one of these which would 
 have some dust or debris on the rollers.   However, it would be the same as 
 if you had run a pound throgh it.
 
 Unless something happened to yours from the time it left here till you 
 received it, it should look just like the 600 others we have shipped and no 
 one has previously even commented on what you find unacceptable.
 
 Unless you want to pay $75 for the ss roller option, oil is a necessary evil 
 on a steel product.  Once it is in regular use, it will stay clean without 
 any special attention but I can not inventory hundreds of expensive rollers 
 and take the chance of them getting rusty nor getting rusty before the 
 customer has a chance to use it.
 
 You can clean them with a wire brush and cooking oil and then wipe them down 
 thoroughly.  Other than that, I do not know what to tell you.  If I send you 
 another set of rollers, they will look exactly like the ones you have.
 
 Your money will, of course, be cheerfully refunded if you choose to return 
 the mill.
 
 Sorry for the trouble,

 okay, I see. take my home brew supplies, coat them with machine oil, and
 give it to the birds. Well, I never DID like pidgeons.


 I guess either the other 600 users did the above, cleaned with a wire brush,
 et all, or were just too embarrassed to complain. Or they don't mind machine
 oil lager.

 Thanks much to all who responded to the LPG vs LNG question. I suspected
 what seems to be true: the burner is probably jetted for LNG, and needs
 re-jetted for LPG. The LPG supplies more energy per given volume and thus
 requires more 02; since there is no way to increase flow of air into the
 venturi, I gotta decrease the fuel flow. Thanks guys!

Subject: RIMS


I want to thank the many people who sent comments on my RIMS review.
The typos noted were the following:


     1. Replace "It hard" with "It is hard" in the second paragraph.
     2. Replace "eat corn" with "eat crow" in the third paragraph.


I have been very critical of the AHA for these sort of typos. I seem
to remember from my youth a story about glass houses and stones. Does
anyone remember how that one goes?


Bob Jones in HBD#1088 raises some very interesting points. As such things
pertain to the specific case of Conrad's system, I would feel a good deal
more confortable if they were addressed directly to Conrad. Those who saw
pictures of my own 1/2 bbl. system in Milwaukee know it is quite different
from Conrad's. It is also different from Bob's, who in turn differs from
Micah. I look on all of this with a good deal of favor. What a boring world
it would be if total uniformity reigned!


Because of length restrictions, reviews differ from technical articles. What
I look for in a review is a clear statement of the product claims made by
the producer, and a good faith effort on the part of the reviewer to check
them. Interested readers can then contact the producer for details. The 
following are what I understand to be the claims Conrad is making for his
system. My observation of an actual brew being done with his system leads me
to believe that they are all valid.


   1. Total temperature control through uniquely designed controllers and
      heating elements. Any reasonable type of infusion mashing schedule
      can be used with the system.


   2. Recirculation without HSA.


   3. High yields and brilliantly clear run offs.
 
   4. A system that is trivial to clean.






Would someone be so kind and post a list of Rodney's articles about RIMS?
I have kept only the one that appeared in the Maltose Falcon newsletter,
since it appeared to be the most complete and detailed.

 This issue should obviously be discussed off line but since Mike chose to 
 post it to the Digest before I even received his comments in email, he leaves 
 me little choice but to respond in kind.

 My objective is to provide a modestly priced product to satisfy hombrewers. 
 If you wish to satisfy the FDA, you should have purchased the Stainless Steel

I expected to see plenty of responses on this, but since they don't
seem to be coming, here goes:


I bought some of that stuff before, too. It was from the local
alternative food co-op, and it was not Korean, but I bet it was the
same. What it is is ground-up malt (grains that have been sprouted,
dried again, and ground into flour). It is not dried malt extract,
which you (and I) were hoping to get.


Theoretically, the enzymes should still be in there, so you might be
able to convert it to sugar, but you would have a really hard time
getting it filtered.


I think I tried using it in bread, but it didn't work as flour,
either. It was too sticky because it does contain some sugars. I am
not sure what it is supposed to be good for.

Korean malt:
I suspect that what you've got there is malt flour, not extract powder,
just ground up malted grain. Should make good bread.

Nope, not a problem, the image on a photocopy, B&W or color, consists

Subject: .......how come you taste so good?


I have advocated the use of brown sugar in pale ales in this forum
on at least two occasions.  The first was in HBD#528 in a recipe which
appears in Cat's Meow (p.1-12 in the postscript version).  The second
was a little over a month ago in the post where I coined the phrase
"all-grain snob" (mea culpa).  This practice recently took a slam:


In HBD#1083 John Freeman sez:


>And keep the stinking brown sugar out of my beer.


Do I detect an all-malt attitude?  (I'll aviod the "s" word :-)


Many of us began brewing from kits, using enormous amounts of sugar,
and eventually learned that cutting back on the sugar meant getting
rid of the cidery falvors.  This doesn't necessarily imply that all
sugar must be cut out in all circumstances.  Belgian beer homebrewing
seems to have become vastly more popular during my three years on the
HBD, and homebrewers are willing to follow Belgian practice when it
comes top sugar.  Why should we treat UK brewers differently?


Looking back in my log book, I notice that my first two bitters
contained small amounts of brown sugar - under 15%.  Both were
served on draft at parties and both were overwhelming successes.
Having lived in England for two years, I can also assure you that
the flavor was quite authentic.  As well, there were occasional
pale ales and brown ales which had brown sugar additions.  In all,
something like 4-5% of my 200+ batches.  No particular problems noted,
and some raves received.


I notice that I haven't used brown sugar myself since since posting
my Cat's Meow recipe.  I think I'll try a brown and/or pale ale
with 10-15% sugar in the near future.  I'd also appreciate e-mail
from people who've tried my Cat's Meow recipe, with their opinions
on using brown sugar in a Bass-alike.


Cheers,

Subject: Brown sugar........


Some beers, especially British ones, are brewed with small amounts
of brown sugar.  I believe that reputable UK brewers keep the total
amount of extract from adjuncts and sugars at or below 15% (see  
Foster's _Pale_Ale_).  I also understand that when brown sugar is
used, it is more likely to be a "raw" brown sugar, like demerara, than
the stuff one finds in a North Amercian supermarket.  The latter
is likely to be ordinary white cane sugar doctored with molasses.


My palate tells me that there is brown sugar in Newcastle Brown Ale,
and an English friend who is quite a good judge of beer agrees.  On a
more cautious claim, I believe I have tasted subtle brown sugar tones
in bottled Bass.  After a recent experience, though, I'm reluctant
to state definitively that the tones actually come from brown sugar.


Last Friday I had a bottle of Pike's Place Pale Ale, from White River
Junction, VT.  This is a really fine brew: on the dark side of pale
ale color, with good body and _substantial_ hop bitterness :-)
On the nose, though, I picked up an unmistakabe brown sugar aroma.
A pleasant one, I might add.  However, the label states only malt,
hops, yeast and water, and I have no reason to doubt them.  So my
conclusion is that a brown sugar aroma can develop without the 
addition of brown sugar in the wort.  Any comments?

  I had considered using all-grain to make the canned wort, but went
with extract for simplicity.  (I had a batch to mash and three to
bottle at this point) Also, I brew widely divergent beers weekly, so
reserving a pint of stout might not be appropriate for starting a
batch of light lager.  My canned wort is "least common denominator"
pale type.

  I called it gyle from Papazian's description of reserving bitter
wort for later priming purposes.  You may have a point on simplicity,
but I had more faith in the "canned" wort keeping for a long period of
time at room temperature.  Also, since I had been reserving gyle for
priming purposes (usually 3 22oz bottles per batch), and frequently
have 2-5 batches fermenting simultaneously, my refridgerator just
isn't big enough.

  I'm not sure which flask you are referring to.  I use flasks for
growing my starters, but I don't boil at that point.  I pour sterile,
canned wort into the sanitized flask, stir in a small sample of yeast,
and affix a sanitized plastic airlock.  At appropriate times, I add
more sterile wort to enlarge the starter, and move to larger flasks
when appropriate.

Thanks for the compliment, no snobbery felt, and yes, it is fun.  If
I'd been brewing beer in 7th grade biology class, I might have paid a

I was astonished at the number of responses to my post about low ginger flavor 
in my ginger beer wort.  Thanks everyone!


Many people pointed out that the sweetness of the wort may be masking the 
ginger flavor.  The message is that 1) lots of recipes use about 3 oz of ginger 
and use 1 hour boil times, and 2) a little ginger goes a long way. Before 
panicking, I'll taste the beer during racking into my secondary.


Jim Grady suggests grating the ginger rather than slicing it.  For what it's 
worth, I tasted the ginger slices after boiling, and they were pretty 
flavorless, suggesting that the flavor was sucessfully extracted.


Spenser Thomas warns that he tried adding pieces of ginger to each bottle, 
which gave good flavor, but also caused gushing.  He suggests making a ginger 
tea by steeping ginger in hot water, and adding that to the secondary.  Would 
steeping santize the ginger enough to avoid the infection suggested by gushing?  
How hot / how much time do I need to santize an ingredient?


Dan Butler-Ehle says that he uses ginger a lot, but has never been really happy 
with the flavor - the pepperiness is missing.  He thinks the ginger oils boil 
off early.  He has added ginger to his secondary, and that doesn't seem to 
help, and sometimes leads to off-flavors.  He speculates the pulp rots, and 
suggests I try dried, ground ginger.


I looked up ginger and oil of ginger in the Merck Index, and got some insight 
into just what's there. The major flavor componant is a fairly high molecular 
weight phenol called gingerol.  It doesn't look very volatile.  However, there 
are a number of other constituents which DO look volatile: camphene, 
phellandrene, borneol, citral and cineol.  I suspect at least some of these are 
lost during an extended boil, explaining my and other's reports of 
disappointing flavor.

Mike Deliman writes about problems with his propane cooker...


I believe that propane (LPG) has more heat per volume.  As for the soot
from your burner, it may be that the air/fuel ratio is not set
correctly.  Look at the inlet and there should be a rotatable shutter
that you can adjust the air/fuel mixture with.  Mine was a fairly cheap
unit from Sears and it had one.


The other problem I noted with mine was that the gas/flame distribution
was uneven with the far side of the burner having a much longer flame than
the near side.  A little surgery with a drill grinding bit and I was able
to change the configuration of the casting to allow a more even gas flow.
See crude graphics below.

Although it's a bit crude, the two X's in the right hand drawing show 
where the carving was done.  The left hand carved out area opened up
the gas flow to the inlet side of the burner, and the right hand X carving
made a "bounceback" kind of effect with the gas so that the jet of gas
(later flame) didn't simply flow straight out the opposite side of the
burner from the gase inlet.  It's still not perfect, but the flame 
distribution is a lot more even than it was as the unit was shipped to me.


Despite the appearance of the drawing above however, the actual grinding does
not (should not) go anywhere near the edge of the casting.


Kip Damrow asks about color copier labels.  They don't run when wet.
The toner powder used in photocopying is a plastic powder that is melted

Subject: hop aroma




It seems that every couple of months there is another discussion about
hop nose or aroma and flavor and methods of achieving it in the beer.
It's the general lack of good info in the homebrewing literature and 
even texts on brewing science like Biotechnology of Brewing and Malting
and even Malting and Brewing Science on this topic that leads to 
repeated queries.  That's what led Mark Garetz to put together a nice
article for zymurgy, appearing in the summer issue, about dry-hopping.
Mark has done a really professional job putting the article together with
interviews with Fritz Maytag (several hours), Jim Koch (the beloved one
in this forum) and many other people in the hop industry.  The article
discusses several methods using finishing hops such as dry-hopping, 
hop backs, finishing hops at the end of the boil, hop tea, etc.


It's interesting that all of these approaches contribute to hop flavor and
aroma of the beer, but the hop flavor and aroma can be very different for
each technique.  This is due to the fact that hop oil which is the stuff
which contributes the hop flavor and aroma is really many different oils.
Some are more volative than others and some are more chemically reactive
than others and all are more reactive and volatile at higher temperatures.
Thus the type and amount of oils and secondary oil products in the beer
depends on the variety of hop, amount, temperature, time and many other
factors, including, as Bob Jones pointed out, opened or sealed vessel.
Bob's advice is right on the mark.  You will get more hop aroma by
dryhopping in the keg.  The reason for this is that volatile hop oils
are not soluble in beer but rather are in suspension.  The volatile 
suspended oils would really prefer to float away.  Take Bob's advice,
don't give them a chance; keep the lid on.




Rather than say that one method of using finishing hops is 'better'
than another, I prefer to say that they are are all wonderful but
different.  If you have any doubt about the incredibly vast difference
of hop aroma and flavor betwenn using the same type of hop in (I believe)
nearly equal amounts in two different ways, just compare Sierra Nevada
Pale Ale and Anchor Liberty Ale.  Both use Cascade finishing hops.  
One is dry-hopped and the other uses a hop back.




I am a proponent of the idea of including more information in a recipe
with regard to finishing hops.  it's really not enough to say
"dryhopped with 1 oz cascades."  if I want to really match the beer
I need to know how long the hops were in the fermenter or keg and
the temperature.  similarly, if you use finishing hops at the end of
the boil, i not only need to know how much for how long, i need to
know the rate at which the hot wort was cooled because the hop
flavor and character are altered significantly during a slow cooling.

I don't think so.  I made a batch about 6 mo. ago with 1.5 oz of ginger
boiled for an hour and it had a very good ginger flavor.  I think that I
might have grated my ginger as opposed to slicing it.   Ginger is powerfull
stuff and 3 oz seems like a lot.  Maybe it is like hops in that there can
be a lot of variation of "the good stuff" season to season etc.

This sounds like a cool idea, but I think that I would finish this batch
without it. Then, if in the end, if there is not enough ginger flavor, you
can brew another batch and "dry ginger" it.  This way, you will have a
better idea where the ginger flavor came from.  


BTW... How well do your yeasties like that low pH wort?

I found the machine-oil smell of the device a bit worrisome, but after
passing a few pounds of grain through as a trial I decided it was
in fact not a problem.  The odor has largely gone away now that I've
run a batch through.  The odor is not evident in the grain passed
through.

So?  Over the long haul this doesn't make a bit of difference.  Over
the short term, yes, it would be nice if Jack brushed the rollers
clean in something like hexane and then with a mild detergent.

I wish Jack had shipped mine smelling like Ivory soap, but I'm not
sure what if any difference it makes.  Certainly I have no problem
with the particles of grain that tend to lodge in the grooved rollers.

Calling it "food processing machinery" is a bit loose.  After all,
you are going to thoroughly filter and boil the output.  You aren't
really going to "eat" the output of the mill at all.  The chance
of, say, a chip of steel making it through to a bottled beer is zero,
considering all the settling and sedimentation that goes on.


Finally, casual experimentation (just now) reveals that a dry toothbrush
suffices to clean the rollers down to the shine on the portion (about
2/3) of the rollers where the grain gets crushed.  Why don't you just
run 5-10 lbs of cheap malt through and get on with things ... ?


The effect of the maltmill on fat British 2-row malt is most impressive.
The husks are left almost completely in one piece, and the kernel
is squished perfectly into coarse chunks.  The results on less modified
American 2-row and particularly 6-row are a little less remarkable,
but I gather that these grains are harder to crush anyway.


I will print a detailed review when I have some data points.
I am looking for a reduction in astringency (vs. grain from Corona)
and an improvement in extraction rates.  So far, at least the latter
seems likely.
