Subject: Lager starting


In a recent post, I described *one* method that is used to start a
lager fermentation, in which the ferement is started at a warmer
temperature and then cooled for the main ferment.  Jim Busch, in
private email pointed out:


><stuff that kills some bacteria" and then raise the temperature.  It's sort
><of backwards from one common way to make lagers: to start the batch at
><around 65F and then once the yeast get going, (slowly) lower the temp to
><40F or 45F.

What Jim means is that esters will be produced and you'll get the fruity
flavors of an ale which you would like to avoid in a lager.

He's right.  I should probably mentioned the preferred method in which the
starter is slowly (to avoid temp shock) cooled to, say, 50F and pitched
into 50F wort.  Then you can slowly bring the temp down to the 40s if you
want.  Note that this will give you a much slower start than the method
I suggested in my original post and therefore will require much better
sanitation, but if it's lager you're after, I recommend (as Jim does)
that you follow the German methods as opposed to the "rush ferments"  that
the American industrial giants use.  Note that fruitiness is also tied
to the strain and some are less fruity at warmer temps than others.


Thanks Jim.

My experience with Cooper's is that it has a distinct "bready" character. I
generally use Sierra Nevada cultured from a few Pale Ale bottles. I have
substituted Cooper's at times when my starter didn't make the grade. I make a
house ale regularly with no modifications to the recipe unless I pitch the
Cooper's rather than the SNPA. The Cooper's is much less fruity with more yeast
taste or, as I said, "bready". Attenuation seems to be about the same between
the two. My house ale has an OG of 1.060 and finishes around 1.018 with both
yeasts.

Subject: All-Grain Help/BrewCap


  I completed my first all-grain batch about three weeks ago.  Two-and-a-half
gallons are now bottled.  The other two-and-a-half gallons were filtered
(0.5-micron "Filter Store" filter) and are now carbonating in a keg in my
fridge.  I sampled the beer in between the primary and secondary and it had a
pronounced "grainy" taste (grainy as in grain husk).  Being my first all-grain
batch, I severely underestimated the heat-retention capabilities of a Vollrath
pot.  I combined nine pounds of grain (one pound at a time) with a steady
stream of 170oF water.  The initial mash temperature was 150oF.  In my haste,
I immediately applied heat to the mash with a 35K BTU cooker.  The Vollrath
pot has a SS tooled screen in the bottom.  Upon applying heat, the temperature
of the water/grain-dust solution below the screen increases rapidly.  By the
time I could thoroughly stir the mash, the temperature was at 190oF.  Oops!
Not only did the temperature hit 190oF, but it took a good 45 minutes for the
temperature to return to the target range.  I was hoping that someone could
confirm my seemingly-obvious diagnosis of the "grainy" taste.


  I also have a question regarding sparging.  I often read of two and three
hour sparges.  I use an elevated cooker/pot arrangement to bring heated water
to the grain bed via a sparge ring.  I have good control over the drip-rate.
My question involves what is considered appropriate in terms of a sparge rate.
With my first all-grain batch mentioned above, I "throttled-back" the flow
rate using the spigot in the bottom of the pot.  My objective was to sparge
for one hour and collect about six-and-a-half gallons of wort.  After about
45 minutes, the flow rate had reduced to a trickle (with the spigot now
wide open).  I would estimate that I collected about four gallons of wort.
Does this seem appropriate?  Should I be calculating my extraction rate?


  I can't imagine a better siphon-starter than a BrewCap.  I took a very
sharp 0.5" drill bit and drilled out the main stem of the BrewCap.  There is
a significant amount of excess material between the I.D. and the O.D. of the
main stem.  I soaked the BrewCap in hot water for a few minutes and inserted
my 0.5" O.D. hooked racking tube into this enlarged stem.  I slid an 8" piece
of tubing over the auxiliary stem into which I simply blow.  The siphon starts
every time and your mouth doesn't come anywhere near your beer.

This is backwards from my experience (and some cooking experience as well)
 - a bit of sweetness usually tends to bring out spices, ginger in
 particular.


>...The message is that 1) lots of recipes use about 3 oz of ginger 


FWIW, we've used a lot more than that, and had good results.  We used about
9 oz in an amber ale that turned out nicely, and about twice that in a
mead.  (these were 5 gal recipes)  The amber ale was a prize-winner some
years ago.  The mead is still young, hence a bit assertive, and you need to
calibrate the difference in alcohol content (meads generally being a lot
stronger), but it's not excessive.  Don't be too bashful!  I'd say you can
put half a pound of ginger in a serious ale, and a pound in a good mead.

That's a good test, but I wonder if you may not have boiled off some part
of the essence?  (conjecture only)  We have added ginger to the hot wort
or must, then transferred it to the primary and let it stay for at least
the first week or so.

Definitely a problem...nucleation points.  Anything rough will cause CO2 to
come out of solution rapidly.  (It could be a sanitation problem as you
suggested later, but I think not.  It's just a matter of providing the kind
of surface that makes CO2 bubble out.)

No, stay with fresh ginger.  You lose too much otherwise.  I'd suggest
trying to treat it more gently--get it hot enough to sterilize, but don't
boil it.

Subject: bikePUBcrawl




Despite suggestions to the contrary, I have decided to go ahead and carry
out this bicycle-based pub crawl, as scheduled, this Sunday, 07 March 1993.


I realize that the weather may not prove suitable but my intuition is that
it will be a glorious day. Early March in San Francisco usually is.


If anyone cares to skip this bicycle ride, it may happen again, if it proves
at all to be successful or reasonably well-attended, in a month or so. It's
also possible some other bikePUBcrawls might be scheduled, elsewhere in the
Bay Area ...


Those of you without the inclination to bicycle ( Russ Wigglesworth, to be
precise, but surely others as well ) are welcome to meet us at the brewery,
within the time range we estimate we'll be arriving within - see below for
the approximate schedule.


The destination is the Marin Brewing Company, 'in Larkspur, at 1809 Larkspur
Landing Circle( ph# 415.461.4677)', to quote a helpful soul. ( Thanks, PDK. )
The route is described below, although it is also reachable by car as well as
by ferry. ( This route is also summarized below, but I include other direc-
 -tions for purposes of redundancy of informedness - thanks, Paul J. )


I encourage everyone to invite a friend or three. Safety in numbers ...


Here's the schedule :


Sunday        1130        arrive at south end of Golden Gate Bridge, via bicycle from
                Fisherman's Wharf ( where car is optionally parked ), or,
                park on ocean side of bridge, by old WWII artillery bunkers
                and ride bicycle over to meeting point ( short stroll ).


        1200        depart from south end of Golden Gate Bridge, meeting on the
                west side of the bridge ( bicycle side ) between 1130 - 1200.
                bring a windbreaker, a backpack, and water, of course, as
                well as ancillary items - tools, spare tire, pump, headlight
                if you plan to ride at night, etc.


                Over bridge, loop around to road underneath, follow around
                to Sausalito, through Sausalito, through Mill Valley, under
                101 overpass, across marshes, to stop light `at` Blythedale.


        1300        Depart intersection of Blythedale, negotiate neighborhood
                via bike path, towards and parallel to 101, over hill and
                into Corte Madera, to Tamal Vista Street.


                Follow Tamal Vista to end, turn right, cross 101, turn left,
                follow bike path parallel to 101, into Larkspur.


        1400        Arrive Larkspur, check ferry schedules, converge on pub for
                cold ale and hot food.


        1600        Head back to San Francisco via ferry. Windbreakers useful.


        1800        Possible sunset gathering at the infamous Toronado.


Caveats :


        - There won't be any good way to deal with dead bicycles en
                route, so I ask everyone to


                (a)        determine that their vehicles are in good shape, and


                (b)        determine how they will cope with problems if they
                        occur ( I suggest Golden Gate Transit ).


                I'll have a pump but I'm not a professional bike mechanic.


        - Bring spare change in case you need to make calls or take a bus,
                as well as bicycle locks and the like.


        - Bring tools if you have them, between us we may be able to fix
                any small problems that crop up.


        - Mountain bikes are advised simply because they are more able to
                resist flat tires through their architecture, and flats
                are the single greatest nemisis of bicyclists.


        - Bring some snacks, we'll be working up an appetite ...


Here's a longer but more precise explanation provided by Paul Jasper.

Call me primitive, but I siphon beer the way we learned
to siphon gas as kids.....So far I've had only one lousy
batch (for totally different reasons), and a couple of
award winning brews.  I sterilize the tubes while doing
the rest of the equipment, so my hands are pretty clean.
If worried about contaminating the batch I sometimes hold
the end of the tube in my hand and suck through my hand.
I've done this much more often than we did gas as kids,
and brew tastes much better.


Daniel Roman,,,,,You don't think that clear beer appeals
to "women's taste", do you????  I was a little insulted
to be put into a category of people who like that kind of
thing.  Perhaps you (and Miller) should find someother
words to use for people who like clear beer.  Women I know
who drink beer (most of us brew our own) prefer strong ales
and stouts.

      Category award sponsored by CMB, the consortium of mega brewers

      a) American standard clear beer--effervescent, no color, no head, no
         malt flavor or aroma, no fruitiness, diacetyl, or esters,
         imperceptible hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
         Geographic subcategories:
         1) Milwaukee style--low levels of PCB's acceptable, must be in a

      b) American premium clear beer--a generally "bigger" version of American
         standard clear beer.  Geographic subcategories still applicable.


Also, look for Clear Beer Light and Clear Beer Dry for the 1995 competition.
And, for 1996, or '97 should anticipated legal hassles arise, expect to see a
Boston Clear Beer category, details relating to trademark restrictions and the
numbers of marketing weenies and lawyers required to assist in the brewing
process are yet to be worked out.

Message:
I am submitting this for Jeff, a fellow homebrewer who is 
experimenting with RIMS.  His statement is:
We use the standard RIMS revisited (from Zymurgy gadget issue) and 
the temp control works fine.  Temp readout is not working well 
because it is subject to some EMI (electro magnetic interference) 
caused by all the equipment (pump, heater etc).  Our real problem is 
the motor control which due to its open loop nature is unsatisfactory.
We are looking to implement a closed loop control using a Motorola 
chip TDA1185A or some other intigrated solution.  How does your motor 
control work?  Has anyone implemented a closed loop control?

    The recirculating wort now flows through the screen in the 
    middle as well as through the bottom. Since the primary goal 
    during the mash phase is to control temperature, it really doesn't
    matter that the flow is not uniform through the garin bed any
    more. The temperature seems to be reasonably uniform through
    the mash, and no compaction occurs.
    
    Also, by having the return flow from the pump exit below the 
    surface of the wort, I no longer have any foaming. That hopefully
    reduces HSE.
    
    At sparge time, I simply reduce the flow way down, pull the
    tube out, and give the mash a gentle stir. After about 5-10
    minutes, the wort is running clear again. I then turn the 
    pump off, start the pre-heated sparge water flowing in at 
    about the same rate as the wort drains out the bottom."


I've been thinking about RIMS designs for a year or so myself, and while
I'm hardly a mechanical engineer, it seems to me that it would be possible
and efficient to agitate the grain bed and maintain circulation, not with
a pump, but with a few sources of vibration around the container, which
would massage the grain and distribute the heat _very_ nicely, without
the problem of aeriating the solution.

Joe Thomas asks about boiling his brew water in an 8 gallon ceramic on 
steel kettle on an electric stove.


I've been doing this for several years now. It takes a few hours with the 
lid on the pot, but the water does eventually come to a boil, and maintains 
the boil for as long as needed. I use the one large burner on our stove, on 
HIGH. This tends to heat the stove top from heat reflected off the bottom 
of the kettle. I've found that placing aluminum foil on the stove top 
around the big burner prior to brewing helps the stove to survive. Before I 
did this I had several pieces of the stove top flake off after brewing, so 
beware!


************************************


Now a question I've been meaning to ask: How do I make a beer that is, for 
lack of a better term, thick? The best beers I have tasted have all seemed 
like they have more body, or greater viscosity, than the ones I brew using 
a partial mash. I don't want to brew a sweet beer, so useing less 
attenuative yeast is out. Do dextrins add body without a sweet taste? I've 
tried using 1/4 cup flaked barley in a 5 gallon batch without much luck. Is 
carapils or one of the Belgian malts a better choice?

     Yes folks, you have heard right.  Miller has produced a clear 
     liquid they are touting as a clear malt named "ZIMA".  We've tried 
     it and I suppose it will soon become a fad for the politically 
     correct.  Like Corona and a squeeze of lime. Yuk!  Anyway, IMHO it 
     tases like 7-Up and alcohol and, again, IHMO is not very pleasent.  
     It reminds me of my younger days in the service when we used to mix 
     "Everclear" (198 proof alcohol) with 7-Up for that quick buzz.  In 
     ZIMA, the alcohol tast/aroma is very pronounced as is the citrus 
     taste.  I've had one and will never (yes, I mean NEVER) have 
     another.
     
     My son will probably like it and buy it.  You know, he's the one

I've never used pectic enzymes, but I have a suggestion.  This worked
for me on a recent beer and in 6 months, no gushers, therefore, no
infection.  I surmised that any nasties would be on the OUTSIDE of the
fruit, therefore, I simply dipped the frozen cherries in very hot (212F)
water, for 15 seconds.  I figured that the coldness of the frozen centers
would keep the pectins from setting.  Well, they did a little bit, but
most of the cloudyness settled out and the beer is quite clear for a fruit
beer.  Perhaps you might want to consider freezing and blanching like I
did and then also using a bit of pectic enzyme?  I'm also eager to learn
about pectic enzymes, so I hope someone out there tells us more about them.
I'll bet there's something in the Fruit and Beer issue of Zymurgy (sorry,
don't recall which issue it is) on pectic enzymes, but I haven't had the
time to read all of it.

 Several weeks ago I racked again and added pectic enzyme and was astounded to

        set the kettle up so it sits on two elements. It
        takes awhile to come to a boil and you have to leave
        the lid on to get a good boil but it works. Usually
        when the water is heating up I have other things to

Get a 1 or 2 litre plastic juice bottle, and cut the bottom off of

below. Float this sucker in you pot to give the stove a help.
Also useful for raisnin temperature of cooler type mash tuns.
Note at 110v the element will be approx 1/4 the power rating for

Before I got my outdoors propane burner set up, I used to boil my wort
on a standard GE electric kitchen stove burner. I, too, was using a
ceramic on steel pot. I found the burner to be most inadequate.


I also found several methods to improve the situation.


 -       To get the wort hot initially, I used two smaller stainless
pots
        which has aluminum-clad bottoms. When the stuff was boiling, I
        moved it to the big ceramic on steel pot.


        (BTW, I still use the same pot, and am still unhappy with it. I
        have yet to find a place to buy a 6 gal and up stainless pot of
        decent construction with an aluminum-clad bottom [the aluminum
        transfers the heat better]).


 -       Before I hit on the use two burners with the smaller pots idea,
        I would heat up the large pot faster by putting on the lid,
        then
        first placing pot holders all over the top, then secondly
        draping
        kitchen towels over that, with the towels hanging down the
        sides
        to help hold the heat in.


        You can tell by the sound when you need to take the lid off to
        avoid boil-over. It is risky until you know though, and I did
        create one heck of a mess before I got the system down!


 -       If the burner does not put out enough heat to sustain a full
        boil with the lid off, then put the lid on between stirs after
        it hits the full boil. When you hear it going real good, take
        the lid off and stir it around for a bit. The full boil will
        continue with the lid off for a while, then die back down. Time
        for the lid again.


That is all the advice I can offer you on that one. Best of luck!

When people indicate the degree of extraction they get for all grain
batches what technique do they use?  I do the following:
After sparging I stir the contents of the brew pot and take a sample 
of the well mixed liquid.  I measure and temp adjust the specific gravity. 
I multiply this value times the volume in the brew pot and divide the
total by the number of pound of grain.
eg.  an sg of 40 in 7 gallons of liquid = 280 total sg points
divided by the 10 lbs of grain = 28 pts per lb.
I have acidified my sparge water, verified my grain bed temp was over 150
made sure that the Corona cracked grain was not under milled and verified
complete conversion using iodine tests of the stirred mash.  I have not had 
haze or clarity problems with my beer.  Sparge time is about 1.5 hours using 
a zappap lauter tun with a 1" false bottom.  What am I doing wrong that 
prevents me me from getting to the next level of all grain snobbery
the thirtysomething level of extraction all grain snob??

        3. Call one of the bottled water suppliers and ask
           for an empty glass carboy (there are a lot of
                  plastic ones around), for which you'll be asked
           to pay the deposit (~$8).
        4. Go to Whole Foods, or some other quality supplier,
           and buy a 5 gal w/water (~$15 including deposit) and
           use the water in your first batch (makes great SNPA
           if not distilled water) and the carboy is yours.
Cheers.

Subject: Peracetic acid


A recent thread concerning the possible use of peracetic as a sanitizer 
prompted me to search for some information on this compound. The Merck
Index lists peracetic as "a powerful oxidizer, strongly corrosive to
tissue, explodes violently upon heating to 110 deg. C." Coupled with 
the fact that one liter costs $90, this information left me wondering
if any significant benefit could be realized by using this compound.
Anyone have any practical experience with this substance?
[Cool glass of Chlorox, anyone? ;)  ]
