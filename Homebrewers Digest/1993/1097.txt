In HBD #1094 Markham Elliot asks:


Q: [paraphrased] how do you clean the oil and soy sauce out of
   a food grade bucket?


A: I would suggest using TSP. I am thankful that it had been
   recommended by many of the homebrew experts on the net for
   removing labels.


   One night, I obtained 30 1-pint beer bottles (previously
   Sapporo, Kirn, & Asahi) from a Japanese restaraunt. They
   make homebrew look good, are smaller than wine bottles,
   require less capping than U.S. domestic bottles, and are
   the perfect size for Bitter, Stout (and my SNPA-like). ;)


   Getting these bottles was not fun, but getting them clean
   and label free was easy :()>   The bottles all had lables
   (both paper and foil), as well as, tobacco & food particles
   (fish, ginger, wasabi, soy sauce, grease, etc.) on them. 


   I added 1 lb TSP (from  hardware and paintstores), and
   1 1/2 cups chlorine, to a trashcan with the beer bottles
   (which had been filled with just enough warm water to cover
   all the bottles).


   I let this covered for 2 weeks, and then removed the bottles
   (while wearing rubber gloves - chemical resistant ones from
   a hardware store). Most of the lables had simply fallen off.
   The 4 or 5 lables that were still on were removed by rubbing
   the ridged fingers of the gloves across them once or twice.
   None of the lables had any ink left on them. The food parts
   had been broken down.


   I rinsed out/off each bottle, and then placed in a bathtub
   of warm water & let sit for 2 hours (probably overkill, but
   someone at a homebrew shop warned not to get any in the
   bottle or I'd never get a beer head). I then ran the bottles
   through the dishwasher twice (I usually the dishwasher to
   sanitize the bottles, but I don't like to ignore advice
   from those of you with more experience...). I bottled with
   these 3 1/2 weeks ago. Had one yesterday... tasted great,
   with lots of carbination and great head retention.


Hope this info helps. Cheers!

 > 2. Top flight pumps are also crucial. Most pumps will eventually give
 a laminar flow. Some, however, will cause foaming at the start and at the end.
 
 I am still waiting for an answer to my question, "Why RIMS?" but as a chronic 
 tinker, I can't resist following the discussion.
 
 I now pump my beer from lauter tun to kettle, from kettle to primary and from 
 primary to secondary and have solved the foaming problem in a very simple 
 manner.  I simply put the appropriate resistor in series with the motor and a 
 separate switch to provide a low voltage startup.  Once the beer has driven 
 all the air out of the system, I switch to the normal voltage and foaming is 
 no longer a problem.  Perhaps some such system could be used for the RIMS 
 system.  
 
 I am using the pump from the kitchen sink of my motor home so it is 12 VDC 
 and makes it pretty easy.  However, I assume a standard light dimmer would 
 work on most small AC pumps and would be even more flexible.

 I think you got that a little mixed up.  It can not be called NA if it has 
 more than .5% alcohol in it.  I suspect Big Brother would be delighted if 
 milk produces called milk, beer.  Think of all the tax he could collect.  
 There is no alcohol tax on NA so the law is to prevent brewers from slipping

Subject: Sanitizing


With all the continuing talk of sanitizing agents, I'm suprised there
hasn't been more talk of my favorite agent- boiling water.  It doesn't
require rinsing, is environmentally safe and must be effective as it's
all I use - even for mead batches which sit in the secondary for months
and I've never had an infected batch.  I just boil the water in my wort
container for 10 minutes or so and then use it to sanitize the primary.


I sanitize my secondary by pouring hot tap water into the carboy- letting
it warm up and then adding about 2 gallons of boiling water.  It seems
to work great.

Subject: Keg sanitation / carbonation


Some of the text of my recent post on keg sanitaion was missing:
After filling the keg and letting some out of the 2 connetors
I top it off with water and shake to ensure good mixing of the
 Beed Brite. (this is the missing part)  I let this sit over nite.
I then drain the sanitizer into a carboy or another keg and 
proceed with the boiling liquid rinses.


Since I forced hot water out with CO2 the keg is filled with it,
its heavier than air.  I rack into the keg the CO2 blanket helping
reduce the potential for airation.  To force carbonate I set the
keg in my refridgerator , ideally it would be about 32F and
 preasureize to 30lbs.  I DO  NOT SHAKE THE KEG.  This could cause
your clear beer to get cloudy due to particles racked in.  I then
adjust the preasure 2 more times in 12 hour intervals.  I raise the
fridge temp to serving temp. and pour off about a quart or two of
foam this lowers the preasure and removes solids from the keg.
As the foam settles I drink the beer.

Subject: sanitize keg, "German" porter


  I've been sanitizing kegs by filling them with a couple of gallons of
boiling water, seal, pump in some CO2, open the tap to let some hot
water out, and then let sit for 30 minutes or so.  The heat will
kill off any nasties, and there's no rinsing involved.  The keg should
already be clean, btw.


   Rob asked about "German" hops (Hallertauer/Mt.Hood) being used in a
porter.  Just so happens in my younger/dumber days (before I became an
all-grain snob ;-), that I went even further, making an extract porter
with Hallertauer hops *and* Wyeast German ale yeast, #1007 I think it is.
Certainly not a "classic" porter, but perhaps the best extract brew I
ever made: clean, creamy, malty, and a wonderful hop nose.  Isn't it
perhaps likely that in the early days of porter, continental hops were
used?  Perhaps even German yeast?  What does Foster's Porter book say?

Subject: Doppelbock Names


It's well known that, traditionally, doppelbocks are named using the
"-ator" suffix, as in the familiar "Celebrator" or "Salvator" doppelbocks.
Just for fun, I decided to generate a nearly comprehensive list of English
words that end this way.  On my Unix box, I simply used "grep" for the 
string "ate" on the dictionary file (usually in /usr/share/dict on most
Unix machines), and changed "ate" to "ator" globally in an editor.
 
There were, of course, a few words I rejected.  Some obvious misspellings
occurred, such as "watermelon" becoming "watorrmelon";  and also a few
occurrences of senseless words, such as "roommator" and "prostator."  
I made a single pass through the list and deleted these obvious mistakes.
 
Here are a few potential doppelbock names my search turned up.
Apologies if they have been used before....
 
 -Names Schwarzenegger or Eastwood would be proud of:
 Annihilator, Assassinator, Dominator, Eliminator, Eradicator, Exterminator,
 Devastator, Detonator, Liquidator, Gladiator, and, of course, Terminator.


 -Names for scientists and engineers:
 Accelerator, Collimator, Correlator, Numerator, Denominator, Differentiator,
 Lubricator, Exponentiator, Evaluator, Radiator...


 -Names relating to the alcoholic nature of beer:
 Decimator, Exhilarator, Hallucinator, Incapacitator, Intoxicator, Sedator,
 Perspirator...
 
And many others.  Some examples I don't think anyone would want to use.
For example:  Nauseator, Regurgitator, Urinator, Flatuator, and a few other
more offensive names I will avoid mentioning. :-)
 
The complete list is 594 records long, and hence, too lengthy to post here.
I would be happy to e-mail the file to anyone who is interested.

I don't know anything about Phil's, but a screen type false bottom
requires installing a controllable spigot in the cooler.  IMHO, a
copper manifold is easier to build, more effective for sparging, and
doesn't require modifications to your cooler.


I have fairly detailed plans for my manifold system.  They're long,
so I won't post here unless there is a great demand.  Email me if
you'd like them.  BTW, this system is a scaled down version of the
lautering system used at New Belgium Brewing here in Fort Collins CO.


At the risk of sounding snobbish :-), if you're going to outfit your
cooler this way, you'll already have most of the equipment you'll need
to go all-grain.  A large kettle for boiling is the only other thing
you'll need, and

yes, you can use two pots in a pinch (I've done it myself).  A risk is
that you won't get consistent hop extraction between batches, since the
volume of wort being boiled is a factor in the extraction rate.  A
larger kettle will make life much easier, though.

I sparge in a 1' & 2.5' square cooler, with a grain bed depth anywhere
from 7"-14".  The pipe is only 5/16" id and 7" long, with slots every
inch.  The last time I tried keeping the H2O above the top of
the grain was with ~20 lbs of grain => 10"-12" deep.  I verified by
tatse testing that different areas of the bed were better rinsed than
others.  I only got 20 pts/lb (this is based on the wort that actually
makes it into the primary - If you count spillage & the gallon of trub
that I leave behind you get significantly higher figures).


What are the dimensions of your cooler?  How deep is the grain bed?
Is the pipe 1/2" inside diameter or outside?  (that's a big pipe).  


>Nor do I see why restricting

Its kind of hard to explain, especially w/o graphics.  The problem is
anologous to that encountered with your auto's exhaust manifold.
Compare with a set of racing headers.  Visions of "sparge headers"
fill my mind...


I still need more experimentation with my new setup.

 Well, I would certainly like to see the details of that information.  
 Frankly, I have my doubts.  Pure bleach, sloshed around a keg or bucket would 
 leave a thin film on the surface that would be far higher in concentration 
 than a full keg of weak solution.  That film would remain on the surface, 
 long enough before evaporating, to provide an effective bacteriocide.  I also 
 suggest that in a closed container, either a keg for a few minutes only, or a 
 plastic carboy with a lid, indefinitely, the gas evaporated inside would 
 provide ample security.
 
 I switched from dry to liquid yeast so I can be convinced but someone is 
 going to have to try harder on this one.

Subject: On Brewing Sugar




As penance for quoting an author while relying on memory alone,
I have typed the following material on brewing sugars from
H Lloyd Hind's "Brewing Science and Practice", which was written
in the 1930s and stands as the best source of information on
traditional British brewing practice.  There is a great deal of
very technical information about the production of various sugars
and their chemical/physical structure, some of which may not
even be accurate given advances in the physical sciences, and in
any case is well beyond our needs.  There is also information about
specific sugar blends produced for the British brewing trade, but
without brand names; in any case, the information is more than
50 years old so I left it out. 


=================================================================
BREWING SUGARS


230--Sugars as Malt Adjuncts


Various sugars and starch conversion products can be added in the
copper to supplement the fermentable extract formed in the mash tun
by conversion of the starch of malt, but similar restrictions in
respect of the quantity used apply as with cereal adjuncts, on 
account of the lack of nitrogenous yeast nutrients. They provide a
means for varying the composition of worth, within limits set by
the requisite balance between sugars and non-sugars, supply
extract which may be either entirely or only partly fermentable,
give characteristics of fulness and flavour that are appreciated
in some cases, increase the stability of beer by replacement of
nitrogenous extract and yield beer that will become more readily and
rapidly brilliant than when brewed with malt alone. Primings are
strong solutions which must not, in this country, exceed 1150
specific gravity but should not be much less. They are sometimes
added in the fermenting vessel at the close of primary fermentation
but, more frequently, in storage tank or cask to promote rapid
condition and, in some cases, on account of their flavour. The 
sweet and luscious flavour of some sugars does not entirely
disappear when the sugar has been fermented but gives additional
fulness to the beer. In some cases, sugars which are not entirely
fermentable are selected.


The sugars used in brewing comprise


(1) Cane sugar, derived from the sugar cane and, much less frequently,
from sugar beet.
(2) Invert sugar, made by inversion of cane sugar.
(3) Starch sugars, including corn syrups and glucose, manufactured
by the conversion of the starch of cereals, usually maize [that's
_corn_, Norte Americanos].
(4) Mixtures of these, their utility in copper or cask depending on
their flavour and fermentability.
(5) Caramels, made from cane sugar or glucose.
(6) Lactose or milk sugar, which is only used in very small quantity
in some milk stouts.
(7) Honey, even less used.


Maltose, which might appear to be the most suitable sugar to replace
that formed from malt in the mash tun, is not used in the pure state,
but exists as a constituent of corn syrups with dextrin and glucose.
Lactose differs from cane sugar, invert sugar, maltose and glucose
in that is is unfermentable by ordinary brewery yeasts, while certain
of the higher starch conversion products are appreciated because
they are only partly or slowly fermentable.


(231) Cane Sugar


The sugars obtained from the sugar cane, sugar beet, sugar maple,
certain palsm or the stem of sorghum are, when purified, of identical
chemical composition. All of them are sucrose. The natural juices
from which they are derived, however, differ very considerably in
flavour owing to the many other substances which they contain. For
example, the root of the beet contains a larger proportion of mineral
salts than the sugar cane and decomposition products are formed with
the larger quantities of lime necessarily used in the course of
clarification, which give an objectionable flavour to the juices and
raw sugar. These render the latter unfit for consumption until
refined. The raw sugars from the cane are, on the other hand, very
luscious but they do not all taste the same, varying considerably
according to the place in which the cane was grown or the treatment
they received during extraction and preparation, characteristic
differences being found in sugars from Cuba, Java, Barbadoes, Trinidad,
St. Domingo, Mauritius, etc. Since the value of cane sugars in
brewing depends so largely on the flavours they communicate, even
after all the sugar itself has been fermented, the principal source
must be the sugar cane, which yields juices possessing these
properties in their most attractive form. The final product of the
refineries, from whatever source it originally came, is among the
purest substances commercially obtainable, but it lacks the
distinctive characteristics of flavour demanded in brewing. As a 
source of carbohydrate extract it is unexcelled and can be used
without hesitation under circumstances in which those flavours are not
required, but the raw or partially refined sugars from the cane are
more attractive in most cases.


[... some technical information on the refining process deleted ...]
Usually the lusciousness of the sugars increases with greater 
proportions of other substances derived from the cane, some of which
are in a colloidal state, and many such sugars, among them West
Indian and Brazil sugars of comparatively low polarisation, are used
in brewing on account of the fulness and sweetness they give. Other
low polarising sugars, such as that from Mauritius, have a somewhat
acrid after-flavour. On account of these different flavours, great
care must be exercised in selecting brewing sugars, fermentation
tests being desirable as the original flavour is not always a good
guide to that left after the sugar is removed.


[...]


Cane sugar is used both in the copper and as a priming. Raw sugars
of good class are generally employed for the former purpose and
when of good class are generally employed for the former purpose
and when of suitable purity should not contain excess of undesira-
ble substances or micro-organisms. Sugars of this type and pure
crystals can also be used for priming but candy sugar is preferred
by many. Cane sugar is rapidly inverted when added to cask, the
change being generally complete in about 24 hours. This process is
believed to be an essential preliminary to fermentation. It is
carried out by the enzyme inertiase or sucrase secreted by the yeast
and does not appear to affect the fermentative activity of the
yeast or influence the rate of fermentation. Baker and Hulton
found that cane sugar and invert primings were fermented at sub-
stantially the same rate in beer under ordinary cellar conditions
and that about one-third of either sugar still remained
unfermented after 7 days in cask when added at normal priming rates.




[Hind goes on to offer technical information about the cane sugars
used in brewing: refined crystals, candy sugar, brown sugar and
yellow crystals. "The yellow crystals represent the high grade
products turned out at many cane factories, and of which Demerara 
sugar is well known."]

Dear Representative (or senator)
   As an avid beer connoisseur, I would like to endorse economically viable
brewpub legislation.
   Brewpubs provide jobs, increase the tax base, increase tourism, increase
capital investments, and stimulate interest in locally-produced products
served straight from the brewery. They do not threaten the existing system.
 Please consider revising the TABC Code to allow small breweries: 1) the
right to sell for both on and off-premise consumption, and 2) the right of
limited self-distribution. The great State of Texas will benefit from a
burgeoning niche industry currently enjoyed in 42 other states.
  Please vote YES for the Sunset Bill's expanded brewpub legislation.
Sincerely,  JoeTax-payer&voter&beer-drinker

Subject: Boiling pots?


After several boilovers using a small enamel canner on my stovetop, I am
ready to get a larger pot. I have read (Papazian, Miller) that Aluminum 
is to be avoided.


If not Aluminum, then the only choices seem to be enamel or stainless.
Where can one obtain a reasonably priced 32 qt. boiling pot?


I checked the local (Baton Rouge, LA) restaurant suppliers, they only 
carry Aluminum. Since restaurants apparently use predominantly Aluminum
for boiling, what's the difference between wort and restaurant food that
makes Aluminum unsuitable for wort? Is it the acidity of wort and/or its 
contact time w/the Aluminum? Or what?

Subject: second mail-order hop source for Canada


        There was some talk a while back about where hop rhizomes could be
found in Canada.  Well, just received my March/April copy of Harrowsmith
magazine and noticed an ad for a mail-order brew store in Ottawa called the
"Hop Stop" advertising hop rhizomes for sale.  Therefore, I decided to pass
on the two sources I know of for hop rhizomes in Canada.
         
mail: Hop Stop, 1661 Montreal Road, Ottawa, Ontario K1J 9B7
FAX: 613-748-3052
Tel: 613-748-1374
Don't know anything about this business but they offer a free catalouge.


        The other source of hop plants I know of is Richter's in Goodwood,
Ontario. They list the beer hop varieties: Cascade, Hallertauer, Mount
Hood, Nugget and Willamette for sale as plants at $7.00 a plant in their
1993 catalogue. There stock is really expanding so it quite possible that
more varieties will be available in the future.  I have ordered from them
before and the plants while often pricey were very healthy and arrived in
perfect condition.  Get them to throw in their catalogue. It's probably the
most informative and interesting herb catalogue produced by anybody.

Subject:  Indoor boiling


Hi all,


    There's been some discussion lately of boiling indoors on electric stoves. 
One poor fellow was boiling in 4 pots on his stove, another was burning out 
his elements. Well I did 2-pot boils for about 25 batches. And then I saw 
the light. As a new convert, I feel that I must share my happiness with all 
of you:


    I converted an old scratched 7 gallon plastic primary bucket into a
boiler. I used 2 1kW heating elements from a scientific surplus company
`at`4.50 USD each, so this is definitely a cheap approach. 
The great thing about it is how effortless the boil becomes - no boilovers, 
easy cleanup. I cannibalized my counterflow chiller, which was tough to 
sanitize and constantly clogging with hops anyway, and now just sanitize an 
immersion chiller during the boil.  The trub and hops drop to just below the 
level of the spigot, and from there I splash it out into the primary. MUCH 
easier! I have been brewing my brains out since I switched. 


    If anyone would like more info on the supplier, just drop me a line: 
<poirier`at`inrs-ener.uquebec.ca>. And thank you to all who responded to my 
coriander question.


    While I'm at it, I'll be in San Francisco, San Diego, and all points 
between in April. (I've already booked a tour with Anchor!) Any beer type 
suggestions (sent privately, of course) would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks.

I don't think that the amount of bleach we use in sanitizing is 
significant compared to other uses.  One bottle of bleach from the 
store will last me for quite a while.  Bleach used to wash white 
clothes seems to go much faster.  
(Note:  We can't use bleach at home in the wash due to the iron in the
water...it makes some really nice rust colored clothes)

I would agree with that assessment.  Both CH3COOH and H202 will decompose
in somewhat more friendly products.  Using *DILUTE* versions of this
may be allright.  By dilute, I mean vinegar and hydrogen peroxide that 
you can buy in the pharmacy or grocery store.  I'm not sure on the
specifics of using these two in a mixture at low concentrations.  Then again, 
as I was informed in e-mail, using vinegar and steam is an old and accepted
method in Germany and it seems safer to me.  Steam cleaning/sterilizing may
be a good way to do it. But not everyone has a steam line in their house.

Something else that was just being discussed in e-mail.  One possible 
drawback to using bleach as a sanitizing agent is the formation
of byproducts that you can taste.  You probably formed some chlorophenols; 
they are readily tasteable at the ppb level.  Rinsing the chlorine out 
better should solve the problem.

I've heard that Draino has other stuff in it besides Sodium Hydroxide or

KOH (I don't recall which).  Check the label and use the pure stuff.

I've read the opposite, but would note that the ususal way that a mild
bacterial/wild yeast infection becomes apparent to us homebrewers is
gushers.  Now I don't mean to imply that Jack has infected beer (I've
tasted recent batches and indeed it does not taste/smell infected), but
I know that Jack kegs rather than bottles.  A minor infection in a kegged
beer would not be apparent, whereas the same level of infection in a bottled
beer would cause gushing.  It also depends on how long you keep the beer.
Certainly Stainless Steel is a much better choice for a fermenter than
plastic.

Boiling crystal or any other barley malt will give you astringent flavors
which are, sort of bitter, but sort of not.  Peel a dark grape and just
chew the skin -- that's tannins -- is that the flavor you reported?
If so, then it's the boiling of the grains.  Also note that bitterness
(especially in the finish) can be intensified considerably by hard
water -- sulfates especially.  Are you adding a lot of Epsom Salts,
Gypsum or other sulfates?
