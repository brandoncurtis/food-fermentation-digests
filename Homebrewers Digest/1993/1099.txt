Subject: Re: Stuck fermentation?


 
Hi, all,


     I have a question about a batch I'm brewing at the moment. I think
the fermentation is stuck, but I'd like some input from the rest of you
out there. 
     I'm making an American Pale Ale using Wyeast #1056. I broke the inner
seal of the yeast package, last Tuesday night, intending to brew on
Thursday. By mid-Wednesday, the package was ready for use. Thursday
afternoon, after the boil, the wort took quite a while to cool. Since I
don't have a chiller at this time, I put the bucket outside, surrounded by
snow (Minnesota). It still didn't cool very fast, and I was running low on
time, so I pitched the yeast at about 83 degrees and placed the vessel in
our basement which is about 64 degrees. 24 hours later there was no sign
of fermentation, so I brought it upstairs, hoping that a change of temp
would get it kick started. After a few hours in a 75 degree room, it
started bubbling. It reached a peak of about 2 bubbles per second Saturday
afternoon, then fell off to almost nothing. The other batches I've brewed,
had a much longer and healthier fermentation than that. 
     Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated. Please send replies
to my email address. Thanks.
     I think I'm going to go get some more yeast, and see if that works. 


Later,
   Colin

Subject: Cara-pils haze


I've been reading the digest for a few weeks now, and it seems to
be very helpful in answering novice questions.  So, here is my first
posting:


My first attempt at a lager was a modified version of Papazian's
Crabalocker German Pils, and I brewed it on 2/21/93.  The ingredients
were 3 kg (6.6 lb) Ireks Munich light unhopped extract, .5 lb Cara-pils
malt, 1.5 oz Hallertauer (boiling), .5 oz Saaz (boiling), .5 oz Hallertauer
(flavor), .5 oz Saaz (flavor), 1 oz Hallertauer (aroma), and 14 gm
European lager yeast (G.W. Kent).


The Cara-pils was put in a muslin bag in 1.5 gal water and removed when
water began to boil.  Then the extract and boiling hops were added.  The 
flavor hops were added at 30 min, and the aroma hops were added for the
last 2 min of a 60 min boil.  


It fermented for 5 days at room temp in plastic primary (it just 
wouldn't start in the cold 50 degree closet).  I guess this makes it 
a steam beer, right?  Anyway, then I moved it back to the cold closet
until 3/10/93 (10 days in primary).  It was then racked to the glass
secondary.  At that point it was very cloudy, and disappointingly
an amber color.  It has been five days now, and the haze has mostly 
settled.


My questions are:  Did the Cara-pils cause the haze? (I used it to
give it a little more body, but have since learned that it is not
like other specialty grains.)  I've heard of using gelatin for 
trapping the haze, is this a good idea, and if so how to do it.
And lastly, if I do use gelatin should I be concerned that it would
trap all the yeast too? (I do need some yeast in my bottles for
carbonation.)


Thanks for the help.

Subject: Help: Teflon a problem?




I've followed previous threads about stainless vs aluminum pots,
and read papazian's and miller's recommendations. I've used a
5 gal SS brewpot ($24.95) up til now.


The problem with this size pot is that I can only brew 4-1/4
gal wort. I'd prefer to brew a full batch (for reasons I've
read), and when I start doing all-grain batches, I'll need
a larger pot.


I've found a 6 gal aluminum pot with "Silver Metallic" interior
coating. I suppose this is Teflon with a name intended to suggest
of Silver Stone. The pot has insulated handles. The lid is
see-through, and has 1 small (sneaker shoe-lace eylet) vent in it.
It was only $60.


My question is this: If anyone has tried brewing in a Teflon or Silver
Stone coated brewpot, what were your results? If you haven't tried this,
your opinion is still welcome.


Thanks in advance,
steve

Ah, I didn't know that the recipe is Ron Page's, but that certainly explains 
it.  Ron is a great brewer from New England, but he has also admitted that he 
likes to keep his recipes secret and rarely puts down the exact recipe 
formulation on an entry form.  This recipe is clearly one of those cases where 
he fudged the numbers on the hop bill.  


It also points out the need to analyze a recipe and see whether it is 
reasonable before you brew it.  The AHA definitely should have done that to all 
of the recipes in the 'Winner's Circle' before they published it.  Beginning 
brewers don't need nasty surprises like Ron's FH Ale.

Subject: Succanat (tm)


Well, since Dan Hall let the cat out of the bag:


I've been using Succanat (tm) for the last few years.  It's a great (even
better) substitute for demerara or turbinado sugar in brewing.  It is organic,
unpurified, evaporated cane juice with no additives.  It looks like a brown,
powdery/crystalline solid, similar to dark dry malt extract though less
homogeneous in appearance.  According to the info on boxes of the stuff, it has
a nutritional make-up very close to malt extract with similar calorie, fat, and
protein counts.  It is also chock full of trace minerals and vitamins, unlike
any processed sugar.  Expensive perhaps???  Nahhh, at the Bread and Circus (in
Central Sq., Cambridge, MA) it is in the bulk bins for $1.49/lb.  I've also 
seen it on shelves of local health food stores.




I've successfully used it many times in British-style ales - bitters, pale ales,
scotch ales - and the yeasties love it.  As Dan surmised, it does seem to have a
toffee-ish, caramel flavor.  I'm not sure that I'd use it in a tripel (I'd go
for straight corn sugar to keep the color down) but a dubbel might do well from
its addition.


Give it a go.

Well, without getting into an argument here, my experience with a
camp-cooler mash tun, using British malts, is that I get a clear runoff
in about the same volume.  There is occasionally a little flour in the
first pint or so but from then on it's clear sailing.

Once again, without trying to start a fight, I would say that using lye
requires more than a little caution.  It's not that the stuff doesn't
clean, just that it can also do a number on soft parts of the human body
- -- like eyes.  If you observe careful brewers in micro- and
macro-breweries, I think you'll find them using highly caustic compounds
only in closed systems; when they're used for cleaning small parts,
etc., they are handled with a great deal of caution, using rubber gloves
(and hopefully safety glasses).  Personally, I'm a little absent minded
(must be the aluminum), and I prefer to use cleaners that take a little
longer but aren't likely to melt my eyeballs.

I think the reality is that beers that are bottle-conditioned last --
well, not forever -- but far longer than cp-filled bottles that haven't
been filtered and stabilized to death.  Of course, those of us in the
Great NW are known to hop our beers to a point of petrification, so
that's probably a factor.  Then again, it's definitely not Bud.

Subject: Copper lautering manifold, Part 1


I've had enough requests for instructions for my sparge manifold that
I decided I'll go ahead and post them.  The article will be split into
two parts so the digest daemons won't reject it due to length.


The manifold is made up of 1/2" copper tubing, along with tees, endcaps,
and elbow fittings.  It looks sort of like a tree branch; a main stem
with arms coming off of it, alternating left and right.  One end of the
stem is capped, the other end leads to an elbow that angles up 90
degrees to a standpipe.  Here's an ASCII pic I hope will make it clear:


                                _ end cap
                                |
                            tee +---------] cap
                                |
                       [--------+
                                |
                                +---------]
                                |
                       [--------+
                                |
                         elbow  \
                      90 deg up  --------------->==========
                                    standpipe      siphon hose
                            (this would be coming out of the screen)


The length of the stem and the length and number of arms can be adjusted
to fit whatever kettle or cooler you use.  The manifold should fit
exactly in the the bottom of the vessel when you're done.


The arms of the manifold each have a number of slots cut in them, spaced
a couple of centimeters apart, not quite halfway through the tube (I
used a hacksaw to make them).  You can also use a hacksaw to cut all the
other pieces of tubing, but buying a $5 tubing cutter will make life a
lot easier.  The tees, caps, and elbow fitting will already fit very
neatly, so you don't even have to solder anything together.


When assembled, the slots will face down to the bottom of the vessel.
This is to keep the grain from clogging them, and so you don't leave a
half inch of wort in the bottom.  The standpipe should come up the side
of the vessel to just below the rim, so you can put the lid on.


You will need to come up with some way to connect your siphon hose the
the 1/2 inch standpipe.  We found a 1/2" to 3/8" ID reducer fitting and
a short piece of 3/8" OD tubing will connect nicely to a standard vinyl
siphon hose:


                         -----===
                              |  \__  3/8"  _______
          1/2 inch copper     |redu |------|siphon hose
                              | cer_|------|______
                              |  /
                         -----===


Also, the reducer and 3/8" OD copper need to be soldered so they don't
suck in air, since they're the only fittings that sit above the liquid
level.  [Note:  soldering copper is easy; it requires a few cents worth
of plumbing-safe solder and flux and a $15 propane torch.  Ask the
friendly folks at your local hardware store.]

Subject: Copper lautering manifold, Part 2


(...continued)


As you might have guessed by now, you don't need a drain hole in your
vessel at all; just have the standpipe up the side of the kettle and
siphon from there.  You could somehow attach the manifold to a drain,
but I don't think it's worth the trouble.


The manifold rests right on the bottom of the vessel, and my "spigot" is
simply a hose clamp at the end of the siphon hose.  Buy one of the
plastic hose clamps that has variable click-stops.


Clean the manifold with hot water.  Since it isn't soldered, you can
just disassemble it when your done.  You can clean it with a small
bottle brush if you like, and if you're worried, you can soak the pieces
in a metal-safe sanitizer like ChemPro.  Whatever you do, *don't* try to
clean it with bleach.  Bleach and copper don't get along very well.  And
clean the manifold thoroughly with soap and hot water before using it
for the first time to remove oils and such used while manufacturing the
tubing.


Here's how the thing works:  assemble the manifold and place it in the
vessel, slots down.  Add your mash water and grain on top of it.  When
the mash is done, attach the siphon hose to the standpipe and start the
siphon going into another vessel.  As the level of the mash water drops,
add your sparge water so the water level stays an inch or two above the
grain bed.  When you run out of sparge water, or decide to stop adding
water, let the siphon run until all the water has been siphoned out.
You'll be amazed, this system gets almost every single drop!


This manifold system has a number of advantages:
1.  No need to modify your pot/cooler, so it can still be used for
    other things.
2.  You don't have to transfer the mash to another container
3.  No transfer means your grain bed won't get compacted, so your sparge
    won't stick.
4.  No transfer means your grain bed won't drop in temperature.
5.  You're using the suction of a siphon, not just gravity, to draw off
    the liquid.  This also lessens the chance of a stuck sparge.
6.  The wort runs off clear after only a quart or so.


Of course, this isn't the only lautering system that has these
advantages, but it has worked well for me.

Subject: SNPA culture beginner questions


I have a couple of beginner questions on culturing yeast from 
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.


I have tried culturing SNPA yeast using the following procedure:


        1)  Prepare an SG 1.040 highly hopped wort, strain out 
            hops, and reurn to boil for another 15 minutes in 
            covered pan.


        2)  Carefully sterilize a pyrex measuring cup by boiling 
            for 30 minutes.  Cover with Al foil which has been 
            flamed.  Cool wort by placing covered pan in ice cubes.


        3)  Open SNPA, pour out almost all beer, sterilize bottle 
            top using alcohol and flame.  Pour cool wort into SNPA 
            bottle, add airlock, wait.


        4)  After 1 day, contents of SNPA bottle at high krausen.  
            Step culture into Erlenmeyer using similar paranoid 
            sterilization procedures.


        5)  After 1 more day, culture in Erlenmeyer at high 
            krausen, looks good.


At this point everything seems OK, but when I went to pitch, I 
smelled the starter, and it smelled vaguely of bubblegum, which 
I have been told is a sign of possible contamination.  Lacking 
an alternative, I pitched it anyway.


I would apreciate any comments on the above procedure, especially 
if accompanied by alternatives which are known to work.  I have 
used liquid cultures before, with success, by the way.


Also, provided I can get the procedure to work, I would like to 
know if anyone uses cultures from SN Porter or Stout.  I haven't 
seen this mentioned anywhere.


Thanks a lot for all your help.

A light dimmer is not the right thing, they modulate the duty cycle rather
than control tha voltage.  There are motor speed controls that are made for
bathroom fans and such that are much like the dimmers, but should work
better.

Subject: Lye, Vierka yeast


greetings.


About lye:  I discovered last weekend that lye is the principal
ingredient in the rubber-gloves species of oven cleaners, so Jack's
experience with shining up everything in sight doesn't surprise me.
Personally I am of the opinion that violent chemicals have no place
in food prep, so I don't use 'em, but to each their own....


About Vierka yeast:  Has anyone used this stuff before?  I used one
of their wine varieties for a mead last weekend, and it still ain't
bubblin'.  The weird part was, instead of the little yellow globs I'm
used to in dry yeast packets, there were what looked like dried herbs
in the package.  I assumed they were the equivalent of Budweiser's 
beechwood chips, i.e. flocculation assisters coated with yeast, but
then they could have been dried leaves sold as yeast, too....  Is this
normal, and does it require special treatment?

A year or so ago, I heard of the results of a test that was done by several
brewers from Chicago Beer Society, in which they bottled part of a batch
with Zapata Smartcaps (now called PureSeal) and part with regular caps.
A blind tasting by experienced BJCP judges resulted in the following
determination: the hop nose of the PureSeal bottles was much fresher and
prominent.  For those unfamiliar with PureSeal (aka Smartcaps), they are
made with an oxygen-scavenging plastic which also is an oxygen barrier
for up to (I believe) 6 months.  It appears as if the first thing that
oxygen reacts with and ruins is the hop nose.  Tim: Could the loss of the
Saaz nose be due to air in the headspace?

Subject:  Plastic boiler info


Hi all,
  
  Well I was inundated with requests for more information on my plastic 
boiler setup, so I'll just post the basics here:


  I took an old plastic primary, 6.5 Imperial gallons, originally from my 
local homebrew supply shop, now well past retirement age. I drilled a hole 
for the spigot (a used plastic drum tap) about 1 inch from the bottom, and 
for the two heating elements, I drilled holes 90 degrees CW and CCW from the 
spigot, about 2 and 3 inches up.


  The elements are "1 kW, 115 VAC.  Chrome plated copper heating element. 
Features automatic shutoff when not immersed in water.  Complete with mounting 
nut and gaskets.  Designed for through wall installation in a 1-9/16" dia. 
hole (3/16" thick approx.).  Electrical connection via recessed 3-wire socket;  
supplied with mating 3-wire stub cord, 12" long; opposite end stripped.  Size 
4-3/4" long x 3-1/2" wide.  New. Wt, 1 lb.  Order No. TM89HVC5702...$4.50 US."
H & R Company, 18 Canal Street, P.O. Box 122, Bristol, PA 19007-0122.
Sales 1-800-848-8001 Fax 215-788-9577 Business Office 215-788-5583.


Things to keep in mind:


 - The gaskets suck. I made my own with the stuff you buy in sheets at the 
hardware store. And the gasket that came with my drum tap turned to mush.
 - You'll have to put your own plug on. The nice thing about the electrical 
connector through thw bucket wall is that you just unplug the element when 
you're manipulating the bucket, so there are no cords in your way.
 - It takes the 2 elements to get a good boil going, but only one to keep 
things humming nicely. I plug one in the outlet on my stove, and one  in a 
countertop outlet.
 - So far no leaks or problems. My local homebrew shop is now trying them, 
with good success, and in fact plans to sell them to customers (gee, maybe 
I could ask for a commission....Maybe some 2-row....). It's true 
that the plastic is not rated for these temperatures, but I've been told  
that neither is the electrim bin.
 - No scorching so far. The elements get coated in hot break material that 
needs to be cleaned off, but that's it.


  I only picked plastic because it was easy. I'll stick with it as long as 
it works. When I get around to it, though, I have a 12 gallon SS Labatt's 
keg that I got at a scrapyard for 25 bucks (about 1.50 US...), which I'll 
fit with the elements.


  If anyone has any questions or suggestions, please let me know.

 Congratulations of proving that you have a world class mind, capable of 
 re-inventing the easymasher.
 
 Just a few suggestions that you may find useful.  If you use soft copper 
 tubing instead of pipe, you can put a double bend in in so that the screen 
 sits right on the bottom.
 
                   |
     spigot    ----|-----\
               ----|----\ \
                   |     \ \
                   |      \ \ ----------- screen
                   |       \-------------
                   ------------------------------bottom_
 
 Upon reading it again, that is the only suggestion I can offer.  You will get 
 mountains of mail wailing about your use of window screen but I used it for 
 months and it works just fine.  
 
 Aside from the simplicity, the advantages of this system are as follows:
 
 The wort will run clear almost immediately and re-circulating gallons of 
 turbid runoff becomes other people's problems.  This leads to the other 
 advantage...
 
 You can thoroughly stir the mash several times during the sparge without 
 disturbing the "filter bed" because it re-establishes itself so easily.  You 
 thereby know for certain that you are getting maximum rinsing of the grain by 
 the sparge water.   Contrary to popular opinion, the potential for extract 
 efficiency with this system is greater than in any other, as of result of 
 this feature.

 Thanks for the stimulus. I have been too lazy to make one but as they say, a

  > After sparging, I usually end up with 6-8 gallons of sweet wort.  I
 usually boil for 90 minutes total... end up with about 4 gallons of bitter 
 wort...
 
 First of all, there is a big difference between 6 and 8.  If it is 6, ending 
 up with 4 after 90 min is just about right. Frankly, I do not think there is 
 such a thing as too vigorous a boil.  If you lose too much wort, just start 
 with more.  I would figure on about a gallon per hour of boil.
 
 Under no circumstances, do you want to cover the kettle.  Part of the reason 
 for boiling is to concentrate the wort.

Subject: weisse bier and decoction


Hello all,
   Thanks to those who responded to my questions regarding
Weisse Bier.   Anyway, This weekend I brewed a 1/2 batch (2.5 gal)
using a single decoction process (my first time).   My recipe for this
was
     3 lb german wheat
     1.5  american 6 row
     1/2 oz hallertau pellets
     wyeast bavarian weisse (3056 I believe)


     I saved about 1.25 quarts of wort for kreusen.


I mashed in with 1 quart/pound of water. My first question
is: when I pull my decoction for separate heating and boiling
it is not very liquid, and indeed, during boiling it gets
pastey(starts sticking to bottom). Should I have added more
water during this phase so it is not so dry?


Also, re: lautering and extraction effeciency.... is there
a relationship between duration of lauter and extraction rate.
My lauter for this exercise was fairly quick (10 min) and I
ended with a 1.038 wort.


It is currently fermenting nicely and doing fine.

  I am trying culture the yeast from several bottles of SNPA.  I boiled up three
cups of water with six tablespoons of DME and cooled the mixture.  I then poored
the wort into a steril half-gallon jug.  I then poored all but the last inch of
the SNPA out of five bottles.  I shook the remaning inch of SNPA in order to get
the yeast in solution and poored the dregs into the half-gallon jug.  Nothing
happened for 2 1/2 days, the brew never fermented very fast.  At the peek it 
fermented at maybe 1 bouble per 30s.  Is this slow fermentation normal??
By THe Way (BTW) I did vigorously shake the wort to ariate the wort before adding  
adding the SNPA yeast.  How do you culture yeast from a bottle?  Should I assume
it is OK??  How can I tell if it is infected??  Is the yeast OK?
