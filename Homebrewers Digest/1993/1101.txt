Subject: sterilization, aeration, filtration.


I've been reading an intersting book the last week:


The Biotechnology of Malting and Brewing, by J.S. Hough
(Cambridge Univ Press, 1985)


Anyway,  while reading it, i've run across a few things that
answer recent threads on r.c.b and in HBD


All are quoted without permission.


Steam Sterilization: (p.49)
"Steam is also use for sterilisation but can only be fully effective if
it is saturated and operates in hot equipment.  There must be ample
oppotunity for the condensate to escape as the equipment heats up.
At least 30 min steam treatment at 1 bar over pressure after the equipment
has heated to 100C is necessary to achieve sterilisation of a 
cleaned piece of equipment."


Wort Aeration: (p. 91)
"Aeration of wort is needed for yeast growth.  Specifically it is 
required in small amounts (5-15 mg/l) by the cells in order to 
synthesise unsaturafed fatty acids and sterols for intracellular
membranes...Air will provide a maximum of 8 mg/l dissolved oxygen.
Some strains of yeast however require more than this and oxygen is
substituted for air."


Yeast Size: (p. 96)
"A typical brewing yeast cell will, when fully grown, be between 8
and 14 um diameter and have a mass of about 40 pg when dry.  Thus,
10^12 dried cells will weigh 40 g."


Control of Infections: (P. 111)
in austenitic stainless steel vessels,
"The sequence is wash thoroughly by water, using high pressure
revolving jets or static spray balls in the vessels.  When the 
water has drained, hot caustic soda (usually with
some sodium hypochlorite) is used as a detergent-sanitizer.
The caustic soda kills microbes effectively and is an excellent
dissolver of protein.  It is not however suitable for dissolving
and keeping in suspension calcium salts, therefor additions
of various polyphosphates, metasilicates or guconates may be made.  
The hypochlorite is a source of free chlorine and therefore a strong 
bacteriocide; it also enhances the cleaning power of the
detergent.  Free chlorine is however a dangerous agent of corrosion
of stainless steel if the pH of the solution falls to neutrality or below."


Filtration: (Pg. 143-147)
Several filtration techniques are talked about.  Its too long to post.
Bottom line is that diatomaceous earth (kieselguhr) is the
most popular filter type.  This, in combination with a secondary
membrane filtration does a great job.  1.0 um membranes will be expected
to prevent yeasts from be penetrating, and a 0.2 um membrane would be
expected to hold back bacteria.

I am new to the art of homebrewing.  I have a couple of small
paperbacks on the subject, but would like to know if there
is one or two good sources for us novices?  I have yet to brew
my first batch, but I am getting anxious to start.  Any info
that you longtime brewers can impart to a beginner would be
greatly appreciated.


I just moved to Big Rapids, MI and don't know where I could get

Subject: crystal malt in muslin bag


In HBD 1099 Mike Rego asks about Cara-pils haze.  This prompts me to ask a
more general question regarding the addition of other malts to an
all-extract brew.  Up until now I've been putting these in a tighly-woven
hop bag, but am convinced that the bag is too small, packing all the grains in
much too closely and restricting the extraction I get.


I'm thinking of using a much larger bag made out of muslin, but am wondering
if the much coarser weave will allow undesirable things into the wort.  My
procedure is generally to steep the grains for 20 minutes or so at 170
degrees, then remove the bag prior to bringing the wort to the boil.


The grain crushing process (either a rolling pin for me, or sometimes I buy
it pre-crushed from my brew shop) produces powder along with broken grains.
How important is it to sift all this powder out?  If it gets into the wort
will it cause any problems?


My thoughts are that the muslin idea would work, because in full grain brewing
all this stuff is thrown in with no strainer bag, right?


Any comments/suggestions are most welcome.

Here are some answers (even to questions you didn't ask): the amber
color is not surprising, really.  You'll find that one company's "light"
is another's "amber" and that truly pale beers are tough to make from
extracts.  In part, this is because the evaporation process necessary to
create syrup from wort often is allowed to darken the product.  But the
German syrups are particularly dark, or they were several years ago when
I did an experiment for Zymurgy and compared a dozen brands of extract.


Carapils does not cause haze, although there seems to be an odd train of
thought out there to this effect.  On the other hand, regardless of what
Charlie Papazian says, you shouldn't be boiling your specialty grains.
Far better to get them out earlier, and even better to simply steep them
at about 150F for an hour or so, then rinse them and use the resulting
liquid along with your extract.  Carapils will give your beer more body
if it's properly used; I can't imagine what "not like other specialty
grains" means in this context, but it sounds as though someone was
giving it a bum rap.  Carapils also has the added benefit of enhancing
the "maltiness" of beer, which is why microbrewers often use it in
conjunction with American pale malt.


I'm a little confused about what you mean by "haze" in a fermenting
beer.  Was it hazy when it went into the carboy, and did it not clear at
all (with a large deposit of solids) within an hour or two.  After the
yeast takes off, of course, there's a whole new "haze" which is just two
or three ***illion yeast cells performing their mating and working
rituals.  If the beer never looked bright in the kettle (taking into
account all the stuff floating around in it -- take a spoonful out and
look to see if the liquid itself is clear when the hop particles etc
have a chance to settle), it's possible your boil is not vigorous
enough.


========================================
On another note, has anyone ever gotten results anything like Charlie's
from one of his recipes?  He seems to bat them out at a fairly high
rate, and I've wondered over the years how much time goes into
developing each one, and whether he's ever brewed one of them more than
once (or better yet, more than three times) before publishing them.
What really struck me was his recipe in the most recent Zymurgy, which
calls for (not having it in front of me, and whoops, here we go again
relying on memory) something in the neighborhood of 3.5# of dry malt
extract and about 3 pounds (maybe a little more) of specialty grains.
This to produce five gallons of a beer over 1.065.  Does anyone else
think this is unlikely?

Subject: pH meter questions


Nicks asks:


>1) can I just use distilled water to calibrate at ph7?




No.  Distilled water is NOT pH 7, it is acidic due to dissolved CO2.
You need to buy (or make) buffer solutions to accurately calibrate your meter.  
Your meter should also have some instructions about calibration.  Many of the 
meters have two-point calibrations where you adjust the pH reading at, say, pH 
4 and 9.  Since pH varies with temperature, you also need to make sure that you 
calibrate it at the temperature specified by the manufacturer (unless your 
model has auto-temperature correction).

Re: Temperature Controls


I would like some feedback on what people think of their temperature controls
for their refrigs/freezers.  Has anyone used the digital one from American
Brewmaster?  I like the idea of the digital ones, but I've only seen ones that
go down to 40 degrees.  I know Williams beverage sell one that goes down to
20 degrees but it does not have a digital display. 


Re: Refrig/Freezer


Any recommendations on refrigs/freezers that have worked well for people?  I
seem to think that a chest freezer would allow the best utilization of space
and it would allow the temperatures for lagering.  Also, what results have
people gotten lagering with just their refrigs (down to 40 degrees I believe)?

I use a technique I saw here on the HBD once and has worked well.  After 
cleaning, rinsing, and drying the bottles with your favorite method, take a
small square (~ 2"x2") of aluminum foil and seal up the bottle opening.  Then
bake the bottles (theoretically nothing lives over 60C, but I use just over
100C) for 15 minutes and let them slowly cool.  When you're ready to bottle,
just take the foil off.  I've done this up to 3 days before bottling and 
have never had an infection yet.

Subject: Rye Malt and the Extract Brewer


Hi folks,


I'm wanting to try my hand at making the Finnish beer Sahti.  I've
found the malted rye (a tricky thing) but have a question.  You see,
I'm still an extract brewer and am not ready to go all grain right
now.  So I was wondering how I handle the rye malt.  Should I
treat it like a speciality grain by steeping it in near boiling
water and then adding it to the regular malt?  Or will I need to
do a partial mash?  How would I go about this?


Thanks,


Julie

I think your problem was that you used only 3 tbs of DME.  Are you sure you 
gave the yeast enough to eat?


Chris Dukes asks about suggestions on what to do with bottles after they've 
been sterilized:


>Once the bottles are boiled, bleached, NaOH'ed, etc. . .where do you keep

>too long?


I suggest that you keep the bottles with the open end down to prevent stuff 
falling into them.  I can get about a case of 16 oz. bottles into a standard 
dish drainer.  That's a pain since a 5 gal. batch takes about a case and a 
half of bottles.  So, I picked up a drying rack.  It's a plastic tower that 
holds up to 45 bottles and is expandable in increments of 9.  I wipe it down 
with a bleach solution while my bottles are soaking, rinse the bottles with a 
bottle washer attached to a faucet, and then let the bottles drip dry on the 
rack.  It works great and doesn't take up much counterspace.  You might be 
able to make one out of wood, but I'm not sure you could keep it as clean as 
the plastic version.  I bought it at a local homebrew supply shop for around 
$25.


I've heard of other folks using the dishwasher set on rinse and dry, but 
that's not an option for me since I don't have a dishwasher or any room in the 
kitchen to put one.

Subject: Chili Pepper Beer


Greetings.


I usually put half a chili in each bottle before sealing the crown.


First slice the pepper lenghwise. 
Then remove the seeds (but not the inner white membrane)
Rinse
Put half (or two halves) chili in each bottle you want to "pepperize"
Seal crown


I have found that as soon as the beer is carbonated and conditioned it
is at it's best "pepperness."  The chili aroma and flavor seem to
mellow with age.  I cracked open a chili beer that had been sitting for
a couple of months, and the flavor was there, but it was very subdued.
So, maybe wait a couple of weeks if you want a beer that is at it's
greatest pepper potential for cinco de mayo.


I have tried putting chilis in with the boil, but the finished product
did not have any "pep," just a bit of peppery flavor.  Also, with the 
pepper in the bottle trick, you can make less than a batch of pepperized
brew.  Perhaps if you plan on crating more than one batch of beer to be
consumed by may 5, then pepperize some of each and do a side by side
by side by side comparison of all the pepperized/non pepperized beers.

Subject: Maltmill and Easymash source


A number of brewers suppliers (chandlers?) carry these things.  Last I
knew, you could also order them directly from:


Jack Schmidling Productions
4501 Moody
Chicago, IL 60630
+1 312 685 1878


You can also E-mail Jack for more info on current prices, retailers, etc.
He is a little reticent about posting commercials, but will probably reply
privately.


I use both these devices and am quite pleased with them.  You can build an
Easymash yourself--Jack posts directions from time to time.  If you want it
done right the first time, Jack doesn't charge that much over the cost of
parts for his kit, which has had some die work done on the air cock.


The Maltmill is another thing again.  It has custom castings, from recycled
aluminum cans!  I have no idea how Jack grooves the rollers, or where he
gets the stock.  It also is well-made and worth the investment.  I have the
non-adjustable version and have had no problems crushing various malts and
even raw rye.


I seem to recall that the Maltmill is about 120-125 dollars and the
Easymash is about 25 dollars.  If you order direct there is a small
shipping charge, but only one charge for both ordered together.


disclaimer--I have no interest in any of Jack's businesses.  I am just a
satisfied customer and amused observer.

I've not been incautious enough to make one, but I've judged several, and
the palatable ones all had a high residual maltiness which balanced the
pepper. So many of these are awful, but I tasted one which was actually
good - and the trick in the recipe was to use Wyeast 1338 yeast (European
Ale/Dusseldorf Altbier) which will naturally leave a high maltiness.
Gravity was in the normal range around 1.050.

I have done the bottle culturing bit from SNPA for quite some time without any
problems. The yeast is a washed version of what was used to ferment the beer.
It is added to filtered beer to provide for the bottle conditioning. If there
were faults with this yeast or the culturing method I would expect we'd hear
about lots of problems from lots of homebrewers. I'd also expect there would be
some evidence of such a problem in Sierra's products. I can't say I've ever had
a bad bottle of anything that Sierra Nevada produced.


As for the OG recommended for starters:


I believe George Fix did some research (or at least referred to somebody's
research) which indicated that the performance of yeast was best when begun in
a starter which was close to the OG of the batch to be pitched. This was
especially true for higher gravities. George?

Subject: local brewmaster on sparge time/mashing dark grains


I know Micah's no longer with us (gee, that sounds like he's dead--you know
what I mean:  He's no longer with the DIGEST), but before he left he made the
argument that dark grains should only be added at mash out, rather than for
the whole mash.  The subject came up at our homebrew meeting last night, and
Fred Lang, the brewmaster at our local micro, agreed with Micah.  He said to
put the dark grains in for just ten or twenty minutes at the end, while
mashing out.


Also, not too long ago, Joe Stone and I wondered about sparge times.  This
subject also came up at our meeting last night.  One guy said he aimed for 2
and a half to three hour sparges.  Another person said, "Gee, I just do it for
about twenty minutes."  Again, the question was put to Fred.  He said that the
length of time is really irrelevant, because it depends on your grain bed,
temps, and other things.  He maintained that you should use the gravity to
determine when to quit sparging.  In particular, do not go below 2 degrees
Plato, and in fact you should quit a little above that since it would be
better to throw out a little extract rather than get the tannins.  So what's 2
degrees Plato?  Like 1.008 maybe?.  Looks like those of you who stop at 1.010
have been talking to Fred...

  What was the SG of the starter?  I always use >= 1.040 starters, and 3Tbs
to 3/4 qt seems awfully thin to me.  I also pitch WYEAST packets into
300-500ml starters and then step up to 800-1000ml starters.  It seems that you
are using too large of a starter with too low a DME content.  Wioth any luck,
your yeast should still be viable, I might try  boiling up some really thick
wort, and adding it to you existing starter.

Subject: Bock recipe


Well, I was going to wait until after this beer won the Bock is Best
competition :-) to post this, but a friend asked for the recipe, so
I'll kill two birds with one stone.  Since this was the first batch in
my new mash/lauter tun, the procedure required some fine-tuning.  Thus
the multiple infusions, etc.  This may make it difficult to exactly
reproduce the recipe!


I made this on Dec 26, so it's


Boxing Day Bock


10# Belgian Pilsener Malt
3#  Belgian Munich Malt
        (above Corona crushed)
 .5# M&F Crystal malt
2 oz chocolate malt
        (above pre-crushed by roller mill at the HB shop)
4oz Hallertau plugs `at` 2.9%
2oz Saaz plugs `at` 3.1%
Wyeast Munich Lager yeast (2308)


Procedure:
Mix Pilsener & Munich malts in mash tun, infuse 10.5qts H2O`at`170F (mash
temp 137F -- oops!), infuse additional 3qt `at`boiling (mash temp to 145F
- -- sigh!), decoct 3qts (pretty thick) to boiling (mash temp to 156F --
finally!)  Meanwhile, steep crystal in 1qt H2O `at`165F.  Mash 1hour.
Infuse 3gal `at`boiling to 165F, add crystal & chocolate malts & stir.
15min rest.  Start sparge, recirculate 6 qts.  Sparge to 6.5gal
(ending sparge gravity 1.010`at`150F == 1.026??)  


Boil 1.5 hours.  Hop schedule
2 oz Hallertau `at` 30 min
1 oz each Hallertau & Saaz `at` 60 min
1 oz each `at` 75 min


Chill & rack.  Yield approx 4 gal `at` 1.066.


Pitch yeast from 1pt starter.  Move to cellar `at`58F.  After two days,
krauesen is evident, move to fridge `at`50F.
Primary time: 6 weeks
24 hour diacetyl rest at end.
Bottled at FG 1.022, lagered in bottle.


Comments:
It came out as a borderline "Helles Bock."  Probably should have left
out the chocolate malt.


This stuff is yummy.  Wonderful malt nose & flavor.  Nicely hopped.
Friends have said it's one of the best beers they have tasted.


I have to attribute much of its goodness to the ingredients: Belgian
malts and hops plugs.  This is the first time I've ever really smelt
the "spiciness" of Saaz hops.  I wonder whether the little decoction I
did to get the mash temperature up had some effect on the maltiness.

  I have no hard data, but my brewing has increased manyfold over this flu
season, to a point where I nearly never buy commercial beer anymore. (Less
than one case in 6 months).  For the first time in years, I have not gotten a
single cold through the flu season.  I attribute this to greater increase in
vitamin B intake.

 Judging from all the interest in getting that caramel flavor recently 
 displayed on the Digest, I presume that lots of people would not find that a 
 problem.  More importantly, Ken Pachivich at Bader Brau makes an issue of his 
 "fire brewed" process to achieve that caramel taste for his award winning

 1. It requires no hole in the kettle.

Subject: Beer and Cancer


Hello fellow brewers,  Now I could be wrong, but, while doing research for
a paper in my Biology of Cancer class here at UCLA, I found some articles
which described studies being done in Europe regarding the effects of beer
and alcohol in general on the risk of colorectal cancer.  What they seemed
to be saying was that spirits and wine did not increase the risk of colorectal
cancer, but they found that beer did.  Of course the risk was substantially
increased only in subjects who drank large amounts of beer regularly over
the course of a lifetime.  There was also a link to dark beers and smoked
foods, such as fish.
  I did not end up writing my paper on this topic, so I cannot give any
references, however, it would not take me long to look them up again if
anyone is interested.
  If anyone else can shed some light on the subject, feel free.


By the way,  I tried the new Pub Daught Guiness in the can for the first
last weekend and I loved it.  Just for fun I ripped open the can to check
out the doohickie on the bottom: pretty cool.  If you haven't tried it yet,
and you like Guiness, go out and get some.  It is amazing how it looks and
tastes like it came out of the tap.  My only gripe is that you have to
open it cold (otherwise you have beer all over the place: like homebrew).
I haven't seen it in too may stores though.  In southern california you can
get it at the Price Club (although it may be seasonal).  It sure made my
St. Patricks Day.


  Homebrewers do it sanitarily

I think that this may be your problem.  3 tbsp in 3/4 quart is an *very*
low gravity wort.  Even the 1020 wort that I use barely if ever shows
any kraeusen -- besides there being very little sugar for the yeast to
get excited about, the viscosity of the wort is so low that no "head"
forms.  You probably have a fine yeast starter, albeit a bit weaker than
it could have been.  If you want to continue to use the juice jar for
your starters, get a one-hole stopper to fit the top and put an airlock
in it.  The airlock will show you activity a lot more accurately than
watching the surface of the starter.

Ridiculous.  Perhaps all the yeast in the US is now dead thanks to this
low pressure storm system?  Find a reputable supplier.

The sludge is a combination of hop petals that made it through, hop resins,
dead and dormant yeast and probably a couple of other things.  Leave it
be.  The sludge is expected, but if you still think you want it in your
beer, taste it and decide for yourself.

I bought a bottle tree and a sanitizer thingamabob.  It mounts on the
top of the tree.  I pump bleach solution into the bottles (30 pumps)
and then set the bottles onto the tree.  When I've got two cases on
the tree, I rinse the first bottle, fill it, cap it and then go on to
the next bottle.  Perhaps you may want to sanitize all your bottles
(even if you leave them face up) and then rinse just before bottling.
This way, if anything falls in, the residual sanitizer will kill it.
