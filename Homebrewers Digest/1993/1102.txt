Sounds like you were a bit hasty.  The package should be more like 3"
in thickness before it's pitched into the starter.


I pitched this into 3/4 quart of wort I had

I think this is another case of overkill.  You should be able to
sterilize your starter by simply boiling the DME and water for 15
minutes in a pan on the stove.  Then force-cool it in the sink by
putting on a lid and running cold water around it.  This cooling takes a
matter of minutes.  Transfer into your sterilized jar, aerate and add
the yeast.  The problem, though, as I said above is that you didn't get
enough growth before you pitched into this volume.  Given time it may
well come up to sufficient yeast volume to use for brewing.  Bear in
mind, however, that you need roughly twice as much lager yeast for
pitching as you do ale yeast.




The next morning was when I pitched the

Some more overkill.  Put your starter somewhere warm and don't worry
about light.  If you've used hopped DME (which some people recommend),
there might be a concern about light struck smells, but yeast don't have
any objection to light that I've every observed.

Well, now that's a creative suggestion.  Ridiculous, maybe, but
creative.

Aha!  This is exactly the problem with any system but my own.  (Sorry. I
couldn't resist the "snob" approach.) (But it's true.)


If you take your clean bottles, and put little aluminum foil tops on
them and then put them in a cold oven, raise temp to 350 for 90 min.,
let them cool and put them back in the case, you will not have to worry
about nasties.  I have let bottles sit like this for days and then
bottled without problem, and could probably let them sit for weeks -- as
long as none of the kids stuck their fingers through the foil.  Another
advantage of the system is that you don't have to empty the dishwasher
first.

Subject: Miller Ale, Yeast Slurry Reuse




  I have several questions for the readers of the HDB.


   1. Has anyone heard of a "Bass type" ale that Miller Brewing Co.
      was going to market? A friend of mine was on a tasting panel
      about 1 year ago. He said they were going to call it, tentatively,
      Miller Ale, Copperhead Ale, or God knows what.


      Flame me if you want, but it is (remotely?) possible that this could be
      a decent beer. After all, Detroit is making good cars again. Maybe
      the American mega-brewers can get their act together too.




   2. A while back I read a post asking if the yeast slurry in the bottom
      of a fermenter can be used to make bread or any other food products
      for human consumption. Any suggestions? (My friend's dogs are currently
      the benefactor of his yeast slurry. They love it!)




   3. Is the infamous Jim Koch related to the brewers of Koch's Anniversary
      Beer (from the New York area)?

Subject: Yeast Lab, Hallertau in porters


Has anyone tried "Yeast` Lab" (tm) liquid yeast cultures?  They
just turned up at my local brewshop.  They're distributed by
G. W. Kent, so I imagine they are/soon will be readily available.


They come in litte 35 ml vials.  They cost the same as Wyeast.
The selection is similar.  They have most of the Wyeast strains,
and a couple that Wyeast don't seem to have.  There are 8 ales:
Autralian, American, London, British, Irish, Dussledorf, Canadian,
Trappist.  5 lagers: Pilsner, Bavarian, Munich, St. Louis, California.
There's a Bavarian and Weizen and two mead yeasts: dry and sweet.
I guess Autralian and Canadian ales and the two mead yeasts are
the only varieties not availbale from Wyeast.  I'm looking forward
to trying the mead yeasts.

Thanks to all who replied on the subject of Hallertauer in porters.
In particular, thanks to Jeff, Russ, Nick, Kieth, Jim and Walt.
The use of Hallertauer, Mt. Hood or Tettnanger as a finishing
hop or dry hop for porter seems quite popular.  I had originally
been planning to do the same, but then I got thinking about using
them (Hal. and Mt. Hood in this case) for bittering and flavor as
well.  Only Kieth MacNeal seems to have tried this.  He bittered
with Hallertauer and Tettnanger in a porter that was also flavored
with ginger and juniper.  Wish I could try some!!


So I think I'm going to go for it:  I plan to follow the recipe
"Foster's Entire Butt" in Foster's _Porter_, except that I'll
use Hallertauer and Mt. Hood (possibly a touch of NB as well)
for all hop additions, and tone down the chocolate malt a
little.  The hope is to get something like a Bavarian dark beer
in hops and color, but with the ale characteristic of a porter.
Wyeast London, in case you were wondering.


Cheers,

Subject: More AoB Bashing




Back on 8 February, I ordered some books from the AoB.  Among them
was The Practical Brewer.


When the package arrived a few days later, Practical Brewer was
not in it and was, according to the invoice, backordered.  Of course
I was charged for it anyway. When I called (the day the package arrived), 
I was told the book was out of stock and would be in around the first of 
March.  I said, OK, but I'm not too happy that you have invoiced me
for something you aren't going to ship for another three weeks.
(No response.)


Mind you, I wasn't told about the backorder when I phoned my order
in. :-||


So weeks and weeks roll by.  No Practical Brewer.


I called again today.  This time I was told "the book isn't back from
the printer yet ... it's a new printing."  I can now, they say, expect
the book to ship around the first of April.


None of this would bother me if AoB, which purports to run a high-class
mailorder operation, would do the usual high-class thing and INVOICE
ONLY FOR ITEMS SHIPPED.  I could wait for months (not that I would
like to) if they weren't holding onto my money.  As it is, though, 
I am getting more and more pissed about this, as well as silliness 
like "15% off" a $10 book...I mean, the mailing probably cost half
of that discount per member!


I plan to send a written complaint shortly, and encourage any of the
rest of you who have had trouble with the mailorder service, or other
aspects of the AHA/AoB/etc. to do the same with your gripes.


Help stamp out poor service in OUR organization.

Subject: pH meters


Nick says:
)         I finally broke down and bought a ph meter.[The
)         hanna unit that American brewer sells if it matters]
)         I now have three questions:


I have one of these.  It works reasonably well for something
so inexpensive.


)         1) can I just use distilled water to calibrate at
)         ph7?


No, positively not.  You must use a buffer solution of some sort.
I recommend getting a pH 7 buffer and another buffer around 5.5.
The CRC Handbook has a table that tells you how to make up buffers
of any pH your heart desires.  I have 4, 5.5 and 7 in my cabinet.
You can also find premixed buffers (generally expensive) and buffer
capsules that you mix with some quantity of distilled water.


Distilled water has no buffering capacity.  Even a tiny bit of some
acidic or alkaline material in distilled water will change its pH
significantly--including contaminants that might be present on the
pH meter.  Typically, a probe rinsed in tap water will read well above
7 when placed in distilled water--because of the alkalinity of the
tap water.


)         2) can I expect this thing to be reasonably
)         calibrated just out of the box? Or should I just
)         check to make sure?


Don't trust it.  No way.  It could be +/- .5 units, or more.


)         3) Finally is there anything I should look out for?


Cool the samples to <100F before making your measurements.  Ideally
to <80F.  This isn't for the probe's sake, but for the sake of
accuracy.  The pH changes with temperature.

Is there any reason for not using DME only in an extract brew? Is there
something in the liquid malt extract that DME has not? As my only source of
extract (till I turn grain...) is from abroad I figured DME would give me more
extract per kilo (which counts if you have to use over-seas air-mail).

I just brewed a batch of his "Bruce and Kay's Black Honey Spruce Lager"
last month.  Fortunately, the owner of my local brewing supplying shop
warned me that he had tried to make this several times and recommended
that I use only a quarter of the spruce essence that Charlie Papazian
states in his recipe.  The result was a spruce lager with just the right
amount of "spruce-iness" to it.  If the store proprietor hadn't warned
me I would have ended up with two cases of Pine Sol instead.

In "Belgian Ale"  Rajotte writes:


"Candi sugar is made by the slow crystallization of a highly
concentrated hot sugar solution.  The sugar solution is cooled in a tank
in which cotton strings are hung.  The crystals form themselves around
the strings.  The slower the cooling, the larger the crystals become."


questions:


1.  How concentrated is "highly concentrated"?
2.  Rajotte says that the taste profile of candi sugar is different from
sugar                                    "out of the bag."  In what way? 
3.  This sounds a lot old fashioned "rock candy."  Will the results be
the same if I try this at home on a micro scale?

Subject: Dark grains at mashout, Freezer


In hbd 1101 Frank Tutzaner referred to references by a local brewmaster
and Micah that dark grains should be added at mashout.  Forgive me for 
being a purist, but wasn't the original reason for dark grains, and hence
dark beers, pH reduction prior to a good understanding of such matters?
Adding dark grains later may add color and sugars, but apart from a 
slight extra asstringency, what is the problem with conventional maching
getting the benefit of pH reduction?  Adding grains late in the mash is
a step towards Michelob Dark.


I just purchased a 1950's Jeffrey Dahmer ( ;-) ) chest freezer by
International Harvester!  They certainly don't make them like they used to.
IH may have used the same sheet metal for this that they used for trucks.
It has features I have never seen before like a battery powered alarm if the
temperature rises and a thermometer in the door - unfortunately it says warm
to cold, rather than temperature.  This huge heavy beast was moved relatively
smoothly and is now in my basement and I do not feel like dragging it
back up the stairs!  Anyway, now that I have my summer lager I will be
very interested in answers to Glenn Raudin's questions in hbd 1101.
But I have a few more which refer to lagering.  I can probably fit
4 or 5 carboys in the freezer and so can now do long lagering, but
what do I do when adding a new beer to the lager?  Obviosly It would be
bad to adjust the temperature upwards from 40 or lower to step down
a new addition.  I have another small refrigerator that can take a 5 gallon
carboy that I use now, and could continue to use for step downs or 32
lagering for those extra special beers.  Also, how do people do
summer primary fermentations? I wouldn't want to raise the temperature in
the freezer even to 48, and because my 7 gallon carboys will not fit in the
refrigerator, will I be forced to use a blow off tube and 5 gallon carboys?
Any suggestions?

I guess I have a hard time with measurements like that.  For a starter, you 
want 1.020 wort, which roughly translates into 1 oz. for each pint.  So for 
1.5 pints you want about 1.5 oz.


3 "heaping" tablespoons might easily be *more* than 1.5 oz.  Sometimes I 
get more than 1 oz. out of one heaping tablespoon (I weigh for starters).
OTOH, 3 "level" tablespoons might easily be *less* than 1 oz.


So, he either put in more DME than needed or less than recommended.


*I* don't know.

Has anyone tried using oat bran in an oatmeal stout?  As a brewer in the
extract/partial mash school, I question the logic of using large quantities
of flaked oats as a specialty grain, especially when the starch will
obviously not be converted.  I would expect the gums and glucans to be
concentrated in the bran of the oat -- so why not use just the bran fraction
and save the rolled oats for breakfast?


I suppose that I'm assuming here that the major contribution of oats to a
stout is the fullness and body provided by the gums.


Can anyone comment on this assumption?
Has anyone tried brewing with oat bran, and with what results?

 No!  distilled water is not always at a pH of 7, in fact water will hardly 
ever have a pH of 7.  Disolved gases will cause the pH to vary.  Disolved 
carbon dioxide will cause the pH to be around 5.6.


 Also I would not trust the calibration on the new intrument.  It probably 
is not calibrated at all and the calibration does change with time.  Use a

I use both the temperature controler that William's sells and a Hunter "Air
Stat" for different refrigs.  The one thet William's sells (~$50) is a very
good quality industrial grade unit made by "PENN controls"  if I remember
right.  It is true that it doesn't have a digital display, but who needs
one?  It would look cool and impress all of your friends, but not really
necessary.  The Hunter Air Stat I bought a Home Depot for $19.  It does
have a digital display for the coolness effect, but has a couple of
disadvantages.  One is that the user interface was designed for programming
room air conditioners to save energy.  It is hard to use to just adjust the
temp setting and keep it there.  The other disadvantage id that it only
goes down to 40 or 45 deg F.  This is not cold enough for lagering.  Its
best advantage is price.


As far as refrigs go, I agree that the chest type would be best, althouth I
have not run accros one for the right price yet.   Most refrigs should not
have a lot of trouble getting down to 32 deg F for lagering.  I know that
none of my three do.

I was under the understanding that the process for malting crystal sort of
accomplished a pseudo mash.  I have never heard how Dextrine/cara-pils is
made.  What I do know is that William' Brewing (Bill Moore's company) sells
Dextrine/cara-pils as something that needs to be mashed, and also sells L10
light crystal as a non-masher substitute for this.  I have used both, but
with otherwise identical brews, so I have no comparison between the two. 


Does anybody know how Dextrine/cara-pils is malted?  What are the other
opinions and experiences with not mashing it?

plastic that I got out of the scrap pile at the local plastics store.  It
basically looks like a box, about 18"X30"X5" with 60 holes (1.25" I think)
drilled in the top. It holds 60 bottles upside down so nothing falls in
them, and no part of it goes into the bottle.  It sits on the counter top
when in use, an is easily stored when not.  It can also be moved around
with the bottles in it, if one is careful. It is constructed by glewing
some 1/4" plastic sheets together, then drilling holes with a hole saw.  I
don't ASCII graphics are necessary here, unless sombody really wants them.

I suggest using a bigger (I think it's polyester) grain bag.  I think your
process is fine (for extract beers, I suspend the grain bag in cold water
and pull it out when it reaches 170F).  Most of the powder when you crush
crystal malt (AND THIS IS IMPORTANT) is the crystalized sugar.  Taste it.
It's sweet.  The first time I used crystal malt, I shook the grain bag
till the brown powder stopped coming out.  I then thought about it (I
had more than an hour to think, you see) and realized that the powder
was probably crystalized sugars.  Sure enough, when I tasted it, it was
sweet.  Now, if you are pulverizing your grain husks, then part of the
powder will be husk, but the solution is crushing your malt better and
not using a more fine bag.  Fix the source of the problem, don't put
a bandaid(tm) on a symptom.

The problem with having the spacing too close is that the hop
plants send runners underground and when they come up, you dont know
which plant they came from.  I planted mine 6 feet apart and put
3-foot diameter, rabbit fencing cages around them.  This was to keep
the rabbits and the pesky deer away from the young shoots.  Any
shoots that come up outside any of the cages, I chop them off with
a vertical chop with a spade.  This way, the shoots get cut off at
the source, just outside the cage, so they wouldn't eventually creep
into the next cage.  The fear, in case it's not obvious, is to
know what variety you are picking, so you don't dump Chinooks in
when you are expecting Saaz.  My standard "give each plant 6 gallons
of water and as much sun as you can" should also be mentioned.

This is dependent on your brewing water.  In Munich, the dominant style used
to be a Dunkel, made with dark grains.  This was because the dark grains
would acidify the Munich water and dark lagers just came out better than
paler ones.  If your water is soft, then you may indeed want to only
add the dark grains in during mashout.

Controlled caramelization is quite hard to acheive, especially for us
homebrewers.  Commercial brewers are better equiped to control the
amount of caramelization that occurs.  Baderbrau is somewhere between
dark blonde and light amber in color, so the caramelization is not very
severe.  Obviously, Ken has good control over the amount that occurs.
For us to add repeatable caramel flavors in our beers, I'd say that
crystal malts are our best bet.


With all due respect to you, Jack, and at the risk of bringing an abrupt
end to the pleasant demeanor (and humor) you've recently displayed in
HBD, I'd like to dispute Ken Pavichevich's claims that Baderbrau is a
Pilsener.


We've disagreed on this before and no matter what Ken says or the people
who have deemed Baderbrau an award-winning Pilsener say, I contend that
it's not a Pilsener.  It is too malty in both nose and flavor, slightly
fruity and a tiny bit dark to be classified as a pilsener.  The caramelly
flavor that you say that Ken brags about is out of place in a Pilsener.
Pilseners are supposed to be sharply refreshing, their balance should
be decidedly towards hops in both flavor and aroma and have a spicy hop nose
(PU uses Saaz).  I'd say Baderbrau is a great Munich Helles (albeit at the
dark end of the style).  I feel it's a great beer, just not a Pilsener.
