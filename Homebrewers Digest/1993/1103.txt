I have had trouble posting (I am not even sure if this will make it, but ...)
but this is what I said at the time:


Well, now that you bring it up, let me ask you a couple of questions,
I just made a couple of batches of cider.  They turned out *very* dry,
which is cool, cause that's the way I wanted them.  However, they are
a little too dry.  I think one of my mistakes was using champagne yeast
(duh!).  But other than that, I have a conceptual problem.  Let's say
I use ale yeast next time, how do I get a *slightly* (and I do mean
very slightly) sweet AND carbonated cider.  Seems like if there is any
residual sugar in there, the yeast will eat it.  So you always get a
more carbonated, dry beverage.  I know I can add lactose (which
yeast cannot ferment) but that just seems so....."high tech".  Any
thing more "natural"?


By the way, my second batch I used apple juice concentrate to boost the
O.G.  Don't know if it will work any better, but intuitively one might
think it would contribute more 'apple' flavor.  We'll see.


As for your question, you quote an O.G. of 1.054.  Did this take into
account the sugar water you added?  If not, what was the gravity and
volume (or weight) of sugar water that you did add?  Doing a simple-
minded calculation on the figures you give, you (may) have an alcohol
concentration of a little over 8% by volume.  This is nearing the tolerance
of most ale yeast, although I was reading a chart at a homebrew store the
other day that seemed to say that some ale yeast could go up to 12%.


So I guess an answer to your question would depend on how much extra
sugar you treated your yeast to.  Although it probably wouldn't hurt
to bottle now.  However-- with a whole two batches of cider under my belt
(and the second still in secondary) my advice is probably worth just what
you paid for it.  :-)

I probably wasn't too clear on this.  The "stem" and arms all lie on the
bottom of the pot/cooler, slots face down; then the standpipe comes up
the side of the vessel.  Here's a side view:

I wish I could say the standpipe idea is mine, but I stole it from
someone else, really.  You know what they say... "good artists borrow;
great artists steal."

Subject: BOTTLE DRYER


I have seen the plastic bottle drying towers sold in homebrew stores, but
I like the one that I built better.


It consists of 2 sheets of 1/2 inch plywood, 15" x 24" separated
by six 1 inch dowels, each about 5" long.  The top plywood sheet has
a 4x6 grid of 2-1/2 inch holes cut into it with a hole saw.  The
bottom sheet is solid plywood.  Below is a side view with a couple of
bottles sitting in the holes.  This bottle dryer holds 24 bottles, but
varying the size of the plywood and holes will change the capacity.
You can customize the dimensions to fit your size of bottles.  All the
wood pieces were painted with several coats of polyurethane prior to
assembly to make the entire structure fairly impervious to water damage.
As the bottles drain, I prop up one end of the dryer to let any
accumulated water run off the bottom sheet of plywood.


I only use 16 oz. Grolsch bottles for my brewing and this handles them
nicely even with the ceramic stoppers attached.  This drying rack will
let the bottles drip-dry upside down and not let any "nasties" fall
inside them.  It also does not touch the inside of the bottle so there
is no need to sterilize the dryer.


After I wash and dry a case of bottles, I just loosely clamp the ceramic
stopper in the mouth of the Grolsch bottle to keep out any dust.  I store
the rubber gaskets separately.  When it is time to bottle, I soak a case
at a time with a bleach solution, rinse thoroughly and let them drip-dry
for a few minutes.  The (boiled) gaskets then go on the ceramic stoppers
and are lightly closed until each bottle is ready to be filled.

Subject: Recipe: SN Porter Clone




Here is a recipe for a clone of Sierra Nevada Porter.  I didn't mean for
it to come out that way; in fact, I had never tasted SNP until after I
made this one (my 4th all-grain batch).


It is based on Dave Miller's traditional porter recipe:


SIERRA NEVADA PORTER CLONE (5 gal batch):


 7 lb     2-row pale malt
12 oz     Black patent malt
 6 oz     Barley flakes
 .5 tsp    gypsum


Hops:   2 oz  Cascades loose hops, 5.5% aa, 60 min boil (= 11 AAU)
      0.5 oz  English Fuggles plug hops, last 5 min of boil


Yeast:  Sierra Nevada Yeast, cultured from two bottles (actually it
        was the yeast cake from a previous batch)


PROCEDURE:


Mash in:       130 deg. F  9 qts water (San Diego tap water)
Protein rest:  125 deg F       30 min
Mash temp:     154-142 deg F  1.5 hr
Mash out:      168 deg F        5 min
Sparge:        approx 4-5 gal `at` 170 deg F


Total boil time of 1.25 hr, hops additions as noted above, chilled.
Fermented in glass, temp in the low 60's Farenheit, blow-off used.


OG: 50  FG: 17 (but could have gone lower--overcarbonated in bottles)
Total cost: $1.20 /six pack (not including yeast)

P.S. In an upcoming issue I'll post a recipe for an ale which tastes
     suspiciously like Bigfoot Ale, but with slightly lower O.G.

Subject: Pub Draught Guinness


I must say that I am surprised at all the enthusiasm for canned Guinness.
When I tried it (a 4-pack, shortly after it was introduced) I was totally
unimpressed.  But, moreover, at a recent CAMRA Ottawa Homebrew Competition,
they slipped Pub Draught Guinness into the stout category as a "ringer"
in a totally blind tasting, and the judges rated it 12th out of 14
supposedly homebrewed stouts!!


The judge's comments, even before the identities of the brews were
announced were (paraphrased): Beautiful head, wonderful nose, no flavour
at all.  Where's the beef?


Everyone was very amused when this brew was identified as Pub Draught
Guinness!!!


Cheers, P.

Subject: Are Zymurgy special issues worth it?


After more than seven years as a homebrewer, i've finally broken
down and joined the AHA.  The jury is still out on the question
of whether it was a wise investment of $25.


To the point: all of the special issues of Zymurgy from past years
can be back ordered, and I'm interested in opinions as to which
(if any) are worthwhile for an old dog who's always willing to
learn new tricks.


The issues in question:


1985 All-grain                  1986  Malt Extract   1987  Troubleshooting
1988 Brewers and their Gadgets  1989  Yeast          1990  Hops and Beer
1991 Beer Styles                1992  Gadgets and Equipment


1986 costs $5 and 1992 costs $9.5.  The others cost $8.5 and are
available as a set for a discount.  For the discount to be worth
it, one would have to want all 6.


Perhaps replies should be limited to e-mail, but I can't help
thinking there are a lot of other HBDers who would be interested
in the opinions of those who've read these issues.  In particular,
sis you learn a lot?  Do you still refer to them years later?


Thanks,

Subject: Drs. Balling and Plato


I have two questions about Balling/Plato:


1)  Exactly what is the difference between them?  Foster (_Pale_Ale_,
_Porter_) says Plato is "a more accurate, revised version of Balling"
He also says Balling is calibrated for 17.5C whereas Plato is calibrated
for 20C.  I presume the `more accurate revision' is something more
than just a temperature adjustment.  Was it simply a matter of Dr.
Plato (great name!) taking more accurate readings?


   It is interesting to note that both triple-scale hydrometers
   I have owned in my life have had Balling scales, the older,
   less accurate one .  On the other hand, most books (Eckhardt,
   Foster, Jackson) use Plato, the more accurate one.  What gives?
   Will some entrpreneur out there in HBD-land take up the
   challenge and produce a Balling/SG hydrometer for us?


2)  I understand that the conversion of a degree Plato to 4
points of SG (as in OG 1050 (12.5P)) is only an approximation.
A quick look at the Balling scale on my hydrometer shows that
SG ~= 4 x Balling - (1 or 2) in the range of 1030-1060.
However SG 1080 = 20 Balling and SG ~= 4 x Balling + (1 or 2)
for SGs around 1100.  Do I gather that the 1:4 approximation is
better when using Plato:SG?


Cheers,

From: G.A.Cooper`at`qmw.ac.uk (Geoff Cooper)
Subject: OG for starters - a question


Over the time that I have been reading HBD, there have been many articles
which have talked about the best gravity of wort to use in a starter. The
received wisdom from most postings is that an OG of 1.020 it best, but 
recent postings have expressed different views.


I recently mentioned the figure of 1.020 to a (knowledgeable) colleague and
then realised that I had no hard evidence to support any claims - just HBD
hearsay (which I have no doubt is well founded :-) )


So what is the best OG for a starter? Is the value different for culturing
up from a small amount (say from a slant), from that for growing an existing
large colony (say from a packet of dried yeast)? Or, assuming that one might
culture from 10ml to 100ml and then to 1lt, should one use the same OG medium
for the 2 stages, or might it be better if they were different?


I look forward to your views, but would also appreciate recieving a reference
or two that I could follow up - or the results of some experiments that you
have carried out.


If I get a lot of info I shall gladly summarise it.

Subject: Secondary?


        Three days ago I made a Trappist ale and used a cultured Chimay for
yeast.  It began fermenting that night and fermented vigorously for the next
two days.
        Now it has slowed way down and the S.P. is within 2 points of that
specified in the receipe.
        Is it time to go to the secondary even though it has only been three
days?  The receipe called for three weeks in the primary and one week in the
secondary.(Cats Meow Ed2 pg. 9-18)

Memory can be a dangerous thing......:-)


I looked at the most recent Papazian recipe for a weizenbock.  Actually the 
grain bill is *6* lbs of malted grain (most of it is enzymatic) and 3.5 lb of 
dry malt.  For a five gallon batch Charlie suggests an OG of ~1.064, which may 
be a little high, though it is reasonable if your sparging efficiency is good 
and you are able to get ~30 points/lb/gallon.

I have just bought a package of Liquid Wyeast.  I'd like to get the most
out of this purchase (ie., I'd like to stretch the use of this package
for successive batches of brew.)


I have read the Zymurgy "Yeast & Beer" Special Issue on yeast stock maintenance
and starter culture production.  This maintenance/production is certainly an
involving process when one considers the master culture preparation, working
the culture, and the plethora of equipment needed.


Upon reviewing the HBD, the following was posted by R.Cavasin for the
stretching of Wyeasts.  As stated, it's simple, and requires no special

Am I missing something?
What are the advantages/disadvantages of the above method when compared

Subject: big brewers brewing ales?


Joe Mulligan recalls a friend of his being on a tasting panel for
a "bass-like" product from Miller Brewing.  I recently saw a news
blurb announcing Miller Special Reserve Amber Ale, and its description
fits Joe's.  Miller appears to be using the Special Reserve name
for specialty or super-premium beers, as it has already brought to 
market Miller Special Reserve 100% Barley Beer, a blond, all-malt
beer.  I have not tasted the Amber Ale, and am wondering:  is it
amber?  is it an ale?  is it hopped above the taste threshold?
In launching the beer, Miller could be responding to Bass and
Sam Adams.  A spokesperson for Miller said that they believe there
is money to be made selling ales, although it is a relatively small
market for them and would account for 1% of their sales.  It also
appears that Heileman's, or someone contracting with them at La Crosse,
is brewing Windy City Ale, and Pabst, or someone contracting with
them, is brewing Old Tankard.

Yes, for *sterilization*.  *Sanitization*, which is sufficient for most of
homebrewing, is much less rigorous, and more easily achieved.  Steam and
boiling water seem to be very good sanitizers.


For anyone interested, I found both Turbinado sugar and Sucanat at the
Granite State Natural Foods store in Concord, NH.  The Sucanat was about
$2.75(!)/lb., the Turbinado was $1.35/lb.  GSNF also has a decent selection

As a datapoint, an award-winning porter I made (the one using Hallertau
hops) did not have any roasted grains added until mash-out, and it
definitely was not anything like Michelob Dark!  10-15 minutes at
typical mash-out temp of 170F or so imparts plenty of color and nice
roasty character.  (The water here in Fort Collins tends to be fairly
soft.)

You don't need to use anything other than the manifold; just dump the
grain right on top of it.  Just make sure you have the slots facing down
against the bottom of the vessel.

I don't see why not.  The only difference is that you'll get a slower
rate of drainage.  This may even be an advantage, since with 1/2"
tubing you have to restrict the flow anyway.


> Is there any problem using  PVC pipe and connectors instead of

Again, I don't see any reason not to.  The only thing you might want
to check is the acid resistance of the PVC, since your wort will be
somewhat more acidic than plain water.

Subject: Flaked barley question


This past friday I brewed a stout, which marked the first time I had ever 
used flaked barley in a beer. It was an all grain recipe, and the mash went
well, but the sparge was terribly slow - by far the slowest I've ever had.
Now according to Papazian and Miller, this is caused by some kind of
stuff that's in the flaked barley (beta glucans? who can remember all these
names for things in beer, anyway). Miller sais that the way to deal with 
this is with lager malt and a protein rest (the lager malt has more enzymes
of the needed kind for protein breakdown). Papazian mentions the problem,
offers no solution, and does no protein rest for his all-grain stout recipe,
which does include flaked barley. A quick perusal of the stout/porter
section of the Cat's Meow reveals about a 50/50 split of protein rest/
no protein rest of people who use flaked barley in all-grain brews.


So what do I do to make it all run smoother next time? Nothing - and live with
it? Do a protien rest? With or without lager malt?


Any comments are appreciated.

    I've got three feet of 3/8" copper in a 5 gallon cylindrical
Gott cooler and it seems to work just fine.  I removed the push
button tap and replaced it with a drum tap.  There is a stopper
at the inside of the drum tap and the copper comes out of it and
goes straight across the diameter of the cooler and then circles
around the circumference.  I've got slots every half inch or so,
which is probably overkill.


I would try and get uniform coverage so if you are using a larger
rectangular cooler you would need more copper.  You might also
want to go with a branching manifold with a rectangular cooler to
get more uniform drainage.

A grain bag probably wouldn't hurt but I haven't found it to be
necessary.

I would say that if you can use it for drinking water at sparge
temperatures then it should be safe for this purpose.  The only
caveat on using normal food preparation materials in brewing seems
to be related to how they perform in an alkaline environment.

        I just made a PVC slotted drain manifold for about $10 that works 
beautifully.  On advantage with PVC is that the lengths of pipe and the 
connectors fit snugly, forming an airtight seal, without gluing.  Thus one 
can disassemble the whole thing and clean it out after use.  Also, by 
removing the washer from inside the 3/4"threaded-1/2"smooth adapter, I was 
able to use it in place of the nut on my spigot.  Thus it easily adapted to 
my already existing system, making my bucket-full-of-holes obsolete.  (Now 
I use the former "zapap" inner bucket to carry my brewing supplies up and 
down the stairs).  The PVC resists the heat of sparging without any 
problem.  The only difficulty was getting the glue from the price tags off 
the connectors :)
        My manifold is an almost complete square with a diagonal leading up 
to the spigot (the spigot was just too high to connect directly, but too 
low for an elbow and a Tee), with projections from the one side into the 
middle.  Slots are facing down.  With this setup the sparge cleared after 
about 2 Litres of recirc., and all but about 1 cup of liquid was drawn off.

A note in the HBD indicated a brewer who had difficulty getting his

The recently turned pro, Micah Millspaw, once spoke about his method of adding
the strike water to his grains by underletting (feeding the liquid into the
bottom of the grain bed.


I tried this over the past weekend. I have a slotted copper manifold in the
bottom of a 48 quart cooler. I just ran the strike water in thru the manifold
and let it fill the cooler where the grain was already in place. This was for a
10 gallon batch so there was 21 lbs of grain and the water used was 1qt/lb.


I cannot report that I was required to do less mixing. Micah felt that the
method provided for less dry spots in the grain bed. I stirred for my normal 10
minutes before I was satisfied that the grain was completely wet. The
temperature of the grain bed did seem to be more uniform and my target
temperature was accurate so the transfer of temperature is the same as my
regular method.


The greatest advantage to this method was the reduction in grain dust and the
ease of combining the two materials. I normally pour the grain in with one arm
and stir with the other as the water pours in from my hot liquor tank. By
underletting I was able to have more control over pouring the dry grain into
the empty cooler and then just opened the valve from the hot tank and added the
strike water. All but the top inch of grain was wet prior to my stirring. I
expected the grain to float more than it did.


I like it!

Hop nose is achieved by boiling pellet hops for two min. and
loose hops for 5 min.


Dry-hopping seems to contribute mostly to palate flavor.


The best way to achieve maximum hop nose would be to utilize a
"hop cage". Run hot wort through these hops on the way to
a counterflow chiller. This would be "distillation" of the volatile hop
compounds.

         One thing I have seen (in a different context, but fairly valid
    anyway) is to keep the freezer as cold as you want the coldest of your
    beers to be, and heat the carboys to the temperature you want. You can
    get flexible heating elements that could be wrapped around a carboy,
    and these in conjunction with a thermostat and strategically-placed
    temperature probe, could keep a carboy of beer at whatever temperature
    you desired.


         The only thing I can see wrong with this is that it is apt to be
    expensive.
