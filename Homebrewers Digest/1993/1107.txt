Has anyone out there tried putting milk, white or dark bitter/sweet chocolate 
into the brewpot?  I need to know how much is needed, and what tastes were
contributed to a 5 gallon batch of conventional stout or ale.  Any reasons 
why this should not be attempted?

Subject: Northeast Brewers' Supply


James Dipalma reports some rather unpleasant experiences with NBS, which
I have no reason to doubt.  On the other hand, I can report that they
have always gotten my orders right, shipped promptly, and charge less for
their goods than any full-service dealer I'm aware of.  (Hey Al, when's
your catalog coming out?)
        In fact, NBS is the ONLY supplier I've used that HASN'T screwed 
up.  I don't think this suggests that they're perfect, but rather that 
much of this is a matter of fate.  The fact that they're trying to shave
markups to the bone also suggests to me that they're walking a finer line
than some suppliers in terms of the resources needed to supply a certain
level of service.
        I, too, have a minor quibble with their computers.  As some may
have noticed, they charge less for 15 lbs of grain on a per lb basis than
for 5 lbs.  Ok, that's fair.  As it turns out, a 15 lb order arrives in
5 lb bags.  Quirky, but ok if that's how they want it.  However, if you
want to buy 20 lbs you have to pay a 15 lb price and a 5 lb price.  I assume
that their computer system is not set up to handle the prices on the basis
of total quantity rather than units, but this was a bit irritating.
        Finally, my mom says that when she called them before Christmas
to order a Corona for me, she also asked if they could supply me with a 
basement (my chief brewing need).  They said no, so I guess they're not
FULL service!  
        Standard disclaimers apply.

Jim Busch (busch`at`daacdev1.stx.com) asks:


        >What is Dark German?


Well, its like this.  I *believe* "Dark German" is a toastier version of 
CaraVienne.  I'm actually not sure what distinguishes it from CaraMunich.


I should have said this the other day:  my local homebrew supplier (Roy 
Rudebusch `at` IMO in St. Louis) suggested the combination of the three "German" 
malts instead of the combination of dark and light English crystal malts that I 
wanted to use in this batch.  Roy knew what I was after, and  it worked out 
quite well.  My original recipe was formulated with two pounds light English 
crystal and one pound dark English crystal. Since that isn't what I actually 
brewed, I didn't post that as "The Recipe". I couldn't tell you what difference 
this actually makes in the final product.  I've noticed that Roy likes to use 
smaller amounts several "specialty" malts in combination, rather than larger 
amounts of fewer varieties.  Maybe Roy or other expierenced all-grain brewers 
will be inclined to comment on this style of recipe formulation.  Can you win a 
competition this way?  Would you really want to? 8-)       


What I know about recipe formulation, I learned from Dave Miller (by way of 
books), and Roy.  Roy taught me the practical application.  A good homebrew 
supplier, who actually brews good beer himself, is a fine thing to have in your 
neighborhood 8-).

All organizers are encouraged to post competition announcements and
requests for beer judges to JudgeNet <judge`at`synchro.com>. 


Most judges charge $50 per beer judged.  I, however, am a bargain.  I'll
judge for free if you'll cover my expenses and introduce me to a
beautiful single adult female biped who owns a brewery or racing team
and has bad taste in men. 


Seriously, BJCP judges cannot be paid to judge AHA or HWBTA sanctioned
competitions.  However, a free lunch is considered appropriate, and many
competitions offer 'Beds for Brewers' where visiting judges stay at
local brewer's homes. 


Contact the AHA (phone & address in Zymurgy) for a list of judges and
details about becoming a sanctioned competition. 


Having a sanctioned competition gets you some advantages:


 - BJCP Judges get experience points.
 - Competitors may consider it more legitimate (this is debatable).
 - Announcement in Zymurgy (if they feel like it).

Without being able to taste the beer, it's difficult to speak with too
much authority, but...  The odds are that there was a contamination
problem _after_ you transferred the beer in Batch 1 to the secondary --
or rather, during the transfer.  Batch Two was brewed with the clean
yeast from the primary, but Batch Three was fermented with contaminated
yeast.  Sanitize the bejezzus out of all the plastic that the beer would
be coming in contact with.  Also, check your carboys for scratches; it's
possible that there are bacteria lurking in there.  I had a recurring
unpleasant aroma (maybe the same one) that I could trace through several
batches...the common problem seemed to be equipment used in transfer.  I
tossed out _everything_ made of plastic and retired a suspicious carboy.

Those two suggestions go hand in hand -- *if* you prime with malt sugars, 
*then* you shouldn't worry about a little oxygen in the bottle, since the
yeast will use it.  If you prime with corn sugar, however, Miller points
out that the Crabtree effect kicks in, and the oxygen is untouched by the
yeast.  


Sometimes I refrigerate the trub after racking into primary -- by bottling
time this separates, leaving enough wort to prime with.  I guess the first
runnings would work as well, since you'd only have to save a small amount.
For the homebrewer, though, once you've boiled that small amount and then
separated the hot and cold break, will there be anything left?  It might
take a few attempts to get the volume right.


Thanks for the info, Ulick.  I've heard a few bad comments about some of
the other books in this series, but so far only good things about this 
one.  Guess I better go buy it..

Salutations all!


    I'm an extract brewer that uses spec. grains and starter cultures that
just brewed a Steam beer. 
Anyway, here's the recipe:
                        Ginger Steamer


        6#   unhopped Amber liquid extract
        1#   120L Carmel Malt
        1/2# Victory Malt (25L) (Oven Toasted at 350F for 15 min)
        1/2# Double Malt (45L)


        1 oz Chinnok 13.6 % (Boil)
        1/2 oz Cascade (15 min left)
        1/2 oz Cascade (7 min left)
        1/2 oz Cascade (2 min steep)
        ~1 oz fresh Ginger indiscriminatly put in the last few minuets of
        the boil (15-5 min left)


    I will dry hop with 1/2 oz Cascade when I rack to the seconday.


    Oh, I am using Wyeast's California yeast, smells GREAT!

Subject: Dark Grains - Mashout


I've only just started adding the dark grains at mashout, but my initial
impressions are:


1) It takes a little more, since the extraction time/temp is less.
2) It greatly reduces the astringent harshness that comes with high
amounts of dark grains.
3) It makes chocolate malt more coffee-like and less burned.
4) Small amounts of black patent (3 oz.) can add color with no perceptible
burned taste.


I haven't tried it with a stout (roast barley) yet, so that's still a
mystery to me.  I'd like to hear more about other brewers experiences.

 Just for the record, the price I quoted you was for 2nd air shipment of a 20 
 mill.  I refuse to deal with the US Postal Service on this item but I am sure 
 most retailers have no such compuction regarding routine brewing supplies and 
 the cost would be far less than UPS air.

 Someone quoted the Wyeast packet as a vindication of the 1.020 starter wort 
 gravity and I only ask, where did THEY get the number?  These things have a 
 tendancy to gain a life of their own and rattle around forever.
 
 ..........
 
 Here's another GREAT IDEA from the World's Greatest Brewer....
 
 This one is untested but considering the source, it's gotta work.
 
 For the poverty stricken brewer who just knows that kegging is the way to go 
 but has to feed the kids before buying tank and regulator, it has occurred to 
 me that a very simple alternative exists.
 
 Take an empty keg and and drop in a chunk of dry ice.  Seal it up and connect 
 it to the keg of beer and the job is done.  A few inexpensive refinements 
 would be an air pressure gage to monitor what is going on, a valve or two and 
 even a regualtor if funds allow.
 
 I have no idea how much ice is required to develop what pressures and for how 
 long but, as it's not my problem, I leave the details to those venturesome 
 experimenters who have contributed so much to this hobby in the past.
 
 js
 
 p.s.  To protect myself from greedy lawyers, I would not suggest doing this 
 without a pressure gage and close monitoring till we know what to expect.  I 
 believe the Cornelius kegs are rated at 150 lbs but I have never and would 
 never go above 50 lbs with them.   I would have been delighted to run these 
 tests but the idea came to me last night will filling the last of my 4 kegs 
 and it will be awhile till I have an empty one.

Subject: Question on sterile wort preparation






Several people have mentioned using a pressure cooker
to can sterile wort for the purpose of yeast culturing.
This idea appeals to me, since the pressure cooker would
sterilize the wort and containers, thereby allowing somewhat
relaxed sanitization procedures during wort preparation.
However, when it comes time to use the wort, it must be
poured out of the canning jars and into the vessel which
will be used to culture the yeast, with the associated
contamination risks.


It would be nice if the same jar that was used in the pressure
cooker could accept an air lock.  This way, when it came time
to make the starter, one could simply take the jar of sterile
wort off the shelf, open it, put in the yeast, and attach
a sanitized airlock.


Does anyone know of small-mouthed jars with accompanying
small lids and rings, (sort of like a miniature Ball jar), 
which would accomodate a drilled stopper?


Some may consider this a ridiculous idea, but I feel that
anything that simplifies my yeast culturing is worthwhile.

Indeed, one should use common sense with regard to the color of the wort 
and hopping rate used in the starter and the target beer.  Because starter
wort is usually diluted (see below), you don't have to be too anal about 
this.
>
>Anyone else have experience with this method?  


I do it all the time.  Usually I recover 2-4 pints of wort from the kettle
trub (filter it through a fine mesh nylon hop bag) and then boil can it
in mason jars.  Sometimes I just pitch the cooled wort into the fermenter
(keeps that total extract rate high), sometimes I use it for Krausening
(all natural..) and if I am low on starters I'll dilute the wort to 1.020
before canning and store those in my beer box.  I also use recoverd
wort for plating and slants: Just add 2% flaked agar (from the chinese
section of the grocery store) boil to dissolve, strain and boil can in 
small mason jars for storage.  


A plug for more complicated brewing:


Yeast management is amazingly simple and easy once you get over the hurdle
of doing it.  Just like all grain, it does
involve a little extra effort, but the $$ savings over $5 yeast packets
is considerable.  Since recovering wort and canning it is part of my 
usual kitchen clean up, after brewing, it doesn't seem to take any extra
time.  Building up yeast doesn't take much time either: I just have to 
start two days earlier that when using a Wyeast packet.

Jean's comments on the lipid content of oats prompted me to go looking in the
supermarket this weekend. I found that flaked oats, oat bran and wheat bran all
contained from 5-10% fat by weight. In the case of the 'brans', that presumably
means they are adding back the germ, no? The levels in the flakes varied
considerably, presumably depending upon whether whole grain cereals were
employed or not. Interestingly, the oat bran contained considerably more
carbohydrate than the wheat bran. I made a test mash of oat bran alone today
and obtained an extract of around 30/lb/Imp gall, ie, comparable to the flakes.
Viscosity, however, seemed less on an informal basis. One thing that has me
slightly bemused is that I would expect a 7% lipid content to result in an
immiscible layer whenever the substance was boiled in water; yet this does not
occur. Adding an additional 7% vegetable oil to the oat bran solution
certainly resulted in a visible layer.


I have had more head retention problems using exorbitant quantities of crystal
than I have had from using oats. By 'problems' I mean that it may require 3
month's maturation before the brew holds a decent head. A lot of factors are
presumably at work here, such as how much lipid is retained in the grain bed
(if mashing), how much gets bound up with the trub, how much attaches to any
finings which are employed, how much participates in esterification reactions,
etc (although George Fix seems to suggest that only saturated fats are
significant re ester formation). Following this line of reasoning, I guess that
fining can be deleterious to hop aroma?

This was certainly part of the reason tetraethyl-lead was banned. The
most important reason, however, was that lead poisons the platinum
catalyst in the catalytic converter that breaks down nitrogen oxides.
Even a minute amount of lead in the exhaust quickly makes the converter
useless...

Subject: Rye Crystal Malt




I read here last week that someone had found a source of rye malt.
I tried getting this myself, but the only source that I could find in Zymurgy
 had gone out of business.
The reason for my interest is that I was thinking of trying to make crystal
 rye malt from it.
Does anyone have a current source, and does anyone know whether soaking this
 stuff to make crystal malt would carry any risk of ergotism?
 Maybe I should ask the Pied Piper :-)


I was also looking for a source of quinoa and amaranth to no avail. 
I even tried to search the 'Net on the keyword "grain".
Anyone else have any luck, or know the protein/fat contents?


Jack said that he had used mulberries a while back. This was my favorite
berry, but since leaving sunny Australia, I've never seen them again.
Was this a local supply, or would it be possible for me to obtain some
somehow?


Sorry for the wish-list,


Marc Kelly.
