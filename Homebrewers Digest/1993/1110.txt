Subject: "Samiclaus" aka strongest beer in world


Hello all,
I just thought I'd let you know what I found out about
Samiclaus beer. For those of you who don't know it,
It is a high alcohol (14%) lager with a rich malty
taste an good hop balance. (I highly recommend anyone
to try it once). It is brewed once a year and lagered
for a year before sale. Anyway, the interesting thing
is that the yeast strain used to manage this feat is
under constant development. After fermenation is complete,
the surviving yeasts are plated out and reused the following
year. What amazed me was that the beer could be so 
standardized from year to year. It appears that this 
technique works well for bottom fermenting yeasts,
but not ale yeasts. The latter are prone to yeast weakness
whereby they revert to an ancestoral genetic makeup,
thereby spoiling the beer.
The head brewer did say however that sometimes problems
present themselves: this years fermentation started
perfectly normally, but then stopped - for THREE months.
Just as strangely it then restarted of it's own accord,
but with serious overattenuation (>30 Plato down to 3,
roughly equal to 17% alcohol!).
The moral of this tale is that even the biggest Swiss
brewer has trouble with his yeast.
Another thing the brewer mentioned was that they
expose their malt to water for 7 seconds before milling
to soften the shell (sorry I've forgotten the proper name).
This has the effect of crushing the inside while only
splitting the husk (knew I'd remember it). This makes
for better lautering. We didn't get onto how you expose
malt to water for 7 seconds only, But he said they did that
because of the delay between milling and mashing (ca.5-10 hours).
To wet and the malt would mash itself.
I'll be using some of his malt in my next batch, and will
try spraying the malt with one of those plant sprays.
Any opinions? Has anyone done this?
Rob.

I toss all the spent grains on to the compost pile in the
back yard.  That seems to me to be the best use of the grains.
And adding 10 lbs or so every couple of weeks really adds up to
a lot of compost.

How are you going to sterilize the grains before tossing them in ?
Boil them ?  Seems like you'd be asking to extract a pile of
tannins from the husks.  Then have the husks in contact with the wort/green
beer for a week or two ?


Doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

Why not add the extract to your boil kettle when you're making the batch ?
I see no reason to do this.  What about sterilizing the extract ?
If you want to bost the gravity, add it to the boil.

        Something even easier is of course available. It's
        called sugar-) You can always prime the keg just
        like real ale brewers. None of this fancy dry ice
        stuff. Best of all ale brewers have been doing it
        for centuries so the results are in.

Subject: aromatic malt




their are two belgian munich malts, one is called 'munich' and is about
6 lovibond and has a diastatic power of about 50.  the other darker
munich is called 'aromatic' and is about 21 lovibond and 29 diastatic power.
both malts will convert themselves although 29 dp is really pushing
it i suspect.


munich malt is made in the same way as pale ale or pilsener during the
initial stages of drying but the last stage is carried out at a higher
temperature.  the basic process for all kilned malts (pale ale, pilsner,
lager, mild ale, vienna, munich) involves drying the green malt which
has about 45% moisture at a low temperature until the moisture content
reaches about 12-18%.  regardless of the type of malt, a higher temperature
is needed at this point because this last bit of moisture is more difficult
to remove.  it is this stage that the each of the kilned malts 
develops its unique features.  the munich is dried at the highest temperature
and thus has darker color and less catalysts (enzymes).


by the way, contrary to what has been reported here, this process is 
basically the same the world over.  i.e., european and american munich
malts are made in the same way.

You know, I wonder if this reflects the dichotomy between those who
try to brew true to style (for competition or otherwise), and those
who just brew what they like.  One member of our club hates
competitions because of the focus on style -- he says "... this is a
good beer, I don't care if it's too/not enough (hoppy, malty, fruity,
whatever) for style X/Y/Z.  I like it."

Subject: spent grain in primary?/how about malt syrup?


I wouldn't put spent grain in the primary!  The grain is contaminated.
Some brewers exploit this by doing sour mashing, but the mashing is
done in a vessel, and is followed by a boil.  So, throw the spent
grains on the compost heap, or make a bread out of them.


I also wouldn't add malt syrup directly to the primary.  Again, you
want to boil the malt syrup for sanitation, and the boil does other 
things such as help the clarity of the resulting beer.

Subject: YEAST CULTURE, one


 
 
 
                  JACK SCHMIDLING ON YEAST CULTURE
 
                         Part one
 
                          Objective
 
 The objective of culturing yeast is to isolate a single cell from a beer or 
 culture that has the characteristics desired and encourage this cell to 
 reproduce enough offspring to start a new batch of beer.
 
 This is easier said than done but with reasonable care, luck and modest 
 investment, can be accomplished by the serious home brewer.
 
                           General Program
 
 The general program is to dilute the original culture and spread it over the 
 surface of a growth medium in a petri dish so that individual cells are far 
 enough apart to allow them to grow into visible colonies without touching 
 each other.
 
 A sample from one of these typical colonies is transferred to a test tube 
 containing a growth medium.  When this colony is actively growing, it is 
 considered a pure culture and can be refrigerated for later use or started by 
 covering with beer wort.  When this starter is actively fermenting, it is 
 poured into a larger amount of wort which, when active, is pitched into the 
 beer.
 
                           Basic Assumptions
 
 The procedure makes a number of assumptions which are correct, often enough 
 to allow it to work well enough, to satisfy most requirements.
 
 The first assumption is that one can select the desired strain by looking at 
 colonies on a petri dish.  This is more or less true because the overwhelming 
 majority will be the same, i.e. the dominant strain.  Bacteria, molds and 
 many wild yeasts are obvious and recognizable to the naked eye.
 
 The second assumption is that, while still very small, all round colonies are 
 the progeny of single cells.
 
 The third assumption is that all such colonies, at least in the center are 
 mono clonal or at least mono-cultures and otherwise sterile.
 
 To do the job right, one would have to study the original diluted culture 
 under high magnification and do a presort at that level.  This is revealing 
 and fun.  It also gives an indication of any bacterial contamination in the 
 culture but the rub is marking individual cells and finding them later when 
 they grow into colonies.  This is done using a calibrated X-Y stage on the 
 microscope and making careful notes.  Fortunately, however, I do not believe 
 that it is really necessary for the home brewer, although a must for the lab 
 selling selected strains.
 
                             Details
 
 There are many growth media available for the purpose and no doubt someone 
 can recommend a source or recipe for the ideal but for my experiments, I 
 mixed two packets (16 gr) of Knox gelatin with one cup of 1.020 wort.  After 
 heating and dissolving, this is poured into petri dishes and test tubes and 
 sterilized in a pressure cooker for 15 min at 15 lb.
 
 It should be noted that a pressure cooker is the preferred method of 
 sterilization but for our purposes, one could probably get by with steaming 
 in any pot with a lid and a half inch of water.  Set the dishes or slants in 
 or on a cup or some other support to keep them out of the water.
 
 The petri dishes are turned upside down after solidifying and cultured this 
 way to prevent water of condensation from falling on the medium.  The test 
 tubes are cooled on a slant to allow the water to settle on the bottom when 
 vertical.  They are also stuffed with cotton before going into the pc.  You 
 can also use tubes with plastic screwcaps and avoid the cotton.
 
 It should be noted that gelatin melts around 75 F so its use in summer is 
 precarious.   The better alternative to gelatin is agar agar.  This is 
 available at oriental food stores in stick form.  Half a stick (about 4 
 inches) in a cup of wort will get you through the hottest weather.

I recently puchased some liquid yeast cultures from my local homebrew
supplier. Unfortunately he no longer has Wyeast cultures but he said the
Yeast Labs cultures he had in stock (distributed by G.W. Kent) were just as
good.
    I have the following questions about these cultures:


    (1) Are these the same yeasts as Wyeast? I purchased a California Lager
        and an American Ale (is this 1056)?


    (2) The fermentation temperature suggested for both of the above is in
        the 70 degree range. Is this correct for the lager yeast?


    (3) The cultures come in clear plastic tubes. No inner pouch or anything
        similiar to burst. Do I simply dump the contents of the tube into a
        starter?

Subject: Dry Yeast


I have personally reviewed the Whitbread production procedures for dry
yeast. Not only are they using a new facility, but their procedures
are new with a strong accent on downstream quality control, the point
of the process that caused problems in the past. For the record, our
analysis of this yeast did include Rodney Morris' incremental actidione
method for detecting wild yeast. This showed less than 1 nonculture cell
per 10 million viable yeast cells. Crosby and Baker is currently
distributing this yeast to both commercial customers and home brew shops.


Crosby and Baker is also distributing the Mauri yeast from Australia. I
have tested this yeast as well, and it too meet specs. C+B has my report,
which contains the detailed plate counts.


The Red Star products from Universal Foods have not as yet been tested.
I have had several discussions with Dr. Foy, the QC biologist at Universal.
They have not made beer yeast for over a year, and will be introducing  
entirely new production procedures for their new yeast. Whether this leads
to improved product quality remains to be seen. But it very definitely is
not business as usual.


I hope this and my previous post are not seen as an endorsement of dry yeast.
Each of these strains have their own personality, which may or may not be
to a particular brewer's taste. For example, the Mauri strain is a "pure"
version of a well known Australian yeast. The test brews we did with this 
yeast indicated a clean but relatively bland finish, whereas the "impure"
version was awash in flavors of all sort. This yeast IMHO is a good strain
for beginners who are just starting to develop their techniques. What is
discernibly true is that the dry yeast of 1993 and in the future are and will
be produced with much more rigorous QC standards than at any point in the past.
As I noted in my first post, Wyeast gets credit for this as they were the one
who set the proper standards.

                          Part two
 
                      Isolating Cells
 
 The first step is to inoculate the petri dish with as diluted a mixture as 
 possible.  The books are full of procedures for doing this but I find the 
 simplest is just as good.  Take a copper wire or thin glass rod and heat 
 several inches in a flame to sterilize.  Dip this, when cool, into a working 
 beer or yeast culture.  If starting with dry yeast, dissolve one granule of 
 yeast in a test tube with about one inch of sterile water.  Gently drag the 
 inoculated wire across the gelatin in the petri dish, trying not to break the 
 surface.  Next, draw the wire across this line at several points, to further 
 dilute the sample.  Turn the dish over onto the cover and "incubate" at room 
 temp for several days.  Do this on several dishes just for insurance and as 
 controls.
 
 
                       Pure Culture
 
 The next step is to visually inspect the surface of the petri dish under low 
 magnification (hand lens or naked eye will do) to pick out a "typical" colony 
 that appears to have come from a single cell.  All colonies should be 
 rejected that are any shape other than perfectly round and differ in any way 
 from the majority.
 
 Flame your wire again and after cooling, remove a small sample from the 
 center of the selected colony and poke this into the surface of the medium in 
 a "slant" test tube.  You can do this to several slants, with the same 
 sample, to assure all slants are the same or flame the wire and take a new 
 sample from a different colony.  You can make as many slants as you will need 
 for several months and throw away the petri culture.
 
 You now "incubate" the slants until 25% or more of the surface is covered 
 with the pure colony and then refrigerate them till needed.
 
                                Starting
 
 When needed for use, cover the slant with sterile wort and pitch when ready, 
 i.e fermenting.  For best results, this starter should be used to pitch about 
 a pint of wort, a day or so before brew day.
 
 This process can be used on anything from a packet of Red Star to a bottle of 
 your favorite beer and will produce a pure culture.  There is no guarantee 
 however, that the strain will remain the same for ever because of natural 
 mutation.   As it is my experience that the most common and objectionable 
 contaminants of dry yeast are bacteria and mold, this process will guarantee 
 at least, to eliminate these most serious problems.
 
                         SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURE
          
 An even simpler process can be used if one is not interested in isolating 
 single cells and has confidence that the starting culture is pure.
 
 This procedure skips the petri dish part and assumes one is starting with a 
 packet of liquid yeast or a culture slant obtained from a reliable source.
 
 After preparing the agar/wort medium and a convenient number of slant culture 
 tubes, they are simply inoculated directly from the culture.
 
 Using the sterile procedure outlined above, just dip into the packet of 
 liquid yeast with the transfer wire and poke this into the agar in the 
 sterile slants.  One dip is enough to inoculate several tubes.  You can use 
 the rest of the yeast in the packet to start the next batch but the slants 
 can be saved for a year or more.
 
 If you use a purchased culture slant, the same procedure applies.  Poke the 
 wire into the yeast culture and then poke this into the slants.  Save the 
 original for future iterations.  If you started with a liquid yeast packet, 
 save the last slant to start a new group.
 
 Using this simple approach, one can go several years without spending a penny 
 on yeast and possibly forever once you get into the "yeast swapping" mode.  I 
 have yet to buy any yeast since I stopped using dry.
 
 While this is not necessarily music to the ears of yeast suppliers, it is 
 good news to the homebrewer.  That $'s for yeast in the bill of materials 
 becomes zero to the yeast culturer.  Yeast suppliers (like extract suppliers) 
 will no doubt always be with us and in the case of yeast, we need them to 
 maintain pure strains when ours go south.  But to keep buying the stuff for 
 routine use is strictly for the affluent and laz.... naw, I won't do that 
 again.

Don, goes on to explain why he is still skeptical of dry yeasts.  With
all due respect, Don, how much of your data is concrete and how much is
conjecture?  I'm willing to accept your arguments, but have you visited
the plants that make these yeasts?  Have you talked to the manufacturers?
I don't mean to flame you -- I think you make some good points, but I just
want to know if this is based on concrete evidence.

Are you familiar with all the equipment George has at his disposal?  I am
aware of the fact that he has some pretty heavy-duty equipment available,
and would not doubt that there's quite a bit more that I don't know
about.


**************************
Mark wrote about a kit beer made with dry yeast rehydrated in 70F wort with
an original gravity of 1041, which stopped fermenting after about two days.
I would have quoted his text, but MARK FAILED TO USE CARRIAGE RETURNS, WHICH
MADE A MESS ON MY TERMINAL WHEN I TRIED TO INSERT A ">" AT THE BEGINNING OF
EACH LINE.


I recommend that you not use wort to rehydrate dry yeast -- you are not only
stressing the yeast, but tempting the remaining live ones to produce off
flavors.  Secondly, if you fermented at around 70 to 72F, a 1041 wort could
easily have fermented out in two days.  It would have helped to know the
temperature of the surroundings and if there were any sudden temperature
changes that could have knocked the yeast out.  If there were no sudden
temperature changes and you fermented above 68F, I'd suspect that it's done.
If your SG turns out to be below 1010, I'd say it femented out.  Give it a
few more days and then bottle.  If the SG is well above 1010, then I'd say
something happened to the yeast.  You could try making up a starter of
fresh yeast and pitching it after it finishes fermenting out (to ensure
that you are not adding addional oxygen to your main wort).

I have no hard data on this, but my gut feeling is that I would
recommend against it.  Actually, it would make something like Ninkasi
 --if memory serves correctly, the "beer" of ancient Babylonia did not
have the grains removed -- talk about liquid bread!


I'm raising squirrels the size of pit bulls with my spent grains.  I just

It's sanitary, and I assume you are adding it to water, so it will, er...
work..., I guess, but you still want to sanitize the water and would *like*
to boil the wort to get the proteins to coagulate, but technically it would
make beer.

You can get away with not mashing it (using it as a specialty grain)
in dark beers, but it will make light-colored beers cloudy if you

 hi all, 


after reading in the last two issues, i remember i owe a review on the maltmill
i bought - yes off jack - last fall.  i have the adjustable one and after
hearing a war story from a fellow brewer (commercial - both of us) i am glad
i do.  mine has worked very well in crushes of malted wheat, crystal and 2 row
pale (both MF and canada malting).  thruput is so far fair ( but them i ask a
lot). i can easily got thru 10lbs in a few minutes (with var speed drill).
i have yet to grind a full 100lbs+/- in it tho i do not forsee a problem, 
provided the spinning of the rollers is not to slow nor to fast.


(anyone got any hints at the correct rpm for the rollers - max thruput and
least hassels)


on the other hand - this fellow brewer - had a hell of a time.  again this
was with the non-adjustable roller model.  the bill called for pale malt (MF)
crystal malt (MF) and choc malt (MF).  i was not there when the problems came
up - but the crystal ended up to fine,  the pale did not feed properly
and the guy had to rush out to get a corona.  now mind you this is a motorized
(probably too fast) with hoppers above and below. the total grain bill was on 
order of around 100lbs (+/- 20 - i don't ask what he puts in his beers ). the 
first 20lbs or so of the pale did run ok.  he is going ot order the adjustment
kit and upgrade.


anyway from my experience and his, if you get one get the adjustable one.

Subject: WYEAST contamination?


There has been a thread recently about contamination of dry yeasts, but what
about liquid?  From what I can make out, one form of contamination,
apparently somewhat prevalent in the old Whitbread, is by a wild yeast which
can ferment dextrine, giving excessively dry and bland beer.  This is just
what happened to me with a batch of 1056!


My first brew went from 1.036 down to 1.006, as measured with a hydrometer.
I've never had such a low reading, and the beer sure is bland.  I can hardly
taste anything in it.


The second batch used the slurry from the secondary of the above, and went
from 1.044 down to 1.008.  I would normally expect 1.012 minimum for this
type of beer.  This, too, is somewhat bland.


Both the above had some crystal malt, although I forget how much without my
notes.


My latest use of another pack of 1056 went from 1.044 to 1.013, much more
expected.


Has anyone else had WYEAST problems like this?

I would strongly advise against this course of action.  From what I have read
grain is highly contaminated with bacteria (lactobacillus, I think).  If you
put your spent grain directly in your primary, you are risking a 
serious infection.  If you boil the grain to sanitize it,
you will end up extracting tanins from the husks.  This would probably (sheer
guess, here) be detectable even in a dark beer.

Here's a few:  I have heard of some people using it to suplement their pet's
food.  Also, do you have a compost heap?  Maybe you could dry it and make your
own granola?  I've never done it, but it sounds easier than bread.


Hey, maybe you could make bread with it, then add the bread to your next batch
in the mash.  For that good ol' summerian taste!  


Just a thought.

I have a difficult time cleaning the plastic tubing I use for
siphoning and blow-off.  For this reason, I end up going through a lot
of tubing, and probably wasting a lot of money.  This causes me to
ask the following questions:


Grainger stocks vinyl and polyethylene tubing which "conforms to
FDA standards", although they state that the vinyl product exhibits
a "slight" taste and odor.  They sell this stuff pretty cheaply.
Can I use this for siphoning?


(For some reason, Home Depot does not carry the I.D. tube that fits my 
bottle filler.)


In grad school, we used plastic tube called Tygon, which I believe was
autoclavable.  Can this be used for beer?


Finally, does anyone know where I can get 1" ID blow-off tube?


Thanks for all of your help.

        Hi All,


           I recently purchased a Maltmill with the roller adjustment,
        and would like to share my experiences with it.  I would like to
        preface my remarks by stating that I used a corona for about two
        years before getting a Maltmill.
           It arrived in good shape, and required just a few minutes to assemble.
        There are two bolts that fasten the roller assembly to the baseboard,
        and one other to fasten the crank.  I set it up, ground a pound of malt,
        and used an old toothbrush to clean up the rollers.
          Upon reading the enclosed instructions, it only took a few minutes to
        adjust it properly for two row.  I dropped a few grains onto the rollers,
        none of it fell through.  I ground a handful of malt on this setting, the
        grain chunks were a little large, so I tweaked the adjustment just a bit
        tighter.  I ran a pound through at that setting, each kernel was broken
        into several small pieces and the husks were virtually intact.  There were
        a few grains that *looked* whole, but when I picked them up it turned out
        that they were crushed so gently that they just didn't seperate from the
        husks.  I've never gotten that good a crush out of a corona, despite doing
        all the modifications to it that have been posted in HBD.
          The throughput of the MM is very impressive, in fact, if I had a
        complaint with the mill, it would be that it grinds a pound so fast
        that I had to keep stopping to refill the hopper.  I solved this by
        notching the bottom of a 4 gallon food grade bucket so that it
        fit snugly inside the hopper.  The bucket holds 8 pounds of grain
        easily, I only needed to stop to refill once, so I was able to grind
        10 pounds of grain for a batch in under 10 minutes.  This used to take
        30-40 minutes with the corona.
          The mill itself is designed to sit on a bucket, so that the output
        from the mill is easily collected.  I had seen a demonstration of an
        early version of the MM that required a shallow pan to catch the crushed
        grain, which had to be emptied every couple of pounds.  The newer version
        is a distinct improvement, the 5 gallon food grade bucket I placed
        under the mill easily contained all the grist.
          My extraction did not go up, but I really didn't expect it to.  I
        get 30 pts/lb/gal with infusion and 33 with decoction mashing.  The
        biggest difference in brewing with grain crushed with the MM was how
        incredibly fast the runoff from my lauter tun cleared.  With the
        corona, by the time I adjusted it to produce small enough chunks
        of grain to get decent extraction, the husks were pretty well trashed
        and there was a lot of flour.  This meant I used to have to recirculate
        1-2 gallons of runoff before it cleared, with all of the associated
        problems of heat loss and HSA.  With the MM, there was very little flour
        and the husks were virtually intact, providing good filtration, so the
        runoff cleared after 1 quart!  I was quite literally *stunned* how fast
        it cleared.  Scarcely believing my eyes, I recirculated a second quart,
        which ran crystal clear.  I don't think this was really necessary, I
        could easily have gotten away with recirculating just the one quart.
          In all fairness, the corona was *intended* to produce flour for
        making tortillas.  If one goes to the trouble of removing the snap ring,
        filing the end of the impeller shaft flat, replacing the cotter pin that
        retains the movable plate to minimize wobble, and gaps the plates
        correctly, the corona will do an adequate job at something it was never
        designed to do, i.e., crush malt.  I took each of these steps, and they
        all helped produce a better crush, but IMHO, for quality of crush,
        throughput, and ease of collection of the grist, the Maltmill is far
        superior.
          I, for one, am a very satisfied customer.  Congratulations on a fine
        product, Jack.
        
                                     Cheers,
                                      Jim

Subject: hop utilization


  The discussion of a 20% loss in hops utilization in going from pellets
to whole hops made me realize why one of my recent beers was surprisingly
over-bitter.  First let me say that I always use whole hops.  Usually
I pull some of them open to expose more of the lupulin glands, but a lot
of the cones are still intact even after the boil.  What was unique 
about this "Bitter Steam" was that, rather than manually pull the hops 
apart, I put them into a coffee grinder and gave it a few spins.  
They chopped up very nicely.  I now believe that this chopping exposed 
virtually *all* of the lupulin glands, resulting in a greatly increased 
utilization.


   In fact, what are pellets if not chopped up whole hops?
