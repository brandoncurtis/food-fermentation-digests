The dococtions do caramelize a bit and I'll bet that there would be a
slightly different flavor with a decoction mashed batch as opposed to an
infusion mashed batch with the same ingredients.  Probably not too big
a difference.  I've read somewhere that decoction mashing was primarily
a way to get consistent temperatures before the advent of the thermometer
(think about it), but the "modern" breweries that still use the decoction
method, like the brewers of Pilsner Urquell, use (I believe) a less
modified malt which would require triple decoction for reasonable yields.

No, the heaviest third DOES include grain.  A few months ago, Darryl
Richman finally cleared up the reason that the decoctions did not
extract gobs of tannins: its the pH!  Indeed, the decoction mashing
method would work much better in a cooler than a kettle.

Try a tried-and-true recipe and let us know how the beers compare, infusion
vs. decoction.

I'd recommend against it.  Many suggestions in those older homebrewing
books from England are full of errors.  Naturally, boiling anything
will tend to diminish aromatics (consider hops), and perhaps it would
be best to add the brown sugar in the last 5 minutes of the boil --
just long enough to sanitize, but minimizing any loss of aromatics.

No, it's not that frequently asked... actually.  The answer is, depends.


On average, I'd say a homebrewed, unfiltered beer, stored at 65F would
be perfect for two months and then slowly begin to decline in quality.
Unless infected, most homebrew would be drinkable for more than a year.
The following factors *increase* storagablity:


high alcohol, 
high hop rate,
cold,
oxygen-scavenging bottlcaps (PureSeal(tm), aka Smartcaps(tm)),
small headspace in the bottle, and
stable yeast strain.


The following factors *decrease* storagablity:


bacterial infection,
wild yeast infection,
aeration during bottling,
large headspace in the bottle,
heat,
light, and
unstable yeast strain.

Wyeast #1056 tends to be slow in general and, although it has been reported
to ferment down to 55F, I've heard that it should be fermented well above
60F.  I proved this with a recent batch.  As the fermentation temperature
approaches 60F, the yeast slows down to a crawl.  I suggest you find a
way to warm it up to about 65F.  1056 also tends to lose all its "ale"
character in the low 60s.

I would suspect two areas of problems: 1) a very bad crush, or 2) channelling
in your lauter tun.  Was the "grain bag" the kind with cloth sides and a
mesh bottom (the right kind) or the kind that's mesh-all-over.  The
mesh-all-over type have a tendancy to allow all the sparge water to head
immediately to the sides of the bucket and the channelling at the sides
pulls all the sparge water along the wall of the bucket and not through
the grain.

I just read an article in _The Beverage People News_ that states that
sulfites do not kill bacteria, they only "stun" them.  I immediately got

Subject: Unusual recipies


I posted this request to rec.crafts.brewing on the
network and due to lack of response decidied to widen 
the call. 


When I got started in the wonderful world of homebrewing 
18 months and 18 batches ago I quickly found myself making
some, for the lack of a better word, unusual beers.  Not
at all the beers I envisioned myself creating when I started.


I figured I could buy just about any style of beer I wanted
and the main reason for me to homebrew was to create something
not commercially available.


I started with the wheat beers, whose light palette lends
themselves to an easy bastardization.  Cherry and raspberry
batches were not very adventurous so the great watermelon
experiment was performed.   From there spruce and chocolate,
whit and kriek. Molasses, honey and maple syrup. Yes it was
enough to make a beer purist shudder.  Rhienhosptgiet, why 
I don't even know how to spell it.


To make a somewhat long story somewhat shorter, my last batch 
has some of my friends questioning my hold on reality.  Captain 
Crunch Crunchberries and strawberry poptart ale.
 
*_Here is call for all you would be gross-out artists to brag._*


I would like to receive a description of all of your most
adventurous, innovative or just plain wacky experiments.
They don't have to be tasty; for by our failures we
learn as much, if not more, as by our successes.  Extra points
for leaving the vegetarian nature of brewing.


I will compile and post.

Subject: eternal ferment


Hello Brew Sages:


A few weeks ago, I asked you what you thought about my 'nonstop fermentation'
and the concensus was that I should not throw the stuff out but check the 
airlock and the S.G.  I won't print the recipe again.  Suffice to say it's
an extract brew with half a pound of maple syrup and 2 oz of apricot
flavoring intended for wines, and Edme dry yeast.


Update: now after eight weeks, it ain't over.  The airlock is still giving
a feeble 'glug' once every 70 seconds.  The color got noticeably darker.  
No off flavors to suggest contamination. Specific gravity down to about 1.009 
(I think).


Question: can I bottle this now?  I'd really like to get on to my next batch
and only have one carboy.  But I'd hate to ruin this one just because I
got impatient.  If I do bottle, should I decrease priming sugar from the
standard 3/4 cup?


As long as I've got your collective ear: I just enjoyed some Catamount
porter.  Is this a good example of the style?


Hell, someone's got to ask all the questions around here. 
Kirk

I use Super Boomerang. This program is included in the Now Utilities package
from Now Software. It has a Find command which will scan every file on a disk 
(hard or floppy) for a keyword. The name of every file with the keyword is
displayed. You can then choose one of the files and the program will display a
three line section containing the keyword to see how it is used in context.
This is helpful if you use the keyword "hops" to look for posts on growing
hops as opposed to using hops in brewing beer. If the keyword is used more
than once in a file you can view each occurrance in context. After you are
done looking through a file you can select another file from the list
displayed.

Hi All..


I recently came into an old Beermeister; a litle 'fridge with a standard
and tap mounted on the top.  It needed a little modification to take the
5 gallon soda kegs - a bit too tall.  It works great, and I'm really
happy, except that the cooling element (?) gets a bunch of frost buildup
on it.  The cooling mechanism in this device looks _very_ primitive.
I was wondering if I hooked a Hunter  AirStat up to it, could I program it
in some way that might let it have a "defrost" phase?  Does anyone else have
any experience with this?  Should I just learn to live with it and throw it
out on the back porch for a few days every six months?


On another note, how long should I expect my 20lb CO2 tank to last?  I got
it last summer and have made at least 10 batches of beer since then.  I
also use it to push the sterilizer out of the keg when cleaning it.  The
pressure gauge for the high side hasn't really moved.


Any ideas???

My local homebrew shop also sells small packets of off-white
"heading agent."  I didn't ask the manufacturer's name, but I
did ask about the contents:  "ground bark of the gum acacia
tree" I was told.  It's pupose is to reduce surface tension.
I use it all the time by adding it to my priming sugar before
adding water and boiling.  It's probably not necessary if you
have very clean utensils and beer glasses, but it helps fight
off detergents, oils, and other head killers that tend to
creep into the brews we less careful brewers produce.  Anyway,
at 1/2 tsp per 5 gals, it goes a long way.  Back when I brewed
only extract I noticed a definite improvement using it.  I
suspect I don't need it now that I brew all grain, but I'm in
the habit.

Decoction is technique that provides other benefits besides additional 
extract.  It coagulates more proteins and therefore produces a clearer, 
more stable product.  It also aids in melanoidin formation, which can 
increase the perception of the malty character of your beer, as well as 
adding some color.  It gains the extra extract by completely 
solibulizing all of the starch from the malt, which can also lead to 
clearer, more stable beer.  It tends to remove more of the DMS 
character that will come from lightly kilned malts, and makes the wort 
more compatible with sulfury hops and/or yeast that accentuate sulfur 
character.

No, the heaviest third does include malt solids.  You do actually boil 
the malt, husks and all.  (The next question is always "Why doesn't 
this extract tannins from the husks?";  I believe that the pH controls 
this extraction, and since the pH of the decoct is in the low 5's, none 
is extracted.  Hot water above pH 6 will extract tannins.)  For a first 
try at decoction, I would recommend pulling more than 1/3 -- perhaps 
40% -- since many variables are at work in determining whether your 
rest temperature is achieved (amount of cooling in transport of decoct 
back into the mash tun, how much the decoct cools as you add it back, 
etc.)  By returning the decoct slowly, you can observe the temperature 
rise;  if you have too much, you can cool the remaining decoct after 
the rest temperature is achieved with cold water.

I did spend all day with my first decoction.  Part of that was due to 
it going from a planned two decoction mash to a four decoction, because 
I was far short of my temperature marks.  But having got beyond that, 
decoction requires less equipment than a step infusion, and I believe, 
produces a different spectrum of flavors and aromas.

Subject: Carbonation in bottle-primed beer


Can someone recommend a technique for making bottle carbonation
a little more predictable without investing in counterpressure
filling?  By predictable, I mean time to condition, and carbonation
level.  Does anyone have experience with pitching fresh yeast when
priming, and how exactly do you do it?


By way of example, I have 5 gallons of porter in bottles
which are absolutely flat (and no yeast sediment)
after 1 week from priming with 1 pt water and
1/2 cup corn sugar and conditioning at 65F.  Although this period
is a little brief, my experience would indicate that I am in for
a long wait for carbonation if there is no carbonation at all at this
point.  I've noticed this problem in moderately (1055) to very (109X)
big beers which spent a long time in secondary.


If I get any attractive ideas, I'll implement them on the other half of
the batch.  Unfortunately, the experiment 
will not be very scientific, as the
in-bottle half is Wyeast 1028 whereas the in-secondary half is
bottle-cultured Sierra Nevada.


By the way, I think there is some kind of natural law that makes
these problems occur on beer that is absolutely delicious :-).


Thanks in advance...

On the bottom of the carboy lies a thick (4-5 inches) layer of trub.
The fermentation is going full speed (no noticible blowoff though in it's
19th hour of fermentation) but the yeast sems to be collecting on top
of this layer of dense fermentables rather than eating into it.  I used
Irish moss with this batch, and haven't done so in months.  Is this
normal for beers brewed with the stuff?I'm gonna give it a few days yet
to see what happens, but the seperation in both color  and consistency
between the top and bottom is remarkable.  For those out there interested

3#syrup/3#dry extract and 1#munich/1#crystal/ 1/2# roasted.
Any comments/ helpful words of wisdom?

Subject: beer from Brussels/Antwerp - BBrite effectiveness


A buddy of mine will be spending the next 5 months working in
Brussels and Antwerp and has offered to bring me back some beer.
Any suggestions on local brews to bring back? I like all types of beer
(except those that taste watered down).


On sanitation, I have brewing 4 years now and use partial mashes. I did
have one gusher my first year but haven't had any real problems since.
I use BBrite soaks and cleaning for 5 - 10 minutes followed by a little
rinsing by tapwater on my brewing equipment and soak
my bottles in bleach solution overnight. I now plan on
storing some beer in bottles longer than the 4 or so months they last
now to maybe 8 months. I usually don't brew from May to August and would
like to store a variety of beers styles (I usually have 5 or 6 at any time
during my "brew season") over the summer in my basement (~68 degrees).
However, I have been wondering if BBrite soaks and cleaning for 5-10
minutes is sufficient. Since any batch doesn't last past 4 months, I don't
know for sure that there haven't been slight infections that are not 
apparent after 4 months but that could be a problem at 8 months.


To summarize: how effective is BBrite used in short (5-10 min) durations
as a sanitizer?

What was the pH of the sparge water ?
I've found that acidifying it (pH 5.5 or so) helps my extraction rates.


How good was the filter action ?  Did the sparge water run completely
through the grain bed, or was some/most of it channeled though, without
contacting the grain ?

  Higher yield is just one benefit of decoction mashing.  The gelatinization
of insoluble starch and reduction of high molecular weight proteins that
occurs during decoction mashing produce a wonderfully clear, clean-tasting
finshed product.
  There are also certain styles that benefit greatly from decoction mashing.
I use this type of mashing for wheat beers, because of the proteins, and
for Bohemian pilsners and any German lagers that require a malty character.
IMHO, decoction mashing produces an incredible malt character, in both the
nose and the flavor of a beer.  I have never been able to produce the same
effect with infusion mashing, regardless of ingredients used or how high
the saccharification rest temperature was held.

Removing the "heaviest third" of the mash is also called a thick
decoction, and involves removing mostly grain and very little liquid.
I assume your concern is that boiling the grain will extract tannins
from the husks, and cause astringency in the final product.  Due to the
low pH of the mash being boiled, this does not occur.


>This is really hard
>to do for those of us who mash in a pot on the stove instead of in a Gott


When I use decoction mashing, I do the first saccharification rest
using exactly this method, by heating the thick decoction to 152F-155F
and holding that temperature for 30 minutes, essentially doing stove
top mashing.


>Maybe I'll try it if I have an entire Saturday
>to blow on it.


The decoction procedure I use requires 2 - 2.5 hours for mashing, or about
one hour longer than it takes me to do a single infusion mash.  I've done
about 20 batches using decoction mashing, it has never taken all day.

   I'd like to commend you on where you went right.  You seem to have the
basics of sparging down, recirculating the initial runoff, sparging with
water at a reasonable temperature, sparging for a reasonable duration,
monitoring the pH of the mash and of the wort going to the boiler.
Actually, you did many things "right".
   I'm assuming your concern is with your extraction rate, let's see:


        28 * 6 / 7.25lbs means your sparge extraction was around 24pts/lb/gal,
bearing in mind that the gravity was measured after the boil, which will
lower the gravity somewhat.  This is not terrible extraction, especially for
a first effort.  It's a little difficult to offer suggestions to improve
your extraction without more details of your process, but I can mention some
things to look out for that do impact extraction.


   What was your crush like?  Ideally, each kernel should be broken into
several small pieces, and the husks left intact.  If you had large chunks
of kernel or uncrushed grains in your crush, this will reduce your
extraction.  Try grinding as fine as possible without pulverizing the
husks.


   How fast did you sparge?  While there has been no consensus in this
forum on what the "correct" runoff rate is, my experience was that my
extraction dropped when I tried to run the wort off faster than 1 gallon 
per 8 minutes, or about 45 minutes to collect 6 gallons.  I use the Zapap
system as well.  If you completed sparging in less than 45 minutes, try
running off the wort a little more slowly.


        Not directly related to extraction, this is more of a recipe design
issue, but a little over 7 pounds of grain sounds a little light for a 6
gallon brew length.  This is, of course, dependant on what your target OG
was, and the efficiency of your specific system.  This latter point is key
to recipe design, you must know what level of extraction your system will
consistently produce in order to figure out the grain bill.  If you want a
higher gravity brew, try boiling down to 5 gallons, or if you're brewing
a 6 gallon batch, use another 1-2 pounds of base malt.


        I'm not sure about the use of distilled water either, everything I've
read suggests that this is not a good idea.  I can't quite recall why,
something to do with lack of necessary ions in the water.  Maybe someone
with a chemistry background can jump in here.


                                     Cheers,
                                      Jim

Subject: All-grain troubles


Jim Liddil recently described his problems with an all-grain batch using
7 lbs of pale malts and 1/2 lb of crystal.  He got something on the order
of 6 gallons of wort at 1.028, and asked what he could have done better.


First, there was nothing wrong with your technique or equipment.  I used
equipment almost identical to yours, including a piece of window screen
in the base of my Zapap (almost eqivalent to your grain bag).  In fact,
my last batch had a grain bill almost identical to yours--7 lbs pale malt,
1 lb crystal.  Here are some observations.


1) What were you trying to make?  This is an excellent grain bill for a
British bitter (I ended at OG 1.037), but if you were shooting higher you'd
need more malt.  Assume for the time being that you'll be able to raise
the OG of one gallon by 25 points for every pound of malt you use.  As your
technique gets better you will get more.


2) If things don't work out well, there are some things you can do.  In
no special order:


        a. Add some extract.  This has the advantage of allowing you to 
finish at any volume you want, regardless of the amount of sugar you have
(or have not) obtained from your grain.  The amount you add is likely to 
be trivial in comparison to the grain, so don't get hyper about purity.


        b. Boil more.  You ended up with 6 gallons from a 7 gallon sparge.
For instance, I started with 6.15 gallons that I boiled down to 4.5 or so,
then topped up to 5.3 with tap water to get the desired gravity.  You
could have continued boiling to about 4.5 gallons and have been on target
for a bitter.  You'd have to boil a long time to get to 1.055, though.


        c. Boil less.  This is appropriate if you get MORE sugar from you
grain than expected.  In effect, you're increasing the dilution.


Several issues back there was a good article on hitting target gravities in
Zymurgy (the mead issue), which included a chart for converting gravities
depending on the temperature of the sample.  You'll need it.  The rule in
all-grain brewing is not to base your brewing expectations on the amount
of finished beer you want, as this will constantly vary somewhat depending
on your extraction.  I'm on my fourth all-grainer; the first three left me
with 4.3-4.5 gallons at the end of fermentation, but this last one will 
probably leave me with well over 5 gallons, as I was able to pull more sugar
out.
        My procedure, in line with the above-mentioned article, is to do
my sparge to 1.008, then mix the wort well and take a gravity reading and
figure out how much wort I have.  For instance (from memory) I had 6.15
gallons at 1.033 before boiling on the bitter.  Since boiling vents off 
liquid but very little sugar, I could estimate a final yield of 5.5 gallons
at 1.037.  (My apologies if these numbers don't add up exactly--I leave
my brain at home when I come to work).  Basically, you just fiddle with the
volume and gravity until you get the match you want.
        For those who use those 32 qt. seafood cookers like mine, I've found
that 3 cm of liquid depth (measured at the center of the pot) equals one
gallon of liquid.  I just stick a spoon into the center, then measure the 
liquid level by marking the spoon.  This gets trickier when the liquid is
boiling, but that's life.  Anyway, I knew I had 6.15 gallons because the
liquid was 18.5 cm deep.  
        Hope this helps.

Subject: my diatribe on styles


Howdy folks, once again questions of validity on judging to style have
once again popped up here. The following is an artcile I posted to
rec.crafts.brewing in the past on this issue. It was also reprinted
in the Wort Processors Newsletter, and Pat Baker (of Crosby and Baker
and the HWBTA representative to the Beer Judge Certification Program)
expressed an interest in possibly using it for future BJCP materials.
Since it has been well received I figured I'd post it here in the hopes
of better explaining why styles are useful and where they fall short.




        JaH




Q:  I have a hard time with style definitions and judges' comments since I 
often look at certain flavor profiles as "defects."  Can you help me?


A:  Defect is a harsh word. There are a lot of flavors present in beer. These
arise from a variety of sources and vary widely with the style and the process.
Often characteristic flavors are strongly related to traditional processes used
to produce a certain style of beer.  As George Fix has indicated one can not
divorce the flavor of a particular style from its history.


So characteristics that are a desirable flavor in one beer are indeed
considered a defect in another, but this is not a random designation. This
arises from an understanding of the history, ingredients, and process in which
that beer is made.  For most of the styles used in competitions there is a
reasonable consensus as to what the characteristics of that style are.  The
styles are not defined in a vacuum, rather they arise from a cross section of
commercial beers that designate themselves to be of those styles as well as 
what I mentioned above (history, etc.).


Homebrewing is a hobby/art/science whereby a brewer tries to create a product
that expresses themselves, pleases their taste (and their friends tastes), and
possibly also to create an existing recipe/style. If a particular brewer
considers the presence of a certain flavor as desirable that others may find
offensive, that is OK. The brewer is suiting their taste.  It has been said that
there are as many styles as there are beers being brewed and in a sense that is
true. But that also makes it impossible to try to impose any objectivity on the
judging process, a process that by its very nature is subjective.  In order to
have any means for comparison that tries to impose some level of objectivity,
the concept of styles has arisen.  This concept is not unique to beer.  Wine has
this concept as well and this concept also serves marketing purposes in that it
can promote (as well as confuse, i.e. Cranberry Lambic sic....) competition by
presenting a brewer's offerings to be in a range of flavor characteristics that
includes that brewers competitors.


Styles exist as a mark by which those seeking competition can judge themselves.
An old friend used to offer up beers to me for my advice on his recipe
concoction.  He would ask me what to do to his recipe. I would ask him what
style he was trying for, or at least in his mind what he wanted the beer to
taste like.  He would get a little irritated since he previously was adamant
about styles not mattering.  I then posed the parable to him that he was like a
lost person asking directions without knowing where he was trying to go.


To finally beat this point to death I'd use a cooking comparison.  If you wanted
to make chocolate chip cookies you'd want a recipe.  While there is variation
among this style of cookie from household to household, and manufacturer to
manufacturer, people can still tell chocolate chip cookies from sugar cookies,
etc.  If you were to set out to make them you'd want some guidelines as to what
the recipe might include and what the final product should taste like.


With regard to beer I think most judges would agree that there are only a few
flavors that would universally be classified as defects.  Most others are
characteristic flavors which may or may not be suitable for style.  


I hope this explains a little more about style and judging.

I beg to differ.  From my experience in wine making and my limited
qualities as a wine connoisseur I believe that what is commonly referred
to as "breathing" has nothing to do with oxidation.  Usually when you
pour a red wine from the bottle (i.e. decant it) you don't drink it
immediately.  Instead, you let it `breath' in a caraffe for some time
(half an hour to one hour or so).  The rationale is to let it develop
its bouquet.  Some volatile substances in the wine evaporate and
saturate the air immediately above the wine (that's also, by the way,
one of the reasons why you should serve red wine in big, wide glasses;
so as to retain the `aromatic air', i,e, the bouquet).  There is no
oxidation involved (to my knowledge).  That would take much longer.


There is a commonly recognized off-taste in wine which is caused by
oxidation.  Usually everyone strives hard to avoid it.


On the other hand, there is also a specific category of wines which get
their distinctive flavor from this particular oxidation off-taste:
Sherry.  One goes through great pains to ensure that Sherry wines get
enough air to develop this flavor.  I don't know that this is known as
`brething'.

You could say this tubing is too long; on the other hand, it is equally
accurate to say your flow rate is too low.  Increasing the flow rate
would result in cooler water coming out, and more (quicker) cooling of
the wort. Also, this tubing may be too long during the initial stages
of cooling, when cooling is very efficient due to the high temerature
differential, but it may still be inadequate during the latter stages
of cooling, when the temperature differential is much lower.  How long
does it take you to cool your wort?

Trained as a chemical engineer, I can affirm that the calculations
involved here are indeed complex, involving not only aspects of the
flow inside the tubing (water temp, flow rate, tube diameter, thickness
and age of the tube, etc.) but also effects _outside_ the tube, in your
pot (geometry of the coil, pot, amount of stirring, etc.).  It would be
very difficult to come up with a formula that takes all of these
factors into account for the wide variety of setups that HB'ers use.
(Of course, having said this, some upstart will soon do just that, if
only to make me look foolish :) ).


As an aside, try this: when your cooling water outflow begins to drop
in temperature, try gently stirring the hot wort.  The temperature of
the outflow water should immediately shoot back up to almost boiling!
This indicates the effect of pot convection/stirring on the heat
transfer rate.


My own cooler is about 30 feet of 3/8" copper tubing, wrapped in a 12"
(?) diameter coil. I connect this to my house cold water line, and can
force enough cold water through it to keep the outflow warm (as oposed
to John's boiling hot). Thus, with my combination of tubing and water,
30 feet is not too long, and I can cool my wort to 65F in about 15
minutes.


So, the length of tubing you will need depends on, among other things,
your cooling water temperature and flow rate, and just how fast you
need to cool your wort.
