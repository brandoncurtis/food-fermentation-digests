Subject: Bottle Sources


Dan deRegnier asked for sources for bottles, which has been a common
request.


The usual source is from beer distributors.  I've gotten cases of
returnable beer bottles (longnecks) for little more than the cost of the
deposit (and an occasional promise to bring them a sample of the
resulting beer).  That kept me in beer bottles for several years, but I
was still having problems finding wine or champagne bottles.


For the last few years, though, I've done my bottle shopping at the local
recycling center.  I don't know if you have any in your area, but there's
a recycling center near me (near the University of Maryland, for anyone
local) that accepts aluminum, paper, some plastics, tin cans, and (the
most important for me) glass, separated into clear, green and brown 55
gallon drums.


While everyone else was depositing their stuff, I'd be withdrawing.  You
want to talk about some strange looks.  I'm one of the few people who
leave with more stuff than I brought.  I have to weed through a lot of
junk, but there are some fascinating bottles there.


It's the best recycling I can think of.

Subject: Chiller Study?


In HBD #1115, Tom Leith has a *great idea* for collecting data for an
empirical chiller design study.  Does anyone have the time and stats pack
to do the regression analysis?  I know the theory, but don't have much
practical experience or time, since my job is being shut down in June due
to budget cuts.... [Our motto: "Leading the Way in Deficit Reduction."]


Anyway, Thanks to Mike Hall, {hi Mike} the necessary parameters are:


tubing length, ID & OD, flow rate (may I suggest seconds needed to
fill a 5 gal. carboy), water in/out temps (actually in temp
would be sufficient, but will increase the number of data points needed),
final temp of wort and time to reach that temp, wort stirred or not (Y/N). 
Additional temp readings at various times of water out and wort will speed
the process and reduce the number of data sets needed. 


All the other things are more or less equal for all of us:  wort SG
doesn't alter specific heats much,  water pressure is difficult to measure
and flow rate is really what counts.  Copper tubing is pretty standard in
terms of wall thickness and conductivity.  A yes/no datapoint should be
sufficient on stirring, since it will be hard to standardize measuring
stir rates.  I heartily reccomend stirring anyway, since wort is a very
poor conductor of heat and the delta_t around the chiller doesn't generate
very strong convection.


There's a Nobel prize (or at least a lot of HBD fame and gratitude) here for
someone who wants to do the work.  It will probably take a month or more
to get an adequate number of data sets....

 Subject: Re: why blowoff? dryhopping
 
 >Gerald asks, why use the blowoff method?
 
 >It's merits have been argued in the HBD, but I believe it makes the
 beer taste better, so I continue to use it.  Papazian says that
 the kraeusen contains fusel oils (I've seen fusel alcohols elsewhere)
 which some say contribute to hangovers.  The most graphic proof I have
 for using the blowoff method is to challenge anyone to drink a glass
 of blowoff.  YUK!  Just sniffing it is enough to guarantee my continued
 support of this procedure.
 
 >The arguments against using the blowoff method (just to be fair) are that
 you lose beer and that you lose some of the bittering you just but in
 with the hops.
 
 
 The above arguments seem to be based on only two possibilites:
 
      1.     Blow-off
      2.     Do Nothing
 
 Based on this, it would seem that blow-off is the preferred method.
 
 The third possibility is to ferment in an "open" container and skim the
 bitter crud floating among the foam.  
 
 I put "open" in quotes because by this, hombrewers mean a large container 
 with an opening large enough to get in to skim and a lid to keep out 
 contaminants while fermenting.
 
 This usually is the "standard  7 gal plastic fermenter universally available 
 in retail shops.  In my case, I use my 10 gal ss mash kettle for a fermenter.
 
 So, once we agree (ha ha) on the need to get rid of the crud, the discussion 
 becomes...  skimming vs. blowoff.
 
 As Al mentioned, little or no beer is lost by skimming.  I wait till the foam 
 is just about gone and only skim the brown crud that floats because that is 
 what is bitter. The foam is just wort puffed up with CO2 and it turns back 
 into wort when the fermentation subsides.
 
 On the negative side is the risk of contamination every time the fermenter is 
 opened to skim but reasonable precautions can reduce this to the noise level.
 
 I don't think anyone will argue about the ease of cleaning an open fermenter 
 vs. a carboy and associated tubing.

 >If you use pellets, you can put a copper scrubbing pad over the end of
 the siphon hose followed by a mesh bag (this idea was originally introduced
 by Al Taylor (I think it was Taylor...) and then independently by Kinney
 Baughman).
 
 First of all, whatever happened to Kinney?  I still see his ads but he has 
 not posted here for months.  I am sure it is just a coincidence but it seems 
 that he vanished about the time Jay Hirsh started his censored, politically 
 cleansed, alternative forum.
 
 Well,  anyway the pot scrubber is a nifty idea but in a recent experiment 
 with dry hopping, I found a new use for the easy masher.   It just so happens 
 (ha ha) that the ID of the strainer tube is 3/8" and fits snugly over the end 
 of the "standard" siphon tube.  You can slide it up or down to expose as much 
 or as little of the strainer as you like and keep it whatever distance off 
 the bottom you wish.
 
 BTW, the experiment was intersting in that I prefer the normally hopped beer 
 to the dry hopped but the gang at CBS has exactly the opposite view.  Guess I 
 will abandon all plans to become the World's Greatest Beer Judge.  Not liking 
 hops could be considered a restrictive bias.

Subject: Hop Alpha Acid rating


A fellow brewer and I were talking about ingredients recently and made the
following observation:
The European hops we have been getting pellets and plugs have been steadily
declining in Alpha Acid rating each year.  My current Saaz pellets are 2.1%
What is the cause of this.  Is it due to economics, fixed supply of hops
going into an expanding market and homebrewers getting what mega brewers do
not purchase.  Or is it that that the hops actually are becoming less acidic.
Or are have the measurement methods changed.  Is it cyclic or seasonal.
Reviewing the original Papazian CJHB and its list of hops and alpha acid
ratings what I am getting now are almost 50% less than listed then.

I suspect that you have roused the yeast which may have indeed caused a
little bit more fermentation or perhaps simply provided nucleation sites
for dissolved CO2 to form bubbles and come out of solution.  A day is much
too short a time for a wild yeast or bacteria to begin releasing any gas.

Subject: Are bottles, just bottles?  PLUS: Question for Charlie Papazian


Dan writes:
>Next, what is the best source for bottles?  Are bottles bottles, or
>are some better than others?  Should I stay away from bottles all
>together?


The best bottles, in my opinion, are, what we call here, "bar bottles."
They are the thick, brown longnecks that require a deposit and are often
so scratched up you can't see through them.  You can really mishandle
these bottles and still not break them.  On the down-side, they do tend
to have chipped-up lips (which can result in a bad seal) and are pretty
ugly.  I've heard that they are as scarce as hen's teeth in the West.
Around here, several small, old Wisconsin breweries, such as Huber, use
them as well as AB, Miller and Heileman's.  Go find a bar that uses them
or a big liquor store that stocks beer in them -- you can buy them for
the deposit and you get a nice waxed cardboard case free!


The reason I say these bottles are the best is because they are
competition-ready... you can use them for competitions.  Besides having
no raised lettering, I would be willing to bet that of all the broken
bottles that arrive at competitions, less than 1% are "bar bottles"
just because they are so durable.


My two other favorite bottles are much harder to get: Orval and the *old*
Whitbread (and Mackeson's) bottles.  Alas, they have raised lettering so
are not usable for AHA-sanctioned competitions.  They are really thick,
brown glass and usually are not re-used by the breweries so they are in
much better shape than "bar bottles."


The general rule is the thicker the glass and the darker brown they are,
the better the bottle.  Also, if you have your choice, you might as well
get bottles that are usable for competitions.  I need to make sure that
I have enough competition bottles of each batch.  It would be a shame to
have best beer ever just at its peak, right in time for the Nationals
and then find out you've only got Bass, Youngs, Fullers and Orval bottles
left.  Oh yeah... generally, only (approximately) 12 ounce bottles are
acceptable for competitions, so don't bottle the whole batch in Weiss,
Xingu and other jumbo bottles if you plan to enter some competitions.
Actually, if you only want comments on your beer, any bottle will do --
it will be judged, but will probably be disqualified if it doesn't
meet the bottle requirements.


Now, I have a question for Charlie: "What about the bottles that have
raised glass codes or "NO DEPOSIT" on the bottom edge of the bottle,
like McEwan's Scotch Ale or Samuel(tm) Adams(tm) Boston(tm) Lager(tm)?"
Last year, at the 1st round judging, we were told to accept such bottles
and disqualify only bottles with raised brand names such as "Bass,"
"FULLERS" and "ORVAL." I complied, but feared that the 2nd-round Nationals
may be more demanding on bottle requirements.  What's the official word?

You could have excellent sanitation and study yeast or just good luck.


>Is there any advantage to rehydrating the dry yeast?  Is there any
>disadvantage to tossing the dry stuff directly into the primary?


 From Paul Farnsworth's article in the Yeast Special Issue of Zymurgy:
        "The latest data from Intek, an Australian dried-yeast producer
        who is just entering the U.S. market, are as follows:  Rehydrate
        the dried yeast in one-half cup of water.  Clean water between
        95 degrees F and 104 degrees F (35 and 40 degrees C) should be
        used.  City water supplies containing high concentrations of
        chlorine will inactivate dried yeast during rehydration.  Chorine
        can be removed [and any live bacteria killed - Al] by boiling.
        Cold water will significantly decrease the viability of dried
        yeast during rehydration.  It is advisable to not rehydrate yeast
        in wort because compounds extracted from hops are antiseptic and
        can decrease yeast viability while the yeast is being rehydrated."


Also, the Lallemand Newsletter has very similar recommendations (alas,
I don't have it here to quote), but mention that the osomtic pressure 
difference rehydrating in wort can cause the yeast to produce off-flavors
when it later switches to fermentation.


I have a personal experience with a two three-quarter-gallon test batches
using Lallemand Nottingham yeast.  The 1048 wort was cooled to 80F, aerated
and the yeast was pitched.  In batch 1, the dry yeast was simply
sprinkled on top of the wort.  In batch 2, the dry yeast was rehydrated
in 104F water for 15 minutes and then pitched.  Both batches were kept
in a 65F room.  Batch 2 was actively fermenting in about 8 hours, whereas
Batch 1 took over 72 hours to begin fermentation.  Fermentation in Batch 2
appeared normal and healthy and was complete in about 5 days, whereas the
fermentation of Batch 1 was sluggish and took much longer.


Time and other projects prevented me from completing this experiment, i.e.
taking FG readings and tasting (in fact Batch 1 is still sitting there in my
fermentation room between pseudo-Kriek#2 and pseudo-Gueuze#1), but the
importance of rehydration was clearly shown.

Which Way Will my Bathtub Drain?            updated 11-May-1192 by SIC
- --------------------------------            original by Matthew R. Feinstein


Question: Does my bathtub drain differently depending on whether I live
          in the northern or southern hemisphere?


Answer: No.  There is a real effect, but it is far too small to be
        relevant when you pull the plug in your bathtub.


Because the earth rotates, a fluid that flows along the earth's surface
feels a "Coriolis" acceleration perpendicular to its velocity.  In the
northern hemisphere high pressure storm systems spin clockwise.  In the
southern hemisphere, they spin counterclockwise because the direction
of the Coriolis acceleration is reversed.  This effect leads to the
speculation that the bathtub vortex that you see when you pull the plug
from the drain spins one way in the north and the other way in the
south.


But this acceleration is VERY weak for bathtub-scale fluid motions.
The order of magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration can be estimated
from size of the "Rossby number".  Coriolis accelerations are
significant when the Rossby number is SMALL.


So, suppose we want a Rossby number of 0.1 and a bathtub-vortex length
scale of 0.1 meter.  Since the earth's rotation rate is about
10^(-4)/second, the fluid velocity should be less than or equal to
2*10^(-6) meters/second.  This is a very small velocity.  How small is
it?  Well, we can take the analysis a step further and calculate
another, more famous dimensionless parameter, the Reynolds number.


The Reynolds number is = L*U*density/viscosity


Assuming that physicists bathe in hot water the viscosity will be about
0.005 poise and the density will be about 1.0, so the Reynolds Number
is about 4*10^(-2).


Now, life at low Reynolds numbers is different from life at high
Reynolds numbers.  In particular, at low Reynolds numbers, fluid
physics is dominated by friction and diffusion, rather than by inertia:
the time it would take for a particle of fluid to move a significant
distance due to an acceleration is greater than the time it takes for
the particle to break up due to diffusion.


Therefore the effect of the Coriolis acceleration on your bathtub
vortex is SMALL.  To detect its effect on your bathtub, you would have
to get out and wait until the motion in the water is far less than one
rotation per day.  This would require removing thermal currents,
vibration, and any other sources of noise.  Under such conditions,
never occurring in the typical home, you WOULD see an effect.  To see
what trouble it takes to actually see the effect, see the reference
below.  Experiments have been done in both the northern and southern
hemispheres to verify that under carefully controlled conditions,
bathtubs drain in opposite directions due to the Coriolis acceleration
from the Earth's rotation.


The same effect has been accused of responsibility for the direction
water circulates when you flush a toilet.  This is surely nonsense.  In
this case, the water rotates in the direction which the pipe points
which carries the water from the tank to the bowl.

Hi Brewers,


Georgia Governor Zell Miller signed a bill yesterday making it legal

to the hot water vessel.  The pump has a max flow rate of 5 gals. a 
minute but I have built a pump speed control.  I will keep the temp. of 
the hot water vessel at 80 degree C. . My mash tun is a converted 15 
gal. keg that has 6 inches of that spray in foam around it and my wort 
boiler is a 15 gal. converted keg also with a hop back.


1.) So what size and what length should I use to get a 1 degree C. rise 
in temp. ?


2.) What should I use to seal the lid of the fermentor down to keep the 
air out ?

Yes and No.  Yes: the coriolis force does exist and is in the direction you
indicate.  No:  the size of this force is negligible compared to the other 
forces acting during the process, e.g. the forces you exert by swirling the
carboy, and the viscous and frictional forces of the water and carboy.  I
have not done a calculation, but I would bet the coriolis force is even 
smaller than the surface tension of the water.


My $0.02:  whether you get a better vortex CW or CCW will most strongly
depend on whether you are right handed or left handed.


Also (I hate to quibble, but...) it is the CENTRIFUGAL acceleration 
(not coriolis) that forces the liquid to the outside when it is rotating.

With all the frothing that the hop pellets cause in the secondary I would
think that all the air would have been purged out and the beer was sitting
under a layer of CO2.  This being the case, what's wrong with causing some
splashing as long as the airlock is left on?

"Fusel oil" is the oily byproduct of ethanol distillation consisting
of mainly long-chain alcohols: propanols, butanols, etc.  The terms
"fusels," "fusel oils" and "fusel alcohols" are synonomous so far
as I know.  I don't know whether the term applies to aromatic as well
as aliphatic alcohols; since I don't hear phenols grouped in with
fusels, I assume that it doesn't.


Fusel alcohols are an important flavor component. The shorter ones have
medicinal/disinfectant flavors (e.g. isopropyl). The longer ones are
pungent and have a kind of fruity-citrusy-medicinal character that
is unmistakable. I've had quite a few homebrewed pale ales where the
octanol (orange-sweet-medicinal) was quite prominent. 


In fact, the last Liberty Ale I drank smelled and tasted strongly
of octanol or something similar.  I was a bit surprised by it and
intend to try another bottle from a separate source, since I consider
it a defect. The last bottle of Liberty Ale I had was a few years
and quite a bit of palate training back, so I don't remember what
it used to be like.


A professional brewer who was drinking with me (at the Brickskellar)
at the time said that it seemed "old."  I'm not so sure; I've never
seen beer change in flavor this way in a bottle.  (Anyone care to
comment on the Liberty Ale profile?)


Some people claim fusels contribute a "clinging bitterness" to beer.
Bitter though they may be, they are so pungent that the flavor of
the beer will be negatively affected long before the finish, at least
in my opinion.


As far as hangovers go, long chain alcohols may well be a factor.
They become increasingly toxic and intoxicating as the chain of carbons 
grows, to a point, anyway. Many many other fermentation byproducts
are also mildly toxic.  I would bet that the aldehydes,
ketones and esters contribute unpleasant metabolic byproducts.


Finally, fusel alcohols are quite soluble in alcohol, and can not
be removed by blowoff.  The unpleasant substances in blowoff residue
are tannins, unisomerized hop resins, etc. They are largely insoluble,
even in a weak alcohol solution, and are not going to be a primary
source of bitterness or astringency in your beer once it has cleared.

Subject: malt extract for priming;  exploding bottles




I'm a beginning extract brewer,  and would appreciate any comments
on a couple of questions about bottle conditioning...


(1) On my first (and so far,  only)  batch of beer (a brown ale),  I
used 1.25 cups of malt extract for priming instead of 0.75 cups of corn
sugar.  Papazian mentions parenthetically that this can be done,  and I
thought,  why add sugar to my beer?  I was happy with the results...
does anyone know why corn sugar seems to be the standard method?


(2) I had a bottle explode while I was out of the house (4 weeks after
bottling).  What would be a common reason for this?  I wonder if I left
too little air-space,  or whether it might have to do with using malt
extract for priming.

 If I read your note correctly, you've been using hopped extract kits and
 boiling away. A long boil will indeed destroy any hop aroma that was in the
 beer. You can still use hopped extract kits, but make sure you add some flavor
 hops in the last 20 min of the boil and/or aroma hops in the last 5 min. Keep
 in mind that there are styles that do not typically have appreciable hop aroma
 or flavor--like stouts and most german lagers.


 If you want to add bitterness, see if you can find pre-isomerized hop extract.
 This is essentially what you get when you boil hops for bitterness. Keeping in
 mind that your beer probably already has some bitterness, follow the
 directions for adding LESS than the full amount. This stuff is concentrated
 and a little goes a long way. Remember, you can always add more. It will also
 add some hop flavor. You could add it to the secondary or to a malt extract
 primer at bottling time.


 If you want some hop flavor or aroma, there are two things you can do. (1) Dry
 hop with pellets if you have no head space in your secondary or use leaf if
 you have room. (2) Add hops when you bottle using the "coffee-pot method."This
 was discussed on HBD a couple months ago.

In wines, tannins are very important to the the aging of wine, but do
produce a somewhat undesirable taste.  I am pretty sure that the
`Breathing' period is so the oxygen can react with the tanins and sort
of `surround' them to mellow their taste.


I do agree however that oxidation of whine before it gets to the bottle
and ages is a bad thing...


I hope I'm not way off on this...

I have found that the best vortex drains are formed when you swirl the bottle

northern hemisphere of our spaceship earth).  The reason is the coriolis
acceleration vector caused by the counterclockwise rotation of the earth.
When you rotate the bottle in the same direction as the earth rotation
the coriolis acceleration vectors constructively add, forming a greater 
force on the liquid molecules.

A couple of terms spring to mind here...."unmeasurable", "negligable", and
"insignificant" spring to mind.


The amount of force you are imparting into the molecules is, I would guess,
on the order of thousands or millions of times stronger than that of
the coriolis effect.  Yes it exists, yes it is measurable, but your swirling
a carboy full of water gives you a heck of a lot more force than the earth's
rotation, neutrino bombardment, specific gravity of your tap water, or the
color of the paint in your kitchen.

About wort chiller length (oh no, not more!).....


I've got a 50 foot, 3'8" chiller I made, by wrapping it around a 5-gallon
bucket, then laced up the sides in 3 places with copper wiring wire.  It chills
the wort to pitching temperature in a rather rapid time (guessing 15 minutes,
I can look at my records to tell you for sure).  The water comes out boiling
(steam, actually) for a few seconds, then comes out progressively cooler.
Stirring with a sanitized spoon speeds up the heat transfer, and the lacing
keeps the coils far apart enough so that the wort can circulate pretty freely.


I, personally, can't see any benefit to a shorter length, at all.  You want to
give the water as much opportunity to absorb the heat of the wort.  I would
think the following are involved:


>Coil surface area (not mass, as someone else mentioned???)
>flow rate of water passing through coil
>temperature differential between wort & water.  


So, let's try this:  We bring our cold water into the hot wort.  Should we
bring it in the top, or bottom?  The wort is probably warmer at the top, so we
should put the cold water in at the top so the temperature differential is
highest, or maybe not.  Any ideas?


Now, how about flow rate?  Slower flow would give the water more time to absorb
the heat, but I think the extra length does the same.  I dunno, I'm asking.
I suppose you could adjust the flow from the faucet for maximum outlet temp
in your chilling water, which would indicate maximum heat transfer.  It will
change as the temperature delta changes, however, I THINK.


What about tubing diameter?  Surface area goes up, flow rate goes up, but
restriction, and therefore time in the chiller, goes down.  Where is the
optimal point, extrapolated across all temperature differentials?


There are probably a thousand more variables.  I like the idea that someone
proposed here, to do an impirical study of what we are using, and decide
which coil construction works best.  I propose we look at the following
variables:


1> water going in at top or bottom of chiller coil
1A> Coil rotation direction (for the hell of it, can't think of an effect
but who knows...maybe a coriolis thing after all!)
2> diameter of tubing & length of tubing
3> flow rate used (how long to fill a quart bottle from the outlet of the
chiller coil?)
4> temperature of your tap water (just for reference, not really something
you can change all that easily)
5> amount of time to chill the wort to, say, 75 degrees F.


Can't think of anything else to measure offhand, any ideas?  Someone else
mentioned they'd tabulate results, I'd be willing to do so also or help.
Of course, it would mean that we'd all have to brew a batch of homebrew to
tabulate the results....sorry for the inconvenience ;-)))

Umm, yeah, I have taken a tour.  Most of the info was published in a 
Zymurgy article about 3 years ago.  (Sorry I can't tell you the issue 
right off hand, my collection is at home.)


But to answer your question, a tour of nearly any of the German 
breweries would do, since they almost all practice decoction mashing.  
The usual arrangement is a 4 vessel brewhouse:  a mash tun 
(maischebottich), mash cooker (maischepfanne), lauter tun 
(lauterbottich), and a kettle (wuerzepfanne).  The process involves 
doughing in in the mash tun, and then pumping from a bottom outlet to 
the mash cooker the decoct.  That's how a "thick mash" is obtained for 
boiling.  This decoct is eventually returned to the "rest mash" to 
raise the whole to the next temperature plateau.  When the decoction 
mash is finish, this outlet is used again to pump the entire mash to 
the lauter tun.  During lautering, the bed will compact, and lautering 
is stopped while an arrangement of "mash knives" is run around the tun 
to loosen the bed.  When lautering is complete, the knives can be 
turned sideways to form a moving wall, and this pushes the spent grist 
into an outlet that leads to a holding tank or a farmers truck.  A 
final wash is required, of course, to get the last recalcitrant husks to leave.


The reason for a 4 vessel system, rather than a two vessel system 
(kettle and lauter tun) is that the commercial breweries can get a 
significant overlap of successive batches on the equipment.  This is 
important if your mash and boil process takes 11 hours to complete and 
you want to make more than a million barrels of beer each year, as it 
does at Pilsner Urquell.
