Subject: Bully Porter




I recently had the opportunity to have some Boulevard Brewing (Kansas City) 
Bully Porter delivered to me (thanks Ken.)  In response to a recent review,
I decided to see if the metallic taste John Fitzgerald found was evident in
this six pack.  The review follows but to sum it up.  I tasted no metallic
taste.  Very Clean.  Anyone know what yeast they use?


Bully Porter from Boulevard Brewing
- -----------------------------------


Aroma:  Roasted Barley or Black Patent
        Hints of Chocolate Malt
        No hop aroma


Flavor: Hops not identifiable
        Dry Finish


Color:        A bit dark but would fit the Robust
        Porter style (AHA).


Carbonation: Appropriate


Body:         A little thin for the style. (American or English)


Overall: AHA "Robust Porter" w/o the body.
         It is a bit too dry to be a porter, it resembles
         a dry stout with some of the roasted barley removed
         and the body taken away.
         Not an English Porter, it lacks the complexity and
         "fruitiness."
         An American Porter (though not smooth like Anchor.)
         A nice drinkable beer overall. (I like dry stouts.)


Notes:        Expiration Notch on the Label (May)
        There was no metallic taste as John Fitzgerald reported.
        Many thanks to Ken Schmidt for delivering from Kansas City
          to the Alabama beer wasteland.

Please remove me from the homebrew list. I'm changing jobs and
no longer will have net access. Thanks for running the list.
Great service.

Any one with Costco access that is in the market for a propane driven burner,
come on down! $48.00 for the 3' high 120,000 btu stand with regulator. You even
get a pot which you can use for heating water (its aluminum). Looks like a good
deal. It might require some modification to support a sawn-off keg.

Subject: Wort Pots


What is this fascination for using stainless steel pots to boil wort in?
It seems obvious to me that the way to save about $100 on a boiling pot is
to pick up a brand new enamled steel canning pot.  I've seen them for around
$30.

Subject: Brewing Partners


Rob Bradley asks if the hbd is a suitable place to seek brewing partners.  I
can't think of a better place.  Your plans to use it to "keep up the variety"
are quite good, too.  I live in Longmont, CO and the idea of a brewing
partner for those all-grain batches is a good one.  I'd bet my wife would
like it too, if it got me out of the kitchen faster.  Any takers?


Cheers,
Norm

Subject: direction of hop vine climb


I am growing three kinds of hops in my Southern California backyard,
and they are all doing the same thing: climbing the stake *clockwise*.


I have planted my hops, initially, in planters, and this is their first
year. The pots are dead center in my yard. I put a stake by each plant,
and let the plant figure out which way it wanted to climb, rather than
trying to train it. They all found the stake, and they all climbed it
the same way.


So, I'd have to say that training them to go up a stake
counterclockwise might be a challenge. Two points of reference: These
are Cascase, Willamette and Nugget, with the Nugget being the real
eager beavers; and the viewpoint for observing the direction of wrap on
the stake is looking down from the top of it.

Just a small correction to my last post, which announced that THREAD v2.1 was 
available for download via anonymous ftp from sierra.stanford.edu.  The 
actual directory that thread is located in is "pub/homebrew/programs/thread", 
not "pub/homebrew" as I indicated in the post.  The portable C version of the
old (v1.2) THREAD source code will also be available in this directory.


   Any comments, questions, or suggestions can be sent to me at the email 
address below.
