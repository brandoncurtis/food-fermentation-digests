Subject: Foam and kegging problem


hi,
I finally got a good price on a 50L keg equipped with gauges and tubing and a 
16 Lb CO2 tank...Ok.great I thought. but being a bit naive about this I
just forged ahead.  I brewed up 23 L of my favourite pilsner to try it out.
I racked it over to a secondary , clarified and siphoned into the keg after
about 18 days.  I pressurized to 50psi (at room temp).. let sit overnight..
(it went down to about 30 psi) after 16-18hours.  I decided to see what it
tasted/looked like the next day.  Ugh.. most foam and very little carbonation.
Ok.. I dropped the pressure to about 10 psi.. and kept this head pressure with
the CO2.. same thing.. hmm.. maybe chill it.. Dropped the tank in my laundry tub
and filled it with ice.:result not much better.. ALthough drinkable, There
was a GREAT deal of foam.. and little carbonation. (very small bubble).
Well I persevered and just filled pitchers with it.. drank it that way.
 Ok. I'm checking with some friends who have more experience to see what I
did wrong. but I appreciate any comments from experienced keggers.
The keg is 50L stainless with 1/4" copper tubbing dip tube and 1/4" 
"tapping tube, both silver soldered into a stainless steel plug in the top of
the keg.
Any help.. or tell me what I did wrong?.  I'm dying to have my first keg party.

Subject: Fascination with Stainless


Either stainless steel or enameled steel can be used satisfactorily for
brewing. Aluminum is the big no-no.


The reason for prefering stainless is simple durability. If you ding an
enameled pot, the enamel chips off, and if that happens on the inside,
the required thorough cleaning becomes impossible. Enameled steel also
weighs quite a bit more than stainless, adding to the already
considerable weight of five gallons of (hot) wort.

 My guess is that this would word about as well as an evaporation type air

 For this to work at all, requires very low humidity ala Arizona.

        So you are using N2O instead of C02?  Do you get
        better (smoother) head in your beers than with
        C02?  I think I'll start kegging my beer too, and

Subject: Easy Yeast Culturing 2




I wanted to follow up the compilation of responses to Easy Yeast Culturing
with my own experience.


I followed Rick's method with my latest batch, a dopplebock.  I made the
1/2 gallon "mother" starter, and bottled 5 12 oz bottles.  Stored them in the
fridge for three days.  Next, I took one out, let it warm to room temp, then
pitched it into about a pint of 1.020-1.030 wort.  This I used as  starter for
my brew.  I let this starter ferment for a couple of days.  On brewing day
I poured off some of the "beer" sitting atop the yeast cake in the starter
(tasted ok, seemed to have high levels of diacytl), swirled the remaining
beer  to stir up the yeast, and pitched into the wort.


12 hours later I had a FABULOUS krausen going.  One of the fastest starts I
have ever seen.  Fermentation looked like it was almost done in about 36
hours.  


I have not tasted it yet, but so far I am quite impressed.  I am bottling 
this weekend, so I'll taste it then.


Just wanted to post a data point that this method does indeed result in
viable yeast (one of my fears as I started).  I will post more data as
I collect it.  So far, though, so good.

Why wouldn't it be possible to boil the wort down to a smaller
quantity and then add a gallon of ice?  The ice can be made a 
day in advance by putting boiled water in a sterilized refillable
gallon container from a super market.


As for the optimum design for an immersion cooler:  usually good
ideas can be obtained by looking at designs which have withstood
the test of time.  In this case the car radiator seems go be a 
good model.  If it were possible to obtain one without lead
sodder then it might work well...

  Just so it's clear that we agree, yes, hops will climb "clockwise
*looking down*".  The Hops Primer states it as "counter-clockwise *looking
up*".  The reason for that orientation is that "up" is the direction of
growth, ie. imagine that you're a hops plant....

 Being new to homebrewing (since January, ~ 7 batches), I have a
 coupla questions:


 (1) I've noticed that several of the bartches dont have much head.
 I've seen the comments about spotlessly clean glassware, etc. I seem
 to notice a trend I'd like comments on: The batches i've done that
 had brewers sugar (or honey) seem to have a good head, the no-sugar
 batches seem to lack a good head. Anyone else observed this? Ideas
 why?


 (2) Where can I get some hop plants?


 (3) Can someone email me (or send me the ftp location for) the yeast
 culturing notes that were (apparently) posted here not too long back?


 Please email me directly, I'll summarize to the list in a few days to

From: gjfix`at`utamat.uta.edu (George J Fix)
Subject: Competitions and Dry Yeast


I have been entering a lot of competitions primarily with high
gravity amber and dark lagers. The objective has been to get a measure
of the new Belgian malts. A summary of our findings plus a general
analysis of these malts can be found in an article I wrote for the first
issue of Brewing Techniques. This issue should appear at the beginning
of May. Our own cultured lager yeast was used for all these brews. 


I have also made full scale brews with the dry yeast that was sent to us
from Crosby and Baker, and these were also entered in sactioned competitions.
In each case, the following "German Wheat Ale" was used:


       Vol. = 50 liters
       Grain Bill - 7.5 kg. D-C pale ale malt, 2.5 kg. D-C wheat malt
       (SG = 1.048)
       60 grams Hallentau leaf hops, 60 grams Tettnang leaf hops
       (IBU = 26 mg/l)


This is a mild flavored beer, and was chosen for that reason. Any defects
in the yeast used would stick out like a sore thumb in this one. The Belgian
grains were used to remove malt quality as a issue.


Beer using the Mauri yeast from Australia that was sent to me by C+B was
entered in the 3rd Annual March Mashfest in Ft. Collins, Co. The judges were 
Skip Madsen and John Landreman. Both are in the "recognized judge" category.
One gave a score of 41 and the other 39. The beer took first place in the
its category. I would be willing to bet that this beer was eliminated early
on in the BOS judging. This strain IMHO is not capable of producing beers
that can compete at that level. Our analysis and the Ft. Collins results
show that this yeast can nevertheless make creditable beer.


Beer made from the new Whitbread strain was entered in the March Pittsburgh
competition, the Bluebonnet, and the recent competition in Chicago. The judges
in the Pittsburgh competition were Cliff Beringer (certified) and Jim Desmond
(apprentice). They gave the Wheat Ale scores of 36 and 37, respectively. It won
a second in this event. The same was true for the Bluebonnet, except the score
sheets have not as yet been sent out. Jim Busch and a few others on this
network also won ribbons. Presumably these and the score sheets will be sent
out soon. I also entered a Brown Ale which took 1st place. This one was
fermented with a cultured yeast (BRY-204, a Belgian ale yeast from Siebel).
I have not seen the official results from Chicago. Al, when will we get this?
I personally prefer the Mauri strain to the new Whitbread, and indeed the
old Whitbread to the new version. The latter can, however, make creditable
beer. Copies of all the relevant score sheets will be sent to C+B where
they will be kept on file with our analytical results.


None of this refutes Mr. O'Connor's assertion that my yeast evalation procedures
are invalid. They are rather simple, but then I am a simple homebrewer and
never claimed to be anything else. Given Mr. O'Conner's depth of understanding
of yeast and related matters I would love to taste some beer he has brewed.
For reasons I do not understand, he has chosen not to participate in Texas
events like the Bluebonnent and Dixie Cup. I have been told that he has
sent samples of his beer to Chicago. They apparently called it "O'Conner's
O-Ring Beer". Does anyone know anything about this?

  I've used this technique several times, it does work well.  I do
have a basement, but it still gets to 75F-78F during the dog days of
July and August.  In addition to putting the carboy in a basin of water
and covering it with a wet towel, I use a small computer fan to 
circulate the air around the carboys.  This keeps the evaporation rate
high enough to cool the carboys the 6-8 degrees or so necessary for
ale fermentation.  The fan itself draws very little current, so it doesn't
cost much to run it 24 hours a day, even at the larcenous rates that
Public Screwing, er, I mean, Service of New Hampshire charges.
  I've also been successful brewing dunkelweizens in warm weather using
Wyeast 3506 Bavarian wheat yeast.  The warmer fermentation temperatures
seem to help this yeast produce more of the clove phenolic that's
desirable in a weizen.

  Sure, throw a party!  I have the same problem, as much as I enjoy

  I built my immersion chiller from 50' of 3/8" OD copper, and like
Al's, about 1/3 of it is not even submerged in a 5 gallon batch.  It too
will cool my wort from boiling to under 70F in 15 minutes.  While this has
been a fascinating thread, with all of the discussion of heat transfer
and convection currents, I confess to being totally unscientific in
the construction of my chiller.
  The copper came in a 50 foot coil, I was too lazy to cut it.  I just
sat down with a pin lock keg, and started wrapping coils.  I left a few
feet on either end for the inlet/outlet, and wrapped some bare 14 gauge
copper wire vertically between the coils to give it some structural
strength.  I did the whole thing in about 30 minutes, it works great, and
never once solved a heat transfer equation.

Bravo!  Nice info on the Hops report, Alan.  I'm more of a
gardener than a private brew master, so this was of great
interest to me.
 
I would like to make a small clarification.


 - The garden is along my North fence, for maximum sun.
 
Alan doesn't state which side of the North fence.  This
information of course, is dependant on what part of the world you
live on.  For most, if not all of the US, the "Southern Exposure"
is what you are striving for.  The side of a fence or house is
nice because it stores and reflects heat/light for sun loving
plants.

Not only will the carboy drain faster with the Rack hose venting air, it will
also fill faster if you are dunking it in a large container, as I do.  I use
a very large cooler to hold by sterilizing water/chlorine mix, and put the
entire carboy in there, with a hose in it. It fills very quickly, whithout
the bubbles and splashes too.

 >What is this fascination for using stainless steel pots to boil wort in?
 It seems obvious to me that the way to save about $100 on a boiling pot is
 to pick up a brand new enamled steel canning pot.  I've seen them for around
 $30.
 
 Let me take a guess.  Your responses will run ten to one about the evils of 
 chipping and how rust and iron will permate your beer and make it 
 undrinkable.
 
 You will also get a few remarks about how the handles break off at the most 
 inconvenient times.
 
 I used one for years for everything from fish boils and maple syrup to beer 
 making and although it was chipped in a number of places including a hole in 
 the lid that actually rusted through, it worked just fine.  Scrubbing off any 
 rust before use seems to be all that is necessary and if you take care of it, 
 there is no reason is should chip.  I was very rough on the pot and deserved 
 every chip it got.
 
 I have never had a problem with the handles on my fossilized kettle but the 
 new ones do creak and crackle when flexed.  I would, under no circumstance, 
 trust them with a full kettle of boiling liquid but they can easily be lifted
 by the outside lip with potholders or gloves.
 
 My first easymasher was installed in such a pot along with a false bottom.
 The false bottom has been abandoned as a dinosaur and the easymasher is now a 
 commercial product.
 
 There are several issues that seem to be limiting the universal acceptance of 
 the em and the most significant seems to be the cost of a large pot and the 
 fact that most people are unaware of the existance of the 33 qt 
 enamel-on-steel canning kettle.  
 
 There also seems to be a very powerful reluctance to drill a hole in a nice 
 new kettle.  I am not sure what drives this paranoia but to buy a kettle for 
 the sole purpose of brewing beer and not go the additional step for the 
 ultimate in convenience seems a bit strange.
 
 Finally, a product does not seem to exist until Zymurgy does a review of it.
 
 Well, one thing led to another and I am now offering the EASYMASHER kit 
 installed in the 33 qt canning kettle, ready to mash, sparge and ferment.
 
 Yes, in spite of all the momilies, they make great primary fermenters IF kept 
 in good condition.

Subject: Whitbread History


Apparently-To: homebrew`at`hpfcmi.fc.hp.com


Here is the recent Whitbread history as I understand it. The original
3 strain culture was produced at an old yeast plant, operated under
license by Whitbread. It was distributed in the US to HB shops and
micros by Siebel. This plant was shut down ~2 years ago as a part
of Whitbread's company wide modernization program. Siebel then had the
yeast sent to another plant in Canada to temporarily produce it there until
Whitbread's new yeast plant went into production. This is where is wild yeast 
infection occurred. It caused quite a scandal in California and Canada, the
regions that apparently got the bulk of the bad yeast. Siebel promptly
dropped distribution of this yeast. A short time later Crosby+Baker contracted
with Whitbread to have some more production runs done at the old plant,
and started distributing it. 


Both versions of Whitbread can be found in homebrew shops, at least this
is the case in the Southwest. The C+B version comes in a 14 gram packet,
while the other version comes in a 12 gram packet. I have tested both,
and the samples were quite acceptable as far as lactics and super-attenuators
are concerned. The yeast in the 12 gram packets are now very old, and
its viability was unacceptable in 2 of the 3 samples tested.


In general, the detection of wild yeast is extremely subtle, however the 
detection of super-attenuators is a piece of cake. One need only inoculate
a sample of the yeast in a sterile dextrin extract and measure metabolic 
activity. As I mentioned in a previous post, the yeast was also checked
with Rodney Morris' incremental actidione test. I have found this procedure
to be very useful in my own personal brewing. If there is anyone out there
who actually brews beer and who has evidence to the contrary, then I would
be glad to exchange both beer and data.


The situation may become more complicated in the next few months. The 
Whitbread yeast that was sent to me from a test batch at their new
plant appears to be quite different from the old mixed culture. First,
I believe it is a pure single strain yeast. Secondly, it tends to give
a soft, slightly woody flavor not unlike Wyeast's London Ale
strain. It is a far cry from the crisp and snappy tartness produced
by the old mixed culture. It, like Wyeast's London Ale yeast, is
exceptionally clean and has >90% viability. Feedback on the new strain
would be welcome by me when it becomes available. The hope is that
it can serve as a beginner's version of the London Ale strain.

Subject: Best British Beers


Fellow Brewers,


Thought I would share with you the contents of an article from the May issue
of _Bon Appetit_.  The article is the "Tasting Panel Report", and for May,
they pick ..."the 10 best British brews available stateside."...


Listed in alphabetical order, with *their* comments:


Bass Pale Ale, England ($1.50/12 Oz).  This world-renowned brew is clean and
bright, with a light color and lively, malty, well-balanced flavors.


MacAndrew's Scotch Ale, Caledonian Brewery, Scotland ($3.00/17 Oz).  A smoky,
spicy ale that is marketed with a lovable Airedale on the label, and the
slogan "Man's Best Friend."  We can't decide whether this refers to the dog
of the ale.


McEwan's Scotch Ale, Scotland ($1.50/12 Oz).  Anthony Dias Blue describes this
dark ale as "dense, sweet and rich, with hints of molasses and fruit."


Newcastle Brown Ale, England ($1.30/12 Oz).  It isn't really so brown, but
this ale does have nice flavors of spice and malt, with a crisp, fresh finish.


Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale, England ($2.50/Pint).  A fine Yorkshire product
that's smokey, toasty, lively and loaded with flavor.


Theakston Old Peculier Yorkshire Ale, England ($1.50/12 Oz).  This brew with
the peculiar spelling of _peculiar_ is lush and toasty, with a great finish.


Thomas Hardy's Ale, Eldridge, Pope & Co., Dorset, England ($3.00/6.33 Oz). 
Named for Dorset's most famous writer, this ale, bottled with its natural
yeast, will improve with age.  Dark and complex, with Porter-like qualities.


Traquair House Ale, Scotland ($5.00/12 Oz).  Yes, it's expensive, but Traquair
was tops with us.  It's made on the estate of a historic Scottish manor house
that was once occupied by Bonnie Prince Charlie.  Angela Freire of _Wine and
Spirits_ magazine finds Traquair "earthy and hoppy".


Welsh Ale, Felinfoel Brewery, Wales ($2.50/Pint).  This brew was a favorite
of the poet Dylan Thomas. It is loaded with attractive spice and is "full and
thick with a nice bitter finish,"  according to one panelist.


Whitbred Traditional Pale Ale, England ($1.00/12 Oz).  Bright, with fresh,
snappy flavors.  "Fine balance and structure," says panel member. Cirilo
Octaviano.


*Listed prices are approximate and may vary from one state to another.*


Gosh, not too descriptive.  By no means am I a qualified judge, but it sounds
to me like the panel doesn't get around to judging beer too often, or at least
they don't use the same language in describing things like you certified folks
out there in HBD land do.


Wish they would have ranked them.

Assuming you live in the northern hemisphere, the sun also travels around
the stake clockwise (clockwisdom being a holdover from sundials). Could
there be a connection? Are the plants following the sunlight?


Or maybe it's the Coriolus effect. :-)

Hi All:
Last year some of our club members and members of another club got together for
several weekends and brewed beer (imagine that) at an outdoor Renaissance Fair.
 These beers were brewed with a three tier gravity/stainless steel keg/propane
burner system.  There were many interested potential homebrewers and the events
were a great success.  The beer was good as well.  This year there are plans to
repeat the performance.   All this got me thinking....why not take a giant leap
backwards in technology?  


Stainless is great at home, but primitive might be fun as well.  I envision not
a ss mash tun, but one made from half of an oak barrel, a large pot (cauldron)
boiled over an open fire.  A single infusion mash using a procedure in which
the grain is doughed in at ambient water temperatures and boiling  (or hot)
water added to reach mash strike.  Draining to the boiler the first runnings
and a second mash possibly with no sparge.  


Well, I am in the process of building such a beast out of a 55 gal used whiskey
barrel, at least as a proof of concept.  Noonan's Scotch ale gives guidelines
for old style brewing ie. second mashing so I have something to start with. I
suppose decoctions are not out of the question either.


Has anyone tried something similar to this that can offer some guidelines?  Can
you think of a better mash tun or boiler?  I'm not sure how to cool this stuff
without entering the 20th century.

 I have had several discussions with people on the net about Chimay
 yeast. I believe I read (in HBD probably) that Chimay yeast is a
 combination of 5 different strains plus some other microflora.  One
 person said that his plate of Chimay yeast had several "different"
 colonies of yeast on it, while another said that his plate looked all
 the same.  I think they got their yeast from bottle dregs, not from
 Wyeast 1214.


 I'm starting to culture my own yeast and am curious about Chimay and
 other Belgian strains.  Is it worth plating out the yeast or do you
 lose other important side strains? I would think that culturing the
 bottle dreg in wort and keep repitching until you get enough yeast
 slurry to pitch would be the way to go. Then keep repitching the
 slurry until there is a noticable difference like one of the side
 strains taking over.  I'm not worrying about it, because I don't have
 a batch in the fermenter, etc. etc., but I am curious. Thanks in
 advance for all the expert advice.

 In a recent HBD, someone asked about using cola to acidify
 the sparge water.  This idea rekindled the one I had about
 using Coca-Cola as an adjunct in making a porter.  So I gave
 it a sample try.  While the labelling didn't indicate that
 there were any preservatives in the mix, there are "natural
 flavors" which, of course, can be preservative in their own
 right.


 My test went like this: measure OG and pH; buffer with
 calcium carbonate to 5.4 or so, pitch yeast and yeast
 nutrient.  The OG was a whopping 1.042! That's a pound of
 sugar (high fructose corn syrup) per gallon. Or a teaspoon
 per ounce.  (Next time you have a can of Coke, think about
 eating 4 tablespoons of sugar. :-b)  The pH was below 4.5,
 probably more like 3 something. Turned my pH paper bright
 yellow. I didn't bother to boil the Coke, but I did
 decarbonate it.  I put 8 oz in a bottle with 1/2 tsp of dried
 ale yeast (rehyd) and a little yeast nutrient.


 The resulting cloudy mixture gave 2 glubs total and then the
 yeast started dropping out of suspension.  The SG didn't
 change much and the taste was terrible and not the least bit
 alcoholic.  Moral: Don't bother with colas or other sodapops.
 They have stuff that will knock out your yeast and don't
 really taste that good.  Blech.

After 6 batches of extract/specialty grain/dry yeast beer, I'm about

I think thye recent thread on Carboy tricks would eliminate the Coreolius effect


I just kegged a Chech Pilsner using the Wyeast Bohemian strain the package was 
mid February, It had no off flavors or aromas.  fermentation was at 45 and 
lagering at 40  and a week at 32 to settle out yeast and proteins.  I would
have to say that the description is different from the result.  It did not 
produce a strong malty flavor.  I have heard other brewers have the same result.

It said it was malt extract used for brewing and baking.  Has instructions

Bright yellow label.


Interestingly enough it was 2.3 pounds or so... at about $4.50.  Detailed
