George Fix asks about Don O'Connor's beer.


I can personally atest to the high quality of Don's (and wife Lynne's)
beers. As to why he doesn't enter competitions, I'll let Don answer that one
but I suspect the beers would fare well.  I'll also give Don a chance to
post the story on the "O-Ring" beer.  It was very interesting and in fact
published in their latest newsletter (St. Patricks of Austin).


"Bob" asks about Premier Malt Products yellow can:


I read somewhere that Premier Malt Products had picked up the license to
distribute the old "Pabst Blue Ribbon" extract.  I think it was in the first
issue of that supposedly funny brew paper out of Michigan.

I've used both Nottingham and Windsor.  As a side note I 
preferred the Windsor.  However, the packages are rather small 
 ... I believe containing approximately only 5 grams.  Since the 
pitching rate is important in terms of the lag time, I have been 
adding two packages of Nottingham for a single batch.  This is still 
less yeast than a single package of Whitbread.  The lag time 
I've experienced, when pitching at 60F is approximately 1 day.  
On lag times like this I occansionly shake the primary until 
notable fermentation kicks in.  IMHO I think this helps reduce 
the lag time.

        Although perhaps impractical as Jack mentions, it does provide 
aesthetics.  To some, good head is part of a fine beer, but heavy 
carbonation may add an acidic tang, and deffinitely makes for a *fizzy* 
product.  By nitrogenating the beer, you get good head without the soda pop 
fizz.  The reason for this is, as Jack discovered, N2 is virtually 
insoluble in water at low pressures, which is why the pressure didn't drop 
in the keg. Ideally the beer in the keg should be naturally carbonated 
(primed like a Real Ale) before being dispensed this way, not force 
carbonated.  Force carbonating defeats the purpose.  The insolubility of 
nitrogen is the reason for the small bubbles, the beer gets "the bends" when  
it comes out of the tap.

I talked with one of Coors' microbiologists last night related to 
Chimay yeast strain quesition.  He studied for his brewing PhD. in 
Belgium so I highly value both his acedemic and professional opinions.


He informed me that Chimay only uses ONE yeast and you can observe this
is your cultures.  Not all trappists styles use a single strain.  His
recommendation was to use Chimay if you wish to culture a trappist

Subject: Belgium Wheat Malt & Biscuit


Hi all,


I like to brew german HefeWeizens using 70% wheat malt, and
following a decoction procedure as described by Eric Warner
in his excellent book on weizens.  The last two batches I
made used DeWolf Cosyns Wheat malt. In both cases, my extract
efficiency was way off.  I used to use Bavarian wheat malt 
and always had great results.  This is a bothersome result,
but it could be due to other factors, notably both of these
batches were produced in my newer brewery and it is possible
that my decoctions are not as before.  I am looking for 
feedback from the digest with respect to yields when using 
this wheat malt.  Email me at busch`at`daacdev1.stx.com


The results are in from my latest celebration clone.  I used 
a small percent of Biscuit in addition to large amounts of 
caramel malts.  The biscuit resulted in an extremely pleasing
light "roasted" character.  It is subtle but evident.  The 
ale is on the dark side of a pale ale, but the complexity and
maltiness/roasted character is blending well with the spiceyness
of Cascade and Centennial hops.  The biscuit malt would seem 
ideal for use in Scotch Ales and other darker ales and even
in small quantities in amber ales.


Good brewing,
jim Busch

Another data point for Easy Yeast Culturing:


I bottled my beer this past weekend.  The Easy Cultured Yeast did a very
nice job.  Dropped the gravity down from 79 to 18 (perfect).  The
dopplebock tastes GREAT! 


This allays one of the fears that I had when I started this experiment, i.e.,
that the yeast would not be viable.  Now I guess the only remaining concern
I have is how long will they remain viable.


I'll keep you posted.

I must applaud Ted Manahan's article in HBD #1129 on the use of drugs,
drinking of alcolholic beverages and the moral soapbox some people get on

I have had many an argument with those who believe it's fine to drink, but
reprehensible to use other drugs.  The laws of biochemistry don't care what
is legal or not.  I simply don't agree with being told what to do for _MY_

views about drinking or drugs on anyone else, but merely point out
hypocrisy when I see it.

Subject: RIMS, vent pipe, and channeling




I am putting together a RIMS system, and have been reviewing designs
and discussions from past HBDs.  I am most interested in the topics
of grain bed compaction and channeling of liquor through the grain
bed.


In HBD #1088, Bob Jones posted concerns about grain bed compaction
in RIMS systems.  He related that he was unable to get a 10 gal.
setup to work properly.  


In HBD #806, Alan Gerhardt posted an article about his RIMS system.
Alan's system included a vent pipe which extended above the grain
bed from the copper pipe manifold on the bottom of the mash/lauter
tun.  I think the use of a vent pipe would go a long way toward
reducing the compaction problem.  Bob, did you try a vent pipe?


Having a pipe going through the grain bed reminded me of a previous
discussion on the HBD about channeling in the grain bed.  A vent pipe
would provide the perfect opportunity for the recirculating liquor
to channel to the bottom of the tun, avoiding the grain bed.


With a RIMS system, channeling during the mash would not be a problem.
I am concerned about channeling during the sparge.  Two methods of
sparging come to mind.  First there is the  conventional method of
"slowly add sparge water while draining off decreasing gravity wort".
The other method would be "dump sparge water in, then recirculate".  


If I used the latter method, I think channeling would become a minor
concern; you could just recirculate longer to overcome the reduced
efficiency due to channeling.  The drawback would be the need for
a tun with enough volume to hold all your grain, mash water and sparge
water.  Your efficiency would also suffer using this method.


I plan to use the former method, but the conventional method is
susceptible to poor efficiency due to channeling around the vent pipe.


What I would like to propose is using a vent pipe, but running it
outside the mash/lauter tun.  I also want to use a manifold above
the grain bed, submersed in the hot liquor, to reduce splashing.

Some of the batches of beer that I've made with Nottingham took some time
to start, but eventually everything worked out alright.  You said that
you followed rehydration methods "by the book."  Well, there has been
some contradictory information on rehydration in the past.  Some descriptions
fail to mention a temperature differential between the "starter" and the wort.
I contend that this is still very important.  You rehydrate the yeast in
plain water between 104F and (I believe) 115F and then let it sit between
15 and 30 minutes, right?  Then you dump this 8 ounce "starter" into 5 gallons
of 65F wort.  This will definately shock the yeast.  What I do with dry
yeasts, is rehydrate them in 104F boiled water and then let them sit for
30 minutes in a covered (with plastic wrap) pyrex measuring cup.  In those
30 minutes, the "starter" has cooled to about 85F.  I then pitch this into
my wort which I have intentionally only cooled to 80F (instead of the usual
70F) and aerated well.  Even with this procedure, one batch took 48 hours to
start.


For Wyeast batches, I warm the package to 70F and then pop the nutrient
pack.  This gets incubated at 70F and then pitched into a 70F starter.
That gets subsequently gets pitched into a 70F wort.  Positive pressure
is obvious in the airlock/blowoff hose after 12 hours and kraeusen is
formed in 24.

Ted writes about alcohol and the "war on drugs."


Theoretically, I feel that it is not the government's job to protect
us from ourselves.  Let's face it... many things that are good in
moderation are bad in excess.  Then there are the things that are
legal although there has been no evidence of any positive effects from
these substances -- case in point: tobacco.  Alcohol can be abused,
but so can model airplane glue and aspirin and caffeine and automobiles
and Whipped-cream propellants and...  Education on the dangers and
*reasonable* warning labels, and then "buyer beware."  That's my position.

I thought it was the 14 gm packages that were the "old variety" and
the 12 gm packages that are the "new variety," but I could have it
backwards.  I didn't particularly like the "black-bread-crust" flavor
of Whitbread Ale and thus chose to use other yeasts instead of Whitbread,
so I don't have any personal experience with it.

I guess I should have left it to the botanists to give the final word.
Everything that I had read had said that the plants were "following the

Dominion Brewing (Ashburn, VA) is a microbrewery located in the flight path
of Dulles Airport, outside Washington, DC


They brew several year-round beers, Dominion Ale, Dominion Lager, Dominion
Stout and perhaps others I've forgotten. They also produce seasonal brews,
the Christmas Ale was excellent, the current a Spring Bock I've yet to taste.


They also produce "house recipe" beers for a growing number of metro-DC area
bars.


They conduct tours on Saturday afternoons, call 703-860-BEER for details.
Last time I went, the president, Jerry Bailey, gave an excellent tour.

Particularly if you're interested in real wheat beers, you should pick
up a copy of Eric Warner's book on German Wheat Beers, published by the
AHA.  Eric's decoction procede is straight-forward and easy enough to
accomplish (particularly on the stove), plus it makes a killer beer.
Greg Noonan's book on Lager Beer contains a much more complicated and
much longer decoction mash.  Judging from my reading in other sources,
Noonan's procedure is unnecessarily complicated given the malts we have
to work with these days and you should be able to use Eric's method for
other beers as well.

There was a time a few years ago when it seemed every brewpub in
California was using Whitbread yeast, either their ale yeast or their
"lager" (which made remarkably ale-like lagers!).  This was apparently
due to the influence of UC Davis' Michael Lewis, who was busy convincing
potential brewpub owners/brewers that anything else was too complicated
and not worth the effort.  The results were pretty spotty, and
convenient or not, the yeast apparently did not respond well to
re-pitching, which meant the brewer had to keep buying more.  I wrote a
report about a trip through the brewpubs back in 1988 or so and singled
out one horrible example in Santa Rosa.  Byron Burch wrote to say that,
ordinarily, the pub turned out very good beer but that they'd had some
real problems with their dry yeast (Whitbread -- and by-now familiar
problems).  The local homebrewers stayed away until the beer was cleaned
up (although why the brewery was serving such awful stuff, I don't
know).


I don't know for sure, but I suspect brewers down there have become a
little more sophisticated in the last few years, and learned that "easy"
is not always the best choice.

Subject: Update to Pub list


The latest additions to my Publist have been made available on the
Homebrew archive at sierra.stanford.edu in the pub/homebrew/docs
directory, thanks to Stephen Hansen.  The file is publist.Z
(compressed with UNIX compress I believe).   Listserver users just need
to say "get homebrew publist".


This list includes brewpubs, pubs, restaurants, and beer (liquor)
stores which have good beer.  There are also some microbreweries,
home-brew shops and the like, but these are not as complete.


The goal of this is to give travelers a reference on where to
find good beers including sources to buy bottles to bring home.


My database which parses and searches this list currently says:
#Done reading in the pub db, Pubdb Version 1.2 July 1, 1991
#Recognized a total of 1417 pubs from 18 countries and 582 cities.
                       ---- (and the like)


I am trying to port the search program over from Sun to a PC,
but don't hold your breath until the C++ class I'm teaching is over.


If you have any information especially about new brewpubs or
beer pubs, brewpub closings, or useful notes/corrections
please send me a message

Steve,


 You can also get the CO2 cartridges used for Seltzer bottles, the kind
that let you make and dispense your own.. I've never actually tried the
sporting goods store route. I've always used the small CO2 carts used for
Seltzer. Should still cost a lot less than Nitrous. They come in a package
quite similar to the Nitrous carts.
 
 The ultimate would be to rig an adapter that goes from the 5L tapper gas
thing to a real CO2 tank with a good regulator. In my experience, those
ggas cartridges leak a lot. I seem to lose 1/2 my gas before I dispense
any beer.


 If I find an adapter, I'll let you know.
