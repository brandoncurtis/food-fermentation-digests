Subject: dmna, sulfur etc


hello all,
Herb wrote about the Maltery trip in hbd 1132.
> on the question of DMNA, it's dimethylnitrosamine, the major
(in terms of amounts and toxicity) nitrosamine found
in beer. It gets there all the way from the malt. More
often than not malts are treated with burning sulfur during
kilning. The effect of this is to decompose the nasties into
nontoxic dimethylamine. A side effect, appart from filling
the atmosphere with sulfur dioxide, is that the malts contain
more sulfur (in the form of sulphates etc) and often the
acidity of the malt is increased.
> as to the hormone used in germination, it's gibberellic (sp)
acid. This is indeed found in nature, in very many seeds and
seedlings. It is what is found in "rooting powder" used by
gardeners to make plant cuttings take root. It isn't in
any way related to mammalian (human) hormones, and has no effect
on the body. (A related hormone is acetylene, this stimulates
the ripening of fruit... try putting a young tomato (green)
in a bag with a little. It'll ripen alot quicker.. but watch 
out for flames otherwise it'll be fried tomato.)


Returning to malting, I tried making caramel malt this
weekend. It turned out quite good, though the real test
will be a full batch of ale brewed with it.
My process was as follows:
steep 1 kg whole lager malt in water for 12 hours (over night)
then drain and put the grains in a covered pyrex dish in
the oven at 65-72 degC for 2 hours. This mashes the insides 
of the fully moistened grains. The temperature is the theoretical
optimum under these (abnormal) conditions.
After this time, the grains could be squeezed between my fingers
releasing the hot(!!!) sweet contents. I didn't do this to all
of them ofcourse, otherwise I'd get no malt.
I then warmed the oven to 120 degC and dried/baked the grains,
being careful to stir regularly, otherwise toffee quickly
formed on the bottom of the dish.
The length of time you leave the grains influences the final
colour, I left mine for 2 hours to give a medium (sorry not
very scientific description) roast.
The insides of these grains is like toffee, though possibly
still a bit wet (sticky).
Any way, that's all I wanted to say,
Rob Thomas.

        My manifold is in a bucket, not the pot.  I do one of three things. 
I can mash in the pot and dump it into the bucket on top of the manifold 
for sparging.  I can put hot water and grain in the bucket on top of the 
manifold and do a single stage infusion mash (ie just let it sit there for 
a while), then sparge.  I can put warm water and grain in the bucket on top 
of the manifold and do a decoction mash.  Some people have tha manifold in 
the pot, but mine is made of PVC, so I don't like the idea of placing it on 
a burner.
        Have fun!

"I haven't been able to find this word in any dictionary.  I have seen
 this word used before.  Could it be that the author really wanted to

I think it's slang. Dunno the etymology or deriviation but it translates,
roughly, into "wives' tale", if context is a correct guide. IMHO, this
does not mean it is _untrue_, rather, unverified grapevine gossip that
may be true but needs further examination.

Subject: Cooker/boil post combo


Has anyone tried the 10-15 gallon electric water heaters for mashing/boiling?
I saw one on sale:
         12 gallon (UK), 115 volt (220 would be better) for $115 CND
         (that should translate to about $90 US).
These are glass lined, so one would have to be careful cutting (grinding) the
lid off, but otherwise the unit is insultated and temperture controlled, with
the added feature of a 'bottom tap'.


        I would put money on the fact that they would be great for mashing, but
I wonder how they would work for boiling???


        The Costco 120,000 BTU sounds like the right size to boil 10 gallons of
wort.  Coleman also sells a camp cooker - but only 45,000 BTU.
        I am in the throws of ripping apart an old natural gas water heater and
converting the burner to propane for cooking my wort, but it too was only rated
at about 40,000 BTU.  Gas water tanks have the flame tube running up the centre
which doesn't do much for a 'pot'

 This is from the "Irish Emigrant", an email newspaper featuring items
of interest to Irish expatriates and those working abroad.




     - The two ships which carried bulk Guinness from Dublin to
       Liverpool have made their last voyage.  The crews of the two
       vessels staged a protest against their redundancy terms for the
       last few weeks but this was eventually resolved.  About 40
       seamen have lost their jobs.  Guinness will in future be taken
       from the brewery in special tanks and loaded on board other
       ships.


  If they used this same technique to ship elsewhere, could this perhaps
explain the distinctive "tang" in guinness here in the States?

Subject: Am I ready to go all-grain?


Greetings.


I've got half a dozen extract batches under my belt (some were with specialty
grains), and I really enjoy the brewing process.  I *THINK* I'd like to try an
all-grain batch, and I'd like to make sure that I understand the basic
principles involved.  So, here's what I understand the process to be:


1> select a recipe & get the ingredients
2> crush the malt (or buy it crushed)
3> start the WYeast pack, then make a starter (I'm already using this method)
4> malt the barley 
   
    OK, this is where it gets complicated, right?  I want to basically make
a barley soup type of concoction, and keep the mixture at 150-160 degrees,
temperature decided by how much fermentables vs. body I want.  Right?


OK, now I've let it sit at, say, 155 degrees.  What's a protein rest?  What's
this about heating it up to two different temperature levels so the different
enzymes can do their stuff?  Am I worrying?




OK, so I have my 'soup'.  Now, I need to sparge.  So, I take my soup, pour
it into my lauter tun (which I haven't made/bought yet).  Which design is
best?  (uh oh, I'd better not start that one.  How about 'which design is
fairly easy to build and will last, cost isn't all THAT important')


So, I sparge, limiting the flow so that I get good extraction from the grain
bed.  I go through my sparge water, and recirculate it until clear?  Is that
the case?  I'm not too clear on that bit.


Anyway, I finish my sparging, and I have somewhere around 5-6 gallons of
wort at this point, right?  From here, it's familiar.




So, have I missed anything, or misunderstood anything (probably)?  Is that all
there is ?!??!?!?!  It really doesn't seem like a lot more than just using
specialty grains, with the exception that the specialty grains aren't sparged
as completely, it seems.


Thanks for any info you can provide.  The differences between my all-extract
and my "some specialty grains" (is this partial mash?) batches have convinced
me that it's worth the extra effort!


Thanks!

   an avid user of the GEnie system I'd like to put a plug in for it.
   I've been on it for over a year and enjoy it quite a bit.
   For users with local nodes there is no charge other than the
   $4.95 monthly fee (most people have local nodes),....
 
 Let me add my two cents here also.  On the downside is that it can get pretty 
 slow during the busy periods but considering that it is free compared to 
 Compuserves opressive fees, it is a great trade off.  The only other problem 
 is that it is not as active as CIS or HBD but that seems easy to rectify.
 
 To re-iterate, GENIE beer formum participation is included in the $4.95 
 monthly fee.  Compuserve charges $6 per hour for participation in their beer 
 forum.  That may not sound like much but for any kind of interactive 
 participation, keeping it under $100 per month is not easy.
 
 I suppose the AHA got in bed with CIS before there was a Genie but at this 
 point in time, I think it is time to reconsider the association.  It is 
 really a dis-service to promote a service that is so expensive when other 
 alternatives are available.

Hello Fellow Brewers,


I'm back to share a newsworthy item I found in the Saturday, 1 May edition of 
my local daily newspaper, the Jackson, MS _Clarion Ledger_.  The article is 
one of about 8 that appears each day "highlighting" little snippets of info
about world events (with arrows to a country on a world map, as to enhance our
geographical education).

Beck hopes yeast in space brews cosmic beer


- ---Don't look now, but the German beer of your future may be orbiting overhead
on the shuttle Columbia.  A tube of Beck and Co.'s ingredients is fermenting 
aboard the shuttle to determine whether weightlessness and cosmic rays can
genetically alter yeast to produce tastier beer.  Experts at the University of
Munich will make sample batches after the yeast is returned, said company 
spokesman Hans-Joachim Allgaier.  Beck may know by the end of the year whether
it has a commercially viable mutant.  "We wouldn't sell it as space beer,"
Allgaier said.  "We're too conservative to market beer like that.  Besides, it
wouldn't taste like space."
==============================  END OF ARTICLE  ============================


?Beck and Co.?  Is this the same Beck as in Beck's beer from Bremen?  I hope
something works for them, 'cause even though I like a dark beer, their stuff
don't do it for me, especially after having had a sampling of some dark
home-brewed.

The following article was drawn from the Associated Press and 
appeared in the May 2 Seattle Times:


   "OBERPFAFFENHOFEN, Germany - Don't look now, but the German beer of
your future may be orbiting overhead on the space shuttle Columbia. 
   A spiral tube of Beck and Co.'s finest ingredients is fermenting
aboard the shuttle, to determine whether the weightlessness and intense
cosmic rays of space can genetically alter yeast to produce tastier beer.
   Germans may be tittering that their national passion for beer has
been taken to the limits, literally.  Beck's lovers hope the already
prized brew will taste even better.
   The yeast is among the less weighty of the 88 experiments in Columbia's
payload, which is being monitored at a space center outside Munich.
   The $570 million program includes research into everything from energy-
conserving turbine blades to semiconductors to robotics.  The yeast
experiment is one of several aboard the shuttle enabling scientists to
observe changes in living cells in a weightless environment."

2 points.  I brew 5 gallon batches or so, but always want 6+ gallons of wort.
Up to 1 gallon will be the hop trub, I will collect wort for priming, and
will lose some volume to yeast trub in racking, and even through evaporation
and loss of volume.  Therefore the actual wort efficiencies of those batches
may well have been higher.


The second point is that lesser extraction can result in less astringency and
hence smoother - better beers.  However, many consider this to be wasteful.


Yesterday I brewed and extracted about 8.4B per lb per US gallon - highish
but I am usually over 7.5 (30 sg points approx) for the 6 gallons I collect,
but for the 5 gallons of beer I produce,  the efficicy drops to 28 for my 
batch yesterday, or better
than 25 for the average.

Subject: I don't "hate" Jim Koch


In the most recent Digest, Al Korzonas explains why "we hate Jim Koch."
I don't hate anyone (except, perhaps, my ex-wife and Eliot Abrams);
certainly I don't hate Jim Koch, and I'd rather Al Korzonas didn't speak
for me.


In reality, Koch's bad odor goes back a lot farther and includes a lot
more than his overly-litigous behavior or his ridiculous "lambic" beer.
He's a wheeler-dealer, and is guilty of most or all the excesses
associated with wheeler-dealers.  But the microbrewery business has its
share of wheeler-dealers, too; not necessarily as successful(!) as Koch,
but they are out there.  And, as others have pointed out, Koch -- for al
his deceptions -- has succeeded in awakening a mass audience for
flavorful, all-malt beers that is much larger than anything the micros
could have done alone.


Personally, I'll reserve my hatred and outrage for people who commit far
greater crimes than Jim Koch's marketing ploys.

Subject: Extraction Rates




Whenever I read the tremendous extraction rates people get it 
reminds me of the comment one of my golf partners said: " I
Always do worse when someone else keeps score"


That aside.  Mashing and sparging technique will impact extraction.


A poor crush and poor mash , ie incomplete conversion, will reduce the
potential extraction.  A poor sparge will leave converted sugars in the
grain further reducing extraction.


I get between 28 and 30.


Equipment can also be a factor.  I noticed when I reduced the height of
the false bottom in my Zappap lauter tun I improved extraction.  Over
sparging for the sake of better extraction can lead to astringent flvors
'from the extraction of husk tannins.  


A usual cause for poor extraction in the beggining phase of all grain
brewing.  Is sparging.  What was the grain bed temp?  The PH of the 
sparge water? Temp of sparge water?  Did you stir the contents of the
brew pot before taking a sample?  Did you temp adjust the samples sg
before doing your calulations?


What method was used to calculate the extraction:  I use
(temp adjusted sg of pre boil wort * vol of preboil wort) / total grain bill

To my knowledge I have never tasted a beer that has been dry hopped.  I have
always been happy with the results of steeping the hops at the end of the boil.
But this last weekend I was able to taste Anchor's Liberty Ale.  Wow!  If I
closed my eyes I could believe I was drinking a glass of hops.  Being from the
Pacific Northwest, this is a good thing.


So now I have to try dry hopping.  Does anybody know what kind of hops Anchor
uses for dry hopping?  Does anybody know what kind of yeast they use for their
liberty ale?  I am assuming that since they call it an ale they do not use the
same yeast as they use for their steam beer.  Is the yeast in the bottle the
yeast that is used for fermentation or do they add a different yeast for
conditioning?

Subject: 3 gal kegs revisited


I posted several months ago asking for info on 3 gal. kegs. Slowly, I got
replies. In the middle of all that I took a vacation to the Bay Area (where
I visited Anchor and some other great places). Needless to say, I have been
procrastinating on the keg thing... BUT, in the meanwhile I had a birthday
and was given a *complete* system including a 3 gal. keg. Of course, we all
know that one keg isn't enough. So, here is the information I was given.


1.    Brewhaus in Knoxville,TN  1-800-638-2437    3 gal(??fitting) 39.95
 
2.    St.Pat's of Texas Brewer's Supply  1-512-832-9045  3 gal pin 38.00  
                                                        3 gal ball 47.00


3.    BCI in Brighton,TN  1-800-284-9410       3 gal(pin or ball)  34.50
      they also have 10 gal.kegs. 


4.    Brewmaster in San Leandro, CA 1-510-351-8920  no longer carry the
      3 gal for 25.00  (BUT, the 5 gal are currently 20.00!)


5.    Brewmeister(not sure of location) 1-916-356-5602  3 gal kegs 45.00
      (all new rubber and stainless plugs).


These are posted in the order I received the information. I have since 
ordered from BCI, but have not yet received my order. Hope this helps someone
find a source!

Hi everybody!
   Back when i was a lowly grad. student in New Orleans, I used to
order all of my stuff from a place called Simplex.  If I remember
correctly, it is in either Wis. or Minn.  Unfortunately, I have
lost their address. Does anybody out there have it??


Thanks much,

I am interested in the amount of 5 gallon kegs a twenty pound CO2 tank
will dispense.  I know it has been posted before.  If someone could kindly
point me in the right direction.

o and Brewpub fanciers,


     A while ago I asked about info on good brewpubs in Vermont.  The
response was so great -- my tankard runneth over!


     Now my housemate is planning a trip home to Iowa next week and he'll
be passing through Columbus OH, Indianapolis, and Chicago.  He knows about
Berghoff's in Chicago, and he knows where to go once he's in Iowa, but if
anyone could suggest other places, we'd be grateful, especially since I'm
from Iowa too, and I make the same trip once in a while.


    Thanking you in advance for the brew route info!  -- Alan B.

Subject: Whitebread Yeast and Brewpubs


Another datapoint in the saga of the "old" Whitbread yeast.


The local brewpub, a fine outfit worthy of many more tourist
dollars BTW, has always used a Whitbread yeast.  At about
the same time that George Fix tells us the production of
this yeast was switched to a Canadian plant and the problems
began, I and several other fans noticed serious consistency
problems in the lovely hand-pumped real ale served at this
pub.  One week, yummy, the next, yucky.  Too much of odd
fruit flavours and way overattenuated.  Tasted like cheap
homebrew, you know the sort of stuff I mean.


Anyhow, of late these problems have tapered off, and recent
pints are back to being pretty yummy again.  So, I for one
think the data fits the proposed history.


BTW, I also would like to get a Maltmill but nobody in this
neck of Canada has ever heard of the *&%$#$% thing.  Also,
the cost of importing just one would bankrupt me.  Jack, do
you have any suggestions for us?  As a political aside, perhaps
this is a good example of why IMHO the so-called free trade
deal sucks big rocks.


Cheers, P.

Yes, I tried some in a batch for a basic ale and found that the
biscuit malt adds a distinct taste from the usual crystal malt.
For the next batch in this style I will probably increase the
amount used.  Since a common name for Scotch beer is "Wee Heavy"
maybe I could call this ale a "Wee Light".
