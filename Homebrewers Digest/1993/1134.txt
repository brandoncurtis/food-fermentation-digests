I can supply some info regarding Alan Christopher Braddock's request for 
brewpubs in Columbus OH.  The newest (and I think best place in town) is called
Barley's Ale House.  It's located on High street just north of downtown across 
from the comvention center in an area called the Short North.  They have a nice 
pale ale, an irish red ale and an excellent porter all of which can be bought 
in pint or 1/2 yard glasses. The food is quite good too.


Alternatively, check out Hoster's in the Old Brewery district (just south of
downtown also on High street).  They have a varying array of light and dark
lagers and also a very nice menu for dinner.


Enjoy!!

Subject: Correction, PU on Draft


 
 For the record, I referred to an article on nitorgen use in brewing by Geroge 
 Fix and he has been inundated with questions on it.
 
 Unfortunately, the article was not written by Fix.  It was sent to me by 
 George and I got so engrossed in the information that I never bothered 
 reeding the authors names.
 
 It is from the MBAA Technical Quarterly,  Vol 29 and the authors are 
 David Taylor, Bamber, Brown and Murray, all in the UK.
 
 Sorry George.
 
                       ................
 
 My wife and I had dinner at the Edelweiss Inn, 7650 Irving Park in Norridge, 
 IL and stared at a point of sale ad for PU through most of the dinner.  We 
 presumed it was the usual skunky, sedimented six pack stuff so we just 
 sampled the Germans wines.  When the wine was gone, I started drooling over 
 the PU again and much to our delight, the waitress told us it was on draft.  
 At this point, in the meal, I couldn't really appreciate it but for those in 
 the area, it's there and $2.50 will get you ten ounces in a genuine PU glass.
 
 Sure be fun to bring the C-P filler and send a few plain brown bottles off to  
 the National.  Who me?
 
 Actually, I wouldn't take the chance because real people probably don't like 
 it anyway untill someone tells them it's the world's greatest beer and they 
 must like it.

Subject: Where's the hops?


Hello all!


I just have a quick question which would serve to dispell any worries I might
be having about my newly planted hops.  About 2 weeks ago I planted 3 hop
roots in the back garden and I have yet to see any progress.  Now, the weather
up here in Wisconsin has been far from perfect (lots of rain, pretty chilly,
temps in the mid-30's to low 60's, usually around 45).  I am starting to 
wonder whether or not my little ones will ever poke their pretty little hoppy
heads out above the ground or if they are just shy.  Any input from some other
hop growers in the upper-midwest would be greatly appreciated.


By the way, should I be fertilizing these guys?  If so, what do all of you
recommend?  I have some ordinary vegetable fertilizer but is there a particular
brand which works the best.  Ohmigosh(!), they might grow even faster if I start
to feritilize them.  Hmmm.  Maybe I had better bolt the door after I do that
(assuming they cooperate and _start_ growing) :-).


Much appreciated in advance...


Diane

Subject: extraction & Zapap


About this thread on extract efficiency and in particular the 
use of a Zapap lauter tun:  


<Equipment can also be a factor.  I noticed when I reduced the height of
<the false bottom in my Zappap lauter tun I improved extraction.  Over
<sparging for the sake of better extraction can lead to astringent flvors
<'from the extraction of husk tannins.


Two comments here: 1) When approaching the end of the lauter, tip the 
buckets so that they lean forward at an angle.  Put something under the
back of the buckets to support them.  Watch for grain matter coming out 
& terminate runoff at this time.  What this does is clear out the higher
SG "trapped" runoff in the flase bottom below the outflow. 


2) Build the sucker with a BOTTOM outlet.  Design it so the spigot is 
as flush as possible to the inside bottom of the lauter tun.  In this 
arrangegment, the amount of false bottom "dead space" is irrelevent.
The grain particulate matter will be flushed out early in the recirc
process and will run clean until the final runoff carries grain matter
to the spigot.  Your extraction will improve. This is my current lauter
tun design and it works great.  you just need to suspend the buckets/pot
so that the spigot will clear the support structure.


Good brewing,
Jim Busch

Another note on beer in space, as a follow-up to my posting on Cosmic Beer on
3 May.


Anyone catch _The Tonight Show_ with Jay Leno the night of 3 May?  Apparantly
he too heard about the Beck beer experiment, and had a comment or two about
the shuttle Columbia's problems and cargo.  Went *something* like this...


You guys hear about the trouble the space shuttle has been having lately?  First
the toilet breaks, to conserve energy they have had to shut off most all of 
their lights, and have got no hot water.  Oh yea, they are having a good time
on the shuttle.  And .... they are making beer up there!


Really, no kidding.  Some German company has sent up some stuff to see how it
does.  Can you imagine, a bunch of guys, weightless, no lights, with free beer
and a broken toilet ...


Well, he told it funnier.

Subject: liberty ale notes




Liberty Ale is fairly high in gravity, at 1.060 - 1.062 in starting
gravity.  Malts are all U.S. pale malt, though I would be inclined
to throw in a bit of light crystal.  Color is on the light side.
Hops are all Cascades.  Liberty Ale is fairly bitter, and I think
has something like 45 IBUs of bitterness.  As a homebrewer, add
Cascades several times during the boil, and dryhop with some
Cascades.  Try 1/2 ounce to 1 ounce of Cascades hops for at least
a week in the secondary.  Pellets are more convenient.  Regarding
yeast, I don't know what Anchor uses, but the homebrewer can use
Wyeast "American" Ale or culture some Sierra Nevada yeast from a
bottle of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  In the bottle, Liberty Ale
sometimes tastes a bit one-dimensional.  I had some fresh on draft
recently and it was deliciously balanced and perilously drinkable.

Subject: Fear of Clear Beer




        I was sitting down with the Boston Globe this morning, when I happened 
upon a article that caught me totally off guard: "It's Clear, All Right, But Is
It Beer?"  Featured in the article is a picture and a review, of sorts, of
Miller's lastest creation, "Miller's Clear."


        This may not be news to many of you, but here are some of the
things written about this "beer" in the article.  122 calories per bottle, 
with a "full-flavor" [according to Miller, that is.


        The author took this complimentary six pack and wandered around
Boston, getting bartenders to try the beer and give their opinion.  All but
one said basically that they think that "most beer drinkers will try Clear
once before quickly returning to their regular brands."


        Some of the more colorful quotes were these:


"It tastes like sparkling water with a hint of beer."
"If you keep filtering and filtering beer, you eventually get back to water."
"It tastes like Alka Seltzer that's gone flat.  It has no grit.  I couldn't 
        give it away."


The one bartender who did like the stuff is apparently a bartender in a
rather upscale hotel, whose work uniform consists in a black wasitcoat
and tie, with a Hawaiian orchid in his lapel...and worked for Miller for 
14 years.


Finally, here's the end of the article:


"But I think you should put the color back.  I think you should put the flavor
back.  And especially I think you should do what most of these Boston bar-
tenders suggest: Put the beer back.

Subject: Priming with Honey?


     This past weekend I was at a homebrew exposition and one
of the guys there was hawking honey for mead and beer.  We got to
talking (and drinking his fine mead) and I asked about using honey
to prime beer with.  He told me that in order to prime with honey
you need about a pound (standard small jar available in supermarkets)
and that it takes about a month to carbonate.  Is this information
accurate?  Has anyone ever done this before?


     Any and all responses are appreciated.

Actually GA is used to force blooming.  The class of compounds that I think
you're thinking of is auxins.  Auxins stimulate rooting and cause elongation
of stems (etiolation).  Many commercially used auxins and GAs are in fact
completely synthetic. (I vaguely remember that Agent Orange is
auxin-like)(Maybe someone with better information can correct me)


> (A related hormone is acetylene, this stimulates the ripening of fruit...)
I think you're thinking of ethylene.  Ethylene does in fact accellerate
ripening.


Brewing Question:
I have just disolved a small business that sold homebrewing kits, so I have
~110 #s of pale Laaglander malt extract to use up.  I also have 50 #s of 40L
crystal, 50 #s of roasted barley, and a lot of cascade(alpha 5.4%) and
galena(alpha 14%).  I have found that the malt extract recipes that I have
made just aren't as good as the all grain brews I've made.  I do a full volume
boil, use a wort chiller and Wyeast, but it's still not as good, and its
nearly as much trouble as a full mash.  Does anyone have any suggestions for
improving my extract brews so that I can use up this DME and grain?  Also if
anyone has any good recipes using just the ingredients I have I would
really appreciate it if you could post them or mail them to me.

Sam Adams is not and never has been a microbrewed beer.  From its
inception it was contract-brewed, originally in Pennsylvania and for the
last couple of years here in Portland at the Blitz-Weinhard Brewery.  I
think they also did some pilot brews in Germany, although this might
just be Kochype.


People interested in purchasing Belgian malts ought to contact Tim
Norris, who runs a small business out of his home in Chicago.  I don't
have his address handy, but he can be contacted by e-mail at his
CompuServe account: 71650.1020`at`CompuServe.COM  


Tim offers an excellent selection of the malts, excellent prices and his
service is impeccable.  I recommend him highly.  I just received, as a
matter of fact, my second order of Belgian malts.  Even with shipping
costs from Chicago to Portland, the malts cost about 2/3 what they would
have cost from my local retailer -- if he carried them.

Subject: sparge water volume


I seem to recall that in Fix's article on HSA (at least I believe that is 
the source) it was mentioned that the volume of sparge water should not 
exceed 1.5 times the mash volume.  I don't quite see how this works if you 
want to make beers of different gravity.  One uses different volumes of 
mash water with different quantities of grain to make a 1034 bitter or a 
1060 bock.  For the 1060 beer you may get away with using 1.5 times mash 
water for sparging, but for the bitter it'll be more like 2.5 times, 
otherwise you just won't make up the volume of wort to 5 gallons.  Did I 
misremember?  Does this make sense?

Neither is really true.  "Momily(tm)" comes from a series of books
by someone whose name I can't remember.  The books are about
things your mother always told you that weren't quite true.  The
term "momily" is trademarked by the author.


About a year(?) ago, someone on this list started applying the
term to all those millions of things that some people think are
LAW but really aren't.  (Oh my gods! If don't siphon the cooled
wort off the trub, your descendants will MUTATE!  You're entire
batch will be DESTROYED if you don't have your pH adjusted to
exactly what Miller recommends!)


I guess that identifying momilies(tm) helps us keep in mind that
for every "law" in homebrewing, there is a beer that won awards
by breaking it.


Cheers!

Belgian Malts


St. Pat's of Austin (512) 832-9045 carries Special B and other Belgian
malts.  Great stuff.


> Darren Aaberge asks about Anchor Liberty Ale:


The hops used are Cascade.  In homebrew terms the dry hopping rate is about
2 ozs per 5 gallons for about two weeks at reduced temperature (around
50-55F).  At Anchor they are added to the conditioning tank.  Also be aware
that Liberty also receives a healthy dose of finishing hops.  For more
information on *how* to dry hop, my article on this topic will be out in a
few weeks in the next Zymurgy.


As to their yeast, the only thing I know for sure is that it is a different
strain from the Steam yeast.  Liberty is fermented in deep tanks (as opposed
to the shallow tanks for their Steam and Porter) and at a slightly higher
temperature (but not much).  There is a good chance that Sierra's yeast is
related to the Anchor, but this is pure speculation on my part.  Anchor did
help the SN boys get started.  Anyway, you won't go wrong with SN yeast when
trying to clone Liberty.  Culture from a bottle or use Wyeast "Chico".
