I just had my first taste of Celis Pale Bock last night and fell in love.  
Anybody have a good all grain recipe that even comes close to this

   Ethylene is in fact responsible for only one axis of ripening; for
instance, it turns green tomatoes red without changing their consistency
(hence the red styrofoam baseballs sold as tomatoes in most supermarkets).
For that matter, can any botanist here tell us whether it has anything to
do with barley? I know there are substantial differences between grains
and fruiting plants but don't remember any details as it's been 25 years
since my last serious botany....

Message Creation Date was at  5-MAY-1993 09:18:00
      
          Greetings,
               I'm curious about the effect of light on beer.  I've
          always been told that light can cause a "skunky" off-taste,
          so I've always covered my carboys, bottled at night,
          bottled in brown bottles, and stored the bottles under
          cover.  Evidentally this has worked since I have not been
          getting any "Skunk" flavors.  After considering my
          brewing/bottling process I've started to wonder if this is
          over-kill.  Am I going to extreme lengths for minimal gain?


               Does anyone know the wave-length of the  "harmful"
          light?  I mean are we talking UV, visible, IR, or some
          other wave-length?  If visible light is a culprit, are the
          lights in my house enough to cause problems?  How much
          light, in terms of strength and duration, is required to
          cause problems?  I'd hate to find out that visible light
          from light-bulbs could potentially cause problems - On a
          stressful day there's nothing better than sitting on the
          floor, sipping a home-brew, and staring at all the bubbles
          of an active fermentation.  Ahhh!!

               I will be out in San Diego in a week and I'm interested

I thought it might be appropriate to mention a new beer I had this week.
Sierra Nevada's Brown Ale! I thought it was a good example of the style and
really liked it. SN, who is know for those big hoppy beers, has used a
delicate hand at the hopping here and did a great job (once again). Don't
know if they plan to bottle it or not, I just hope it becomes one of their
main line of beers. Watch for it!

I have primed several batches with honey.  In some of these batches, honey
also made up a significant portion of the fermentables, in others, the only
honey used was for priming.  I don't know about the weight, but I found that
1/3 Cup will give a pleasant light carbonation, and anything more that 1/2 Cup
will produce soda-pop fizziness.  Boil it in water as you would corn sugar,
but also skim the scum off as it boils.  It will probably contain a bit of wax
and pieces of bee armpits.


A month is excessive, but it does take a little longer than, say, corn sugar.
At the tiny quantities used for priming, you won't be able to tell the
difference between clover, blackberry, or anything else, so use what's
available, it's all just bee barf.  Some will disagree with that.  Those who
do are wrong.  :-|

I think you're worrying a little too much and too early, give them some
time.  Here in NJ the Cascade have just broke the surface and the
Williamette are 3 feet long (with other varieties somewhere inbetween).
These are established plants.  You've got quite a bit cooler weather up
there and you're starting with new plants, give 'em time.


Did the cuttings already have some shoots and were they "crisp" and
seemingly alive (as opposed to dried out)?

A slow, continuous release fertilizer seems to work best, I use bone
meal with good results with an occasional overspray (the hops are
adjaicent to my veggie garden) of Miracle Grow.

Subject: Sparge Water


Ed Hitchcock asks in HBD#1134 how a bitter with SG = 1.034 can be
brewed with the ratio of sparge water to mash water being no more than
1.5. I personally let the mash thickness float, and indeed have found this
to be a relatively unimportant variable within a reasonable range. In
particular, plots of yield vs. mash thickness tend to be quite flat in
the range 25-40 liters/kg.


To cite some examples, suppose we want to brew 50 liters. In my system
this would require
 
                 50 * (4/3) = 66.67 liters water


(due to 12.5 % of the water used being left in the grains, and a 10%
evaporation in the boil). Suppose 33.3 liters of water is used in the
mash, and the same amount is used for sparging. If 10 kg. of base malt
is used (adjustments are needed if adjunct malts are used), then typically
56 liters of wort would be collected in the brew kettle at a gravity of
1.045. This would boil down to 50 liters at SG = 1.050. A grain bill consisting
of say 7 kg. of base malt typically yields 50 liters at 1.035. 


In both of the above cases the yield is ~30 pts/lbs/gal. While this number
is insensitive to mash thickness, it does depend strongly on the mash to
sparge water ratio. In the above examples, about 2% of the extract is left
behind in the grains. Had the ratio been increased to 1.5 (26 liters in the
mash and 60 liters for sparging), the extract lost will typically drop to
1%. The most extreme case I have brewed had a ratio near 3.5 (20 liters mash
to 46 liters sparge), and virtually no extract was left behind in the grains.
The resulting beer was not to my taste, although clearly this is a subjective
evaluation (as opposed to a scientific one). As I have noted before, I am not 
a yield aficionado. The major exception to this involves malt which has  
deteriorated due to excess moisture. I have alas had this happen, and the 
resulting yields were extremely low. In all other cases, I am indifferent to
the yield a particular brewing configuration will give. The real issue is
how the brewer feels about the finished beer.

Subject: clear beer stuff




According to this week's Advertising Age, Miller Clear Beer is
being test-marketed in Austin, Texas; Minneapolis; and Richmond,
Va.  Ad Age conducted a blind tasting in Chicago.  Suitably chilled
Clear Beer was poured into colored plastic cups along with
Budweiser and Coors, and the lights were lowered.  Some taster
comments (tasters were Ad Age employees -- probably not a bad
target group):


"It tastes just like a Bud."
"It seems a little more mellow, almost like flat beer."
"It tastes like watered-down beer."
"If you had a glass of beer and emptied it, then refilled it with
water...that's what it tastes like."


One taster thought Clear Beer had more body than the other two
brews.


Several tasters commented that Clear Beer had "a mineral water
aftertaste."


Several male panelists said they judge a beer's quality and
strength by the deepness of its color.  "Don't people equate color
with flavor?  If so, that could be a problem."


Finally, one male panelist said color "makes a beer brand to me. 
It certainly would be weird to chase tequila with a clear beer."

Subject: White beer recipe revisited


Some time ago I posted a recipe for a white beer I believe a
fair number of people used as a starting point for brews of
their own.


While I thought my own batch had turned out pretty well
(still do), I also said that there was room for improvement
and experimentation.  Most of the people I know who are
brewing white beer--myself included--are still figuring out
how to deal with it, and the idea of the posting was to
share my own experience in the hope that other people
wouldn't have to start from zero.


In this same vein I'd like to ask those people who used this
recipe--or have another one they like--to let us know how
things worked out.  You can send messages to me if you like,
and I'll edit them into a single post.  I'd be particularly
interested in comments on grist ratios, spicing, and yeast.


If things didn't turn out well you're welcome to call me a
scoundrel, too--I'll do my best to leave in any relevant
feedback you have that might help someone make better beer,
as well as any insults that seem especially witty.
