Hi gang!
I'v got a question for all of you worldly travelin' beer lovers out there.  My 
girlfriend is going to be in Europe all of next month and will be spending the 
last week of her trip in Belgium.  So naturally, I have asked her (and she has 
agreed) to bring me back some local Belgian beers.  My questions to you are:


     1)  Whats the duty rate on alcohol over the duty-free limit (and for that 
         matter whats the duty free limit)?


     2)  Is it best just to pack the beer carefully and carry it on the plane 
         as extra luggage or to ship it?


     3)  Does anyone have any particular recomendations about Belgian beers not
         available here that she might easily find there?  She will be spending
         most of her time in Antwerp.


Any and all assistance can be sent either directly to me at
                   mfryling`at`magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
or posted if you think your comments are of general interest.  Thanks in
advance.

Subject: Musings on Commercial Beer


 
 My C-P bottler is down for re-design so I bought a bunch of commercial stuff 
 to take to a party.  Always wanting to turn a beer drink into a learning 
 experience, I bought some things I have wanted to try/compare.
 
 Draft Guinness in the can is not only lousy beer but the nitrogen gizzmo is 
 just plain silly.  I thought the beer had a metalic taste and was lacking in 
 anything worth mentioning.
 
 Bass ale was about as bland as the Guinness but lacked the metalic taste and 
 just about any other, for that matter.
 
 Take the coloring out of Beck's Dark and you have Beck's regular.  It seems a 
 bit more beerish but hardly in line with the color.
 
 The good news (strike me dead) was Miller Reserve Pale Ale.  I tried the "all 
 barley" larger a few months ago and it seemed a farce but this stuff is real 
 ale.  It's fruity and wonderful.  It has a very marvey aroma and the taste 
 that follows is exactly was you expect from the aroma.  By far the best beer 
 to come out of the biggies in decades.  No doubt they found the right 
 combination of chemicals to do the trick but at least it tastes like beer.
 It does not taste like my ales but rather like most of the ales I taste at 
 club meetings and the experts tell me that is what it is supposed to taste 
 like. 
 
 Needless to say, I wait with baited breath to hear what others think of it.

   I wouldn't suggest that anybody do this with a batch they value.
   Stiv Stroud runs periodic Dr. Beer sessions at which participants can
sample beers with various off-flavors. At the session I was at a couple of
years ago, the demonstration of light-struck beer involved some Molson's
which he said had had a total of 6 hours of direct sunlight (well, as
direct as you can get in February). The stuff was LETHAL; I could smell it
a yard away almost the instant the bottle was opened and wouldn't even
consider tasting it (I wanted to be able to taste something else that day).
   I expect this will vary quite a bit according to factors like carboy
geometry and how dark the beer is; my assessment in private email was that
it wasn't likely to be a problem because most homebrewers don't have
flurorescents where they ferment. I also don't have any data on typical
spectra for fluorescent lights, only the datum that they're efficient
lights only by comparison with incandescents---something like a mere 85%
(vs ~93%) of energy used comes out as heat, which would suggest that
fluorescents might have less energy in the high-visible and UV range
than sunlight. However, there are probably enough carboy-sized places in
the typical homebrewer's residence without sun or fluorescent lighting that
it would be a silly risk to take.

Subject: Isomerized Hop Extracts vs. Skunkiness


May 1 (National Homebrew Day), the Kalamazoo Brewery had a free
homebrew "conference".  One of the speakers was a "hop chemist" from
Kalsec (I think I got that right), a company in Kalamazoo that does
"spice extraction".  He talked about the chemistry of hops flavors &
aromas.  The best part was the box of vials of extracted flavor/aroma
components that he passed around (ranging from "cheesy/funky" through
"esters" to pure isomerized alpha&beta acids (he said it was 1,000,000
BUs)).  Apparently, Kalsec makes the hops extract that "2 of the 3
largest brewers" in the US use (hint: AB is the one that doesn't).
They do the light-stabilization thing that lets Miller get away with
clear bottles (even though the hops are just about sub-threshold, I
imagine the mercaptans wouldn't be).


(The rest of the day was fun, too.)

Subject: Sam Adams...... a Microbrewery


Far be it from me to take the position of defending Sam Adams, but there 
appears to be some confusion in the HBD-world about where SA is and isn't 
brewed.


Jeff Frane sez:
> Sam Adams is not and never has been a microbrewed beer.  From its
> inception it was contract-brewed, originally in Pennsylvania and for the
> last couple of years here in Portland at the Blitz-Weinhard Brewery.




Well, yes and no.  Sam Adams LAGER was first brewed as a contract beer in the 
Pittsburgh Brewing Co.  It still is, and in the last few years it has also been 
contract brewed at Blitz-Weinhard.  The other seasonal bottled SA products are 
also contracted out of Pittsburgh.  I don't know whether these are also brewed 
at B-W.


Sam Adams BOSTON ALE (bottled version and some of the draft) is brewed at 
Matt's in Utica, NY.   Sorry, Lisa St. Hilaire, your tour guide was wrong.  
Utica does the brewing, not just the storage.


It gets more confusing, however, because Sam Adams (the Boston Beer Company) 
does indeed have a microbrewery here in Boston where they make numerous draft 
beers (including Boston Ale) that are available at local taps in the Boston 
area.  Some of these beers are experimental (like the recent "triplebock" and 
last summer's "dunkelweizen").  The draft beers that SA's takes out to the GABF 
are also brewed here in Boston.  I have been told by the head brewer that they 
also make occasional batches of Sam Adams Lager (draft) in the Boston brewery.


The heart of Sam Adam's microbrewery is a 10 bbl mashtun which was acquired 
from the now defunct Newman's Brewery in Albany.


So to say that Sam Adams is not and never has been a microbrewed beer is not 
true.  While it is predominantly a contracted beer, at least here in 
Boston, some of the product is microbrewed.


Steve Stroud


Oh, BTW, the Sam Adams that is sold in Germany is supposed to be 
contract-brewed IN Germany.  I don't know the name of the brewery.

Subject: Re: Beer Machine Infomercial


I did not see the commercial for this beer machine, but in the May 10
digest, Randall Holt (rxh6`at`po.CWRU.Edu) asks:


>The question I have, has anyone tried this system, or
>even tried brewing in this fashion, by fermenting and carbonating
>in the same container? I can imagine how tangy this beer would be,
>being poured right off the trub. Of course the happy smiling 'real

I have done this with a "Brew Sack" (tm).  Instead of using a glass 
or plastic keg, they use a woven plastic bag with a plastic liner.


The "Brew Sack" comes pre-loaded with hopped malt syrup in one of three
varieties (Porter, Stout, Pilsner).  Just add hot (~150 degree) water
to dissolve the syrup, then add more water (20 pints total) to cool
down to ~95 degrees and add the yeast.  The bag is equipped with a
pressure relief valve in the screw-on cap and with a tap near the
bottom.


I kept mine for about 7-10 days at a reasonable room temperature, then
moved it downstairs to a room at about ~55 degrees for 4 weeks.


It was pretty lively when I opened it, but the carbonation seemed external,
somehow -- the beer never had much head by itself.  I guess this is not
surprising, since a plastic bag is not going to stand up to a lot of
pressure.


The beer (a Porter) was very rich and quite tasty.  It was *not* clear
(even for a Porter), but I was not bothered by any sediments.  I did 
choose to pass on the last 2 inches of brew left in the bottom, though
I suppose it would be a good vitamin B-12 supplement?


This weekend I plan to start a Brown Ale that I will split between a
standard single-stage fermentation technique and the "Brew Sack".  Then
in 6 weeks or so I will have an official comparison taste test ---
provided that I can get the !`at`#$%^&* screw cap off of the Brew
Sack....

I have a question for you beer scholars out there.  This past weekend my father-
in-law and I were quaffing a couple, and he asked me if anyone on the network 
had ever mentioned "Chang".  He told me a story of when he went to Nepal and
began a climb of Mt. Everest (real story, fully documented etc, etc. he never
intended to go to the summit or anything, just wanted to 'climb' it, and he went
and climbed to one of the traditional base camps).


At any rate, he said it is a brewed beverage, consumed  during social and 
sometimes at ceremonial gatherings (sometimes spelled as "Chan" by those in 
Tibet).  Said it was quite strong, and (given the altitude) would really 'do 
a number on you'.  He wants to know if anyone out there in HBD Land knows a 
full history and recipe.


I've seen a couple of posts lately from some student(s) doing research on
brewing, so come on guys and gals, here is your chance to show us what you've
got.

Subject: Isomerization




Two issues ago my eye was struck by the statement regarding the
processes involved in brewing and skunking "... isomerization is the
process by which longer chain molecules are made."  Well, I don't have a
PhD in Organic chemistry, yet.  Isomerization is simply a change in
structure or connectivity in a molecule.  I believe that in the alpha
acids, the isomerization involves the shifting of double bonds to form a
conjugated system (alternating double and single bonds in a chain) that
would indeed be more photoreactive.  I have been looking for a book that
explains the chemistry of brewing in more detail from beginning (pH of
Water, mineral effects) to end (the effects of light on beer, etc.)
Does anyone know of any sources or titles that would have this sort of
info?
Thanks

Subject: Sugars


I decided the hot Texas summer months were a good time to brew stong
Belgian ales.  I figured I'd better read up on the subject first;  I
started with Pierre Rajotte's _Belgian Ale_ (Classic Beer Style Series
#6).  A very interesting book w/a lot of info, but less than clear in
a number of places.  One of the unclear area is the subject of sugars.
Rajotte devotes 6 pages to description of sugars used in brewing but
left me confused.  So I re-read Miller's (_Complete Handbook of Home
Brewing_) section on sugars.  Some of what Miller says seem to
contradict Rajotte--more confusion.
   Here's what I think I know about various sugars.


   Corn sugar--aka glucose or dextrose.  A single sugar 100%
      fermentable. Adds no flavor to beer.
   Cane sugar--aka sucrose.  A double sugar made up of glucose and
      fructose.  Must first be broken into glucose and fructose before
      it can be fermented.  Fructose is apparently responsible for the
      cidery flavor in beers using a large amount of sucrose.
   Invert sugar--Sucrose that has already been split into glucose and
      fructose by acid reduction.  Has pH of 4 to 6.
   Brown sugar--Partially refined sucrose.  Produces rum like flavor in
      beer.
   Molasses-- I don't really know what the composition of molasses is.
   Demerara-- ?
   Treacle-- ?
   Candi--Sucrose that has been refined by slow crystalization.  May be
     light or dark or camelized?
   Honey-- I don't know what sugars are in honey.
   Malto-dextrin--Long sugars produced it mashing malt.  Not fermentable
      and tasteless.  Common homebrew lore it this adds body to beer but
      Miller (pg 61) says this is not so!


   The questions are:
      Can you fill the question marks above?
      Any errors above?
      If sucrose must be inverted before being fermented, how does this
         happen in the brewing process?  Is there an advantage to using
         invert sugar?
      Do you have sources for demerara, treacle, or candi?
      What sugars have you used for strong ales and with what results?
      Does malto-dextrin add body or not?
      Any suggested reading?
Looking forward to your responses, WAK

Subject: Re: thin mashes & not mashes


Into the discussion about thin vs thick mashes, I would interject
another source.  Unfortunately, I don't have my copies of the old
Amateur Brewer (under Fred Eckhardt's editorship) in front of me to
check numbers, but there was an issue focusing on the production of
wheat beers.  These were specifically Swiss weizens, which aren't
necessarily remarkable (and in fact have an extremely complex mash cycle
as I recall), but it was in that article that I first heard that thin
mashes were proteolytic.  I believe the article gave specifics on malt
to water ratios.


I don't know the answer.  My own experiences have been all over the map
on thickness and I've yet to discover any real difference in the

Once the stuff is wort, all the conversions have taken place and no
amount of tinkering with the DME itself will change the relative
thickness of your beer.  If you are _really_ getting a finishing gravity
of 1.002, it's pretty clear that the beer isn't finishing too high --
it's more likely that you are under-hopping (your bittering hops).
Could it be that you're not adding hops at all but relying on a hopped
extract?  


Another possibility is that you're misreading the hydrometer.  Could it
possibly be 1.020?  If so, then the problem is probably something
involving your yeast: you're not using enough, or you're not aerating
the wort at pitching time so that the yeast have insufficient oxygen and
poop out without ever finishing their fermentation.


BOIL the wort!  Make your best effort not to boil the grains you're
adding, however, regardless of what certain books might advise.  Better
you should steep the cracked grains at about 150F for 1/2 - 1 hour,
strain and rinse them with hot water and add your extract to the
resulting liquid.


Keep plugging away.

Subject: Chill Haze Remover


        I saw some "Chill Haze Remover" - Cordon Bleu is the name (I think) made
in Burton-On-Trent, U.K. in my lolcal brewstore the other day.  The liquid is to
be used 5 ml to 5 gal (U.K.) to remove Chill Haze.


        Has anyone tried it?  Does it work?  I have a Plisner (lagering as I
speak) that appears to have some chill haze.  I am likely to use it on half of
the batch unless I hear glowing reports....


Thanks.


Robert.

Subject: Mash Stiffness


In personal email, Rich Goldstein pointed me to the passage I was
thinking of (in fact, he saved me the trouble of typing it in --
Thanks, Rich!):


Miller writes, in "The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing":


        Another factor influencing enzyme activity is stiffness
        (thickness) of the mash. A thin mash -- say 2.5 quarts of water
        per pound of grain -- ultimately favors a more complete
        breakdown of carbohydrates in the kettle. However, because the
        enzymes are more diluted, breakdown takes longer to achieve. On
        the other hand, a stiff mash -- around 1.33 quarts per pound,
        as I recommend -- initially favors starch breakdown; however,
        as amylolysis proceeds, the increasing concentration of sugars
        in the mash inhibits further enzyme activity. A stiff mash
        favors breakdown of proteins in the mash kettle, and it
        provides one other benefit: it protects the enzymes better. At
        any temperature, the thinner the mash, the faster the enzymes
        will be deactivated [p. 128]




Also, Brian Smithey wrote to me me mentioning that he begins his stovetop
mashing with a stiff mash and then thins it out later, I assume when going
from the protein rest up to the saccharification rest.  In a insulated
cooler step infusion mash, where the temperature is raised simply by adding
boiling water, this is inevitable, but in a stovetop mash, this is optional.


This would be an intersting area for experimentation... no?


Al.

Subject: IBU's for Weissbierxxx zen


   While reading the recipies in Warner's book on German Wheat Beer
it seemed to me that the suggested amount of hops (2.6 HBU's for a
5 gallon batch) seemed too small to attain 15 IBU's of bitterness.
Especially, since he recommends boiling 1/2 of the hops for 60 minutes,
1/4 for 30 minutes and the remaining 1/4 for the last 10 minutes.
Using the formula from Rager's article in the Zymurgy Hops Special Issue


          W(oz) X %A X %U X 7462        HBU X %U X 74.62
   IBU = ----------------------   =     ---------------   = HBU X %U X 14.9
                V(gal)                        5


we get


   IBU = 1.3 X 0.30 X 14.9      (1.3 HBU's 30% utilization for 60 min)
       + 0.65 X 0.153 X 14.9    (0.65 HBU's 15.3% utilization for 30 min)
       + 0.65 X 0.06 X 14.9     (0.65 HBU's 6% utilazation for 10 min)
       = 5.81 + 1.48 + 0.58 
       = 7.87   (7.9 with rounding)


This seems significant since it is only a little more than half the
target of 15 IBU's that Warner claims!  Even if you assume the full
30% utilization figure for all the hops added the value is 11.6.


Checking the Glossary in Warner's book he uses the formula (bottom of p 139)
for IBU as
    
        IBU = H X (a% + b%/9) / 0.3


(actually Warner has a typo and his formula for IBU reads HBU =...)


where 
       H is the weight of hops in grams per liter
       a% is the alpha acid per cent 
       b% is the beta acid per cent
       9  is a factor indicating that the flavoring power of alpha acids
          is about nine times greater than beta acids.
       0.3 represents an approximate 30% efficiency rate in hop extraction
           caused by vaporization or precipitation.
 
It seems to me that since Warner is dividing by 0.3 he is in effect
assuming a utilization rate of 33.3%.  With this formula (I'll omit the
details) you get 13 IBU's (neglecting the beta acid per cent).  


Can anyone out there explain this discrepancy?  I don't think that Eric
Warner has a Ph.D in mathematics from Harvard so he shouldn't be making
arithmetic errors (sorrry George).  
The only other exlanation I could think of is that Warner
is assuming a 33.3% utilization rate independent of the time of boil
and that the beta acid content is always about 1.4 times the alpha acid
content.


By the way, I think that Warner did a great job on his research for the
book, and have found it otherwise well written and full of very useful
information.

From:  Matthew Mitchell


At the ASBMB last year, I picked up a copy of "The Biotechnology of Malting
and Brewing" by J.S. Hough (Cambridge U. Press: 1985 :their address is
40 W 20th, NY NY 10011-4211!) which is now out in paperback.


I cannot recommend this book enough to those of you who have an interest in
all-grain brewing, yeast culture, and any of the more technical aspects of
brewing.  It covers the entire process from barley to barrel, with
descriptions of how commercial breweries produce their swill.


All aspects are clearly explained in terms understandable by someone who has
taken freshman chem and bio in college.  There are plenty of diagrams which
serious  homebrewers might try as a starting point for their experiments
with equipment and technique.  There's even some economic analysis and
discussion of commercial aspects.


Howzat!?!

Subject: re ethylene and ripening


Did somebody call for a botanist??  Effects of ethylene on barley have
been studied.  It stimulates the release of gibberellin-induced
alpha-amylase from the aleurone cells into the endosperm.  In English,
that means it triggers another hormone (gibberelin) to induce the
formation of an enzyme that will convert starches into sugars.  So I
guess there's some potential here ... (?)

Subject: FX Matt Brewery


I was glad to see Lisa St Hilaire's posting in HBD #1137 regarding
the FX Matt Brewery.  There aren't a lot of things I miss
about living in Utica, but that's one of them.  I always bought
Saranac when I was a local, but when I went back for a visit, even
the draft Matt's tasted pretty decent.


I always sniggered during that part of the tour where you see
the famous 'Brooklyn' beer, the 'Philadelphia' beer, the 'Boston' beer, 
and lord knows what others being created right there, two blocks from
my house.


More important, my letter to the president, FX Matt III (I'd suggested
he not charge for tours, and promote Saranac more vigorously), received
a response that was warm, polite and personal.  I was impressed.


In the same HBD, Randall Holt asks if any homebrewers have tried
fermenting and carbonation in the same container.  I was puzzled
when I saw this is exactly what they do at Matt's (and the other big
breweries, I assume).  Is there a pressure control that guarantees the
desired carbonation? Does their 'air lock' become a 'cork' at some
point in the process?  I don't think there was any mention of priming
during the tour at all.  How do dey do dat?


prosit! to all and to all a good night
