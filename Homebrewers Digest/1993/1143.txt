Gang,
     Having seen the recent queries on fruit additives to wort I would like
to pose a question of my own.  I was exposed to a lambic framboise about a
month ago and have been experiencing pipe dreams of making my own ever since.
I am still an extract brewer, but I am interested in giving this style of
beer a go.
     If anyone has had any experience with this sort of lambic or successes
getting lighter ales "take" the fruit I would love to hear about it.  Does
one need to make the all-grain "jump" to be able to play on this level of
exotic beers?

Howdy all!


(clack. clack, clackety clack:  imagine a teletype here) :)


        In response to all the the questions about chocolate beer of late, I
just thought I would throw in my $0.02.  I made a chocolate porter recently
ala TNCJoHB's Goat Scrotum Ale and tossed a full 6 oz. of baking chocolate
into the vat.  Some molasses went in as well and the results were wonderful!
The beer has a *very* noticeable chocolate flavor that coats the mouth but
is not bitter.  Definately something interesting.  Some important words of
warning for those wishing to replicate this beer:


        1.  DO NOT SAMPLE THE BEER WHEN TAKING S.G. READINGS!!!!!!
            I am *totally* serious about this.  I made the mistake
            of doing exactly this because (to be perfectly honest),
            we were worrying about the beer.  It was the vilest,
            most horrible, foul, disgusting ilk ever to pass these
            lips.  Worse than liver!!!!! :-)  The first time it was
            even remotely close to beer was when I put the stuff in
            the bottle.  This was about 3 weeks after brew day.  Ok.
            I'm better now.  Whew.


        2.  Be sure you are not operating heavy machinery when drinking
            this beer.  It is *very* potent.  Time for more honesty
            here, I don't know what the initial or final S.G readings
            were because we were *sure* this beer was a gonner.  :(
            Little did we know this was going to be the best beer we
            have ever brewed!  Go figure.


        Now that I have imparted what little wisdom I have...on to page 2


(clack, clack, clackety clack clack...  RRRRRRRRRIIIIIIPPPP)


        Now for the hop report.  Thanks again to all of you who wrote to
me telling me not to worry about the little guys.  They are all above the
ground now and doing great.  The Hallertau was the first up, followed
closely by the Cascade and bringing up the rear, the Tett.  I am very
pleased with their progress and plan to do some fertilizing now that they
are visible.  Is it harvest time yet????  :)

Subject:  Hops growth in the N.E.


         Well, I don't know why my hops are doing so well, but
I'm not complaining.  My Nugget vines are at 16', Cascade at
15', Hallertauer at 12' and Mt. Hood at 8'.  The first three have
reached the tops of the cages they're in so they're going no higher,
but the Hood is climbing a string I hung diagonal to the top of my
chimney, a hypotenuse of approx. 25'.  I'm surprised and pleased with
the growth so far.  Not bad for a second year in the NY/NJ border
area of the country, I'd say.  The Hood only gets half the sun
the others do, the higher it grows though, the more it'll get.
None are with cones, yet.

In regards to that I have a couple of questions for the group :


I would also like to know how long is too long and what happens to the beer ?
Would it change the taste, color, or the ability to carbonate in some way ?


I have just started my first homebrew and though the instructions I received 
from the brew shop say 1 to 2 weeks the stuff in my carboy seems to have 
pretty much settled out after 3 or 4 days.  I plan to bottle it in the next
day or so but I wondered if my delay in putting it in the bottle would effect
it in some way.

Subject: Back from the dead. 1.020 starters.




Greetings to all my homebrewing netbuddies!


First post in about 9 months.  Wow!!  It's been difficult to even keep 
up with reading the HBD, much less post, even when you guys have been 
talking about me.


School's out.  Hallelujah!


The big news as far as this forum goes, though, is...every homebrewer's dream 
came true for me back in November when I became head brewer/consultant 
at what is probably the World's Smallest Microbrewery--The Tumbleweed 
Grille and Microbrewery here in Boone, NC.  (Cheers!! Clapping!! Thank 
you. Thank you.)


And how much do we brew?  A whopping 60 gallons at a time!!  Most of 
you would get a hoot from seeing the brewhouse.  It's nothing more 
than an upscaled homebrewing operation.  We built everything 
ourselves.  Conditions are a little rustic but the beer is pretty 
good.  I'm happy with about 75% of the beers that go out the door.  
And the other 25% is well-received anyway.


The interesting part of this enterprise is the fact that I've had a 
chance to put together the numbers for running a microbrewery/brewpub 
of this size and the results are rather surprising.  Even at this 
scale, the enterprise is commercially viable and we haven't sunk tens 
of thousands of dollars into the operation.


If there's any interest, I may post my reflections/observations/
calculations for this little project.  Who knows?  I might be able to 
inspire some of you to give it a shot.


Before closing, let me try to make a worthwhile contribution to a thread I
barely followed from couple of weeks ago.  (And I apologize if this has already
been said.  Last time I made a comment about a two week old thread, I got flamed
into eternity so be kind...)  Didn't see this mentioned so...
                                                           
RE: why 1.020 wort for starters?


I asked Dave Logsdon this a few weeks ago because we were having 
trouble with long ferments at Tumbleweed.  Dave says 1.020 wort is 
necessary only from the point of view of efficiency of reproduction of 
the yeast.  Sure you can use 1.030 or even 1.040 wort but the yeast 
will not reproduce as fast at that gravity. 
 
Good to be back.  Hope to be contributing more often this summer 
now that my schedule is back to normal human proportions.

While busily unpacking entries to the 93 NHC the other night I paused for a
moment to watch the open primary fermenter in the Ale Room fill. It occurred to
me that the wort was pretty dark for any of the ale which they make so I asked
the brewer on duty what I was watching. "Porter," was his reply, "we went to
ale yeast in the porter about 3 months ago. So now the Steam is the only lager
product and it is the only one put into the shallow primaries." I quickly
retired to the tap room to sample this new version. I must confess that I had
already had my tastebuds cascaded with Liberty so my palate was not in top
form, still the porter seemed to be a little less robust than in the past. I'll
try it again tonight.

Subject: soda pop


With summer coming soon, I'd like to make some root beer or ginger ale
suitable for kids to drink. I've seen the extracts in the stores which
contain all sorts of additives including food coloring. I'd much prefer to
make something from scratch if I could find some recipes. Does anyone
know of a source for recipes?


I understand the the soda made from the extracts results in a
drink with about .25% alcohol. Is the reason why this is so low compared
to beer is because you bottle it immediately and the yeast stops working
before it has time to convert much of the sugar?

Subject: re: Sugars


One thing I find amazing about HBD is how adamatly one's opinions are
presented as fact!  Perhaps this has to do with the relative anonymity
of e-mail.  Any psychologists (pseudo or real) care to comment?


Anyway to the matter at hand.  The e-mail I received after my last
"sugar" posting has left me with, yes, *more* questions.


    Piloncillo (sp?) -- some sort of mexican brown sugar.  Anybody
       heard of and/or tried brewing with this?
    re US Brown sugar -- several people said they thought by FDA
       requirements sugar had to be fully refined.  Therefore brown
       sugar is actually refined sucrose with molasses added back after
       refining.  Can any of you FDA types confirm this?  If so is there
       any reason to use brown sugar.  Why not just a smaller amount of
       molasses?
    re Inverted -vs- non-inverted sucrose:  Can anyone move the following
       statements from my opinion list into my fact list:
          a) Sucrose must be broken into glucose and fructose before it
          can be assimilated by yeast.
          b)  Yeast have the ability to break sucrose into fructose and
          glucose.
       If b is true why is inverted sucrose "preferred by brewers"
       (Rajotte _Belgian Ales_).
    Caramel -- How does the process of caramelizing change sugar?  Can
       glucose, sucrose, fructose, and maltose all be caramelized?  Is
       molasses caramelized to some extent or does all its flavor come
       from other stuff in sugar cane and/or sugar beets used to make
       sucrose?
    Maltose -- Is this a simple sugar?

|While in Bonn last October... I noticed a restaurant across the

Purely a novelty item.  There's a "Chicago Pizza Pie Factory" 
in Paris too I believe. What worries me a lot more is AB's effort
to acquire the _real_ Budweiser in Bohemia.  Does anyone have
recent info on this?  Is there any reason to hope that the whole
world won't be eating and drinking the same multinational swill
before our time on earth is up?  They said the French would never
buy fast food.  Ha!  Prediction: all of Europe will be drinking Bud 
in a very few years.


A couple months ago, I asked HBD readers to tell me why I should go
from dry to liquid yeast and got some kind and intelligent answers.
Well, my first experience with Wyeast was an attempt at a Belgian
ale.  When I bottled two weeks ago, I thought the stuff tasted very
ordinary.  But wait! after only 12 days in the bottle, I snuck a 
taste, expecting it to be fairly green still. WOW!  This is my
best batch ever and it's only getting better.  There's no way I
could have got that charateristic flavor without the right yeast.


All you who predict the fast demise of clear beer because it tastes
lousy, I hope you're right, obviously. But what did you say when 
lite beer hit the market?   It hasn't gone away, has it?  Remember what
HL Mencken said about the taste of the American public?


Finally, where and when can I get that new Miller ale (sic) that 
js was raving about the other day?

In today's HBD, Jeff Benjamin says he rinses fruit in "bisulfite solution"

why not?  I'd like to  hear from others about this or other easily available

Subject: West Virginia Brewpub


Thought I'd let you know about a little discovery I made this weekend:


Sometime since last summer, a microbrewery has opened up in Morgantown,
West Virginia (home of West Virginia University).  The ONE ONION BREWERY 
AND BISTRO---allegedly ``West Virginia's First Brewpub''---is located in 
the downtown section, down by the river.  The menu didn't look too exciting,
but my wife and I had a couple of pints and thoroughly enjoyed them.
The Scottish Stout had an especially nice flavor.   Talking with the young
bartender (who was reading Papazian when things were slow) revealed that the
owner is apparently an avid homebrewer who decided to go big-time.  They
do their own mashing, but apparently don't use a secondary...


For those keeping track of this sort of thing:


        WEST VIRGINIA, Morgantown.  The One Onion Brewery and Bistro.
                1291 University Ave.  (304) 296-BREW

Subject: PET bottles, sankey kegs, _Brewing Techniques_, etc.


Finally caught up with my HBD reading after two weeks vacation and thought
I'd add my $0.02 plus ask a few questions.


Re: PET bottles.  Some time ago I mentioned that my brother was trying to
mail some Hook Norton beer that he brought back from England.  Well, it
arrived saftely and in addition to the pint (glass) bottle of Old Hookey,
he also sent me a 2 litre PET bottle of Hook Norton Bitter.  The bottle,
BTW, was the same brown color as the glass.


Stainless is good, aluminum is bad . . . Can anyone fill me in on the use
of the "new" sankey kegs, the type with only one tap hole in the top
center and the handles.  I've heard that they are aluminum with a
stainless coating.  Is this correct?  How durable is the stainless
layer?


What's happening with _Brewing Techniques_?  I understand it is due this
month so I shouldn't get too impatient.  Just wondering if anyone has any
news on its progress.


Cooler mashing and step infusion.  Does anyone have instructions on step
infusion and picnic cooler mashing?  I've been successfully doing single
step infusion in my cooler tun but was wondering what the numbers might be
for attempting step infusions (i.e., Step 1: x gal H2O `at` y deg. F/lb
grist, Step 2 add x gal H20 (boiling?), etc.)


Finally, its easy enough to get kegs of beer at most liquor stores here in
the U.S.  Can the same be said for England.  I'm at the early stages of
planning a birthday party for my father two years from now.  We'll be
staying in a private house in southwest England.  I'd like to be able to
get ahold of a keg of cask conditioned ale.  Anybody have any knowledge of
what I might have to go through?  How long in advance would I have to get
it for it to be in serving condition?  Would I need to do anything to it?
What about a tap? 


Many thanks,

Subject: Thanks for all of the help with my bitter


Last week I posted a request for help with my next batch, a bitter.
I was very pleased with the numerous responces that I got, all of
them very helpful.  I really appreciate the help, and the
information that I get from this board.  I feel that the quality of
brweing advice is outstanding.  In any event, I want to share my latest
creation from the basement of Pirate ALE:


8 # British 2-row
 .5 #British crystal malt
 .5 # Wheat Malt
 .5 # Golden Brown sugar
 .75 oz Willamette (60 mins)
 .50 oz EKG (60) ----I had to use up some hops
1 oz EKG leaf hops (60)
1 oz EKG leaf hops (30)
1 oz EKG leaf hops (5)
Irish Moss
Wyeat #1098 (British Ale) started two days before in a starter


My O.G. was 1.046


        There are a few questions I wanted to ask.  
This is my
second All-grain brew.  Is a starting gravity of 1.046 sound about
right for 9.5 pounds of grains/sugar?  I was reading Fred Miller's
book and he seems to get these amazing o.g.'s with 6 pounds of
grain.  Also, I mashed at a slightly higer temp (154-155).  I was
told that I would get more body in the brew by elevating the mash
temp.  What are the draw backs of the extra few degrees?  Is it a
good idea to use .5# of Wheat malt to help with head retention? I
got suggestions for Wheat malt and cara-pils.  Lastly,
one suggesting was to dry hop in my keg.  I like the idea of that,
but will whole leaf hops (EKG of course) clog my cornelius keg??
        Once again, thanks for all of the help.  I'll give you a
taste test report in a few weeks.

    Subject: Cranberry Beer???/Decoction mash
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello all,


While cleaning  out the freezer the other day I uncovered four pounds of
cranberries.  Since Thanksgiving is way off I thought maybe I could use them
in a brew.  Does anyone have any recipes that use cranberries, if so would
you care to enlighten me??  Thanks.


I was reading Eric Warners Wheat book the other day, specifically the section
on single decoction mashing.  Since I haven't done a decoction yet I have two
questions, is it OK to boil the grains for 30min??  And how much liquid do
put in the pot with the grains.  Any info would be helpful.

I currently use a brewing cookbook that I made using a database program.  It 
is full functional cookbook type of program.  It offers customized printing, 
IE: ingredients or brewing process or complete recipe or any combination, 
detailed recipe instructions, brew ingredients via table choices of free form 
entry, sorting, and many more features.  


There are many types of these programs available, like SUDS.  My question is, 
is there a need for another program like this?  Would you be interested?  I'd 
like your comments.

Subject: fruit beers


In HBD #1142 Jeff Benjamin and Al Korz mention their experiences with
fruit beers.  Would you guys briefly describe your process - i.e. when
you add the fruit (boil, primary, or secondary), whether or not you
use a sanitizing procedure such as campden tablets or (as Jeff mentions)
a bisulphite rinse, and how much fruit it takes to get a noticable
flavor.  Also, I would be interested in knowing what kind of hopping
rates are good to use with these beers.


I have tried one beer in which I added 2 qts of pure black cherry juice
to the secondary and, while it was very tasty, it didn't have as much
cherry flavor as I had hoped it would.  It seemed that most of the stuff
that makes cherries taste so good fermented away in the secondary.

I have an addition to the recent discussion on light-struck beer.  Andy
Hoffmann, a friend of mine who reads the digest off-line, brought an 
article to my attention last week.  For those interested in the chemistry
of light-struck beer, look up the following:


Vogler, A. and Kunkely, H.  "Photochemistry and Beer", Journal_of_Chemical_ 
Education, vol 59, no. 1, Jan 1982, pp. 25-27.


The article is written by a couple of German chemists, and describes the
chemical reactions that occur when beer is exposed to various wavelengths
of light.  It also discusses the effects of brown and green bottles on the
light-struck flavor, and gives absorption spectra for brown and green glass.
It also provides 27 references for those brewers interested in more detail.


Hope this helps.

Subject: BREWING TECHNIQUES


I had the good luck the other day to see a new magazine at my local homebrew
store, BREWING TECHNIQUES.  All I can say is WOW!  this leaves Zymurgy in the
dust.  This new magazine is designed to bring technical information to the small
scale brewer.  As I read it it is intended for both the homebrew and the brewpub
/ mircobrewer.  The first issue (volume 1, number 1, May / June 1993) has
articles by Fix, Schiller, Haunold, and Nickerson.  I especially like the
article by George Fix on Belgian Malts.  It has a column on trouble shooting by
Dave Miller and another on beer styles by Roger Bergen.  The content is great
and each article includes references if you want to follow up on more
information (although I am impressed with the depth of the articles).  The
presentation is very professional and well done.  With luck this magazine may do
for brewing what Fine Woodworking did for that hobby, take it beyond the amateur
world in to a expanding advanced amateur / small profession world.  With good
solid technical information this magazine can build the growth of both the users
/ suppliers just as Fine Woodworking did.


BEWING TECHNIQUES is published 6 times a year for $ 30.00.  But a charter
subscription is available for $ 24.00.  Their address is BREWING TECHNIQUES,
P.O. Box 3222, Eugene, Oregon 97403,  Tel. 503 / 683-1916,  Fax 503 / 687-8534.


One of the things I like best about this magazine was not once did it tell me to
not worry,   since most of us type A, technical types worry one hell of a lot
and that why we make damn good beer.  Just for the record I have no connection
what so ever with BREWING TECHNIQUES,  I was just very impressed and it was very
much worth the $ 5.00 I paid for it.  (The copy I got was likely a free one that
my homebrew supplier got as a sample, but so what it was worth the money.)  The
only two things I found wrong with this magazine was that it was too short and
didn't yet have as many advertisers as I would like to see,  but I bet these
both change with time.

AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!


Yesterday, I followed Charlie Papazian's recipe (The New Joy of HBing)
for so imperial stout.  Call me  a beginner, but, it was my first intermediate
brewing attemp.  i.e. I used grains to add color etc, to a malt extract,
boiled the whole mess (after sparging the grains out) and ending up with
some nice looking wort.  BUT!  The recipe called for 1-2 packages of ale
yeast, and I added 2.  Today it begain to ferment about 12 hours after
pitching the yeast.  When I got home about 8 hours after fermentation began,
the thing was going nutty.  I mean it is all bubbling out through the 
fermentation lock on onto the floor.  I am talking a lot of the mixture is
gushing out.  What went wrong?  Too much yeast?  Too warm (its about 75)?
So is the beer which cost me about $30 to make ruined?  What is a novice 
to do?  I poured some out (gasp), and I am thinking of moving the fermenter
outside where it will do minimal damage.  I am hoping the cool weather
may slow down this out of control process.  


Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  If at all posible, e-mail me
at geotex`at`engin.umich.edu.  I would like to know ASAP what to do!


Thanks

Latest Zymurgy has a very interesting (and amusing) story about this:
(I am plagiarizing, go ahead and sue me, Charlie.... MAKE MY DAY!!!)


"LOW ALCOHOL OR NO HOMEBREW......
According to _All About Beer_ magazine, to get a license to brew beer in
Japan you must make a minimum of 2 million liters annually.  Obviously,
this makes homebrewing illegal.  Mr. Yamanaka, head of the Japan
Association for the Promotion of Homebrewing, is Japan's only importer
of homebrew kits.  How does he get around the law?  In Japan, beverages
containing 1 percent or less alcohol are exempt from the law.  So Mr.
Yamanaka went to Edme Ltd. in England and asked them to make a beer kit
with instructions to make a 1 percent alcohol beer.  The instructions
say to use 40 liters of water and no [additional] sugar, and brewers are
warned that deviaing from the recipe is illegal.  When the tax
collectors started asking questions, Mr. Yamananka told them to find
someone else to harass.  He hasn't heard from them since."


I wonder HOW MANY poor, unsuspecting Japanese homebrewers actually
FOLLOW the directions?!  YUCK!!

   Re:  (R)HOMEBREWING-JAPAN&KORE


A couple of thoughts about Far East Brewing...  I suppose that homebrew
ingredients are available at least from mail order (probably just
extracts, because grains might be too similar to agricultural stuff, and
be prohibited.  The Japanese are extremely anal about importing
agricultural stuff). Yeast slants are a toss-up. If you wrap them well
to eliminate the smell, then they should go unnoticed. If you think you
can down grade, you may just want to switch back to dry (gasp!!!).


If I were going to go, I'd make a care package to send to myself. Pack
two 6.5 gal buckets w/ lids, and in them put: a bunch of tubing, a
couple airlocks, all the homebrew chemicals, stoppers, a well-wrapped
hydrometer, etc. Essentially send a basic homebrew kit.  Wrap up another
box with many cans/bags of malt extract, etc. Get friends and family to
mail you new stuff for birthdays, Christmas, etc.


If all else fails, the Japanese make some pretty damn good brew. They
copied the Germans in this just as they copy us in everything else.
Michael Jackson was fairly impressed.
