    Hi all


    I just read Shane's post about finding Bud while in Germany. It
    reminded me of a funny situation while I was in London a few weeks
    back.


    I was in a pub somewhere in London (don't remember which one,
    there were so many its all a blur now). Who should walk up next to
    me at the bar but a couple of southern American boys (since I too
    am southern, I can talk about southern boys without fear of
    reprisal). Apparently, they had just come from McDonalds (with
    their Hard Rock Cafe bags in hand), and were suprised at the
    number of foreigners in that place. They were parched, and just
    had to get them a nice cold one. So, they just had that bartender
    bring them up a Bud (it cost them about $3 each) to quench that
    thirst. With horror on their faces, they realized this wasn't the
    nice cold one they wanted, by gawd, it was HOT!. Well, lots of
    moaning and groaning went on, until the barkeep gave them some ice
    to pour their Buds over. I could hardly contain myself. Well, it
    was funny at the time. I guess you had to be there.

Subject:  sour mash, yeast propagation questions 




Jonathan Knight asks how long the bottled cultures are expected to last
in the parallel yeast propagation method:
I can't say anything definite about what will happen when the cultures
are refridgerated since I always kept them at cellar temp.  Although 
this may not hold for ALL the Wyeast strains, I've had no problem with
the Irish, German, and British strains keeping for a number of months. 
Refridgeration may help them keep even longer.  What I do is I always
decant a starter when I bottle up the cultures so that even if all the
bottles were to prove unviable, I will have at least got one batch of
beer out of the Wyeast package.  This way, you risk nothing by propagating.
As the bottled cultures age and their viability decreases, you can always
use two bottles to make up a new starter.  In any case, the process can't
be any worse than making up a starter from the dregs from Chimay or SNPA
as some posters do.  There's alot more sediment than in a bottle conditioned
beer, and you've had control over the storage conditions from day 1.
Cheers,
Rick C.

Subject: Proper amount of spices?


According to Randy Mosher, who has a lot of experience making
strangely spiced brews, the best way to add cinnamon is to make a
"potion".  Soak some cinnamon in vodka for a week or two, then add the
potion gradually to the finished (but not yet bottled) beer until it
tastes right.

Subject: Racking after Pitching








I have read many Homebrew texts but only recently got Dave
Miller's Complete Handbook of Home Brewing. Some of what
Miller suggests is contrary to my current practices of all-
grain brewing.  One area is racking the wort off the trub
after the cold break.


After the wort chill Miller suggests... "At this point you
have two choices,depending on how cold your wort is. If it is
down to fermentation temperature (48 to 55 F for lagers) you
should pitch your yeast immediately.... Close the fermenter
and move it to your fermentation area. The wort should be
racked off into a secondary fermenter about 8 to 12 hours
later, to separate it from most of the hot and cold break
material which will settle to the bottom of the vessel. Also
remember that, before pitching, the wort must be aerated."


I find this interesting. The advantage Miller suggests is
that after the proper hot and cold break that you don't have
to syphon off the clear wort from the boiler, just strain it
into the fermenter. But my concern lies in the area of
racking (and aerating) the beer again after it has been
sitting for several hours, but before fermentation begins.
Also there is the inference that the yeast starter should be
at the same cold (50 degree F) temperature as the chilled
wort. Is anyone else doing this for lagers? I have been
pitching my room temp starter into about 70 degree wort, then
putting the fermenter into the refrigerator and bringing the
temp down to 50 degrees.


Any thoughts?

Subject: re beer bread


   My landlady did this with the dregs of most of my batches. The crud in
the bottom of the carboy is pure yeast if you've racked off the trub or
if it comes from the secondary (modulo dryhopping), and a slurry of this
will work well (doesn't matter if it turns into soup---you need some liquid
to make bread anyway). But her preferred technique was to take whatever
was left over from bottling (e.g., incomplete bottle which could otherwise
oxidize) and mix it with enough flour to make a sponge. Unless you've
lost all your yeast (which you'll find out when your beer doesn't carbonate)
the sponge will start rising in a small number of hours and can be filled
with flour to the proper consistency for bread dough. 
   This isn't quite like medieval recipes which call for taking a volume 
of working beer, foam and all (probably even more effective with    
true top-fermenting yeasts), but it does give a good flavor to the bread---
enough that you can taste it even with whole-wheat flour.

I've never seen this done this way. Around Boston, a lot of bars serve
Black&Tan, but that's Guinness on the bottom. (It's the only Black&Tan
the hypernationalist Irish-Americans around here approve of.) Since this
doesn't mix when swirled gently, I suspect the available Guinness (very
different from what you'd get in Dublin) is denser than Harp, which isn't
surprising. I never watched closely when they were poured, so I can't
give direct tips, but in generally you can layer a thinner liquid on top
of a heavier by pouring gently (especially at the start) down the side of
the glass.

Jaggery is unrefined date sugar. It has some light molasses notes. I have used

I've tried making sour-mashed p-guinness before and also making it
by adding sour beer to the boil, and the latter works much better.
The sour mash leaves somewhat of a raunchy flavor to the brew, whereas
simply adding to the boil a bottle or two of beer from a previous batch
that has acquired a lactic infection produces a crisper, cleaner sourness.


How much to add is always subjective.  To get you in the ballpark - if
you can smell the soured beer a mile away, add 1-12 oz bottles in 5 gal.
If you can actually drink it w/o throwing up, add 3 or 4 bottles.
If you got lucky and the soured beer actually tastes funky-lambic-like
sour, add a gallon.


The boil will kill anything in the sour beer, but make sure you clean
the bottle up and anything outside the kettle that you may have splashed
with the sour beer well before the boil ends.


P-Guinness


8 lbs PILSNER malt
1 lb roasted barley
1 lb barley flakes
4 oz. black patent
1.75 oz GOLDINGS ~5% AA hop plugs
1-6 bottles of soured beer


The whole idea is to keep the protein in the beer, so you start with
Pilsner malt & don't do a protein rest.  Mash using you favorite technique,
but keep it short - 1hr or so.  Sparge w 170 F water (acidified).  Do not
recirculate excessively.  The short mash and the pilsner malt will help
avoid a stuck runoff.  Bring the wort to a boil as quickly as posssible.
Normally I boil 30 min to coagulate the protein before I add hops, but i
in this case, add the hops right at the start of the boil, or even before.
Use Goldings.* Add the soured beer - preferably soured from a lactic infection.
Boil 1 hour, or 45 min if you used hop pellets instead of plugs.  Cool &
pitch Wyeast 1084 Irish ale yeast starter.  SG should be 1.045-1.050 or so,
unless you get spectacular extraction rates (I don't).  Ferment 60-65F. 


Now if you bottle, use 3-4 oz corn sugar and let condiiton.  If you keg, 
you've got an added element in how you imitate guinness:  Chill the beer
to 50F, & turn the pressure up to 10-15 PSI & Serve.**  Do not agitate the keg.
The beer will have a head, but very little carbonation in the beer itself,
just like guinness.


bb


* Cascades will give that funky american hop taste, if you desire, but
taste unlike guinness.  Any German hop is right out.  Fuggles don't give
that sharp bitterness.  Maybe N. Brewer...


** Normally, to get carbonation in the beer itself, you would chill to < 40F,
turn up the pressure to 20-25 PSI, then agitate or else let sit 1 week at
that temp/pressure.  This means not disconnecting the CO2 supply, since the
beer will slowly absorb the CO2 in the headspace and more CO2 is needed
to keep the pressure high.

Ignore the comment about N. Brewer in my previous note - It is
a relative to Hallertau, which does not work in stouts (I've tried
it).  But then I seem to remember Jackson saying that Guinness
used N. Brewer.  I haven't used much N. Brewer.  Hmm.
The recipe works great with Goldings.

I had this discussion with another fellow a few months ago.  I believe that
our consensus was that it was correlated with Whitbred Ale yeast.  Now,
the soapy flavor may be due to an infection of the yeast, or perhaps to
strange and "unique" esters from the yeast themselves.  Who knows.


Can you contribute another data point and let us know what yeast you
used?

Subject: cherry ale destroys carboy!


Last weekend I bottled a cherry ale.  I started with a basic
ale, very lightly hopped.  I bought 6 24-oz. jars of sour Morello
cherries from Trader Joe's; they were packed in light syrup, most
of which I poured off, so the total was something less than 9 lbs
of pitted cherries.  I put the cherries in the secondary and
racked the beer over them, and left them for about 3 weeks until
all the cherries had sunk to the bottom.  When I took a sample off
the top of the carboy, I noted some tartness but very little cherry
aroma/flavor.  I decided to bottle anyway.  When I tasted the 
leftovers in the bottom of my bottling bucket, I was surprised to
find a distinct cherry taste!  I wonder if somehow the flavor was
not evenly dispersed through the beer initially, but got mixed in 
by the racking process.  Anyway, it looks like it's going to be a 
very nice summer beer.  


After bottling, I rinsed out my carboy and stuck in my bottle-brush 
to scrub out the krauesen ring.  Suddenly I heard a CRACK! like a
rock hitting a windshield.  The carboy had fractured almost all the
way around the base.  There was no pressure on the carboy at that
point.  Weird!  Perhaps earlier handling had produced some kind of
stress in the glass?  It's a pain to lose a $12 carboy, but at least
it happened AFTER I got the beer out of it!

Yes.  I suggest you get the Hops special issue of Zymurgy.  With experience,
you can tell the difference between hops by aroma, although some are quite
close.  Unfortunately, I can't explain how to do this in words -- you have
to just practice.  The one aroma that is quite recognizable and definable,
is grapefruit -- Cascades and Centennial (CFJ90) have the most of this
grapefruit aroma, but I've noted it in Willamette to a lesser extent.

Yes there is, I feel.  Among the more subtle, lower-alpha hops, there is
less difference, but the harsher, high-alpha hops, I feel that there is
a difference.  For lack of a better word, "harshness" is a component that
is added to the bitterness -- in the back of the throat, not just on the
back of the tongue, as in smooth bitterness -- when you use high-alpha
hops.  All I can really say is to try some small, pilot batches and see
if you feel the difference is important enough for you.

That smell you describe is indeed a bacterial infection.  It's unlikely
that it would have righted itself in the bottle.  The cloudiness is another
indication that there was an infection.  I suspect that more and more
reports of infected batches will be cropping up now that the warmer
weather is here.  It is still possible to brew in the summer, but you
must be extra, extra, extra careful about your sanitation -- what worked
in the cold of winter may not work in the summer.  Open windows, damp
basements, warmer tapwater (for wort chillers) and active, airbourne
microflora are some of the reasons that summer requires much more
stringent sanitation techniques.

Sorry... what I meant was "attenuative."  Rush, rush, rush, duh!

Subject: fruit, sugar,


Several people have asked recently about sanitizing fruit for fruit beers. I
recommend using a solution of potassium permanganate. It has been used
traditionally in countries where vegetables, salads, etc are a bit dodgy.
Make a frankly purple solution of permanganate in water, and soak the
whole fruit for 5-10 min. If the purple color fades (the stuff found
things to chew up), add a couple of drops of concentrate and let soak a
while more. Drain and rinse with boiled water.


About sugar, again from several posts:


Sucrose is broken readily by yeast into fructose and glucose. The yeast
must do that before using it for food. While it can do it, yeast is lazy
and will not balk if the job is done for it, hence the use of invert sugar.


Caramel: all simple sugars caramelize upon heating. The reaction is a
complex set of thermal dehydrations that produce short polymers and cyclic
compounds.


Maltose: it is a disaccharide like sucrose, except that it is made of two
glucoses.


Golden Syrup: my local supermarket in NYC at Broadway and 115th has it
routinely on the shelves, as well as several other Tate & Lyle specialty
sugar products. I saw treacle downtown a while ago, maybe at the South
Street Seaport mall.


Jaggery: It is partly refined sucrose from the sap of a palm tree.

Subject: Equipment?


Hello All
I'm very new to homebrewing, only four extract batches. I'm looking for
some basic equipment at low prices (Since I'm a college student). I need
a couple of glass carboy's and bottles. I have seen bottles with there own
tops, look like a little porcelain stopper with a rubber washer on it. I 
don't know what they are called but look like they would work well.
 .
Could some of you out there help me to find a mail order shop or anybody
willing to sell there equipment. The local pseudo homebrew shop wants $35
for a glass 5 gal. carboy, this seams high to me. Also what are those 
bottles called and do they work?? Any other helpful hints on any brewing
subject welcome.
 .
Please email me at  wilsonrs`at`vax2.winona.msus.edu
Rob Wilson
