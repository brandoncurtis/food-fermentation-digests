Subject: Czech Budweiser


In HBD recently Richard Akerboom wrote about Czech Budweiser. This is IMHO 
one of the world's finest beers. Richard adds:
> 
> If Anheuser-Busch were to import US Bud, they would have to change

Not in all European countries. In many cases A-B got there first. Here in 
the UK _both_ companies can use the name. 


> At least until A-B buys them out, which I hope never happens.


It will happen, make no mistake. A-B are out to get the Czech company. 
I believe they already own 30% and are continually on the look out for ways
to increase their ownership. You can try lobbying A-B but do you really 
think you will get anywhere? They will mouth all kinds of platitudes, but 
when they get it they will kill the beer. So enjoy it while you can, it 
really is a SUPERB beer and it won't be here for ever.

Yesterday, I wrote this:


"However, my understanding of the chemistry is that many fermentation
byproducts, such as fusel oil and esters, are produced during the yeast
_respiration_ phase. At this point, the yeast requires oxygen to reproduce,
most homebrewed worts contain suboptimal levels of dissolved oxygen, so it's a
reasonable bet that the yeast will attempt to extract oxygen from the trub, and
produce fusel oil in the process."


This relied on memory and is inaccurate; apologies for the confusion. With
further reading, _precursors_ to these byproducts are formed, during both the
lag and respiration phases. Yeast does not extract oxygen from trub, it uses
the unsaturated fatty acids as an alternative to oxygen for growth. The net 
effects of this alternative pathway remain controversial.

Brian Bliss <bliss`at`pixel.convex.com> asks:


>Does anybody know for sure exactly what Gunness is hopped with?


Although Guinness might have used bullion in the past, bullion has not been
produced commercially in the UK since the 1987 crop, and is no longer 
available (if someone in the UK sold you some recently they were old). As a
data point: when I last enquired (two years ago) Guinness were using Target
hops, a high alpha (10%-12% depending on season) hop which doesn't seem to
give too much aggression with its bitterness. It has a respectable aroma also
and is gaining popularity with many commercial breweries. The choice by
Guinness  is based on the price per unit of alpha acid - that is, it is
cheaper to obtain their bittering by using that hop rather than others; If
another hop were cheaper they would use it (assuming it didn't adversely
affect the flavour). No altruism on their part.


Further data: the 1992 UK hop crop, in Zentner, for some varieties was
    Target      47,396
    Challenger  12,866
    Northdown   11,977
    Goldings     8,965
    Fuggles      8,124


Northern Brewer was in 10th place with 347 Zentner, and the total production
was 96,417 which is fairly typical (1991 was exceptional with 120,333) 


I also recall that Guinness use a high proportion of 'lager malt' in their
grist for reasons of economy too (I can't find my notes confirming this so
don't take that as gospel yet). It is simply that lager malt is cheaper than
pale. In the small quantities that I purchase, lager malt costs 405.00 per
tonne and pale costs 415.00 per tonne (crystal 425.00 per tonne, Roast
Barley 385.00) - prices in pounds sterling.


*********
On the subject of Guinness, I shall refer back to the discussion about their
thingy in the bottom of the draught guinness in cans. Al K. finally scotched
this momily but his description was not quite complete. In fact the plastic
chamber, which has a little hole in it, is totally empty when it is put in
the can. (No I don't meean a vacuum, I mean gas at atmospheric pressure OK?)


The system works because the pressure in the can exceeds atmospheric pressure
(remember the pssst when you pull the ring?). The can is filled with beer 
that is cold enough (0C to 1C) to retain sufficient condition and an oversize
can (440ml beer in 500ml can, say) is used. They also "dose" the beer with
extra nitrogen (less soluble and finer bubbles). Once the lid is on, (and the
beer warms up) gas comes out of solution to create the pressure in the can.
The pressure in the can and inside the chamber reach equilibrium forcing beer
(and gas) into the device through its little hole. Once the can is opened, the
resulting drop in pressure forces this beer back out of the chamber through
the tiny hole. The shock of passing through this tight constriction creates
small stable bubbles which rise through the liquid acting as centres where
other bubbles form.


Cleaver really. The last remaining problem was finding a way to purge oxygen
from the whole system (hence, or otherwise, the nitrogen momily?).


********
Talking of momilies, Jack S. descibed me as 'a momily buster in the bud'. Now
that we have been told what a momily is, I know what I was being accused of.
But then again if Jack knew me better he probably wouldn't think of me as
being 'in the bud'.


The above happened when I asked about the rationale for using starters with
SG 1.020, which appears to be the received wisdom on this digest. I agreed to
summarise the responses, but unfortunately I have little to report. The most
promising response was from Kinney Baughan (quoting Dave Logson as) saying 
that it is "necessary only from the point of view of efficiency of reproduction
of the yeast."


Perhaps I shall carry on looking at this one for a while, but lets have a few
data points. In my descriptions for making culture media, only two values
seem to appear; if you are to use (hopped) wort agar one uses SG 1.040 (hopped)
wort with 1.5% agar; if you choose to use MYGP (or similar) broth/agar then (I
calculate) the SG is about 1.005.

On the contrary, under normal conditions fermentation increases the acidity
(and lowers the pH) of wine must. This increase is typically of the order of
1 ppt (as Tartaric). The exceptions are when the must is extremely high in
acid at the start (eg >12ppt), or if there is a high proportion of malic acid
present and the particular strain of yeast being used can ferment malic acid.
There are only a few of those strains available to the home brewer and it is
very unlikely that one will be used (and then they only use about 20-25% of
the available malic acid)


As for beer, one might expect a pH drop from 5.5, say, to below 4.5 (after
which the activity of a number of bacteria is inhibited - fortunately for us)


*********
And finally, I was recently in central Florida and suffered the shock in the
supermarkets of finding that they had yards and yards of chilled shelving all
containing the same beer - they just had different names: Bud, Bud Dry,
Bud Lite, Michelob, Michelob Dry, Miller, Miller Lite, Coors, Pabst ...etc.
I was attempting to overcome the experience, when I spotted an oassis in the
corner - there were a couple of six-packs of Carlsberg Elephant. A beer I know
and I selected that one without hesitation - no choice really. If you haven't
tried it I suggest you do, if you come across it.

Anyone in NJ know where I can buy caustic soda? My previous supplier is out

"soot forms on the bottom of my expensive new Stainless steel
pot. "




Dear Tony Verhulst
This problem is best solved by a very simple method that I learned while a Boy
Scout.   The problem of soot and the burnt outsides of pots and pans is
epidemic on a campfire.   The method is to gingerly wipe on ordinary dish soap
on the outside of your pot.   On a camp fire may be half way up the pot, but in
your case maybe just the bottom.   The soap forms a non flammable barrier, that
attracts the soot.   When you clean your pot, the soot will come off with very
minimal scrubbing.  P.S. don't forget that the soap is on the bottom of the pot
and set it on your counter space, in the woods it dosen't hurt the dirt.


Good Luck --Michael Genier

Subject: California Common Beer


I just bottled my first attempt at a California Common or "steam" beer
yesterday and I noticed a definite DMSO odor in the beer (the cooked
corn type odor).  Will bottle conditioning help to reduce this over time
or will I just have to get used to it.  What causes this (I've heard
that this is generally due to slow wort cooling, but as this was an
extract recipe which normally is cooled rapidly as it is transferred to
the carboy containing cold water, I doubt that the cooling is any
different from my other extract recipes.)


The effect is not extremely unpleasant, just unwanted.




Thanks,

P.S.  In response to the current controversy of racking off of the trub,
I have recently made two batches of beer (stout and steam) where I did
rack mostly off the trub, but went ahead and pitched the gallon or so
remaining with the trub to see if there would be a difference.  All 4
beers are now in bottle, so I will report results in a few weeks.

"The second one was much more interesting and produced a Lambic that is
 remarkably reminiscent of the real belgian stuff. I had left out a bottle
 of Cherry Juicy Juice for a while. This is a commercial juice from
 concentrate which is made up of Cherry, Apple, and White grape juices not
 neccessarily in that order. The bottle had autopitched from the ether, and
 fermented to a slightly carbonated state.  By itself, it had a wonderful
 champagne mouth, and a creamy taste, with all three fruits prevalent, but
 cherry dominating. What I did was decant this into my bottling bucket and
 then I added about a dozen or so 16 oz bottles of my bad brew, leaving
 behind as much of the dormant/dead yeasts as possible and tasted until the
 proportions were o.k. I also added some unfermented Cherry Juicy Juice from
 a fresh container to spark off fermentation again. My hopes were the less
 dormant natural yeasts would overpower the longer-dormant ale yeasts. Also,
 I stirred the carbonated beer to release as much CO2 from solution as
 possible without excessively aeration. My guess is about the same ratio of 
 beer to juice as I had done before (2-1)."
 
"The results, after only four days were remarkable: A real good lambic 
 without 6 months of conditioning, without messing with real fruit, and 
 with wild yeasts!"

I am curious ... has anyone ever tried to induce a lambic in the Bay Area,

Are 'lambic' bacteria distinct from 'lactic' bacteria, and if so, how ?


The Bay Area, for instance, and California in general, was where sourdough

here, I have to wonder ... has anyone tried this ?


Where would I get a pure lactobacillus acidophilis culture to experiment

Is the sourdough made in Alaska different from that made in California ?


Is there a potential for an explosion of lambics along the West Coast ?

Subject: snpa revisited


Here is some info and speculation on Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and how
one might try to clone it.  SNPA is surely worth emulating, yet it
has an elegance of flavor that is a bit elusive.  I can't claim to
have cloned it, but am iterating toward it!


Note that Sierra Nevada Draught Ale is SG 1.048 while Sierra Nevada
Pale Ale (bottled) is SG 1.052.  The Draught also tastes a bit
sweeter to me than the bottled.


Malts used are U.S. 2-row, dextrin malt (U.S. cara-pils), and
crystal malt.  I don't know the proportions used at Chico, but it
seems to me that you shouldn't be too heavy-handed with the crystal
malt, as I don't find a pronounced caramel flavor in SNPA, in
contrast to, say, Mendocino's Red Tail Ale.  


Hops are Perle for bittering and Cascade for flavor/aroma.  Perles
are a fine general-purpose medium-alpha bittering hop, while
Cascades are signature hops in SNPA, Liberty Ale, and other
American pale ales.  


Yeast is Wyeast "American" ale or bottle-cultured SNPA.


An all-grain recipe for a 5-gallon batch goes as follows (your
mileage may vary):


8 pounds U.S. 2-row pale malt
1 pound U.S. cara-pils
0.5 pounds crystal malt 80L


0.8 ounces Perle (alpha 6.5) at 60 minutes
0.5 ounces Cascade (alpha 6.3) at 30 minutes
0.5 ounces Cascade (alpha 6.3) at 2 minutes
0.5 ounces Cascade final addition (see below)


yeast is Chico yeast


In the mash, aim for a starch conversion temperature of 153 - 155
degrees F for some residual sweetness in the beer.  As for the hop
schedule, factors such as hop freshness and vigor of boil will
affect the final beer.  To my palate, SNPA is a medium-bitter beer,
not high-bitter beer, so something like 35 IBUs seems to be a good
target. 


Regarding that final hop addition, I believe that Chico runs the
hot wort through a hopback with some fresh hops in it, so you might
rig up a homebrewer's gadget equivalent of a hopback.  Or, you
might add the final addition at flame off and let the hot wort sit
for 10 minutes with the lid on before chilling.  Or, you might try
dry-hopping.  I'm not claiming that these will produce an
equivalent effect, but they are all attempts to give the beer some
of the requisite hop flavor and aroma.

In HBD 1149, Steve Lovett asks about reproducing Hoegaarden Grand Cru with
wheat malt.  A few months ago, I posted a barley malt extract wit beer
recipe, and promised to try the same with wheat malt.  Well, the first
wheat malt batch finished a couple of weeks ago, and my friends and I are
quickly wiping out the results.  The wheat "bite" is great.  This beer
has a somewhat higher FG than Hoegaarden Grand Cru, so you may want to cut
back the malt and/or honey to try and emulate Hoegaarden accurately.
 
 
     Tamalpais Wit, v2.0
 
4-1/2 lb light dry wheat malt extract
2 lbs    orange honey
1 oz     Hallertauer/N. Brewer
         7.5 HBU boiling hops
1 oz     Hallertauer/Hersbrucker
         3 HBU finishing hops
1-1/2 oz crushed coriander
1/2 oz   dried orange peel
Belgian Ale yeast (Wyeast 1214)
 
Bring 5 gallons of water to a boil, then add first three ingredients.
Boil 45 minutes, then add 3/4 oz. coriander.  Boil 10 minutes, then
add remaining coriander and orange peel.  Boil 5 minutes, and add the
finishing hops for a final 2 minutes.  Chill immediately to 75 F,
areate into 5 gallon carboy, and add yeast.  Ferment using blow-off
method, then prime with 3/4 cup corn sugar and bottle.
 
The keys to making this beer are (1) use belgian ale yeast, (2) crush the
coriander yourself, so it is nice and fresh, (3) use orange honey, and (4)
use the best Hallertauer hops you can find.  Papazian's basic recipe is
very flexible; I've made 5 different beers so far by changing the malt
combinations, and I've liked them all.  I like this one the best so far.

I'm working on the HopTech catalog, and I'm putting in a formula for

Subject: Yeast vs. Trub, Materials List, SNPA Hops


Con Copas talks about racking the wort off the cold break vs. yeast
performance:


Let me throw this in:  A brewer friend (who also happens to be the winemaker
at a major Napa Valley winery) ran some controlled experiments on the
performance of yeast in wort where some of the break material had been left
in the fermenter, and where the break material had been completely filtered
out.  His results showed that the yeast definitely needed something from the
break material.  The "pure wort" did not ferment well at all.  Both were
oxygenated, the yeast was pitched from a starter (lab cultured) and the
tests were conducted in the mini-lab of this winery.  Sorry I don't have the
details on what he meant by "didn't ferment well at all" but it doesn't
really matter.  The point is not to worry about getting rid of all the trub
before pitching.


Al Corzona throws another chart into the ring....


After seeing Don's post, I was particularly concerned about the "severe
effect on polypropolene" because HopTech is making a Hop Back out of
polypropylene becuase of its excellent high temperature characteristics.  I
hauled out my Grainger's catalog and had a look at the list.  Sure enough
there it was polypro=severe effect with beer (with a note that beer is OK at
less than 72F).  Now a hopback really doesn't work with "beer" but wort. 
The list also contains "cane syrup" but it also got a severe rating with
polypro.  Anyway, I was concerned.  Turns out Grainger's reprinted the list
from the Little Giant Pump Co.  (this reference is actually printed in the
Grainger's catalog).  So I called TLGPC.  They didn't know squat about the
list and told me it was provided by Phillips 66.  So I called Phillips. 
After being bounced around to about 12 divisions, I finally found the one
that deals with polypropylene (they make it).  BTW, *no one* at Phillips
ever heard of the list and they guess it must have been done a long time
ago.  Anyway, after a few minutes of begging that I should be connected to a
materials engineer (not a sales "engineer") I got some helpful folks in one
of their labs.  Turns out the guy who knows the most about polypro is also a
homebrewer!  Well it was certainly a relief not to have to spend 1/2 hour
explaining what a hop back, wort etc. were!  Bottom line:  The chart is
wrong as regards to polypro.  Beer won't hurt it or react with it (neither
will wort).  This guy said that polypro's barrier properties weren't that
good and thought the chart might have been inferring that you wouldn't want
to store carbonated beer in it for long periods because it would go flat. 
However, carbonated water is "OK" for polypro on the chart.  We couldn't
figure it out.  Now I know why Grainger's has a disclaimer as to the chart's
accuracy right up front.  For what it's worth...YMMV.


JC asks about the SNPA recipe:


I'm not sure what they use for bittering (I think Galena but don't quote
me).  For finishing and aroma they use Cascade.  Lots of it late in the
boil.  And then they run the wort through a hop back charged with even more
Cascade.  They do not dry hop this beer.  If I were trying to get an SNPA, I
would do something like this:


8 lbs Pale Malt
 .5-1 lb 40 degree Crystal
Optionally a pound of carapils for more body.
40-45 IBUs of Galena, Cluster or Cascade, boiled 90 minutes
1 oz Cascade 10 minutes
1.5 oz Cascade 5 minutes
2 ozs Cascade in a hop back (or steeped if no hop back)
SNPA yeast cultured from a bottle, or Wyeast Chico Ale


Personally, I'd use a single infusion mash at 150-153 degrees.


Mind you, this is off-the-cuff and merely a guess.

Subject: Re-using yeast & commercial beer storage


Message Creation Date was at 26-MAY-1993 14:32:00
      
          Greetings,
               I have some questions in two basic areas.  Any insight
          would be appreciated.


          1.  I'm lazy. I would like to re-use my yeast as opposed to
          propagating multiple yeast colonies.  I rack my beers to
          2ndary fermentors and usually use polyclar on my lighter
          colored beers.  Should the yeast cake I save come from my
          primary or secondary fermentor?  I see problems with each:
               a. Primary will have more cold-break, dead yeast,
          and hop residue than secondary.
               b. Secondary will have plastic particles due to the
          polychlar.  (Should I use isinglass, instead?)


          2.  I've a couple questions regarding the storage of
          commercial beer (You know - that stuff ridiculed in the
          HBD).  Based upon the assumption that the vast majority of
          commercial beer is filtered and pasteurized is there any
          problem with storing the beer in an 80 degree dining room
          versus a 60 degree basement (assuming light is not a
          factor)? How about a 100 degree attic?
               Also, if I keep one 6-pack in my 65 degree basement as
          a control and then daily rotate a second 6-pack between my
          35 degree refrigerator and my 80 degree laundry room will
          any differences in taste result?  Will the rotated beer
          deteriorate more quickly?  Will a commercial beer which is
          constantly changing in temperature by as much as a 50 degree
          delta deteriorate more quickly than beer constantly sitting
          in a warm room?
               Finally, how different would the test results be if I
          chose to also sacrifice (shudder!) a 6-pack of home-brew in
          this experiment?


               I appreciate the help & information.

Subject: soot: take 2




I'd like to thank all who responded to my cajun cooker soot problem.  I was 
gratified at the response - 8 to 9 people sent me email with suggestions.


First of all, I was a boy scout :-) and I know the soap trick.  I was 
not clear in my posting - it's not the cleaning of soot from the pot that
is my problem.  The cleaning is easy.  After chilling the wort, I put a large 
strainer over my primary and pour the wort directly from the 10 gallon brew
kettle into the primary.  This usually means that I get soot on my hands and
clothes.  THAT's my complaint.


Two people wrote to me suggesting that a possible solution was to reduce the
size of the hole in the gas jet from 5/64" to 1/16" (when will the U.S. move
into the 20th century and use metric?).  I did this and noticed an improvement
in flame quality at low gas settings.  I'm planning to brew a batch this weekend
and see if the improvement is enough or if I'll be shopping for a new cooker.


Drew Lynch sent me a nice summary of different types of propane cookers
which I'm happy to include (with Drew's permission):


 "In my search, I found three types of burners.


  The "real" cajun cooker (what you have) has a single flame.  It has
the benefit of the highest total heat output(as high as 200,000BTU!),
and the detriment of no real adjustability. They also are very
inefficient gas-wise at the "simmer" setting.  There is no mixture
adjustability.  This is the cause of your soot problems.


  The "stove" type burner has ~100 individual flames.  It usually has
the lowest output (~20,000-40,000 BTU) and the best adjustability.  It
is very gas efficient.  The mixture need not be adjusted on these.


  The King Kooker company produces a hybrid of the two types(which I
have).  It has approximately 30 individual flames, 145,000 BTU and
decent adjustability. The efficiency is in between the two listed
above. To get an ideal burn, the mixture adjustment plate would be
moved when you switch from "nuke" to "simmer".  In practice, the wide
open setting seems to work well enough all the time, and I get minimal
soot marks on the bottom of my brewkettle.


  I am very happy with the model I have.  For a given batch, I heat 5
gallons of mash water to 178F, 5 gallons of sparge water to 180F, heat
the mash from 156F to 170F, and do 90 minute boils of 5-7 gallons.  I
get about 4-6 batches from a single propane tank (20lb?).  I would
return the burner you have, if you can, and try to procure the more
adjustable version.


  I have a local (Los Altos, Ca.) source for the King Kooker of the
"right" type: Fermentation Frenzy, (415)941-9289.  Where are you
located?"


Thank you Drew.




Tom Stolfi wrote that he has a _Camp Chef Cooker_ "stove type" burner
with 35,000 BTUs that will boil 5 gallons of cool water in about 20
minutes and gets NO soot on his pot at all.  He also mentions that the
same company makes a 135,000 BTU unit.




Well, that it folks.  I wish I'd known the above info before I bought
my cooker.  I'll report the results of boiling with my modified King
Kooker next week.


Good brewing,

I suggest you  get some DME and then first re-hydrate the dry yeast in
104-110F sterile water for 15 to 30 minutes before adding it to a 1020
DME starter for a day or two.  Starters made from corn sugar have proven
to make for a sizable yeast mass, but that the yeast subsequently has
difficulty fermenting mixed-sugar (glucose, fructose, maltose, etc.) wort.
It's best to start on wort.  There are arguments on whether it's better to
start the yeast on a 1020 OG starter or on a starter that is more like
the wort they will be fermenting.  I use a 1020-1030 OG starter.  I've
found that the yeast starts faster in lower gravity starters (this is
in-line with Wyeast Labs' findings and recommendations).  I believe that
the ideal situation would be stepped-gravity starters -- first 1020, tben
1030, then 1040, finally pitching into the wort, but I don't go through
all that trouble.

I had considered this also, but backed-off when I read that some people have
problems with mold in the faucet.  I've found that if I don't drink from a
particular keg for two weeks or so, a big glob of mold forms in the faucet.
This, despite the fact that I have my faucets INSIDE the fridge at 54F.
If you use the faucets every day, you shouldn't have any problems.

This implies that you pour hot wort through a strainer.  If this is true,
then you are aerating the hot wort (Hot-Side Aeration or HSA) which is
causing a considerable amount of oxidation of the wort.  George Fix has
a great article in a recent Zymurgy on Hot-Side Aeration, which explains
in detail the problems with HSA.

JC Ferguson asked a few days ago how to modify a double dorm fridge to
fit 5 gallon kegs. I did this a few years ago as follows:


The U shaped freezer was attached to the to of the fridge with 4 clips.
Remove these clips.  The freezer/cooling plate is now supported by the
incoming freon line.  I carefully pushed the U shaped freezer down and
back so that the large part of the plate was parallel to the back of the
fridge.  This operation is tricky since there is some dange of crushing
or splitting the freon line.  I however had no problem , and the fridge
has been working fine for about two years like this.

Hello folks,


I've been working on an article on hops for the Fairbanks homebrew club's

this is the case. Does anybody out there have any comments in this regard?

Subject: More soot on pots...


A number of articles in HBD 1149 suggested the tried-and-true Boy Scout
method for easily removing soot on SS pots.  Keep in mind that if your
propane cooker is burning with a yellow flame and making enough soot to
be a problem, it's also generating some carbon monoxide.  CO is
generated when hydrocarbons (e.g., propane) don't burn completely due to
insufficient oxygen.  It's colorless, heavier than air, and highly
poisonous.  In nonlethal amounts, prolonged exposure can leave you with
nausea and a splitting headache.


If you want to solve the problem and not just the symptom, try adjusting
the damper plate on the gas inlet to your cooker.  On my "Superior"(tm)
propane burner, it's a slotted disk that fits over the air intake on the
cast iron part of the burner, just behind the gas inlet valve.  Fully
open, there's enough air to blow the flame off the jets; closed down, it
burns bright yellow.  With a few tweaks, I was able to get it adjusted
for a clean blue flame through the full range between a simmer and full
throttle.  While the Superior burner is rated at 35,000 BTU, I would
guess that the 200,000 BTU King Kooker is fairly adjustable through its
full output range as well.  Good luck!
