Subject: Keg experiences (was Re: Foam With Kegs; Forced Carbonation)


My 3-tap fridge is based on 1/4" tubing, and ball lock cornelius kegs.


Maximum liquid line length from disconnect to tap is about 4 feet.


My artificial carbonation techique is to put the keg in the fridge, and
hook up the CO2 at about 30 psi once a day.  About half a week of this,
and it's carbonated.  I'm trying a new technique right now of keeping the
keg continuously connected at 30 psi - don't know how quickly this will
work.


When carbonated, I just hook the keg up to my fridge CO2 supply, which
is somewhere around 8-10 psi, continuously connected (if I don't have
any leaks at the time!).  Since I have individual check valves for
each of the three potentially connected kegs, overpressure in one or
more of the kegs is not a problem.  I just start pouring, and live
with the extra foam until everything reaches equilibrium, which doesn't
take too many pints.  If I have not sufficiently carbonated the beer,
another week or so at my normal dispensing pressure is sufficient to
carbonate it properly.


As far as moldy taps go, I just disconnect the liquid line from the
keg, and take the tap off.  This is easy, since there is a knurled
collar and thread system which connects the tap outside of the fridge
to the beer shank , which is the pipe that runs through the sidewall of
the fridge.  I take apart the whole tap, and do a little boiling and a
little rinsing to clean out the mold.


I'll clean a tap if it's been a coupla weeks, or if there are some folks
coming over.  If I get a little lazy, I just never bring up the subject
of mold with company, and they've never noticed anything ;-)

  Darren Evans-Young was happy with the temperature controller
from William's.  Does anyone else have any comments regarding this
unit?  Does this unit have a solid state sensor or the "capillary
tube" sensor?  Is the four degree differential too inaccurate or is
this actually equivalent to the Hunter and Johnson?

Subject: Hop Boil and New Utilization Table


Someone, sorry but I can't find my note, asked about adding hops before 
or after the hot break:


I think the most important thing is the boil time, not worrying about when 
the break occurs.  Your utilization will be more affected by the boil time 
than any supposed break material coating the hops.  Besides, it doesn't 
matter a whit what coats the petals (aka, but wrongly, leaves).  It is the 
stuff in the little yellow lupulin glands that counts.  I've never seen any 
stuff on the petals in my wort anyway.  There is also the argument that 
having the petals and/or hop particles from pellets thrashing around in the 
boil is helpful in getting a good break to happen.


Bob Jones commented about the work that Glenn Tinseth is up to taking 
a new cut at Rager's numbers:


Glenn and I have corresponded on the subject relative to incorporting his 
results in my book.  Until the results are in (which could take a while), 
I have taken a stab at modifying Rager's utilization chart.  My revised 
figures are based on inputs from many brewers (thanks, BTW, to those from 
HBD that responded to my request for comments on Rager's numbers), reviews 
of the literature and my own estimates.  The following should not be 
considered as an absolute (there aren't any in brewing) but more as a 
"work in progress".  The chart is about to be published in my catalog, 
but in the spirit of Bob's note and the input HBDers have provided, 
I'm willing to share it with all.


The chart lists Rager's original numbers, and three different columns of new 
numbers.  The first column is Rager's, the second lists numbers for yeast 
with "average flocculation", the third column for yeast with fast 
flocculation and the last for yeast with slow flocculation.  Besides the 
boil time and wort gravity, the effect of the yeast on the bitterness is 
probably the next most important factor and that is why I've included it. 
The reason for the three figures is that the faster the yeast settles, the 
less time it will be suspended (duh) and therefore has less opportunity to 
absorb alpha acids, so the utilization is adjusted upwards.  It follows that 
yeast dropping out slowly will absorb more alpha acids and therefore the 
utilization should be adjusted downwards.  Also, you can see that I've 
discounted any alpha utilization at low boil times.


Boil Time  Rager's   Average Yeast   Fast Yeast    Slow Yeast
           Number    Flocculation    Flocculation  Flocculation

I'm sure that I don't have to ask for comments :-) and of course, YMMV.


BTW, for those who don't know what we're referring to, we're talikng about a 
chart and formulas published in the Zymurgy special issue on hops.  Also, the 
complete formula is published in both Glenn's and my catalogs.  And for those 
that don't know, the original article had a formula error in the gravity 
adjustment.  It should have read:  


GA= (Boil Gravity - 1.050)/0.2.  


Also, the example shown is wrong.  It should be:  


GA= (1.096 - 1.050)/0.2 = 0.23.

Subject: Strawberry Ale




After reading all the articles on fruit beers over the past month, I
decided to some strawberry ale.  Fresh picked raspberries will have to
wait for mid-summer.  I had a 38 OG, 28 IBU pale ale in clearing in 
a secondary secondary fermenter. I bottled 4 gal, then added 1.5# of 
chopped and mashed up strawberries to one gallon remaining in my carboy.  
After about a week, I strained/racked off the beer with a grain steeping 
bag stretched over my racking tube.  The beer, which was once very clear, 
now has the appearance of fresh-from-the-farm apple cider (golden brown 
and opaque).  It is now in a one gallon glass secondary in the 
refridgerator 'clearing'.  I have become curious about the absence of 
strawberrys in the previous HBD discussion, or any brewing literature for 
that matter.  Strawberries are more pulpy than raspberries, but I really 
never expected the cloudy final product.  If anyone else tried this, 
another data point would be nice.  


BTW, I aquired a 3 barrel SS 'vat', for lack of a better term, that 
overwhelms my small scale. (10 gal takes up 3" in the bottom).  It is 
36" high by 31" diameter.  It has a drain in the bottom with a sanitary 
fitting, a lid with a slot for a mechanical stirrur, and is on a heavy 
duty 3 wheel stand.  My eyes got a bit greedy before my brain realized 
just how big it was.  Anybody close to Cincinnati interested can private 
email me.

I have been able to attach both the cobra tap and disconnect to 3/16" hose
by heating the end of the hose in hot water. This softens the hose enough
to get it on the barbed fitting with out too much effort.

Subject: RE: Stuck Run-off




Hi All,


  In HBD#1158, Riccardo Cristadoro asks about using kegs as fermenters.


  Some time ago, I obtained some free pin-lock kegs from a friend who
owns a restaurant.  I had an existing ball-lock setup, bought some pin-lock
hose barbs and used the new kegs for awhile, but eventually amassed enough
ball-lock kegs that the pin-locks fell into disuse.  Recently, I've been
using them as secondary fermenters for lagers with great success.
  I removed the pickup tubes, and cut about 1/2" off the end.  Prolonged
secondary at 40F produces a fairly thick yeast sediment, shortening the
tube allows me to transfer from these kegs without picking up the sediment.
I put a ball-lock hose barb on one end of a short length of pressure tubing,
and a pin-lock barb on the other, which allows me to connect a ball-lock
keg directly to the pin-lock via the liquid out fittings.  When the beer
is ready, I put the CO2 tank on the gas in fitting on the pin-lock, and
transfer the beer under pressure from the secondary to a ball-lock keg
that has been purged of oxygen.  The entire five gallon batch is transferred
from one sealed, sanitized, oxygen-free container to another sealed,
sanitized, oxygen-free container in about two minutes.  No worries about
starting a siphon, keeping my mouth off the siphon tube, no oxidation, no
exposure to airborne micro-nasties.
  The best part is that pin-lock kegs take up much less space than carboys,
I can fit three batches of lager in the same fridge that won't take two
carboys at once.


*************************************************************************


  Also in HBD#1158, Riccardo writes about a stuck sparge:


>My first wheat beer coincided with my first stuck run-off
>during the sparge.
             .
             .
>I should also mention that I used a infusion type mash w/o a mash
>out.  Do I need to mash out when I use that much wheat malt?


  Wheat contains a lot of high molecular weight proteins, sparging a wheat
mash is somewhat more problematic than one that contains 100% barley.
Stuck mashes are a fairly common occurence with wheat.
  You didn't mention whether or not you did a protein rest, but I would
*strongly* advise using a protein rest in the future, particularly if
you're not going to use decoction mashing.  Eric Warner recommends a
staggered protein rest in his Classic Style series book, that is, brief
rests at 117F, 122F, and 126F.  At each of those temperatures, a different
class of peptidase (protein reducing enzyme) is activated.  The point is
to break down as much high molecular weight protein during the mash as
possible, in order to reduce the chances of a stuck sparge later.


>I'm
>not even sure what could cause a stuck run-off except for too fine 
>of a crush on the grains.


  Lack of heat in the tun is another classic cause, and this relates to
your question on mash-out.  When mashing-out, the temperature of the mash
is raised to ~170F, and held for 5-10 minutes.  Adding heat to the mash
not only stabilizes enzyme activity, it is very helpful in avoiding
a stuck sparge.  Highly recommended for wheat mashes.
  One other little pointer.  When mashing barley, most brewers use a
water to grist ratio of roughly 1 - 1.5 quarts/lb.  When I brew a
weizen, I use 1.5 qts/lb for the mash itself, as a thick mash protects
protein reducing enzymes better than a thin one when the mash is heated.
At mash out, I add quite a bit more water than I typically use for barley
mashes.  Since the mash is finished, enzyme activity is irrelevant, and
the extra water thins the mash and helps keep it from setting during
lautering.
  
                                     Cheers,
                                      Jim

Ralph Palmer asked about sterilizing in the mircowave.
 At a microwave cooking class that came with my microwave, they
said DO NOT DO ANY CANNING<, JAMS, or PRESERVES IN THE MICROWAVE.
They said stick to boing it on a canner on the stove.
I don't know why, but suspect that there could be an issue
with the microwave not sterilizing well enough?


I have boiled wort in the microwave
in a beer bottle, with a loose cap, and
then capped it while hot, for yeast starters. It seemed to work OK,
with no obvious growie things in the bottles after a
few weeks in the fridge. The starter I made, and the beer seemed
healthy

PS: If you have temp probe microwave, you can easily mash a
   few pounds of grain in the microwave. Just program the temps,
  powers, and times you want, including a mash out, and go cut the
 lawn or something. It beeps when its time to sparge;-)

The last I heard (Jan, 93) it still isn't legal in Michigan to brew beer and 
serve it in the same place.  Maybe I am just picking nits here but a brewpub
it a pub where the brewery is part of the pub, no?  Sounds to me like Larry
Bell opened a pub ajacent to his brewery in which he will sell the beer brewed
in his brewery.  Not the same thing as a brewpub.


So either the Law in Michigan has changed in the past 6 months and I don't 
know about it or what it being described here is not actually a brewpub.  
I would like to know because there is a lot of interest in opening one in 
Traverse City should this law ever be changed. :)

Not at all!  A wire brush attachment on your electric drill will do
wonders cleaning up a burned-on mess.  Of course, you'll have to forego
your stove's enamel finish, but you'll end up with a nice burnished
steel finish instead.

Subject: Calculating Proper Dispensing Pressure


There has been enough talk about dispensing pressures for cornelius
keg systems so I thought I'ld throw in some logic on how to calculate
dispensing pressures. I have been kegging for over ten years and
learned a lot by trial and error until I had the luck to run into the
individual who sets up most of the draft systems here in Tucson.
Believe it or not there is some logic to all this and your elevation
from sea level must also be taken into consideration.


Optimum dispensing pressure is 12 lbs. at 36 to 40 degrees. For every
2000 feet above sea level you must add 1 lb. Tucson resides at 2400
ft above sea level so I need to add 1 1/4 lbs to 12 lbs to get a
total of approximately 14 lbs(13 1/4) total dispensing pressure. I
have a chrome tower draft column which will offset 3lbs pressure,
leaving me with 11 lbs(14-3=11) that must be taken up with hose. How
much hose will I need to offset 11 lbs? That depends on the inside
diameter. A hose of 1/4 id. has a 1 lb drop for every 18 inches, so I
would need 198 inches or 16 1/2 feet. That's a lot of hose! A hose
with 3/16 id has adrop of 1 lb for every 4 inches, so I would use 44
inches or 3 ft 8 in. This is what I use.


After you have calculted and assembled your system you can fine tune
the way your system pours a beer by adjusting the pressure no more
than 1 lb above or below the calculated pressure. My CO2 pressure is
set at 13 1/2 lbs and I get a beautiful creamy head about an inch
thick.


One last point is that you should keep your CO2 tank at room
temperature - not in your cooler. If you keep the CO2 tank in the
cooler the CO2 can not form a gas and remains in a liquid state
feeding into your beer and eventually it will overcarbonate it. Read
the dial that states internal tank pressure and when it is stored in
a cooler you'll notice that the dial indicator is in the red zone,
take it out and let it sit at room temperature and the dial will move
above the red zone indicating that the CO2 is allowing gas to form
from the liquid.


My draft system is in an old freezer with a Johnson type controller.
The Hunter airstat just couldn't get the temperatures I wanted.


The new magazine Technical Brewer is great! Keep up the good work!!
The short blurb on dispensing pressures was nice but it left out some
of the fine points of calculating proper pressure.

As an offshoot of the Bleach/Iodophor/SS discussion, Ulick and I have

Subject: Are stouts really thick?


Hi All,
    In response to Paul Labrie's comment that his friends labelled his
not-so-thick stout as a thick beverage, I think I may have an idea what's
going on with them:    


   When I first started drinking beer--not too long ago, since I'm only
22-- I also tended to call stouts "thick".  And in fact, I still call that
Guiness stuff in the bottle (though not so much the draught) "thick". 
   I guess I can speak from a tiny bit of medical/physiological authority
since I'm a medical student, but I don't know if that's necessary.
     I think the reason is threefold:
 1. It has to do with the strong flavor and bitter aromas of a stout in
comparison with a pilsner, or even an ale.  The burnt chocolate malt and
other strong/bitter flavored ingredients give a greater input into the
bitter taste receptors of the tongue but especially to the olfactory
receptors in the nose. Don't forget--all this burnt grain stimulus is in
addition to the bitterness of the hops. And in an ale, the predominant
odor is fragrant hop--in a stout, burnt grain/coffee/chocolate odors
predominate--and these are bitter aromas.  So even though your stout may
not taste as bitter as some ales, the bitterness of the stout is
multimodal (taste and smell), so it may seem to be more bitter overall. 
This bitterness may be manifest as a much more potent and "thicker" input
to the brain. 
   It's not at all unlike strong coffee (especially since stouts often
have coffee-type aromas and flavors).  A strong batch of coffee or
expresso will seem thick, even though the liquid itself isn't syrupy--and
indeed they are thick, with flavor.
   
2.The visual cues of a dark stout, (during the cerebral phase of digestion
for those picky readers) prepare the mind and the gut for receiving a
thick liquid.  In nature, dark liquids (eg: mud, honey...) are often
thick, so the brain associates dark liquids with thick/viscous liquids,
and clear/light colored liquids (eg: water, salt water) with thin liquids. 


3.Stouts typically have a thick creamy head, which will make one
subconsciously think that the beverage beneath is itself thick and
creamy--like a milkshake. 


   Of course, as experienced beer drinkers, we all know that dark colored
beers are not all thick, though some may be thick tasting.  Just look at
Michelob dark--Michelob with brown food coloring--or here in Baltimore, we
have National Bohemian Dark, which is an even poorer imitation of Michelob
Dark. 
 
I hope I haven't bored you to death,
             Cheers,
                 Bryan

Subject: "fermented" beans/american beer/headaches




Thanks to Jeff Frane for the info re: "fermented" (not) "black" (not) beans.  
Seems like I'll either have to go to the Asian market in Des Moines or find 
someone who knows how to make the suckers.


The postings in the latest HBD from George Fix and "thutt" re: American mega-
brews reminded me of an interesting experience I had this weekend.  A friend 
of mine (who appreciates my homebrew very much) offered me a Coors Extra Gold 
to try. So, I said, what the hell.  I was actually pleasantly surprised - the 
stuff actually tasted like it had something to do with malt!  So, I had 
another.


Now, at this point I actually hadn't had a budmilloors in months.  So I am 
wondering if other HBD reader concur with me that this is a slight cut above? 
I suppose I could be enterprising and give myself a blind tasting of 
megabrews to see if I could pick out the Extra Gold from among them, but hey, 
let's get real - when there's homebrew around, why should I torture myself?


The other reason I don't want to do this - and the reason I stopped after two 
Extra Golds - was that I got something I don't remember getting in a long 
time: a headache!  Now, I normally just have one homebrew a night.  Helps me 
sleep well, and makes me get up on time when I have to go to the bathroom.  
On occasion I have indulged in two or more homebrews at a time, and I have 
gotten warm fuzzies, or even been a little drunk - but no headaches.  (I 
don't think I can compare my experiences with really "good" commercial beer, 
because it tends to be so expensive I consider it a waste to overindulge in 
it - I hardly ever have more than one at a time).


Does anyone else have experience comparable to this?  Anyone get headaches 
from homebrew?  Is my non-headachy homebrew due to my use of the blow-off 
method (that ought to be good for some lively dialogue!) or is it common for 
homebrew not to cause headaches anyway?  Could I be allergic to the 
preservatives in commercial beer?  At any rate, now I remember why back in my 
youth (creak) I had such a hard time getting drunk on beer.  Two or three 
bumilloorses and that was about all I could stand.  Of course, maybe even 
back then my palate was crying out, "no, not that swill, please -- get me 
some real beer you dolt!!"

I had exactly the same thing happen with a steam beer.  The only common
element seems to be the high temp ferment.  I never racked off, and
after a couple of days I began to dump ice on the carboy because it was
getting up to 90 in my apt.  Within a few days of starting with the ice
two distinct layers developed just as you described.  I don't know what
caused it, I eventually stirred up the whole mess and bottled it.  A
month later I flushed 50 bottles of beer down the toilet, which should
speak for itself :-).  I think you've had better luck.

Hop pellet residue that got into my bottles seems to be making the beer

>My first try at dry hopping resulted in some suspended pellet material
getting into the bottles.  At first the beer was delicious, with a lovely
fresh hop aroma but 6 weeks later the beer is becoming undrinkable.  Is this
likely to be due to continued extraction of bitterness?  I am under the
impression that hops must be boiled to extract bitterness.  Is an infection
likely?  There's no unpleasant taste, just this very bitter characteristic.


I suspect what has happened is this:  A significant amount of beta acids got 
into your beer either from the dry hopping or the boil.  In the bottling, 
racking or some other process, you also introduced a lot of oxygen which 
has caused the beta acids to oxidize.  Normally, the beta acids are not 
bitter, but when oxidized they become bitter.


I would doubt that you have an infection.  I would also doubt that the 
suspended hop particles are the actual culprit, unless we're talking about 
*lots* of them.  If there are really a lot, you might now be extracting 
tannins, which you might be interpreting as bitterness.  But this is highly 
unlikely.  Usually you get this effect *first* and then it mellows into a 
nice hoppy aroma.


Next time you should use a hop bag to get rid of the pellet particles and 
see what you can do about reducing O2 introduction.

  I currently "keg" in the 5 litre minikegs. Absolutely unbeatable for
ease of use. Simply rinse them, pop them in the oven at about 250 for
half an hour, rinse the outside to cool, fill and plug.  I have two
kinds of tap, a pump, and a CO2 cartridge type.  The CO2 tap has a
valve to shut off gas flow, and I have found that I can store the tap
for two months without losing pressure, simply by turning off the
valve.  Each cartridge will dispense 1.5 5l cans.  I use the hand pump
when reasonably sure that the beer will get consumed rapidly.  If you
are ordering from the place in Pa, they have converted to the smaller
US CO2 chargers.  I don't know how long they will last.


  As I understand it, the outfit in Pa. has a limited supply, as they
purchased the leftover stock of a defunct brewery.  I am considering
going into business selling cans and taps. My cost is about $5.50 a
can, and $15-$20 for the tap depending on type.  These prices would go
down if I was able to order more from the importer.  Supposedly, the
original mfg of the cans was in the US, but is now exclusively in
Germany.  It would be great if we could get them made here again.

Subject: More on Black Beans (still no beer)


I checked on those fermented black beans last night.  As I remembered,
they're actually soybeans, and they are first innoculated with a special
fungus, then dried, and occasionally salted.  These are apparently the
oldest form of what we now know as soy sauce (brown bean sauce is the
intermediary step in soy sauce evolution).  But, anyway, fermented
they're not, at least in the sense that we use the term as brewers.

         I may be able to shed a little light on that subject, actually.
    About two years ago, I took part in a marketing taste test, the product
    being Miller Reserve Amber Ale (let's just say that I couldn't avoid
    the guy with the clipboard in the mall, and when he offered me beer, I
    didn't want to.)


         Anyway, I was given several little cards with the names of beers
    on them, and told to rank them (I could stack cards to indicate that I
    thought certain beers were more or less interchangeable.) I forget the
    names of all the beers; Samuel Adams was one, the rest were
    undistinguished beers. I don't remember if there were any imports in
    the list, and I wouldn't have recognized most microbrewery products
    then.


         After I ranked the beers, I was given a sample of the ale, then
    told to insert it into my ranking. I put it between the 'premium' megas
    and Sammy's. 


         The surveyor then asked several questions, and had me fill out a
    questionnaire. The word "barley" came up several times, but since I was
    not yet a homebrewer, the word "malt" did not. I knew about the
    Reinheitsgebot, however, and thought I should stress "barley good, corn
    and rice bad." 


         I'm not saying that I skewed their statistics or anything, but
    considering that I liked the beer and therefore am one of the people
    they want to reach, my words might have been more heavily weighted.
    Also, it's conceivable that there were lots of other people who knew that
    barley malt makes good beer, but didn't know how important the
    difference between raw and malted barley can be.


         So, anyway, this is possibly part of the reason that the Miller
    marketing types use the phrase "Barley" and not "Barley Malt."
