I will be in the Adamstown Pa. area on June 12 for the annual
Microbrewery festival sponsored by Stoudts brewery. If the weather is
good I want to camp out instead of moteling it. Can anyone familiar
with the area recommend a good place to camp?

Subject: William's


I have two of the William's controllers for fridges. I am completely
happy with them.  Im not sure how the innards work--as requested in
yesterday's HBD--but it does an excellent job of keeping the
temperature near to what you set.


Actually--it cools the fridge to below the temp you set--4 degrees--
then allows it to warm up to the set temp--then cools again.


I've used an indoor outdoor thermometer (the kind with a probe) to
check whether the Controller is accurate and it seems to be so.


I tihnk the thing also has a 1 yr guarantee--although I think it might
(hope) be lifetime!  Anyway--it does have a broader range than the
Hunter--the Controller goes from 20-80 degrees F--the hunter low end
range is 40.


If any brewers have further questions on this--feel free to e-mail me.

  Yep, same here, one or two Budmillors was always sufficient to give me
a pounding headache the next morning.

  Ditto again, my consumption will vary from just one to several at a
time, but regardless of consumption levels, I've never gotten a hangover
from drinking homebrew.


>Is my non-headachy homebrew due to my use of the blow-off

  At the risk of re-starting the blowoff vs. no blowoff thread, I don't think
use of a blowoff system has anything to do with this, as I use 6.5 gallon
carboys as primary fermenters, no blowoff.  IMHO, the reason the mass 
produced commercial swill always gave me such awful headaches was due to
their use of artificial preservatives/flavorings.  There just isn't
enough alcohol in 12 ounces of ~4.5% beer to account for getting me that
sick.
  On the other hand, homebrew has plenty of nice, healthy yeast in it.  One
of the reasons people get hangovers is the depletion of vitamin B that
occurs as the body processes alcohol.  Yeast is a great source of vitamin B,
and I think that's one reason I don't get hangovers from drinking homebrew.
  Comments?  Anybody else noticed a homebrew/no hangover connection?


  
                                     Cheers,

I could use a little more information here. Where does Warner say these
digestion enzymes come from, ie, from malted wheat itself, or from any
accompanying lager malt (I presume not from either ale malt or unmalted wheat)?
Secondly, does the mashing schedule differ according to whether one is using
malted or unmalted wheat (I presume the latter requires more digestion)?

Subject: Hops/Hot Break and Strawberries


To add hops before or after the hot break.  Good question.


I can't say much about the utilization factor, but I *have* found, on 
advice from this forum, that if you skim off the hot break you don't have 
to worry about boilovers.  I now do this regularly with great success.


Of course, this means that you add the hops *after* skimming off the hot 
break (unless you can mechanically figure out a way to leave in the hops 
floating amongst all this stuff).


+++++++


Strawberries:


The flavor of strawberries isn't very intense, IMHO.  I have tried using 
them in beer without any success and suspect you will need on the order of 
20 lbs per 5 gallons to get any strawberry flavor.  Once the sugar ferments 
out, the remaining flavors are very subtle.

Subject: Duties on importing Belgian malts into Can


Hi,
        I checked the following out for both myself and
        because of somebody else question. So I thought I'd
        pass the info on.


                I called customs and got the following info.


                chapter 11.07.10.10.00 covers unroasted
                whole malt [I hope this means pale etc]


                chapter 11.07.20.10.00 covers roasted whole
                malt[RB,black etc I guess]


                Duty on belgian malt is $0.0073[.73cents]per
                kg. for whole malt. Thats $0.37 per 50kg
                bag. If they actually charge you the duty
                the custom service charges would likely
                higher.


                Crushed malt is 1.1cents per kilogram.


                The duties are on belgian malts I didn't ask
                about US malts they maybe [and likely are]
                different. Also any local taxes aren't
                included but at least here in Ontario the
                items are classed foodstuff and not subject
                to tax.[cross your fingers and pray on that
                one]

Subject: Hop Utilization and temp controllers


Mark posted his "better estimates" of hop utilization. Thanks for a "seat of
the pants/back of the envelope" estimate. I don't think yeast floculation
has anything to do with hop utilization. I DO know what your saying and DO
understand the resultant effect of yeast floculation, however lets keep the
two seperate. I sure hope Glenn is doing that. I would rather do two
separate calculations.


On a different subject... Those that are looking for a temp. controller, I
use Honeywell temp controllers (yes they have the little tube connected to
them, ie. none electronic). The one I use has a single pole double throw
switch in it. This allows me to control either a cooling source or a heating
source by flipping another switch mounted in the bottom of the unit. This
way I can control warmer temps in the winter for making ales. I use a glow
coil screwed into a light socket for the heat source. Works great! The temp
controller was about $22 from Johnstone's (a local parts supplier).


What's the count from all the regional first rounds?

The law WAS recently changed (early 1993 as I recall.....help Spencer!)
and a number of *real* brewpubs are in the planning/development stages.  You
may be correct about the *true* definition of the Eccentric Cafe 
since it is at the site of a long standing brewery.  However, an establishment
in which you can sit down at a table or bar and order
a beer that was brewed on-site seems to fit the guidelines in my book.  8-) 


BTW this makes the Kalamazoo Brewing Co. not only Michigan's oldest operating
brewery, but Michigan's oldest operating Brewpub.

Subject: Clarifying Fruit Beers


After reading the recent thread on fruit beer I decided to give one
a try.  The batch history (from memory):
   For 5 1/2 gal
   5 lbs Briess 60%wheat/40%barley malt extract
   1 lb  Briess amber barley malt extract
   7 HBU Goldings (I think it was Goldings)
   OG 1.038
   Chimay Yeast repitched from a recent batch
   
   One week primary fermentation
   Secondary fermentation 4 days
   All fermentation at ~70 F


   5 lbs fresh blackberries macerated w/2 crushed campden tablets.
   Allowed to sit in bucket for 36 hours.


   Fruit put in 7 gal carboy and beer racked on top.  Fermentation
   restarted in 36 to 48 hours.  Slow but steady fermentation for
   about a week.  By then most of the fruit pulp had floated to the
   top of the beer and had lost most of its color, sort of looked
   bleached out.  I then racked under the floating fruit and over the
   sediment back into a 5 gal carboy where it has been for an additional
   week.


   The 5 gal carboy is full up to the neck and I can still see little CO2
   bubbles forming in the neck.  A last check I was getting about 4
   bubbles/hour out the lock.  SG at final racking was 1.010.  There's
   a yeast sediment at the bottom of the carboy.  The beer's a
   *beautiful* pinkish red color. But, its not clarifying.  Not a sign of
   clarification even near the top.  It looks like a huge bottle of
   chilled Celis White (except for the color).


I would like:
   1)  General comments. (Does this read like the way your fruit beers
       behaved?)
   2)  Specific comments about clarity.  Will it clarify eventually?
       How long should I wait?
   3)  If it isn't going to clarify, how can I tell when to bottle?

Subject: IBU, etc. calculations


The last several batches I've brewed were hopped according to a program I
received from a fellow hb'er.  It calculates the IBU's for a "balanced" beer,
based on OG, volume, etc.  It also calculates the IBU's that I would achieve
with certain hop additions (AA%) at a given boil time, etc.  It is very
handy, and I've had no problems hitting my hopping rates right on with this
program.  I typically adjust my IBU's on the hoppy side of "balanced", maybe
10-20% high, and I've been quite happy (hoppy).


The problem is this:  it runs on a PC and I only have PC's available to me
at work, not at home.  Lets just say I get enough of computers during the day.
I'd like a list of these formulae on paper so I can run the numbers the
old-fashioned way at home, during the brew process.  He said he took them out
of an old issue of Zymurgy, presumably the hops special issue.  Does anyone
have this handy and could post a concise list?  I could probably go out and
find the issue, but I'd sort of like to have it this week.  Thanks.


I may just try a type of easysparger in my cooler mash/lauter tun next time
(who sez it has to be done in a pot on the stove?).  Of course, if my extract
efficiency goes way up, my hopping rates will have to be recalculated!


Cheers,
Norm

  Last year I planted a rather sickly looking Cascade rhizome.  After
  several weeks a couple of weak shoots appeared (while the Mt. Hood
  hops, planted at the same time, were growing vigorously) and grew to
  a whopping two feet tall.  This year, my Cascade hops are still
  weak looking, but have grown to 5 feet tall.


  The rhizome should be planted vertically.  The shoots should bud out
  from the rhizome like branches on a tree.  They may travel horizontally
  and eventually turn upwards.

Subject: Those Lite/Light/Lyte Beers


Some very interesting information about Light beers from Dr. Fix.  I'd
be interested in tasting a lager like that -- it sounds like it would go
a long way toward explaining the popularity of American beers before
Prohibition.  When I started doing all-grain ales, I used a small
portion of flaked maize and the results were as George described.  Hmm,
maybe we should try that again...


At any rate, when the Blitz-Weinhard brewery developed their light beer,
they apparently achieved the lower gravity by Reducing the Amount of
Corn Grits!  What a concept!  And the amazing thing is, the beer is
really very good -- at least if you drink it from the taps at the
brewery.  The flavor profile is definitely improved by cutting down on
the breakfast cerealadditions.


Now if B-W would only try brewing an all-malt lager of their own...

Subject:  re:mircowave mashing 


I had a few requests of details on my microwave mashing methods,
so I thought I'd post it.


  What I do is something like this, but I'm still developing the
 method.


To mash two pounds of grain in a large plastic bowl.
Add about 1.5litres of water at 130F to grain to get protein rest
of around 122-125F.


Put in microwave with temp probe in middle of mash, suported by
chopsticks across the bowl.


Program following on microwave: (Mine is a Panasonic "Quasar")


o low power 130F
   This will slowly warm it up for a protien rest.
   after about 30 minutes clear program and program
   following:
o medlow 160F
o hold temp 160F 30minutes
o medlow 170F


Wait for the  beep, and then sparge in a sieve, or colander with a
litre or two of 170F water,  into boiling pot.
 Add extract and boil, Add hops .....






NOTES:If you use too high a power level, the outside heats faster than
     the inside, and you get uneven heating. Too low a power, and the
    temperature ramp is too slow.


      My microwave cycles temperature in the hold temp program from
     about 5F below setting to actual setting. IE:for 160F it will
    go down to 155F , add heat to 160F, cool to 155F ....
   This is a good range if you are trying to use a partial mash
  to add maltiness, and body to an extract beer.
To change the  alcohol, body balance , you could  do a 150F step,
or  use a  lower power  to ramp  the temperature  more slowly.  I
usually am  going for body, so  I sometimes  use  a 170F
water  infusion  after the  protein  rest  to  get to  the  mash
temperature faster, and then only  used the microwave to hold the
temp, and do the mash out. I forget the amount, but I think it is
 .75litre  of 170F  water per  pound of  grain, assuming  there is
already .75litres per pound of water for the protien rest.

I have brewed a combination of the "Strawberry Beer" From CATS MEOW - II
and Papazian's "Rocky Racoon Honey Lager".  What I did was make a batch of
Rocky Racoon, but used ALE yeast (I'm still limited to brewing Lagers in the
Winter).  To the recipe I added 1 lb of Crystal Malt, and then steeped 8
pints of pureed fresh Strawberries in the Wort after boil.


As the Cats Meow recipe suggested I added a few tablespoons of Pectic Enzyme
to the primary fermenter to aid clearing.  I also used Gelatin Finings
(for the first time) on this batch since it still a little cloudy after ~ 2
weeks in secondary.  It appears to be clearing well in the bottles,
but has a lot of sediment on the bottom.


The beer did turn out very well, a very pronounced Strawberry smell, and a
pleasant Strawberry flavor.  The only problem was the the primary
fermentation looked really bad with all the chopped up strawberries and
sludge floating around in it.
(I received more than a few comments about what it looked like ;^>).

Here's a data point, for what it's worth...


During the 1991-92 Sharks season, the best beer they served at the Cow
Palace was Meister Brau.  (Insert trendy umlauts as needed.)  While
it's certainly not the best beer in America (oops, apologies to Mr.Koch
and his lawyers) I generally put away four or five or six large cups
(at $4.50 a throw) during a game.


During the 92-93 season, they replaced Meister Brau with Miller Genuine
Draft, got rid of the large cups, and sold the small ones for the large
price.  Half a cup of this stuff gave me a ripping headache, so I drank
7-Up at the games last year.


Next season in the new "Your Company's Name Here Arena at San Jose",
we'll be drinking Gordon Biersch beers, which I'll guarantee are
headache-free.

They are the two names for the same type of malt, one that, while still
wet from germination, has been warmed into the saccharification temperatures
and effectively "mashed in the husk."  Crystal (or caramel) malts add some
residual sweetness (via the added unfermentable sugars that they provide),
some caramel-like flavor, some color (depending on the darkness of the
malt) add a bit of body and increase your head retention a bit.  There
are certain styles for which a lot of crystal malt is not appropriate
(like IPA) and some that require it (like Bitter).  In general, consider
the style you are trying to target with a batch and think about whether
it has some caramel-like sweetness.  If it does, add 1/2 to 2 lbs of
crystal malt.  Crystal malts come in various darknesses, the lighter ones,
of course add less color and caramel flavor, the darker ones more.

Check a general gardening book (I don't have mine here and I don't recall
what yellowing leaves indicates).  However, hops are one of the few plants
that require Magnesium, a shortage of which will cause the hop leaves to
turn lighter green between the veins, then yellow, then eventually brown.
I've been using MgSO4 (Epsom Salts) for adding Mg, but I don't know if
this is the best thing to use.  I've been adding about 1/2 tablespoon to
each hill every two weeks.

First of all, I'd like to say, that was great post.  Secondly, I'd
like to mention that I've had no problems with keeping my CO2 tank
in the cooler.  Sure, the high-pressure side is considerably lower
than if I leave the tank out at room temperature, but who cares if
the high-pressure side of the regulator is getting 200psi or 400psi?
As long as the the low-pressure side is at 13.5 or whatever, we're
happy.

I have a theory on this.  Just for the record, the first (and last) time I
had Coors Extra Gold, I got a splitting headache.  I've never gotten one
from my own homebrew.  I had thought that certain beers gave me headaches
and certain ones didn't.  Then, after a long break from a particular Belgian
beer that I had often enjoyed without a headache, I had one, just one and I
got a headache from it.  Beers that have given me headaches include Bud,
Lowenbrau (US), Leinenkugel and Samuel(tm) Adams(tm) Boston(tm) Lager(tm).


Here's my theory:  Each brand of beer has a considerable amount of ethanol
and smaller amounts of higher alcohols, in different proportions.  I
theorize, that if the human body has not dealt with a particular higher
alcohol for a while, it has trouble with it and you get a headache.  Once
you get used to it, it doesn't bother you, unless you don't have any for
a while.

In HBD # 1159, Jonathan G Knight <KNIGHTJ`at`GRIN.EDU> writes about getting
headaches from industrial beer of the Bud/Miller (or in Canada,
Molson/Labatt's) variety.  I can only say yes, yes, yes, I concur exactly. 
It's one of the best reasons to go for natural brews, either homebrewed or
commercial.  Another thing that I find happens with industrial beer is that
I always get stuffed up after a few bottles.  Anybody else find that?  And
of course, there's no comparison in the hangover department:  industrial
brew is a virtual death-sentence for the morning after a bout of extreme
indulgence.  I truly do not think these are placebo effects, but I would be
perfectly willing to participate in a properly conducted double-blind
experiment if someone is willing to buy the beer!

Subject: How Long do Hops Float?


I currently dry hop during secondary fermentation in a soda keg.  My hops are
placed into a hop bag that is dropped into the keg.  I want to get away from
using the bag.  However, since I do not have a filter in the bottom of the
keg, and don't want to add one, I am concerned that the hops will clog the 
dip tube in the keg.  This assumes, however, that they sink to the bottom
of the keg during the 7-10 days they spend in the secondary.  So how long
will they float?


Thanks,

Subject: Source of Hop Util. Numbers


If I remember correctly, the data given by Rager in Zymurgy (Special Hop Issue)
as base hop utilization was actually derived from Eckhart's Essentials of beer
Style. Rager merely sketched a line through the three broad ranges of time and
temperature given by Eckhart, and said as much in his article. So, really, most
of the blame for the current numbers should go to Eckhart. In any event, we
still need to have some one get some real utilization data from actual small
scale runs. 


I don't think the source of the gravity adjustment equation in Rager's article
was given, though. Glenn Tinseth's catalog (Thanks, Glenn, nice job!) gives a
different equation. The reference gravity is 1.040 vs 1.050, and the adjustment
is not a function of the base utilization (boil time) as is Rager's. Maybe
Glenn (and/or Mark Garetz) could shed some light on the sources and differences
between these adjustment factors.


Also on this subject, I would like to coin a new unit, the EIBU, for Estimated
IBU. Since IBU's, strictly speaking, must be measured in the finished product,
what we are doing with calculations like the above is estimating what (we hope)
the IBU's will be. Presently, recipes which give bitterness in IBU's are
stretching the truth a little.

Monday night, I bottled Tom Childers' Wheat Berry that appeared in HBD 1144.  
This is one of the nicest tasting beers I've ever had.  It has a nice 
assertive berry taste to it and a good balance with the hop bitterness.  
The wheat is evident, but is definately taking a back seat to the berries.


I had to modify the recipe a little because I was unable to get light wheat 
DME.  For those who missed it, here is the recipe again.  


for 5 gallons:


        5.5 lb                light dried wheat malt extract  *
        1.5 oz                Hallertauer or Northern Brewer (boiling), 7 HBU
         .5 oz          Halleertauer Hersbrucker (finishing), 2-3 HBU
        24-36 oz         frozen raspberries
        16 oz                frozen blackberries **
         1 tsp                vanilla extract
                        Belgian ale yeast (Wyeast 1214)
*  I used 7lb Briess Weizen extract (65% wheat/35% barley)
** I used 1 pint fresh blackberries


Thanks Tom again for a great recipe.  




Does anyone have any other recipes using fruit?  Last summer, Boston (no TM) 
Beer  Works had a great watermelon ale that I was thinking of giving a try.
I'm  considering doing a peach something later in the summer when the peaches

Spencer Thomas asked how he could collect yeast from his primary fermenter and
keep it sterile or as uncontaminated as possible.  I would suggest that he keep
his yeast in a plastic container that can be sterilized with chlorine or someth
ing.  Before he uses it, it can be acid-washed with food grade phosphoric acid.
You take the ph down to 2-2.3 by adding acid to the yeast slurry.  If you go to
o low, you can add water to buffer the ph back up again.  Leave the yeast like
this for two hours and then pitch it.  Acid washing seems to be either liked or
disliked by people, and can be controversial to some.


Hope that this helps.

helped but commercial jiz is what kept me from drinking a lot when I did
not know any better. I do not always use a blowoff for my homebrew and still
do not get as severe headaches. But I also do not drink 7 usually. Maybe
the headaches were from the Pirodi cigars we were smoking. Who knows?

Subject: Questions for the Oracle


I'm new to this forum, so please accept my apologies if my questions seem
ignorant or redundant.


1) Is there an inexpensive source of malt extract in the USA ?  Part of what
        piqued my interest in homebrewing was the low price of canned
        malt extract in England (~$5-7 USD).  Prices are about double
        here.  I'd be willing to purchase large (50 lbs. or so) bulk
        quantities.   I realize that mashing from grain is the 
        cheapest, but I'm not ready for that yet.


2) Is there a market for used small scale brewing and kegging equipment ?
        I've checked our local newspaper want ads, the local home and
        microbrew newsletter ("The Celebrator"), and stores which sell
        used restaurant equipment with no luck.  In particular, I'm
        looking for a used CO2 bottle, regulator, and hoses.  Ultimately, 
        SOMEONE must want to get rid of their old equipment.


3) I'd like to experiment with adding different sugars to my wort,
        particularly brown sugar or molasses.  Has anyone tried these ?
        Any recommendations on quantities to try ?  How about other
        sugars and their effects ?  Anyone tried dissolving a pack 
        after dinner mints into their wort ?  Just kidding about
        the last one !!  You can stop grimacing now.


4) I realize that sterility is very important.  All of the procedures
        that I've read mention that during racking, a siphon should 
        be used to transfer the fermented wort.  However, I have
        yet to figure out how to start a siphon without getting my
        mouth on the end of the hose.  One procedure even specified
        "suck on the open end of the hose until you get a mouthfull
        of beer."  Even though I brush twice a day, I still worry that 
        I might contaminate through this contact.  Is there any way to 
        start a siphon without risking the contamination ?  Or am I 
        just being too paranoid ?  Will my batch be ruined ?  And how 
        do you know that the light in the fridge goes out when you close 
        the door ?


OK, so now it must be obvious that I'm a neurotic miserly penny pinching
flake.  What variety of beer would best fit my personality ?
