Subject: WANTED: Fuller's, Full Sail recipes


I'm new to this list and generally new to home brewing, though I have
much experience imbibing.  I'm looking for recipes for two of my favorite
beers, Fuller's Ale, and Full Sail Golden.  There's a Full Sail Amber in
Cat's Meow 2, and although it is an excellent beer (after at least a month
in the bottle) it is pretty far from Full Sail Amber (except the color is
right on).  I would prefer all grain recipes, but I'll certainly take what
I can get.  I'm not sure whether posting your responses (I hope there are
responses) to the list is appropriate or not, but you can always contact me
directly.


So far I'm enjoying the list, though there is considerably more
of it than I had anticipated.  I have noted that a lot of requests
for brewpubs in various locations are posted, and just for the
record, I live in Seattle where there are many excellent brewpubs,
microbreweries, and ale houses.  I would be happy to recommend
some if anyone is traveling through.

        I read the appendix concerning Lambic homebrewing in Papizian's new
edition of the Joy of Homebrewing, and it sounded very interesting.  Basically
he suggests warming your dissolved malt extract, pouring into a fermenter,
adding some crushed malted barley (to contribute bacteria), and allowing to
stand overnight causing souring.  The next day you put this back into your
brewpot, and brew as normal.  He suggests fermenting with regular ale yeast
and then adding Brettanomyces lambicus and bruxilles.


        Has anybody actually tried his method.  I've been quite successful
with many of his other methods.  As I only have the time to do extract
brewing, his method sounds interesting.


        Does anybody know of any sources to purchase the lambic cultures?
I know that Alternative Garden Supply (800-444-2837) has Pediococcus 
cervisiae and Brettanomyces lambicus.  They sell for $7.45 each plus
shipping (I don't know how much the shipping costs).  Is this a reasonable
price or can I find a better price elsewhere.


        Also, if I wanted to experiment and try some small batches, how long
can I keep the unused portion of the cultures if kept in a refrigerator.

Subject: Pressure/temperature relationship


Someone a couple of issues ago asked what would be the proper pressure to
get the same volume of CO2 at a temperature of 70F.


At the risk of getting technical, there is an easy solution given by the
ideal gas law.  Holding volume and mass constant, the pressure is equal to
the original pressure times the new temperature all divided by the original
temperature.  That is:


P2 = P1*T2/T1


This does not take into account the solubility of the CO2 in the beer, but
it should be close enough for your needs.

Subject: HBD soul-searching




In response to Martin Lodahl's post on advertising (and the recent discussion 
on same), I find the HBD to be one of the best sources on homebrewing 
techniques, gadgetry, etc, largely because of the sheer amount of information 
as well as the varying backgrounds of the contributors and the give-and-take 
nature of the forum.  I am not myself a terribly advanced brewer, and as such 
I wish to point out that Martin's concern for the new brewers taking HBD as 
gospel (with regard to infomercials etc.) is well worth noting but perhaps 
overemphasized.  From the moment I started reading this forum it was 
perfectly obvious to me that not everyone knew what they were talking about 
(with all due respect, y'all).  I would think it would be absolutely foolish 
to read one post on the HBD about any product and run right out and buy the 
thing.  Personally, I prefer to wait for the same topic to recycle itself two 
or three times (an inevitability here) to consider the subject adequately 
before making any decisions involving the purchasing of equipment.  In the 
meantime, I still make pretty good beer!  Also, I personally don't mind 
having merchants and manufacturers as contributors, as I find their 
perspectives valuable; and I'd rather have a straight-out commercial than an 
insidious thinly-veiled info-mercial, as long as it is done BRIEFLY and IN 
GOOD TASTE.  The taste issue seems to me to be the central one, and many of 
us obviously have differing ideas as to where the boundaries of good taste 
may be; but here I would say that if the digest is to continue to be 
successful, we should continue to be self-policing in this area.  The bottom 
line?  I have to throw my hat in the ring with those who do not favor a "ban" 
on any advertising in the HBD.  At the same time, the "industrialists" among 
us have to understand that they need to make their comments here within the 
boundaries of brevity and good taste, or folks like me may be turned off and 
become quite uncharitable with respect to the leeway given to commercial 
considerations.


Regarding Edward Croft's complaints about overly-technical posts, I have to 
disagree, for reasons similar to those which cause me to be lenient toward 
the commercially-inclined.  It has also been perfectly obvious to me since I 
started reading the digest that there is FAR more information in here than I 
will ever use.  So if some chemists want to get into an arcane discussion I 
don't understand very well, it's O.K. with me.  I can either flip past the 
articles in question, or just scan for the conclusions without wading through 
all the data.  No, I haven't seen anything to make me change my mind about 1/
4 cup chlorine bleach per 5 gallons either, but I am happy that the recent 
discussion has made me re-think that aspect of my technique a bit.  The 
bottom line?  I am damn glad that there are a lot of people reading and 
posting to the HBD who know a lot more than I do!  That's why asking 
questions to the combined wizardry of the HBD can be so fruitful.  If the 
people who know more than I do (PWKMTID?) were to be constrained to talk down 
to my level all the time, what would be the point of their contributing to 
the digest?  They are in it for their own edification as well as mine.


To summarize: for me, the more information in the HBD, the better.  I don't 
care whether the info comes from those with commercial motives or those with 
Ph.D.'s in organic chemistry.  In it's present format and tone, I find I can 
sort out the info I can use pretty well.

There seems to be an abiding interest in maple syrup in the HBD.  I haven't 
done it, but have often thought of priming a light ale with it.  I'm not 
crazy about using large amounts in the boil because of the cost and because 
it seems that such a delicate flavor would be destroyed that way.  Can 
anybody report on how much maple character is imparted by priming, and how 
much syrup to use for this procedure?

I have a friend who was given an upright freezer with fixed shelves
(cooling elements).  What he did was remove the door and build an extension
out of wood and insulation.  It is now about 2.5 times as deep.  The
original shelves in the back of the freezer now hold beer and wine bottles
and kegs and carboys are in the front extension part.  I think he put
one shelf in the middle of the extension so he could have two levels of
kegs and carboys (I only looked in it once).


The original freezer has no trouble keeping the larger volume cool enough
for fermenting (ales and lagers).

I'm currently setting up a kegging system for my beer and I was wondering if 
there was any reason why I can't use my O2 regulator from my oxy/acetylene
setup. If threads are the only problem then I could come up with an adapter
but I don't know if there is any difference in the regulator itself.


I was also wondering how long a 5 lb CO2 bottle lasts. I picked up a catalog 
from superior and there was quite an array of different size bottles.




Thanks for all of the tips/suggestions/help that comes from this forum.

I personally enjoy all types of posts from the most basic beginner questions
to the yeast metabolic pathway posts.  Restricting posts to only practical
information (i.e. excluding theoretical discussions or the science of brewing)
would be a great loss to most of us.  Some beginners will always be overwhelmed
by highly technical discussions and some veterans will always be bored by
questions like "why should I aerate my wort?"  However, unless we continue
to cater to both beginners and experts:


1. we'll lose the experts who answer the beginner and intermediate questions, &


2. we'll lose the beginners who will be tomorrow's experts.

This is what should be done in all cases of high-tech disagreement.  As soon
as we see an issue getting to be debated on the digest, let's take the issue
off-line, debate via email, come up with a resolution and then post that.

Yes, but I think you have it backwards.  If the beer is foaming, then either
the beer is overcarbonated, or there is too much pressure when the beer
comes out of the tap -- you therefore need to INCREASE the pressure
loss through the tube.  Either increase the length of the hose or
decrease the inside diameter.  A very good writeup on this whole subject
is in the 1992 AHA National Competition Transcripts by Dave Miller.
Just to summarize his article, the proper way to design a kegging system
is:


1. choose your beer temperature and the amount of carbonation you want,


2. read the proper CO2 pressure from the table in the article or from HBD
backisssues,


3. account for pressure drops across valves and set your CO2 regulator
accordingly,


4. subtract the losses for faucets and towers from the keg pressure,


5. subtract the losses for keg-to-faucet head (the height difference),


6. subtract the losses for altitude (see HBD backissues), and finally


7. determine the proper size and length of hose so the total loss through
the liquid line is equal to the keg pressure.


Another alternative is to do steps 1, 2 and 3 above and then use any
hose length and diameter you want, but add an adjustable restriction in
the liquid line (e.g. an plastic pinch clamp), near the keg, and use
that to create the proper amount of loss in the liquid line.


Regarding force carbonation, you can begin at a higher pressure, but in
eventually, you will need to use the tables to determine what pressure
you need to use for the temperature you've chosen.  Be careful when
you lower the pressure at the gauge (release the pressure in the keg
first) or you will get a lot of foam and some may travel back up your
CO2 line towards the regulator.

At 90F, Wyeast #1007, German Ale, would probably have completed
fermenting an average-gravity wort batch, which CITSnow is.  3 days
is not an uncommon fermentation time for such a warm temperature.
If you can, try to use a lower temperature since the likelyhood
of off-flavors is increased as the temperature increases.  90F
will not kill your yeast unless it is a sudden increase from, say,
50F.  By the way, a quick, violent fermentation has been called
a "Flash Ferment."

Every judge has their preferences, but the bottom line should be the
style descriptions for the particular competition.  Most competitions
simply use the AHA guidelines.  To the best of my memory, the AHA guidelines
say that a hop nose is acceptable in an IPA, but not required.  Personally,
I like IPAs with a hop nose (within reason) and if I was judging two beers
that were identical in every other way, I would score the one with hop
nose a bit higher.  In general, I feel that if a style says that hop nose
is acceptable, the beer will score higher if it has a reasonable amount of
hop bouquet.

   I, for one, enjoy the input these scientists  {create and share with the
HBD. As an English and Comp Sci major, I don't have near the expertise
to calculate flavor profiles or create/cretique mathamatical formulas

Great stuff! It is said: Farmers make wine; Engineers make BEER! This is

Subject: Legalizing Homebrew


In HBD 1171 Dick Dunn asked when (exactly) was homebrewing legalized. 
Although he asked for e-mail replies, I did the research so thought I'd
take the credit;-).


26 United States Code sec.5053(e) reads, in part, "Beer for personal or
family use.-- ... any adult may, without payment of tax, produce beer for
personal or family use and not for sale."  The section goes on to mention
limits (essentially 100gal/person, 200/household).  This was enacted as
part of an excise tax amendment, Public Law 95-458, 92 Stat. 1255,
sec.2(b)(1).  The legislation was signed by President Carter on October
14, 1978 (124 congressional Record 38781).  Although I don't have the
exact time the President signed it, it essentially became effective
retroactively to the first moment of the day he signed the legislation
(see Sutherland, _Statutory Construction_,sec.33.10 and 1 USCA sec.106b,
note 3).


Also in HBD 1171 Edward Croft calls for less technical postings.  While
much of the idophor/chlorine concentration thread was above my head, I
have no objections.  I like to see a variety of information at all levels.
 If I don't want to read about blueberry wheatbeer maybe someone else does.


Finally, I'd like to second Martin Lodahl's comments regarding the
commercial aspects of HBD postings.  There are several contributors who
have a finacial stake in the homebrew market who manage to keep their
postings limited to bettering the process of homebrewing without pushing
their products.  I, who have no financial interest, would feel comfortable
recommending a product if I felt it improved my beer, but I might get a
little squeemish about it if I was a close personal friend of the
producer.

Whoa, pardner! Unless I missed something, the sentiment discussed
was that it was OK to mention products by name, and to share
information about them, perhaps even to announce the availability
of a new product. I don't recall anyone saying that use of the HBD
as a free advertising medium is an OK practice.

Jim Busch asked about the possibility of using Westmalle yeast.


Westmalle is bottled with a very unattenuative bottling strain and
not the primary fermentation strain.  It would not be usable for
much else besides bottling.

Styrian Goldings are neither noble nor are they Goldings, actually.
The only three noble hops (this was confirmed from various sources
in the Brewer's Forum) are Hallertauer, Tettnanger and Saaz.  Styrian
Goldings are actually a Slovanian variety of Fuggles.  They are a
distinct hop in every sense from both Fuggles and Goldings, but are
not related to Goldings other than by name.

You are right in every sense except what is driven off (even your memory
has not failed you -- it is SMM).  It's the DMS that's created that is
driven off in the boil and during the vigorous part of the ferment,
although I don't think that either SMM or DMSO (the two compounds that
DMS can come from) are gasses.

Subject: pop bottles


I have seen postings here and in rec.crafts.brewing that mention using
plastic 2-liter pop bottles for bottling beer instead of regular old
glass bottles.


I bottled one 2 liter bottle worth of my latest, just for an experiment.
If it works out, I may do it again.


My question is, how successful is this?  When you pour out of the bottle,
doesn't all the sediment get kicked up into the beer when you put it
back?  What can you do to avoid this?  Also, doesn't the beer go flat
after resealing like pop would?  I have a pump gizmo that is supposed to
keep pop from going flat (you screw it on instead of the cap and pump
air in to pressurize the bottle).  Is this gizmo necessary?

Subject: Re : Belgian triples


Belgian triples are not a style I brew myself, but there is an interesting
issue of when to add the sugar, if any. With my wines, I've got into the habit
of adding a concentrated syrup on about day 5 of the ferment. I may be deluding
myself, but I fancy that I get a smoother result that way (ie, fewer byproducts
of fermentation). Of course, these byproducts could be just want you want with
some styles of brew.

Yes, I was the one who complained about American Eagle.  But there 
were no follow-ups, so maybe it's just me.  On the other hand,
the yeast starter I used last had SG=1.040 and FG=1.000, or

        between 45F and 80F spoil the flavor ?"


I can't answer the flavor question but I do have a solution for the fridge
space.  I bought a small 1.7 cu. ft. (it's long past time for the U.S. to
go metric) "dorm sized" fridge and a cold plate.  A cold plate is a bunch of
stainless steel tubing buried in about 15 pounds of casted aluminum.  
I keep the keg outside the fridge an have a 1/4" line going into the fridge
which is hooked up to the cold plate.  The out line from the cold plate
is 8 feet of 3/16 tubing attached to a cobra tap mounted on the fridge door.
The beer is cooled on demand.


Why 8 feet of 3/16 tubing?  For a keg to maintain 2.5 volumes of CO2 (medium
carbonation) at room temp requires about 29 psi of pressure. The long tubing
is needed to drop the pressure to the proper dispensing pressure so that you
don't get too much foam. 8 feet drops the pressure by 24 pounds and the cold
plate and the tap drops the rest.


I want to thank John Francisco for his article of a few weeks ago recommending
the use of 3/16 tubing to "gracefully" reduce pressure.  I was skeptical
but admit that it worked better than I could have imagined.  It turned my
glass of mostly foam into a proper glass of beer with a nice head.


Also, thanks to the 10 or so people who supplied me with CO2 saturation tables
when I requested them on HBD.  This is a GREAT forum.

Subject: Defending your cherries


My parent's cherry tree bore fruit this year for the first time that I
can remember.  I also eagerly awaited the ripening, thinking of a nice
cherry brew.  I ran into my mom a
couple weeks ago and she told me the tree was picked clean overnight -
not a single cherry left.  She was understandably angry and thought
someone came and took them.  She considered calling the police ( Please
help me officer, someone picked my cherries in the backyard last night
and I'm pretty darn upset about it), but couldn't decide how to phrase
it so she would be taken seriously.  A relative from Michigan said it
was birds and draping the tree with cheescloth would do the trick.  I'm
glad the previous poster decided that 2x4's wasn't such a good idea. 
Sounds like an engineer with tunnel vision - it happens to the best of us.


On another note, regarding forced aeration.  Any of you SCUBA divers out
there might consider that dry, clean, and filtered air in your tank. 
Your low pressure bouyance control inflator attachment might be adapted.
I wouldn't go buy a SCUBA tank to aerate your wort, but if you've got one...

Subject: high-gravity brewing


high-gravity brewing is, I think, very common to beginning brewers.  For
four years, I brewed 5 gal. batches in a 4 gal SS pot from Costco.  I could
boil up 3.5 gal of wort, but pre-boiled 2 gal. of water and added it to the
fermentor prior to boiling the wort.  My Barleywine is fine recipe in the
current issue of Zymurgy is testiment to the fact that you can brew prerfectly
good beer with this method.  I have freinds who still brew this way (some with
even smaller brewpots) and they are making very drinkable brew.


When I went all-grain, I bought an 8 gal. enameled pot and wouldn't go back.
The old pot now boils mash & sparge water.  The two biggest effects I've
seen from high-gravity boils are increased carmelization and decreased hop
utilization.  But IMHO, high-gravity brewing is a perfectly acceptable way
of getting by with a small brewpot or increasing the batch size without
investing further in equipment.

From: R_GELINAS`at`UNHH.UNH.EDU (Russ Gelinas)
Subject: high gravity brewing


  The question I have re. high gravity brewing is whether it is
better to dilute before fermentation or after.  The main difference
as I see it is the effect of high gravity wort on the yeast, moreover
on the yeast by-products.  Maybe I have this wrong, but doesn't
high gravity affect yeast in the same way as high temperature, ie.
increased production of esters, phenols, etc., all those "fruity
and spicy" things?  Another factor is that alcohol level in the
high gravity fermentation may kill the yeast, leaving a high
final gravity.  This may actually be a good thing, as the subsequent
dilution will not result in a beer that is too dry.


  As a data point, my last batch was a high gravity ferment, split
between Belgian ale yeast and Wyeast steam beer yeast.  Both fermented
from 1.060+ down to 1.014.  The Belgian was diluted with .5 gallons
of water at kegging, the steam had 2 gallons added.  Both were very
favorably received.  I think I posted the recipe in the HBD a week or
2 ago.

Yes, Glenn, but you didn't mention how to do this... the easiest way is
to boil and cool the water and then siphon it around as if it was beer
(so you don't re-introduce the O2 you boiled out).

I used canned cherries once and there was no aroma left in them.  I think
that fresh is the way to go.  By the way, to make 15 gallons of raspberry/
cherry beer, I made up 10 gallons of light ale and then added 5 lbs of
blanched frozen cherries and 5 lbs of blanched frozen raspberries into
each of three 5 gallon fermenters.  I then siphoned 3.3 gallons of the
light ale into the three fermenters.  USE A 1.25" BLOWOFF TUBE OR YOU
WILL HAVE AN EXPLOSION THAT IS NOT VERY PRETTY (RED GUNK ON THE CEILING)!
Incedentally, raspberries are much more flavorful than cherries and the
cherry flavor was not really noticable.  13# of cherries in a 5 gallon
fermenter is what I used for my pKriek.  So for cherries, I recommend
about 3# per gallon of base beer and for raspberries, about 2# per gallon
of base beer.

I never thought I'd be disagreeing with Kinney and defending Jack, but
I think that Dan took the first swipe at Jack when he started distributing
a test that compares the Corona with the MaltMill and the Philmill.
In the test, Dan uses a non-adjustable MaltMill and the results appear
to show the MaltMill as being about par with the Corona and the Philmill
about par with a textbook crush.  I don't think that Jack literally meant
to say Dan was dishonest.  I've spoken with both Dan and Jack about each
other's mills and there is definately a rivalry going.  The good part is
that the consumer will be the ultimate victor in this battle -- more
competition means either lower prices or better quality products or both.
