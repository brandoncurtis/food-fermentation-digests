Subject: Re: Electrim bin


There was a query last about boiling in Electrim bins. I have
the same problem, namely that the thermostat cuts the power too
frequently when boiling, so that the wort never quite reaches
a rolling boil. I got around this by by-passing the thermostat.
The element socket on my bin (I bought this 10 years ago, here
in the UK - yours may be different) fits a standard kettle plug.
I connected this to this mains. The only risk is that the element
is not designed to take continuous power, and heat transfer from 
it may also be reduced by burnt-on sugars. However, I've only had 
one disaster so far - the element failed during a boil, and I had
to boil the wort in 1 gallon batches on the stove. Moral: always
carry a spare.


Hope this helps

Subject: attenuation and my $.02


Ok fellow home brewers...(remember this phrase I'll get back to it), I
have read Papazian in depth and been reading the HBD for about a month
now and I have yet to get a definition of attenuation...something to do
with the production from yeast? Please email me your responses on this
question - if there's interest I'll post something to be entered into a
HBD dictionary reference somewhere.
        Ok back to the start..."fellow home brewers" - we are all here
reading this digest (thanks go out to Rob Gardner) for one key
reason...we enjoy home brewing.  There may be other aspects to that: the
many year experienced 'philanthropist' type spreading his or her
experience through the net, the neophyte (like myself), or others who
see an opportunity to generate interest in a product within their core 
market.  Be that as it may, it is quite evident that this bulliten(sp?)is
self-policing (I have yet to see evidence of non-self-censorship or
people getting kicked off the net), some people do a very good job of
letting letting others know that they've gone too far.  Problem is, its
all just somebody's opinion, so what are you going to do about it
anyway.
Bottom Line: be thankful that we have the resource, some of us aren't as
thick skinned as others - so take it easy *please* - thank you very much
for your responses and your time.
                                Good luck and good beer,

oops - about 15 mins after I posted about attenuation etc. I figured it
out please forgive the momentary stupidity of the poster...but anyone
out there might clarify: attenuation is a term expressing just how far
you can expect to get from your initial gravity to the final gravity
(how far will the gravity *attenuate*), often expressed as a percentage
with all the way to 1.000 being 100% attenuation.  Any responses and
comments to get my .... out of my .... can be sent via email.

 get the full carboys in and out w/o breaking your backs?
 
 I rigged up a rope and hook arrangement that didn't work very well and found 
 that if I put the keg on a chair and then into the freezer, it was 
 manageable.  That is until I moved on to a ten gallon keg.   This is going to 
 take a few pulleys and a serious hoist.
 
 However, I have a pump to move beer from fermenter to keg so the only reason 
 to have to lift it would be to be able to shake it when carbonating.  It only 
 take a few days to carbonate it at 25 lbs so I have been doing it that way.
 
 I think the pump was one of the best improvements I have made in my brewery 
 and it cost nothing.  I just removed the one from the sink in my little used 
 motor home.
 .......
 
 Just noticed you said carboy not keg.  Good luck :)

 What is often said, aint always so.  Careless, uninformed people can no more 
 make good wine than good beer.  Being an engineer, I put everything I know 
 into both and know for a fact that you only get out what you put in and 
 considering the time invested in a good wine, the rewards can be far greater 
 than from a good beer.

 The only three noble hops (this was confirmed from various sources
 in the Brewer's Forum) are Hallertauer, Tettnanger and Saaz. 
 
 I think a definition of "noble" would be appropriate.  Doesn't sound like 
 anything a botonist could get a hold of.
 
 Just what does it mean?

 From: Jurrasic Engineer <fecich`at`csoa1.enet.dec.com>
 Subject: Homemade Bruheat/HB store in PGH/Advertising in HBD




"I'm looking for suggestions from anyone who has tried to make a home-made
 'Bru-heat' type mash-tun. I've located the parts (cooler, 1KW element,
 thermostat), but I still have a few questions....


">Should the heating element be separated from the grain with screen?"


">I will place the thermostat near the element, but will there be a possi-
  -bility of wide temperature variations in the grain?"


">Should I include some method of mixing/stirring the grain as I mash?"


                                -=*=-


I see some major problems with a lot of mash tun designs I see posted.


Few of them, for instance, make use of any sort of insulator - choosing,
instead, to put the heating element directly in the grain ... as well as
failing to circulate the water through which the heat is transmitted ...


There seems to be room for a better design.


Tossing my hat into the ring, as it were, here's a proposal for a pretty
good - but purely theoretical, as of this time - build-it-yourself mash
tun ... I haven't built it yet, but I've been designing it in my head for
a few months now.


        (1)        acquire two nested buckets


                - one, sufficient to hold, say, six gallons


                - one, sufficiently larger, that the first bucket
                  can be placed within it, and be separated by at
                  least 1" of air space from the second bucket


        (2)        assemble buckets, support structures, heating and
                sensing element(s), circulating element(s)


                - cement plastic support structures to bottom of
                  larger bucket ( to support weight of the bucket
                  intended to sit within )


                - cement heating element(s) to inside of larger
                  bucket, on side(s), evenly spaced ( more, smaller
                  heating elements, evenly distrubuted, gives a
                  better overall control of temperature, as well
                  as a degree of fail-safe behavior / redundancy )


                - cement circulating pump(s) inside larger bucket,
                  on side(s) - some sort of pump to circulate water
                  is absolutely necessary to guarantee that pockets
                  of heat and cold do not develop, or that water
                  does not become stratified by temperature.


                - cement smaller bucket, atop supports cemented to
                  inside bottom of larger bucket, well centered -
                  note that heating and circulating components are
                  placed such that they can be reached, and not
                  beneath the ( now cemented ) bucket.    (-:


                  ( a 1" air space may not be sufficient, and a
                    2" air gap may prove more desirable. )


                - optionally, cement braces along sides to hold the
                  smaller bucket centered, against bumps and such,
                  should it prove necessary to move the masher while
                  it is full of water - be careful not to obstruct
                  water circulation, or reorient circulation to keep
                  this from becoming a problem.


        (3)        to operate,


                - fill air space with water


                - adjust thermostat to correct temperature


                - turn on circulation pump, heater


                - add water, grain to inside bucket, mash




The advantage of this design is a stable temperature - as a great deal of
thermal mass, in the form of the water jacket surrounding the inner mash
chamber, resists sudden changes in temperature.


Other advantages are the separation of the temperature module, from the
mashing module ... and, with the addition of a two lids ( one to close
off the mashing tun, and the other to cover the whole thing, and keep the
water in the jacket from steaming off - despite this, water will need to
be added periodically to offset evaporation ), and a wrapping of thick
insulating material, you have a perfect mash tun. No flames, no hot spots,
no problems at all.


I haven't solved the problem of circulating the mash yet, but some sort
of mechanical oscillator - one suggestion has been a rotating shaft with
eccentrically shaped washers on it, another has been piezoelectrical
vibrators such as are found in pagers - would suffice, as this would
create kinetic waves that would bounce through the solution and disturb
any sorts of pockets or stratifications that might develop.


This chamber might also be used to cool the wort, also, by using the outer
jacket to contain _cold_ water ... and with the addition of an outlet
valve, with a removable rolled-up screen, bent at one end, into a pipe that
went through both inner bucket and outer bucket, you could sparge, as well
as - after removing the screen and replacing the hot water with cold water
 - pour the wort off of the hot break, all very nicely.


This also has room for added control electronics, so it could become half
of a BrewBot, if anyone wants to make an automated homebrew robot. ( Making
the bottling automated, now _there's_ a challenge ... :-)

Since no one has responded to this, I would like to say that it *should*
*NOT* be a problem.  As far as I can see this is equivalent to using
an open fermenter (or maybe it is even a little better).


A tip for other novices (this includes me): a cheap source for 5gal glass
carboys are stores that sell spring water. They are usually available for

Subject: Keg Information Needed


With all the talk on the HBD lately about CO2 pressure, I have grown
interested in kegging.


I have located five 2.5 gallon kegs at a used restaurant supply house. 
Two of them have screw-on caps with tapered rubber washers, while three have
clamp-type lids with smaller rubber gaskets/o-rings.


There is also a combination of fittings on the tanks themselves, with some
having pins, and oteers having grooves for snap-rings.


I would appreciate hearing from any kegger out there on the relative merits
of these various types.


The kegs are pretty crudded-up, but I think they will clean.  Are there any
fine ponts to be aware of before sinking money into these kegs?


TIA, and please reply to me with private e-mail, and I will post to the HBD
if there is a consensus opinion. Please private e-mail to  America On Line if
possible.

Subject: Dangerous Zymurgy suggestion






     I recently purchased a back issue of Zymurgy (Gadgets and


Equipment). After reading an article on preserving and freezing


yeast by Maribeth Raines Ph.D. I decided to give her suggestions


a try.


     I only wanted to store my yeast for a few weeks to a month


so I followed her directions for storing the yeast in the fridge. 


I mixed yeast from the primary (British #1098) with an equal


amount of a sucrose solution mixed at a ratio of 1 cup of water


to  3/8 sucrose. I understand that the article was mostly about


freezing yeasts, but she also suggests,"On the other hand, if you


plan to use the same yeast within the next few months you can


save the yeast from your primary fermenter and store it with an


equal volume of sucrose (it's cheaper than glycerol) in the


refrigerator.(Zymurgy Special 1992, p. 69)"


     The new solution was placed in the fridge in a sanitize and


closed glass jar.   In a few hours I noticed that the solution


was fermenting away.  So, over the last few days I have been


venting the jar to keep it from exploding.  This situation seems


quite dangerous.  Most of all, I was surprised to see an ale


yeast ferment at 38 degrees.  Should I take that to mean that I


have a wild yeast fermenting away beside the British yeast


strain.  


     Any suggestions are appreciated.  Am I doing something


wrong?  Any suggestions or amendments to the article.

Subject: Besieged by baleful bacteria


Fat Wanda's Brewery & Recording (my basement) is under attack by vicious
bacteria.  I've had a recurring house infection that I can't seem to get
rid of, in spite of the scourings and bleach treatments.  Now it's
gotten to the point I can't even get an uninfected starter!


To the best of my meager knowledge, it's some kind of lactobacillus or
possibly pediococcus infection.  Symptoms are cloudiness, a slight
acidic flavor and aroma, and a tan slime on top of the krausen.  These
all match the symptoms described in Noonan (p.  81).


My starter had been prepared normally, with dry malt and some hops,
boiled, put in clean jars, given a water-bath canning procedure,
then put in the fridge for a few weeks.  I popped a package of WYeast
1056 on Saturday, let it swell for a few hours, then pitched it into a
quart starter and capped with an airlock.  By Monday, the infection was
obvious.


I can't imagine how the infection entered the starter.  The airlock

lacto or pedio that can survive canning?  Is there any easy way to ID
the exact beasties that are giving me problems, and if I do will it
help?


This is really getting frustrating.  I now have a batch of porter that
will have to sit overnight until the brew store opens tomorrow and I can

Subject: Looking for a High-Gravity recipe / Watermellon recipe


Hi y'all,


I'm interested in brewing a high-gravity all-grain brew.  I'm currently
limited by my pot (5gal) and stove.  Can anyone suggest a high-gravity
recipe?  I can boil up to 4gal of liquid...  I do have a lauter-tun (Zapap
type) that works adequately.


 ........


Also, anyone have a watermellon recipe?  I bought a H20 mellon this weekend
for a pahty and we never used it.  It is a 16.3 pounder - i would like to
brew something with it.


Thanks,

After 5 all grain batches, I re-read Miller's "complete" book to see if it

        xxx AAU hops
        3rd addition 1 ounce (count only half of the AAUs toward your total)

While I am here in Ithaca NY trying to get a thesis written by the end of the
year, I am also in the process of planning an Oregon wedding for next Spring.
(I fell in love with the place (after working a summer in Portland --it will be
"home" just as soon as I wrap things up here in New York!)  We are getting
married at Timberline Lodge (Mt. Hood) probably around the early part of June
or late May '94.  The reason I am writing to you all is for some advice.  I am
a homebrewer (since my days in Portland) and my fiance and I are avid
appreciators of fine brew.  Thus, we would like to plan our wedding reception
around beer.  Say, for instance, a Duvel-like toast, IPA or an amber during the
meal, followed by something along the lines of a barley wine or Grant's
Imperial Stout.  I am hoping to work something out with one of the micro-
breweries in the area (Widmer, Hood River, Mt. Hood, or even Weinhard?) for
contract batches of both barrels and some custom bottled brews for souvenirs.
(I'm sure it would taste better on the first anniversary than that frozen
wedding cake!)
    I am pretty sure this is "do-able", but the most difficult part is trying
to coordinate everything from 2,000+ miles away!  If any HBDers (esp. you
in the Pacific NW) have any clues, advice, hints, suggestions, (ETC..!)
I would REALLY appreciate it!  Thanks.

Subject: KQED San Francisco Beer Festival


I am surprised that there have been no posts yet about the KQED
San Francisco Beer Festival.   Perhaps it is the format of the thing
that makes it not get the kind of recognition that the GABF or the Oregon
Brewers Festival get, as it may not appeal to some homebrewers.
Let me describe it this way:
     Have you wandered into your local import beer shop and said to
yourself, "boy, I sure wish I could taste ALL of these beers."  Well,
you almost can.  The format of the KQED Beer Fest is that you pay
about $30 for a ticket, then you get to taste all the beer you can in
3 hours.  About 250 beers are represented, mostly imports and microbrews.
I can't remember all of them, but Samuel Smith, Paulaner, Bass, Guinness,
Anchor, Sierra Nevada, and many others serve their full assortment of brews in
1-2 oz tastes, usually poured from bottles. There are also many free food
samples such as french bread, salmon pate, etc., to soak up some of the brew.
     I have to admit that I like the format of the Oregon Brewer's Fest
better, as it is more relaxed and its outdoors.  But I know of no other
festival where you can taste the variety of import beers as the KQED.
Also, the servers are often volunteers who know nothing about the beer,
and the palate tends to become a bit muddled after tasting several
hundred different beers :).   Nevertheless, I always manage to have a
great time.
     The KQED Beer Fest is on July 10 in San Francisco, I believe at
the Armory, south of Market Street near I-80.  Disclaimer:  I have
nothing to do with this Festival, just thought you should know.
Also FYI, KQED is the local public television station.

Here's a data point on high gravity beermaking.  I did this once inadvertently
on my 2nd all grain batch.  I managed to make a wort with an orig. grav of
around 75-80.  I fermented it as such, using Sierra Nevada Yeast. 


Came time to bottle, and I got three gallons bottled (out of five total).
Then I decided to bring the last two gallons up to three using tap water,
added an appropriate amount of additional priming sugar, then bottled.


These beers came out totally different.  The undiluted one was very strong
and had that winey flavor (similar to bigfoot barleywine).  The diluted one
turned out to be a reasonably good pale ale.  Very interesting.  I'd be
interested in hearing from someone else who could go through this same
simple process and see if my data point is valid.  Another good point is
that you get an extra gallon without much extra work and without obtaining
any larger equipment--and you get two different beers, to boot.


Also, another thing to consider is hop rate.  My original wort was well
hopped. 11 or 12 AAU's, so the diluted one ended up with a decent bitterness.


Second Thing:  I am moving to Columbia, South Carolina in about a month.  
  Anyone have any advice or info on where to get HB stuff around there, 
  either in town or by mail order.  I am doing this now in case I don't have
  internet access there.  Thanks.

This past weekend I brewed an all grain English Bitter (I know English Ale
on the 4th of July... flame off...).  The target gravity was 1037.  I used
1 qt of water per pound and grain.  Usually I am fairly good at hitting
my target gravities.  Most of my batches are OG of 1045 - 1080.


For a 5 gallon batch I collect 6.5 gallons of extract (stopping when 
gravity reaches 1010).  However this time I was only able to collect
5 gallons of extract.  I had to add 2 gallons to the fermenter to get
the gravity down from 1056 to 1039.  What gives?  Is this just the 
results of brewing low gravities and having to top off the boiler with
water?

Howdy,


In HBD 1175, Phillip Seitz writes about orange peel in Belgian beers.  As a
point of reference, Celis White is brewed with Curacao peels.  They grind it
with coriander in a small grain mill.  If that's the flavor you're shooting
for, that's the orange to use.  I have no idea where Pierre Celis gets it
from, though.


Speaking of Celis, he sold his small brewery in Hoegaarden, Belgium, a few
years back to Interbrew, a huge brewing conglomerate.  With the millions he
made he was able to set up shop here in the states.  If Jim Koch did the same
with A-B, maybe it will allow him to do other things in the world of brewing.
It certainly will give him a lot of fast capital to work with.  And who cares
if A-B is brewing Sam Adams?  If they stay faithful to the quality (believe
it or not, Auggie Busch is big on quality), does it make any difference if
Koch or Busch is in charge?


Happy brewing,

This should have read WHOLE hops or plugs.  I add 10% for the hop bag because
I contend (and have verified empirically) that the decreased agitation of
the hops and decreased circulation of wort through the hops when using a
hop bag require an increase in the amount of hops you use.  I increase another
10% when I use whole hops or plugs because I theorize that the pelletization
process exposes a lot more lupulin than is available in whole or plug forms
of hops.  Again, I have settled on 10% because my experience, with perhaps
75 batches since I started to make these compensations mathematically (instead
of just targeting for a higher IBU in the formulas), has shown that they are
pretty close -- within the tolerances of my tastebuds.  I'd like to verify
these numbers with actual tests, but the cost of these types of tests are a
bit too expensive for me at this time.  Perhaps some day.

Regarding Jonathan Knight's HBD 1174 posting on advertisements

Regarding my Southern California hop garden, the hop cones have
just started  appearing in the last week. These are Cascade. I
recall someone mentioning a while back not to grow hops near
roses because the bugs on roses are bugs for hops, too. Well, I
have no choice; the only spot in my yard which is good for hops
is right next to the roses.


I also have had no problem. I have enough praying mantis, lady-
bugs and green lacewings running around my yard that little in
the way of spray-on chemicals has been required. But there is
a reason why one would not want to grow hops near roses which
has bee brought to my attention, and which I'll share.


If your roses -- or any other plant near the hops -- are being
treated with any type of systemic insecticide, then beware,
because the systemic in the soil can be absorbed by the hops!

Indeed hop particles will help with protein coagulation, but I feel that you
should wait till after the hot break to add the hops in the first place.
The last time I recall reading about this is in a post from Stuart somewhere
around HBD 1150.  My contention, as that mentioned by Stuart, is that the
hops will do too-good a job coagulating proteins *AROUND THEMSELVES* thereby 
reducing the utilization.  Now, if you wait till after the hot break, I
suggest that there will still be some coagulation of proteins around the
hops, but not nearly as much as if the hops were added before the hot break.


Why does this matter?  Well, the theory is that the protein coagulated
around the hops will reduce utilization.  I have not done side-by-side
tests of this, but I do recall a significant increase in hop utilization
when I began to wait for the hot break before adding the hops.  I did not
put the two together till someone on the HBD mentioned it.

I disagree.  I do just the opposite.  I use a hop bag for boiling primarily
to avoid the problems of having to remove the hops from the wort later,
either as you pour the wort into the fermenter (my screen kept clogging
and that made it a real pain!) or when racking.  I just compensate by
adding 10% more hops.  I don't use a hop bag for dryhopping but only use
whole or plug hops because they float.  I've never had any problems
siphoning the beer out from under the whole hops.

Interesting, but I've had no trouble with the orange tip on the end of my
racking cane -- I tip the carboy with a stack of coasters or a block of
wood and then gently lower the cane into the lowest part of the carboy.
I then use masking tape or a rubber band to make sure the cane doesn't
move.  I discard the first two cups or so and the beer runs clear from
there on.  Perhaps you are not getting a good cold break and your trub
layer is very deep.  Then again, you've got hops in your trub and I don't.
On a typical 5 gallon batch, my trub layer is about 1 inch thick, say
between 0.75 and 1.5 inches.  Just for the record, I have not tried
Fermtech's racking tube holder.


In another post, Mark writes:

The pH does make a big difference and the luck is that you still got
28.5 points without adjusting the pH.  Those enzymes are pretty picky
about their environment and you could have gotten much worse than 28.5.

Subject: Yield calculator (tm)


As part of my neverending work to improve the spreadsheet program I use to keep
track of my brewing I decided to include an Extraction Rate Calculator (tm) to
automatically compute an extraction yield based on the o.g., total weight of
grains used, gallons of beer produced (pts/lb/gal).  I then decided to go that
one better and include a calculation for the maximum extraction rate based on
some yields found in Dave Miller's book-Brewing the World's GreatBeers (p.
129).  These yields in alpha order are:


Type of malt                Yield
Black                        24
British crystal         26
British mild            33
British pale            36
Brown sugar                45
Cara-pils                30
Chocolate                24
Crystal                        24
Flaked barley           30
Flaked maize            40
Malt extract (dry)      45
Malt extract (syrub)        35
Munich                        28
Pale 2-row                35
Pale 6-row                33
Roasted barley          24
Vienna                        32


I can now find the maximum yield for a batch by typing in the type of grain and
the pounds used, then use a lookup table to access the above yields in my
maximum extraction rate formula.  I have also included a formula for the
percentage of maximum yield to give me an idea of the efficiency of my
mashing/sparging operations.  When I plugged some of Miller's recipes from
BTWGBs I computed efficiency ratings of between 81-91% of maximum, which is
what I got on my last couple of batches.  However, since Miller did not include
any source for these yields I was wondering if they look reasonable to the
informed readers of the HBD.  Also he did not include yields for a couple of
grains I have used in the past, such as Wheat malt and Flaked Oats and I was
hoping someone else could supply them.  


In the for what its worth department, on my last batch I used an all-at-once
sparging method (you pour in the all the sparge water, mix for 10 minutes, let
it settle and after recirculating until clear, drain the wort into the brewpot)
which was described in the FAQ on grain brewing in the archives (sorry, I can't
remember by who to give proper credit) and got an 85% yield efficiency.  If I
can get this high a percentage with this extremely simple approach I don't
think I will ever go back to the old way.


I will merrily post any interesting reply results received relative to grain
yields.  As always, your constructive comments are greatly apprectiated.

P.S.  Invoking the principle of one CPU, one vote, I would like to see the HBD
include less technical ramblings and more investigative reporting (do we have
someone watching Koch(tm) full time now?), argumentativeness and flaming
characteristic of Phil, Montel, Opera, Hard Copy, Current Affair, etc.   
Lets quit this polite and informed, but incessant bickering and really spice
it up so we can have a forum to be proud of.  :)
