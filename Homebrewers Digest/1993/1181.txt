It may be too intense.  I used 5 lbs of raspberries and 5 lbs of cherries
in a 5 gallon fermenter and then added about 3.5 gallons of beer on top
of them.  One judges comment (from our very own Roger Deschner) was that
the beer didn't have enough "beer flavor" and that the fruit completely
overpowered the malt.  By the way, I presumed that some of the fruit
flavor would subside after a while and the same beer entered in a competition
two months later took first in fruit beers.  Note that raspberries have a
much more dominant flavor/aroma than cherries and this is why I'm speculating
that 2#/gal would be too intense.  If I were to try a balanced raspberry/
cherry beer, I would probably use 2:1 for the cherry/raspberry ratio.

Can`t help you there -- I froze and blanched my fruit for sanitation,
but you are correct in assuming that you'll introduce some microbeasties
with the fruit and you need to deal with them somehow.  I just don't have
any expericence with Campden tablets.

The "Y" would work and you can probably get it from a place that stocks
parts for Recreational Vehicles.  Note that a problem with your experiment
that you haven't mentioned is that the geometries of your fermenters
will be different, no?  You have to account for the space taken up by
the fruit.

>1) from the FAQ file, what and when is hot break?


Hot break is coagulated protein.  It is basically cooked protein, but
is formed partly due to the proteins in the wort reacting with tannins
from the grains and (later, for those who do wait for the hot break)
hops.


>2) do you wait for hot break before adding bittering hops (the

Personally, I do wait, even for the boiling hops.

You might try asking for a thermostat for a window airconditioner.  I have
the Hunter sales brochure and they make something like eight thermostats.
One of them is most definately the Hunter Airstat.  If your retailer
carries Hunter thermostats, they should be able to get the Airstat.  You

    Well, I received a *lot* of replies to my question about low OG.


    It turns out that I hadn't mixed the wort well enough with the
    additional water I added to bring my volume to 5 gals.  I started
    another batch this weekend, agitated well (you should've seen me, I
    didn't have a cap for the carboy so I hugged it to my chest, rested it
    on my thighs, and danced around the kitchen for a while--it was a
    sight!), and lo and behold, the OG came out 1.042 -- it was supposed to
    fall between 1.040 and 1.044, so I'll consider that a good measurement.


    Thanks again to all who commented and gave me guidance.  Have one on
    me.  ;-)

Geoff,
This is the first I have ever heard about a place of this nature.  My
husband and I are about to move, and it now occurs to me that this might be
a good little sideline to get into in our new location.  How do they get
around the laws concerning selling homebrew, the gallons per year rules,
and all the other regulations that exist to prevent us from all realizing
our dreams and opening brew pubs in our basements?   What state are they
in, and if possible, could you tell me the name of the store and their
address? Do they let the batch ferment there, bottle or keg it and baby-sit
it for you?  Take gravity readings, etc.?  Is your batch guaranteed, or if
there is an infection or the batch tastes like something awful, do you eat
the cost of the brew?And do they have a standard selection of brews you can
do, or do they let you use your imagination?  There are plenty of homebrew
supply shops where we are going, but this idea could really be a winner!

Rich, how did you prime the beer at bottling time?  If you rinsed the
bottles well and are keeping them at 70 degrees, either you didn't prime
the beer right or you have a brew that attained so high a level of alcohol
that it killed all your yeast-critters.  Why don't you give us a little
more info...Style brewed, ingredients, OG, FG, type of yeast used and how
long the fermentation took.


>I noticed that I have more like two inches of air space in each bottle.


I would think that with over 2 incles of headspace you would have little
beer bombs ready to explode.  I usually go for less air space rather than
more, based on no real theory but just on our own good results and the hope
that by elimiinating one little 1/2 inch of space in each bottle we might
reduce the amount of bottles to fill and cap (and wash) per batch.  I think
that if this situation continues, you may want to re-bottle the beer,
perhaps by making up a rather large starter, uncapping all the bottles,
putting the beer into a well-sanitized bucket, adding the starter at high
krauzen and re-bottling in a new batch of (already waiting) sanitized
bottles.  I would not use the same bottles again.  Do you have a jet
washer?.  Or you could keg it and force-carbonate it.
Good luck with it...Bettina

proscribed amount of space, with details limited to descriptions of
technology used or actual physical characteristics rather than long
laudatory sales pitches about the item, i.e. "Fresh Belgian Yeast straight
from a Trappist brewery and flown in every week on the Concorde, in special
containers of x composition and gathered using y methods, including a
hermetically sealed container of air from near the roof tiles of the
brewery" might be acceptable...but not GUARANTEED TO MAKE TRAPPIST ALES

Howdy,


Johann Klaassen is worried about how his wheat beer is coming out darker than
expected (HBD 1179).  Just impress your friends with the Dunkelweiss recipe
you developed, & everything should be okay.


However, if you want to do a Weiss, see if you can get Alexander's extract.
I think it's 60% barley / 40% wheat.  I've never personally tried it, but I
hear that it works.

I called the Pike Place Brewery, and the gentleman that answered (did not
get his name) was very helpfull.  At the tail end of the fermentation
(primary or secondary?) the fermenter is sealed and allowed to 
pressurize.  It is then cooled to help dissolve more CO2, and flocculate 
the yeast, then they bottle using a counter flow pressure system.  So,
the yeast Michael cultured is what they use to ferment.

I think you provided the answer - the boil is too. Try your next batch
at twenty five minutes. I have successfully used the M&F Wheat (two cans
with 1 pound of malted wheat mashed in 3cups of 150F water and sparged
to add to wort to make 5 gallons) with 1 1/2 Hallertau plug hops to make
a very satisfying, pale wheat ale. The last batch I added a hop tea of
Hallertau to add to the aroma and liked the results.

I would like to find an electric surface heating element which

boil using the 1 kW element on my kitchen stove, which takes about 30
to 45 minutes.  All else being equal, seems I could use a 2 - 3 kW
element.


Note that I don't intend to replace the stovetop element.  I want to
make a stand-alone unit that I could use in the garage or outside with a
10 gallon stainless pot.

Mike, yes you have the fermentation strain.  Pike Place is a single strain
yeast.  


Since they Irish Moss their beer I am suprised you obtained any yeast
from the bottle.  I was told by the brewery - Good luck...  Then I took
them a quart jar and they gave me some yeast...


This strain is a good strong fermenter.  Not much esters and other flavors.

Funny you should mention this, because this very weekend I was at my local
brew store talking to the guy there about brewing with extract.  I usually
brew all-grain, but due to time constraints I'm doing an extract batch
next, and so I was getting some advice on it.  He said that boiling does
indeed darken malt - he thinks it's actually an oxidation process and that
splashing the wort around a lot when hot darkens it even more.  His
solution:  do a mini-mash of your specialty grains first (crystal,
chocolate, etc.), strain the grain out, then boil the hops in that water,
and only add the extract for the last twenty minutes of the boil, thus
minimizing the time the extract is boiling, but still giving you the full
time for the hop boil.


How does this technique sound to the more experienced extract brewers out there?

Response to Ed Wolfe


Beer Body


I use at least 1/2 to 1 lb Dextrin malt in my mash for an acceptable level of
body.  This malt must be crushed and mashed with your 2-row.   You can use
dextrin powder and add directly to your boil but I have never experimented with
it as I went to all-grain before I had the chance.


SF area brewpubs


If you can, check out the Anchor Brewing Co. on Potrero Hill in the South part
of the city just off of Hwy 101.   The fresh beer is outstanding, not like your
bottled stuff!  Try a 50-50 mix of Liberty Ale and Old Foghorn Barley Wine,
you'll never be the same.   Pick up a Celebrator magazine when you get there and
you will have an instant guide to the local micros.   Call Anchor Brewing or SF
Brewing Co. on where to get a copy.   For the Jurassic Park of micro brewing you
MUST visit Buffalo Bill's in Hayward, enough said.

about.  It's titled _The_White_House_Cook_Book.__A_Comprehensive_Cyclopedia_of
_Information_for_the_Home_.  It was first written in 1887 (though I have a
second printing from 1907) by Hugo Zieman (Steward of the White House) and
Mrs. F.L. Gillette.  Here are the beer recipes I found.


Hop Beer


Take five quarts of water, six ounces of hops, boil it three hours; then
strain the liquor, add to it five quarts of water, four ounces of bruised
ginger root; boil this again twenty minutes, strain and add four pounds of
sugar. When lukewarm put in a pint of yeast.  Let it ferment twenty-four hours
it will be ready for bottling.


Ginger Beer


Put into a kettle two ounces of powdered ginger root (or more if it not very
strong), half an ounce of cream of tartar, two large lemons, cut into slices,
two pounds of broken loaf sugar and two gallons of soft boiling water.  Simmer
them over a slow fire for half an hour.  When the liquor is nearly cold, stir
into it a large tablespoon of the best yeast.  After it has fermented, which
will be in about twenty-four hours, bottle for use.


Spruce Beer


Allow an ounce of hops and a spoonful of ginger to a gallon of water.  When
well boiled, strain it and put in a pint of molasses, or a pound of brown
sugar, and a half on ounce or less of the essence of spruce; when cool add a
teacupful of yeast and put into a clean tight cask, and let it ferment for a
day or two, then bottle it for use.  You can boil sprigs of spruce fir in
place of the essence.


Egg Flip, or Mulled Ale


Boil one quart of good ale with some nutmeg; beat up six eggs and mix them
with a little cold ale; then pour the hot ale into it, and pour it back and
forth several times to prevent its curdling; warm and stir it till
sufficiently thick; add a piece of butter or a glass of brandy and serve it
with dry toast. (I'm going to try this at a Homebrew party in August)


>From what I gathered about this book it is a compilation of information from
the recipes and experiences of the White House staff since the time it was
first occupied (circa ????) till 1887.

I have been re-using yeast slurry for several years.  My method is to 
add a cup or so of cool water to the slurry after I've racked off of it
and swirl it around, mixing the slurry really good with the water, then
pouring it into a sterilized glass quart jar.  I let this sit at room 
temp for several hours until there is noticable seperation, then pour
the top liquid layer off.  I again add about a cup of cool water to the 
yeast, mix it up good, cover and let sit at room temp for several hours.
Pour off top layer, pour the resulting yeast cake into a sterile canning
jar, cap and store in the refridgerator until you're ready to brew again.
This is better know as washing yeast and the method can be used with 
either dry or liquid yeasts.  I have been usually re-use a package of
yeast anywhere from 7 to 10 brewing sessions before it starts to appear
suspicious.

I probably shouldn't get involved here, but I'm a bit confused.


Are you saying it's impossible to get an infection using your mouth when
starting a siphon?  Because if it is possible, then why is Al's advice
"seriously stupid"?  The fact that you have not gotten any infections
using a siphon by mouth seems analogous to not getting lung cancer
after smoking for 30 years, or not getting killed while driving
without a seat belt, or not getting an infection while having sex
without a condom.  All these are likely outcomes but since they
are all possible any advice on not smoking, or on wearing seat belts,
or a condom aren't "seriously stupid".  If you believe the chances
of infection are so remote that one shouldn't worry about it,
then why not use your mouth all the time instead of using boiled water?

It is my understanding that you will need a different type of tap to
completely duplicate the creamy head.  The taps used for Guinness
must add some turbulance or some other effect whereas the standard beer
taps go for smooth flow so as not to knock the CO2 out of solution.  I
have not found a bar owner who would let me take their Guiness tap apart
to find out but I do keep trying.

I will be attending the AHA's Brewing Frontiers in Portland, Oregon.  When I

I will be flying into Seattle and driving a rental car to Portland.  One

at the Marriott is $14 a day.  Parking the car for a week will cost
almost as much as the car rental.  I don't plan on using the car very much
during the conference, but I do want to have a car for a couple of days
to sight-see after the conference and Brewers Festival.


Does anyone have a suggestion on where to park?  Renting the car "by the

combination of travel would work (air, bus, rail, boat, ???).

Just want to mention, that you should convert the temperatures (T2 & T1)

Jeff Frane asks:


        I'm interested in hearing about people's experience using Irish Moss as
        a kettle fining agent.  I had been using it off and on for years,
        without being able to notice any difference when I remembered to add it.
        Eventually, I stop bothering all together, and since I was using 1056
        yeast almost exclusively, I hadn't any problems with clarity.


I recently made a steam beer using Papazian's all grain recipe. The recipe
called for Irish moss but I decided to omit it. After a month in secondary the 
brew had a permanent haze that just wouldn't go away.  On a hunch, I boiled
1/2 tsp irish moss in a quart of water for 10 munutes and after cooling
added to the secondary and mixed well.   Within minutes globs of solids
formed (I love technical terms :-) and settled to the bottom.  Within 24 hours
the brew was crystal clear - I mean CLEAR!


The beer is currently on tap and is great.

Subject: Duvel




The recent post on Duvel got me thinking about something I read in
Jackson's Belgian beers book. On page 216 paragraph 3, it states 
"A proportion of dextrose is added before primary fermentation, to boost
alcohol and further attenuation." Well, my understanding of dextrose
is that it is not largely fermentable (by commonly used yeast). How
could the dextrose boost alcohol and further attenuation. Perhaps
its in the type of yeast used. Jean De Clerck at it again. A further
reference to dextrose being used in priming after cold maturation  and
yeast compaction (see last paragraph same page).


It is also interesting to note that the maturation for this top-fermented
product is so low: 30.2F or -2C. 
After maturation they drop the temperature to 26.6F (-3C)
for compaction  and precipitation of the yeast bed. All this happens
prior to conditioning. During which the temperature is boosted 
to 71.6F (22C). My experience with yeast is after it has sedimented
and been treated in such a cold manner that it doesn't take to
a quick revival. Must be a truly remarkable yeast.

Coca-Cola has recently started selling Coke in 6-packs of 8oz bottles

Donate the bottle contents to your friends if you're not fond of Coke

The disadvantages are that the glass is clear, so you need a dark case
to store them, and you have to live with the screened "Coke" label.

Subject: Irish Moss


In #1079 Jeff Fane asks about others experience with Irish Moss and
recommends using 1 Tablespoon per 5 gallon batch.  I have been having
similar problems with Irish Moss. I use 1/2 to 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons,
and it doesn't seem to make any difference if I add it or not. My beers 
are mostly clear with a slight chill haze.  Some have a fairly high 
amount of chill haze. 


When should the irish moss be added to the boil. I think Papazian
suggests 5 minutes from the end of the boil, and the instructions on the
packet of irish moss I got from the homebrew store say 30 minutes. (It
could be the other way around) From what Jeff is saying it looks like it 
should be added as the wort is heating up before the boil. So when is the
best time to add it?

Although I haven't bought a second tank myself, I have sampled homebrew
served this way -- only it was a brown ale rather than a stout, and the
creaminess and head retention were both truly remarkable.  I don't know
if this qualifies as "cheating", but the end result was terrific.  Only
stubborness (and the fact that the CO2 company is two blocks away)
prevents me from making the conversion.

Actually, what's amazing to me is not British "fear" of stronger ales,
but the fact that British brewers can produce such flavorful beers at
such low gravities.  But Jim is right: a British relative went on at
great length about how my 1.050 beer tasted like a barleywine.  You
should have seen his eyes bug when I served him a real strong ale!


I suspect part of the "fear", however, stems from the British propensity
for session drinking.  Beers in the 1.030-1.035 range certainly lend
themselves to spending the whole evening in the pub and still being able
to find one's way home.  (Of course, as Andy Capp has it: "You know
where I live, Chalky knows where I live.  We don't _all_ need to know.")

Jeff asks about Irish moss users.  I also used to use it (powdered) 
when I remembered (about half the time) and could notice no significant 
difference in clarity.  1 full teaspoon/5 gal. for the last 10 or so minutes 
of boling.  When I ran out I did not buy more.  My kegs would condition for 
about 2 months in the cool cellar.  Recently I have been supplying my 
father on a regular basis and the beer now seems disappear twice as fast 
(at least!).  In the shortened conditioning phase I had noticed a clarity 
problem which I attributed to process changes that I made when I 
increased my brew length.  Then I happened to notice the Irish moss 
FLAKES at my local supplier.  Since I'm a sucker for anything 
new/different I tried them.  Suddenly the clarity problem is GONE.  
Imagine that. I am convinced. 


But I am confused about one statement

Hot break?  You make no mention about time of addition.  I always 
thought IM was to be added very late in the boil, well after the hot break
had formed.

Jeff Frane brings up the subject of Irish Moss.  I've always used it, but 
since my beers are never light colored, it doesn't make a helluva difference. 
That I've noticed. 


But I'm curious about one thing.  Papazian et al say to add IM 10 - 15 minutes 
before the end of the boil.  This seems to contradict what Jeff (Dr. Fix?) 
says about helping the hot break.  Doesn't the hot break happen near the 
beginning of the boil?


On other thing.  A while ago, I experimented with with larger amounts (like 
what Jeff suggests) and I remember having some problem, (Maybe low SG?).  I'll 
have to check my notes at home.

 <No, but i have thought about buying a second CO2 cylinder and having it 
 filled with 40% N2 and 60% CO2 for some winter stouts out of my keg.  Has 
 anyone done this with success (ie: brewed a stout and dispensed it w/ a nice 
 creamy head ala guinness?).
 
 It is difficult or impossible to mix at home and keep it mixed.  You can buy 
 it already mixed in a product called Alagal.  They roll it for hours to mix 
 it properly.  I tried it, it's cute but not much can be said beyond that.  
 The head seems to form a little strangely but I could detect no particular 
 difference in the feel of the carbonation or in the lingering head.
 
 Contrary to popular notions, the product was developed to make more money not 
 better head.  The fact that it does not disolve into the beer means that high 
 pressures can be used at the source for rapid dispensing at remote taps.  
 Football stadiums and ball parks are the best customers so that should give 
 you a clue as to the objective.
 
 It is impossible to force carbonate beer with this stuff so you definately 
 need two separate tanks.  The method I used was to pressure up the keg at 50 
 psi with the mix and shake it for a few minutes.  No matter how long you do 
 this, there is no noticeable drop in pressure or other indication that 
 anything is happening but some nitrogen is disolved.  I then purge the tank 
 and carbonate in the usual manner with CO2, then purge again and rest it over 
 night with the mix at 30 psi, then reduce to normal dispensing pressure.
 
 I rented the mix just to experiment with and returned it a few weeks ago as 
 another idea of little value to homebrewers.
