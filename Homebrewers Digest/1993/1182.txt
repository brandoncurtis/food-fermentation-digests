I thought so too on my first few batches, but then a more experienced
brewer pointed out the astringency in my beer.  Upon questioning, it
was traced to my removing the grains when the water came to a boil.
Heck, for my first batch, I boiled them for 60 minutes.  I recall I still
loved the beer, but today, now that my palate is more sensitive I'll bet
I wouldn't enjoy it.

You may also have:


1. not stirred the priming sugar well and some of your bottles may be
overcarbonated (did you first dissolve the sugar in a few cups of water
and boil it to sanitize and dissolve the sugar?), or


2. you may not have used enough priming sugar (1/2 to 3/4 cup corn sugar
for a 5 gallon batch -- or use 3/4 to 1.25 cups of DME),


3. or, you may have brewed such a high-alcohol beer that the yeast is
pooped-out (I once brewed an Imperial Stout with an OG of 1120 -- it
never really carbonated at all -- in retrospect, I should have pitched
a more attenuative yeast once the Wyeast #1028 pooped out at 1050).

Yes, too much headspace will give you more carbonation not less.

The look will change, but the flavor will change also.  A pair of brewers who
have won gobs of awards for their beers (including the Ninkasi Award in 1992), 
Steve and Christina Daniel, are strong proponents for filtering.  When you
filter, you must be aware that you can filter too much -- try Miller Brewing
Company's Amber Ale -- not bad in flavor, but all the body has been filtered
out of it!

Bacterial contamination as well as wild yeast and mold (however mold should
not be a problem (unless you've got tons of it in your air) if you watch
aeration (molds are aerobes)) can be problems so watch your sanitation.
Higher temperatures will increase the yeast's production of all kinds of
by-products from esters (fruity flavors and aromas) to phenols to higher
alcohols.  If you use a good, clean yeast, you should not have problems
with phenols and higher alcohols too much.  Some yeasts produce more than
others.  I feel that Wyeast #1056 and #1028 are quite clean.  I believe
that diacetyl production is increased at higher temperatures also, so you
may want to avoid high-diacetyl producers like Wyeast #1084 when you brew
at higher temperatures.

I believe that the use of the title India Pale Ale has been misused in
Britain as well as in the US.  I feel that the AHA's definition is closer
to the mark on this particular style than are the commercial examples,
but this is just my opinion.

I've used dextrine malt without mashing it and yes, it will increase body.
Lactose will not do much for body (I feel) but will increase residual
sweetness which can be interpreted as increased body.  Malto-dextrin
powder is available and can increase body and mouthfeel, but I haven't
tried using it yet.  Some extracts will give you a higher final gravity
which will give you that "chewyness" that you seek.  The best extract for
this is Laaglander Dried Malt extract.  Northwestern Malt extract also
tends to finish a bit higher, but not nearly as much as Laaglander.

It could be that you are not stirring well enough when you top your wort up
with water (see a recent HBD).  Another point I'd like to make is that you
should not use softened water for your brewing.  Water softeners work by
adding salts to the water.  If you have bicarbonate hardness, you can reduce
it by boiling and then pouring off the sediment that forms.  A little more
trouble, yes, but I think your beer will taste better.  Note that a high
carbonate water is perfect for brewing stouts like Guinness!

It's not NO2 and I don't believe there's any nitrogen at all in the cans.
The recipe is different for draft Guinness compared to the bottled version.
Jackson gives the bottled version four stars, but I believe only three for
the draft.  The cans are the draft recipe.  To make a long story short,
the cans work because the plastic bubble squirts beer into the can through
a small opening and makes the beer foam.  Please see late 1991 to early 1992
HBDs for more details.

It is somewhere in color and flavor between Munich and Vienna Malts (at
least that's where Briess Malting puts it on their price sheets) and yes,
it must be mashed.

Some say it can, others say it doesn't, but you need to describe the funny
taste more for us to help you -- is it metallic?  can you relate it to
some kind of food?  do you have hard water?  do you use well water?  what

someone will be able to help you find the source of this flavor.

Hmmm... I seem to have gotten it all wrong.  It's not a partial boil that you
want.  What you really want to do is to sparge into your kettle till it's
about 3/4 full, then boil that down to where you can add more runoff.  Once
you're done sparging boil this down to about 6 gallons and then add the
boiling hops.  If your pot is too small to handle 6 gallons comfortably, you
can do the boil in two parts, splitting your hops in half.   Many breweries
do this when their fermenters are twice the size of their boilers.  You
don't get a high-gravity wort simply by reducing your mash water in half...
you get one by either just taking the first runnings and making a 1 gallon
or 2 gallon batch (then using the second and third runnings for a smaller
beer) or by taking all the runnings from, say 12 or 15 lbs of malt and then
boiling this all down to 4 or 5 gallons.  A partial boil is an extract
procedure where you boil your extracts with only part of your total water
(compensating for the low hop utilization) and then adding water after the
boil in the fermenter.

BruHeat Users/Potential Users:


My first attempt to heat 5 gal. of water in a BruHeat took >1 hr to reach a
boil


I purchased a sheet of 1.5" very dense foam, cut holes for the gauges and
spigot and duct-taped it around the BruHeat.


Next batch took ~30 min to boil.


Also, I'm extract brewing only, but I bet mashing temperatures could be much
more easily maintained and more quickly increased with the insulation.

Subject: more on sugar in beer


I'm trying to find out the constituents or chemistry of different
sugars added to British or Belgian beers.  What I think I need
to determine first, however, is what is the purpose of adding the
sugar?  What are we trying to accomplish?


What is taken as truth about sugar (I think):
  *  Glucose is 100% fermentable and thus adds alcohol and no flavor
  *  Table sugar is sucrose and is mostly fermentable but can add
     a cidery taste if the amount is too much
  *  Brown sugar is sucrose with a little molasses still in it
  *  Turbinado sugar is similar to brown sugar; it is table sugar that
     has not been completly refined.


What is invert sugar?  I thought it was an optical isomer of sucrose,
but sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose.


Back to the original point.  If the idea behind adding sugar is to
lessen the body of high gravity beers (doubbel, trippel), then it
would seem that glucose is the best bet.  Rajotte's book implies that
invert sugar is more fermentable (than sucrose), but it shouldn't
be more fermentable than glucose.
If the idea is to add some additional flavor, then brown, turbinado,
or candi sugar would be a better bet.  Glucose leaves no flavor and
sucrose leaves an undesirable (usually) flavor.
Where do candi sugar and turbinado come in?  That is, what do they
add that the other sugars don't?


So what did I get wrong?  Sugar is usually a taboo subject with
homebrewers, so I'm not suprised that there is no primer or anything.
Fire away...

Subject: The Tumbleweed Report (part 1)


What happened to all that free time I was supposed to have this summer?


I promised to summarize some of my experiences at the Tumbleweed Grille for 
the forum.  I received dozens of requests to do so, so here goes...  
Sorry it's taken so long.  I apologize in advance for the somewhat rambling 
nature of what follows but there's a lot I'd like to say and if you wait for 
me to organize it into MA thesis form, it'll never get posted!! 


Before getting down to all the numbers, allow me to set the stage for you.  
You'll never understand why we did what we did if you don't have a grasp on 
the problems as they were presented to us.  I'd hope that anyone who decided 
to take the jump into commercial brewing would have more money than we did.  
At the same time, what follows is proof positive that you can put together a 
commercially viable brewpub on a shoestring budget.  From the beginning, the 
prime motivating factor behind what we've done at Tumbleweed has been the 
fact the operation was designed and built without borrowing a single red 
cent!!  If the operation folds tomorrow, we haven't lost any money.  We've 
capitalized all equipment as the need arose.  To me, this makes what we're 
doing at Tumblewee unique and is why I'm boring you with the details.  We 
have almost 30 years combined brewing experience among the three brewers.  
And yet 7 months ago none of us could have imagined that we'd be doing things 
the way we are now!  But what we're doing is working, so what can you say? 


A bit of background on Tumbleweed.  The business started in 1989 as a 
Southwestern foods restaurant and is firmly established as such.  Tumbleweed 
is a restaurant first.  It is not a bar and doesn't pretend to be one.  This 
is important to keep in mind when one considers our weekly sales.  I think 
beer sales are significant despite this fact.  I sometimes shudder to think 
what could be happening if we were a bar.


The restaurant is located in Boone, NC, a small mountain town in the 
northwestern corner of NC.  Population of the town proper is about 13,000.  
Appalachian State University has an enrollment of 11,000.  I think there is 
about 30,000 people living in the county.  Boone is a summer and winter 
vacation destination point.  Believe it or not, Boone is the ski capital of 
the South.  There are 4 major slopes (at least for us) within 30 minutes of 
town.  In the summer, people come up here to escape the heat off the 
mountain.  Last I heard, some 2,000,000 tourists come through town each year.  
Much of our business comes from this tourist crowd.  We get hardly any 
business from the students.  We're beginning to get a decent following among 
the faculty and staff. 


Bart Conway, the proprietor at Tumbleweed, began reading about the brewpub 
movement in restauranteur publications and thought it was a great idea.  Bart 
is as enthusiastic a person as one could ever hope to meet.  He's a man who 
definitely appreciates good beer.  But as he contemplated starting his own 
brewpub I think it's fair to say he didn't know the difference between malt 
and hops.  So here's a man who likes the brewpub idea, owns a restaurant, and 
wants to try it, fully admitting he doesn't know that much about making beer.  
I have a lot of respect for a man with his intestinal fortitude. 


Not knowing the ins and outs, he did not want to invest 100's of thousands of 
dollars into a business about which he knew very little.  One day he was 
drinking coffee with a homebrewer here in Boone who said, "Sure.  I can brew 
beer.  Let's do it."  And so it began.  In February of 1992, Tumbleweed served 
its first beer. 


They bought a used gas stove, a 10 gallon enameled pot, and turned out the 
first few batches of Tumbleweed beer *5 gallons* at a time, bottled them and 
walked them down the hill to the restaurant.  (Tumbleweed is officially a 
microbrewery because the brewhouse is not attached to the restaurant itself.  
We walk the beer - now in 5 gallon cornelius kegs - down to the restaurant 
when they run out.)  Shortly they moved to 10 gallon batches.  An assistant 
brewer, Cam Hedrick, came on board in the May of 1992, is still there, and 
is the only member of the team who is indispensible.  He works forty hours a 
week, monitors the day to day operation: kegging, transfers, keeping the 
restaurant in stock, keeping records straight so the BATF stays off our backs, 
etc.  In July, Cam pushed production up to 30 gallons where things stood when 
Burton Moomaw and I were invited to join the operation in November. 


When Cam arrived, they were using an immersion wort chiller.  When the 30 
gallon kettle was put online, I helped them design a counterflow wort chiller 
(1/2" copper tubing inside 5/8" garden hose) which they began using in August.


Being the good mountain man that he is, Bart is an inveterate "horse trader".  
And with his own beer online, beer was a hot topic of conversation at the
restaurant.  During the course of one of these "rap" sessions, he scrounged a 
30 gallon stainless steel pot that had been used in a restaurant at one of 
the country clubs close by.  Now he needed a gas burner.  Somehow this came 
up in conversation with the guy who sells the restaurant after dinner mints. 
He knew where there was a 350,000 btu burner that wasn't being used and gave 
it to Bart.  The moral of the story here is that for a couple of free meals, 
the brewery had a stainless steel pot and a gas ring. 


In November Brett Deal, the head brewer moved from Boone, Bart called to ask 
me if I was interested in working in a kind of head/brewer consultant 
capacity.  Already working two jobs, I actually turned him down, promised to 
find someone for him, called my brewing buddy, Burton Moomaw, and we decided 
to form a very loose "partnership" and split the responsibilities with each 
other.  When I'm busy, he brews.  When he's busy, I brew.  And Cam, our 
brewery operations manager, always brews.


So here we were.  A couple of homebrewers who had never brewed more than 15 
gallons at a time.  Full of ideas and enthusiasm and no commerical brewing 
experience.  There were a number of changes to be made.  In fact, it's fair 
to say that no part of the existing brewing operation resembles what was 
going on in November.  We've changed everything.

I used to use it, but after a discussion with George Fix (which I posted
in HBD a while ago) in which he convinced me that the majority of
mouthfeel and head retention is from proteins and not from dextrins, I
reassessed my use of Irish Moss.  Irish Moss works by electrostatically
attracting protein molecules to itself as it sinks to the bottom of
the kettle.  I was dissatisfied with my head retention at the time, so
I theorized that I might be taking too much of the proteins out of the
wort.  I cut back from a teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon and then eventually
stopped using it altogether.  Except for my very first few batches, I
have always been very careful to not boil my grains.  (Chill haze needs
big proteins and tannins to form.  Head retention and mouthfeel are
the result of smaller proteins which can be formed from the big proteins
during the protein rest, but that's a whole other issue).  In any event,
I felt that I was getting acceptable clarity and thus did not miss the
use of the Irish Moss.


On the other hand, some of the National 1st-round judges (justifiably)
had a higher standard for clarity and I got some "slight haze" comments.
Now, I'm thinking about perhaps trying Irish Moss again or one of the
other finings, perhaps Polyclar, which (I believe) also works electro-
statically, but is used in the fermenter and instead of proteins it
attracts tannins (please correct me if I've got this wrong, or confirm).


By the way, the yeasts I use are mostly Wyeast #1056 and Wyeast #1028.

The way that higher temperature mashes work to make a more dextrinous
wort is that the beta-amylase enzyme is more quickly denatured at the
156-157-158F temperature range than is alpha-amylase.  At the lower
temps (148-149-150-151-152), they both work together to break the
starch molecules down to mostly fermentables, whereas at the higher
temps, it's mostly alpha-amylase at work.  If you overshoot to 158 or
160F for a minute or two, you may denature a bit of your alpha-amylase
faster than at 156F, but you probably couldn't even measure the
difference.

What I don't understand, is why the sucrose solution then?
I know that long term storage of yeast requires either
sub-zero temperatures or feeding them (so they don't start
eating their neighbors), but if they aren't going to eat
the sucrose, then why have it there at all?

My hop plants have been slowly consumed by something that bites big
chunks out of the stem and leaves.  I thought for a while that it was
the same squirrel that was terrorizing my snapdragons.  However today I
found a bug munching away on a leaf. 


A quick perusal of Hops (R.A. Neve) found a picture of the critter.  It
is a Clay-coloured weevil (Otiorrhynchus singularis).  The damage
description matches too.  Unfortunately, Neve doesn't give much advice
about eliminating it. 


He states that it is not generally a pest of great importance.  He
suggests organo-phosphorus or carbamate insecticides, then refers to a
report about the possiblity of using parasitic nematodes.  I would
prefer using natural predators instead of insecticides, but Neve seems
uncertain of their usefulness.


Does anyone have any experience eliminating weevils? I now only have one
living plant left, and am concerned that predators may not be effective
on a single plant.  Perhaps I should simply kill the weevils by hand.

Subject: Re : Irish Moss


My experience has been that Irish Moss improves the _cold_ break, ie, upon
cooling the wort, one obtains a very sharply defined layer of trub, similar
to that which could otherwise be obtained by refrigerating the wort for a 
couple of days. I suspect we get told to add the Moss near the end of the boil
for reasons of economy, in other words, to let the combination of heat, hops
and agitation do its stuff first.


Jeff, what do the scientists say about the effects of Irish Moss on body/head
retention? It would be great if it was selective enough to take out the larger
proteins which we don't want and leave the rest, but I presume this is where
some of the reservations arise. In fact, this issue of protein selectivity
applies to a whole range of brewing practices, starting with the use of a
protein rest during mashing, and moving on to issues such as whether to skim
the initial boil or not, whether to use kettle finings or not, even whether to
employ forced wort chilling (at least in stouts), whether to skim/blow-off the
primary, and lastly whether to employ finings after fermentation. I presume a
whole lot of trade-offs are involved here, probably involving glucans and
lipids as well as proteins, and I for one would like to see more definitive
statements than can be found in the homebrewing textbooks.

Subject: U-Brew-It-Here


Here in Ontario, this has been a real growth industry for the last
year.  However, the BIG BEER MAKERS complained about the unfair
competition and in the last provincial budget, the government slapped
a tax of $0.26/litre starting 1 Aug 93.  The tax is scheduled to go up
in the next couple of years.  This will spell the end of a lot of the
U-Brew places.


The way they worked is that you go there, pick a recipe and are
assigned a kettle.  You mix the ingredients and cook the beer, then
the staff puts it in a keg to age after filtering and cooling through
a heat exchanger.  Two weeks later, you come back to bottle.  I
understand that during the interval, the beer is filtered once again
and transfered into another keg.


There are some severe restrictions on the places.  They do not sell
beer.  They sell ingredients and bottles, and rent the equipment to
users.  You are not allowed to sample your beer while bottling so that
the place does not turn into a drinking establishment.  The only way
to sample a beer recipe before brewing is to exchange a bottle with
the person bottling next to you or with friends who brew there.


Costs for a batch of 48 litres (roughly 12 gallons) vary between $60
and $110 CDN depending on the recipes.  This includes the regular
sales taxes and a $25 service charge (equipment rental, storage,
etc...).  The new tax will add more than $12 per batch.  The old price
was half the price of a commercial beerfor a clone of same beers to
about the same price for a more exotic  beer (Chimay clone).  Now the
price will go up to almost 75% of the cost of commercial stuff.


Advantages of U-Brews: -No mess to clean up.  No room required to
store ber or ingredients.        
                        - No smelling up the house
                        - Socializing
                        - Its almost impossible to make bad beer
there.


Disadvantages:        - Cost: Almost twice as expensive as making beer at
home, especially if you shop around for ingredients
                - Limited choices of beer recipes, with no
cusatomization.
                -Car required to bring back the bottles
                -Cannot experiment with more exotic ingredients such
as ginger, fruits, etc...
                -Cannot lager the beer

You might check into private long term parking lots at the airport, which might

  Since George isn't with us this summer (may the book go well), one of the
reactions at working is the "Browning Reaction(s)".  (Most of this info
comes from George's book via my hazy morning memory.)  
  Browning reactions START when the extract is being made.  They continue
while in the can, which means it would be nice if they marked the cans with
date of production.  The Browning reactions result in Melanoidins.  These
reactions will also occuring during your boil.  The oxidation of melanoidins
is where they begin to play a bigger part in the overall beer.  (Not
mentioned above, melanoidins are the dark pigment.)  If you have George's
book, Principles of Brewing Science, the section is only a couple pages long
but well worth reading.

Subject: Plastic Fermenters


I've got a question about plastic fermentation vessels.  The kit I started
with came with a 6.5 gallon plastic pail with a screw down lid for the
primary fermenter.  Though the batches I've brewed so far have come out
good (with the exception of using old Whitbread yeast for one -- yuck!), I 
noticed a definite lack of bubbles coming up through the fermentation lock.
I asked at my homebrew store and he said it was hard to make a good seal
between the lid and pail.


I guess my question in all of this rambling is whether this seems reasonable
and whether I should worry or have a homebrew?  I've thought of going to
a glass carboy for a primary fermenter, but I don't have a 6 or 7 gallon one
at the moment.  I've thought of using my 5 gallon size with a blow off tube, but
the thought of my dogs or two year old son drinking from the blow off bucket
has kept me from it so far.


Any comments or suggestions?

From: gummitch`at`techbook.com (Jeff Frane)
Subject: Hot Break Terminology




Judging from the responses I received in regard to my posting on Irish
Moss, there is some real confusion about the definition of "hot break".
A number of people seemed to think I was advocating adding the IM at the
beginning of the boil, which is not at all the case.  


So let's be clear: the hot break is at THE END of the boil, not the
beginning.


I can understand the confusion; not only have recent postings by
theoretically reliable people made the wrong assertion, but the standard
homebrewing texts are remarkably vague on the whole subject.  Although I
found good information in professional brewing texts, the most lucid
explanation is from good old Dave Line, in his Big Book of Brewing, from
which I quote with abandon:


     The "hot break"


     If you take a sample of the wort in a hydrometer jar and hold it up
     to the light it should look reasonably clear; clear, but not
     crystal clear and bright like one would expect in the finished
     beer.


     The change in clarity is brought about by the boiling process. A
     closer inspection of a light coloured wort would show that the
     dullness is caused by a greyish mist of finely dispersed matter.
     The mist is due to the presence of haze forming degraded protein
     matter combined with hop tannins and its derivatives.


     The behaviour of these nitrogenous substances in the copper is
     rather remarkable.  Long vigorous boils will coagulate these gummy
     substances and make them insoluble.  Regularly observing the
     clarity of samples taken throughout the boil will demonstrate
     this fact.  A few minutes after boiling commences, the mist forms a
     haze of small, but visible particles.  The particles grow as the
     boiling ation, coupled with the buffering of hop cones, increases
     the rate at which these gummy substances combine to form even
     larger particles.


     The "hot break" is said to be secured when all the protein matter
     has formed into flocculating compact lumps.  Always check for this
     condition (but not before at least one hour's boil) by removing a
     wineglassful of the wort.


     The thermal cycle of cooling, should, if the break is successful,
     deposit the match head sized particles at the bottom of the glass
     to leave the wort above clear of suspended matter.  If there are
     still minute particles in suspension which have not combined with
     the main masses, then the wort is "undercooked" and boiling must be
     continued.




For those of a more scientific bent, there are similar discussions in
DeClerq, who also recommends visual examination of the wort and says:
"The appearance of the break serves as a guide to the brewer for the
duration of the boil, because it frequently happens that after a good
break has been obtained any further boiling gives a turbid wort."  


Recommendations on the use of Irish Moss range from 15 minutes (Dr. Fix)
to 1/2 hour before the end of the boil.
