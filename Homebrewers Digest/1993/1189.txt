Subject: Brewcap / Spelt


Since Mr. Baughman mentioned his Brewcap, I thought I'd ask a question or 
three about it.  First, there are two holes, one larger than the other.  The 
larger hole fits a siphon hose, airlock, or whatever.  What, exactly, fits 
in the smaller opening, or does the smaller oppening fit into a sphon hose?
What sort of clamp do you use to hold it on, just a plastic strap?  A pipe 
clamp?  And thirdly, is the material of the Brewcap completely inert in 
beer?  I appologize if these questions sound ignorant, but the local 
brewshops sell the Brewcaps under the assumption that they are simply for   
racking upright carboys (ie stick racking tube in short wider hole, blow into  
tall thinner hole to start the siphon).
        On another note, I was in a bulk store  yesterday and noticed what 
looked like flaked wheat, but the bag was labelled "Spelt, no wheat".  The 
TerriblyUnhelpfulShopkeeper Explained to me that it was "Spelt, it's not 
wheat".  Thanks.  When pressed further, she said it was a grain "as old as 
time...Biblical times...".  Thanks again.  I looked it up later, and it IS 
in fact a wheat, _Triticum spelta_, used mainly for livestock feed.  Of 
course, at the bulk store the labell extolled the virtues of the proteins 
in Spelt ad nauseum.  Anyway, has anyone used spelt (flaked or otherwise) 
in brewing?  If not, would anyone like to know the results of a 
side-by-side Wit brew-off between regular flaked wheat and spelt?

The Tumbleweed Report:  The thing I love about this, Kinney, is that you
are actively disproving the central theme of the brewpub explosion --
"you have to spend a lot of money on fancy stainless steel equipment,
brew boring beer, or forget it."  To avoid libel suits, we will call
this the "California Brewpub Theorem", which *requires* startup costs of
about $500,000 to $750,000.  (The Hart Brewery, which makes Pyramid
ales, was capitalized in about 1984 for $20,000; there is very little
that has changed since then for someone willing to put in some work.)
Bravo, Kinney.

Don't forget, that's 42 pages with almost no advertising.  So, it's 42

Zymurgy, which is a real embarrassment: what little editorial matter
there is is almost indistinguishable from the vast amounts of

Both of these are or have been available in Portland, and are reasonably
good beers.  The Maredsous is unremarkable, and I don't remember much
about it; the Lucifer is a sort of Duvel knock-off, inferior to the
original but still pretty good.  Hey, the trick with those yeast strains
is to culture them out, then add them to a small amount of 1.030,
unhopped wort.  You will be able to tell *a lot* about the flavor
profile by tasting the resulting beer, and you can answer your own
question about whether it seems suitable for brewing.

No te preocupes.  Don't worry.  The amount of time you dry-hop is
dependent on how much hop character you want to draw off.  Seven days
really isn't enough, and two weeks is, IMO, a minimum to actually
express some hop character.  My own experience, going back six or seven
years of dry-hopping, is that six weeks is optimal for a really
distinctive dry-hopped beer, but that's only a recommendation for kegged
beers.  (It also happens to gibe with the recommendation of the brewers
at Sierra Nevada for their Celebration Ale.)  Leave the hops in until
you bottle.

You need to uncompress them on a Unix system with the "uncompress"
command.  As a fellow-Unix illiterate and DOS user, I sympathize, but
how are you getting ftp service on a non-UNIX system?  Me, I have a
shell account at a local access site and dial them up from my DOS
computer; the UNIX programs run there and if I want to I can transfer
from that computer to mine.  You can probably get a similar arrangement
somewhere near you.

Well, plugging the numbers into the equation,
DE = 1.065 * 11 / 26.5 = .44
or 44 degrees of extract.  From this, I would guess that you
added some malt syrup or adjunct.


Most malts are "theoretically" capable of producing about 35
degrees of extract.  I usually get around 32 degrees, which is
pretty good.  The degree of extract tells you how effecient your
mash was.  If you are getting less than 30 degrees, there is room
for improvement in your technique.
( My own personal opinion. )

The reason that often iodophor packages often advertise that iodophor does
not need to be rinsed is because some brewer's water has bacterial problems
and rinsing with the water can re-introduce bacteria.  I've never had problems
with using hot, Chicago tapwater for rinsing, even in the summer (when
everything is more microbiologically active -- that's why the water supply
often has increased levels of chlorine added in the summertime).


I'm quite confident that your problem was not from the iodophor, rather that
the medicinal flavor/aroma came from one of the following sources (in order
of probability):


1. yeast -- I've noticed that some dry yeasts, if not stored in a fridge, after
while, will produce increased levels of phenolics.  Perhaps this is because
there was some more hearty wild yeast in the dry yeast or maybe it's a result
of poor storage.  Other dry yeasts, even when stored properly produce phenolics.


2. airbourne wild yeast infection  -- it seems as if your sanitation technique
is good -- could some wild yeast have gotten in via the air?  Could your
problem correlate with the warmer weather, when the air is more active
microbiologically?


3. wild yeast infection from the water -- maybe you do have a problem with
your rinse water... the solution would be to boil the rinse water or to
air dry the iodophor-sanitized equipment.


******************


Don says he got 11 gallons of 1.065 wort from 26.5 lbs of grain and
wants to know what his extraction rate is and is it good.


Well, the maximum extraction varies depending on the type of grain,
but you got 65 "points" and this translates to:


65*11/26.5 = 26.98


or basically 27 points-per-pound-per-gallon, which is quite good for most
types of base grain.  Some get as much as 30 or even 31 points (Miller
does this partly because he re-circulates the runoff an awful lot and
this not only gives him great numbers, but also it has been reported that
Dave's beer is on the astringent side).

I don't know whether Lucifer is bottled with the fermentation yeast, but
my guess on the Maredsous is that it is a bottling yeast.  My reason for
this assertion is that Maredsous is made by the same brewery as Duvel
(note the bottle shape is distinctive and the same as Duvel) and I've
read (here in the HBD) that Duvel is packaged with a bottling yeast and
not the fermentation yeast.  Oh, yes, I recall the brewery -- it's
the Moortgat Brewery in Breendonk, if memory serves correctly.


>Also, does anyone know anything about either of these beers?  I cannot read
>either label, and I do not know what style either of these beers are.


Maredsous is an Abbey ale, and it comes in four types which, I believe,
are associated with the Belgian degrees of the OG.  If memory serves,
they are 4, 6, 8 and 10.  I've had only two and the numbers were NOT
on the label (stupid US laws!).  One had a Gold and Black label and the
other had a Gold and Green label.  I'd be interested in the colors of
your label and the number on the bottle, if you could send me email or
post it.  4 Belgian degrees is 1040, 6 is 1060, etc.


I have not tried Lucifer, but have read about it in Jackson's pocket guide,
big book (I forget the name too) and the Great Beers of Belgium book.
Basically, it is a beer of the type that was originated in the beer Duvel.
Duvel means devil and therefore virtually all the breweries that imitated
this beer have chosen names that are associated with the devil: Lucifer,
Satan, etc.

Leave the hops till you can bottle.  The reason I posted that "you should not
dryhop longer than 7 to 10 days" is that, empirically, I've found, that more
than 10 days gives less hop bouquet than 10 days.  This is for 65F or so.
At cooler temperatures (although I haven't done this -- this is based upon
what I've read about commercial breweries procedures), like 50F or so, two
weeks seems to be the consensus.

  Maribeth, please let us know if the origin is known.


  Having just got the Brewer's Resource catalog, I'd say that they have a
  good selection in the yeast culturing department.  Including the ability

Subject: Hot liquor tanks


I am in the continual process of improving my brewery and I have a
question for the digest:


Has anyone converted a hot water heater into a hot liquor tank?  I
have two options: 220V electric with 2 elements or a gas fired unit.
I was considering the gas fired unit, and thinking of running it
on propane but my question is how do I defeat/replace the thermostat
so that I can "dial up" 180F water?  Can electric units handle this,
or is the time to reheat too great to be practical? I was thinking 
that Grainger might have a thermostat replacement, anyone know?


Good brewing,
Jim Busch

I've been asked to supply homebrew for a party in Salem MA in August.  I have
a keg (cornelius) of wheat brew in my basement aging that is going to be the
one to bring.  I have to transport this from littleton MA to Salem, about 45
miles or so.  I want to do this the day of the party.   Can the keg/brew handle
this?  What kind of settling time, if any, is needed?  I plan to have the
beer pre-chilled, that is, i'll take it from my fridge and bring it to the
party (1 hr drive)...  Should I drop the pressure inside the keg to nearly 
zero?  Increase it to 30???

Subject: Crushoff in Portland


 
 There have been rumors that a certain grainmill producer plans on conducting 
 a mill evaluation of sorts in Portland.  My first reaction was to grab a new 
 MALTMILL and head for Portland to defend the fort.  This was based on 
 information he is promulgating that portrays the MM as no better then the 
 Corona.  Turns out, all his hype is based on unscientific tests that seem to 
 prove nothing.  As it is unlikely that the proper equipment will be available 
 in Portland, I decided it was not worth the expense and hassle just to prove 
 what most of us already know.
 
 To avoid the feeling of fiddling while Rome is burning, I dropped some 
 samples of milled product off at Siebel Institute for an unbiased evaluation 
 of the grist of the MALTMILL and the other mill.
 
 The results confirmed what George Fix reported a year ago and experience on 
 over a thousand units has demonstrated.  The adjustable MM provides a grist 
 that is comparable to a multistage commercial mill.  The fixed MM provides a 
 very satisfactory grist but is a bit coarser and somewhat grain dependant.
 The other mill, when properly adjusted provides a sieve analysis similar to a 
 fixed MM on paper but visual analysis shows more husk damage.  Unfortunately, 
 the sieve analysis can not tell the difference between small husk particles 
 and similar sized malt particles that pass through a sieve.  It was designed 
 to test roller mills and not grinders or hybrids such as the other mill.
 
 For those going to Portland, there will be a MM on display in the TKO 
 Software booth and Tom Nelson will have flyers and data sheets to hand out. 
 Feel free to fondle it.  I am confident you will conclude that there is far 
 more than the nuances of grist variation involved in selecting a grain mill.

I employ Kinney's tip on using pot scrubbers to prevent hops clogging the

a pot-scrubber-in-a-bag. Reason? It makes sense to apply a series of
progressively finer filters in order to prevent the mesh from clogging too
quickly.

Subject: RE: Priming, sugar vs. malt extract vs. gyle


Rich asks for comments about the virtues of corn sugar, dry malt extract and
gyle as priming agents. When I first started brewing I used corn sugar which
worked OK, but then having decided to brew "all malt" only I switched to
gyle which was also good, but less convenient to use. I now use only dried
malt extract for priming. For English or Scottish style ales I use 1.25 cups
light dry extract dissolved in 2 pints water, boiled for 10 minutes, cooled,
& poured into my sanitized "bottling bin" (a plastic fermentor with spigot.
I then siphon the beer from my glass carboy (which allows good mixing
without much oxygenation), allow it to stand for about 15 minutes while
arranging bottles, and then bottle. For American style ales, California
Common beer, or lagers I use 1.33 cups of malt extract which results in
slightly higher carbonation. No more gushers as I had with corn sugar.

Several posts have appeared recently about filling CO2 cylinders:


To the poster that got it filled at the bar, yes you got ripped
off.  Go to a welding supply, fire ext. supply or look in the YP
under Carbon Dioxide.  It does pay to shop around as prices vary.


When I bought my second CO2 tank, I asked if it was possible to 
fill an empty tank from a full one.  Technically, it will work,
but it was explained to me as being very dangerous!  This was
because the tank being filled will heat up and explode if it
is done too fast and without the proper equipment.  In fact,
most of the welding gas suppliers in my area don't actually fill
tanks anymore, but exchange them.  The filling is done in a central
facility.  Bottom line:  Don't mess with it.  It can be fatal to 
you and your neighbors!


On another topic, I was at the UC Davis library's "brewing room"
recently and I came across a very old book by E. R. Southby called
"Practical Brewing".  It had a lot of interesting information on
hops and hopping rates (the only stuff I copied, naturally) but
the book had no date on it.  The library's computer (actually the
Melvyl system) also had no date for the book or the author.  The
book was published in England, I would guess around 1890, but I
like to know for sure.  Does anybody have any clues?  Southby had
died a few years previous to this edition (the third).  If anyone
has any info on Southby or the book, I would appreciate it.  There
were many other old books there and I copied the hops data out of
three.  I'll summarize and post soon.  You'll find it very 
interesting.


Related to my trip to Davis, I also got some better info on the
"hop storage curve".  There were two good articles and as soon as
I've had a chance to digest them, I'll post an update to my storage
post.


Lastly, I'll be in Portland for the Oregon Brewer's Festival (but not
the AHA event) at the Hopunion booth if anyone wants to drop by and
chat or say howdy.  How many of us will be there on the weekend?
Should we do a pub crawl on Friday night maybe?

Subject: Blowoff, Iodophor, Sterilizing bottles




Here are a few data points to add to the debates:


Blowoff -- fortuitously, my last batch of "plain jane" got split into its
carboys unevenly.  Consequently, one blew off and one didn't.  Of course, the
best test would have been if I had kegged both carboys or bottled both, but
in fact I kegged the one that did blow off and bottled the other.  Anyhow,
at kegging/bottling time, I could definitely taste the difference between
the with-blowoff and without-blowoff carboys.  The without-blowoff carboy
had a tad more bitterness and was slightly "harsher."
   I have never done this kind of direct comparison before and frankly did
not expect to taste any difference at all.  Surprise.  The only problem is
that I just bought 2 more acid carboys (7-gal) and I can't ever fill them
enough to get a blowoff.  Maybe I shall use water carboys for my delicately-
flavored brews and acid carboys for the chewy dark ales.  I dunno.


Iodophor -- I have been using iodophor (BTF, I think) to sterilize my kegs.
I use the recommended amount for the recommended time and air-dry.  Then I
give the keg the sniff test.  If I smell ANY iodine, I rinse the keg with
boiling water.  So far I have ALWAYS smelled iodine.  I am not about to buy
another bottle of iodophor.  To me, the slightest iodine flavor would spoil
the batch and I hate to throw out 5 gal.  I suspect that boiling water alone
may work -- or else I shall go back to weak clorox followed by boiling water
rinse.  Let's face it -- kegs aren't that expensive.  If I get pinholes in
the s/s after, say, 5 years, the keg has cost me maybe 5 bucks a year.  (Of
course, if it's only ONE year, I'd feel different.)


Sterilizing bottles -- I have always sterilized my bottles in the dishwasher.
I clean the bottles thoroughly with TSP, in the sink, scrub them and rinse them
carefully.  Then they go in the dishwasher for a full wash cycle with NO
detergent, and a HEAT DRY (not air dry) cycle.  Naturally I prepare the
dishwasher first by cleaning all the guck out of it and running it once
while empty.  Bottom line -- Mary and I have never had a bad batch that
could be attributed to unsterile bottles.  (I.e. either the whole batch was
uniformly bad or uniformly good.  We did have an episode where our yeast
starters got infected once.)
   I have mild asthma and Mary has it bad.  We have to be careful about
sulfites.  All you homebrewers, please remember that Campden tablets and
bisulfite sterilants can make your homebrew toxic to those with respiratory
problems.
   BTW, whenever I have a chance I sterilize with boiling water in lieu of
chlorine.  This only works for small stuff like airlocks but is quite
effective and there is no danger of chlorophenol or iodine contamination.
I think it is just common sense to eschew toxic substances wherever possible.

American hops were not highly thought of in brewing circles until quite
recently, and for good reason.  I would be willing to bet that the stuff
growing on your parents' farm are Clusters in some form or other.  It's
amazing to me that some people are still brewing with these hops, which
used to be considered high alpha -- they have no other redeeming quality
as far as I can tell.  The British referred to American hops as being
"catty", which meant nothing to me until I smelled some Clusters: they
smelled just like a catbox.


I have some terrific old photographs, courtesy of the Oregon Historical
Society, of old hop farming, some dating back to the turn of the
century, and some from the period in which your old hop farmer quit.
During the 20s-40s (judging from the clothing), at least some of the
Oregon hop growers were training their hops along low-lying strings,

Subject: What is a microbrewery?




Maybe we should come up with terminology describing individual beers by the
size of the batch. (My understanding that the legal definitions of
microbreweries {for tax purposes}are based on the aggregate annual
production of the entire brewery.) I think this would help differentiate
those beers that are brewed in megabrewery size batches a few times a year
as opposed to those that are brewed more often in smaller batches. This is
not to imply that smaller is better, but I think it could make for more
rational comparisions. Just my $.02 worth.

They take credit cards for orders-so it looks like you could just call.
Its 24$/yr for six issues.


You shoudl be able to find it in your local supplier--and the one around
here discounted the first isue since the second issue is now out.


The first issue had 42 pages of text--a fair amount of which was articles:


1)Facftors Affecting Hop Quality,...and Brewers Preference.
2)Belgian Malts--some pratical observations
3) Reinheitsgebot and the fifth ingredient
4) The Troubleshooter--an advice column--w/o the Hbd
5) Brewing in styles--a changing discussion on styles and how to brew them
6) Thinking about recpe formulation
7) Spreadsheet recipe design
8) And a bunch of assorted smaller depts--a book review, and a few others.


Overall I think the first effort was quite good. In fact a few of the
articles mentioned above were written by HBD'ers with extensive knowledge.
BT looks quite promising and I tihnk I got more info from this one issue
