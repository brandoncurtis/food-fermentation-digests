Well it sure sounds to be like you got ripped off!  What you most 
likely got was your tank filled with 800 psi CO2.  There are two 
types of large tanks (50 pound tanks typical)  those which bars 
and welders would normally use where they want gas and those 
with a liquid tube than runs to the bottom like our kegs so that 
liquid is forced out.  The latter type is used mostly for high 
pressure fire protection systems.  In industry these are often 
called high pressure CARDOX tanks.  You could easily fill a 
smaller cylinder from these liquid tube type cylinders.  It is 
possible to fill small cylinders from a normal gas type cylinder 
but you have to turn them up side down.  Not an easy thing to 
dosafely with a cylinder that weights in at about 160 pounds.


There is another type of CO2 storage tank and that is the low 
pressure CARDOX tank.  These very large systems use a insulated 
tank with a refrigeration system which allows the CO2 to be 
stored as a liquid under lower pressure.  These tanks typical run 
between 10,000 and 30,000 pounds of storage. (That would handle 
a lot of homebrew.)  These large systems are used for major fire 
control systems on things like rolling mills used to roll all of the 
aluminum for beer cans.  Also tank trucks whichtransport large 
amounts of CO2 use this low pressure refrigeration systems.  


Back to Hyrum Laney questions the fill you got from the Fire 
company may very well have come from on of these low pressure, 
refrigerated storage systems.  This would required a pump to 
fillyour tank, or to fill fire extingures.


Safety of the gas?  Well, within reason I consider industrial CO2 
gas from a welding supply company or the Fire company safe.  
(The fire company most likely got their supply from one of the 
large industrial gas supply companies.)  Purity levels of 
industrial gases are very high and I have only had a problem once 
and that was argon which had some cotamination of H2O (water), 
that came from the cylinder, remaining from a hydrostatic test.  
Screw up the TIG welding very badly, doesn't take much H2O to do 
that.  Bottom line of all this I have my 50 pound cylinder filled at 
my welding gas supplier--- 50 pounds lasts more that a year, 
costs $ 19.00 to fill,  but the 160 pounds filled cylinder 
will not fit in the refrigerator.

Subject: Zymurgy Hate Mail


Kieran O'Connor" is worried about getting hate mail because he 
is critical of Zymurgy.  Hate Mail" ? well I guess I hate Zymurgy 
too.  Zymurgy could be so much more that it is.  I think the real 
question is that as homebrewing has been growing up into a 
wider appeal hobby,  "has Zymurgy been growing up too?"  I don't 
think so and that why this forum and new magazines like 
Brewing Tech. have so much appeal.  


It is time for the staff of Zymurgy to listen to some 
constructive criticizing and to start making some 
improvements.  After all for many in this forum who are 
members of AHA, Zymurgy as the publication of a non profit 
organization is our magazine.  


Homebrewing has become, some will say always was, a serious 
hobby.  While I enjoy jokes about the hobby and brewing in 
general the Zymurgy "Don't worry" kick gets real old, real fast.  
Most of us want good beer and we do care about what we invest 
a lot of time and spend hard earned cash on.  The "don't worry" it 
may not taste like what you want but it will be drinkable just 
doesn't match up with the serious brewer today.  My 
recommendation --- drop it.


I think the ads are useful but once a year would be enough for all 
of the AHA ad pages.  Same goes for the filler page listings.  Not 
ever club, ever donor needs to be listed each issue.  Put those 
pages in articles about brewing.  While on the subject of 
articles, include more information and more data, and above all 
tell readers where one can get follow up information.  A full 
page wasted on someone falling into a pile of hops rather that 
more information on dry hopping is just that, a wasted page.


And last, but not least, the Zymurgy staff should, if they haven't 
all ready done so, go out at look at the magazines of some other 
hobbies.  They will find that the publications try to include has 
much information and help as possible in the pages they print, 
not just print the same filler again issue after issue.  By the 
way, why isn't Zymurgy a monthly magazine?  From the amount 
being published in this forum it would not seem that it is a lack 
of authors or information. Is the Zymurgy staff too busy living 
off a non profit organization?


By the way if you disagree send the hate mail to Kieran 
O'Connor.  I intend to stay a member of AHA but would like to 
see Zymurgy improve in the '90ies.

Beer? Just push a button


By Greg Joyce
THE CANADIAN PRESS


     VANCOUVER - It's a drinker's dream - a machine that
turns water into beer at the push of a button.
     Canadians will soon be able to have beer on tap at
home, thanks to the FH2000 Beer Machine - a device about
the size of a coffee maker, says Tim Crosby, president of
Vancouver-based marketing company Fountain House Holdings
Corp.
     Crosby says the cost of a pint from the machine will
be about $1.50.
     The Beer Machine was introduced last month at a news
conference in England, drawing rave reviews in several
British newspapers.
     Operating instructions are simple, Crosby said
Friday.
     Perhaps too simple for the ale aficionado.
     The machine is attached to the home's water supply -
 most likely near the kitchen sink or wet bar.
     On one side of the machine is attached the beer
syrup. On the other side is a refillable carbon dioxide
cylinder.
     The lager lover simply pushes a button and waits a
few seconds. The carbonated water fills a mixing chamber
at the top of the machine along with a shot of syrup.
     The mixing process takes about 10 seconds and the
golden nectar flows into the waiting glass.
     The alcohol content is now 3.5 per cent but Crosby
said that could be increased later to the more standard
5 per cent.
     After the machine's debut in England, the London-
based Star newspaper headlined the story "Tip-Tap Tipple"
and quoted citizens as approving of the beer's taste.
     Another newspaper quoted British trade leaders as
saying the machine posed a threat to an already
struggling pub industry.
     Crosby said his company planned to try to make the
machine available to Canadian consumers by January. It
was demonstrated for a reporter at the company's downtown
office on Friday.
     "The cost in Canada (for the machine) will be
between $150 to $175 (plus taxes)," said Crosby. He said
the Beer Machine retails for about $200 in Britain.
     Consumers must also buy the carbon dioxide cylinder
and the syrup, which is currently made at a brewery in
Britain and sells there for about $12 a can, said Crosby.
     In Canada, the syrup will be subject to liquor
taxes.
     Fountain House is listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange.

In the HOMEBREW Digest #1189 of 7/26/93, Bill Vaughan tells us how he
sterilizes his bottles in a dishwasher.  It sounds like a good method,
but he is only sanitizing them, not sterilizing them.  I use the
dishwasher myself to clean empty bottles of homebrew.  When they drip
dry, I store them away.  Before I bottle though, I soak them in a bleach
solution, rinse them and let them drain.  This, I believe, will kill all
the bugs rather than a good washing will.

Probably the most convenient places to get CO2 tanks filled are fire

Subject: co2 gas vs. liquid


CO2 at room temperature vaporizes at about 45 atmospheres, or about
800 psi.  So, a 20 lb tank of co2 gas (which i guess is about
1 cu ft.) has about 45 cu ft of gas.   However, it is rated at about
800 cu ft. capacity, so the liquid form is much denser.


If you pump just a little co2 liquid into the tank, it vaporizes, and 
may get 46 or 47 cu ft. You must pump the liquid into the tank, which you
can't do from another co2 tank at room temperature.  


So, if you filled it at bar, you didn't get very much.


I've been getting co2 at a welding supply, and they say they
supply the pop companies so I guess their co2 is ok.

When I bought my second CO2 tank, I asked if it was possible to 
fill an empty tank from a full one.  Technically, it will work,
but it was explained to me as being very dangerous!  This was
because the tank being filled will heat up and explode if it
is done too fast and without the proper equipment.  In fact,
most of the welding gas suppliers in my area don't actually fill
tanks anymore, but exchange them.  The filling is done in a central
facility.  Bottom line:  Don't mess with it.  It can be fatal to 
you and your neighbors!

I'd like to add an emphatic second to that.  I've done quite a bit
of high-pressure work, and I've seen some pretty impressive failures
(shown as visual aids on "why you shouldn't do it this way").


When we fill air tanks for our fire department (to about 3000 PSI), we use
what's called a "cascade" system - we have four large tanks, at about
750psi, 1500psi, 2250psi, and 3000psi.  We slowly open the first valve, bring
the tank to 750, close the first valve.  Open the second slowly, etc. etc. 
etc.  Once the top one gets down to about 2300, we rotate the tanks, and get
the lowest one filled up to 3000.  Do not try this at home - this is pretty
expensive equipment, and we had a professional (certified) fitter do all of
the plumbing for it.  Only about 3 of us on the department are trained to use
the cascade system.

I wrote a few days back about my 200 gallon milk chiller - I'm still looking
for good ideas of what to do with the silly thing.  What do y'all think about
using it as a big lagering vessel?


Silly idea time here (best way to get lots of responses, like the paper-
shredder grain mill), 


CAN I FILL IT WITH WATER AND LAGER MY BOTTLES (of beer) UNDER WATER?


The reason I ask this is like this:  At night & on weekends, my electricity
costs 1/6th of the daytime rate.  If I had this thing full of 200 gallons of
water (minus the volume of beer), it would have lots and lots of thermal mass,
and I could probably get by with not running the compressor when power is
expensive.  The tank can chill 200 gallons of milk from cow temperature
(presumably around 37C, 98.6F) to 35F degrees (nice temp, eh?) in less than
an HOUR, so obviously this is a powerful chiller, and will suck lots of
current when running.

I wont argue the issue of sugar vs wort vs krausen vs DME other to say
dont blame the sugar on your gushers.  Proper carbonation is obtainable
using any of the listed alternatives.  Pick what suits your environment and
ease of use.  When I am brewing tons of beer and have krausen available, 
it is great to use.  Usually, 1/2 of each batch I make is primed with 
corn sugar due to ease of use. It works fine.

Hummm, this is news to me.  I had my local CO2 shop put together a F-F CO2
coupling and hose for $15.  I hook one end to a 20Lb tank, the other to 
a small 2-5 Lb and fill it up.  I guess I dont open the valve all the way
at once, but I have found a freezing/chilling effect as opposed to a heat 
build up.  It only will fill 1/4 or so depending on how full the 20Lb is,
but It doesnt seem that dangerous.  The whole process takes about 20 seconds
to "fill".

This is how we traditional top fermenting ale brewers do it and it works

Fine, dont use it for dumb reasons.  My experience over the last year of only
using Iodophor (Diversy)_ at 12.5 ppm (1 0z into 10 gal) is it is the best,
easiest to use non corrosive cleaner on the market.  Fill the keg, add 1/2 oz
let stand 15 minutes, empty and lately I rinse once.  Sometimes hot water, 
sometimes cold.  Like Al noted, my water is clean enough for rinsing kegs
without infection.  Using this method, I have dispensed over 15 batches 
without any iodine troubles.  I think you may be getting overworked on the
smell thing, or are using too strong a solution.

This is wrong.  It should have been:
DE = 65 * 11 /26.5 = 26.98
or 27 degrees.  Not bad, but you could probably get a little better.
most people I talk to are happy to get around 25 degrees. 


I use a Recirculating Infusion Mash system, which helps boost my
extraction.  Also, the way the grains are crushed can make a big
difference.

Subject: Briess, Northwestern


Thanks to all of those individuals who let me know that kBriess and
Norhtwestern malt extracts are one and the same, the only difference
being the packaging.  Now I have a real problem on my hands, namely
figuring out what the Hell is going on with my brew!!!


A few questions to those who know (or think they do):
1) Can malt extract go bad upon prolonged storage?  How can you tell if
it is bad?  Will molds, or other beasties grow in undiluted malt
extract, or will the osmotic pressure prevent this, much like with
honey?
2)  If malt extract is able to support unwanted life, will any
byproducts of these vermin survive a 60-90 min boil or will they be
evaporated away?
3)  If Briess and Northwestern are one and the same, how is it that both
my brewmate and I have both noticed significant differences in brews
which used equal amounts of either, when all else has been held
constant?




An unrelated question:
I am hoping to receive my M.S. in organic chemistry later this year and
would like to pursue a career in brewing.  Of what value to me would it
be to pursue another degree in fermentation science?  What is the best
way to get a job at a "small" brewery? (Not necessarily micro, but not a
at AB/Coors/Miller?)  I've tried the classifieds, but rarely see
anything listed under BREWING, BEER, or FERMENTATIONS.  Anyone in the
business who could offer advice (or a job), private e-mail would be very
appreciated.




Sincerely,
Anthony Johnston

My experience is just the opposite.  Every time I've put a batch aside
to give it a chance to age, the problems have disappeared.  I have had
bad initial experiences with using whole grains.  The results were just
awful for months.  But somewhere in the time frame of 6 to 9 months
later, the beer improved and is now VERY good.

PPM stands for parts per million, figured (usually) by weights.  It has
nothing to do with molecular weights at all.  So, one PPM of sodium atoms
indicates one gram of sodium atoms per megagram, or 1000kg, of water.  
        Where chemistry enters is that these salts are ionic solids - they
dissociate into component ions when dissolved in water.  So, salt (NaCl)
becomes Na+ and Cl- ions.  You should get the PPM of the components by
figuring the percentage weight of each component, and multiplying by the
appropriate factor.  If I add 100 grams of salt to my 1000kg of water, the
sodium will be 23/58 * 100g, or about 40g, and the Cl- will be about 60g,
from the proportion of their atomic masses.  So, my tank of water will be
40 ppm in Na+ and 60 ppm in Cl- ions, when I've dissolved & stirred, since
I started with perfect water.  
        Does this help any?  I haven't looked at the charts in the books.

Subject: Various questions




First of all, I would like to thank the many people who responded to
my request for plans to build a counterflow chiller (Thanks.)


Secondly, a few questions:


  1.  For a 30 foot chiller, what might I expect the temperature of the
      exiting water to be.  Must I use a hot water rated hose?


  2.  When calculating my extraction efficiency, do I use the gravity of
      the wort fresh from the tun or after the boil?


  3.  Is there an advantage to using a thick mash compared to using an
      extremely thin one that would give me say 7-8 gallons on first
      runnings without having to add additional sparge water?


                             and finally


  4.  I seem to recall a thread somewhere that discussed having to bring
      up the temperature of cold fermented beers near the end of the
      fermentation cycle to help remove somthingorother.  Is this a
      figment of my imagination or something I need to be doing?

The following information was located in the National Union Catalog.


Southby, E.   R.
   A systematic handbook of practical brewing: including a full
   description of the buildings, plant, materials and processes
   required for brewing all descriptions of beer, both from malt alone
   and from mixtures of malt with all descriptions of unmalted grain...
   By E.R. Southby... 2d ed. London, E.R. Southby, 1885.
   (7), viii, 391 p.  23cm.


The catalog copy of this work was provided by the University of Chicago
and I could find no listing of a first editon.


Southby was also the author of an earlier work (1877) entitled:
   Brewing; practically and scientifically considered.
   London, Printed by Unwin Brothers, 1877.
   150 p.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Digital vs. lexical yeast


Is there some reason why most people on the HBD refer to the Wyeast yeasts
by number rather than by name?  Like for instance, are the same numbered
yeasts sold by different names in different parts of the continent?  Or do
the numbers refer to some universal system of identifying strains of yeast?
 Or do people just like the scientific ring to using a number rather than a
name?  If each number has a unique name and the name is the same wherever
Wyeast is sold, then why not use the names?  I for one find it much easier
to remember the names, and when I go to the brewing store I don't ask for a
pouch of "good ol' number 1038" (or whatever), I ask for "London Ale" or
"Bohemian Lager" yeast.  I suppose I could tape an old package up on the
wall by my computer for quick reference, but this seems a little awkward,
and people are liable to think I'm even more obsessed with brewing than
they already do.


Maybe people could at least include the name along with the number for
those of us whose brains haven't entirely melded with our silicon yet.

 One problem with a closed water heater you may want to think about is the 
 fact that chlorine and other volatiles in the water have nowhere to go.  In 
 an open vessel they evaporate continually.

 >I employ Kinney's tip on using pot scrubbers to prevent hops clogging the
 syphon, but my system is more a mesh-bag-in-a-pot-scrubber than
 a pot-scrubber-in-a-bag. Reason? It makes sense to apply a series of
 progressively finer filters in order to prevent the mesh from clogging too
 quickly.
 
 All of this, of course, is unnecessary with an easymasher installed in the 
 mash tun/boiler.  However, in my one exerience dryhopping in a carboy I 
 solved the problem of siphoning by simply sliding the em strainer tube over 
 the end of the siphon and being the same diameter, it fit like a glove and 
 worked like a champ.
 
 For those not wanting or needing the em, you can still solve the siphon 
 problem with a tube made of screen slid over the end of the siphon with the 
 end pinched.  You can slide it up or down to expose as much screen as you 
 wish and when you get near the bottom you just push the tube down so only a 
 14 inch or so is exposed.
 
 Just roll a 2 X 6 inch piece of screen over 3/8" diameter rod and pinch and 
 bend the las half inch to seal it off.  Slip this over the end of siphon 
 tube.  BTW, if you put this on the end of piece of coppur tubing and bend it 
 so that the screen lies flat on the bottom and the other end rises over the 
 edge of the pot, you have a portable easymasher.

Subject: Intro & a question


Howdy fellow brewers,
My name is Jon Gibbens and I've been brewing for about 7 months now.  I've been
reading the HBD for about 2 years now and figured it was time to "show my face."
Anyway, all my recipies so far have been your standard Papazian-influenced
dry extract recipies with a little of my own creative flair thrown in for
good measure.  I just got done brewing my 14th batch, a raspberry porter
a la "Goat Scrotum Ale" with 9 lbs of raspberries added for good measure.


My question is:  This last batch was my first batch to go in a plastic fermenter
,all my previous ones have been in glass.  How do you sufficiently aereate 
your wort before it goes into the fermenter?  In glass it's easy..just cap 
the carboy and start shakin' like mad, turn it this way and that, upside down,
you know the whole story.  I was thinking that maybe the next time I do this,
I'll FIRST put it in a glass fermenter and shake it up, then pour it out
into the plastic fermenter and THEN pitch my yeast.  


Now for an obligatory recipie: Being unable to find a recipe anywhere for
a weizenbock, I made up my own.  I'm not sure about the "authenticness",
but who cares?


Wacky Weizenbock


6 lbs Brewmaster Dried Wheat Extract
3 lbs Brewmaster Dried Amber Malt Extract
1/2 lb chocolate malt
2 oz Hallertauer fresh hops (boiling - 1 hour)
1/2 oz Hallertauer fresh hops (flavor - last 20 minutes)
1/2 oz Hallertauer fresh hops (aroma - last 2 minutes)
Wyeast Liquid Wheat Beer Yeast


Prepare according to the standard Papazian method for extract beers.
Starting gravity:  1.61   Starting Potential alcohol:  9%
Ending gravity:    1.16   Ending Potential alcohol:    2%
Primary and Secondary fermentation took 1 month.  I believe that the
high alcohol content (7%) pickled the yeast and stopped fermentation in
it's tracks.  Bottled with 1 1/4 cup DME.


It turned out really good!  Fruity and dark with a very noticeable alcohol
smell.  


Anyway, keep on brewin'
Jon Gibbens
