Subject: Possible solution to commercial posts ?


After reading the discussions about whether or not commercial
posts should be allowed on the Homebrew Digest I checked up on
an automatic mailer package that may hold one solution to the problem.


Mail-Net (automatic mailing list handling software) allows uses to 
subscribe to different "channels" of the same news group. For 
example, the HBD could have a "commercial" and "non-commercial" channel.
When users subscribe to the newsgroup they would specify which channel
they wish to receive and when posting articles they would specify which
channel the article should go to. Non-commercial submissions would appear
on both channels of the HBD whereas commercial submissions would only appear
on the commercial channel of the HBD.


eg If I wanted to receive both commercial and non commercial postings of the 
HBD I would subscribe to the HBD with the following keyword in either the 
header or first line of the message: "X-Mn-Key: commercial" 


Then if I wanted to post a non commercial submission I would specify the 
subject in the header as usual and put the keyword "X-Mn-Key: non-commercial"
in the first line of my message. Similarly if I wanted to post what would be 
deemed to be a commercial submission I would specify "X-Mn-Key: commercial"
in the first line of the message.


This approach obviously doesn't solve the fundamental differences of opinion 
about the content of the HBD but it does offer some freedom from commercial 
posts if that is what you want. Ofcourse the whole system falls down if the 
keyword "X-Mn-Key: commercial" is not put on the first line of commercial posts.




Food for thought anyway.




Cheers,


Murray.

       HOMEBREW COMPETITION


Yes, folks, it's that time of year again.
And if you didn't notice, the Houston Foam Rangers
are trying to get off their backsides and actually
get this thing organized early this year!


The 1993 Dixie Cup will be held Ocotber 15 and 16 
at the Houston Holiday Inn West.


The official Dixie Cup Entry stuff can be requested
from the folks at 
DeFalco's Home Wine and Beer Supplies

over anything in this post (in case I goof).


ELIGIBILITY
Anyone can enter, the competition is open to all 
non-commercial,home-produced beers.

brewery are not eligible.  You may enter as often 
as you wish, but only two entries per 
category/subcategory per person please.

11-12 oz. All labels must be removed, 
but caps don't have to be blacked out.  
An entry label must be attached to each bottle 
of the entry, with all information 
required on the form filled in.
(Actually, all we need is you name, a telephone no., 
full snail mail address, category abbreviation, 
club affiliation, and any special ingredients or 
deviant style info, so you could type this up 
yourself and forgo the "official" form)
PLEASE USE RUBBER BANDS TO 
ATTACH THE FORM TO THE BOTTLE.

(We want to print the recipies later in the 
newsletter, if you win.  You can always give

We are looking for beer for the micro

to it, bring a couple of sixes of your 
favorite local brew.  Also, if you know 
a brewer personally, have them contact 
us if they feel like getting their 
product "exposed" to the Houston Market.

Subject: re: clean glasses and head retention


RE: Chris' question (and subsequent replies) about head retention, dish-
washing detergents, etc., an old trick to make a "beer clean glass" (i.e
to cut through an existing "film") was to wet the glass then rub good old
fashioned table salt around the inside of the glass.  Typically you can
only reach the upper 1/3 of the glass with your fingers but this seems to
do the trick.  When you've finished with this "salt scrub", be sure to give
the glass a THOROUGH rinsing with plenty of water before pouring your beer.


I worked for several years for a beer distributor who was a zealot about
presenting his product in a "beer clean glass".  As I recall, he used to
give out free bags of trisodium phosphate to his draft customers so that
they might better clean their glassware. "If the bubbles stick to the side,
the glass ain't clean."

        Perhaps what you need is a flow-through water heater.  That way it 
heats the water to the desired temp as it passes through the pipe, no 
worrying (not that homebrewers worry) about the time to heat up 40 gallons 
of water.

        Recently I made some starters the quick and dirty way, since I 
realized Friday morning I hadn't started the yeast for Saturday's brewing 
session.  I scrapped the slant into a 640 mL Beck's bottle, added 500 mL 
sterile wort, capped it, SHOOK VIGOROUSLY for 5 minutes, removed the cap 
and put on an airlock.
        The satrter was cloudy with yeast by Saturday Night pitching time, 
and the kraeusen was crawling out the airlock (oops!) Sunday morning.  Of 
course, this was a fairly fresh slant.  One of my older slants took two 
days to get to that point.

I posted some ideas for yeast culturing in HBD #1192.  For some of the
questions pertaining to yeast culture in #1193, I refer you to those notes.
 I'll add a few more comments here.  But, first the disclaimer.  I am not a
yeast expert; outside of homebrewing I do not work with yeast.  However, I
do a fair amount of culturing of E. coli and animal cells, I have a
reasonable level of knowledge concerning the biochemistry and molecular
biology of yeasts, and I have access to a number of technical writings 
concerning yeast physiology and growth.  The methods that I have described
are idealized.  I realize that they are not always suitable to the setup of
most homebrewers.   I urge anyone reading them to take them as guidelines
that can be adapted to one's own system - deviation  is the accepted norm.

Probably not, to the first part.  Who knows for sure, to the second.

Possibly.  Allow your flamed loop to cool before picking (stab it into a
clear area of the agar - it should sizzle).  A hot loop may kill your
colony on the spot.  For a few mls in a liter, you're talking a long time
before you will even begin to see activity (see my previous posting). 
Presumably, you successfully picked a colony, as evidenced by the activity
seen in the "few ml" starter starter.


>3. How do other people build up a healthy sized started with spending half
>their life preparing storage vessels?


Again, my previous posting explains how I do it under ideal conditions.  It
really isn't a matter of five sterile containers, more like two or three. 
Here's a suggestion:  start with 2 ml in your sterile tube, add 8 ml the
next day to make 10 ml (assuming your tube holds 12-15 ml), the next day, add
50-100 ml to a thoroughly sanitized, if not sterile, mason jar or juice jar
(glass) (avoid detergents), pitch the 10 ml into the 50-100, bring your
starter up to volume with successive additions over the next two days.  At
each stage you really want to see vigorous growth before increasing the
volume.  A healthy, actively growing culture is the best way to minimize
bacterial growth.  If you add a little bit of yeast to a large volume, you
run the risk of pitching a highly contaminated culture.  Some bacterial
growth (acetobacter for one) may actually inhibit the growth of yeast.


FYI:  During exponential (or log phase) growth, yeast double every 90
minutes `at` 30 degree C with vigorous and constant aeration in specialized
media - this does not make for good beer, however.  Log phase can be
divided into three stages based on the rate of cell division (or the
proportion of budded cells within a culture): early log phase (cell-density
< 1 x 10 (E7) cells/ml), mid-log phase (1-5 x 10 (E7) cells/ml), and
late-log phase (5 x 10 (E7)-2 x 10 (E8) cells/ml.  At 2 x 10 (E8) yeast
cultures are considered saturated and the cell enter stationary phase.  So
you can see, if you dilute your culture well below 1 x 10 (E7) cells/ml,
you may lose your log phase growth.  Thus, even a ten-fold dilution may be
detrimental to your growth rate.  Pitching 500 ml of starter into 18.9
liters (5 gallons) constitutes a 38-fold dilution.  A saturated culture `at`
500 ml may get you to early-log phase.  BTW, bacteria may have a doubling
time 1/3 that of yeast.

I have similar questions myself.  I can tell you that I have a wit going
using a Hoegaarden culture.  It has been fermenting quite vigorously for 4
days now.  The fermentation is actually giving off some very pleasant
odors.  I've seen recipes that have used Hoegaarden yeast, so I assume that
it is okay.  I know nothing of Abt 12.  Chimay may be good, but I know of
one person who had a complete failure with it, and his skills are quite
esteemed in our local HB club.  Although the Duvel may be a conditioning
yeast it may not be complete junk.  Watch out for bacteria that may be
lurking in the bottle dregs.  I have tried culturing the Duvel yeast.  I
have succeded in only culturing the bugs instead, which may be
lactobacillus.  I know that the live yeast was present, but the bugs seem
to have overgrown the culture.  Orval is not necessarily junk either. 
Michael Jackson writes that Orval does two fermentations with single-cell
cultures and conditions with a 5-strain culture.  I don't know, but what do
you think the chances are that the yeast in the single cell culture is
present among the 5 strains during conditioning?  I'd guess it is there. 
You could probably isolate it, but is it worth the trouble?  Probably not. 
However, it would be interesting to use the 5-strain culture to condition
that trappist ale that you might attempt someday.  One thing to remember is
that many of the Belgian ales require a variety of yeast strains to yield
the final product.  If you plate them out, be sure to pick many colonies
for your stock culture.

Subject: Extract Efficency & Duvel Yeast


My personal preference is to measure the extract efficiency at the start of the
boil. It is, as someone said, the efficiency of the mashing and lautering
processes that are of the most interest. At this point, the character of the
wort is set, and you have recovered all of the sugars you are going to get. 


A point which no one has brought up is that if you are using any kettle
adjuncts (honey, sugars, etc.), you definitely want to do the calculation
before you add them. 


To get a good number, you must be very careful in the measurements taken, and
adjust the measured volume as well as the SG to your reference temperature. I
am amazed at the number of people who fail to include this correction. At 100
C, it will swing the apparent extract yield by 4%. To measure the (hot) volume
in my half-barrel kettle, I use a stainless ruler to get the distance from the
edge of the 12-in hole in the top to the surface of the liquid - to the nearest
mm. I made a calibration curve which I then refer to get the volume, which
should be within 0.12 liter or so. 


It goes without saying that an accurate hydrometer is needed as well. I prefer
the type with an integral thermometer and correction read-out. As far as the
correction for temperature goes, the best strategy is to cool the sample to the
reference temperature, or as close as is possible. The correction is indeed
dependent upon the wort gravity as well as its temperature, but the closer you
are to the reference, the smaller the error in ignoring it.


******************


Moortgat's Duvel is fermented with two strains of yeast, in separate un-equal
volumes. One of these two strains is used for the bottle conditioning, after
the yeast from the primary is filtered out. These details are from Jackson,
"The Great Beers of Belgium". I have a Duvel culture which was obtained from a
bottle a couple of years ago, shortly after it appeared in the local market.
Interestingly, the bottles out there now seem to be DOA, as several recent
attempts have yielded nothing. A fresh one from Belgium could be a different
story. The culture I have makes wonderful beer, though. It has a distinctive
Duvel flavor profile, and seems to build a livelier head than most others in my
experience. Two or three times a year, when I regenerate my collection of
twenty or so yeasts in 6-ml tubes of pale, un-hopped wort,  I always observe
these same characteristics.

<I'm a little confused here.  I don't ferment lagers warm, 48F-50F, and I've
always used the Noonan method of raising the temperature for the diacetyl
rest (~55F for 2 days), with good results.  Can you clarify this point, Jim?


I have received a bit of mail on this topic so it seems I have hit a nerve
on lagering.  The final test is in the finished product, and whether any 
detectable amounts of diacetyl survive.  The most important factor on this
is yeast strain selection.  G. Fix in the latest issue of Brewing Techniques
lists two tables relating the correlation between production and reduction
of diacetyl levels and yeast strains over time.  Two of the strains, including
the ever popular weihenstephan 34/70 produce much lower levels of diacetyl
than a third strain.  In all of the cases, each yeast is able to reduce the
level of diacetyl but the one that produced a lot initially was not able to
reduce the levels very low.  If one is using a strain that is a big diacetyl
producer, then it would seem that a higher temp diacetyl rest is in order to
acclerate the yeasts ability to metabolize and break down the diacetyl into
the two less bothersome constituants, see Fix's article.  It is my opinion
that if a strain does not produce much diacetyl, like 34/70, and primary 
ferementation is carried out at 48F, then there is no need to raise the 
temp to further reduce the levels.  Raising the temp to 55F is not that 
radical.  Raising it higher is done for rapid fermentation & lagering ala
Dr. Narziss.  This is a natural and easy technique where at the end of 
primary at 48F, the attemperater is turned off, allowing the temp to slowely
rise into the upper 50s.  After the rest, the lager period is reduced to 2-
3 weeks time.  If I remember the Fix article, not much reduction of diacetyl
occurs under 40F, so it would seem that this is a lower limit. 


I suggest leaving out the 55 stage on a batch using 34/70 and substitute the
brief rest at 42-44F for 2-3 days, and see if anything changes.  Whatever is
easier for you and works is what counts.

If you *really* like sour beer, get him to bring back some Rodenbach.
The regular Rodenbach is delicious, with a powerful fruity sourness.
They also have a Grand Cru if you can stand it...


I found some Rodenbach at Liquor Barn in San Francisco about 2 years ago,
but haven't seen it anywhere since.  Anyone ever tried to make it?  The
sourness comes from aging in oak, and young and old agings are blended.  The
Grand Cru is just the "old" beer that has been aged for up to two years!

Subject: Efficiency question


James DiPalma mentions that his efficiency seems higher pre boil
than postboil.  I am not going to deny the possibility that 
precipitated break material could account for the difference, but is
it also possible that the temperature of the wort might be a factor
in the volume estimation?  If you eyeball the volume of warm post
sparge preboil wort it is going to higher than at postchill 
temperature by quite a bit.  The sg at 80C is .971, at 90 .965, and
at 100 .958.  At 20 C it is 998.  (figures actually kg/m3/1000).
I usually measure both - but the initial sg is to see how much to
boil off, I I don't have volumes calibrated well anyway.  


Also, why is everyone so concerned about Zima?  It isn't beer and
doesn't pretend to be.  It is aimed at the wine cooler-prepackaged
mixed drink crowd.  A frined brought me back a Canadian drink called
Durango that was a fruit flavored malt beverage a few years ago, so Zima isn't 
the first.  It has a similar relationshiop to beer as a single malt
Scotch - an alcoholic drink made of malt, and noone complains about
Scotch.   Give it a break!  If you have to complain about Coor's use a better
reason - like Union relationships, Environmental damage, false advirtising
claims, or the fascist belief of the founder.  Zima is surely one of their 
venial sins, and it isn't as bad as Miller Clear, whcih does pretend to be a
beer.
