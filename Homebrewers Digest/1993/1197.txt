Subject: more on FaceMail...


I've had a request via private e-mail to be more forthcoming about the
facemail project, so here goes...


There are several software packages available that produce low-quality,
motion images on your, well maybe not your, but many computer screens. 
They go by a number of names, of which Quick Time and Video for Windows
are the most advertised.  As usual with multimedia, the advertising is
overblown and deceptive.... (I will skip my usual rant on the damage done
by advertising hype in my field)


None of these packages do video.  What happens is that the incoming video
stream is sampled and converted into a bitmap for every so many frames. 
Very few of the systems offer 30 frame per second (video speed) display
rates.  Those that offer sound with the video interleave digitized audio
with the picture bitmaps at substancial reductions in frame rate.


The net result is much more like the cartoon flip books than true motion
video.  Some systems use special hardware to get the frame rate up, but
this is an expensive compromise.


Most of the animated images occupy only a small portion of the screen, a
postage stamp....


So don't get your hopes up too much...


The good news:  I should be able to prepare complete runtime packages for
DOS, this will require a 33Mhz 386DX with a standard vanilla VGA for
acceptable performance.  These systems should be widely available.  I will
also produce a Quick Time version for the user-interface impaired, uh I
mean the rest of them, uh, you know, the fruit machine people.... 
Quicktime viewers are reasonably available among the Mac tribes.  The
Quick Time version will be later in arriving, since I have to steal
machine time at another site to convert the video.  Any Quick Time users
out there (Spigot owners?) who want to volunteer to speed up this process
will be very welcome.


So, I should be able to get stand alone programs for DOS and Mac owners
should be able to lay hands on the appropriate drivers.


These motion video (sic) files are pretty big, even when heavily
compressed.  Expect to spend a while downloading them.  Don't even
consider sending them UUencoded.... 


As I slowly work my way into this project, I'll be posting progress
reports.  The next step will be to do a rough edit on the videotape.  At
that time I'll report how things are looking and approximate runtimes. 
With any luck, this will be a Xmas present.  While I was in Portland, I
had a huge backlog of high-priority stuff pile up on me....


patience,


Paul.

Subject: re: yeast questions


 Thanks for the all the yeast question replies. I had a coupla other
folks reply directly via email yesterday, so now i've got another question:


 Is the yeast in the Wyeast packet in the inner (break to open) pouch,
or the outer pouch. I got one reply saying it was in the inner packet,
other replies seem to indicate otherwise.


 btw, the beer was gurgling away when I got home yesterday and both
batches have a healthy amount of krausen started. I re-hydrated and
pitched a packet of EDME dried yeast into one of em just in case, and
to see if I could taste the difference in the final beers (assuming
they both survive).


thanks,

Subject: Ice Beer--now there's a concept!


NY Times, Page D3, August 3, 1993:
 "Our northern neighbor is putting ice in our beer."
 
Banking on strong performance of a new product called "ice beer" in
Canada, Molson Breweries palns to introduce Molson Ice next week on a
trial basis in Atlanta and Michigan.


Basically they go on to say that they almost freeze the beer--and then
remove the ice crystals. It supposedly leads to a smoother and (this is
true) more alcoholic brew. However, "It is being marketed for its
smoothness and distinctive, full flavored taste. The fact it has higher
alcohol is a fact not a market element" (yeah right!)


Anyway, an interesting "New Brew From Molson," too bad the Germans already
invented it.

Subject: Recipe for Dunkelweizen needed


I'd like to have a go a making a dunkelweizen soon. I have
a few questions about recipe formulation:
1. What grain should I use, and how much, to get the colour
   right? I can get hold of chocolate, black patent and crystal malt,
   and roast barley. I could probably roast my own malt to give 
   an amber malt. I can't buy Cara or (mainland) European speciality
   grains. My best guess is crystal plus some chocolate.
2. Hops? Hallertauer?
3. Yeast? I know of no source of liquid cultures of wheat beer yeasts
   in the UK. I can buy several HefeWeizens, which of these do you
   think would make the best starter: Thurn und Taxis HefeWeizen
   or Roggen, or Erdinger DunkelWeizen? The last of these seems
   to throw a good sediment, so this is my first choice. Are all
   HefeWeizens bottle conditioned, or are some pasteurized?
4. Temperature? Unfortunately, I have no control over this,
   so I may have to wait for autumn before I start. The temperature
   in Bristol today is a sizzling 67F.


Thanks for any help,

Hello.


I am very interested in building a complete home brewery that would make
~10 gallon batches.  I've seen the some adds for complete set-ups for
$800.00 and up.  I'm sure I can do it myself for a lot less.
Since I know someone out there has built one themselves, I'm hoping
that someone can share advice, cost approximations, or even schematics
(in any form, I have access to all platforms).


Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Hey folks - 
        Last week I posted a question regarding the pros and cons of
different methods of spice addition to a spiced ale (in boil, in
fermenter, as a tea, alcohol derivatives etc) - note: I have
investigated the Cat_s Meow and back HBD issues (back to 950)and have
found no real good "do this...dont do that" kind of information.  I have
also received several requests for a repost/forwarding of this
information.  So (since maybe a good deal of the readership was in
Portland), can anyone still answer this question?  TIA
        In addition I am looking for extract spiced ale recipes w/ o.g.s
at 1040-1060.  I have received one so far that looks promising....thanks
again                                 good luck and good beer

Subject: hops,1007,overnight mash


  FYI, male hops flowers are easily distinguished from the female
cones we all know and love.  Whereas mature female flowers are, well,
cones, like pine-cones, male flowers are quite different.  The
male flowers will consist of a number of short stalks, maybe 6 or
so, about 1/2" to 1" long, with a ball (hopefully) at the end of each,
which contains the pollen.  I say hopefully a ball, because if it's 
not a ball, it's an small open flower, and the pollen has been (is
being) released.


  Wyeast 1007 (German ale) has produced a very vigorous fermentation 
every time I have used it.  Probably a good yeast to use in the summer.  
Surprisingly, it can make a very fine Porter.


  Never mashed overnight, but I have mashed and sparged, and then
boiled the next day.  I know it sounds dangerous, but I've seen
no indication of souring.  My mash/sparge technique is such that
exposure of the wort to spoiling organisms is minimized, but then
again, I may have just been lucky.  It is a very convenient way
to brew. I don't think I'd recommend it during the summer though, 
or in a less than squeaky clean environment.

Subject: Multiple Styles from single mash/boil




I have just recently begun doing 10gal batches, and am looking for
ways to get two separate styles from a single mash/boil.  For
example, my last batch was a 50% wheat mash. After boiling and
cooling, I separated the wort into two 5gal fermenters. Into one, I
pitched Wyeast 3056 (a Weizen strain).  Into the other, I pitched
Wyeast 1007, with which I have had good luck making wheat beers. In a
few days, I will add some fresh fruit to this batch (perhaps
blackberries or peaches), thus I will end up with two separate batches
from a single mash/boil.


Does anyone have suggestions for other mixed-batch recipes, from a
single mash/sparge/boil?
For example, I had considered making both a Helle- and Dunkel-Weizen
by doing a separate, very small steep of some chocolate malt, boiling
the resulting liquor, and adding this to one of the fermenters. Would
this have worked out? Any other suggestions?


E-mail is fine; I'll post any interesting suggestions.

Subject: rebottling


Hi,
   As a favor for my upcoming wedding, I decided to brew a batch, print up a
label and give it out.  My usual container for bottling is a two liter glass
container ( carry-out from my local brew pub ).  My problem is I only 
bottled 55 12-oz'ers for the wedding, put the rest in 2-liters ( hey, I like to
drink my beer ), and last night my fiancee informed me that I would need 60
bottles because she miscounted.  The beer is an ESB from extract, OG of 1.054
and FG of 1.012, using a Munton and Fison dry yeast.  It was bottled 3 days 
ago.
   My question is is it possible to rebottle from the 2-liters to the 12-oz 
bottles?  I assuming I will need to re-prime the smaller bottles, and that 
enough yeast will still be present to carbonate the beer.  But what effect
will the dissolved CO2 have ?  should I allow the beer to go flat first?

 are bacteria, flora or fauna?  My guess would be, again, fauna.  I have

 And I am responding because I am bored and can't find anything else in this 
 issue to argue with.
 
 Many modern taxonomists prefer to create an entirely new kingdom for all 
 fungi and hence they are neither flora nor fauna.
 
 The general concesus however, is to place fungi in the Plant Kingdom and they 
 therefore become flora.  Although some slime mold plasmodium do migrate 
 impresively over a substrate, this does not change their taxonomic position 
 as flora nor are they any more closly related to yeast than a mushroom.
 
 Yeasts are somewhat unique in that they are single celled organisms with 
 little or no propensity to form colonies.  This is also true of most bacteria 
 but they are miles away from each other taxonomically.  Yeast is as 
 evolutionarily removed from bacteria as far as humans are from yeast.
 The fundamental difference between bacteria and all the rest of us is that 
 they lack a nucleus and all the genetic implications involved it that.
 
 Bacteria are exceedingly primitive plants in current thinking although some 
 would again put them in a kingdom of their own.
 
 My reference to fauna invading the mash was in terms of flies or other animal 
 types that could get it if not covered or small enough to get in under the 
 cover.

Hi all,
IHTNPB (I Hate To Nit Pick But):
Methanol=wood alcohol=denatured alcohol, but NOT rubbing alcohol.
Rubbing alcohol is isopropanol(or 2-propanol).


Another thing,

To which I say (not that I am taking this seriously), IHTNPB, yeast?, slime 
molds? I think not. Yeast are unicellular fungi, and although some yeast 
can grow into multinucleate organisms complete with psuedohyphae and other 
technical words, they cannot move, aggregate, grow a stalk, or do any of the 
other nifty things that slime molds can do.  Slime molds, however, make bad 
beer, so I would call it even. Also, to relegate fungi to the animal 
(fauna) kingdom or to the plant (flora) kingdom seems to me to be 
unnecessarily restrictive.  I believe that the correct scientific term for 
anything that is smaller than a mouse and that does not nurse its young is the 
word "bug" (from the greek, I believe).

Well, despite the fact that I haven't done an all-grain Weizen, I would
like to propose that perhaps it's a good protein rest that is essential
for a brew with a large percentage of wheat and not necessarily a 
decoction mash that's essential.  Indeed, the decoctions will help
convert the starches in wheat, especially raw wheat, but I've tasted
quite a few very good weizens made with temperature-controlled (step)
mashes.


On a semi-related topic: mashing technique nomenclature.  There's a lot
of conflicting information in the books and magazines regarding the
following point.  The point is that:


   "step-infusion mashes == temperature-controlled mashes."


What I mean here by temperature-controlled, is stovetop mashing, where
the burners are used to raise the mash from protein rest to saccharification
rest to mashout.  *I believe* that step-infusion mashing is NOT the same,
rather it is a method whereby hot water is *infused* into the mash to raise
its temperature.  Do I have this nomenclature right?  I've read conflicting
views on this.


This would imply that there are basically four methods of mashing (the last
having multiple variations):


1. single-infusion   --  add a measured amount of water at a calculated
temperature to bring a measured amount of grain to saccharification
temperature.  Mashout is often not done and the hot sparge water is what
effectively ends the conversion.


2. step-infusion  --  add a measured amount of water at a calculated temp
to bring a measured amount of grain to protein rest temperature.  Add
another infusion of hot water to bring the mash to saccharification temp.
Finally, add boiling water to get the mash to mashout temp.


3. temperature-controlled  --  dough-in (cool water) or mash-in (protein
rest temperature) with the full mash volume of water.  Add direct heat to
raise the temperature to other rests.


4. decoction  --  dough-in or mash-in with the full mash volume and then
remove parts of the mash to a kettle in which this "mash fraction," which
is called a decoction, is heated to boiling and then returned to the rest
of the mash to raise it's temperature.  There are several variations to
this (double (two decoctions), triple (three decoctions), etc.) in which
some of the decoctions are replaced by infusions or the entire mash is
moved to a kettle and then direct heat is used in place of one or more
decoctions.  It is interesting to mention that decoction mashing can
be done WITHOUT A THERMOMETER, given enough experience, which I've read
is the reason that it was invented (they did not HAVE thermometers at the
time).

Question #1)
I am planning to make a porter whost recipe calls for 5# of dark
malt extract.


I have 3.3# of dark and 1.7# of light.  I have heard that their is
a way I can use the light in place of dark if I add roasted barley,
black patent, or chocolate malt.  Is this wise?  Which should I 
use if it is?  How much?  On that note, is there any rule o' thumb
for substitutions like this?


Question #2)
I was at the local health food store (People's Food Coop, Ann Arbor)
yesterday and I noticed that they had bulk "barley malt" they sold by the
pound.  Is this type of stuff ever suitable for brewing?  Anyone ever
try?  It is about $1.50/lb so it seems it would be a cheap experiment
to brew something with it?  Any suggestions?

This had better be boiled and cooled water -- *everything* must be sanitized

Yes... I did, at that place with three names (something Bakery,
something Restaurant and Widmer Brewery (although it is technically
next door)).  I don't have my tasting notes here, but I remember it
was very good.  I recall it had an OG of 1066 and did have a noticable
alcoholic component to the flavor.  It was really the first American-
made Bock I've tasted which I feel deserved to be called a Bock.
Most I've had don't have that alcoholic component.  If you like
Widmer Bock, you might as well take any remaining Henry's and MDG
out of your fridge and store it warm for rinsing kegs... you'll need
the room for some of the great bottled beers in the PNW!

Ideally, and if you have the patience, harvest each cone
as it becomes ripe.  Ripe cones are noticably lighter, drier
and "fluffier" than un-ripe.  If it begins to turn yellow
at the tips, then it's over-ripe.  Note that you will still
have to dry them before storing them away.  I don't have my
notes here, but last year, I believe my hops lost 90% of
their weight during drying -- I used a food dessicator, but
I think it was too hot (too rough on them).

Yes it's possible, but you need to give it a day or two to start.  You may
have picked up some viable yeasties, but dry yeast is quite a bit faster
starting than the small amount of SNPA yeast (which by the way bears a
striking resemblence to Wyeast #1056), so the SNPA yeast contribution was
probably imperceptable.

Both.  The 1007 is notorious for a BIG kraeusen and the wheat malt will

First off, I virtually always use some flavor hops in the last 15 minutes
of the boil, often 20 to 40% of the IBUs in the last 15 minutes.


Secondly, I use Jackie Rager's formulas, but add 10% since I use a hop
boiling bag and another 10% if I use whole hops in stead of pellets.
I have not had my beers tested for actual IBUs, but my taste buds seem
to confirm that my numbers are right.  My boil hops are usually in for
60 to 90 minutes.

I'm quite certain that most breweries don't boil that long, let alone
boil their hops that long.  I've read that the maximum utilization one can
expect from hops is 30% of the alpha acids and according to various
hop utilization tables I've seen, anything more than 60 minutes does
not increase hop utilization significantly.

In HBD #1195 Jim Grady <grady`at`hpangrt.an.hp.com> asks:


>  1. Some have mentioned that they sanitize their counterflow chillers
     by running boiling water through them.  How do you get the boiling
     water in the chiller without scalding yourself?


I'd like to point out a technique I've been using with my counterflow chiller
for about the last 8 batches.  It improves sanitation while reducing the work
involved.


I must say first of all that one needs a hot water pump.  About 5 minutes
before the end of the boil I setup the counterflow chiller: To do this I place
a pick up tube in the boiler and attach its output to the input of my hot water
pump.  The output of the hot water pump is then attached to the input of my
counterflow chiller.  It's important (for priming purposes) to have the pump
upstream of the counterflow.  Otherwise there's too much dead-volume and
priming becomes a nightmare.  Leaving the counter-flowing water turned
off (sic) I start the system from the output-side of the chiller.  Once started
I direct the output back into the boiler.  Within 15 seconds this tepid wort
reaches a temperature of 180F, since it's not being chilled.  I leave the
system pumping this way for 5-10 min.  During this interval the entire chiller
is sanitized.  Any pathogens originally in the chiller are quickly killed
either in place or as they are carried to the boiling vat.


At this point I turn the burner off and the counter-flowing water on.  Within
a minute the effluent drops to pitching temp and I then direct it to the
waiting fermentor.  The nice thing is the system only needs to be plumbed
once--for both sanitizing and chilling.  This saves a lot of time and
minimizes the hassle of sanitizing the chiller.

        Hey all, 


        First..I made my first all grain a month ago.  I'm pleased with
        the results...no it wasn't harder but it took a while longer to
        clean up.  Anyway, the plunge has been took.  Now.  I saved the
        leftover yeast slurry in a (hopefully) clean sanitized Mason Jar.
        It went into my beer fridge and nicely settled out into several
        layers of color.  Well my electric bill decided the beer fridge
        had to be shut off.  Now a month later, I have this mason jar
        in a hot fridge in a hot garage (New Mexico is HOT in July)
        full of hoy yeast.  Are they still good?  The top has bowed
        up quite a bit.  Should I throw it away and buy more or if I can
        use it....what now?

I saw the recent article about All About Beer by (sorry, I forgot.)
I just received the premiere issue of a magazine called "Beer the magazine
" It is put out by Bill Owens, founder of Buffalo Bill's in Hayward and
publisher of American Brewer magazine. The book is about beer, not specifi-
cally brewing. But, it may be of interest to some of you. I talked to Bill
about 8 months ago andhe mentioned a Wine Spectator (ie tabloid, high-gloss)
format. The magazine looks way better than I could have imagined.


Some articles:
Hot&Wet - Chili Beer
Wheat Beers - Feature article & reviews
Beerspective - A column by (you guessed it) M. Jackson
Interview with Alan Eames (the Beer King)
Easy Homebrew - Easy Steps to Better brew


etc. etc.


The magazine is fat and contains many articles. It might be worth
a look but again, it is aimed for consumers. I have no financial interest
in the magazine but I thought you all might be interested. E-mail me
for more info.

Subject: RE: Yeast = animals?


The perception that bacteria are "plants", and protozoa are "animals" is an
old one, no longer held to be useful or valid. While no single biological
classification is accepted by all, a currently popular one is the so-called
"Five Kingdom System". The imbibers of beer are in the "Animalia", the
hops and barley are in the "Plantae", the yeasts are in the "Fungi", the
unwanted (but sometimes necessary) bacteria are in the "Monera", and the
protozoa (often in the water until boiled) are in the family "Protista".
Another name for the "Monera" is "Prokaryotae", the kingdom in which the
bacteria reside. All monerans are unicellular, and have no no organized
nucleus, in contrast to the multicellular members of the "Plantae". As you
can see there is little sense in persisting with the idea that bacteria are
plants!


The term "microflora" has been and still is widely used to descibe
populations of bacteria, but this usage too is falling away, to be replaced
by the more neutral "microbiota". I hope this helps!

one open and find that some other critter got to it before my yeast-of-choice

  Regarding yeast starters beginning with a petri dish.  At the Yeast
Culturing class given by Siebel at the conference last Saturday, they
tell commercial brewers to increase volume by no more than 5 times
per step so that the yeast would get accustomed to eating various
sugars as they'll be found in the wort.  The did concede that homebrewers
with low volumes of well-areated wort could get by with step increases
greater x 5.  I go from 5 ml to 50 to 500 then finally to 1500.  Diacytl
or excessive unfermentables don't seem to be a problem.  They also
recommended starter gravities around 1048 unless the target beer is high
