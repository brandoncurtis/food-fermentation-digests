There are 3 different dohicky systems now patented and used in the UK for
draught beer in a can. The Guinness system has been described here before. 
The "draughtflow" system is owned by Whitbread and, for example, is used by
them in Boddingtons. I don't know the commercial relationship 'twixt Murphy's
and Whitbreads.


The draughtflow system has a larger capsule containing pressurised N2. The 
'lid' of the capsule contains a tiny hole (in the middle) which is closed,
whilst the can remains under pressure, by the end of a 'peg' protruding from
the centre of the 'base' of the capsule (the 'base' being the opposite side
to the 'lid'). As the can is opened, its pressure drops, the N2 in the capsule
expands thus flexing the lid away from the peg and thereby opening the tiny
hole through which most of the N2 now passes. Hey presto!


If this is the system in Murphy's, there is an interesting demonstration you
might attempt. The nature of the system is such that not all the N2 escapes
and the capsule is still under slight pressure. Identify which is the lid by
locating the hole. Using a suitable implement (eg the edge of a coin) gently
prise the lid off the body of the capsule. With a 'pop' the lid will fly
across the room. OF COURSE be careful about 'flying object'


And if you are the type that hasn't any common sense and sue at the drop of
hat, don't do it, or don't bother sueing - the UK civil laws are different
from the US. :-)

Subject: Culturing yeast from bottled beers


Recently I came across some interesting statistics of
the 1990 and 1991 open championships for amateur brewers
,organised by "de Roerstok" in tilburg.
They have published a booklet with a lot of information
on the homebrew entered in this competition.
Since questions pop up every now and again about
culturing yeast from bottles, I will summarize a nice 
table from this (without permision, so destroy this before
you read it):


The #1 field indicates the total number of entries, #2 is the
number that scored over 6.4 (assuming that these are succesful
attempts), the score is the average score on a scale of 
0[Yech]-10[Yum] for the 'over 6.4' beers
(Not quite sure if Yech and Yum are SI units or Imperial)


Beer/brewer     #1  #2  Score

Achouffe        3   2   7.5

Brugse Tripel   2   2   7.4

West Vleteren   5   4   7.6
Wieckse witte   1   1   7.3


Note 1: The fact that a certain yeast gives a good score does
not mean that it is the original brewing yeast of the beer.
For some of the above I'm almost certain that a bottling strain
has been cultured; but then, if it tastes good who cares ?
Note 2: Of the top 12 of 1991 only two beers were brewed with
cultured yeast (Chimay and West Vleteren).

Subject: Re: water filters -- a data point




I have been using a T-10 carbon filter on the cold water line
in my kitchen for 3 years now.  I replace the filter every 6 months
or so.  I extract/adjunct brew and sanitize with bleach.  I rinse
and brew with water out of the tap that has been filtered.  I have
yet to have an infection.  I boil about 2 gallons and top up to five
with water out of the tap.  Searching about madly for a piece of
wood upon which to knock, I say that there has never been a problem
with this method.


The reasoning is that the water coming into the filter and surrounding
the filter on the inlet side is sanitized.  I flush the filter out
by letting the water run for a minute before using it for anything
critical, and bacteria never have a chance to take hold.


I got mine from American Brewmaster and paid less for it (and it's
a big under-sink filter) than something cheaper-looking at the hardware
super-store.

Subject: S. cerevisiae & S. delbrueckii


There's been a little discussion about the 'correct' name of this yeast. I 
know little about the technicallities, but I can add a few more 'facts'. (I 
like facts 'cos they can cause such good arguments)


When I first saw reference to S. delbrueckii (yes I first came across it on
HBD), I checked my catalogue from the AFRC National Collection of Yeast
Cultures (NCYC) and found that no such yeast was listed, so I was a bit
confused. My confusion was relieved when I located a couple of yeasts that
had been originally deposited under the name S. delbrueckii, but now were 
classified with a different name.


I found S. cerevisiae strain number 92, deposited in 1933 by A.C.Chapman,
original deposit name S. delbrueckii, NCTC 3964. (NCTC = National Collection
of Type Cultures, Collindale). There was no ATCC number. So I concluded that
the S. delbrueckii were really just strains of S.cerevisiae, but that (home)
brewers used the term S. delbrueckii as a convenient 'handle' by which they
could refer to a particular strain (or strains).


I also found Torulaspora delbueckii (perfect form of Candida colliculosa)
with 10 strains listed, all of which had been originaly deposited under a 
different name (I was amused by S.inconspicuous.  NRRL Y-7435). One of these,
number 408, had been deposited as S delbueckii var mongolicus.


I think I shall stick with my first assumption, which corresponds nearest to
that of Jim Busch. Perhaps because it gives me a warmer feeling :-). That is,
S. delbrueckii might not be the correct name, but when we use it, we refer to
those yeasts, now considered strains of S. cerevisiae that have particular
properties of interest to us; namely they make good wheat beer.


OK. So that contains a few more facts; what's the truth?

Pete's Wicked Clone


      Source:   Richard Stern (rstern`at`col.hp.com)
                 10/16/92


       Ingredients:


                 8-9 pounds, pale malt
                 1 pound, crystal malt
                 1/4 pound, chocolate malt mash at 155F
                 1/2 ounce, Cascade (60 min boil)
                 1/4 ounce, Chinook (60 min boil)
                 1/2 ounce, Cascade (10 min finish)
                 Wyeast #1056


       Procedure:


       Mash malts at 155 F. Add 1/2 ounce Cascade and 1/4  ounce of Chinook for
       boil. Use 1/2 ounce Cascade to finish.


       Comments:


       I've requested a recipe for Pete's Wicked Ale, but nobody sent one, so I
       guess I'm going to  have to wing  it. This recipe  is based on  the GABF
       program, which says " Pete's has: pale, crystal and chocolate malts, and
       Chinook and Cascade hops. OG: 14P" (Isn't that 1.056?)


       Pete's is pretty malty with a low hop bitterness and  aroma. I think the
       malt combination should  be ok, as  long as I  get enough body  from the
       155F mash temperature.

Subject: Mini Kegs


I bought, use, and like the 5 liter mini kegs.  Some stores sell imported.
commercial beer in these kegs.  These can be reused if you have a tapper
like the one that comes with the Brew Ha Ha offer and DO NOT use the method
recommended with the purchase.


I too had foaming problems until the found the secret of the tapper.  Once 
the pressure gets low, add only a little bit more of CO2 and then turn the
CO2 back to the off position; in other words, don't keep the CO2 pressure 
on -- after a few seconds, turn it off and proceed.




Subject: Q: Briess DME


After reading Dr. Raines's posting on HBD concerning contaminated Briess DME, 
I wonder if there is a way to identify "bad" lots.  I recently purchased from 
Brewers Resource 25 lbs of Briess, Brewers Gold DME.  I first brewed with it
only a few days ago, but I brewed a Trippel with 10 lbs of the Briess.


I would really hate to find out in four months that I brewed with 
the contaminated lot.

Yup, sure have seen 'em and I have perhaps 1 or 2 left in my closet.  When
I went to Ireland last year (Oct '92), I grabbed a couple of 4-packs to
bring home w/ me.  When I first sampled it, i thought it was better then
guinness in a can.  Pretty much the same design as guinness, as far as i
can tell.


I've had guinness in a can that one can buy in the states.  the ones i brought
back from ireland, imo, we better tasting then the cans bought in the states.
unscientific datapoint, fwiw! :-).

Subject: To Secondary or not to Secondary


In HBD1202 John in Boise writes that he and many brewers in his area
do not use a secondary fermentation.


I know this has been discussed several times, but I thought I would throw
in my $.02.  For quite a while I did not do a secondary fermentation:
I fermented in primary for about a week, then bottled.  The result was
beer that primed very quickly, but seemed to have a slight but harsh
flavor undertone.  The bottles also had a fair amount of yeast sediment.
I came to wonder if the harse undertone was a result of yeast autolysis.


I then tried shifting to doing a one-week primary fermentation, followed
by a one-week secondary fermentation.  The secondary step is actually more
of a rest to allow yeast to settle and thus be separated from the brew.
After bottling, the result is brew that primes more slowly, but throws less
yeast sediment.  That harse undertone also appears to be gone, and the
beer is noticeably smoother.


My conclusion: the settling of yeast that occurs in secondary produces a 
smoother brew than a single-step fermentation gives.  You can make
a drinkable beer faster using just a primary, but I amusing a secondary
settling step from now on....

 Well, while we're being 'constructive', I'll add my 2 cents.


 I sent her email about not mentioning B-Brite, which I had acquired

Subject: chipotle


Howdy,


In HBD #1202, Tom mentions how chipotles may be too spicy for beer.  This was
not the problem with the beer I discussed in #1201.  One of the two bottles
was too spicy; the other was quite tolerable in terms of spiciness.  My
warning is against putting the chipotle pepper directly into the bottle with
the beer.  The results were inconsistent & made an otherwise good beer
undrinkable.  Chipotles themselves, in terms of overall chili pepper spiciness,
are about mid-spicy, according to the measuring technique known as the
Scoville units.  Bell peppers rank low, like around 10, jalapenos (& by
extention, chipotles) are around 2500-5000, serranos around 5000-7000, and
habaneros around 3 billion (my figures may be a little off).  Please don't
get me wrong;  chipotles will hurt you if you just pop one into your mouth.
I'm just saying that if the spiciness of serranos can be controlled, then
the spiciness of chipotles can be controled.


Mexicali Rogue sounds like good stuff.  Any idea how the make it?

Mr Cox and Bill were talking about Grolsch bottles and sanitation of them
along with a few other things.


I have been using a mixture of Grolsch, Fischer Amber and regular bottles
with about every batch.  I use the Grolsch and Fischer bottles for myself
and the regular bottles go to friends.  :-)  


Anyways, all I do is soak all the bottles in the tub with a good amount of
bleach for an hour, rinse them, and bottle.  Nothing fancy.  I haven't had
a problem yet (10+ batches).  Also, keep in mind, the bottles I get are
from a Package Store that my roomate works at so I'd consider these worst
case type of bottles.


As far as carbonation goes, I notice 0% difference from bottle to bottle.
I keep all my bottle together in the dark, so I wouldn't expect a
difference.  There might be a difference if you had all the bottles exposed
to light I guess.  


The bottles are great to use if you can find them.  It beats the heck out
of capping.

  I've received a few similar inquiries via private email, so I thought
I'd post and reassure all concerned.
  The information I have is that the yeast that did not perform well is no
longer commercially distributed.  After about one year, it simply stopped
producing spicy, phenolic flavor characteristics, so it was replaced with
another strain quite some time ago.
  I obtained the older, non-performing strain from the yeast bank of a local
homebrew club, where it had apparently been stocked for a long time.  What
added to the confusion was that a member of this club, who is a mutual
acquaintance of Jim Busch and myself, had a weizen yeast that he listed as
"W66".  The two different numbers, in addition to the disparate performance,
contributed to the false perception that there were two different strains
in circulation.
  I've exchanged email with Jim on this issue, and he's assured me that the
strain currently being distributed as Weihenstephan #68 is displaying
considerably greater staying power than it's predecessor.  Having brewed a
few batches with it, I can personally vouch that this is a great weizen
yeast, and recommend it without reservation.

I use the aquarium pump idea in conjunction with my normal methods of
aeration.  I've tried this for numerous batches of ale and one batch of
lager.  My normal aeration method is to splash the beer while siphoning
it into my carboy and periodically stopping the siphon and shaking the
carboy vigorously.  I noticed a slight improvement in lag times for all
of the batches.


Lag time is controlled by a lot of variables.  Pitching volume (and what
stage the pitched yeast are in) probably has a greater effect on lag time
than the aquarium pump.


BTW, I would expect that Miller was almost certainly talking about ale
yeast in his 3-8 hours figure.

Certainly the water is only a small part of what goes into a fine beer,
but the importance of a good water source (especially for large
commercial breweries) can't be underestimated.  I think one of the
reasons that the Pacific Northwest and Colorado have become large
brewing centers *is* for the water -- it simplifies things greatly if
you can just use the city supply.  Water here in Fort Collins is great
right out of the tap; I don't have to pre-boil or add minerals or
anything.

And it's a crying shame, too.  Habaneros (also known as Scotch Bonnets)
have a wonderfully fragrant, sweet aroma that complements food, and
probably beer, very well.  Does anyone know of "de-capsiacin-ized"
habaneros or habanero essence without the fierce burn?  Where's the
chile-pepper mailing list?  Why is there a rec.food.sourdough but no
rec.food.chiles?  Thank goodness we have HBD and rec.crafts.brewing.

To the person who was worried about "wasting" 10 - 15 gallons
as they "perfected" a recipe:  My plan for formulating
a recipe is to find one of a similar style, either all-grain
or extract based, and copy its proportions of pounds of
grain or pounds of extract to hops (IBU's).  Add any other 
ingredients in the proportions you think, being on the gentle
side (better to underdo than overdo).  I have used this 
philosophy for perhaps 15 batches, and have always had very
drinkable results.  I don't worry that "it doesn't taste 
exactly like Bass," because I don't care that much - if it
is a well-made beer, they taste great.

Subject: The Tumbleweed Report (Part 4)


Having covered the equipment we're using at Tumbleweed, now I'm really 
going to bare my soul concerning the brewing procedures, ingredients, 
and recipe decisions we faced.  I find this part particularly interesting 
because here is where we found it necessary to scrap ideas that had been 
cast in stone for us as homebrewers.  All sorts of factors caused us to 
rethink basic procedures.  Clearly, our main concerns were the change in 
scale and the economics of trying to make money.  It's funny how money (or 
the lack thereof) can influence decisions! 


Ingredients and Materials:


The biggest question was whether we were going to continue with the extract 
beers Tumbleweed was brewing with and brewing, in all honesty, rather 
poorly.  Should we go all-grain?  Or bear down on producing a decent 
extract beer? 


Since I've been brewng all-grain beers for 12 years, I thought long and 
hard about the feasibility of all-grain brewing in 40 or 60 gallon batches.  
To go that route we would have had to design an awfully big insulated mash 
tun.  We would have had to worry about the ever changing mineral content of 
the town water we were using.  We had to worry about where to store and 
grind the grain in an already overcrowded space.  As if this wasn't 
daunting enough, we would be looking at 12 hour brewing days.  With my 
teaching duties at ASU and the demands of operating BrewCo, I frankly 
didn't have that kind of time. 


So we decided to brew with extracts.  Since this was, in some sense a 
"cheat", we figured we'd cut no corners on the rest of the process.  We 
would use pure yeast cultures, fresh hops, specialty grain infusions, and 
filter our water. 


Extracts were appealing because (1) storage was easy (we already had a 
walk-in cooler), (2) it cut our brewing day down to 6-8 hours, and (3) we 
could count on a certain stability in the malt product and didn't have to 
worry about the variability in the quality of grain and the headache of 
wrestling with our water.   We had enough to worry about already so far as 
redesigning the equipment and getting used to brewing on a larger scale was 
concerned.  Later, after we got all these factors under control, we figured we 
could consider the move to all-grain.


The decision to brew with extracts still bothers me.  I could see myself 
making excuses (like I'm doing now) to my brewing buddies and my newly 
acquired peers in the commercial brewing world.  But this was no time 
to be dogmatic.  Instead we had to be realistic about the physical brewing 
environment and the market we were trying to crack.  I've had enough bad 
all-grain beers to know that the decision to go all-grain was not going to 
ensure a high quality product.  And I've had enough outstanding extract 
beers to know that it *is* possible to brew a decent beer using extracts.  
Technique is everything.  We inherited some pretty sorry ingredients when 
Burton and I signed on.  The extracts were old and stale.  The hops were 
pelletized and God knows how well they were stored before we got them.  
Still we brewed with what we had and the difference between what we brewed 
and what was brewed before was noticed by all.  The quality improved even 
more once we started getting fresh malt, fresher hops, and instituted the 
hop back. 


Regarding our market, we had to be realistic about what the common drinking 
public was going to expect from us.  We figured they wanted a beer that was 
a huge cut above Budmiller.  No problem.  But I didn't really expect them 
to come in and be disappointed if they weren't drinking beers comparable to 
a Pilsner Urquell, a Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout, or a Liberty Ale.  


Neither did we expect, nor have we found, very many beer drinkers that are 
going to get down to the level of criticism that we have come to expect 
from ourselves and our fellow homebrewers.  So, what the hell, we resigned 
ourselves to the conclusion that the extracts, though unlikely to produce 
that godalmighty awesome beer we all dream about, would allow us to turn 
out a fairly reliable, quality beer that would be as good or better than 
anything the average guy ever drank out of a bottle and would impress 99% 
of the people who walked through our door. 


And they have.  Most of the homebrewers who come into Tumbleweed are 
surprised to learn they're drinking an extract beer.


We started out using Premier's 100% malt extract.  It comes to us in 5 
gallon pails and is as clean as a whistle.  So far we've found that it 
doesn't attenuate below 1.012.  The color is not as light as Alexander's, 
which we've just began experimenting with.  The Alexander's is very light 
in color and attenuates to below 1.010. 


Our present feeling is to use the Alexander's on our lighter beers and 
stay with the Premier for our heavier ales when we want the higher terminal 
gravities.  We like the idea of using two extracts because this gives us 
some diversity in the different beers we brew.  We're also playing with 
Briess at the moment but the results aren't in as yet.  If we find that 
they all produce clean beers then we'll play around with mixing them 
together for single batches to add even more complexity to the malt side of 
the flavor profiles. 


Of course, these aren't just straight extract beers.  We only buy light 
malt extract and depend on specialty grain infusions/steepings as the water 
comes to a boil to add grain character to the beer.  Nothing new here.  
1000's of homebrewers have been doing this for years.

completely unlikely.  As far as I've been able to determine over the

about 250 (ppm?) and the alkalinity is about 170. 


I tried my first partial mash a few weeks ago, tasted the results last night,
and it is OK, but had noticeable tannic astringency.  I recall hearing that
the pH of the sparge water has a strong effect on tannin extraction during
sparging.  


For the record, I kept the sparge water at or below 168 deg F, and I had
to cut the sparging short because another user needed the kitchen resources.
The initial runnings were > 1.080, final > 1.020.

Hi all!  I've been a homebrewer for about a year now, and since I live in a

A few days ago, I saw a brief post on the HBD where someone said NOT to

I know Papazian says to do this, and while I would not jump off a bridge
if he told me to, I had never heard otherwise (I am a new subscriber to HBD).
My brews have all been quite good (if I don't say so myself), so I don't

>Should I just "waste" 10 - 15 gallons of brew for each style until I get

particulars of and suggestions for recipe formulation? 


If beer the is drinkable it is never a waste (obvious but worth 
mentioning!).  The 1991 Special Styles issue of Zymurgy has a wealth of 
information concerning styles.  The Cat's Meow here on the net also has 
literally hundreds of recipes classified by style, although not as tightly 
classified as the Zymurgy issue. Most issues of Zymurgy also have the style 
guidelines describing the characteristics of a style for competition entry. 
 There are also many books which have specific recipes included, the 
Winners Circle comes to mind offhand, but there are several.


As a final tidbit there are also computer programs which can help you 
formulate recipes to duplicate styles. My program, the Brewer's Workshop, 
has the style definitions from Zymurgy built in and calculates gravity, 
bitterness and color so you can match those characteristics of a particular 
style.  Please note that there are other programs that do the same thing, I 
am not trying to make this a commercial. People tend to get very touchy on 
the net when they smell advertising.  


I would recommend starting with the styles issue and working from there.  
There were also two good articles in the first issue of Brewing Techniques, 
one by Darryl Richman on recipe formulation and another article on recipe 
formulation using a spreadsheet.  Hope this gets you started in the right 
direction.  Prosit!

Going back to an earlier discussion about using higher ammounts of Irish
Moss, I have a data point. I brewed last weekend and I upped my IM rate
from 1 teaspoon to 1 Tablespoon per 5 gallon batch. After racking to the
secondary the beer is already a lot clearer. The interesting thing was
the sediment in the bottom of the primary. I use a plastic bucket for
the primary and ususlly the sludge in the bottom is a slurry of hop
particles and other small particle precipitate. Kind of a loose mud
consistancy. With the higher rate of IM it had more the consistancy of
large flake oatmeal. It had large chunks of what I think is protien. I
will be interested in the difference in body. I won't be able to do a
direct comparison as my kegs should be arriving today and the bottles
are going to the recycler. Unless there is someone in the Olympia WA
area that wants 4 cases of well used bottles (I am keeping a couple
cases)

Norm,
  I did this, and you can have it if you want it.  I am building a
true counterflow chiller tonight. I had to run _huge_ amounts of water
through the damn thing to get sufficient cooling, and that's not PC
out here in drought land.  I put 50' of 3/8" od? copper tubing in a 5
gallon bucket, and attached garden hose fittings to the bucket as
well.  When I tried to attach a hose to the outflow to use the water
in the garden, the top of the bucket kept popping off, if I used
enough cold water flow to chill the wort enough.

Subject: Kegged Chili-Beer


I have done quite a few chili-beers in the past, including one on draft. 
Here's how:
I used 5 ounces of serrano and jalapeno peppers in the last 15 minutes of the
boil.  The peppers were halved and seeded.  Since the batch size was 10
gallons, the heat and flavor from the chilis was very subtle.  My partner
bottled his half and I kegged mine.
Desiring more chili character, I decided to "dry-chili" the brew.  Using a
muslin hop bag and a generic zip-tie, I contained  approx. 1 ounce of dry
whole peppers and 1 ounce of serrano peppers (fresh) halved and seeded.  I
boiled the whole works for about 5 minutes to sanitize and threw it into the
keg.  The beer had already been carbonated and was chilled.
Within three days the brew went from mild to hot, with incredible complexity
and depth.  I opened the keg and removed the bag 'o' chili, re-sealed the keg
and purged the O2.
Afterward, I noticed two things:
1)  The beer did not become tainted one bit in the four months I had it on
tap, so the process, although unorthodox, resulted in no obvious flaws.
2)  Within a week of "dry-chiling" the beer fell brilliantly clear.  Hmm. . .
Overall, a very good experience and I'll try it again.

I've been following the recent thread about hot pepper sauce in brews.


Please forgive me if this has been posted before. The hot pepper sauce itself
is fermented. This is what I remember from a documentary about Tabasco Sauce.


The red peppers, presumably red chiles, are macerated and comprise the
mash. They ferment in wood barrels under a layer of salt which is about
an inch thick.


Particulars are a trade secret, as such I don't know them. The yeast,
any additives, i.e. sugar, and type of wood I'd have to guess.


This all happens on an island in Louisiana, so I'd assume that it's a
rather warm ferment.


The stuff sits for about three years, after which the salt is removed,
the barrel emptied and the mash is infused with vinegar. The whole
magilla is then pressed and bottled.


If you've got some gallon bottles around, a bunch of peppers, and lots of
patience, why not give it a shot? (How's mine? What, are you kidding?)

The snag is that each manufacturer's extracts have very different numbers.
I've found less variability in dry extracts, but syrups I've used go all
the way from 35 up to 40.


LAGER 2-ROW     35      1.7

PALE ALE        36      3
PILS 2-ROW      35      1.2


Again, potential varies by maltster and the condition of the malt when
you get it.  Are there a lot of different malts available to us homebrewers?
You bet:  DeWolf-Cosyns, Crisp Maris Otter, Ayinger, Briess, Great Western,
Minnesota Malting, Gambrinus, Munton & Fison, Golden Promise (not just yet,
but I'm working on it -- it's the malt used by Caledonian Brewing Co. to 
make what's marketed in the US as McAndrew's Scotch Ale), Canada Malting...
just to name a few.


Since we're on the subject of malt, I'd like to mention that Klages is no
longer grown commercially.  It's replacement is Harrington.  After a few
years, barley tends to lose it's disease resistance and the growers switch
to a new strain.  Currently, like I said, it's Harrington.  If your retailer
is really selling you Klages, then it's very, very old.  Alas, even the
wholesalers don't really understand this too well and some still contend
that they are wholesaling Klages, so it may not be your retailer's fault,
then again, shouldn't he/she know these kinds of things?  On the bright side,
there's no doubt on the pronounciation of Harrington ;^).
