Subject: 


   (ii) Inoculation:


   a. For each jar, start by sterilizing its neck. Then sterilize ("flame") the
  inculation loop. Open a slant, quench the loop in clean agar ("sizzle")
  and use the loop to remove some yeast. Remove the airlock and then add the 
  yeast to the starter jar. Replace the airlock, and then start work on the 
  next jar.
  
  (iii) Initial Buildup:


   a. Place the starter jars in a location where 68F (18C can be held). Aerate
  twice daily by vigorously shaking jars. 1L Erlenmeyer flasks are excellent
  for this purpose because they permit vigorous swirling without getting the
  wort up by the neck and opening.
  
   b. A widely used practice is to discard any starter that is not active
  within 48 hours. Certainly if some of the starters are active within this
  period, then the inactive ones should be discarded. In any case, any starter
  not active within 72 hours should definitely be discarded even if this means
  they are all discarded.


 (iv) Second Wort Charge


  a. When the foam has receded prepare 250ml. of fresh sterile and
  aerated wort for each starter.


  b. The new wort is to be added to each starter, and this should be
  done as cleanly as possible.


  c. Before pouring the wort into the starters, it is very important
  to swab the necks of the starter jar and the wort jar with a 200
  proof alcohol solution to prevent contamination or flame them with a
  lighter.


  d. It is also desirable to reduce the temperature to a point closer
  to the temperature that will be used in production if that is
  lower than 18 C. For example, with lagers fermented at 10 C, this
  is usually taken to be 14-15 C.


  e. The starters should be aerated at the start and then again after
  12 hours. New activity should be seen before 24 hrs. Those which
  are not active within 36-48 hours should be discarded.
  
  f. Increase the volume of wort until you have sufficient volume to pitch.


(v) Pitching the Yeast
 
  a. At this time you should have a jar with about 500ml (a little more than 2
  cups) of yeast for a 5gal ale batch. I would suggest pitching before the 
  krausen (foam) totally dies down so that the yeast are still in rapid growth 
  phase. The total volume will vary with batch size, yeast type, and your
  personal experience/whim. Remember to keep yeast notes along with your beer
  notes so that you can learn from experience!


  b. Clean the outside of the jar with 200 proof alcohol or weak bleach and
  allow to dry.


  c. It is not advised that you pitch the old wort and yeast into the fermenter
  because the media has been exposed to air and oxidized, etc, etc. Therefore,
  pour off or siphon off the old media, leaving the yeast on the bottom of the
  flask. Pour this slurry into the primary or resuspend this slurry in
  sterile water and add immediately to the wort.  A short exposure to water
  will not harm the yeast, although they should not be exposed to it for long
  periods or they will lyse.


D.   Preparation of New Slants


Two steps are needed in the preparation of new slants. The first consists of
adding the proper media to test tubes or petri dishes. Once prepared the
slants will store well far a very long time when refrigerated, so many can be
prepared at one time. The second step consists of inoculating the slants with
yeast.


For the homebrewer who cannot afford several refrigerators: Please be advised
that your refrigerator is a haven for bacteria, mold, and wild yeast. Anyone
wishing to store sterile slants in their refrigerator is advised to 1. Wipe
down the slants before storage with ethanol or your favorite sanitizing
solution. 2. Seal the slants with parafilm or electrical tape. 3. Keep the
slants in a ziplock bag.4. Wipe down the bag with ethanol or your favorite
sanitizing solution before opening.


Preparation of Media:


(i) The media consists of dry malt extract and agar. As a
  general rule 4 tablespoons of malt extract and 1
  tablespoon of agar per cup of water will yield 16-18
  slants.


(ii) Bring the water to a boil, and then stir in the malt
  extract. Boil for 10 mins.


(iii) Remove from heat, and then start stirring in the agar.
  This will take some effort, but this usually indicates that
  a good solidification will ultimately be achieved. If your slants
  "sweat" too much, increase the amount of agar you use. Although
  commercial/scientific agar will vary little, I cannot answer for
  "food grade" supplies.
  Gelatin is easier to dissolve, but it sometimes does not
  always give a proper solidification.


(iv) When the agar is dissolved, the malt/agar solution should
  be added to the test tubes, filling each to approximately
  a third of their volume. Add the screw cap, but do not fully
  tighten.


(v) Autoclave the tubes at 15 psi for 5 mins.


(vi) Tighten the caps on the tubes, and place them at a
  30 degree angle. Allow them to solidify at room temperature.
  Solidification should become apparent within a few hours.
  Tubes which are not solid after 24 hrs. should be discarded.


(vii) Refrigerate until needed.


Note: Petri dishes can not be autoclaved, and so alternate procedures are
needed for them. A common practice is to autoclave the malt/ agar solution in
small jars. The agar solution is then poured into the petri dishes. Let the
agar cool until the jars are hot but touchable. If the agar is too hot it
will warp the plates. Swirl it gently to mix but avoid bubbles. It is also a
good idea to leave petri dishes prepared in this way at 25-30 C for 1-2 weeks
to make sure bacteria or molds are not present. Let the poured plates dry
overnight in a clean quiet room. Wipe them down, seal them, and bag them, but
leave them at room temperature for 1 week. The bad bugs, if they are there,
will be visually apparent at the end of that period and the contaminated
plates discarded. While Petri dishes are more trouble than test tubes, they
do offer the distinct advantage of having more surface area and being easier
to store. After the trial period the dishes should be refrigerated.




 Inoculation of Slants:


(i) Collection a small portion of the yeast to be added to the slants. 
  It goes without saying that one should strictly
  follow the standard sterilization procedures of all items
  used to collect this yeast.


  (iii) With one hand sterilize the inculation loop (flame or alcohol
  solution). With the other hand open the cap of a slant.


  (iv) Dip the loop into the yeast solution, and remove a small
  amount.


  (v) Slowly insert the loop into the tube avoiding contact with
  either the sides or neck of the tube. Streak the yeast over the
  solid. Only a thin layer is wanted, and one should try to use
  as much of the surface area as possible.


  (vi) Slowly remove the loop avoiding contact with tube walls or
  neck. Add the screw cap back on the tube and tighten.


  (vii) When finished store the tubes at 25 C for one week. Visually
  inspect all tubes at this time both for yeast growth, and
  also for any irregularities. Discard those which are not
  satisfactory.


  (viii) Store the remainder at 2-8 C. After 3-4 mos. of storage,
  unused tubes should either be discarded or recultured; i.e.,
  propagated by the procedures in Section III.2.c and then put on
  on fresh slants. The best idea is to put production yeast on
  slants on a regular basis so that reculturing is not necessary.


 Note: The larger surface area afforded by Petri dishes can be used to
 advantage in the above procedure. In particular, it useful to
 streak out yeast in parallel lines which make angles with each
 other. This allows for a better examination of growth patterns.
 Petri dishes should be sealed after the 1 week trial period with
 electrician's tape and refrigerated.

I think this is uncalled for. Many of us will agree that the AHA has not 
done a very good job of appealing to the more advanced brewers.  I think 
we should be welcoming the change in the AHA that is evident by the editor
of Zymurgy requesting technical info from us the HBD community.  It is 
quite apparent that there is some technical brewing knowledge right here
and it is a welcome change to see the powers that be asking for input 
from us, even if it is on a "light beer style" question (eeechhh).


It is also naive to believe that any publication would have the time or
resources to actually taste or verify the recipes that are given by 
people who are supposed to be knowledgeable in the subject matter.

Hi Drew,


     You are about to embark on a homebrewing experience that will leave you 
forever changed.  I brewed a black rasberry mead last season that was probably 
the best stuff (beer or mead) that I have ever made.  The recipe was patterned 
after Papazians "Purple Haze Hendrix Mead" which was posted in some past 
Zymurgy issue (I'm working without my references here).  Pap says in comments 
following this recipe that this is one of his all-time favorites and I would 
have to second that opinion.  This season my parents and girlfriend gladly 
helped to pick about 32 lbs of fresh black rasberries at the local U-pick-um 
farm with the understanding that they will all be supplied with the resulting 
nectar.  BTW it was an incredible year for rasberries here in Ohio.  My recipe 
goes something like this:


          Black Rasberry Melomel


     8-12 lbs of good quality honey (I like raw orange-blossom)
     10-15 lbs of very ripe black rasberries (picked fresh then frozen for a
           days before brewing)
     2.5 tsp pectic enzyme
     1.25 tsp good yeast energizer (I like the stuff that is primarily urea but
           also contains a bunch of B-vitamins and various amino acids)


     Optional:
          1-2 oz fresh ginger (grated or finely sliced)
          1 oz dried lemongrass


     (the reason most of the ingredients have a range of quantities is that I
      varied the recipe a bit this year)


     Procedure:
          - Bring 2 gal of good brewing water to a boil and add honey
          - Boil honey must for 10-15 min (you can skim the scum if you want
            to, but I'm not convinced it makes a difference)
          - Add rasberries, ginger, and lemongrass, stir and turn off heat
          - Cover and let steep (read pasteurize) 20 min
          - Cool, dilute to 5 gal and add pectic enzyme and yeast nutrient
          - Aereate VERY well and pitch your favorite mead yeast ->If you dont
            have a favorite, I can recomend "Lalvin S. Cerevisiae (an eppernay
            type) as an excellent choice.
          - Wait patiently


Notes:
     1. I use two stage fermentation with the racking of the mead coming when 
        the CO2 is down to about 1 bubble every 15-30s (usually about 1 wk.)


     2. I have used the Lalvin yeast on my last six or so batches of mead and
        I am very pleased with the speed with wich it starts and finishes.  It
        also flocculates well and besides all that it leaves a nice clean
        slightly sweet finish.  I have been ready to bottle after only about a
        month of fermentation (counting both stages) since I started using this
        yeast.  BTW I think the yeast energizer is critical to this as well.


     3. The above recipe is pretty general.  I used essentially the same
        program to make both strawberry and mullberry melomels as well this
        summer.




Let me know if you have other questions.


Good Brewing,

>         Does anyone have a good recipe for Blackberry Mead?


Not a specific recipe, but based on the variations I've done:  Use around 2
lb fruit per gallon to get a strong fruit character.  Use around 2 lb honey
per gallon.  (I normally use a full gallon of honey--which is a bit under
12 lb--in a 5 gallon batch.)  You can use a fairly strong honey with
berries like this.


That's it--berries, honey, water, and a suitable yeast.  My current
favorite yeast for melomels is "Prise de Mousse".


Crush the berries; you don't actually need to extract the juice.  Use a
plastic-pail primary fermenter.  Assuming you get a good fast start to
fermentation, I'd skim out all the berry-crud and rack it after about a
week.  That should be enough to ferment out most of the berry sugar.  If
you leave the berries in much longer, you'll get too much astringent
character.


You might consider a mixture of berries--say blackberry+raspberry.  Depen-
ding on the type of blackberries and what the growing season was like,
blackberries can be rather bland.  (This surprised me.)


Frozen fruit works just fine; in fact the freezing helps break up the
berries and release the juice.  However, given your location and the
season, I'm guessing you have plenty of fresh fruit.

 I'm not sure if I have a 'good' recipe or not - I think I bottled
 some mead with blackberries (i know I did some with raspberries,
 strawberries, and (i think cherries)). I'll check when I get home

Hi all.
I tried to post my yeast FAQ to the HBD today, and one of my messages was 
rejected, and the bounced back message was all garbled! I apologize in 
advance if any of the other submissions of mine are messed-up or out of

will wait until tomorrow and see what came through.
Sorry!

Subject: Yeast FAQ part 2 of 7 (read this after intro then continue in seq.)


SECTION I: Yeast Characteristics


   Yeast are unicellular fungi. All brewing yeast belong to the genus
   Saccharomyces.  Ale yeast are S. cerevisiae, and lager yeast are S. uvarum
   (formerly carlsbergerensis).  Weizen yeasts are usually 50/50 mixtures of
   cerevesiae and "delbrueckii" (delbrueckii may or may not be an accepted
   toxonomic class, however its use as a label appears widespread, and it is
   used herein for simplicity). You may ask,"If all these yeast are the same
   species, why all the fuss?" The fuss has to do with strain variation. Just
   as all dogs are the same species, yet no one will ever mistake a basset
   hound for a doberman (at least not twice :-). Using different strains can add
   fun and spice to brewing, especially if you have an idea of the differences.
   I originally put together this guide to catalogue the different affects of
   different strains.  This information is in Section II.


   Some yeast strains are more active and vigorous than others.  Lager strains
   in particular do not show as much activity on the surface as many of the
   ale strains.  Most packages provide an adequate quantity of yeast to complete
   fermentation with varying amounts of lag time depending on strain, freshness,
   handling, and temperature.  If you find it too slow, make a starter as
   recommended on the package or as listed in Section III.  In any event, a
   closed fermenter with an airlock is recommended.


Temperature


   The slow onset of visible signs of fermentation can be improved by starting
   fermentation at 75 deg. F (24 deg. C) until activity is evident, then
   moving to your desired fermentation temperature.  A few degrees does make
   a significant difference without adversely affecting flavor.


   The normal temperatures for ale yeast range from 60-75 deg. F (16-24 deg. C)
   A few strains ferment well down to 55 deg. F (13 deg. C). 68 deg. F (20
   deg. C) is a good average. Lager strains normally ferment from 32-75 deg.
   F (0-24 deg. C). 50-55 deg. F (10-12 deg. C) is customary for primary
   fermentation. A slow steady reduction to the desired temperature for
   secondary fermentation typically works well.


   The fermentation rate is directly related to temperature.  The lower the
   temperature, the slower fermentation commences.  Fluctuations in tempera-
   ture such as cooling and warming from night to day can adversely affect
   yeast performance.


Attenuation


   Attenuation refers to the percentage of sugar converted to alcohol.  Apparent
   attenuation of yeast normally ranges from 67-77%.  The attenuation
   is determined by the composition of the wort or juice and the yeast strain
   used.  Each yeast strain ferments different sugars to varying degrees,
   resulting in higher or lower final gravities.  This will affect the resid-
   ual sweetness and body.


   Really, it's slightly more complex than that (isn't everything ?-).There's
   "apparent attenuation" and "real attenuation".  The difference comes about
   because alcohol has a specific gravity less than 1 (about .8).  Real
   attenuation is the percent of sugars converted to alcohol.  So, if you had a
   10% (by weight) sugar solution (about 1.040), and got 100% real attenuation,
   the resulting specific gravity would be about 0.991 (corresponding to about
   5% alcohol by weight).  The apparent attenuation of this brew would be 122%!
   George Fix published a set of equations relating apparent and real
   attenuation and alcohol content last year.  To wit:
   A = alcohol content of finished beer in % by wt.
  RE = real extract of finished beer in deg. Plato
   Since A and RE are generally not known to us, additional approximations are
   needed. The following are due to Balling, and have proven to be  reasonable.
   Let OE and be defined as follows:
   OE = original extract (measured deg. Plato of wort)
   AE = apparent extract (measured deg. Plato of finished beer).
   Then,
   RE = 0.1808*OE + 0.8192*AE, and
    A = (OE-RE)/(2.0665-.010665*OE).


   The "tricky part" here is the expression of the sugar content in degrees
   Plato.  This is a fancy term for % sugar by weight, and corresponds *roughly*
   to "degrees gravity" divided by 4.  That is, a 1.040 wort has an extract of
   10 degrees Plato. He goes on to calculate an example: To take a specific
   case, first note that from Plato tables an OG of 1.045 is equivalent to OE =
   11.25 deg. Plato,  while a FG of 1.010 is equivalent to AE = 2.5 deg. Plato.
   Therefore, RE =0.1808*11.25 + 0.8192*2.5 = 4.08 deg. Plato, and A = (11.25 -
   4.08)/(2.0665 - .010665*11.25) = 3.68 % wt. The apparent attenuation is 75%
   (from 1.040 to 1.010), the real attenuation is (11.25 - 4.08)/11.25 = 64%.
   N.B. Most attenuation figures are given in terms of *apparent* attenuation.
   (Thanks to Chris Pencis quoting Stuart Thomas quoting George Fix).


Flocculation


   Flocculation refers to the tendency of yeast to clump together and settle
   out of suspension.  The degree and type of flocculation varies for different
   yeast. Some strains clump into very large flocculate.  Some flocculate very
   little giving a more granular consistency.  Most yeast strains clump and
   flocculate to a moderate degree.


pH Ranges


   Typical pH range for yeast fermentations begins at about 5.1 and optimally
   4.8.  During the course of fermentation the pH reduces to typically 3.9-
   4.1 and as low as 3.1 in some wines.


Alcohol Tolerances


   The alcohol tolerance for most brewing yeast is as least to 8%.  Barley
   wines to 12% can be produced by most ale strains.  Pitching rates need to
   be increased proportionally to higher gravities.  Alternately, Champagne
   and Wine yeast can be used for high gravities sometimes reaching alcohols
   to 18%.


Smells and Tastes


   Although the principle tastes present in a beer are the result of the malts
and hops used, the strain of yeast used can also add important flavors, good
and/or bad.  Yeast that add little in the way of extra flavors are usually
described as having a "clean" taste.  These yeast are especially useful for
beginners because they permit experimentation with different ingredients
without worrying about yeast influence.  Yeast produce three main classes of
metabolic by-products that affect beer taste: phenols, esters, and diacetyl.
Phenols can give a "spicy" or "clove-like" taste.  Esters can lend a "fruity"
taste to beer.  Diacetyls can give beer a "butterscotch" or sometimes a
"woody" taste.  The desirability of any one of these components depends
largely on the style of beer being brewed.  In addition, there are certain
by-products in these families that are more noxious than the others.  A lot
depends on the individual palette and the effect youUre aiming for.
   A final note: some yeast, especially lager yeast during lagering, can produce
a "rotten egg" smell.  This is the result of hydrogen sulfite production.
Although the scent of this bubbling out of the air-lock is enough to make the
strongest homebrewmeister blanch, fear not! The good news is that this will
usually pass, leaving the beer unaffected.  Relax, etc.

My original guess that their 2-row was Briess was based on the stacks of
Briess Malt sacks glimpsed through the brewery's window.  A phone call
to Thomas Price clarified the matter.  Redhook gets their wheat malt
from Briess and as Jeff correctly surmissed they get virtually everything
else from Great Western.

Subject: Grolsch bottles & Carbonation




I also use Grolsch bottles (using usual anal sanitation precautions),
and have had no problems with any of my batches.


However, concerning carbonation, I did notice that the few beers that
I put into the fridge, for a little over a weeks time, experienced less
carbonation than the ones I stored in my basement.
The gaskets are relatively new (as the bottles are not even 5 months old).


I was thing that the colder fridge temperatures may have caused the
gaskets to contract enough to make an imperfect seal letting gas escape
from the beer (to outside the bottle), thusly reducing the beer's
carbonation (factor).

Subject: Hard, high pH water treatment for new masher


I've started mashing and I think I might have a problem: my water supply
has a high pH (8.0-8.2) and is quite hard (250 ppm).  Its perfect for the
fish I keep (rift valley cichlids), but I'm not sure what to do with it for
brewing.  Before I started mashing I never concerned myself with it, but
now I'm mashing and wanting to make pale ales and pilsners instead of
stouts and Munich dunkels, so it is now a concern.  I've got a call into
the lab to get the water analysis details, but I won't have them until
Monday.


I've also got access to lower pH, softer (but still not soft) water here at
the office.  I'll get the details of it on Monday too.


I've read Miller on water treatment, and it just left me more confused than
ever.  Why can't he just say: "Do this if you have this water, do that if
you have some other water"?


What I want is a recipe or flow chart (or hand holding) on what to do with
my mash and sparge water.  Can anyone help me? Or at least put Miller's
explanation in terms I might understand.

Just a data point.


I have always used the brown and green swing top/Grolsch bottles.  Being
a procrastinating lazy sort here's the easiest way I've found to clean
them with out a single mishap to date. 


Rinse the bottles after emptying
and stick em in the dish washer with the dinner stuff.  Save these bottles
(usually only 5 or 6) until you have enough to bottle the next batch.  
When your ready to bottle the next batch wash all the bottles again and toss
1 or 2 ounces of bleach into the washer.  The washer will recycle the bleach
water solution a few times before beginning the rinse cylcle.
Bottle when washer stops and every thing is dry.
I usually don't use any soap on the second washing.  Scoff
all you want but I've done my last 7 or 8 batches this way with no worries
or infections.  Initially I was concerned about the bleach deteriorating
my washers seals so I now dilute the 1 or 2 ounces of bleach in a gallon of
water and dump the whole mess in the washer.  So far everything is O'tay.
I also have noted that the green bottles are superior
in quality to the brown.

Nope, you've not gone off the deep end.  I've used this technique (based on
2nd hand information which was supposed to have come from the now retired,
former senior biochemist for John Courage) on my Barley Wine, and it tastes
fantastic! Before pitching the ale yeast, I put 1L of wort in a sanitized
mason jar into the fridge.  About 3 days into the primary fermetation, I
removed the wort from the fridge in the morning to warm up.  That evening I
mixed it with 1L of boiled and cooled water (to get the gravity down to
something more reasonable for a "starter") and pitched some champagne
yeast.  When that was well started I added it to the fermenting barley
wine.


For a beer like this where you want to get the typical ale flavor (esthers)
as well as the higher alcohol content, I highly recommend the technique.

Subject: Shipping live yeast




I bought a "Yeast Culture Kit"  from _*deleted*_ when I was at
the AHA Conference in Portland.  I had been thinking of buying one for
some time, and their "special show price" of $29.90 seemed great.


"Save $10 since the regular price is $34.95 and you save the $5 shipping."


I was told the slants would be inoculated on Monday after they got back
to California.  They would check for viability, and send them out by UPS.
(Conference was July 27 - July 29)


I called _*deleted*_ Thursday, August 12 to check on the yeast.  I
was told it was shipped out Monday, August 9, by surface, which I assumed
was by UPS.


The yeast arrived Friday in a plain manila envelope in the US Mail.  My mail
box is a standard flat-black metal rural box that spends 75% of its time in
direct sunlight.  Today is fairly cool (90F) and mostly cloudy.  The temperature
inside the box was around 105F.  I guess I am lucky in that: 1) I was
home, 2) I checked the mail early, and 3) today has mostly overcast skies.


To quote their catalog: "IMPORTANT NOTE:  Due to the delicate nature of live
yeast and the temperature extremes in many parts of our country, we STRONGLY
recommend 2nd Day Air delivery of your yeast culturing kits. (2nd-Day Air
delivery is the only way we can guarantee your live yeast cultures to be
viable upon reciept)."   They charge $6.00 for this BTW.


I was disappointed.  I know they saved money shipping it by US Mail ($0.52
stamp), but why put the "IMPORTANT NOTE" in their catalog if it does not
matter?  I know the owner will make good on the yeast if it turns out to
be fried, but that is not the point.  I had delayed brewing because I didn't
have any more yeast and I wasn't going to get more Wyeast since I had this
yeast on order. (I drive 80 miles, each way, to Charlotte, NC to buy yeast,
so I usually stockpile.)  If the yeast turns out bad, then it would be
another two weeks before I could expect a replacement.


I guess I am asking the yeast experts out there what they think about the
above conditions in the handling of yeast.  What is affected by high
temperatures of yeast on a slant, other than possibly lower viability?
Can elevated storage temperature cause undesired fermentation characteristics?


I am NOT knocking the shop owner or _*deleted*_, but I am questioning their
choice of shipping.  I have heard nothing but praise about their operation. 
The kit I bought is supposed to be the best on the market.  The yeast I
received may be in perfect condition.  I am simply asking for information
regarding yeast handling, since I am certainly not an expert on this subject.
Thanks.

PS.  Since I have not tested or used the yeast in question, I feel that it
     would be unfair to name the shop.

Subject: RE: fermenting a lager




Patrick asks in HBD 1203 about *fermenting* a lager by placing the carboy in a 
referigerator without using an AirStat(tm) or other thermostat.  His concern 
was temperature fluctuations.


The problem isn't so much with temperature fluctuations as with the mean 
temperature, Patrick.  To ferment, you're looking for temperatures in the 
45 - 55 F range.  This is too warm for most regerigerators.  They're expecting 
to keep things in the 32 - 40F range.  Note that this is ideal for lagering, 
but not for the fermentation.  In fact, I have an AirStat(tm) and the main 
problem I have with it is that it only goes down to 40F.  Why?  Well, who sets 
their air conditioner below 40 degrees?  So, I use the AirStat(tm) to control 
in the fermentation and serving range, and just use the built-in regerigerator 
thermostat when lagering.  There's a guy in our local brew club who uses a 
thermostat he got from Granger -- it controls over the whole range we want, 
and costs about the same as the AirStat(tm).  You don't get the fancy LCD 
display though.  If you have a Granger catalog, you might check it out.


Hope this helps...

Subject: Missing Head


I have made some decent all grain beer lately but have noticed a significant
difference in the way they hold a head.  I have been very careful to pour
the beers in the same type cleansed glassware so the only variable I can
turn to is the grains.  What makes this unique I believe is that the beers
which do not hold a head are Wheat beers.  My pale ales keep a head for a
good 5 minutes while my wheat beers lose their head within 2 minutes.  Two
comparable grain brews were;
                 Wheat           Pale
 Brit Pale         0               8lbs

 Wheat             3.5lbs          .5lb
 Crystal           .5lb            .5lb
 
Is there something I don't understand here?  I always thought wheat beers
would have longer lasting heads and that is why you add a little wheat to
most recipes.
