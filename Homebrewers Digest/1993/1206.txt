              WORT AERATION PRIOR TO PITCHING
 
                      Jack Schmidling
                        Aug 14, 1993
 
 There has been a great deal of enthusiastic reporting on the 
 use of aquarium air pumps to aerate wort prior to pitching 
 yeast and many rather preposterous claims of shortened time 
 to the onset of fermentation resulting from the use of same.  
 As the author's experience on one batch did not support any 
 such claims, a controlled experiment was designed to 
 determine the validity of said claims.
 
 The experiment described herein compares the air pump 
 aerator with several other less exotic methods along with an 
 un-aerated control batch.
 
 The wort used was withheld from a batch of Pilsner style 
 beer with a gravity of 1.050.  It was re-boiled several days 
 after the original batch was pitched so that it could be 
 pitched with controlled amounts of kraeusen from the new 
 batch.  The re-boiling was to re-established an anaerobic 
 environment along with re-sterilizing the wort.
 
 Prior to pitching, the wort was divided into (4) 500 ml 
 samples in sterile, one quart mason jars and aerated in 
 various ways as follows:
 
 #1   Control... No aeration.  Just gently poured from kettle
      into jar.
 
 #2   Siphon Simulation...  Poured into jar from a height of 
      12 inches in a narrow stream to simulate what one would
      get simply by siphoning and letting the stream fall
      into a fermenter.
 
 #3   Pumped from kettle through nozzle to "squirt" into jar.
      This is the system normally used by the author to
      transfer from kettle to fermenter.
 
 #4   Aerated with aquarium pump and fine mist airstone.   
      Pump was run until foam volume equaled wort volume then
      shut off till the foam collapsed.  This was repeated 5
      times for a total on-time of (2) minutes.  The time was
      based on a very conservative scale down from Miller's
      suggested time of 15 minutes for a 5 gallon batch.  It
      represents about 5 times the amount of air per unit
      wort volume recommended by Miller. (*1)
 
 The wort was cooled to a temperature of 70F before being 
 aerated.  All four samples were pitched with 50 ml of 
 working kraeusen.  This active wort was taken as a single 
 sample and thoroughly mixed prior to dividing into 4 
 individual portions to assure a homogeneous and identical 
 yeast in each test.   
 
 The yeast used was Pilsener Urquel recultured from a slant 
 obtained from Paul Farnsworth.  (*2)
 
 After pitching, the four test batches were placed in a 
 refrigerator at 40F and checked every four hours for signs 
 of incipient fermentation.
 
 RESULTS............
 
 No sign of fermentation was detected until the 72 hr check.
 At this time, a small island of bubbles was just visible in 
 the center of all four samples.
 
 To accelerate the conclusion of the experiment, the samples 
 were removed from the refrigerator and allowed to rise to 
 room temperature (75 F).  They were monitored until the 
 entire surface of the fermenters were covered with foam.  
 This occurred about 9 hours later on all four samples.
 
 ...............
 
                      ALE YEAST
 
 To take the experiment one step further, a similar but 
 abbreviated experiment was conducted with ale yeast.
 
 Two 500 ml samples of a similar wort were treated as 
 follows:
 
    #5   Control...  No aeration
 
    #6   Shook jar vigorously until foam volume equaled wort
         volume.  This was allowed to settle and repeated 
         (5) times.
 
 Both samples were pitched with 0.4 grams of granulated EDME 
 ale yeast, poured directly on top of the wort.
 
 They were maintained at a temperature 75 F and monitored 
 regularly until the onset of fermentation.  This occurred at 
 4.5 hrs in both samples.  The tops of both fermenters were 
 covered with foam at 10 hrs total elapsed time.
 
 CONCLUSION...
 
 The experiment seems to confirm the author's previous 
 experience and points to the conclusion that the method of 
 aeration used has no correlation with or effect on the time 
 to onset of fermentation.  Contrary to frequently stated 
 anecdotal experience, the un-aerated control samples started 
 fermenting as soon and with the same vigor as the variously 
 aerated samples.  This was true both in the case of cold 
 temperature lager yeast and room temperature ale yeast.
 
 This experiment was not intended to test any other aspects 
 of the brewing process that may be affected by wort 
 aeration.  Much has been written on the subject and the 
 present author's intent was only to study the effects of 
 aeration on the onset of fermentation.

Subject: Lager yeast at warm Temp.










  
    I am preparing to brew up a pilsner from Charlie P's book.  I have 
  purchased Wyeast American Lager yeast.  
    
    I realize that that I will not obtain a true pilsener without a lagering 
  operation, but at this time, I don't have the means to keep the fermentation
  cool. (I hadhoped I would by now).  
    
    So the big question is:  Should I go ahead a brew this batch at a warm 
temp. (70+) with the lager yeast?  More specifically, will I get a complete 
fermentation from lager yeast at the warm temp?  
    
    Charlie P. says that the lager yeast will do okay at room temp, but I 
  wanted to see if anyone had any bad (or good) experiences with this 
type of situtation.  (Or, if anyone had any suggestions)
    
    You can e-mail me to save bandwith.
    
    Thanks for the input,
    Alex

Subject: Re: Recipe formulation


John Montgomery asks about formulating his own recipes.  He says he has 10 or
11 all grainers behind him and wants to strike out creating his own recipes.


This brings up an interesting point to me.  I wonder how many people with this
much experience have done this little experimenting.  I have brewed a total of
16 batches, the last 5 or 6 being all-grainers.  I have been trying new things
with recipes since the second batch.  Now, maybe I'm taking more creative
credit than I'm due, because I usually start with a recipe. I then adjust it
for my setup, ingredients on hand, ingredients available at the local HB shop,
my whims, etc.  Doing this, I've only really screwed up one batch due to poor
recipe formulation, and I used it for boiling brats, etc. so it wasn't a total
loss.


The biggest variability I found was with hops.  Once I found Rager's formulas
in the Zymurgy hops special addition, this went away.  Of course, yeast is a
big contributor, but with some common sense, you probably can't pick a yeast
that will ruin a brew.  The grain affects final flavor in a big way too, but
again, you won't ruin a batch by picking an American 2-row rather than a
Belgian 2-row.  It will be different, and you may prefer one over the other (I
bet I know which one!) but it won't be bad.


With John's experience, he should be experimenting a lot, IMHO.  Maybe I screw
around too much but then I'm not out to win contests.  I'm only out to brew
a beer I really like.  For me that means variety, and variety means
experimentation, which is a major reason I homebrew.  I guess I've rambled
enough about this.  Comments?

Subject: Yeast FAQ corrections


First off, 3 cheers to Patrick for the effort in compiling all
that yeast information!


I have a few additions and corrections, however:


> Lallemand Nottingham Yeast
>  This yeast is remarkable for its high degree of
>  flocculation.  It settles out very quickly and firmly.
>  Very good reputation.  Very fast to create a krausen and

>

According to two fellow Brewers of South Suburbia, Dick and Steve,
the Windsor is more powdery (doesn't flocculate as well) as the
Nottingham and thus tends to be more attenuative.


>
> Munton-Fison Ale Yeast
>  Starts quick.  Produces some fruity esters. Attenuative.
>  Phenolic taste.  Fair to good reputation.


I believe I was the one who reported the intense phenolic nose
and flavor with M&F "Muntona" yeast.  It appears, however, that
they have gone to a new strain and a recent batch I made had
none of the phenolics I reported earlier.  I've read that improper
rehydration (rehydration in wort rather than water) can lead to
off flavors, so maybe that was the problem I had with the Muntona
yeast.




>WYeast


First off, it's Wyeast and it's sort of a pun, since Wyeast is the
Native American name for Mt. Hood which is not far from Wyeast Labs.


Also, a frequently asked question is "how do you pronounce Wyeast?"
Well, it's pronounced like "WHY-yeast."

I did not get a green-apple note when I used this yeast.
Perhaps it was just tasted young and it was actually
acetaldahyde which is often found in young beers but
later fades unless the beer is filtered (like Budweiser).

This is one of my two favorites (1056 being the other) and I've
brewed some very high IBU ales with it without the overhopping
problems reported here.  Just 40 datapoints or so.  Also, I'd
like to mention that this yeast was used for the 1992 B.0.S.S.
Challenge 1st place Barleywine, brewed by none other than Brian
and Linda North.

It is worth mentioning that this yeast strain is reportedly
used quite a bit in St. Louis, if you know what I mean ;^).

This yeast allegedly is the one used by August Schell in
new Ulm, MN.

Allegedly, one of the four (?) Pilsner Urquell yeasts.

I'd like to mention that I got an intense off aroma (like home
perm solution) with this yeast fermented at 45-50F, but it
miraculously disappeared after four months aging in the bottle
at 40F.

No, no, no.  Lactic sourness is the requisite characteristic
of a *Berliner* weiss, not a Bavarian weizen -- Bavarian weizens
are characterized by clove-like aromas/flavors and often some mild
banana esters.  What the original poster probably meant was:
"Problematic to get the right flavor, often just produces relatively
unattenuated beer, without the clove-like aroma/flavor."  I have
been thinking that perhaps it's the freshness of the Wyeast #3056
that makes the difference in whether you get the clove-like aroma/flavor
or not.  Any other data points?


> Red Star Pasteur Champagne Yeast
>  Very attenuative.  Good for mead.  Good reputation.


Popular yeast for Imperial Stouts and Barleywines due to it's high
tolerance for alcohol.  Some use it by itself, others pitch Pasteur
after their chosen beer yeast poops out.


>Part 1: Hydration Procedure For Dry Yeast
>
>a. Use 14 grams of dry yeast (usually 2 packets) per 5 gallons of brew.

>b. Add the dry yeast to 1/2 cup of water at 90F (32C). Leave for 15 mins.


According to the Lallemand newsletter, the proper temperature for rehydration
is 104F to 110F.  Also, you may want to mention that this should be boiled
and cooled water, so chlorine is boiled off and so the water is sanitized.
You would be surprised at how literally some people take directions!

I think the most important reason is to avoid aerating the hot wort.  It
would be okay to instead *gently* pour or (even better) siphon the hot wort
into the cold water.  Once the temperature of the wort has dropped to below
80F (that's the commonly agreed upon temperature) you should then aerate
the heck out of the wort, but not while it's still hot.  Before I built
a wort chiller, I used to gently lower blocks of boiled-then-frozen water
into the kettle and then topped up the fermenter with boiled-cooled water.
I noticed a BIG difference in the flavor and stability of my beer.  I think
you will too.

1) Cut off each end of the garden hose, leaving about 8" attached to
   each "hose end" 


2) Insert the 6 pieces of copper pipe into the 6 ends of the 2 copper
   tees, and solder in place.


3) Drill a 1/8" hole in the end of each copper end cap.


4) Enlarge these holes to 3/8"


5) attach one end cap to each enlarged "T" so that you can look
   through the "T" and see light through the 3/8" hole in the end cap.


6) straighten the 50' of copper tubing, and feed through the garden hose.


7) slip a hose clamp over each end of the garden hose.


8) slip the copper "T" assembly over the end of the copper tubing, and
   into the garden hose. Attach with clamp.


9)  Solder the copper tubing to the "T" assembly where it passes
    through the hole in the end cap.


10) Using the 2 remaining hose clamps, attach the hose end remnants to
    the "other" end of the "T" assembly.

the "in" end, I attached a 3/8" od copper racking cane.  I hose
clamped a copper Chore Boy scrubber to the end of the racking cane, to
filter out hop particles.


  To sanitize, I siphon iodophor solution through the chiller into the
carboy. To start the siphon, put a female garden hose to 3/8" hose
barb fitting on the "out" end and attach it to a water source, Place
the "racking cane" into a bucket filled with sanitizer. Then run the
water until all the air is removed from the system, disconnect the
water source, and place the "out end" lower than the "in end" immersed
in sanitizer.  I use this same method to start the siphon from the hot
wort (remember not to blow bubbles into the hot wort though).


  This design works very well.  I was able to drop boiling wort to
within 5 degrees F of the tap water temperature.  I found three
drawbacks: 1) The flow is very slow. It took about 20 minutes to
siphon 5 gallons through the system. 2) a fair amount of wort is left
in the tubing then the siphon quits. 3) a fair amount of wort is left
amongst the hops in the bottom of the brew kettle.  I have a small
food grade pump which I may attach to the outflow of the chiller next
time I use it, which should solve #1 & #2 and help #3.


  I may also add another, bare copper coil between the outflow of the
CF chiller and the carboy.  This coil will be immersed in a small ice
bucket.  This will minimize the amount of ice needed, and get that
final, desireable drop in temperature.

What special considerations are there for welding stainless steel for
brewing equipment?  I've heard that Cadmium rod should be avoided since
it could leach into the hot wort.  Are there other things to consider?  


I've heard that you can arc weld stainless.  While heli-arc gives a cleaner 
result, are there other reasons not to use a simple arc welder?

Subject: re-priming results


As promised, here are the results from my attempt to recarbonate a partial 
batch of ale.  This is a follow up to last week's response to Robert Pulliam's
question about rebottling beer that has altready been kegged.  I can now 
comment on the results.


First, some history of the batch.  It was brewed from a Boot's "mild"
kit combined with 4lbs of unhopped amber extract.  The following dates
refer to time relative to the initial priming/kegging/bottling :


day 0 - batch is combined with 1/2 cup corn sugar and mixed in a 5 gallon
        cornelius keg.  2.5 gallons are then siphoned off into bottles.


day 2 - After noticing that the keg does not build up any pressure, I
        finally figure out an error that I made in reassembly.  The error
        is corrected, but I am even more suspicious of the viability of 
        the kegged beer.  1/3 cup of corn sugar in boiling water is added
        to re-prime the beer.  About 1 gallon is siphoned off into
        bottles, leaving about 1.5 gallons in the 5 gallon keg.  The 
        relief valve at the top of the keg is left open overnight to 
        allow air to be replaced with CO2.


day 12  The kegged beer is sampled.  The keg starts with about 20psi
        and is relieved to about 5psi for dispensing.  It is iced
        down from the cellar temperature of 70F to 50F.  It tastes fine.


day 15  The kegged beer is iced down and sampled again.  Now it has 
        developed a harsh unpleasant bitter taste.  Making the assumption
        that the lowered pressure has somehow activated a "bad" mode
        of yeast growth, I repressurize to 20psi.


day 16  The taste test.  (see below)


The taste test involved comparing the three different sub-batches.  Batch
A is the originally bottled beer from day 0.  Batch B is the beer rebottled
on day 2.  Batch C is what remained in the keg.  Here's the comments from
the tasters :


Batch        Taster 1                        Taster 2
- -----        -------------------------------        ---------------------------------
A        Tastes good.  mature                Tastes fine, full bodied


B        Good, but a little  "green"        Like batch A except much more
                                        carbonation and a little thinner.


C        Like batch B, but flat                too bitter, a bit flat
        
So, one conclusion is that the re-priming technique seems to work well
at the expense of losing some of the body.  If it were re-primed with
DME, perhaps the body could be preserved.  In retrospect, 1/3 cup of 
corn sugar was too much for the repriming.


However, I am somewhat baffled about why the beer turned harshly
bitter between days 12 and 15.  This is the second time a kegged
batch turned out with this bitter taste.  The first keg started out
bitter even when filled to 5 gallons.  It did however, have a long
ride in the back of a car soon before tapping.


These bitter kegged beers are somewhat disappointing.  So far, I have
yet to get a good batch of beer from a keg.  My bottled beers do not
exhibit this problem.  Does anyone have any guesses as to why my kegged
batches are turning bitter ?  Surely 100s of homebrewers using cornelius
kegs can't be wrong.


Until I can figure out what is going wrong, Mr. Cornelius Keg is on
probation.

DO NOT DRINK Hydrogen Peroxide!  Gee whiz - look at your logic:  hydrogen
and oxygen aren't poisonous, you say.  Sodium and chlorine ARE, yet table
salt, sodium chloride, is an essential nutrient.  Besides, even granting
your (incorrect) logic, oxygen IS poisonous.  Oxygen damages your body. 
Vitamin C is supposed to do its job by being an anti-oxidant - any
connections?  Your body does a great deal of work trying to keep oxygen,
which, yes, is essential, from damaging you beyond repair.  Honest-  I did
a thesis on a related matter.  
The super-oxidation of solutions you refer to IS the chemical reaction you
are looking for - it breaks down proteins, lipids (fats), cell walls, etc.
 That's how it kills bacteria as an antiseptic
Data point:  Viruses don't respire aerobically or otherwise.  An anaerobic
virus is a meaningless term.
Data point:  Warts come and go, often spontaneously.  
In beer, hydrogen peroxide will kill your yeast.  Remember, it's supposed
to stop infections?
Data point:  There is a POISON label on that bottle oof peroxide.  Why
might it be there?  


        Mr. Childers, I am sorry to be so vehement, but I fear you are
doing yourself harm.  Stop drinking hydrogen peroxide, and do deep
breathing exercises, if you want more oxygen.  Call the researchers you
refer to, and ask them about this, if you must.  But do the reseearch
before the experimentation with your health and life - please.

Until recently, I mashed using a Bruheat boiler (a brewing
bucket fitted with thermostat and element), but I became
dissatisfied with the poor control of temperature, hot spots
near the element etc. I've now bought an insulated mash tun
(actually a picnic chest with tap and slotted pipe sparge
manifold). 


This is probably an FAQ, but can someone tell me the
specific heat capacity of crushed malt, so that I can 
heat my strike liquor to the right temperature (65C)? Dave Line's
books don't seem to take the mass of grains into account when 
calculating strike temperature. Alternatively, could you tell me
waht mass of grains you use and at what temperature, the volume of 
water and strike temperature, and the final mash temperature, so 
that I can work it out for myself.


Thanks

A couple of questions for you.  Thanks in advance for your help!


1.  Fruit Beer - I have a large amount of fresh-picked wild blackberries that 
I'd like to preserve for later addition to beer.  What's the best way?  Are 
they best frozen, or first made into syrup and canned?  If canned, can I safely 
omit sugar, or is that needed for prevention of spoilage?


2.  Fruit Beer - OK, so I've got the berries... now what?  How much fruit is 
added to what kind of "base" beer?  Any recipes?


3.  Beer belly - Are there reliable ways of measuring caloric content of 
homebrew?  This is of some concern to my wife, who sees my once svelte >; -) 
abdomen tending toward flab.

A friend of mine just returned home from Canada and he told me of a
new slogan being used by the Canadian breweries.  He said they were
now selling "Ice Brewed" beers!  I asked him if he didn't mean
"Cold Filtered" and he assured me that it wasn't cold filtered or
ice filtered but "Ice Brewed".  He told me he like Labatt's the best,
but also like Molson's, Carling Black Label, and others.


Is this something new in brewing like "Dry Beer" was or are we talking
about the old process of Lagering?


Also - Like JS, I have used an aquarium pump to try to aerate my new
batches of ale.  For me it just never did as well as my old reliable 18 inch 
stainless steel 3/8 inch tube with the 4 1/16 inch holes drilled 2
inches from the top.  With my SS Keg/Boiler sitting at approx 3 feet
of the ground, approx 2 feet of 3/8" ID vinyl tubing connecting the
spigot of the boiler to the SS tubing, when I open the spigot and
start pouring 65-70 degree wort into my primary, the air rushing
through the holes in the SS tubing COMPLETELY aerates the wort.  When
finished there is a good 12 inches of foam protruding out of the
fermenter.

Subject: water, beer in BC, homebrew data


I enthusiastically second the kind of info Bill Flowers called
for regarding water alterations.  I have never fooled with my
water, but it would be nice to see some more straightforward
talk and less scientific language (which is difficult for me,
a non-science type to understand).


Beer in BC.  There are several microbreweries in BC. Don't be fooled
by the name however, my experience (limited) with Seattle micros
suggests that BC micros are smaller versions of the big brewers.
Sure, Okanagan Spring, Whistler Breweries make good beer, but
they do not have a diverse range of product, tending to stick with
what sells in our relatively small canadian market. Don't even
bother with Granville Island beers, they aren't worth it. If you've
tried Canadian you've had these supposed micro beers. (actually,
it's not that bad, but the general drift ofmeaning is there).


I do recommend Horseshoe Bay breweries. But Best for Last, go to
Spinnakers Brewpub in Victoria. It is close to downtown, just the
other side of the blue lift bridge, and they have wonderful brew,
and a wonderful variety.  Swann's Brewpub is also a good choice
in Victoria.  I tend to favour Spinnakers, but that's personal choice
for you.


Finally, I would be most interested in any collected database of
homebrew oriented information.  If this collection does get made,
are there any plans to share/post/distribute it? I would enjoy a copy.

Subject: FWD: It was foamy with a mature flavor ...


        LONDON (UPI) -- Divers exploring the wreck of a Royal Navy ship that
sank near the Isle of Skye off Scotland during World War II have
recovered a small treasure -- 48 bottles of beer, unopened and unspoiled
after 50 years on the sea bed, officials at the Whitbread brewery said
Tuesday.
        The divers, members of the Hartlepool Diving Club, were exploring
Royal Navy mine-layer HMS Port Napier when they discovered the cache of
Whitbread beer in the ship's galley. When they brought the bottles to
the surface, they sampled the brew and found it still drinkable.
        ``It was foamy with a mature flavor and you could still taste the
beer,'' said Tony Brumwell, one of the divers.
        The divers handed over some of the beer to Whitbread's Castle Eden
brewery for testing.
        ``Beer is not meant to last a long time but our brewers are
interested in analyzing it to test its condition and alcoholic content,''
said Whitbread Regional Director Jim Kerr.
        A fire broke out on the HMS Port Napier in 1942 as it started out on
a mine-laying mission. It sank in 80 feet of water. The navy later
salvaged the mines from the vessel but the ship remains on the sea bed
and is a favorite for exploration by divers.

Subject: RE:Grolsch Bottles and Carbonation


Philip J. Difalco suggests that contracting gaskets from the cold of
his refrigerator may lead to reduced carbonation in his beer.


I disagree.


Assuming that the conditioning is finished, the "problem" is more likely
the vapor pressure of the brew. The apparent carbonation is a function of
temperature and atmospheric pressure.


Basically, beer with a given content of Carbon Dioxide in solution, will bubble
more vigorously when it's warm than when it's cold. (Also on a rainy day
vs. a sunny one. But that difference is slight.)


It's very likely that the one which is 40 degrees F or so cooler than the
other will appear less carbonated.


Getting the thing nice and chilly is a good way to help offset the effects of
an overcarbonated brew. In fact, I've got a batch right now that will gush if
merely cooled, but is manageable once chilled. (Though it still needs
decanting. Hey, I thought it was done!)

Subject: withholding grains until after conversion


Hi everybody!


     Now that I have my Gott insulated mash/lauter tun all set and ready
to go, I have a couple quick questions.
     I have heard from numerous different sources of the benefits of
leaving any crystal malt of the mash until after conversion.  This
supposedly keeps the complex sugars in the crystal malt from being
reduced to simpler, more fermentable ones, and has the effect of
yielding a maltier tasting beer.
     My first question is, how many people do something like this?  Does
it work?
     Also, what other grains would benefit from this treatment?  I've
heard rumbles that dextrine malts might as well, but I would like a
little more reassurance before I try it.

Last may I used the last of my malt extract to make a smoke lager.  I
made the mistake of using yeast that hadn't seen fresh wort in six
months and the fermentation took off very slowly and never picked up
much speed.  It fermented over a month in the fridge with no sign of
stopping, and being an impatient person I took it out so it would
finish up faster.  It didn't.  Even the heat wave didn't finish it
off.


Finally two weeks ago I tasted it.  Sour.  Infected.  Tasted terrible.
So, two days ago I finally get around to dumping it out.  After the
first few inches of beer gurgled out of the carboy I noticed the beer
aroma had improved.  I poured myself a glass, and sure enough the bad
flavor was gone!  What's happening here?  Shouldn't the whole batch be
as bad as the stuff on top?  Has anyone else ever experienced anything
like this?
