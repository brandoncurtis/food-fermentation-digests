I have to second this question, how many people brew solely from
someone else's recipe?  I have brewed over 20 batches (14 or so that
were all grain) and have never intentionally brewed directly from
someone else's recipe (not even on that first extract batch).  Granted
I have made some mistakes, but I think that experimentation leads to a
better understanding of the flavor contribution of different grains,
hops, and processes.  I have won some awards in competitions, but that
is not my primary objective when formulating a recipe.


I do enjoy reading recipes and have learned a lot about matching style
guidelines by reading other's recipes (esp. those in the volumes of
the Classic Beer Style series).  I look at recipes as guidelines (both
in brewing and in cooking) but I never take a recipe and follow it to
the letter (not even one of my own!).  I too like a little variety in
the beers I drink.  I suppose that I may be tempted to replicate some
of my previous beers if I ever get one that I feel is outstanding, but
I suppose that I am just a likely to try it with a different yeast or
different hops.


Formulating your own recipes really isn't hard, and there has been a
lot of good information published in recent Zymurgys and in the HBD on
how to hit target OGs and the like.  When I look at a recipe, I first
compare the OG, IBUS, color, etc.  with the guidelines for the style,
then look at my inventory (I keep 50-100# of assorted grains, and
several pounds of assorted hops around the house at all times) and see
what I have that can produce a beer in that style.  I break out the
calculator and my brewing notebook and get to work!  Every brew is
different, and I like to think that they are improving as I gain
experience.


This is not intended to knock anyone that is uncomfortable breaking
away from cookbook type brewing.  I hope that it will serve to
encourage others to experiment and post their results (or better yet,
send me some :-).

I just tried the 1028 strain on a couple of back to back english style
ales.  The first was a fairly low gravity Bitter that came out fairly
nicely.  It was not overly hopped, yet the hop bitterness came through
nicely.  I did note the woody and mineral flavor notes in this brew.
The second brew was a fairly hoppy IPA and I wish that I had chosen a
different yeast.  I found that the attenuation was a bit much in the
IPA, but it is still very young and may turn out fine in another month
or so.  The IPA currently has a nasty stale veggi character that I
believe is due to using some old Cascades (they have been kept in the
freezer since I bought them though) for dry hopping.  I just replaced
the blend of Cascades and Kent Goldings with some fresh Mt Hood in the
keg and am hoping for the best.

Right! Bavarian weizens should not have a dominant lactic sourness
(though I find that just a little makes them very refreshing)!


For some more data points, I have brewed a couple of Bavarian weizens
with this strain.  One had virtually no clove or banana aromas or
flavors and really was a bit under attenuated.  The second time I used
it (pitched from the slurry in the secondary on the first batch) I got
a wonderfully clovey/banana weizen character (this beer took 1st place
in the 1993 HWBTA competition in the wheat beer category).  I have
also made a couple of Bavarian weizens with the bavarian wheat strain
from the Yeast Culture Kit Co (don't remember the number but it is
supposed to be the Weinstephen?sp? #66 I think) that had much more
pronounced weizen character.  I certainly believe that the 3056 is a
bit unstable based on my experience and the experience of some others
and I will probably never use it again.  I am looking forward to
trying the new bavarian wheat strain that Wyeast is currently
testing.

Subject: yeast pitch experiment


With my last batch I wanted to pitch as much yeast as possible with
spending as little time as possible playing with it.  Here's what I
did:


1) I boiled up enough hopped 1.020 wort to fill two 16 oz bottles, and
one 32 oz bottle.


2) mixed a packet of wyeast belgian with one of the 16 oz bottles in
the bottom of a very sanitized carboy.


3) the next day I added the entire 32 oz bottle to the carboy.


4) at 8am the next day (brew day) I added the last 16 oz bottle to the
carboy


5) at 4pm that day I finally added the cooled wort to the carboy,
areated by splashing it through the funnel/strainer combination.  The
wort was 1.063 gravity.


6) when I came home that night at 9pm the beer had an inch and a half
of krausen on it.  So, about five hours for a very vigorous takeoff.


7) by the next day the krausen had fallen and now only a week later it
is almost ready to bottle.  This is by far the fastest fermentation I
have ever had with liquid yeast.




conclusions:
I had never used more that 16 oz of starter before because of the
hassles pouring from bottle to bottle.  I also used to have trouble
pitching at high krausen (timing, timing) , but by using the carboy it
is possible to get the yeast up to speed by adding more wort a few
hours before the brewing will happen.

NO, NO, NO!!! The 50/50 mix is a bastardization of the true weissbier
style dreamed up by someone at Wyeast. The true weissbier yeasts are
a pure strain--delbrueckii, if you will. Wyeast has just started
marketing a pure strain weissbier under the number 3068, which if is
the Weihenstephan #68 everyone raves about (assuming the numbering
scheme holds as it has for Weihenstephan 206 and 308....)  Please, oh
please correct this before submitting this.


I have use both and the 3056 (50/50 crud) PALES in comparison to the
3068. I've tossed every culture of 3056 that I could find.

Subject: Use of Chilis in Beer


Hello everyone,


With all of the recent discussion going on about variations of Chili beer's
and how to go about imparting chili flavoring to the beer, I just wanted to
throw in my 2 cents worth.


First of all, let me begin by saying that I have not ever tried to brew a
chili beer and I currently have no plans to attempt one (the chili beers
I've tried, Mexacali Rogue and Cave Creek,  just don't do much for me).  
That aside, I do consider myself an avid chili lover.  As such, one of the 
first things one quickly learns is that individual chilis vary greatly in 
flavor and "heat" intensity.  This holds not only for different varieties, but 
also within specific varieties.  Unless you know the source of the chilis, it's 
difficult to judge this variation below using the chilis.  You can come pretty 
close to grouping chilis based on "heat" if you pay attention to the aroma 
(from the oils in the skins) while roasting/peeling the chilis.


Also, when I mention "source" above, I really mean that you need to know the
source.  I've found that chilis vary dramatically even on different plants 
within my garden.  Chilis can vary greatly (like any other crop) based upon
micro-climate conditions, water, soil conditions, growing season, etc.  If you 
get your chilis at a market or grocery store, odds are that you're getting a 
mix of chilis from various sources.


Hint for home growers:  I've found that if you like really hot chilis, cut back
on the watering once the blossom sets.  Don't kill the plants, but cut back on
the amount of water they receive.  The chilis may be smaller, but they really
seem to get hotter.


That said, I would have to agree (in principal) with Alan in Austin (HBD#1203) 
about warning against spicing beers directly using chilis in the bottle.  
The results, while perhaps good, would be inconsistent (bottle to bottle).
I would think that the technique of "dry peppering" or "dry-chiling" as 
mentioned by Lanny (HBD#1203) and Robin Garr (HBD#1204) would result in much 
better flavor control.  Likewise, adding your chilis to the later stages of 
the boil could work too.  The idea for consistency is to expose the entire 
batch to the same chili mix.  Of course, if you like the idea of not knowing
what to expect, keep the mystery behind the beers and spice using individual
chilis in the bottles!

The latest in Jack's continuing vigil against the accursed momilies of 
brewing focuses on aeration.


He writes:

I'm not sure what Jack's claims are here.  But I'll point out several
points of interest that may affect his "scientific" experiment.


I shall cling to Jack's statement that his experiment "seems" to confirm 
his experience because his conclusions run counter to what the literature
has long accepted as fact.  Not wanting to allow another momily into the 
annals of brewing literature, I'll briefly point out that underaerated wort 
can have definite deleterious effects on the flavor of the beer (increased 
ester production, for one) and adverse effects on the speed of fermentation 
(read increased lag times and the resultant risk of contamination, 
prolonged fermentation times (speaking from experience here), and the 
production of several components that do not contribute to the flavor 
profile of what we normally call "beer". 


But don't take my word for it.  Here is what the pros say about the matter. 


>From _Malting and Brewing Science_:


p.633


"To increase the oxygen content, air is often bubbled into the medium, but 
this has little or no effect if the bubbles escape rapidly.  Small bubbles 
provide a larger surface area for oxygen transfer, while baffles built onto 
the walls of the vessel help to arrest the loss of bubbles.  Shaking or 
swirling the medium has the effect of increasing the effective surface area of 
the liquid presented to the atmosphere.  Furthermore, a vortex produced by an 
agitator has the same effect.
   The rate at which oxygen passes from atmosphere into solution depends on: 
(1) the degree to which the medium is saturated with oxygen, (2) the area of 
the interface between atmosphere and medium and (3) the ease with which oxygen 
passes through the interface.  The rate is expressed by Kla(C*-Cl) where 


Kl - The ease of passage with which oxygen passes through the interface.
a  - The area of interface.
C* - the oxygen concentration at which atmosphere and medium are in
     equilibrium.
Cl - The actual concentration of oxygen in the medium.


They then measured oxygen absorption rates as follow:


Vessel     Vol. of medium                         Air flow        KlaC*
                                                  (l/min)     (mM-O2/l/min)

I interpret KlaC* as being the amount of O2 absorbed into the beer using
the various processes above, though I could be wrong.  It comes as no 
surprise that the different methods achieve different levels of oxygen 
absorption.  It's interesting to note that the surface area of the samples 
exposed to the air makes a big difference in the rate of oxygen absorption.  
Perhaps this lends credence to the theory that one of the best things you 
can do to aerate the wort is let it fan out over the sides of the vessel as 
one siphons into the fermenter.

The authors of _Malting and Brewing Science_ also make the following 
observations concerning the absorption of air into beer:


p. 634
"The role of oxygen in brewery fermentations has received study using 
fermenters of 30 brl capacity.  Wort of SG 1.044 was pitched at .2 lb/brl at 
64 degrees F and the degree of oxygenation prior to pitching was selected in 
the range 5-100% saturation.  The weight of yeast crop was hyperbolically 
related to the initial oxygen concentration of the wort.  Above about 20% 
oxygen saturation, little is acieved if the wort is completey saturated with 
air.  Below this level, the yeast crop is greatly influenced by the initial 
level of oxygen and, with the strain of yeast used, it seemed likely that no 
growth of yeast would occur in the absence of oxygen...the rate of 
fermentation was related to oxygen saturation in a manner very similar to that 
shown (below)."

                Oxygen saturation (%)
p.635


"It is now well established that different strains of brewing yeast have 
different requirements for molecular oxygen.  Furthermore, most, if not 
all, of the molecular oxygen consumed by the brewing yeast is used for the 
production of unsaturated fatty acids and sterols, which are essential 
constituents of the yeast cell membrane...Where insufficient O2 is 
available for membrane synthesis, yeast cells fail to grow and loss of 
membrane integrity results in cell death.  These changes are also 
associated with an increased production of esters...The concentration of 
oxygen at 100% air saturation is inversely proportional to the specific 
gravity; thus an air saturated wort of SG 1.040 contains 8.5 mg/l O2, 
whweras a wort of SG 1.070 contain 7.9 mg/l O2. 


p.646


"The amount of yeast added to the wort at the time of pitching greatly 
influenced the speed of fermentation. (Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!-krb)  
For instance top yeast pitched at 1 lb/brl into wort at 63 degrees F 
attenuated to 75% in 84 hr.  At four times this pitching rate the same

"The effects of rousing or agitating fermentation vessels include aeration 
and mixing.  BOTH TEND TO HASTEN FERMENTATION (emphasis mine), aeration by 
supplementing the dissolved oxygen supplied by the wort, and mixing by 
bringing yeast in the head and yeast that has sedimented into suspension.  
The overall action is to increase yeast crops and speed fermentation.

"Wort composition greatly influences the speed of fermentation, the extent 
of fermentation, the amount of yeast produced, and the quality of the beer 
produced.  The wort constituents which play a major role include 
fermentable carboydrates, assimilable nitrogenous compounds and accessory 
food factors.  Amino acids normally limit growth... 


p. 664


"With respect to the main fermentation, the control on the speed of 
attenuating to satisfactory gravities depends on (1) wort composition, 
especially the level of alpha-amino nitrogen and the spectrum of 
fermentable sugars, (2) DISSOLVED OXYGEN (emphasis mine), (3) temperature, 
(4) pressure, and (5) yeast concentration.....With respect to the effect of 
these variables on flavor, it has been shown that dissolved oxygen content 
can be important.  Reducing the level from 8 to 3 mg )2/l causes 
significant increases (2-4 fold) in the esters ethyl acetate (winey/lacquer 
like), isoamyl acetate (banana esters) and ethyl caproate.  Acetaldehyde 
rises seven-fold.  Level of zinc ions up to .08 mg/l may be necessary for 
satisfactory fermentations." 


Sorry to take up so much space quoting scientific literature but I kept 
coming up with references that pointed to the importance of a well-
oxygenated wort. Besides Jack's experiment, I have been interested in this 
topic of late because I have become aware that we have not been aerating 
our worts enough at Tumbleweed and it appears to be a factor in several of 
the flavor problems we've had.

Subject: New (first!) Brewpub in Kansas City


    I had the thrill of a lifetime this past weekend.  Dining and drinking
    at a restaurant that hadn't officially opened yet.


    To top it all of, the restaurant in question was Kansas City's first
    brewpub.


    I won't dwell on the food (which was wonderful, especially the brewer's
    bread appetizers made from spent grains) but will get to the *real*
    reason for visiting The 75th Street Brewery at 75th and Wornall in the
    Waldo area.


    The beer.


    75th Street currently has three beers on tap that are brewed locally,
    with a fourth coming in September.  "Cow Town Wheat" is a very light,
    very refreshing wheat ale.  It's made from Kansas-grown wheat and
    Munich malts with Hallertauer and Saaz hops.


    "Yardbird's Saxy Golden Ale" commemmorates KC's contribution to jazz
    and bebop.  A light, *very* smooth golden ale, this one uses Vienna
    and Munich malts withy Cascade hops.  A pint of this is probably the
    most refreshing thing the house serves.


    "Possum Trot Brown Ale" is a nicely nutty, unmistakably malty classic
    brown ale.  It uses cluster and cascade hops and I couldn't pry the
    malt combination from the Brew Master (who just *loves* showing off the
    setup to appreciative homebrewers -- maybe others will have more luck. 
    ;-)


    The September addition is called "Muddy Mo Stout" and is billed as a
    dry, Irish-style stout.  It gives me a good excuse to make sure I go
    back next month.  ;-)


    In addition to these on-site brews, 75th Street also offers three guest
    beers.  A hometown favorite, Boulevard, has contributed their "Bully!
    Porter" to this effort.  Brewed by Brewmaster John McDonald, it's an
    outstanding porter.  My limited beer vocabulary just ain't up to
    describing it any more than this.


    Additionally, there's a pair of brews from Anchor Brewing Company.  On
    tap, we have their "Liberty Ale".  75th Street is the only place in KC
    where you can get this beer on tap.  They also sent some of their "Old
    Foghorn" barleywine.  *Man*, this stuff is absolutely *indescribable*. 
    Again, you can't get it anywhere else in KC on tap, and it's a nice
    twist to the menu.


    Anyone coming near KC, give me a holler and I'll help arrange a tour of
    the place for you, or call them directly at 1-816-523-HOPS.


    Okay, I'll say it.  The service staff was unbelievably friendly.  I
    don't think I *ever* saw someone standing around looking upset. 
    Everyone was smiling.  Even when things went wrong for us (hey, the
    place wasn't officially open yet, and it was "investor's party night"),
    everyone was pleasant and bent over backwards to make sure we were
    taken care of and happy.  I can't recall the last time I was pampered
    like that.


    My waiter's name was Ken.  Ask for him.  You won't regret it.




    WortMan


    Disclaimer:  I have nothing to do with The 75th Street Brewery, save as
    a satisfied customer.  I don't own any part of the company, nor do I
    work there.  I know the brewmaster by first name, but he probably
    wouldn't remember me if I walked up to him in a crowded shopping mall,
    so who really cares?  ;-)

Greetings:
 
2 Questions re: hop harvest..
 
1. Do you need to dry the hops before use, or is the drying a method of 
preservation?
2. How do you tell when the hops are "ripe"? 
 
FYI:  I planted 3 different types of hops this year.  The centennial are the
only plant to grow buds so far ~ 30 buds.  The hallertau plant grew the fastest
& biggest, but no buds.  The perle only grew about 6 ft. and stopped growing
about 4 weeks ago.

This sounds very much like the water that I get at home, untreated,
straight from the tap.  Total hardness and alkalinity are in the 40-80 
range. pH is typically 8.  (I don't have the #'s with me so 
I can't quote values).

With such soft water, I never get an alkaline mash.
Where most people have to do an acid rest, I do not.
I frequently have to increase the mash pH as it is too acidic.
Calcium carbonate works well for this. (Added to the mash)


I acidfy my sparge water using 1/4 teaspoon of acid blend in 5 gallons.
That works well, dropping pH to mid 5's.


I've found this sort of water great to brew with.  Adding desired minerals
is much easier than taking them out!

Subject: Barley Water Response


  Awhile back, someone requested information about a Victorian-era English
  drink called "barley water". I believe this was several weeks ago, and the
  reference was to some dialog in the movie "Mary Poppins".
  
  I remembered seeing something about this drink in my historical references,
  but it took awhile to find it. I'll post the information here for general
  interest. The passage is from the book "Food and Drink in Britain" by C.
  Anne Wilson (Barnes & Noble, 1974):
  
     It [barley water] had a long history as an invalid beverage. In the
     sixth centruy A.D., Anthimus had recommended a thin drink made of barley
     with pure warm water as beneficial for fever patients. The later
     medieval version in France had the name tisane (from the Greek ptisana
     for barley water), and it was sweetened with sugar and seasoned with
     licorice and sometimes also figs. Adapted for English use, it more often
     comprised barley boiled in water with licorice, herbs and raisins. It
     was still a licorice-flavored drink in the first part of the seventeenth
     century but soon afterwards was brought up to date by the substitution
     of lemon juice for licorice.
  
  The author went on to mention that there was no longer a barley water
  tradition in the English-speaking world, but that a popular version called
  "horchata" was still enjoyed in Spain and parts of Latin America.
  
  BTW, Wendy and I very much appreciated the favorable response to the Chicha
  & Chang presentation at the AHA Conference. It was a lot of fun to do, and
  we were gratified so many people were willing to expand their horizons
  beyond the "barley, hops, and yeast" tradition. Sorry the chicha arrived
  late (shipping problems), but at least a fair amount finally got consumed.
  Gak & Gerry were seen making a significant dent in the keg following the
  banquet Thursday night.

Subject: Pronunciations


Does there exist either electronically (preferably) or in print a list
of common beer terms and their phonetic spelling?  I've been brewing for
five years and still have friends ask me how to pronounce "Saaz" or
"Maerzen" and I can only shrug my shoulders.  I did see the Beer Hunter
series and alot of the pronunciations may have been given there but I'd
like to have a reference of some sort.  My college edition American
Heritage does not help too much with alot of beer terms which are really
proper names.  Maybe a German or Czech dictionary is what I need :-)

From: Spencer.W.Thomas`at`med.umich.edu
Subject: Boiling


We boil our wort for several reasons:


1. To sanitize it -- there are any number of "nasty" organisms that
would just love to chomp on the sugars in unfermented wort.  If you
boil the wort (and any other water that goes into the fermenter), you
reduce this risk.


2. To add hop bitterness -- because we started with "all grains",
because we used unhopped extract, because we want a bitterer beer
than the hopped extract will give us.  Extraction of hop bitterness
requires boiling for at least 30 minutes, and preferably an hour.


3. To add hop flavor and aroma -- hopped extracts usually have a low
level of hop flavors and aromas.  Boiling hops from 0 to 20 minutes
adds these (the longer the boil, the lower the aroma, but you don't
get appreciable flavor with less than 5-10 minutes).


4. When mashing grains to get part or all of the wort, the boil
precipitates proteins that would otherwise cloud the beer and
potentially produce unpleasant flavors.  This requires 60-90 minutes,
typically.


5. To reduce the volume and concentrate the wort -- again, when
all-grain brewing, you typically get more liquid from the "mash" than
you want to make beer, unless you're making a very light beer.


But, even if # 2-5 don't apply to you, a 15 minute boil to sanitize the
wort is always called for.

Subject: WORT AERATION


 
 >From: "Rick (R.) Cavasin" <cav`at`bnr.ca>
 
 >Just a little quibble with your experiment.  I wonder if there isn't
 one confounding variable you've overlooked, namely, fermenter geometry.
 
 That is one of the problems with any experiment.  The number of variables is 
 usually inifnite.  One nails down as many as possible and those deemed 
 unrelated to the information being sought are eliminated.  It is frequently a 
 subjective choice but that is why the results are published to allow others 
 to ponder.
 
 I would suggest that the geometry of a mason jar is very similar to a typical 
 fermenter.  The fact that they were half full is a detail but of no 
 consequence in the control sample which turns out to be the most important 
 one in the final analysis.
 
 >The surface area/wort volume ratio, and the amount of head space in
 the quart jar fermenters is radically different than what most people
 would encounter in normal...
 
 That is true but it remains to be proven that reducing the headspace would 
 effect on the final results.
 
 It is my opinion that geometry differential increases the oxygenation of the 
 sample using the airstone because it can be aerated longer before the space 
 is filled.  This would only serve to exaggerate the difference between it and 
 the control and tend to favor it but the results speak for themslves.
 
 > In the case of your lager test, is a starter/wort ratio of 1/10 typical?
 (don't know, don't do lagers myself)
 
 The amount of starter is of no consequence.  It is the amount of yeast in the 
 starter that effects the lag time.  The 72 hour lag time at 40 F would 
 indicate that, if anything, there was too little yeast.
 
 >From: "William A Kitch" <kitchwa`at`bongo.cc.utexas.edu>
 
 >  1) I'm curious about the geometry of your small fermenters.
      Specifically I'm wondering about the relative amount of wort
      exposed to air and thereby oxygen.  Let's call.....
 
 >  So all your small scale fermenters have access to a
       lot more oxygen than my 'full scale' primary fermenter.
 
 A valid argument but in this case, it only applies to the control sample as 
 it enhances the aeration of the others.  
 
 In order to prove YOUR point, you would have to show that the control sample 
 had received enough oxygen to provide a normal fermentation by the minimal 
 handling it received and/or through the mechanism of the fermenter geometry.
 
 The experiment proves the former.  I leave it to someone else to scale it up 
 to prove the latter.
 
 >Having made all these theoretical observations here is my practical
 experience:  I siphon my cool wort into the primary through a aerating
 tube.  The aerating tube is a 6 in long plastic tube w/ 1/32" holes
 drilled in the tube wall near one end.  (This end is near the siphon hose
 not at the end the wort exits.)  It works just like your sink aerator;
 air is drawn into the tube through the 1/32" holes and the wort exits
 as a frothy liquid.  When the siphoning is done there is 2 to 6" of
 foam on top of the wort.
 
 I think that you have made one of the points I was testing for in my 
 experiment, vis., the aquarium aerator is an unnecessary complication of the 
 home brewing process.
 
 Having said that, I will point out that with your approach, you only get one 
 shot at it.   With the aerator, one can repeat the foam buildup ad infinitum 
 but the bottom line is, does it really matter?
 
 >From: Chris Williams
 >Subject:       Cold plates and wort chilling
 
 >With all the recent talk about cooling wort, I started wondering if
 you could use a cold plate to accomplish this. If the tubing inside
 the cold plate isn't SS you might get off flavors, or you might
 clog the thing up with hop particles, but is it a valid idea ?
 Any thoughts/experiences ?
 
 The tubing in the ones I am familiar is ss but the problem is the diameter is 
 so small you would need to pressurize or pump the wort through it.  It would 
 be tediously slow by gravity.

Subject: Proteins


My last brew (although wonderfully tasty) had problems with both head
retention and chill haze.  It was a pale ale, the first all-grain pale ale
I've done.  The other all-grainers I've done were darker and had no problem
with either.  Is this coincidence or do dark grains helps these problems
somewhat?


It seems to me that large proteins in solution link together at low
temperatures (that's how they keep warm!) and form the chill haze.  I believe
the solution for me is to add a protein rest to my mash cycle to help the
proteinase enzymes break down these large proteins.  Are there other solutions
to this problem, i.e. a certain grain bill, etc.  I'd rather not depend too
much on finings.


I've read that head retention is a function of the proteins in solution as
well, although I don't know the details.  Would this problem be aided by a
protein rest, too?

the real wuestion seems to be should we use weihenstephan 68 or wyeast.


I (the empiricist) cloned out the wyeast bavarian culture as reported in
HBD a year ago and
found that only about 1% of the colonies had a variant morphology and 
created an estery beer.  I use this exclusively now.  This low percentage
might explain why wyeast cultures are criticized as bland.


One other question:  What source is there for the Weihenstephan 68 strain??
