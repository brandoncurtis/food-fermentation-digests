Subject: RE: Yeast FAQ; and more


The yeast FAQ that Patrick (WEIZ`at`swmed.edu) posted was a great public 
service. I wanted to add my personal experiences with the Wyeast 1028
(London Ale Yeast) and 1056 strains.


Patrick's original post on 1028 said:

I tend to agree with Al on this one. I am a prodigious user of the Wyeast
1056 strain, albeit not their culture. I believe that Seibel has this
strain catalogued as being from the Narraganset brewery and was used by
them in their Porter. It has been reported in this sage journal as being
the Sierra Nevada house strain. I get this yeast from the Washington, DC 
local Old Dominion Brewery by the quart. I find this yeast a great 
performer yet too bland for many styles. In my search for a characterful 
yeast I have settled on the Wyeast 1028. I use the actual Wyeast strain.


I have found the Wyeast 1028 to have the complex woody character that
is ascribed to it above. It does produce many other pleasant esters that
remind me of cask Wadsworth's 6X. I have found it to be a strong
attenuator. The Narragsanset/Sierra Nevada yeast is a VERY strong
flocculator. Once it is done with the job it DROPS! The London Ale
yeast is a bit more dusty so it hangs around and nibbles on them sugars
a bit longer. This may be the character that seemed to accentuate hop
bitterness. I have not found this yeast to be a big diacetyl producer.
On the contrary, I find the Narraganset/Sierra Nevada culture to be a
bigger diacetyl producer. Especially in higher gravity beers. As far
"green apple" acetaldehyde, not in my experience.


An interesting behavior of the 1028 is its "top fermenting character."
Very large colonies of yeast form on top of the krausen. These are the
size of pie plates.


A recent experience with this yeast bears out my description. I made a
batch of 1.052 Pale Ale with this yeast. The recipe follows. The woody
character of the yeast (very apparent) combined with the MT Hood
characteristic resiny character to produce a very pleasant beer. Plenty
of character here for me.

Subject: Mashing in picnic cooler


On Saturday, I mashed for the first time in my new mash tun - an
insulated picnic cooler with slotted pipe sparge manifold - and
was impressed with how much easier it was than with my old Bruheat.
I prewarmed the tun to 80C, then mixed 5.3 kg (11.6 lb) of pale malt
with 13 litres (2.9 Imperial gallons) water at 76C. The resulting
mash started at 66C and dropped to 65C over 90 min. I stirred occasionally
to redistibute any cold spots near the walls. I sparged to 6 (UK)
galls at a gravity of 69 at 20C. My calculations suggest that
I had almost 100% theoretical yield!! My highest with the Bruheat had been
about 85, and usually about 20% of this was unfermantable, probably
due to hot spots near the heating element, killing off the beta-amylase.


The other advantage is that the Bruheat can now be used to heat the sparge 
water (no more sparging with pans from the stove), and the runnings from the
mash tun can be sent straight to the Bruheat for boiling. Assuming that
the resulting beer tastes OK, I'm completely sold on the new system.

Subject: Computer Controlled Mashing


Has anyone on the net undertaken the process of automating their 
mash by using a closed loop control system. 


ie: temp sensor --> computer --> solenoid --> gas burner --> brew pot --
         ^                                                             |
         |                                                             |
         ---------------------------------------------------------------


I have used the BruHeat Boiler (hope I can mention the name) for some time
with good results but got a nice little tingle from it the other day so am 
no longer keen on electrical heating elements. Instead I now have a 3 ring 
gas burner beneath a 40Gal SS keg which enables me to do larger batches which
come up to temperature quicker. What I would like to do with this system
is use the inner ring (or possibly a seperate element) as a pilot flame with 
a computer controlled solenoid that would switch gas on/off to the other 
rings to maintain the appropriate mash temp.


Ofcourse there are much easier (and cheaper) ways of managing a temperature 
controlled mash but a computererised system (at a reasonable price)
provides IMO a great way of documenting and reproducing recipes!


What do people think? Are there other problems with this sort of system such 
as exactly where in the mash should you measure the temperature or should the 
mash be constantly mixed, etc?


Any info would be appreciated.




Cheers,


Murray.

  In the continuing "barley water" debate, Darryl writes:

  I did a little more reading on the subject, and Darryl is correct. Modern-
  day horchata is rice-based. However, at one time, it apparently was barley-
  based. The term "horchata" comes from the Latin "hordeum", meaning
  "barley". It appears that rice supplanted barley as the grain of choice
  when the Moors introduced rice to Spain in the late middle ages. 
  
  There also appears to be another form of horchata, found mostly in Spain,
  made from chufa, or ground tiger nut - the underground tuber of a plant
  called "earth almond". One reference says this tuber was mentioned in the
  writings of Theophrastus as being harvested by the Egyptians and cooked in
  barley juice. Hence, the original "chufa horchata" appears to have derived
  from this ancient Egyptian tradition.

Greetings, all - does anyone in the Washington DC area have any information
on a new brewpub that's been a-building in Gaithersburg for a long, thirsty
time?  I recently moved nearby, and the sight of a brewpub gave me a very
positive viewof the local quality-of-life index.  Now it's the middle of
a mid-Atlantic August, my thirst is great, and the brewpub continues to hold
its peace.  Anyone know the brewer-founder, plans, opening date, etc?

Subject: preservatives??


Howdy,
I have a question for those of you in the know concerning  preservatives and
their toxicity to yeast.  Specifically, I recently bought some catawba and
concord grape juice from one of the lake Erie wineries to use to make some
pyment (grape mead).  After purchasing however, I noticed that the juices are
preserved with "benzoate of soda", which I presume means sodium benzoate.
Questions, a) how persistant is this stuff; i.e. does it become non-toxic or
un-reactive with time like sodium metabisulfite? and b) if it is persistant is
there a threshold level below which my yeasty-beasties should be safe?


     The juice is extremely sweet (not at all like Welch's) and I was thinking
that I would use it at about 2.25L of juice and 6-8 lbs of honey per 3gal of
finished pyment.  One way of testing is to try a small (say 1gal) pilot batch,
and I may do this regardless, but advance info would be helpful.


     I have further interest in this subject because I would like to figure out
another way to make hard cider and cyser this fall without the use of
metabisulfite.  Call me hypersensitive, but I still taste and smell the sulfur
in the hard cider I made last year using campden tablets and then pitching
Wyeast Irish Ale (1084?).  The sulfur aroma is not real obvious, but I'd like
to try to avoid it this year and still ferment with a yeast of known
characteristics instead of leaving it up to the wild beasts.


TIA

Subject: Mash Out


>I know what the Mash Out does for the grain (stop enzyme activity)

Provides for repeatability, mostly.  ie: enzyme activity is stopped 
after x minutes, period.


>Is there a difference between mashing out in the mash tun
>and lautering with 170 deg water?  




Yes.  You won't have enough mass of sparge water at 170 degrees
to raise the entire grain-bed (with its water at, say, 150 degrees)
up to the enzyme-stopping temperature.  And you shouldn't use water
much hotter than 170, for fear of tannins and other off-flavors being
carried into your beer.  This is an argument for mashing in a kettle
on the stove, or going to decoction (did I spell that right?) as opposed
to the straight infusion method.




>Bottom line:  What is being gained (or lost if we don't mash out)?  TIA.


Gained: a little time


Lost: repeatability

        FWIW - 2 tips that have helped me...


1 - I make a temporary burner liner for my gas stove from two layers
        of aluminum foil.  Cut an asterisk shape the size of your burner 
        element        in the center of the first and fold under the hole 
        in the stovetop for the burner element.
        Leave plenty of excess to cover the enamel stovetop.  Do the
        same with the second sheet, perpendicular to the first.  This 
        helps with the stains from burnt wort and the enamel distress
        from 1.5 hours of high heat.  It also helps to have the stove 
        spotless to start with.


2 - I sparge using the grainbag-in-a-bucket system.  I've found that 
        using two sections of newspaper taped around the bucket w/ masking
        tape makes an effective/recyclable insulation.  Cut an indentation
        if you use a tap at the base.


Pet peeve:  Let's remember that some of us call long distance to download
the HBD.  I'd rather read valuable brewing info than cute tagline drawings
or excessive quotes from the previous HBD.


Question:  For my last 2 batches, I've used Wyeast Chico/Ballantine (1056)
yeast.  This appears to be a bottom fermenting ale yeast.  Isn't that an
oxymoron (ie.jumbo shrimp, military intelligence)?  Aren't yeast segregated
as either top/ale or bottom/lager?  Dr. Fix?

You may not see a public response to this, because I have never been
able to successfully post to HBD.  Maybe it will work this time, I
will try.


Although I am not an all grain brewer yet (will be in a couple of
weeks), it seems to me that once you have done your boil and have
racked to a fermenter, it matters not at all how you got your wort.
You will still have malt sugar, water, yeast and hops in a carboy.  If
you used a blowoff fermentation setup before and it worked and you
liked it, keep using it.  BTW, I use a blowoff hose and ferment in a
SS soda keg.  I get tons of krauesen and hop pellet residue in my air
lock bucket.  I really like the blowoff system.

 Subject: yeast cultural hysteria


"I have a second proposal that merges two suggestions brought up in the last
 couple of issues:  sharing yeast cultures via the network ... This network
 offers a wonderful means by which to distribute the culture, rather than
 wait until who knows when for its release.  Certainly, someone out there
 has an agar slant full of this stuff."




I like this idea, also, but it is not a new one. I was browsing through the
bread FAQs I could find in gopherspace, over the past few days, and discovered
that there is a very close parallel between bread yeast, and beer yeast,
collectors. Bread yeast collectors also trade yeast samples ... sourdough is
a fairly common variation, as it occurs, differently, all over the world.


Below is a method for preserving bread yeast and stabilizing them for mailing
and long-term storage. I don't *know* that it will work for beer yeast, but
I see no reason why not ... I don't think agar slants are a prerequisite to
successful propogation of a genotype ... just a useful intermediate storage.


Here's another useful intermediate storage that may be much more stable.


The procedure, as described, lacks sanitary safeguards ... but I don't think
this is an unsurmountable problem. A homemade glove box would do nicely. (-:


Aluminum foil might be preferred over wax paper, for sanitary reasons.

Subject: Brewpots


I just had a 6.5 gallon stainless steel brew pot made for me.  The materials
for a 14 gauge stainless (this is probably thicker than "restaurant gauge")
amounted to $75.  The real "cost" involved is the actual construction.  Getting
someone with stainless cutting/welding experience and the right equipment is 
the trick.


My father-in-law is a supervisor at a beef plant where they do all of their
own stainless work.  My pot has a fitted lid, stainless handles fabricated from 
1/2" rod (with walnut grips) and a 3/8" stainless threading pipe at the base.


All it cost me was a batch of beer!!!




> Warehouse in Seattle, WA.  The following was quoted:
>   10 gal. stainless steel brew pot -        $149.00

The prices for the screen/valve seem a bit high but the price for the pot 
itself is reasonable (assuming you get a lid).

 >The latest in Jack's continuing vigil against the accursed momilies of
 brewing focuses on aeration.
 
 >I'm not sure what Jack's claims are here.  But I'll point out several
 points of interest that may affect his "scientific" experiment.
 
 
 I am not sure what Kinney's point in this lengthy response is but I have 
 several reasons to suppose it is something other than objectivity.
 
 First of all, puting the word scientific in quotes is a rather unprofessional 
 way of trivializing the time and effort I put into this.
 
 Secondly, if he misunderstood the conclusion and objective of the experiment 
 before posting this same stuff on r.c.b., he certainly is aware now, that it 
 has nothing to do with what I was trying to learn.  We thrashed it out on 
 r.c.b. for over a week and to restate the original objections and ad hominems 
 without changing a single word, reeks of demagoguery.
 
 For those who may still be confused, the conclusion follows...
 
 ............
 
 CONCLUSION...
 
 The experiment seems to confirm the author's previous experience and points 
 to the conclusion that the method of aeration used has no correlation with or 
 effect on the time to onset of fermentation.  Contrary to frequently stated 
 anecdotal experience, the un-aerated control samples started fermenting as 
 soon and with the same vigor as the variously aerated samples.  This was true 
 both in the case of cold temperature lager yeast and room temperature ale 
 yeast.
 
 This experiment was not intended to test any other aspects of the brewing 
 process that may be affected by wort aeration.  Much has been written on the 
 subject and the present author's intent was only to study the effects of 
 aeration on the onset of fermentation.
 
 ..........
 
 I will be happy to discuss aeration as related to lag time but, flavor 
 profiles, final gravities and other aspects are not part of the study nor is 
 the overall need for adequate aeration under question.
 
 For the record, the imcoming mail is in very close agreement with my 
 conclusion.  I have yet to hear from a single person who reports that lag 
 time has dropped after switching to an aquarium aerator from whatever they 
 were doing before.
 
 It may seem like nitpicking to prove that aeration does not improve lag time 
 if it is necessary anyway for good beer but nit picking is what science is 
 all about.
 
 If someone makes a statement that lists 10 reasons for doing something but 
 one of them is wrong, the entire statement becomes suspect.
 
 If aquarium aerators do not improve (reduce) lag time, it is time to stop 
 saying they do, no matter how important aeration is for other reasons.
 
 If they do, someone else will have to prove it, I tried and could not.

 Lautering with 170 deg water is not the same as mashing out in the kettle 
 because the mash temp never gets anywhere near 170 degs while sparging.
 
 Bringing the entire mash up to 170 before sparging has the effect of 
 increasing the mash temperature during the sparge.  This possibly results in 
 a more effective sparge, less possibility of stuck sparges and some chemical 
 aspects that I will leave to the experts.

Subject: Cream Stout


This past weekend I devoted some time to my OTHER hobby (namely,
drinking good commercial beers) and happened upon some Watney's Cream
Stout.  This was one of the best beers I have ever tasted, and I would
like to brew one similar (as similar as I can get) and would hope for
some pointers from fellow HBD'ers.  Here are my (possibly erroneous)
understandings:
1) Cream stouts have lactose added to sweeten them.  In the boil?  At
bottling? In between?


2) Stouts are traditionally made with darker adjunct grains added such
as roasted barley, chocolate malt, black patent.  As an extract brewer I
would steep the grains before bringing my water to a boil.  Now that I
am hoping to move on to partial and all grain recipes, when does one add
these adjuncts?


3) The Watney's I sampled seemed much lighter in body than other stouts
I hve tried.  Does anyone have any idea of an OG and FG for the style?
Is it the same as the sweet stout in Papazian's general guide lines?


Any helpful information will be appreciated.  If you e-mail me direct, I
will edit the responses and post a summary on Cream Stout to the HBD.
If you post to the HBD, then I will not summarize in the interest of
conserving bandwidth.

Subject: Source for pumps wanted


I'd be interested any any sources and recommendations for pumps to move
both wort and hot water.  I'd like to be able to lift 175 df and above
water to a hot liquor tank (HardSparger(tm), all in good fun Jack!) as
well as run hot water and cleaning solutions through the pump and other
parts of a system like a counter flow chiller. I am aware that the pump
should pull (rather than push) the wort through the chiller to avoid HSA. 
It is difficult to tell (at least for this layman) which pumps can handle
the high temperatures, are food grade quality, will deliver an appropriate
throughput, will raise water the 6-8 feet (est), and are available for a
reasonable price.  I've got the Cole-Parmer catalog and think I've
identified an appropriate pump.  Still, I'd like the advice and
recommendations of those who've gone this route already; is there
something better, cheaper?.  If you have a recommendation, please be as
specific as you can regarding source, model number, catalog page number,
price, etc.  SF Bay Area sources also appreciated.

I will try to find my source for this and post, but from my memory, it's
not anything to do with blending of four beer made from four yeasts, rather
PU was (or maybe still is) brewed with a mixed strain.  Again, from memory,
someone, several years ago, got a hold of the PU production yeast and from
it they isolated four different yeasts, which they called A, B, C and D.
I believe that they made test batches and the B and D strains were the most
Pilsner Urquell-like.

From: sc`at`vcc.com (Steve Casselman)
Subject: Two Cents on Aeration.




So let me put in my two cents in on aeration. As far as I know
there are two different kinds of fermentation, aerobic and 
anaerobic. During aerobic fermentation yeast take sugars and water and
produce CO2 and water. Yeast can only reproduce during the aerobic growth
stage. This means that a yeast cell produces another free roaming off
spring. When the O2 runs out yeast go into anaerobic fermentation. During
this time they consume sugars and water and produce CO2 and alcohols. 
At this time they stop reproducing and start budding which produces
a long heavy chain of cells which start to drop due to their weight,
this is called floculation. The trick is to have enought yeast such
that during anaerobic fermention the yeast consume the sugars before
they floculate. This can be done by adding alot of single yeast cells
or by having enough O2 in your wort for the yeast you add to reproduce
to the right levels. 


One of the experiments I have done in the past was to take pure
water in a corney and force oxgenate it. I then added this to
my chilled wort. While I never got levels right (the yeast didn't
floculate for a long time) my lag times went down dramaticly. 


Lately though I just try and ferment in a large plastic bucket
with a loose fitting lid for the first week then rack to 15 Gal
kegs. We resently made 30 gals of beer and put 20 gals into the
"open" fermentor and ten in the keg. The keg had an air lock.
After the primary fermention we took a gravity reading the 
20 gals came out at 1.012 while the keg fermentaion came in
at 1.030.

I borrowed a kegging system from a friend and noticed

I clean these lines?


I have iodophor, chlorine, TSP, and boiling water.  I think
one of these should work.

Here's a new one on me: 
I heard "lauter" pronounced "LOI-ter" at the AHA conference.  Is this
correct?  Should it be spelled laeuter?

          Is there a difference between mashing out in the mash tun
          and lautering with 170 deg water?  Bottom line:  What is
          being gained (or lost if we don't mash out)?  


A more important reason for mashout (besides denaturing the enzymes
as Tom mentioned) is to make the runoff more, well, runny (less
viscous).  Yes, 170F sparge water will raise the temperature eventually,
but lautering will be slower than if you had gotten the whole mash up
to 170F before trying to get the sugars away from the husks.

What is the feelings out there on whether to employ a blow-off 
fermentaion or not?  Just using a 7 gal carboy and not worrying
about boiling off enough to fit in a 5 gal carboy seems like a
lot less stress, but I've always used a blow-off in my extract brews.


I did two blowoff/non-blowoff experiments using split batches, and the
difference was very noticable.  The non-blowoff sub-batch was more bitter
and astringent than the blowoff sub-batch.  However, I have reason to
believe (I've posted it in the past) that the blowoff method may reduce
your head retention.  I haven't done enough experiments to prove or
disprove this, so it needs some more work.  Has anyone else seen this
(blowoff - head retention) correlation?

Those of us who were fortunate enough to be at the AHA National in Portland
this year got to see an impressive looking new malt mill made by the company
named in the subject line.  When I got home I immediately ordered one.


Well, that was the 3rd of August.  Today, the 23rd, I got a telephone call
from the owner of Glatt Machining.  He called from Oregom - I live in New
Hampshire - to tell me that he was behind in his orders and would have my
mill out to me by the end of the week.  He said that the response to his mill
has been so good that he can't keep manufacturing fast enough.  


He also asked me if I wasa on the internet.  When I said that I had access to
internet mail he asked me to tell "all those internet people" that he was
running behind in filling orders, but would get them out as soon as he can. 
I figured that the internet people must be the HBD.
Having done that, I've made good on my promise.  


As far as the mill is concerned, its an all metal contruction, and has two
grooved rollers.  It's adjustable and the hopper holds about 2.5 lbs of
grain.  The real surprise is that it's only US$80 per mill plus S&H.  I was
impressed.


Naturally, I have no commercial connection with Glatt Machining or anything
like that, this is meant just as general info.
