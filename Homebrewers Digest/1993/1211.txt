Those of us who were fortunate enough to be at the AHA National in Portland
this year got to see an impressive looking new malt mill made by the company
named in the subject line.  When I got home I immediately ordered one.


Well, that was the 3rd of August.  Today, the 23rd, I got a telephone call
from the owner of Glatt Machining.  He called from Oregom - I live in New
Hampshire - to tell me that he was behind in his orders and would have my
mill out to me by the end of the week.  He said that the response to his mill
has been so good that he can't keep manufacturing fast enough.  


He also asked me if I wasa on the internet.  When I said that I had access to
internet mail he asked me to tell "all those internet people" that he was
running behind in filling orders, but would get them out as soon as he can. 
I figured that the internet people must be the HBD.
Having done that, I've made good on my promise.  


As far as the mill is concerned, its an all metal contruction, and has two
grooved rollers.  It's adjustable and the hopper holds about 2.5 lbs of
grain.  The real surprise is that it's only US$80 per mill plus S&H.  I was
impressed.


Naturally, I have no commercial connection with Glatt Machining or anything
like that, this is meant just as general info.

Source: Kerwin Manuel (KerwinM`at`aol.com)


Ingredients:


                7.0 lbs Wheat Malt Extract (60/40)
                1/2 lb  Crystal Malt
                1/8 lb  Chocolate or Black Patent (your preference)
                1.0 lb  Clover Honey (my preference)
                1/2 tsp Gypsum (adjust +/- for your water)
                1.0 oz  Tettnanger for 60min
                1/2 oz  Hallertau Hersbrucker for 30min
                1/2 tsp Irish Moss for 10min
                1/2 oz  Tettnanger-Secondary Dry Hop        
                1/2 oz  Hallertau -Secondary Dry Hop
                1-2 pkg Ale Yeast (Wiezen Yeast if you prefer)
                
Procedure:


Steep crystal and chocolate malts for 30 minutes in 1.5 gals of 150 degree F
water. Sparge into brew pot and add malt extract, honey, gypsum and enough 
water to bring volume to 3 gallons. Bring to a boil and add 1 oz Tettnanger,
continue boil & 30 minutes later add 1/2 oz of Hallertau, still boiling 20 
minutes later (50 minutes into the boil) add 1/2 tsp of Irish Moss for final
10 minutes.  Total boiling time is 60 min. Pour wort into primary fermenter
filled with 2 gallons of cold water (splashing hot wort into cold water to 
aerate).  Pitch yeast when temperature is within range, 70-80 degrees F.  
5-7 days in the primary and after fermentation has slowed, transfer to the 
secondary fermenter.  Add dry hops (bagged or free floating) to secondary 
(I prefer to use a bag..easier to clean-up) and complete fermentation for 4
weeks.  3/4 to 7/8 cup of corn sugar for priming and bottle.  Carbonation
should be ready after at least 5 days (I was anxious to try this batch!)


Comments:


Very smooth, good mouth feel.  Slightly estery. Banana or fruit aroma?
I'll use a real wheat yeast next time. Clear, copper color.  OK head 
retention and color.  Very crisp, clean hop bouquet/aroma.  Slightly sweet,
smooth going down.  Alcoholic taste, too much? Small, delicate bubbles. 
All disclaimers apply...after all, I'm judging my own creation !  Actually, 
several friends (and a couple of strangers) have told me they really like 
this one.  I apologize if this recipe seems too explicit for some of you 
experienced types...but I remember what it was like just starting out...
recipes or instructions with only partial information...phooey !




Specifics:


Original Gravity:Sorry..didn't take any readings
Final Gravity:
Primary Ferment: 5-7 days
Seconday Ferment: 4 weeks
Type of Fermenter: Plastic
Temp of Ferment: 70-76 degrees F

In my report on the Pilsner Urquell brewery, I noted that they 
were using three yeasts identified as D, H, and W.  I believe 
that Miller has reported four strains in use and Jackson, 5. 


I was explicitly told that the beer from each yeast is kept 
separate until the yeast is cropped, and then the beer is 
blended by taste. 


I have speculated on this before;  I believe that there is only 
one strain in use, but it has a tendency to mutate.  In order to 
avoid problems, the PU brewery grows up a pitching slurry and 
labels it with a letter (for example, 'A').  They brew beer from 
this yeast and attempt to maintain it as if it were a separate 
strain in the brewery during successive repitchings. 


At some fixed interval, they grow up another batch of yeast 
('B') and begin brewing with it, also.  The 'A' yeast eventually 
mutates, or it becomes infected, and the brewers are able to 
detect it while it isn't very severe.  They can blend off the 
results (cutting the flavor contribution to well under the taste 
threshold, perhaps a third to a fifth of the level at which they 
were able to detect it) and dispose of that batch of yeast. As 
this happens somewhat unpredictably, the distribution of letters 
assigned to successive yeast batches, and the number of batches 
in use, varies.

        Well this isn't exactly a recommendation but maybe it could turn 
into a source... 
        
        Has anyone ever looked into using a dishwasher pump? (or maybe even
a washing machine pump?) I would think that since it was designed to move
hot water, soap, detergents and bleach (the washer anyways) around that it
could probably handle wort/beer as well. A dishwasher pump has the added 
bonus of being meant for handling dishes someone will eat off of. (hopefully
this means that it's not going to pass on nasties to our beer)
        
        As far as availability, there are used appliance stores everywhere 
and most will sell salvaged parts.

I am in the midst of moving, so most of what I own is in boxes and I
can't brew.  But the Boston Wort Processors will be informally
evaluating the Glatt and several other mills in our upcoming Klassic

aren't prepared, for example, to run the crushed grain through screens
of graduated fineness, but we will take a close look at the crush and
the quality of construction and ease of use of the mills.

For my recently operational RIMS, I'm using a March Manufacturing seal-less
magnetic drive pump, model MDX-1/2.  The magnetic drive allows seal-less
construction and prevents the fluid from contacting the mechanical 
hardware and lubricants.  The materials in contact with the fluid are
food-safe plastics, ceramic, and stainless steel and can withstand a
reported 190 F.  It has 1/2 inch barbed ports for plastic tubing hookups.
It operates on household current at 1/50 HP and can move 5.5 gpm at
zero head, and has a maximum head of 7 feet.  A speed controller built
according to Rodney Morris' schematic in the Zymurgy Gadgets special
issue works fine.
 
For information about retailers near you, call March at 708-729-7062.  All
retailers in my area were selling this pump for about $95.  C&H Sales Company,
however, sells it for $49.50 via mail order.  C&H can be reached at 
800-325-9465.  Their catalog has many reasonably-priced items that may be
used in a RIMS.

It is interesting, but if we ever do get this distribution of Weihenstephan
68 off the ground, please, please, please, don't attempt to use this as a
distribution method.  It may work for bread, but it will certainly prove
counterproductive in the propagation of any beer yeast (bread risings are
only a couple of hours and you don't care what's there, fermentations last
days, and you do).  In this case agar slants are a prerequisite to the
propagation of a pure culture, helping to maintain the integrity of the
culture, and, thus, its stability.  There will be a lot of angry HB'ers out
there who expecting a wonderful weizen, end up with something between a
lambic and pond scum instead.  The agar slants allow for the examination
and picking of individual colonies.  Many of the nasties that can spoil
hopped wort (e.g. lactobacillus) frequently fail to grow on the surface of
agar, whereas they can be carried quite well in a dried mass of yeast.  You
will end up with a really nice microfloral garden if you propagate this
way.  When somebody indicates that a culture is available, we can take some
time to establish a protocol for propagation (one that must be adhered to
at all cost).  The worst thing would be to ship people contaminated
cultures.

 At this time they stop reproducing and start budding which produces
 a long heavy chain of cells which start to drop due to their weight,
 this is called floculation.
 
 I won't argue with the overall thesis but you have the reproductive part a 
 little confused.  Budding, i.e. vegatitive propagation, is the ONLY way that 
 beer yeast reproduce in the normal fermentation environment.  The parent cell 
 forms a bud which drops off at the appropriate moment to grow up and do 
 likewise.  I doubt that reproduction ever stops completely until fermentation 
 is over but in any case, budding has nothing to do with floculation.
 
 CORRECTION....
 
 The following statement fogs my point in the comments I last made on the 
 objective of the experiment.  It was not, however part of the original 
 CONCLUSION.
 
 
 >It may seem like nitpicking to prove that aeration does not improve lag time

 The objective of the experiment was to test the air pump/airstone and not 
 aeration in general.  The fact that the "non-aerated" control started at the 
 same time is interesting but can be explained by other mechanisms. 
 
 The statement would be more correct if... artificially enhanced aeration does 
 not seem to improve lag time in small batches...

Hey:
        Well it is getting to be brewing season for me again and I am
raring to go.  I have come into possession of 12.5 lbs of blueberries and
am interested in making a blueberry beer.  I have searched the archives
using WAIS and looked in Cat's Meow and haven't found what I am looking
for.  The most common problem is that people give the recipe and then say
"This really didn't have any discernable blueberry flavor or color." I am
looking for an all-grain recipe, maybe a wheat beer, with pronounced
flavor and color.  I picked these berries myself and I don't want to waste
all that work.  Some things I am particularly concerned about are 1)when
to add the blubes, 2) How much to add, 3)how long to ferment them, 4) How
to prepare them (ie blanching, pureeing, etc.) 5) What sort of hop rates
are appropriate (I understand that too much hops doesn't go well). 
Anyway, all information would be appreciated....

Anthony writes:
>1) Cream stouts have lactose added to sweeten them.  In the boil?  At
>bottling? In between?


I'm not sure if all cream stouts or all sweet stouts have lactose in them,
but since I've recently done a semi-sweet (demi-sec?) stout that turned out
quite nicely, I can offer a bit of advice.  There are several things to
keep in mind:


1. Lactose is unfermentable by conventional brewing yeast (it may be
fermentable by other yeasts, but I don't know) but I strongly suspect that
it is fermentable by Lactobacillus and/or Pediococcus bacterias, so be extra
careful with sanitation or you'll get glass grenades.


2. You can add it in the boil or boil it in some water to sanitize and add
it anytime up to bottling time, but I recommend adding it at bottling time
because you can: add 4 ounces, taste, add 4 more ounces, taste again...
You can adjust the sweetness to what you want it to be.  Remember that the
beer will taste a bit less sweet when it gains the acidity of carbonation.


3. Lactose is not very sweet.  It appears that the larger the carbohydrate
molecule, the less sweet it is.  Lactose is a pretty big sugar and therefore
not very sweet.  You will need at least 8 ounces net weight in a 5 gallon
batch to make a small difference.


4. How much?  I had a relatively sweetish stout to begin with, having added
a good 2# of various DeWolf-Cosyns crystal malts.  I ended up adding 8 ounces
(net weight) of Lactose to the 5 gallon batch and ended up with a not-too-
sweet stout that was quite good.  I wanted to avoid making a super-sweet
stout since I had just returned from the Caribbean and down there they like
their stouts so sweet (Dragon Stout, for example) you can pour them on
pancakes!  


5. Lactose sweetness is different from sweetness gained from malt.  It is
quite noticable and Brian North (a BJCP National judge) immediately pegged
my beer as containing lactose.  The obviousness of the lactose decreases as
the beer ages.


6. Black and Brown malts give your beer quite a bit of acidity, so (unless
your water is high in Carbonates -- this is why Dublin is known for stouts
and not known for it's pale ales) adding some Calcium Carbonate (a tablespoon
or two for a 5 gallon batch) would help take away some of that dark grain
sourness and help make the beer appear sweeter.

Not for most of us. I called SIGMA and told them I was looking for

And she was really worked up about the food thing. Personally, I
don't feel comfortable about non-food grade stuff. The 1% impurities
could be a lot of heavy metals that don't purge themselves from
your body and cause fun stuff like liver damage.


Anyway, I'm still looking for a source of FOOD-GRADE calcium
chloride. There must be a commercial brewer's supply that carries the
stuff, even if I have to buy a 20 lb sack (it doesn't go stale or
anything!).

Subject:      The word "lauter"


The word "lauter" comes from "laeuter" in German which means "to
purify." The "ae" combination is used when your character set has no
umlauts. And you heard it right at the AHA, it should be pronounced
"LOY-ter". I think that the word is a victim of the English habit of
just dropping the umlauts instead of using the "e" after the vowel.

Subject: WORT AERATION




      The dialogue concerning Jack Schmidling's wort aeration
experiment continues on the digest.  I have E-mailed Jack directly
concerning his experiment.  However I feel that misconceptions
continue regarding the experiment so I feel compelled to bring my
concerns up on the digest.


      In his experiment, Jack's hypothesis (not actually stated) is
that one or more of the treatments differ in fermentation
characteristics from the control.  We must then disprove that
hypothesis, by testing the null hypothesis, i.e., there are no
differences between treatments. Note you can never "prove" a
hypothesis, only disprove it.   


      I feel that Mr. Cavasin's criticism remains valid since Jack
fails to adequately address the alternate hypothesis for his
results:  that is, he can't be certain that oxygen did not enter
the wort (in all treatments) by simple diffusion.  Put another way,
the experiment does not closely mimic the situation in the brewery.
Simple diffusion into the wort in all treatments is certain,
considering the long lag time (72 hours for duration of the
experiment) and the small sample volumes involved.  This indicates
a high surface area to volume ratio.  The yeast in all treatments,
as well as the control, could simply be responding to levels of
oxygen achieved as a result of the simple diffusion from the head
space in the jars (rather than any similarity in aeration of the
samples as a result of treatment procedure).  This would account
for the similar lag times that were found.  Therefore comparisons
between treatments remain uncertain.  BTW, the alternate hypothesis
is the simpler hypothesis.


      There are two ways to alter this experiment The first and
most obvious is to make four full-scale batches (5-10 gallons?). 
The valid assumption can then be made that the experiment mimics
the situation in the (home) brewery.  The second way is to prevent
any additional "contamination" of the treatments with oxygen after
they have been set up.  Erlenmyre flasks, completely filled with
wort with the proper treatment (possibly handled under inert gas
such as nitrogen) and fitted with blow-off tubes would be one way
to go.  Before running either experiment, one should go through the
possible alternate hypotheses to see if there might be a reasonable
doubt about any experimental outcome.


      The criticism that the experimental environment does not
mimic the natural situation is a very common criticism of
experiments.  Jack can take comfort in the company he has with
numerous PhD and MSc students in science!




      Cheers!
