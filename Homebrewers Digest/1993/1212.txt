Subject: Tun size and cheepness






HBD was a great source of help for keggin info a year or so ago, 
so I'm back with more questions.  With the time I save by 
kegging  instead of bottling, I figure I can go all-grain and 
still not  spend much more time than I used to. I'm acquiring 
stuff bit by bit  to start and have run into problems finding 
a suitable mash tun. I'd planned on using a cylindrical "picnic 
cooler", but haven't been able to find the larger ones.  Not 
true...I did find a large  (10 gal?) one at an "exclusive" 
outdoor shop, but I didn't have the kind of money they wanted.
I've found 5 gal ones at plenty of places, but that's the 
largest around here.  




So...three questions: 




1.  Would a 5 gal cooler make an adequate mash/lauter tun for 
5 gal batches with an average amount of grain?  




2.  If not, is there a relatively cheap source for large 
coolers?  




3.  Can a rectangular cooler make a suitable tun?  I like 
the idea of a smaller grain surface area, but could sacrifice 
that for economy.  




Understand, I'm deep in Southern Maryland, far from  
civilization :), but close to DC and Baltimore for supplies.
By the way, I'm currenty using a propane hot water heater 
element as a burner.  They're pretty poular around here as 
crab cookers, and will boil something like 100 gal of water in 
15 sec.  At least that's  how hot they feel leaning over one on 
a summer day :)  (That's a joke, but they do work well.) 
They're cheap and easy to find around here, and I expect 
they would  be elsewhere.  




Thanks in advance.

America Online has an online, live Brewing discussion the 2nd Thursday
of every month. Participants include knowledgeable folks from
Sierra Nevada. I believe in July, the discussion turned to Wort
aeration. One of the participants from SN said they like to achieve
as high an oxygen saturation as they can - 100% if possible.
They use something called a fishtail which is basically a pipe
with a flattened end which they use to spray the wort into the
fermenters.

 >Subject: PU yeast
 
 >In my report on the Pilsner Urquell brewery, I noted that they
 were using three yeasts identified as D, H, and W... I have speculated on 
 this before;  I believe that there is only one strain in use, but it has a 
 tendency to mutate.  In order to avoid problems, the PU brewery grows up a 
 pitching slurry and labels it with a letter (for example, 'A').  They brew 
 beer from this yeast and attempt to maintain it as if it were a separate
 strain in the brewery during successive repitchings.
 
 I guess I missed this but if it was in the article, I probably mentally 
 voided the information because it sort of cancels out in a practical sense.  
 It would be futile for us to compare notes on "strains" considering that the 
 brewery is pretty much throwing darts.
 
 Thank you for clearing this up.

 >I'm not sure if all cream stouts or all sweet stouts have lactose in them,
 but since I've recently done a semi-sweet (demi-sec?) stout that turned out
 quite nicely, I can offer a bit of advice.  
 
 Having tasted this and several other sweet stouts at a CBS sponsored Stout 
 Seminar, I rather liked the beer and made one up for a party.
 
 However, not wanting to add another odd ingredient to my collection of never 
 to use again stuff, I sweetened mine with honey and the result was just what 
 I expected.
 
 My thinking was that honey ferments very slowly in the first place and with 
 ale yeast and in a cold fridge, it probably never will ferment out.
  
 Prior to kegging the stout, I poured two cups of honey (boiled to sterilize) 
 into the keg and filled and carbonated as usual.
 
 If I were to do it again, I would only use one cup of honey as it is a bit 
 too sweet for general consumption.  The first few sips are a taste explosion 
 but a little goes a long way.  It was made in May and I still have a couple 
 gallons left and it is as sweet as the day I keggged it.

 >Subject: WORT AERATION
 
 >  The dialogue concerning Jack Schmidling's wort aeration
 experiment continues on the digest.  I have E-mailed Jack directly
 concerning his experiment.  However I feel that misconceptions
 continue regarding the experiment so I feel compelled to bring my
 concerns up on the digest.
 
 My only concern is the misconception of the objective of the experiment but I 
 did learn a great deal from the objective discussions both private and public 
 and thank those who contributed.  
 
 I apologize for whatever share I may have had in the unpleasantness that 
 developed but simply offer it as a warning of what happens when personal 
 garbage is brought to a public forum.  It is all too easy to attack the 
 messenger and never get around to the message or so fog it that little else 
 is accomplished.
       
 >There are two ways to alter this experiment The first and
 most obvious is to make four full-scale batches (5-10 gallons?).
 The valid assumption can then be made that the experiment mimics
 the situation in the (home) brewery.
 
 Considering the objective, viz., the wonders of the airstone, I guess I will 
 fall back on anecdotal evidence.  There are only two variables, airstone and 
 whatever else one normally does to make good beer.  Anyone who has been 
 making good beer and tries the airstone, soon comes to a very practical 
 resolution.  If it improves things, he keeps doing it, if not he quits.  The 
 mail and posted comments indicate that most people quit.  So much for 
 science.

Subject: Blueberry Beer


Dave (drose`at`husc.harvard.edu) asks for recommendations for blueberry beers.
Since I made a blueberry beer recently, I thought I would respond. It had no
blueberry color and very little blueberry flavor. My recommendations:


   Make a *very light* base beer. Mine was way too dark/heavy. A light
   wheat beer might be nice. Even then the color will probably not come
   through (but the flavor might). Blueberries tend to have a reddish
   color in solution, and I think that will be the best you can hope
   for.


   Use lots of blueberries. I only used 5 lbs. of frozen blueberries in
   5 gallons and it wasn't nearly enough. I would use about 2-3 lbs. per
   gallon.


   Add fruit only to the secondary, so that flavors and aromas don't get
   scrubbed out by the vigorous fermentation. I did this, and it started
   a pretty good second fermentation due to the sugars in the
   blueberries.
   
   Using hand-picked blueberries, I would pasteurize them first, by
   heating to 165 F for 20 minutes.
   
   You may hate to do this, since you have nice fresh-picked blueberries
   and you would like the beer to have natural flavor, but you will
   probably be able to get a better blueberry flavor by using an
   extract. There are various ones on the market; some are probably
   better than others.


   Actually, my final recommendation would be to use a different fruit.
   I don't think that blueberries have that strong of a flavor, and it
   gets swamped by all the beer flavors.


Making a good blueberry beer *can* be done: I had a very good one put out by
some microbrewery that I tried at a recent GABF (Great American Beer Festival).
It had a straw color (not blue), but lots of blueberry flavor. My guess is
that they used an extract.


Good luck, I hope it comes out well...

After all the talk about extraction efficiency, and the at times
impolite ferver over pts*gals/lb vs. pts/lb/gal, and the fact that
I've just brewed my first all grain brew, I have written a simple
program to calculate the extraction efficiency of a mash/sparge.


It is cleverly called EXTRACTF and is available free.  I have 
executables for DOS, SGI Irix, and SunOS.  There is a short document
and an ASCII data file based on Bob Sweeney's post to HBD, sans Miller's
entries.  Sorry, no source. 


Maybe someone who is really willing to try it can contact me, then
tell the general HBD audience if it's worth the hassle of acquisition.

Subject: Chlorine, Yeast and My Septic Tank


Hey Everyone;


While this is not a brewing question in the strictist sense, it _is_
related.  All the various discussions about sanitizing have got me wondering.
We just bought a house that has a septic tank, and that is a first for us.
We are sanitizing everything with a weak bleach solution.  For most things,
I use 1 to 2 oz of bleach to 5 gallons of water.  For a few things (cleaning
old bottles) the solution is stronger.  Is all this bleach going down the
drain going to harm whatever magic occurs in the septic tank?  Could it be
offset by pouring the sediment from the first and secondary fermentations
down the drain, too?  (I think is was Heloise that had a hint once about
putting yeast in your septic tank occasionally.)  I have considered dumping
the bleach water in the washing machine as it is on a separate drain line
from the septic tank.  Do I need to (gasp) worry?


Thanks for any and all help.  Answers by email or here in the HBD are
appreciated.

Subject: carboy handles


Can anyone report an actual incident of a carboy handle causing a carboy to
break?  I know there are many cautions about using the carboy handles (the
plastic-coated metal loop handles) to lift full carboys, and I can imagine
that you could induce enough force, through careless use, to crack the neck
of the carboy.  But I've never heard of an actual failure, so I'm curious
what the actual level of risk might be.


Note: I'm not interested in "might be" or "obviously one can see that..."
or stress analyses or whatever.  Those are separate topics; I'm looking
for (preferably) first-hand or (at worst) second-hand reports of actual
failures, and any notable circumstances under which the failures occurred.

Subject: yeast


I like Darryl Richman's line of reasoning concerning the question of the
number of strains used by the Pilsner Urquell Brewery.  It seems in line
with what one might expect for conducting "low tech", low cost passage of a
brewing strain.  In support of this notion, an article by C. Rainbow of
Bass Charrington Ltd. (c. 1970) indicates that it is common practice, at
least in England, for brewers to limit the number of pitches (of a yeast
culture) to five.  He indicates that this is to limit contamination, which
is inevitable in the brewing environment, and to avoid what brewers
apparently refer to as "yeast weakness" (loss of desired properties
coinciding with an increase of mutants in the population.  So, it would
seem likely that the folks at PU hedge their bets a little to avoid costly
down time.


A quick comment on this posting:

This seems logical.  I also thought so until further investigation has
shown me that this isn't so.  Actually, the yeast don't go into respiration
mode until the amount of assimilable sugars runs out.  Yeast are constantly
in fermentation mode and the presence of glucose actually inhibits
respiration even when oxygen is present.  Jack's comment on the
reproduction mode is essentially correct.  Some yeast do reproduce via
fission, but you probably won't find this kind in your beer, maybe your
cider though.  Also, I don't think that this description of flocculation is
correct.  Anyway, I'm not sure why one really needs to aerate, though
apparently one does (?)  I think George Fix has said that it is required
for some process other than metabolism.


One final note, let's take a quick market survey concerning those desiring
Weihenstephan, before we push this thing further.  Who wants it? Can you
culture? and what would be your mailing address.  I will compile the
results so that they can be e-mailed to the people who would be culturing
it.  This would save some time and trouble and we could, presumably,
by-pass HBD postings.
