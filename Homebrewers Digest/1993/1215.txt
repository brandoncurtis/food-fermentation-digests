Subject: Wort Aeration


While I think it is a good idea to do experiments, one of the hardest parts is
interpreting them.  I have personally come across situations where people were
using Wyeast cultures without making starters and observing 48 hour lag times. 
While I normally advise making starters, I have twice helped people just 
really aerate the wort and see lag times reduce to half a day or so.  So 
clearly the amount of aeration of the wort can have an incredibly dramatic 
effect on the time required for the onset of fermentation.


For the more gadget-oriented among our community, something like an airstone 
can make the process much easier (I know people who have gravity-fed metal 
pipes going from a stainless brewpot from a keg to a stainless fermenter, with
no exposure to air along the way--something like this works well for them). 
For those of us with minimal equipment, it is obvious that there are easier 
ways to aerate the wort, at least to a sufficient level.


But there are so many variables involved.  For instance, if you are making a 
barley wine using an ale yeast and want to ensure sufficient oxygen available 
to the yeast you might just shake up the fermenter every day for a week or so. 
Or you might find it easier to have some sort of pump do the work for you.


Unfortunately, some people tend to either overenthusiastically adopt or reject
new approaches, which can make it more difficult for others to determine the 
usefulness for themselves.


IMHO, the bottom line is that most everyone I have brewed with, including 
myself, often underpitches the yeast and underoxygenates the wort.  But 
whether you sit down and shake up the fermenter or use a small metal tube with
holes drilled in it or a faucet aerator or an airstone with pump probably 
depends on your environment more than anything else.

Subject: doppelbock and fruit beers


Fermentating way in the "lagering chamber" is an OG 1085 doppelbock
(baumerator?)  Yeastlab Bavarian Lager is being used at 50 degrees F.
I am assuming this yeast is going to poop out with a reasonable amount
of sugars remaining due to the alcohol level.  If this is correct, then
how does one get carbonation when bottling a beer of this style?  Will
adding the typical priming sugar (1 cup dme) rejuvenate the yeast enough
to get some carbonation or are the yeast going to be killed off by the
alcohol level?  I won't be bottling this batch until October and don't want
to wait that long to find out if this will work or not.  Any advice would
be appreciated.


Fruit beers:  I've always ignored posts relating to fruit beers with the
attitude of why wreck perfectly good beer by adding fruit.  Well, my wife
and brother have convinced me to attempt a raspberry beer.  What I would
like to do is brew a large batch of wheat beer, then split off a few gallons
to experiment with fruit.  That way if I hate the fruit beer, at least I'll
have a batch of decent wheat beer for my efforts.  So now I'm looking for
advice on adding raspberries to a wheat beer.  From what little I've read,
it appears that adding raspberries to the secondary is one method.  If so,
how much and how do I prepare them?  Also, do I need to adjust the hopping
of the beer when adding fruit?  If so, less boiling, less finishing, or
what? Thanks in advance. 


BTW: I am experimenting with raspberries due to a ready supply in the
backyard, fighting the hops for space.  Anyone in the south bay area want
to swap for some homegrown Cascades.  I've got about half a pound more than
I figure to use in the next year.  email me if interested.

Subject: Canadian U-brews
Full-Name: Mark S. Hart


Salutations,


About 1 1/2 weeks ago I read this article in The Wall Street Journal by
Larry M. Greenberg.  The following is a condensation of that article.
I left out a lot of the quotes from patrons, the explanation of the brewing
process, etc. for brevity.


"It's another night at the U-brew.  What laundromats are to clothes, Canada's
U-brews are to the thirsty and heavily taxed.  Here, for about 90 Canadian
dollars, would-be brewmasters legally can whip up a 13 gallon batch of 
potent suds.


In place of commercial breweries' big buildings, elaborate plumbing and
computerized chillers, U-brews offer storefront or warehouse space, huge
metal pots, plastic tubs, lots of well used bottles, recipes and some 
know how.


Low tech perhaps, but low cost, too.  U-brews sidestep federal beer taxes
and most provencial taxes.  In a land where levies are huge (a six-pack of
domestic brew goes for the euquivalent of US $5.35) dodging the taxman is a
heady incentive for beer quaffers.


The first U-brew, started six years ago, in London, Ontario, with the idea
that beer lovers would be happy to rent equipment, make a mess away from
home and save money.  


A culture has grown at the U-brews, where friends gather, usually on week-
nights.  Most budding brewers say they start because of the savings - then
enjoy the camaraderie.


There's something of a party atmoshpere at the U-brews as friends get 
togethor to batch up some brew.  However, It's illegal to drink beer at a 
U-brew, a law perhaps honored as much in the breach as in the observance.


Employees at the U-brew will filter and carbonate the beer for customers
before patrons return to cap it on the shops bottling machine.  Some U-brews
even have a microscope to analyze yeast.  Some places are gussied up.  Many
are air-conditioned.  Polished wooden floors, copper cooking pots instead 
of stainless steel, and even hanging plants are found in upscale establish-
ments.  Others are more rudimentary, with cracked concrete floors.


The phenomenon hasn't caught on in the U.S., where beer prices are far lower
although Canadian investors recently opened one in Los Angeles, hopin that
aficionados may want to make exotic ales."


Has anyone out there in HBD land ever visited one of these places.  It seems
like a good idea, kind of like HBD put in person.  It could really help
the people who don't have the space or want to purchase equipment.  I would
be interested to hear the reviews of anyone who has visited/tried a U-brew.


Thanks, 


Mark.

I too am puzzled by the brewcap (I have 2 but use them simply as carboy
caps). Why would one want to invert the carboy? To drain the sedimented
yeast and hop remnants perhaps? What prevents the weight of beer from
popping the cap off when the carboy is inverted? Any advice on use of this
item will be appreciated.

Pale malt is fine.  In a recent conversation I had with
Mary Ann Grueber from Breiss Malting, she said that Klages
is virtually non-existent these days and has been largely 
replaced with Harrington, but there is not any discernable 
difference in brewing qualities.  Klages and Harrington 
are both pale malts, BTW, so you most likely got Harrington.


Liberty, OTOH, is nothing at all like Willamette.  Liberty
was bred as a domestic replacement for Hallertau Mittelfruh
(virtual umlaut over the u), the classic "noble" aroma hop
from Germany.  If you can't find Liberty (or real German
Hallertau Mittelfruh or Hersbrucker), then good substitutes
are either Mt. Hood or a new hop just released called "Crystal"
Crystal used to be known in the trade as CFJ-Hallertau and like
Liberty and Mt. Hood were bred as Hallertauer replacements.
Also note the domestic "Hallertau" is not very close to the real
thing:  The three that I have mentioned are much, much better.
And of course the real thing (Hallertau) is still the best, but
more costly.


FYI, Willamette is very similar to Fuggles (from which it was 
bred) but has a slightly more spicy note than Fuggles.  In general
you can interchange the two.

Subject: Cheap Corny Kegs


I recently posted a request for info about a source of cheap kegs, and I
was swamped with mail asking me to share what I found out.  Well,
here it is.
   I got several responses suggesting DeFalco's of Houston, Texas.
They sell used pin-lock kegs for $15 ea, or 3 for $35, plus shipping.
I also got several responses saying that The Beverage Co. of Anderson,
California has used ball-lock kegs for $22 each or pin-lock kegs for
$17 each, and that several people had gotten these with no problems.
In both cases, the kegs come "as-is" from the soda distributor, still
have pressure in them and therefore are assumed air-tight, and also
have residual soda syrup in them.
   Well, I ordered 3 from DeFalco's, which cost me $35, + $15 shipping,
+ $6 for three new lid o-rings.  They arrived in about a week via UPS,
all shrink-wrapped together.  They were in good shape, no dents or dings,
but with some label scum and REEKING of Coke syrup. They all say "PROPERTY
OF THE COCA_COLA COMPANY", but I assume they were procured legally :).
I have rinsed them several times and replaced the o-rings, and the smell is
almost gone.  Hopefully it will not show up in my first kegged brew.
   I bought a regulator at Steinbart's in Portland for $39, and all the
connecting hardware for another $30.   I got a 5 lb. CO2 bottle at a local
welding supply shop for $65 (permanent lease) and $7.70 for the CO2.
The interesting part came when I took it home and hooked it up. The gas
bottle sputtered and coughed, lost pressure quickly, and smelled like
putrid, skunky beer.  I took it back to the welding shop, and they emptied
it and found a cup or two of skunky beer in it, and naturally said, "Gee,
I've never seen that happen before".  Apparently the the previous user had
run it dry, and beer had backstreamed into the gas bottle.  Lesson of the day
is: (1) don't run your bottle dry and leave it connected, and (2) have check
valves in your gas lines.  Got a new bottle and I'm ready to go.
     The number for DeFalco's is (713) 523-8154.  I don't have the number for
the Beverage Co. handy, but it's in the Celebrator Beer News classifieds.
Standard disclaimers apply.

A simple question that I have regarding mash tun design.
If you use the single or multiple copper pipe manifold arrangement
for either a round or rectangular picninc cooler, don't you have a
lot of dead space (between and under the pipes) 
for which a uniform mash temperature would not be possible
by stirring or otherwise?

Subject: Re: Tun size/Klages/Liberty/Fridge Conversion


There have been a few questions regarding tun size and also a mention or
two about grain depth.  I've read (forget which book) that the ideal grain
depth is 12 to 18 inches.  Now, before everyone starts redesigning their
laeuter tuns, I'm willing to bet that the ideal grain bed depth is highly
dependent on the type of false bottom or slotted-pipe or easymasher pipe
that you have in the bottom.  In professional systems, there are debates
raging about whether round holes or slots are better and the cross-sectional
shape of the holes is debated also.  So, I'm just relaying what I've read
but if you record the depth of the grain bed on several batches of various
size (which is what I'll be doing from now on) perhaps we can get enough
data to make some general rules about grain depth versus efficiency, no?

Klages is a 2-row barley strain that *used* to be grown in the U.S.  It's
replacement is called Harrington.  Basically, what you wanted was a good
2-row Pale malt.  Liberty is a U.S.-grown variety that was selected because
it had qualities similar to Hallertauer Mittelfruh.  If you can't get
Liberty, Mt. Hood is a close cousin or you could use any number of German-,
U.S.- or British Columbian-grown Hallertauer hops.

Subject: resend of yeast faq 1 of 8 (keeping my fingers crossed)


Sorry about the first post of this section: sometimes our mailer acts up!


   Hi to all fellow homebrewers. This is the updated, revised and expanded
version of my recent Yeast FAQ. Almost all of this data was plagiarized from
somewhere by me or others; however, I have not knowingly used any copyrighted
stuff. (I was very careful *not* to check anything for a copyright ;-).) I have
altered the focus of some documents to more accurately reflect what I feel to be
the interests of the *home*brewer. Some of the information is very basic; some,
more technical. I have tried to give a basic introduction to what yeast are, how
they affect beer taste, and the proper handling of yeast. Some portions of the
following were taken from the Wyeast information circular e-mailed to me by
David Adams; the sections pertaining to yeast culturing are adapted from an
upcoming book by Dr. Fix. Dr. Fix also provided the section on the proper method
of yeast rehydration. Most of the information on the "reputations" of the many
yeast strains was collected from the HBD over the years by Doug O'Brien. Many
thanks to David Adams, Dr. George Fix, and Doug O'Brien. I would also like to
thank Al Korzonas for his helpful suggestions on the characteristics of some
yeast strains and for his comments and help in clarifying the sections on
propagation and culturing. Thanks also to the many people who made small
suggestions or requests for clarification. My name is Patrick Weix, and I am a
graduate student in the Genetics and Development program at UT Southwestern at
Dallas <weix`at`swmed.edu>. I hope you find this document useful.


N.B. This document is composed of rampant hearsay and rumor. Any attempts to pin
anything on me or my co-conspirators will be resisted. If all else fails I will
call your boss and ask him why you are reading the HBD at work instead of
grinding out the Fitzsimmons contract. What do they pay you for anyway? Don't
you have anything better to do?...


============================================================================


INTRODUCTION


   Yeast are unicellular fungi. Most brewing yeast belong to the genus
Saccharomyces. Ale yeast are S. cerevisiae, and lager yeast are S. uvarum
(formerly carlsbergerensis). Another type of yeast you may hear mentioned,
usually in conjunction with weizens, is S. delbrueckii. You may ask, "If all 
ale or lager yeast are the same species, why all the fuss?" The fuss is over
strain variation. All dogs are the same species, yet no one will ever mistake a
Basset Hound for a Doberman (at least not twice :-). Using different strains can
add fun and spice to brewing, especially if you have some idea of the
differences. I originally put together this guide to catalogue the different
affects of different strains. This information is in Section II. Section I
outlines the general characteristics of brewing yeast and tries to answer some
of the more frequently asked questions about yeast that seem to cycle onto the
HBD. Section III explains how the homebrewer can culture and maintain yeast
strains in the safety and comfort of his/her own home.

Subject: degree of extract


Hi all,


This is my second post to this digest and I meant to include in my first 
posting a "Thank you all" for all the great information I've absorbed 
while watching from the sidelines...."Thank you all". :)
That said, on to the matter at hand.  


In the May/June issue of Brewing Techniques, "Spreadsheet for Recipe 
Design" article, Mr. King shows a column in the spreadsheet labeled Deg 
of Extract. Below this are numbers corresponding to various grains and 
their respective extraction (rates?).
Eg:
                DEG OF
                EXTRACT
- --------------------------.....
PALE MALT         27
WHEAT             25
etc...            .
                  .
                  .


I checked my only two references (TCJoH,TCHoH) and didn't see anything 
that indicated where these numbers came from. Is this something I need 
to generate myself, ie. make 1 gallon batches with 1 pound of grain and 
check the gravity? Or are the numbers listed fairly standard and for use 
in calculations?
I always thought the degree of extraction was dependent on the quality 
of grain, quality of crush, mashing efficiency, etc. and would vary.


Can someone please clarify this? Thanks.

I guess this is a viable alternative commonly employed by researchers. It
is mentioned in a section on S.cervesiae research techniques, co-authored
by Richard Wobbe of Harvard Medical School, in Current Protocols in
Molecular Biology.  It looks like a pretty easy and inexpensive way to mail
strains, though as Dave points out, it has some drawbacks for the home
culturer.  As long as the recipient has the means to revive the strain, it
may be worth a try.  My only concern is that this procedure may select
against certain strains present in a multistrain culture.  This is a good
piece of information, though, and some people may be interested in trying
it out.

We're talking two forms of reproduction here: asexual, achieved by means of
either fission or budding and sexual, involving a mating, of sorts,
resulting in an exchange of genetic material and the subsequent
reassortment of this genetic material to produce spores (more or less). 
Fission and budding are two different means of achieving the same end: 
production of two genetically identical cells, where previously there was
only one.  I can't give you the mechanics of this at the moment, but both
processes are distinct from one another.  Forgive the use of taxonomy, but
Sacchromyces bud, whereas, for example, Schizosacchromyces undergo fission.
 Neither is an explanation of flocculation.  To my understanding, the
ability to flocculate is incumbent upon the ability to reassociate (or
aggregate) once growth begins to slow.  Perhaps Dave Rose can explain this
more thoroughly.  Whether beer yeasts can sporulate...well your guess is as
good as mine:  some lab strains of S. cervesiae can.

Subject: pronunciation of trub


In hbd 1210 Al Korz etc. lists the pronunciation of many brewing terms.
I for one have never liked the pronunciation troob for trub.  It is 
such a fruity word.  Thankfully, it is also incorrect.  While Websters
unabridged dictionary lists the pronunciation as troob or the rugged
trub, both are incorrect if one uses the German pronunciation.  There
is still doubt as Websters gave two spellings, trub and trueb as
the German speelling for the word meaning dirt or haze or whatever.
These would be pronounced approximately troop and trip.

Subject: Nigerian Guinness




FYI, from the August 21, 1993 issue of The Economist (in a survey of
Nigeria):


"Guinness, for example, has developed a stout brewed from malt extracted
from millet and sorghum, because of the [Nigerian] government's import ban
on barley malt. It looks the same, tastes different, and has been a smash,
helping make Nigeria Guinness's third-biggest market, after Ireland and
Britain."


I guess necessity is the mother of invention. Anybody ever tasted Nigerian
Guiness or brewed with millet malt? Inquiring minds want to know!

Subject: green chile beer again (notes on Coopersmith's "Sigda's")


A late addition to the chile-in-beer discussion, but I got some recipe-
like info.  A couple of folks had already mentioned Coopersmith's in Ft
Collins, CO, which makes "Sigda's Green Chili [sic] Beer".


I think Sigda's is an excellent beer.  The chile and beer flavors blend
nicely.  It's got just the right amount of bite--not enough to hurt, nor to
make it the sole province of chile aficionados, but definitely enough to
leave no doubt that it's a chile beer.  More importantly, it's got a real
character of the chiles.  Compared to Cave Creek, I'd take this any day.


The basic recipe is a pale ale, only light malt (no crystal, etc.), and
lightly hopped.  Ummm, lessee...they're using English malts.  Mash is a
single infusion; don't remember temperatures.


During fermentation, they add chopped green chiles of the sort folks
commonly call "Anaheim".  (They get them frozen in bulk.)  They use 20 lb
"mild" and 30 lb "hot" in an 8 bbl batch.  Keep in mind that the "mild" and
"hot" here are relative to Anaheims, which are all down toward the mild end
of the scale.  The chiles are in hop bags in the fermenter.  Anyway, that's
just for the fermentation...when they transfer to the aging/serving tank,
they remove the Anaheims and add 2 lb of chopped serranos for the aging
period.  This beer is served in-house only, directly from the aging tanks.
That is, none of it is bottled, although you can buy it by the jug to take
home.  It's rather cloudy; they don't make much of an attempt to clarify
it.  (They fine, but don't filter, their beers.)


Just for perspective--since the 8 bbl batch size is a bit awkward for home
brewing:-):  It's about equivalent to a pound of Anaheims and somewhat over
half an ounce of serranos for a five-gallon batch.  (Remember, the weights
refer to prepared [peeled/seeded] chiles.)


It would be interesting to see whether a beer like Sigda's could be bottled
and kept for a while.  I have my doubts; I suspect that the chile taste
would fade or mutate somehow.  I'd also guess that if it could be success-
fully fined or filtered, you'd lose a lot of the character.


[and while I'm at it, a plug: If you have occasion to pass through Ft
Collins, Coopersmith's is well worth a visit.  In addition to the chile
beer (which seems to be regularly available) they'll have half a dozen
others on tap, including some unusual ones:  I caught the tail end of their
raspberry ale today.  There was a blueberry wheat beer in a fermenter so I
suspect that will be available in another two or three weeks.  They'll
also give you a tour of the brewery by someone knowledgable if you're there
on a Saturday afternoon.
I hate to admit it...Ft Collins and Boulder are similar-size towns with four
breweries each, but Ft Collins brews easily win on variety and interest.]

Subject: molds on yeast plates: a solution


A while back, when I was away on vacation, there was a discussion of mold
contamination of yeast plate cultures. Since there hasn't been a definitive
solution yet (I'm not quite caught up though), let me suggest what we resort
to for the protection of plates that must be kept open for long period in our
lab:


>From 0.5 to 1% sodium propionate in the medium will suppress practically all
molds, without affecting the growth or viability of yeasts. The propionate
can be either added before autoclaving, in which case the medium will turn
cloudy, or as a sterile solution just before pouring the plates, in which
case the medium will stay clear. There is no growth difference in either
case.


While not reinheitgebotmaessig, propionate is FDA-(or USDA-?)approved to
prevent molds on foodstuffs.

Subject: Malts for Vienna/Octoberfest/Marzen


I just read George and Laurie Fix's book 'Marzen/Oktoberfest/Vienna' and I
recommend it to any other 'Fest beer fans out there.  In the recipes,
though, they call for "German Light Crystal Malt, German Dark Crystal
Malt and English (20 and 120 degree) Caramel Malt".  Our local club is
making a large buy of De Wolf-Cosyns Belgian Malts and am wondering how
their Cara-Vienne and Cara-Munich could substitute for the German light
and dark crystal.  Any other good and available malts that would make a
good substitution?  Also, how about using all Munich Malt as the base of
a 'Fest?  What hop(s) and how much are preferred for this style?  Any
other helpful comments on making a championship 'Fest?  TIA

Hello again brewers,
Without even waiting for an answer to my previous question about
brewcaps, I going to ask a second:
Does anyone out there have a copy of Rodney Morris' RIMS article 
from the Maltose Falcon news letter? And if so, would they also
happen to have an "electronic" version they could send me?
I've read the rims summary from sierra.stanford.edu, but
unfortunately all the brewers who submitted their designs,
described the differences between their setups and Morris'.
Hence, I'm still in the dark as to the exact setup.


ALTERNATIVELY, is there a more internationally available source
of such a full description?


Happy brewing, Rob. Thomas.

>Rob Thomas.


The 2-3 advantages (perhaps there are more)  of this system are: 


1.  Since the carboy is placed upside down, you can drain off
      the trub as it settles in the neck of the carboy.  


2.  You can collect the spent yeast in the same manner.  Thus, 
      you can proceed with secondary fermentation in the same 
      carboy & avoid having to rack to another (avoiding possible
      contamination & oxidation).


3.  The collected yeast can be captured in a reasonably sanitary
      manner & repitched if you keep it clean & healthy.


The disadvantages that I'm aware of are:


1.  Forget lagers unless you have a walk-in refer - since the carboy
      must be  upside down, it must be mounted on a stand of
      some sort therefore the whole mess will be too tall to fit
      in a refer.


2.  SInce the cap is on the bottom, it seems difficult to dry hop
       or add finings (although I think the manufacturer gives some
       info on how to do this).


3.  Although small (probably) there is a risk that if the blow-off
       tubes get clogged, since the cap can't pop off, the carboy
       may burst.

Subject: the beauty of labels


visual presentation is a part of beer as it is of any other food. that is why
we all get so excited when we hit the right shade of amber or just a tint of
red, or whatever turns you on. labels are part of the presentation of beer. 
so what if it takes a bit longer to prepare bottles, it is part of the process.
you'll feel better when you present a bottle that looks as nice as the beer in
it tastes.


on a technical note, if you have registration problems with labels prepared on
a word processor, use a drawing or publishing program. these pay much more 
attention to dimensions than word processors, which tend to stretch things to
fit the text. publishers also make graphics, border text etc easier to manage.


i say don't be content with writing the name of your beer on the bottle. make
something worth the pain of cleaning labels off bottles.

Subject: Lagering Room


 
 Although I like my new "lagering room" (chest freezer/Airstat) a lot and I 
 probably will never make ale again,  there was one problem that was bugging 
 me.
 
 The 40F low end temp should be adequate for fermenting and serving beer but 
 it just never seemed quite cold enough without using pre-chilled glasses.
 
 After doing a little judicious temp measuring, I learned that the air 
 temperature varies from 5 to 10 degrees above the actual beer temp.  To 
 determine your own delta, put a thermometer in a glass containing a pint or 
 more of water and watch it for a few days.
 
 I dug up the article by Mike Kenny on modifying the Hunter for lower temps 
 and decided to give it a try.  Upon opening the unit, I "discovered" a temp 
 cal pot but found this had only about a two degree range and it was already 
 in the middle of that.
 
 Mike explains how to calculate (Ohms Law) the exact resistance for any temp, 
 along with adding a switch to disable the mod.  I took the Schmidling way and 
 simply soldered a 150K resistor across the sensor lead terminals and got 
 lucky.  When programmed for 40F, the temp in the pint of water is exactly 40F 
 now.  The air temp is about 35F but I just ignore that and the beer temp is 
 just the way I like it.
 
 It is a very simple mod and requires nothing more than removing two screws 
 and soldering the resistor to very accessible terminals.  Getting it back 
 together takes a little "feel" because the battery terminals have to be 
 fitted back into their connector but anyone with a little more finesse than a 
 gorilla should be able to do it.
 
 Thanks Mike.    (mkenny`at`bcm1g01.attmail.com   for details)

Hello All!


With Fall just around the corner, thoughts have been turning toward brewing
up some holiday brews.  I wanted to check with all my fellow brewers to see
if anyone has had any experiences with choosing the appropriate forms of spices
to include in batches.  For example, is it better to use whole cloves or ground
cloves, anise seed or anise extract?  I'm interested in using most of the easily
available spices (Anise, Cardimon, Cinnamon, Clove, Ginger, & Nutmeg come
immediately to mind).


I'd also be interested in suggested amounts of various spices to start with.
I'll probably turn a quick 2.5 gal trial batch within the next week and then 
move up to 5 gals.


Thanks in advance for your help!  If I get alot of responses, I'll catalog
the responses and post them.

Here's an interesting little recipe I tried recently with pretty good results:


                        Brown Ale Bananas Foster


3/4 lb British crystal malt - 20 Lovibond
6 lbs Pale 6-row
3 oz Southern Country New Orleans Bananas Foster mix*
1/4 lb Chocolate malt
1/2 cup Grandma's mild molasses


*- includes brown sugar, sugar, spice, natural and artificial flavoring:
(orange, lemon, banana, rum flavor, food starch modified and malto dextrin)
caramel color, silicon dioxide


1 oz Kent Goldings plugs (4.7% alpha) - 60 min in boil
1 oz Kent Goldings plugs (4.7% alpha) - 5 min in boil


2 tablespoons Irish Moss - 15 min in boil


Wyeast #1007 (German Ale) -  repitched 11 teaspoons slurry


Mashed all grains in 2.5 gal of 156 water for 90 min (w/ 1/2 tsp gypsum),
sparged with 4.5 gal of 170 water (w/ 1/2 tsp gypsum), added molasses and
Bananas Foster mix and boiled 75 min. (the brewpot smelled like rum and fruit
while it was boiling, something like a fruitcake).  Chilled wort with immersion
chiller for 10-15 min., racked to carboy and pitched yeast.  Left beer in
primary four days at around 70 degrees, then racked to secondary and added 1/2
oz of gelatin finings and kegged three days later using forced carbonation.


Original gravity - 1.042 (78.4% extraction efficiency; if yours is generally
different adjust the recipe accordingly)
Final gravity - 1.009
Alcohol: 3.4% by weight, 4.2% by volume
Color Units/Gal - 25.6 (using calculation described by Dave Miller in Brewing
the World's Great Beers)


I have made a few previous brown ales but this was absolutely the best.  My
experience with commercial brown ales is limited to Newcastle and I'm not one
of its biggest fans--no flavor to speak of, IMO.  This concoction on the other
hand has flavor to spare plus a unique and to my mind wonderful aroma, kind of
a caramel/toffee/rum combination.  Its great even at room temp.
As always, brewer beware, your taste may vary.
