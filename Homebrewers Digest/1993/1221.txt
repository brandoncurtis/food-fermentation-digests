Subject: trub,trueb,treber and all that.


Hello all,
now that we can all approximate the u umlaut (ue) sound, and
incorporate it in the word trub, I ought to point out something
that I discovered last night while reading a german book on
brewing (by Narziss, aka Gott). The german word that means the same
as the English word trub is TRUB. There is NO umlaut! 
There is a word Trueb or Trueber which means cloudy, but that isn't
the word used by brewers. There is also Treber, which translates as
draff (ie the grains after sparging).
Hence, the pronunciation is trub, with a germanic t and u, if anyone
really wants to speak English with a German accent (after all, we
call Muenchen Munich, so why should we call trub trub?).
I hope this clarifies things for you all, I've certainly given up.
Rob T.

Subject: legality of homebrewing in germany


Hello all again,
Here's just a quick question that hopefully someone can answer:
Is homebrewing generally allowed in Germany?
I had heard that selling books on how to brew were illegal,
but that brewing (home) wasn't. I'm getting more interested in
this problem since it's not beyond the realms of possibility that
I'll be moving there in 4 or 5 years time.
Any german subscibers out there?
Rob. T.
p.s. things are slowly improving in Switzerland: you can now
buy those BrewKing brew bags in some supermarkets. A long way to
go I know, but they're getting there. (I speak as someone who gets
maximum three types of malt straight from Huerlimann [that umlaut again])

Subject: Dry hopping induces new fermentation???


I have been reading an old book on brewing: _Brewing_, A.
Chaston Chapman (President of the Institute of Brewing, Fellow of the
Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland, Fellow of the
Chemical Society), Cambridge University Press, 1912.


In it, the author states "It had long been known that the addition of
a small quantity of fresh hops to beer in cask was usually followed by
an outburst of fermentation, a fact which did not receive an adequate
explanation until Brown and Morris showd that like most plants they
contain diastase, which, of course, converts some of the malto-dextrin
present into readily fermentable maltose." (p. 54)

The fish tank ones don't have a wide enough range.  I found some
reptile thermometer strips that go from about 50 to 100 (F), which is
fine for ales.  I've alse seen ones apparently designed for brewing
with an even better range; maybe this is what Sheaf & Vine is selling?

Subject: Treating glass carboys...


Hello,
     I have a friend who can get glass carboys from where he
works.  The catch is that they get them in full of Sulfuric acid.
After they've used the acid he can take the carboy home.  Question:
how should I treat the carboy before using it for brewing?  It's been
suggested to used backing soda to neutralize the acid.  Will that
work?  TIA

Actually, the beer one (I haven't checked who makes it) that I picked
up to replace the one that was unsucessfully peeled from the aquarium
doesn't have much more of a range than the fishtank ones.  I can't
remember if the low end goes down to the 50's but the high end is
not above 85 I'm sure.

Subject: H(ot) S(ide) A(eration)?


As I mentioned in an earlier note, I've been reading _Brewing_,
published in 1912.  The author is President of the Institute of
Brewing, etc., etc., so I presume he's good for the current (1912)
understanding of brewing processes.


In the discussion of cooling (p. 66) he talks about "coolers", or long
shallow pans in which the wort cools by exposure to ambient air, and
(the relatively new-fangled) "refrigerators", which actively chill the
wort by running it over or around tubes filled with a cold liquid. 
He then says (emphasis mine) "Certain of the constituents of the wort have the
property of absorbing oxygen from the air at tolerably high
temperatures, and this `hot aeration' as it is called, to distinguish
it from the cold aeration or absorption of oxygen by the cold wort
while passing over the refrigerator, is *very generally regarded as
beneficial*.  It is true that some authorities have questioned its
importance, but I think there is a general consensus of opinion that
these more or less obscure oxidation changes are *desirable* and that
they do exert an appreciable effect on the brightening capacity of the
finished beer."


Now, clearly brewing science has advanced since 1912, and it seems to
be now generally accepted that HSA is bad for the flavor.  But it's
interesting to see how accepted practice changes...

Subject: seasonal ales: dryhopping with spices




        I'm hopping (hoping) to get some feedback on the following:
Am considering a Thanksgiving-type ale that would involve the addition of
some pumpkin pie spice (allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.).  My question(s)
is, has anyone tried this before, (i.e., dryhopping with this stuff)? 
Should I do this after initial fermentation has terminated?  Should I do
this in conjunction with some aromatic hops?  If so, what kind and how
much?  About how much of this pumpkin pie spice should be added for 5
gals?  I'm really just after the aroma of pumpkin pie and am not
interested in altering the flavor toooo much.  Hope there's someone out
there that's played with this kind of thing before.  I would appreciate
any and all feedback on this and can be e-mailed directly at
mstewart`at`unssun.unr.edu. Thanks much,


Mark
(p.s., am considering using a brown ale recipe that I've made in the past
and the pumpkin pie spice I saw was Schilling brand).

Subject: Stainless Steel and Chlorine


In the recent post by Ed Hitchcock, he mentioned the current HBD wisdom of not
using Bleach (chlorine) in Stainless Steel kegs and the current interest in
iodine.  While I would like to know exactly what the Cole Parmer catalog was
refering to with NO EFFECT, it may not pertain to what I am relating here.


Being a metallurgist, (i have a feeling that most of us are college grads of
one form or another, using the convienient computer systems at work,{:o ) I
checked out the Metals Handbook Vol. 13- Corrosion, on Chlorine and Stainless
and here is what I found.


Chlorine (aqueous) is highly corrosive to austenitic stainless steels, which
includes the 304 alloy most commonly used for Food Grade containers. The
mechanism of corrosion homebrewers mostly have to be concerned with is Pitting
Corrosion.  This is caused by localized concentration of chlorine ions.  Those
ions become concentrated by evaporation of water containing chlorine.  The
corrosion is manifested as tiny pits which, due to increased relative
concentration of the chlorine in the pit to the surrounding environment,
quickly put pinholes in your tanks.


To prevent this type of corrosion, the key is good rinsing of the bleach water
from the steel.  First off, let me say that the 1+ tablespoon bleach per gallon
(4ml/liter) is not much in the context of the industrial corrosion that the
Metals Handbook is written to.  Most of what I read dealt with continuous flow
through pipes, etc.  Anyway, If you rinse with warm boiled water until you
don't really smell it, and then prevent water droplets on the sides by either
filling the keg with beer or drying them out with a towel, you will not have
the localized concentration necessary to induce pitting.


One other thing that can be done with Stainless Steel is passivation.  A 20% by
volume solution of (HNO3) Nitric Acid will ensure a uniform oxide film which
will prevent the localized concentration/activity difference which initiates
this form of galvanic corrosion.  But I don't think this should be necessary.


While I am discussing stainless steel, I have a word of caution for those of
you get stainless steel tanks welded with fittings.  There is a
time`at`temperature range (800-1600F) for austenitic stainless that results in
Sensitization.  This term is used to describe a precipitation of chromium
carbides away from the grain boundaries which results in intergranular
corrosion and brittleness.  You can practically snap it with your hands. This
is a common problem in welding of 304 stainless where the weld zone should be
cooled below 1100F within five minutes or the precipitation will start to
occur.  This also means that heat between 1100-1600F for more than five minutes
should be avoided ie weld time.  If any of you are noticing leaking or cracking
around your fittings, this is what has happened.  The only way to fix it is to
anneal the whole thing at roughly 1950F for 5min/.1inch section size followed
by fairly rapid cooling to avoid Sensitizing it all over again.  By the way,
304L (L for less carbon) does not usually have this problem, nor does 316L or
321.


Hope this wasn't too longwinded.

Subject: My first all grain batch - a screw up.


Message:
Well, I attempted my first all grain batch this past weekend.  Using 
a rectangular picnic cooler with a copper t'd manifold for mashing 
and sparging.  Picnic cooler is a 10 gallon.  Mashed 6lbs highly 
modified pale malt and 8 oz crystal with 6 quarts of 168F water for 1 
hour.  Did the iodine test.  The color was blackish but it turned to 
clear when I stirred it up a bit.  Here's the part I think I screw'd 
up.  When sparging with 3 gallons of 170F water, I had a very 
difficult time of not disturbing the grain bed.  Most of the time it 
was very turbulent.  Anyways, the OG ended up being 1.024!!!! I 
quickly went to the fridge and pounded a couple of homebrews, yeast 
and all!  Here's my question... how important is it that the grain 
bed is kept relatively undisturbed while sparging?  Also, will the 
liquid turn colorless near the end of the sparge.  Mine didn't.  
How do you add 3 gallons of 170F sparge water without disturbing the 
grain bed?  Could it be that my cooler is too large, ie the grain bed 
is not deep enough?  I decided to ferment it anyways.  I'd love to 
give this another shot this weekend.  Greg.

Subject: (SNPA) Clone. Was re:SN Stout Request


I'm having trouble posting to rec.crafts.brewing so hopefully
this will satisfy most of the recent email requests for this
recipie.


- -- Included File --
OK - I know, I know... the response I posted was for Sierra Nevada
Pale Ale NOT the Stout!!! But someone used SNPA - that means 
PALE ALE... well anyway... I got lots of request for the recipie so
here it is:


6.6# light malt extract
 .5# Laaglander DME
12oz Belgian Cara-Vienna 22L
8oz Belgian Cara-Pils 7L
1oz Perle pellet 7.1AA 60min
 .5oz Cascade pellet 5.5AA 30min
 .5oz Cascade pellet 5.5AA 15min
1oz Cascade whole 5.7AA dry hop
1tsp Irish Moss 15min
Wyeast 1056 American Ale


OG = 1050
FG = 1013


Brewing Notes:
Do a full boil (60 min).
Hop rates are based on a 5 gallon boil so if you boil less then
increase the hop rate to compensate.
Crush then steep the grains until ~170 deg, then remove.
Wort was chilled to 68deg before pitching.
Once the grains are removed, shut off the heat and add all of the
extracts. This will avoid scorching the extracts and darkening the
wort. Stir well then add heat and bring to a boil.


Add the dry hops in the secondary for around 5 days. When you rack
the beer to the bottling bucket, tie a sanitized hop bag to the end
of the hose or racking cane that goes into the bucket. This will
catch any stray hop bits that might get sucked into the racking
cane. In practice you wont get much if you use whole hops so you
can omit the bag if you'd like. If you hav'ent tried dry hopping I
encourage you to do so. The hop nose is fantastic and adds so much to
the character to the brew. I don't feel you will be able to match
it with normal finishing hops.


I have not had the chance to compare this to a real SNPA but people
tell me its very close. The OG  is a bit shy of the true mark which
is 1057 so I would increase the DME by maybe 1/2# to compensate.
The mouth feel is a bit heavy from what I remember so you may wish
to reduce the specialty grains somewhat. If your not sure then just
go with it the way it is. You won't be dissapointed.


enjoy!!


Would you believe, someone flamed me for not paying closer attention
to the title of the post I responded to then  - asked me for my SNPA
recipie ???? Sheesh... some people :-)

Subject: Re: Yeast FAQ Ruckus


Hi All,
Well, I feel that since my post was the cause of all the wasted bandwidth 
(either for the FAQ itself if you agree with JS or for the flame-fanning in 
response if you don't), that I should speak my piece. To JS's credit, he 
originally sent me the piece he went on to post about netiquette by e-mail 
a few days before it appeared in the HBD. At the time, I thought it was 
just a personal response, so I wrote him back explaining my reasons. I did 
not save my exact message, because I did not expect it to make its way into
the public forum, but I will repeat the main points here. The main 
reason that I feel compelled to "answer the charges" as it were is that I 
dislike the implication that I did not know what I was doing and 
furthermore didn't care. I reposted the whole mess because:


 1. It had undergone extensive revision. I change the intro, reformatted 
some of the general info sections and expanded others, updated the dry ale 
yeast data, expanded and changed the liquid ale yeast, expanded and changed 
the liquid lager yeast, updated some of the weizens, clarified some points 
in the rehydration section, cleaned up the section on culturing, and added 
two whole new sections. Just posting the changes would have meant a lot of 
work for me in separating them out, and tons of work for anyone who would 
try to make sense of the new info ((cut and paste)^3).
 2. I did not serialize it over several days because:
   a) the variable length of the queue makes it difficult to predict when 
something will come out, and
   b) the sections did not fit easily into 8k chunks, making it difficult 
to find good stopping points.
 3. As to fine-tuning it by e-mail, I had already been through many rounds 
of revisions and updates with every yeast expert who reacted/responded to 
the first message as well as many yeast novices who requested 
clarifications, simplifications, or expansions of key points.
 4. Given that I had changed it so much and desiring to avoid the infamous 
group think phenomenon, I decided RELUCTANTLY to submit the mess to the 
collective wisdom of the HBD for another rehashing/trashing.


The deciding point for me was the realization that at the end of one week, 
the digest would be at the same place whether I serialized or not.
Even with all the debacle, I am glad that I reposted because I have had 
several good responses to info in the updated version. Those hardy souls 
and I have communicated by e-mail, and I hope to have the mess ready for 
sierra by this weekend. Fear not, I shall not repost the beast again! 
  Finally, as for the results of his 10 to 1 poll, I would suggest that 
irritated people are 10 times more likely to respond than those who are 
satisfied, and that his was the only negative comment that I have received 
from anyone regarding either the value of the FAQ or the size. (That is not 
an invitation!!) I hope that no one else is discouraged from doing FAQs or 
information resources or whatever. It is a great way to learn about a 
subject and contribute to the art of homebrewing by computer all at once.
I do apologize for any inconvenience. If anyone needs to reach me, I am

Subject: All-grain questions


I went all grain several months ago and will never turn back.  However,
I've got some new problems. I'm sure you experienced all-grainers can help
me solve them.


  1)  I've had haze problems since I started mashing my own
  grains.  Not chill haze, rather ther beer never clarifies properly.
  I know the most likely source is uncoverted starches.  However, my
  mashes all passed the iodine test (sample taken from top of mash tun).
  Is there a better conversion test?  Is there another possible source for
  this haze?


  2)  Sparging questions:
    a) How much recirculation.  "Recirculate until runoff is clear".
    Sounds great in print.  However, for amber or darker beers this is
    not as obvious as is sounds.  In last batch I recirculated the first
    5 qts.  Is this excessive?
    b) When to stop sparging.  "Don't over sparge".  I like this about as
    much as "cook until done".  The three techniques I know of are 1)
    sparge until running reach certain gravity (1.010?), 2) Sparge until
    pH is too high ( > 5.5?), 3)  Sparge until boiler is full.  Both
    Miller and Papazian give mash & sparge water quantities, but the last
    time I used these my final runnings were 1.020, seemed wasteful.


  3) Seperating break material & spent hops from wort.  When I syphon my
    cooled wort from the boiler into the fermenter, my syphon tube clogs
    leaving 1/2 to 1 gallon of wort/trub in the boiler. I usually pore the
    last of this glog into mason jars, allow the trub to settle and decant
    the wort for use as starters.  One quart of glog doen't bother me but
    for my last triple I was left with nearly a gallon.  Again seems

Subject: Light struck beer


Cheers to Chris Campanelli and his Pizza and Beer FAQ.  I for one am 
looking forward to parts 2 through 29! Nothing like poking some fun at 
various flames that have been going on lately.  On to business.  I have 
been relagated to brewing outdoors since several years back I had a glass 
carboy explode in my bedroom closet (The saddest day of my life - superbowl 
stout exploded, taking out the carpet and most of the clothes in the 
closet).  Now I have recently gone back to glass fermenters, 6.5 gallon 
vice 5 gallon.  I was wondering when light struck beer begins to be a 
problem.  My recollection is that hop acid, when exposed to light, will 
impart a "Skunky" smell.  If so then even while fermenting you are capable 
of light damaging your beer.  Could anyone expound on this for me.  Do I 
need to keep my primary fermenter in a box (remember the closet is out!).
TIA.

Subject: Lager Brewing


In response to questions from Phil Brushaber regarding
lager fermentation:  I have been brewing lager beers
for many years and my experience has been better lagers
are brewed at cooler temperatures: I conduct primary
fermentation at 48F and secondary fermentation at
42F.  There is no question that fermentation at
these temperatures takes several months.  Once secondary
fermentation is completed, I typically lager my beers
at 32F-35F for three to four weeks.  An important point 
to be made is that during cold fermentation, a substantial
amount of CO2 dissolves into your beer.   
An excellent reference on this topic is "Brewing Lager Beers"

    I am curious if there are any good books on home brewing...
I would also like to hear of any important do's and do nots that I should
know about and how much time I need to invest in producing a small amount
of brew. 


    I would also like to hear from any people who have tried to market
their beer, their successes, failures, etc.  (personally e-mail me if you
can)

Subject: Re: True-bay


Although I thought the issue of trub pronunciation had died down, Jack stirred 
up an overwhelming sense of curiousity inside me.  So much, in fact, I just have
to ask one more question...
Where were these german speakers from?  It's possible that they said 'True-bay,'
as german has different dialects just as english does.  However, the word they 
are saying is clearly spelled 'truebe.'  It is an adjective form of our brewing 
word, trub, a noun (trueb in german), meaning dreary.  It is quite possible
that if these germans were unfamiliar with brewing, they could have related 
'dreary' with the weather, thus the German phase 'das truebe Wetter,' the dreary
weather.  Hence the clouds.
My arguement is simple.
In english it's trub (noun).  We have been trying to discover the pronunciation
of the german word Trueb (noun).  Your german friends appearantly were saying
truebe (an adjective).  Under nearly every case using the noun, it would be
spelled Trueb in German.  Therefore, I submit to you that the correct 
pronunciation of trueb as we use it in brewing would be closely approximated in 
english as "troop," if one remembers to keep the "oo" short.  Of course if you 
say trube (rhyming with tube), most american brewers will understand you.

Subject: RE: Old freezer chest


Wally,
     I have been using a 18 cubic foot chest freezer which was old when I
bought it for $40 23 years ago. I used it as a freezer until I purchased a
"William's" temperature controller 3 years ago. Now it is my brewchest. In
contrast to when it was a freezer, the motor is now off much of the time
since it only has to maintain 40 - 65!F instead of freezer temperature. I
monitor temperature with a dairy thermometer in a bottle of dilute chlorine,
and find my temperature fluctuations to be minimal. The chest probably
varies by 3 - 4 !F, but the mass of the beer fluctuates hardly at all. There
is no brand name on the chest, but I know it precedes the "frost-free" era
of freezers and refrigerators, and therefore does not possess the more
complicated temperature controls needed for the defrosting process. I theink
you're probably right in assuming that and old (preferably $40) freezer is
the best bet.

While we're on the subject of kegging...


Most of the kegging setups I've seen at shops have regulators on
the CO2 bottles with two "dials".  What do the two dials read?  Are
two necessary?  I don't want to skimp on the regulator, but I don't
want to buy something unnecessary.

Wally,    I have a chest freezer with a Honeywell temperature controller that
works just great. It turns the power to the freezer on or off. I set the
freezer control to coldest setting. I have used the freezer as high as 63 deg
for fermentation and as low as 40 deg for lagering. Much of the time it is
set at about 50 deg for serving, I have two taps on the lid! 


As far as the electric bill is concerned, I really don't know what it costs
me but I would think it would have to be less than it would be if I used the
freezer as a freezer since it is not keeping it as cold and I don't open it
often. My controller keeps the temperature within plus or minus 1.5 degrees
of where it is set for unless I leave the lid open for a long period of time.

Subject: RE:  Dry hopping; secondary fermentation.


Domenick asks about dry hopping. I use only whole hops for dry hopping in
the secondary (glass carboy). Hops pour in easily with paper funnel, float
near the top, and do not clog my siphon at bottling. There really is no
answer to the question about "typical reduction" in SG in the secondary
since this is a function of when you rack. With ale I rack on day 3 or 4
when the final SG has almost been reached. If I racked earlier, obviously
the SG would still be higher. With lagers brewed at lower temperatures
(50!F) I rack on day 5 or 6 and usually the SG will drop a few more points
in the 3 weeks before I bottle. I hope this helps.
