Here is a question for all you who have used the mini-kegs that are
becoming available:  Is it easy (or even possible) to purge the kegs
with CO2 when you are kegging?  Can you put the dispenser in the keg,
give it a gentle blast (talk about oxymorons) of CO2, and then fill?


Thanks in advance for your help!

Al Korz raises a good point about mashing.  One of the first books I read about
all-grain was from Dave Line, who is (was) admittedly one of the more relaxed
brewing authors around.  He did say more than once (I believe it was in "The
Big Book of Brewing") that once you hit a negative starch test you are _not_
done.  I guess he explained it a bit although I can't recall what his
explanation was.  Miller's explanation via Al seems right on the money:
ungelatinized starch which is undetected by the iodine test.  Maybe this is why
many professional brewers rely more on the mash time rather than a conversion
test.

  I was reading Bill Ridgely's post on Heather Ale in HBD #1222 and
was facinated by the description of this ale.  Anyway, It got me
thinking about books on beer and brewing, new and old.  Most of us
are familiar with the recent books for homebrewers, Miller, Papazian,
etc.  However, there are obviously a lot of other books out there.
I'm wondering about putting together some sort of annotated,
bibliography.  Any interest?  Send me you comments and citations.

  Was 168F your strike temperature, or the temperature of the mash?
168F is a little high for saccharification rest, you want a mash
temperature of roughly 150F-158F, depending on how much body is desired
in the finished beer.

  It's fairly important that the grain bed be disturbed as little as
possible once recirculation of the initial runoff is complete and a 
filter bed established.  If the grain bed is disturbed, the chances of
particulate matter such as small pieces of grain or husk getting into
the brewpot are increased.


>How do you add 3 gallons of 170F sparge water without disturbing the

  Try using something to diffuse the sparge water as you add it.  I mash
and sparge in a cylindrical cooler with a colander mounted on top.
You might try setting a bowl or plate upside down on the grain bed, and
pouring the water slowly onto the bottom of the plate.


>Also, will the

  The runoff will get lighter in color as the sparge progresses, but
it should not get colorless unless you oversparge.


>I'd love to give this another shot this weekend.  Greg


  Please do, and let us know how things worked out.

  Hmmm, just a hunch, but the fact that the iodine test passed after
mashing yet haze appears in the runoff leads me to believe that unconverted
starch is indeed the culprit, and that you have a filtration or sparging
problem.
  Check your grind, specifically the condition of the grain husks, they
should be intact or nearly so.  The more intact the grain husk, the better
filtration you will get in the lauter tun.  If the husks are excessively
torn or in small pieces, you need to grind a little coarser.  Your extraction
may suffer a little bit, but this is by far the lesser of the two evils,
IMHO.
  Another thing to check is the temperature of the grain bed itself.  I read
somewhere, in one of Miller's books I believe, that granules of unconverted
starch will burst when exposed to temperatures approaching 190F.  This
releases very fine particles of unconverted starch into the wort, which
are all but impossible to filter out in the tun.  Measure the temperature
of the grain bed, not the sparge water or water on top of the bed, and
keep it around 160F or so.

  Different lautering setups will require different amounts of recirculation,
so it's difficult to say whether a given amount of recirculation is
excessive or not.  I recirculate until the runoff is free of particulate
matter, usually 2 to 3 quarts.  The runoff is not crystal clear at this
point, but it begins to run clear shortly afterwards.
  I think the purpose of recirculation is to set up the filtration by the
grain bed, not to increase yields.  When the runoff is free of small chunks
of grain, you're there.  Of course, this is more difficult to determine
with dark beers.  When in doubt, I'll collect the runoff in a small glass,
and hold it up to the light.  This works for all but the darkest stouts.

  I use a combination of the hydrometer reading and my palate to determine
when to stop.  From experience, when I've collected 5 gallons of wort, I
start taking frequent gravity readings of the runoff.  When the gravity of
the runoff approaches 1.020, I start tasting the sample.  As soon as I detect
a taste like hot tea, I stop sparging.  With my equipment and procedures,
I'll have ~6.5 gallons collected at this point, and the gravity is ~1.010.
Your mileage may vary.
  The problem with oversparging is excessive tannin extraction from the
grain husks.  This is why I use my palate to determine when to stop.  IMHO,
numbers like gravity and pH will vary according to water supply, amount 
and type of grain used, etc., so it's risky to rely solely on these
measurements.

  Someone else posted this idea a while ago, I can't remember who, try
attaching a copper scouring pad to the end of your racking tube.  These
things are called "Chore Boys" in these parts, they have no soap in them,
are easily sanitized by a brief boil, and cool off enough to handle a few
seconds after removal from boiling water.  I set the end of the racking 
tube directly on the surface of the break material, they do a superb job
of filtering hops and trub, I get every drop of wort and have never had one
clog.


  Apologies for the lengthy post, I hope it helps.

Subject: Foaming when adding priming sugar


I've noticed, at bottling time, when I add my priming sugar to the beer
it tends to foam a bit.  Anyone else notice this or have a theory why?


My guess would be that it is an indication of how much CO2 is dissolved
in the beer -- the sugar somehow causes it to be released.  So
indirectly, it's an indication of how active the yeast in your beer
still are, and perhaps an indication of how well your beer will
carbonate.


BTW, I usually prime with 2/3 cup corn sugar dissolved in a few ounces
of hot water.

Greetings,
I am an extract brewer with about 10 batches under my belt. Mainly because
of time constraints, I don't think I'll be trying all-grain brewing for
quite some time, but I would like to expand my brewing horizons. Other than
brewing particular beers I haven't done before, are there any techniques
ingredients etc. that you more experienced brewers would suggest I try? The
only half-way unusual ingredient I've added yet was some milk sugar to a
stout which is now fermenting. This request may seem out of left field, but
I thank you in advance for humoring me and for any suggestions. 
Please respond by e-mail to :esonn1`at`cc.swarthmore.edu

2-dial systems usualy have 1 low pressure dial (0-70 PSI or so) and
one high-pressure dial (0-2000 PSI).  The high-pressure dial is the
pressure in your CO2 tank.  The low-pressure dial is the pressure
maintained in your keg.  I guess the only reason for having the high-
pressure dial is to help determine when your tank is nearly spent.

Glenn Anderson writes:
Homebrewers desiring the use of this gas should be aware that they
must use different regulators as the nitrogen is packed in under
higher pressure than CO2. CO2 is normally under 800LBS pressure and
CO2 gages normally top out somewhere around this. Nitrogen on the
other hand is usually under around 2100LBS and require the
appropriate regulator/gages.


To keep you from hooking up the low pressure CO2 regulator to the
beer mix and blowing your head off, the bottles come with a different
valve.  It's female, part number is CGA580.
*****************************


This is correct ONLY if you're filling your tank with 100% nitrogen
and that definitely doesn't work for dispensing beer(you will
eventually end up with flat beer because the CO2 in suspension will
leave the beer under a blanket of nitrogen). The nitrogen/CO2
mixture is under 1800 lbs pressure and beer dispensing regulators
are rated to be safe up to 2400 lbs(I called several regulator
distributers to be sure). Also no special value is needed for the
special Beer Mix of nitrogen/CO2.

I'm sorry, but I must disagree.  If you do the math first and then
choose your hose lengths/widths accordingly, you will not have overcarbonation.
You just must first choose the temperature and the number of volumes you
want in the beer and then choose the pressure, hose lengths, hose diameters
based on the formulas give in HBD back issues and in Dave Millers' very
good article in the 1992 AHA National Conference Proceedings.  If your
beer is overcarbonating, the pressure is too high or (as Jack pointed out)
the temperature may be higher than you think.


***********************************
I'm sorry but I disagree. You obviously have not had any kegs on tap
for any extended length of time to notice the gradual effect of CO2
absorbtion at cold temperatures (if you don't believe this can happen
then you don't believe in the concept of forced carbonation either).
I've been kegging for ten years now and I definitely talk from
experience. Also I was the one that gave formulas in HBD back issues
on calculating pressure, hose lengths/diameters. The calculations
work great if you drink you keg within a few weeks but if you have a
stout on tap that you only drink occasionally it will over time
absorb more CO2. The alternative is the nitrogen/CO2 gas mixture
which slows down the inevitable absorbtion considerably. Someone else
mentioned that all you had to do is turn off your CO2 tank and only
turn it on when the pressure got too low. This will work if you drink
the beer within a few weeks but it will still continue to absorb the
CO2 but at a slower rate than if the gas pressure were left on. I'm
lazy, I don't want to keep turning the gas on & off so I prefer the
nitrogen/CO2 mixture for dispensing. I could also solve this problem
by drinking alot more beer(this is tough with two kegs always on tap!)
but then I drink for quality flavor enjoyment not for quantity.

I don't think it is totally necessary to replace _all_ of the
gaskets in a soda keg.  I have one soda keg that I've used 3
or so times and the only gaskets I replaced was the lid o-ring 
and the poppet o-rings, for a total cost of less then $1.00.
Never had the taste of soda in _any_ brews dispensed from the
keg.  


The only time I'd suggest replacing more gaskets is if they are
leaking or you are extremely worried about soda flavor in your
brew.  In other words, Relax...


When you get a dirty keg, wash it out really well.  Put boiling
hot H20 with soap and shake it; let it sit over night.  Rinse.
Repeat, hook up the CO2 and dispense, etc.   One thing nice about
stainless is it cleans well.


As for a place to buy parts, I've done business w/ Foxx and BCI.

I was just reading Beer and Brewing Volume 8 yesterday and ran
across something in Dave Miller's talk.  I believe he said that
at the end of his sparge, he once tasted the runnings and they
tasted like tea (and looked like tea).  On his next batch, he
acidified his sparge water to 5.7pH with 88% Lactic acid (he said
it didn't take much) and on his following batch, the end of
the sparge was nearly colorless.


********************************************
Regarding Greg's low extraction (5 gal of 1024 from 10# of grain),
Miller said in the same talk that the iodine test is unreliable
and that because of it, some people mash out too early -- see my
hazy beer post in HBD 1222.


********************************************


Jeff writes he plans to dryhop his Christmas ale with 3-4oz of
Willamette pellets for 4-6 weeks.


I feel that you should save the pellets for boiling and get some
whole Willamette hops for dryhopping.   Whole hops will float and
thus it will be much easier to rack out from under them than with
pellets.  Also, 3-4 ounces is quite intense for a 5 gallon batch.
I usually use 1/2 to 2 ounces.  Finally, I feel tat 4-6 weeks is
too long, even at 40-45F.  At 65-70F, I recommend 7 to 10 days
and about two to 2.5 weeks for lagering temperatures.  After a
while, I feel that more hop aromatics are escaping from the beer
to the air than are entering the beer from the hops.  This, of
course, is unless you are planning to do this in a sealed container.
You should probably purge any air that you introduce during dryhopping
as oxygen kills hop aroma.

Subject: When should I pick my hops?


I planted some cascade and nugget hops this spring and the
Cascade's are doing great.  While the nuggets have just started to form
cones, the Cascades have cones that are between 1/2" and 3" long.
I've picked a couple and squeezed them, and they do produce a
plesant scent.  I'm thinking that it's time to pick them, but
how can I know for sure?  Also, what is the best way to dry and
store them?  I have been off of the digest for a couple of months
so any suggestions or compilations of previous posts would be
greatly appreciated.

COUNTER FLOW CHILLER CLEANING
I'd like a reasonable cleaning and sanitizing procedure for CF chillers. 
I'm considering building one but feel that merely hot water and idophor
probably isn't going to keep it clean over time.  On the other hand, I
don't quite feel like going through the clean-in-place process outlined in
the recent BT issue.  What do the rest of you do?


COOLER MASHING
I've been having some trouble reaching my desired mash temp of 154F by
infusing at a ratio of 1.25 qt H2O `at` 175F per pound of grist.  I've also
tried using a ratio of 1/1 and adjusting with boiling water.  When this
didn't work I drew of a fraction of the liquid, boiled and returned to the
mash.  I used this method on a porter that came out highly phenolic.  I
thought this was my first experience with an infected batch but a recent
post (sorry forgot who or when) suggested a link between tannins and
phenols.  Could boiling the dark grains cause a phenolic taste in my brew?
I don't notice other taste/mouthfeel components I associate with tannins. 
Also, I'm thinking of starting with hotter water and adjusting with cold
water or ice if necessary.  Any potential problems with stating with a too
hot mash?  I understand that the enzymes are not detrimentally affected by
short time periods over their active temperature range, correct?


GLATT MILL
I'd like to hear from anyone who has had a chance to use the Glatt mill,
both those who are pleased as well as those who are not.  I think I'll ask
Santa for a mill for Christmas and whould like to know which one to ask for.


PUMP SOURCES
I repeat my request for sources for wort pumps.  Thank you to Jeff Burton
for the lead on the March Manu. pump from C & H.  I got the C & H catalog
but the pump isn't listed, haven't called them yet.  Where did the rest of
you RIMS and other pump using brewers get your pumps?  Is this a secret
society sort of thing; you can't be part of the club until you find a pump
all by yourself?


Please post the pump sources to the Digest, I received several requests
for forwards after my last post on this.  Also, at the risk of a flame
war, I'd like a public discussion on CF cleaning so we get the pros and
cons of the various methods before I choose one.  E-mail is fine for other
info. 


Sorry to be so long winded, its been a while.  TIA.

I have to second this.  I added a carefully measured quantity of the
raspberry to a bottle of really good cyser and did the same using the
cherry in another bottle (I had lots, so I could spare a few bottles).  It
was excellent, absolutely outstanding! Now I can offer the "original" cyser
as well as delicious apple-raspberry and apple-cherry melomels.  :-)


Also, I'm looking forward to finally making (after a long busy spell with
no brewing) a blueberry-wheat beer using the blueberry extract.  Some time
in the future I'll report on this.  The extract sure smells good!


Mark, thanks for offering these excellent products (along with your
wonderful hops) to the homebrew community.


I have no connection with Mark Garetz or Hoptech other than being a very
hoppy ;-) and satisfied customer.

Does anyone know of a good homebrew store near Palo Alto.  I've been
to Fermentation Frenzy, and I was not impressed.  I'd like some place
with open bins of all grains and a good mill for the optional grinds.  A
good selection of hops would be nice too.


please e-mail me directly

Subject: Radlett, England pubs? / OLD bottle cleaning


Greetings!


I may be travelling for several months to Radlett, England, on business
in the near future.  The tasting opportunities are overwhelming, and I
would really appreciate any hints, tips, or suggestions as to places to
go while in the area (like Belgium, for instance ;-)  ), and so on.
Brand names would be great.


Also, what are the laws regarding hand-carrying ale&beer through UK & US
customs?  How much, if at all, can I bring?




- -----------------------




I recently found about a dozen old clear, green, and brown beer bottles
mouldering around in a barn floor.  There's green stuff growing inside
at least the clear ones, and I assume the rest as well.  I soaked them for
a couple of days in soapy water, and am planning to put them in a 5-gallon
pail of bleach water for a few weeks/months.  Anything besides this to try?
I'd hate to use my nice bottle brush on this scuzzy stuff.


The clear bottles will be nice!  Someone here (thanks, someone) posted that
they use one clear bottle per batch, and use that as their last bottle -
kind of a ceremonial type of thing.  Well, I've got 5 or 6 of them now, so 
that might hold me for a while, thanks for the great idea!
