Hi Group,
As I was reading over (yesterdays) Digest, I realized I was mixing the terms
Brazing and Soldering. The information I posted dealt with Brazing, at 1400F 
a much higher temp process.  The brazing alloys I listed will be unaffected 
by boiling of the wort, with respect to heat.  As before, don't use the first
few that contain Cadmium, I included them so you would know which ones not to
use.  Someone mentioned Tin and Wort being bad, I have not heard the reason 
for this. Please email me if you have any questions, I am not a Welding or
Brazing engineer, just a metallurgical, but I do have good reference books.

I did just that with my rig.  I was able to assemble my mash/lauter
tun, kettle and hot liqour tanks using brass fittings and silver 
bearing solder.  I was able to do it using a regular blow torch.


A couple of things to know: 


1. Make sure whatever solder you use is FOOD GRADE!
2. Silver braze (e.g. 15% or so silver) is very strong and harder to use
   Silver bearing solder (3-5% silver) is easier to use but much weaker
3. Get the right kind of flux - ask a welding shop for help.  As I found
   out there are different temperatures and compatibilities to deal with.
4. In short, brass and SS are incompatible with Silver Solder and you will
   probably be frustrated in getting a solid, watertight, durable connection.
   The problem is that the copper in the brass dissolves into the silver
   solder and makes it very brittle.  As your joint cools it will crack.
   You are getting shafted not only by the presence of copper, but the
   differential expansion between brass and SS.


If you can get SS fittings for at least the bulkhead (where you would be
silver soldering to the keg) your job should be much easier.  One
possibility, that I have not explored yet, would be to get some threaded
SS pipe (say 1/2" npt), bore a hole in your keg and just solder the nipple
in place.  Then you could attach your (cheap) brass fittings on either
side.  If you can get some sort of SS fittign with a flange, all the better.


Just in case you are wondering: yes all my joints leak a tad.  Now that I
have several brews behind me the cracks have filled with carmalized sugar
(at least on the kettle)... :-(

On GEnie we began having regular brew swaps about a year ago. When we
first decided to do this, someone called around to the USPS, UPS and
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (hey, ask _everyone_) about
the legality of shipping beer. Basically, ATF doesn't care as long as
it's not whiskey. USPS said it is AGAINST the LAW to ship alcoholic
bevs through the mail (first class or otherwise).
 
UPS folks will give you varying answers. I've had them reject a
package of framed photos because I used glass (they prefer plexi).
However, unless you tell them "liquid in glass" they won't know and
might not care; that amount of caring is what varies from counter to
counter. I usually write on the UPS slip "yeast samples" or "brewing
samples." Never questioned.
 
This week I shipped to a fellow brewer in Canada, so I had to deal
with a customs form as well. Since I had to be honest on the customs
form ("two (2) bottles homemade beer, value $1 each"), I pretty much
had to be honest on the UPS papers too, so I said "Homemade beer
samples for judging." (I know that many winemakers ship samples via
UPS) Flew right through, and he reported getting my beer today (four
days from WV to Ontario).
 
The bottom line is that UPS is not a gov't agency, not the law, and
the worst they can do is reject your package.

Rich Ryan asks about mailing beer......
 
Our group of folks on GEnie regularly mail beer to each other for our
Swap/Tastings held on-line on Saturday nights.  It is true that the US
Postal Service frowns 8^( very heavily on shipping alcoholic beverages by
mail.  I think it is again BATF regulations.  You can ship by UPS though.
This is what we do.  We just label the boxes as Brewing Supplies and leave
it like that.  We have had no problems to date.

I have not tested this but I use Miller's suggestion mostly for
convenience.  I fill all my bottles and set a cap on each one as I fill
it.  When all the bottles are filled, then I go and fasten the cap on
each one.  As I said, this is mostly for convenience because I don't
need to worry about keeping the bottling wand sanitized or worry about
it leaking or worry about keeping the siphon primed while I am capping.
That said, as I get about 1/2 - 3/4 of the way through bottling, the
bottles that were filled first have started to "burp" as the air is
pushed out by the CO2 produced by the yeasties.


One item that is critical for the success of this method is that my 2 &
4 year old helpers are asleep.

Subject: Purging Keg Headspaces


John McCaffrey <johnmc`at`brooktree.com> wrote on keg-forced carbonation
confusion (love that phrase) and discussed several major techniques.


One minor thought that may help.  When I carbonate my kegs, I found out
(the hard way, of course) that it is important to completely purge the air
from the headspace.


A while ago I kegged a batch and forgot to purge, just ran the pressure up.
Normally when I force-carbonate I can hear the CO2 going to work, and every
time I shake the key, more CO2 pours into the key.  This time, nothing.
Days later it hadn't carbonated at all, despite having way too much
pressure for dispensing.  Thinking on this, sudden memory struck and I
started purging.  I emptied the headspace from the gas disconnect, charged
it and emptied it, and charged it again up to carbonation pressure.  This
time the beer took some CO2, although still not that much.  After a day of
middling carbonation and overpressurization, I tried two more empty/refill
cycles and suddenly everything was working OK.


This raises a question: what procedures are people using for purging keg
headspaces?  My usual practice when I don't have amnesia is to hook up the
gas supply with the keg lid ajar, open the gas valve halfway and let the
CO2 run into the tank second or two, then pull the lid shut.


When people say "purge the headspace," what procedures are you following?

In regards to the question of if the actual variety of hop really matters for b

      I am also interested in the general net opinion on this issue. I have alw
ays wondered about this ever since I read the "Hops" special issue of Zymurgy w
hich describes how one guy set out to brew every style of beer known. He used C
hinook hops as the base bittering hop for every style. The rationale was that b
itterness is bitterness and Chinook hops have the most %AA per dollar.
      So how about it? Am I wasting big money using lots of Czech Saaz for bitt

Subject: Austin Stuff, Celis


Hey out there in HBD land, I just went to the Celis brewery for the
first time a few days ago and I had a great tour.  The tour info was
primarily historical (the story of Pierre Celis and his coming to Texas
and getting the brew kettles) and an intro to the brew process for those
who are not initiated.  The best part of the tour, of course, was the
beer samples - *fresh* from the tap, brewed within 6 weeks, words don't
do the taste justice.  Anyway - the sum total of all of this is - if you
are in the Austin/Central Texas area and haven't gone, you should go. 
If you are coming into the Austin area from out of town - make time for
the trip, the brewery is no more than a 30 minute drive from anywhere in
Austin (its actually about 5-10 minutes from I35 and 290).  While on
Austin, anyone know details on the upcoming Austin Brew Ha-Ha
Competition?
        While I'm here - I want to make a spiced beer for holidays and
have decided that the spiced liquour (sp!) is the way to go for me. 
Anyone know where I can get some Gloegg or other kind of spice
concentrate for use in such a beer?  If not I'll resort to making my own
and wing it.
        Hope you people up north are enjoying your fall - it'll be 98
again here today and no chance of any turning leaves...

I keep my kegs at room temp and run the beer line into a small fridge that
has a cold plate in it.  I cool my beer on demand.  Being at room temp,
I have to run my kegs at 30 psi for it to have 2.5 volumes (NOT atmospheres -
atmospheres is a unit of pressure) of CO2.  All I do is pressurize the keg
and shake it until I don't hear any more CO2 being absorbed by the brew and
then I know the beer is saturated and ready to go.  This takes 10 to 15
minutes.




The following table has been posted to HBD in the past and is very useful.

Pressure = F(Temperature, Volume)
P = -16.6999 - 0.0101059 T + 0.00116512 T^2 + 0.173354 T V

Subject: Re: Force Carbonation


John McCaffery has asked for some information about force carbonation, so
here goes (I'm sure this will be just one post among many):


Carbonation is the process of dissolving CO2 in water to form carbonic
acid.


Gasses are more soluble at lower temperature, though they get forced out
of solution just before freezing.  This is what makes the bubbles in ice
cubes.  CO2 is pretty soluble, but not instantly so.  Nor does it difuse
rapidly through the beer.  The disolving takes place only at the
gas/liquid interface, so the amount of surface area is important.


There are several implications to these facts.


1) Pressure does not equal carbonation.  It is possible for a keg to be
under high pressure and not have the beer well carbonated.


2) As the pressure/temp/vol CO2 tables imply, as temperature rises (or
falls) the pressure necessary for a certain degree of carbonation rises
(or falls).


3) An upright motionless keg presents the least surface area and thus
provides the worst conditions for carbonation.


Keeping these things in mind, here's how I handle my carbonation--


Sanitize the keg.  Purge it of air by pressurizing to 15 psi and venting
it off several times.  Open the safety release on the lid and then open
the lid just enough to slip in the racking hose.  Bleed CO2 into the
*open* keg at very low regulator setting (2-3 psi).  This is
anti-oxidation voodoo.  Rack the beer into the keg.


Seal the lid, pressurize to 35 psi.  Check for leaks and a good seal. 
Shake the keg repeatedly until no more gas will flow at 35 psi.  Put the
keg in the fridge overnight.  When the keg is chilled, hook it back up to
the CO2 at 35 psi and lay the keg on its side with the gas inlet
uppermost.  I don't have a check (one way) valve on my regulator, but I do
have a long (6') clear hose.  I will occasionally get a few drops of beer
moving into the gas line, but it has never been a problem, just some
cleaning after I'm done.  With the keg horizontal (to expose more surface
area) rock and slosh the keg until the regulator stops hissing.  Set the
keg upright.  Take a break.  Repeat until no gas is drawn into the key
when shaking.


At this point the keg is over pressurized and undercarbonated.  The
pressure is 35 psi.  If the pressure is vented to dispensing range, the
beer will have large coarse bubbles, foam a lot and go flat quickly.  Now
I put the beer back into the fridge.  As more gas dissolves, the pressure
will drop.  Over the next day or so, it will drop to 15-20 psi.  At this
point, I keep the keg at dispensing/equilibrium pressure (for me this is
12-15 psi at 47F, your taste may vary).  Depending on which tap and lines
I use, I may have to lower or raise the dispensing pressure to get the
right head. 


Something odd happens as the storage time increases.  The bubbles get
smaller, the beading (trails of bubbles) improves, and the carbonation
lasts longer in the glass.  I suspect this is due to the CO2 bonding
(slowly) to things other than water, but you can't prove it by me.  This
improvement in the quality of carbonation over time is puzzling, but pleasant.


I hope this helps out John and others.  I arrived at the process
empirically, 'cause the instructions I had (like his) didn't seem to work

Subject: Portable taps


For some time, I've been dissatified with my "cobra head" portable tap. 
It seems like the hose is too short, too fat.  The tap causes a lot of
turbulence.  I have arrived at the conclusion that these things are just a
kluge.  If I have time, I now remove a tap and line from my dispensing
fridge, but this is both a hassle and a compromise.


Does anyone know of a source for a better hand-tap for field use?  I don't
want to go to the expense of a cold plate or jockey box setup.  I just want a
tap that has a smaller i.d. hose and a tap that was designed for beer,
rather than coffee.  Any help out there?

I do kind of a hybrid of 1 and 2.  I essentially do the mash in a SS pot that
I put in a picnic cooler for temperature control.  When it comes time to
sparge, I line a plastic colander with my grain bag and pour the mash into
it.  After recycling the first runnings through the grain bed thus created, I
run my 168F water through the grain.  My colander has holes that are too large
for this purpose, so my water goes through too fast, but I seem to get pretty
good extraction this way.  I use 2-2.5 gal of water and 2.5 to 3# of grain for
this process.


I intend to fabricate one of those double bucket systems some year when I get
a few minutes of free time.

I agree.  Coincidentally, I was re-reading Noonan last night, in preparation
for re-taking the BJCP exam, and in the section on "Why Decoction?" he says
that the boiling of the decoctions helps to de-oxygenate the wort which leads
to the grain bed settling in "layers" at lautering time Noonan claims this
makes for a better filter bed.  I have no experience with this, but thought
it might be of general interest.


For the record, when kettle mashing, I scoop the mash into the lauter tun
with a small pot and try to do this as gently as possible to avoid oxidation.
In general, oxidation is a bad thing -- offhand the only positive oxidation
I can think of at this minute is the protective oxidation on aluminum and
stainless steel.

Subject: yeast behavior




HBDites:


As I am drinking some of the last of the summer's extract-brewed weissen 
batches I thought I would report some variation in the results, almost 
certainly due to the yeast.  


I brewed four 5 gallon batches, dark then light, and light then dark.  I 
pitched the 'dregs' from the fermenter, shaken up, from the first dark 
batch into the next light batch.  I started over for the next two batches,
also pitching from the first (light) into the second (dark).  The boiling 
times, 60 min., were the same for all batches.   The fermentation 
temperatures were also approximately the same (~70 F), as were the 
temperatures when I pitched (~75 F).  Both light brews and both dark brews 
had the same rather simple recipes:


6.6 lbs. NorthWestern Weissen extract
1.5 oz. Saaz (3/4 in boil, the rest at the end) 
22 oz. Yeast Lab W51 Bavarian Weizen, primed for the first of each pair 
       of brews


======================================================================
>From yeast FAQ:
Yeast Lab W51 Bavarian Weizen
This strain produces a classic German style wheat beer, with moderately
high, spicy phenolic overtones reminiscent of cloves.  Medium attenuation,
moderately flocculent.
======================================================================


The two dark batches had, at the usual reboil stage: 


1/2 lb. chocolate malt 
1/4 lb. crystal malt 


The finished brews made with the fresh yeast were almost overwhelming in 
mostly clovelike phenolics while the brews made with the "repitched" yeast 
had much more balanced phenolics (some vanilla) and esters (banana), like 
commercial weissens, only more intense (and delicious in my opinion). The 
'overly' clovelike brews have mellowed with age, but their weissen 
character is still not close to the pleasant balance between phenols and 
esters found in the other brews and in store-bought European wheat beers.


Regarding this, I can find no illuminating material in Warner's great
monograph on german wheat beer, except that the overall level of phenolic
substances is higher when the entire fermentation is carried out at higher 
temperatures.  My working hypotheses are that some change in the yeast or
some substance(s) in the sediment contribute to the (better) character
of the second batches.  Any comments?  Any advice on how I can acheive 
second-batch results from the getgo?

Firstly, not *all* of the oils are boiled away (*most* are though and some
are changed into oxidation products, also with aroma).  But enough survive
into the beer to have subtle impacts on the beer's flavor.  Also, the "oil"
is not a single compound but contains upwards of 300 compounds that occur
in differing proportions depending on the variety.  Also, there is the 
question of the "bitter flavor" that comes from the alpha acids and their
oxidation products.  The proportions of the alpha acids (which is variety
dependent) has an effect on the quality of the bitter flavor.  The best
documented example of this is the cohumulone level.  It is suspected that
high cohumulone levels lead to a harsher bitterness.  It so happens that
usually "aroma" hops have a low proportion of cohumulone, and the high alpha
hops tend to have higher proportions.


Back to the oils:  So here's what happens.  When you put in a low alpha hop
for bittering, you are usually adding a lot more aroma compounds to the beer
because you are adding a lot more ounces of hops to get the alpha acid content
right.  Converesly, when you use a "high alpha" hop, you add less oils.  Now
I say "usually" because some of the high alpha varieties also have high oils,
but the noble aroma hops (that the studies have been done with that I am 
basing my comments on) also have fairly high oil contents but low alphas.


A lot also depends on the beer style.  The aroma compounds left over from
the bittering hops is a lot more likely to be noticed in a well-made lager
than it would be in a pale ale that would typically have more finishing
hops or a stout/heavy beer where lots of flavors will mask the hop
subtleties.  All of the commercial studies on this subject have been done
with lagers.  They have been trying to answer the age-old question "Does
using noble and/or aroma hops for bittering make a difference in the beer's
taste?"  The answer seems to be "Yes."  But again, they are concerened with
lagers.  So, it's not a stupid question.  The pros have been at it for years.

A is the level of the wort in the fermenter.  C is the level of the liquid in
your blowoff bucket.  B is the point at which the wort is forced up to during
heavy fermentation.  When the fermentation slows, since the mass of the liquid
in the left side of the tube is greater than the mass of the liquid in the
right side of the tube, the direction of motion of the liquid is now right to
left (pulling liquid from the blowoff bucket).  No?


RE: HOPS FAQ, progress is slow, mostly because of the underwhelming response to
my request for information.  I am currently looking for commercial examples and
flavor/aroma profiles for the following hops:


Hallertau Hersbrucker
Hallertau Mittelfruh
Liberty
Mt. Hood
Styrian Goldings
Willamette
Bullion
Centennial
Chinook
Cluster
Galena
Nugget
Perle
Pride of Ringwood


Yes, I realize this is practically a list of every hop ever known to (modern)
man.  The point is that for this FAQ to work I need input from you brewers.  I
haven't tried a lot of these hops and even some of the ones I did try, I didn't
take notes on hop flavor profile, etc.  As far as the flavor profiles, your own
adjectives are what I'm after (i.e. citric, flowery, funky, strong, non-
descript, etc.)  Also, commercial examples of a particular hop would be quite
welcome, but I'd prefer not to get things like "I've heard they use Mt. Hood in
XYZ beer".  If its a rumour it probably doesn't belong in the FAQ.  Part of the
reason for me doing this FAQ is selfish; I want the information.  If it was
solely for that purpose, though, I wouldn't be putting in the kind of time I'm
spending.  The extra effort is for the digest participants; I'm just asking for
a little input.  Is that too much to ask?

Subject: Vigorous fermantation (non tarred)


Sorry about the tar-corrupted file - I only have a slight idea how that may
have happened, but it's too mundane to elaborate.


Basically, I brewed a Scottish Ale (recipe taken from pg. 9-6 of Cats Meow),
brewed using standard extract procedures.  I used Wyeast #1056 (American Ale
yeast), made a starter, and added it to the wort.


I racked to a secondary (carboy) after 9 days.  Today (day 12) the brew is
still actively fermenting (one bubble from airlock about every minute, and tiny
bubbles regularly rise to the beer's surface - as noticed through the carboy).
My basement temp. ranges between 67^F to 70^F (where the beer's fermenting).
Additional Note:  My tarnished Wort Chiller became de-tarnished after the wort
chilling phase for this brew.


QUESTIONS/CONCERNS:
Is this long of a fermentation period abnormal (for #1056)?
How long a fermentation period can I observe before I become worried?


Any/all responses/observations welcome.


Looking through the 1992 HOMEBREW Digest Index (1992.index) I noticed some
articles referencing "Problems with long ferments for WYeast 1056" - however,
I don't have direct ftp access to sierra.stanford.edu, and therefore am unable
to view those HB Digests (Digest #'s: 835, 837, 969->972, 1011, 1012).

When partial-mashing, to what extent might it be beneficial to (1) measure & 
adjust the ph of the water (2) use the iodine test for conversion?


It sounds to me like most partial-grain people pretty much fly by the seat of

It's not a good idea to add the juice early in the boil because boiling
will boil-off many aromatics from the juice and about all you'll get is
alcohol out of the juice's sugars.  The flavor is in the aromatics!


Also, it's not a good idea to add the juice at bottling because it has
sugars in it and you'll get overcarbonated beer.


In addition to the two suggested cherry juice additions there are at least
two more:


1. add the juice in the last 1 minute of the boil, and


2. pasteurize the juice by heating it to 160F  for 10 minutes, cool it,
and add it after the primary fermenation is over.


Suggestion 1) is more likely to set the pectins (I think your homemade
juice has pectins in it) which will make your beer cloudy.


Suggestion 2) is the best because adding the cherry juice (or any fruit)
at pitching time is that the fermentation of the malt sugars and fruit
sugars will produce a lot of CO2 which will scrub the cherry aromatics
out of the beer.


I think that 4 cups may be an un-noticable amount of cherry flavor for
a 5 gallon batch.  I'm about to make a cherry beer and am thinking about
using between 6 and 8 pounds of cherries under 3.5 gallons of beer.  I've
used 13 pounds in a batch of pKriek and the cherry flavor was quite intense.


I've looked through many grocery stores looking for 100% cherry juice,
but no luck -- they are always (in order on the label): water, corn syrup,
white grape juice, cherry juice, preservatives.  That's not what I want
in my beer.  If you can't find more real cherry juice, it would be a shame
to waste the 4 cups you have.  Here's what I suggest:


 * Brew up the batch of beer.
 * When it's done, siphon one gallon onto the four cups of PASTEURIZED juice
   in a sanitized, two-gallon container.
 * Bottle the other four gallons.
 * Wait till the cherry sub-batch is done, bottle that.
