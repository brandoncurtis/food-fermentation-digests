I purge the keg prior to racking into it by filling the keg with CO2
and opening the vent in the lid.  I repeat this several times.  Then
I rack into the keg with gas still attached to receiving keg (2-3 psi) to
ward off the demons of beer oxidation.  One can also rack into the keg
using the liquid out connector with the appropriate fittings.  You will
have to bleed the gas out of the receiving keg as it fills with beer.
When complete, I pressurize the keg to 10-15 psi, vent and re-pressurize
and repeat 3 or 4 times. *Another* useful technique to exorcise the demons
of beer oxidation is to use the two-hole (orange) carboy cap at racking
and force LOW pressure CO2 into one hole (the side hole) to start the siphon.
After the siphon has started, loosen the carboy cap and maintain a low
flow rate of CO2 to keep a blanket of CO2 on the beer until you're done
racking.

Subject: decoction (not again!), SN Pale Bock




Hello all,


I've been an HBD reader for a few months now, but this is my first writing 
adventure.  I
know the decoction discussion has come and gone, but it did inspire my buddy 
and I to
try it.  Although slightly intimidated by the 23 step process, possible 
divorces, etc., we
leapt right in.  It all started yesterday...


We started just as we would for a temperature controlled mash.  Infuse about 
10 quarts
135 F water with 10.5 pounds grain (9 # Belgian Pilsener Malt, 1 # Belgian 
Munich Malt,
and 1/2 # Crystal Malt (30 L)) into a 10 gallon cooler equipped with a 
copper sparge
manifold. We hit our protein rest temperature of about 125 F. We held this 
for about
thirty minutes then pulled our first decoction (about 1/3 of the total 
volume, mostly
grains).  Our plan was to slowly heat this on our propane cooker to about 
155 F.  It was
then we realized that the words "slowly heat" and "propane cooker" do not go 
together
well.  After an almost instantaneous local boil, we moved the decoction 
inside to the
stove.  Here we were somewhere between 140 F and 160 F for about 30 minutes. 


Figuring this would be okay, we proceeded to boil for about 20 minutes.  We 
slowly
added this back to our mash.


Our mash came to a temperature of about 140 F and stayed firmly there.  
After a few
boiling water infusions and another small decoction, we managed to get all 
the way to
152 F. Cautiously optimistic, we let it mash for about and hour and a half.  
Our iodine
tests never showed complete conversion (maybe because of grain particles in 
the
sample?). We pulled our final decoction (all liquid, about 2 gallons) and 
heated it to boil
quickly on the propane torch.  Once added back, we began our sparge with 
about 4.5
gallons of water. This went fine (sparged till runnings were about 1.010), 
as did the boil.
We cooled the wort using an immersion chiller and racked off some 
brilliantly clear
wort.  Total time was about 8 hours.


Our original gravity was 1.044. This gives an extraction of about 21 
pts/lb/gal (I think).
This is a bit lower than my typical extraction for a temperature controlled 
mash (about
25 pts/lb/gal).


My questions are these:


1. Was my extraction so low because of incomplete conversion or some other 
reason?


2. Was my temperature control a factor? If so, how do others out there 
control
temperatures more precisely?


3. Should my first decoction have been bigger?


4. Does anyone out there have a good recipe to duplicate the Sierra Nevada 
Pale
Bock? My wife really likes it and since she gave me no grief about this 
decoction
mess...


Sorry about the length and TIA for the info.

I connect the gas to the liquid poppet, then, while holding the pressure
relief valve up, i crank on the gas.  you can hear the co2 bubble up.  i
do this for maybe 10 or so seconds.  then i pressurize to about 5-7 psi,
check for leaks, then let it condition.

Ok ok.  We all have our opinions.  Jack your approach reminds me of a
brewing friend here who won't budge from his tried and true methods.
Despite all the renovations and improvements my brewery has gone through
much in part due to major learning/ideas/creations developed from net
knowledge.  His brews are all made from the basics:
    Pale malt,  crystal malt,  the three dark malts (choco/roast/black)
He basically rotates between: Pale, golden, amber, stout.
It works for him.  He likes his beer.


Me...I adventure.  I've tried most anything, from pumkin to pepper, to 
vast arrays of fruits and spices.  Plus...a number of specialty malts.
Yes they add color and flavor.  They can give an extract brewer a grainier
taste.  But many of them will perform best in the presence of mashing
enzymes.  to an extracter they may just lead to starch and haze.


Here's some examples of ones I use and why  (I've been all-graining for
about 4 years now, so I've tried a couple along the way...)


Basics: Pale malts,  2 row, 6 row.  Basic mashing enzyme power- fermentables
        Vienna 2 row. A slightly darker maltier base malt. Good for ambers
        Munich malt.  2 or 6 row, depending on supplier (see discussions)
            A bit darker still, has enzymes.  Good in strong lagers styles.


        Crystals.  The whole shlew of lovibond ratings.  Use em all. 10-120.
        Don't just settle for generic "crystal". Get the rating, try high and
        low.  I don't think I've ever made a beer w/o crystal.  The higher
        end add a particularly nice heavier maltiness to mid-color brews.


Specialties worth trying (IMHO of course)  Use .5-3 #/5 gallons
        Victory.    Adds a nutty/roasty flavor, but MUCH more subtle than 
          the dark malts.  Great for a nut brown, or vienna
        Dextrine.  Want the full body mouth feel in your stouts? That sweet
          chewy kind of character you find in a good full porter.   
        Wheat.  Go 50/50 for a real wheat beer, or just a touch to add some
          serious head retention.  I usually toss in a few cups for fun.
        Rye.  A bit more unusual. Not for everyone.  Adds a red tone.
          Try some DARK crystal with about 30% rye in a golden/amber brew.
          It has an unusual flavor. Sort of "bitey" , tart almost.
          Hard to describe by a nice change of pace.  One taster swears by it


Dark malts
        Chocolate, Roasted, Black Patent.  (These should almost be in the
        basics!)  I love chocolate. I bought 30 #'s so I'd NEVER run out.
        Get to know them separately or in combinations. The battle over which
        belongs in porter may never end- black or roast?!!!!  Try a full 
        pound, or just toss in a handful to a "light" beer and see what
        happens.  Wonderful things come to life.  Dark grains are NOT only
        for dark beers.  A sublte roast taste can do wonders for a pale.


How to get to know specialty malts...Thoughts to ponder.
    So many variables, so much beer, so much tasting, and brewing...
   Make a lighter beer with just pale and crystal as the base.  Add a 
   slightly oversized amount of the specialty malt.  Say 3 or 4 pounds.
    see how it Really tastes.  Then use it in smaller quantities to your
    liking.  Do this SEPARATELY with different batches and different malts,
    then start to mix and match.  
  Look to style recipes for what is "appropriate" for a particular style
    and go for it.  Alternate combinations.  Use victory and munich, then
    munich and dextrine, then victory and dextrine.


I have gotten to a point where I don't formulate a recipe ahead of time.
I decide on degree of color, and go to my grain room and mix and match
letting the grains speak to me and call out who wants to give their all
to this particular batch.  I try to add several but NOT ALL types in each
batch. I've had brews with as much as 10 differnt types of malt.  The
resulting flavors can be very complex and perform dances of ectasy on the
taste buds and "brew senses".  Then there is the whole world of hop varieties
to play with, but that's another story.


I know there are many other types of malts out there. Belgian and all,
which I have yet to sample.  There are certainly differnces between 
american 2 row and english 2 row, or lager malts.  Worth the prices to
try for that special holiday ferment, or all the time!




NOW A QUESTION:  Hot side aeration.  
    I have not seen Fix's article on this, I was wondering if anyone could
summarize the crux of it for me.  The concern is over addind air to a mash
once it's brought up to mashing temp, and then upon sparging and splashing.


I made a copper manifold/rectangular cooler lauter tun ( I love it!)
I added a tube that extends upward at the side away from the spigot.
I can run water through the tubing and sprinkle sparge water gently on top
of the mash with NO disturbance of the grain bed.  One idea which came up
was that I could use this tube to set the grain bed.  I begin the mash
in my brew pot, get it well mixed then add hot water to bring the temp up
and dump the shlew into the cooler.  I can then blow air into the tube at
the top side to mix the contents, allowing the heavier pieces of husk to
settle quickly while anypowder rises to the top.  I've had excellent 
sparges using this.  I've even run the tun dry (got distracted) before 
finishing the sparge, so I added more water (underlet) and reset the grain 
bed by blowing air in. The bubbles rise from below- stirring all the grain
and bits upward.  As they re-settle the heavies drop first and the bed
is re-set.  With this setup I don't see how I could ever have a stuck
sparge.  
    But what damage can be caused by bubbling air through a mash?
I know that boiled hot wort is subject to oxidation reactions, but we're
talking about a fair few degrees cooler here.  Do other mashers out there
take efforts to avoid splashing the wort upon sparging?  I stick
a spoon in the line of flow to let the wort travel down the spoon
rather than through the air splashing into the collecting vessel.


Any knowledgable info on this, or personal experiences would be welcomed.
Thanks in advance.   Good brew to you all.

From: edo`at`marcam.com (Ed Oriordan)
Subject: First All Grain


I am slowly preparing for my first all grain batch, and would like to ask
a few questions on my proposed recipe.  I am going for a kind of Pete's
Wicked or dark pale ale (this is somewhat of a conversion of my standard
extract brew). 5 gal batch size.


  8 lbs 2-Row Amreican
1/2 lb  Crystal
1/2 lb  Cara-Pils
1/4 lb  Chocolate malt
  1 oz  Norther Brewer (bittering)
  1 oz  Cascade (finishing)
1056 WYeast American


Q1 - I am planning a single step infusion.  Is 2-Row American the
grain I should be using?  If not, what and why?
Q2 - Should I be using more than 8 lbs? Should I use 9 lbs?
Q3 - I have used crystal and chocolate in the past, but never Cara-Pils.
Is there anything I need to know?  I am using it for body (is this a waste
for a single step infusion?) Should I use more than 1/2 lb?
Q4 - Do all four grains require the same grind? I have my own mill so I can
adjust it? Are they all about the same grain size?
Q5 - I am planning on mashing the Cara-Pils and 2-Row and adding the crystal
and chocolate at mashout time, is this correct?


If anybody could give me a hand I'd appreciate it.  


Later I'll post what I am planning for the actual brewing procedure if that's 
OK.

Subject: PVC/DWC Tubing - Food Grade?


To date, I have conducted my mashes in a cylindrical insulated water
cooler (the big orange type) with a false bottom. The system works well as
far as holding a constant temperature, but I have always found it
difficult to stir the mash in a deep and narrow container. Therefore, I
plan to convert a large rectangular picnic cooler into a mash tun for
easier stirring/mixing. Rather than using slotted copper tubing for
drainage, I am considering using either black or white PVC/DWC tubing that
is sealed with either the yellow PVC cement employed in plumbing
procedures, or with silicon sealant (the aquarium type). Now the question:


Is PVC tubing safe for this type of food application?? What about the
yellow sealant? All comments appreciated. Take care.

I age the beer in a glass carboy and transfer it to the keg when the beer
is perfectly clear.  Pressurize the keg, shake it to force carbonate and
it's ready to serve - immediately.  If, during the final racking you do
introduce some sediment, the amount is rarely enough to be a factor.

        When bottle conditioning, the CO2 is being generated in the beer 
itself, and comes out of solution to enter the headspace.  In a keg, the 
CO2 is in the headspace and has to dissolve into the beer.  Two opposite 
scenarios.  In the bottle, the dissolved CO2 and the headspace gas will 
tend to find their own equilibrium.  In the keg,you start with a low 
dissolved CO2 and high head space CO2 partial pressure.  If you want your 
keg carbonation to mimic bottle carbonation, attach a plastic hose from 
your CO2 dip tube down to the bottom of the keg, clamp it at the end, and 
punch it full of a million pin holes.  Then, start at about 5 psi, upping 
the pressure by about 1psi/day for a week.  Of course, it's faster just to 
shake the kegs....

        I think that if you are trying to maintain a specific temperature, 
you're acceptable temperature fluctuation is the precision tolerance of 
your thermometer.  That said, I think we all have temperature variation in 
the mash, and do our damndest to minimize it, unless it is specifically 
desired.  I tend to pre-heat my oven to 200^F, then turn it off and put in 
the mash tun.  I get almost no heat loss over a two hour mash that way.  
Even this way, though, at teh time I put the tun in the oven the bottom and 
middle of the mash may be a few degrees warmer than the top and sides.  
To answer your question specifically, if your mash drops from 156 to 150 
over an hour, *record* it as a drop of 156 to 150 over an hour.  If you 
want a mash of 153, either find a way of better insulating the tun, or give 
it extra heat boosts every now and again.  Sometimes accuracy requires a 
little extra work.  But then, sometimes you can just pop it in the oven...


***************************


On the subject of blowoff tubes:
Recently I have started following Miller's suggestion, racking off the trub 
a little while after pitching the yeast, but before primary fermentation 
gets going.  This can be tricky, because a good healthy yeast starter will 
get going before the trub gets to settle out.  What I do is this:  My 
immersion chiller (planispiral) cools the wort rapidly to under 100^F, but 
then slows down, as the temperature differential is decreased.  I take the 
temperature down to about 80^F, then rack into a carboy (I use the ventury 
tube aeration here).  I let it cool a further few hours, then pitch the 
yeast.  I wait another few hours, and rack it off the trub while transferring  
to the primary, a 23L carboy,  again aerating the wort.  When the kraeusen 
forms, it is birght, clean, and white.  No brown gunge at all.  It rises 
into the extra headspace the 23L carboy offers, and falls back in, retaining 
all those lovely heading proteins.  Moral:  The brown gunge is from the trub, 
and is not a product of the kraeusen.  Get to the source of the problem 
instead of employing bandaid solutions.  If you use blowoff because you 
like to ferment in carboys, get a bigger carboy.  I you use a blowoff to 
remove bitterness, rack off the trub instead.
Of course, if you're happy with your beer, ignore this.

This past summer I drank a Raspberry Stout in Crested Butte, CO.  Does
anyone have a recipe for this brew?  Would it be better to use whole
raspberries or raspberry juice?  Is Raspberry Iced Tea Snapple brewed the
same way? (just kidding)  Thanks in advance for your help.

  I made a sweet stout recently and primed with M&F light DME.  I noticed
  a ring around the bottle after 1 1/2 weeks or so.  I figured I had infected
  the whole batch, but it all turned out excellent!  Thanks for posting this
  message, Al.  Now I have a better feel about that ring.  There was also
  oily scum in the beer after the head drops :( after 5 mins or so.  I brewed
  a four gallon batch in a five gallon carboy - little blowoff.  But now I
  suspect the DME was the culprit, rather than unexpelled krausen.

I did the same thing with my first full mash Pale Ale.  I added 1oz of
Willamette to the fermenter, it came out with a great hop aroma, but also
an unbelievable bitterness.  BTW I just threw the hops in on top of the
fermenting wort.  It took a long time for my bitterness to go away, and
by that time I didn't think the beer was very good.  (couldn't tell if
wasn't very good to start with too much bitterness)

No because when you are force carbonating the keg, you need the extra CO2
beer contact.  When the bottle is carbonating the yeast are producing CO2
in the beer.

Subject: more cherry juice stuff...


Chris and Al talk about the difficulties in finding and using cherry juice
for beer.  I too have used the Knudsen's cherry juice, added in the
secondary.  I used two quarts and the result was only a slight cherry
aftertaste.  The beer was good, but I was disappointed with the low level
of cherry flavor (no metallic taste though!).  Adding the cherry juice
kicked off a very strong fermentation and, if I were to do it again, I
would use more juice (or the concentrated version) and reduce the temp
of the secondary to slow down the extra fermentation caused by the new
sugars.


This having been said, however, I don't think I'll be trying the juice
anymore.  The last cherry ale I made was done using HopTech's cherry
flavoring, and I was very pleased.  One tbsp in the keg resulted in a
wonderful cherry flavor.  The beer was a 30% wheat base and hopped using
US Saaz at about 1/2 my usual rate.  Incidentally, this beer was very
popular with my non-HBing friends.


Of course, the usual disclaimers about associations with HopTech apply.  Just
a happy customer...


BTW, for those interested in finding the pure cherry juice, check out Whole
Foods.  That was the only place I could find it.

Subject: Pete's Wicked Ale Extract Recipe


Ingredients for 5 gallons:
        6 lb bag of William's nut brown extract: "includes a blend of
            pale, victory, crystal, chocolate, dextrin, and other malts"
            from Williams Brewing 1-800-759-6025
        6 oz of crushed chocolate malt. (Lovibond 350)
        1 & 1/3 ounce cascade hops.
        1 cup of corn sugar for priming.


Yeast: "Wyeast American/Chico Ale"
Total boiling time: 70 minutes
Hops added : "Cascade"  State: "Whole 1992 4.6%"  Amount: 0.95oz  Boiled for: 70
Hops added : "Cascade"  State: "Whole 1992 4.6%"  Amount: 0.30oz  Boiled for: 10
Initial gravity: 1.043  Final gravity: 1.012


Prepare the chocolate malt in a separate boiling pot containing at least
a gallon of water.  Add the chocolate malt to cold water.  Raise the
temperature to 170 F.  Pour the hot liquid through a strainer into the
main brew pot to remove spent grains.


You probably could substitute a simple pale ale extract with some crystal
malt for the William's nut brown extract.


Tasting Notes:  In a side-by-side comparison with Pete's Wicked Ale, the
two beers were nearly identical.  The homebrew was preferred because the
roasted-coffee-like flavor component was slightly stronger and much more
persistent in the homebrew.  This was probably due to the freshness of
the homebrew. (Who knows how long the Pete's Wicked Ale has been sitting
on a shelf!)

Remember a while back we had a discussion about the best liquids for
hydrating yeasts and for starters? The candidates seemed to be wort, sugar
water, or plain water. Does anyone have a copy of those discussions. I know
I can search through old digests but it will save me a lot of time if
someone kept that thread. 


My brother-in-law wants do do a research project on beer yeast and thought
he might investigate this question. Are there any other suggestions you all
have for beer yeast research (at the early graduate student level).


Thanks

I have seen this subject asked before, but I have not yet read of a 
workable, ie. inexpensive, solution.  The main problem I see is that you 
can not attach anything to the hydrometer itself.  This would effect the 
weight/calibration of the hydrometer. The weight could be compensated for 
by recalibrating, but the friction of your proposed "slide wire" resistor 
might be enough to cause the hydrometer to stick and provide false 
readings.  A possible solution to this would be to use a series of photo 
receptors that would be uncovered as the hydrometer sinks into the 
fermenting beer.  This would require a light source opposie the photo 
receptors.  The resolution would depend on the number of photo receptors 
that could be attached to a 3" vertical strip, the average length of the 
hydrometer drop from 1.000 to 1.060.


Just a suggestion, for what it's worth.

I work at UPS and have rewrapped damaged boxes containing Homebrew
About four years ago a box containing wine broke open and a supervisor
went to check if UPS could ship alcohol. I was told it was ok and the only
time regulations applied is when it is being sold mail order. If its being sold
   the purchaser has to be of age and the seller licensed. No restrictions on pe
   rson to person.




The best thing to pack it in, in my opinion, is a box lined with one inch thick
   styrofoam insulation. Its ridgid so it adds strength to the box wont shift
around, and its cheap and easy to find. Styrofoam popcorn shifts so does balled
newspaper and your bottles wind up against the bottom of the box.
Pack it right - Dont bother writing fragile on the box we dont have time to
read it.
