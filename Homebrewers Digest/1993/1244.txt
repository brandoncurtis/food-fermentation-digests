Subject: Dry Ice cooling NOT!


Someone asked about using dry ice for cooling their wort.


Since dry ice liberates humungous amounts of gas you had better be prepared
for a huge overflow of sticky bubbling (and still hot) wort, like a krausen
from hell.


I have tried this for other purposes and it was *definitely* not worth the
trouble.  Note that those of you who put dry ice in your college punch had
a more controlled reaction since the punch was not boiling hot.


Try a cooling coil.

Subject: India Pale Ale request




This question is directed in particular to kindred brewers in the 
beautiful Pacific Northwest.


I recently spent an extended amount of time in the Seattle area - 
particularly Silverdale/Poulsbo. While there, my buddy and I ran across 
a little place that harbored some 30 microbrewed beers on their tap 
wall. Now, coming from a "microbrew" wasteland (panhandle Fl) I was 
awestruck (but that's another soapbox).


This place had an India Pale Ale on tap at the time that I was quite 
impressed with. I think the brewer was Deschutes(sp?). Is anyone 
familiar with this beer and, if so, do you have any all-grain recipes 
that attempt to clone this fine brew? I would love to produce some of 
that Pac.N.W. finery here in the Southeast.


Thanks a million,

Subject: Removing Foil Labels, Bottle Filling


I'm setting up a homebrewing "kit" for a friend for Christmas,
including two cases of M*ller longnecks in the waxed cardboard
cases.  I'd like to mimimize the time/effort in removing the
foil labels.  In the past I've tried a variety of solvents, boiling 
water, wire brush, razor blade, etc. but never found a combination
that worked well.  Anyone have any tricks for this?  Please don't
suggest other bottle types, I already have the empties, and I'm
a big fan of clear bottles.


I used the spring type bottle filler for many batches until I
tried a simple hose clamp.  I bought one of the 69 cent white plastic
clamps, the kind with the ratcheting latch. I bent the teeth of the
latch out of the way, and simply use hand pressure to shutoff the
flow between bottles.  It is faster, cleaner (no foaming), and
probably minimizes aeration.  Try it, you'll like it.


PS: Anyone tried making a grape mead?  I've had good luck with cherry
and cranberry juice, but I'm leery of making alcoholic grape koolaid.
I've got a gallon of concentrated juice from homegrown grapes (big and
blue, concord maybe?) that I figure would flavor about 4 gallons of
mead.  However, the wife would kill me if the mead didn't turn out: she
wants to waste it on jam.  Any thoughts or experiences are appreciated.


Worry if you must, but by all means, have a homebrew!

Domenick, I've been working on the hops faq and I'm starting to come to the
conclusion that there are no hop substitutions.  There are many hops grown to
be genetically similar (Hallertau Mittelfruh being the most copied), and some
of the "copies" are good, and some are bad.  I suppose these copies can be
called substitutes, but its a personal choice.  There is also very little (read
"zero") literature describing flavor profiles of hops.  Unfortunately, we are
all working in the dark until we taste/smell the actual hops, which is why I'm
looking for commercial examples of each hop for the faq (its a tough job but
someone has to do it; I'm hoping this weekends GABF will help!).  BTW, many of
the hops you mention are fairly rare in the US (Northdown, POR) so even less
information is available on them.  So, the news is bad, but I'll wish you good
luck in your search.  Keep us informed.

Subject:      Mashing out


Thanks, chris and Dom for the refreshing look at what's really 
necessary. For those of you who require the opinion of published 
brewing experts, Terry Foster _Pale Ales_ says that a mash out 
is unnecessary for most ales. Great news for the mash/lauter 
tun crowd. He says the only reasons you need to do a mashout 
is for a high viscosity wort or for a mash that has been decocted 
and some of the filtering properties fo the husks is diminished. 
The higher "mash-out" temps will get the sweet liquor to flow 
better thru a less than ideal grain bed.


As far as I recall, there was no mention of denaturing enzymes, 
completing reactions, etc. I'm going to try it today with my new 
mash/lauter.

This is the first time I used this yeast.  My OG is about 55.  The main
thing I noticed about this strain is its _creaminess_.  With other
yeasts, I usually had a lot of bubbles, that died down relatively
quickly.  With this yeast the kraeusen was dense, creamy, and still
there when I racked to the carboy.  The head built up somewhat in the
carboy, but is now dying down.


Time in primary:  4 days
Time in carboy:   5 days so far


I'm fermenting at about 68F, and I'd say that the fermentation is going
more slowly than I typically see.


BTW, my supplier now only carries Yeast Lab liquid yeasts.  Is the
American Ale yeast the same as the Wyeast??

Subject: IMPERIAL STOUT


Bitterness in stout comes from two sources: the hops, and the dark
grains.  There are a number of things you can do to reduce it:


1. Cut down the hopping rate.  (Most likely cause of overbitterness.)


2. Use less dark malt.


3. Don't heat your dark grains to boiling (and DON'T boil them), just
steep them for 30 minutes in 160F water, then strain the liquid into
your boiling pot.


You can also add unfermentable sugars, which will make the beer
sweeter and reduce its apparent bitterness by:


1. Add more crystal malt.  Again, steep it in a sufficient quantity of
160F water (2 quarts water/lb of grain).


2. Add lactose.  I've never done this, so I can't recommend amounts.


That all said, Imperial Stout is a fairly bitter style.  I think a
typical one will come in at about 50-80IBUs. It's also very sweet.
Try Samuel Smith's for a classic example.

Subject: Is Mashing out necessary


Stellar responses from Chris Campenelli re: mashing out and is it
necessary. By golly I don't do it either! For that matter I don't
even adjust my hydrometer readings for temperature variances. I can't
imagine the havoc being played with thoses OG's being off by a point
or 2. Come to think of it, I don't always use a secondary
fermentation. Nor will I bow to the ever gracious concept that one
must recirculate for clear wort. Won't decoct, protein rest, or
upward step infuse, either. Use a Corona not a roller mill and add an
extra handful of grain to make up for the lost extraction. Sparge by
dumping the water on the grain bed, not sprinkled with delicate
droplets, each 0.25ML in size. X:-O


I get 33 Points extraction, consistantly, from Domestic 2 row, and my
beer is consistantly very good based on the lineup consistantly at
the door!


Then again, if you enjoy doing all these things, brew away!!!

1. Is my bottle filler the culprit in my oxidation problems? If so, is there 
something better out there?


This could be the problem, you could try raising up the bottle to just
below the level of the beer in the priming tank so your siphon runs slower
until the tip of the filler is covered in beer.  That's what I do.


2. Has anyone out there ever used those oxygen absorbing bottle caps?


Yes, but I've only noticed them increasing the life of my hop nose and
increasing the general shelf-live of the beer.


3. Is it possible that some extract manufacturers have HSA problems in the 
manufacture of the extracts?


Yes, but it could also be the age of the extract and the storage temperature.
I know that extract syrup tends to darken as it ages and I'll bet that this
is partly caused by oxidation.

I have never been involved in a competition (nor would I ever tolerate one)
in which beers were excluded from judging.  This just doesn't happen.  As
far as I know, there are only two reasons for recipe forms:


1. publication of winning recipes, as in the case of the AHA Nationals, and


2. to try to prevent ringers, i.e. if an entry appears to have been a
re-packaged commercial beer, the competition organizers could check to see
if perhaps the recipe proves that the beer should be disqualified -- an expert
brewer can tell if a recipe and a beer really could match or not.  This is
not an easy task and I've yet to see anyone attempt it at a competition.

There, now that Chris and Dom's vapors have dissipated, we can get
on with the mash at hand.  Chris mentioned one of the benefits
of mashout (the debated one), but failed to mention the one on which
most of us agree, namely mashing out raises the temperature of the
mash much quicker than simply pouring sparge water and therefore
more quickly decreases the viscosity of the runnings.  Runnier runnings
mean faster sparging (without a loss of extract efficiency), less chance
of a set mash (stuck runoff) and more efficient extraction of sugars.
Remember, warm honey pours easier than cold honey.

Jack writes:
 It is my contention that the bogyman is in the mash/lauter tun and not the 
 grain mill.  Fortunately, I also sell the mash/lauter tun that makes all this 
 possible.


I think you mean boogyman, but in any event, I must agree that the crush
and the lautering system are interrelated.  If you have a very fine lautering
screen (like the [Ee]asy[Mm]asher), a finer grist is better, whereas if you
have a coarse lautering screen (like the Zapap) you need something more like
the "textbook" crush.  The "textbook" crush (which has been posted here
before) has a wide distribution of particle sizes.  Actually, I feel that
only the husk pieces need to be of various size, that the starch particles
of the grain can be of a consistent (and small) size.  Remember that with
a fine lautering screen, you don't really need to rely on the husks to
create your filter bed.  With a coarse lautering screen, the filter bed
must first be established (before which you would be recirculating your
runnings).  The establishment of the filter bed is basically the setting
up of a network of husk particles where the large ones (the ones that do
not fit through the lautering screen) are at the bottom, and on top of
this lattice of large husks you trap the smaller husks.


So why then not use a very small screen and crush the dickens out of the
malt?  There's one piece of information that is missing, namely that
Jack uses a very thin mash.  This is important because a stiff (thick)
mash would just sit there and not make it through the lautering screen.
You can carry porridge in a sieve, right?


So why not just use a thin mash all the time?  Well, this is up for
debate.  In some cases, it's not possible due to equipment constraints
(high-gravity beers, etc.).  I've read (in Noonan, I believe) that
a stiffer mash favors Beta over Alpha Amylase (could someone check this --
I might have it backwards).


Finally, a fine lautering screen would increase the importance of breaking
down the really gummy components of some mashes (like all the beta-glucans
in an Oatmeal Stout, for example).  If you don't do the protein rest
correctly, you can try to make a really thin oatmeal-containing mash, but
still have a glob of barley-flavored oatmeal with some amber water on top,
that will sit in your lauter tun till it turns to cement.

I have one of those handy brew kits you get for Christmas with the 6 gal.
carboy. I realized after my 1st batch that I was getting a lot of haze in my
beer so I thought I might strain it prior to bottling. What I came up with has
 been REALLY NICE! I used one of those reusable GOLD plated coffee filters
(you can get them at any fancy coffee shop). I setup my 2nd carboy underneath
the 1st and placed the filter inside of a funnel (perfect fit) and drained off
the beer from the top, up to the last inch of trub. The filter is coarse
enough that the beer gets through but fine enough that it catches all the crud
that's still floating about. Since I've gone to this, I have truly had nothing
but crystal clear beer!

 >Part of my reason for asking is that I might like to enter competitions
 myself, and I may also be interested in the AHA BJCP.  But observations like
 this make me wonder whether it would be worthwhile.
 
 Your comments provide the incentive to post my observations on the same 
 subject.  Last weekend, my wife and I had the pleasure of serving as 
 apprentice judges in a local competition.  I went with an attitude inclined 
 toward becoming a qualified judge and wanted to learn what it was all about.  
 We came home totally convinced that it is not our cup of tea for two reasons.
 
 First of all, it demands a great deal of time, is a lot of work, most of 
 which is very boring and unenlightening.  We did however, gain a very healthy 
 sense of gratitude for those dedicated individuals who are far less selfish 
 of their time and make competitions possible.
 
 The real objection however, is based on the program and not the people or the 
 results of the judging.
 
 It is preposterous to think that one can become a qualified judge of the very 
 large number of official styles, with the time and qualifications required by 
 the current program.  It is designed to create Jacks of all Trades and 
 Masters of none.
 
 The only way one should be qualified to act as a judge of other people's 
 beers is if he or she is truly an expert in the style.  The only way one can 
 become an expert in a style is to live with it for a significant period of 
 time.  Brew it, taste a wide range of commercial and homebrew versions and 
 essentially do nothing else for months.  At that point, the candidate should 
 be evaluated by another qualified expert in that style and this should 
 include the ability to identify a recognized sample of that style in a blind 
 tasting of mixed/similar styles.  Only then should that person be certified 
 to judge that style and only that style.
 
 This may sound like a lot of trouble and hassle but I humbly suggest that it 
 would be much more personally satisfying.  I would far rather be recognized 
 as an expert in a style than have the dubious honor of being a certified 
 judge.   I suspect many judges have done what I suggested but one never knows 
 who they are because they are all treated equally.
 
 It may also create problems with judging styles for which no qualified judge 
 happens to be present but the fallback position would be noting that point on 
 the score sheet.
 
 Like I said earlier, it's not the people or the results that bother me.  Our 
 light lager came in 2nd place and 4th best of show.  The problem is I don't 
 know what it means.  Last year we came in first, in the same catagory with a 
 much inferior beer.

 Just how does mashing-out produce consistent results.
 
 I agree that the reasons you quoted are not very rationial reasons for doing 
 a mashout but there is one reason that I think is a good one.  By raising the 
 whole mash 20 degrees or so, you stand a far better chance of keeping it in 
 the optimum range during the lautering process.
 
 It's easy enough to do for those who kettle mash but it is probably not worth 
 the trouble for the bucket infusers.

I of course would welcome acceptance into the esteemed BOQAT, but really, 
I feel the nomination is honor enough.  And I would like to state here, while
I have your attention and the pulpit, that although I have worked hard
though the years questioning what little authority I did not ignore, I am 
at heart just a little person, a regular guy, who has no wish to become a 
cultural icon and no wish to find the Emperor and/or his/her minions on my
doorstep late some rainy night in Seattle.  Also, my father is "Mr." 
Domenick Venezia, I'm just Domenick, Dom, Demonick, or Wop-man.

In all modesty I must admit to being an accomplished stone thrower myself,
and in my time have let rip with a world-class fart or two, though not in 
mixed company, and certainly, as far as I could control it, not in anyone's
general direction, and never, never, never into the wind.  My fashion sense, 
much to my parent's chagrin, leans toward the jeans and a tee-shirt look 
(kinda Joe Coolish B-), so I wouldn't feign to comment on the Emperor's new 
clothes except to say that s/he seems to like them and a lot of people 
follow her/his lead.  Really, I just want to brew a Fuller's ESB clone, the
easiest way possible and if that means no mash out, then by god, that's
what I'll do.  Or rather not do.  Mash out I mean.  Not do one. 


And a heartfelt thanks to Chris Campanelli (Happy Columbus Day, Paisano)
for the nomination, and without whom none of this would have been possible.


And finally, while looking up "feign" I came across -- well, anyone have a
recipe for farkleberry beer?


Should I apologize about the bandwidth?

One of my local brewing supply places, DeFalco's Home Wine and Beer Supply

I've got one, and the other thing that gives me problems sometimes is
the fact that it is much bigger around than a 5 gallon carboy.  This means
that I can't leave a keg in my fridge while the 7 gal carboy is in there.
A buddy of mine has a 6.5 gallon carboy that is taller than a 5 gallon, but
about the same diameter. That would work much better for me at times.

Hoorah for Domenick Venezia and Chris Campanelli (is this an Italian thing?)!!


I agree the Emperor's butt is showing; we have acessible now such nice grains
that anyone can go to Kmart, buy themselves a cooler (mein GOTT!) and mash. 
And they can omit about 24 of the 28 steps proposed by the Emperor's.  The
point to get across to extract brewers is that it's really pretty easy; sure
it's magical (rather than scientific, which it ain't), but that don't make it

Subject: Science and Hops Utilization 1/2


I realize this is a lot of post, but its only 1 day. Can't be that much of a
problem.


Use of Design-of-Experiments Techniques to Determine 
Controlling Factors Affecting Hops Utilization and Resulting 
Charactor.
- -----------
Fellow Brewing Scientists:
The recent discussions concerning which factors are most 
significant to the final Hop Charactor of the beer and how they 
can be manipulated by the homebrewer has brought to mind a 
company sponsered class I took recently, "Design of 
Experiments" (DOE). The methods taught in this class are used 
by industry and researchers to better define a process, by 
isolating and ranking the controlling factors that make up the 
process. These methods can also identify significant 
interactions between factors, such as Time and Temperature 
acceleration. The beauty of using DOE is that it allows 
significance and relationships of process factors to be 
determined with far fewer experiments than standard 
experimentation and scientific method. For example, let's say a 
process was made up of 4 variables and 2 values of each 
variable were to be tested. This would require 2 to-the 4th 
power or 16 experiments to examine each possibility. Using DOE, 
as many as 7 variables at two values could be examined 
simultaneously with only 8 experiments! Statistics allows the 
significance and relationships of the variables to be 
determined.


What I propose to do here is list the methods and tables 
necessary to perform 3 sets of DOE:  
1.  Determine factors for Alpha Acid Utilization during the 
Boil.
2.  Determine factors that affect Alpha Acids during 
Fermentation.
3.  Determine factors for Hop Oil Utilization during Dry 
Hopping in the Secondary.


The data measured from these experiments would be the parts per 
million (ppm) of the Alpha Acids or Hop Oils as determined by 
Liquid/Gas Chromatography. Since this equipment is not readily 
available, this work would need to be carried out at a 
University with the participation of an enthusiastic Homebrew 
club.  Perhaps Michael Lewis' class(es) at UC Davis would be 
interested.


DOE #1 - Utilization Factors During the Boil
- -----------------------------------------------
Factors to be evaluated:
A. Wort Gravity
B. Wort Volume
C. Time of Boil
D. Wort pH
E. % Alpha Acids of Hop
F. Amount of Hop
G. Interaction of Wort Gravity to Wort Volume


Two values would be tested for each of these factors. The test 
table will look like this (below) where Experiment Number is on 
the left, and Factors are across the top. The plus 1, minus 1 
indicate which value (high or low) for that factor will be used 
in that test. The table is rigid, interchange anything and it 
will throw the statistical analysis off. The Factor Columns are 
identified by the letters given to the Factors listed aboue.


      A    B    G    C    E    F    D
- -------------------------------------
1)   -1   -1    1   -1    1    1   -1
2)   -1   -1    1    1   -1   -1    1
3)   -1    1   -1   -1    1   -1    1
4)   -1    1   -1    1   -1    1   -1
5)    1   -1   -1   -1   -1    1    1
6)    1   -1   -1    1    1   -1   -1
7)    1    1    1   -1   -1   -1   -1
8)    1    1    1    1    1    1    1


Part I- Process Mean
Each test batch will be concocted by using a high or low level 
of the factor as the table dictates. Once the data (Alpha Acid 
ppm) is collected for each test, the data is averaged in the 
following manner:
1. Each Test that used the (low) value of Factor (A) would be 
averaged together to yield (Aavg(-1)). In this case, the data 
for Tests 1-4 would be used. Likewise, each Test that used the 
(high) value of factor (A) would be averaged to yield 
(Aavg(+1)). This would be tests 5-8. The other Factors would be 
averaged the same way. Ex. (Cavg(+1)) would be tests 2, 4, 6 
and 8.  
2. If two (or more) samples are tested from each batch, all of 
that data would be accounted for in the average. Ex. If three 
samples are analyzed from each Test Run (batch), then those 
values for Test run (7) would be averaged, i.e. ((7a + 7b + 7c) 
/ 3) and that average would be used to determine the overall 
average for that factor(value), as described in Step 1.
3. Also, determine the Total data average for all the test 
runs. EVERYTHINGavg  This will be used in the prediction 
equation later.
4. Next, for each factor, determine the DELTA between the 
averages of the High value and the Low value. Ex. (Aavg(+1)) - 
(Aavg(-1)) = Adelta.
Include the negative sign if High minus Low gives a negative 
number. Calculate deltas for the other Factors, also. This info 
would be used later in the Prediction Equation in Part III.
5. OPTIONAL STEP: Divide those deltas by two. This permits 
easier analysis if the numbers are large, that's all. It 
doesn't change the analysis results and may not be necessary 
depending on your numbers.
Example:
   run   A     B     C     M1     M2     Mavg  
   --------------------------------------------
   1    -1    -1     1     20     30     25    
   2     1    -1    -1     9      11     10    
   3    -1     1    -1     26     24     25    
   4     1     1     1     15      5     10    
   --------------------------------------------
Mavg(+) 10   17.5  17.5                        
Mavg(-) 25   17.5  17.5                   
Delta   15     0     0                     
Delta/2 7.5    0     0                     


6. Next, the Averages for each Factor(value) will be plotted as 
below. This allows the analyst to determine relative 
significance. I will plot a generic example, since we don't 
have any real numbers and the last example doesn't use enough 
factors. I WILL use this plot later to illustrate the analysis.


100 !                    #Plot 1#    
    !                                 
    !          *                      
    !            \                    
    !              *                * 
50  !                              /  
    !      *                      /   
    !    /             *---*     /          (first rate
    !  *                        /             plot, eh?)
    !                          *      
0   !___________________________________
       A-  A+  B-  B+  C-  C+  D-  D+  etc...


What this tells the analyst is that the data average moved 
positively for an increase to Factor A; negatively for Factor 
B; unchanged for Factor C; and very positively for Factor D. 
Factor C would seem to be insignificant to the process.

Controlling Factors Affecting Hops Utilization and Resulting 
Charactor.

Part II- Process Variability.
The next part of the analysis determines the Factors influence 
on Variability. The plot above, of course, looks at influence 
on Mean.
To perform the variability analysis, several trials of each 
experiment run would need to be performed, the data averaged, 
and a standard deviation for those trials of that run 
calculated. In this project, the extra data could be obtained 
by measuring several samples of the same batch of wort, or by 
preparing a few batches of each test run and testing each. The 
latter would be more statistically significant.


Here is an example data table for 3 factors tested at two 
values. M# refers to Measurement result. S is standard 
deviation of M1 and M2 of that run. Remember, the plus 1, minus 
1 only indicates whether a high or low value for that factor 
was tested.


run   A   B   C   M1   M2   Mavg   S
- ---------------------------------------
1    -1  -1   1   20   30   25    7.071
2     1  -1  -1   9    11   10    1.414
3    -1   1  -1   26   24   25    1.414
4     1   1   1   15    5   10    7.071


1. For each factor, the natural log of the standard deviation 
will be used in the following equation. A value will be 
calculated for each Factor(value) by using each run where that 
Factor(value) was used.
2. Avg ln(S A(+1)) = [ln (S run2) + ln (S run4)] / 2 
                   = [ln (1.414) + ln (7.071)] / 2 = 1.15
   Avg ln(S A(-1)) = [ln (S run1) + ln (S run3)] / 2 
                   = [ln (7.071) + ln (1.414)] / 2 = 1.15
(the simplicity and symmetry of the numbers of this example make this
 confusing, but bear with me)
3. Do this calculation for the other Factor(values) and 
generate the following table: where Avg Delta = Avg ln(S A(+1)) 
 - Avg ln(S A(-1))


             A        B      C
- --------------------------------
Avg (+)    1.15     1.15    1.95
Avg (-)    1.15     1.15    .35
- --------------------------------
Avg Delta    0        0     1.6


4. These results tell the analyst that Factors A and B have no 
effect on process variability, but that Factor C does have a 
significant effect. In other cases, Avg Delta for A and B may 
have been small- 0.2 and 0.6, let's say. Factor C would still 
be dominant at 1.6, but Factor B may also be significant to the 
process variability at 0.6.
5. IMPORTANT: If a factor's Mean analysis shows no significance 
(as in Factor C of Plot 1, a horizontal line) or small 
significance, it still may have High significance to process 
variability. Therefore, when optimizing the process, the value 
of that factor which gave the least variability should be used. 
In the case of the table above, (for Factor C) the Avg(-) value 
should be used, as it is the smaller number (smaller deviation) 
of the two for that factor. Thus Factor C should be utilized at 
the lower value in the process.


Part III - Prediction Equation.
The prediction equation allows you to predict the response of 
the process from a given combination of factors and values. 
Only the factors that have been shown to be signicant (either 
process Mean or Variability) are used. Values for the Factors 
can be chosen to either Minimize, Maximize or Target the 
response of the process.


Let's say we want to Maximize the response, get the best 
utilization from the boil. Going back to Part I, chose the 
values of the factors that gave the highest data average. In 
this case: A+, B-, D+, etc. Furthermore, let's assume that 
after doing the analysis per Part II, that Factor C (of the 
example in Part I) was shown to be significant to process 
variability and that value for least variability was C+. This 
would also be used in the following Prediction Equation.
(use the hypothetical Mean values of Plot 1: A+ = 40, B+ = 60, 
C+ = 32, D+ = 60; A- = 20, B- = 80, C- = 29, D- = 10) (Also 
note that for math example neatness, Factor C (line) is no 
longer horizontal, but slightly positive.)


                       Aavg(+) - Aavg(-) 
Best = EVERYTHINGavg + -----------------[A+/-] + 
                               2

FINAL NOTE:
Design of Experiments is rather complicated. What I have 
presented here is a basic use of the system. In the interest of 
bandwidth, I will not present the other two experiments for 
Primary and Secondary Fermentations. What would be done after 
all three phases of investigation were completed; each phase of 
Utilization- Boil, Primary and Secondary, would be compared to 
determine greatest significance to overall hop charactor. 
Indeed, another DOE could be run at that point to determine 
that relationship. If any Homebrew Clubs are up to the 
challenge, you can contact me by email for the rest of the 
info. Furthermore, I will enlist the help of the guy that 
actually taught the class, so that all your questions about 
applying DOE to this much debated problem can be better 
answered and investigated. Thank you for your patience,

Subject: calculating beer color


In a recent hbd, Tom Leith made a number of points on 
brewing to style.  I want to comment on one aspect of his 
comments, namely, calculating the color of beer.  To wit:  the 
linear math that we use to calculate the "expected" color of 
beer is wrong.  This point is made by George Fix in George 
and Laurie Fix's "Vienna" book.


As an example, Fix points out that Bass Ale is 10 Lovibond 
and Michelob Dark is 17 Lovibond.  Thus, these two beers 
serve as benchmarks for evaluating the color range from 
amber to dark copper, say.  


Suppose we look at a Vienna grain bill for a 5-gallon batch 
and its expected color:


9 pounds pilsner malt (1.78 L)         3.29
6 ounces crystal 10L                0.75
6 ounces crystal 60L                4.5
6 ounces crystal 120L                9


Total = 17.54L as the expected color.  Now, as a matter of 
fact, the above grain bill will produce a beer close to Bass Ale 
in color.  The linear color math is wrong, and overstates the 
expected color of the beer.


For light beers, linear color math is a useful approximation; 
for dark beers, it's more or less irrelevant; and for amber 
beers, it's wrong enough to matter.


As for the grain bill of brown ales, surely crystal malt should 
be featured for its color and flavor contributions.  Some 
chocolate malt, up to a level of a few ounces, would probably 
be okay.
