Subject: carboy handles (summary of [mostly non]responses)


A while back, I asked for first-hand negative experiences with "carboy
handles" (the plastic-cushioned wire-loop handles that attach to the necks
of carboys).  Put simply, "Has anyone ever seen one of these suckers snap
the neck off a carboy?"


The answer seems to be "no".  I'm sure a lot of us have heard some anecdotal,
urban-legend, FoaF horror stories, but I've heard no direct accounts of
failures.


I have to qualify that slightly: I did hear from one person who had put a
carboy handle on a 25-liter (6.5 gallon) carboy, and had seen some (my
interpretation) crazing around the neck.  It didn't actually break off, but
he was (justifiably) scared away from using it.  The reason I discount this
one data point is that the carboy handles are not designed to fit that size
of carboy.  Obviously they weigh more, but the main issue is that the neck
diameter is different.


5-gallon (and 3-gallon) carboys, the ones I've been able to check, are 2"
diameter (50-51 mm if you will) within about a mm.  The carboy handles are
designed to fit this; the point is that they need to fit snugly, but not
tightly, so that they hold a circle around the neck without generating any
local points of high stress.  (It's like picking up the carboy by the neck
with your thumb and index finger forming a circle.)  This requires that
they match the neck.  A 25 liter carboy has a neck diameter more like
59-60 mm, which is way more than a standard carboy handle can accommodate;
if you try to force it on, you'll probably end up overtightening it and
cracking the neck.


Summary:
  - This is reality.  I'm reporting results, not telling you what to do.
    If lawyers must be uncaged, they should be on a short leash.  All I'm
    saying is that nobody who responded had any failures with the handles
    on 3 and 5 gallon carboys.
  - A full carboy weighs a bunch; *any* sharp shock--regardless of whether
    a handle is involved--can break it. They are sturdy but not indestruc-
    tible, so be careful but not paranoid.
  - Remember, Mother Nature bats last.


If anyone has any useful evidence to add to this, I'll be glad to
accumulate it and report back.  ("It works for me" is not useful at this
point...because basically, they work for everyone so far.)

Hmmm...I think I'd be willing to trade either mead or barleywine for maple
syrup, even (1:1 vol)!


>...I have heard of people
> using this in beer and also using the uncooked sap instead of water...


I have had a maple-syrup mead that was nothing short of remarkable.  It was
one of those things where the mead-maker offered it tentatively, as "you
may find this a bit unusual but I think it's interesting"...I liked it
enough that the next time there was a general mead-tasting among friends,
I said "Be SURE you invite <Z> and tell him to bring a bottle of the
maple!!!"


It does seem to be one of those things that you either like or don't, no
middle ground.  If you don't like real maple syrup, you probably won't like
it.  (If you've grown up with imitation maple, you may well not like it.)
My wife is a Brit; she doesn't care for this mead at all.  But she looks
askance at various other new-world foods.


There's the usual mead-maker's dilemma, applying equally to beer here: 
"What will this incredibly-sweet raw substance taste like after there's NO
sugar left in it?"


I'd think the raw sap wouldn't do much.  Isn't the ratio for boiling-down
substantial, like more than >>5 (that is, 2^-5)?  This mead I'm talking
about used syrup at a rate somewhere between >>3 and >>4, so you wouldn't
get that sort of taste level using sap even if you used sap to replace ALL
of the brew water.  (I'm not sure how the difference between mead and beer
affects the situation here...some factors say you'd want more maple flavor
in beer, some say less.)


Maple in beer is obviously an idea with merit, worth exploring, but also
one that will require experimentation to figure out what works.  It seems
you'd want a relatively light (*not* lite!) beer, probably with more malt
and less hops than average, to let the tang of the maple come through with-
out getting swamped by the hops, and let the maple-sugar be accented by
the malt sweetness.  Add a fair bit of crystal?  Probably no really dark
grains.  This is intuition speaking--not direct experience, just back-
ground.

40 feet is excessive, 20 is minimal.  If you go with my suggestion here, 
that is, use 3/8 " tubing NOT 1/4, I have had good success with 30 feet.
Length isn't the only important variable, you also have to consider the
diameters of your inner and outer tubing, flow-rates, cold water temperature,
and so on.  Point is, you could probably get by with 10' if you really 
cranked up your cold water flow.  If you start going with too long of a tube,
though, some of the crud from the cold break can "gel" in your tubing and
really slow down the rate (recent potato and rye brews demonstrated this
to me).

I did the exact same thing on my FIRST try, without reading anything about
how to build one, etc...  It was a miserable failure, so I upped the diameter
of tubing from 1/4 to 3/8, and it works greaat.


As Usual:


   1)  Make sure the inside of your tubing is free of machine oils
       (mine was not)


   2)  I will supply free my online plans for building a wort chiller to 
       anyone who asks.

Subject: Boiling wort question


Hello:


        I have a question concerning how to properly boil wort.  I have 
noticed that often my O.G.'s are considerably lower than what are listed in 
similar recipes, even though I have been using the same quantity of 
fermentibles, and was wondering if I could be "overcooking" the wort.


        When I first started out, I would combine my extracts & water, bring 
to a boil, and leave on low heat for 1 hour.  Lately, I have been 
bringing the water to a boil first, then adding my extracts, returning to 
boil, and then continue boiling on high for 1 hour.  What leads me to think 
that I could be overboiling the wort is that (1) I tend to get a lot of 
gunk (i.e. extracts and malts) sticking to the bottom of the boiling pot, 
even with frequent stirring, and (2) after 1 hour, the level of the wort 
seems a bit lower than the starting level, and I tend to get about 44 
bottles out of a supposedly five gallon batch.


        My question to the wise homebrewers out there is this: once you 
bring the wort to a boil, do you reduce the heat to keep it at a low boil, 
or do you continue to go full blast on high heat?  Also, does it help to 
bring the water to a boil before adding the extracts, etc.?  As I noted 
above, the O.G. for my last batch were about 0.020 below what I thought 
it should have been, and while fermentation took place and all, the gravity 
fell from 1.030 to 1.010, which means that the alcohol content is also a 
bit lower than I had expected for this particular batch.


        Thanks in advance for any help.  The books that I have seen usually 
say something along the lines of "continue boiling for 1 hour," but I guess 
there could be degrees of boiling (no pun intended).

I have heard of a brew by the name of WILLIAM YOUNGER #3; read about it 
in a soccer magazine, actually.  In the mag article, the brew is 
described as "the ruin of a good many young men".  The article goes on to 
refer to the beer as the preferred brew of LAGER LOUTS, the British 
football hooligans we hear so much about.


Is there anyone who can tell me what the story is with this apparently 
British beer, i.e. what is the style, and where can one get it here in 
the States(if anywhere)?  I assume it's a bitter ale, but perhaps I am 
off the track here.  Can't wait to find out!!

Subject: UK hops


J.S. Hough ("Biotechnology of Malting and Brewing") lists a few
hops used in the UK.  I don't have access to them and haven't 
used them.  


            alpha


Target      11.5
Northdown   11.2 (seedless)
Yeoman      11.0
Challenger   9.8 (seedless)
Zenith       9.0


These hops are all modern hybrids developed at Wye College in Kent.
Fuller's ESB uses a blend of a number of them.  One reason for the
blend might be that these hops vary in their resistance to diseases
such as wilt, downy mildew, and powdery mildew.

You are correct about the gas mixture of the "beer mix" sold at
refill stores. It definitely cures the well known problem of eventual
overcarbonation when kegs are kept online for extended periods. I also
prefer the English ales and don't like the amount of carbonation that
is so common for American beers. The only drawback to the "beer mix"
is that you can't force carbonate your kegs. I have found that I
prefer to let my ales naturally carbonate, usually takes about 3
weeks, the gas bubbles in solution are very tiny and give a great
long lasting creamy head. I have found over the years that the
addition of 4oz of wheat malt to all my brews gives great head
retention. I'm never in need of having to wait for carbonation
to complete because I always have two kegs on tap with at least
2 kegs waiting to go on tap so my ales are always nicely aged by the
time they finally go on tap.


Smoked Ales:
I recently made a Pecan smoked porter that has turned out wonderfull!
I have a real smoker - where the fire pit sits off to the side of the
smoke chamber- and I smoked 2 pounds of Belgian Bisquit malt for one
hour. The temperature remained 110-120 F. I started 8 charcoal
briquets and when they formed a white ash layer I arranged them in a
double row and placed a one foot piece of pecan wood on top (be sure
that when you smoke anything that the wood does not have ANY remaining
bark attached as this will impart a very bitter flavor). I adjusted
my flues to maintain the temperature for one hour. The grain was then
removed and put into a bowl and covered until the next day when I
ground all the grain. The smoked flavor is not too subtle and not too
overpowering and blends very well with the recipe of my favorite
porter. I just kegged it so it will be awhile before it gets rotated
in line to the taps, there are two kegs ahead of it - one is a
raspberry ale using the extract from Hoptech.

Well Dave my counterflow chiller (about a month old) is only slow when my
choreboy (in the kettle) gets clogged with hops (I'm going to shy away from
pellets whenever I can in the future).  The normal, unclogged rate is about 5
gallons in 25 minutes, if memory serves.  The difference is that mine is made
with 3/8" copper tubing, not 1/4".  This is considerable.  When mine slows
down (choreboy cloggage), I turn the cooling water down to a trickle.  The
last time this happened it took less than 10 gallons of water to cool 5
gallons of wort to pitching temperature (but it took over an hour).  Oh, mine
is only 30 feet long and it does a wonderful job.  I suspect I could get away
with a shorter one.  I suggest one of three routes: 1) take it apart and
replace the 1/4" tubing with 3/8" tubing, 2) cut it in half to make two
chillers in parallel, or 3) change it to an immersion chiller (these work very
nicely).  The problem with 2) is that the plumbing is guaranteed to get real
interesting.


Dave goes on talk about other chiller hurdles:

I don't have a hop-back but my kettle has a ball valve mounted at the bottom.
I have copper tubing compression fittings to attach my chiller directly out
of the bottom of the kettle.  Since my kettle tap is not exactly at the bottom
of the kettle I use a small brass elbow on the inside of the kettle and it
takes wort almost directly off the bottom of the kettle (very little losses).
Anyway, it is all gravity fed and works like a charm.  I don't know about
hop-backs and such, I'm a low tech (in this respect) dry-hopper.


Joel asks about draining the first runnings, adding sparge water, and draining
again to simplify his sparge.  This works fine, Joel.  If it is easy for you,
do it.  You might even try 3 of these "batch sparges" for more efficiency.  The
only drawback I can think of is that you are losing the original runnings right
away, which help buffer the goods.  It is possible your pH will drop more
quickly during the subsequent sparges, requiring acidification of the sparge
water to avoid tannin extraction.  I've never really had a problem with it
(i.e. no astringent beers) but I don't take my sparges too far.  I usually get
25-27 points which indicates there is a fair amount of sugar and other stuff
left in the grist, which I presume maintains the pH (not a lot of measuring
going on).

Subject: Batch Sparging


Joel Birkeland in 1245 asks about batch sparging.  It is my understanding
that this is the old fashioned way of doing it.  In past times the
first runnings would make a big beer, the second runnings (after
resuspending the mash) a normal beer, and the third runnings - a 
mediaeval version of Bud Light.


The reason for continuous sparging is that it is more efficient, and 
doesn't have the problem of resetting the bed, but for homebrew purposes
I am sure there would be little problem.  Or alternately get a big 
picnic cooler that you can fill with all of your sparge water.

amino acids containing sulphur are decayed - and well, fermentation is
really controlled food decay.

 "Every" and "broadly" are the key words here and I won't argue with them but 
 my point was that I would rather have my beer judged by an expert in that 
 catagory.

 I already acknowledged that presumption.  The problem arises from the fact 
 that many can not.

 Fostering doth not equate to create.  The key here is palate.  The other 
 aspects can be memorized in a few hours but palate takes years to develop and 
 my guess is that very few judges have it to a confidant degree of certainty.  
 This is obvious from the "negotiating" that goes on AFTER they have arrived 
 at their own opinion.

 Sounds like I hit a nerve.  That's certainly a step in the right direction

 rational to qualify experts up front of the overall certification and it 
 would fill the ranks of experts much faster.

 Obviously welding is out of the question, and I imagine that
 chipping/splintering of the enamel would be a problem too, but are there any
 fittings (perhaps an o-ring or a compression type) that will be strong, seal
 well, and still hold up to the rigors of boiling wort?
 
 Not sure what a "Slotted T drain" is but if you use a spigot with a male 
 thread and a female connector on the inside, you can make a leakproof 
 compression fit.  The only hooker is you have to rethread them with
 straight threads as they are normally supplied with tapered pipe threads.
 Drilling holes without chipping is not a problem as long as a small pilot 
 hole is drilled first.

 >1)  Is a continuous sparge really necessary?  Has anyone tried just
 draining all of the mash liquor out of the tun, refilling with the
 sparge water all at once, letting it sit, and then draining it?  Since
 I use a easymasher of the Schmidling design, re-establishing the filter
 bed would not really be a problem.  This seems to me to be much easier
 than monitoring the flow from my sparge vessel into the mash for
 half an hour.
 
 What seems intuitive is not always so.  Someone posted an article a year or 
 so ago that explained it in terms so simple, that even I could understand, 
 why this is not so.
 
 It has to do with the gradual dilution effect and that the grain is always 
 meeting up with a differential between it's remaining sugar and the disolved 
 sugar in the sparge water.  The greater this differential is, the more sugar 
 will be removed.
 
 It is also easy to see that in the last batch, after stirring the water and 
 mash, the whole liquid will arrive at some gravity.  When the liquid is 
 drained, the liquid held by the grain will be that gravity and that sugar is 
 lost.  By continually sparging, the gravity of the liquid left in the grain 
 will be that of the last running and of no interest.

Actually, it sounds like all the mills, with the exception of the original

I can vouch for the speed and quality of the current MM design, having purchased
one of the first with the knurled roller.  I am sure one can crush 1lb in 14 
seconds with the hand crank, but my arm falls off when doing 20lb crushes and 
I take much longer, say 30 sec/lb.

I agree that grit size and uniformity is more important than husk damage.  
this is most true about modern 2-row grains.  I have personally used
two lauter designs: a perforated false bottom and a slotted copper manifold.
In both cases too fine a grind is a disaster regardless of the quality of
the husks.  The problems are two fold.  First the flour tends to ball up
and make a dough that is dry inside.  This occurs during mash in and is a 
royal pain to get rid off.  I have seen folks try to avoid this by mashing 
in a little grain at a  time, stirring vigorously between additions.  Still
when fully mashed in, those pesky balls of dough continue to float to the 
surface.  Second problem is the stuck sparge.  I had never seen one until
I used a roller mill that was set way too close (.025") and the sparge locked
up after a couple quarts.  No dribble, nothing.  Just like the valve had been
closed.


The malt mill I have produces a course crush (e.g. looks like cornmeal) with
pretty much intact husks.  I have lautered a 15.5 lb mash and recovered 11.5 
gallons of 1.046 wort in 20 minutes.  That is .034pt/lb/gal for you guys
interested in the efficiency game.  Since it was a pils, using only pils
malt, the number wasn't too unexpected.  


I guess my point is that with modern, fully modified malts (Please, can
anyone point me to a commercially available malt that isn't?) fine crushes
DON'T GAIN YOU ANYTHING but problems.  Look at malt specifications: they
describe the difference between course and fine crush extract yeilds. 
typically the difference is 2% or less.  Smaller numbers are indicators of
higher quality (and degree of modification).


So, to summarize: any of the mills mentioned in the Crush off should 
work fine.  I have used homemade roller mills, coronas, corona knockoffs
the malt mill and converted coffee grinders.  The only one that was
consistently bad was the coffee grinder.  All others could be adjusted
to produce great crushes fast lauters and excellent extracts.

This is a gross simplification.  Malt contains more than husk, starch and
enzymes.  All the gums, protein, cellulose, etc. are best left in matrix
rather than trying to filter them out.

This is only a cartoon. Had this been a real graph there might be data
to support it.  Take it as you will- can you speak "hypothetical?"


With a low starting population the lag time before exponential growth
is lengthened.  It is during this period that the greatest danger 
of infection exists.  A high starting population will result in a narrower
growth curve, whereas the smaller pop. will grow slower, for a longer time.
It is reasonable to believe that the small init. pop will never acheive the
maximum population of the high start.


There are definite benefits to a high starting population, and definite 
disadvantages to a slow start.  I can't imagine you could "overpitch" a 
wort- unless you collected the yeast from ten brews and added inadequate
fermentables to make them live.  If the yeast run out of nutrients they
may turn to unfavorable metabolic pathways.  But I'd be inclined to think
that if you supply a full bodied wort and sufficient aeration to the number 
of yeast collected from as much as a 1 gallon starter will do no harm.


A good process for growing up a starter- 
I use a 200 ml starter of about 020 sp gr. for a colony from a plate.
For a liquid yeast- say a 500ml initial starter.  Same sp. gr.
Grow this for a day or two.  Let settle- Collect yeast sediment, add to
a fresh wort of a slightly higher sp. gr.  say 030 in a larger volume-
500 ml (culture),  800 ml (liquid).  Grow up 1 day. Till active ferment.
Brew Day:  Take some of the wort from the sparge and boil quickly. Cool
and combine starter with equal volume of fresh wort.  By the time the boil
and cool are done this will be active.  Cool wort and pitch.  You should
get a good start.  
Stepping up the volume and strength of the starters will allow the yeast
to both increase in number and acclimatize to the brew gravity.
