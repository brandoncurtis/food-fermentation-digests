It's past harvest time for most hop growers and the '93 crop is
available for purchase at most locations. It seems that one can still
get '92 hops at a really good price since most vendors want to unload
them.


Would anyone know what percent of Alpha Acid has been lost in the
1992 crop, assuming they were stored under optimum conditions? I just
purchased about a pound and would like to adjust my recipes.

I believe it's the Niagara Brewing Co. of Niagara Falls, Ontario
that brews a 'Maple Wheat' beer.  It's around 8 percent alcohol
by volume (if memory serves).  This may be to ensure some
residual sweetness.  The maple flavour is definitely subdued,
and mostly detected in the finish.  A nice enough beer, but
not something I'd go out of my way for (it's fairly pricey too),
but then I've never been big on strong beers.
Perhaps I should get a bottle to refresh my memory re: specifics
of its flavour, etc.
Cheers, Rick C.

I've had good luck using a mix of bleach and TSP to clean real grungy
bottles. Make some with real hot water and soak overnight. By morning
most of the lables usually fall off. Some bottles are real tough though
namely, Legacy lager. They get real slimy.

Pardon?  Unless the AHA styles are even more bizarre than I recall,
Younger's No. 3 is nowhere close to a Scottish Export.  It's more like
a strongish dark mild or a mildish/sweetish porter.

McEwan's Export definitely isn't the same beer as Younger's No. 3.
Although they're both brewed by Scottish & Newcastle in Edinburgh,
the former has OG 1046 and is a dark amber color, and the latter is
OG 1043 and dark brown.  Roasted barley vs. crystal malt, I'd say.


I don't know if the IPA is the same or not.  I'm not very impressed
by any of S&N's pasteurized products, so if I have seen the IPA
around I probably just ignored it... :^)

Subject: Belmont Brewing Co.




   I have to respond to Mark's comments about the Belmont Brewing
Company.  Let me first admit that while the BBC is one of my favorite
brew pubs, it's mostly because of the location (which is ON the beach
with a fabulous view) and the fact that it is only a 20 minute walk
from my house ;-).  In this light, I'd mostly just like to take the
edge off of some of Mark's comments.


   As far as the food is concerned, it's unfortunately very variable.
The pizzas are all good as is the tortellini with sausage.  The chicken
and mushroom pasta is very bland.  This regrettably leaves very few
choices.  The food, in my opinion, is the BBC's weakest link.


   Now to the beer.  Mark is essentially correct and the beer varies a
little more in quality than it probably should.  The Marathon is to be
avoided.  It is VERY light, and doesn't have enough body or taste to
cover the minor errors which are obviously made with this beer.  The
Strawberry Blond is a Marathon with much too much strawberry flavor.
Cut the berries back a little and you'd have a fine specialty beer, with
the berries covering up some of the problems with the Marathon.  Then
again, they may just be making what people want.  They sell a lot of it.
Order a glass rather than a pint.


   The Sail Ale (not mentioned by Mark) is excellent and is my favorite.
It is described as a pale ale, but it's really more in the Blue Heron
tradition (as opposed to Bass) and is almost, but not quite, an IPA.
(BTW, I hear Bridgeport is thinking about maybe considering the
possibility of sending some of their production from their new
facilities to CA.  Oh please, God, I'll do ANYTHING...  Any real info on
this out there?).  The Crude is also very good, but could be a little
more distinctive.


   Also, I disagree with Mark in that I have always found the BBC's beer
to be a little over-hopped.  Haven't been in a month or so; maybe
they're trying to widen their market by dropping their hop rate.  I also
haven't noticed excessive yeastiness, except maybe in the Marathon which
is always cloudy.


   Concerning prices, I think they are comparable to other restaurants
in the area.  After all, this is L.A. (more or less) and they are on
the beach.  I've always found the service to be better than average.


   There are other points in the BBC's favor, but I think I'll just
say that they've been very consistent, and gotten consistently better,
since they opened.  Two of their four beers are very good and the view
is worth the trip.  Don't write them off completely.


   Mark made one comment that really didn't sit right with me, and that
was his description of the BBC as trendy.  I won't say that it isn't,
because I'm not exactly sure what he means, but don't ALL brewpubs
"cater specifically to trend followers"?  At still less than 1% of the
national beer market, I'd have to say that ALL brewpubs and micros could
be said to fall into the "trend" category.  And if fruit beers are a
trend, then I'm all for being trendy.  If the decor is what Mark meant
by "trendy" (oak, brass, a few plants, fish tank), remember they have an
ocean view and want to show it off.  They necessarily have a lot of
glass.  A traditional English pub would be better off somewhere else.
Besides, who would begrudge a yuppie (do they still exist?) a good beer
once and awhile?  They're misguided maybe, but not evil.  (Buttweiper is
the ugly side of brewing, if you ask me.)  I have a feeling I know what
Mark's next L.A. area brewpub review is going to be like.  No slam
intended, I just don't think he's going to find what he's looking for.


   Mark is really on pretty firm ground as I know others who don't care
too much for the BBC.  On the other hand, I know a lot more people that
do.  So, is the BBC worth the trip?  I think so.  Is it worth a repeat
visit?  That depends on how far you live from Hopland.

P.S.  While I'm here, I'd like to make a request:  No more b*g*yman,

the area of brewing (trub, anyone?).

Subject: Maple in beer and wort chiller length


For what it's worth, Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic claims to use maple syrup to 
balance the tartness of the cranberries.


Please, let's not start again with the Koch bashing.  I'm simply passing on 
some info about the use of maple syrup in a commercial beer.


Someone asked about appropriate length for a wort chiller.  When this was 
asked awhile ago, I dug out my copy of the Chemical Engineers' Handbook and 
posted some equations.  You can probably find it in the HBD archives.  You 
need to make some assumptions and decide on the maximum amount of time you 
want to spend in cooling the wort to come up with a length.

OK, I'll be the heretic.  Hey, new brewers!  DON'T worry about oxidation
when transferring to secondary.  The beer is cool and saturated
(probably supersaturated) with CO2.  If it foams a little when you
transfer it there is virtually no way it will oxidize, because CO2 is
coming out.  If it doesn't foam when you transfer it it was probably in
primary too long and you migh as well bottle it.  I can't see any harm
in what is described here.  Filering hot wort is one thing, filtering
cool fermenting beer is something entirely different.


Relax, have a homebrew, and shove that nasty ol' oxidation bogeyman back
in the closet where it (usually) belongs.

Subject: hot priming


When I prime my fermented beer with corn sugar, I usually cool the priming
solution to 70F with an ice bath before mixing with the beer.  
(Egads !  I've just publically admitted to both priming and use of corn sugar.
There goes my chances of CamRA membership !)  


I've always thought that this step is probably not necessary since the 
thermal mass of 1 pint of 200F sugar water is nothing compared with 5 
gallons `at` 70F.  So what if I zap a few yeast cells on the initial contact ?  
They don't have very good lawyers anyway.


I've never had the guts to actually risk a batch with this hot combination
experiment.  Has anyone else done this successfully ?  I'd like to 
simplify my process.


Thanks,
Bart

Sorry Ken, it isn't that simple.  Not only is pH logrithmic, the change 
of pH depends on the composition of the solution to be adjusted.  The 
information you get from Merck Index, Handbook of Chem & Physics etc. will 
all be for distilled water.  The dissolved things in tap water (metals, 
salts, minerals, organics, etc.) may buffer the water to some extent.  
Buffering means that the pH is *more resistant* to change, ie. more acid 
is needed to effect a pH drop.

Both of Ken's statements make good chemical sense.  Remember 88% lactic 
acid can cause *serious* burns if splashed on bare skin.

Subject: Jim Koch won't shut up!


Having visited the 1993 GABF, and enjoyed the news that Boston Beer Company did
not win any gold medals, I was dismayed to read the following in "The Brew
Review" (copied without permission, so sue me.  No wait, how about 30 lashes
with a siphon hose?):


"GABF CONTINUES NEGOTIATIONS WITH BOSTON BEER COMPANY"


"Boston Beer Co. has changed their promotional print and point of sales printed
material to comply with the new GABF post-event publicity rules.  However,
Boston Beer Co. intends to continue its non-complying radio advertising,
promoting its late 1980's wins in the Consumer Preference polls.  For the
purposes of avoiding litigation, the Rules Committee has voted to allow the
Boston Beer Co. to participate in the 1993 Festival, in spite of its use of
radio advertising statements regarding Consumer Preference poll awards that do
not meet post-event publicity rules.  The decision was made based on
anticipated agreements and compliance in 1994.  However, the Rules Committee
continues to condition all brewery's participation, including the Boston Beer
Co.'s, in the GABF on compliance with the post-event publicity rules with
respect to any reference to Festival medal awards."


Unfortunately, it sounds like BBC's lawyers have won this round through
coercion and the threat of lawsuits.  Every brewery in the country appears to
be complying with GABF rules except BBC.  This hits me the wrong way.  I have
to admit I continued buying BBC products from time to time because I like the
beer, though I always disliked the business practices (I'm so ashamed).  This
is the last straw, though, and I join the chorus here and now:


BOYCOTT BBC!!!

Yes.  Remember, George these are my own opinions and you could get a dozen
answers to some of these questions.  The equipment list I gave is a minimum.
Things like a larger pot, a hydrometer, bottle washer, hop bags, etc. could
be considered up front as well.  If you get as hooked as the rest of us,
you'll soon be buying more "stuff", which has been defined as anything you
can use in homebrewing.  "Junk" is defined as anything you thought could be
used in homebrewing but can't.  At least that's how I heard it.


***


Matthew Bohne asks about using kits or not.  I recommend you disregard brewing
kits in general because there are so many good beginning recipes out there.
They are easily done, and make better beer.  TNCJHB and other books are loaded
with them.  Boil or not?  _ALWAYS_ boil, just watch the boilovers.  Don't boil
grains, though, strain them out.  BTW, Imperial Stouts are a fairly bitter
product, with the alcohol bite, the dark grains, etc.  (actually, I don't know
if "bitter" is an accurate descriptor) Maybe you don't like Imperial Stouts.

Eric Feris asks about tun construction (but makes the mistake that he's talking
to "experts" here).  Eric, this is another place that you could get about 1735
different answers, depending on people's experiences, investments $$$'s, time,
etc.  I use a 48 quart rectangular cooler as a mash / lauter tun.  It has a
copper manifold in the bottom which looks like this (bottom view):

There are numerous small slots cut into the pipe (1/2") with a hacksaw.  The
slots are on the bottom, away from the grain bed.  The pipe drains out the hole
in the cooler and makes a perfect fit with the gasket sold with the cooler.
Another way to do it is Jack's method, which is a single pipe with a piece of
SS screen over the end to keep grain out of the pipe.  In both cases the grain
does the filtering, the "manifolds" only serve to pick up the liquid.  One
thing that needs clarification:  if you build a mash/lauter tun from a cooler
(an inexpensive option) you cannot add heat to it easily.  Nobody I know has a
heating element in their cooler tun, although its not impossible.  Jack and
some others mash in a kettle on the stove, which is handy for adding heat.  A
large SS pot is way more expensive than a cooler, but a cheap canning pot could
be used.  For simple infusion mashes (one temperature) I don't need that
capability.  I add 1 quart of 170F water for each pound of grain in the cooler
and it settles out around my mash temperature 152-154F.  Here it is being used
as a mash tun.  After conversion, I start sparging and it is being used as a
lauter tun.  I see no need for separate tuns.  Good luck in your tun
construction; for me, it is almost as fun as brewing.

Yes, just tried it this past Tuesday night.  Not bad stuff, IMO.  To me, it

I have filtered a little bit of beer.  I still dont filter most of 
my beer.  Yeast cells are around 5-10 microns, so a 5 micron filter
will remove most if not all of the yeast.  I would avoid the filters
sold in HW stores, they will be poor in efficiency, and basically 
become a $4 one shot deal.  I have used one as a one shot deal for
a real coarse filtering to remove hop pellets.  Invest in a reuseable
5 micron polypro filter from the filter store, 1-800-828-1494. Costs
about $25, good for at least 200 gallons.  Filter flat beer, then 
force carbonate.  Filtering has no effect on carbonation provided you
use forced CO2.


If you want to remove protein haze, and reduce head retention, you can
buy a sterile filter of .5microns, but it will cost ~$32.


Good brewing,
Jim Busch

Subject: Mashout


As I recall, the Great Mashout debate started with a question about the
necessity of killing off enzymes at the end of mashing.  It has now taken
a turn into sparging technique.


I would most humbly and obsequiously submit that stuck sparges and
denaturing enzymes are different critters.


How one handles their sparging is dependent on a large number of
variables:  types of grain, crush, mechanical details of the mash/lauter
tun, even (yes) temperature.  Of all of these, the mechanical details of
the mash/lauter tun are probably going to be the most influential for
beers made from mostly barley malt.  High proportions of gooey, floury,
pasty sticky grains will make the details of the sparging setup even more
important.


At the risk of becoming highly technical, allow me to submit the following
High-Tech (tm) illustration:


   |XXXXXXXXXXX|
   |XXXXXXXXXXX|
   |XXXXXXXXXXX|    <- Container full of cooked grass seed and water
   |XXXXXXXXXXX|
   |XXXXXXXXXXX|
   |- - - - - -|    <- The perforated thingy
   |________ __|
           | |      <- The place where the watery stuff falls out


There are a great number of different sizes and shapes of containers to
hold the cooked grass seed:  garbage cans, Alaskan (and the smaller
Texas-size) construction helmets, kitchen sinks, nail kegs, buckets, foot
basins, Rhode Island swimming pools, water beds, etc.  Likewise a great
number of perforated thingies are also used:  soil pipe, panty-hose (both
used and new), buckets that have been used for target practice, hair-nets,
old socks, venetian blinds, storm grates and clever specially designed
appliances that are made in Mexican sweat-shops and then marketed here
with cheesy little "Made in USA" stickers on them.


Most people use some kind of hose where the watery stuff falls out, though
in very backward areas (such as Chicago and San Francisco), it is just
allowed to fall on the floor.  This "drop and mop" technique is claimed to
yeild incredibly high extract rates. 


Given the large range of equipment in use, it seems only reasonable to
this author that there will be some variation in practice, including
adjusting the temperature of the cooked grass seed before trying to get
the watery stuff to fall out the hole in the bottom.  What this has to do
with killing off the enzymes (which look like little people in tights with
Pac-Man heads according to one widely published work) continues to elude
me.  I personally don't like to do it, because their pitiful little
screams upset me.  Others with harder hearts may choose to do differently.

Although the orange carboy caps are too large for the 7 gallon

Another option here is to use the 3/8" coper tubing.  It can be
shaped, is nearly indestructable, 
sterilized by heat by baking in the oven, and is exactly the
same size as the plastic ones sold in homebrew stores.


For those asking about DME effects on specific gravity, 1 pound of
DME in 1 gallon of water yealds an SG of about 1.042.  Therefore,
for example 1 pound added to 6 gallons of water will increase the
SG by .042 / 6 = .007 points.

Hello,
 
I missed the COPS episode ala Elliot Ness cracking down on the hapless
homebrewer.  I agree with Russell Gelinas that homebrewers should take an active
role in educating whenever the opportunity arises, I question the practicallity
of a nationwide PR campaign.  Perhaps, thinking globally and acting locally
would serve the purpose better.  Local brewclubs can advertise events in local
media & maybe get some newspaper/tv exposer to boot.  Clubs could draft letters
or complaint to deliver to both the local station airing COPs and the shows
producers.  The AHA could do some PR work, having pr/information experts and
spokespersons ready to field reporter queries or to provide talking head sound
bites to local or national tv crews.  But to publicize outside of addressing the
producers of COPS and the local stations that televised the program could be
misguided.  How many people saw the show?  How many people even remember seeing
the show?  Unless there is a groundswell of prohibitionist fervor threatening
your home brewer or local supply store, any negative publicity or perputuated
misunderstandings is probably over-rated.
 
Well, off my soap box and into the kitchen...Banana esters.  I have a brown ale
with slight banana esters (used Yeast Labs British Ale).  Are these esters a
regular characteritic of the yeast, a result fermentation at 69-73 F ambient, or
both?
 
While I'm in the kitchen, is there any chance at all I could brew an extract
dopplebock & lager it in a cool basement on a concrete floor?  I want to make a
dopplebock for a gradutation party "The Matriculator" but I don't have a spare
'fridge to lager the bottled products.  Has anyone tried this?  Any minimum
temps. I should pray for?  The current temp. ranges from 59-62F and I it should
get cooler as the sun wanes.
 
Thanks for any comments and advice concerning homebrew pr and bananas and
dopplebock.

Thanks for the explanation, Tony.  I appreciate your response, but
I guess I mis-stated my question.


What I was interested in was why this particular batch should smell
like H2S.  I used Wyeast 1056, which is what I have used quite a bit
in the past, without any H2S smell.  The only thing I changed was the 
malt, which was DeWolf-Cosyns Pale malt.  The yeast starter did not 
smell like H2S, but the primary fermentation did.  This leads me to
speculate that it is not the yeast, but rather something to do with
the formulation of the wort.


Any takers?

Without checking TJOHB for the reference, it sounds as though your
problem was adding "flaked maize to my wort".  Did you really add it to
your wort? and when did you do an iodine test?


If you're adding flaked maize to an extract-based beer, try doing a
little infusion before adding the syrup.  Take your flaked maize, et al,
put it in a cheesecloth bag and soak at about 150F for 1/2 hour or.
Then rinse it with hot water, save the resulting liquor, and add your
extract to that.  Flaked maize shouldn't cause *any* problems with
starch; in fact, George Fix recommends adding it late during the mashing
cycle in an all-grain beer.


How does Charlie phrase it? "Chill out and suck some brew"?

  If the maximum percentage of alcohol allowed in a beer distributed to

I'd always seen 151 rum added atop the Amaretto to aid lighting. And let me
