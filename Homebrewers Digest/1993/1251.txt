Wow, supersaturated beer out of the primary??  How do you accomplish this,
with a pressure tank, and bunging with 3+ Palto of residual extract?  Wont
this cause the carboy to explode :-)  Seriously, fermented beer when young
will have around 1 atmosphere of CO2 in solution.  While this will rise
out of solution as the beer is racked, the original posters experience 
with a filter is certainly going to introduce some degree of oxidation. 
A small degree of splashing into the secondary is OK, putting it through
a filter/funnel is sure disaster.  Its just not worth it, or necessary.

Ooops,  I forgot to add this to my last post.


Are there any negative effects from using brass fittings in boiling wort? 
I'm 
thinking in particular of a brass Swagelok (sp?) bulkhead fitting.  (Thanks
Joel for the bulkhead tip)


Also, is it safe to assume that a ball valve attached directly to the kettl
e 
would be effectively sanitized by heat conducted from the kettle.  I'm
thinking 
of using an immersion chiller, so hopefully all I have to do to avoid
worrying 
(heaven forbid) about infection is to  attach a sanitized hose to the end of 
the ball valve and drain merrily into the fermenter.


Any comments?


Thanks in advance.

Subject: Liquid Yeast: Friend or Fiend?


Greetings,


Long time listener, first time caller.  I'm afraid that this will have to do
with deep philosphical questions, and therefore I may later regret having
brought it up at all.  But here goes...


I usually ferment my wort with dry yeast, usually with good and reliable 
results.  Periodically, I will use WYeast, particularly when I intend to make 
several consecutive batches of similar beers, as reusing the yeast slurry 
becomes economical.  Such was the case over the weekend.  I was to make a basic 
pale ale on Saturday morning.  I had gotten a WYeast American Ale packet, and
burst the inner packet on Thursday evening.  Sure enough, by noon on Saturday
it was nice and puffy.  My 1043 wort was at 70F, and all was well with the
world.  So, I sanitize the yeast package in bleach water, rinse it off, 
cut it open, drop liquid into the wort, cap it and swirl it up.  I then
wait for fermentation to begin, but lo! nothing happens and keeps on not
happening until Monday morning.


So far, a dull story.  But the reason for the post is that this the third time
in four instances of liquid yeast use that this happened to me.  The questions
I have are:


Why does this happen?  Up until the instant that I introduce the yeast to the
wort, it behaves as advertised.  After pitching, it appears to literally die.
I will note that all of the worts that have been victim to this behavior have
been revived with dry yeast, and all were completely acceptable, at least to me.


Why does liquid yeast seem so my less robust than dry?  This is the thing
that I wonder most, since as noted above all of my liquid yeast failings
have had dry yeast added and gone on to ferment properly.  Also, I have never
had a wort not ferment after I pitched dry yeast.


Should this happen when I use the liquid yeast _as_directed_on_the_package?
It's not as if I'm just dumping yeast straight from the fridge to the wort.
I know the perceived wisdom hereabouts is to make a starter of some sort,
but WYeast's package says that I should be able to do what I did and get
fermentation.


Should I just admit abject failure and use dry yeasts exclusively?  By 
extension, will I make a beer with "666" tatooed on its forehead if I reuse 
the slurry from a batch fermented with dry yeast?


Any suggestion is appreciated.

Subject: re:Hard Cider Recipes




Since there have been a few inquiries about hard cider lately, here are some 
cider making ideas from the northeast:


A friend of mine usually puts up a couple of 55 gallon wooden kegs each 
fall with 40 lbs of brown sugar in each. I believe the sugar is dissolved 
in a pan of warm cider then added to the keg. A rubber bung/ air lock is 
inserted and he waits for spring. The slower it works off, the better. A temp 
of 55 to 40 is ideal.


Other traditional recipes use pears or raisins, or both. Basically you can add
anything which will give the wild apple yeasties more to eat and impart a
flavor to the cider. You may opt to not add anything, which will render a very
dry cider.


My method involves using green 1 gal wine/vinegar jugs. With these small 1 gal
amounts you can experiment and not worry about ruining a whole batch. They also
work off quicker than larger batches. Check with local restaurants about saving
you some. Sterilize, use a rubber stopper/air lock and keep out of sunlight.


My favorite recipe uses 1 gal of cider with 1 rounded cup of brown sugar. Place
in cool basement and wait 8-12 weeks. We've also used canned tropical fruit, 
molasses, raisins, white sugar, corn sugar, DME, frozen cranberry juice... 
experiment!


Cider can be bottled in champagne bottles, Grolsh style bottles or plain beer
bottles. If you bottle early, you can get a sparkling cider. We've used cork
and regular bottle caps successfully. Dont disturb the sediment when siphoning.


Then there's always the possibility of making apple-jack, which is freezing 
hard cider. The water solidifies around a core of alcohol, very potent indeed.


One last note to those who may not know, its important to purchase cider 
without any preservatives (pot sorb), or better yet go to a cider mill. They 
will usually charge less if you have you own container, and even less if you 
bring you own apples. Our local mill is cira 1905 and makes fine cider.


good luck,  and watch out for those cida-ffects - mike

Subject: Poly Hose


I just bought a thick-wall polyethylene hose to run from my lauter tun to my
boiler.  The hose I use now is a thin-wall vinyl hose which has a tendency to
collapse when the hot liquor is flowing through it.  Any experience with this
PE hose?  It is quite stiff, compared to the vinyl, translucent (similar to
the vinyl after coming in contact with boiling wort), and has almost a waxy
feel to it.  Also, it is rated for a fair amount of pressure, but says nothing
about temperature.  Use it or lose it?

jclayton`at`TACOM-EMH1.Army.Mil (CLAYTON Joseph A Jr) asks about gravity
equations:


>As an avid user of equations and a terrible deriver of equations, I'd
>like to be able to solve for any one of the three factors, quantity of
>malt extract, volume of water, and O.G.


My equation is OG = 1 + #pounds of stuff / #gallons of wort * .042 for
dry extract, and


        OG = 1 + #pounds of stuff / #gallons of wort * .036


for liquid extract.


The 0.42 and the 0.36 is the "extraction rate" of dry and liquid
extracts.


This works backwards to get:  (OG-1)/.042 * #gallons = pounds of DME
needed


For more complicated recipes, we can add the result of several
factors:


OG = 1 +(#pounds of material "a" * extraction rate of material "a" +
         #pounds of material "b" * extraction rate of material "b" +
         #pounds of material "c" * extraction rate of material "c" +
         ...) / # of gallons


Thus, a recipe with 3.3# of syrup, 3# of dry extract, and 1# of corn
sugar gives


OG = 1 + (3.3*.036 + 3.0*.042 + 1.0*.044)/5 = 1.058


>By the way, is there any NET consensus on the result of one pound of

I use 0.42 for DME, 0.36 for syrups, .044 for sugar.  Mashed grains
work the same way except the extraction rates are lower (.028-.031).  I
rarely use DMS in my beer, and when I do, I keep them in the parts per
million range.  This does not effect wort gravity significantly! :-)

This is absolutely correct. The only exceptions are breweries which misuse

This is an excellent point. Both Laurie and I were on the professional panel,
and it was our view that there were too many beers per judge, and not enough
categories. In particular, there were over 900 beers entered which were
evaluated by ~40 judges in a 48 hour period. The panel itself had a good
mix of large industrial brewers, microbrewers, consultants, and misc. academic
types. Many of the major brewing countries were represented including the UK,
Germany, and Scandinavia, to cite but three examples. Nevertheless, the work
load was higher than desirable. Of the 900 or so beers entered, only ~150-200
were in serious contention for awards. This is why Norm's point is of great
relevance. Had there been local screening a la AHA nationals, then a better
and more complete evaluation could have been done at Denver. I felt 
particularly frustrated by the time constraints, and the effect it had on
the quality of feedback the brewers will be getting from the score sheets.
I usually like to write a couple of paragraphs, particularly with problem
beers. Unfortunately, at the GABF time permitted only "one liners", something
I see as highly unsatisfactory.


To implement Norm's ideas one would need cooperation at the local level. This,
however, IMHO is exactly what the MBAA and the various small brewers 
associations should be doing.


I was also uneasy about the number of categories. In particular, there were
no categories for Belgian styles. This forced Pierre Celis to enter both
his white beer (which won) and Grand Cru in the same category, in spite of
the fact that these two beers are dramatically different. In fact, the
category in question, i.e., spices, vegetables, et al, seems to me to be
ill defined, and as a result needs to be reorganized.


Both Laurie and I were upset about the merger of the Vienna and the Festbier
categories. There were ~ 40 enties, 6 of which were world class (three of each 
of each type). The Viennas had OGs in the high 40s, while The Fest versions 
were all in the high 60s. I have found that when one is evaluating beer based
on 1 oz. samples, there is a skew toward high gravity versions. This is indeed
what happened, for the gold and silver metals went to Festbiers. At the private 
AHA tasting we rounded up as many homebrewers as we could find and tasted
the six beers in question, this time with 8 oz. samples. There was general
agreement that the two versions were sufficiently different to warrant
separate categories, and that each of the 6 samples was worthy of an award.
BTW the Viennas won the Gallo test in this informal evaluation, i.e., they
were the beers which the evaluators drank the most of. This is not to say
the Viennas were superior, but rather it underscores the importance in
(amateur or commercial) competitions of not forcing judges to evaluate apples
and oranges in the same category.


These comments are not to reflect negatively on the awards that were actually
given. The silver went to the Festbier that Pittsburgh brewed for Jim Koch.
Those who have read Laurie and my book on this style will know it has been
a long favorite of ours, and this version was a good sample. The gold went
to one of the best Festbiers I have ever tasted. Still we felt terrible about
the 4th place entry (a Vienna brewed in Georgia) for it too was world class,
yet it did not get an award.


George Fix


P.S. The judging was blind, and the entries were known to the judges by
numbers. Brewers on the panel did not evaluate categories where they had
entries. After the awards were announced, members of the panel were permitted
to match up the numbers with breweries, to see how various operations came
out. There were several samples where I though I knew who brewed beer being
evaluated, and even considered disqualifying myself from their evaluation.
It turned out that I was right some of the time, but not in all cases. The
biggest shock came from the American Light category, where some small 
operations blew versions from AB, Coors, and Miller out of the water. I judged
this category, and at the end would have sworn that the winners were all
from large industrial brewers. What a pleasant surprise!

        The only reason I cooled my boiled priming solution was I didn't 
want to dump boiling liquid into my carboy (I add the priming solution 
first then rack the beer into it).  Priming in a keg, however, I have no 
qualms about dumping the hot priming solution staright into the keg (after 
flushing it with CO2 first...)

        A hint of banana creeping in under the hop nose is an acceptable 
part of british ale.  The isoamyl acetate (banana ester) can be strong if 
the temperature is too high (73^F should be OK, but don't let it get 
higher), if there is insufficient oxygen in the wort, and if the yeast is 
underpitched.  So, aerate that cool wort, pitch lots of yeast, and a whiff 
of banana (should not come through in the flavour) is acceptable, some 
might say desirable, from a british ale.

I'm not sure where I've seen the 1.042 figure (probably Charlie
P.'s book) and maybe a Zymurgy issue.  The 0.8 factor represents
an approximate average, and you'll find a variation probably
between 0.75 and 0.85 depending on the manufacturer of the LME.
The 0.7 factor is dependent on the grains, their crush, and your
sparging (straining) technique.
On the other hand, I've compared the above formula to measured
O.G. values for over a dozen extract batches and have had an
average error of about 1 point (0.1%), and a maximum of 4

I think we all like to encourage the continuation of the art.  Bad first
attempts have put off more than one newbrewer!  No harm in taking the 
trouble to drop a hose to the bottom of a secondary (or stuff one into 
the "out" end of a funnel) so we aren't SPLASHING brew from the top
of a carboy.  Fermented beer is a reactive shlew of chemicals. Alcohol
being one of them!  Not to mention that the yeast are quite comfortable
in a relatively aerobic environment.  
    I would vote the claim that oxidation can and will happen upon 
sloppy transfers- it IS worth taking efforts to avoid it. Buy a longer
hose if needed! The stuff's cheap.  Cheap beer ain't...well...it is...but
Some IS GOING TO HAPPEN- in almost ANY system, but just keep it down
to a managable amount.  Unless you like chewing cardboard!!!    :),

 -blazo  talks about how...


In London, England they mix bitter orange soda with beer and call the
resultant beverage "Shandy".  In some parts of England this is called "Orange
Shandy" and other soda beverages, Cherry, for instance, mixed with beer would
be called "Cherry Shandy".


*I was familiar with "shandy" being made with bitter lemon soda. A 
similar mix can be made with 7-up or the like.  (the brittish soda has
less sugar than our sodas).  You could have flavor variants, but a 
lemon or lemon/lime was the basic.


It is almost shameful to admit it but (shudder) Orange Shandy tastes pretty
darn good as a "lawnmower style" malt beverage.  I know that this probably
offends the sensitivities of most of this audience, but, refuse to judge
until you've tried it.  Mix equal parts Schweppes Bitter Orange with Double
Diamond and see what I mean!


* It is a common afternoon drink,  served frequently to kids (it is half
as strong as a beer!).  Squatters brewpub in Salt Lake serves one. It's
ok.  Good for the yuppies at luncheon business meetings!  I've made 'em.
Even with my own homebrew.  I had to do something with that 5 gallons
of slice I had in the keg I purchased!  Too  sugary though!!!!
Lemon or Lime in a light beer makes a nice summer ferment.  But now's not
the time.  Dark lager season is on the way!

Subject: Raspberry or Peach beer...


I would like to try using raspberry or peach to flavor my next
batch of beer, but I don't know what quantities to use.
How should I vary the hopping levels when using these fruit adjuncts?
Has anybody got a good recipe for an extract based peach or raspberry
beer?
steve tollefsrud


*I've done rasberries in stouts/ pales, primary and secondary.
I now have my first peach on the way.   I can tell you that a flat of
rasberries (4 #) at the end of the boil makes a nice red berry flavor
and pink head in a malty pale ale.  
I'm about to keg up my rasberry brown with berries in the secondary.
It's a yummy one!  I think I'll drop in some molasses to balance the 
tartness of the berry.
I used  about a half bushel of peaches- pitted, frozen, smushed into
carboy- and secondary beer dropped on top.  I feel that a lighter beer
is more fitting for peach.  
    I'm inclined to keep the hopping rate down on a fruit beer to
let the fruit come through. Something semi floral. but not too
overpowering.  Say Williamete rather than Cascade.  Rasberries are
commonly found paired with stouts.  I like seeing the color all
that fruit lends to a brew.  Maybe a light porter if you want dark
flavor in there.  
    Freezing fruit- and pectic enzyme can help get the most out of 
fruit, and aid in clearing of the brew.

Subject: SPRUCE beer

Check any bartender's guide or list of recipes.  Some that I have tasted in

Black Velvet--stout and champagne
Red Eye--beer and tomato juice
Shandy--British lemonade (more like US Sprite than US lemonade) and ale


Unfortunately, most of the beer recipes just call for "beer", since they have 
been formulated by people who have only been exposed to one kind of 
beer--Worldwide megabrew tasteless pilsener.


Now if we could just get some interesting combinations with good styles.
Anyone know if a Red Eye is better with an IPA, for instance?

"Orange Shandy"?  "Cherry Shandy"?  I count myself as a Londoner and I've
never come across either of these.  "Shandy", a half and half mixture of
British lemonade (lemon soda) and beer is quite popular throughout Britain, 
especially as a thirst quenching drink on a hot summer day.   Some people
drink "bitter top" - bitter with a splash of lemonade - but they are
usually occasional drinkers who need something to sweeten their beer.

If I remember my beer-lore correctly, I thought Big Jimmy O'Carter made
homebrewing technically legal in this country (correcting an earlier
oversight).  Being but a simple software engineer, my legal credentials
are a good approximation of nil, but I thought federal law superceded
state/local law.  That is, if the Feds say it's OK for me to manufacture
certain kinds of drugs in my kitchen, then it doesn't matter one whit
what Missouri or any other state has to say about it.  Yes?


This reminds of the request (by ?) recently for a recipe/ procedures for
making an eisbock.  Isn't this a form of distillation (intentionally
concentrating the beer by freezing some of the water and drawing whats
left off) and isn't that illegal?  Just wondering...

I have a short shandy saga:  once in London I had dragged my luggage to
Victoria Station and was absolutely exhausted.  I noticed a vending machine
with shandy available (it's my impression that just saying "shandy" gets you
beer & lemonade).  Perishing with thirst, I raised can to lips, and instantly
recovered my full vigor - nothing like sugared beer to really get you moving.
Other beer drinks -
Dog's Nose - beer and gin; a favorite of seamen in the age of Nelson, and
curiously enough, amongst present-day Japanese.  Keep the gin in the freezer,
use any old lager, great at the beach.
Snake Bite - beer and cider - excellent, but incredibly intoxicating - espec-
ially when you hit the open air.
Black Velvet - Stout and cider - my favorite - it's like a stout milkshake. I
know that BV also refers to Guiness & champagne, but if you ask for BV in a pub
you'll get it with cider.
And of course Red-eye; beer and tomato juice; thanks anyway.

Well Bart this has been my standard practice for the start. I just put the hot
sugar solution in the bottling carboy and rack the beer for the secondary right
on top of it. I have had no problems with it as of yet. As you said before the
thermal mass of 1 pint of 200F sugar water is nothing compared with 5 gallons `at`
70F.

Anyone have any good ideas on how to blowoff those kraeusen chunkies from
a 5 gal carboy without compromising sanitation? I've heard ghost stories
about little critters creeping up unsealed blowoff tubes, so I've tried
attaching a fermentation lock at the end of a really long blowoff tube. A
clumsy solution: the foam still manages to percolate through the lock,
sometimes clogging and blowing off the lid. It's rather comical. The only
other makeshift idea I have is to simply submerge the end of the blowoff
tube in a bucket of chlorox solution. Sure, you'd have to change the
solution every once in a while once it got polluted, but at least none of
those critters would crawl up the tube. Or is this much ado about nothing?
Is the kraeusen itself protection enough from critters?

From: "Mark S. Nelson" <mnelson`at`eis.calstate.edu>
Subject: Brewpub Review


The opinions expressed below are mine only.  Others can decide what they
are worth.


On a recent visit to the Los Angeles area I had the opportunity to visit
two brewpubs (both fairly new).  This is a review of the Humtington Beach
Brewing Company.


Being that it had been over two years since my last visit to Huntington
Beach, I was very upset by the recent changes to the area around the
intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Main St.  What used to be a
charming area with strong local atmosphere has now been converted into a
stale, sterile tourist scene much like many others in southern Calif.
Most of the old buildings have been torn down and replaced by stuccoed,
pinkish things that are horrible to behold.


However, there are still some hold-outs and the Huntington Beach Brewing
Co. is located in one.  Although the pub is a bit difficult to locate on
the first try, it is worth the search.  HBBC can be found upstairs in one
of the older buildings still standing.  I was immediately impressed by the
old brick, stylish wood furnishings and high, beamed ceilings.  There is
outside, patio seating and plenty of indoor seating as well. 


The brewery is located directly behind the bar. The hot liquor tank, mash
tun and kettle are in front, with the fermenting tanks behind.  It seemed
a bit cramped, but very functional.  The crushed grain comes down from the
storeroom in the attic and the holding tanks are in a cooling room adjacent.
They also brew pilsners and lagers.


The beers they had on hand were:


Main Street Wheat:  This is a light, slightly dry wheat.  Very tasty and
refreshing for hot, summer days.  My only complaints with this beer would
be that it was filtered and that it was a little light on the wheat taste.
However, these complaints are minor and would not stop me from happily
drinking it.


Huntington Beach Blond:  This is a light pilsner.  In all honesty, this is
the first pils. I've ever had in a brewpub.  It was a very tasty, American
style pilsner.  Sort of like what the major breweries could do if only
they cared...  Light in the mouth with a pleasent ending.


Bolsa Chica Bitter:  A mild bitter.  Nice red color and crisp taste and
feel.  My favorite of those on hand.


Pacific Porter:  I honestly can't say too much about this one, as it was
the last I sampled.  I do know that I liked it, and happily finished off a
pint before going back to the bitter.


Overall, the beer was very good, as well as the food.  The atmosphere was
friendly and comfortable, although it was during the day.  I'm sure it
gets very crowded at night though.  My only consistant complaint would be
that all the beers I sampled seemed heavily filtered.  Considering their
clientelle, though, this is not suprising.  Again, this complaint is not a
serious problem and I look forward to my next visit.

RE:  Rolling Rock Bock


I tried this about a month ago when I saw it a the store.  I was drawn to
the neat bottle.  I thought it was nice (the label is a clear plastic type with 
the printing on the plastic, sort of like what some of the bottle waters are 
using).  I guess I liked the bottle better than the beer.  I certainly wouldn't
call it a bock.  But it was very drinkable.  The packaging got me to bite on a
6-pack.  I doubt I would get any more though.


RE:  Sam Adams radio spots


Thanks Norm for the update on what GABF was doing in conjunction with Jim's 
advertising.  I thought it strange that IMMEDIATELY after the GABF, I started
to hear more of his commercials, something to the effect of "best beer 4 years
running".  Made it sound like he won again.  Then I saw the winners list (I
didn't get to go to the fest).  I can't recall the station I heard it on, but
it had to have been a Denver or Colo Springs station.  It was on the following
Monday though.


Guess this goes to show what $$$ can buy in the way of laywers and creative
marketing types.


RE: Making drinks w/ Beer.


Here's an old set of recipes from my early college days.  I'd like to think 
that I'm a bit wiser these days.  The source is an old roommate from Kansas 
(nothing seemed to affect this boy!).


Kansas Whirlwind:
1 can Coors Light, drink 1/4 of the can, top off can with Everclear.


Kansas Twister:
1 can Coors Light, drink 1/2 of the can, top off can with Everclear.


Kansas Tornado:
1 can Coors Light, drink 3/4 of the can, top off can with Everclear.


I REALLY don't recommend these, but I thought it could provide some interesting
reference point for someone.  BTW, my roommate typically used the tall cans
(16 ouncers)!  I never could keep up with that one.


Also, when I was over in England (1991), I saw a number of people order up 
mixers of a bitter and lemonade.  I can't recall what they were called though.  
Seemed like the name varied depending on whether it was a bitter, Special 
Bitter or ESB.  Looked strange, but then so did all of the Bud longnecks!  I 
never did try one though (or a Bud - does the Bud in England differ from the
Bud found in the States?  I'm sure what I saw was not an import from the USA.
I never thought about until I returned from my trip.).
