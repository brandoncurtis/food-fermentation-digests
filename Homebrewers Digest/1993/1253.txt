I don't know about the taste, but I've been told by the manufacturer,
that Iodophor is non-toxic WHEN DRY.  All the instructions regarding
its use around brewing have included the mention of DRYING the sanitized

Not all iodophors contain phosphoric acid -- the "phor" has nothing
to do with phosphoric acid -- this is what a chemist told me.
I found a really interesting article in an ASBC publication from
the 50's.  I'll see if I can get around to posting some of the
more interesting parts.

Smoothly medicinal sounds to me like stale grain.  Some grains are more
suceptable to developing a phenolic smell/flavor -- I've found that 
DeWolf-Cosyns CaraPils is the most likely to develop this problem of all
the grains that I've tried.  I was talking to Tim Norris about this recently
and he suggested that perhaps it's the moisture content, since the CP has
a high moisture content compared to the other DWC grains.  The phenolic
flavor I'm talking about is similar to BandAids(tm).  Is that what you
smelled/tasted?  A little wheat malt can give you this flavor/aroma too.
Any wheat in the recipe?

How warm did you warm it?  You should rehydrate yeast at between 90 and
110F and then let that slowly cool to your wort temperature before pitching.
I suspect that either you A) didn't aerate your wort enough, in which case
you should aerate the wort and add more yeast, B) shocked the yeast by
rehydrating in too COOL a water, in which case you should wait some more,
C) killed it by heating it over 130F, in which case you should add more
yeast, or D) it has already fermented out the whole batch while you were not
looking (is there a brown ring of crud on the walls of the fermenter, about
an inch wide, just above the level of the wort?  if yes, then it's probably
D).  If the lag time ends up being more than three or four days, then I
would taste the beer before bottling and dump it if it got infected.

Subject: Hot priming and peach beer


Bart Thielges asked about adding hot priming sugar solution to wort for 
priming.  I do that all the time and haven't seen a problem yet.  I pour
the boiling corn sugar/water solution into my bottling bucket and then start
siphoning the beer into it.


Steven Tollefsrud asked about a peach beer.  I made one a couple of months
ago when my peach tree started producing.  I used a recipe from Dave Miller's
"Brewing the World's Great Beers".  It's basically a lightly hopped, lightly
colored, wheat & barley beer.  Ferment to near completion in primary and
siphon onto 10 lbs. of crushed peaches in the secondary and let ferment
another couple of weeks.  It has a great peach aroma and a very light and
refreshing taste.  The biggest problem I had with it was separating the beer
from the peaches.  I ended up leaving almost a gallon of beer behind because
of clogging siphons.  This caused a bit of a complication since I primed
for 5 gals -- the beer has to be well chilled to avoid gushers.

Beer Hunting in Belgium: Part 2 of 7


Brasserie de Silenrieux
      (by Jim Busch: BUSCH`at`DAACDEV1.STX.COM)


      This brewery opened in December 1992, and is still largely
unknown.  A friend of one of our Belgium hosts had just visited
the brewery the month before our we arrived in Belgium, and
reported that they were brewing with unusual grains.  So when a
visit was suggested, we jumped on it.  
      It turns out that the government of Belgium had the notion
of developing brewing processes using non-traditional grains,
primarily as a way to stimulate agricultural production and open
markets for local agricultural products.  Early research and
small scale brewing experiments were performed in Canada and at
the university of Louvain-la-Neuve.  Successful beers were
produced using buckwheat and spelt (a wheat relative) as
principal ingredients.  These experiments were underwritten by
subsidies from the Belgian agriculture ministry, starting with
3-liter lab batches and working up to 6 hl batches using the
brewing studies facilities at Louvain-la-Neuve.
      Monetary assistance may also have been provided to the
organizers of the brewery, who have built a truly beautiful
modern facility in the south of Belgium near Chimay and a
vacation lake/camping area.  The brewery consists of three
dedicated production vessels; a mash tun, a special lauter tun,
and the kettle.  The mash tun and kettle are normal enough
stainless steel vessels while the lauter tun (if one can call it
a that--a separator might be more accurate) consists of a large
SS vessel containing a removable circular basket, or strainer,
and the strainer/basket is attached to a crane attached to
overhead support structures.  The strainer has slots in the
bottom and up the sides about 1/2 a meter from the bottom.  The
entire saccrified mash is pumped from the mash tun into the
basket, which is then slowly raised via the crane out of the
lauter tun.  In effect, the basket is used like a giant tea bag,
with the liquid runoff flowing through the slots into the vessel,
leaving the grains in the basket.  The liquid is then pumped over
to the kettle.  There is no sparging performed.  The brewers
admitted to less than ideal extraction of sugars and a generally
difficult separation stage.  
      Three SS unitank fermenters are used as primary vessels
while a fourth is used only for mixing the priming sugar prior to
the hand filling of champagne-type bottles.  A typical Belgium
top fermenting "abbey" strain of yeast is used, most likely quite
similar to that employed in numerous Belgium strong ale
breweries, including La Chouffe, La Binchoise and possibly La
Caracole.  Kegs are also used, and are sanitized using forced
steam; a steam hose is just pushed into the kegs and allowed to
vent, resulting in about 120 decibels of noise pollution. 
Definitely not my idea of a nice working environment.  The
brewers were a bit frustrated in terms of keg sales since it is
near impossible to break the stranglehold that the giant Belgium
brewing consortium, Interbrew, has on tap handles in the country. 
      One of the nice things about the design of this brewery is
that there is a steel catwalk running the entire length of the
brewing vessels, including the unitanks.  This allows the brewer
to do most of his work up top and close to the action.  The
brewery is generally well designed and constructed, although the
brewers noted the difficulty involved in packaging the products.
While the rest of the brewery is quite modern, there is no
bottling  line.  A set of manual bottle fillers are used for the
champagne bottles, and labels were applied to the bottles we
bought the old-fashioned homebrew way--with milk.
      The brewhaus is separated from the tasting room by large
plate glass windows.  The ceiling of the tasting room is brick!  
      We were able to sample the brewery's two products, Joseph
and Sara.  Joseph is a blonde beer of 6% ABV.  It consists of
55-60% spelt and the balance pale malt.  The bottle describes the
product as "Bier d'Epeautre" (epautre=spelt).  It is blond with a
big creamy head, typical "abbey" aroma and some citrus notes. 
Despite being produced from a large percentage of cereal grains,
the beer retains a high degree of malt/hop/yeast balance.  It is
a broad cross between abbey beers and the ever popular Wits.  The
beer is named after the person in the agriculture ministry who
lobbied for the revival of spelt as a brewing and food grain and
who, not coincidentally, provided the subsidies for the early
brewing experiments.
      Sara is a brune (brown beer), called "Biere de Sarrasin"
(sarrasin=buckwheat).  It is produced from equal parts of
buckwheat and malt and features a caramel aroma intermixed with
the abbey esters with a fairly light caramel finish.  This is a
good beer, but did not approach the quality of the Joseph.  It is
also 6% ABV.

Not true.  (You can decide for yourself whether this is good or bad).
I don't want to rant too much on this, but the U.S. Constitution attempts
to give states the ability to make their own laws, while giving the federal
government jurisdiction over inter-state issues (interstate commerce,
dealing with foreign countries, etc.) and enforcing rights guaranteed by 
the constitution.  When the feds want to enact a law which appears outside
their jurisdiction, they generally do it in one of these ways:


  * Pass a constitutional amendment (prohibition, for example).
  * Argue that the issue crosses state boundaries and therefore is already
    within their jurisdiction (FCC, for example).
  * Impose taxes/licensing on some products or services (brewing).
  * Threaten to withhold federal revenue from states unless the states
    pass their own laws for which the feds otherwise have no jurisdiction
    (many highway laws).


In the case of beer brewing, the feds collect taxes on alcoholic beverages.
The change that Carter signed simply said that if you make less than a
certain amount of beer for your own use, the feds won't tax you on it, and
won't require any special licensing.  There is no guarantee that any
particular state won't further restrict home brewing.


I think there is little chance of a U.S. Constitutional amendment being
passed to guarantee the right to brew beer.  Are there active movements in the
more restrictive states to have their state laws changed?

Subject: Liquid Yeast: Friend or Fiend


In HBD 1251 Jerome asks if liquid yeast is Friend or Fiend.  FRIEND!!


Liquid yeast is a friend.  My beer got much better when I switched to 
liquid yeasts.  Although the Wyeast package says you can just pitch
directly from the package, my experience is that this is not a good idea and
a starter is absolutely necessary.  Why?  The number of yeast cells in the
Wyeast package is very low and results in an incredible under pitch which
can lead to very long lag times raising the risk of infection.

It has been my experience that Wyeast is ready to pitch after about 24
hrs, sometimes less.  By the time the package is really puffed the 
yeast has gone way past high kraesen (sic?), and flocculated.  It's had a 
good meal and dozed off.  Pitching this means not only are you under 
pitching, but you are under pitching sleeping yeast that will need some 
time to wake up.  By using a starter you can pitch more cells and perhaps 
better time your pitch to occur just before high kraesen.  So I think that
a 48 hr lag time (Sat-Mon) is not unexpected.


Another thing to watch out for is that dry yeast is often contaminated 
with bacteria.  Reusing slurry from a dry yeast fermentation may allow the
bacterial population to build up to infection levels. 


Let me suggest that you download the yeast FAQ from sierra.stanford.edu to
get some guidance in propagating a yeast starter.


Liquid yeast is your friend.  You just have to treat 'em right.

In 1251 jmp`at`shoe.wustl.edu related difficulties with Wyeast used
straight.  I remeber using Wyest straight and having 2 day lags, 
but so what?  If the system is clean there won't be any contamination.
The last thing I would do is worry and contaminate a $4 culture
with a 30cent sachet of microflora assortment.  And you'll 
develop plenty of slurry for a quick fermentation.  If using a 
Wyeast one should make a starter, and if it's a lager the starter
should be around a gallon.

Jerome, this happens because you are (a) underpitching and (b) probably
under-aerating.  There is a fairly small quantity of yeast in the
package, which is why the general wisdom is that you need a starter.  A
starter (which is really very simple to put together and use) will get
the cell counts up to something approximating the correct number.  You
will never get counts like that simply pitching from the package.  Dry
yeasts generally have much higher counts, although the percentage of
viable cells in the packages isn't very high.  It is possible to get a
decent fermentation from the packet, but it's asking a lot, and it
requires a very fresh package and extremely thorough aeration of the
wort prior to pitching.


You should: follow the instructions on making a starter wort, and beging
the process of building up your yeast several days before brewing; and
you should shake the bejabbers out of your cooled wort (or follow some
more advanced instructions about using an aquarium pump to aerate -- see
Dave Miller's articles in Brewing Techniques).  You *will* see a
difference in the quality of your beer.  Really.

No.  State law supercedes federal law in this instance.  This is why
each state has been able to set guidelines for alcohol content, drinking
age, etc. (for example, in Oregon and Washington you can only buy
distilled beverages from state-operated liquor stores, while in nearby
California you can buy the stuff virtually anywhere).  On the other
hand, while the federal government prohibited homebrewing, the state
could *not* allow it.  Clear?  No?  Well, it doesn't make any sense to
me either.

  *   Amylase (sp!) is a combination of alpha and beta amylase.  Two

  Alphas are most active at 65-67 deg C, or 149-153 deg F.  Beta works
  at 52-62 deg C, 126-144 deg F. Alpha inactivates at 67 deg C (153),
  while beta ceases at 65 deg C(149).  
      These temps are not exact cutoffs and inactivation takes a period 
  of time (40 min-2hrs) to completely eliminate activity.  Both enzymes
  will be active simultaneously. A higher temp mash will result in more 
unfermentables (more complex sugars) by favoring the alpha activity, 
  whereas a lower temp will favor the beta and smaller more "digestable"
  sugars for the yeast.
  
      Amylases and other enzymes are present in pale malts (grains) and
  some other grains (munich, vienna...etc).  If you are mashing they
  are there and required for the process.  If you are using extracts
  you don't need to worry about them.  If you do a partial mash, or
  add something like flaked corn (NOT Kellogs!)  or rice you need to 
  have enzymes convert the starches to fermentable sugars.  For this
  you can use pale malt, or some purified amylase.  You can add amylase
  to a mash if you are not getting good yields- but probably better to
  work out a system that works more effectively!
      Someone mentioned using flaked corn in an extract beer and making 
  tea with it.  What is the point of that?  You are adding starch.
  Corn can lighten a beers body while adding fermentables w/o much color
  or substance,  but where is the advantage in an extract brew?
  Has anyone done this?  Does anyone have a REASON behind doing this?

Subject: WORT CHILLERS




There's been a lot of posts about what type and size of wort chillers to 
use, be it cold water bath, immersion, or counter-flow. Most counter-flow 
designs are based on a length of 3/8" copper tubing passing through the 
center of a garden hose. This is quite effective, but awkward to use.


So, here's a question for all you Thermodynamic type people: how effective 
would a 30 foot length of 3/8" diameter, coiled copper tubing, be in 
a 2 foot long, 4" inside diameter, PVC pipe?  Essentially, I want to place 
the coil inside the PVC, with the ends of the coil entering and exiting 
the capped ends of the PVC.  The cooling water would enter the capped 
ends as well, but counter-flow. The "coil" diameter would be about 3.5", 
resulting in a circumference of about 11". With each "coil" spaced about 
1/4" apart, the length would be about 2 feet.  Of course the length and 
size of the copper tubing can be altered, (the PVC diameter is the max. I 
can get) but, is the idea feasible? Any comments appreciated.

I was also concerned over the use of a plastic hose in the kettle
and the fact that the hose was close to the open flame of the
propane burner near the side of the kettle. Also, The hose flattened
out where it looped up before going into the kettle.


My solution was to use a length of 3/8 copper tubing inside the
kettle and attach the hose to that.


The top of the tubing has an S curve so that I can hang it on
the kettle itself.  It's a tight fit, so it doesn't fall out
if you accidentaly yank the hose.


The bottom of the tube is 1/4 inch off the bottom of the kettle.
This minimizes (eliminates) splashing of the hot wort as it flows
into the kettle.  The outside end curves back up so that the hose
coming in meets it straight on and doesn't droop and flatten out.

    I just wanted to say a word in defense of spruce beer- I made a
batch using Papazian's recipe, with 1 oz of spruce essence, and it
was good.  Yes, it was odd, earthy even, but I grew up drinking the
soda versions of birch and spruce beer.  My spruce beer had similar
taste without the sugar.  It may be that spruce essences and extracts
are highly variable in quality.  For that matter, spruce trees are
probably variable in quality.  If anybody wants to know, I can check
up on the brand name of the essence I used.  If spruce beer sounds
interesting to you, don't be deterred.

Federal law supercedes state law except when it doesn't.  What they 
often do, and did in this case, was leave further regulation of 
brewing to the states.  ie: "Its OK for you to manufacture up to 
200 gallons of certain drug-containing beverages in your kitchen 
unless your local government objects, in which case you're stuck 
with the more restrictive regulations."  Funny how they can write  
whatever laws they want...

My guess is that the law removed the Federal restriction on brewing.
This is not the same as saying the law grants permission to brew.
Without a Federal restriction, states and localities are allowed to
make their own regulations.  This is why dry towns and dry counties are
allowed to exist.

You guys are giving Spruce Beer a bad rap! I've been making it for four
years and have to keep it quiet that I have a new batch in the fermenter.
My friends hound me for a taste of the elixer. I use Papazian's recipe
with 4 oz of spruce tips picked from a Spruce tree (not hemlock) in the
spring added like hops (in the hops bag). I have NEVER had a bad batch
nor a sappy or any other off flavor.                                                                                                                                 
I have never used essence. Being a purist, I think it poor style but I
would suggest just a hint of Spruce essence and then add more in future 
batches.

The Hops FAQ is nearing completion but I have one sticking point.  I've used
IBU's so long that I can't recall the definition of HBU.  I looked up AAU in
Miller's and Line's books, and I have that.  Rager says the two are the same,
i.e.  AAU=HBU but Al Korzonas mentioned that he thought one of them was batch
size dependent, based on a 5 gallon batch (and that rang a bell with me).
According to Miller and Line, AAU is just the alpha acid percentage multiplied
by the weight in ounces.  This leaves HBU as being the batch size dependent one
if they are not the same.  This should be simple but I figured the quickest way
to get the answer to this would be here on the HBD.  Thanks for your input.
Expect to see this thing in the next few days.

Subject: Liquid Yeast: Friend or Fiend?


Jerome Pierick asks in HDB #1251 (essentially) about yeast pitching 
rates, and the instructions on the Wyeast packages which say 
essentially that sufficient yeast cells for a five gallon batch are 
grown in 50 ml of wort.  He goes on to say he has experienced lag 
times exceeding 48 hours, and wants to know why this is versus the 
dry yeast he's been using.  Finally, he asks about repitching yeast 
grown from a dry yeast culture.


Well, I've used Wyeast as directed on the package and I experience 
lag times just like Jermome.  IMNSHO, the directions on the Wyeast 
package do a great disservice to homebrewers as well as the 
company.  Yes, it *will work* but its far from ideal.  According to 
various sources summarized by Patrick Weix in the famous HBD Yeast 
FAQ (what would we do without those TLAs?) says that you need 1 
volume of yeast solids per 250 volumes of wort for lager yeasts, 
and 2/3 that rate for ale yeasts.  This translates roughly to 2 
cups of yeast slurry in a five gallon batch of ale, or three cups 
in a batch of lager.  Compare this with the teaspoon or so you dump 
out of a Wyeast package.  When the term "yeast slurry" is used I 
thake this to mean the tan stuff that'll settle out of a wort after 
fermentation.  The Wyeast package contains about ten teaspoons of 
wort, but no where near that much yeast slurry.


Well, I rarely pitch at ideal rates.  Usually I step Wyeast up 
twice, using a pint of sterile wort each time.  This yields maybe 
1/2 cup of slurry.  Still a far cry from ideal, but much better 
than the package directions produce. Usually the beer is fermenting 
away the next morning.  When the planets are properly aligned, I 
sometimes pour a new wort on top of the yeast cake in my secondary 
fermenter to make a second beer.  This is much closer to the ideal 
pitching rate, and I get amazing fermentations when I do this. Very 
short lag times -- just a couple hours.


So, what's a brewer to do?  If you don't want to take the time to 
step your Wyeast up, and I can perfectly well understand why you 
wouldn't, you can follow the directions on the package, and 
thoroughly aerate your wort.  This works, and makes very tasty 
beer.  Just count on longer-than-ideal lag times.  This means 
you'll want to be scrupulous about sanitation.  Wear rubber gloves, 
use plenty o' bleach, and all that.  If you do these things I think 
any pure Wyeast or YeastLabs culture  will produce a better beer 
than any dry yeast I know of.  I keep a package of dry yeast around 
in case a wort isn't fermenting after 72 hours.  I used one once, 
and the beer was OK.  This is I think what Jerome is doing after 36 
 - 48 hours.


If you DO continue to use dry yeast, repitching is not recommended. 
ALL dry yeast is contaminated with wild yeast and bacteria.  But 
there's a lot more good yeast than contaminants, so the yeast 
effectively out-competes the other beasts for the goodies in your 
wort.  But the contamination is still there, and will increase in 
concentration with subsequent reuse of the culture.  The reason you 
see such short lag times is that there's lots more yeast in the dry 
package than in the Wyeast package.


Hope some of this helps...

Subject: Re: Applejack/distilling


Hello All,
        Because freezing hard cider to make apple jack concentrates
the alcohol in the solution, a physical separation if you 
will, technically it's not a distillation. Distillation is used mainly  
to purify, as well as separate;concentrating the solution is a 
benificial side effect. Applejack is one of those things you can play 
dumb over, "jeeze I had no idea it would do that officer! I just 
wanted to keep it from going bad.". Any of you who have ever seen a 
"still" know that it obviously can't be passed off for anything else. 
However, I'm just a lowly research tech., not a lawyer (thank god!) 
so I can't quote laws, but as far as I'm concerned making apple jack 
wouldn't be illegal because you aren't doing any distillation. BTW, 
distilling hard cider would result in apple brandy, not that I wish 
to plant ideas into anyone's head.
        While I'm at it, I can see why cops & the law (especially 
the ones who haven't got a clue) would confuse homebrew apparatus
with distillation apparatus. Those of you who cool your wort with 
copper coils beware, they're the give-away as far identifying  
moonshiners!

Correct.  Federal law allows for the production of 200 gallons
per year per household if there are 2 or more adults in the
household or 100 gallons/year if there is only one adult.

As a simple law librarian I can't program my way out of a paper
bag (well I might get that far, but maybe not) but I think I can
clarify this misunderstanding a bit.  The law that Carter signed
exempted homebrew (within limits, e.g. 200 gallons/household)
from excise taxes.  The oversight Scott refers to is that an earlier
law that exempted home winemaking from the excise tax did not do
the same for beer.


Now, exempting homebrew from excise taxes ain't quite the same as
providing a constitutional right to brew.  I guess that since many of our
founding fathers were brewers and nobody had threatened this right, they
didn't seem fit to include it in the Constitution.  This being the case, I
believe state goverments can pretty much do as they please.  On the other
hand, if the feds said homebrewing is illegal, the states couldn't say
otherwise.

Subject: Alabama Laws


Some comments and questions in the HBD concerning whether
xhomebrewing is legal in all 50 states prompted me to investigate
the situation here (to borrow a phrase) in the beer wastelands of
Alabama.  According to Mr. Charles Ball of the Alabama Beverage
Control Board Enforcement Office in Montgomery:  1)  Homebrewing
is strictly illegal in the state of Alabama.  2)  Transporting
any alcoholic beverage into AL (as a personal citizen, not a
distributor, obviously) is strictly illegal;  distributors must
comply 
with all of AL's labelling and tax requirements.  3)
Distributors are prevented by law from importing any beer with
greater than 4% alcohol by weight (5% by volume).  4)  Commercial
breweries (microbreweries, brewpubs, et al.) must be built in an
historic building or historic district in which draft 
beer was
sold prior to Prohibition (??).


My personal impression is that they don't really care about
enforcing the homebrew laws (unless one were to try and sell it
or some other obvious violation).  This was the extent of the
information I got in the short conversation I had with Mr. Ball;
I am also interested in what the federal regulations are, and how
they interact with the state laws.  If anyone 
can provide me with
or direct me to this information, please e-mail me, or if it's
sufficiently interesting, post it here.  Maybe a compilation of
basic regulations for all 50 states could be created?  Thanks.
