Subject: Growing Hops


I would very much like to grow my own hops this next season 
but I have a slight problem.  I live in a Condo without a 
back yard but I have a very large porch that has access to
plent of sunlight (my other plants are very happy :).  If I 
was to grow hops, it would have to be from some sort of planter 
box.  I would have plenty of room to set up a vine path that 
would be adequate but my concern is the planting.  Will planting 
the rhizomes in a planter box work?  Has anyone else done
this successfully?  
        Also, I brewed an all extract beer several weeks ago
(my third attempt at an SNPA clone) and the OG was 1.030!
(my local homebrew store packaged DME in 3 lb. bags and when
I actually weighed them they came out to about 2 lbs. 10oz :()
Guess where I'm not going anymore for my supplies?  Anyway
my FG after two weeks was 1.016!!  I was a little scared as
I'd never seen such a low gravity loss but I bottled anyway.
What I have now is IMHO an excellent ale that has a pronounced
buttery taste and goes down like water.  The sweetness with a
fairly aggressive hop bitterness combined to make a flavor that
I never expected and it's great.  Just goes to show that even an
apparent disaster can come out smelling roses (figuratively of
course).  Anyone else had horror stories that have come out to
be a surprisingly good brew?

*   No really....good advise. How big was the carboy?  Did you shift temps
drastically and suddenly?  Was it scratched?  
I once had a 1 gallon EtOH bottle (brown...nice!) that was full of cold
spiced cider- happily fermented out- awaiting bottling. (~45-50 deg)
I had splashed hot water on a barstool from bottle washing, then 
placed the jug on the stool.  Just a little bit of hot water was enough
to cleanly sheer the bottom from the rest of the bottle. I was able to 
rack the precious fluid out before moving the bottle.  There must have
been an adequate temp differential to shock the glass. I was blessed 
by the grace of my brew lord for the survival!  One bottle remains. 
Ithink I'll have to celebrate halloween w/it! Pumpkin brew too!'course.
BTW I still have the top of the bottle. Could make a good funnel.


Also: The one batch (in my early days) of beer which became explosive 
(scary experience, ~~SHUDDDER~~) I had one bottle which broke/blew 
exactly the same way. The bottom sheered off cleanly. The top shot up 
into my underarm!  At least it didn't shatter like the one in my car! 
(no one was in it at the time.  Good thing.)
The point here...The connection between sides and bottom is a stress 
point for bottles.  Thin to thick glass is my guess.  Be wary!

Subject: Beer Shelf Life


Tom Schwendler asks about shelf life.  3 months life sounds ridiculous to me
unless there is something wrong with the beer.  Award-winning beers are
frequently 6 months old when judged.  From my own experience I am drinking a
beer that I made 12 months ago and it's superb: better than fresh when it
was a little harsh.  Most of my brews end up being 6 months old by the time
the last bottle is drunk and none have shown any sign of going off.

Subject: Questions


Did my first all grain last weekend.  Everything went well, but now I have
two questions. One on sparging the other on grain.


Sparging -
What is the best way to sparge. Should you?
1) Completely drain the bed, then sparge in one of the following ways?
2) Just match the additions to the drainings?
3) Sprinkle in all the water at once?
4) Others.


I have a feeling that 2 and 3 are going to be a tie.  What's the difference
besides my effort.  As I see it all the water goes through the bed either
way, and if you can maintain the temp why not do 3?  Maybe, more weight
so compacted filter bed?  What about 1? On one hand I would fear compacting
the filter bed, but on the other hand I would be getting the first drawings
that I would assume would be extract rich.  I used a rectangular cooler and
slotted pipe manifold(fantastic tool), so I am not real worried about a
stuck sparge, but I would think clarity could be a problem.  Also method 1
would cause more shifting in the grain bed, perhaps more astringiency?


For a 5 gallon batch I drained off 1 gallon of wort and recirculated this
because it was cloudy.  Was this correct? I ended up with clearer wort,
but I am assuming that the first drawings contain the most extract, which
I then poured on the top of the bed, and now it has to be washed through
the entire bed and out again.


Grain -


As a full mash novice I want to stay with simple infusion mashes for
a while.  What kind of grain does this mean I am restricted to.
I used Pale (2-row english).  The day after I went to another
brew store and they had two Pales(2-row from Germany and from America).
Pale is Pale???  The grain from the second brew store had a lot less
flour already mixed in (i.e. if you dropped a handfull of the english
Pale you saw some flour dust) and appeared to be good clean grain.
Will it be as modified as the english Pale? Is it an oversimplification
to say Pale == you can do an infusion?  I was reading Miller last
night and he explains the difference between Pale, Mild, Vienna, Munich,
Lager, Klages etc.. But what I want to know is, what can I infusion mash
as a base grain for recipe (obviously not specialty grains and adjuncts).
Pale is Pale??? No adjuncts used currently, so I don't need extra enzymes.
Describe how to tell if grain is good? Miller goes into it some (or was it 
Noonan?), but what do you look for?


If you are gonna answer my questions I would love to hear how you do it,
and especially why you do it this way and not this way.  I don't
want to just follow recipes or steps, I would like to know why I am going
to do something.


Fun, fun, fun.  If you are contemplating trying all grain, I would recomend
a cajun cooker burner and a slotted copper pipe manifold system.  They made
the job a LOT easier.  Also if you live near a drag-strip, you can slap that
cajun cooker on the back of your car and campaign it as a jet dragster.
NASA called and said the crew of the space shuttle saw it.  Man, is that thing
powerful!!!  Comes with a nifty recipe for a deep fried turkey (is it just me
or does the thought of deep frying a whole turkey sound odd?).


Thanks

            extract brewing as well as all-grain.  The problem: the

            I've been able to find (DME & LME [No, not Male extract])
            are all based on Pale Malt.  Does anyone out there in

Subject: Hunter Airstats


Thanks to an alert by Kieran O'Connor, I have confirmed that the Hunter
Airstat is no longer being produced and there are no plans for a
replacement product.


For those that don't know, the Hunter Airstat is a reasonably priced "line
voltage thermostat" that was originally designed to add thermostatic
control to a room air conditioner.  Homebrewers, however, have been using
it to control refrigerators/freezers.


The Hunter was unique in it's price range featuring a remote sensor and
digital setpoint and temperature readouts.  Homebrew suppliers are selling
them for $30 to $40, and hardware superstores (such as Home Depot) had
them as low as $19.50.  The main disadvantage of the Hunter was that it
only went down to 40 degrees F, not considered low enough by lager
afficianados.  But it could be easily modified to go lower, and
instructions have been published in this digest.


Homebrew rumor had it that the Hunter has been discontinued due to a lack
of reliability.  Hunter denies this and claims lack of sales is the sole
reason.


Hunter has no more inventory on this item, but some inventory does exist
in hardware stores, and I would bet even more is still in stock at
homebrew shops.  The reason for this post is that if you were thinking of
getting a temperature controller someday, or like me are a happy user of
an Airstat and want a "backup" or two, now is the time to buy.  Armed with
the info that they have been discontinued, you may be able to get an even
better price on any remaining inventory, at least from a hardware store. 
I went down to my local Home Depot and bought their remaining two units at
$15 each (one had no packaging and the other's package was pretty beat up).


Some enterprising homebrew supplier might want to contact Hunter about
picking up the manufacturing rights and making them again (and possibly
modifying the software to allow 30 F operation).  Hunter is in Memphis, TN.


Note that you don't have to panic.  There *are* alternatives.  Williams
Brewing in San Leandro sells a Penn line voltage thermostat that has been
modified specifically for Williams, but Penn has "standard" models that
will also work.  WW Graingers has a few pages of these, of which a few are
suitable for our needs and not too expensive.  Most will need to have a
line cord added.  You can also check local heating/air conditioning parts
suppliers.  What you want is a "line voltage thermostat" that is designed
for either "cooling only" or "heating/cooling"  (the key words are the
switch contacts "close on rise").  Sometimes they are listed as SPDT,
which means single pole double throw and is a technical way of saying they
work for heating or cooling.  The switch contacts need to be rated high
enough for your fridge (usually this is not a problem).  And the
temperature range needs to be right.  You also want a "remote bulb" or
"remote sensor" unit.  A "snap action" or "bimetallic" thermostat would
need to be entirely mounted inside the fridge, not very practical. 
Lastly, make sure the "differential" is in the 4 degree range or
adjustable to it.  You don't want one with a 25 degree fixed differential.


Disclaimer:  I have no affiliation with Hunter, nor do I sell temperature
controllers of any kind.  I just think that for the price, it was a great
deal, and I really like having the digital temperature readout on my keg
fridge.  And no, none of my "spares" are for sale, so don't ask.

My homemade roller mill works fine crushing hard stuff like wheat.  I use a
special (simple) modification to my mill when I crush wheat.  The mod is two
blocks of wood which restrict the amount of feed onto the rollers.  It allows
the rollers to crush less grain at any instant.  For example, if the rollers
are 8" long, this takes the working length down to about 5", so only 5" of the
rollers have grain between them at a time.  Without this mod, crushing wheat
causes the motor to stop (and this is a washing machine motor!).  Wheat is
indeed a tougher nut to crack than barley.

JS comments about immersion vs. CF chillers:
>The counter-flow "snobs" are simply wrong on this one.
(and other similar comments)


Jack, this is abrasive and counter-productive at best; its out and out flame
bait at worst.  The HBD will now be tied up with tons of inane arguing at a
time when 3 day turn around times are commonplace.  You were the one griping
about the yeast FAQ because you couldn't get a quick turnaround from the HBD.
This will tie up the HBD for much longer than one FAQ.


I brought up this subject for serious discussion, not flame wars.  I appreciate
your well thought out comments regarding versatility of the immersion chiller,
but I would have appreciated more if you had tempered your comments to a civil
level.  Do you talk this way in person?


One of the great advantages of CF chilling is efficiency of the water used.
Has anyone out there measured your cooling water?  It took me over 30 gallons
of cooling water with my immersion chiller, less than half that with my CF
chiller.  That's 6 times the volume of the beer just to cool it with the
immersion chiller!  This is a big reason I like CF chilling.  Combining this
with other water conservation methods can amount to a considerable water
savings in one brewing session.  I'm not claiming one method beats the hell out
of the other, just that there are pros and cons.  You have to pick your poison.

 Well put.  Just because methanol boils off when distilling, does not mean 
 there is any to boil off in the mash.  For a simple example, ponder making 
 brandy....  You start out with a nice drinkable wine and distill it to leave 
 most of the water behind.  If there were enough methanol to cause blindness 
 in the distillate, you wouldn't want to drink the wine in the first place.  
 The same thing applies to whiskey mash.  Methanol comes from petroleum or 
 from distilling trees.  That's why it's called wood alcohol.  If you put 
 trees in your wine, you might be in trouble.
 
 The industrial world needs grain alcohol but has enough clout to avoid paying 
 taxes on it.  To keep everyone honest, Big Brother mandates that a certain 
 amount of methanol is added to industrial ethanol to make it undrinkable.  
 The bad guys put this stuff in booz because it is cheap and people got sick 
 and might have gone blind. 
 
 There is nothing you can do to a still full of wine to make it produce 
 dangerous quantities of methanol and you can consider a kettle full of 
 whiskey mash just a very new "wine" for the sake of this discussion.

   It would not take that much more work to provide us with a packaging
   that has a larger yeast population developed before you open it.
 
 There is an alternative and its called culturing.  However, it's sort of like 
 all grain brewing, viz., sounds real spooky till you try it.  Not only does 
 it save big bucks but it becomes as much of an obsession as brewing itself.  
 You can do it in the kitchen in simple stuff or a lab full of equipment.  The 
 bottom line is, yeast is free, it's clean and you can produce any population 
 you feel is needed.  Check out the archives for my article on Culturing for 
 Beginners.

 As I was unable to find a 20 foot turkey baster, I had to take drastic 
 measures.
 
 I cited the specification for the record and then pointed out that it works 
 fine at "sweet wort temp" and presumed we all knew what that meant.  The 
 specification is obviously very conservative.
 
 Furthermore, I would be interested in knowing just what your sweet wort temp 
 is as it flows through the tubing.  I suspect it is a lot cooler than you 
 think.   By the time mine gets down to the kettle, it probably is around 
 there somewhere.  The copper tubing at the end is to protect it from the 
 boiling wort not the stuff coming down from the kitchen.

 I could swear I just answered this but it also appeared in Ulich Stafford's 
 comments on his new mm.
 
 Malted grain is friable and crumbly.  When gently squeezed, it falls apart, 
 exposing the malt to mash water.  This is definitely not true of unmalted 
 grains.  If you have the strength to run it through a roller mill, the best 
 you will get is something like thick oatmeal.  As there usually is no husk 
 involved, there is little advantage to a roller mill over a grinder.  I 
 suspect, a Corona me be more efficient if your lauter tun can handle the fine 
 grinst.  That is, after all what they were designed for but it won't be any 
 easier to crank.

Subject: Freezing Wort






Do you see any problem with freezing homemade wort (extract)?


Next weekend I am going to make another try at a Dopplebock. (This
time with German Pilsner grain as the base, not 2-row in my
quest for that malty sweet German flavor).


My lauter tun can not handle more than about 12-13 lbs of grain at
a time. So this weekend I mashed 10 lbs. of German Pilsner. Boiled
it down to about 3 gallons, put it in a 4 gallon kettle, covered
the kettle and stuck it in the deep freeze.


I suppose there are more convenient alternatives to making your own
extract, but I wanted all-german grain.


My plan next weekend is to mash the remaining 13 lbs of grain I will
need to make this Dopplebock, thaw the "extract" and add it to the
boil.


Anyone see any problems with this proceedure. (Other than spending
an extra brewday mashing grain?

Here's another beer drink to add to the list
1 oz of vodka
1 oz Southern Comfort
2 oz 7-up
1 oz sweet & sour mix
1/4 oz grenadine
2 cups of crushed ice.   Blend all of the above in a blender till it 
resembles a slush. Pour into a 20-24 oz glass. Fill the remainder of the 
glass with your favorite beer. The drink was introduced to me as a 
Combat.  Its a good one.

I feel that Steve made light of Jack's efforts because he complained
about the cost and said right after that he could do a good without
much effort (this is a paraphrase).  A lot of other people complain
about the retail prices of equipment like Jack's and state that they
could do as good for a lot less.  I was just pointing out why retail
prices are generally extremely fair and what really goes into making a
product, rather than a one-off copy of someone's design.  If you make
it yourself and it does not last or does not work quite up to snuff,
then you generally don't complain.  Jack and other inventors have to
make a product which works well and lasts, which most of them do.

I just did a trial mash in my RIMS system using manual temp control by
turning the heater on and off by hand.  When finished, I did the
sparge, but because of the speed of my pump, it only lasted about 10
min.  I can't control the rate of sparge by only introducing sparge
water slowly because the pump does not do well with pumping dry and it
does not go down to extremely slow either.  I have heard of adding all
the sparge water at once and recirculating for 30 minutes and then
just pumping the resulting wort on out.


Any other ideas.  My extraction rate was a rather poor 22 points per
pound per gallon from domestic 2 row, if I go by Dave Miller's rate of
35 ppg.  Residual grain was slightly sweet after sparge completed.


Thanks for the help.

Oh, I might point out that you can immediately start siphoning into 
the fermenter without waiting on the immersion chiller to chill the 
wort and THEN siphoning into the fermenter.  But who cares about 
saving time?


Moreover, after we all agree on the importance of sanitation, good 
recipes, good ingredients, and decent equipment, pray tell what ISN'T 
arguable in homebrewing?!  Isn't that why we love this hobby?  Because 
of its diversity?

Re-absorbed by the wort, huh?  I'm sure you can pull the documentation 
out on that one, can't you, Jack?  And while we're pondering 
possiblities, ponder the reality of having the hop aroma absorbed 
directly into the wort with a nice little hopback hooked inline 
between your kettle and CF wort chiller.  Works great for me at home 
and my little brewpub in town. 


All this is not to say that a well-designed immersion chiller won't 
function fine when used properly.  But "not one unarguable advantage 
(can) be brought in defense of counter-flow for home brewers"?!  Come 
now, Jack.  Methinks you've been dipping into your homebrew a wee much 
this evening.


Cheers to one and all!

When I was in the US Navy, during the 1960's I was told that the
difference between a fairy tale and a sea story was that a fairy tale
begins: "Once upon a time..." and a sea tale begins: "This ain't no shit...."


As an electrician, I had occassion to spend a few hours, now and again, in
the engine room, where electricity was manufactured by steam turbines.  It
was hot and noisy there, but one learned to read sounds.  A pin hole leak
in a live steam line has a special sound.  Once heard, it is indelible. 
One stops moving.  In the fullness of time, a person will reach out for a
broomstick and begin looking for the source of the leak by passing the
broomstick over and around the steam lines.  When the broom stick is cut
in half, the live, pinhole steam leak has been found.  


Live steam is a very useful tool, but one which must be brought into play
with caution and understanding.


This ain't no shit.

Subject: RE: Short spigot on Gott


Sandy Cockerham in HB 1260 asks about a too-
short spigot on a Gott mashing setup.


I, too, added a spigot to a cooler and ran into a similar 
problem --  I drilled a hole for the spigot and found that 
the spigot's threading was not long enough to fit all the 
way through.  By this time, I had to find a solution 
because I had just forked over a good 14 bucks for the 
thing at Sears.  So I drilled a second hole in the outer skin 
of the cooler large enough to accommodate the spigot's 
largest outside diameter (I used a paddle bit which 
chowdered the thing up a bit, but it ain't exactly a 
Chippendale to begin with).  Then I fastened the spigot on 
the inside skin.  I had to remove quite a bit of the 
Styrofoam insulation.  In order to prevent the insulation 
from pouring out, I filled the void with a product called 
"Great Stuff."  This is an expanding insulation foam that 
comes in a can (the package says no CFCs, by the way).  It's 
pretty gooey stuff and it doesn't take much to fill the gap 
around the spigot to seal in the insulation.


It works quite well, though you must be careful about 
preventing grains from getting in as the spigot will clog 
very easily.  I use a rectangular plastic needlepoint screen 
(cut to fit the bottom of the cooler -- ) which I fasten to the 
exposed spigot threads with a bit of picture wire so it stays 
in place.  I'm looking for a better solution to that problem,
though.


[Credit goes to Alice and John `at` Brewers,Asso., 
Portsmouth, NH for the needlepoint screen idea, thanks!]

Subject: Re: Hops FAQ


A couple of questions/comments wrt the Hops FAQ:


<At the end of the growing season when the leaves have fallen or turned brown,
<cut the vines at the surface of the soil and if possible remove the twine.
<After cutting back the vines a layer of 3 or 4 inches of mulch and composted
<manure can be put over the exposed vines for insulation and nutrition during
<the winter.


I read in Brewing Techniques that if the vines are allowed to remain uncut
at the end of the season, the rootstock will build up energy stores for the
upcoming winter season, and be healthier next year.  This is obviously
not practical for big farms, but due to my inherent procrastination, it is
exactly how my plants are now.  Comments?  


<The proper length of time for dry hopping is dependent on the temperature.  At
ale temperatures, 7-14 days of contact time is widely used.  At lager
temperatures, although little data is available, it seems obvious that longer
contact times, on the order of 14-21 days, are called for. It is common to use
0.5 - 2.0 oz. or more in a 5 gallon batch, but as always it is up the
individual's preferences.


OK, how does temperature affect hop aroma wrt dry hopping?  This doesnt seem
intuitively obvious to me.  I also would point out that I have dry hopped
1 BBl batches in the primary (after high krausen and skimming) for a mere
3 days with excellent results, and I know of a local brewpub that has dry
hopped with pellets (I use whole) for one day, filtered and served online
the next, so this will work.  The point is that dry hopping times vary all
over the spectrum, and I suspect if a heavy hand is used in the amounts,
time is less important.  I'm still wondering about the lager comment???

Subject: Spruce beer


I think of spruce beer as one of those seasonal things.  I've only
done it with new spruce growth in the spring.  The color, texture and
smell are all quite pleasant to work with.


The recipe I started with (Papazian?) said 1 quart of new spruce
growth, but I just pick a plastic bag full.  You will find that when
you are communing with an actual spruce tree, you will not want to
pick all the easily accessible growth, and you will get tired of
getting scratched by the old growth before you have picked too much of
the less accessible stuff.


I did one batch where I was less careful about not using any old
needles.  It had a much more aggressive and less delicate (although
still not unpleasant) spruce character.


All this is more fun and probably less likely to lead to overspruced
beer than buying bottles of essence at the home brew store.  Of
course, you can only do it in late May and June.

I hate to criticize a great idea, but if this description is accurate,
it could be **very dangerous**.  The thingy in the center of the lid
(a weight covering a small hole) is what regulates the pressure inside
the chamber. (It basically works because the doohickey has a weight of
15 pounds for every square inch of hole that it covers.  Thus if the
pressure inside exceeds 15 PSI, the weight gets pushed aside a little,
venting some steam, and thus reducing the pressure.)  By modifying
this, you are eliminating the pressure regulation of the pot!  Sure
there is still a safety valve, but this is set for a pressure somewhat
higher than the cookers normal 15 psi operating pressure, also, if
this valve becomes clogged (and it does happen) you now have zero
pressure regulation!  Add a little more heat to the cooker, and the
pressure will go way up, until the kettle explodes violently.


Please, if you're going to try this, add the steam outlet somewhere
else on the pot, but DO NOT MODIFY EITHER THE SAFETY RELEASE VALVE NOR
THE PRESSURE REGULATOR!!!!


Lets be careful out there...

Now, doesn't that appear to you that Steve is making light of Jack's efforts?
It does to me, which is why I also wrote to defend Jack's mill (having made a
couple of roller mills myself).  All your talk about building it yourself for

commercial side.  Dion was right on with his remarks.
