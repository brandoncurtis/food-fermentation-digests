Subject: Wit Bier recipe clarification and info on pre-packaged Black & Tan


It was pointed out to me that the amount of dried orange peel I posted in
my Wit Bier recipe didn't come out as I intended.  I forgot that some
specialty characters don't come out as intendended when sent out over the net.


Anyway, the amount of dried orange peel I used in my Wit was 1/2 oz.


I mentioned that I had found a pre-mixed, commericially available Black & Tan
but was sketchy on the details.  I saw it again at a local store.  It is
Saranac Black & Tan and is made by the F.X. Matt Brewery.  It is a mix of 
stout and lager.  I found it quite tasty.

The Isinglass that I've found is pre-mixed and I specifically asked the
wholesaler if it needed to be refridgerated.  He said no.  Now, I'm
questioning this because of what Norman wrote.  Could the pre-mixed
isinglass be stabilized somehow or does my distributor need to change

Tom asks about making hop plugs at home.


How about a *clean* pipe of some kind and a matching "plunger?"  Fill
the pipe with hops, pound the plunger down till the hops compress,
remove the plug.  I haven't tried this, but it seems like it could
work.

I am conducting a survey of commercially produced hard ciders
available in the US.  Currently I know of the following:


Woodchuck, made in Vermont, two varieties: Amber and Dark.
Woodpecker, imported from the UK
Strongbow, imported from the UK
Dry Blackthorn, imported from the UK
Wyders, made somewhere in the Northwest?
Seven Sisters, made in Idaho.


Does anyone know of any others?  If so, please email me directly.
If at all possible, please include the following information: 


Name of cider:
Name and location of brewer:
Where sold:
Price (for what quantity):
Style (dry, sweet, etc):
Carbonation (still, sparkling):
Approx alcohol content (mild -- strong):


Finally, if you got a chance to taste any, let me know what
your opinion was.


BTW, I already asked the same question of cider-digest readers,
but I only got one reply.


Thanks in advance.  If there is sufficient interest, I will
post a summary.

In deference to the concept of kettle mashing, I thought I'd add my comments:


My converted SANKE 1/2 BBL. keg has a union welded to the outside.  The 1/2" SS
union has the threads exposed on the inside of the keg so that I can attach a
sparging manifold based built from 3/4" copper pipe.  I use an adapter to neck
the manifold down to 1/2" for connection to the union.  The sparging manifold
is based conceptually on the JSP Easymasher and has numerous slits cut on the
 bottom.


Using this device in my keg gives me the same extraction rate as a false bottom
system and this mash/lauter tun arrangement yields extract in the 28-32 pts/lb
range.  In short, my runoff was clear w/o the use of a screen on the manifold
and I found multi-step infusion mashes to be easy to carry-out.  I find the
manifold fab'ed from 3/4" copper to be quite durable and tolerated stirring
and being "whacked" (brewing jargon) with a wooden paddle.


Finally, IMHO an extraction rate of 30 pts/lb is quite respectable from a
home brewing perspective.

I just received a kegging system for my birthday(Cheers to my wife!) The
system is a 7.75 gallon golden gate keg and a 10 lb. co2 bottle. I kegged
a 5 gallon batch and am force carbonating it for a party. My question is:


What are the pros and cons of force carbonation vs. priming?
I understand that force carbonation is faster, but has anyone noticed any
differences in taste? C'mon keggers, give me the wealth of your experience.


Thanks,

taylor`at`e5sf.hweng.syr.ge.com   Todd:
 wants to make all grain beer with a 3-3.5 boil pot?  Don't think so. 
 
 > I don't want to spend alot of $$ for equipment until I know what I'm doing. 
 Or should I just make a 3 gallon batch to start with?
 
 *   "If you make it, you can brew. "
I think you're dreamin' to try to make a 5 gallon batch with a 3 gallon 
boil pot.  You'd need MORE than the volume to boil: i.e. 6 gallons for a
5 gallon batch. Unless you want thin beer!  There are cheap pots out there.
Someone's going to scream at this....but...Get yourself a cheap canning pot
for $5-$20.  Aluminum (cringe...) or ceramic coated steel. Check surplus 
stores. They are out there.  Used resturaunt equipment stores can be good 2.
 
 >How much grain would I use if I can add water to the wort later? 
*Can't do that.  You want the water to go THRU the grain. i.e. get sugars.
 
 >Would I use enough grain for a 5 gallon batch up-front?  Which is ? 
 What would the brewer community re"command" I do? 
*You want on the order of 6-10# base malt (i.e. pale, munich, vienna..etc)
for 5 gallons.  Depending on how stron you want your brew.
Under your circumstances I would suggest a partial mash. Learn the process
on a smaller scale, then find yourself a bigger pot. There are advantages
to a full volume boil even for the extract brewer- read "hop extraction"


*An example:  Mash 4 # pale malt + adjunct grains (e.g. xtal) and
sparge up to your 3 gallons.  Add several pounds of dry malt extract, or
liquid male (oops...I mean malt) extract. Boil...cool...add to carboy,
bring up volume.  Oh....hop the hell out of it of course!  '^/
> >How much grain should be used per gallon of water? 
* See above.  Depends on what you want. American light, or Barley Wine.
 
>What temp is good in the lauter tun and for how long?
I realize this info is availible in books but I don't have mine 
a neighbor borrowed it?  I hope I understand the  process.........thanks 
 
 * Biggest suggestion I can make is...GET YOUR BOOK BACK!!!  You'll 
appreciate having it (if it's any good!).  Borrow his boil pot while 
you're at it :),   Maybe a couple homebrews, his wife if she's cute...nyuck.
Basics:  Mash in- 50 deg C.  15 min, raise to 60-65 deg C for 1 hour.
Mash-out at 70 deg C, sparge.  Iodine testing is worthwhile until you
have a system down that works for you.  What are you sparging with?
Mashing in?  You want to maintain a constant temperature.

The thing you need to do is mash the rice. You can't ferment straight
rice.  There are rice extracts on the market (Williams carries one).
You could use some of the snail spit enzyme mix for your mash (commercial
amylase).  I've never done it.  Never even tried sake, just heard "ugh"'s
about the taste.  But hey-  whatever tickles your pickle.

 tom`at`kalten.bach1.sai.com asked about making:  Hop Plugs
 
 *Question:  WHY?  
Pack 'em in CO2 purged mason jars, and store in a freezer.  Making 
plugs will damage the cones, and probably knock loose a bunch of 
lupulin crystals. One of the BIG advantages of homegrown hops is 
the freshness, and the ability to control exactly what kind of 
treatment they experience.  
 Ok: I'll concede. Smaller space, easier measurement. eh.....
 
 Idea for making them (I've done this with other herbs in the past)
Get a tube- e.g. pvc pipe, and a plunger which will fit tightly.
Maybe a dowel that will fit the ID of the tube. Stuff the length
of tube with cones, then mash them down. You could hammer it or make
a press using a car jack if you're so inclined. Pull the plug, and store.
If you selected a proper length of tubing you could use it as a measure
of the cones-  i.e. make 1 oz plugs.  Cones are not "pre-processed" as 
are pellets- i.e. not chopped up first. If you have a vacuum bag sealer
you could put rows of them in bags, and stash away into months worth for
longer term storage.  Personally, I'm not going to do it with mine.
I have a spare fridge in my basement where my kegs and hops reside.
It is a dedicated fridge, and I'm quite content with that.  Besides its
on the tenants electric bill, so do I worry?

 Subject: Hop Vines & extract storage
 
 >I believe that the roots store many good plant things--such as 
chlorophylls, sugars etc--for their winter slumbers.
*   Um...er...chlorophyll in roots? Not likely.  It's that stuff that makes
leaves green.  Sucks sunlight and turns it into useful energy- stored in
sugars/starches...etc.  (also makes leaves yellow/red in fall:)  Most plant
roots don't see too much sunlight.  Try growing a plant in the dark and
see what color it is.  Not green!  Chlorophyll is produced in response to
sunlight.  BUT roots do store nutrients.  Their MAIN ROLE is uptake of
nutrients from the soil and WATER.  Desiduous plants generally don't
photosynthesize in the winter months. They go dormant.
 
 >When leaves and vines wither, these elements flow to the roots and await 
 the spring. If you do any leaf or vine cutting, as for any perennial, wait 
 till they get all brown and dry before removing...or even wait till spring.
 *   WELL....there is some truth in that...but...
As a plant senesces (dies) a number of phytohormones are produced and
transported through the plant.  Fruit ripening is a response to these
phytohormones (giberillic acid, ethylene for example).  But there are
some negative shock responses which could occur due to frost damage.
may do better to clip the vine at ground level, then add some good
fertilizer (a good reason to have a healthy compost of grains!) into the
surface soil.  DON't overdo it- expecially w/ chemical fertilizers. Read the
directions! Follow them too!  Use this approach rather than wait for 
nutrients to flow down into the roots.  The vines have already devoted
the majority of their goodness in producing those fine fragrant buds
we cherish so.  By the time the plant is wilting it is time to give up
the ghost and separate the vine from the root.  The rhizome will continue
to take up and store nutrients, so it is important to not treat the plant
as being dead after the cones are harvested. Continue watering until
the fall wet-up, or the ground goes cold and hard.  You don't want the 
soil soaking when it freezes, but you also don't want the roots to
starve and dry up before they go dormant. Feed them, cover with a good
layer of mulch (peat moss, bark chips...your choice) and call it a
season.  I do not think leaving the vine intact through the winter is
going to do any good, except the risk of fungal infections, or 
overwintering of pests in detrital matter.
Keep in mind- part of the root's job is to supply water and nutrients to
the entirety of the vine. After the vine is finished there has to be an
advantage is separation- allowing root nutrients to stay down in the
rhizosphere and be stored for the next seasons growth.
Come spring, mulch in some more compost and keep covered from spring
frosts as the new shoots start up.
 
NOTE: I have studied plant growth and phytopathology.  I am not an expert,
nor claim to be.  I planted rhizomes this past spring so this is my
first winter to deal with (for my hops). I have read Beach's book, and 
agree with much of what he covers. I have gardened fairly extensively
for many years, and like to think my thumbs have a good color tone to
them.  For a first year's growth I felt I had a pretty decent harvest
at least from the cascade. My plants generally treat me quite well, and 
I like to return the favor.  Take my words as you will...just don't ask
me anything about distilling. I don't discuss the subject anymore! :(

I winged it.


Now, it's two days later, and the airlock is still quiet... there was
some surface activity (i.e. the beginnings of yeast activity) and the
airlock looked like it was getting ready to bubble, but basically it has
done nothing.  In the past, I've had bubbles from the airlock, and lots
of foam in the bottle.  I checked this am in my older recipes, and it
looks like I used 32 oz of water last time.... could that be the
problem (i.e. the S.G of the starter is too high for the yeast?).

I stand corrected.  I used plugs once a few years back, and my memory could 
be a little fuzzy.  (It couldn't be the homebrew, could it?  8-)  My 
impression was that the 0.5 oz plugs were joined together (i.e. segmented 
cylinder) but that was probably just the way they were vacuum-packed in 
foil as Norm suggests.


However, Norm's observation means the manufacture of hop plugs would be even 
simpler -- has anybody tried it?  Or does anybody know how hop plugs are 
manufactured commercially?

This is incorrect, I just visited Sierra Nevada a month ago.  They do 
not use a hop back or dry hop the Pale Ale.  They just put Cascade hops 
in at the end of the boil.  They do however dry hop the Bigfoot.

 mash-out from a normal mash?


Mashing gives the brewer control (or not) over the types of fermentables and
non-fermentables in the wort.  By changing the mash temperature, you can get a
more or less fermentable wort.  There are different ways to mash which provide
different flavor profiles, etc.  You can buy lots of different types of malt so
your grain bill can have an infinite number of variations.  The debate rages
whether this is good:  Tastes Great!  Less Fun!  More Control!  More Time!
More Fun!  Less Control!  Costs Less!  More Equipment!  etc.


As far as what's involved, you should get a book like The Complete Handbook of
Homebrewing by Miller.  Or just read the HBD for the next 6 months.  A mash-out
is the final step of the mash, where the temperature is raised (a debatable
step in this forum).  It is just one of several steps for all-grain brewing.
Get the book.

I get fairly poor yields with my all-grain beers, compared to other reports,
but it is 25 pts/pound/gallon.  Use this as your low end, and you come up with
10 pounds of grain needed.  I suspect you are shipping about 7 lbs. of extract

We're talking about 5 hours for me, but you need not be present to win.  At

 Nice article.  With a few minor variations, it is pretty much my kind of 
 brewing.  It sounds complicated but the bottom line is one can jump into all 
 grain brewing with a single piece of equipment.  
 
 I can't however, resist the urge to beg authors to have the courtesy of 
 serializing long articles instead of hogging half of the Digest.  Today makes 
 the need for this even more obvious with two of them hogging almost all of 
 it.  I for one enjoy serials.  Short articles hold my attention far better 
 than long ones.
 
 
 >  Comments: You can substitute a faucet with the threaded nipple "built
             in", i.e. the faucet has an outside-threaded extension.
             The problem with these is that there is no flange for flush
             mounting against the outside of the keg. Ideal would be a
             faucet with a flush-mount flange and a built-in nipple extension
             with outside threads. I didn't bother asking for one at the
             plumbing supply shop since I had already bought the above parts.
 
 The part you are looking for is called an "air cock".  It has a flange to 
 seat against the outside of the kettle and a male thread that passes through 
 it for easy atttachment to the female on the inside.  They come in brass and 
 range from 1/8" to 1/2" pipe sizes.
 
 >Another important note. At first, I built an easymasher ala Schmidling,
 though I prefered to call it a "screen penis". I had a couple problems with
 this. First, sparging rate was poor at lower mash temps (compared to what I
 got with the copper tubing device); in fact, I had a couple of stuck
 sparges.
 
 Not sure what you mean by lower temps or why you had this problem but it does 
 not sound exactly like my design or the results experienced or reported.
 
 > Second, the device didn't have the physical strength to stand up
 to mash-in, i.e., it deformed, and once, broke off while I was stirring in
 the grains.
 
 Not sure what deformed or broke but again, I suspect it has something to do 
 with the design.  Mine is a SS screen rolled into a 3/8" diameter tube and is 
 as stiff as the 3/8" copper tubing it is clamped to.  There is no way it will 
 be deformed by stirring.  If you made the assumption that big is better, you 
 may have a problem if it was excessivley long.  Mine is only 6 inches long 
 and only 4 inches protrude from the end of the copper tubing.
 
 > Its rather difficult to solidly clamp a screen around a pipe,
 even when the pipe is outsied-threaded.
 
 Mine uses a SS hose clamp and that problem has never occurred on mine nor has 
 it been reported with hundreds I have sold.  There are, BTW, no threads on 
 the pipe where the screen is clamped to it.  Possibly, it is the fact that I 
 use copper tubing and the SS screen digs into it firmly when the clamp is 
 tightened.  This might not be the case with steel pipe.
 
 > In Schmidlings's defense, though, the device was very simple to fabricate 
 and yielded satisfactory results when it did work, though I got no higher 
 than 30 pts extraction. 
 
 I suspect lots of people would be delighted with yields like that and you are 
 in the range where technique and measurement error cloud the issue.

The recent Consumer Reports has a short article on these.  The upshot is that

I wanted to comment that my boiler has a spigot several inches above the 
bottom of the kettle.  My CF chiller attaches to the spigot via a
flare fitting.  Twelve to fifteen minutes after the boil is concluded, I
begin runoff through the heat exchanger.  By this time, hops and hot break
have settled below the level of the spigot and are not drawn into the runoff.
The price paid is the loss of a few quarts bitter wort: this can be reclaimed
and canned for use as starters if one is so inclined.

It appears that someone has been offended by recent HBD discussions.  So lets
all stick to business now, and don't offend anyone, and make sure we don't get

Alan in Austin asks for clarification:


>In HBD #1264, George Fix discusses the advantages of low alpha hops over
high alpha hops, using lots of formulas & stuff I got lost over.  But
intially he states he feels that low alpha hops impart a cleaner & more
mellow taste.  So, as a clarification, should larger amounts of low alpha
hops be substituted for high alpha hops to impart these same qualities, or
would I be defeating the purpose?  What about using three times as much
2.5% hops over 7.5% hops to make a Sierra Nevada clone, for example?


I think I can answer this one, and add some personal experience.  Yes, you
should use more of the lower alpha hops to achieve the same bitterness as less
of the high alpha hops.  As long as you add the lower alpha hops at the same
boil times as you would have added the higher alpha hops, you will in theory,
have the same amount of bitterness.  It will just be a "cleaner", more pleasant
bitterness.


>From personal experience, I brewed a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale clone with low
alpha hops.  SNPA uses Perle hops for bittering, in the 7 - 9.5% AA range.  I
used Mt. Hood for bittering, at 3.9% AA.  Now I don't know how these two hops
do in Dr. Fix's "ratio test" but I can say that my "clone" was a far superior
beer to the original.  It was very close in all respects, but the hopping I did
was quite an improvement.  This is the real joy of homebrewing.

George Tempel asks:


>Is there another method  that _doesn't_ require gallons
upon gallons of water running from the tap to cool
the wort? I'd rather not keep the local water authorities
in business just to have quickly cooled wort.


Lots of people use ice in one way or another, but I suspect that you will spend
more $$s on electricity (and wear and tear) to run your freezer, than you will
on the water.  I try to conserve, but you can't squeeze blood from a turnip (or
something like that).

BTW, Jack's "easymasher" is described in at least one back issue of Zymurgy.  I
don't know who "invented" it first, but it sure would be fun to see the look on

Without trying to quote from Jack's posting responding to my posting...


Jack, I know the difference between hot and cold breaks -- they happen
under different circumstances.  I leave my hot break behind in the
kettle because at the end of the boil I create a whirlpool (no problem
with HSA, because I don't splash), and then draw the clear (very clear)
wort off from *around* the mountain of protein and hop debris on the
bottom of the kettle.  The cold break is create as the wort passes
through the chiller, and is deposited in the fermenter.


'Nuff said.  My main point is not that my system is inherently the best
- -- on the contrary, my point is that there are a lot of good reasons for
using a counterflow chiller and that dogmatism has no place in brewing.
