Hello Fellow Homebrewers,


I need some help diagnosing a batch that went from bad to worse.
I made a Czech Pilsner using a can of BREWMART Czech Pilsner extract.
I also used 3 lbs extra light DME. The can came with a dried yeast and 
a pilsner enzyme. At 68 degrees I pitched both the yeast and the enzyme.
It took the normal 1-2 days to start foaming but stayed extremely active 
for 2 weeks. A local brew shop said bottle it anyway and that it would be
considered a dry beer. I drank 2 sips and decided to dispose of the entire
batch. I could pop the cap and sit the bottle upright in the sink and watch
it empty its self from the bottom up. Help !! What did I do wrong ?


Thanks in advance !
Cecil Clontz

                                       barleywine
I am interested in brewing a barley wine from
an O.G. of 1.100 or higher, but don't wan't 
F.G. above 1.030.  Does anyone out there in 
HBD-land have personal experience using
champagne yeasts for barleywine?  If so, do
you use only champagne, or use ale yeast and
pitch the champagne when the ale yeast poops
out?  Do you wait until the ale yeast completely
poops out?  Do you rack the wort before pitching
the second yeast?  Do you need a starter for 
dry champagne yeast that is to be put in a wort
that is already 8 percent alcohol or higher? 
Does using champagne yeast by itself produce 
a barleywine with less "beer" flavor?  
Considering the cost of a batch of barleywine,
I don't want to experience too much "trial and error".


Thanks in advance to those who reply,

Subject: hard cider/mead


Here's the recipe I use for hard cider -
 
put your cider in your fermenter, add sugar (normal
granulated sugar is fine) up to about 11-12% potential
alcohol.  Add yeast and yeast nutrients commensurate with
how much cider you've got.  Seal and wait.  I've got about
30 gallons going right now - needed about 40 pounds of
sugar, and it'll ferment for about 3 months before
bottling.  I bottle with more sugar so it gets a nice
sparkle.
 
I also do about a case a year in which I bottle with
honey - about a third of a cup for a champagne bottle.
That gives it a nice apple mead flavor.  The best honey,
I find, is wildflower honey.

Subject: Wort chiller construction help


Having read in for the last few weeks I have seen numerous messages about
wort chillers and their construction.  I think I have a good idea as to
the design of my coil, but I still have a few questions about materials
and other things.  I am going to make an immersion chiller and am planning
to set it up as follows: Hose from kitchen sink to copper coil in either a
bucket of ice water or a cooler with ice water, hose from that to my
immersion unit, then hose back to sink for drainage.  My questions are as
follows:


1.  What are the recommendations on size of the copper tubing, 1/4 3/8 or
  1/2 inch.  A quick stop by my local hardware store raised the question of
  fittings, I'm wondering more about what may be the most efficient for heat
  transfer.


2.  Some commercial wort chillers that I have seen do not put the water 
  through an ice bath first.  Is there a problem in chilling the wort 
  too fast?


3.  I'm planning on using 25' of tubing in my immersion section, is this
  too much, too little?


Private E-Mail would be appreciated unless you think it would be good for 
the masses.  I feel I've taken up enough space on a simple query....


Thanks in advance....

From: mkenny`at`bcm1g01.attmail.com
Subject: RE: Hunter Airstat Modification




In HBD1156 Bruce Ray asks how to modify a Hunter Airstat to maintain 
temperatures below 40F.


I originally posted this last November and have been using it with
the mod very happily ever since.  I use the airstat to control a 
13cf chest freezer. I put the airstat in a manual "HOLD" mode and
simply set the temperature up or down as desired. The airstat is
designed to control a compressor driven refrigeration device (a
room air conditioner) so it is right at home with a refrigerator or
freezer. It turns the attached unit on when it senses a temperature
2 degrees above the setting and off 1 degree below the setting. It
has a built-in timer with a 4 minute delay to keep the attached unit
from cycling too rapidly. At 45F my freezer runs less than 2 hours
total in a 24 hour period and about 3 hours at 35F.


You cannot change the Air Stat range but you can offset the sensor 
calibration.  In other words, performing the following modification
will allow you to set the Airstat at 40F yet the fridge/freezer temp
will be maintained at 35F.


The sensor is a thermister that provides 10K ohms of resistance at 
25 degrees C. According to the thermister data sheet, at 32 degrees F
the resistance is 27.28K and 22.05K at 41 degrees F. The resistance
decreases as the temperature rises so if you make the air stat think
the sensor is 22k when its really 25k the air stat will say 41 but
the sensor temp will be around 35 degrees F. This is done by simply
putting more resistance in parallel with the sensor. Using ohms law,


        Rt = 22K, Rth = 25K (Thermister), and Rp (parallel resistor) =


                Rth (25K) * Rt (22K)
                --------------------  =  183K Ohms
                Rth (25K) - Rt (22K)
 
With this resistor in place the the range of the air stat is effectively
shifted about 5 degrees lower.  Just keep in mind that the temperature
reading on the air stat will not match the fridge temp.


The thermisters change in resistance is not linear. It will change about
20k ohms going from -13F to -4F and only 2k ohms going from 68F to 77F. 
Therefore the desired range of use should be considered before determining
the magnitude of offset. Although, in the 12 degree swing between 33F and 
45F this should not pose a problem.

I installed a 180K ohm resister in series with a sub-mini spst toggle
switch mounted on the front panel just left of the AC outlet and below the
pocket that holds the sensor. It is fairly easy to do since the sensor 
leads are readily accessible. This switch lets me use the airstat normally
above 40 degrees when off and down to 34-35 when on. The airstat seems to
sample the sensor about every 5-10 seconds and will indicate the change
in this timeframe.


Cheers,
Mike Kenny

Subject: Question re: raspberry wheat beer...


Last week I started an extract batch based on the following recipe:


6 lb can Ireks wheat 
1.5 lbs light malt extract
1 lb honey
1 oz Tett (boil)
1/2 oz Cascade (boil)


same as above (finish)


I then cooled the wort, dumped it onto roughly three pounds of frozen
raspberries, and pitched with wyeast weizen (liquid). 


Vigorous fermentation started in 18 hours and subsided in three days.


Now my questions:
1) Upon racking to the secondary, I found a noticeable sourness and a
slight tinge of sulfur oder.  Now I realize that Weizens are supposed to
be a bit sour, so I'm not all that worried.  Question is, how does one
distinguish the difference between sourness due to style and sourness due
to infection ?  Also, will sourness mellow in the bottle ??


2) Papazian says a sulfur oder is "normal" depending on yeast types and
conditions and claims it can be rectified by changing temperatures. The
primary was at ~ 65 F and when I racked to 2nd, I put it in a room at
about ~ 60. Will this help ?? Any suggestions ??


3) Lastly, the raspberries haven't (yet) imparted as much fruity sweetness
as I have experienced in some other raspberry Weizens...  Is it possible
to use something akin to a raspberry syrup instead ?

Subject: Bishop's Tipple by Dave Line


In "Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy", Dave Line gives a recipe for
"Bishop's Tipple", a real ale.  The recipe asks for "1 lb Golden Syrup".
Is Golden Syrup one of those things like Treacle which is unknown in the USA?
Or is it what Americans call Corn Syrup?


Line also advocates sacchrine tablets to give residual sweetness.  I understand
Lactose is a "better" way to provide residual sweetness.  Is there a rule of 
thumb for the amount of lactose to add?  I see amounts like 10-12 oz given in
Cat's Meow.  Is it added to the boil?  Is there something like "One sacchrine 
tablet = x oz lactose"?


Thanks,

Subject: Long Ago Lager




I don't usually post recipes, but I thought this particular beer was
interesting enough, and good enough to pass along.  I became intrigued
with using flaked maize after Phil Seitz reported the Rochefort monks
using it in their strong ale, several months back.  I've been using
it as they do, and getting remarkable results.  While researching its
use, I found George Fix's excellent article in the 1985 All-Grain
Special Issue of Zymurgy (an article in high contrast to the articles
on adjunct use in the most recent Special Issue, btw).  In there,
George outlined a pre-Prohibition lager, with a fairly high O.G., and
a decidedly high hopping rate to counteract the slight residual
sweetness imparted by the maize.  I thought I'd take my own shot at
this style of beer, and am extremely pleased with the result.


Because of the use of maize, and the lack of any specialty malts, the
beer is remarkable pale.  It's also quite bright, and refreshing.
Although the OG puts it in the bock range, the high hopping rate and
the lower malt profile creates something altogether different.  I
also made some changes from George's recipe and took some liberties
with history, but in essence, it should be close to what grandpa (or
maybe Greatgrandpa) could have sipped on his way home from work.


To be completely authentic, I should have used Clusters in the boil,
but couldn't bring myself to do it.  And I should have used 6-row
American malt -- but I haven't any use for 6-row, and Belgian 2-row
is what I had in the basement, so...  The next time, I will use
Great Western's 2-row, if only for a slightly closer touch of
authenticity.  The finishing hops are a believable mix of imported
hops (as called for in old recipes for the better lagers), in this
case using Mt Hood as a reasonable substitute for Hallertau.


I followed George's prescription for using the maize, and added it
after the protein rest.  The yeast was Wyeast's #2007, a thoroughly
American lager yeast.  Thoroughly American, too, was the lagering
period, a mere 2 weeks--mostly because of impatience.  I think another
week or so would have helped, but the difference may be insignificant.


For five gallons:


Belgian pilsner malt   8#
Flaked maize           2#


Water (very soft)     3.5 gallons/ treated with 4gms gypsum


Mash in 115F, raise to 127-130.  Hold for 30 min.
Add flaked maize, raise to 154F for approx. 60 min.  Test with iodine.


Boil 90 min.
Hop additions:
  Northern Brewer     2 oz. `at` 15 min
  Mt Hood            .5 oz  `at` 75 min
  Saaz               .5 oz  `at` 75 min


Irish Moss (1/2 Tb. - rehydrated) at 60 min


OG - 1.072

Subject: Malt Extract for Mead


    When grain is used with honey to produce a non-sparkling drink, the 
resulting beverage is known as braggot. There are references to it in northern 
Europe as old as the first century A.D., and there is a reference to it in 
Chaucer's "The Miller's Tale."   I've made four batches of the stuff, with some 
considerable success.  While not everyone really likes it, some people who 
drink it have said it is the best stuff I make.


     My basic recipe calls for one pound of honey and one pound of malt extract 
per gallon of braggot, but I have seen variations on the theme with more and 
with less of either ingredient.  So, for twenty five liters, I would say about 
6 1/2 pounds of each ingredient.


     If you have a recipe for barley wine available, you could just substitute 
honey for sugar, and that would almost certainly work perfectly well.


      I prefer amber ale extract, unhopped, for use in braggot, but that is 
personal preference.  I'm experimenting with different styles.  I've seen 
historical references to both hopped and unhopped beverages, and varying 
quantities of fermentables.


     The one complaint about braggot that I hear frequently, and with which I 
concur, is that it tastes "thin".  It doesn't have the character of a good beer 
or ale, but it doesn't have the clean taste of a pure mead.  In an attempt to 
correct this, on the advice of an acquaintance who also makes braggot, I used 
buckwheat honey instead of clover honey once.  The resulting product was 
certainly not "thin".  In fact, the first person who tasted it suggested it 
would taste good on pancakes.


     Returning to my friend who had recommended buckwheat honey, he explained 
that you weren't supposed to use all buckwheat honey.  In a five gallon batch, 
he recommended five pounds malt extract, four pounds of clover honey, and one 
pound of buckwheat honey.  For my next batch, I'll try that.


     Does anyone else have any recommendations?

Subject: Yeast culturing--an update


Hiya friends,
A while back, I posted an anguished thread on my troubles culturing yeast
from bottle-conditioned beers for use in my homebrews.  This is a summary
of the experiments I tried in an effort to improve the situation.  I
gratefully acknowledge the very helpful input of the following
respondents (alphabetically listed <g>: Conn Copas, David Gallardo,
Brendan Halpin, Drew Lynch, David Maxwell, Jack Schmidling, and Rob
Thomas.  Thanks a million, guys!!!


Brief recap of the earlier problems: pitched three batches of beer with
cultures from bottles beers; the first was not properly sanitized, so got
an infection.  The second was properly sanitized, but resulted in a wild
yeast infection that can only have come from the yeast that was inside the
bottle.  The third batch had a sour taste that was a mild wild-yeast
infection.  In each case, less than a pint of starter was pitched, just at
high krauesen (I don't know how it's supposed to be spelled <grin>).  The
bottom line here is that 1) one cannot be sure what one is getting in any
bottle-conditioned beer yeast, and 2) less than a pint starter volume of
such yeast is woefully insufficient.


In my experiments, I pitched 1 gallon splits with these <1-pint starters,
and in two cases got great results: in a bitter and in a raspberry pale
ale.  A third 1-gal split had an infection: again it must have been in the
bottle because I was dead careful about everything.  Finally, I pitched a
full batch with a yeast that I'd stepped up from a <1-pint starter to a
half-gallon.  This was a keg bitter that was really good, much better than
any I'd made with Edme dried yeast (the only thing readily available to me
here in the UK).  The yeasts that I got good results from were Eldridge
Pope's Thomas Hardy Country Bitter, and King & Barnes's Festive Ale.  Bad
results came from Hanseatic IPA and Worthington White Label, and an
earlier use of K&B.  However, I do not think that these beers will give
consistently good or bad results; I think it is mostly hit and miss. 


My final experiment used a pure culture from Brewlab at the University of
Sunderland, and I have just transferred it to the secondary.  Tasting it
as I did so, I can state with total assurance that is by far the best beer
I've ever made (about 60 batches to date), with a "real beer" flavor that
I've never achieved before, except my two successful experiments above. 
UK brewers: try this stuff.  Usual disclaimers, void where prohibited, no
parking, the white zone is for passenger loading and unloading only.


An additional note: The wild yeast taste I got in my first two batches,
which I described as sort of mediciny, is EXACTLY the main flavor I have
gotten from several very reputable beers: Chimay blue, Leffe Blond (both
Belgium), Pschorr-Brau Weisse, and Maisel's Hefe-Weizen (in Bayreuth,
Franconia).  This taste was identified as definetly being wild by my
homebrew suppliers (who run a brewpub, so they know what they're talking
about I reckon), and it is a dead ringer for that in these beers.  Go
figure...


Conclusions:  If using bottle-conditioned yeast, step the starter up to
about a half gallon, and TASTE IT before committing it to your brew--keep
a dried packet or whatever on hand in case of failure.  In future, I will
take the plunge into yeast culturing, isolating good colonies from these
bottled beers, and growing them into starter colonies that I then make
actual starter solutions from.  Getting viable yeast from
bottle-conditioned beers can be done, but one must be careful.

The biggest argument against using the enamel on steel pots for brewing in is 
that they chip and the chipped areas will leach iron into the brew.  I don't 
think there is anything you can do to cover the chips.  The hi-temp enamel for 
BBQ grills will not work.  All it is is a high temperature paint and I don't 
think anyone would recommend painting the inside of a cooking vessel.


;2)        Has anyone ever considered electroplating the inside of a
;        steel or aluminum pot with copper, to allow its use as a
;        boiling pot. Is it too expensive, too difficult, etc., or
;        could it work? What about anodized aluminum? Anyone know 
;        anything about this?


If the pot is stainless steel, there would be no need to copper plate it.  As 
for is it too expensive, too difficult, etc. the answer is all of the above.  
Anodized aluminum is stable over a pH range of 4.0 to 9.0.  Heat and agitation
may have an adverse effect.


Bottom line is to either invest in a stainless steel pot, or get another 
enamel on steel pot and take care not to chip it.  This is a perfect excuse to 
upgrade the size of your brewpot to take advantage of doing full boils.

Subject: Hops in Ice Tea


Greetings ,


Most of the beers I brew are Pilsners and I use a lot of Saaz hops.
I love the smell of saaz and enjoy the flavor it gives my beer.
So it was only natural that I wonder how good iced tea would be if
brewed with a small amount of saaz hops. I tried it this past weekend
and was quite pleased with the results. Has anyone else tried this ?

Subject:      Making Mead


It was mead making that got me into hombrewing in the first place.  Being
a beekeeper, I had a surplus supply of honey.  The article I started with
came from Zymurgy and was given to me by my bee landlord (the man who
owns the land on which my hives are located) in hopes that I would brew
it and give him a few bottles as rent.  The article was written by Brother
Adam (the guru of mead making) and was informative but limited in scope.
To augment the article, I picked up a book called 'Making Mead' by Roger
Morse (from Cornell).  I highly recommend this book as a reference.


Concerning suggestions as to what extracts to use, mead contains no
malts of any kind.  Mead is simply a wine that uses honey instead of
fruit.  I have been quite successful brewing straight mead (honey and
water with a champaign yeast), spiced mead (called methylgen sp(?)),
and I've brewed raspberry meads (using fresh raspberries - no extracts
please) that have been supurb!  This summer I brewed a carboy of
peach mead, although I have yet to rack it for a second time and don't
expect to taste it until next spring.  Brewing mead is a much slower
process that beer.  Brother Adam suggests aging for five years, although
my oldest bottle is three years, and there are only five left out of 24.


There are a number of beer recipes that use honey in the wort.  Two of
note from 'The Complete Joy of Homebrewing' are Rocky Raccoon's Crystal
Honey Lager and Holiday Cheer.  Both are excellent!  I entered the former
in a local competition and took third in show.  The latter is a holiday
brew, includes a lot of spices (cinamon, ginger, cloves(?)), orange
peels and honey.  The recipe sounded strange, but the results were
well worth the gamble.  If it sounds good, brew it now and it will be
ready for the holidays.  Rumors have it that Holiday Cheer is Santa's
favorite (next to mead, of course)!

In HBD 1271 Mark Garetz asks:

I think you are looking for the Latin root "gustus," which enables the
mellifluous phrase:


        De gustubus non est disputandum.


Which is roughly "there is no arguing (or accounting) for taste."  Very useful
as a way of expressing mild disdain.  Sadly, when applied to beer, "gustus"
reminds me of one of the megabrewers' (Schiltz?) old ad campaigns.

Subject: Yeast starters and aeration




Greetings,


When I brew I usually make up a yeast starter (about a liter), and
wait until the starter is foaming away before making up the wort and
then pitching.  This has generally worked quite well and I have had no
reason to complain - noticeable fermentation has always started within
24 hours of pitching the starter.


The other day, as I was brewing up a batch of beer, the following
observations did a mental pile up in my neural net:


 - Yeast reproduction begins as an aerobic process ("Gimme O2!"), for
  about the first 12 hours.  This is why we are told to aerate the
  wort before pitching - the yeast will have a nice oxygen rich
  environment to begin reproduction in.


 - The yeast starter has probably finished the aerobic cycle and is now
  in an anaerobic state ("We don't need no stinkin' O2!") at the time
  it is pitched into the wort.


So, why doesn't the yeast in the starter (anaerobic phase) object to
finding its environment changed by being dumped into the oxygen rich
wort?


Inquiring minds ...

Subject: trub separation


i recently got miller's book and was wondering if anyone out there has
firsthand knowledge of how separating the trub from the wort before
fermentation improves the beer.  how dramatic is the effect?  does anyone
pitch the yeast BEFORE this step or is it a good idea to wait until the
trub is separated before pitching?  if you pitch the yeast first and wait
long enough for the trub to settle (1 hour..?) before separating from the
beer, is aeration of the beer at this point still okay, since the yeast is
in the respiration stage?  as i recall miller's book (ch.3), he pitched the
yeast before separating the trub.  is this unusual or am i confused as to
the order of these steps? 


also, i've noticed strange behavior sometimes when racking beer regarding
my airlock.  just after i fill the carboy with beer and put the airlock
on, the water starts to get sucked into the fermenter, slowly.  i only
have one theory on this, to wit:


i generally rinse the carboy out with hot water from the bathtub
just before filling it with beer.  i'm sure the air in the carboy is fairly
warm compared to ambient conditions outside.  as the beer fills the
carboy, is it unreasonable to assume that the final airspace above the
beer is still warmer than outside and when it cools the pressure drop is
what causes the water in the airlock to get sucked in?  does this ever
happen to anyone else?  can this same thing happen if the room temperature
changes?  i'm an apartment brewer and i sometimes have temperature
fluctuations beyond my control. i'm also not home during the day so i worry
about putting bleach in my airlock for this reason.  i sanitize it but i just
put distilled water in for fear of the dreaded fermenter suck.  any advice
concerning these matters would be appreciated.  


just curious

Subject: Fridges


The problem with using a fridge and an external thermostat is that y ou 
have two thermostats going at the same time--the fridge's and the Hunter 
(or whatever). The fridge thermostat usually will only allow the fridge 
to cool to 38 or 40 or so (F), and the Hunter device will try to continue 
to cool, but can't. To solve this--remove the internal thermostat--wire 
the two wires together and let the Hunter do the job. Just dont try to 
run the fridge with out the Hunter--you'll ruin the compressor

 Perhaps it's time to look into another momily.  I get trashed every time I 
 suggest using boiling water for sparging even though I always use decoction 
 for my Pilsners.  Astringency is a knee-jerk response that needs an objective 
 look-see.

 >Subject: Air Stat problems
 
 >I have a Hunter Air Stat and a small refrigerator.  As far as I can
 tell both are in good working order.  The problem is that when the
 temperature reaches the appropriate point the fridge will frequently
 make several abortive attempts to go on, or will run for a perhaps 10
 seconds before cycling off.  After 3 or 4 attempts the fridge comes on
 and stays on.
 
 If it is random and runs normally most of the time it is probably the 
 overload control on the fridge.  If the compressor is VERY hot when it 
 hapens, you have some other problem but if it is only warm, give the little 
 black box a rapp with a small hammer.
 
 Mine does this and I had a digital thermometer on the compressor for weeks 
 and there never was a real problem.  I keep a piece of wood handy and whack 
 it when it gets flakey.  You can buy replacement controllers for about $30 at 
 appliance parts houses.

 >Subject: Dry Hopping Risks/Alphas/Latin
 
 >I'll now quote from the article's conclusion:  "These results
 suggest that the practice of dry-hopping is microbiologically
 safe, especially after three days of fermentation."
 
 >What we learn from this is that you should dry hop only after
 you have a vigorous fermentation going and the beer has a
 reasonable alcohol content and low pH.  
 
 I think what I learned is that the anti-bacterial characteristics of hops are 
 either a myth or greatly exagerated in the brewing folklore.  Clearly, if 
 yeasts and bacteria live on the hops and can innoculate a culture dish, it is 
 not very bacteriocidal.
 
 It would have been interesting if there was a control using a handful of 
 grass clippings or leaves to find out if it was the nature of the fermented 
 beer or the hops that prevented contamination.

My question is how long did it sit with the bubbler bubbling?
(Glad I didn't have to pronounce that.  It might'a come out wierd!)


I would think that you really just want to get the solution full of air
to the max which will dissolve at the beginning of the ferment, then
shut it off, say after a couple hours.  Longer than that shouldn't be
necessary,  unless you have a very high starting gravity.  I know of 
several wines/meads of mine which needed to have a big blast of air 
before they would take off.


BTW:  This IS something I've tried, so I'm not speaking thru my shoe!


My inclination is to add air until the ferment becomes active, then shut
it off and let the yeast do their thing.  If it ferments strongly you
might drop all you s.g. in a couple days.  I generally like to complete
the ferment with a secondary for an additional week.  Overall most are
2 to 3 weeks duration.  If it's fermented, and has dropped out the yeast,
"heck" go for it!  Bottle away.  You can always let it age longer in the
bottle.  But generally things age/balance better in larger volumes.

Mike sez of a keg of 7-up:


>Well, it's not working... I pressurized the keg at 30psi for 3 or 4 days in
a 50 degree garage... then dropped down to a dispensing pressure of
12-14psi. When I hit the tap, I get 7up gushing from it. Foams like crazy,
but the finished product in the glass is pretty much flat. I.e., all the
CO2 comes out at dispensing time.   What's wrong?


*   Drop 'em baby!  I mean...uh...er...drop the PRESSURE. Yes that's it.
Beer is commonly dispensed at 2-5 psi once carbonated.  If it foams, turn
it down.  HINT:  Drop pressure on keg FIRST, then drop pressure in
regulator.  A very full keg can back beer up the gas line.  Not good. :(


Oh- and I don't care HOW long your dispensing line is!  It's not my
business :)!   I don't think it'll cause any problems you can't compensate
for with adjustments to pressure.


Suggestion:  After carbonation at high pressure, drop off ALL pressure in
the keg. Let it sit for ~30 min, then add 2-5 psi, and try delivery.
This will allow some of the excess gas in the liquid to equilibrate with
the head space.  Once enough gas is dissolved in liquid, you really just
need enough gas to push the beer out the tap.

Question on Decoction:


>Wouldn't boiling with the grains cause a problem with increased
astringency and the leaching of excess tannins into the beer?


*   Part of the decoction mash (as I understand it, as if anyone TRULY does!)
Involves starting the mash at cool temps, allowing the ACID REST which
should adjust the pH addequately to the acid side that tannins are not
extracted during the boil.  It was NOT recommended to add gypsum.  


Then you pull off the "heavy third" or whatever of mash.
I used a colander, and pulled off mostly grain from my cooler mash tun.
Put this in my pot, added a bit of water to make it soupy, like oatmeal,
and SLOWLY raise the temp to conversion temp (60-65 deg C). Hold for
15, then raise to a boil.  Add this hot liquid back to the tun, mix,
then repeat.  By the second you should have the whole thing up to temp
for conversion.  So you essentially get 3 conversion steps. Some propose
the third decoction of only liquid.


The mashing enzymes (amylase) are soluble. They will be in the liquid,
mostly.  Part of boiling the grains involves breaking up starch clumps
making them available for conversions, hence the professed increased
extraction rates.  After mashing (last decoction, rest) sparge as usual.


*Disclaimer: I've done 1 real decoction, BUT I've read several books
and articles on it, by the big guys, and some little fries (anyone
ever seen John Alexanders "Brewing Lager"? A few pages to dog-ear there!)
    So of course everything I say is made up and pretend! 
    So don't take it as the word of dog / god or anything like that!  


"...If they put malt in beer and malt in milk. Why not beer in milk?"


*   Uck.  Before or after fermenting?   Try pepsi and milk. (add rum!)
