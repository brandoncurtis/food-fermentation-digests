Bottled too early, probably, but there are other points in your post that
I would like to address.  1. Pilsners are lagers and I've read that there
currently is no true lager yeast available in dry form (lager yeasts just
don't like to be de-hydrated, I guess).  2. What a two-week ferment has
to do with it being a "dry beer" I don't know.  3. "Pilsner enzyme"
certainly has nothing to do with a real Pilsner -- I believe that dry beers
are indeed brewed with some kind of enzyme that breaks the complex sugars
down to virtually all glucose, so maybe that's what they meant.


There is a chance that you introduced some bacteria with the dried yeast
(some have very high bacterial counts) or the enzyme.  This would explain
why it tasted bad and why fermentation took so long.  I advise to forget
the enzyme next time, wait till fermentation is virtually over (I wait till
there are 2 minutes between glubs) before you bottle and see if the beer
turns out better.

Actually, only Berliner Weiss are sour according to style (and that's due
to an intentional Lactobacillus infection).  The raspberries added some
sourness, I'll bet, but it could also be an infection.  If the beer ferments
out to be super-dry, it is probably a bacterial infection.  There is a
bacteria called Malo-Lactic Bacteria (Wyeast has it) which "converts harsher
malic acid to milder lactic acid" but if the sourness is from a lactic
infection, nothing like this will help reduce the sourness.

The sulfur odor will eventually go away if it is from the yeast, but I'm 
not sure if you need to keep it in the fermenter or if you can bottle it
and wait for the smell to go away.

Raspberries will not impart much sweetness.  The sugar in them will ferment
away leaving mostly raspberry aroma.  Some of this aroma will get scrubbed
 -out by evolving CO2 if you add the fruit at pitching time.  I recommend
putting the fruit in after primary fermentation is over.  This will also
reduce the chances of infection.  A raspberry syrup will probably be mostly
corn syrup, which will ferment away also.  What you need to do is to add
some unfermentable sugar to leave some sweetness.  I added 8 ounces of
lactose to a recent 15 gallon batch of raspberry/cherry ale.  It did sweeten
it a little bit, but not much.  I think adding 8 ounces to 5 gallons is more
reasonable for adding some residual sweetness.  BTW, I'm not a biologist,
but I'll bet that Lactose is fementable by Lactobacillus, so be extra
careful with sanitation!

It's a UK thing, as is Treacle.  You can get it (along with Treacle) from some
specialty food stores if you can't get it from your HB supplier.  As for
Tate & Lyle's Golden Syrup.

Line's book was written at a time when there were much fewer choices for
yeast and all the yeasts that he had to choose from were quite attenuative.
A less-attenuative yeast could be all you need.  If you add lactose, you can
add it in the boil, or boil some up and add it at bottling time -- it's
unfermentable, so it doesn't matter as long as you sanitize it.  Adding at
bottling time also allows you to add it to taste, but be aware that the
beer will become a bit more acidic when it carbonates, so you may want to
make it a touch sweeter than you want the final product to be.  See my note
above on Lactose and be aware that Lactose is not very sweet -- much less
sweet than sucrose, fructose or glucose.

The bacteriocidal constituents of the hops is in the lupulin glands.  Lots of
beasties can live on the petals outside the lupulin glands.  These were whole
hops in the study, so it's not surprising that cultures taken from the hops
would grow stuff since the lupulin glands would, in large part, be intact.


>It would have been interesting if there was a control using a handful of 
 grass clippings or leaves to find out if it was the nature of the fermented

Since at dry-hopping temps it takes quite a few days (more than three) for
stuff to migrate out of the lupulin glands, I would say it points pretty
conclusively to the fact that the beer itself is what did the trick, but
it may have been helped along by the hop constituents already in the beer
from the boil.


I'd have to double check my references, but I think the anti-bacterial 
action of the hops is largely bacteriostatic (meaning it prevents further
growth) as opposed to bacteriocidal (meaning it kill the suckers outright).
Again, I could be mistaken on this.  My references are 40 miles away.

Don't you mean "shouln't use the 'Papazian' method?"  Well, the best
source for Hot-Side Aeration (HSA) info, would certainly be George Fix's
article in a recent Zymurgy (three or four issues ago).  If you are using
a carboy and pouring hot wort through a funnel into the cold water below
and if the wort is really splashing around as it goes into the carboy, then
you probably are getting some HSA.  I used to do something like this and
the result was a sort of sherry-like, wet-cardboard aroma/flavor.  If you
use a plastic bucket as your primary and pour the wort in gently, the
effects will be barely noticable.  I can attest to this because I recently
made a few test batches of some "pre-measured kits" I designed for beginners
and gentle pouring into cool water produced virtually none of these off-flavors
(I followed the beginner instructions just like I wrote them, just to be sure).
I noticed that when I switched from the "hot wort through funnel into carboy"
method to "adding 2 gallons of near freezing, sanitized water into kettle"
method, there was a big difference.  Building an immersion chiller improved
my beer even further with respect to eliminating these off-flavor.


Build or borrow an immersion chiller and see if you can taste the difference.
I think you will notice a big difference.

Too bad all this interest in the Airstat didn't come sooner... it has been
discontinued by Hunter due to poor sales.  You may still be able to find
a few at your local hardware store or Builder's Square/Home Base/Handy Andy.
Ask for a "window airconditioner thermostat by Hunter Fan Company."  Many
salespeople don't have a clue if you ask for an AirStat.

There has been a lot of debate on this issue.  Some say that if you use
the blowoff method, you don't need to separate the wort from the trub.
One reason for pitching before separation from the trub is that the yeast
can use some stuff in the trub for nutrition.  If you aerate well, the
yeast can synthesize the materials they need and thus they don't *require*
the trub for nutrition (sterols, I believe).  You can aerate up till the
fermentation begins, but aerating early is best -- why delay?

Your theory is correct.  The cooling/contraction of the airspace in the
fermenter is what sucks in the airlock water.  I suggest putting in just
enough water in the airlock so it will work both ways (forward and backward).
Once fermentation begins you can add a little more so it does not run
dry due to evaporation.

I don't think you have to rewire the original thermostat.  Recall
that both thermostats will say "go, compressor, go" when they think
it's too warm.   If you set the original to 40F and the Hunter (or
whatever) to 50F, the Hunter will tell the compressor to "stop" at 50F and 
to "go on" at 52F or so.  Meanwhile the original thermostat is still
saying "it's too warm in here" and will be permanently on.  The Hunter
only goes down to 40F without modifications.  As long as you keep the
original thermostat set cooler than the Hunter, you'll be okay.

  1 - In New Orleans, I have only seen the Miller Reserve Lager and
Light, but have heard you all mention ale.  Whine.
  2 - Mark Bayer is worrying about fermenting his beer on top of the
trub.  I brew with extracts and cool the wort in the pot in the sink
full of ice water (takes about 30 minutes), then pull the cool wort off
the settled hop pellet, cold/hot break debris.  Even so, I get over
1/4" of trub in the carboy after the initial settling.  I fermented my
second batch on the trub for over a week, racked to a secondary for
another week or so, and it came out great.
I pulled the third batch into a bottling bucket and let it settle for
45 minutes before siphoning into the carboy.  I got less trub, but the
the beer was not as good.  I haven't settled first again.
  I use (clorinated) tap water in the air lock, and it has never been
sucked in and I haven't had infections.
  3 - Lee M.: what about 'manual "HOLD"'?

no microbes, while the leaves had many.


Also: The distinction between "existing" and "replicating".  Many bacteria
and fungi can "sit" in a dormant state, then proliferate when conditions
become more favorable.  


I remember this thread starting with whether hands would transfer
contaminants TO hops, and hence, into beer. 


Again- the difference between existence, and replication.  There are
resident (generally unharmful) and transient (potentially harmful) 
microorganisms on hands and skin.  But if your hands are clean the chance
of transfering danger to brew is low (IMHO).  Resident microbes generally
do not let go very easily.  If you wash well, you should remove most
transient bacteria, and unless you have chicken fat under your nails you
aren't likely to add much to your brew.  


I would wager that commercial hops have been handled fairly frequently
before they are broken down to homebrewer size packets.  The hope of
not adding more microbes at dry hopping time seems irrelevant.
The hope of having created an inhospitable environment for other bugs
is more realistic.

Lyle & Tate are English sugar confectioners, and make both black Treacle

is a cane sugar product, not corn sugar.  as a substitute, I would
recommend turbinado style (raw) sugar, which is not refined as much as
white sugar, and does not have molasses added back like american brown
sugar does.  I used to get 2 lbs of turbinado sugar at the snuck's
gorcery store in Champaign, Il.  A 12 oz bottle of golden Syrup is $5
here in Dallas.  They add about the same taste.  Guess which one I
(would) prefer...

Golden Syrup is a light golden sugar syrup, made by Tate & Lyle.  Has a very
smooth taste.  You could probably make your own by *slightly* by dissolving cane
sugar in a little water to make a syrup, and then carmelizing ever so slightly
to get some color.  My wife uses T&L Golden Syrup in her peanut brittle recipe
instead of corn syrup. 


Yes, you can  find Treacle (also made by Tate & Lyle) in the US, but it may be
scarce.  I asked a grocery store to get some for me and they did, no problem.
They still have a few cans. It also available in better HB shops, along with
Golden Syrup.  GW Kent used to supply it, but no more I've been told.  And, no,
I won't buy it and ship to anyone, I'm buying it for myself.


Treacle is most definitely *not* "simply blackstrap molasses".  Anyone who 
has tasted Treacle and BS molasses side by side can easily tell the difference.
Treacle is very ssmooth and  not at all harsh tasting like any of the BS
Molasses I've tried.


And, for Paul Hethmon, if a HB shop employee didn't even know what Treacle was,
I'd find a different shop.

I gotta disagree with your last statement.  I hadn't done a brew without benefit
of a chiller in a zillion years, but customers bring bottles of their beer to
the local HB shop where I help out.  I've tasted plenty of HB from beginning
brewers who do the CP "partial boil and dump into cold water" immediately
method, and the oxidation is definitely noticeable.  So, some time ago, I tried
it both ways - chilling pot in sink of ice water vs immediately pouring hot wort
into cold water - in a split batch experiment (same yeast, same fermentation
conditions, etc).  The "hot pour" half had a *noticeable*  oxidized flavor not
present in the chilled-then-poured half. I teach beginning HB classes for the
local parks dept, and for the above-mentioned shop, so I emphasize at least
chilling wort in a sink of ice water, if they don't want to buy or make a
chiller of some sort.  Yeah, the "hot pour" batch was drinkable, but the other
was much better, and chilling in a sink of ice water is so easy, and doesn't
take all that long.  


CP's book is great, esp for new brewers, but I'm disappointed he didn't update
things more in the NCJOHB, considering all that's been learned since the first
edition was published.


And lastly, all you keggers who can't seem to get your beer to dispense
correctly, may I suggest that you get a copy of the transcript from the 1992 AHA
convention in Milwaukee.  Dave Miller gave a bang-up presentation on dispensing
of kegged beer.  As Tom Leith' post in #1274 pointed out, one must
balance the keg pressure and the resistance in the tap line to get a proper
pour.  Line diameter, material, and length all come into play, along with the
height the beer is lifted from the keg to the faucet.

Subject: sanitizing bottle washers


Sorry for the encoded version on November 17. Here is the english
version.


Does anyone know how to sanitize/sterilize a bottle washer. I am
referring to the brass device that attaches to a faucet and
releases a high pressure jet of water into a bottle (or carboy).
This device has a small ball inside the end piece which acts as a
valve to shut off the jet of water when the bottle is removed. It
appears this ball prevents the residual water from draining from
the device after its use. This water seems to be the source of
contamination in a couple of my batches. I am not sure if merely
running water through will flush the contamination. I have tried
injecting bleach into the device followed by an overnight soak
which resulted in the device turning a shade of green.


Any advice or assistance will be appreciated.

Hi All,
I've just received an analysis of my tap water. 
Here are the important numbers:
Chloride  25ppm
Sulfate     38ppm
Calcium 54.5ppm
CaCO3     140ppm
Ph            7.7
The CaCo3 seems high, particularly with the amount of calcium that

Good question.  It all depends on your brewing style, equipment, style of
beer to produce, and malt choice (simple, eh...?).  Many lager brewers insist
on a protein rest, certainly weizens need a protein rest.  Many ale brewers
do a single or two step mash, myself included.  With Pale Ale malt, there 
is not much need for a step mash, and I use the *shudder* Briess 2 row malt,
one of the *low* quality malts (as do Sam Adams, Dominion Brewery, and 
countless other "quality brewers").  I used to go for the upward step mash,
but after noting that Dominion Ale is made from a single infusion, and some
California micro mashes all of 5 minutes at 155 prior to lautering.....I 
changed my basic ale mash.  One of the problems of using Briess is it will
convert real fast, sometimes leaving the beer too thin, too low FG.  To
combat this, I have been using more Munich malt (deWulf) to boost the body
and flavor.  I also have tried mashing at 158F , and this has worked well, 
esp when I am making high gravity brews, and diluting them in the kettle
and/or fermenter.  One of the major benefits of doughing in at a lower temp
is the acidulation of the mash can occur, prior to saccaharification.  I
just use some Gypsum, and mash at 15X F for 60 min, then raise to 170. Works
for me.


Good brewing,
Jim Busch

Subject: Filtering






I agree with Jim Busch that filtering can really help your brew.
I would make a couple of observations: 1) Make sure your beer is
about as mature as you want it before filtering. IMHO the beer
does not age much after it has had the yeast removed. 2) Filtering
DOES seem to remove some of the "body" of the beer. As a result,
while I tend to filter my light colored brews, I do not filter
the dark ones.


As part of the message Jim suggests:


>Since I was filtering two quite different beers, I back flushed the filter
>between beer types, and tons of yeast came out.  I still think that a 
>5 micron filter is perfectly adequate for removing excess yeast.


Jim... How do you back flush the filter? Normally, between batches
I first run some water through it, then some Idophor, then water again,
and the start filtering again.

Subject: batch sparge, astringency


   It is known that high temperature is a good way to extract tannins from
grain.  It is also known that low pH inhibits that extraction.  The latter 
is the reason decoction mashing does not cause excess tannin extraction.


  Some (myself included) advocate using boiling water for sparging.  This 
works well, but as the pH of the mash increases as the wort is run off 
(water has a higher pH than the mash), the amount of tannins extracted 
will also increase.  One solution would be to use boiling water for the 
beginning of the sparge, and "cooler" (whatever that may be) water as the 
sparge progresses.  Another solution would be to batch sparge, adding the 
boiling water all at once.  As has been noted, sugar extract efficiency
will suffer slightly with a batch sparge, but tannin extraction would 
likewise be minimized.

With all this talk about chips in enamel pots I have a question.  I have 
been brewing about a year, maybe 6 batches, all extract, some with 
specialty grains, etc.  All batches have been pretty good, but nothing 
stellar (YET!).  Lower cost and ease of use are important factors for me.


Anyway, I have been using a 22 qt Aluminum brewpot (Al. is much cheaper, 
especially for pots this size.)  Is this really a major problem for the 
quality of my beer?  Or is a stainless steel pot more like the "charismatic 
wooden spoon" thing?  If Aluminum IS a real problem, why?  Please remember 
that I am still a beginner, and subtle advantages to my beer will be lost 
amoung all the other mistakes I've been making!  Any help of this would be 
greatly appreciated!  Thanks.

For the person who was looking into brewing in a part 
of the world where hopps are not avialable (in hbd 9 nov):


Before the hop became a popular addition to beer, (12th 
century in England?-- I don't hve my books here) there 
where several other things which were added to beer to 
improve its storage life. The only one I have tried is 
spruce - about 8 oz of new growth for 60 miniutes of boil
 - leaves the malt sweentess and adds almost a "cola" like
 flavor.  Some early American Beers also used spruce.


Primus-Secundus-Tercius:  An early brewing technique had 
several batches of beer made off of the same set of grains.
  The descriptions I have found make is sound like a simple 
infusion mash with no sparging, repeated to make several 
batchs of decreasing strengh.  The recipes I have found
 make one 80 gallon batch of each of the "three threads" 
and use bushals of grain.  Has anyone tried these methods 
at a scale closer to resonable?

I never fly without a bottle, homebrew or otherwise.


They've let me on the plane with homebrew, thogh usually
I just take a couple of bottle of imports.  The only time
security has ever even looked closer was when I had a flask
full of potent Gin and tonic.  The guard just took a whiff to
make sure it wasn't gasoline or something.  Hell, it could
have been everclear!  Once a flight attendant said I wasn't
supposed to drink on the plane, so just keep it low.  Security
guards who do not know what is in the bottle do have a point,
though, so be prepared to check it, chuck it, or chug it.

I *believe* that Golden Syrup is nothing more than invert sugar. I

Invert sugar can be made by adding four pounds of cane/beet (white) 
sugar to two pints of water and 2 teaspoons of citric acid. Heat 
until it comes to a boil. Watch it, the boilover of this stuff makes 
a wort boilover look like nothing. Continue with a low boil for one 
hour. Allow to cool, dilute to one gallon.

Brian Seay asks about barley wine fermentation.  I have one in the secondary
that is progressing (slowly) and I've learned a bit from it that I can pass on:
PITCH LARGE NUMBERS OF YEASTIES!!!  AERATE!!!  This is especially important for
high gravity beers.  I think if you do this, you can use a good attentuative
ale yeast and it will work fine.  DON'T USE WYEAST LONDON ALE YEAST (1028)!!!
I'd recommend the Wyeast American Ale yeast (1056) and a large pitching volume
(maybe 1/2 gallon) of active starter.  If this doesn't get to the FG you want,
you can always repitch a wine or champagne yeast later (I did).  My Old Lucifer
is down to 1.029 after pitching a wine yeast a couple of weeks ago (it has been
fermenting since Sep. 18) and is (finally!) starting to get kinda nice...

>2.  Some commercial wort chillers that I have seen do not put the water

No problem chilling too fast.  My water is sooo cold that an ice bath is
definitely overkill.  Its just a question of whether you want to use more water
or electricity for your cooling.  I haven't compared the $$ costs.


>3.  I'm planning on using 25' of tubing in my immersion section, is this

Just right (of course, you'll get a hundred opinions on this; you could do a
