Subject: HSA


Mike Sharp in HBD#1277 correctly points out that there are two schools
of thought about HSA. In its defense is the well established point that
HSA definitely increases the colloidal stability of beer. This has been
demonstrated in the excellent article by Morton in MBAA Tech. Qr., Vol. 23,
1985, to cite but one reference. Since materials oxidized by HSA are derived
from malt (melanoidins, phenols, et al), HSA does find selected application
for light beers having a low malt fraction.


I, on the other hand, remain very negative about HSA. Removing HSA from my
system has lead to a discernible increase in overall beer quality. This is
not only a subjective evaluation, but indeed the performance of beers I have
brewed in sanctioned competitions has dramatically improved since the change
was made. While yeast quality and proper sanitation are by far the two most 
important issues, in my system avoidance of HSA comes in third ahead of many
other issues.

In the past year or two, I have not considered S.A. (forget the TM junk) a real
microbrew. To be technical, I'd say it is rather a MINIbrew. I make this
comparison like comparing computers. A Mainframe is Bud, Miller, etc. A Micro
is Mendocino, Celis, and the like. S.A. is more like a Mini, it is bigger than
a Micro but smaller than a Mainframe. Lets face it, once you begin to sell
your brew "all over the country" and have (can afford) radio commercials "all
over the country", you're not a "little guy" any more. S.A. is good, "but [there
are] literally hundreds of good, decent people" out there that make a beer as
good or better than S.A. (IMHO).  As far as "Boston" being a trademark, I don't
think that single word is anybody's trademark. "Boston Beer Company" is Jim's
trademark, but I feel you could call your beer Boston Lager, Boston Ale, etc
and would not be violating any trademarks.  Lastly, saying you are going to
boycott S.A. is fine. It is your choice. But asking other people to boycott it
is rediculous. It would be like saying "Boycott Budweiser because they aren't
really the King of Beers", or on another subject "The Washington Redskins,
Cleveland Indians, and Atlanta Braves have to change their names because they
are demeaning" is just as rediculous. IMHO, I don't drink S.A. because I'd
rather pick up some other obscure name that I haven't tried before, like
Fat Tire Ale, or another well known but true micro brew like Black Hawk Stout
or S.N. Porter. Lets quit all of this Jim Koch and S.A. bashing.
The only thing he can not say any more is "four years running". He can still
say "four years in a row" though. Lets get more politically correct. 
Jim Koch may use "slime bag" advertising tactics, but I don't think he IS a
"slime bag".

I'd have to agree with you regarding a slight raise in pH such as
that.  But,the pH 7.0, boiling water is in fact in contact with the
top 1/2 inch of the grain bed.  I agree that at the bottom of the
mash it's likely to be in the mid 5's due to the grain buffering
action, yet this is not a true statement about the top portion,
especially at the interface beteween the 200+F water and the grain
bed, namely the top half inch or so.

Not sure what you mean, but a major componant of judging beer is
being able to separate flavors. If astringency is present it makes no
difference how sweet (or sour, salty, bitter, etc..) the remainder of
the liquid is.

As long as pH is measured at the bottom of the grain. Try this. After
about 45 minutes of sparging (in whatever fashion you prefer).


a. add some boiling water to the top of the grain bed.
b. remove about half of a cup of grain/water mixture (from the top)
c. check the pH


I'd bet the temperature is up around 200F and the pH is not much
under 7.0. One can assume that tannins are being extracted and
astringency created. This may seem trivial to a 20 LB mash, but those
that do partial mashes (say a couple of pounds of grain and extract)
may notice the astringency.


> Finally, it does not address the fact that boiling grain in

Yes it does.  My statement is that pH in the mid 5's (optimum 5.3)
will prevent/reduce tannin extraction.  Boiling a pH 5.3 mash portion
is different than adding boiling, pH 7 water to grain.  Not sure what
you mean here.


I am not trying to convince anyone that this is fact. It is my
understanding of how astringency is created and why astringency is
NOT created in decoction mashing.

Subject: Burners ?


I have been brewing all grain for several years now, the last few using 
a 38 qt. stainless pot.  I am using a large electric stove element 
mounted on a piece of .25" aluminium connected to a 240 volt 40 amp 
source as my burner.  This has proven to be barely adequate to boil 6-7 
us gallons of wort.  Getting the already warm wort up to a boil can 
take an hour (45 min if I cover the pot with an old sleeping bag). My 
question is what are the alternatives for burners?  Would 2 (or for that 
matter 3) small stove elements provide more heat than the single large one? 
I suspect that a gas burner would provide more heat and have been 
considering stealing the side burner off of the propane BBQ. (After a 
massive boil over on the kitchen stove I now brew in the garage, so 
ventilation  is not a concern). Any suggestions would be appreciated!


Thanks in advance.

I include all of the grain bill in my calculations, which I suspect, is one of
the reasons I get lower extract rates than claims here in HBD land (procedural/
equipment differences accounting for the rest).  Anyway, I would like to see
this answered by those claiming 30+, 32+, etc. points/pound/gallon.  The dark
malts, in my understanding, do not add sugars to the liquor, and really
probably shouldn't be added to the grain bill when measuring efficiency.  I add
them in anyway, but I suspect others do not.  I guess one question would be:
if you don't include all grains in the calculation, which ones do you exclude?
You did the calculation wrong, BTW.  For future reference/comparison:


        Extract = (61 pts * 4.25 gal)/(10 lb)
                =  26 pts...


I get around 25 points using the entire grain bill (of course, higher for pale
beers, lower for dark beers), so you are in the ballpark.  You can probably do
better with a "normal" sparge (I do a batch sparge), but it is a good starting
point.  Also, you apparently measured the final volume in the carboy, which
takes into account losses after the mash/sparge (i.e. volume left in the
kettle, soaked up in the hops, etc.).  For a more accurate measure of your
mash/sparge you should take this reading from the kettle.  At this point, you
more concerned with your mash efficiency, not the efficiency of the entire
brewery.  I think it makes for a better comparison with other brewers, too, to
take the gravity readings from the kettle liquor.

        Have these beers that last this long been carbonated via
priming or forced carbonated?  I was under the impression that beers
that are carb'd via priming last only about 2-3 months, due to the
presence of the spent yeast sediment in the bottle.  Please "clarify"
whether these long lasting beers were primed or forced and other
necessary specifics.

Subject: Decoction: Conversion times


RE: My suggestion that one should kettle mash longer than 15 minutes.


I should have prefaced my comment on kettle mash times with the fact that I
use under modified German Pilsner, Vienna and Munich malts for brews with a
decoction mash. I have found these take longer than highly modified US or
Belgian malts to convert.  My primary motivation in using these malts is from 
George Fixes analysis of the Belgian malts in Brewing Techniques in which he
notes that they are lower in the precursor that produces the malty flavor and
aroma compared to good German malts.  Since I am doing a decotion to develop
these components I use the malt with the greatest potential.


RE single decotion step with 50% of the grain.
If the intent is to produce a rich malty aroma and flavor then why don't
you do 2 decotions of 1/3 each like Noonan?


It takes too long.  With the under modified German malts each decoction adds
45 to 60 minutes to the brewing process.

Yes, I've tried it and like it!  However, I feel the balance leaves a
little to be desired - too bitter and too little malt.  I like my
brews bitter, but there's not quite enough malt there to offset the
bitterness.  It is quite a bit darker this year, but, the most
impressive thing is:  THE LABEL!  Check it out!  It's laser-etched
or something like that.  Also new for this year, is a larger bottle
size.  You can get it in the usual 12oz. bottles, or the larger
micro-brewery style bottle of about 26 ounces - I don't remember
the actual size.

Subject: Re:Crabtree effect


          Several recent messages have questioned the type of
          metabolism taking place in bottles primed with dextrose
          (glucose).  The question:


          Is the concentration of glucose in primed beer high enough
          to inhibit respiration (the Crabtree effect)?


          or as stated yesterday:


          >It may actually be that the addition of dextrose provides
          >a carbon source at concentrations below 0.5% and now the
          >yeast respire giving off CO2 and no alcohol (the addition
          >of priming sugar does not increase alcohol content, right?)




          Not an insignificant question since the CO2 yield from
          respirtation is 3 times higher than the CO2 yield from
          fermentation (see equations 1 and 2 below)


          eq 1: fermentation of glucose


               C6H12O6 ------> 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2
                               (ethanol)


          eq 2: respiration of glucose


               C6H12O6 + 6 O2 --------> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O


          (pardon the lack of subscripts in all chemical formulas)


          Perhaps this analysis will help.  You must also remember to
          include the other character in the respiration reaction -
          oxygen.  Three quarters cup of glucose is about 145 grams
          which (at 180 g/mol) converts to 0.805 moles of glucose.
          Respiration of that much glucose would require 6 times as
          many moles of O2 (4.83 moles of O2).  Assuming ideal gas
          behavior (using PV=nRT, P=1 atm, R=0.0821 L-atm/mol-K, and
          T=298K or 25C) that converts to 118 L of oxygen gas!  But 5
          gal (18.9 L) of beer saturated with O2 at a concentration of
          3.16 mL O2/100 mL of water (as per the CRC Handbook of
          Chemistry and Physics) would contain only 0.597 L of
          dissolved O2.  In other words, aerobic respiration of
          glucose in a closed bottle of O2 saturated beer could only
          account for the consumption of 0.5% of the added glucose.
          It seems to me that primed beer must be carbonated with
          anaerobic fermentation (eq 1).


          If so, then the complete fermentation of the 0.805 moles of
          glucose would produce 1.61 moles each of ethanol and CO2.
          At 46 grams/mol, this increases the ethanol concentation by
          74.1 g or 0.4% (based on 18,900 g for 5 gal of water).  I
          would guess the actual increase would be less at aerobic
          respiration is negligible (see above) and glucose matabolism
          is probably incomplete.  As for the CO2, the 1.61 moles
          produced would increase the pressure to about 2 atmospheres
          or 30 psi (again using PV=nRT) assuming the beer is already
          saturated with CO2.  As for the ethanol, this would be a
          maximum estimate.  What is the desired CO2 pressure of
          finished beer?  Does this sound about right?

I had the same problem and recently solved it to my complete 
satisfaction.  I was leaving up to a gallon in the boiler 
especially when large amounts of hops were used.  It really 
bothered me so I installed a copper false bottom in my boiler 
that has thousands of 1 mm dia holes and is supported by a ss 
grid.  It was purchased from Pico Brewing Systems.  My drain 
has a Cu dip tube that goes to the very bottom of the boiler 
and will siphon out all but a few ozs of wort.  If you use 
whole hops, then most of the trub sticks to the leaves and 
acts as a filter.  Pellets can be used in small amounts (I've 
used up to 2 oz), but they will plug the false bottom (I'm 
told) unless some whole hops are used.  I have had no 
problems with carmelization of high gravity initial run off, 
although if you use extracts, I would be very careful to 
dilute the extract well before adding to the boiler.

Not exactly.  High concentrations of sugars REPRESS the 
ability of the yeast cell to undergo aerobic respiration even 
at high oxygen levels.  This is catabolite repression.
In aerobic conditions the yeast DOES produce ethanol, but it 
is oxidized to CO2 and water when the sugar is gone.  In 
ANaerobic conditions the yeast can not oxidize the ethanol 
produced and it remains in solution.

Still an excellent point.

Well, Hitler may have loved his pets and family--we just judge by his actions 
<grin>.  Trademarking may be as old as the hills, but "Boston" is a silly 
thing to try and trademark (read, you can't) and besides, *no one* knows that 
the word Boston is part of any Sam Adams products.  I did a survey of 35 
people drinking the stuff and none of them had any idea.  Every single one 
thought it was brewed by the Sam Adams brewery.


So, Jim may be a good marketer, but he is not an honest one.  That's basically
what we are judging him on.  Dishonest and disreputable marketing tactics, 
whether law suits intended to damage competitors, mislabeled beer styles, 
attempts to subvert competitions, or lies in radio ads, can have only a 
damaging effect on a company or executives reputation.


The sad part, as so many defenders point out, is that he makes a half-decent 
beer.  There are lots of restaurants/bars in the U.S. that carry SA and 
nothing else even close in quality (usually megabrews).  If Koch simply 
refrained from the underhanded activities he could have a slightly bigger 
market and some respect.


Right now, Sam Adams *worst* customers are educated consumers.  They know 
there is lots of stuff out there head and shoulders above his and that his 
tactics are dishonorable.  It may be a tiny percentage now, but I think lots 
of microbreweries out there are learning the lesson from this and emphasizing

Subject: Spice usage information




  Now that you've all already started your Christmas ales, I thought
I'd toss out a little info based on my latest Christmas brew.  I
altered my spice boil schedule based on my guesstimate of how
volatile the desireable compound in the spices were.  Also note that I
use a CF chiller, and take 10 minutes to chill the 5 gallon batch.
You may want to add that time to the times listed below.  The base
beer was a lightly hopped (Cascade/Willamette) high gravity brown ale
(1.080 SG - 1.020 FG), using Wyeast American Ale Yeast


Spice: 4 cinnamon sticks at the beginning of the boil


Result: Warm underlying cinnamon flavor as desired


Spice: 4 ounces coarsely chopped ginger, added 5 minutes prior to end
       of boil.


Result: Walloping fresh ginger taste - too much.  I think this is the
        correct boil time for ginger, but I would reduce the amount to
        1-2 oz. 


Spice: Peel from 4 juice oranges and one lemon Added 5 minutes prior
       to end of boil
Result: No discernable orange/lemon flavor.  I will add these at the very
        end of boil, or possibly via a hop back.

   I've got a glass racking crane, which I stick a flexible plastic hose onto,
the other end into the secondary/bottle filler.
   I used to have problems every now and then with gas building up in the
siphon and eventually stopping the flow.  Then, I figured out that the junction
of the hose with the crane wasn't always completely airtight.  Even a slightly
imperfect fit will result in allowing some air in.  Take a look.  If the gas is
building up at the top of the crane, and you have a similar setup, this might
be the problem.  I have always been able to fix it by twisting the hose just a
little bit, and get a perfect seal.

It looks like an experiment is in order here.  The question still is whether
or not the Crabtree effect is relevant to priming homebrew.  The
evidence so far is that priming with maltose (from DME, krausen, gyle) will
cause some (all?) of the headspace oxygen to be consumed and priming with
corn sugar will not.  General opinion (from those who expressed one) runs to
"it makes no real difference".  Has anyone tried such an experiment?  If
not, stay tuned and I'll report back in six months or so.  BTW, what good
is a PureSeal (tm) cap considering that it has been shipped/stored in a
20 percent oxygen atmosphere for some indeterminite period before use?

Subject: PET soda bottles/Aluminum brewpot


Hello all,
        HBD seems mighty unfriendly these days, especially considering that
the holiday season is upon us, but I'll chance another beginners question.


Do people out there use PET Coke(tm) bottles to bottle beer in?  They seem
ideal.  They are obviously gas impermeable.  They come in a variety of 
sizes, my favorite being 2 and 3 liter (cuts down on bottling time alot).
The caps seem to hold pressure, and you don't have to worry about breaking
them (should be ideal for travel or mailing them).  Plus, if you over-
carbonate, it shouldn't be that hard to release CO2 without having a
gusher.  I've only used them a couple of times (I normally use champagne
bottles with PE corks).  So, other than the complete lack of charisma, is
there something wrong with them that I'm missing?


On another note, thanks to all who responded to my aluminum pot question.
The consensus is that the acid wort can extract the aluminum, resulting in
a "metallic" taste in the beer (which I don't seem to have.)  Also, several 
people noted that the Aluminum/Altzehimers connection was shown to be false,
something about the staining procedures for the brain cells was introducing 
the Aluminum. i.e. Aluminum doesn't give you Altzehimers (I never could spell).


Special thanks to Drew Lynch for his post in 1277 on dry hopping.  A actual 
experiment!  No snide comments!  A sure sign that HBD is "not dead yet!"

Subject: Lovibond color scale


Am hoping for some answers (or at least appropriate references in order to
answer) the following questions regarding degrees Lovibond. 


Is the scale completely linear?  That is, does 1 lb. of 50L grain result
in twice as much color in a beer as does 1 lb. of 25L grain used in an
identical manner.  Does 1 lb. of 500L grain give 50 times as much color as
1 lb.of 10L grain?


Does dilution of a beer with equal parts water result in a halving of the
color rating?


Do formulas exist that will allow one to accurately predict the final
color of a beer based on the Lovibond rating of the grains going in?


Answers to unasked questions may also be appreciated.

In Canada, the Hunter Airstat is imported by Melnor Manufacturing

and is called the Hunter Energy Monitor AC.  I found only one store
which carries it, Canadian Tire.  It's a bit pricey at $80, but

Not homebrew, but that other stuff known as store bought brew.
This happened a few years ago, flying out of Halifax, N.S.
I loaded up my carry on with an assortment of different brands
of six packs (cans).  Nothing out of the ordinary, just different
from what is available here.  That was one HEAVY bag.  As my bag went
into the X-ray machine, I glanced over at the video screen. The cans
showed up as a LARGE black blob. The security person rolled her eyes
into her head and looked up at the ceiling. After about half a

bag and walked away. No questions asked.

What I do is put one or two drops of mash liquor on the edge of a

Drew Lynch writes about planning to build a hopback.  


I gave the design that appears in the gadgets issue of Zymurgy a shot.  This 
design features a ball jar with holes drilled through the lid, gromets, 3/8 
in copper tubing, copper scrubbing pads, etc.  


A couple of observations:  The ball jar top is inherently problematic.  I 
had real trouble getting clean holes drilled (the lids kept producing little 
burrs at the edges). Once the holes were made, the gromets tended to be cut 
to ribbons too easily.  No amount of sanding helped. The "air-tightness" of 
the design is highly questionable because of the gromets.

The rest of the design was not too bad, so I adapted it (as in Figure 1) 
|-).  A number 13 stopper drilled with care does a marvelous job.  I have 
used this changed design with great (IMHO) results.  It is lasting well, and 
works well with a pass-through wort chiller.  Also hopping the finishing 
hops in this way passes hot wort through the hops minimizing infection 
risks.  I sanitize the hop bag by boiling and use iodophors for everything else.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Harsh bitterness/Haze/Extractf




I tend to do the same recipe until I get it right.  Before I commit to the
third attempt I thought I'd run some things by the community and see what
you-all think.  So my second Fullers ESB clone is now four weeks old and
still hazy with a harsh note to the bitterness. Here's my guess as to what
is going on, correct me if I speak nonsense or drivel.


I think the harsh bitterness, which is slowly mellowing, is from the high
alpha hops (Cluster) that I used to bitter (about 80% of the IBUs are from 
Clusters, the rest Kent Goldings).  My guess is that my high sulfate (400ppm)
water treatment and the humulone analogs from the Clusters (a la G.J.Fix in
HBD #1264) combined to to give this harshness.  


The first batch had the same harshness which faded in time, and it also
cleared very nicely.  In the latest I ... (small embarrassed cough) ...
forgot to take into account the water retained by the grist so came up
about a gallon short on my sparge.  It gets worse.  I drained the grain
bed dry, then sparged again with an additional 1.5 gallons `at` 180F. 


Whereas the original 7 gallons of sparge water had been "burtonized", the 
last 1.5 gallons had not.  The burtonized sparge water had enough buffering
potential to keep the pH low during that part of the sparge, but the
last 1.5 gallons had no buffering potential at all.  Also the grain bed
was dry, but kept in a warmbox where it stayed above 150F, then I hit it 
with 1.5 gallons of pH 7+ water at 180F and I think I pulled out just enough
tannins to create a persistent haze but no noticable astringency, though I
must admit the harsh bitterness may well be masking it.


After 4 weeks of bottle conditioning the haze has cleared from only the top
inch of the brew, and a very definite line of demarcation has formed between
the cleared brew and the hazy brew.  If you've ever seen an aerogel, it kind 
of looks like that.  There's no ring around the collar and no off flavors and 
I am meticulous in my sanitation, so I doubt that it's an infection. 


The recipe was 80% Maris Otter 2-row pale malt, 10% crystal and cara-pils, 
and 10% flaked maize.  Everything was mashed because I find steeping a pain.  
And of course I do no mash out.  So now that half of you are convinced this 
explains the haze, what about the other half?


Also, if anyone remembers EXTRACTF, a small program for calculating 
extraction efficiencies, it was finally uncompressed, detarred, and put


Lastly, no one has yet responded to my request (now I'm begging) for a 
Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout clone.  A number of people have queued up for 
the results, but no one has come through with the goods.

 The mash has a buffering effect, yes.  As the goodies are drawn off,
 however, the pH does rise.  This is quite variable....
 
 Indeed it is and makes it clear that I wasn't baiting anyone and the rest of 
 your response makes a mockery of all the absolute dogma that has been

 either know exactly what conditions prevail or experiment to find out what

 Rising, yes.. but "soon"?  How can you possibly know that without knowing the 
 water chemestry and that of the mash?   And what magic level "extracts 
 noticeable quantities of tannins"?  What if I don't reach that level till the

 all grain.   What you save on enamel over ss will pay for the propane cooker 
 if you need one.
 
 If you do go stainless, do not compromise on anything less that 10 gallons 
 (not dogma, just experience) and sooner or later, that will be too small for 
 boiling but will still make a great mash tun.

>From Monday 11/22/93 Chicago Tribune page 15:
 
"Blast from the past"
 
"Thanks to British archeologists and a Scottish brewery, you soon may
be able to party like a pharaoh.  Cambridge University scientists
studying hieroglyphics and wall paintings at the buried city of
Tell al-Amarana believe they have deciphered the recipe and the 
brewing methods for a bread-based ale flavored with anything from 
honey to flowers,  Newsweek reports.  The Scottish & Newcastle
Breweries hopes to tap kegs of the strong elixir by next year."
 
Sounds pretty similar to something Anchor did a few years back.
