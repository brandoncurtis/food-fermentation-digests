Subject: twist-offs, and bottlestuff


I don't think there's any particular trend to twist-off caps.  Brewers
just choose one or the other when they get going.


Sierra Nevada has *always* used twist-offs, as far as I remember.  I
can't verify that all the way back to the beginning, but I've got an '83
Celebration Ale here, and one of the original Bigfoot with the line-
drawing (no color) label, both of which are twist-off.  [BTW, anybody know
when that first Bigfoot was brewed?  I'm sure it's 86 or earlier.  Is it
time to drink it yet?:-]


As for re-capping twistoffs, it's probably a good-news/bad-news situation.
The good news is that the "threads" on the bottle are pretty fragile, so if
a bottle is getting old, that might be the first place that fails.  The bad
news is that you find out the bottle is getting old *after* you've filled
it and tried to cap it.


In this area, there seems to be a microbrewery preference for the 22 oz
(US arcane measure) longnecks.  They seem to be reasonably sturdy, and the
packing density on storage shelves is pretty good.  I used to like the 25
oz Tooth's Sheaf Stout bottles, but they've changed the bottle (phoo on
the silly CUB stamped label) and it's a lot easier to get bottles from the
variety of products from 4 local breweries plus various west-coast micros
than from one brew shipped half way 'round the world.  5 gal, even with
carboy headspace and sediment, is still more than 2 cases of 22 oz, but I
bottle the rest in 12 oz for taste checks, solo drinking, etc.

Tony, you might try chilling your brew (while in the fermenter) to make the
yeast drop.  One micro I toured in the UK does this to clean their beer - 
they chill their ale to make the yeast fall...

For most beer styles, 2.5 volumes of CO2 is

Anton, if memory serves me correctly, 1028 is the stickiest yeast I've ever
used.  I mean it goes to the bottom, and stays there; which makes for great
pouring.  I wonder if you've got another problem unrelated to the yeast???

To those of you have been bashing anyone and everyone that you don't
agree with, I really thought that this was supposed to be a 
constructive and informative forum on Homebrewing. Jim Koch is not,
I repeat not a homebrewer, he is a salesman. Frankly, I'm almost as tired
of reading all this "venting" on the Digest as I am of hearing Koch's
commercials on the radio, but I'm not calling for a boycott of the
digest. Why don't you all stop whining out inane opinions and get
back on track and talk about brewing! Most of us out here seem to
be seeking advice and are not out to stroke our own egos by flaming 
those we don't agree with. If you don't agree with someone, offer a
polite, constructive and well-thought alternative. Enough mothering,
let's get back to brewing.

Subject: chiller break in


Assuming you made an Immersion chiller:
The only thing you need to do is ensure ther are no machine oils on the out 
side.  When I made an immersion chiller.  I soaked it in a bucket full of hot 
water and lots of dish soap, dish soap cuts through oil.  I rinsed it off
and then soaked it in a bucket that I added vinegar to.  The thing came
out looking like a new penny.
When I brew:
After completing my sparge I drain my mash tun into a food grade bucket and 
add any extra acidified sparge water.  I soak the chiller in this the low PH
cleans off the metal.  I then put it in the boiling wort, this cause the boil
to subside, when the boil commences again I wait 3-5 minutes before running 
the water.  I also capture run off water in the base to my shop vac, in which
I have put my brew pot sitting on top of a couple bricks.  This reduces water 
use and reduces cooling time.

prove you know of some great obscure beer produced in a chicken shack by two
dwarf gypsy albino seamstresses with no arms that you can only get three days
of the year cause that's the only time they come to market with it.

Not to once again discount the folks who like to build stuff for their
brewing (not at all, really), but here's what we do:


1. Boil.
2. grab sanitized saucepan and sanitized strainer, common household kind.
3. fill saucepan with wort and lots of hops, pour into strainer.
4. fill saucepan with wort and as little hops as possible, pour into
strainer.
5. when strainer is full of hops, dump and repeat from #3 until pot is empty.


The whole hops do a really good job of straining everything else, like 
pieces of whole hops, pellets from perhaps a finishing, and some of your 
specialty malt grains. Just don't set either the saucepan or the strainer
down, to keep things clean. 


I'd say we waste about 6 oz of concentrated wort with this method. It takes
two people to work best, though. Maybe some of these machines are to help you
better brew alone, to which I say shame on you--find a friend to help. Cuts
costs, passes time better, spurs a perhaps previously unknown bond between
you. Or (gasp) maybe even try to involve your spouse! Brewing beer alone I
fear would make me pretty much a drunk.

According to the instructions from the manufacturer, the caps are 
moisture activated. They should not be boiled, but rather rinsed 
with sanitizing solution and used immediately. If you're real gutsy 
you can just use them without sanitizing and give your bottle one 
quick shake after capping to let the beer do the activation.

        Ahem.  Absolute dogma?  Now who has been spouting that?  I agree, 
and state in my post that situations are different for different brewers.  
Jack, on the other hand, has said to (I paraphrase) "ignore the experts and  
do it my way," without reference to the fact that it may be fluke that his 
way works.  Agreed, as many options should be expressed as possible, but an 
explanation, caveat, disclaimer, whatever should be included if known.

        Excuse my brevity.  Read: "Tannins are extracted to a greater 
degree the more the pH of the mash rises above 5.3, and if unchecked this 
rise will lead to astringent flavours.  This rise is dependant on water 
chemistry, ingredients and techniques."  There is no "Magic level".  It is 
a gradual process, but cumulative.

        You suggested there was no problem with the sparge, and argued it 
by asking why tannins were not extracted during a decoction.

Subject: yeast wash


          Can someeone clarify for me:
          
          The "yeast.faq" describes the process of washing yeast. You 
          pour the sterile water into the carboy, slosh, and pour it 
          back into the jar. Then you "agitate the jar to allow 
          separation of the components. Continue to agitate 
          periodically until obvious separation is noticeable."
          
          This step doesn't seem to work. The more I agitate, the more 
          homogeneous the stuff becomes. Can someone elaborate. Does 
          the yeast stay in suspension and everything that settles is 
          trub? (It looks like the yeast settles too, no? Or did I 
          just wait too long?) I was doing lager yeast--is that maybe 
          different from aleyeast? Is the sterile water separate from 
          the yeast?

I know this has nothing to do with homebrewing, but neither does the Sam
Adams debate that is ravaging this list right now.  This is just to vent my
frustration:


I am getting a little disgusted with commercials for mega-swill "beers"
that are humorous but that have absolutely nothing to do with the beer
itself.  I mean,  a few years ago they would at least take a five second
breather from the funnies to show a glass with some pale yellow liquid in
it, and actually say something about the swill.  now they don't even do
that.  I doubt very seriously that anyone who is on this list drinks bud
light, but there has to be something else we can do besides just avoiding
the stuff.  I just don't think it's fair that these corporations have so
much power.

  A great way to clean a new immersion chiller is to boil it in a
solution of vineger and water.  About '*this much* vinegar should
do it :-).  The chiller will come out shiny.


  As for Jim Koch/Sam Adams, we boycotters realize he makes a good beer,
that he's allowed some credit for the microbrewing boom, and he
personally is probably not really a slimeball.  But his marketing
tactics are obnoxious, harmful to the Boston brewing climate, and
ultimately unnecessary.  Personally, I don't much care if he wants 
to spend his money on advertising, though I would appreciate a little
more truthfulness.  What irks me is when he uses his money to hire lawyers 
for copywrite lawsuits, etc., forcing other breweries to use *their* money 
to fend him off.  He would have my $$ to brew and advertise, he won't
get it to run down other breweries.

I don't know how the original Liberty/Christmas Ales were carbonated, 
but all of Anchor's current products are "naturally carbonated" which
they do by sealing their secondary fermentation stage so the CO2 goes
into solution instead of escaping to the atmosphere.  I don't believed
they are "krausened" with gyle, just sealed up at the appropriate time
in fermentation.  The beers are all centrifuged to remove the yeast and
then flash pasteurized on the way to bottling.  BTW, the very first,
and only, Liberty/Christmas/Anchor Ale was made with sugar as well as
malt, because "that's the way the Brits did it."


I have heard that the presence of yeast in the bottle also tends to
help the beer keep.  I have some one-year old SNPA that is still fine.


We are shipping some '93 now and will have it all available in a few
weeks.  Please call for details as this is not the politically correct

Subject: Metallic/Mineral Flavor


Hi,


The last two batches of beer I've made have had an unpleasant (but not
undrinkable) metallic/mineral flavor.  You can taste it on the back of your
tongue and on the roof of your mouth.  Both of these beers are a darker variety
(a brown ale and a stout).  I have only had this happen two other times in the
nearly 100 or so batches I have made, and I cannot figure out what could have
caused it.  The first two times it happened (over two years ago), I blamed it
on adding Bourton Salts or Gypsum to my water.  I stopped adding anything to my
water and the flavor did not reappear until now.  The only difference in these
batches and identical sucessful batches is that I used Wyeast liquid ale yeast
instead of Whitbread dry ale yeast.  I used the Irish ale yeast for the stout
and London Ale yeast for the brown ale.  I have use other Wyeast varieties with
no problems whatsoever.


Can anyone tell me what may have caused this metallic/mineral flavor in these
batches?  Is there some specific thing that can cause this flavor?  It isn't
just a characteristic of these yeasts, is it?


If possible, please respond by mail to Waara.wbst129`at`xerox.com.  I have been
having difficulty keeping up with the digests lately, so please excuse me if
this has been discussed recently.

Subject: howto siphon hot wort


OK, first the preliminaries.  I'm talking about extract brewing, so
keep in mind the restrictions: lazy, uninformed, etc.


Having heard all the hullabaloo about hot side aeration, I want to avoid
it.  Up until now I pour from the kettle, through a funnel, into the carboy
which has 3gal cold water in it.  So siphoning instead of pouring seemed 
like a simple solution.  So I tried a couple of stupid ideas, which didn't
work, and now I'm looking for better ideas.


I did my last batch with pellet hops, so I wanted to keep the crud from going
into the carboy.  So I stuck some cheesecloth over the end of the hose
but it slowed the flow so much that I couldn't keep the siphon going.
I guess the pot scrubber idea is worth trying, but will the hop crudge pass
through it?  And how do you keep it on there?


Has anyone come up with a nifty-neato design for something to do this?

    Here's something we started the other day... questions
    follow at the end.... -- BUG
 
        ===================================================


        Ye Olde Tarpit Stout 
        
        (Brewed on November 21 1993 by Ambush Bug and Satanic Garden Rake)


        Ingredients:


        Munton & Fison Dark-hopped Malt Extract (3.3 pounds)
        Munton & Fison 3 pound Stout Kit
        4.5 pounds blackstrap molasses (About 60% sucrose and 40% flavoring
        extracts) 
        25 grams of Fuggles leaf hops
        a pinch of cinnamon (Just a _pinch_!  Or, Mr. Bug's idea of a "pinch".
        Ie., a small handful)




        Destructions:


        Over a period of about an hour's worth of boiling, the following
        were added:


        Brew pot 1: (Bug's pot)
        Bring 2.5 gallons water to boil
        dump in stout kit
        stir
        dump in 5 grams leaf hops
        stir
        dump in dark malt                  (15 min into boil)
        stir
        dump in 1/2 the rest leaf hops     (35 min into boil)
        stir


        Brew pot 2: (SGR's pot)
        Bring 1.5 gallon water to boil
        dump in 4.5 pounds molasses.  (NOTE:  _Not_ all at once.  Spread
        this out over about the first 1/2 hour of the boil.)
        stir
        dump in 5 grams leaf hops
        stir
        dump in 2 cups corn sugar  (40 min into boil)
        stir
        dump in remaining hops     (45 min into boil)
        stir




        BOIL THE HELL OUT OF IT! (Specifically, about an hour or so.)




        Dump contents of brew pots into primary fermenter.  Stir.  Pad volume with
boiling water to 5 gallons.  Cool down.  Pitch.  GO YEASTIES!!
        


NOTES:


        November 22, 1993


        4 1/2 pounds of blackstrap molasses may actually have been a tad
excessive.  (This was the thickest, darkest wort I've ever seen on ANY
homebrew.)  That actually makes quite a hefty portion of the total
fermentables, like about 35% or so.  That in itself wouldn't be bad, but
the molasses in that quantity may prove to have a _really_ overpowering
flavor.  You can smell the wort from outside the door of our apartment. 
It may have been better to go with lighter molasses, or less of it.


        (Mind you, that may turn out to be a _good_ thing.  I dunno.  I'll
have to sample some when we transfer it to the carboy.  I have a feeling
that once the yeasties finish munching on this one, we may be kicking on
some barley wines for strength.) -- SGR


[Also, we didn't bother to borrow a hydrometer... My guess is we can
eyeball it for when it's time to transfer to secondary etc. -- BUG]
                


 November 23, 1993
 
   We have a good fermentation going... approx a 6" head of nice brown foam
 and the hop leaves.   -- BUG


        ===================================================


Query : We pitched the dry yeast that came with the stout kit.  We were
        wondering how one would go about pitching some sort of champagne
        yeast upon transfer to the secondary.  We've already got just
        over 23 litres in the primary, and don't want to add any more
        volume than necessary (won't fit in secondary....).
 
        If we just pitched in one or two packets of dry champagne yeast
        into it upon transfer to secondary, what's going to happen?
        Will the original yeast be too numerous for the new ones to 
        get a foothold?  -- BUG

 I have begun work on a kegging FAQ and I will need a few knowledegable 
 contributors and reviewers to help me.  I mean to cover a pretty wide
 range of topics that will include bottle conditioning.  I am especially
 looking for chemists, physicists, cellarmen, and biologists to contribute
 to and review certain parts of the FAQ.  I plan to develop the FAQ over a
 period of several weeks, but I do expect to make progress.  I am also
 interested in submitting the FAQ to _Brewing Techniques_ for publication.
 I do not plan to post every iteration of the FAQ to the two Internet

Subject: Used Brewery Kegs


I was walking around the local flea market last weekend and came across
an old Labatts brewery keg (labelled 1987). The size looked like the 
standard 66L (15.5 gal) keg, but instead of a single fitting on top
for both C02 and beer tap, this one had two circular fittings, one
on the top, presumably for CO2 and another on the side near the bottom
probably for a tap.  On the side about halfway up was a bung.  Here's
the catch. Neither CO2 or tap connection had any hardware connected to it.
Does anyone out there in homebrew land know anthing about this type of keg
especially if and where you can buy the attachments?
 
I am presently kegging with one 5 gal. pop keg, but up here in Canada
even the used Cornelius kegs go for $80 Cdn ($65 US), so I would hate
to pass up a bargain if the Labatts keg is useable.  Any thoughts or
comments are welcomed.


On a related note, I tried calling Defalcos in Texas about kegs, but
got the same response as another recent poster, that they will not ship
these anymore.  Seems that UPS is just too much of a pain for them.
Does anyone know of an alternate source in the Northern New York area.
Ottawa is only 1 hr from the New York border (and ~3 hrs from Syracuse)
so I figure that a Saturday day trip is not out of the question.


Thanks,

Last week, there was a kegging question, that I fired a from-the-hip answer 
to.  The concepts were OK, but I got a constant wrong.  Here is the table of 
values I really used when designing my dispensing system.  This will end-up in 
the kegging FAQ, but I promised it sooner than that 8-)

Two feet of vertical lift provides 1 pound of resistance
Two feet of vertical drop adds 1 pound of apparent pressure,
    ie: requires 1 pound additional resistance
Proper flow-rate is two ounces/second at the faucet


The goal: match the resistance of the dispensing line to the pressure 
in the keg.  Pressure at the faucet should be very nearly zero.  So,
if your beer is stored under 14 PSIG, and your faucet is 18" above
the center of your keg:


         3/4# resistance due to vertical rise
       1#     resistance due to miscellaneous fittings
      12-1/4# resistance due to 5'7" 3/16" vinyl beer line

Subject: Rauchbier aroma


My personal specialty is a Bamberg-style rauchbier.  The smoke flavor is
something I really enjoy and I always get great comments on it whenever
I make a batch.  My technique is very simple.  I use an ordinary
backyard smoker.  I get the grain slightly damp, smoke it over wood
chips for an hour or so, then let it dry for a few days.  After that, I
mash and brew normally.  Experimentation has shown that the Wyeast
Bavarian Lager yeast works best, and smoking between one-half and
three-quarters of the grain provides the right level of smokiness.
 
My problem is that although the smoke comes through wonderfully well in
the flavor, my beer is always eliminated in competitions because the
smoke is so subtle in the aroma that it's not in the same league with
the winners.
 
I have tasted some of the winners at competitions in this category, and
they generally smell and taste like the brewery was burning down around
the batch as it was brewed.  What am I not doing right?
 
Short of using some sort of "liquid smoke" solution (which I absolutely
refuse to try), is there some trick to get the smoke aroma to express
itself more strongly?
 
Any suggestions would be welcome.

I don't believe this is a valid datapoint.  I contend that Christmas Ales
are often much higher in alcohol and that may skew this data.

You fail to mention that they had bittering hop rates that would translate
to IBUs in the vicinity of 200.  High dryhopping levels may just have
been required so that there is some hop nose in the final product.  Recall
that these were wooden kegs and that oxygen is known to kill hop nose.


I don't disagree with the initial premise, but the last two examples I feel
are not good supporting arguments.

I think it may have been 1, 2 or 3, but more likely not bacterial, but
rather wild yeast, and most likely (IMO) the mesh bag.  I, personally,
feel that they are difficult to sanitize well and diffucult to clean well
after use.

It would be appropriate, but if you like diacetyl (butterscotch) you may
want to consider using Wyeast Irish (#1084).  The British is reportedly
the Whitbread triple-strain yeast (with nice, tart overtones), whereas the
Irish Ale is allegedly the Guinness yeast.  I think that either of these 
yeasts are a good choice for a Northern-style Brown Ale.

   Since Noonan and Miller and just about everyone else says that a

   add the dark grains to the mash at mash in.  Otherwise, I will have
   a mash which is the same as a pale ale mash and will have p.h.
   problems.  Is this not correct?


You got everything right except switched the high-low pH deal.  Dark grains
acidify your mash, i.e. LOWER pH, so if you have high carbonate water, you
do want to add the dark grains in the mash.

You place a drop of mash liquid and a drop of iodine next to each other on
a white plate and then carefully watch as you run one into the other.  It's
not easy to spot color change due to starch/dextrins, but you'll get the hang
of it.

You should leave off the water (1.000) when you do this:


        Points = (61 * 4.25)/10 = 25.92


Basically, 26 points/lb/gal.  Not bad -- I would say a decent extraction is
between 25 and 30.

Yes.  If fructose + glucose levels are above a certain level (0.5% I believe)
the yeast will have a tendancy to go into anaerobic fermentation (Crabtree
effect) also.  Note that if Oxygen levels are VERY high (sorry, don't have
my books here) the Pasteur effect can force the yeast to go into respiration.
It is my understanding (from discussions with George Fix) that in a high
monosaccharide, high-O2 environment, the Crabtree and Pasteur effects are
in contention -- I must admit I don't really know all there is to know
about this.

Sucrose is converted to a glucose and a fructose pair by the enzyme invertase
which is excreted by the yeast.


BTW, I read somewhere, that sucrose has twice the carbonating potential of
corn sugar (dextrose, glucose), but have never seen it anywhere else.  I
don't think this is true.  Anyone know for sure?


*************
Somone (sorry) asked about sterol synthesis.


I believe the sterols are used in building the cell walls.  Poorly oxygenated
wort is said to reduce the yeast's alcohol tolerance and this may be
related to the sterol synthesis.

You can use B-Brite or One-Step Sanitizer.  They are peroxide-based.
The active ingredient in both is Sodium Percarbonate, which (if I
understand correctly) is sort of like Sodium Carbonate (washing soda)
and Hydrogen Peroxide when it is mixed with water.
