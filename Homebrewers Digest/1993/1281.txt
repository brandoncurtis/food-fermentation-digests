Subject:  Hello Everyone


Hello everyone, I'm new to homebrewing and I'm new to HBD but I like
what I see.  I do have 2 questions:


1- I've read that Aluminum should not be used as a brewpot, and that
cast iron is bad also, because both can impart a metallic taste to the
beer.  If I can't use cast iron or aluminum, what am I supposed to
use?


2- What do the readers of HBD think of using Grolsch flip top bottles
to bottle beer. I know homebrew shops carry gaskets for these bottles,
but I've never seen anyone buy them.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.


3- And, if you live in Northeast PA, 1-Quart A-Treat soda bottles are
wonderful for brewing.  They cap nicely, and you can bottle one quart
at a time.  Makes filling less tedious(sp?)

Yow!  I don't know where you heard that, but it is actually the reverse, if 
anything.  While there are many factors affecting beer stability in the 
bottle, the presence of live yeast means that the beer will last *much longer*
in the bottle.

Howdy,


Disclaimer:  I'm not interested in SA "politics", so please don't include this
posting in any "Koch bashing".


I have a 6-pack of Noche Buena at home, & am interested in trading 2 bottles
of it for 2 bottles of Sam Adams Cranberry "Lambic".  I figure that someone
out there on the east coast might think this is a fair deal.  For those who
don't know, Noche Buena is brewed by the Cervezaria Moctezuma in Mexico.
It's a deep amber lager, full bodied & mild.  Very good, & it hasn't been on
the American market for a few years now.  It's brewed especially for Christmas.
This is the beer that George Fix referred to in a recent HBD posting.  He would
refer to this beer as a Vienna style, I believe (but I don't want to stick
words into his mouth for him).  Anyway, e-mail me directly if you are
interested.  First come, first serve.  I'm also willing to trade a couple of
bottles of homebrew in the deal, if you are!  BTW, 'cuz of Thanksgiving, it
may be Monday before I respond to any responses.


Peace,

Subject: Beer adverts. and new yeast in secondary
James Clark writes about his displeasure with megabrew adds:
And, I must make a loud second to his complaints.  I suppose
this is flame bait, but here goes.  The mega brews and their 
adverts. do all responsible drinkers and homebrewers a great
diservice.  Maybe James is right and it is not enough to simply
not buy their swill.  "Budmiller" is dangerous to our rights.
It offers no sensation of fullness or gustatory ($5 word) 
satisfaction until you have drank a lake of it.  These beers
are intended to be and are soda pop for adults.  They are 
nothing more than an alcohol delivery system.  They have only
a limited usefulness in our society.  They encourage abuse
by their very characteristics.  I bet the neo-pro's love it.
The "joe/jane six pack" culture plays right into their hands.
There, have I raved enough?  Say yes already.


Trever Miller on adding yeast to the secondary.
Oxygen will be depleted by racking time and yeast added to the secondary
will not respire much.  That is, they will not increase in number
from what you pitch.  So, pitch a vast quantity of yeast slurry.
In order to have enough O2 to start respiration again without
oxidizing the beer you would need to add 2 1/2 to 3 gallons
of fresh wort with the new yeast.  Your fermenter probably will
not handle that!

Subject: Counterpressure Bottler Questions


Hello:
        I recently recieved a counterpressure bottler as a gift. 
Yesterday I got the assorted hoses and connectors that I need to run the
thing, and it didn't take long to find out that I don't really know how to
work it.  There are two general possibilities: I'm hooking it up wrong,
or I'm using it wrong.  So, first, this is how I hooked it up:




        Beer Line in-->        ----------------- ---> Vent out 
                        ------+  +-------
                              |  |
                              |  |
            Gas in ---> ------|  |-+
                        ----+ |  | | 
                            | |  | | 
                                 \ |  | /
                              |  |
                              |  |
                                |
                                V
                          Gas and Beer Out


        My beer line runs direct from the keg to the contraption. My gas
line runs from the tank to a t-fitting, one end of which goes to the keg,
the other to the contraption.
        The way I used it is as follows:  put contraption in bottle. Open
gas valve (noise of gas filling bottle and equilibrating). Open valve for
a while to purge bottle (noise of gas escaping from bottle).  Close valve,
close gas line, open beer line. Wait for beer to fill bottle under
pressure.  Remove contraption and cap immediately.
        The problem: Well, if I thought about it i would have figured out
that since the keg and the bottle are under the same pressure, there is no
reason at all for the beer to move from the keg into the bottle.  In fact,
this is exactly what happens: nothing. Or at least very little.  The beer
enters the bottle slowly or not at all.  I tried using gravity to help me
along, i.e. put keg on table, put bottle on floor.  Besides being very
awkward, this helped very little.
        So, counterpressure experts, what am I missing?  Or is this the
way it "works?" Help.  
                                                Dave Rose.

Well I'll get up on my soap box and suggest there are two Rauch beers here. 
The ones that are drinkable and ones that win competitions! I have had 
several very well made Rauch beers and personally enjoy the subtle play of 
smoke and malt flavors and aromas. Now I had the smoked ale at the AHA 
nationals that won Paddy Giffen homebrewer of the year. IMNSHO it was too 
smokey! We're talken rip your lips off with smoke! There is this numbing 
phenomena that goes on at competition judging that desensitizes all judges 
palates. So you need to decide if your brewing your Rauch beers to your 
taste or for competitions.


Maybe Tom Altenbach would jump in here and tell us a few tales about his 
great Rauch beers and his mixed success in putting them in competitions.

Subject: Beer ads


May I suggest to Mr. Clark that he take his television and throw it out 
the window, much as they once did at the beginning of SCTV (way back 
when). I agree wholeheartedly with him regarding beer advertising, which 
is merely the worst aspect of television advertising (or television 
itself, for that matter). It's been several years now since I threw out 
my television so as not to turn into a quivering blob of mindless animal 
matter, and the few occasions I get to see tv remind me all over again 
why I did it.


Frankly, I'd much rather kill brain cells hoisting homebrews than 
watching tv.

Ed Westemeier asks about smoke aroma...


I think your problem is that you're losing the aromatic smoke oils during
your boil.


I suggest "dry smoking" your beer. Add a few handfuls of smoke in the secondary
and let it really soak in. Or, you could use an EasySmoker(tm) (sorry Jack, I
beat you to it) made of charred sticks tied aroung the end of a copper pipe.
You can make your own easily or buy one from me (not an advertisement).

Subject: Iodine Test: Use or Not?


Last night, for my 3rd all-grain attempt I brewed up 4 gallons of a strong 
Scotch Ale, and managed to achieve only about 20 points extraction. This 
obviously hurt the necessary beefiness of a Scotch Ale wort; going into the 
fermenter the gravity was 56-57 rather than the target 80. Oh well.


Since I've achieved rates of about 25 on my last two batches ( I was counting on
27+ this time due to practice & better technique), I think here the problem 
might be traceable to incomplete starch conversion. Why? 'Cause there were 
traces of black in my iodine test when I decided to sparge.


'Why decide to sparge when your iodine test showed some black?', you ask. Well, 
the mash had been happening for about 1.5 hours (single temp; 152-156 deg.), and
a previous test had shown rampant black. Now the blackness appeared granular- 
there were lots of little tiny dots of black rather than a true black color. 
I've read Miller, and he says that the iodine test is useless because cellulose 
particles react like starch. I decided that those little tiny dots were probably
cellulose particles. I sparged. This was probably stupid. I have a Wee rather 
than a Wee Heavy :).


Did I mess up? Are iodine tests useful? It was depressing to be counting on (and
needing for style) my highest extraction rate yet and to end up with a pathetic 
one. But the best thing about homebrew is that within broad limits it's always 
tasty as long as it's not infected.

Subject: sterilizing bottle caps and Rauchbier


Chuck Wettergreen suggest sanitizing Pureseal caps prior to use with a 
sanitizing solution.  This comment got me wondering.  I never sterilize
my caps by boiling or anything prior to use because of laziness and a 
fear that heat my deform the plastic lining.  Are caps a risk?  Has anyone
taking a slant of packaged caps to see what may live on them, or noticed
contamination that could be blamed on unsterilized caps?


Ed Westmeier wants very smoky beer - why not bubble smoke through the 
secondary (dry-smoking?)?  Seriously, apart from competition reasons,
why do you want smokier beer?  I personally think Rauchbier, or at least
the commercial stuff, is one of the foulest tasting beers on the market
(acquired taste, maybe?).  I had the stuff at Zekes, a bar in Dowagiac
in Southwestern Michigan with over 150 imports, and was informed by
my homebrewsuppliessupplier that once when he and a group of friends were
there one of them asked for their foulest beer, and without hesitation
the barmaid got a Rauchbier.  I remember that the giggest problem, IMHO, was
an overbearing sweetness.

Subject: Crabcake Effect / Sam Adams beers


RE: The CrabCake effect.


Recent studies have shown that moderate to heavy bodied beers, when 
consumed in moderation, can lead to the CrabCake Effect in humans.
Stated briefly the precursors to the CrabCake effect are low quality
crabcakes, usally found in frozen food sections, that contain a high
fraction of bread, flour or other grain based filler.  These cakes
when consumed in conjunction with small amounts of beers higher in Final
Gravity than most American Premiums and Light cause an apparent recombination
in the stomach with the consumer suffering from a feeling that one is
filled with a giant CrabCake.  The most obvious outward sympton is the
inability to consume more beer.  Found particularly capable of producing
the CrabCake effect were products produced by the Boston Beer Company, brewers
of Sam Adams beers.  Additional research is being conducted to determine 
if the method of chilling the prefermentation product has an impact on
this effect.  Noted Italian chefs have indicated that a similar phenomenon,
The Gnochi Syndrome, can be avoided by the consumption of Red Wine.  Though
red wine with fish is anathema with wine lovers research is under way as to
the effect of white and blush wines on the Crab Cake Effect.

Per molecule, maybe.  Per weight, no way.  Just count carbons.
1 mole of monosaccharide makes 2 moles ethanol and 2 moles CO2:
        C6H12O6 -> 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2
1 mole of sucrose (disaccharide) makes 2 moles of monosaccharide:
        C12H22O11 + H20 -> 2 C6H12O6


but they weigh almost the same (1 mole of sucrose (342 grams) is 18
grams lighter than 1 mole each glucose & fructose (360 g total)).


Alternatively, 1 g of glucose makes .489 g CO2 and .511 g ethanol.  1g
of sucrose would make .515g CO2 and .538g ethanol.  So, yes, the
carbonating potential of sucrose is slightly higher (5%) than that of
glucose.

One reaction converts sugar to water, while the other converts
sugar to alcohol.  Does this imply that two different batches
of beer, with identical OGs & FGs, could have significantly
different alcohol concentrations based on the initial oxygen
content prior to fermentation?  Would this imply that pitching
a large yeast starter (maybe using the dreggs of the previous
batch) and not aerating the wort would result in a more 
potent product?  I'm wondering why the homebrew in which I attempt 
to match the OG & FG of some commercial products always seems to
have more of a kick too it?

I recently posted asking about PET bottles.  The responses have been very
positive, that is, there don't seem to be any Major problems with using
them.  A few of the key comments are shown below.  Thanks to all who responded.


>From: John Mare <cjohnm`at`ccit.arizona.edu>
Notes that "Several high-quality British brewers are marketing "real ales" in
PET bottles (eg. Sam Smith). I have also encountered a South African
(Mitchells) and Canadian (Wellington) who successfully use these plastic
bottles."


>From: Drew Lynch <drew`at`chronologic.com>
Notes that the bottles are clear and so one must consider UV degradation
of the beer, which "can give it a skunky smell... so you may want to keep 
them covered."

Subject: getting wort into primary/chiller cleaning/changing yeast midstream


JC Ferguson asked about cleaning immersion wort chillers prior to use.  I 
soaked mine in a solution of TSP, bleach, and water (the same solution I use 
to clean bottles and remove the lables).  It worked great in getting the 
grease and grime off.  The only thing I do now to get it ready for use is to 
put it in the boiling wort 15 minutes or so before removing it from the heat.  
The copper tubing does get a bit brighter after use, but I don't think a 
little copper oxide is going to hurt anything in the beer (if it did, we'd 
have to scrap all of our copper plumbing).


To get my wort into the primary after chilling, I use the same approach Mark 
Bunster outlines in Homebrew Digest #1280 (November 24, 1993).  And if by 
chance some of the break material and hop pellets work their way through the 
strainer into the fermenter, I relax and have a homebrew.  I know Dave Miller 
likes to get the beer off the trub as soon as possible but I really haven't 
seen any compelling information that makes me want to start whirlpools and 
siphons, drill holes in my brewpot, worry about filters, or add another
racking step (and all its complications) to my process. 


In Homebrew Digest #1280 Tever Miller asks about repitching his Tarpit Stout 
with champagne yeast.  My response is why?  I brewed an Imperial Stout using 
only Irish Ale yeast from Wyeast.  I didn't have any problems with it 
fermenting out.

* My problem is that although the smoke comes through wonderfully well in

* smoke is so subtle in the aroma that it's not in the same league with
* the winners.
* 
* Short of using some sort of "liquid smoke" solution (which I absolutely
* refuse to try), is there some trick to get the smoke aroma to express
* itself more strongly?
* 
This is just a thought--no idea whether it will work:


try rigging up some way to smoke your hops. Not necessarily the bittering hops
(although you can try that too), but the finishing hops, the ones that do
much to give aroma. If you don't use finishing hops, maybe try.        


Ah, rauchbiers. I remember being treated to one as a 17 year old in Nuernberg
Germany, in a bar near the medieval castle downtown. My grandfather explained
its origins (it's known as a Schlaenkerla there) and handed me a half-litre.
The smell about knocked me down, and I remember the omnipresent feeling that
I was drinking a beer and bacon fat solution. It grew on me, though, and by
the bottom of the glass I was ready for another. My grandfather wisely
demured--when we stood to go I was pretty wobbly.

I was fortunate enough to get a copy of the following Wyeast Yeast Profiles
from Wyeast Labs (1-503-354-1335) courtesy of our good friends at Evergreen
Brewing Supply in Bellevue, Wa. (1-800-789-BREW).  BTW, they (EBS) have an
impressive list of Belgian malts which, as far as I know, no one else in town
carries (and I've been in them all).

Subject: Grains/Easymashing




Hello All,


Just a few general grain questions:


First of all, I've been looking at a lot of recipes lately to find some 
tasty pale ales and such. Many of these recipes call for something on the 
order of 1/2 #  30 (L) Crystal, and 1/2 # 90 (L) Crystal. Would this not be 
the same as 1 whole pound of 60 (L) Crystal? Would there be any difference 
in the flavors either way?


Secondly, I've been considering buying one or two fifty pound sacks of 2-Row 
malt (There's a place in Orlando where you can get a fifty pound sack for 
$19.95). Since I don't have a mill, I'm going to buy the grains pre-crushed 
(Free crushing). I will probably use them all within a couple of months. 
I've heard talk that crushing grains and then keeping them around for a 
while will cause the grains to "go stale/bad". What exactly does this mean? 
Will the stale/bad grains not give me as much goodness? Will my beer taste 
stale? Should I even be concerned or is this more of the boogy/bogyman 
talking?


Now on to easymashing ...


Sorry Jack, this isn't about an E(e)asymasher (I'm a cooler man myself). 
Here is a technique John Goodman and myself have used to cut our all-grain 
brewing time in half. Hopefully this will help some of you out there who are 
afraid of the extra time all-graining takes. Since my house is only about 5 
miles from work, I go home for lunch (about 10 minute trip). Immediately 
upon arrival, I put about 2.5 gallons of water on my propane burner to heat 
to about 175 F. In the seven minutes this takes, I put all of my premeasured 
grains in the cooler (slotted copper manifold, etc. etc.). Once the water is 
heated, I mash-in and put the lid on the cooler (The mash temperature 
stabilized at about 158-160). Now I grab a quick sandwich (not necessarily 
off of the garage floor) and return to work. Total time: about 45 minutes.


Once back in the office, I work for about 2 to 2.5 hours (this technique 
does call for leaving early, although I guess a 3 or 4 hour mash isn't out 
of the question). When I get back home, the mash temperature is down to 
about 145 F. Next, I heat the sparge water (10 minutes), sparge (30 
minutes), begin heating runnings immediately after recirculation, bring to 
boil (20 minutes), boil (90 minutes), cool/aerate/pitch yeast (30 minutes).


Total time after work: 3 hours. Done by dinnertime! If only I could find a 
way to sparge while I'm at work.

Subject: Thanksgiving


Good afternoon fellow brewophiles,


Came upon a copy of "Early American Beverages" (John H. Brown, Bonanza
Books, 1966) the other day.  This delightful history is full of
recipies for beers, wines, mixed, "temperance", and medicinal drinks
from early colonial times to about the Civil War.  In the spirit of
Thanksgiving, I offer this excerpt:


"Common Beer: Two gallons of water to a large handful of hops is the
rule.  A little fresh-gathered spruce or sweet ferm makes the beer
more agreeable, and you may allow a quart of wheat bran to the
mixture; then boil it two or three hours.  Strain it through a seive,
and stir in, while the liquor is hot, a teacup of molasses to every
gallon.  Let it stand till lukewarm, pour it into a clean barrel and
add good yeast, a pint, if the barrel is nearly full; shake it well
together; it will be fit for use the next day.
                               The Way To Live Well, 1849"


   How's that for turnaround time!  of course there were better
brewers around too:


"English Beer, Strong: Malt 1 peck; coarse brown sugar 6 lbs.; hops 4 oz.;
good yeast 1 tea-cup; if you have not malt, take a little over 1 peck
of barley, (twice the amount of oats will do, but are not as good,)and
put into an oven after the bred is drawn, or into a stove oven. and
steam the moisture from them.  Grind coarsely.


   Now pour upon the ground malt 3 1/2 gals. of water at 170 or 172
degrees of heat.  The tub in which you scald the malt should have a
false bottom... bored with gimlet holes... to hold back the malt meal.
When the water is poured on, stir them well, and let it stand 3 hours,
and draw off by a faucet; put in 7 gals. more of water at 180 to 182
degrees ; stir it well, and let it stand two hours and draw it off.
Then put in a gallon or two more of cold water, stir it well and draw
it off; you should have 5 or 6 gals. (sic)  Put the 6 lbs. of coarse
brown sugar in an equal amount of water; mix with the wort and boil 1
1/2 to 2 hours with the hops; you should have eight gals. when boiled.
When cooled to 80 degrees put in the yeast, and let work 18 to 20
hours, covered with a sack; use sound iron hooped kegs or porter
bottles, bung or cork tight, and in two weeks it will be good sound
beer, and will keep a long time; and for persons of a weak habit of
body, and especially females, 1 glass of this with their meals is far
better than tea or coffee, or of all the ardent spirits in the
universe."


I'll Bet!  Happy Thanksgiving Y'all.

    Hoppy Thanksgiving All you Brew Dudes and Gals,
   A few ago one person asked about crates for beer bottles, I contacted a 
   local dairy and was told that the plastic crates are not for sale, I lack
   blocked grey matter to steal, so I made some out of 1x8 and 1x3 pine, cost
   was about $11 for material and produced 4 stout clean boxes, much cheaper
   than a $15 plastic crate and a whole lot cheaper than jail. Size for 30    
   bottles, 12oz is 12 1/2"x 15" I.D. If any need plans, just hollar.
 
     After fighting the lids on my plastic fermenter and disturbing the 
   sediment, I bought some lids from a paint store, they are NEW, HDPE, and
   they hav an airtight 2 1/2" bung that is handy for checking progress and   
   access for racking. The lid has skirts on the side for easy removal and    
   installation. Cost: $2


    Has anyone out there tried using the cousin of hops for flavoring or any  
   other value? I refer to Green Leafy Vegetable Matter, its a sick bird,
   [ill-eagle] Results?  I am just curious...


    In HBD #1280 Ed asks about Rauchbier, hey Ed I am going to try this;
     Take some apple wood from my pruning, let dry and "charcoal" in my       
    smoker, then add to the primary and let it perk away, just a few
