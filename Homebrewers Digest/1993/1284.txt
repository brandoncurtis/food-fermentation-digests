i am preparing to start another batch and i want to be a little more
organized than i was with the last one.
one thing that i couldn't figure out was how cold you should get the wort
before pouring it into the carboy.  everyone says to cool it down in ice
water, but they don't say what the final temperature should be.

You have 5 gallons of this stuff? Does it smell/taste burnt? (you did
mention burnt malt at the bottom of the pot.)


I guess I would say I'd need more info before I can tell you what to do
with it... what's your setup? I.e., how big a batch of wort can you make at
one shot? What was the recipe? I.e., did you hop this stuff
'appropriately'?


If the proportions are right, you could just brew another batch of wort and
thicken it up a little. If they're all out of whack, or it tastes burnt,
toss it.


On the other hand, if you can make a decent beer out of OG 14 wort,
Anhaeuser Busch will pay you millions for the recipe. :)


>i'm not really able to contribute to the HBD in a positive way (yet).


Heh... just share that super recipe with us so we can share in the wealth. ;)

Subject: golden syrup - the last chapter


Enough with the golden syrup and treacle.  In an attempt to settle this
here is how it's made and what it's made from.


        Golden Syrup is a british style sugar product.  It is made by a
controlled hydrolysis (breakdown) of concentrated (read saturated solution
67% w/v) cane sugar syrup with a strong acid usually hydrochloric acid. 
The reaction is terminated after approx. 1 minute by neutralizing the acid
with a strong base usually sodium hydroxide.  This gives the finished syrup
a dark golden colour and caramel flavour with a very slight salty taste as
table salt (sodium chloride) is produced during the reaction.  Treacle is
produced in a similar way just a requires a longer conversion time.  Invert
syrup is produced similarily with an acid such as citric acid or by
enzymatic means.  Both reactions take place in hot syrup to speed the
reaction.  Chuck Wettergreen's recipe is a good example of how invert syrup
is made as it is often not neutralized after the reaction is finished to
your satisfaction ie. is a lvely rich golden colour.  Heed his words about
boilover and make sure that all the sugar and acid is dissolved fully at
low heat before starting the conversion step.  The reaction would work as
well just below boiling except maybe take a little longer.
        Golden syrup but not treacle is made in Vancouver, British Columbia
by Roger's Sugar by the exact same processes as Tate & Lyle in Great
Britain from usually Australian raw sugar.  Tate & Lyle was asked by
Roger's Sugar to setup their plant in British Columbia before the turn of
the century.  No I won't ship any to anyone but ask your major supplier to
call them and inquire.  They are STRICTLY WHOLESALE.  While your at it
inquire about their demerara sugar.  Makes american brown sugar look like
ordinary granulated white sugar.  Once you taste it you'll never go back.
        For what it's worth, before heading back to university I worked as
a quality control technician in the B.C food industry and am quite certain
of my facts.

Subject: Beer Labels EPS file




Hello,


Recently someone posted a post script file for making beer labels which a
dutifully extracted from the post.  However, through some reason unknown
to me, neither Photoshop nor MS Word (for mac) could read it as an EPS
file.  Would the poster of this gem please send it out again (or just to
me) along with some brief instructions on how to use it?


Thanks in advance.

Subject: Gravity


for anyone who got a good laugh at my last post, you'll like this one (i'm
only writing this to redeem my reputation):


i realized that an original gravity of 14 was damn near immpossible barring
any major disasters in the brewing proccess, so thought about it for a
while and then it hit me:  we had poured the 3 1/2 gal. wort into about a
gallon of cold water and then topped the carboy off with cold water.  this
mixed with the wort just enough so we couldn't see the inversion layer we
had created.
sure enough, today we carefully stirred it up with a sterilized coat hanger
and took a reading and it was up to 28.  i guess that's still pretty low,
but our yeast has been going like crazy for the last 18 hours, accounting
for at least a few points.  
by the way, (when) will the fermenting beer clear up?

Subject: "Falstaff Tappers"




At my not-so-local homebrew haunt, I encountered a person who had several
old "1-case capacity" Falstaff Tappers. They looked like mini-stainless
kegs with a tap on one end. It appeared the keg was intended to lie on its
side. The kegs looked like they would make great homebrew "travel-kegs"
much like the new "party-keg" CO2 cartridge taps. The mini-kegs looked
about 15 years old, but who knows, they were found in an attic.


Does anyone know how to care for these mini-kegs? Can they be re-used
as "travel-kegs" for homebrew? We spent about 15 minutes looking at the
keg, and couldn't figure out exactly how to get the mechanism on the 
bottom of the keg unlocked, or how to pressurize the keg if we did.


There must have been quite some expense in setting up to produce all these
"Falstaff Tappers".


Thanks for any responses.t(

Subject: brewcap


hi y'all,


I bought a brewcap last summer and have just gotten around to using it. 
So far, despite my trepidation over having 5 gallons of belgian-style
ale tipped upside-down in my study (the bubbling helps me think), it
seems to be working quite fine.  Anyway, I seemed to have lost the
instructions that came with it and I need to know the procedure for
siphoning the priming liquid into the carboy.  Any brewcap users out
there?


thanx, andy

Subject: infection?


our first batch has now been fermenting for about 36 hours and the kreusen
has already stopped.  however, last night it was so active that we were
getting a bubble every two or three seconds into the overflow container.
i sniffed the stuff in the container today and it has a very sweet smell.
does this mean that our beer was infected, or is this just because the
immpurities in the foam smell bad?
also, we have a brown ring around the neck of our container from the
kreusen.  the pictures in papazian's book show just a white foam.  so is
the brown stuff bad news?
thanks

For any Washington DC area brewers:


English pub style glasses (straight sides with a bulge running around t
he glass about 3/4 of the way up) available at Dean & Deluca, 3276 M Street
in Georgetown. Perhaps they're a
lso available in the NY area Dean & Deluca's. $2.50 each.


They look like just the thing to drink a good bit
ter from.


Good Brewing,

Subject: Durden Park address, hopping rates


Hello all,
It seems the Zymurgy issue on Old English Beers has caught the
attention of quite a lot of us (not least because of the unfortunate
mistake concerning volumes). Well, first some questions:
I don't subscribe (and suspect the sub is astanomical to Switzerland),
but have read here various opinions on the publication, ranging
from good to a complete waste of money..... Well, should I ask
Santa Claus for yet another present?
Secondly, has anyone got Harrisons (sp?) address, or alternatively
that of the Durden Park club? (Sorry to whoever supplied me with
it before, our mail server choked and died YET AGAIN recently and
I lost all my saved messages).


Finally, a comment on the hop rates in the Zymurgy issue: I've brewed
a 1055 Pale ale with 3 oz Fuggles and 2 oz Goldings. At bottling
time I regretted it considerably, since it tore the roof of my mouth
off. However, about half a year later (sorry no notes here) it
was wonderful. The hop flavour was unlike what I get by any other
means. 
On the same subject, Clive LaPense (sp?) who also write a book on
historical beers, has commented on his recipes in a freebee Brewing
and wine making magazine in Britain. His detractors all questioned
the "ridiculous" hopping rates he gave. His answers were:
1. Let it mature long enough, and
2. Try it.
I would definately agree.


Rob. Thomas.
