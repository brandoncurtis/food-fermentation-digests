I have used Demerara sugar by Tate & Lyle and have also used domestic light
and dark brown sugar in homebrewing.  While I found the imported Demerara sugar
interesting, IMO it is not vastly superior to domestic brown sugar.  T&L 
Demerara sugar has a smooth, pleasant flavor of molasses.  This character is
easily emulated with a quality domestic light brown sugar or light molasses.

I have been using the Belgians malts for a while and would like to try some

Does anybody know where I could mail-order some good German malt?

Relax mon.  Everything sounds like it is going in a normal way.
If you want, you can rack it off to a secondary container, but this
isn't necessary.

Subject: which yeast?


I have a doppelbock recipe that has performed well in contests, and in the
quest for the best( also known as the never ending tweak), I started thinking
about choice of yeast. I've used Wyeast 2308 Munich, made into a starter.
Fermented `at`47 f for 3 weeks, 55f for 1week,back to 47 f for 1 week, then
lager at 32f for 3 -4 weeks.      Does anyone have experience with (or
contrast/compare) Wyeast 2308 munich  vs. Wyeast 2206 Bavarian?
  The 2206 Bavarian description seems to stress the smooth  maltiness that a
doppelbock should have.
  I have a fridge to use for lagering, so low temp ferments aren't a problem
for me.
  Any thoughts here would be appreciated.
THANKS MUCH.

Subject: Alternative FAQ Formats






In Homebrew Digest #1282, Bob Regent (b_regent`at`holonet.net) mentioned that he
was creating a PageMaker layout and Windows help file of the Yeast FAQ and
asked if these were useful.


My feeling on this is "No---not the way they are."


While a nicely laid out booklet format for the FAQ might be useful, putting
it up on the net in a vendor-specific format requiring a specific brand and
model of printer is decidedly net-user-hostile. Generally Bob, people put
things up in a format that is NOT limited to one software and/or hardware
vendor's products so that as many people as possible can make use of your
hard work and so when the specific product you geared your work toward is
phased out your work doesn't become a useless disk-space waster.


For most information, ASCII text is the most useful format, so you'll find
that no matter how great a job you do, the ASCII format will still probably
be more often used because EVERY platform and software can handle an ASCII
file. For a layout, PostScript is the most intelligent choice because it
is supported by a wide range of different vendors and because PostScript
file viewers are available for most platforms and because LOTS of different
software can import PostScript. (DVI or TeX are not unreasonable choices,
but not as many people know how to handle DVI or TeX files so these aren't
optimal choices).


For the Windows help files, I'd say these are pretty much useless for two
reasons:
1) Form doesn't follow function. When I'm brewing or culturing yeast, I'm
   doing so in my kitchen, not at my computer. A document like the layout can
   be printed out and taken to the kitchen with me to look at as I perform
   whatever process is being described, a help file is totally useless
   because I don't keep my computer in my kitchen. Simply a mis-application
   of technology.
2) Vendor-specific again. Not EVERYBODY uses or wants to use MS-Windows.


If you really are enamored of hypertext help, then a generically useful
format that allows for information discovery might have some utility.
This means investigating tools like HTML and WWW to put up a net-based
hypertext that anyone anywhere in the world can access with a click
of the mouse. This might require some work, but would be a useful
tool.


In any case, stay away from vendor-specific formats if you want to be
a good net citizen.


Salut!

In the NCJOHB it says there is an advantage to the removal of the very 
bitter and brown resinous scum on top of the kraeusen (less of a "bite" and 
the "fusel" oils are removed which contribute to what is referred to as 
"beer headaches").  A "closed" fermentation system (5 gal carboy with a 
overflow tube) facilates this.  I use a 6 gal carboy with an airlock 
("open" fermentation system).  Should I switch to a "closed" system and is 
there really a noticeable improvement in the flavor of the brew?

Subject: HSA again...


In Austin + Pugsley's article in the special issue Zymurgy they describe 
the technique for a good infusion mash.  They say to use enough hot water 
to cover the false bottom, then run a stream of strike water and a stream 
of crushed malt together, so the malt is thoroughly covered with water when 
it gets to the bottom.  Once the mash lands, leave it.  They also say that 
the streaming process traps air in the mash, making it more buoyant, so 
that it does not jam up the false bottom.  This mention of trapping air in 
the mash set off little alarm bells.  Can it be that less air contact is 
made this way than gently stirring?  Or is this just the case for large 
scale mashes, where "gently" stirring is next to impossible?

Subject: Re: Rauchbier


This last May, I took a beer trip to Germany and one of my stops was in
Bamberg, home of Rauchbier.  My only previous experience with this style
was Kaiserdom Rauchbier, which I found to be totally undrinkable.
However, when we were in Germany, a friend of mine (who is not known for
drinking 'weird' beer) recommended Spezial from Bamberg.  Also, Michael
Jackson recommends Schlenkerla in his world guide to beer.  So, we
stopped in at Spezial first.  I was amazed at how good the beer was.
The smoky flavor was clearly there, but balanced perfectly with a
wonderful malty sweetness.  While the smoke was assertive, it wasn't a
sharp, harsh, or chemical-like flavor.  I was talking to my table-mates
(who were all local) about America and beer.  They asked me how I liked
my beer.  I told them that I liked it alot and that I had only had
Rauchbier once before I came to Bamberg and that it had been Kaiserdom.
Before I could say that I hadn't cared for the Kaiserdom, my table-mates
spit on the floor and told me, "Peh!!  That is awful beer.  No, Spezial
is the real Rauchbier."  Then they leaned forward to impart a great
secret:  that the *best* Rauchbier is Schlenkerla.  They proceeded to
draw me a map to get to the place.  One fellow explained that I would
have to have 3 beers when I went there.  He said I might find the first
one a little bit strong.  He wasn't able to tell me if it was strong
with smoke or alcohol.  Anyway, by the time I finished the first one,
I'd be accustomed to the beer and be ready to have a second, where I
could really appreciate the taste.  I asked him why I should drink a
third.  He lookedd at me as if I were crazy, "Because it is so good, of
course."


We made it to Schlenkerla the next day.  This beer was also very malty.
The smoke flavor was slightly heavier and the beer was more alcoholic.
I liked it from the first sip (no need to get acclimated), but my wife
preferred the Spezial because it was mellower.


I judged Smoked beers in the first round of the AHA nationals (in
Denver).  The style includes rauchbiers as well as other styles.  I was
warned that many of the entries would be likely to rip our heads off
with smoke flavor.  Actually, I found two or three good examples of
rauchbier which had assertive yet complementary smoke flavor.  I also
learned that peat smoked beers (like at least one smoked porter and some
smoked Scotch ales) can have a very harsh, phenolic character.  There
were also a couple of entries that had very little smoke character at
all.  One of the other judges was familiar with Bamberg style rauchbiers
and both the other were experienced with other smoked beers.  I think
that we passed on some good beer, none of which were overwhelmingly
smokey.  However, I do believe that this is a style where one person's
evaluation of overwhelming corresponds to another's evaluation as
perfect.

One way to avoid this problem is to wait to add the dark malts until
mash-out (or until after conversion).  I do this with my porters,
and have achieved excellent results.  You still get all the color
and roastiness out of the malt, and perhaps get less harsh tannins &c.
out of the black grains.


I've got a question of my own regarding apple cider.  I made my first
batch this fall, using apples from the tree in my back yard.  Boy howdy,
pressing apples is a pain!  Next year I'll probably use fresh,
unpreserved juice to start off with.  However, you see both "apple
juice" and "apple cider" in the stores.  Is there a difference?  If so,
is it chemical, biological, or just legal/regulatory?  And of course,
which will make better hard cider?

From: gjfix`at`utamat.uta.edu (George J Fix)
Subject: Caustic washing


Glenn Anderson asks in HBD#1281 about residuals from caustic (NaOH)
detergents.


First, let me say that a 2% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution is the 
most effective detergent known to me for removing heavy organic soils.
This, however, is not play stuff. Protective gloves and glasses are
definitely required to prevent severe burns.


Pure reaction quality NaOH can be obtained in grocery stores under
various product names. The one most widely available in the Southwest
is called Red Devil. Analysis has shown that it is indeed 100% NaOH,
and contains no impurities. You can get the same stuff from Fisher Scientific,
but at an outrageous price.


Caustics are strong surfactants, and will definitely leave an inorganic
film. Vigorous hot water rinsing may or may not completely remove this film.
Thus in commercial practice a caustic wash is followed by a rinse with a
sequestering agent to remove inorganic residuals. The most popular such
agent by far is phosphoric acid. The main reason for this is that it is a
weak acid that is natural to beer. A widely used sequence goes as follows:


      a. Hot water pre-rinse
      b. Caustic wash
      c. Hot water rinse
      d. Phosphoric acid wash
      e. Hot water rinse


This is generally all that is required of brewing equipment. Cooling apparatus,
fermenters, et al need an additional sanitation sequence.


Misc. Notes:


     1. Large industrial brewers apply the caustic solution at 180-195F. I 
        have personally found that a solution at 120-140F is almost as 
        effective, and a good deal more practical for hand operations. We are 
        now recommending that even small micros and brewpubs use the lower
        temperatures. This has proved to be adequate. See e.g. Dave Miller's
        column in Brewing Techniques.


     2. If you have any doubt about inorganic residuals, apply a standard
        iodophor solution. The former will turn the latter as white as 
        snow.


     3. The most widely used iodophor in commercial practice is the version
        which has iodine and phosphoric acid as the only active ingredients.
        This provides some sequestering action to counteract surfactants, 
        however the sequestering step (step d above) is still used in the wash
        cycle.


      4. Industrial brewers typically use a 5% phosphoric solution for 
         sequestering. I have personally found that a 1% solution is
         adequate for all but extreme cases. While this solution is only
         weakly acidic, gloves are still recommended. The sequesting solution
         can be added at ambient temperature.

        I think I know why you may have your very low gravity. If you  
only boiled a gallon or so, it has a very high density (gravity) and  
hence will sink to the bottom of the carboy. I literally saw this  
happen with some of my first batches. Eventually, the temperature  
differential will cause some mixing, but you will be better off  
mixing it immediately after pouring. Actually, you will be really

Subject: Guinness clone?


I will be brewing a stout this weekend with which I hope to emulate
Guinness.  I looked at Papazian, Miller, and Cat's Meow over the weekend
and developed the following extract/specialty recipie:


7 lbs. M&F light DME
1 lbs. flaked barley
1 lbs. roasted barley
0.75 lbs. crystal malt
1.66 oz Chinook hops (12.6%) at 60 min.


A note on my current limitations.  Brewpot: 16qt size, effective maximum
capacity 12qts.  This is why the hopping is so heavy, to compensate for
the very high SG in the pot.  Scaling is based on Papazians' table with the
goal of coming out equivalent to 15AAU in a full volume boil.  The
questions: some sources call for rolled barley, some for flaked.  My local
supplier had never heard of rolled.  Are they the same thing?  Papazian and
Miller both simply specify "high alpha" hops in their "Toad Spit" and "Dry"
stout recipies.  In scanning the back HBDs I have on hand, I find Goldings
(I assume Kent) recommended by Brian Bliss in #1145, and Geoff Cooper in
#1150 states that Guinness uses Target.  Where all the hops are for
bittering, does the variety really matter?  Several sources call for an
addition of soured ale for a Guinness clone.  I assume a lactobacillus
souring, or is this a momily?  TIA.

With the recent arrival of much better dry yeasts, I'd say that perhaps
dry yeast might be better for beginners because it is easier to use.
The slow, long ferment with Wyeast is probably due to under-oxygenation.
A package of dry yeast contains much more yeast than a package of Wyeast
and since the yeast is oxygenated just before drying, dry yeast can cope
better with under-oxygenated wort.  This is a common occurance for dry
yeast users when they first switch to liquid yeast.  A starter will also
help shorten lag time and reduce fermentation time quite a bit.


Did anyone else notice that two first-place winners in the AHA National
Competition were made with EDME dry yeast?!?!  I also happen to know that
the Best of Show winner at the 1993 Chicago Beer Society Spooky Brew
Review was brewed with Red Star Ale Yeast!

The way it should work is to first let CO2 through the "Gas in" leg,
with the "Gas out" valve opened to purge the O2 from the bottle.


Then, close the "Gas out" vent valve to pressurize the bottle.


Next, close the "Gas in" valve and open the "Beer Line in" valve.


Gently opent the "Gas out" valve to fill the bottle.


Once the bottle is full, close the "Beer Line in" valve and remove
the device.

So what the %&$ is the deal here.  Ice brewed?  Now they gots a 
special yeast which ferments at FREEZING temps or something?
And what's the point of the xtals. Do they filter them OUT so the
beer is "stronger", then water it down again so it's suitable as
Utah 3.2 near-beer?  


I intend to distill,  ugh...uh...ummm.....I mean- "enhance" a brew

        The problem: Well, if I thought about it i would have figured out
that since the keg and the bottle are under the same pressure, there is no
reason at all for the beer to move from the keg into the bottle.  In fact,
this is exactly what happens: nothing. Or at least very little.

2) open bleed valve to purge bottle of air.  
3) close bleed valve and repressurize bottle.
4) close valve to CO2 
    *   Be sure to do this!
5) open liquid valve -- beer will not flow at
   this point since the presures are equal
5) slowly open bleed valve.  This will reduce the presure in the bottle
   and allow the beer to fill it up.  
6) When bottle is full:

But not sterile filtering.  If he's gonna bottle he has to be sure
to leave yeast for carbonation, or repitch. Either way there will
be sediment in the bottles.

*   Uh,,, no.       Sorry but it doesn't work that way.
The kilning process darkens the malt to different degrees. Along with
this are changes in the quality of starches, sugars, and colors of the
malt.  Each crystal is considered separately in estimating color.


Lighter crystals will give a sweeter note to beers.
Darker crystals will give less sweetness, more body, and a "toasty"
quality.  Using some from either end gives you the best of both worlds
and using twice from in between gives you some of each...sort of.


Mixing and matching crystals is a favorite pastime in the Coyote grain 
room.  A general rule of thumb is are you staying light, or 
leaning into ambers, or yet darker.  Stick below 60 (or 80) if you're
working in pale territory, and go higher if you want RED amber beer, or 
are into the roastier nut browns.

Subject: Sierra Nevada and the Hop Back/Yeast


A long while ago I promised some info on Sierra Nevada's use
of the hop back.  I was suppossed to take a tour with my homebrew
club a few weeks ago, but illness prevented me from attending.  I
did finally talk to one of the guys who went, and here's the deal:


Sierra Nevada no longer uses the hop back in production of any of
their beers.  Instead, they have switched to dry hopping.  The
rate of hops was disclosed, but the person I spoke with couldn't
remember, so I'm going to have to ask someone else.  They use
whole hops (everywhere) and put the hops in a hop bag for dry
hopping.  BTW, the reason given for discontinuing the use of
the hop back was that it was too much of a hassle to clean and
sterilize.


Other interesting tidbits:  The question was asked if Wyeast 1056
(aka American and/or Chico) was the same strain as they used.  The
answer was to that they had no idea, but wondered why it would 
matter since "you can get our yeast from a bottle of our beer."  
Their yeast came from Siebel, and is banked there, so maybe someone
with a connection at Siebel could tell us more.  Also, they claim
never to wash their yeast, and they repitch it about 20 generations
before starting with a fresh culture. 


I'll report again when I've had a chance to debrief more of the
club members.

My recent experience with Wyeast 1056 is that 60 is indeed barely warm
enough to ferment.  The beer fermented out pretty well but it was mild.
Does anyone have any recommendations for yeasts that work well at that temp?
Should I think about using lager yeasts?  Maybe a lager/ale combination?


Someone asked a couple weeks ago about mixing yeasts in a batch, a question
I've wanted to ask the HBD community for several years since in making one 
of my first beers, a pack of dry lager yeast was purchased by mistake and 
used along with a dry ale yeast.  This was one of my better beers of that 
era.  I don't recall seeing any responses to the question of blending yeasts.
Its often said that yeast is one of the major factors in the flavor of
beer - seems like this must have been tried at least a few times?

Homebrewers,
  In response to the liquid/dry yeast question, I vote for liquid yeast
only.  The only batch in which I ever used dry yeast (EDME) came out
tasting very metallic.  I tried a bottle that had aged for six months
and it was better, but still only barely drinkable, and this from a guy
who sometimes enjoys mega brews.  The last time I was at the homebrew
store, the proprietor was testing the Doric, Windsor, and Nottingham
(sp?) dried yeasts in side by side comparisons.  He judged the Winsor
and Doric better than the Nottingham, but said he would not use dry
yeast in anything he brews personnaly.
  On the subject of historical beer, I saw "High Plains Drifter" the
other night and wondered to my self, "Self, what kind of beer is
that saloon serving?"  It came from the tap under pressure, the glass
was half full of head, and it was light golden.  I guess it came from
a wooden keg and was pretty harsh.  Anyone know?

I just got a new fermentation/lagering fridge but since it's the only one

I also got a small serving fridge and I plan on putting a tap through the

I'm an extract brewer with seven batches under my belt

Now I'm contemplating brewing my first stout (an oatmeal

A month or so ago, Chris Lyons asked about the new Whitbread.


The new Whitbread dry yeast has never been distibuted due to the 
inability of the processor to produce a clean product.  Repeated attempts 
have failed.  Crosby and Baker states that the new Whitbread will not be 
available for at least another 6 months and they are not terribly 
optimistic about that given the recent history of contaminated Whitbread.


George Fix has claimed, on the digest and in Zymurgy, that the new 
Whitbread is available and that it is clean.  Moreover George claimed to 
have received very good scores at homebrew competitions for beers 
made with the new Whitbread.  George claimed that new production 
procedures are the reason for the new and improved Whitbread.  It's 
now glaringly obvious that all of these reports were in error.  I advised 
digest readers months ago to view the reports as wishful dreaming 
lacking any sound scientific basis because of the patently obvious flaws 
in George's methods.


For those who still put credence in George's earlier reports, just ask him 
where to buy a pack of the new Whitbread.


For those who are still purchasing Whitbread, please note that Crosby and 
Baker, the U.S. distributor, states it was produced well over a year ago.

I am relatively new to homebrewing, having made just two extract batches.
However I am starting to scrounge up the hardware for mashing.  My wife has
a canning setup she has had almost forever.  It has a 2-gallong pot and a 6
gallon pot, both made of aluminum.
 
Should I use them for boiling my brew?  I know back in the '80s there was
talk of a link between aluminum and Altzheimer's Disease.  I thought that
had been downplayed or disproven, yet I never see aluminum listed in the
brewing books as an alternative.  If safety is not the issue, why can't I
use these?  I would point out that a LOT of jams and jellies have been made
in them, without apparent ill effects.  <At least I don't REMEMBER any loss
of memory! ;^) > They haven't dissolved or corroded.  Why would wort be any
different?
 
Any feedback will be appreciated.  I really don't relish shelling out bucks
for a new pot when these are already here.
