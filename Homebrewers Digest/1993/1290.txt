In HBD#1289,  Mark Stewart gave plans for an immersion chiller.  Thank you 
Mark, but I have one question.  What is the diameter of a Revereware 8 qt.
stockpot?

Subject: Yeast FAQ, other docs, and a sake note


Hi,
I am the author of the Yeast FAQ (actually chief editor is a better 
description). It does indeed exist. I have noticed that many people post to 
the digest asking for infomation on the retrieval of various FAQs or 
documents. I say to them: *READ THE HEADER OF THE DIGEST!* Every day it is the
same, and every day it says:
 ->for archives, ftp to sierra.stanford.edu
 ->for archives without ftp access, email listserv`at`sierra.stanford.edu
  with the body of your message reading HELP.
I am not a major techno, nor do I wish to start a flame, but I would 
implore all to skim the instructions at least once.
  
  That being said, I am going to update the yeast faq in a couple of weeks 
and would encourage any and all to send any new strain descriptions or 
techniques to me at weix`at`netcom.com. 


 Sake: Isn't that just warm Bud without the hops? Serve me up a glass now!

Subject: BBC and water chemistry




I just received in the mail an unsolicited four-color bi-fold *I'm not 
sure what this is* "advertisement" from The Boston Brewing Company. It 
begins on the cover with a history of the Koch Brewing Family.
   "James Koch - Brewer By Descent"
and on the next page
   "Sam Adams - Brewer of Dissent"
a history of Samuel Adams and his revolutionary exploits.
Page three goes on to explain why James named his beer after Sam and why 
Patriot James started the company - "I wanted Samuel Adams Boston Lager 
to lead another kind of revolution - independence from imported beer."
Page four continues the Koch famly travails from Germany to the land of 
opportunity, offers "Come for a tour" AND **offers a FREE Sam Adams T-
shirt and a FREE subscription to the Boston Beer Company Quarterly 
Newsletter** !!! The last line on the FREE offer asks me to check *one* 
of the following, "I am a: Beer Lover, Retailer, Distributor, Brewer."
I'm not quite sure what to make of this. Could all of Al's talk on 
HBD of the "B" word have had an effect? 


************************************
On another subject...
My water, according to the city water report, has 300 ppm of carbonates. 
When I boil it to precipitate carbonates out, how many (ppm) could I 
expect to remain in solution? Also, why does my Ph go UP after I boil 
it? Shouldn't precipitating out the carbonates *reduce* hardness and 
consequently Ph?

Subject: dilution




In HBD 1289, Cushing Hamlen asks:
> Has anyone ever done a study of wort SG as a function of dilution?
> Papazian gives some guidelines for dilution, but I am looking for
> a curve, or better yet an analytical function fit to experimental data.


I posted this to the digest a long time ago (that means I don't
remember when).  I think the analysis behind this was fairly
straightforward (and I don't remember that either).  I think it is
correct for dilution prior to fermentation, I don't know about after
fermentation since the alcohol may throw my simplistic approach off.  I
originally did this when I made an imperial stout that boiled off too
much water while getting the hop boil time.  I wanted to get back to
the planned gravity and Papazian's tables didn't cover the range I
needed.


Example usage: assume 5 gallons of 1.100 wort diluted with 1 gallon of
water to get 6 gallons of 1.083 wort.  We added 20% of the original
volume as additional water, intersection of 1.100 row and 20% column.




      |             Dilution By
 O.G. |     5%    10%    15%    20%    25%    30%    35%    40%    45%    50%

Subject: Dry versus Liquid Yeast


In recent HBD's there has been a number of comments concerning dry vs.
liquid yeast.  I thought I would share what I tasted on a recent trip to a
couple of Brewpubs in Rochester, NY.  I had the ocassion to eat dinner at a
brewpub called Rorhbachs.  Their beer was verrrrrry good.  They had a
terrific highly hopped lager called Gregory Street Lager.  The beer was one
of the best I have tried to date.  After discussing it with the bartender he
asked me if I would like a tour.  Obviously I was overjoyed at the
opportunity!  The brewmaster was on site and proceeded to show me the
facility.  I found that they used Belgium Malt (all grain process) and
Wyeast to brew the beer.
 
The next day I had the chance to stop at the Rochester Brewpub and try a
couple of their brews.  I was definitely not as thrilled with their beer
(however, overall it wasn't bad).  As I was looking at the facility I once
again had the opportunity to discuss brewing with the brewmaster.  To my
surprise I found the process to be Malt Extract and Whitbread dry yeast. The
difference between what I had tasted the day before was remarkable, the
liquid yeast was clean while the Whitbread had definitive tastes left in the
beer.
 
Now the kicker,  I had brewed the day before Thanksgiving an all grain Pale
that I had planned on using a liquid lager yeast (I was attempting a steam).
 However after 2 1/2 days of no activity (I had used a slant of yeast about
3 months old) I decided to attempt to rescue the beer with the only viable
option, a packet of Whitbread dry which had been in the fridge since the
summer.  The brew took off in 3 hours and fermentation was very active.
Last night I racked to the secondary and as usual tried a small glass of
beer.  The beer tasted exactly like the beer in the Rochester Brewpub!!
Although the beer is still drinkable, I definetely have converted myself to
liquid yeast from here on out.

Subject: Clarity and slow fermentation in first all-grain batch


My first batch of all grain beer was racked two days ago. The recipe 
followed was almost exactly Papazian's Amaizeing Pale Ale from The New 
Complete Joy of Homebrewing. Two things worry me about this batch. I've 
been brewing for nearly two years using malt extracts and have never before 
encountered these quirks:


1. The fermentation with Edme's dried yeast, (no starter--too busy that 
week) was strong for the first 48 hours and then continued at a slow rate 
for another six days. I've never left beer in a primary longer than one 
week and yet may have jumped the gun racking this after 8 days. At racking, 
my airlock was bubbling about once a minute and the SG was 1.012 for two 
consecutive days (down from 1.046), The temperature was a steady 73 degrees 
F. Does all-grain brewing produce a slower but longer-fermenting wort?


2. Although I was very careful not to disturb the sediment during 
siphoning, this beer is very cloudy. Of course I've assumed some of this 
cloudiness is yeast from possibly premature racking. I suspect, though, 
that there's a fair amount of particle matter from the grains washed off 
during sparging. I sparged through a depth of about 7-8 inches of grain. Is 
this cloudiness normal in all-grain brewing?


I'll sample a bottle in one week (if they haven't all exploded from 
premature racking). A taste at bottling was promising, featuring a 
wonderful hoppy nose yet encounterd brewing with extracts.

yea, i tried some budweiser ice draft (i was at a friends house and he was
swilling it.  i didn't buy it, HONEST!).  i think this is similar to the
molson ice.  i have to agree with andy.  STAY AWAY FROM THE STUFF.  no tase
at all.  i hear they use more corn to give it a smoother flavor.  
this reminds me of something:  five years ago i was involved in an exchange
program with german students.  when they were over here king cobra was
still being advertised on t.v.  the adds said, "goes down smooth with no
after taste."
i remember the german students rolling on the ground with laughter after
hearing this.  i asked one what was so funny (at this time i had never
really tried any beer) and he said, "beer with no aftertaste?  the after
taste is the most important part of the beer!"
three months later i was in germany.  i tasted real beer for the first time
and found out that he was right.

Subject: extract pouch extract extraction


Larry Richardson <richards`at`priacc.com> asked about
easy/efficient ways to get all the extract out of those pouches.
 
Just put them in the microwave.  I do mine a minute, then squeeze
around awhile, then another minute, &c, until they are quite
warm and very soft and squishy (very fun).  You could also put
them in a sink of hot water or even boil them; I think they
are made of the same stuff that Green Giant Niblets in Butter
Sauce pouches are made of.  At least the pouches I've been
getting are claimed to be boil-proof. Ask your supplier.
 
When they are all soft cut a corner off and hold by the opposite
corner.  Then you can stir at the same time to avoid scorching.
Some more squeezing will get most of the stuff out and a cup
or so of hot water put in and then shaken around will get the
rest.
 
Not much more irritating than cans, really

Subject: Wort boiler screen




I just had a disaster with the screen on my wort boiler plugging with
hops.  I just started all grain 5 gal boils and this is my third
batch.  The previous batches did not plug with hops.  I have a Sankey
keg with the top cut out for a boiler.  I have welded a nipple in the
side, about 2" from the bottom and right over the center is an elbow
and short nipple which dip down to within 1/2" of thte bottom.  The
end of the nipple is covered with a coarse screen.  I have no idea why
it did not plug up the first two times, but did this time.


Here are my questions.  If you are using a Chore Girl or an
EasyMasher, since both of them are just screens, why do they not plug
up?  If you have any other methods, please share them.

Subject: Correction of Sierra Nevada Dry Hopping


I was wrong in my post the other day when I said that Sierra Nevada was
now dry-hopping their pale ale instead of using the hop back.  They are no
longer using the hop back, but they do not dry hop the pale ale.  Martin
Wilde advised me of this via email, and I double-checked with others who
were on the tour.  The only beers that they dry hop are the Bigfoot Barley
Wine and the Celebration Ale.  The pale ale is bitter-hopped with a
combination of Perle and Nugget hops at the beginning of the boil, with
additions of Cascade at 30 minutes to go and at the end of the boil, which
they allow to steep for 20 minutes before chilling the wort.


Sorry for the misinformation.
