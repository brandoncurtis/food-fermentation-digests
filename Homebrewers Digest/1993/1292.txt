     For anyone who wants to taste a _real_ ice beer, try EKU Kulminator
Urtyp Hell 28 from Germany (That's the entire name of the beer, honest!).
It is concentrated by freezing as are the North American "ice" beers.
But, the flavor (and alcohol) are so concentrated, I found this brew
to be undrinkable, unless diluted with some lighter-bodied beer. (I
never thought I'd say a beer was undrinkable, but try it yourself and
let me know how you feel about it.)  
     You should be able to find this Kulminator without too much trouble;
our local supermarket carries it in the imported beer section.  I guess
it's actually a doppelbock in style, except for the freezing treatment.
Oh, and it is reputed to have the highest alcohol content of any commercial
beer.  (Maybe, maybe not).  I know it is around 12%, and it packs a wallop!

Subject: Snakebite




Smolinsky spoke of his little Welsh B&B giving him a taste of 
Snakebite and telling him of its illegal status.  I have to say 
that this may be the case in England and Wales but us Scots are
smarter than them so we have our own legal system which does not
ban this tipple.  Either that or my local hasn't heard anything
to the contrary!  In fact it is quite common around here to order
a "snakebite black" which is the half lager, half cider mix but 
with a dash of blackcurrant.  I have to admit though that neither
of these concoctions really appeal to me.


On a different note I wonder if anyone could help me with the 
problem I have with my present batch of 'instant' homebrew.
It's one of these buy your tin of wort with everything included 
except water and sugar.  The problem is that primary fermentation
went like a dream, but now that i've transfered it to my pressure
barrel for secondary fermentation nothing's happening, ie no pressure 
build up what so ever.  I've tried adding extra yeast but to no
avail. Please help ASAP as this is supposed to be the main attraction 
of a Christmas Eve party. HELP!!!!!!!!!

Subject: Brigand Ale/beer aging


Popped the cork on a bottle of this stuff last night.  Wow!  Vinous,
fruity, old-ale aroma, beautiful orange-gold color, creamy head,
strong!, hoppy in back.  Yum!


This is a "Special," a style designation that means almost nothing, as
far as I can tell.  With an OG of 1080, it's more-or-less in the
"strong, blond" category, I'd think.


Jackson says it's best 3-6 months from bottling.  Well, the cork on
this one said it was bottled 2-90.  Still good. There was
some crud on the bottom of the cork, which I carefully cleaned out of
the neck before drinking.  Also yeast "fluffies" in the bottom.


I don't know what this says about aging "on the yeast" versus 
filtering, but it certainly indicates that a beer can last more than a
few months (which many of us already knew).  Although it smelt
somewhat aged, it didn't taste "old" in any negative sense.  I wonder
what a new bottle would taste like?

Subject: Alpha Acid extraction


        I have been playing with Rager's and Garetz' tables, the equation 
from the hops faq and the like, and it occurs to me there is something 
missing.  I seem to recall (from the spring issue of American Brewer, I 
believe) that increasing the hop rate decreases utilization.  Thus, not 
only is the utilization rate not linear with time and boil gravity, it is 
also not linear with hopping rate.  Does anyone out there have a polynomial 
for this?

Sorry for the strangeness in the Commercial Beer Matrix, Part 1.  It seems
something between me and the HBD added a "- " to all of the long lines starting
with "----"s.  I don't get it, nor do I know how to prevent it from happening
to Part 2/2.  To clean it up, you'll have to remove the "- " in all those
lines.  Hope this is useful.

You've *got* to be kidding me. This sounds like an 
"Old Wives' Tale" made into law.


"Snakebites" are pretty common over here in brewpubs (at
least in the Boston area), and are made from a strong lager
and a cider, as the poster states. Usually the lager is the 
lager-of-the-house, and the cider is whatever is available.
(At least one brewpub in Boston makes its own cider: Boston
 Beer Works.)


If there is a chemical reaction that has a bad effect
on people's brain cells, I haven't KnOwitist iT, aNd

Subject: CO2 buildup during lagering phase


Hi.  When I made my first and only lager this fall, I had a problem at
bottling time -- the beer foamed a lot when I filled the warm bottles
and later the beer had a way too high level of carbonation.  Here's
what I figure was going on:


At the lager fermentation temps, the CO2 produced by the yeast tended
to stay in solution rather than come out of solution like it does with
my ales at ale fermentation temperatures.  Since I bottled the beer
right out of the fridge after a 2 week primary and 2 week
secondary/lager phase, a lot of CO2 was still dissolved in the beer.


This time I think I'll bring the beer out of the fridge a day or two
before bottling to let most of the CO2 come out of solution.  Seems
like I read in Noonan's book that he says the CO2 can be brought out
of solution by siphoning the cold beer straight from the fridge into a
bottling bucket and then rocking the bucket to coax the CO2 out of the
beer.  What do you folks do?


Thanks in advance,


Patrick

I believe you Welsh friend was spinning you a bit of a yarn with that brain
cell story....  (I have always been faxcinated by Wales, BTW...)


However, snakebites are definitely EVIL!!  I have strayed to the DARK SIDE more
times than I care to (or can...) remember.  Many Pubs here in the bay area
have Dry Blackthorn Hard Cider on tap, and are very familiar with snakebites.


I was introduced to them at Jonathan's Roadhouse Pub in Tahoe City while on a
ski trip, and, ever since, I have been hooked.  If a place has the cider on tap,
I know automatically what I'm going to order.  


They're a little sweet with some of the milder lagers, so I suggest trying it 
with Pilsener Urquell or one of the more robust ales.  They're also pretty good
with Guiness, believe it or not!  I usually get them with the likes of 
Red Hook or Bass.


With regard to the brain cell thing, I simply cannot believe that it was
outlawed for killing brain cells.  We all know what does that, and it has
nothing to do with a reaction between cider and beer...


These wonderful concoctions do, however have a tendency to sneak up on you 
and bite your behind!  They are tasty, go down smooth, and have quite a kick.
I don't know what the alcohol content of the cider is, but I have ended up
more inebriated than I have intended on several occasions.


I suggest you search out a pub that has a dry cider on tap, and have them pull
a few snakebites for you.  But make sure you have a ride home if you're there
past closing like you were in Wales.


Enjoy!

Subject: dopplebock vs. barleywine


Someone asked if dopplebocks are barleywines.  The answer is, no there are
differences between the two.  The most basic difference being that a dopplebock
is a lager and a barleywine is an ale.  Lagers are brewed and aged at lower
temperatures than ales.  Dopplebocks are a high alcohol version of lager
while barleywines are high alcohol versions of ale.  Barleywines are
generally higher in alcohol content than dopplebocks (a tripplebock might be
in barleywine range).

I suspect what is happenning is that the iso-alpha acids (responsible for
the bitterness) are dropping out with the yeast (Yeast adsorbs iso-alphas).
Now if you say "Well my beer is clear when I perceive it to be bitter, so
the yeast has already dropped out," I would say that reasonably clear
appearing beer can still have lots of yeast suspended in it.


Try this experiment:  Shake up the beer to re-disperse the yeast and then
taste it.  Yes it will be yeasty, but I'll bet the bitterness returns.


Solutions?  Increase your hopping rate and let the beer settle a bit more
before bottling.  And/or use a more flocculent yeast strain.  I haven't
tried it yet myself, but the new Wyeast 1968 Special London Ale is 
reported to be highly flocculent.

Subject: Different Beers - Same Flavor






I am having a problem that perhaps you folks out there in HBD-land could 
help me with.  In short (hopefully), my last two brews came out with the 
same flavor, but I used different ingredients.


First brew -
8# US 2-row
1# US 6-row
1# rye flake
Hops: approx. 45 IBU (don't have varieties on hand)
Yeast: Wyeast - Calif. Lager Yeast


Second brew -
9# British 2-row
1# Crystal 40L
Hops: approx. 45 IBU (don't have varieties on hand)
Yeast: Wyeast - Chico Ale Yeast


In both brews, I used a 1400 mL yeast starter (very active) and 
fermentation started in about 5 hours.  Previously, I had used only only 
500 mL starters, with fermentation in 24 hours.


The problem is that both beers have a pronounced flavor component to them 
- -- sort of a pear/banana-like aroma and taste (IMO, but it is hard for me 
to judge).  At about 40 hours of fermentation, the second brew went from 
having a medium-amber color with large aggregates circulating around to a 
light-amber color with a lot of small particles circulating.  The 
fermentation was very active during this entire period.


Is this characteristic of these yeasts or did something happen to the yeast 
during fermentation?  Any ideas?  If I could tell the difference between 
phenols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, long-chain alcohols, etc. - I guess I 
could troubleshoot the problem better.  But my beer judging needs to 
improved.  (another story)  -- BTW, the beers are very drinkable, I just 
wasn't looking for that flavor.  Thanks.

I got this flyer from Stoelting which makes the following claims for its

Chills 5 gallons of wort from 210F to 56F in 15 minutes at .33 GPM.


So basically, 5 gallons of water (.33 * 15) to chill 5 gallons of wort from
210F to 56F.  It seems to me that if you were able to obtain perfect heat
transfer and the water you were using was 32F, the best you could hope to
get is 121F.


Am I missing something here?  Here is the rest of the info:


Wort chiller w/ stainless steel housing.  Counterflow type.  Chill rate:
5 gal. of wort from 210F to 56F in 15 minutes at .33 GPM. 3/8" ID stainless

It sounds to me like it's not the same beer, and that's what SW Brewing News

also raise the question: is it ethical to call  the new beer by the old name? 
Of course, the same note should point out the facts of the new beer.

To incorporate Spencer's concern for using the more accurate degrees Plato
let's use the following:


        phys_con = pounds/gallon of water
        v = original volume of wort
        og = original specific gravity
        dilution = percent of original volume added as water


Assume that the wort and the dilution water are both at the same
temperature.


        percent_sugar = sg2plato(og)
        mass_sugar = percent_sugar * v * phys_con * og
        original_mass = v * phys_con * og
        new_mass = original_mass + (dilution * v * phys_con)
        new_percent_sugar = mass_sugar / new_mass


Which is:
                      (percent_sugar * v * phys_con * og)
                  _____________________________________________
                  (v * phys_con * og + dilution * v * phys_con)


Which simplifies to:


                = (percent_sugar * og) / (og + dilution)


Which gives:


        fg = plato2sg((percent_sugar * og) / (og + dilution))




After doing all this the resulting table is identical to the more
simplistic approach.  The program follows, the #if SIMPLE determines
which approach to use.

Yes, but isomerization is one of the many factors that collectively
combine to result in a number we call "hop utilization."  I disagree that
it is unpredictable... I feel that for a given system, one can determine
the hop utilization as a function of boil time and other factors.  I say
"for a given system" because among other things, kettle geometry, whether
or not you use a hop bag, and heat source intensity (boil vigor) affect
hop utilization.  I don't know how much each of these factors, or which
ones of them are significant, but for a given system you can figure out
a set of formulas that will give you predictable bittering.

What all the formulas (the ones Robert posted as well as Ragers, etc.)
calculate are an approximation for the IBUs in the finished product, not
really what gets into the wort.  Here's an excerpt from a talk by Bob Foster
(Coors Brewing Co) talk at the Siebel Institute of Technology:


                      PROCESS UTILIZATION OF ALPHA ACIDS


Formula                   %U = IBU(ppm)/AA added(ppm) * 100
                          ----------------------------------


Kettle Utilization: (EG.) %U = 45IBU(ppm)/92.4 AA added(ppm) * 100
                          %U = (0.4870) * 100 = 48.7%


Fermenter Drop      (EG.) %U = 25IBU(ppm)/92.4 AA added(ppm) * 100
RUH Drop:                 %U = (0.2706) * 100 = 27.1%


Lager Drop:         (EG.) %U = 23.5IBU(ppm)/92.4 AA added(ppm) * 100
                          %U = (0.2543) * 100 = 23.4%


Blending (30% H2O): (EG.) 23.5IBU * 0.70 = 16.5 IBU
                          %U = 16.5 IBU(ppm)/92.4 AA added(ppm) * 100
                          %U = (0.1786) * 100 = 17.9%


Overall Utilization       16.5IBU - 1.0 IBU loss = 15.5IBU
(packaged beer):          %U = 15.5 IBU(ppm)/92.4 AA added(ppm) * 100
                          %U = (0.1678) * 100 = 16.8%








Confusing?  Yes, I agree, and I'm not sure if the numbers were actuals
(measured) or if they were just for example's sake, so we can only take
this information with a grain of salt.  However, if we assume that the
numbers are in the ballpark for a real system (granted, Coors' 650bbl
system), then there are a lot more significant factors than just
percent isomerization.

I have wondered about this.  I bought a sixpack of Bigfoot back in `91
from a store that is notorious for poor handling.  The bottlecap said 1990.
I tried one immediately and it was harsh and undrinkable.  Very unpleasant.
It tasted like it was very highly alcoholic but not a smooth, warming ethyl
alcohol.  Knowing that high-alchol beers often require aging (Samiclaus
is aged 1 year before distribution), I put the beer aside in a cool
crawlspace and forgot about it.  Six months later, I tried another bottle --
better, but still harsh.  A year after I bought it, I finally tried the
third bottle: nectar!  The harshness smoothed out wonderfully and it had
a very interesting complexity of estery aromas and flavors over a perfectly
balanced malt/bitterness/alcohol base.  I have two bottles left right now,
and I regret that I did not buy more.


When the 1992 Bigfoot came out, I bought a case, this time from a better
store.  I tried a bottle immediately, expecting the harshness, but it
was not there!  I know that SN has been changing their procedures (and maybe
also their recipes) over the years and perhaps they have reduced the OG
or the fermentation temperature or something.  The beer seemed more alcoholic
than the 1990 version, but it was all the smooth, warming ethanol flavor.
Comments?

I tend to agree.  I recently bought "Dr. Bob Technical's Hop-Go-Round" a
hop version of the Wheel of Beer.  I used it last night to compare my
Rager-derived numbers with the Hop-Go-Round.  For a 60 minute boil in a
1081 wort, they were almost identical, but for a 15 minute boil the H-G-R
said 6 IBU where my Rager-derived numbers said 3 IBU!  I think that the
H-G-R is much too optimistic at the lower end of the utilization curve.
I plan to tape my own scale over the existing utilization scale on the
back of the H-G-R.

I add 10% to Rager's numbers when I use a hop bag (which is always).

Anytime someone reports something hop-related is good for a while and then
turns bad after a while in the bottle, I suspect oxygen is the culprit.
I'm not sure exactly how or why, but I would recommend that you evaluate
your processes and see if you may be introducing oxygen while the wort
is still hot.  Another thing is that perhaps it is not bitterness that you
are perceiving.  Perhaps it is tannin astringency which *does* go away
after a while.  Perhaps you are extracting a lot of tannins from your
grain and you are underhopping -- while the tannin astringency is still there,
the beer tastes rather balanced -- when it fades, the beer tastes too malty.
Could this be the problem?

 Clearly, a mill that is more than twice as large should demonstrate a 
 significantly higher throughput at a given rpm than what you have described.  
 This test is only valid if they are both run at exactly the same speed and no 
 mention of the RPM was made.
 
 It should further be noted that the MM as shipped is set up for hand cranking 
 and the grain guides provide a restricted flow to assure ease of cranking 
 with the very large rollers.  To miximize throughput when motorized, the 
 grain guides can be trimmed to provide a larger hole that will feed the grain 
 as fast as the 10" rollers will take them.
 
 I have a microbrewery customer that reports a throughput of 17 lbs per minute 
 on his MALTMILL.  That's 3.5 secs per lb, roughly 4 times the rate reported 
 for the Glatt.

 You were lucky.  If the screen is only as large as the diameter or the 
 nipple, all it takes is one petal of a hop flower to clog it.

 EasyMasher, since both of them are just screens, why do they not plug

 The EM screen is a 6" x 3/8" cylinder and needs far less luck to remain 
 clear.
