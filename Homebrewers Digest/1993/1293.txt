Subject:      A newcomers introduction. Danish brewing




I have been brewing beer for the last 6-7 years but I am new to HBD 
and I sure like what I see !


I am also one of the few Danish home brewers that brew the
'do it all yourself' beer. The normal procedure in this country is
to buy a package that contains all the material you need. But this brew 
is based on dry yeast and malt-extract which both contribute to the 
reduction of the taste.


I have read HBD #1281 - #1284, and i have got the feeling that most of 
you are from America, and that you do not brew your beer the same 
way that we do in Denmark.


So first I am going to give you a description of the material and the 
procedures of the Danish way of doing these things. I apologise for my 
humble English.


We are two students at The Department of Electronics at The 
Engineering College of Aarhus, in the middle of Denmark, that have 
build our own brewery in his cellar. In this cellar we brew the kind of 
beer that is very related to the beer from Pilsen (Czechoslovakia) and 
Bayern (Germany). The pilsner is ( as you might know ) most commonly 
a relative light beer, but is also brewed in more dark sorts, a little like 
the well-known porter. I guess you all know the Danish Carlsberg 
Pilsner, which is a very light pilsner. (too light for me that is).




The ingredients we use is 4-5 different kinds of malt, hops, Bog myrtle 
( Myrica ), sugar, salt and yeast.


The malt is a substance like syrup with a very fine taste. The sorts that 
we can obtain are :


Light Malt for the light flavoured beer.
Dark Malt for the more dark but not necessarily strong beer.
Gold Malt for the semidark and strong beer. This malt is boiled with     
    hops in it.
Porter Malt for the very dark and porter-like beer
Barley syrup which i very similar to the light malt but with a little 
    different flavour. Unfortunately a rare malt.


These different types of malt is of course used in all kinds of 
compounds. They are all bought in 15 kg cans for about $20-$25.


Bog myrtle gives a bitter taste a little like hops, but still different. 
Rarely used, or in very small amounts.


The yeast is a liquid yeast for bottom fermentation (Saccharomyes  
Carlsbergensis) that we simply pick up at the nearest brewery 
according to an ancient Danish rule which says: 'Anyone are 
entitled to pick up free yeast for his own personal use at any brewery'. 
Use of this yeast makes it necessary to have plenty of cool storage 
room for both the yeasting and maturing of the beer, which both must 
take place in 5-7 Celsiusdeg. (40-45 F.).




Our solution to this are two modified freezers (new thermostat), one 500 
liters and one 300 liters. This gives us a total storing capacity of 
aprox. 200-260 liters in the form of 5 old fashioned 40 liters milk cans, 
and up to 3 20 liters beer kegs (The type that the commercial breweries 
uses).
This capacity gives us, if fully utilized, aprox. 40 liters every 10th
day.


The procedure is this :


The first thing to do, is to make 30-35 liters of boiling water. This is 
done in an old milkcan, enhanced with 2 electrical heaters. Meanwhile 
the malt, hops, sugar and other spices are weighed out. When the 
water boils, the spices are added and carefully stirred. Then, 
depending an the malt used, 1 - 1.5 hours must past with frequently 
stirring. Light malt must boil longer than darker sorts, to develop the 
fine taste it is known for. After the boiling, the wort must be cooled of. 
For this purpose we have purchased an old milk cooler which run on 
cold water only. This device can cool 40 liters of boiling water to aprox. 
5 - 10 Celsiusdeg. in 15 minutes. Then the yeast ( which is reused 
several times ) is added ( 0.5 liter ) and the wort is aired up/ventilated ( 
I don't know the right expression ) by pouring it back and forth a couple 
of times. Finally the milkcan's opening is covered by a sterile bathing 
cap (the hospital kind), and placed in the freezer (fridge) for yeasting. 




Wait, wait, wait for at least 3 weeks.


Then, after the yeasting the beer is gently transported to another 
milkcan for maturing ( to avoid the sediment), and stored at the same 
temperature of course. This milkcan is closed with a pressursave lid, 
and CO2 is added to about 1.5 atm (22 psi). This pressure is 
maintained throughout the next 3 weeks (at least). Mostly this is done 
by adding CO2 once every 2nd or 3rd day during the first 1 or 2 weeks. 
After this maturing the beer is drinkable, but before we drink serious 
quantities we remove the pressure from the can, and transport the beer 
gently to two beer kegs which we pressurize and store for 5 - 10 days 
so that the beer can absorb the right quantity of CO2. After this the beer 
is finally a fine, clear and delicate tasting draught beer. The serving is 
done from a small refrigerator with a CO2 bottle and a suitable placed 
tap. We also posses a transportable box with CO2 and a tap, for feasts 
and its like.


This procedure is only the most commonly for unproblematic beer, and 
will of course be adjusted for beer with lack of behaviour.




What you have just read is only a superficial description of the 
methods and materials we use. I will bee happy to go into details if 
anyone would be interested.




Second, it seems to me that most of the stuff you guys write to HBD 
looks a little like a closed discussion. So it is very difficult for me to 
gain an insight into the methods you use. Therefore I would be very 
interested in some basic information about the way that you guys brew 
your beer, thank you. ( Some kind of dialouge could be very interesting)
If any of you would want to reply, it might take a couple of days before 
I will be able to get back to you, simply because I am looking right into 
to heavy examinations.


Do feel free to mail me directly.


Merry Christmas, Morten Hansen

Subject: Snakebite2




After further investigation ie I spoke to an ex-barmaid! the 
situation regarding the illegality of snakebite in the U.K
does cover the whole of the country and not just England & Wales
as I suggested.


So why can I get it in my local?


Apparently it is O.K to sell it with a dash of blackcurrant
which I would refer to as "snakebite black" but was put
to rights on this matter as it is more commonly known as
Diesel and taken alongside a bottle of Holsten Pils!!!


Just had to clear up my previous errors.

Well I live in England, work behind a bar & as far as the licensing
law stands, Snakebite is not illegal, it may be frowned upon, and a
friend of mine did say he wasn't able to get it in Merseyside due to
a local byelaw....... (Truth or otherwise of this claim unverified)


And anyway if Snakebite was illegal, would it not also be illegal to
sell someone a half pint of lager & a half pint of cider or any
possible way for them to make a Snakebite, because by selling them I
would be an accessory to the "crime"


Not that any of this bothers me at all as I don't count lager as a
drink & when I drink cider I drink cider - not polluted with any of
this other BS, when I drink beer, I drink gallons (hic)

The recipies are both for rather mild beers that would
show the effects of processing   errors or contamination.
 Potential efffects and causes:
        Contaimiination:  The taste could be the hallmark of a 
wiild yeast that has taken up residence at your address.  
If this is the case, either be very carefull with stearilization

Subject: HopTech Fruit Extracts


I just got the catalog today from a company
called HopTech.  Mostly they just sell hops,
but they did have some concentrated fruit
extracts.  They are sold in four ounce bottles
and contain enough "stuff" to make about 15
gallons of fruit beer.  They don't have any
sugars in them, so you add them to the beer
right before bottling.  Anyone ever heard of
this stuff or tried it yet.  It is a lot
cheaper than the real fruit itself, so it would
be a good cost savings, but the question is,
will it be good to taste?

Hi All,
        I'm an all-grainer who likes a BIG tasting pale ale, not necessarily in
OG or alcohol level, but very malty and very hoppy. Of course the hoppy part is
easy, and  some yeasts have helped with the malty part. I use M&F pale 2-row
and mash at around 155degF. My idea is to add 1/4 or 1/2 lb pale at mash out,
to add flavor. What would be the pros and cons of this? Or is there something
else I haven't considered?
Thanks much,

Subject: Dream Tun


I am a happy all-grain brewer, planning my 21st batch (of which about half have
been all-grain) for the upcoming holidays.  My grain-mill is a home-made roller
mill which should suit my needs forever.  My boiler is a very nice, propane
fired (converted NG water heater element), 10 gallon cream can from an old
dairy.  I have a hop-back, and nice CF chiller to boot.  I ferment happily in
carboys (7g & 5g).


The component I've left out is obviously the mash/lauter tun.  It is a
Rubbermaid 48 quart cooler with copper pipe manifold.  It does what is intended
for it to do, which is to serve well as an insulated single temperature
infustion mash and lautering vessel.  What it does not do, of course, is step
mashes, which would be nice, nor does it offer any easy way to add heat if I
miss my strike temperature for any reason.  Also, it will eventually warp
enough from the heat that I'll need to replace it (it is showing signs of this,
after many batches).


Kettle mash, you say?  I don't want to lose so much heat during mashing that I
have to attend the thing constantly; the best thing about mashing is that I
can go do other things (such as go to work for a half day, as was mentioned
here a few weeks ago).  Also, I have had a lot of trouble with temperature
overshoot when kettle mashing.  I prefer an insulated tun for the non-
attendence feature during a normal infusion mash.  If I am going to do a step
mash or something different, then I certainly wouldn't mind working it.


So, my question is this: if you were able to design the ideal mash/lauter tun
system, for homebrewing applications, how would you do it?  I'd like to do up
to 10 gallon batches, but more capacity than that is not necessary.  Assume
that cost is a factor (always minimize it), but that I have an unlimited
resource in terms of welding, pipe bending, etc. (almost true).  I have propane
in my brewery/garage, 110V (but no 220V), and soon will have hot and cold
running water.  I'm looking for something I can use for a lifetime, that is
versatile, and most of all: neat!


Should I convert a SS half-barrel keg by insulating it and adding a propane
burner?  Steam jacket?  Hot water jacket?  RIMS?  uP controlled (I think this
is overkill, personally)?  How about an insulated vessel with a steam bubbler?
Or a removable radiator (reverse chiller)?


One more thing, how about a sparge water vessel?  I currently use my boiler,
but I have to transfer the water to a bucket, so that I can free up the boiler
for the first runnings.  This is one reason I batch sparge most of the time.
The idea of mixing the grain and strike water as they fall into the tun
(obviating the need for "dough-in") also intrigues me.


I ask this to generate some discussion and maybe something good will come out
of it for many HBD tinkerers.  I'd like to hear what works well for you, but
also what you only dream of making (maybe I'll make it!).  As always, we thank
you for your support.

EKU 28 is not, in fact, concentrated by freeze distillation.  (See
Michael Jackson's "New World Guide to Beer", p. 54.)  It is 
brewed from a wort that does achieve at least 28 degrees Plato
(about sg 1.112).


The only true eisbock I'm aware of in Germany is made by the Kulmbacher
Reichelbraeu brewery, a smaller neighbor of EKU's.  Their Bayrische
G'frorns (frozen Bavarian) beer has a calculated OG of 24 degrees
Plato, and the beer is far more drinkable (if that is the right
word) than EKU 28.


The story is that a tank of beer was accidently left out in the
freezing weather and that when opened, this nectar flowed out.  


The Niagara Brewery in Canada produces an eisbock with some regularity.
It's an interesting beer, although it makes no attempt to scale the
gravity or alcoholic heights, coming with a mere 8% alcohol by volume.
It tends to have an estery background, which is probably emphasized
by the concentrating process.  Even so, it has a lager character to
it and I don't think many judges would liken it to a barleywine.

No;  EKU 28 has the highest OG of any regularly available beer.  But
Hurlimann's Samichlaus, brewed from a slightly lower OG, is a bit more
fermentable and so has a higher alcoholic result (and a more drinkable
product, IMHO).  This, in spite of the boastful claims on the EKU 28
label ("Das starkste Bier der Welt").

Subject:      Pitching Rates


Hi all,
I have a question I'd like to ask concerning pitch rates for lagers.  I've
recently been given the opportunity to help out my local brewpub.  Seems they
have been using dried yeasts for quite some time now, and the new brewmaster
would like to switch over to liquid yeasts.  He has asked me to help him in
this endeavour.  I have a fair bit of experience at culturing yeast for my own
5 gallon batches, but now we're talking about pitching to 180 gallons.


Using the formula for lager pitching in the yeast faq, I have determined that
I need to pitch .72 gallons of slurry.  This figure seems extremely low to me.
So I put it to you, what kind of a fermentation can I expect from such a
pitching rate?  I imagine it will be an extremely slow one.  Any formulas

A friend of mine asked me if I could brew a beer that emulates a beer he had in 
the Bahamas this past summer.  It is called Kalik (spelling questionable) and i`
supposedly the number one beer in that country.  Does anyone know of a recipe 
that I could use to try to copy this beer?  Appreciate your suggestions.

Jack, you have most likely already answered the question.  The hopper hole
opening into the MaltMill is only a fraction of the length of the rollers.  In 
addition, there is a large mesh plastic screen that covers the opening (for 
safety reasons).  I suspect that both of these factors work to limit the speed 
at which the malt kernels can reach the rollers, so I am not surprised that the 
MaltMill and GlattMill crush at about the same rate.  It is interesting to 
note that the hopper holes of the two mills are about the same size.


BTW, I am sure that you are right that a larger hopper hole would increase the 
throughput on a MaltMill, but we tested it as manufactured.  I can 
handcrank/crush 8+ lbs of malt in ~2 min. with my unmodified MaltMill.  The 
Glatt Mill is a touch slower, but similar.  Does it really make any difference 
in the length of my brewday if I spend 2 vs 3 minutes crushing grain??  Not to 
me;  either one is a vast improvement over my old Corona!

     I have been reminded by several HBD readers that EKU is _not_ an 
ice beer in the same sense as the ones from Bud, Molson, etc.  The
EKU is frozen to precipitate out protein, but the ice is not removed.
Thus, it is not a true eisbock.  It still tastes pretty darn strong, though.
Sorry for the errant information!  
     I guess I need to do more, ahem, research into this ice beer dilemma.
I'll start with a Buffalo Blizzard Bock (Buffalo Brewing Company, Buffalo,
N.Y.)  I'm gonna have one straight, then I'm gonna freeze one and filter
out the ice first.  It may not be a real "eisbock" either, but it'll
be fun to try!

In HBD #1292 Ed Kopek talked about EKU Kulminator Urtyp Hell 28.


Well consulting with my family in Germany, I got the scoop on whether
EKU 28 is really the strongest commercial beer around.  The story in
Bavaria is that the 28 in EKU 28 is the PROOF of the beer.  You got
it.  28 proof aka 14% alcohol.  I have a bottle saved from when I last
tried the stuff.  If you read the label carefully, you'll notice that
nowhere on the bottle is it referred to as beer.  It is referred to as
malt liquor.


Correct me if I'm wrong(and I know you will), but isn't there a
federal law that says beer can only be a maximum of 6% alcohol?
Anything stronger than that has to be called a Malt Liquor.


Oh well, that my $0.02...

>Am I missing something here?  Here is the rest of the info:


A few weeks ago someone reported that using an immersion chiller
that he was able to reduce 5 gallons of boiling wort to 90F
using only 8 gallons of Texas tap water.  At first, I made an
estimate like yours (assuming Texas tap water is 60F) and
concluded that 118F was the best possible.  Then I tried a
simple model of an immersion chiller.  


Let   Ti    = the constant inlet tap water temperature
      Tk(t) = the time varying temperature of the wort in the
              kettle. (Here I'm assuming that the wort is being
              constantly stirred so that its temperature is 
              uniform.
      To(t) = the time varying temperature at the outlet of
              the chiller.
      dw    = a small amount of water passing through the coil.
      N     = the amount of wort in the kettle
      dt    = a small time increment
      R     = dw/dt = the rate of flow through the chiller
              (coil).
Furthermore, if the coil is sufficiently long or R is
sufficiently small then we can assume that


     Tk(t) = To(t) = T(t),


that is, the temperature at the outlet is the same as the
temperature in the kettle.


Then


     dw * Ti + N * T(t) = (N+dw) * T(t+dt)        (1)


which simply expresses the fact that dw gallons at Ti added
to N gallons at T(t) will equilibriate to N+dw gallons at
temperature T(t+dt).  Dividing (1) by dt and rearranging terms
yields


   dT   R
   -- = - * (Ti - T)
   dt   N


which in the limit at dt -> 0 becomes a differential equation.
The solution (assuming the initial temp T(0) = 212F) is


   T(t) = Ti + (212-Ti)*exp(-R*t/N) .


The amount of time t required to reduce the temperature from 
212 to T is


       N    (212-Ti)
  t =  - log|------|
       R    ( T-Ti )


and the amount of water required is A=Rt.
So if we had such an optimal immersion chiller and constantly
stirred, and the tap water was Ti=40F and we wanted to chill N=5
gallons to T=56F we would need


A = 5 log ((212-40)/(56-40)) = 11.87 gallons.


I have not done a similar analysis for counterflow chillers, but
it seems that either Stoetling was exagerating or counterflow
chillers are more efficient (as far as water conservation is
concerned) than immersion chillers.  Note that if you simply
mixed 11.87 gallons of 40F water with 5 gallons of 212F you
would get 16.87 gallons at 90.98F, so immersion chilling is
somewhat efficient.

Subject: Blow-off vrs non-blow-off


Every now and then people have been debating the use or not of
using a blow-off, so I thought I would add a data point to this
controversy.  I brewed 6 1/2 gallons of IG 1.041 English Special
Bitter style which was siphoned into a 7 gallon carboy  and
pitched about 3/4 quarts of yeast starter.  After about 3-4
hours I reracked the wort, filling one 5 gallon carboy to about
3 inches from the brim, and the other with the remainder.  Both
batches began fermenting after about 10 hours and the filled
carboy began blowing-off after about 12 hours.  Originally, I
had planned to bottle both batches after 7-10 days in primary,
but after 10 days the bloww-off batch was still bubbling every
13 seconds, while the non-blow-off batch seemed finished.  So,
after 11 days I reracked both batches and was shocked to find
the gravity of the blow-off batch to be 1.020, while the
non-blow-off batch was down to 1.011.  The non-blow-off batch
was bottled the next day, while I let the blow-off batch sit in
secondary for another 10 days, at which time it was bottled with
an FG=1.013.  After waiting about 3 weeks I was ready to compare
the batches.  (I conjecture that the blow-off batch was filled
too high and a lot of the healthy yeast got blown out, thereby
slowing the fermentation.)


I found both batches to be similar - IMHO a good example of the
English bitter style, fruity, malty, full to medium bodied with
a nice Kent Golding hop aroma and flavor.  However, although I
am a BJCP judge, I lost my confidence in distinguishing
taste subtleties after failing a self inflicted taste test
during a tour of the Anheiser-Busch brewery in Williamsburg VA
about a month ago.  I could not distinguish between bud,
bud-dry, bud-lite and Michelob.  Well, maybe bud and Michelob has
slightly more lingering aftertastes.  (Remember the Simpson's
episode where Duff, Duff-dry, and Duff-lite were being filled by
the same pipe.)  So, I brought samples to
the BURP homebrew club meeting for a more unbiased comparison.
I did tell them that one was blow-off and one was not, but I
didn't identify which was which.
Some of the members correctly identified the blow-off batch
saying they thought it was slightly smoother, (one correctly
identified the blow-off batch but said she liked the
non-blow-off batch better).  Some incorrectly identified the two
batches and some "punted" and said no difference.  All agreed
that if there was a difference it was minor. Therefore,
despite the wide variations in fermentation times, both batches
came out nearly identical with the blow-off having little or no effect.
Of course, this is just one data point and your mileage may
vary.

Sounds to me like you moved it to the secondary a bit too late if you were 
looking for it to carbonate itself in the secondary.  The beer may have
completely fermented out in primary.  Trying boiling up a little bit of
corn sugar (I'm not sure of the proper amount since I don't keg, but I think
it is on the order of 1/3 to 1/2 cup) in some water and adding it to the

Their line of products looks VERY nice.  The stats on the wort chiller I
mentioned yesterday should give some idea on some of the stuff they sell.
The only problem is that their stuff is awfully pricey, but if you want
to go first class, this is the way to go.  The aforementioned wort chiller
runs for $314.  They also have kettles from 7-20 gallons with a bottom
drain valve.  Their stuff really looks like the "equipment the pros use"
only shrunk down to homebrew sizes (if only they left their shrinking system
running for a little longer on their prices).


Sorry for wasting space with a stupid question (if you believe their are

Hello all,


I am having trouble getting my first 'custom' lager to carbonate in

bottles and re-capping... but would like a little more help before
I take a chance with 2+ cases of (so far) good beer.


Recipe          Yeast Labs L35 California Lager Yeast
for 5           3.5 lbs GlenBrew Hopped Pilsener Malt Extract
Gallons:        2.5 lbs light dried malt extract
                1 lb American Caramel malt (10^o)
                1 oz. Tettnanger (15 min.) + 1 oz. Saaz (3 min.)


Pitched at 73^o, 5 days primary (plastic) at 55^o, 23 days secondary
(glass) started at 55^o and gradually moved down to 45^o. Total=4 weeks.


O.G. = 1.050  /  F.G. = 1.020  (F.G. after 5 days was also 1.020)


The beer has been in bottles now for three weeks. There is very little
carbonation. I have stored some bottles at 45^o, some at 55^o and even
a couple at 75^o and no luck. The beer tastes good - sweeter/maltier
than a pilsener (the Calif. Lager Yeast is supposed to do that),
noticeable hop flavor/aroma and no off-flavors, but no carbonation.


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. (I apologize if this

Hullo Brewmeisters one and all.


Just thought I'd chime in...as always...


RE: Filtering Discussion:


    I had this debate last night with a couple fellow brewers.
I personally think I'd have something to gain by filtering.
I could probably get by with finings and do just as well.
I have several times come up with a keg of beer with sediments
in the bottom that would easily be filtered out. Otherwise every
time the keg is moved it's stirred up again.  


Advantages:  remove dry hop material/ spices/  clumps in general.
Leave most of the yeast behind. Clarify a beer instantly so it can
be carbonated by shaking w/o needing to settle afterwards to clear.
Then it can be moved w/o clouding.


Jim sez he thinks a 5 micron filter is going to remove cells.
Most bacteria are on the order of 1 micron. yeast fall more in
the 3 micron range.  Cells can aggregate and "act" bigger.
But I would contend that a 5 micron filter is definitely not
going to "sterilize" a beer.  And from my understanding (NOT experience)
it will not REMOVE the body of a beer. It may well "thin" things
a bit.  At 3 microns there is more cell removal, but still not
sterilization.  I don't have a problem with lowering the cell
count in a keg.  I force pressurize, so I don't "need" them there,
but I like my B-vitamins, so I don't plan to get rid of them ALL.

Subject: Hop Teas and Dry Hopping ~#


I am brewing a hoppy pale ale, something like Sierra Nevada's 
Celebration ale.  I started with a 1065 O.G. wort, and hopped as 
follows:


        1 oz Centennial (9.6%) 60 min.
        1 oz Mt. Hood (?%) 60 min.
        1 oz Cascades (5.4%) 10 min.


I fermented with WYeast American Ale, of course, keeping the 
temperature mostly below 65.  The question I have is how to 
finish it.  The last time I made this I dry hopped with an ounce 
of Cascades for a week before bottling, and it turned out quite 
well.  My only complaint was that it didn't have the _depth_ of 
hop taste that Celebration has.  I'm leaning towards dry hopping 
again, but noted a suggestion that you steep hops in a hot water 
and add this tea at bottling time for greater flavor and aroma.  
Any suggestions on this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Howdy,


In HBD 1292, Chris Amley brings up the question of using the same beer name
for different beers.  His main concern is that since Noche Buena is brewed
with a different recipe than in the past, it should have a different name.
The fact is, this is an extremely common practice.  Sam Adams claims to
vary their Winter Lager every year, and Anchor actually does vary it's
Our Special Ale.  Add on that a brewery is going to adjust it's
recipes every once in awhile, especially new ones.  Celis Pale Bock is
definitely not the same beer that they first marketed in March of '92; in
fact, it's the 4th version.


I'm not saying it's good or bad, it just is.


Happy brewin',

Subject: Names


I have often wondered, is there any sort of central list of "namebrands"
for homebrews?  I have a couple of friends that all homebrew and we all
have names for our beers, I wondered if anyone keeps a master-list.
