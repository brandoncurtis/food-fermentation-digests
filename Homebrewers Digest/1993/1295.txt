Subject: Answer these questions, three....


Just got my order of brewing supplies shipped from England
to sunny old Southern France where you can't find such things
as home beer brewing is unheard of. The shipping costs were
almost as much as the cost of the supplies (extracts, grains, hops
and yeasts), OUCH! Still, I'm gleefully rubbing my hands together in
anticipation of brewing my next batch, but wanted to bounce a few
questions off the HBD before starting...


Thanks, in advance, for your response(s).


1. Re-using Lager Yeast in Fermenter: I was wondering what risks
or advantages there would be if I ferment a second batch on top
of the yeast left in my primary after siphoning off the previous
batch. I mean to siphon the first batch off, leaving the 1/2 inch
or so of sediment and then immediatly pour on the cooled (80-85 F)
3 gals of wort and top off with water. How much of this 1/2 inch
of trub is live yeast? Would the rest of this dead organic trub
impart off flavors? Would the advantages of having a large yeast
population and a quick start of fermentation outweigh the risk of
off flavors from decaying trub (if there is any)? Would the temps
and sudden introduction of concentrated (3 gal) wort and subsequent
topping off with water shock the yeasties too much?


2. Oatmeal in Stout/Porter: I generally avoid throwing in things
like the kitchen sink. Something of the German Reinheitsgeboet
must have rubbed off during my three years in Munich. But I have
never forgotten the taste of Sammy Smiths Oatmeal Stout and I 
noticed several recipes in the Cat's Meow containing different forms
of oatmeal. I'm intrigued. What qualities would oatmeal add?
Any suggestion on quantities? (I can only find rolled oats here)
When should I add it to the boil? Or should it be steeped? Mashed?


3. When/How to Add Specialty Grains: I plan to make the following
extract based stout:
        4 lbs. Muntons Dark Malt Extract Syrup
        4 lbs. Muntons Light Malt Extract Syrup
        1/2 lb. Crushed Crystal Malt
        1/2 lb. Crushed Chocolate Malt
        1/2 lb. Black Patent Malt
        (1 lb rolled oats ???)
        1 oz. Northern Brewer Hops (30 min.) 
        1.5 oz Hallertauer loose Hops (dry, in the primary)


None of my homebrew info sources explain when/how to properly
use specialty grains for an extract based brew.
In the past I've just tossed my grains in at the beginning of the
boil and boiled the hell outta them for an hour. Those batches
were VERRRY bitter, though I'm not sure if it wasn't the Northern
Brewer (2 oz, loose) which I was trying out at the same time.
Should I not let the grains get more than 150 degrees F, as in
mash conversion? Should I add them after the boil, below a certain
temperature, and let them steep. What temps? What times?
Thanks again,

Subject: Observations


Hi Gang,
Just thought I'd throw out a few observations:
     First, on the subject of EKU28 Kulminator, I love the stuff.  It is an 
     extremely malty, slightly sweet and very strong dopplebock.  I had always
     thought that it was an eisbock, but I am willing to believe the contrary.
     This stuff is definitely not meant to be quaffed in large quantities but
     as an occasional treat, I think its great.  Personally I prefer it to
     Samichlaus which to my palate has less body and sweetness than is
     necissary to balance the high alcohol content.  Another very high alcohol
     beer that I really like is Thomas Hardy's Ale.  This is a barleywine style
     English ale which is also very sweet and strong with pronounced fruity
     (pineapple?) flavors and aromas.  A buddy of mine was runner up to best
     of show in a local competition with a clone of this (Toxic Thomas').
     Unfortunately, Ohio has wierd laws about high alcohol beers that are still
     on the books from the 3.2% ABV days so we cannot get some of the domestic
     barleywines like Old Foghorn and Bigfoot here but whenever I am out of
     state I keep my eyes peeled.


     Second, I recently helped some friends of mine get started with
     homebrewing and since it was their first experience with the process, I
     decided to use dry yeast for simplicity.  I have used Wyeast from the
     start (about 2.5 years of homebrewing) but since these friends didn't
     know wort from warts, I thought I'd keep it basic.  Anyway, I elected for
     the following recipe:


          4# can Telfords Premium Bitter Hopped Extract
          3.3# bag of NWestern Gold Liquid Malt Xtract (unhopped)
          1 oz homegrown Cascade for finishing
          Red Star Dry Ale Yeast


     I chose the Red Star because of good reports here on the HBD and sure
     enough, I tried a bottle of it last night and it was quite good.  None of
     the estery or phenolic flavors that I have heard about with dry yeast.
     The beer has a nice fruityness and overall is very clean.  Im sure it will
     encourage them to keep up with their new hobby.


     Just my $0.02.


Mark

I opened a bottle of my Christmas Stout (after only 5 days .-)_
And it made the most beautiful black, gingery smellig fountain 
that I have seen in a long time. My wife, however, was less impressed
with the mess in made.


I used a recipe from Cats Meow 2 (pg 5-20 in my edition).
If i remember correctly the SG had stabilized at arount 1.14.
That seems high, but my memory might be off. 


Now, i am going to let it sit at least another week before I 
open up another bottle.


If i have the same problem, is there anything I can do to correct 
it?

Sorry, but at DoD minimum speed it is impossible to speak. There is just 
too much wind noise.  At that speed I am spending all my concentration 
allowance on riding, and cannot afford anymore thought for words.  
However, when I finish a ride and the bike is in the garage cooling

Of the commercial non-alcoholic beers I've tried, the only one I

makes.  American Pilsener isn't one of my favorite styles, but it is
one of the important beer styles of the world.

I ordered the Raspberry and Cherry fruit extracts from Mark Garetz.  I
haven't yet had time to brew a fruit beer with them (I might get to a
Framboise this weekend), but I have experimented with adding drops to
my cyser.  The raspberry worked pretty well, but the Cherry is
definitely concentrated enough to be hard to control in this mode.
Next time I get the urge to try this, I will dilute a dropperfull N to
1, where N is some number like 4 or 5, and add that by drops to my
glass.


In any case, the flavors were certainly good, it was just hard to
squeeze the cyser bottle hard enough to get the level of cherry flavor
I wanted.

Subject: Sour Cherry Syrup in Stout


A question for you all.  Has anyone used Sour Cherry Syrup (I found it in
the Middle Eastern foods section of the local ethnic market, though it
was made in Yugoslavia) in brewing?


I used it in a cherry stout that I started a couple of weeks ago, adding a
16oz bottle to a 5gal batch after the initial fermentation subsided.  It
foamed up again for a couple of days, due to the sugar, then calmed down;
I tasted it, and there was hardly any cherry component.  It was pretty
seriously cherry-ish in the syrup bottle, though.  Any ideas on how much it'd
take to do the job?  If this will work, it's a whole lot easier than
fooling around with fresh fruit....

Subject: RE: fruit flavoring ( Raspberry )


Greetings:
        
        Alan in Austin ( HBD 1294) laments the lack of color in his raspberry
beer.  I made a raspberry stout using a soda raspberry flavoring made by 
Flavorchem in Il. and it is RED!  Straight out of the bottle it tastes
horrible ( but raspberry-ish ) and it will dye everything it touches red.


I used 1/2 the bottle for the stout after fermentation - at bottle time.  I 
tasted the stuff at that time and I was afraid I had overdone it with the
flavoring - really strong raspberry flavor.  Well, about 1 month of aging
has improved this beverage.  The stout flavors balance the raspberry quite
nicely, and if I hold a bottle to the light, it has a redish glow - the color
is certainly there.  


The flavoring comes in a small bottle ( ~ 2 OZ ) and cost $2.58.


Next time I use it I will use 1/3 bottle - less if I'm making a lighter beer.


regards,
Michael

Subject: New w/question


Brewers,


    I am new to the list and to homebrewing.  Have one batch of
Continental Light, made from a kit, to my credit.  My product
came out fine body and colorwise w/ good carbonation.  The only
problem is a very (ultra - mega) yeasty aftertaste.  Actually
enough to make me shivver after swallowing.  The guy at the
store where I bought the kit said to chill the next batch
before bottling and that should cure the problem.  From reading
the messages here, I suppose my description is a little cryptic
and that without knowing other variables involved it might be
difficult to suggest a solution.  I just thought that maybe
there is a fairly standard cause for excessive yeast flavor.
The fermenting went according to directions as far as time and
specific gravity readings go.


    I read, in one brewing book, a note about skimming the
fermenting froth from the top of the batch as it rises during
the fermentation.  The guy at the store said "No, don't do
that."  Can anyone offer advice on this yeast mystery?

In Friday's HBD Jim Busch writes:


"I favor using a hot water heater for sparge (hot liquor tank), and 
use the kettle to mash in.  Transfer the mash to the dedicated 
lauter tun with some kind of false bottom (perf sheet works great), 
insulate the lauter tun.  "


I have a keg that I fitted with a SS screen false bottom and have a 
tap coming out of the bottom of the keg as my sweet liquor outlet. 
The perf sheet I have is 3/32" holes on 5/32" centers. (I got this 
size from the Brewer's Warehouse sheets. They claim it's the 
standard microbrewery size. Can anyone verify?)

              \____________                        


             Tap out the bottom 


Anyway, I get a lot of grain particles that bypass the screen, 
enough that I have to send the runnings thru a strainer to catch the 
big pieces. I have an adjustable MaltMill and have tried it set as 
wide as .055" to minimize husk shredding, but I still get 
granule-size particles passing the screen. Whaddaya think? 


I've considered
* Crushing twice. Once set wide to remove husks, then set close to 
pulverize everything.
* Getting a smaller screen size, like 1/16" holes
* Having the screen welded into the keg or fitting some sort of 
gasket around the screen. There is a slight gap around the edges, 
but it appears to be of less width than the holes. Also, right as 
the last of the liquor drains out, I get a huge amount of grain 
coming out the tap.
* Putting a small extension on the keg side of the outlet to raise 
it about the bottom of the tun floor, letting any crud sit on the 
bottom.


Any help on this is greatly appreciated. My beers turn out pretty 
good, but my extraction is suffering (28 ppg for the bucket system, 
25 ppg for this) and the frustration level is getting pretty high. 
Also I've had to add polyclar to the finished beer because the 
tannins are a bit high from all the husk material making it into the 
kettle and that eliminates a lot of the malty flavor that I worked 
so hard for.

What you need for good head retention are proteins. Proteins are what
provides the surface tension which give the bubbles some strength. However,
proteins can also cause haze so you have to have a ballance. Hops are a
good source of proteins for head retention but you have a Brown Ale so you
have to go easy on the bitterness so use more of a lower alpha acid hop. If
you aren't adding hops at all then a good short-cut is to use just enough
wheet (2-4 oz) to get some proteins but not so much that you get any
noticable wheet flavor. Good hot and cold breaks will be necessary to clear
the beer.


The above has worked for me in practice but I have a question about the
theory. What is the difference between the proteins that aid head retention
and those which produce chill haze? Is it molecular wieght?, length of the
molecule? Why does one class coagulate and precipitate and the other
doesn't or does so to a lesser degree?

I RECENTLY BREWED UP A HOLIDAY BRAU AND ADDED THE USUAL ASSORTMENT OF SPICES
AND THINGS.. AND I HAD SOME STRANGE RESULTS. 


WHEN I MOVED EVERYTHING TO THE FERMENT TANK I DIDN'T GET A BUBBLE FOR THE 1ST
DAY, HOWEVER 2 DAYS LATER IT WAS AT FULL CRANK. ON THE 6TH DAY IT BLEW BEER
THROUGH THE VAPOR LOCK SOME 9 FEET INTO THE AIR(RATHER FUN TO WATCH BUT A MESS
TO CLEAN..) THE HEAD PEEKED AND FELL BACK IN, I DRAINED IT TO THE SECOND
FERMENT TANK AND WAITED.. IT BUBBLED SLIGHTLY ONCE AN HOUR, 2 DAYS LATER, I
BOTTLED. IT HAS BEEN 2 WEEKS AND I WENT DOWN TO THE CELLAR AND I NOTICED A
WHITE RING INSIDE OF ALL THE BOTTLES... WHAT IS THIS?? IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A
MINI HEAD BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE THICKENED FROTH... WILL IT GO AWAY?? SHOULD I
JIGGLE THE BOTTLES AND GET IT TO DROP TO THE BOTTOM? I ALSO NOTICED A THICKER
SEDIMENT IN THE BOTTOM OF MY BOTTLES THAN USUAL. SHOULD I BE CONCERNED? I
OPENED ONE AND GOT THIS MAJOR GUSHER (I SEEM TO BE GETTING A LOT OF THESE
THESE DAYS BOTH WITH OLD AND NEW BEERS) -- SHOULD THEY BE CHILLED LONGER? IS
THERE ANYWAY TO COUNTERACT THIS?

Two questions:


  1) I just bought a fantastic can(!) of Murphy's Irish Stout that poured like
a dream!  The can is marketed as containing a 
   "Unique Draughtflow System" - basically a plastic pressurized insert.
Can someone please explain how this works?  Very Impressed!


  2) I've been working on a Stout of my own that seems to be stuck at 1.030
for some time now.  The airlock is still held high, though bubbling is maybe
once per hour.  I used Wyeast Irish Ale to get it going...  Thanks!

I agree, Richard, that much Canadian beer (like much American beer)
tastes alike, but luckily Quebec does not have a monopoly on excellent
micro-breweries.  Last time I was in Montreal I remember drinking some fine
beer, but I also recall sampling more than a few pints in Toronto (Upper
Canada Breweries, Amsterdam & Rotterdam Brew Pub, and many others).  Even
here in Vancouver we have several, my favorite being Granville Island; that
is, aside from what I make in my own kitchen.

Subject: All grains are not created equal


In HBD #1284 Jim Busch made a few comments regarding grains which raised
some questions in my mind.  Apparently Jim feels that all grains are not
created equal (use imported Munich, not domestic, why would you use a 6 row?).


What are the differences between a 6 row and a 2 row malt?  What are the
advantages of using imported vs. domestic (domestic = American I assume).
What should be considered when choosing between say, German, Belgian, British,
and American grains?

There are a couple of possible causes for a burnt taste.  The first
is simply the amount of dark malts (chocolate & patent).  You basically
have a very dark porter.  In fact, a little roast barley and you'd have
a stout.  If it's a "roasty-burnt" character, that's probably the reason.
This character will tend to smooth with time, so hang on to it and see
how it progresses.  Maybe you should just find some stout drinkers to
share it with!


On the other hand, if it has a very unpleasant burnt taste, and aroma,
it may be due to phenolics, possibly from bad yeast, an infection, or
even somewhat from oxidation.  It's less likely in this case that the
problem will go away, though you still may want to let it sit a few
months and see what happens.


Peter Brauer asked about homebrew "namebrands".  I'm sure there are
quite a few.  The "Organization:"  header in my email (which
unfortunately doesn't show up in the digest) says "Fat Wanda's Brewery
and Recording".  This occasionally results my receiving messages that
ask "Just what in the heck is Fat Wanda's?".  For the record, Wanda is
my partner's golden retriever, who, while not exactly fat, is a little
on the chunky side.  Actually, the full title of the establishment is
"Fat Wanda's Brewery, Recording, Photo, Custom Fly Rods, and Garden-
Fresh Produce".  Dance studio and Diesel Repair to be added soon.

I just wanted to set the record strait on EKU Kulminator.  Actually
'28' refers to the number of pounds of malt that are used per
1 liter serving.  This works out to be about 1.49 metric tons of
malt per barrel.  This explains the intense maltiness and the high
alcohol level - 198 proof if memory serves me correctly.  It is
used as a gasoline substitute in many European communities.


It is recommended that you wear a wrist or ankle grounding
strap while you are pouring or drinking this beer to minimize
the chance of a spark induced fire.  Just a data point...

Seriously, though, what kind of beer was it?  From where in Africa does it
come? How did it taste other than having quite a kick (did I ever tell you
about my Uncle Manny who used to bathe once a month in EKU 28?), and did you
really buy a case of it?

As a former resident of Williamsburg, and a former many-time visitor of AB's

 -You get two freebies, which used to be four. You needn't schlep through the
tour to do it, either--just walk a couple hundred feet from the entrance and
yer there.


 -you can get to the brewery from the amusement park next door. There's a
monorail that takes you to it, and the walk is even shorter to the freebie
area (no exhibits to pass by.) Rather than enjoy the hokey atmosphere and
$2.75 AB beers at the "hofbrauhuas", take the monorail, quaff some freebies
(they will politely limit you after your 2nd only if they're paying
attention--never have I been bugged about getting three) and head back to the
park. Return later for more freebies if you desire, as the servers change
shifts regularly, and in summer when it's crowded they're way busy.
OK, OK, so I was a college student back then, and free beer, even AB, was a
deal. 


 -If you're really mad at old August and Co., you may also gain free entrance
into the park, which saves you $25 a head. This depends on them still having
a way for you to just shop in their boutique area without paying the whole
tariff. You pay a deposit and must return in two hours to get your money
back. Once in, go directly to the monorail and ride to the brewery. As you
leave the park, your hand will be stamped so you may return to the park.
(people just taking the brewery tour can't get on the monorail and go to the
park.) Drink a beer if you like, then return to the park. Get your money
back, then drive over to the brewery (drink more beer), get back on the
monorail and head for a fun filled day on rides built from money made on all
those suckers who think Bud dry is a taste achievement.


Sorry if this is not germane, but, y'know.

In reference to Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic and the use of Maple Syrup
in beer, I was at a Beer Tasting/Dinner last evening, ala Michael Jackson
in Belguim on the Beer Hunter video, at a local resturant (Allentown, Pa)
where twelve christmas beers were served throughout a six course meal.
This included Anchor, Sierra Nevada, Stoudt's, Dolle Broweries (sp), 
Samiclaus, Schildes (Belgium Busch), Dock Street, St. Sylvester, Young's,
several other Belgiums, and the now infamous Cranberry Lambic. The host
pointed out it wasn't a true lambic and said that it had maple syrup added
to balance the tartness of the cranberries. To me it tasted like a Kriek I
attempted last summer, namely not so good. But, for those looking for a 
use of maple syrup in homebrewing, this could be your chance.

I have had this beer. It is obviously a lager in the Munich style, very
malty and surprisingly good (well balanced). I would start by using a 
bock recipe. Sorry, can't get more specific than that, had just one bottle
of it and that was more than year ago.

My understanding is that the 28 stands for the OG in degrees Plato and,
as was also posted in HBD1294, the abv is in 13% range.


And also posted:

I like it, but there's no accounting for taste. My bother says he thinks it
has the same aroma as the insect we call a "daddy-long-legger" after the
legs have been pulled off! I guess that qualifies as vile. Please note,
my brother and I haven't pulled the legs off a daddy-long-legger since the
late '60's when I was about 8 years old. (25 years before Beavis and

I suggest that perhaps the 3-4 hour pause to allow for hot and
cold break settling and the subsequent transfer off the trub
reduced the benefits of blowoff.  I've done this experiment
twice and each time the difference was stunning.  I used a
1 gallon jug, filled 3/4 full and a 5 gallon carboy filled to
the top.  The geometry was not very close.  I would like to
try to retry this test with closer fermenter geometries.  Perhaps
a 5-gallon fermenter and a 6-gallon fermenter?  Perhaps a 3-gallon
and a 1-gallon jug?  I'll have to work on it.

the hop tea version had lost all of it's hop aroma and the dryhopped
version beat it hands down.  Both the 2-3 day tasting and 1-month
tasting were unanimous decisions by our club members.

I got this once from an all-extract (no specialty grains) batch.
It turns out that I scorched the malt in the kettle.  It never
went away.  I had it in a keg, so I just used it up to flavor some
under-flavored commercial brews.

Head retention is a function of small proteins and dextrins in your beer.
Crystal malt will add some dextrins and thus some head retention.  To
have control of your small proteins, you need to mash (although some
extracts may give you better head retention than others -- I don't know
which).  I've been speculating for about a year that the blowoff method
may reduce head retention by blowing off some of these small proteins.
Bill -- any data here?  Protein rests at the lower end (112-122F, I believe)
of the proteolytic range will turn your big proteins into amino acids,
whereas protein rests at the higher end (122-140F) will make less amino
acids, but more small proteins (better head).

With all the talk about getting extract out of the bag (in a box), I am
prompted to write about a procedure invented(?) by a Just Brew It club
member:


                    The "Chopstick Method"


1. Set the plastic bag-o-extract in a sinkful of hot water to soak.
2. Locate a set of chopsticks: nice or disposable, it matters not.
3. Cut/Slice open the top of the extract bag and pour into the ketttle
   as usual.
4. Hold the bag by the top two corners and have a helper position the
   two chopsticks one on each side of the bag up near where you are
   holding onto the bag. Make sure the opening points toward the kettle.
5. Next, your helper will press the two chopsticks together and draw the       
   pair of them down the length of the bag towards the kettle.  Stop, of
   course when you get down to the open end of the bag.


If done properly, you will have neatly extruded almost every drop of
extract and will not have it all over you, your helper, your kitchen
and the dog (or cat).


Thanks to Rob Dahlgren, inventor of the chopstick method.

I was able to pick up a *very* used commercial soda cooler for $50.
The kind which has sliding doors and is in stores or taco shops.  Not

trick, but again, I *like* my beer warm, so I have no data on that.
