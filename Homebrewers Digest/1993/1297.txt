Subject: Mead questions


Dear Brewers,


My fiance asked me about three weks ago whether I had any plans to brew
a mead for our honeymoon, and I thought the idea was great.  So I
consulted with Papezian and chose his recipe for the Barckshack Ginger
Mead, adding razberries (sp?) and refraining from additional spices,
like lemongrass or cinnamon.  I adjusted the measurements for a 2 gal
batch, rather than the standard 5 gal.


I'd brewed a mead once before - it was a recipe I'd received from this
forum called something like "quick mead" which was supposed to be
ready within a month... It wasn't!  At least as far as the taste went..
But then again, that was my first batch.  I've been brewing beers for
about four years with some really quite good results - and some dismal
failures (some may remember my troubles with an atrocity I named for the
flooding of Chicago: "Chicago Tunnel Water").  So anyway, here are my
questions for mead enthusiasts:


The mead is now racked into 2 1gal. bottles (one is full to the neck,
the other about only 1/2 full).  OG: 1.055; SG `at` racking: 1.010.
The taste before pitching was exquisite, with an almost perfect
balance between the honey, ginger and razberries (about a pound of
those)  However `at` racking, the fermentation seemed to have hurt the
flavor, with an off flavor best described as like A & D Ointment!  The
"bouquet" seemed to have soured as well, offering a smell more like
ripe yeasties (like when we clean our carboys after bottling).  Is
this normal and/or will these flavors mellow and balence within a few
months?  That's question #1.


Question #2 is: After I racked to the secondary vessels and fixed them
with fermentation locks, I brought these tanks to the basement storage
area to ferment, settle and clarify for another month or so before
I bottle.  But there are hot water pipes that run through the storage
roomand do give off some heat (I'd estimate that it's a steady 80F
though I've not yet monitored the temperature).  I don't think its
too threatening to the brew, but just to be sure, what is an accept-
able temperature range for meads in the secondary?


Thanks in advance for any and all responses, which can also be emailed
to me at xlpsjgn`at`luccpua.it.luc.edu or to catfishjon`at`aol.com.


Whew! that's good brew!

Subject: Yeast Farming/Ranching


I've got a quick question regarding yeast ranching.  I've been ranching 
yeastfor a year or so now using the kit from BrewTek but I'm still a 
little confused about one subject:  what is the best (optimal) way 
to go from a yeast collected from a bottle to a plate (to isolate a 
single colony) to a slant?  I've sort of got down the part going from
the bottle to the plate, but what do you do with the single colony 
off the plate?  I'd like to build up a decent slant to share with my 
friends.  Thanks ...

Subject: Murphys pressure device


As far as I can see the plastic insert in the Murphys can
releases a stream of gas bubbles through the liquid when the
can is opened and "dunked".


As an Irish person orginally living a mile from the Murphy's
Brewery the difference between the new pressurised can and the
real thing from a pub tap is very slight.

Guinness also offers these in their Pub Draft cans; "like a keg, but easier

I dunno how they work, but I regard it as the natives viewed the thermos
("How does it know if the drink is hot or cold?"), or as Arthur C. Clarke
said, "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from

In the past I've just tossed my grains in at the beginning of the
boil and boiled the hell outta them for an hour. Those batches
were VERRRY bitter, though I'm not sure if it wasn't the Northern
Brewer (2 oz, loose) which I was trying out at the same time.
Should I not let the grains get more than 150 degrees F, as in
mash conversion? Should I add them after the boil, below a certain
temperature, and let them steep. What temps? What times?
Thanks again,




steve, as a fellow extract brewer (2 batches so far) I can tell
you not to boil the hell outta the speciality grains, as you'll
suck the tannins from the husks, contributing to quite a bitter
tang. Much like overbrewing a _dark_ tea, it's not something
you wanna do.


Hope this helps.

Subject: German Malt Types






For several months in my all-grain brewing I have been chasing
that very malty character found in premium German Octoberfest,
Bocks, etc. I have tried decoction but it still doesn't seem to be
getting me there. I wonder if I should use different malts?


My local homebrew supply carries Ireks German Pilsner, Vienna and
Munich. I have been using these in various combinations as called
for in a given recipe. Are there more malty German malts available,
perhaps by mail order? If so, I'd appreciate your dropping
me a note to direct my "hunt". Thanks!

weiss, with lots of body and sediment, and goes

Hello All,
        Is there anyone out there who would be willing to trade 
any type of micro-brewed beer that is availible only in their area
for anything I can get them up here in the Northeast (Boston & New 
England)? My boyfriend & I have a bottle collection that we'd like 
to expand, and aren't real fussy ( we'll drink almost anything!) so
if you'd like to try something from around this-a-way let me know,
and we'll work out a deal.
        Re: taking the long way home; This past weekend we found 
ourselves driving home from a couple of days skiing in Vermont and 
decided to make the trip a brewery/brewpub tour. 1st stop, Mountain
Brewers in Bridgwater, Vt., the makers of Long Trail (Amber Ale, Stout,
Kolsch,I.P.A.) self guided tour, small tap room, great beer! 2nd stop,
Catamount in White River Junction, they have guided tours (we missed
everything but the tasting) and tasting of current products. Both of
these two sell bottled product and other stuff in the "tap room". 3rd 
stop, Latchis Hotel, (brewpub has a separate name I don't remember at
the moment) Brattleboro Vt. This place was ok, the beer was tasty but
it had a yuppie-fern bar type atmosphere that was a little stuffy. Last
but certainly not least was McNeil's Brewery in Brattleboro. Great beer,
good food (sandwiches, nachos, nothing fancy), I wish they'd had a places
like this around when I was in college, it looked like it'd be a real fun
place when it was busy. BTW, McNeils should get awards just for the names
of their beers, i.e. Duck's Breath Bitter, Slopbucket Brown, Dead Horse IPA,
to name a few.
        I tried Molson Ice this weekend, $3.00/bottle at some bar in 
Killington, (thankfully the bartender goofed and only charged us for 
one!) all I can say is YUCK! Absolutly no taste what so ever. I wouldn't
spend the money to give it away to some poor unsuspecting fool.


Ah well, back to work,        


Cheers,
Pam

Subject: Burnt? not anymore!


HBDers,


Thank you for your comments about the burnt taste
I had in my Xmas ale last week.  I wanted to bring you
up to date on a dramatic change that took place.  I
drew another pint out of the keg to better characterize
the off taste last Thursday.  The burnt after taste was
GONE!  After only one week!  Now the beer has a wonderfully
smooth character with a mild sweetness balanced by an
appropriate hop bitterness.  The hop aroma is powerful 
with a spicy note. (this is the batch I posted a dry-hop
question on several months ago.  I took the plunge and 
added 3.5 oz of Willamette pellets to the racked beer.)


I wouldn't believe the dramatic change in the beer character
if I hadn't tasted it myself.  Furthermore, my wife who is
not a beer lover {not even my own 8-(  } tasted the burnt
taste last week and now thinks the beer is drinkable.  I believe 
that the long conditioning and "lagering" at 40F allowed 
some of the more bitter, off flavor components to precipitate
to the bottom of the keg.  My first 5 pints or so drew off
this evil stuff and now I have a pretty tasty holiday brew.


Thank you all for your comments anyway.

Subject: Another question re: aluminium pots


Dear brewers,


Over the years I've developed a boiling technique which, while seeming
to ease the boiling process (actually the removal of steeped specialty
grains from the boil), I've always suspected but never questioned
whether it's harmful to the beer I make.


What I do is steep the grains in 1.5 gal. of cold water in my 3 gal
stainless steel brew pot and bring that to a boil (a la Papezian).
Then, once the water begins to boil, Papezian instructs to remove the
grains from wort before adding the malt extract and hops (I'm not
ready for the all-grain league yet).  But this always was a long and
tedious process, fishing around for all those little grains.  So, I
thought I'd shorten the process by placing a strainer over another
brew pot of the same capacity, but made of aluminium.  I'd sparge the
collected grains, then return the wort to the original stainless steel
pot, reheat to a boil then add the extract(s) and hops.


So the questions are:  1) Is the (temporary) use of the aluminium pot
detrimental to my beer?  even if it's in the pot for 15 minutes max?
and 2) is my method of straining the grains - basically pouring the
wort once through a strainer, and again back into the original pot -
going to effect or hurt (bruise?) the wort... even if I haven't yet
added the extracts and hops?


Thanks in advance for the responses, and thanks to all who responded
earlier to my mead questions.


Cheers!


John

Subject: Brewpots: kegs or REAL stock pots?


Brett --


IMNSHO, the *minimum* useful size for brewing a five gallon batch is a 32 
quart pot (8 gallons).  You can get an enamel 8 gallon canning pot for about 
$35 (with lid).  This is what I'm using.  The geometry is poor for doing a 2 
hour boil -- too much surface area for the volume.  I boil 75 minutes, and go 
from about 7 gallons to about 5-3/4.  The lid is on (_on_ is too strong -- its 
over the pot, but plenty of steam esacpes) for the last 15 minutes while the 
chiller and the lid get sterilized.  The 8 gallon pot covers two burners on my 
stove, and I use `em both during the boil.


I would like to get a ten gallon stainless stock pot, but they cost about $175 
new.  So, I'm thinking about going the old keg route instead.  Oh, if you get 
a stockpot, get one with a thick bottom.  Some of `em have a copper disk 
sandwhiched between layers of stainless, others use aluminum.  That's what you 
really want.  Otherwise, the thicker, the better.


Good Luck,

          Lagering under a frozen river/lake sounds like a great idea.
          In fact I was planning to do something simmilar over the
          holidays.  I was going to lager my beer in a tank full of
          water in the garage.  Since the freezing point of beer is
          lower than the freezing point of water, as long a the tank
          doesn't freeze, then the beer will stay unfrozen at 32 F
          (zero C) or higher.  I figure that here (in Michigan) my
          garage should stay warm enough to keep the tank of water
          from freezing.  The water will also act as a large heat sink
          to moderate temperature fluctuations.  If we get a severe
          cold snap I can just bring the beer inside for a bit or rig
          up a heater in the garage.  A friend of mine did this once -
          called it his garage lager.  One concern about lagering
          under the ice would be that too much pressure would build up
          in a closed container from residual fermentation that takes
          place during lagering.  I have not lagered before so I don't
          know how much fermentation to expect at this stage.  I will
          probably use a fermentation lock.

          On Gushing Beer
          
          The following quote is from the Encyclopedia of Chemical 
          Technology:
          
          "Wild or gushing beer is a defect observed as a rather 
          violent over-foaming from the bottle immediately after 
          opening; this defect, however, does not affect the taste of

The bitterness you noted was not caused by the hops.  It was caused by boiling 
the grains.  Boiling extracts tannins which will lead to an astringent taste 
in your brew.  I've been sucessful putting the specialty grains into a muslin 
bag and putting it into the brewpot along with the cold brewing water.  I then 
heat the water and grain and remove the grain bag just before the water comes 
to a boil.  Some claim this method may also extract tannin and advocate 
bringing the water to 150 deg.F and letting the grains steep.

Letting it sit another week won't solve the problem -- in fact it might 
worsen.  One thing you could try is to chill the beer down in the bottle 
before opening.  This worked for me with a batch I overprimed by mistake.

I've been doing extract-based brewing for about 2 years now, and most
of what I know comes from The Complete Joy of Homebrewing and HBD.


I generally add some small amount of specialty grain to my
extract-based brews.  I might add 1-2 pounds of crystal malt at the
maximum, but less than half a pound combined of all other types.  The
thing to remember is that except for crystal, the specialty malts you're
adding are contributing unfermentable starch to the brew.  Crystal
malt is different, in processing it mostly gets converted to
fermentable sugar.  Processing malt in other ways, e.g. roasting it to
achieve darker colors, not only doesn't convert the starch, but in
fact destroys the enzymes in the malt needed to do the conversion.  
When you start adding amounts on the order of 1 lb or more adjuncts,
as your recipe suggests, you're going to get a lot of unconverted
starch in the wort, which will eventually end up in the beer.  


To avoid this, if you really want to use all these adjucts (which you
well might if you want to brew a nice stout) you might consider (as I
do with almost every batch :-) using a partial-mash process.  You have
to be sure that (at least some of) the extract you use has the ability
to convert the starch to fermentable sugars. The only commercially
available extract that I know of is that has the conversion capacity
is Edme's DMS (Diastatic Malt Syrup.) (This info comes (I think) from
TCJoH, I'd be pleased to hear about other alternatives.)


Anyway, without getting into partial-mashing, the way I treat my
specialty grains is to add them to the cold water at the start of the
process, and then when the water is about to boil, before adding malt
extract or hops, remove as much as possible with a kitchen seive.
This technique comes directly from TCJoH.  The justfication is that
the good stuff (color, flavoring, proteins, whatever you're adding the
grains for) is easily soluable, and doesn't need a lot of boiling to
extract, and that prolonged boiling will just extract some excessively
bitter stuff, probably mostly tannin, from the husks.

Subject: Simulating an English beer engine


OK, I think it's about time I report on my latest gadget. Some of you may 
remember my recent trip to the UK. I fell in love with the beers there and 
have been fooling around with ideas to simulate the flavors and dispensing 
methods I experienced there. The cask conditioned ales have some 
characteristics that are easy to simulate. Hops, malt, low gas, warm, yeast 
but some that aren't. I got home and immediately brewed up a low gravity, 
english style ale. When I put it on my draft system, something was missing. 
I had kept the CO2 at 0 psi when kegging and brought the gas up to about 
5psi to dispense. Tasted OK, but the head was gone of course. The creamy 
whipped head is caused by the sparklers on most beer engines in the UK. Ok, 
I thought what the beer engine REALLY does is lift or pull the beer from the 
keg and force the beer through a series of very small holes. This causes 
both foaming and whipping of air into the beer. I reasoned that I could do 
the same without a beer engine. What I built is a valve with a piece of 
copper tubing at the output of the valve. The end of the copper tubing has a 
cap on it. The cap has about 6 holes .020 in diameter in it. This assembly 
is placed at the end of about a four foot piece of 1/4" id PVC line. Now to 
use this gadget I raise the keg pressure up to about 10 psi, open the valve 
and point the output into a glass. As you can imagine, 6 streams of beer 
exit and foam and aerate the beer. The glass fills and when you set the 
glass down, the beer recombines in the glass from the bottom up, just like 
the beers in the UK do. Now it's usually necessary to top the glass off in a 
few seconds, they also do this in the UK. After I've dispensed the beer I 
reduce the keg pressure back to 0psi.  Bingo, this gadget very closely 
simulates the flavors and effect of the English beer engines. The aeration 
and head creamy head are bang on to what I tasted in the UK. I now have to 
decide how to incorporate this gadget better into my draft system.


I am considering either one of two ideas to make using this concept alittle 
easier to use. One would be to keep the keg at about 1psi and add a small 
pump to raise the pressure to push the beer through the sparkler. The other 
is to push the beer with nitrogen instead of CO2. This way I could leave the 
keg at 10psi and not pick up any carbonation. I have been threatening to go 
to a mixed gas system, this may be the push over the top. This post is 
getting long, I'll stop by sayng, give it a try, you may like it. My 
appologies to all the people in the UK on butchering the tradition of cask 
condition ales, but I think I have come up with a pretty good simulation.


Fellow brewers, open your eyes, gased ales are not necessarly the best ales. 
With no gas, one can make a lower gravity beer and experience the malt and 
hop flavors MUCH better. I not saying I'm going to make all my beers now 
without CO2, I am saying it really adds another demension to beer.

You're right about the proteins, but they have to be small proteins.  Also,
I think you may be confusing something regarding the hops.  I'm quite certain
there are no proteins gained by the beer from the hops, however, there have
been studies that have found a correlation between head retention and a certain
component of the hops (cohumulone, I believe... sorry, don't have my books

Norman writes about the "Chopstick Method" for getting all the extract out
of those bagged extracts.  I have alternate method that I've invented and

warning to potential users.  I call it the "Spoon and Exhaust Hood Method."
It involves pinning the bag between the Exhaust Hood and your Charismatic
Wooden Spoon and then pulling up on the bag.  The problem with this method
is that inevitably the spoon slips off (under) the hood and flings a dollop
of extract against the backstop of the range.  Yuck!


************
Rich writes about inconsistent carbonation despite always using 3/4 cup
of dextrose for priming.


There are two other factors besides the amount of priming sugar that can
cause overcarbonation.  1) unwelcome visitors and 2) bottling too early.
Unwelcome visitors include bacteria and wild yeasts.  You may be introducing
them at bottling time, during fermentation or even as early as at pitching
time.  Bacteria and wild yeasts (S. diastaticus, for example) often can
eat sugars that your primary fermentation yeast cannot.  Thus, once the
primary fermentation is done, the wild yeasts slowly eat the left over
sugars and overcarbonate the beer.  Alternatively, if you have bacteria in 
your beer (which often do not produce gasses and thus do not overcarbonate
the beer directly), they can break the larger, unfermentable carbohydrates 
into smaller, fermentable sugars which your fermenation yeast can now eat,
thereby overcarbonating.  The second factor is much more easy to solve --
don't bottle too early.  I usually wait till the airlock is bubbling less
than once per minute, often waiting till it's less than once per two minutes.

The only potential problem as I see it is that perhaps the ice expansion
could compress the part of the carboy that's sticking through the ice and
break it.  Would the whole thing be under water, or would the top of the
carboy be sticking through the ice?  If the whole thing was under water,
then I'd worry about pressure building up from (very slow) yeast activity
and popping the top.


As an alternative, why not build an insulated box and put a thermostatically
 -controlled HEATER in it?  This could be put outside and use nature to keep
it cold.  The thermostat could be set to 4C and would warm the fermenter when
the temperature in the box gets too cold.

The folllowing should be added to my review of the RIMS which appeared
in the Winter issue of Zymurgy. This addition will appear in the next

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 


It has come to my attention that Sabco is marketing only a part of
the Conrad Keys/Rodney Morris RIMS system. Missing from Sabco's
product is the grain mill Conrad designed for this system.


This omission could possibly cause problems. Without the right sort of
crush this system could lead to grain compactification and leeching
of undesirables from husks, to cite but two examples. Thus anyone who
is interested in the Sabco system should also give serious consideration to
the purchase of an adjustable roller mill. Do not be afraid to experiment
with roller spacing, for the requirements on grain milling are different
for the RIMS setup as compared to a standard mashing system. The performance
of the system is the best guide to deciding how the grains should be crushed.
The goals are to get a smooth and homogeneous recirculation, yields in the
32-34 pts*gal/lb range, and absolutely no grain astringency in the finished 
beer.

How much do I need to worry about scorching at the bottom of

The heat source is an electric burner attached to the bottom
