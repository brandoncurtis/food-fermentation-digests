 We exchanged mail on this subject but you failed to mention the hole size of 
 the lauter tun false bottom.  It looks to me like another classic example of 
 how scaling down commercial equipment to hombrew sized batches just does not 
 work very well.  3/32" holes are probably too large for the geometry of a 
 homebrew tun.
 
 I hate to sound like a broken record, but all your problems will go away if 
 you build an easymasher for it and throw away the false bottom.  The first 
 easy masher I made (long before it was called one) was simply back up for 
 what got through the false bottom.  The f/b caused so much grief that I took 
 it out and never used it again.  They simply are not necessary or useful in 
 homebrew lauter tuns.

Subject: River lagering


Regarding Greg Pyle's query about lagering under the ice of an Ontario 
river.


As an avid homebrewer and flyfisherman, the idea would seem to present two 
problems: 
1. CO2 would slowly build up within the sealed glass carboy (no airlock) 
and could explode;
2. The carboy could be swept away during spring runoff. (Even the most 
tranquil summer stream can become a raging torrent after a couple of warm 
afternoons.)


Nevertheless, I wish my fellow Canadian good luck with the idea and will 
keep an eye open this spring for either a carboy drifting past the island 
of Montreal or some not-too-sober trout migrating upstream towards free 
beer.

Subject: WINE




The following is a recipie which I used as a college student.  It doesn't 
always produce the best tasting wine (depending on how good a winemaker you
are), but produces alcohol...
  
                  Banerjee's "Grocery Store" Wine
 
1.  Buy a 1 gallon jug of apple juice or cider in a glass jar.  Drink 3-4    
cups of juice.
 
2.  Bring 5-6 cups of the remaining juice to a boil with 3-4 cups sugar       
to produce a sweet solution.
 
3.  Add said sweet solution back to the juice.
 
4.  Add 1 tsp dry yeast (wine yeast is preferrable, but any will do)  Note    
that baker's yeast imparts a taste on the wine, and produces less 
    alcohol, but it still works if you're desparate.
 
5.  Seal the top with a stopper or puddy.  the stopper or puddy (clay)    
should have a hole as to allow a 1/4" vinyl tube to stick through,         but
not allow any air to get into the juice except for through the         tube. 
The end of the tube that sticks through the puddy should not
    extend all the way to the juice, but rather should end in the air     space
between the puddy and the juice.  The other end of the tube          should be
immersed in water.
 
6.  If you have a bubbler lock, use it and ignore step 5.
  
7.  Keeping the mixture between 75 and 90 degrees F, wait 2 weeks.  Note:     
temperatures above about 100 F seems to kill most yeast.  That is,        
don't add the yeast to a really hot mixture.
  
8.  If you feel like bottling the wine to allow you to start another          
batch of wine, do so, otherwise, wait another 2 weeks.
 
9.  Drink and be merry, for tomorrow the world may end.
  
10. The second time around, instead of buying another jug of apple juice,     
make grape juice in the same jug using 2 cans of frozen grape juice       
(preferrably a brand that doesn't contain vitamin C).
  
11. Hint:  get a hole bunch of jugs going at the same time to get a           
constant supply of wine.

Hi Norm (and the HBD crowd!), I guess I'm a bit of a dreamer too...


I've been thinking of similar systems myself, have you considered a small
gas fired hot water heater for your hot liquor tank?


        It seems to me that you have a closed, well insulated system here
which already has the plumbing to safely handle the gas, water and
combustion fumes. With the addition of the appropriate ball valves, safety
valve and an outlet on the top for your steam supply you have a dual
purpose hot liquor tank/steam generator. You might even fashion some sort
of door for water treatments (it would need to hold some modest pressure
for your steam generator). An added bonus is that the water will be
supplied under some presure so there is no need to elevate your tank to
7-8 feet. 


        Does anyone know if a standard hot water tank thermostat is
accurate enought or has the necessary range for this? Anyone think that
we're crazy and are looking for trouble?

Subject: Re : Simulating an English beer engine


Bob writes about adding a sparkler to the outlet of his kegging system to
achieve a creamy head. I get the same effect by using one of those
much-maligned plastic pressure barrels (Hambleton Bards's, FWIW). By trial and
error, I have found that the presence of an internal float system makes no
difference to performance, ie, the brew is still milky when served and clears
from the bottom up. Therefore, the most likely source of agitation is the
simple fact of opening the tap by a very small amount, combined with a
top pressure of up to 20 psi. I would imagine that this would be easy to
simulate in a kegging system without going to the trouble of building a
sparkler? 


Now here's one for the engineers: I would like to add a sparkler to my
_bottled_ beers. I have tried simply pouring these through a perforated valve,
but the dispense pressure doesn't seem to be great enough to cause a milky
brew. I am now thinking in terms of adding a foot pump device to force the beer
out from a vertically standing bottle. Look out Guinness, your patented draught
beer-in-a-can system is under threat!

Sure!  Despite reading that it is best to use FDA approved O2, I went
out and bought a tank of welding O2 (new).  My local Phd/lab friend
assured me that nothing would "live" in the high pressure O2 environment,
but since the cleanliness of the oxygen is an issue, I push the O2 
through a .2 micron filter, then through a silica airstone.  I just
got a scintered SS stone, so that will be tested next brew.  The O2 has
improved my ferments, especially the latest barleywine.  I use a 2 hour
(approx) bubble period, then disconnect (I start the O2 as soon as wort
is hitting the fermenter, and turn it off about 1.5-2 hours later).

I have found that the use of a Guinness slow pour tap (with flow rate 
adjustment) can be effective in simulating the cask ale carbonation.  It
works in much the same way as an engine, but using gas to push it through 
the sparkler head.  Unfortuneatly, I have heard that Rapids no longer sells
the adjustable model.  This technique has the same problem as Bob's, the 
pressure cannot be left on, or the beer will gain CO2.  Its probably easiest
to just keep it at the level desired, and turn it on to dispense, shutting
off the carb after your done for the night.

If you have good experience with this method, fine. But if you are tweaking
variables all of the time, like I often do, please take a hydrometer reading
to determine when to keg/bottle.  The 'ole bubbles per unit time can be 
quite misleading. Now, anyone know where to buy a professional hydrometer
for under $125??  The bummer is you need two, one for OG, and one for FG,
and yet another for "high OG".

Subject: Why Bavarian beer mugs have lids


The REAL reason why bavarian beer mugs have lids (pick one):
 
It keeps insects out of your beer.
 
It keeps your friends from wedging a kartoffelpuffer into the
opening of your mug while your not looking.
 
It pisses the French off.
 
People won't mistake your beer mug for a spitoon.
 
You can launch pretzels at the American tourists sitting at the
next table over.
 
For the same reason women wear swimsuits.
 
There aren't any pretzels floating in your beer after the polizei

Toilets have lids so what the heck.

Subject: Rnage hoods, chopsticks--too complicated


Hi,
        A quick suggestion on how to get all the extracty out of poly bags
(or cans for that matter).  Ladle a bit of the hot (recently boiled) water
into the bag and swish it around until the remaining extract has dissolved
in the water.  Dump the water into your brewpot.  If you're worried about
putting too hot water in the bag, you could even use a bit of hot tap water
and still not risk any infection since it's done before the boil.  The
range hood and chopstick methods seem too complicated for me, but what do I
know, I'm just a college student.

Subject: AHA judging form




All,
The AHA beer judging form starts off, after identification of the 
style and the judge, with the category "bottle inspection". There 
are no points awarded in this category, just comments. I have 
several questions, such as:


What is the purpose of this section? Recently I received comments in 
this section of "short fill" and "low fill line". I also received a 
"nice bottle" comment. I see that this inspection could be 
used to inspect for the ring that is supposed to be indicative of 
certain types of bacterial infection. I also understand that low 
fill *could* be indicative of potential oxidation, although oxygen 
absorbing bottle caps *may* negate potential oxidation risk from air 
in the bottle. However, if no points are awarded, what's it there 
for?


Do oxygen absorbing bottle caps negate the potential for in-bottle 
oxidation?


Does actual bottle condition, ie. scratched or sanded, have 
anything to do with judging the beer? 


TIA,


E-mail comments welcome

I think your two questions are related. The medicinal smell is most likely
caused by phenols which are produced as a byproduct of fermentation. Higher
temperatures tend to increase the level of phenol production. What is "too
high a temperature" depends on your yeast. For most ale yeasts it is
recommended that the fermentation temperature be below 70 deg. For higher
gravity beers (and mead) my feeling is that you need to stay in the lower
range of 55-60 deg because the large amount of alcohol produced increases
the chance of having phenols above the flavor threshold. Sometimes these
compounds do mellow and disappear with time but not usually in a month or
two. Fortunately your mead will last much longer than that. The only thing
I can suggest for a possible quick fix is to leave your mead in the
secondary until you want to drink it (still mead is just as nice as
sparkling) and agitate it frequently. Phenols are volitile so the levels
may reduce some over the next few months.

Subject: Just what's hiding in those draftflow cans...


Dear folks of the HBD:
        A coupl eof frineds of mine and I got bored one day and decided 
to find out just what makes those "draft-flow" cans work. Mind you, this
was in Reading, England a year ago, but I can't imagine that they've
changed since then. Anyway, we hacked off the top of a can-O-Murphy's and
discovered a two-piece setup of plastic. The top piece stretched from one
side of the can to the other, with round-ended arms to keep it from up-
ending and relaesing all the gas before the can is opened. The bottom
section slipped up into the top, and wasa sort of plug or mushroom-shaped
thing. We decided that openeing the can released the pressure sufficiently
for the bottom piece to slide out (down, that is) of the larger top piece
thereby shooting a dose of CO2 (or whatever they're using - could be 
anything, for all I know) through the beer overhead. This ensured that all
the beer got gassed, and pretty thoroughly. I didn't like it quite as much
as a regular draft pint, but our can wasn't quite as cold as they said
it should be on the label. It sounds as if these are  big hit - I may give
it another chance soon. It looked something like this:
Top:  _____        Side:  _____
     / / \ \          |     |

Subject: RIMS and HSA




I am planning on building a RIMS over Xmas and want to be clear
on the HSA danger(!?) involved with the system.  Has HSA been a
problem with you RIMS users?  I have read descriptions of foaming
and splashing at the output of the system, so it seems RIMS would
have an HSA problem.


What methods or tricks do people use to get the wort into the mash
tun from the RIMS output?  Morris recommends laying a perforated
1/8'' plastic tray on the grain and piping the wort on top of it.
Any better ideas?  Does anybody keep the wort level above the grain
bed and have the output pipe below the wort water line?


Thanks in advance,

One question I have is whether you racked to a secondary fermenter after 
the krausen fell, or did you ferment all in one vessel?  You may find 
that racking to secondary will eliminate some of the yeasty taste to your 
beer.  


Also, how long did you allow for conditioning?  You should allow a couple 
of weeks in the bottle before drinking, at least.  If you drank your beer 
sooner than that, there may not have been enough time for the yeast to 
settle out.  Check the bottom of your bottles for the familiar white 
yeast ring.

IMHO, you definitely bottled to early.  There may have been other 
factors, but be sure your specific gravity has leveled off before 
bottling next time.
This will help alot.  As far as your froth at the TOP of your bottled 
beer goes, it might be that heavy fermentation resumed after bottling, 
and the froth might be krausen.  Again, bottling at the right time might 
do the trick.

Specifically, to keep out air and flies.
Air (and heat) makes for flat beer, flies affect the protein level when they
fall in, destroying the careful balance of flavors. (ahem)
When you drink it a litre at a time, it can go warm on you quick. If you go
to a beer garden in Bavaria (or elsewhere) you'll often see people with the
drip mats over their glasses for the same reason. 


I remember seeing a guy in a bar pour 9/10 of his beer, then roll the bottle
sideways back and forth for 10 minutes to build a good head to pour on top.
Everybody has a system.

Subject: AOL, HBD and Censorship


I would like to take this opportunity to voice my support of Andrew Patrick
in his quest for a more open-minded approach toward "offensive behavior" on
America Online's Beer and Brewing Forum.
It seems like our civilization in general and computer forums specifically
are getting more and more thin-skinned.  Even in the HBD, which is probably
one of the better self-controlled forums I've seen, people are waiting to
bitch about signature lines, "offensive language", and almost anything Jack
Schmidling writes.  I *like* the fact that some people have the courage to
express themselves in a genuine manner, even if (ESPECIALLY IF) it takes on a
more earthy tone.  Do all of you people who run screaming from the words
"orgasm" or "pissed off" avoid such language in the outside world?  Do you
ever interact in a more casual manner with other people?
A fair number of HBD regulars wish to hold the Digest up to some sort of
"professional standard" which dictates that common language be banned and
that we all speak with more rarified language. Don't you think that this is
more than a little pretentious?  This is, after all, not a professional or
even an amateur publication, but a largely random forum in the format of a
huge ongoing conversation.
Perhaps I am far afield on this one, but when very few vocal or powerful
people have the ability to suppress or censor or in any way affect my freedom
to express myself as I see fit, that is clearly counter to the free exchange
of ideas and just plain wrong!  In the case of AOL vs. Andrew Patrick, we
have a person arbitrarily discarding posts because of some perceived
violation of the bylaws.  I do not feel that it is appropriate to hide under
the cover of "well, he signed up and agreed to the rules, so he got what he
deserved" .  These kinds of rules are infinitely more offensive to me than
any language could ever be and I have a real problem with dim-witted
do-gooders who see nothing wrong with what AOL is doing.
All I ask is that some of you stop and think.

Smelly Mead question:


I have recently tried to make my first mead.  I used 2.5 lb clover honey, 
small amount gypsum, yeast nutrient, irish moss.  Boiled in approx 0.5 gal.
water for 15 min and skimmed, ala TNCJHB. Topped off with water in 1 gallon
jug, pitched rehydrated wine yeast, capped with air lock.  Vigorous ferment 
by next evening, remained vigorous approx. 2 wks, now has slow ferment. 
Started Nov 21, so it's been 3 weeks total so far.  When I racked to the
secondary (`at` 2 wks) it smelled awful.  Kind of like dirty socks. I tasted a
little, also awful. Will this get better with age???  Is this just a byproduct
from the yeast ferment that will get scrubbed out by the CO2?  What have I done
wrong (if anything)??? 


I mentioned to a friend that I was making mead (foolishly, before I had racked
to the secondary), and he got me a gallon of honey from his Dad's hives. 
Mainly from Orange trees and basil(?), i.e. mixed flower. Now I'm in a bind,
because I'd like to make some mead for him to give to his Dad, but I don't want
to make a foul brew, and I don't want to wait a year to see if the mead I have
going will get better before I try another batch. 


Help!  Any suggestions, or recipes for Orange Blossom Honey based Meads would
be greatly appreciated. Melomel or Methaglyn recipes would be fine, too.  TIA.

This is my first attempt at Canadian style sparkling hard cider.
My problem/question is that after ~2 weeks in the primary
I racked to secondary and of course had to sample. It tasted like
a nice, very dry cider, but had an alcohol aftertaste. I'm wondering 
what might be the problem, or if the aftertaste will mellow during
secondary.


I started with a simple recipe posted in this digest several 
weeks ago:


4 gallons natural cider
add 4 crushed Campden tablets and let sit for 24 hrs
add 5 lbs clover honey diluted to 1 gallon w/ water (boiled 10 min)
add 2 pkgs dry Champagne yeast and yeast nutrient
ferment in primary at ~66F (Active for about 1 1/2 wks)
Rack to secondary.


I plan to leave it in the secondary for 1 week at about 58-60F,
re-rack, secondary 1 more week, prime w/ 3/4cup corn sugar boiled 
in 1pt water and bottle.


Any explanation for the alcohol aftertaste.
Thanks ahead for any help.

Phil Brushaber wants to get more maltiness in his beer.  Phil, the malts
you're talking about are wonderful and you shouldn't have any trouble
getting the desired results with them.  If you aren't getting it: try
lowering your hopping rate and, more importantly, start examining your
water supply.  The Munich water is directly responsible for bringing out
that effect; you should make adjustments to get the same water for your
brewing.  Seems to me that Noonan had some relevant data on this in his
Lager Beer book.  There is more elsewhere (Miller?).  


The importance of the right water cannot be overstated.

On the question of aluminium pots, I will confess to having mashed in an
aluminium pot now for nearly a year -- or maybe more, I forget...


Seriously, I don't know if I'm brain-damaged by this pot, but there have
been absolutely no, zero, none, bad affects on the flavor.  My beer, in
fact, is better than ever.


Of course, the kettle isn't as beautiful as my stainless steel 15-gallon
pot, nor my stainless steel keg/kettle, but the beer is fine.

Indeed, George!  pH is another important factor.  If you have high-carbonate
water, you may want to add a teaspoon of Gypsum to a gallon of water and
boil it for 5 minutes or so.  Then pour off the water away from the sediment
(Calcium Carbonate) and toss the sediment.  If you have low-carbonate water,
you don't have to do this, you can just warm the tapwater up to 160-170F.
Now, cool the water down to about 160 to 170F, crush the grain, put it in
a grain bag (much easier than trying to remove the grain with a strainer
later), tie off the bag and steep the grains in the 160-170F water for 15
to 30 minutes.  I used to heat the water from 50F with the grain bag in
the liquor, but last time I did this, the bag stuck to the bottom of the
kettle and I burnt a hole in it.  Drat!  I used to use the full 5 gallons
for steeping the grains, but that's not a good idea -- the pH will be way
too high (even with low-carbonate water) and thus you'll extract those
tannins even at 160F.  Also, as Don mentioned, this method is useful for
crystal and the dark malts like Chocolate, Roasted Barley and Black Malt
(aka Roasted Malt).  You would not want to do this with Pale, Pils, Biscuit,
Aromatic, Munich, etc. or flaked barley/oats/etc. since these need to be
mashed to convert their starches.

Subject: Fruit Extracts




Matthew Evans asks about HopTech Fruit Extracts back on December 8, so
I like to share some related information.  I have not used HopTech's
fruit extracts, but I have used a Blueberry Extract from the Beverage
People (Byron Burch and Nancy Vineyard's place in Santa Rosa).  I don't
know where they get it (or if they make it themselves), but the person I
talked to on the phone told me that it is exactly the same stuff that
Marin Brewing Company uses in its Blueberry Ale (can you say '93 Gold
Medal in Fruit Beer).  So it is possible to make good beer with it.
        To get good results I would recommend staying below 15 IBU's.
The person from Beverage People told me that Marin Brewing Co. uses some
wheat in their ale--but I ventured for the use of rice instead (to be
precise I used 4 lbs Alexander's pale LME, 1.5 lbs dry rice extract and
about 14 IBU's (can't remember the hops)--then add 4oz of fruit extract
at bottling).  I was very happy with this light, extremely drinkable,
blueberry concoction.  I will admit that the blueberry was not tremendously
strong (i.e. could have been a little stronger).  My best guess is that
by adding the fruit extract directly to the hot priming liquid, I may
have reduced the flavor and aroma of the blueberry extract.  So I
suggest adding the extract to cool beer before bottling/kegging.  But in
general, the beer was extememly well received--especially with my
friends who like the lighter beers.
        For heavier beers, I would guess that you might need
substantially more than 4 oz.  Good luck.    tom

Well, that may be the retail price but you can do much better.  I bought my 10
gallon stock pot mail order from Rapids Restaurant & Bar Supply for $125,
including lid and shipping. 


BTW, stainless steel is a poor conductor of heat and can develop hot spots that
will scorch the wort.  Better quality SS stock pots (Volrath) have aluminum
clad bottoms to help distribute the heat.


I can't recommend Rapids highly enough.  When they they sent me a Polarware
stock pot (no aluminum clad) instead of the advertised Volrath, they sent me
the proper item right away AND arranged and paid for the UPS pick up to
return the incorrect pot.  I have no connection with Rapids other than as
a satisfied customer.
