Subject: First batch success


Just a short note to say I tasted my first bottle from my first batch and
found it drinkable (actually, pretty good).


I was attempting to emulate a Newcastle Brown style, so I used M+F Nutty
Brown extract, and at the urging of the shop, added 2 Alexander's Malt
Kickers. The yeast was what came with the extract. 


Three weeks later, I have 50+ bottles of something that doesn't resemble
Newkie so much as Theakston's OP (in color: almost black, with a gleam of
ruby red when viewed against a light). It's quite malty and a lot stronger
than I expected (I figured 3%, based on TNCJOHB calculations). 


You guys are way over my head with a lot of your mashing and whole grain
stuff; I'll likely be an extract man for a while. To get in at this level
is so easy; if you can boil water and read, you're there!


If anyone else is lurking without brewing, get busy.

Subject: Specific Gravity Notes


I've noticed some postings that make me believe some clarification of the
measurement of specific gravity might be appreciated. One representative
example is...


The SG was 1.0XX "but that included all the particles from the crystal malt
that immediately settled to the bottom."


Undisolved particles (including colloids) do not affect the measurement of
specific gravity. A easy to visualize example is to imagine a lake of pure
water with a specific gravity of 1.000. What is the specific gravity of the
water if a boat is floating on the surface? What is the specific gravity if
the boat sinks? What is the specific gravity while the boat is sinking? It
remains 1.000.


The caveat is that anything that sticks to the side of your hydrometer
_will_ affect the specific gravity _measurement_ because it will change the
wieght of the hydrometer. When you pull the hydrometer out if there is
stuff sticking to the side you should let the junk settle and take the
measurement again. The most common thing to stick to the side is bubbles
which will add boyancy to the hydrometer and give you too high a specific
gravity measurement. It may go against your expectations but if you have a
lot of junk floating around that sticks to your hydrometer it actually
gives you too low a SG reading because it will make the hydrometer sink a
little further.


Of course for those that are inclined to excessive worry I should point out
that I brewed for six years before even doing a temperature correction for
SG!

Subject: extract editorials / good enough


          In Papazian's book he says that all malt extracts are not
          created equal and in the recipie section he recomments
          cerain extracts for certain recipies because of their unique
          characteristics.  But I have never seen much in the way of
          specific recommendations (for or against) various malt
          extracts.  So here is your invitation to editorialize.  When
          I go to the beer store and see oodles of different malts,
          which should I try first?  Which should I avoid?  I just
          started my garage lager last night with Bierkeller amber.
          What can I expect? (the label says "preimium german malt",
          but with truth in advertising being what it is ...?).  As
          always responses should use appropriate Intenetiquitte.


          In respons to Tim sixberry's comments/question of yesterday:


          "...the basics of making good beer are very simple ... why
          complicate matters?"


          I second the motion.


          Of course "advanced" beer makers are free to make things as
          complicated as they want.  But I agree that many people get
          forget that others have a different agenda.  We read "relax,
          don't worry, have a homebrew" and then get pages and pages
          and kilobites and kilobites of things to worry about.  I
          suspect that there is a lot of home brew equipment around
          gathering dust in the basements of people who were turned
          off by unnecessary complications.  (IMHO).

Subject: Re: cloying sweetness


Taylor Standee asks about a cloying sweetness and flattish beer after 2
weeks in the bottle:


It sounds to me like the beer just needs more time.  I have often had
batches that were too sweet & flat after only two weeks.  Some of the
factors seem to be:
   1. Temperature where the bottles are sitting &
   2. How much the beer cleared before bottling.  Usually, the more it
      has cleared, the longer it takes (and the less sediment in the
      bottle which means less sediment/more beer in my glass!).
I've never used DME but I hear that DME tends to take longer than corn
sugar.  So, give it a couple of more weeks and it should be fine.

I don't think dry hopping will do much for you in terms of bitterness.  It 
will give you hop nose and flavor.  I used 1 oz. of Cascade hop plugs to dry 
hop 5 gallons of an IPA recently.  I liked it and so did my friends.  The 
flavor of the hops really came through.  I've read recipes where more (as much
as 5 oz. of a hop) or less (0.5 oz.) have been used.

THis is one of my pet peeves too.  I think the inspection is fine for 
rings, yeast cake/cloudiness, etc, but comments on "low fill levels"
can be erroneous.  The problem seems to stem from homebrewers who bottle
condition being sensitive to fill levels, and thinking the "correct" fill
level is within 1/2" of the crown.  When I am competing, I usually fill
from the keg, counterpressure, and acheive a fill level very close to 
what you find in a quality micro, 1.5 - 2" below the crown.  This 
invariably begets a comment on "low fill".  If the local micro fills 
bottles above this line, they can have legal action brought against 
them for selling more than 12 oz in a 12 oz bottle.

This contradicts the data I have.  Experiments have shown that the maximum
(absolute saturation levels) vary between a low of 4 mg/L (SG = 1.080, T=
30 C) and a high of 7.5 mg/L (SG=1.030, T=15C).  I believe Rajotte has 
quoted much higher numbers, but these are not supported by experimentation
using a Zahm and Nagel O2 inline injector.  These data are supported by 
another author, Dr. Ingledew, who found levels of 8-9 mg/L as the maximum.
It is certainly well known that the saturation levels of O2 are a function
of temperature and sugar density (OG) so these are important factors in
the equation, but practically speaking, levels above 8 mg/L are not seen
in breweries, nor are they required as typical brewers strains require 
O2 levels between 2-8 mg/L.  It is also interesting to note that yeast
will respire the O2 in a matter of hours if not less, at these levels.
I can assure you that a 2 hour bubble of O2 has lead to quite healthy and
successfull ferments (quicker, and cleaner, less esters/fusels).

Subject: New Brewer...HELP cont.


Sorry, little computer glitch on my end....So to start again.... I am new
to the homebrew scene (two weeks, three batches, lots of fun) and have a few
questions that I hope some more experienced brewers can answer.  My first 
batch was a basic Yorkshire Bitter Kit with a lb of dry malt replacing some
of the sugar.  It all went smoothly and was bottled about a week ago.  The 
second batch is my own Olde Ale recipe using all malt (11 lbs), some grain
(crystal and choc.) and a lot of hops.  This batch started with an SG of 
1.062, was extremely active in about 8 hours, blew CO2 like crazy for the next 
20 hours and had the krause (?) settle aftert 2 1/2 days.  I then racked it 
into the secondary at which point it slowly bubbled away.  Well, five days 
later it is still bubbling at a rate of about every 3 seconds which is 
completely different than batch 1 and batch 3 (an Australian Lager using
Ale yeast).  Is this normal activity or have I done something wrong?  Is it 
due to using so much malt ext.?  Is it safe to bottle while it is still 
fermenting like this?  Is there any good way to get a second SG reading 
without the risk of contaminating the brew?  I would really like to get this
batch into the bottle so I can expedite the drinking (hopefully be able to 
have a few with friends on New Years!!!)


Other questions:  Are Australian Light Malts supposed to produce a golden
colored beer/ale/lager (this is the color of straw)?  Could someone send me
a recipe for Cider as I have seen this in my first reading of the digest and
think it sounds great?  How close will a dopplebock be to the real thing if I
use ale/beer yeast (I am not yet sett up to do real Lagers)?


The list is great.  I am sure already it will answer many of my questions and
give me the insights I am looking for.  Thanks for the help in advance!!!

The bicycle pump method does work well, but unless you plan to empty
the entire Cornelius keg in one go, don't use this method. It would
corrupt the protective CO2 in the headspace of the keg, oxidizing and
ruining the beer after a day or two. 


I have the same situation, I have two Cornelius kegs, and an assortment
of hoses and connectors, but living in France, I do not have convenient
access to compatible CO2 tank and regulator systems. Instead, I devised
the following simple two-keg closed system which preserves the natural CO2 
gas generated by the fermentation and uses it as a pressure source. Since
the system is closed and the beer is protected by pure CO2, it can be
kept fresh and carbonated indefinitely.


Parts:        2 Cornelius kegs
        4 Cornelius connectors
          Some sort of valve for dispensing (I found a 3/8" air valve at
                a hardware store, which works nicely)   
        ~10' 3/8" food grade clear plastic hose
        a 3/8" water faucet adapter w/ clamp


1. One Cornelius keg will serve as the beer-keg. The second will serve as a
CO2 resevoir. Cut a length of hose long enough to run between the the
two kegs and put Cornelius connectors on both ends. Connect the "INPUT"
side of the beer-keg to the "OUTPUT" side of the CO2 resevoir. When your
beer is fermented and ready to prime, siphon it into the beer-keg and
prime it with triple your normal quantity of priming sugar (I use about
6 cups of malt extract per 5 gals). Fill the CO2 resevoir with enough
alcohol based sterilizing solution to cover the bottom half inch of the
"OUTPUT" pipe (don't use other sterilant: there is a minimal risk that it 
could be sucked up into the beer keg if the temperature of the beer keg
drops).

  beer keg          CO2 resevoir




2. Leave the clamp of the CO2 resevoir loosely open for about 1/2 a
day to allow CO2 from the beer keg to purge the CO2 resevoir keg of air.


3. Clamp shut the CO2 resevoir and allow 1-2 weeks for "conditioning".


4. After beer is conditioned and CO2 resevoir is pressurized, switch the
"polarity" of the hose connection on the CO2 resevoir, so that the hose
is connected to the "INPUT" side of the CO2 resevoir. Construct a beer
dispenser hose out of 3'-5' of hose, one Cornelius connector and the beer
dispensing valve. Connect this to the "OUTPUT" side of the beer keg and 
test by dispensing some beer into a glass. If necessary, release pressure 
slightly from the CO2 resevoir using the pressure bleeder valve on the
top of the Cornelius keg.


5. To increase the CO2 pressure at any time, construct a second length of
hose with a Cornelius connector at one end and a water faucet connector at
the other. Connect the water faucet end first, then connect the other end
to the "OUTPUT" side of the CO2 resevoir, and force a few pints of water 
into the CO2 resevoir (more than the volume of the beer that was consumed).
This should definitely be done when you want to store the beer after having
tapped off a few pints, in order to maintain the carbonation in the beer.

Disadvantages:
        1. Finding the optimum dispensing pressure is a bit trial & error
        at first with pressure bleeder.
        2. Ties up two Cornelius kegs for one 5 gallon batch.


It isn't elegant, but hey, it's cheap and it works!

Subject: Comments on Several Items


Hey Group, Happy Holidays!
I have been trying lots of different commercial beers, lots of Winter Warmer
types, to gain experience with different styles. I have discovered that 
I don't care for Pumpkin Ale; I can't finish a Spiced Christmas Ale 
(tho I did find out that the Christmas Ale I brewed turned out true to style)
its just too weird; but I did like the Samual Smiths and Young's Winter 
Warmers very much. So, I think this style and IPA will be my styles for the 
new years brewing.


Okay, More James Questions (why do I like ribbing this guy? I dunno:)
Why Wort Chillers?  Because when you start doing full boils, 5->10 gallons, 
that is too much wort to carry to the bathtub.
Short Ale Fermentations?  When you use Extract with lots of active yeast,
then you can have quick fermentations because of the simple sugars present;
compared to All Grain where more complex sugars are present.
How much to Dry Hop?  A good rule of thumb for ANY hop addition is 1 ounce.
YMMV. Also, Cascade hops has a Vibrant nose.


Capping Champagne bottles - All of the domestic champagne bottles can be
recapped with standard bottle caps. There are some French ones that have
bigger openings.


I want a copy of that Shrimp Creole recipe!


A few days ago, someone mentioned that their Bottles had a Milky Layer around
the top of the bottle and thought it might be more foam. From what I have been
told this is Micro Derm, a bad bacterial infection. It is ground dwelling but
can be stirred up into the air by kicking up dust, etc.  It is dangerous but
easily detected due to the milky layer at the top and horrid smell when
opening.


And on Jordans Hops Addition based on Papazian's formulas:
Well I assumed you are making five gallons. Starting with 6 lbs of Pale Malt
Extract (Syrup? DME? =>Syrup), yielding an approximate OG of 1.032. Boiled in
1.5 gallons of water gives an Adjusted Gravity of 1.28. Putting this in my
spreadsheet ala Rager, using 1.5 ounces for 45 minutes gives 21.95 or 22 IBU.
Which seems to be what you wanted. HBU equaling %AA x Wt. = 1.5x5.5 = 8.25


And finally, my opinion on HBD diction and grammar.
I prefer to read concise questions and answers. I can appreciate certain
regular personalities on the Digest who write like they probably speak; it
does add a certain amount of color to the digest and makes it more of a
gathering of friends to discuss a shared hobby. However, writing like you 
speak is regarded as poor practice when trying to effectivly communicate.
Imagine if I started writing in Surfer speak, or my semi-native West Virginian
drawl, it would be very tiresome for many of you to read. The same can be said
of expletives and colloquialisms. This is an open forum for the communication 
of ideas on homebrewing. Effective communication would seem to be in order.

Last weekend I got my long-awaited chance to try Sierra-Nevada
Pale Ale (We took a trip into Washington). Needless to say, I was
NOT disappointed. Wow! Hops with an attitude. Can a brew get any
better than this? My only mistake was to promise to save a bottle
for my wife :)
 
Does anyone have a recipe to emulate this wonderful brew? If not,
what is the variety and method of hopping? I suspect it is dry-hopped,
which is something I've been meaning to try.
 
If numerous recipes are mailed, I will summarize for the digest.

Subject: Rager's polynomial


The recent thread about hop utilization and Rager's utilization numbers
from Zymurgy past, and Ed Hitchcock's request for a polynomial got me
thinking. Although this is not what Ed was requesting, I ran a least
squares fit on the center points of Rager's utilization ranges and derived
the coefficients of a cubic polynomial.  When plotted against Rager's
ranges this polynomial is everywhere "between the lines" except for less
than about 3 minutes (where it's fairly flat at about 5.5%) and at greater
than 55 minutes (where it tops out at about 30.3%).  So, keeping in mind
the standard disclaimers and the fact that your results may vary, here it is:


u(t)=5.738336 - (2.032614e-01)*t + (2.905735e-02)*t^2 -(3.140576e-04)*t^3


or with less than anal precision:


u(t) = 5.738336 - 0.203261*t + 0.029057*t^2 - 0.000314*t^3


Note that this yields percent values, for fractional quantities divide by
100.0. 


For those for who Rager's numbers do not come trippingly off the tongue,
they are:


Minutes  % Util
- -------  ------
 0-5        5.0
 6-10       6.0
11-15       8.0
16-20      10.1
21-25      12.1
26-30      15.3
31-35      18.8
36-40      22.8
41-45      26.9
46-50      28.1
51-60      30.0   Note the double size bin


If one examines a plot of Rager's ranges there appears to be a discontinuity
at 41-45 minutes in an otherwise smooth curve.  My esthetic sense from 
the plot is that utilization tops out at about 33-34% at 60 minutes.  


One observation is that at time=0 I would expect a 0% utilization. 
Plotting the center points of Rager's numbers and extrapolating gives
something around 4%.  By "playing" with Rager's numbers I generated a more
"esthetically pleasing" curve.  I threw out Rager's numbers for 0-20
minutes and substituted 0% at 0 minutes.  I also tossed out his numbers
above 45 minutes and added 3 of my own at 48, 53, and 58 minutes. The
curve so generated agrees extremely well with Rager over the range, 23-43
minutes, but yields higher utilization values at times over 46 minutes,
and lower utilization values at times under 22 minutes.

After all this, a question springs to even my mind, "So what?"  Are there
any other hop utilization numbers besides Rager's out there?  How about 
in Malting and Brewing Science?  Help! I need a reality check.


You know, I can get carried away on the weirdest things.

Subject: hops question revisited




Thanks to Spencer Thomas for pointing out my misuse of the formulas I asked
about in HBD 1300.  Obviously (now, at least) by using my method it doen't
matter what the %utilization is, the formulas will always give you the same
weight of hops to use.  This must be why I went into Biology and not 
Mathmatics.  Anyway, my questions still remains.  


Given that I know the ~%utilization, the final volume of my batch, and the
approximate HBUs I want for my beer, how can I calculate the amount of hops
to use?


Again, I apologize if this has been answered recently, but from what I've
read the formula I'm looking for just isn't jumping out at me.


Thanks,

 I disagree, as outlined below.  A more appropriate statement would be
`inappropriately scaling down commercial equipment to homebrew sized
batches, without understanding the function of the dimensions, sometimes
does not work very well'.
 
 js:
 > 3/32" holes are probably too large for the geometry of a homebrew tun.


 Hersh:

If the example was truly `classic', would you have difficulty
explaining why?
 
 js:
 >My only argument was that if 3/32" holes work in large tuns but 
 >not in a small one, it must have something to do with geometry.
 
The switch from the plural to the singular is at odds with the
generality you made two days ago, and therefore cannot be `your only
argument'.  


  js:
 >The larger holes only 
 >work well with a large depth to diameter ratio but smaller holes would be 
 >more forgiving.  I am not sure why one would want larger holes and thereby 
 >put such constraints on the aspect ratio but therein at least, seems to be 
 >the answer.


It seems to me that the `answer' depends on whether the sieve or the
grain husks do the filtering.  If the husks do the filtering, as you
have advocated in the past, then with an appropriate grain depth, the
size of the holes, within limits, is not too important.  I would say that 
in a false bottom tun, a grain bed depth which is appropriate for a given 
size hole/porosity is a better geometry characteristic than aspect ratio.  




 js:
 >For the record, the screen I use on the EM has 32 mesh screen and taking the 
 >wire diameter into consideration, the hole size is roughly ten times smaller 
 >than the "professional" size.
 
TNCJOHB advocates 1/8" holes on the ZapPap tun, which is 25% bigger than
"professoinal" size.  It works just fine for a large number of people.


For Dennis Lewis - the origional poster:


I realize that the Brewer's Warehouse sheets are expensive!  I wouldn't
want to throw it out (If you do, or you have unused scraps, write me).  The 
keg is probably too big to lauter in because the bed depth is small.  You 
could cut down the screen and make a better false bottom tun, or convert
to the em.  There is a way to use the screen you cut in a converted keg 
boiler, so it won't be wasted.  


 
 >Broken records tend to annoy people and my mission is to share what I have 
 >learned with others and learn what they have learned from them.
 
I advocate neither false bottoms or ems, and have yet to design a dream
tun.  (hope you share the final result and thought processes, Norm).  
If there is anything I've learned from this digest, its that there are
many equally effective ways of doing all the process in brewing.  To say
that "[false bottoms] are simply not ... useful in homebrew lauter tuns"
is irresponsible, and simply false.

The bicycle pump method does work well, but unless you plan to empty
the entire Cornelius keg in one go, don't use this method. It would
corrupt the protective CO2 in the headspace of the keg, oxidizing and
ruining the beer after a day or two. 


I have the same situation, I have two Cornelius kegs, and an assortment
of hoses and connectors, but living in France, I do not have convenient
access to compatible CO2 tank and regulator systems. Instead, I devised
the following simple two-keg closed system which preserves the natural CO2 
gas generated by the fermentation and uses it as a pressure source. Since
the system is closed and the beer is protected by pure CO2, it can be
kept fresh and carbonated indefinitely.


Parts:        2 Cornelius kegs
        4 Cornelius connectors
          Some sort of valve for dispensing (I found a 3/8" air valve at
                a hardware store, which works nicely)   
        ~10' 3/8" food grade clear plastic hose
        a 3/8" water faucet adapter w/ clamp


1. One Cornelius keg will serve as the beer-keg. The second will serve as a
CO2 reservoir. Cut a length of hose long enough to run between the the
two kegs and put Cornelius connectors on both ends. Connect the "INPUT"
side of the beer-keg to the "OUTPUT" side of the CO2 reservoir. When your
beer is fermented and ready to prime, siphon it into the beer-keg and
prime it with triple your normal quantity of priming sugar (I use about
6 cups of malt extract per 5 gals). Fill the CO2 reservoir with enough
alcohol based sterilizing solution to cover the bottom half inch of the
"OUTPUT" pipe (don't use other sterilant: there is a minimal risk that it 
could be sucked up into the beer keg if the temperature of the beer keg
drops).

2. Leave the clamp of the CO2 reservoir loosely open for about 1/2 a
day to allow CO2 from the beer keg to purge the CO2 reservoir keg of air.


3. Clamp shut the CO2 reservoir and allow 1-2 weeks for "conditioning".


4. After beer is conditioned and CO2 reservoir is pressurized, switch the
"polarity" of the hose connection on the CO2 reservoir, so that the hose
is connected to the "INPUT" side of the CO2 reservoir. Construct a beer
dispenser hose out of 3'-5' of hose, one Cornelius connector and the beer
dispensing valve. Connect this to the "OUTPUT" side of the beer keg and 
test by dispensing some beer into a glass. If necessary, release pressure 
slightly from the CO2 reservoir using the pressure bleeder valve on the
top of the Cornelius keg.


5. To increase the CO2 pressure at any time, construct a second length of
hose with a Cornelius connector at one end and a water faucet connector at
the other. Connect the water faucet end first, then connect the other end
to the "OUTPUT" side of the CO2 reservoir, and force a few pints of water 
into the CO2 reservoir (more than the volume of the beer that was consumed).
This should definitely be done when you want to store the beer after having
tapped off a few pints, in order to maintain the carbonation in the beer.

Advantages:
        1. It's cheap!
        2. Closed system: beer stays preserved indefinitely
        3. Naturally conditioned in the traditional English manner


Disadvantages:
        1. Finding the optimum dispensing pressure is a bit trial & error
        at first with pressure bleeder.
        2. Ties up two Cornelius kegs for one 5 gallon batch.


It isn't elegant, but hey, it's cheap and it works!

Spencer Thomas imagines that I'm presenting him my beer to judge out 
of "pride".  Actually, I'm presenting it for feedback about the contents
of the bottle.  I already know if I had to scramble to scrape labels off
the bottles because of the available beers the cleaner bottles happen to
have already been consumed.  I already know how flippin' painful it was
to scrape my fingers as well as the label because I'm cleaning three
bottles for each of the eight beers I'm entering.  I already know, fer
chrissake, that the clean bottle rules exist to prevent unfair identifting
marks from biasing the judges, and not to soothe their aesthetic sensibilities.
What I DON'T know is how true my beer is to style, and that's what I paid
the entry fee to find out.


There's nothing that pisses me off more than getting more comments on a
judging sheet about the state of the bottles than the state of the beer.

Subject: First batch question...not much carbonation?




Yes...it's another novice first batch question...


Here's the story: Brewed, fermented, and siphoned into bottling
bucket.  Before siphoning I boiled a pint of water with the 
bottling sugar and put that in the bottom of the bucket.  The instructions
didn't say anything about stirring...so I didn't.  After bottling
all of the beer from the spigot at the bottom of the bucket..
I noticed that there appeared to be a separation in the last little
beer in the bottom...beer on top, sugar mixture on the bottom.


So, it's been 5 days, and I tried a bottle that came from near the end of
the bucket.  There was a little pssst when I opened the bottle, but
very little carbonation.  I understand it is a little early to expect 
a lot, but is it possible that I screwed up by not mixing the sugar mix
in the bottle bucket?  Is there anyway to test the potential outcome
without waiting?  any insight would be great..
