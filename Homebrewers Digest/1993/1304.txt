The "junk" in question is protein coagulate.  When mixed into a solution,
it does not raise the SG as would sugar.  This would seem to imply that it
has a lower SG than wort.  Yet it falls to the bottom.  Why?

increase after the trub falls out (i.e. the wort mixed with trub has a

decrease. **


i.e. why doeshit sink?


** One cannot discount the possiblitly that this is due to temperature
correction error or other measurement errors on my part.  I have never,
however, observed a SG decrease after clarification, and have obseved
increases several times.

Thanks for all of the requests for mac/brew clip art.


I cannot possibly reply to all of you in any semblance of

I am going to create a clip art package and post it to

liberal: send me a bottle of homebrew AND give me a
mention regarding your label artwork. Sounds
reasonable.

Good Luck trying to boycott A.B. (BUD) products! I think you would have a
more easier time trying to boycott water! :)


Since "nearly one out of two beers is an A.B. product" (a direct quote from
the St. Louis beer tour, since they sold 86 million [more or less] barrels in
a year) a "strong" boycott would probably "hurt" their sales by .001%.


Just had to add my $.02 since I feel you are wasting your time. Sorta like
when teenagers were supposed to "boycott" the Beatles and destroy any kind of
"things" they had relating to the Beatles. It was silly. (If you aren't in your
30's or later you probably don't remember)

John, I have the very same problems (great pale/amber beers, lousy dark beers),
although I haven't brewed as many batches as you.  I suspect your guess about
water chemistry is correct, and I am in process of investigating my water
chemistry (request sent out yesterday to the city utilities).  It looks like
I'm going to have to quit ignoring the ingredient which makes up 99.9% of the
beer - the water!  Time to crack the books, but in the meantime, any HBD gems
would be appreciated.  Oh, I would describe my dark beer attempts as
astringent, murky, thin, not malty at all.

Recently I had a chance to try a Weissbeir at Berghoff's in 
Chicago, and loved it!  Since then, I've had every other
variety that I can get my hands on.  Now I'd like to try to make
one.  From what I can tell, one of the critical components is the
specific strain of yeast, yet I have not been able to locate
one that would be appropriate (or at least good), nor have I 
found a reliable recipe.  If anyone has any experience in
this area, a recipe to share, and yeast info, I'd appreciate
either a posting here, or directly to me at jld3`at`po.cwru.edu


Second, those of us fortunate enough to live near Great Lakes
Brewery here in Cleveland have been thrilled once again at
their Porter, IPA, and Christmas Ale.  I bought a twelve
of the Christmas Ale for my brother (who regularly attends
the Portland Ore. beer festivals): he's going to have to 
settle for a six.

I had read some comments on fruit extracts and was interested in trying
a raspberry and blueberry for myself.  I called Hoptech and placed an order
for 1 each.  Total weight for this order < 1lb.  Being somewhat familiar
with shipping costs, I asked for UPS BLUE (second day).  When I received
the package I was billed $9.75 in shipping and handling on a $12 product
order!  I called the company and was told that a $4 "handling" fee was
charged to me since my order was < $30.  This is something that folks
should know!  The extracts taste fine, but Hoptech's rediculous S&H fees
left a bitter taste in my mouth...

Subject:      Raw honey vs processed


Bob Surratt queries about the difference between raw and processed
honey.  The main difference is that processed honey has been heated,
and filtered.  Heating makes the honey less viscous/more fluid so it
will pump through hoses and pass through filters easier.  The filters
(usually fine cheese cloth) remove the foreign material (dust,
pollen, bee's wax, spare bee parts) from the honey.  Heating also drives
off volatile enzymes from the honey, which may change the flavor.
Commercial honey may also be a blended of different varieties of honey.


Raw honey is simply honey that has not been processed.  When I extract
and bottle my honey, I use cheese cloth to filter out foreign matter,
but no heat is involved (preserving the volatile enzymes) and I
make attempts to keep clover honey separate from aster honey, etc.
For true Raw Honey, find a local beekeeper.

        Note that the extraction rate for mash ingredients are a 
theoretical maximum, not the expected rate.  Thus, a good homebrew setup 
typically gets 80% of theoretical maximum, or about 30 pts/lb/gal using 
pale ale or lager malt.  The extract efficiency of 6 row is about 20% less 
than 2 row.


        With that I bid ye all a happy Holiday season, I'm unsubscribing 
for the duration of 1993...

Subject: SS Mash/Lauter Tun


Item Subject: d:\beer\mashlaut.txt




I am in the process of installing an "easy-masher" type of set up to eliminate
the screen for my SS keg lauter tun so I can scrape the bottom when raising the
temp. My heat source is from the bottom and I do step mashing.  The nipple
welded in t he bottom of my keg is 1/2" dia. and I installed fittings to have a
1" copper tube with a cap come across the bottom about 1" from the bottom.  This
tube will be slott ed and serve as my filter mechanism.


Anybody tried this?  Any suggestions on improvement?  I plan on doing a test
batch in a couple of weeks with this.


The reason for not using a rolled up screen is the durability of it when I am
mixing the grain during mashing. Also, the $$.  I can easily bump the slotted
tube with out knocking it off and I can get the grain moving under it easily to
min. temp. inconsistancies.


I want to keep the expense to a minimum and still have good brew.  The copper
tube and brass fittings were nominal at $12.


My current SS keg lauter tun is like this..of course not to scale....

Subject: Rager's hop utilization curve


I must preface this by saying this is not a flame %)!  I was quite amused by
a recent post  trying to fit Rager's hop utilization rates to a second or third
order polynomial expression.          I enjoy seeing you techies spin the numbers
almost as much as reading posts from Jack Schmidling!! But be real!! The hop
utilization rates are ranges over 5 min intervals.  If you plot the midpoint
of the ranges versus utilization and even add 0 for 0 time, you get just as
good a plot with a linear fit r^2=0.99 for y=0.576x (where y is the % util.,
and x is time) then you do with second a third order polynomials (r^2=0.98).
We cannot be very accurate with hop utiliz. rates to several decimal places 
since the alpha acid levels are only approximate.  It might be fun but it
is only an exercise in curve fitting.  (By the way you can't just drop 
data points because they don't give the correct esthetic look!  So 
for all practical purposes y=0.6x would be accurate enough.  Sorry for
rambling on, by I'm in the government and here to help you!

Subject: storing lagers in bottles


A rather obvious question, but one seemingly not answered by Papazian:


once you've bottled a lager (eg, a nice dark single bock), how you should
store the bottles? Is it useful to keep them at temps below 60F? Is it better
to keep them colder but constant (eg in a fridge), or not quite as cold but
varying with the weather (eg on a porch)? And as long as I've got you all
here, what is the possible off flavor damage to a lager sitting primary and
secondary for about 4 1/2 weeks total? (Discounting contamination; I'm just
wondering about the thick layer of trub at the bottom, which may or may not
be bad, seeing as how it's naturally a bottom fermenter). 


Don't try honey in an IPA. Well, you can, but the sweetness confuses a little
bit with all those hops. I think it will mellow with time, but I think there
are better recipes to include honey in than an IPA.


Happy beeridays,

Subject: Questions on: Hop storage and Step Infusion


Hello,


Question 1) I store my hops (pellets) in the freezer.  They are not in oxygen
barrier bags, but in little heat sealed plastic bags.  Would it help presserve
them if I put them (still in the bags) into a glass jar and filled the
jar with CO2, and then closed the jar and put it in the fridge.


Obviously it's not much work to do it, but will it be worth it? I know pellets
are pretty stable already.


Question 2) In reading Miller's, Lines, and Papazians books the only one who
addresses step infusion mashing by using a picnic cooler is Papazian.
Does anybody out there use a step infusion in a cooler?


Papazian gives the following numbers (working from memory here)
  For 1 step infusion - Add 1 qt 165 H20 per 1lb grain  (Target 155F)
  For step infusion   - Add 1 qt 128 H2O per 1lb grain  (Target 122F)
                        Add .5 qt 212 H2O per 1lb grain (Target 155F)


I have also found that the .5 qt he purposes does not get me
to 155, but more like 145 I was afraid to add more boiling H2O(making it even
thinner) so I did a partial decoction(more work than I wanted).


What are the consequences of the mash being so much thinner (than his
1 step infussion, it's 50% thinner) during the final step????
Should I use less H2O in the first step and use it in the second?
Should I just add as much boiling water as needed to get to 155?
Does anybody do a step in a cooler, if so what numbers do you do(temps
and volumes per lb)?


I am to lazy to stove top mash, and I don't want to build an insulated box,
so please limit answers to what I should do for cooler mashing.


The reason I am doing a protein rest is I was under the impression I needed
to with 2 Row Breiss (Klages that is Harrington) to prevent chill haze and
to get some needed yeast nutrients. Is that the case.


Thanks for the replies

Subject: raw honey


I think the diff betwene raw and processed honey is mostly filtration. Raw
honey has lots of bee parts in it (legs, stingers, other private bee
substances we're not to mention on HBD), and filtration takes some of that
out. I don't suppose it will make a serious diff since you should be heating
the honey before you add it, but why have more bits of stuff in your beer?
Papazian suggests filtered clover honey works best.

Subject: Copper bottom Stainless Steel brewpots


I was out doing some Christmas shopping yesterday, and just happen to have
looked at some nice heavy Revere stainless stockpots that had copper bottoms... 
Too bad they didn't have any 32 quart size.  The 20 quart were $60 without lids.


In any event, has anybody tried electroplating the bottom of a stainless pot to
apply a copper cladding?  Are the metals compatible etc???  I do know that that
a bath of copper sulphate, a copper anode and a battery charger will let you
plate steel (nails etc) but when you get into stainless (chrome/nickel?) will it
will it still work?

kegged/brewed batch, I wanted to blame something in an
individual batch process or ingredient. But it could also
be that some of my kegs have a bacterial/contamination problem
while others do not.
        Let me say that I clean every keg before reuse and that
I sanitize them by filling them with an Idophor solution for about
20 minutes before re-kegging. I even push in the little stopper at
the top of the fill tube to release air and get solution up the
tube.
        But I'll admit I have never ripped these kegs appart and
pulled the little liquid and gas knobs appart. I was thinking of cleaning
them in either an idophor or bleach solution. I know that bleach does
bad things to stainless, but I would only soak them for about 20 minutes
and then rinse.
        If I am on the right track, I'd appreciate hearing if someone
else might have solved this problem and what kind of off-tastes 
they were getting. The off taste is had to describe, but it is definately
not like Coke or Sprite. I did change the large O ring, but obviously
not the little ones inside the liquid/gas connectors.
        Gotta get a handle on this problem. I refuse to drink/serve bad
beer. I hate to go back to bottling (where I have had no problems with
off tastes on any batches and essentially used similar
ingredients/process). 
        Thanks in advance for your insight.

Can someone please tell me what carastan malt. I have not
seen it in the HBshop I frequent but have seen it
mentioned here and in recipies.   Also, some recipies call
out light and dark crystal.   What is the color guideline

Subject: yeast washing, Briess malt extract


   I am a novice extract brewer (2 batches so far) and would like any input on 
   the following items:
   
   1. Yeast washing - I have read the yeast FAQ and the section on yeast 
   washing seems pretty self-explanatory, but I would like some clarification 
   from anyone out there who is using this technique. I just racked a 5 gal. 
   batch from my priamry fermenter and had a pretty good layer of yeast (I 
   think...) on the bottom. It was the same whitish layer the settles to the 
   bottom of my bottles. The Yeast FAQ says to add sterile water to the 
   fermenter, and swirl it around to loosen everything. Then to dump this into 
   the first sterile 1 qt. mason jar.  After this step it says to agitate the 
   mason jar and wait for the mixture to separate into layers. After racking, 
   my fermentor did not seem to have much more there other than the yeast (not 
   much hops or sediment from the malt)
   
   I guess my exact question is... "Will it be pretty obvious which is yeast 
   and which is sediment?" Also, assuming reasonable precautions are taken in 
   sterilizing the mason jars and water, how high is the risk of infecting the 
   yeast in the process.
   
   The process of yeast washing appeals to me not just for the savings, but 
   also for the idea of having a ready supply of yeast handy that I am happy 
   with. I am also interested in eventually culturing yeast. Any opinions on 
   this? Is it worth the effort? It seems like it is considerably more involved.
   
   2. Briess malt extracts - I recently went in on a 60 lb. pail of Briess malt 
   extract. The price was a significant savings over buying it 6  or 7 lbs. at 
   a time. An issue of Zymurgy had an article on extract brewing and it 
   favorably mentioned Briess. Does any one have any experience using this 
   extract in bulk. I'm not sure exactly how I'll deal with measuring it out 
   considering how gooey malt extract is in general. Any advice in this area 
   will be appreciated.
   
   (I do intended to make the leap to all-grain when I can afford the equipment 
   and I feel I am ready for the process. Is there anything like an all-grain 
   FAQ out there on the internet?)
   
   thanks,

As a beekeeper who uses his own honey in various homebrews, I can tell you that 
there is little difference between raw and processed honey.


Any raw honey that I bottle and sell has to be between 15-18% water (or else it 
could spoil and ferment). Processed honey (the kind you might buy in a large 
grocery store), has been pasturized, filtered, and blended to appeal to the 
tastes of the American consumer. For your information, most of the processed 
honey sold in the United States is now imported from South America.


Since raw honey has not been pasturized, it is possible that you could 
introduce some bacterial "nasties" to the wort, but I'm sure these would be 
eliminated during the boiling process. As far as sugar content, it is variable 
in raw honey, but I don't think it makes much difference. 


When using honey in any recipe I am more concerned with the flavor of the honey 
(lightness vs. darkness) than with the water content. I have found that the 
source/flavor of the honey does sometimes affect the taste of the brew.

If it works for you, then great.  I used to use an ice bath, but it did

some.

"Optimal" is an odd word selection.  The yeast will decide what's optimal
for them.  This time is dependent on strain, temperature, oxygen, starter
size and original gravity.  You can minimize the time by aerating well
and using a big starter.  Higher temps will increase ester production (fruity
flavors/aromas) in addition to decreasing fermentation time and increasing
the hospitability for bacterial infections.

Dryhopping will not add bitterness.  Ideally you want to add dryhops when
the beer is almost done because evolving CO2 will scrub out some of the
hop aromatics.  If you are sure you need more bitterness, you can make up
a hop tea by boiling just hops in water and then straining the liquid into
your beer.  If you boil 45-60 minutes, you will add only bitterness (no
flavor or aroma).

It's not, but I read the HBD for new ideas for my own brewing and to help
out with questions.  Much of the discussion is strictly academic, but some
has practical applications if you add it to other information you have
read or experienced earlier.  To use your example, for a 1048 ale, you
don't really need anything but shaking your carboy, but for a 1120 lager,
you will need to do more than that to get enough O2 in solution.

Could it be too hot a sparge?  Too hot a sparge water (above 170F or so)
can liberate unconverted starch.  Your Corona setting (*larger* malt
fragments) would simply increase this effect.

I'm with Spencer on this one.  The inspection line is more of a note to
myself.  If I don't find a problem with the beer, I don't even mention
it in the scored section of the form.  By the way, I try to remember to

See my comments above on what affects fermentation time.  Apart from
sanitation there's little anyone can do to make an undrinkable batch --
I'm sure you did nothing wrong.

NO!  Wait for the fementation to go down to about 1 bubble every 1 to 2
minutes.

Yes.  Using good sanitation techniques, take a sample, measure SG and
drink the sample (don't put it back into the brew).

Don't rush the brew.  It's better to drink some quality microbrew for New
Years than to spoil (overcarbonate) a batch by rushing it.

Being Australian has nothing to do with golden-ness.  "Light" or "Gold"
extracts from the US, UK, Belgium, Germany, etc. all will make a golden
colored beer -- some darker than others.  If you cannot get a golden
beer from any extract, I suspect you are aerating your wort when it is hot,
which will darken it considerably.

It's not so much the yeast as the temperature.  You will get a much fruitier
beer than a Doppelbock -- more like a Strong Scotch Ale.

This is not really correct -- a quality extract wort made from all-malt
extract will have a similar sugar profile to an all-grain wort.  Crummy,
dextrose-stretched extracts could make for a different sugar profile,
but that would make for a longer, less-vigorous ferment due to the
shortage of FAN (amino acids, for yeast nutrition).

I believe Cook's bottles (if it's not Cook's then it's some other US
sparkling wine)  don't take standard US crown caps.  But I agree that
most US sparking wine bottles do take the standard US crowns.  Most
european sparkling wines have the larger opening, but there are a few
that do take the standard US crown cap (I believe Dom Perignon is one,
so buy a lot when you find it on sale).

My fears would be: 1) that the pressure from the *complete* primary
fermentation could get very high, even to the point of affecting the
yeast and the possiblity of explosion, and 2) primary fermenation
often releases or produces undesirable gasses (DMS and some sulfur
compounds, for example) and you would not want to use these.  I believe
that the commercial brewers "srub" their CO2 before reuse.

When you rack fermenting or fermented beer, you will invitably release some
dissolved CO2 (thanks to the partial pressure at the top of the siphon hose)
so this will serve as a CO2 blanket as long as you use an airlock on your
secondary.  1" is certainly not worth worrying about, but even if it was
more, I'd say the topping up is unnecessary.  If you do top-up, use boiled
water so you don't introduce dissolved O2.

Wyeast *has* released their "Belgian White" yeast.  On the other hand,
a customer of mine has brewed some excellent Witbiers using Wyeast Bavarian

I don't think your problem is from the Stainless.  Check your
water chemistry (check for high Calcium or Magnesium levels) and then 
check your malt freshness.  Stale malt has been known to give metallic
flavors (see the Troubleshooting issue of Zymurgy).

I think you may have indeed diagnosed your own problem.  From what
I recall, most Chicago water is very soft. The dark grains that you
are using will make the mash more acidic, in fact that why they were used
historically. Most dark ale districts were those that had hard water
and the acidity of the more highly roasted grains was used to counteract
the high alkalynity of the water.  What may be happening in your case is that
the acidic dark grains are dropping the mash ph below the ideal for
conversion.  you could try to get a ph reading from the mash, but I've
never been able to read my cheap litmus papers in a dark mash.  I would
just add a teaspoon or so of calcium carbonate to it when you mash in
and see what happens. Since the carbonate levels in my town often get
as high as 300ppm, I've never needed to do this myself.

I have a set of these from Brew-Ha-Ha.  I liked them a lot at first.  They
are a lot easier than bottling.  They are also quite convienent and they fit
in the fridge in the kitchen.


Like everyone else that's used them at first
I had problems with overpriming.  You have to use a very light touch (<1/2 cup
corn suger in 5 gallons) or they just produce foam.  Too much pressure can even 
damage the can.  Even after I mastered this I still had major foaming problems.
I think that the dispenser could really use a hose type spigot so that the
keg pressure could be brought down before the beer hits your glass at 90
miles an hour.  Since my main experiments with the cans were with last 
summer's wheat beers, you can imagine the mess this made.


Now a few months later it seems that the tapper/dispenser (aka the expensive
part) is damaged.  I can't put in a co2 cartridge without most of the gas
just blowing out the back and being wasted.  Once I lose ~half the gas this
way it still seems to have some sort of slow leak that means the beer will 
be flat by the next day.  I don't recall doing anything savage enough to
the tapper that should have broken it this way, but I do have 2 small
children, so all bets are off...


I was dissapointed enough with them that I kept saving those nickels and
dimes and got a fridge for the garage and and a real kegging setup.  If I
lived in a small apartment  I think I would have stuck with the cans
longer, just because they are so much more space efficient.  As it is I think
I will donate them to a freind that does live in an apt.

No.  What we really want is for people to be reasonably polite.  If this

see this as trampling on your rights.  You *do*, of course, have the

I would be most curious to know where you got these figures.  As far as
