Is anyone out there making champagne for New Years? 
  
I have been making beer in champagne bottles for a few years, and have
yet to have a single explosion.  Somehow, my champagne, on the other
hand, seems to either be flat or explosive.  The method of pressurizing I use
is to bottle early, or add a small amount of sugar (as opposed to CO2
cartridges--that's cheating).  My Christmas ale turned out fine, but I'll bet
it doesn't compare to some of the others...
 
If anyone's making sparkling wine, and bottles without CO2, contact me

Looking at my notes from Dave Logsdon's talk, "Matching Yeasts to Beer
Styles" at this summer's convention, Dave stated that 1098 was a single
strain.  He said that they were working on multiple strain yeasts that
would be out soon.  (Are any of the new varieties multiple strains?)


He also had a couple of other interesting points that I'll throw out here.
He claimed that numerous studies have shown that dry yeast does not give
you a faster start than liquid.  The foaming and gas production is a
byproduct of the rehydration and is not actual growth.  Neither form
of yeast reaches exponential growth for about 12 hours.


Someone asked about repitching yeast from the secondary.  Dave said that
yeast should be taken from both the primary and the secondary, or you'll
risk ending up with a yeast with different characteristics.  His point
was that a certain component of the yeast may "do its thing" early and
drop out of suspension early and not make it to the secondary.  Without
this component, the yeast repitched from the secondary may have different
characteristics.

Subject: pride & clean bottles


I was recently accused of submitting beer to contests because I'm
proud of it.  (I know I'm paraphrasing to make a point, so don't flame
too hard, ok?)  Well, certainly, there's some of that.  I don't
generally submit swill.  (I inflict that on local brewclub members,
instead. :-)


But what I was getting at was this: any beer I send to a competition
is SOMETHING I MADE.  It's therefore a LITTLE PART OF ME, and the
presentation REFLECTS ON ME.  If I send a grungy bottle, that's as
good as saying I'M A GRUNGY PERSON.  (Sure, sometimes, but not usually
in public.)  Not to mention the implicit message it sends to the
judges: "I didn't have the 5 minutes it would take to clean up this
bottle, but I expect you to give the beer in it a thorough evaluation
anyway."


Someone else complained about how hard it is to clean bottles just to
send in beer to a competition.  My heart bleeds.  Plan ahead.  Soak
the bottle for a day or two.  I have yet to find a label that doesn't
fall off of its own accord if you soak it long enough.


The last competition I judged, 5 judges decided for one reason or
another not to show up.  The rest of us spent 6 hours, judging 2
flights (typically >10 beers) each (and then the 6 of us who had any
stamina left mass-judged the 8 beers in the barleywine category).  And
you can't spend 5 minutes cleaning your bottle.  Foo.


So, if it's such a painful experience, why do I judge?  Foremost,
probably because it helps me improve my own brewing and my
appreciation of good beer.  Also, I'm giving something back to the
brewing community.  And, when you hit that one perfect beer of the
competition, it's worth all the infected ones.  And, it's fun (at
least for the first 10 or so:-).

P.S. Does any of this relate to the discussion about "language" in the HBD?

Subject: clarification, priming


Two questions from an amateur homebrewer.
I have made a amber ale and it is wonderful, though cloudy.  What is
a recommended clarification process?
I am no longer using corn sugar but malt in the brewing process but
still am when priming.  I notice the brew still has a cider flavor.  Is
there an alternative to corn sugar for priming and/or am I using too much?

Here's a section of an article that I wrote for "The Brewprint" - 
the Newsletter of the Boston Wort Processors.


          Wort Processor and brewmaster at the Ould Newbury Brewing
    Co., Joe Rolfe, has donated a 25 Kg sack of carastan malt from maltsters
    Hugh Baird in England to the club.  


        What is carastan malt ???  An essay by George Fix in the January
    1993 Brewprint provides some clues.  Here's a brief synopsis.


        Carastan malt is produced by roasting "green malt."  It is
    enzymaticaly inactive.  The roasted "green malts" produced by HB are
    subdivided into four categories:


        light carastan                13-17 L
        carastan                30-40 L
        crystal                        70-80 L
        dark crystal                100-160L


        For this particular malt, Joe has supplied some specific information. 
    First, he says that it is dextrinous.  The color is 32.8 L, it has a
    fermentable extract of 71.1% and a moisture content of 8.8%. 


Hope that helps,


        Tim

I agree that adding handling fees to orders in not 
appropriate: I think many suppliers do this so that their prices seem 
lower than they actually are.  I believe a customer should pay for
the cost of the product and actual shipping fees and any SPECIAL
packing or shipping e.g., special packing for glass or overnight air
shipment.  IMO, filling an order, packing a box, and getting it to
UPS/RPS or the Post Office is *part of the cost of doing business*.


Most suppliers list these costs in their catalog or other literature
and I agree with Gary: let the buyer beware.  The reality of shipping
is that there is a minimum charge for a package and the shipping cost
increases nonlinearly with increased weight.  I think a more ethical
practice is to charge only for shipping.  If small orders are a
hassle, then offer an incentive for larger orders i.e., free shipping 
rather than penalize the customer for small orders.

I believe that Iodophor is more of a sterilant than a keg cleaning 
solution.  I recommend using TSP to clean soda kegs or kegs that have had
beer sitting in them w/o a CO2 cover.  I use 1/4C per gallon in *very hot*
water and let them soak for several hours, then rinse well.  If your keg
is visually clean and still has a soda or unpleasant odor, there is a
non-vanishing probability that your beer will pick up this odor/flavor.


Without initiating a veritable plethora of net traffic regarding the
socio-economic implications of o-ring/poppet valve replacement, I
suggest replacing the large o-ring, the diptube o-rings, the ball or
pin valve o-rings, and the poppet valves.  IMHO, rebuilding your kegs
is a good investment($5 to $6) and will increase your chances of 
making consistently great homebrew.  Isn't this what it's all about?

Subject: cleaning kegs


  Before I kegged a recent batch, I happened to take a look inside the 
long pick-up tube.  It looked less than clean.  So I took the ol' 
ubiquitous Q-tip and put it in the tube, and forced it through with
hot water.  The Q-tip came out dirty, and the tube was noticeably cleaner.
If you sanitize your kegs with boiling water, a dirty pickup tube may
not be a problem; the heat should kill most anything.  But if you use a
sanitizing solution, it may be more important to ensure that all parts
of the keg are clean before sanitizing.  Either way, it's small work
to clean the tube.


  Re. sanitizing solutions:  I've got a 5-gallon plastic bucket that I
keep filled with a strong, almost saturated, solution of B-Brite.  As 
long as I remember to tightly seal the cover, it remains active (ie. it 
is still very "slippery") for a long time (months).  I even store things 
such as rubber stoppers and plastic fermentation locks right in the bucket.

Subject: Brewpubs, and other pipe dreams...


Several friends and I have been musing about what it would
take to start a brewpub, now that they are legal in Texas.
My main interest in this is to bring good beer to Texas, 
and to learn to brew on a bigger scale. I've brewed about 20, 
mainly partial-mash brews, and certainly dont feel like I 
(by myself) have the expertise to brew on a big scale.


Do you need a Masterbrewer to start, and if so where do you
find one? Should you start with extract brewing, or bite 
the bullet and do it right the first time; what are the cost
trade-offs with either method? Have any of you 
micro owners tried these "rent a brewmeister" folks who come 
out and show you the ropes for several weeks?


This is a bit tangential to most digest requests, so private
E-mail is suggested and welcome. Any insights, anecdotes, or 
war stories would be appreciated.


Thanks, and Merry Christmas.

I posted this to r.c.b with no response so I'm trying it here...


When should Carapils be added in the mashing process to obtain
the residual sweetness assosiated with the grain?  In the past
I have added it at mashout along with my Crystal but I'm not 
sure how effective this is.  I have heard two versions.  The first
being that there is no need to mash Carapils and the sweetness will
show up if the grain is treated as a specialty grain.  The second
version is that the grain needs to be mashed to get anything but
starch out of the grain.  Does anyone have the true story?

Subject: Summary of responses to Insufficient head problem




I posted an accounting of a recent problem where I noticed my Nut Brown Ale
(nicknamed Moonbeam after a famous California governor) would lose its head
immediately after being poured into the mug (from a bottle... I haven't kegged
in a while, but more on that later.)  I received several responses, some in
HBD and some private email.  Several suggestions were given, and I'll list
a few. 


Cause/Solution #1 - Soap residue in mug

Others had similar suggestions, and I'm sorry for not giving appropriate credit.

===========================================

This could be the culprit.  Since I'm pretty sloppy at measuring to 5 gallons,
I may not have enough carbonation, even though it does seem to foam up some    
when pouring.






Cause/Solution #3 - Not enough small proteins

Some postings in HBD also suggested I either add some wheat malt or more hops
TO get sufficient proteins in my wort.  Thanks for the suggestions!






One final suggestion from someone who shall remain anonymous - try a
dozen red roses! ;->

What I can tell you about this is that it is best done in a lab. Electroplating
is usually done in cyanide baths or in the case of sulfate baths, at high
current densities 40 amps/ft-squared. Not easy to do at home in the sink. Also
the stainless needs to be pickled in strong acid beforehand to remove all of
the surface oxides that make stainless stain-less.
Aluminum cladding is done under pressure by rolling two sheets together. It is
cheaper than copper electroplating and provides nearly identical results in
terms of heat transfer charactoristics.

Bacterial infection is not the only possibility. This problem is beginning
to sound a lot like a problem that I had with funny tastes in kegged beer.
I was using the exact same procedure - sanitize with idophor, push down the
poppets to get full coverage, force idophor through all parts with CO2. I
had no problems with my bottled beer but the kegged beer came out with what
I suppose you could call a medicinal/metallic taste. It wasn't a bacterial
infection taste though it was an IODINE taste. To this day I can't serve
porter to my homebrew club without at least a few snickers. My experience
with idophor is that not only does it have to be rinsed but that the rubber
parts of kegs like O-rings and gaskets can pick up a long-term iodine
flavor. 


I started tearing my kegs apart, boiling all rubber parts, sanitizing the
metal parts with chlorine or idophor, and then rinsing all metal parts.
with boiled water. The cornelius kegs aren't that hard to take apart. Just
unscrew the intake and output valves. You can use an adjustable wrench but
having the right extra-deep socket wrenches (~$5.00) makes the job a lot
easier. I think 3/4" or 7/8" sockets fit most keg valves. With the valves
unscrewed the two tubes (short air tube, long liquid tube) pull right out.

Checking for sediment is not a good test. It is easy to get lots of
sediment in a CP-filled bottle. For example the first few glasses (or
bottles) out of a keg pick up some of the yeast sediment from the bottom.
The same can happen for a whole batch if you CP-bottle before all the yeast
has settled out or if you shake up the keg accidently but have to ship your
beer to the contest that day. Conversely, I know microbreweries that filter
their beer before priming and then prime and add just enough yeast to get
carbonation. They are bottle conditioned but have virtually no visible
sediment.


My main point is that non-judges can take bottle inspection comments
seriously. They don't know that they are just notes to yourself. The
comments should be to provide constructive feedback to the brewer and I
feel that any comments that don't directly relate to the quality of the
beer are inappropriate especially when they can be percevied as negative.

The shipping cost are cleary stated in the catalog as are the costs for 
upgrading the type of shipping from standard UPS.  My experience with
mail order is that one can not assume what shipping and handling costs
are, you need to ask.  Small orders are just as much work to pack and
ship as larger ones if the cost of handling exceeds the profit on the
items purchased why sell them.
Let the buyer beware.

Subject: Making a Belgian White Ale....


Some minor clarifications and updates to Micheal Yee's posting on the
"HBU-BBS/Steve Daniel- Celis White" recipe in HBD #1302:


 - The portions about the proper yeast selection were in fact written by
  Steve Moore, the HBU-SW Campus Sysop, and not by Steve Daniel.  All other
  sections are properly attributed to Steve Daniel and Tony Storz.


 - Pierre Celis was present at all major events at the Dixie Cup in Houston
  last October.  He was very open and gracious with information about his
  brewing process, giving us added confirmation that we were on the right
  track with this recipe.


 - Dave Noonan's brewpub in Burlington, Vermont is now making a commercial
  Wit based directly upon the HBU/Steve Daniel recipe.  Unfortunately, I
  have not had a chance to try it yet, but have heard good reports.


I just brewed an all-grain batch of it with some friends, and can confirm
that the yeast selection is indeed crucial.  We started with some growing
dregs from a Steendonk bottle.  This plodded along for a few days, and then
we ended up pitching some Bavarian Wheat Wyeast to get the thing going.
We're still waiting on final product while we "dry-BOQ" on the Bitter Orange
Quarters that Pierre recommends, but the beer was _quite_ close to Celis in
terms of color and aroma at the time of racking.  If we can just get the
gravity down to an acceptable range and pick up the proper flavors from
the Bitter Orange Quarters, we should have a really close imitation of Celis
White.  We're also considering adding some lactic acid before final kegging
in an attempt to simulate the results of the secondary lactic fermentation
that Pierre does.  I'd be interested in any HBDwisdom on how do achieve this
last step.

Subject: Slotted Copper/Step Mash/Miscellany


John Wheaton writes about installing a slotted copper tube to the bottom of his
mash tun to make it a mash/lauter tun.  This will work, John, as it is similar
to my cooler setup.  With only one pipe, I would probably try to put it
directly on the bottom of the tun though.  This will leave less liquor behind
and probably prevent more of the grain from finding its way into the slots.
Very little of the grain would be trapped under the pipe, I would think not
enough to worry about in terms of temperature extremes.  I'm sure Jack will
note your reason for not using SS screen:  it is less durable than the pipe.
He claims that the SS screen he buys is very rugged and that durability is not
an issue.  I have not found SS readily available in my area.

These numbers are just a guide.  Every mash tun is different (absorbs different
amounts of heat, etc.).  You need to adjust these numbers (keep good records)
to own setup.  I would recommend using something like .75 quart of 145F water
per 1 lb grain to hit your protein rest temp.  Then use up to .5 qt 212F water
per 1 lb grain to hit your saccharification temp.


>What are the consequences of the mash being so much thinner (than his
>1 step infussion, it's 50% thinner) during the final step????


A thicker mash encourages one of the main saccharification enzymes and a
thinner mash encourages the other (alpha amylase likes it thick??? I can't
remember).  Anyway, it is in at least one of the common books.  Look it up and
you can then adjust your temperature to aid the enzyme that's getting the short
end of the stiffness stick.  Of course, this may end up making a poor
environment for both enzymes!  Comments?

Now you've got me.  I haven't ever really tried this (sheepish grin...)

You'll probably get lots of reponse about how you are wasting your time doing a
protein rest in the first place (well-modified malts like Breiss 2-row don't
need it, etc.).  I am interested in the subject for future brews which may
require it.  Also, it would be interesting to be able to do multiple
saccarification steps (say, 145F, 150F, 155F, mashout) to see the effect it has
on the brew.  I'm not sure this is possible though without really diluting the
mash.

I got one of these as a gift this fall.  I put up a batch

1 - The beer was mostly foam when I first tapped it.

    the keg quite a bit.
3 - It was Ok over the next 2 days.
4 - With the tap on it is taller than a standard fridge shelf
5 - This beer was good, and reasonably carbonated in bottles
6 - 5L is actually quite a bit of beer.  This meant that I ran
    out of bottles all the quicker and had to wait for an 
    occasion to open the keg.
7 - I tapped one of the comerical 5L mini kegs using the

I recently received a new book from the AHA entitled Evaluating Beer. What
I read so far seems pretty informative but I noticed one the final chapters
was written by Jim Koch (the book is a collection of previously published
articles by various authors). His was a fairly short article which basically
says that hops and malt are THE most important factors in beer taste. The
word yeast is not mentioned even once in the entire article. He does mention
water but says that is not important because it can be treated to suit
whatever the brewers needs are. As an example he points out the Bud tastes
the same whether iuts made in Tampa, Newark or St.Louis. I suppose this
means AB could produce Pilsner Urquell or Bass Ale if they had the right
hops and Malt. Other than this chapter the book appears to be worth the
price.

smaller competitors, and by focusing market resources on new brands."
 
Being a resident of Wisconsin and also being surrounded by some fine

What of Sprecher, Capital, Point, Schell?  Have any list members heard any

Will the quality and character of regional brewing be adversely effected by
takeovers or will just the name on the letterhead be changed?  For instance,
Berghoff no longer brews beer for the Berghoff Hotel and anecdotal accounts

Subject: High malt glucose syrup, etc.




Hi all --


I have three questions for you:


(1) I recently started brewing again, after a prolonged hiatus (7 
years!).  When I went to the local home brew store I asked for some 
dried malt extract instead of corn sugar to go with an english bitter 
kit I had.  The proprietor of the store sold me stuff called "high malt 
glucose syrup" instead.  I made up the kit with this syrup, and then 
put it downstairs to ferment about a week ago.  I just tested the 
gravity yesterday to see if it was ready for bottling, and had a sip of 
the beer that was in the graduate cylinder.  It was FABULOUS --> no 
cidery overtones, lots of body, and an incredible malt flavour.  What 
*is* this stuff?  I assumed, from the name, that it was just glucose 
syrup.  It sure doesn't leave a taste like glucose, though!


(2) The proprietor of same store tells me to bottle as soon as the 
gravity falls below 1.010.  Says that if I let the beer ferment further 
I'm "losing alcohol".  This doesn't make sense to me.  Can anyone explain?


(3) There seems to have been a lot of discussion about starter 
gravities in HBD.  I've just gone and made up a pile of starters 
(boiled up 2 gallons of wort, then canned it in mason jars).  The 
starters turned out to have a higher SG than I was expecting -- about 
1.050 vs. the 1.040 that I was trying for.  I suspect that  the 1 Kg 
bag of dried malt extract I purchased was a little overfull.  In any 
case, my question is simply this -- does anyone have a good feel for 
what the optimal SG for a starter is?  Is my 1.050 going to cause a problem?


Thanks for all of your help.


Alec.

I took second place in the national Weiss is Nice competition

For 5 gal:


6 lbs Yellow Dog Extract
1/2 lb. cracked crystal malt
1/2 oz. Hallertau hops


YeastLabs Weizen yeast in 1 qt. starter


Steep crystal in water as water is brought to boil.
Add hops and extract.
Boil for 90 min.  (longer boil is better for wheat beers)
No finising hops.
Force chill and pitch yeast at 68 deg. F.
Ferment till done.
Rack to secondary and lager at 40 deg. for one month.


The YeastLabs Weizen strain deserves all the credit.   The true 
Weizen cloviness really comes through.

Subject: Bulk hop purchasing




I hope this doesn't get interpreted as a commercial, but I would really
like to share a good experience and recommend it to everyone:
 
Our homebrew club (the Bloatarian Brewing League) has always bought
grain in bulk quantities (like a ton or two at a time).  This method
has been so efficient and economical that we decided it would be
worthwhile to try buying hops the same way.
 
We gathered everyone's list of what hops they expected to be using 
between now and next harvest, and consolidated them into one big list.
 
Then we checked some suppliers and settled on The Hop Source in Oregon
(Glenn Tinseth, 503-873-2879).  Since it was a bulk order (over 25 
pounds), Glenn gave us 50% off his normal prices for the 92 crop, and
25% off his 93 crop prices.  We wound up buying 72 pounds of hops,
and Glenn's only restriction was that we order in units of pounds.
 
When the hops arrived, they were packed in one-pound, oxygen-barrier
vacuum-sealed bags, and the 92 crop looked as good as the 93 crop. 
Bright green and beautiful.
 
I'm sure that other hop merchants will offer similar deals, so this
isn't really a "plug" for The Hop Source, and I certainly don't have
any connection of any kind other than as very satisfied customer.
 
If anyone is looking for hops to carry them through the winter
brewing season, I strongly encourage you to get your club together
and put a bulk order in now.
 
 
One final note:  I have found that once the oxygen-barrier bag is
opened, an excellent way of keeping the hops pretty fresh is to wrap
them in aluminum foil and crimp the edges tightly.  Zip-lock plastic
bags are useful, but they don't keep the oxygen out, while aluminum
foil gives you as close to an airtight container as you're likely
to find.  Obviously, you want to keep them in the freezer or at least
the refrigerator (or even outside if you're in a cold climate), since
the vapor pressure will be reduced by the lower temperature, also
contributing to freshness.
