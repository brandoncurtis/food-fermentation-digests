What temperatures should starters for lagers be done, at ale or lager temps?
Also, is it a problem to use a much bigger bottle, such as a 1 gallon for a
1 quart starter?

I just got back from a trip to NH--I stopped at Catamount Brewery in 
White River Junction. On the tour the tour guide mentioned that they brew 
Newman's Albany Amber brews now. Apparently, Newman doesnt brew anything 
now--its all contracted out.


Another note--apparently Catamount is brewing Pike's Place brews for the 
east coast!

Subject: Specific Gravity readings


In the fine tradition of... "Relax. Don't Worry. Have a HomeBrew!" I am
trying to do just that. I have just tried my first batch of HomeBrew. After I
finished preparing the wort and was ready to add the yeast I took a
hydrometer reading and it was 1.022. Although I am a neophyte at this sort of
thing, I do know that the reading should have been much higher (about
1.038-1.045). The wort was at 65F so the temperature should not have affected
the reading. I took the reading in the fermenter tank (one of those white
plastic pails), could this be the problem. Any suggestions.

Subject: Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout


Not a direct brewing question, but could someone venture
an opinion on whether or not this beer is worth $17.00 a 
six-pack? I've noticed it on the shelves a couple of times
and it sounds very tempting, but I've been reluctant to
take the plunge.

Subject: Shipping brew, Brewing Wine coolers


Here's a couple questions I hope someone can help me out with. First of
all, I've just gotten into homebrewing and would like to ship some of it
from here in Maine to my brother in Phoenix.  Does anyone know what the
bottom line is on shipping brew? What does UPS think about it?


  The other question is like the one Dan Wood asked a couple days ago about
making fruit flavored sparkling waters.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend
doesn't share my enthusiasm for a freshly brewed ale.  She does like
wine coolers a lot and, being new to brewing, I'm wondering what it
takes to make a batch of it.  Thanks in advance for any info.

Does anyone have an all-grain recipe producing something similar to 
Vermont's Otter Creek Copper Ale? It is one of the finest beers I've 
tasted. I'd also appreciate receiving an all-grain tried and tested recipe 
for a Bass pale ale. I'm brewing this Thursday. 


Thanks

Subject: question:




Would any of you more experienced brewers be able to advise me on a simple
question?  I'd like to know what I should do with my latest batch of beer.


I was using Papazian's Righteous Real Ale (page 178 of TNCJoH) recipe, with
the addition of crystal malt for a more reddish color.  I also used 6 lb of
malt extract instead of 5 lb.


Way back in late November I started this brew in two five gal. buckets.
The next day I transferred to carboy.  Fermentation slowed and I racked the
beer off the sediment and back into the carboy.  About mid December the
fermentation picked up again and blew foam out the triple tube(?) airlock.
It slowed a bit more, and I went back home for the holidays.  I'm back now,
and the beer is STILL going.  It's got one bubble every 7 seconds, and a
gravity of 1.006 at 76 degrees F.


Should I let it keep going?  Should I bottle it?  If I bottle it, should
I use less than the recommended amount of primer?

Subject: wine suggestions


Kim P. asks for wine fruit suggestions...


My only wine book is "Winemaker's Recipe Handbook" by Raymond Massaccesi.
It has a purple cover.  It has lots of recipes for many different fruits.


This fall I picked some wild grapes (Fox, Oregon, Muscadine?) and
chokecherries and these made my best wine ever.  I also made some from mint.
Another suggestion:  try sparkling wine.  You just prime it with corn sugar,
sort of like priming beer.


I have tried peach, too, but don't like it.  I tried someone else's peach
wine, and didn't like his, either.


Good luck...    Aaron Dionne
