Subject: growing hops


Several submissions lately have addressed the freshness of packaged hops sold
through common retail distribution systems.


As a relatively new homebrewer, who will be starting tomatoes, peppers &
other crops indoors within the next month or so, I'd be curious to know
what's involved in growing hops. What tempertatures/climates do they prefer?
Can they be home grown? Where are seed or plant sources (haven't seen much on
this in zymurgy, tho I haven't scanned every ad in depth). What's involved in
harvesting & using in beer? Are there any good reference books out there I
should check out?


Any/all help is appreciated.

I wish I had known this before, but I pass it along. I made my second=
 batch
Jan 1, a 6 gallon Munton's Gold extract kit with Yeast Lab London=
 Ale
yeast. From pitching Sat afternoon, I saw no activity until Tues=
 morning. I
even opened the fermenter Monday afternoon to see if there was anything
amiss. I saw a few yeast blooms on the surface, so I sealed it back=
 up. If
I saw no action by Tuesday eve, I was going to chuck the dry yeast=
 in
there.


I did make a starter with some DME, but not the day before; I just=
 did that
while the wort was on the boil, and tossed it in when the temp was=
 right.=20


OG of 1043, as specified, and some fairly active burping now (1 big=
 bubble

I am relieved to read in this AM's HBD that some other brewer also=
 made 6
gallon batches out of 5 gallon kits (my first one: ever had a Newcastle
Brown Lite? Don't bother ;-).

Subject: "aging" beers (how to store?)


Given the number of comments I've seen lately about the (sometimes
unexpectedly good) quality of holiday brews that are some years old, I have
a simple question.  How should one store these?  Is refrigeration
necessary, or is a "cool, dark place" (my basement) sufficient?  My
motivation for asking is the unexpected arrival in my home of a case of
Anchor's Christmas Ale ('93-'94 issue).

Subject: Amber aging


I made an amber recently from a kit. It was about 3/4 malt, 1/4 sugar,
cascade hops. It tasted OK, but a little weak (too much sugar). But
it had a weak head (didn't last long) and I probably did not let it
age long enough (I was too eager to open it for Christmas). What can
I do to get a better head (more malt)? And how long do other people
recommend I age my ambers?


Any amber recipes GLADLY accepted.


Thanks,
Paul A. Austin

S. uvarum has a propensity for producing large amounts of higher molecular
alcohols when fermentation takes place at temperatures above the mid 50s.
These can produce their own off tastes, or combine with fatty acids to
produce too many esters.  In most lager styles, fruity (estery) aromas
and flavors are considered to be flaws.


Last week, at a beer judging study group, I came across one commercial 
European Pilsner with an extremely distinctive and strong "grass" aroma.  
Spencer Thomas had along a copy of _Evaluating Beer_, which pointed to a 
particular higher molecular alcohol.  I can either blame the fermentation
temperature or the particular strain of yeast for that aroma.  Whether
it was intentional or not is a different matter.  :-)

Subject: Stein Trivia


I came across an interesting note, I think it is a conbination of
"urban legend" and truth as to the reason why beer steins in England
have glass bottoms.  Here are the two theories for those that care;
1. When the British Navy was in the habit of "pressing" or forcibly
recruiting citizens they would go into pubs and drop coins in peoples
glasses.  If you drank you beer and found a coin in the bottom, then
you were a new recruit.  The glass bottom, combined with the tradition
of raising a new glass in a toast to the buyer gave you a way to decide
whether or not you really needed that next beer.
2.  The other reason that I heard was so that you did not have to take
your eyes off the person that you were drinking with when you raised
your stein to your lips.  What a wonderful time to be alive, huh?  Can't
even trust the bloke what buys you an ale.

I recently switched to using reverse osmosis purified water because 
my city water was unusable (300 ppm calcium) for most brews. Monday 
the PH of my robust porter mash was 4.9, before I added calcium 
carbonate to raise it. I think you're on the right track, and I 
think I'm going to start blending R/O water with city water based on 
the amount of dark malts in my mash.

Dave Suurballe <suurb`at`farallon.com> writes:


 I brewed yesterday for the first time since the most recent outbreak of
 counterflow vs immersion controversy, and I thought I would add fuel to the
 fire by sharing yet another data point.


 I chilled 10 gallons (39 liters, actually) of 1040 wort from boiling down to 65
 degrees in 16 minutes.  The cooling water entered the apparatus at 55.5 degrees
 and exited at 101 degrees. I used 34 gallons of water.


 It's a counterflow chiller with 3/8 copper inside of 40 feet of garden hose.


 My intuition says that the product of the volume of chilled wort and its
 temperature change should equal the product of the volume of coolant and its
 temperature change, but that is not the case here.  I don't know why.


 Suurballe


If you have ten gallons going from boiling (212 F) to 65 F, that's a loss of 
1470 gallons-F.  Take your 34 gallons of coolant times its change and you get
1547 gallons-F.  the difference is 77 gals-F, or 5.24%.  Either you are
violating all the laws of thermodynamics (none of which I know well enough
to quote! ;->) or your measurements are less than 5% accurate.  Considering
the accuracy of moost brewing equipment, I would say that's the case.  So
your intuition seems to be spot on!

I a CAMRA brewing guide I found a reference to this technique.  It stated
that the process needed to by "catalyzed" by metal salts
 such as magnesium chloride or calcium sulfate.  Most of us have Epsom
salts and Gypsum around and it might be worth the try.

Subject: Thermoelectric Igloo Cooler




There was a post about thermoelectric devices to cool a fridge
and it reminded me of a cooler a came across in a catalog while
Christmas shopping this year.  The cooler runs off of 12 volt power
and an optional adater can be purchased to allow it to operate on
110V.  The ad claimed that it would not only cool but heat as well!
Only $99.


Oh yeah, more POWER!    M A S H O M A T I C !


Wrong!  I ran right out to the catalog store and looked it over.  The
first thing I noticed was that the top temperature was 140 degrees.
The real killer though was the notice that said, "Do not, under any
circumstances put liquid in this cooler".  How dumb.  Sigh.  I wonder
if anyone out there has any information on the efficiency, top operating
temperature, etc. of these devices.  Would they ever be practical for
application in mashing, if only for temperature control of an already
heated mash?

This is also true.  Yet another case of the BATF run amok (remember Waco?).
Anyone who would put nutritional information on their beer bottles ought to be
shot!  Clearly BATF has it out for Grant's for some reason.  Lets hope they
survive the assault.

Its actually quite a misnomer, Bob.  An easymasher is a piece of pipe with a SS
screen clamped on the end.  It is installed in a kettle in order to use it for
mashing grains.  The easymasher is really only a part of the mashing system,
but it provides a simple way to remove the liquor from the grain.

Cold temperature.  You are really pushing that yeast to ask it to perform
(quickly) at 50F.  I'm sure the beer came out very clean tasting, but it will
take longer than normal at those temperatures.  I think that closer to 60F is
ideal.  What's an Eichler (sez the guy from Florida)?

In my preparations for moving to all grain, I'm still not real
clear (ie: more pre-worrying...better now then during the
brew process!) on the logistics of doing an all grain batch.


It's not so much the mashing methods (ie: temperature, etc),
but rather what gets put where in what step: sparging, lautering,
etc. Does one really dump the grains into something else
if not using a kettle mash? Has anyone used one of those
nylon sparging bags/grain bags? How is one used, and when
in the process?


Please send detailed information, and thanks in advance

Hi all,


I'm working on putting together my RIMS and I had seen a post here about
a pump (MDX-1/2) from C and H Sales for ~$50 that looked perfect.  Sadly,
they are out now that I can afford it.


Does anyone have another source for an inexpensive FOOD GRADE pump that
can handle liquids in excess of 100C?  It doesn't need to generate any 
suction at the intake, and I'd like about 3 gal/min when pumping up
5 feet.

I'm writing this to respond to two questions:


On the use of Ovens to sterilize things.  Damn good idea.  When we
autoclave here at work and wrap the opening of a container with foil,
it pretty much stays sterile until the foil comes off.  However,
repeated autoclaving weakens the glass.  I don't know if the oven
would have the same effect.


Some people were worried about bleach sanitizing solution killing the
bacteria in their septic tanks.  Walk into a pet store and buy some
chlorine neutralizer.  Add a couple of drops, stir and add more and
stir until the bleach smell goes away.  Then pour down the drain

Subject: Kettle Mashing


 
 >From: SWEENERB`at`memstvx1.memst.edu
 >Subject: kettle mashing on a Cajun cooker/gelatin & yeast
 
 >1.  heat water in kettle to strike temp and add grains
 
 There are a number of reasons why it is more practical to add the grain to 
 room temp water and heat the entire mash instead of just dumping the grain 
 into hot water.
 
 The most obvious is that there is no guessing about "strike" temp.  You 
 simply shut off the heat when you get there and add more as it cools to 
 maintain temp.
 
 The more arguable is that if you are a believer in all the favorite "rest" 
 temps that get promoted in brewing circles, you can make the case that, as 
 the mash temp is climbing to sacchrification temp, it spends some finite time 
 at all those magic temps.
 
 >2.  mash for 90 min.
 
 I know of no reason to mash for 90 minutes.  Most grain fully converts iN 30 
 minutes or less.  45 mins should provide a reasonable guard band if you do 
 not do the iodine test.
 
 >3.  separate wort from grains (either use the EASYMASHER approach of putting 
 a drain in bottom of kettle or use a metal racking cane) and put in one of my 
 other pots
 
 >4.  add heated sparge water and collect more wort.  This is what I am fuzzy 
 about; how do you heat sparge water and at the same time keep mash hot with 
 only one heat source?
 
 Steps 3 and 4 normally are concurrent and continuous.  After your mash is 
 complete, remove kettle from heat source and start heating sparge water.
 
 The mash should be allowed to settle for 15 to 30 minutes during which time 
 you should get at least some water heated so you can start sparging.  If you 
 use something like a coffee pot to heat it in you can sparge as fast as you 
 can heat the water.  If you use two, it is even better.
 
 If you want to get more sophisticated, you can make or buy an EASYSPARGER and 
 have an unlimited supply of sparge water that requires no preplanning.  This 
 is nothing more than a small kettle with a hose going to a hot water tap and 
 an output port that dribbles into the mash tun.
 
 The important thing is to understand that sparging is not normally a batch 
 process.  You want to keep an inch of water over the grain at all times 
 during sparging until you are within a gallon or two of your required wort 
 volume.  Then you can just let it run dry but you need to get a feel for how 
 much liquid is held in the grain and essentially lost.

 P.S.  This same article and my response appeared in r.c.b. and although I see 
 no harm in the redundancy, it does make followup a little precarious and 
 convoluted.  As HBD is daily posted to r.c.b, it would make more sense just

Brewthren,


In hbd 1316, James (Tony) Abbott <TABBOTT`at`UGA.CC.UGA.EDU> 
asks about using screw top bottles for homebrew.  I've been
using clear 12-20 oz glass beverage bottles for about half of
each batch (about 40 batches to date.)  since 1986  and
haven't had any trouble with them.  I only use them once, since
the pressure of bottle conditioning tends to "dome up" the caps.


Don't boil the caps, or you'll warp the seals into uselessness.


Advantages:
    Free and easy to obtain.  No problem giving these away.
    Easy to clean. Mineral water bottles are the best.
    Clear glass. 


Disadvantages:
    Clear glass.  No big whoop.  I keep them in a box or bag.
    Dorky labels are difficult to remove.  I just leave them on.


Amusement:
    Aside from the yeast on the bottom, a pint of stout or porter looks 
        just like a bottle of Coke, Diet Coke, etc.


They work for me, but your mileage may vary.
Cheers,

I've been using plastic 2 liter (and 3 liter) Diet Pepsi bottles for years.
I decided to give it a try because I drink 3 or 4 of these a day and had about
20 or more in my office one day and didn't want to toss them. 
They are great for taking my homebrew to parties since:
        a) You don't have to worry about bringing empties home
        b) They hold alot (67 and 100 oz) so you carry less.
        c) If you brew a Porter with light brown foam, you can pretend it's 
           Dt. Pepsi and take it to places you'd not get away with taking
           brew in bottles ;-)    Not that I'd ever do that ;-)


They have never lost pressure (and I've kept a few highly carbonated brews
in them for up to 9 months).


They must however have the plastic screw-top with the liner in tact.  This is
the key to the tight seal.   I'm certain that the aluminum tops are to plyable
to hold the pressure once open (since they deform very easily).


13 - 2 liter bottles will handily hold any of my 7 gallon batches.
     and you only have 13 units to fill not 70+.  


     In my mind, it's the next best thing to kegging.

  Due to the number of requests, here is my recipe:
  
                    Jamaica Blue Mead (5 gallons)
  
     6    lb.  Cover Honey
     1    lb.  Orange Blossom Honey
     1.5  lb.  Corn Sugar
     2    oz.  Fresh, minced Ginger Root
     3    tsp. Ground Cinnamon
     3    tsp. Yeast Extract
     1    gal. Fresh Blueberries
     2    ea.  Lemons, halved
               WYeast #1214 Belgian Ale Yeast
     0.5  cup  Orange Blossom Honey (bottling)
  
  Put honey, corn sugar, and yeast extract in brewpot with water.  Simmer
  for 10 minutes, skimming foam with kitchen strainer.  Add ginger root and
  simmer for 10 more minutes without skimming.  Remove from heat, squeeze
  in lemons, and throw into brewpot.  Cover and let stand for 15 minutes.
  Strain out lemon halves and ginger, add blueberries, chill, pour mixture
  (blueberries and all) into primary fermenter, and pitch yeast.  After 7
  days, rack off of fruit into secondary and age for 1 - 2 months.  When
  fermentation is complete, prepare a "tea" by simmering cinnamon and honey
  in water for 15 minutes in a covered pot.  Cool, add to bottling bucket,
  and quietly siphon in must.  Bottle and age for a couple of months or so.
  
  This makes a nice, light, sparkling beverage that is a brilliantly clear
  rose-purple color.  The flavor is of blueberries kissed with cinnamon.  A
  wonderful change of pace for a summer drink at about 5% alcohol by weight.

Subject: spruce beer




In a recent digest, Michael Jorgensen asked about adding Spruce flavoring to
beer.  I came up with an idea last fall that created a very powerful spruce
flavor.  On my way out of a local canyon I happened upon a Pine Nut stand and,
feeling adventurous, picked up a pound of 'em for my standard amber ale
recipe.  I lightly blended the nuts and added them to the wort for approx.
20 minutes of the boil.  Since the shells are quite acidic, I eliminated
about half of the hops I normally use.  The result was VERY interesting!  The
pine scent and flavor was very strong (like licking a tree) for about a month,
but mellowed with age.  I will try this one again next fall, but will 
probably cut back to about 1/2 a pound per 5 gals.

   Goodmorning/afternoon,
   Just a little blurb on an OPPS! I have just experinced,
   After reading about taking the trub from the secondary and storing it in 
   two quart jar, I decided that this is the ticket to stretch the yeast 
   dollars just a bit.  I know that the "poster" stated that the yeast in the 
   jar would seperate and to pour off the liquid and pitch the yeast.
     So I hurried a bit and did not let the yeast come to room temp and
   set the jar in a pan of luke warm water, Opps! #1  the yeast started rising
   violently and was soon mixed back in the liquid, my wife's idea was to go  
   ahead and pitch the entire amount. Opps! #2
    Six hours after pitching the fermenter was perking away like a locomotive!
   eighteen hours later it settled down to a mild rapid perk, however....
   twentyfour hours later, it was bubbling...  BUBBLING right over the top
   of the airlock and down the fermenter. What a mess, I cleaned out my brew
  locker/fridge and stored the fermenter and after 10 hours the foam had 
  settled and I replaced a clean airlock.  My one question..
    Can this batch be any good?  Do I bottle or tar the driveway?

I agree with most of this, but I'd like to add a couple of comments.  If
you leave the liquid B-Brite uncovered, the "extra" oxygen will evaporate
(probably the wrong term, I'm not a chemist either), and it will no longer 
be capable of sanitizing.  But if the bucket is kept tightly sealed, and 
very full (no headspace for the O2 to evaporate into), most of the H2O2 
should stay intact, in solution.  Remember too that this is a saturated 
solution, so much of the excess O2 could be evaporated with the solution 
still remaining above the recommended sanitizing strength.


While I've never stored glass in the solution, I do store plastics and
rubber in it, and have never seen any indication of the white film.  This
would indicate to me that the mildly acidic H2O2 is still in the solution.
As Al points out, the presence of "slipperiness" may not be a good indication
of the sanitizing ability of the solution; perhaps the presence of the
white film would be a better indicator that the sanitizing agent, the 
H2O2, is no longer present.  In any event, B-Brite is relatively cheap;
when in doubt, make a fresh solution.

All this talk about mead got me thinking:


I just started a batch and I was going to treat it like white wine: rack in
3 weeks and again in three months, bottle after that. (I do want a wine-like
product from this effort.) Or should I rack/bottle sooner? Now you've got me
worried, although hopeful that perhaps the process doesn't take as long as I
thought.


Kit beers: I've been satisfied so far with the taste, but not with the shelf
life. Okay after two weeks, good at four to six weeks, then over-carbonated
and increasingly bitter at two months+. Is it me?


Finally, someone mentioned mint wine. I'm intrigued. Tell me more. Is it
like parsley? The batch I made of that smelled vile at first, but seems to
have mellowed nicely.

Subject: Idea for step-infusion


I have done a few batches of single-temp infusions using British pale malt; last
night I thought I'd try  a step-infusion with Klages 2-row just for the hell of 
it. I believe in a thick mash; therefore I decided that the add-hot-water method
detailed by Papazian was bad. I didn't want to watch the temp in my kettle 
continuously either. That's a pain and wastes heat. My only course of action, or
so I thought, was to build an insulated box. I did it. It worked fine, but I was
a bit frustrated when I thought of the following alternate method. It wouldn't 
have required any extra equipment. I'm surprised this has never been brought up 
before, or discussed in one of the standard texts:


1) Conduct the protein rest on the stove. Temps here can be a bit variable, so 
watching the kettle isn't that intensive. The short time involved means that any
temp-maintenance heat used will be miniscule.


2) Boost the mash to saccharification temp. Nail it just right. Dump it into a 
preheated picnic cooler set up. Proceed as with picnic-cooler single-temp 
infusion.


The only drawback here is that you still can't do a mash-out. I think the 
mash-out is the most debatable part of the process, though, and I've never done 
it. No problems yet.


I'm an avid fan of the round picnic cooler mash/lauter set-up. Cheap, easy, and 
perfectly insulated. I get 30 points extraction, so it's also fine for 
efficiency. Those who have read Miller, who says it's impossible to do 
step-infusion w/a cooler, fear not. I think the above method will work fine and 
I'm going to do it next time. Anyone want an insulated box?

Subject: cooling wort, heating bottles


Regarding cooling wort,


Dave Suurballe says:


"My intuition says that the product of the volume of chilled wort and its
temperature change should equal the product of the volume of coolant and its
temperature change, but that is not the case here.  I don't know why."


You're close.  Energy (in this case heat) is actually the conserved quantity.  
So the product of the specific heat of the wort, the mass of the wort, 
and its temperature change should equal the product of the specific heat 
of the coolant, the mass of the coolant, and its temperature change.


Remember, heat equals heat capacity times temperature change: H=cT.




Regarding baking bottles:


True, foil caps are not air tight, as Chip Hitchcock correctly points out.  
However, remember that for us homebrewers, it is only necessary to sanitize 
equipment, not sterilize (the difference being that sanitizing equipment 
significantly reduces the number of microorganisms and their viability, 
while sterilizing equipment completely eliminates microorganisms). 


On a personal note, since I have begun using this method (nine months to a 
year ago) I have not had an infection.


To whomever related the story of a baked bottle breaking (try saying that 
three times fast), perhaps you cooled the bottle down too quickly?  The name 
of the game here is to reduce thermal stresses by reducing thermal gradients.  
If you cooled it too quickly you may have stressed the bottle.  I typically 
put the bottles in a cold oven, turn it on to ~350F, leave it for ~60 minutes, 
then turn the oven off and let it cool down to ~room temp.

Subject: Water treatment


On the news a few days ago, here in Chicago, there was a story about
how the water department will be adding Phosphate to the water supply
in an effort to reduce lead contamination of water from old lead pipes.
They say it will not change the flavor or color of the water and that
it won't take very long for the remaining lead pipes to develop a
protective coating (Lead Phosphate, I assume) and then they will
discontinue the addition.


I don't suspect that there will be much difference for us Chicagoland
brewers (because there are phosphate compounds in grain), but I'm no
chemist/biologist.  Is there any chance that the additional phosphates
might be a concern for brewing?

A brewer who I respect highly, John Isenhour, wrote me privately, saying that
he believes that having some malt there while boiling the hops, may assist
in isomerization.  I had not read anything about this and had tasted beers
that had additional bitterness added by adding some hop tea (boiled hops
just in water), so I went ahead with my response.  I guess I may have jumped
the gun.  Anyone else have information on this?  References I could read?
Thanks.

50F is much too cold for that yeast (Wyeast American Ale #1056, Siebel
BRY-96).  I've noticed that #1056 really, really slows down at anything
below 62F and loses all of it's ale-like character (esters, etc.).  On
that batch, the yeast took a long, long time doing their biz.  I thought
they were done, but a few months later, they began to overcarbonate.  I
had assumed that this was a bacterial infection (but no other beers brewed
around that time had this problem), but now that you mention it, I'll bet
the yeast went dormant a bit earlier than they would have if they had
fermented the batch at 68F instead of 60F.
