all alcohol is federally taxed, with the exception of cider.
apparrently when the started taxing liquor (how long ago was this ?),
they wanted to exempt small-time mom & pop roadside shops serving hard
cider from all the riagmoroll.  I don't see how grant's can pay back
taxes on something that's not taxed (federally, at least).

According to Noonan ("Scotch Ale"):
"The Scottish malts were sprouted more slowly because of the lower
ambient temp...  Roger Martin of Baired's Station Maltings in Essex
gives [a value of] 6-8 EBC (3-4 SRM) for Scottish Pale, as opposed
to 4-6 EBC (2-3 SRM) for todays English Pale malt."


Are SRM units the same as Lovibond ?

I just finished my last bottle.  This year's includes spruce essence.
Most spruce brews I've tasted (not that many) have tasted absolutely
horrid at near-freezing temps, but are great once you let them warm
up a little.  1993 Anchor X-mas ale is no exception.

Why use honey as a starting medium?
(OK, it's fair to reply, "Why not?")


Honey (light honey in particular) tends not to have a lot of anything other
than simple sugars.  But, as I mentioned in an earlier note, looking at it
from a different aspect (what yeast to use for mead), my experience is
making me believe that some yeasts, particularly beer/ale yeasts, are just
not suitable for mead.  They produce an off taste in the young mead that
takes a long time to age out.  I certainly don't have conclusive evidence
for this--it's just that, so far, certain yeasts have given me trouble
every time I've used them in meads, while others produce consistently good
results.  So perhaps you're experiencing the same effect from your honey-
based starters with ale yeasts as I'm seeing with mead-making and certain
classes of yeast?


>...I've had

Can you be sure that there's an actual difference, as opposed to just the
effect of darker/stronger beers masking the off-taste?  (Is it obvious
enough that you'd know?)

Subject: Dry Hopping, Using Yeast from Primary


On my fourth batch I decided to try dry hopping (it is an IPA) for aroma.
Could someone let me know if I am following standard/proper procedures for
this as I can not find anything in TCJOHB to give me directions.  I racked
from the primary to the secondary but before doing so ground up 1/2 oz of
Cascade into fine particles and paced it into the bottom of the secondary.
The problem as I see it is that 1) there is a chance of contamination due
to no boiling of the hops, and 2) all of the hops floated to the top of the
carboy as it was filling which made a mess of the carboy neck and doesn't 
appear to get full utilization of what I put in.  We bottled the beer this 
weekend and it seems fine (tasty actually).  Am I doing this correctly???


Secondly, although I know this has been discussed (i missed some of it), can
anyone give me step by step procedures for reusing yeast that comes out of 
the primary or secondary?  What are the problems that may occur?  How many 
times can you repitch the same yeast culture?  How can you store the yeast
and for how long.  I have just recently started using liquid yeasts and if 
possible would like to get a little more millage out of them.


Thanks in advance.

Subject: Ipswich Ale


This is probably only of interest to those in Boston's North Shore area
but I don't know how extensive their distribution really is:


I just bought some Ipswich Ale yesterday (it comes in a 1/2 gal.
'growler') and there is a significant yeast sediment on the bottom, ~
1/16 of an inch.  Has anybody brewed with it?  It certainly is a lot
more yeast than I get in a Wyeast packet.  If you return the bottle, is
only $1 more AND you get a 1/2 gal of pretty tasty ale too!  I'll
probably try it in a Porter this weekend but was wondering if anyone out
there had any more info on it.

Though my reply is a little out of place in this forum, I feel obliged to
defend my home turf  :-)


Sherlock's is a British-style brewpub.  As such, their ales are cask-
conditioned, not highly carbonated, and hand pulled with a beer engine.  
Also, all of their ales are relatively low OG (i.e. 1.040-1.046) - which
is also in the British style, as has been noted by several recent postings
to this forum (most notably by Bob Jones).


If the beers lack a certain oomph, it is because the style lacks a certain
oomph, at lease by high-alcohol American Ale standards. (though how Sherlock's
bitter, with `at`40 IBU's, lacks 'oomph', I do not know.... :-)  )

        Has anyone ever taken homebrew on an airliner?
        I am planning a ski trip to Colorado this February and plan
        to bring some homebrew.  I was considering using PET bottles for the
        simplicity and saftey.  Will they stand up to the pressure
        changes at 37,000 feet in a presurized cabin?  Has anyone
        taken them in the unpressurized baggage compartment?  Will they freeze?
        Should I allow for expansion in filling?  I counterpressure bottle
        off of keg's so I have filling options.

I have had great success using a 5 micron polypro cartridge filter.  I 
just filtered 3 corn. kegs of Mt. Hood strong ale, and the filtered beer
was quickly judged vastly superior to the unfiltered, by my biased panel
of homebrew quaffers.  DE filters make a lot of sense for big brewers, 
but I feel it is out of place for 99+% of the homebrewing folks.  The
DE is not very user friendly, it should be handled with respirator masks,
and requires a fairly complex filtering setup.  DE must be "precoated" on
the filtering plate, so some means of recircing the turbid beer is required.
I can assure you that losing character is not an issue with a coarse 5
micron filter, but it can be a issue when micro-filtering.


I have found a bulk supplier of FDA 5 micron polypro filters.  The cost is
about 1/3 of retail.  Problem: minimum order is 30!  Anyone in netland want
to get in on a co-op purchase?

Anyone use DORIC yeast?  I reckon this is the name.  I just picked some
up from my local shop.  It is dry yeast in 5 gm packets.  I bought 3 of

To Worry, wait or to take action:


This is my first homebrew batch ever.  It has been in the bottles
for six (6) days.  The first two bottles I opened have very
little carbonation.  The facts are:


* Extract kit, "American Steam Beer".
* One week in primary, three weeks in secondary.
* Fermented at about 52 degrees F.
* When bottled, very little in any bubbles from the airlock.
* Beer tastes good (if not pretty darn good) but is flat and a little on
the sweet side (unfermented sugars, including primer?).
* Bottles filled to 1/2 inch of top and sitting at about 52 degrees F.
* Primed with 3/4 cup corn sugar in boiled (cooled) water.
* Kit says it produces 5 gallons but I got about 4 gallons (I was
not to careful about adding water after the boil).
* Did not take hydrometer readings (I know I should and will keep
better notes next time...I promise).  There is alchohol in there
based on my internal hydrometer.


If I were given to worrying, I might think:


* Little or no yeast in bottles (yeast settled out very well in
secondary).
* I killed the critters (but how?).
* I've introduced a CO2 sucking infection which eats bubbles and
flattens beer (I bet pond scum would do the trick, though there
is very little of this in my kitchen since the fire).
* I am impatient and should wait one full month (Miller
in his book says that the CO2 forms very quickly but takes time
to dissolve in beer.  It is hard to believe the little psssst sound
when I open the bottles in all the CO2 that is needed waiting around
to dissolve.  How long does it take for the priming sugar to ferment?


Should I:
* Wait and not worry and have a store-bought (this is my first batch).
* Store the bottles at a warmer temp, say 65 F.(what, if any, dangers).
* Buy more yeast, make a starter, pry caps off and eye-dropper in
some yeast and recap (court of last resort).
* Scrub down the walls of my kitchen and wash the curtains in bleach?


Just a little "relax, it will be alright" from my learned, more 
experienced digesters may be all I need (this is in fact what my
learned colleague and fellow worker, Jim Grady has offered).

Hi all
This is my first post, and I'm not completely sure our gateway is fully 
functional, so here's hoping!
Reading the Rims Summary in Docs on Sierra, one post in the thread really 
intrigued me.  I have build the standard Morris Rims unit, and the 
temperature control (esp calibration of same) is the big problem.  On 
1/24/92, a Dave Pike posted an alternative approach using a Motorola 68hc11. 
 The details were too sketchy for me (a non-EE) to figure out.  I sent E 
mail to his address, but no joy.  Maybe he's no longer there, maybe our 
gateway is ####### again.
Has anyone built his device?  Does anyone have at least a conceptual diagram 
with pin numbers?  I'd love to build it and report on it, if only I could 
get some guidance.
Thanks in advance,
Mike McCaw

Subject: sanitation


While trying not to worry, sanitizing my counterflow chiller is still a
concern.  I have been running sanitizer through it prior to each batch
with no rinse, but over time imagine a material build up in it not removed
by a simple rinse afterwards.  I have been daunted by the propect of adequate
rinse following use of hydroxide flush, so have not tried that.  But the
thought occurred to me, why not just run the boiling wort through for a
bit before turning on the cold water flow?  The immediate question is how
to avoid HSA?  If the wort were collected with minimum splash and then
put back to reheat prior to final cooling would that be too much oxygen?
George how much is too much? Has anyone else tried this?

Subject: Does HSA flavor go away with time ?


I recently brewed a batch of Papazian's Monkey's Paw Brown Ale. It 
has an off flavor which I am not sure of, so I am asking for help.  
This is only my 5th batch, but it is the first one I am having real 
trouble drinking.  The flavor started as sort of a metallic flavor, 
and now I _might_ describe it as the infamous wet 
cardboard flavor, except I've never tasted wet cardboard.  The 
fermentation seemed to go normally and I did a secondary rack for 
about 2 weeks before bottling. I don't think it is an infection.  
I used Edme yeast. 
I didn't do anything to treat the water. NOW I have a water report 
telling me (in short)
pH        7.56
Calcium     82 ppm
Magnesium   48 ppm 
Alkalinity 291 ppm
Sulfate            59 ppm
While this wasn't the most grains I had mashed before, it was my first
actual all-grain batch,so I suspect water may be playing a more 
important role.  The flavor _is_ mellowing a bit, but slowly.
Any guesses to what caused this? Basically do you think it was the
water (any suggestions on how people would treat this water are
greatly appreciated), or do you think it was oxidation? Further, if
it were oxidation (or HSA) would that go away with time, as this seems
to be doing? 
Thanks alot for any advice or comments.

Subject: BURP CASTLE - NYC


On a recent trip to New York City over the holidays, I was pleasantly
surprised to find an interesting bar called "Burp Castle".  A sign on
the window proclaims it to be the "Temple of Beer Worship".  It is operated
by the "Brewist Monks".  These guys, who are the bartender and waiters,
walk around in brown, floor-length monk's robes with ropes tied around
the waist.


All they serve is draft beer at a rather steep price of about $5.00 for
a 16 oz. glass which isn't too bad for NYC.  Some of the brews on-tap are
Old Foghorn, Paulaner Hefe-weiss, Pete's Wicked Ale, Pilsner Urquel and
Sierra Nevada Christmas Ale.  Some very tasty brews.


The walls are all covered with hand painted scenes of the Middle Ages and
there are signs up everywhere proclaiming "No Loud Talking - Whispering
Only".  Of course, loud talking and boisterous beer drinking prevailed.


If you are in NYC, I would recommend stopping in here for a cold one.  Their
address is 41 East 7th Street and phone is (212) 982-4576.


Another neat place is right next door called "Brewski's".  I didn't stop in,
but it looked like a beer drinkers paradise of unique and exotic bottled
and canned beers.


DISCLAIMER: I have nothing to do with either of these establishments.

It is my understanding that you cannot MAIL homebrew. I have had no problems,
however, using UPS to SHIP homebrew. I regularly send a 12 bottle box to by

I am on a regular UPS route and therefor don't have to tell them the contents
of my box. If you drop your shipment off at a UPS office or use a third party
shipper (ie. Mail Box Etc., Mail Box Plus, and the like) they may ask you
the contents. I have heard of people who have had their beer refused by 
the clerks. They told me that they list the contents as "yeast cultures" 
or "brewing supplies"


I also place each bottle in 1 gal ziplock bag as insurance, but I have not
had any leaks in 10+ shipments.

I have another problem (I think) with my latest beer.


I thought I had a yeast infection in my last beer (Righteous Real Ale from
Papazian's book), but I have the same thing going on with my latest, and have
been very sanitary.  I used Papazian's Doctor Bock (P. 203 TNCJoH) and added
1/2 lb of chocolate malt for a darker color.  I used 1.5oz and .5oz of Tettang.
hops.  My first two beers turned out great, but the last two have acted the
same.  The difference?  In the last two I used grains for coloring.


        Here's what I did:  I put the choc. malt in a malt bag, and worked
like a tea bag until the water started to boil.  I put the malt syrup into
the pot, and boiled 45 min.  I set it outside (20F) OH! Could that be my
problem with yeast infection?  The lid was only open a little.  After it
cooled,I mixed the wort with water to make 5gal.  I let it ferment, half in one
5gal bucket, and 5gal in another.  Yeast was pitched.


Here's what happened:  3 Jan 94    1.063 `at` 65F  (pitched yeast)
                       15 hours    Bubbles begin
                       48 hours    Bubbles stop, rack to carboy. 1.028
                       3 days      1 bubble/minute
                       5 days      1 bubble/36 sec
                       6 days      1 bubble/22 sec
                       7 days      1 bubble/18 sec


When the beer was first in the carboy, it seemed almost clear burnt amber,
but now its more cloudy with the more active fermentation.


Question:   Yeast infection?


Thanks much...    Aaron

My boss and I (both of us are chemists) talked about this very type of 
cooler.  Our reasons were the same as Bob's.  Easy, good heat transfer etc


We then did some quick, "back of the envelope" type calculations and 
discovered that one would need at least 80# of ice to cool a 5 gal. batch 
from boiling to 15 deg.C (60 deg.F).  We did not take into account that 
the wort contained a high concentration of sugar.  This would increase 
the density of the liquid and also increase its heat capacity, ie. one 
would need even more than 80# of ice.  


I ended up building an inexpensive (less that $15) counter current cooler.

     for 8 days and I'm still getting a bubble every 30 seconds.

Greetings all,


        I had a chance to talk to one of my old friends (and
 a homebrewer) over the holidays and we were talking about
 dry hopping.  He mentioned that it might be interesting to
 try bottle hopping--that is, adding hops (one or two leaves,
 perhaps) directly to the bottle.
        Has anybody heard of or tried this before?  Outside of possible
 contamination from the hops, would it add some negative aspect to the
 beer that we aren't considering?
         On another note, I was wondering about culturable/non-culturable
 commercial brews.  That is, has somebody compiled a list of commercial
 brews which one can get the yeast out of?  I mean, I know of some, and
 trial and error could work, but is there a definitive list floating 
 around out there?
        Finally, I live in balmy Ithaca, NY, where its been getting
 down below zero at night.  My housemate left a six of Saranac Black 
 and Tan on the back porch, and of course it froze.  This got me to 
 wondering:  What does freezing beer like this do to it?  None of the
 bottles exploded, so I'll probably try and drink them to see for myself,
 but I was wondering if there was some study or discussion of this 
 previously which I missed.

Subject: Chocolate Porter Ferment Lag


I just brewed up a batch of choc. porter for the 2nd time and I have experienced
very late starting fermentations.   I pitch a healthy starter that is no differe
nt from what I usually pitch.  In fact, this one was a 2nd pitch from a
currently fermenting batch of golden ale (ie. very healthy and active).


I thought my 1st chocololate porter was a fluke but now I am concerned about
the chocolate impact on fermentation.   In a 5 gallon batch I used 8 oz of
Hershey's cocoa and 8 oz. of unsweetened baker's chocolate.   This was
added in the last 30 min. of the boil.   It is also an all-grain.


Any of the same experiences from you people?!  I actually started worrying
