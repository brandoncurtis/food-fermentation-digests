There will always be some small number of bacteria and molds, but I am
quite sure that the numbers inside a bottle of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale
are no worse than in a non-autoclaved starter that the average homebrewer
might brew up.  If there were a significant number of bacteria or molds,
then the SNPA would have tasted bad too.  I have made starters from SNPA
bottles many times, but now I usually just use Wyeast #1056 because, well,
I guess, just because I didn't have any SNPA handy one time and I used
the Wyeast instead.

It sounds as if you are not sanitizing the starter and thus your problem
might be because you are introducing a wild yeast into your fermentation.
Starters must be very, very clean (biologically speaking) because a small
problem in a starter becomes a big problem in your primary.  The other
thing I see a problem with, is that you are using honey as a sugar source.
Honey does not have the nutrients (amino acids, aka FAN) for good yeast
growth.  Also, you do not mention aeration.  I suggest you use light, dried,
unhopped malt extract, about one ounce dry weight per 16 ounce starter,
boil it well, cool it before aerating, make sure it is at room temperature
before adding room temperature liquid yeast and maintain sanitation
very carefully.

>        o Wyeast 2112 California Lager yeast


You should rehydrate dry yeast before adding it to a starter.  It is much
more difficult for dry yeast to reabsorb water from even a low-gravity
starter than from plain water.  Boil up some water, cool it to between
104F and 110F and then add the dry yeast.  You can let the yeast rehydrate
for between 15 and 30 minutes and then pitch or you can slowly cool the
rehydrating yeast down to the temperature of your starter and then add
the yeast to the starter.

Did the yeast take a long time to settle out?  Was the beer cloudy?
Did the yeast cake at the bottom of the bottles easily stir up?

Dear All:


My choices for dry yeasts are:
         Red Star Ale
        Llelemand Nottingham Ale
Others have recommended: 
        Edme
        Cooper's


I would avoid the Whitbread dry. I (and others) have experienced odd 
aftertastes when using this yeast.


As the editor of the yeast FAQ (and a brewer of ales), I would like to 
know other peoples opinions on the dry yeasts and which types are widely
available. The best e-mail address for me is now weix`at`netcom.com.


A new yeast FAQ is in the works, and it will contain all the new
Wyeast info (annotated by Al Z!, thanks Al).


UV Sterilization of Bottles:
ZZZZZZZTT. Sorry, next contestant please. :-)
Glass in general, and colored glass in particular, is very effective
at screening out UV rays. You would have to put a bulb in each bottle!
Not very efficient. However, we do have a lovely copy of our home game....

Diatomaceous earth is the silicified skeletons of microscopic algae.
I don't know how you would use it in filtering beer but I do know it is
sometimes used in pool filters.  So if it can get the crud out of pools it
should get it out of your wort.

The FAQ referred to is not yet available, but the kernel of what it
will become is on sierra.stanford.edu in
/pub/homebrew/docs/kegging_info.  Here is the first few lines and
thanks to Alan for inspiring the FAQ.  My apologies to all of you for
the FAQ taking so long, but I have been busier at work than
anticipated when I volunteered to do it and it is *much* larger a task
that I could have imagined.  (I know, some of you are saying, "I don't
want apologies, I want the *(&^*(%^& FAQ" ).  Alan's treatise is
excellent and is going to be prominent in the FAQ.  The rest of the
FAQ is planned as a large expansion of what he has already and will
also address topics he has not covered.

        Getting Started Guide - Homebrew Kegging

 I have seen the light, and it is made of stainless steel....


 Greetings. After having asked several dozen stupid questions about kegging,
I have decided that I should pull all of this information together into one
article for the amusement and edification of the Digest.

Any size CO2 tank is OK from 2.5 lb on up.  It just depends on how
much you are planning on using it.  I have a 20 lb. tank and it has
dispensed 8 kegs and done lots of CP filling and purging of equipment
(much more use that most people do with just dispensing).  


Yes, you must have a regulator.  Kegs blow up over 130 psi and the CO2
bottle pressure is generally around 750 psi depending on the
temperature.  


You adjust pressure with the regulator.  If you need to release
pressure, make up a quick disconnect fitting for the gas side with no
hose.  Put it on and it will release pressure mighty quick, or take a
Philips screwdriver and poke the valve body.  


One of the best supplied and most helpful suppliers of kegging
paraphenalia is BrauKunst 1-800-972-2728.  Order their pamphlet for
about $1.50 or so on how to use kegging stuff.  Or just talk to them
to find out exactly what you need.  


Alan Richer's treatise is pretty detailed in the "getting started"
arena, so be sure to get that.

Subject: Re: BURP CASTLE - NYC


Just a few additional biased comments on "the Castle", one of few things I
will miss after my move to the Left Coast.


Tom writes in HBD 1321: "All they serve is draft beer..." 


On the contrary, Burp Castle aside from having good beers on tap, Also has an
extremely large selection of exotic bottled beers. It's the NY mecca of
Belgian beer with beers ranging from Artevelde to St. Sixtus. Get your
cultures here!


It IS expensive ($5 for Celis Grand Cru to $41 for 3 lt. of Duvel!), but what
the hey, it's cheaper than  a trip to Belgium. 
I do recommend anyone who happens to be in Lower Manhattan to drop by, Just
to sip a pint while checking out the Bruegel-inspired murals. Hell, if you
don't like it, you can go next door to Brewsky's. Owned by the same guy, with
lots of other beers to try (seems the Castle only gets Belgian, French and
Swiss beers while Brewsky's gets those and in addition, other Int'l stuff.)
Weird. Oh yeah, Brewsky's plays Rock music whilst you'll get Harpsichords at
the Castle.


AND if you don't like that, you can at least go down the street to McSorley's
Old Ale House (Lincoln supposedly drank there). 3 hour wait on week-ends, I
dunno why. (Avoid flying kegs.) If you make it in, try the "Cheese and Onion"
platter, it'll make for a memorable night.


Cheers and be well,

Oh, and I too have no $$$ interest in these places though I'll gladly join
anyone for a round if anyone's making a beer tour of NYC!

>Has anyone tried this or does anyone have any opinions about it?


I've done this several times, mostly in the summer when my tap
water is warm.  As far as sanitation I simply baked the entire
coil in the oven for about 1/2 hour at 400F.  It is very
efficient (timewise) and I've cooled 5 gallons to 60F in 15
minutes, and this time could probably be decreased.  The main
disadvantage is the amount of ice required.  A rule of thumb is
to use about as much ice as wort you need to cool.  In the
winter (if its cold in your climate) this may not be a problem,
otherwise you'll have to freeze and store (or buy) about 5
gallons of ice (about 43 pounds). 


For a more precise formula as to how much ice is needed if


    Tw = temperature of wort 
    Vw = volume of wort
    Ti = temperature of ice
    Vi = volume of ice


then the equilibrium temperature Tt (of the melted ice and wort)
is 


    Tt = (Tw*Vw + (0.453*Ti - 73)*Vi) / (Vi + Vw)


where I have assumed that the equilibrium state is liquid and
the wort and water have the same thermal properties.
In this formula, 0.453 is the ratio of heat capacities  of ice
to water,  and 73 is the value for the latent heat required to
change ice to water divided by the heat capacity of water.
For example, if Tw=212F, Vw=5gal, Ti=10F (typical for freezers),
and Vi=5gal, then Tt=52F.  You could also solve for Vi given
atarget temperature Tt using


   Vi = (Tw - Tt)*Vw / (73 + Tt -.453*Ti)


or if we take Ti=0C, Tw=100C and say Tt=15.5C (60F) then


   Vi = Vw * (100-15.5)/(73+15.5) = Vw * 84.5 / 88.5 


or slightly less ice than water.  Of course the ice water bath
should be stirred constantly so no thermal layers form. 
A similar design is described in a Zymurgy issue about 1 1/2
years ago, but also didn't say how much ice you need.  


Also in HBD1321

I think this is an over-estimate, based not only on my
calculations but on my experience with this type of chiller.

Subject: Dry hopping rate in cornelius kegs


I recently cranked out yet another batch/variation of brown ale, accept
this time, i did not add any finishing hops.  Right now, the brew is
in the fermenter (brewed it sunday night).  I used 2oz of cascase for the
boil, 2 cans of M&F light, and assorted adjunct grains (choco malt, crystal,
roasted barley).


I want to dry-hop when I keg, and I'm wondering the appropriate amount
of hops to use.  This will be for 4-5 gals - not sure if I'm going to bottle
one gallon of it or not.  I expect to condition it for 2-4 weeks, depending
how fast I consume the keg ahead of it (3 gals).  I'm thinking of 1oz
of kent goldings (plug) in a muslin bag.  Too much?  Too little?  I like a
good hop aroma, so I don't want to be timid with the dry-hop addition.


Any recommendations/advice welcome via the digest or personal mail.

I prefer to use whole flowers, and not to damage them prior to addition to
the fermenter.  Just use the good ol copper or SS scrubby pad over the
end of the racking cane to tranfer the still beer from the hops.  Dont
worry about them floating to the top, as long as they are wet, they will
do the trick.  I also seem to prefer the character/aroma from dry hopping
better than that from Cask hopping.

Be *very* careful with this.  Some of the beers I sampled in the Boston
area had quite notable fermentation defects, which no doubt originate
from the yeast.  Be sure to grow a small sample, and ferment it out 
for a taste test prior to using in a full batch.

Greetings:
        
        Is it "good" to boil the whole volume of H20 when making extract
based beers?  The reason I ask is if it is good ( to remove all O2 ?) then why
turn around after the wort has cooled and aerate the whole mess again - in 
effect undoing what the boil has done.


Also, has anyone had success using malt extract to prime with?  I would like
to try using dried extract, but have no clue how much extract = 1 cup corn
sugar.




Thanks,


Michael

 Re:  Wort Chiller in ice bucket


Chris Slack posted regarding the 'ice in bucket' chiller.
Well, not to dispute your calculations, but I built that
chiller and used it for a while, and I never used no 80
lbs of ice.  I was doing partial mashes and extract batches
at the time, and my boils were probably in the 3-4 gallon
range.  I'd fill the bucket with ice and water, and the
wort coming out of the chiller was probably in the 50 deg
F temperature range.  I used to have to augment the ice
near the end when most of it had melted.


The reason I switched to a conventional immersion chiller
was twofold:


a) I originally used 1/4" flexible tubing, and I found
   the combination of the viscosity of the chilled wort,
   the trub formed in the tubing, and various hop bits
   made the siphoning VERY slow, and sometimes halted it
   altogether.  I'd end up perching my kettle precariously
   atop a stack of bucket's etc. in a desperate attempt
   to increase the head.


b) I was nervous about my ability to adequately sanitize
   the inside of the tubing.


I thought of remaking the chiller with bigger tubing, but
had difficulty justifying the expenditure, given that the
immersion chiller works fairly well.  I have thought of
putting a small ice bucket chiller inline with my immersion
chiller to 'pre-cool' the tap water, but that won't be
necessary till summer.  Currently, our tapwater is already
dangerously close to freezing ;).


Cheers, Rick C.

 To Worry, wait or to take action:


 This is my first homebrew batch ever.  It has been in the bottles
 for six (6) days.  The first two bottles I opened have very
 little carbonation.  The facts are:
[stuff deleted ] 
 * Beer tastes good (if not pretty darn good) but is flat and a little on
 the sweet side (unfermented sugars, including primer?).


If the beer tatses good but sweet, and it's only been six days, 
then you can be 99% confident that the beer just needs more time.
I think you have the right diagnosis below...


 * I am impatient and should wait one full month (Miller
 in his book says that the CO2 forms very quickly but takes time
 to dissolve in beer.  It is hard to believe the little psssst sound
 when I open the bottles in all the CO2 that is needed waiting around
 to dissolve.  How long does it take for the priming sugar to ferment?


I store my bottles at about 64 F, and I usually get good carbonation
in about ten days.  your mileage may vary, as will your expectations
of how much carbonation you want. 


 Should I:
 * Wait and not worry and have a store-bought (this is my first batch).
 * Store the bottles at a warmer temp, say 65 F.(what, if any, dangers).
 * Buy more yeast, make a starter, pry caps off and eye-dropper in
 some yeast and recap (court of last resort).
 * Scrub down the walls of my kitchen and wash the curtains in bleach?


Definitely follow the first course of action, immediately if not sooner.
Just make sure it's one with a bottle you can use for homebrew!
If you're really impatient, move a sixpack of bottles to a warmer temp
such as the 65F you suggest.  That's still a relatively cool temperature
for beer, and it isn't likely to harm it at all, IMHO.  I would recommend
lowering your standards before considering sucha a drastic move as 
yeast injection and recapping.  If you have yeast in there, as evidenced
by the existing level of carbonation, adding more isn't likely to help.
I'd recommend the last course of action, sanitizing the kitchen, only if
you have a spouse or are expecting your mother to drop in unannounced. ;->


Relax. Don't worry.  Have a Homebrew! (OK - Storebought, but just this
once) ;->

Is there a list on the net of malt extract syrups, dry malt extracts, and

My HB store has info about some extracts but very little about grains.


Maybe this should be in a FAQ?  (Yeast, Hops, ....Malt ....Water)


3)The difference between two row and six row barley is that when barley is
grown there develops two spikelets with seeds at each joint in the case of
two row and six seeds at each joint in six row.  The two forms are different
varieties of malt plants.  The amount of conversion enzymes depends on among
other things the % germination, time temperature and conditions of malting,
and extent the grains are malted.

I thought of the same type of chiller design.  And I believe one was
mentioned in HBD before.  Using SNOW instead of ice.  Lots of it around here.
 However, I would  loop the copper coil in and then out of the cold bath and
then empty into my carboy avoiding the holes and seals in the sides of the
bucket.  I would use 1/4 in tubing to keep the flow rate low and the heat
transfer high.  (We use 1/4 in tubing for cooling our equipment an it is
efficient.)


>The disadvantages are that sanitation of the coil may be difficult


Yes but it is easier to make than a CF Chiller.

STEVE SCAMPINI IN HBD #1321 ASKS ABOUT FLAT BEER. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. I 
BREWED A MUNICH HELLES WHICH I STORED IN MY GARAGE (ABOUT 40 DEGREES) AFTER

THE BEER INTO THE WARMEST ROOM IN MY HOUSE (1ST FLOOR LAUNDRY ROOM ABOUT 72

I have found that some airports are more leanant than others. I've had
no problem going through metal detectors in the BWI or MSP (Balt/Wash and

and had *vigorous* fermentation within 12 hours.  Questions for

I have a question concerning trub, hot-break and cold break. I've been
brewing for 3 years and haven't had too may problems but I have never
found practical definitions on these three terms. Is there a difference
between trub and hot-break? Like I said, I don't think I have problems
with my procedures but would like to run them by you all just for a
sanity check. I use an immersion wort-chiller to cool my wort in the kettle.
I then dump it into my primary (plastic) from about three feet high so as 
to "areate" in a crude fashion. I'm careful to leave what I beleive to be
the trub/hot-break in the kettle (about a 1/2 gallon of spent hops etc.)
I then just pitch the yeast starter and sometimes yeast "energizer" and
seal-er-up. I usually move to a secondary glass carboy after a week or
so. Am I leaving it sit on cold-break by doing this. Should I move it after
24 hours ala Miller? Any comments would be appreciated. Either post here
or via private email (mstickler`at`lvh.com).


***********************************************************************
Another point not totally brewing related. A while back I posted a tread
on acidic H2O at my house. I got several responses concerning the fact
that copper pipes and lead solder could be contaiminating my H2O. Well
I quickly called in several water specialists and one was very good. He 
spent a 1/2 hour conducting various tests on my H2O and concluding all I 
needed was a Acid Nuetralizer (Cost $1,100.00 installed and $60.00/year to
maintain). The other guy, however, did not conduct a single test. Said it
was not necessary since he was very familiar with the H2O in my area.
He concluded that although I have soft water, the Acid Nuetralizer has
the by-product of turning your H20 hard so I would also need a water
softener. In addition, since I have a spring (the reason the H20 is acid
to begin with thanks to acid rain) I should have one of those florescent
bacteria zappers. He also suggested replacing my cold water storage tank
and pump. Total cost, almost $4,000.00. No way! However, I'm curious if
the Acid Nuetralizer does make your H20 harder. Does anyone know? I 
think they said it uses Calcium or Magnesium in one form or another, I
can't remember right now. In any case, always get a second opinion.

You should try Northeast Brewers Supply of Providence, RI. They have British
Pale Malted Barley at $33.00 for 55lb bag. Their telephone number is
1-800-352-9001. All their prices are very good. However, they used to be
my principal source of HB supplies but have since, IMHO gone way down
hill in terms of customer service. Neither I, my two brothers or my friend
use them anymore, although the prices are tempting. I think they expanded
so rapidly that something had to suffer, unfortunately it was the customer.

It is my understanding that Marzen is German for March, which is the time
of year that Oktoberfest is brewed, then stored for the summer, and then
broke out for Oktoberfest. Spaten's is one of the best (IMO).

Recent remarks about "yeasty" off-flavors in beers using
honey-fed starters note the sugar content (eg, "light honey
containing mostly simple sugars). True enough, but recall
that the pollen from which it was made, the chemical
processing and environment of the hive (bee saliva, etc)
all contribute to the manufacture of a very complex product.
Wild airborne yeasts, digestive enzymes, esthers, etc are
all present in the finished honey. Even though yeast/enzyme
viability will have been nullified by pasturization, you
still have quite a flavorful soup of smaller protein struc-
tures in company with the simple sugars. One is advised
against feeding a baby honey until the child is at least
12 mos. old--ie, until the immune system has matured
sufficiently to deal with such histamines (among numerous
other things possibly not conducive to a clean finish in a
grain beer) that will certainly be present.
