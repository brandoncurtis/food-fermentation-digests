Subject: Miscellany


          A couple of notes on threads: (sorry, work's been 
          interfering with my life, and these are a bit out-of-date, 
          maybe):
          
          Someone asked about plastic carboys. I've started using the 
          five-gallon kind and am pleased so far. I got it by paying a 
          $7 deposit and buying 5 gallons of  "spring" water at a 
          local water shop. Only one of the water dealers in the area 
          would do this--the rest wanted me to sign contracts to have 
          water delivered to my office for the next century before 
          they'd let me take out a plastic jug. 
                I went to the plastic carboy after I broke my second 
          glass carboy, dropped it 3 inches to the cement basement 
          floor and it shattered. It was partly a matter of 
          have-five-homebrews-relax-five-times-and-fumble-finger-while
          -cleaning-the-carboy, but also I find that a strong chlorox 
          solution makes the surface of the carboy very slippery. If I 
          ever get glass again, I'm also going to buy a pair of those 
          gloves that NFL wide-receivers wear.
                The plastic carboy is working okay, but it's not as 
          nice to use as glass--you can't see through and watch the 
          trub settling or the bubbles burping as nicely. I also think 
          the plastic is harder to clean than glass, but that's hard 
          to tell.
                another thread...
                I saw someone was bad-mouthing Freshops out in Oregon 
          and I just wanted to say that I put in my first order a 
          couple months ago and was very happy with service and 
          product both. The guy on the phone told me up front about 
          the "handling" charge, so it was no surprise. I'll order 
          from them again. And, of course, 
          no-commercial-involvement-whatsoever-except-for- 
          the-half-mill-invested-in-the-company-and-my-obligation-

          is-away-doing-whatever-it-is-that-hop-owners-do-that-makes-
          their-wives-so-lonely-etcetera-etcetera.
                another thread...
                If someone is re-doing the yeast-faq, a good piece of 
          information for some of us would be a comment of performance 
          at non-ideal temperatures. Like many, my brewery is in the 
          basement and I can't even hope to control temperature even 
          if I wanted. I use mostly California Lager and Canadian Ale 
          yeasts (sorry don't have the brands & numbers at hand) 
          because the lager works well at higher-than-lager temps and 
          the ale works well at lower-than-ale temps. I would like to 
          try other yeasts but hate to invest the money if they're not 
          going to work well or work at all, besides which my supply 
          can barely keep up with the demand as is, and if I have one 
          ruined batch I'll have to go squander money on store-bought.
                And, thanks to all for all the good, interesing 
          threads & thoughts on HBD, a good way to start the work-day.

Subject: calculation of specific gravity


I am looking for charts, tables, etc. on how to calculate specific gravity for 
different combinations of malt extract, spray dried malt, specialty grains, 
adjuncts, batch size, etc. For example, if I brew an X gallon batch with Y lbs 
of malt extract, Z lbs spray dried malt and W lbs of 2 kinds of specialty 
grains how does one calculate what the specific gravity SHOULD be. Does anybody 
know of any good references that could provide this? TNCJOHB gives a VERY 
limited discussion of this in one of the appendices but it is not sufficient 
for most cases.


TIA and brew on my friends!

Subject: Pumpkin "Stout"


Here is a recipe that I formulated as an experiment/modification of a
previous recipe that I posted.  I had intended it to be a stout, but
wimped out on the larege amounts of roasted barley and other dark malts
necessary for the style at the last minute.  Here is the recipe


2 cans (29 ounces each) of libby's 100% Pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)
8 oz Flaked Barley
4 oz Belg. Special B
6 oz 60 L Caramel (Briess)
3 oz Chocolate Malt
2 oz Roasted Barley
1 3.3 lb can DMS diastatic malt extract
"Mashed" above ingredients at 150 F (65 C) for 30 mins, then sparged
through grain bag.  A real mess.  Final volume = ca.3 gallons
Added 3.3 lbs of Amber Briess Extract  and commenced boiling.  
Hops/Spicing
1 oz Northern brewers Plugs 7.5% 60 mins
0.5 oz styrian goldings 5.3% 30 mins
0.5 oz Hallertauer Hersbrucker 2.9% 10 mins
1 cinnamon stick (2 inches or so)
0.25 tsp coriander, ground
0.25 tsp cardamom, ground
0.5 tsp ginger, ground


All spices were added with the Hallertauer Hops in the last 10 mins.


O.G. = ???  (Thank goodness Ive got my computer now so that I can stop
trying to read my own handwritten notes.)


F.G. = 1.015 (Fairly thick stuff)


Yeast was Red Star Ale Yeast, rehydrated in some cooled boiled wort.
Beer was kegged/force carbonated and almost completely gone in one
evening of Christmas partying.


NB:  Canned pumpkin dissolves into a horrendously fine mush that will
settle to the bottom of your primary and cause you to lose up to 1
gallon or more (it does not firmly settle out.)  Are the results worth
it?  I think so, but I will only do 2 or 3 pumpkin brews a year for the
holidays, because it is messy.  I would think that using fresh, cooked
pumpkin cut into 1" cubes or so might strain out better, or they might
break down in the mash to a consistency similar to the canned stuff.
Anyone try this.


On a similar note:  The leftover beer was left in the keg in my unheated
garage and froze.  Is this detrimental to the beer?  I have not tasted i
t since I got back.


On a dissimilar note:  Where does one obtain agar for culturing yeast?

I have a 1/4 keg at home.  I would like to use this for some of my beer if
I am having a party or going camping.  To put beer into the keg, I will need
to remove the bung on the side.  Where can I get new bungs, and how are
they installed.  Also, how long does beer ferment when it is kegged.

Subject:  SNPA Yeast /Culture Question


The following is written in response to some recent postings 
questioning the integrity of the SNPA Yeast as it comes from the 
bottle.  


I am a loyal user of the Sierra Nevada Yeast.  From my experiences, 
it is perfectly clean and free of anything that might affect the 
finished beer.  I brew all-grain batches and am very satisfied with 
the results of using it in pale ales, porters, and stouts.  


I usually just make a starter culture (1oz DME, 1-2 cups H2O, a few 
hop pellets, dregs of 2-3 bottles SNPA) a few days before the brew 
date.  I always make sure to flame the neck of the bottles before 
dumping the dregs into the starter.  I've done this numerous times 
(10) in the last several years, and it always works very well.  In 
fact, I usually get several batches out of the yeast by repitching 
fresh wort onto the yeast of the primary or secondary of a previous 
batch.


I suspect that some of the comments about the yeast were made by 
people who have never used it, so I just thought I would add my 
empirical evidence, although the results are still based on my 
opinion of the finished products!!! :)


Culture Question:  To save time, I struck the yeast out recently on 
petri dishes.  The medium was made with DME, water, and agar-agar 
from the oriental grocery, boiled until dissolved.  The colonies 
grew after a few days so I wrapped the plates up and put them in the 
frig.  One month later, I opened one to innoculate a starter, and 
the thing smelled sour, cidery, or like vinegar.  There were no 
obvious colonies of anything else on the plates.  Is this normal (I 
don't think so) but it may be due to something in the agar-agar.  Oh 
yes, I checked the other plates as well--same deal.  Any thoughts?

I remeber quite a while back there was some discussion that involved using

determine the proper amount of priming sugar.


Of course, I didn't save the article.


In my brew group we are having problems getting our brews to a regular
head consistency, and I'd like to get more information, any at all actually,
about these insulin tests. (Were they sugar tests to diabetics?)


How are they used, and what scales and ratios should be used?

I use the following recipe, but it requires a willing partner:
    1 brick Au, 10 kg (22 lbs)
    1 lemon, thinly sliced crosswise
Cut the lemon slices partway, like you would for putting on the edge
of an ice tea glass.  Untwist the lemon slice and place on the gold
brick.  Using a small piece of twine, tie the lemon slice to the brick.
Hand the concoction to your partner, and have them whollop you in the
head.  When you come to, return the favor.  Silver or platinum may be
substituted for the gold, but the flavor is not as smooth. ;)


Children should not attempt this without adult supervision!

Greetings!


I just returned from the Bahamas and 90 degree weather to 20 degrees here in
lovely Rhode Island.  Anyway, while I was enjoying the sun, I quaffed many a
beer which included Kalik, the only Bahamian Beer.  It was very good.  Tasted
like an Amstel, but wasn't a light beer.  They also have a Kalik Gold brand.
This is a high alcohol beer and actually has the words "EXTRA STRENGTH" on it.
Kind of reminded me of a tylenol bottle.  Anyway, this definitely has a punch.
Also a golden lager, the natives told me it had approx. 7% alcohol.


Has anyone seen Kalik in the States.  One American there said they saw it in a
Philadelphia store, but I've never heard of it.  Any hints would be welcome.


Continuing on the subject of beers in the Caribbean, I was surprised not to
any pale ales in the area.  From what I've read about this style of ale (mostly
from Papazian), wasn't this used by the British troops in all of the tropical
colonies because it was much more resiliant to the heat.  Maybe they have it in
Jamaica or some of the other islands.  Guinness was very popular down there.


Finally, I would like to add to Michael Yee's listing of great pubs in
Greenwich Village.  If you walk a few block west from Burp Castle, I would
recommend the Peculiar Pub (brews from all over the world), The Laughing Lion,
The Slaughtered Lamb and The White Horse Tavern.  Both the Slaughtered Lamb and
the White Horse have their own specialty brews.  Both are excellent.

It may not be yeast related -- it may be related to the vigor of the ferment.
Part of the reason that a little bit of DMS (dimethylsulfide) is a
characteristic of many well-made lagers is that the slower evolution of CO2
in a lager drives-off less of the DMS that is produced during the boil and
during chilling.  Perhaps it's DMS that they associate with "a dairy barn."
If so, then maybe they can reduce the DMS produced with a more vigorous boil
and make sure that the pot is not covered completely during the boil so that 
DMS can be driven-off during the boil.


If it's not DMS, perhaps it's a product of poorly-stored grain that gets
driven off during the more vigorous ale fermentations.  Or, maybe it is
the yeast.  Have them dry Wyeast Bavarian Lager #2206 and see if they still
have the problem.

A long time ago, I saw a receipe for a Pangalactic Gargleblaster. I don't know
if this is the version you were looking for, but here goes:


         Soak 6 - 8 Cayenne peppers is a half liter of 100 proof vodka until
        the vodka takes on a yellowish tinge (and the peppers become nearly
        white). This takes a few months.


        Prior to serving, cool the vodka in the freezer for an hour or so.


        Mix equal parts of cold pepper-vodka with peppermint schnapps.


Enjoy (if possible)!

Subject: Oxygen vs. Air


More than six months ago I ask in this forum the impact 
of using pure Oxygen rather than air for "aerating" the 
wort prior to adding your yeast.  Several email replies 
suggest that it works very well and would improve my 
beer.
 
Well, after 5 patches (15 gallon) of using pure oxygen I 
can confirm that it works very well and in my opinion is 
the single biggest improvement I have made in one step 
in my beer.
 
What I use is straight welding oxygen through a 
stainless steel "air stone" at the end of a length of 
1/4 copper tube.  I use a 1/4 plastic tubing to connect 
from the end of my welding hose the copper tube and run 
this at about 2 psi into my 15.5 gallon keg fermenter 
while I transfer the cooled wort from the brew kettle.
 
While I sure this will start some of you off again I 
have not seen shorter lag times but rather much larger 
yeast build ups and much faster ferment times.  Ferment 
times are at least half of my old method and in some 
case about one third.  At the most lag times are cut by 
1/12th.  I use a build up starter by first using a pack 
of Wyeast in a pint of 1.040 wort followed 12 to 24 
hours later by pitching this to 3 quarts of 1.040 
starter.  I then pitch the whole 3 and 1/2 quarts after 
24 to 48 hours to my 15.5 gallons fermenter.
 
What I believe the higher dissolved oxygen from using 
pure oxygen vs. air is giving me is growth of yeast to a 
much larger number and therefore much faster ferments.
(Blow off losses are also greater.)
 
The bottom line is that by using pure oxygen vs. air I 
am getting faster and therefore "cleaner" ferments.  The 
beer just tastes cleaner.  I have used this with both 
normal mashes and some overnight mashes and it has 
always worked well.  More on the overnight mashes 
another time.

Subject: A different kind of wort chiller (?)


Hi folks! There was some discussion a few days back about various types of
wort chillers.  It seems that the basic premise with wort chillers is to run
some cold material (H20 or whatever) thru tubing immersed in the hot wort. This
is the most effective heat transfer, I would guess.  What I was wondering,tho,
is if a slightly less but far simple heat transferred could be pulled off
simply by dunking one end of some highly conductive material with lots of
surface area (like copper tubing) into the hot wort, and the other end of some
equally conductive material with lots of surface area (like another copper
coil) into a tub of ice water.  There's no running water involved, but \
considerably less fuss with hooking up to sink and whatnot.  Would the thermal
transfer be too slow for an effective cold break?


I must confess I missed the start of the discussion, so if this idea was 
already put forth at some previous date, I apologise.  I try, but do not always
get to read HBD, so a personal reply would be great - especially if it is to
tell me I'm talking nonsense here.  Thanks -- AV

Subject: Pot Boiler?


I was watching Julia Child's new cooking series a week or two ago and she
had her guest chef (Emeril Lagasse from New Orleans) cooking a Louisiana
Boil.  He cooked up a LARGE quantity of shellfish, corn, potatoes, sausage,
garlic, spices, etc. in what looked to me to be at least a 10 gal kettle. 
While the food looked wonderful, I immediately thought - "boiler"!  He had
this large pot sitting on a propane fired heating element (more like a
large blowtorch!) that they referred to as a "Louisiana rig".  Julia
claimed that it is a common piece of equipment in Southern homes and that
it is sold in "every southern hardware store".  The heating element is
mounted on a low stand that she claims can hold up to a 30-gallon kettle!!!
 I can tell you that, watching the show, the chef had his kettle in a full,
rolling boil and it didn't look like the heating element was having *any*
trouble keeping it going.  Is anyone in this forum familiar with such a
device and/or know where one could be procured outside the south (like in
San Diego, for instance)?

Help.
All my kegs ran dry and so I made a batch of my quick Pale Ale. Impatience
got the better of me and I threw the the keg in the refrigerator a little
bit too soon. I believe that this knocked the yeast out before they had
a chance to reabsorb some of the diacetyl. Noonan says (_brewing_lager_
beers_) (pg. 156) "It is important that the fermentation temp. is not
prematurely lowered and that the beer is not racked off its yeast sediment
until the diacetyl has been reabsorbed."


Well, I have prematurely lowered the temp. __AND__ racked the beer
off the yeast.  OOOPS! Now the only yeast is whatever is still in
suspension.


The Question:


Can I do anything at this point??


My ideas (1) take keg out of refrigerator to warm up and wait for a few
weeks to allow yeast to reduce diacetyl (slowly?) (2) reprime and (2a)
pitch more yeast. (3) Drink beer as is and claim intent :->

Actually, I think that it was his son, Joseph Sedlmeyer, who formulated
the original Oktoberfest/Maerzen styled beer for an 1870s Oktoberfest.
Gabriel, along with Dreher and the brewers in Pilsen, really brought on
the pure culture lager revolution in the 1840s.  BTW, Joseph's initials
are in a lovely mosaic on the outside wall of the Spaten brewery along
with Gabriel's, on Marsstrasse behind the Hauptbahnhof, if you ever
visit Munich.  Don't bother trying to get a tour during the Oktoberfest,
however.  It doesn't work -- I've tried.

It's true.  These are made from polycarbonate, and they are somewhat
porous to O2.  However, not *that* porous.  I use them all the time,
and for lagering beer for several months, too.  I think they work
wonderfully well:  they are very light, they don't break, and they
are easy to sanitize.  I run boiling water into them to do the later,
and I've not had any problems with them.

You can get by with 1, but 2 is better.  The normal procedure (using 2 vessels)
is to boil up the priming sugar and water, then dump it into the 2nd vessel.
Siphon (rack) the beer into this vessel, so as to mix the priming sugar.
Finally, rack the beer into the bottles and cap them.


With only one vessel, you'll have to pour the priming sugar mixture on top of
the beer in your fermenter.  Then, mix it (which stirs up a lot of trub) to
ensure even carbonation across all the bottles.  Finally, rack it into the
bottles and cap them.  The drawback to this method is that you'll end up with
more "stuff" in the bottles along with the beer.  It will settle to the bottom
of the bottles, but you will have more of it to try to avoid when pouring your
beer.  For your first batch, this is fine, but you may want to look for a
bottling bucket, or better yet, a carboy.

I would bottle it if it is stable, and anywhere below 1.015.

My experience is leading me to believe that it is important

Subject: Two worts, One Secondary Steam Beer


Dear Fellow Brewers,


I've just finished pitching the rehydrated lager yeast (stop gasping!)
into my wort, but I'm beginning to worry about the fermentation method
I've chosen.  I recently purchased Mares's book, "Making Beer" which
sparked my interest in trying to brew a steam beer.  So I purchased
the ingrediants listed in Papezain's book for his only steam beer,
varying only the boiling hops.  Mares discussed how the California
style steam beer (Anchor) was brewed in relatively shallow open
primary chambers, then racked to secondary chambers for clarification.


I wanted to replicate this as much as a novice home brewer could, so I
used two 5 gal carboys, each filled to 2.5 gal level, adding one gal
water first and syphoning the concentrated wort into each to make 2.5
gallons.  But the problem occurred when the concentrated wort was all
gone, but there was still approximately 1 more gal still to go to make
2.5 gals!  Plus, the syphon clogged at the end of the process, leaving
me no other choice but to pour the last bit of the brew into the carboy
So now I have one carboy with 1 gallon of watter added to 1.5 gals of
concentrated wort to make 2.5 gals, and a second carboy with approx-
imately 2 gallons of water added to .5 gallons concentrated wort to
make 2.5 gallons of very low gravity wort.


So the questions are 1) because I expect that the fermentation times
for both carboys will be different, will one run a greater risk of
infection simply by waiting for the other to finish before I blend the
two into a single 5 gal secondary vessel?  2) If so, then how can I
tell?  3) Will blending the two spoil the batch (even if my anal
retentive cleaning has minimized the possibility of infection)?


As always, I sincerely appreciate any and all replies and advise.
Thanks in advance,


John

Quick question Carl - what was the temp of your ferment?  I've use 1084 for the 
first time(s) in my last two batches [a brown and a blond] and both of them 
were the longest slowest most invigorous (is that really a _common_ word?) 
primaries I've had (8 and 14 days respectively).  Previously I'd been using 
Wyeast #1098, and often I've have a complete ferment in 36 to 48 hours.  The 
only variable that really changed other than the yeast was the temp in the 
basement - from an average of about 63-64(F) to 59-60(F).  Since the brown 
tasted quite fine when I racked it to secondary (haven't got around to racking 
the blond - it's been one of those weeks) I'm not worried (yes, the 'W' word), 
but was wondering if anyone could share their experience with 1084 ferment 
times, temps, and degrees of vigorousness. Digest or e-mail would be great. 
Thanks.

for caps, etc.  They are all pretty cheap.  Buy lots when you do buy just
so ya have 'em.


Also, they sell Cornelius kegs (re-cond) for about $26.00 or so;  the single-
handled ones may be cheaper.  They also sell the 3-gal kegs too.


No affiliated, just a satisfied customer.

Subject: clip art for labels




I was hoping someone out there might be able to give me advice.  A
couple of days ago someone recommended going to sierra.stanford.edu
to get beer label images and sure enough there are a bunch of images
as well as recipes (Cat's Meow).  However, when I downloaded the images
they were in MS Word format.  I tried to view them in Word but the were
jibberish.  I then then noticed they had .jpg as a suffix so I thought
they might be in the image compression format "jpeg"  When I tried to
view the images in Jpeg Viewer 2.0 the program couldn't get at the
images.  I did all of this on a Mac.  Maybe I have Jpeg Viewer set up
wrong.  Any advice concerning beer label clip art would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks
