Wouldn't cleaning the keg thoroughly and then replacing the rubber/nylon/
what-have-you gaskets do the trick?  I know that many brewers use old
soda-syrup kegs with only these precautions, and report good results. 
One could even have one set of gaskets for beer and one for soda, and 
swap them as needed.


And as for minimizing the delay in getting HBD postings out there, well, 
enough of this converting friends from BudMillOb drinkers into 
homebrewers...  (It's only a joke!  Save the flames for under the brewpots.)

Jim Grady <grady`at`hpangrt.an.hp.com> asked about Ipswich Brewing yeast in 
HB1321. I recently toured their facility with my brew club. They use WYeast 
1056 and repitch several times before rebuilding from a single cell. Since 
Chico mutates so easily, it has developed its own characteristics.  Exactly 
what those are, I am not sure of. It is still dry and clean.
This is an interesting company. Everbody has day jobs and they brew on 
weekends. It is like a large homebrew operation. I liked their porter. I 
think they call it a "dark ale".

Subject: definitions?


 Noting the rather odd definitions that appear to exist for alcoholic
beverages (esp in southern states), prompts me to ask for what the
_REAL_ definition is for:


 BEER
 WINE
 MEAD
 LIQUOR  (sp?) - (you know - Bailey's, Grand Marnier, etc)
 HARD LIQUOR     (e.g. scotch, vodka, etc)


 It seems to my uninformed self that:


 BEER - made from malted grain
 WINE - made from fermented fruit
 MEAD - made from fermented honey
 LIQUORS - distilled wines?
 HARD LIQUOR - distilled anything, alcohol above X percent


 I'm not interested in splitting hairs, but would like some reasonable
 ;-) working definitions of the above beverages.


 I am NOT interested, for example, in the fact that Texas thinks that
 any beer above 5% is an ale, South Carolina (my state) doesnt know
 what a beer above 5% might be, etc.

Subject: Immersion Heaters in Winter


Hello All,


About a 1.5 years ago, I gave advise to a brewer from New Zealand about
keeping his brew at 65 deg F by using a water bath and fish tank heater.


This winter, I followed my own advise and then some...


For my ales, I have a fish tank heater attached to the side of a laundry
tub filled with water (and the primary frementer).  It keeps very constant
temp.  varying only 1-2 degrees.


For my lagers, I was having trouble with the refridgerator in the garage
keeping it WARM enough.  (the temps have dropped below 0 for the past
couple of days..)  So, I put another fish tank heater in a small bucket
of water, and the whole thing inside the fridge with the brew.  It warmed
things nicely, and I am not so worried about stalled fermentation.
(Before I added this heating device, my fridge was about 32, good for
aging, but not for primary fermentation.)


these have been my experiences with immersion fish tank heaters.
I hope this helps the brewer who asked.


Cheers!
Stephen

                      wyeast belgian 3944(?) perf.
Has anyone out there used the wyeast belgian wit yeast #3944, i think...?


Since it doesn't have a self-contained starter, I had to make my first
attempt at a yeast starter:


just under 1/2 cup light DME
just under 1 qt water
1/4 tsp yeast nutrient


boiled for 15 min, cooled, moved to 22oz brown longneck, pitched
and fitted w/airlock.


The yeast has taken a few days before making the airlock bubble,
but the airlock _has_ been under pressure (the two chambers have
unequal water levels). Have I done this right? Should plan to brew
my batch when the yeast is foaming, or just bubbling? Does this
yeast like to take a long time, or is it a quick and rowdy
fermenter like the #3056 Weizen dual-yeast?


thanks in advance

Subject: Re: insulin tests


          Mr. Raytrace asked about using insulin test strips for
          testing priming sugar concentration.  I have not used these
          for beer making but we do use them in my undergraduate
          biochemistry lab.  Here is some of the chemistry involved.


          We use the Diastix test strips for glucose in urine by AMES.
          These are a glucose oxidase based test which means that they
          will be specific for glucose (aka dextrose/corn sugar).  As
          I recall there are also glucose blood test strips which are
          much more expensive and urine test strips that are based on
          the Benedict's test (look for CuSO4 in the reagent list).  A
          Benedict's test is not specific for glucose but will react
          with other reducing sugars which includes just about
          anything except sucrose (aka table/cane/beet sugar).  Since
          fermented beer will contain some unfermented detxtrins,
          these would interfere with a Benedict's based test.  However
          since a Glucose Oxidase baseed test is specific for glucose,
          Priming with anything except glucose (DME, honey, high
          fructose corn syrup, sucrose) would also give poor results.


          To do the test, you just dip the end of the platic strip in
          the test solution (beer), wait 30 seconds, and match the
          color of the strip with the color key on the bottle.  The
          color key is in the range of 100 mg/dL to 2000 mg/dL.
          Fortunately for home brewers, the standard 3/4 cup of
          glucose/5 gal of beer converts to  145,000 mg/189 dL or 767
          mg/dL -- right in the middle of the scale provided!


          Now the bad news.  Since you have to match (by eye) a color
          key your uncertainty in the measurement will be at least
          plus or minus 10%.  You can measure 3/4 cup glucose
          measurement will be more precise than this so the test strip
          probably won't provide any useful information.  You could
          use a digital blood monitor for $$$$$$ but I suspect that
          the variability in beer, yeast, O2, temperature, etc is much
          more significant than the vaiablity in priming sugar
          concentration.


          Hope this helps

Subject: intergalactic recipes


All the recent comment surrounding Pangalactic Gargleblasters reminded me that,
last winter I made a serious attempt at Romulan Ale.  This 'beverage' was
consumed at the San Andreas Malts' annual oyster BBQ.  I also entered it into
the AHA regionals... with some amusing results.


I made a BIG beer... with about 10 lbs 2-row, 1 lb carapils, 1 lb munbich, and
2 bls rice syrup.  I asumed that the rice syrup would help me get a lighter
colored beer.  At kegging/bottling time I added blue food coloring.


The beer strated out golden, and ended up deep aqua-green with an irridescent
easter-egg blue head.  But it was NOT the clear blue beverage I've seen Star
Fleet officers consume !


Any alternate recipes... ?   How can I make the lightest colored beer possible
or am I doomed to failure at turning a golden beverage blue ?   Did the munich
and carapils signigficantly darken the brew ?   how about a higher % of rice.


Live long and prosper... and may the farce be with you   :)

Subject: Lake Tahoe Breweries - South Side


I was at South Lake Tahoe a year ago, and there was a new startup brewpub
with the highly original name of "The Brewery" or something like that.
They were only on about their 7th batch, made from extract, and were
fighting infection problems at the time. Even if not infected, the
extract formulation made the beer nothing special, so after a couple
there I went back to the superlative Sierra Nevada and Anchor products
available on tap elsewhere. It's on the south side of US-50 on the
California side of the state line, inside the town of South Lake Tahoe.


It seemed that all the beers made "up there" in the Tahoe/Truckee/Donner
Pass area ranged from mediocre to downright bad. But that was a year ago
and things hopefully have changed for the better; I'm scheduled back
there to ski again this year.

Re: airlock on keg.  No size cork that can fit in the

However, a rubber cork can fit OVER the threads and

Subject: Extraction problems solved("somewhat")


Hola,


I guess from the lack of response I got, I either didn't include enuf info on
the problems I was having or no one knew the answer. No problemo, though I
think I solved the problem. As you will recall I was having problems with my
extraction from the mash. 


This weekend I set out to make an oatmeal stout. I knew It would need more
body than my crappy extraction could provide. The problem had to be solved!
The first thing I did was to grind the grains finer. Mind you, I am not
making flour, I just say, cracked the individual grains into 11 peices versus
6. I have to battle my paranoid fear of cracking the grains too fine and
having a poor grain bed filter. The next thing I altered (being a steadfast
non-or quasi-empiricist) was to make a sprinkling system out of an old
mondo-beverage plastic cup. As you might also recall I was using a
Zapap-lauter tun(fashioned ala papaizan) to sparge my grains.


And Voile, I ended up with an OG of about 1.046 not painfully high but in the
range I needed for my stout. Which incidentally smelled so tasty I had to
practice great reserve to keep from swillin' the whole wort right then and
there.


Anyhew, just wanted to post this in case anyone else out there in brewspace
was having the same problems.;-)

Why not use the tap connector on the serving side, remove the hose to the tap
and put a stopper about halfway on that metal thing that slips into the hose,
into the other half of the stopper, put the airlock in.   It'll probably be on
an angle, but it should work.

Brewer's Calculator for Windows 3.1 does this and more.  It is only
$39.  The author can be reached at  b_regent`at`holonet.net.  It is not
only an excellent calculator, but lets you keep track of oodles of
things relating to each batch in a format which can be printed out on
a single page of paper for putting in a notebook.  Changing recipe
contents and seeing the changing resulting gravity changes immediately
sure is nice.  Lets you take into account how good your extraction
rates are and apply that as a percentage to "standard book" extraction
rates for different grains, or change the extraction rate for a
particular grain as you choose.  It also calculates bitterness based
on AA content, quantity and addition time.  All in all this is an
excellent program and I am hooked on it for my needs.  I hate Windows
and I went out and got Windows just so I could use BC.


I have no financial affilitation with the author, just an enormously

Hello,


I'm going to be brewing up a batch of Papazian's "Toad Spit Stout" pretty soon
and I have a question about the 8 teaspoons of gypsum he says to add to the
wort.  According to Miller, that would raise calcium to about 480 ppm, and the
sulfate level to 1120 ppm.  That seems awfully high.


My tap water is very soft but has a relatively low pH (5.4 or so, according to
the lab).  I wonder if adding so much calcium would make the water too acidic. 
Or is it not even worth it for an extract brewer to "worry" about that sort of
thing?


Anyway, I'm thinking of just adding 4 teaspoons of gypsum on brewday, just to
play it safe.  Think I'll be OK?

Remove the gas in valve.  Set it on the floor and push down on the
poppet with a philips screwdriver.  It will fall out the bottom.
Re-install teh empty valve body on the keg.  Get a 2" length of 5/8"
diameter clear plastic hose and put it over the valve body.  Insert
your normal cork and airlock in the top of the piece of hose.  If you
want to do primary fermentation in SS as I do, just replace the short
piece of hose with 4 feet of hose and put the end in a bucket with 3"
of sanitizing solution and use it as an airlock.  Works wonderfully.

I can't speak for the folks in Boulder, but can for the Chicago organizers.
The entry deadlines were established by AHA in Boulder.  Once set, the regional
organizers have a window of a few weeks to try and get the 1st round complete.
We all try to coordinate so we judge within the same period.  Then we also have
to deal with logistical issues like space and location.


In Chicago, we were immediately constrained because the local sponsor of our
regional, Goose Island Brewing, could not provide ANY space for us on ANY
weekend (Friday night through Saturday night) in April or May.  We were forced
to find an alternate location (we will be at Cavanaugh's, a Loop bar/restaurant
that is closed on weekends).  In addition, we did not want to conflict with
the judging in our neighboring region, the Southeast, which is at fairly 
close-by Oldenberg Brewery just south of Cincinnati.  They are locked in for
the weekend of April 30, and were concerned that they might lose some judges
to us if we were on the same weekend.  At least now, you have your pick --
Oldenberg on one weekend, Chicago the next.  We ain't exactly thrilled with
our date, but it was about the best we could do under the circumstances. 


As for the deadline, remember that entries will be accepted anywhere from the
4th through the 15th.  So, you can still wait until the last minute on your 
taxes and not have to sweat it with your beers. :-)

Subject: Chimay yeast test




   I'm culturing from Chimay Red for some belgian ale.  I tasted
some of the media..  which was S.G. 1.020.   I know this is thin,
but I tasted anyway.  It was winey with little aroma.  Is this OK?


  I cultured Chimay once before (but i did not brew with it), and the
culture did exhibit some of those spicy characteristics which are absent
from this culture.  There are many reasons why this might be
(higher O.G. culture media, warmer ferment...)  I just want to know
If I should try again before wasting a batch.

***
Alan made a followup to the idea of :
| dry hopping.  He mentioned that it might be interesting to
| try bottle hopping--that is, adding hops (one or two leaves,
| perhaps) directly to the bottle.                     ^^^^^^


 ...Alan tried this, he said...
I did this by adding one (or more) fresh willamette cones from my garden.
It's my opinion that one or two leaves won't do anything noticable.
                                ^^^^^^
 ...created a unique problem.  The hops act as a nucleation site for the CO2
coming out of solution.  This makes the bottle foam immediately...
 ... I can see the bubbles forming all around the hop cone;


- ---
Ok ok ok.  I tried to hold myself back, but it didn't work. 


Now boys (er, um...men- brew-people...)  :   HOPS ARE FLOWERS!
I'm sure Alan really does know this. He grew em (what kinds?).
Flowers have PETALS.  These are often mistakenly called LEAVES,
a better- but still imprecise term used - is FLAKES. They should be
cones, but by the time they have been shipped/repackaged and all
they are looking pretty flaky. You can separate the petals from the
cones, but what you really need are the lupulin crystals (yellow)
located at the inner-base of each petal.


I'd think making a quick tea with the fresh hops and adding that at
bottling would be sufficient, and avoid the nucleation problem.
There are different kinds of extracts available. Alpha Hops in Renton,WA
has the best selection of these I've come across. (206)227-6073. No connexn.
I'm waiting on my first order, and thought I'd give em a plug (NyuckNycuk).


Or just do a late-dry hop of the carboy- a day before bottling,
then you can filter them out.


Odd occurence.  I didn't have that problem with the Jalapenos I added
to my pepper beers. :-^)     Maybe they just don't nucleate like leaves. 
***
Norm had some things to say about PORTERS.  
I think  Ken Miller made a good followup. Glad he got on it, my Porter 
book is out on loan, and I hadn't memorized that passage yet.   :)  Ta.


Norm...it is my personal contention that porters can generally be 
considered a bit lighter in body that stouts.  Some stouts may well 
overlap. In MY Coyote (no tm!) brewery, a stout can bairly show light 
through. While porters will reveal a deep red-brown hue.  My porters may 
be very roasty, but not "scorched/bitter".  They may have some sweetness, 
(not 2 much) occasionally brown sugar has fallen into the brewpot.  
My stouts will vary from dry to sweet- depending on many factors.  They
generally are a bit less hoppy than the porters.  The stouts can be 
"creamy/smooth" while the porters are "cleaner, sharper". It's hard
to describe, but I know when I've got it right (i.e., the way I like it:)


Now I don't know how to make the real "exact/precise/consice" distinction.
I just have my own feelings/experiences/brews to consider. Plus a few
commercial samplings. But who's to say those are "right". It is a revival!


I do remember a long-heated debate SOME time back re: which does and 
doesn't belong in porter:  Roast, or Black Patent malts.
I don't remember the exact outcome.  I thought Terry went for roast???


What do you read Ken?  I know he doesn't "like" sugars, but knows
they fall into lots of British brews (his Pale ale book mentions this-
that one's on "borrow" from a friend)

Subject: When to air and not to air.


>I have been seeing alot of talk about aerating the wort and the beer. I 
am still a little confused on this. When I brew I try not to aerate at 
anytime in my process. Is this wrong to do? If so, then when do I aerate 
and when don't I? 
- ---
*   Ok  Brief summary here. Both extract and mashed.  Which are you?


# Minimize aeration once solutions are warmed (mash in, out, sparge)
    Due to danger of HSA (hot side aeration) which affects aging.


# While wort is hot.  During/after boil. Stir, don't splash.
    Dangers of HSA, and oxidation reactions. Faster rxns at hot temps.


# Cool wort after boil.  Once cooled-  AERATE. before, during, or after
    racking into primary.  Pitch yeast. Ferment.


# Once fermentation has become active, DO NOT AERATE.  During racking
    to secondaries, or bottling/kegging processes.
    Oxidation of fermentation products can occur. Alcohol+ is reactive.


# Avoid oxidation of kegged beer. Purge headspace w/ CO2 before mixing.
  Bottled beer can oxidize. Special caps, high fill, fill-rest-cap procds.




    Note: Yeast need air, but only at the beginning. Then avoid it.
    Keep air out of any of the hot solutions. < Cooling is hip! >


>Also, I have only been single fermenting (out of fermenting bucket and 
into bottling bucket), and I have been noticing a yeasty aftertaste on 
most of my Ales. If I change to using a secondary fermenter will this 
lighten the aftertaste? or does time? The aftertaste does mellow with 
time, but takes a very long time. Thanks for your help!


*   Couple question/ couple answers.


Do you use a racking cane, with the little orange cap-thingy on the end?


You can make a point of racking from ABOVE the sludge, and losing a 
LITTLE beer and reduce sediment/yeast flavors in finished beer.
 
IMO  A secondary will benefit -additional clearing, removal of early
products (waste) and break material passed from boil and improve the
flavor of beer overall.  If you are aging a beer in the fermenter
for any period of time (>week) you should rack away from the primary
trub.  You could set up a second bucket, but I'd recommed a glass
carboy. What kind of primary do you have?  I sometimes use 5 gal.
buckets with a tap at the bottom (siphonless) raised above the trub level.


Anyway  Brew on!.

Subject: flat brown ale


Help!!!


This weekend, I opened a bottle of brown ale my brother & I bottled 3 weeks
previous, and it was flat.  Not a bubble.  Still.  Very sad.


We know we primed it (2/3 c. of corn sugar, as I recall).  Also, another bottle
proved flat, & my new Party Pig I received for Christmas if full of flat beer
(except for a tad, very slight carbonation that I theorize is forced).  We
think what happened is that there was no viable yeast (Wyeast American Ale)
at bottling time.  What we plan to do this weekend is siphon off the bottles
& the Party Pig into our handy plastic bucket & repitch with some fresh yeast
that's going in a starter, then rebottling.  Any suggestions?  Warnings?
Anybody out there done this before?


Thanks, & Happy brewing,


Alan of Austin

Subject: Scottish Ale Yeast/ Lactose/primary heaters




First two questions (for which e-mail replies are requested):
1. Anybody out there used Wyeast's Scottish Ale Yeast?  What temperature?
What kind of results did you get?  Comments are appreciated.


2. Anybody use lactose (milk sugar)?  Do you add it during the boil or
just at bottling?  Or does it matter?  Also what amounts are suggested
I have dry lactose)?




In regards to David Tetenbaum's request about heaters for primary 
fermentation, I recall someone posting a while ago (sorry, I don't
remember who) a potentially good idea for keeping primary fermentation
at ideal temperatures.  The idea was to get a large enough "bucket" to
place your carboy in and surround it with water.  Then get an aquarium
heater designed to heat as much water in the bucket and the amount in
your carboy and let the heater do it's thing.


I'm planning on trying this very soon.  Hope it helps.


e-mail replies would be appreciated since I only get to the net in
my free time.


Thanks in advance,
