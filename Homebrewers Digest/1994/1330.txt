Subject: Calculating OG, Plastic, Unix code


Hello Group,
First Topic is calculating a rough OG: The first issue of Brewing Techniques
(may/june 92) had an article by Karl King on a Recipe Formulation Spreadsheet.
He provided these numbers for typical extracted points/lb, YMMV.


Malt Type     Points
DME           44
LME           35
Pale Malt     29
Dextrin       20
Crystal 20    15
Crystal 40    13        These numbers probably assume an 
Crystal 60    10        infusion mash, and are up for debate.
Wheat         25
Vienna        24
Munich Lt     20
Munich Dark   18
Cara Pils     20
Cara Vienna   15
Chocolate      3
Roasted Barley 1
Black Patent   0


He also gave numbers for Color in Lovibond.  The calculations are merely adding
up the amount of each used (lbs) multiplied by the Points, divided by the
recipe volume. You will get a number like (45) which is divided by 1000 and
added to one to be the OG (1.045).
**
The Plastic Carboy discussion has me wondering if everyone is talking the same
animal. Clear Polycarbonate water bottles versus Polyurethane? Opague Plastic
Buckets. Maybe our Canadian friends are able to purchase
other-than-ploycarbonate water bottles. I don't know much about polymers so I
can't comment futher.

For those of you trying to download image files from Sierra and getting garbled
text files, I will let you in on the secret. Its Unix UUcode. It allows the
posting to the Net of images as UUencoded text and decoding back to the image.
For Macs, a great program is UUlite which I downloaded from one of the software
archives at Umich, Sumex, or Wuarchives.

Subject: Rank newbie question


Hi all!  Under the influence of a couple (well, maybe several) excellent 
ales and stouts that I received from my _two_ beer-of-the-month Xmas 
gifts, a friend and I decided that we should make our own beer. To prove 
to ourselves that it wasn't the beer talking, we went down to our local 
brewery (Goose Island, Chicago) and asked where to get a kit. Long story 
short, they directed us to one at a local liquor supermarket type place 
and we took a shot at making beer on Jan 16.  We followed the directions 
with the kit as closely as possible, kept everything as sanitary as we 
could, and all seemed to go pretty well.  We decided to keep the plastic 
fermenter (I hear you all saying "Glass! Glass!"; what did we know, it 
was in the kit) in an interior room that we though would stay warm enough 
(the directions say 70-80 degrees F). 


Our luck- we get temperatures in the high negative 20's this week, and my 
buddy's apartment apparently isn't staying as warm as usual. The valve on 
top of the fermenting bucket isn't doing squat: no bubbles, nothin'. 
After reading some of the back issues from here, I realized that was the 
only thing that didn't seem to be going right- It appears to be not 
fermenting.


My questions (finally)
 -Will cold temperatures prevent the yeast from beginning to 
      ferment the wort?
 -Will moving the fermenter nearer a radiator possibly start the 
      fermentation?
 -Do we have to pitch the whole mess and start over?                    
 
Thanks for any input, e-mail is ok if these are truly dumb questions.

I have some winmaking questions.  Anyone out there that makes, if you

And my beer question:  What style are dark beers, like Heineken Dark,
Beck's Dark or St. Pauli Dark?


And last question:  I just tried Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer, and
didn't likeit one bit.  How true is it to the style? I've never had an
oktoberfest style before to my knowledge.

Subject: RE: lager yeasts at warm temps








   Hi All,


   Got a couple of quick data points in response to the thread on using
lager yeasts at higher temperatures.  At the last Brew Free Or Die meeting,
one of the members had a steam beer he had brewed using Wyeast 2007, and
fermented at ~60F.  The beer was very good, it had the same rounded, muddy
phenolic that's characteristic of the 2112 California lager, but it was less
pronounced.  Otherwise, the beer was quite clean, there were no other off
flavors normally associated with high temperature lager fermenatations,
esters, etc.  So, the 2007 is one yeast that I know works well at higher
temps.
   Conversly, one to avoid is 2206, this yeast produces very harsh phenolics
at higher temperatures.  I tried this once, the beer had an ammonia-like 
smell, very unpleasant.

   I have to agree with the comments on .sig files made by Lee Menegoni in
HBD#1328.  A few months ago, someone posted a six line article, followed
by a twenty line signature.  It's fairly common to see signatures longer than
the article.  A name and email address is enough to allow followup discussions,
without the needless waste of increasingly precious bandwidth on the digest.

Subject: Briess Color Test


I read with interest the recent article by Dr. Fix regarding beer color.  I am
confused, though, about the following from the article:


>PROCEDURE
>1. Clean everything.
>2. De-gas standard and then sample in blender.
>3. Measure in 20 ml of standard beer in export bottle No. 1.
>4. Measure in 20 ml of sample beer in export bottle No. 2.
>5. If colors are different, measure in 10 ml of distilled
>   water to bottle No. 1 and 10 ml of sample beer to export
>   bottle No. 2.
>6. Continue Step 5 until colors become close. At this
>   point the comparisons should be made in the one-inch
>   diameter jars. Transfer 25 to 50 ml into these from the
>   export bottles and return after comparison. Cut the water
>   and sample beer increment from 10 ml to 5 ml.
>7. When a color match is obtained, record the total
>   amount of water added. Figure 2 gives the associated degL.


When changing over to the smaller viewing vessel, are you not diluting at a
greater rate?  It seems to me that you cannot just add up the total dilution
water if you are discarding part of the sample in the original vessel (the
Miller bottle).


These may be stupid questions, but I have found that stupid questions are far
less harmful than keeping quiet and misunderstanding.  This applies to
virtually everything!

Subject: Improved Brew Kettle Performance


I brew in a converted 15.5 Sanke stainless steel keg on 
a high BTU propane burner.  While this system has work 
very well for me it does use quite a bit of propane 
because the heat transfer of the stainless steel is not 
very good.  It is also to work around the kettle 
(keg).  Using an idea from Greg Stark in Brew Free or 
Die, (Beer and Brewing , Vol 11, 1991, Brewer 
Publications) who uses old water heaters as heat 
shrouds.  I have come up with a heat shroud made from a
common 30 gallon steel drum.  I got my drum from
a used drum company for $ 12.00.  It was a used but
 reconditioned and clean drum.  Basically 
I used the lower two thirds of the drum.  The drum is 
used invered or upside down to make the heat shroud.  
 
The figure below shows the general arrangement of the
keg and heat shroud.

                        Burner
 
 
The hot POC (products of combustion) rise around the 
outside of the keg and vent through a 3 inch diameter 
hole cut in the "backside" of the heat shroud.  Backside 
is define as the other side of the keg from the side you 
normally stand by.  This greatly increases the heating 
area of the kettle and makes a marked improvement in the 
efficient use of the heat from your burner.  I am now 
using about one half the propane per batch as before I 
made the heat shroud.
 
To make this shroud I cut a 15.875 inch dia. hole in the 
bottom of the 30 gallon drum and then cut off the top 
one 1/3rd of the drum.  To use as shroud you then turn 
the drum upside down and slip it over the keg.  I also 
cut a 3 inch dia hole in the backside at top of the now 
inverted drum. The shroud also has a "u" shaped slot
at the bottom to fit over my drain valve. I used a saber
saw with metal cutting blade to do all of the cutting except
for the 3 inch vent and for that I used a large hole saw.
 
This leaves you with some sharp metal edges that need to 
be filed smooth.  This heat shroud is light weight and 
easy to just drop over you keg.  I welded a 1/8 by 1/2 
steel hoop around the bottom of my shroud but this is 
not easy to do without a TIG welder or you need to be 
good with gas welding.  The shroud will work just fine 
without this bottom hoop.

Subject: Dry Lager Yeast


I have gotten some private e-mail asking about dry lager strains, and
asking if the Red Star lager strain will be reintroduced. The answer
to the latter question is definitely no.


I have done 12 test brews since last March testing various candidates
for the Red Star lager strain. None were satisfactory. In order to find
out what is going on here, Dr. Foy of Universal Foods sent me two slants
of what he felt was his best lager strain. One was propagated using
the standard Siebel procedure (1.040 hopped wort at 50F), and the other
was propagated using the standard procedure used in the production
of dry yeast. The medium is a dextrose/molasses mixture supplemented
with a nitrogen source and other nutrients. The  propagation temperature
used was 85F. Beer made from the latter had all the defects of the
earlier test brews. Strong and slightly rotten sulfury tones that only
weakly attenuated in cold storage was the most notable defect. There were
also some medicinal undertones. Subsequent analysis with staining procedures
showed that serious mutation occurred during propagation.




The beer made from the yeast propagated with the Siebel procedure came out
just fine without any of the above defects. It was slightly sulfury, but this  
is not uncommon with many lager strains. I found the effect attractive, and it
added to the overall maltiness of the beer. This is clearly a serious lager
strain, and the defects encountered above came from propagation methods and
not to intrinsic defects in the yeast.  


Economic and technological considerations currently make the high temperature
propagation on sugar solutions necessary for dry yeast. Certain strains are 
not adversely affected by this procedure. This for example is the case with 
Red Star's (Universal  Foods) excellent ale and Champagne yeast. It is 
not clear to me, however, that there is a lager yeast that can withstand this
type of propagation.


For lagers having a dry and elegant finish, I personally prefer Dr. Maribeth
Raines' Pilsner strain. This is the one Darryl Richman brought back from
Pilsen. Paul Farnworth is also selling a excellent Pilsner strain. For
rounded and malty Bavarian style lagers, there in nothing IMHO than can match
W-34/70. It is available on slants and also from Wyeast.

I've been out of town for a couple weeks, and I'm catching up on the HBD.
Chip Hitchcock cautions that with foil caps and oven heating of bottles
air is sucked back into the bottles when they cool, thereby raising the
risk of infection.  This is true.  May I suggest that one allow the bottles
to cool in the oven which has just been sterilized?  Of course as the oven
cools room air is drawn in, so after turning off the oven block the hot air
vent and allow the foil capped bottles to cool that way.

Subject: The Diatom Conspiracy


There was a question a few days ago about using diatomaceous earth to
filter beer.  I don't know where that thread led, because not having
an interest in filtering out those wonderful little yeasties, I didn't
pay much attention.  With apologies to all if this is old news, I
thought I'd mention a commercial application of diatomaceous earth that
was recently brought to my attention.


Last night was Tuesday, therefore I was at Bridgeport Brewpub here in
Bridgeport Brewpub Town.  Someone, it may have been me, noticed a
smallish, maybe six or eight foot high, tank-like thing nestled among
the larger tanks in the brewery.  Although smaller, it seemed heavier
duty.  It had a clamped-on lid like a pressure cooker, was standing on
legs with small wheels, and had a smaller clone of itself attached to
its side.  I assumed it was in the budding phase.


Immediately launching a full-scale investigation, I asked the guy making
pizza what it was.  He claimed that he didn't know, although he admitted
to being a homebrewer.  He was obviously hiding something.  Out of the
corner of my eye, I noticed an attractive young woman bussing a table.
Under intense questioning, she admitted that she knew what it was, "A
filter," she said.  She pretended to stumble over the pronunciation of
"diatomaceous", but the act was easy to see through.  I kept the pressure
on.  Finally, she broke down and spilled the whole story, "It's a
diatomaceous earth filter", she blurted, her voice starting to quiver,
"They use it to filter out the yeast.  Now if you don't mind, I have work
to do."  But there was one more thing I needed to know.  Did they filter
all of their beer?  "Everything but the cask-conditioned," she muttered,
unable to conceal her quick glance at my pint of cask-conditioned porter.


Satisfied that I had gotten to the bottom of the story, I sat and sipped,
and looking around, felt a bond of brotherhood with the other yeast
eaters and sense of smug superiority over the ignorant masses with their
sparkling pints of carbonated, crystal-clear, filtered, tap beer.


At least that's how I remember it.

In HBD 1328 Bill King discusses microwaves and microbe size:

To which I have to respond (regarding microwave OVENS):


Heating by microwave radiation does not work like reception of radio waves 
with an antenna. I have a physics PhD but little practical experience with 
low energy radiation like microwaves. Nonetheless, my understanding is that 
microwave ovens heat by stimulating transitions in water molecules 
(vibrational transitions I believe). The wavelength for such transitions is 
set by the difference in energies of the pertinent molecular states (quantum 
mechanics in action). The water molecules absorb energy through these 
transitions and lose it to surrounding molecules that they collide with. The 
internal excitation energy of the water molecules is converted to kinetic 
energy of the molecules in these collisions. Thus, the absorption of microwave 
energy leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of the water molecules, which
means that the temperature rises.


The details of this process have important ramifications:


*  Microwaves will NOT heat if whatever you're heating contains NO water.
   A corollary - the less water something contains, the less a microwave
                   oven will do to it.


*  The electromagnetic field strength in a microwave oven is significantly 
        reduced when water is present in any significant amounts inside the 
        oven. In simpler terms, this means that if there's lot's of water
        localized in the oven, most of the heating will take place there.
        Microwaves can only put out a limited amount of power and it doesn't
        take much water to suck up this power. This is the reason you get
        hot and cold spots when heating food in a microwave.
        
  So I would hazard a guess that putting your equipment in the micro 
  along with a cup of water will do very little. The water gets hot, nothing
  else does.


  I would not trust a microwave to sanitize anything that is not in contact 
  with water. I have used my microwave to sanitize bottles for yeast starters
  etc. by filling them partway with water and "nuking" them for ~5 min. The
  combination of the boiling water inside the bottles and the escaping steam
  seems to work well for sanitizing these bottles. I have also sterilized 
  stoppers by immersing them in a glass bowl of water and heating the water
  to the boiling point in a microwave oven.


  Microbes certainly have water in them, and I would guess that microwave ovens
  could IN PRINCIPLE kill them, but there's the problem that any sources of 
  water nearby will likely be much more efficient at absorbing microwaves than
  the bacteria or yeast you really want to get at.


You might ask if the above is true, why does Bill observe that ants etc
survive in strong microwave fields. My guess is that he works with microwaves
in the communications industry. The microwaves they use are not "tuned"
to a frequency which excites water-molecule transitions (if they did, 
they'd hardly be useful for communication) which means these bugs 
don't get cooked. Now strong EM fields can do damage in ways that have
nothing to do with vibrational transitions in water, and in this case the 
size of the beast being exposed to said EM radiation may matter. 


I hope this contributes to the discussion. If you have any problems
with the above, feel free to e-mail me though I won't be around to 
respond for the next week.


Cheers,

It takes quite an effort to design an unpressurized cargo compartment in an
airplane with a pressurized fuselage.  Some bombers, for example, have bomb
bays that must open to air at altitude and maintain an inside cabin pressure at
the same time.  There is a lot of complicated, heavy structure required to seal
these compartments from the rest of the fuselage.  On a commercial airliner at
cruising altitude, everything between the fore and aft pressure bulkheads is
pressurized to about 11 psi; that which you'd find at about 8000 feet.

Howdy,


I see some stuff starting up about style definitions & competitions, & I
would like to bring up an issue or two about non-defined styles, especially
in AHA categories.  Whereas I can see having certains guidelines defining
what, say, a pale ale is, it makes it frustrating for those who want to
experiment with styles & then enter them in competitions.  For instance, I
decide that I want to make a beer with characteristics that aren't in any
category.  If it tastes good, I'll want to enter it into a competition, but
it'll get poor scores if I enter it into some category, & would not meet the
specifications for specialty beers.  What can you do?  To me, it limits one of
the very purposes of homebrewing:  innovation.  By dictating what a style
should be, & by allowing only defined styles, the AHA is allowing outlets for
only recognized existing styles.  There needs to be a forum for new style
development in homebrewing, & the AHA needs to foster it.


About long HBDs:  I agree, be concise, & stop the long signatures.


Happy brewing,

In April of 1992 I entered my first contest. Judges sheets finally came in
August 1992. I got a 2nd and a 3rd, earning two certificates and two cans of
malt extract. 
I called the person whose name was on the cover letter and he assured me the
cert's and malt would be forthcoming. 
After another month or so passed I emailed one of the sponsoring clubs
members to ask about the delay...
No response.
In November of 1992,I met a member of the sponsoring club at a contest that I
was stewarding at. He wrote down my name,etc, assuring me he would have it
taken care of.
ANYHOW,here it is almost 2 YEARS later and still nothing.
Its not the awards, but the lack of follow through that irks me.
I don't enter their contests anymore and for some reason they do not use my
local brew supply shop as a contest drop off any more.
The topper is that this club has been chosen as a judging site for  one of
the 'club only' AHA contests this year!!
It seems that timely response should be a criteria for AHA sanctioned
contests.

I heartily agree with Jonathon Knight in 1328 when he said that 2 postings
a day is not on.  Restaint is important, especially now when many people are
brewing.  A lot of what I have read lately has been of relatively little
help.  I have read descriptions of inefficient bottling procedures, detailed
accounts of brewing batches, and the usual number of uninformative or
factually incorrect ressponses.  For instance Liebfraumilch, the totally
uninspired German white wine translates as Lover'smilk - not mother's milk.
A question.  In a long account of brewing a Vienna John Robinson mentions
using 4.25 cups of malt per pound.  I have always found this to be one
of the worst bubu's in Noonan (the other being that enameled steel pots are
useless).  Miller's 3.3 figure is what I get - or are there different sized
cup (8 oz.) measures?  And what is the great timesaving Viniator in Al K's
speedy bottling technique (takes twice as long as my method of dunking 
bottles in a laundery sink) that require 20 sqirts per bottle?  Inquirering
minds want to know.

Bill King writes in HBD #1328 that "flies, ants, and the like can happily
mill about in a very strong microwave field" and therefore microbes would
be immune to microwave sterilization.


I don't know about "microscopic pathogens", but when I was in high school,
my biology teacher forced us to think a little bit and come up with an end-
of-term project.  A friend of mine exposed fruit flys, which are tiny, to
different levels and durations of microwaves, then bred them.  He found
that about 20 seconds on "upper-medium" produced little mortality and many
more obvious mutations than anticipated.  This produced flies in the first
generation with unusual coloring in the wings and/or body and/or eyes, 6
wings, absent or shriveled wings and/or legs, etc.  15-20 seconds on "high"
caused the poor little guys to burst.  Just some empirical evidence...


I thought UV was a very effective way to sanitize things (such as bottled
water).  I would *guess* that microwaves, being even higher than UV in
frequency, would be even more effective as longer wavelengths are the ones
that tend to not hit anything (ala sunsets).
