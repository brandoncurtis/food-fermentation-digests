Subject: predicting original gravity




            Lately, several people have been asking about how to
            calculate (predict) original specific gravity.  During the
            past year, I collected various posts from the digest on this
            subject, and just recently assembled all of the info form my
            use.  What follows are *my* notes on the subject.
            
            Diclaimer:  I did not originate this research, it is not my
            work, it is the work of others on the digest.  I am sorry I
            cannot give proper credit.
            
            BTW, constructive corrections, suggestions, and comments are
            heartily encouraged.
            
            ------------------------------
            Theoretically, for 100% yield, a mash would provide 0.0463
            points of specific gravity per pound of ingredient per
            gallon of water.
            
            In other words, 0.0463 (points/pound)/gallon
                            -or-    points/pound/gallon
            
            To predict original gravity,
            you must know either the percent yield:
            
            OG = 1 + [ (pounds of stuff) * (0.0463) * (% yield) ] ...
                     --------------------------------------------
                               # of gals of wort
            
            -OR- you must know the points yield of each substance:
            
            OG = 1 + [ (pounds of stuff) * (points yield) ] ...
                     --------------------------------------
                               # of gals of wort
            
            Yields for "stuff" as found in various digest posts:
            
            Ideal  0.0463 points/lb/gal, or 100%
            Sugar  0.044 points/lb/gal, or 95.0%
            DME    0.042 points/lb/gal, or 90.7%
            LME    0.036 points/lb/gal, or 77.4%
            Honey  0.032 points/lb/gal, or 69.1%
            Grains 0.029 points/lb/gal, or 62.6%
             (the value for grains is for pale and crystal
              being used as adjuncts; I do not believe that
              the darker grains-chocholate, roasted barley, for
              example-add to the gravity.)
            
            
            Example:  (Jimmy Beer #22), 5 gal batch
            
            5.4 lbs LME
            1   lb  DME
            1.5 lb  grains


            OG = 1 + [5.4*0.036] + [1*0.042] + [1.5*0.029]
                      ---------     -------     ---------
                          5            5            5
            
            OG = 1 + 0.038 + 0.009 + 0.009 = 1.056

Subject: Whitbread Dry back on the shelf?


A brewer friend of mine just walked in my office to tell me that an all-new
Whitbread dry yeast was on the shelf at a homebrew shop in Woburn MA.
What is the story on this?  Is this an all-new strain?  I really like the
"old" whitbread - one of the best dry-yeast attenuators I've used.

A plea, if you can, to use yeast names rather than numbers.  I can
never remember what 2006 and 2007 are?  Bohemian?  Munich???  I
realize the names are sometimes as arbitrary as the numbers, but at
least I can hook a name to something in my memory so I'll recognize it
next time it comes around.


Thanks.

Subject:  Oven Sanitizing


>From the "I thought I thought but actually didn't think" file:


I read with great interest Jeff Frane's post a short while back
about using the oven to sanitize bottles with foil caps.  I
really liked the idea, and especially liked that the monstrous
drudgery of bottling could be abated by splitting over two days. 
"Wow, this is going to be GREAT!" I said to myself while smirking
and rubbing palms together vigorously.


So I carefully capped each of my Grolsch bottles with foil,
followed by a happy deposit into the oven.  "Wow, this is going
to be GREAT!"  HOWEVER...my initial "heh-heh-heh" turned into
"&*#`at`!?!" as a while later the smoke detector started *raging*
infernally.


Seems I *assumed* that since my Grolsch bottles were a few years
old, naturally none of the new plastic capped imposters had
deviously infiltrated their way into my stock of ceramic capped
prizes.  My wife nearly permanently canceled my brewery in the
aftermath of the melted-plastic-cap-toxic-smoke shock syndrome
that fervently gripped her (&*#`at`!?!!!  You ruined my oven!!!!).


Several gallons of elbow grease and salty language later, the
oven has been reclaimed!  I still ardently champion the oven
sanitizing method, although I now *diligently* inspect each and
every Grolsch bottle that goes in there.

Subject: style


The problem is that it's almost impossible to judge a beer without
having a standard to judge it against.  Aside from "obvious flaws"
such as infections (but who's to say: pediococcus, enterobacter,
brettanomyces are infections in most beer styles, but are essential
components of the flavor of a lambic), how "well made" a beer is
depends on what you were aiming for.


Take, for example, hops.  The extremely hoppy flavor and aroma present
in American (west coast) pale ales are entirely inappropriate in most
German lagers.


Last night, we had our club-only pale ale competition (just in time to
air-express beer to Boston).  One of the beers entered as an IPA was a
nicely made beer, and would have done quite well in the "English
Strong Ale" category.  But its sherry-like tones and lack of hop
aroma and flavor made it a poor IPA.


So yes, styles are arbitrary and confining.  And, yes, sometimes the
AHA style guidelines don't even encompass all the commercial examples
in that style.  But there's nary a well-made beer that can't fit into
one of the (is it 29 now?) AHA styles if you stretch it a little.


I like to experiment, but at the same time, I'm still learning how to
control my brewing processes.  It's a challenge to previsualize a
certain end-result, and work backwards to a set of ingredients and a
process to achieve that result.  I can aim for a particular style, and
get unbiased judges to give their opinions on how well I did.  That
feedback then helps me to improve my brewing skills and understanding
how it works.  But it would be impossible without the common point of
reference provided by the style guidelines.

Hi all:


As usual, I'm getting to my responses a bit late.


In HBD #1324, Mike Fetzer was looking for keg parts.
Try Foxx Distributing in Denver at 800-525-2484.


Dave asked about using an auto radiator as a chiller.
In the book "The Lore of Still Building" they show a
chiller using an auto air conditioner radiator. You
passed the hot wort through the coils and used a fan
blowing on the fins for cooling. I got a radiator and
flushed it with solvents, water and other stuff, (I 
don't remember what). I didn't use it for 2 reasons.
First, even though I tasted the water after all the
flushing and it seemed okay, I still wasn't sure. I
pushed a lot of chemicals through it.
Secondly, although it appeared that the coil was copper,
there were lead solder joints in it. I just wasn't
comfortable with the whole thing.
I finally built a counter flow chiller for about 20 bucks
and it works great.


In HBD #1327, Mike Hansen asked about specific gravity of 
different combinations of fermentables.  Miller has a
chart on page 196 of The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing
that should help.


RE: Beer Across America:  My wife bought me a 3 month 
subscription for Christmas. I got the first package the last
week in December. I was pleasantly surprised with the 
selections, Wassail Ale from the Full Sail Brewing Co. and
Baderbrau Bock, from Chicago.  The reason for the surprise
is that their advertising brochure shows such 
*great microbrews* as products from Oldenberg. If that stuff
showed up, I would have asked for a refund.  Anyway, they
don't tell you in advance what they will be sending, but if
the next 2 shipments are as good as the first, I'll be a 
real happy camper.
 
RE: Ron Rushings request for heat sources, I use the burner
from a hot water heater. We mounted it in the air cleaner cover
from a car (air cleaner, you remember, when car engines had
carburators). We then welded the air cleaner to a steel stand.
I works great with my 15.5 gal. former Bud keg brewpot.




RE: soda in kegs: I have found that the rubber lid seal
collects the soda odor. When I replaced mine, the
problem disappeared.


RE: Carboy handles: I bought one from a homebrew store,
the metal one that screw clamps onto the bottle. It works
okay for one bottle. I asked at the bottled water dist.
and they sold me a plastic handle that just slips on and off.
Not only is it easier to use, but it places the handle 
over the center of the carboy, as opposed to having it
on the side and causing the carboy, with the 
settled trub, to tip whenever moved.


And finally, my question of the week:  I can buy grains
already crushed in 50# bags at a real cheap price. I'm told
that they are best used within a month. If I keep them
refrigerated or frozen, will they last longer? TIA


Marc
 P.S. Thanks to all who helped me get rid of my double spacing
problem.

Subject: yeast & bottlelife


          Notes on yeast:
          I just made up 7.5 gal of wort & split it--5 gallons & 2.5 
          gallons--identical (except for the finishing hops (Perle in 
          5;Willamette in 2.5). I pitched different yeasts (everything 
          at basement room temp= ~58),  Yeast Lab A07 (Canadian Ale) 
          in the 5 gallon; Yeast Lab L35 (California Lager) in the 2.5 
          gallon. The Ale is supposedly good at "cool" and the Lager 
          good at "warm". I brewed last Monday, pitched Tuesday 
          morning. Wednesday morning, the lager yeast was blowing off 
          at a high rate; ale doing nothing. Thursday morning lager 
          was starting to subside and replaced blow-off tube with 
          airlock; Ale was just beginning to bubble. This morning 
          (Friday), lager and ale were bubbling about equally, lager 
          clearly slowing down, and I'm expecting no blow-off with the 
          ale at all. Checking temp over five days--almost always 
          56-58 F (though I suspect maybe a little cooler in middle of 
          night).
                Conclusion: Ale yeast not too good at this low temp 
          (though I await the finish product to be sure)
                Request: Any info on other ale yeasts that might work 
          this cool. Or should I just stick to lager yeasts (fraid I'm 
          stuck with basement brewing & not up to building wort 
          temp-controllers, not to mention the space problem.) Might 
          Ale have worked better had I pitch the Ale yeast warmer, 
          before letting it cool to room temp?
          On bottle life--
                I inherited two cases of standard longnecks from a 
          colleague who retired (from brewing as well as from job). He 
          says he used them for 20-25 years (maybe 40-60 refills) and 
          can't remember one breaking (except for dropping on cement). 
          I've refilled a couple more times and now have them mixed in 
          with my other supply and can't see or tell any difference. 
          I've never broken one (cept for throwing at my ex-wife's 
          head, which was made of stone). Course these bottles were 
          never baked. I was thinking about baking, but maybe not, if 
          the bottles die.

started with 10 beers which ranged nearly white (Bud) to those with increasing
color. The Lovibond reading for these were measured with Lovibond glasses. 
The procedure described above was applied to each of these, and the total
amount of dilution required was measured. This with the known color rating gave
a data point. A cubic spline fit was used with these 10 data points to get
the curve displayed in the article. We then compared the results of some
other samples with photometric measurements (the most accurate way to measure
color) and found errors in the range +- 1%, which was our oiginal goal for
a simple procedure.

My thoughts on this are:
1) at least here in Chicago you can get a glass carboy the same way 
   you get your plastic ones for the same price ($5-$7), so why not
   just go with the glass.
   
2) invest in at least one carboy handle, though I bought one for each
   carboy I own, and your investment is still less than that of a new
   carboy from a supply store.
   
3) at such a minimal investment, replacing a carboy isn't too expensive.


I also have a question.  I have two batches sitting in secondary fermentors
in my kitchen next to the back door that have been there for three weeks.
Is this too long (considering the kitchen is about 50 degrees), and what
sort of adverse effects might I encounter?

Subject: Style Guideline, etc.


Part of the recent bunging up was due to a competition announcement with 
all the gory details (wouldn't an announcement of an FTP site have been a 
better idea?).  Anyway one was the style guideline for stout


 . CLASSIC DRY STOUT - Black opaque. Light to medium body. Medium 
to high hop bitterness. Roasted barley character required. Sweet 
maltiness and caramel malt [crystal] evident. No hop flavor or 
aroma. Slight acidity/sourness OK. Low to medium alcohol. Diacetyl 
low to medium.  OG 1.038-1.072 IBU 30-60 SRM 40+.


My bitch is about the maltiness.  Guinness is not malty -or is that too much 
of an industrial beer for the homebrew gods?  I was marked down in a
competition recently for not having a DRY stout sweet enough and I thought
it was too malty.  At first I 
was inclined to just blame the lack of experienced judges, but now it is
evident that the AHA hasn't a clue.  I still think specialized judges are 
needed - not Jack of all trades - master of none.  And the AHA style guidelines
need to be reviewed.  Anyway, it makes my decision not to enter tha Nationals
easy.  I guess overall I agree with Alan in Austin.


Error of the day from 1330 
I would *guess* that microwaves, being even higher than UV in
frequency, would be even more effective as longer wavelengths are the ones

I  had the same problem. My solution was to get a larger burner (rocket jet)
this fixed the problem of getting the water up to a fast boil, but it 
introduced
a new one. Now I had a 35,000  BTU burner that was OK when boiling 5 gal.
of wort when I switch to a  15gal SS kegs with false bottoms
 it wasn't enough. Now I have a 135,000 Btu burner and it boils
water faster. But now it caramelizes wort on the bottom and in the tube to the
 valve.
 I was talking to one of the "Brews Brother"  and he solved the
same  problem with his boiler by making a shroud to go around
his boiler. He gets 15 gal. of water to boil in 20-30 min. with a
35,000 Btu burner.
I am currently in the process of building one for my self.
I will report back when it is finished to give test results..

Subject: Homebrew at a Beerfest


St. Mary's College in Moraga, CA, is holding its third Beerfest in
June, and as a co-chair on the Brewery Committee and a homebrewer,
I thought we might try to organize a Homebrew Corner at the event to
complement the 30 or so breweries that will be there.


This is a not for profit event, and for homebrewers it would be only
an exhibition - not a contest - but it seems like a good opportunity 
to spread the word.  Case in point: when I brought up the idea at a
meeting, the response was, "Sounds good, just as long as no one get 
sick from it."  Let's teach 'em a lesson!  


Ideally, I'd like to get six to twelve people to serve their wares at 
the Fest.  You will gain admission to the event, and a chance to showcase
the art of homebrewing side-by-side with microbreweries from around the
country.


I will be losing my Internet account at the end of this month, so anyone
interested should contact me in person.

          re: Beer and Shakespeare
                England, thank God, is a country which doesn't *need* 
          to import beer, and I know of no references to beer imports 
          before the glorious rise of the Dublin stout industry in the 
          mid 18th century. The beer which Falstaff *could* have 
          ordered at the Boar's Head was 'brown bastard', a rich ale, 
          as distinct from the 'small beer' which most households 
          brewed themselves in part as a means of disinfecting and 
          re-flavouring the water. It was very low in alcohol, pallid, 
          and insipid in flavour, a perfectly acceptable soft drink 
          for children -- the Renaissance equivalent of Budweiser.
                Mead, incidentally, is still commercially available in 
          Britain, and as long as you have confidence in your dentist 
          and don't mind the idea of alcoholic Lucozade isn't bad.
                The other crucial connection between Shakespeare and 
          beer is the posthumous patronage of Flowers' brewery of 
          Stratford, which funded the building of the original 
          Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and remains a patron of the 
          RSC. Flowers' bitter is now distributed nationally by one of 
          the big conglomerates -- I think Whitbread -- and continues 
          to bear a portrait of the Bard on its beermats. Merrie 
          Englande at L1.50 a pint (or am I lagging behind 
          inflation?).  On Shakespeare's involvement in the modern 
          drink-marketing business, see Graham Holderness and Bryan 
          Loughrey's piece 'Shakespearean Features' (which reproduces 
          both the Flowers' trademark and the version of the Chandos 
          portrait used on Tesco dry sherry bottles -- at least Tesco 
          know their sack!), published in Jean Marsden's anthology 
          *The Appropriation of Shakespeare* (1991). [not to be 
          confused, incidentally, with Brian Vickers' recent rewrite 
          of the Dunciad, which adopted a similar title].

Perhaps there is little time saving between the Viniator and dunking
bottles in a laundry sink.  My previous technique was to fill a bottle
with sanitizing solution, wait a minute and then pour the sanitizing
solution into the next bottle.  I would go to fresh sanitizer after
5 or 10 bottles.  I prefer to not use the laundry sink method because:

Subject: Aging Ales


Someone asked about aging of ales.  This is a good question
that has a few different answers.


Many brewers have aged ales after the completion of primary
fermentation.  Altbiers and Kolsch, immeadiately come to mind.
In these examples, the beers are actually given a period of
cold conditioning, or lagering,. over a period of 2-3 weeks.
Usually, these beers are filtered prior to serving, but after
the aging period is complete.


English, real ales, are aged, albeit for a brief period of time.
When referring to real ales, it is considered "conditioning" the
ale.  This is a period of between 2 and 7 days, occuring after 
primary fermentation has completed, and of course, in the 
presence of yeast.  During this period finings are added, and
the beer is conditioned until carbonation develops, and the 
expected "star brilliance" is acheived.  


Modern american ales (and most micros fall under this), are 
usually fermented out, and filtered.  The filtering is often
performed as soon as one day after primary is complete.  Once
the "bright beer" is in the bright beer tank, aging is complete,
and the beer will only decline, or hold steady with time.  No
further development of taste, or "mellowing" will occur after
the yeast is removed.  Oxidation/reduction reactions do alter
the beer at this point. 


Some brewers (Sierra Nevada) filter the beer, carbonate to 
about 90% of the final CO2 volumes, then add just enough yeast
and "sugar" to achieve a bottle conditioned, finished beer.  THis
has the advantage of scrubbing the beer of any residual oxygen,
and giving some homebrewers a source of clean yeast.  It is because
of this process that relatively clean yeast can be scavenged from
the SNPA bottles, it is fresh yeast at bottling time.  Other 
brewers rely on keeping oxygen out of the bottle by using 
modern, sophisticated bottling equipment.  Good bottlers spray a
jet of water (hot?) into the top of the just filled bottle, which
causes a good deal of foam to be generated, and the bottle is 
capped quickly as the CO2 froth is foaming out.


The last form of aging is what most of us employ, a period of
warm conditioning where the beer is carbonated naturally, and then
chilled, or a period of cold storage, followed by forced carbon-
ation.  During this period, residual yeasts, can reabsorb 
fermentation byproducts such as diacetyl, and if the yeasts are
not treated roughly (shock excretion), the fermentation byproducts
remain in the yeast cell when the cell dies, and flocculates.
If the normal ferment never produces a high degree of byproducts,
then there is no problem with skipping the reduction step. It is
of interest to note that different yeast strains produce vastly
different amounts of fermentation byproducts, and as such, selection
of yeast strains greatly influence the required aging periods.


In my brewery, I practice some of each method.  Some of each 
batch is put directly into cornelious kegs, a period of cold 
conditioning is followed by coarse filtration.  Sometimes these
beers are served within 2 weeks of brew day.  The other half 
of each batch is primed with sugar, warm conditoned and then 
cold conditioned.




Good brewing,

Last October, I entered my first Homebrew Contest, the Minnesota Brewfest.
The amount of participation exceeded all expectation.  They had over four
hundred entries.  I entered a Scotch Ale that admittedly had some style
problems, due to using the wrong hops. However, When I got my results, it
seemed that either the judges were drinking someone else's entry, or they
put my beer in the wrong category altogether.  My Haggis Chaser Scotch Ale
was judged as a Belgian trippel!  I got a lot of comments like "too much
hop flavor for style", or "too dark for style."  No kidding.


I have since been unable to contact anyone responsible for this.  I want
my $7.50 back.  I suppose it would not help asking for my three fine ales
back.  Belgian Trippel indeed!


Does anyone have an address for the Minnesota Brewers Association?  Does
anyone know who I should accost about their Goofup?

This sounds great! Where o where can I get a copy of the Celebrator Beer

Quick observations:
I read the Digest in <10 mins in the morning-it's not too long for me.


Y'all are right-there are some long- winded people here. But George Fix 
can post the phone book if he wants - it'll be interesting from him!


Newbies, Keep the questions coming! I'm still learning from you.


Thank you one and all - you have finally convinced my brewing partner that 
letting God do it isn't good enough - we _need_ a wort chiller! (He's done
a right fine job of it here in DC this week, though!)

I just acquired a couple of 5 gal. Stainless Steel (SS) soda kegs.


Are there any concerns for using SS kegs as primary and/or secondary
fermentation vessels?


What's the best way to sanitize an SS keg?
Is near-boiling-temperature water adequate for SS sanitization, or do I need
an iodine based sanitizer?


Thanks.

John Palmer gives the following table from Karl King (BT, may/june 92):


>Malt Type     Points
>DME           44
>LME           35
>Pale Malt     29
>Dextrin       20
>Crystal 20    15
>Crystal 40    13        These numbers probably assume an
>Crystal 60    10        infusion mash, and are up for debate.
>Wheat         25
>Vienna        24
>Munich Lt     20
>Munich Dark   18
>Cara Pils     20
>Cara Vienna   15
>Chocolate      3
>Roasted Barley 1
>Black Patent   0


I think most everyone would agree with the DME and LME numbers, more so if you
would add a range (+-10% or so).  The rest of them are certainly up for debate.
HBD participants regularly report greater than 29 points for pale malt, and the
dextrin, crystal, and other malts seem very low.  I guess he does say these are
typical numbers, but the term "typical" could be replaced with "random, and may
have no place in the reality of your home brewery".  Of special interest are
the near zero values for choco, roast, and black.  A recent table showed them
in the 20s I believe.  So, who's right?  Who's left?

Hi, I was wondering if anyone had info on how to startup homebrewing?
Forgive me if it is a naive question but I couldn't find a FAQ. I am
looking for how much it would cost, time involved and hopefully any tips
that you might have. Thanks
