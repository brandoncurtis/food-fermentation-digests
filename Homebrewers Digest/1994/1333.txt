Subject: Burp Castle of NYC vs. White Castle, Kingdom of Sliders?


Fellow Brewheads,
Last week, while enjoying a couple of beers (a1991 Samiclaus and a Duvel; WOW
what a buzz!) at my favorite "Temple of Beer Worship" I noticed a little
flyer announcing a recent lawsuit of Burp Castle (Temple of Beer Worship) by
White Castle (of hamburger fame). Recalling the massive thread in HBD about
Jim Koch and his legal shenanigans, I though for the sake of Belgian beer
lovers everywhere I should post this here. If you've ever been to Burp Castle
and enjoyed it, please send a note. PS: This is the usual disclaimer about
having no financial interest in either places. I don't. I really don't.
However, if you do send a note and include that some guy named "Mike Yee"
posted it to HBD, maybe they'll buy me a beer? ;-)


Cheers and thanks,
some guy named "Mike Yee"


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Dear Burp Castle Patron,


As you might know, White Castle Hamburger Corp. is suing Burp Castle, to stop
using the name "Burp Castle", because they feel poeple will confuse the two
establishments. Please help us explain to them and to the Court, exactly how
much different "Burp Castle" is from White Castle Hamburgers. If possible,
please send us a letter on your stationary with business card, explaining
that the clientelle is not made up of little kids eating tiny hamburgers,
etc...please include your education level(?) and job position(?). Please
remember to include that at "Burp Castle", there is usually a nightly
standing ovation everytime Revel's "Bolero" or "Carmina Burana" or the
"Brandenberg Concertos" are played. And yes, we do not serve hamburgers even
though we love White Castle Hamburgers. Please foward correspondence to above
address.


Thank you for your help.
The Brewist Monks.

Yes, you are right.  This is where all of us who keg get our kegs. 
Very thorough disassembly and cleaning followed by all new gaskets and

Subject: Re: Flamethrowers vs. Burners


  When I went shopping for a burner, I found three basic types.  They
can be grouped easily by the number of individual flames or individual
holes in the burner.


1) ~100 holes, ~35k Btu.  These are the most controllable burners
available, and the most gas efficient.


2) ~25 holes, ~150K Btu, These are powerful, reasonably controllable
and reasonably efficient.


3) 1 hole, ~200 Btu.  Known as Cajun Cookers, jet engines, etc.  These
are very powerful, difficult to control, and very inefficient at low
settings.


  I purchased a burner made by King Kooker, as described in #2 above.
I use a 15 gallon converted SS keg as a boiler, and can bring it to a
boil, even when full in a fairly short time (~20 min).  I hope to
reduce this time even further by using the recomendation posted here
for a heat jacket. While I have not kept record of gas fills, I think
I get about 3-5 10 gallon all grain batches per cylinder. (I think
it's 20lbs, it's about 20" tall, 14" in diameter) I heat 5 gallons of
mash water, 10 gallons of sparge water and boil a total of 75 minutes
to 2 hours. I had the good fortune to scavenge a second cylinder, so I
can run the first one totally empty before getting it refilled,
without fear of running out of gas in the middle of a batch.

Subject: Book review:  "Evaluating Beer"


Just acquired the recently published book by Brewers Publications,
"Evaluating Beer".  After giving it a thorough skimming, I would recommend it
very highly.  Many of the questions that get posted here would probably get
answered with this book.  A lot of diagnostic info for flavor, aroma and
appearance here.  Also has tips for recreating each of the off-flavors,
aromas, etc., for those of you trying to improve your judging skills.


You can get this through the Association of Brewers (usually in the catalog
in the middle of most Zymurgy mags) or from your friendly homebrew supplier. 
Highly recommended, IMHO.


Just a satisfied customer---no connection.

  OFFICE MEMO          Glucose tests                          Date:1/22/94
Robert Kaye inquired about testing priming sugar levels with tests used by
diabetics.  I've never tested my beer that way, but I frequently test my blood.
  Standard home blood glucose tests (e.g., ChemStrip bG by Boehringer Mannheim)
have a sensitive range from 20 to 800 mg per 100 cc.  (Normal range for humans
is 60 to 140.)  I calculate (check me) that priming doses (say, 100 grams corn
sugar in a 20 liter batch) are about 500 mg/100cc.  You might dilute the wort
by a factor of 4 to get it into the most accurate range.  The strips can be
read by color chart or by machine.  They cost about 50 cents each.
  In the old days, diabetics did urine tests by dropping a pill into a
test-tube specimen.  It was essentially a Fehlings solution test.  As I recall,
the tests were not in any way quantitative (ANY sugar in the urine is too
much), but a chemist could probably help you on that.

Q1:  I understand that there is to be a Microbrewer's Festival on the
     weekend 2/18-19 in/around Albany, NY.  However, I've heard that on 
     Friday 2/18 the event is in Saratoga, and the 2/19 event is indeed
     in Albany.  If anyone can confirm and advise as to which may be the
     'better' event (based upon 'vendor attendance'), please do - as I 
     will only be allowed to use 1 weekend evening.  If you know of the 
     brewers attending, also please include. TIA.
     
Q2:  New to me is the BrewCap contraption. I'm hesitant to use it, fearing
     5 gal throughout my carpets.  If anyone has any experienced tips for
     using this thing, please pass along.  I admit I'm very curious about
     it and sounds like a good idea, but I'd like to get all the angles
     beforehand, and the bad experiences second-hand. Thanks.

Subject: yeast flavor tests ( was "big brewing" )




( Catching up on old Home Brew Digests ... )


Spencer Thomas notes :


"A friend wanted to "check out" a bunch of yeasts from his yeast bank
 for flavor profile, etc.  He decided to do a "yeastola" (modeled, sort
 of, on our club's annual "brewola", where everyone brews the same
 recipe).  But how to distinguish yeast character from differences in
 brewing style?  Make one big batch of wort, of course! ..."


        < description of thermonuclear-powered steam-driven brew
          machine omitted in the interests of not provoking envy >


"We filled 10 5 gallon carboys with beer, and pitched a different (ale)
 yeast into each.  One is happily bubbling in my basement.  The next
 fun comes in a month or so when we get together to taste them all!"




Um, Spencer, it seems very likely that by relocating the ten carboys to
multiple locations, you have subjected them to a superabundance of both
kinetic and thermal impacts, and to some degree blown the experiment.


I'm not trying to be defeatist, here, but consider ... in their diverse
and physically separate environments, they'll be exposed to different
schedules, levels, and spectrums of electromagnetic energy. At its most
simple, all of the samples will reach different average temperatures in
their different locations ... and it's well established that temperature
and yeast production _are_ associated, specifically, with temperature.


More complex questions to be answered would be ...


        - at what rate carboys oscillated up and down around this mean
          temperature, how far, and at what rate ;


        - what other frequencies they are exposed to beside infrared,
          or 'heat' radiation ... such as AC fields from nearby walls,
          as well as visible light ;


        - the thermal mass of the environment they are in and the sort
          of insulation, if any, between the carboy and the thermal
          mass of the building. ( A cold cement basement floor sucks
          the heat right out of a glass carboy in contact with it, but
          a plastic milk crate is a good insulator, for instance, but
          this still doesn't account for differing air temperatures. )


        - Open-minded people might be intrigued by the consideration of
          another interesting variable ... 'orgone', or 'Reichian' fields.
          That is, do growth rates of yeast populations vary as a direct
          consequence of the proximity of other yeast populations ; does
          this variation also occur with respect to the proximate micro-
          -flora or microflorae ; what intervening materials influence
          this process, and how.


        - I suppose gravity ought to be considered, too, but this may be
          outside the budget of your average homebrew club, graviton
          polarizers being quite expensive last time I looked them up in
          _NASA Tech Briefs_.        (-:




I really like this idea of controlled tests for yeast flavors, in general.
 ... but I think more controls need to be established before it can be usable
by others as definitive data.


How about making a bunch of one-gallon jugs of wort on site A, where the
club meets, then relocating them, en masse, to site B, where there is the
room to cultivate them ... then, inoculating them, en masse, with the
previously inoculated yeast cultures prepared from a similarly controlled
and rigorous batch of 'culturing' wort ?


Put them all on a couple of brick-and-board bookcases, or on a card table
set up in a corner somewhere ... and wait N weeks.


Yours for rigorous scientific procedure ...

Subject: Re:  Kolsch/Extract-Dry or Liquid?


To Chris McDermott on the Kolsch question:
Can't help out too much recipe-wise, but be aware that Wyeast has a Kolsch
yeast that is very good.  It is one of the new Brewers Choice strains (no
starter pack).  The number is #2565.  I tried it out on my "Liquid Lunch"
recipe, fermented at about 69 degrees.  This yeast ferments *very* clean for
an ale yeast.  It could be used to simulate a lager for those of us without
temp control.


To Todd Carlson on the subject of dry or liquid malt extract:
I may be wrong, but dry or liquid ME both work just dandy.  The brand and
type you use has much more to do with the quality of the end result you brew
than its wetness.


Which brings up the question:  After the Brewing Techniques article on the
quality of malt extracts on the market, has anyone gotten info on various
malt extracts with regard to their makeup (what kind malt, any adjuncts,
sugar) and free available nitrogen (FAN)?  The last attempt I have ever seen
to let consumers know what the various extract were made of was the special
issue Zymurgy from about 6 years ago.  I'm sure things have probably changed
somewhat, and there are some extracts on the market now that weren't around
then.  Has anyone done some sort of update?

Subject: Help w/GA in hop formula


Brewers,


There seems to be an error in the Zymurgy special hop issue, page 53-54. 
Jackie Rager's article on calculating hop bitterness.  I suspect this is
common knowledge, and would be grateful to be "clued in".  The problem is
in the gravity adjustment calculation.  The general formula is as follows:
GA=GB-.050/.2.  The example that Jackie gives is as follows: 
GA=1.096-.050/.2=.24.  When I plug the example into my calculator, I come
up with: 1.096-.050/.2=5.23.  My question is, is the error in the formula
itself or is the .24 result a typo or do I need a barley wine to set me
straight?  Don't answer that last one, but please reply directly to
cvirgilio`at`electriciti.com.


Thank you.




Cheers,

Subject: Commercial Bock beers....??


While it is admittedly still January, 40 degrees ABOVE zero F in the Windy
City turns a young man's thoughts to the wonderful pleasures of spring:
convertibles, barbecues, and MOST importantly, BOCKS!


So, I am putting together a VERY comprehensive Bock tasting, and am trying to
make sure that I have obtained samples of all readily available "Bock" beers.
(Whether they are true Bocks or not!  I intend to "call a Bock a Bock" DURING
the tasting, but will allow _poseurs_ to enter the tasting up front.  The
truth shall triumph in the end!).


Here's what's on the list so far:


DOMESTIC:
Augsberger Bock
Augsberger Doppelbock
Baderbrau Bock
Celis Pale Bock
Cherry Land Brewing Apple Bach (sic)
Huber Bock
Point Bock
Schell Bock
Shiner Bock
Sierra Nevada Pale Bock


IMPORTS:
Aaas Bock
Ayinger Maibock
Ayinger Celebrator
EKU Kulminator
EKU Kulminator 28
Erdinger Pikantus Weizenbock
Paulaner Salvator
Spaten Franziskus Heller Bock
Spaten Premium Bock
Spaten Optimator


I have gotten MOST of these already and am reasonably certain I can get the
rest without major difficulty.  But have I overlooked some really obvious
ones?  I want this to be the definitive bock beer tasting - if it comes into
the USA, then I want that bock!  I turn to the collective HBD Wisdom for
guidance.  Private e-mail is fine.  TIA!

Subject: OVEN STERILE




I saw quite a few postings on here about sterilizing bottles in the oven
so I thought I would give it a try.


I soaked my bottles in my cleaning solution to get all the nasty stuff
out and then put them in the oven with tin foil over the bottles for
about 20 min at around 375F (couldn't really tell, it's an old oven)


Sure, I think it was a little more work, but I like the fact that you
can set the bottles aside as long as the foil remains in place. Instead
of having to clean the bottles and then fill them right away, I sterilized
in the oven and then filled them the next day. I'm usually stuck doing
the whole brewing process by myself and I thought it made things easier
that way.




I brewed something akin to Papizan's Holiday Ale (from extract). Came out
great. My only problem is that since my last batch (a dopplebock) was
seriously undercarbonated, I tried to make up for it in this batch.


Glass grenades is no understatement. I've had two bottles blow up
already. I put the remaining ones in the fridge. After they're cooled
down, the carbonation calms down a bit.


3/4 cup 3/4cup 3/4cup 3/4cup. I get it now.


In simpler terms: Oven sterilization=good. Overcarbonation=bad.
PS: any recipies for bitters? (extract+grain or extract)

Subject: How long to prime???




Can anyone tell me how long one lets the beer sit in the priming
vessel after the priming sugar is added? My book just says to
siphon into the container, add 3/4 cup sugar, then bottle but it
doesn't list any time to wait or anything. Should I wait an hour
or two for mixing/sediment settling or just mix in the sugar
and bottle right away???


Thanx & cheers,

Thanks to all who held my hand about my yeast worries. I tried two bottles

                      BrewArt collection, vol. #2
Welcome to the BrewArt Collection, volume #2 (for Macintosh)!


copyright 1994 George (Ty) Tempel




ABSTRACT:
This collection is the second edition of a set of brewing
related clip art that I am in the process of creating and
compiling. I have used some of these elements on my beer
labels, and a few of my network-friends have found them 
helpful as well.


DESCRIPTION:
The artwork is provided in the form of PICT files, which
are easily handled by nearly all major applications in
the Macintosh universe. I considered converting some stuff
to EPS (postscript) format, but not everyone out there has
access to nice postscript printers, such as myself. Since
the files are PICTS, it is feasible to convert them to
one or more various DOS/Windows formats, but you will loose
information in the conversion process. Since I don't have
a DOS/Windows machine (insert large grin here), I cannot
do the conversion for you, so it is left as an exercise
for the user (didn't you hate it when textbooks would
do that?).


Also, as an added feature, any text in the clip art is
provided in the form of bezier outlines, so you don't
need to have the fonts on your system. This allows
a safe distribution method, as fonts are copyrighted
and usually cannot be freely distributed. Most of the
advanced graphics software today has the ability to convert
outline fonts (PostScript or TrueType) into bezier
outlines that can be edited with the application, just as
if you had drawn them yourself.




Just for the record, I created the artwork using
Canvas 3.5, Color-It 2.3.2, and Adobe Streamline 3.
Some of the artwork is pre-colored, but you can change 
that if you like. I have an accellerated Macintosh II 
(Dove Racer, 32MHz), a DeskWriter inkjet printer, 
and the Logitech ScanMan. I also find that if you wish
to use Avery labels, try to find a box of #5164, which
are 3.33" x 4". They come right off of the bottle when
you use a little B-Brite cleanser, and some graphics
programs support the Avery label formats for templates
(mine didn't, however).


THE FINE PRINT:
This collection is released as brew/credit-ware (I know,
an awkward term, but you'll see that it fits). If you
decide to use any of the clip art from the collection, you
must give me, George (Ty) Tempel, partial credit for the
artwork and send me a bottle of the homebrew that you've
labelled. It's just that simple. No messy fees, etc. Please
remember that it is unlawful to send alcohol via the
US Postal Service, but private carriers (UPS, FedEx, Airborne,
etc), _can_ ship the stuff, just make sure that the brew
is securely packaged (try placing the bottles into tight
plastic bags just in case...). I have shipped several
bottles without problems, but sometimes I label the
contents as "food", "yeast culture equipment", or "glassware"
and have never had a problem (knock on formica).

 Seems I managed to dip my thermometer/hydrometer into the cooling
 wort a bit too soon and leave it a bit too long. It pegged the meter,
 so to speak. Even after cooling and storing upright for a coupla
 daze, the mercury inthe thermomter portion hasnt settled back to te
 bottom. In fact, it's now 'split' into two portions - at the bottom
 (claims the room temp is about 45), and a bit at the top.


 I've tried 'shaking' the mercury down like the nurse used to do with
 the thremometer at the Drs office, but it didnt seem to help.


 Is my thermometer useless/unfixable?

Subject: Wyeast 1084 (Irish)


I made a 3-liter starter, fermented it to completion, and bottled it in
12-oz. bottles, as described in an earlier article in HBD. The first
bottle went into a 1-liter starter, and is now feverishly fermenting 
5 gallons of stout.


The yeast FAQ says that 1084 is "great for stouts" and "very niced for any
any cold-weather ale, at its best in stouts and Scotch ales." Question:
how would it be in an ordinary pale ale, brown ale, or IPA? Porter?

Subject: Help w/GA in hop formula


Brewers,


There seems to be an error in the Zymurgy special hop issue, page 53-54. 
Jackie Rager's article on calculating hop bitterness.  I suspect this is
common knowledge, and would be grateful to be "clued in".  The problem is
in the gravity adjustment calculation.  The general formula is as follows:
GA=GB-.050/.2.  The example that Jackie gives is as follows: 
GA=1.096-.050/.2=.24.  When I plug the example into my calculator, I come
up with: 1.096-.050/.2=5.23.  My question is, is the error in the formula
itself or is the .24 result a typo or do I need a barley wine to set me
straight?  Don't answer that last one, but please reply directly to
cvirgilio`at`electriciti.com.


Thank you.

Look out Hot Liquor Tank, move over Easysparger, here comes the 
Mr. SpargeWater Spargatron 6000!


Total cost:  $0 - $25, depending on what you have around the house
"Oh please!  Tell us more!"
The Mr. SpargeWater Spargatron 6000 is an automatic sparge water delivery 
system that does not take up space on the stove and delivers water at about 
150F (give or take*) at the rate of 3 gallons/hr.
"How do we get one?"
Simple!  Just hack up that old drip coffee maker you never got around to 
repairing!  That's right, tear off the top, connect the IN side to a bucket 
of cold water, and the OUT side to a hose leading to your lauter tun.  
Plug 'er in and let 'er drip!  No muss, no fuss.  No cost.  Of course, you 
can also use the Spargatron Deluxe, which involves a minor expense for a 
few PVC bits so the water will sprinkle gently over the grain bed.  Your only 
other expense is for a water bucket (3 gallon ice cream bucket at $.25-$1.00)
and a coffee maker if you don't already have one ($5 at the local junk shop). 
 
Act now, and as an added bonus, the Mr. SpargeWater Spargatron 6000 will 
annoy your dog for hours at no extra cost!




*Temperature will vary with the model of coffee maker, length of delivery 
tube, insulation, temp of cold water etc.  150F (temperature from 
prototype, a 12 cup melita with a 3.5' delivery hose and very cold tap 
water) may be considered low by some purists.  Would you rather stand there 
the whole time?

Falstaff was brewed in St. Louis (where else?) by the Griesedieck family for
many generations. The Falstaff brewery was a stone's throw away from Big
Brother Anheuser Busch. 


As far as I know, the beer was available through the '70s, and possibly into
the early '80s. It was indeed cheap, and was very popular here in Budweiser's
back yard.


Today, one of the descendants of the family is a distributor of imports and

- -----------------


My experience is somewhat different on the darker grains. Using Noonan's
formulas in his Lager book, I can predict my final gravity to an accuracy
of a few points. His formula is used in the following way.


1        First multiply the number of pounds of ingredient by the extraction
rate, then divide by the total number of gallons of final wort: 


        E = (#1*R1 + #2*R2 + #3*R3 + ...)/G


where #n is the number of pounds of each ingredient, Rn is the extraction
rate of each ingredient, and G is the final number of gallons of wort.


2        Then calculate the number of degrees balling by the following formula:


        B = (3100 * E)/(259 + B)


where you must iterate the answer for B using a hand calculator or use
the equivalent formula


        B = SQRT(16,700 + 3,100 * E) - 130


Once you have B you can calculate the og by weight or volume using the
formula that converts B to og. This is given in the back of his book.


Noonan also gives extraction rates for various grains, extracts, and adjuncts.


I have found this method so accurate that I have used it to refine several
recipes which have become my standard. I don't even think about extracton 
any more except when I am working out a new recipe.


Finally, going all-grain really helps to nail down the og-fg nightmare.
Grains are far more predictable than extracts.


Happy brewing,
Florian

My understanding is that the W34/70 is one of the most popular in

Your apparent attenuation appears reasonable (about 77%
(i.e. 1-(0.010/0.043))), so you should not be blaming your
unfermentable content or your yeast.  The problem is your
OG.  If you want a stronger beer, you will have to use more
malt or (egads!) add dextrose.  I recommend you add a pound
of M&F Plain Light Dry Malt Extract and increase your hops a
little to compensate for the increase in unhopped malt.

Not any more.  They used to, but now use the Liberty Ale strain for the
Porter.  Personally, I liked the Steam(tm) yeast version better -- it was

>From 1/21/94 digest, someone requested a beer bread recipe.  Since I seemed
to have trashed that edition and don't know who to post it to, I'll have to
take up some of this coveted digest space.  (Perhaps a taste of this bread
will make it worth it?)  Note that these are rough measures (I like to
improvise).  BTW, kneading makes for great stress reliever --yes I'm trying
to write a thesis here!  Here goes:


       1. Mix 2T (Red Star) yeast w/ 1/2 c. warm water.  Set aside to proof.
       2. Put 3c wheat flour and 3c white flour in large bowl.  Stir in the
proofed yeast and 4 eggs, about 4 cups beer (I like Anchor Steam for this),
1/2 cup honey, and about 6 T melted butter.  (Butter IS better than that
plastic stuff!) (And yes I'm studying Dairy Mktg).
       3. Beat with wooden spoon (I use my brew spoon) --about 100x).           
       4. Cover.  Let rise in warm place for 1 hour.
       5. Mix 6 cups of white flour with about 5 or 6 teaspoons salt.
       6. Work this into dough.  Put dough on floured surface and knead for
about 15 minutes (depending on stress level), until dough is smooth,
"elastic".(If wet/sticky, add more flour.)
       7. Place dough in buttered bowl.  Cover.  Let rise in warm place
until doubled in size (approx. 1 hour). Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
       8. Punch down dough.  Turn onto floured surface.  Shape into 4 equal
sized balls.  Let rest a few minutes, then knead each one for a while. 
Roll into loaves and place in greased 9x5 pans.  Let rise again in warm
place for about 15 minutes.
       9. Slash top of each loaf, and brush with a mixture of egg white and
a little water.  (You can also sprinkle on top any kind of seeds at this
point --I like sesame.)  Bake 40-45 minutes.  (They are done if you tap the
bottom of the pan and it sounds hollow.)  Take out of pans and let cool on
rack.
       10. Pop a homebrew and enjoy!  (Extras freeze great too!)

Now, a quick question regarding a hard cider which I started back in
October.  It's probably actually more like a mead, since I added 4 cups of
honey to the (5 gal) batch.  I used 2 packets of champagne yeast, and since
most of my equipment was out on loan, I took no readings or measurements.  


Anyway, it is now January and the stuff is still in the primary!  It has
cleared up beautifully, and I am anxious to get it in bottles but I don't
want to bother until my thesis is done.  (March???)  Any advice here would
be welcome.  (This is the first time I have attempted any brews other than
beer.) Thanks.

Ok, Ok, I give up!


Can someone squirt me the inside info on how to subscribe to "Beer Across 
America"?  It sounds like a wonderful subscription, and the increasing 
references to this are just driving me crazy.


Thanks!
