Just a data point for your tasting: Celis Bock is actually a Belgian style
ale, but is labelled a Bock because of "less than rational" Texas laws. From
living in Texas many years, I can tell you that Shiner Bock is not really
worth serious consideration in the genre of German Bock:  I believe the main
attraction to that beer is that it could be had for $4.50/case + dep.(in 1980
anyway).  A cultish kind of beer.            


Also, didn't you omit Samuel Adam's Double Bock (what the heck is Samuel
Adams - a presumed American Patriot - doing brewing a German Bock??)

I have used yeast blends in beers such as IPA, Barley Wine, and Porter with
good results.  Depending on how much you like diacetyl, you can vary the
proportion of 1084 Irish Ale culture.  I personally like diacetyl at
slightly above threshold level: at this level it adds complexity and
a slight "sweetness".  If you use only 1084 Irish Ale yeast in your
beer, you will get a very noticable diacetyl character.  I have used
1007 German Ale and 1084 Irish Ale in a 80% / 20% blend with good
results for several of the beer styles that you describe.  


The 1007 German Ale strain is a good choice (IMHO) for many English 
Ales because it finishes rather dry and produces a fair amount of esters.

I reccommend cooling the thermometer as cool as possible, preferably in 
liquid nitrogen or dry ice.  Then let it warm slowly.  
 
The real idea here is to suck ALL the mercury into the bulb, so you 
need to chill it to that point.  Salted ice wated may work.


This technique often works.

The Irish 1084 is an excellent yeast for all types of ale. I've used it
in a variety including stout, porter, red, brown, and pale. It goes in
fast, kicks ass, and cleans up well afterwards. No icky-poo smells and
tastes. It seems to ravage even when I don't promote it with a starter.
It's my favorite yeast for ales.


The Lambic from Wyeast is another really good one.

>  You really have to seal petri
dishes well (I use parafilm) and I prefer liquid because I feel there is less
exposed area (like agar where there is no yeast growth *???*) and liquids can 
be sealed and transfered sterile more easily.  My culture fridge is verboten 
for any other storage. (* I store beer in there too..but that's yeast +)


*   I would question relying solely on liquid cultures. One major advantage 
of the use of plates is that you can SEE single colonies.  Even with slants
you are able to get an idea if there is significant/obvious contamination.


Additionally, it is my belief that slants/plates can last longer as a 
stable culture than a liquid culture.  Due mainly to the fact that the
medium is solid, therefore nutrients will diffuse to the culture in a 
slower fashion, thereby lasting longer than if they were all available
at once.  In micro labs most cultures are STORED on slants, plates, or
frozen for longer term storage. It is rare to store a culture in a liquid
medium. 


Also:  for the average home rancher use of an inoculating loop and flame
are more readily available than sterilized pipets for liquid transfers.  
I do re-use dregs, and will store them in flasks for a week or so, but
prefer to work from my pure cultures, on plates and slants in the fridge,
and feel I've had less contamination problems with this approach than 
from use/storage of liquid forms of cultures.


I would at least suggest if you choose to maintain cultures in liquid it
would be worth your while to streak out a plate once in a while and check
for contamination. If you have a microscope...even better.  But...




* Another Note:   I have seen methods for sterilizing filter paper
for use with plate cultures.  (blots)


The method involved placing the filter paper in the microwave with a 
beaker of water and microwaving for 30 sec- min.  If I remember right
the filter paper was wrapped inside foil.  I tried this, and did not find
contamination due to the filter paper. Controls showed contamination when
using non-"waved" filter paper.


Bottom Line:  IMHO Microwaving WILL sterilize things, but if the goods
are dry it is necessary to have water present in the microwave at the
same time, to absorb some of the waves, or damage to the unit can occur.

Suggestion:  Get or borrow a hole cutting bit for a drill and do it right.
At least use a compass (face north) and draw a good circle.  Then drill loads
of pilot holes around the perimiter (Little ones) and fine tune it with the
razor blade.


Also: You must choose the height. For a primary "siphonless" fermenter
I like to leave some room, about 3/4 inch up from the base.  Reduces my 
trubbles in a transfer to a secondary.  For a bottling bucket ONLY go right
near the bottom.


NOTES:  When filling bottles don't turn the valve off all the way in between
bottles, or you'll lose the liquid in the tube.  Also watch for excess
oxidation of the last bottle (or so) due to air coming in the through the
valve as you near emptiness.


Otherwise, it works well.  Go for it! (you can cover it with a lid while 
bottling too, even purge with CO2  :)

>        Well, there exist three homebrew supply shops in SLC.  I've been
frequenting Mountain Brew on about 2700 South State for the two years I've
been brewing, although I first got set up at Art's Brewing Supplies at
(I'm almost positive) 650 South Washington Street (250 West).  Art's is a
little more expensive, but for a serious homebrewer, he is more experienced
and offers ambitious advice.  His shop is also worth visiting even if it is
a little more expensive, the whole shop has quite an atmosphere. 
Mountain Brew has a bigger collection of kits, and if you know exactly
what you want to get, you may as well buy it there and save a little. 




*  Rattle my change....I dunno 'bout that one.  My experiences have been
quite the opposite.  I guess I can't compare the extracts, since I don't
use them, but as for grain and gadgets I've definitely found Art to be
cheaper.  I find him to be rather slimy at times, but he's a business man.
I was never impressed by the selection at Mnt Brew, whereas Art has some
serious supplies on hand, usually well stocked with most stuff.


He also sells hop rhizomes in the spring. He's got some nice vines 
growing around the place.  Fun to fondle his cones when stopping by.
It was even more fun to play with my own...once I got 'em growing.
I've found his advice somewhat mixed. But I find the same thing here :)


As for Mnt Brew, one thing I did like was their large supply of Vierka
wine yeasts, including a MEAD yeast.  Many styles offered.


No connection with either of them. I've bought stuff at both.
I mostly mail order now. Salt Lake is a fair drive from Logan, 
but when I do get down there...


    My advise. Call both and get their catalogs. Decide for yourself.  :)

Subject: Hazelnut extract source


Fellow Brewers,                                                         
                                                                        
  I have found a great source for natural extracts.  I tasted the Oregon
Nut Brown Ale featured in Zymurgy and found it to be one of my favorite 
beers tasted this year (and that covers alot of beers).  I couldn't find
any hazelnut extract in the stores however and I talked with several    
brewers and couldn't get any info.  I found a company near LA that makes
baking extracts and extract syrups used for flavoring coffees. I bought 
a 2 lb jar with a pump dispenser for $19 plus $3 shipping and they gave 
me a 1 oz sample of the 100% pure extract after I told them what I was  
brewing beer.                                                           
                                                                        
  So, I brewed 3 batches of Nut Brown Ale (4 gallons each).  In one of  
the batches, I used a Hazelnut Extract (100% pure, 1 oz). In another I  
used a Hazelnut Syrup (used for flavoring coffee, 4 oz).  The 3rd beer  
was not flavored.  These beers were well received by my homebrew clubs  
as well as other brewers. The pure extract needed more aroma (probably  
use 2 oz per 5 gallons next time) and the syrup had a very strong       
hazelnut aroma as well as a drier mouth feel from the additional        
fermentation.  The syrup is made with some form of fructose sugar but it
did not impart any odd flavors. I would use about 3 oz per 5 gallon next
time.                                                                   
                                                                        
  The name of the place is Capriccio and is located in Chatsworth, CA   
(phone (310) 535-6610).  They have over 100 different pure extracts    
and over 50 flavors of the syrups used to flavor coffee.  The only      
problem that I had was buying such a large quantity of the syrup.  You  
can only drink so much of this beer.  The pure extract is more          
expensive but you can buy 1 lb jars.                                    
                                                                        
  I have nothing to do with this company other than being a happy       
camper by making odd beers with their product and drinking them.

Aromatic Malt
        I used DeWolfe Coysins Belgian Aromatic Malt for the
first time today in a Marzen. Use it as 1 lb of my 12 lb grain
bill. This stuff smells wonderfully promising. I am hopeful
of it adding a super-malty taste to my Marzen.
        Question -- I also mashed using a Double Decoction.
When I mixed the malts all together at the beginning of the mash
it smelt very malty. But after two decoction boils it did not
seem nearly so malty and in fact smelled like any other grain
mash I have done. Do you think that the high temperatures of the
decoction boil would have driven off some of the malty taste
and aroma of the Aromatic Malt? Or am I just worrying about
nothing. Anyone else have experience using DFC Aromatic? I love
to hear about your success.


Secondary in Stainless
        Thanks to all of you how helped me how to conduct
a low pressure secondary in stainless steel kegs. Many suggested
knocking out the poppet valve in the tower then attaching a hose 
over the tower and lead the tubing to a water jug a la a blowoff
tube.
        I found that you don't have to rip apart your valves. Just
unscrew the gas tower. You can get tubing which will fit snuggly
over the threads. Then (because I am cheap) I went through a few
diameter reductions in tubing (fitting the next smaller size into
the larger feed tube) and finally settled down to a four foot
length of 3/8" tubing. Seems to work great!

Not quite.
You've "got it" that you *really* want to avoid overcarbonating, so keep
a careful upper bound on the amount of priming sugar.  So far, so good.


Next comes "weigh,don't-measure  weigh,don't-measure  weigh,don't-measure"


Measuring sugar, in any form ground finer than ordinary table sugar, is
bound to be *seriously* inaccurate.  This applies in particular to dry
malt extract and to dextrose (corn sugar) in the form normally sold in
homebrew shops...these can pack down to lose 20-25% of their volume!
(This refers to "packing" by just tapping the container to settle it.)
In other words, your 3/4 cup of dextrose might be equivalent to somebody
else's full cup.  That's a big difference, and in particular it leaves you
with no margin for error.


One other thought: darker and heavier beers tend to have more "unfermen-
tables" that are really "slowly-fermentables"--they'll ferment after a
while.  Two ways to deal with this:
  * Be patient; be sure you've given a heavy beer enough time to "ferment
    out" before bottling.
  * Back off on the priming a little bit, in anticipation of getting some
    extra kick from the residuals in the beer itself.

A minor nit:
This is not quite true, life is more complicated than that.
Final gravity drops approximately 1.5 points for every % alcohol by volume.
For example, if you measure 1012 f.g. with 5% ABV the dextrin contents alone
would give a gravity of 1020. 


By the way, the point you were making is of course still valid...

There is one homebrew shop here in Ft. Walton, and I believe there are
stores in Pensacola and Panama City, too, but don't quote me on that one.
The local shop is ``The Spare Bedroom Winery Supply'', run by Don and
Shirley Allison.  The number there is (904) 862-4032.  Address is
656A Beal Pkwy / Ft. Walton Beach, FL 32547.


Btw, there are quite a few brewers in this area (though I must admit, I
haven't been to any of the local meetings---they meet on Tuesday nights,
and that just doesn't work out on this end).  As a result, I'm not sure
just how many homebrewers are in this area, but I do know that the various
grocery/liquor stores have little choice but to stock a reasonable supply
of import/micro-brew beer (it's not a great supply, mind you, but not bad,
either, especially considering the fact that this isn't what most people
would call a big city...but then, it's about as big as I can handle as it

Hi,
I'm reposting this since I got few responses last time.  First, do many people
add dextrin and crystal malts at the mashout or in the beginning of the mash.
Thinking about it, wouldn't the enzymes in the mass breakdown the dextrins that
you are adding these malts for in the first place?
Secondly, does anyone have any info. on the price and distributers for the
Glatt Mill.  He has been unresponsive and says he does not distribute from
his home anymore, only through distributers.
Thirdly, I have sent in a card in response to the Sam Adams Newsletter for
a free t-shirt.  All I recieved so far has been more newsletters telling
me about the wonders and great traditions of Sam Adams.  This included how
baseball players in the early days used to come by the original family
brewery and dip their mugs right into the copper kettle to get fresh beer.
I guess they were real men and just drank hot sweet wort!
Thanks,
Andy Kligerman
now living on 10 acres with my own well and first brew in the secondary (
first brew in the new homestead, that is).

Spencer forgot to mention the reason you start with 1/2 gallon or so of wort 
BEFORE you add boiling hot sugar water.  Here's why he suggests this.  If 
you put in the boiling liquid without any wort to absorb the heat, your 
carboy makes the most interesting CRACK sound!  Since then, I've always 
covered my sugar water solutions while they're still boiling, and then let 
them sit and cool to room temp.

   Hi All,


      Just a quick anecdote regarding the shipping of brew.  In HBD 1334,
<STOREY`at`fender.msfc.nasa.gov> writes:


>It is shipped to me by RPS
>These guys know *exactly* what is in the box.


      My father-in-law gave me a subscription to Beer Across America for
Christmas.  I happened to be home the other day when the guy from RPS
showed up.  As I had just stepped out of the shower, I left the poor
fellow on the front porch while I scrambled around looking for a robe.
The temperature was a balmy -8F (God, I love New England winters).  When
I finally answered the door, I asked the guy why he didn't just leave the
package, and he said, "Hey, I didn't want your beer to freeze."
      Makes you wonder if this "no alcohol" rule is just UPS weirdness.


*************


      John Montgomery asks about pitching temperatures for lagers.  You
should chill the wort to 48-50F prior to pitching.  Pitching into room
temperature wort will result in faster starts, but will also result in
high levels of diacetyl and ester production.  Depending on the strain of
yeast, there may be more of these substances produced than the yeast can
reduce later on.  If you then move the fermenter from room temperature to
refridgerator temps, some of the yeast will die from temperature shock.
      The trick is to pitch *very large* amounts of yeast at 48-50F,
which will minimize the lag time without producing off flavors in the
finished product.  I'd also recommend an external controller for your
fridge, as you may find it difficult to get the fridge to 50F using it's
built in controller.
      While on the subject, I've heard the Hunter Airstat is no longer
being made.  Does anyone know of something equivalent??  I'd like to 
pick up another one.

Paul Writes: Recent openings (now two weeks after) have little fiz at all.
 
 I had this problem once, I attributed it to poor mixing of the priming
 sugar. Usually, I put the sugar water in the bottling bucket and rack
 the beer onto it thus mixing it well as the beer flows in. In my batch
 that had uneven carbonation I forgot and added the sugar almost at the
 end. I assume the heavier SG solution sank to the bottom thus
 overcarbonating the first few bottles and under carbonating the rest.
 Losing my abnesia solved the problem. Hope yours is that simple.

In #1334, Ulick noted, in response to my Grolsch top meltdown,
that he removes his Grolsch tops prior to sanitizing.


I'm curious: do you mean that you remove just the rubber gasket
or is it the entire metal "cage" and (ceramic) top works?


If it's the whole shebang, do you sanitize it separately?  As you
know, the top has a little nub that protrudes through the gasket,
and is a potential infectant carrier.  Also, does
removing/reinstalling that fatigue the metal?

Sure, its a very common aeriation technique. Get a .2 micron filter to ensure
clean air into the carboy.  Remember that air only contains 20% O2, so the
levels of dissolved oxygen will be lower than when using pure O2.

5-10% caramel malt, single infusion at 152F, mash off at 170.  Add Perle or
Cascade (whole hops work better for me) about 1-2 oz for kettle hop, finish
and or flavor hop with 1-2 oz Cascade, and dry hopping helps, with about 
1/2-1 oz cascade.  Wyeast 1056. OG 1.050ish, FG 1.012ish.

Your friend was misinformed. Pyruvic acid is the normal precursor to

I suggest leaving them loose, and using a copper scrubby with a rubber band

Regarding Paul Austin's flat steam beer:  I think that you didn't mix your

Why the London?  This is not a flame, I'm just curious.  London is famous for
its porters, whereas the good bitters are from Burton-on-Trent and scattered
parts, no?  I would assume that the British ale yeast would be best for
bitters (and best bitters).  Of course, this is assuming that Wyeast's naming
scheme is something more than random choice of names (bad assumption?).

Actually, the terminal gravity would be less than this due to the addition
of EtOH (s.g. <1) to the beer.  This is similar to the difference between
real attenuation and apparent attenuation.  Apparent attenuations tend to
be between 70 and 80%, in other words, the s.g. drops 70-80% of the amount
above 1.000 during fermentation.  In fact, the amount of material actually 
fermented is more like 55-60% (is this number right?  It's something like
this).  The EtOH makes it seem like the attenuation is higher.

This last statement is doubly (a word?) wrong.
Alcohol tolerance rarely limits the degree of attenuation.  Most yeasts
can handle at least 8% EtOH, which means that, roughly, a wort of OG 1.080
can be fermented without limitation by alcohol tolerance.  Final gravities
are above 1.000 because the OG is made up of unfermentable material (as in
your example above) such as dextrins, proteins, etc.  If all of the material
contributing to the fraction of the OG over 1.000 were fermented the FG would
be <1.000 due to the EtOH.

in that cooler to a depth of 7 inches. Of course, it would be wet at this
point.
Also, the common amount of water quoted for mashing is 1.3-1.5 quarts per lb of
dry grain. On my last batch, porter, my grain bed depth was about equal to the
cross section dimension, but I didn't get stuck (whew).


         2.)  How much will the temperature drop in
           45 to 60 minutes using a single infusion
           mash?
I preheat my cooler with boiling water, so that when I add my mash, I don't
lose heat to the walls. I have not experienced more than a one degree drop in
temp over the hour that I mash, according to the dairy thermometer that I leave
floating in there. Its a good cooler and I put the lid on tight.
