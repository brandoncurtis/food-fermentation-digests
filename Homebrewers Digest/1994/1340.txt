Subject: Cafe' Pacifica/Sankt Gallen Brewery


This last weekend four representatives of the San Joaquin WORThogs,
locally world-reknown homebrew club, made a pilgrimage to Anchor
Brewing Company for the California Homebrew Club of the Year
banquet and general pissup. (No, it wasn't us, the San Andreas Malts
won, but Anchor invites reps.from other clubs to pay homage) A good
time was had by all.I'm sure they were fishing them out of the sewers 
for days afterwards. 
In true Hog fashion, we hit San Andreas in Hollister (great fun, and
they even let us taste the woodruff ale) on the way up, then Gordon
Birsch on the Embarcadero in the City (pant, pant, drool...Lookit
the system! Check out this beer!.) We then made the mistake of
going to Cafe' Pacifica on Bush in the Financial District. Now, I
had heard from my bro-in-law (Hi, Edson!) that this was owned by a
Japanese gentleman who,upon failing to get microbreweries into
Tokyo due to powerful opposition, set up this wonderful (looking)
micro plant as part of a dim sum restaurant. It seems to have a
different name then the cafe', namely Sankt Gallen, after an 8th century
monastery in Switzerland. The little brochure tells usall about this
in a convincing manner. We each ordered a sampler, about 10 oz. each
of the pale, amber, and dark ales, to the tune of $4.50 . Not a bad deal,
we thought out loud. Until we tried some. The pale was old and overhopped


(I always wondered what that "cardboard" description was all about, now
I know), the amber was husky, astringent (we practiced our tongue-stuck-out
tasting technique here) and infected. The dark was the least offensive, but
had a wei dark-malt nose, like I was sniffing the mash of a big ol'
dark beer, with the edominant flavor of molasses. Irritating. 
Does anybody know the story on this place? It's so pretty, with copper
clad fermenters and lotsa tile and stainless, but the beers were
undrinkable. Que lastima! It's weird when you go to drink in a commercial
place and realize that you could brew better stuff on a bad day. The
best way I can get the experience across is to say that our normally
rather mean group left $18 worth of beer unquaffed on the bar, not
including tip. 


After Anchor (somehow we were still walking) we hit Toronado, a great little
joint with 25+ taps, 50+ different bottles, and 200+ people in an area about
the size of my apartment. Besides good beer, it was heartening to see things
like two very attractive young ladies ordering a 750ml Kriek and drinking it out
of thistle glasses. There is hope for the future of America.

I met an English guy at a pub last night who had just come over
to France from the UK and was talking about a new contraption
now available on the English market which works on the
same principle as soft drink dispensors. On one side of the
machine is an input for carbonated water; on the other side there
is an input for a beer-concentrate syrup cartridge (there is even
a choice between Pale Ale, Bitter, Porter, or Stout). The concentrate
is some sort of mix of alcohol, malt extract, hop extract, and the
famous English E# chemical flavorings. You simply push a button
and, voila, out comes instant beer!!

WHY?! 


Storing wine in oak casks is good. Storing beer in oak casks would be bad.
The reason Bordeaux wine producers store wine in oak barrels for a couple
of years is to contribute TANNINS to the wine which make the wine age 
better. In beermaking, we do everything we can to avoid extracting bitter
tannins from the grain husks, so why defeat the purpose by putting the beer
in oak??

I was unaware of Mountain Brewers curtailing their out of state distribution.
What of the rumors that they are searching for a new location with 
intention of doubling their capacity?  This was reported in the local(BTV) 
paper some time ago.  Also rumored for the Green Mt. St. is a new brewpub 
in the Queen City.  


Regarding NE/Mid-Atlantic brew festivals.  In September the brewers of 
Vermont get together to sponsor a fabulous event at the Sugarbush ski 
resort.  I have attended both years and have been very impressed with 
the representation of regional beers.  Some of the big boys try to get in 
on the market but they always look so lonely.  It's a long time to wait 
but well worth it.

Subject: Weizen:Pitch Temp vs. Fermentation Temp??????


Howdy beer nuts,
    I've just got done reading the "German Wheat Beer" volume of the
Classic Beer Styles series and had one question, at least.
    The author mentions all of the classic weizen brewers in Bavaria
use a rule of thumb:  the pitching and fermentation temperatures must
add up to 50 degrees C (I think).  He said a common combination was
to pitch at 59F and ferment at 64F.
    Anyone care to comment on the logic of cooling below fermentation
temperature to pitch and then raising it up some?  I don't get it.
    Also, I'm considering making a weizenbock using 6.6lb Ireks all-wheat
LME + 3.3 lbs Ireks light (barley) LME + some hops + Wyeast's new wheat
strain.  Any additional suggestions on brewing and kegging this welcome.

 Hmm, worked fine on our UNIX system ;-)  But as you found, it doesn't take
 much programming knowledge to adapt it to any Fortran compiler, and for
 that matter, translating to C.

I had a three batch in a row problem with stuck ferments.  I was
only getting down to around 1.020 to 1.030, where I usually end
at around 1.009 to 1.013.  The only thing all three batches had
in common were the use of Laaglander light DME (I usually use
Munton & Fison).  This can hardly be classified as conclusive
evidence, however; it's more of an anecdotal "data point."  In
general, though, always use the lightest extract you can get and
use specialty grains to provide character and color for your
beer.  I personally find DME to be vastly superior to syrup in
terms of ease of use.

No, but I have been investigating pH meters thoroughly.  All the
reasonably priced meters are not temperature corrected.  You need to
calibrate them at the temperature you will be taking the measurement.
I talked to Williams Brewing Supplies and theirs are not temp
corrected.  The picture in Zymurgy looks identical to the picture in
the Williams catalog.  I have the Cole-Parmer Scientific supply
catalog and you don't get temp corrected meters until you get over
$150 or so.  And then, they will only work up to 150F or so.  


One thing to look out for is that you must figure calibration solution
in your pricing.  Without reference calibration, a pH meter may be
useless.  Also, you don't know how long the electrode will last.  This
is usually the weak spot on a cheap meter.  Also, many meters require
that to last, you must store the electrode immersed in buffer solution
to keep is saturated.  This stuff is not cheap either.  


I am not an expert, just a thorough investigator.  It would be nice to
hear from someone in the university scientific community who has daily
use knowledge.

Subject: Keg bottling/Special B/Leftovers


I have created a method for bottling from a keg which is nearly as good as CP
bottling.  It is really quite simple and works very well for small numbers of
bottles.  First, sanitize the bottles and cool them.  Next, bleed off almost
all of the pressure in the keg, down to a pound or two of pressure (of course
the beer has been previously carbonated, etc.).  Now, just dispense your beer
into a bottle, holding the bottle above the keg level.  If the flow is too
slow, lower the bottle and the fill will speed up.  This works well for a few
bottles to bring to a party, etc.  With more than about 6 bottles, the flow
will stop and you will need to add a little pressure again to get going.
This method provides almost no foaming, thus very little lost carbonation.  I
fill the bottles as high as possible.  This means the beer doesn't have to
give up much dissolved CO2 to pressurize the head space, and there is less
chance for oxygen to do much damage.  I haven't kept beer bottled this way
for more than a couple of days, but I doubt there would be any oxidation
symptoms for weeks.

Aaron asks:


>Could the red be from the Special B?


Yes.  My American "brown" ale used Special B and it is a beautiful deep
copper color.  That is the only special malt in the grain bill, so I know it
is the contributor in my case.  I'm sure the sugar had some effect but not as
much as the SB.

Ronald Dwelle asks:


>What do you do with the spent (left-over) grain?


Well, mine goes into the compost heap, but I guess you don't have one.  It
makes a good mulch for flower beds, etc.  In Boulder, I regularly see it used
in the city park flower beds, etc.  The birds love it.

Subject: Imperial Stout yeast?






Greetings!


I am preparing to brew an Imperial Stout with OG of about 1.100 or so.
I have some questions about which yeast I should use.  I am planning to
use a Wyeast American Ale (22 oz.) starter.  Here are my questions:


1)  Does anyone have experience using this yeast for a high gravity 
brew?  I am assuming that a 22oz. starting will be enough to allow
a complete ferment.  Should I increase this amount?


2)  In general, how will I know if the Ale yeast has done its job
completely?  If the gravity settles down to 1.030 or so, how
will I know if I should pitch some champaign yeast to finish it
off?  


3)  If I pitch champaign yeast after the ale yeast, how will that
affect the final product?  Is it possible to get too much attenuation
with an alcohol tolerant yeast?


The yeast.faq has a small amount of info on fermenting high gravity
brews, but I am unsure if I am on the right track, or not.


Please e-mail or post respnses.


PS ===  On a different note, does anyone have a good idea how to take a 
SG reading when my beer is in a glass carboy?  I haven't thought
of a good way to do it yet minimizing contact with beer.

Where I live, our soil is hard clay.  I would mix it into my garden or 
at least into the composter.  Its full of stuff that breaks up the 
clay.  You could also add a couple of spoonfuls to your morning bowl

Last year, I maintained the Beer Festivals FAQ that was posted to

Subject: bleach vs. B-Brite


Up until now, I've been using a bleach solution to do all sanitizing.  I
just got some B-Brite to try, because I was getting tired of the fumes.
My question is if B-Brite has the same sanitizing (antimicrobial) capability
as chlorine bleach.  Can I use it for the same things and in the same manner
as with bleach?


Thanks in advance,
Brian Shewchuk

I've brewed with Laaglander on several occasions.  The most important
thing to note is that Laaglander contains more unfermentable sugars
than most other extracts.  For example, I typically get approximately
78% apparent attenuation with many syrups & M&F DME.  However, I have
consistently gotten 55% AA with Laaglander DME.  If you like to design
a beer with a specific OG & FG in mind, then this information is very
helpful.  Note, that corn sugar has an AA of 100%.  With this information
I have been able to create beers that have the identical OG & FG from a
combination of corn sugar and Laaglander that I have gotten from 100%
Laaglander DME.  If you brew to target a desired OG & FG, then you can
reach your objectives more economically with Laaglander & corn sugar than
you can with 100% M&F DME.

     I am new to the internet, so let me introduce myself. I am Steve 
     Dragon and live in Worcester, MA. I have been brewing for about four 
     years (you know how you can lose track) and all-grain for over two of 
     them.
     
     My question concerns the use of ONE STEP by ID Carlson. I have been 
     using BEE BRIGHT to sanitize my plastic and SS, and bleach for the 
     glass carboys. BEE BRIGHT requires rinsing, but ONE STEP does not! I 
     have never had any infections using BEE BRIGHT and rinsing, but you 
     never can tell when an infection will come in through the city water 
     supply. Has anyone out there used ONE STEP?

Subject: The Sierra HBD Archives (how to).


There have been several postings lately about how to get files from
the Homebrew Archives on Sierra so I thought I'd re-post some instructions.


If you can use ftp (the preferred method) you should connect to
Sierra.Stanford.EDU (internet address 36.2.0.98) and log in as either
"anonymous" or "ftp" using your e-mail address as the password.
If the login fails it is probably because you mistyped anonymous or
didn't use an email address with a "`at`" in it as the password.


Once you do get logged in you should first set the transfer type to
"binary" since text file will transfer just fine in binary mode but
non-text files will not.  This is usually done with the "type binary"
command though sometimes just "binary" will do.


After this you can use the "dir" or "ls" commands to see what files
and directories (folders) are available.  The "cd xxx" command moves you
to the specified (xxx) directory and "cd .." moves you up out of the
current directory.


The "get xxx" command will get the specified (xxx) file.  If the file
is compressed (i.e. has a .Z suffixed to its name) then you will need
a version of the compress program to uncompress it (you can find it in
 the /pub/sources directory).  Alternatively, if you "get" the file
without the .Z suffix the ftp server will uncompress it for you before
sending it.


For those of you without ftp access there is the listserver.  The
listserver allows you get files from the archives via e-mail.  Since
most archive files are rather large you will probably get them in
multiple messages of about 65 KByte each.


Each mail message has two main parts, the header and the body.  The
header is defined as all lines from the beginning to the first blank
line.  The body starts at the first non-blank line after the header
and goes to the end.   The listserver only looks at the body for its
commands (i.e. the subject is ignored).  Don't worry about case as
everything is mapped to lower case.


Here are the three commands that you will need:


help                  - get a help message about how to use the listserver.
index homebrew          - get the list of files available from the homebrew archive.
get homebrew xxx  - get file xxx from the homebrew archive.


Some brain-damaged mail programs insert one or more lines between the
message header and the user's text.  Since the listserver spits out an
error message and gives up as soon as it sees something that is does not
recognize this is guaranteed not to work (sorry about that Chief).


My appologies for the length of this post but I hope that is will cut
down on "how do I get" messages, for a while at least.


Here's some info from the January ftp summary.


Transfer Totals include the '/pub/homebrew' section only.
TOTALS FOR SUMMARY PERIOD Sat Jan  1 1994 TO Mon Jan 31 1994
Files Transmitted During Summary Period           39,930

Usage is doubling every 3 or 4 months.

Subject: Cask Conditioning:  1st Report


Well, we did it. Cracked the cask. Drank of it's will.


Sat Night was the "tapping party" of the oak cask my tenant/neighbor's dad
found in a barn.  It holds 5 gal.s, and was originally from Hofbrau, 
judging by that fact it says so -carved on the back. 


It was a fun experience overall.  It was a learning experience, not yet
perfected.  The beer was intented to by an IPA, but due to an unwanted 
infection (ugh! bitter dregs.) the plan changed to a Vienna. It was 
primed with a full 3/4 cup sugar after the secondary, and casked.
Conditioning was only 1 week at about 55 deg F. Not long enough.
I think it actually would be better to prime with 1/2 cup, and condition
for 3 weeks at the same temp.  


The beer was fine.  Light, somewhat hazy. Not very heady- even with a 
"splashy" pour.  It was said to definitely have an "oaky" flavor. 
It almost seemed sour-ish to me, but other brewfriends didn't think so.
I think it needed a hoppier, and perhaps stronger beer, with more 
carbonation.  This one started almost flat, and went fully flat.  BUT
everyone drank it anyway. THe cask was empty in an hour or two. (time????)
Good thing there were stouts and bitters on tap.  Now I have 4 kegs and a
cask to re-fill.  Fun party.


It will be fun to really learn the nuances of cask-conditioning.
It just looks neat sitting there in the fermentorium (aka brewroom) in
the basement of the Coyote Brewery  (nyuck).    I got a tap for it, and
wooden bung from  Cellar Homebrew(shameless plug from a happy customer-discl.)
   It worked fine, but the bung isn't intented for beer- but wine. 
   Anyone know of a source for BEER cask items?


It was a true kick to tap the cask.  It was corked in the "top" end hole,
and the goal is to bang the wooden tap handle into the hole, knocking
the cork into the cask, and then occasionally releasing the bung on the
side-side to allow the beer to flow.  If you've ever seen the BeerHunter
episode in Munich (wasn't it?!) where the mayor taps the BIG cask at a feast
fest.  Gets spewed with beer and loves it!  Well, maybe next time with a bit
better conditioning!  :)  


Definitely will try this one twice!!!


But alas - I must wait.  My (extract) brewer / cask owner is gonna do
the next one.  Good excuse for a party IMHO.  :)  


PS:  Do try this at home!

"John L. Isenhour" <isenhour`at`lambic.fnal.gov> countered my statements on:
Subject: yeast culturing.  Liquid vs. Solid.  The debate...:)
 
JW>>*   I would question relying solely on liquid cultures. One major 
advantage 
 >of the use of plates is that you can SEE single colonies.  Even with slants
 >you are able to get an idea if there is significant/obvious contamination.
 
 JI>I didnt say to use liquid only, I just prefer it.  I really doubt that with
 typical streaking done in the home that you would steak down to the point 
where you could be certain that there was only one cell per growth node.
 
 **   Not certain.  True.  But I did say OBVIOUS contamination, didn't I?
 Like black fuzzies all over the plate, red colonies...etc. (foul smell).
 
 >Especially in the summer, even in a hood, you will occasionally get airborn
  ... snip ...  my article on sterile transfer techniques in the Zymurgy yeast 
 issue, you can avoid potential contamination problems by using liquid.
 
 **  Everyone has their own preferences.  Granted.  Personally I don't like
 needles. We have a GC at work, and I like to stay away from that area.
 Needles everywhere.  Personally I prefer the color display of my propane
 torch blasting away in close proximity to my furry head, and face. :)
 (hope I never knock it over. Knock on my head!).  Again. Preference.
 
 ** The other thing that bothered me about your technique is that it is such a
 sealed system you have no interaction with the yeast. You can't SEE it, or
 SMELL it.  I agree, you have a nicely sealed system. I have suffered 
 airborne problems.  But I like to be intimate with my yeast. Call me kinky.
         *NOTE: JI Tastes his cultures worts. So he does get into it.


 **      Personally I think flaming of test tubes does a pretty good job of
 keeping nasties out.  I close my bedroom door, spray the air around me
 desk w/ lysol and lock the dogs out.  As long as there is a positive airflow
 there isn't much chance for nasties to get in.  I wouldn't mind making a 
 hood like the one you pictured in fig. 2.  But I haven't had too much 
 problem with airbornes.  Moisture accumulation in plates is more 
 troublesome, so I've moved more to slants.  I use the lid of the plate as
 as shield, for partial protection.
 
 >>Additionally, it is my belief that slants/plates can last longer as a 
 >stable culture than a liquid culture.
 
 >Plates that undergo temperature changes are going to respire and possibly 
  suck ... snip ... "talk of methods, etc."
 
 **  Now John.  This started with us both agreeing plates should be
 wrapped.  Parafilm works great, Plastic tape'll do the trick too.
 (if I didn't agree, I meant to!). So respiration isn't an issue.
 I wrap the caps of my screw-cap culture tubes w/ parafilm, too.
 
 ** For initial yeast growth yeast need some air.  I would content that a
 slant tube of yeast will consume air present as well as a liquid tube.
 I don't open-reclose slants. When I transfer from a slant- it generally 
 means I'm on to a starter or new slant. The old one gets pitched.
 So I don't have air - introduction.  But for multiplication/propogation
 you need some at first. Do you aerate your mason jar starters after 
 autoclaving? Just with the air in the headspace I presume?
 
 >>Due mainly to the fact that the  medium is solid, therefore nutrients will 
 >>diffuse to the culture in a slower fashion
 > I am not aware of nutrients diffusing thru chilled agar at any appreciable 
 rate (I would welcome any citations), most organisms try to grow across 
 agar  to get to nutrients.  The so called unfermentables can be utilized, at 
 much  slower rate.  
 
 ** There are numerous reports/studies of diffusion of various substances
 through agar media.  It is a gel, not a true solid. If you "really" want
 references I'll get you some, but I don't think it's worth the bother.
 Substances of all types DO diffuse through agar.  Ask your micro friends.
 e.g., Antibiotic sensitivity tests depend on diffusion through agar plates.
 
 >> When liquid yeast media is added to fresh sterile liquid starter and the
 temperature is reduced, I've found that they do not tend to exhaust the 
 media before I utilize the sample.
 
 **  Ok.  If it works for you-  great. I say DO IT.
 My personal preference in approach  is to keep liquid cultures for 
 no more than a month. Whereas slants/plates are stored for preferable
 no more than 3 months. But 6 month old plates have been re-cultured
 with no noticable detriments.  For longer than that I'd promote freezing.
 
 More coming in second half. The debate rages on.

 **  John...I never said to freeze plates. That would be silly!
 Please don't mince my words. I do that well enough w/o help.
 
 ** My main backing comes from experience in micro labs of various sorts.
 Cultures were grown up/studied in liquid cultures, but storage was on
 solid media for general use, and for secure long-term...frozen at -70.
 Some of this work was with MARINE bacteria. Their natural environment
 is LIQUID, but once enriched in the lab they were STORED on SOLID media.
 Liquids were mostly used for growing large volumes for harvest.
 In one lab, where we worked with yeast, we also did not use liquid
 cultures for storage.  Animal cells are grown and stored in liquid,
 but that's not microbiology.

 ** I strongly agree.  It is to our benefit to keep them in business!
 Buy American yeast (just kidding!). Spreading our personal $ is our right.
 ** Great.  Sounds like you have a system that works for you. 
 Mine is different, not necessarily better, not necessarily worse.
 I just like more interaction/observation of my yeast.  Preference.
  
 >A small explanation might help:
 ...(with liberal use of peroxide) ...
 
 **  You don't mention the peroxide in your article. This won't work
 on all bacteria, and won't be effective against wild yeast or mold.
 Rubbing alcohol, or flame is probably better. YMMV.
 
 **  Also: You mention a jar of water/fish tank heater for an incubator.
 Might I suggest: A low wattage light bulb, and regulator (fridge type can
 work) in an insulated box.  These are commonly used for home- yogurt
 culturing.  I think you'll get better air-temp-transfer than the water 
 method you mention.

Yes.  They make a tasty brew, but be warned that Laaglander Dried Malt Extracts
are not very fermentable, meaning that they will leave a high final gravity
and a sweet brew.  A recent poster said his beer got stuck at 1030 (sorry,
lost the poster's name).  If he used Laaglander, then a 1060 beer really might
finish at 1030.  It's really that unfermentable.  I use it 1 to 2 pounds in
an otherwise regular batch to add sweetness and body, like in Young's Special
London Ale or McEwan's Scotch Ale.  For a really intense sweetness like in
Mackeson's XXX Stout, you need to use Lactose and lots of it.


Laaglander comes hopped and unhopped.  Check the label.


Al.
