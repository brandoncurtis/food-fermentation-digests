That's what Wyeast Labs says and I've confirmed it in my beers.  Wyeast
London Ale and Wyeast American Ale are my two favorites, but now with the
new Special London Ale yeast and the Belgian White yeast, I may have to
brew twice as often!  BTW, I recently made a pretty respectable Ordinary
Bitter with Wyeast Irish (for the extra diacetyl) and am serving it as
close to cask-conditioned as I can.  I give the keg just enough CO2 to
dispense the beer when I hold the faucet near the bottom of the keg and
barely open the faucet to create turbulence (like a "sparkler").  Between
servings, there's no CO2 pressure on the beer.  I've still got some
fine-tuning to do on the recipe, but I've proven to myself that I can
make a flavorful, drinkable beer with an OG of 1036.

Unless you cool before pouring through the kitchen strainer, you will have
some Hot-Side Aeration.  I simply use a hop bag for each hop addition and
then remove the hops, bag and all, from the kettle after the boil.  I add
10% to Rager's numbers to compensate for the lower utilization I get from
the bag.

Well, that might indeed happen, but it certainly is not *why* you boil.
The most important reasons for boiling are sanitation and protein coagulation.
If one could find a way to retain the hop aromatics during the boil (while
still losing the DMS and other unwanteds), I think they would be held in
very high esteem by this digest's members.

I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  What I do is pour the
yeast starter into the carboy and then pour cooled wort into it through
a large funnel.  This action produces a lot of foam and aeration.

Is is a powder?  Then it's probably just malt extract.
Does it look like grain?  Then it's probably crystal malt and you should
crush it and steep it in a gallon or so of 170F water for 15-30 minutes,
then leave the husks behind and use the liquid to brew an extract batch.
You can use 1/2 to 2 lbs in a 5 gallon batch.  If the grain is very
dark, then you might want to use less.  Crystal malt adds sweetness, body,
head retention and a caramelly flavor to your beer.

> One other question : What are finings - and

Finings are used to clarify your beer.  When you use them depends on the
type of finings.  Kettle finings, like Irish Moss are added in the last
15 min of the boil.  They help proteins coagulate out during the boil.
The amount to use has varied from 1/4 tsp to much larger amounts over
the years.  I'm waiting for George Fix's book for the final word.
Gelatin is another kind of fining, but it is added to the fermenter and
not the kettle.  Polyclar AT is another and is used to remove tannins
from your beer in the fermenter (I believe it also helps to speed the
settling of the yeast too).  There's a good article on finings in one
of the Beer and Brewing from a few years ago by Terry Foster -- it
explains not only how to use them, but how they work.  Pretty cool stuff.

Yes.  There is no doubt that Czech Pilsner is dryhopped and it is
traditionally only dryhopped with Czech Saaz.  I recomend whole or

Usually dryhopped:
Czech Pilsner, English Pale Ale, Barleywine, American Brown Ale, American
Pale Ale, India Pale Ale.


Sometimes dryhopped:
Bitter, Scottish Ale, Stouts, Strong English and Scotch Ales, 
several Belgian Ales (like Orval), Porter.


Usually not dryhopped:
Wheat beers, Mild, English Brown Ale, American Lagers (except some
recent entries by over-litigative marketing-types), most German Lagers
(although I've tasted some commercial Dorts that had a hop nose).


I'm not sure:
Alt & Koelsch (I defer comment to Roger).


My advise: don't get too hung up on styles.  Try dryhopping.  If you like
it, dryhop.  If you want to make a dryhopped Mild, then don't let anyone
stop you.

Does this strike anyone else as quite sexist and self defeating.  What
is it in brewing that makes men better or worse at it?  In this era of
eliminating the differences between the sexes this seems to be several
steps backwards.  In fact there would be quite an outcry if there we a
male only competition.  Or can you even imagine a "white" only
competition!?!  Only when all of this needless segregation is
eliminated can we truly eliminate sexism; or at least this is my
belief at the moment.  We should strive to get women brewing with
everyone.  There seems to be no need for a seperate competition.  In
fact winning such a competition seems to be a hollow victory.  What
good is it to win "Brewer of the year" when you are competing against
< half of the competition.  I can seen the merits of trying to get
more women active; and perhaps this is a way to support female
brewers, but there must be a better way.  Perhaps I am missing
something here.  Let me know, I am always open to enlightenment.

Well, you got my curiosity up, so I got a data sheet on it.  It's pretty 
sketchy, unlike some of the others I've seen out of GW malting.  There is 
no measure of diastatic power listed, which I take to imply that it has none.
This means it's not a "porter malt". I've seen it in stores listed as either
british chocolate or scottish chocolate.  All GW really has to say is the 
descriptor "Brown(Amber) Normally, kilned dry malt is roasted at temprature 
of about 140 degrees C.  The result is a dry, almost bitter-like flavor. Color
55-70 ASBC" And the data sheet just lists 
Moisture% 4.0
Color, laboratory Wort, ASBC 70


No extract #s, no diastatic power #s.


I've been using it for a while as a replacement for domestic chocolate.  With
the color of GW's regular chocolate at 500ASBC and brown at 70ASBC, I now know
why the color is not as deep as expected.  The Imperial Stout I made last
weekend (seems an appropriate post-earthquake brew) is much closer to dark brown
that black.  It was listed as 400l when I ordered it.

Recent entries have mentioned pitching rates for lagers.  What's
"a lot?"  I normally pitch 0.5-1 lit of active culture for ales and this
is fine.  Do I need more for lagers?  Does it help to prepare pitching
cultures aerobically instead of anaerobically?


Also, regarding yeast storage, I also swear by plates, but only because
I'm religously trained to begin all cultures from single colonies.  Maybe
there's a chance of picking a wild yeast, but it should be a small chance
if your sterile technique is any good.


For longer term storage (6 mo or more) I've been using stab cultures
because I can seal the caps after the yeast grows a day (keeping
O2 out), the agar can't dry out like plates, and I always thought that
cultures were more stable under anaeroblic conditions.  Is this true
for yeast?


Finally, I toss the spent grain in my compost pile.  What better use 
than to feed the hops vines?

Subject: Mashing unmalted grains


I am gathering information in preparation to brewing a Belgian Wit style
beer.  The grist will be approximately 45% raw, unmalted wheat.  My question
is how to go about mashing this stuff.  Although regular infusion mashing
would work to some extent, (wheat gelatinizes between 125 and 147 degrees)
this method seems to produce uniformly low OGs due to the very low diastatic
power of the grist.  In Pierre Rajotte's 
"Belgian Ale" book, he says that white beers were traditionally infusion
mashed.  However, the infusion procedure he describes is very complex and
requires (among other things)  many infusions over a long period of time, 2
boilers, a holding tank, and some strange device called a stuykmanden. 
Needless to say, this method is not useful for homebrewing - in fact I don't
think even Hoegarden uses this method anymore.  I have also heard of adding
extra enzymes to an infusion mash, but would like to avoid this also. 
Anyway, I was considering treating the grist as though it were simply VERY
poorly modified malt (which is pretty close to the truth, when you consider
the grist holistically) and using a triple decoction mash.
Is there any reason why I shouldn't do this?  Will it make the mash more or
less viscose than an infusion mash?  Will it darken the wort too much? 
Presupposing a decoction mash, will it matter if I use flaked/torrefied wheat
or "plain" unmalted?
I would be very interested in hearing about methods and experiences with
mashing considerable portions of unmalted grains.

        I used to fix thermometers at the chemistry stock room of my college. I used
a beaker of sand placed on a hot plate as a hot bath for the bulb of the
thermometer. Its easier to apply the heat in a steady fashion. Using the
flame, I usually ended up bursting the thermometer by getting it too hot.
With the sand, it was much easier to get the column to rise at a steady pace.

Subject: Yeast starters


I have tried to scavenge and start some yeast from a batch I made a few
weeks back. I followed Papazian's procedure, though with only a couple of
bottles.


I did think the media was a bit thin, and I am wondering is that's why I'm
not seeing very much activity. The two bottles are sitting on my kitchen
counter at about 65=B0F with airlocks, and I have seen infrequent bubbles
from one and even less from the other.


Should I retry and thicken my soup? Any recipes for starter media anyone
can share?


I would really like to be able to cultivate some of these if I can, on the
off chance I get something unusual bottle-conditioned product I can work
toward emulating.


Thanks for your help.

From: Collin A Ames <C-AMES`at`vm1.spcs.umn.edu>
Subject: A Novice Gets Involved...


Hey there, as we say up here in the great frozen land of Minnesota!


Well, first off let me say that I have only brewed three batches of beer
in my short career, all of them extract kits.  I think it likely that I shall
stay with this type of brewing, since my brewing philosphy has been to brew
a great tasting beer for less money than it would take to buy a good beer.
Having followed many of the discussions here on all-grain brewing and yeast
culturing, etc...well, let's just say that the 'art' of brewing has not, as
yet, hit me.  Is there a muse of brewing?  I suspect so, though the name
eludes me...


That having been said, I'd like to solicit a bit of advice.  My last beer
was a bock kit (Johann's Bock by America Brews).  The kit came with 4 lbs
of dark extract, 2 lbs of amber extract (dry) and an ounce of hops, to which
I added 1 lb of dark extract (dry).  The resulting brew was a fine, dark
color, very smooth and of strong alcholic punch.  I believe I started with
an OG of 1.064 and finished at 1.018.  Now, I would like to play with it just
a bit more...1)  I would like more of a hoppy flavor to this beer.  If anyone
has brewed bocks before and would like to recommend an appropriate hop, I'd
appreciate it.  Also, what quantities should I use?  One ounce seemed to be
a bit light, as 1/2 ounce went into the boil and the other half was used as
the finishing touch.  2)  I am considering adding another pound of dark extract
(dry) to up the alcoholic content just a bit more.  But, I presume that the
yeast included in the kit (a standard dry yeast) would not be up to the
challenge?  Or, am I incorrect in this?  Suggestions?


I also brewed a red ale recently, which used 1/2 pound of grain (crystal and
chocolate, I believe).  The instructions with the kit said to bring 3 gallons
of water to a boil, turn off heat and steep the grains for 15 minutes.  That
seems like it is a little hot, considering what I've been reading here.  I
think I'd like to use grains in combination with the extracts for flavoring
and such, but is this the correct method or is there a better one?  Yes, you
guessed it...the likelihood of there ever being a tun in my house is very, very
low...right up there with the Vikings winning the Superbowl before I die.


One last question:  is there significant difference between pots for boiling?
I.e., should I avoid aluminum?  Is stainless steel ok?  I'm getting at least
a 20 qt pot, but want to make sure that, in my ignorance, I don't buy a pot
that would make my brewing life miserable!


And, just to verify that, in fact, the wort will boil over when you stop
watching it...it happened to me...boiled fine for 30 minutes while I watched
it with an eagle eye...turned to rince something in the sink, and BOOM!
Boiled over instantly...of course, if you watch the pot, it never boils...


Thanks in anticipation!

Subject: amber & brown malt




Here are suggestions for amber and brown malt.


For amber malt, try DeWolf Cosyns Biscuit malt.  Its color is 
about 22L, which makes it darker than Munich Light or 
Munich Dark, but not so dark as DWC Aromatic.  In flavor, 
Biscuit is very different from the Munich and Aromatic, as 
the name attests.  See Noonan's Scotch Ale book for some 
recipes calling for some amber malt.


For brown malt, I have done something similar to what Ed 
Westemeier suggested.  Maltophile Randy Mosher suggests 
that you can make brown malt in your oven by toasting pale 
malt for 40 to 50 minutes at 400 to 450 degrees.  Yes, the 
time seems long and the temperature hot, but you will get 
brown malt.  When you crack it in your malt mill, it shreds 
easily.  I have used brown malt for 20 - 25% of the grain bill.


Brown malt can be used in an attempt at a "historic" porter.  
Use the following grain mix:


9 parts pale malt
5 parts amber malt (DWC biscuit)
5 parts brown malt (homemade)
1 part black malt


Aim for SG 1.070.  Hop it well, say 50 IBUs.  Use Guinness 
yeast or Wyeast Irish, or whatever yeast you want.

I got one at Worm's Way here in St. Louis for $65, with 
some pH7 buffer for calibration and storage.  It is 
temperature corrected from about 35F to 120F.  All the 
meters I've seen for under $50 are not temperature 
corrected.


On a related topic:  I bought the pH meter partially with 
gift certificates that Worm's Way gave to our club as 
prizes for our competition in December.  I've wanted one 
for a long time for aquarium and gardening, and now for 
beermaking.  It really *is* an extravagance, though. My 
wife characterizes my extravagances as "toys" -- she's not 
far off the mark.  If your funds are limited, and you don't 
have special needs (like measuring especially low or high 
pH) you might use Merk ColorpHast pH indicator strips, in 
the pH 7 - 4 range. Its plenty accurate for beermaking, 
aquarium-keeping, etc.  Other ranges are available. Any 
good homebrew shop should carry them, at least in the low 
range.  If yours doesn't, ask for them.  If the shopkeeper 
is, um, uncooperative, they can be mail-ordered from my 
favorite shop here in St. Louis.  Standard disclaimers 
apply, e-mail me directly for the address if you want it.

Here was the last recipe.  Tasted at racking, it comes pretty close.


7.5 pounds US 2-row
1 pound US cara-pils
1 pound DWC Cara-Vienne
3 ounces DWC Special B


0.5 ounce Perle at 60 minutes before end of boil
1 ounce Cascade at 30 minutes before end of boil
1 ounce Cascade at 10 minutes before end of boil 
1 ounce Cascade at 2 minutes before end of boil


Wyeast American ale


Note the final hop addition at 2 minutes.  At flame off, cover the
beer and steep for 20 minutes before chilling.


For all-grain, aim for starch conversion temp of 153/5 degrees F.  
Grain bill is figured at 78% extract efficiency; adjust accordingly.


For extract brewers, substitute about 5 pounds of light unhopped dry
malt extract for the US 2-row.  Crack and steep the other grains, 
then strain them out, bring to boil, add extract, and proceed.

        If the darker roasted malts (ie chocolate malt, black malt and 
roast barley, as well as the darker crystal malts) have a colour rating in 
degrees lovibond based on a linear dilution, does anyone know what the 
standard is?  Are these malts diluted to 10^L?  5^L?  15^L?  Each to a 
different reference?  Are they all diluted to 2% and the colour rating 
based on that?  Who decides that Black malt is 500^L and chocolate malt is 
350^L?  This is important stuff.  Just think, if Guinness has a colour of 
35^L, does a rating of 350^L mean anything at all?

Subject: Stretching Yeast


I have been trying to get some extra use out of my liquid yeasts and have
come up with a few questions that I hope someone out in homebrew land may 
have the answers to.


My HB shop owner suggested making up four 16 oz bottles of approx. .020
starter and then spliting up the contents of a Wyeast pack and pouring it 
into the 4 bottles.  He then suggested capping them and placing them in the
fridge for future use.  Has anyone tried anything like this?  I am assuming
this can only be used with Ale yeast as the Lager would probably ferment and 
then make one major mess in the fridge.


I have also tried washing yeast in the manner described in the yeast faq. This
worked fine when I immediately repitched into a new primary but I haven't
tried storing for future use.  My thought is that without food the yeast won't
live for too long.  Any suggestions/ideas?  I would like to talk with someone
that uses the wash method and compare notes....


Lastly, I believe I have read or heard of an idea where a larger batch of 
week starter is made, pitched and fermented, then split into several smaller
batches to be stored for future use.  Anyone tried this?  


Any and all help would be appreciated.  If I get enough good, strange or 
otherwise answers I would be happy to post to the list for the benefit of all.


TIA

Well!  You guys have a lot of nerve bringing this up *after* I used the

tongue in cheek!)  Just another data point - 6 lbs of the Laaglander DME, with
an OG of 1.055.  After racking to the secondary, the SG was 1.030.  I just
assumed it was stuck and have been waiting *oh so patiently* for the

A member of our brewing club here in Seattle has just started a bakery
with his son named "The Spent Grain Bakery".  Located in the Fremont
district they produce great peasant style (heavily crusted) breads in
which they use the spent grain from numerous local microbreweries
(Redhook, Hales, Big Time, Maritime, ...).  Of course the spent grain is
not the primary grain but simply an adjunct to the recipes.  The
microbreweries are suppling the bakery with bottle labels for them to
package with the bread so you know what brewery's grain went into the
bread you are consuming.  Pretty cool, huh?

Regarding the recent thread on "London," "British," whether the names are 
geographically accurate, and which is good for what style:  my $0.02 is to 
say that while I have very limited experience with "London," I have 
thoroughly enjoyed the results of 1098 in Pale Ales, Porters, and Brown Ale.  
It imparts a tart note which I have grown very fond of, and usually performs 
well.  Two disclaimers: a bitter I made didn't turn out very well, but I 
DON'T think it was the fault of the 1098; and I posted questions a couple 
months ago about high terminal gravities, which I originally thought might be 
yeast-related, but I no longer believe this.  I recommend the "British" very 
highly.

  How  do you think India Pale Ale got its traditional
"oaky" taste?  It was from the oak barrels in which the beer was
stored for shipment to India.  Even today, Yorkshire brewers such
as Sam Smith's and Theakston (makers of Old Peculier) use oak
casks. They even have their own in-house coopers to make them.
There may be other Yorkshire brewers who do this as well.

Subject: Special Hops


Many folks have posted that they have never used special hops in beer,
but that didn't stop them from presenting misinformation.  I figure it
is time for someone who knows what the hell they are talking about to
speak up before the BS gets any deeper. 


My credentials: ask Michael Jackson about my Brain Death Barleywine. 
Nuff said. 


The facts:


Special hops contribute a nice flavor to beer, quite complimentary to
the regular hops.  The flavor is directly related to the quality of the
special hops.


You can get quite stoned off the beer, in fact it is a nice way to get a
buzz if you don't want to smoke. 


The procedure:


The secret to excellent special beer is correct processing of the
special hops. 


Break up the goodies and put them in a grain bag or cheesecloth and put
that in a colander or strainer.  Rinse with lukewarm water and allow to
soak for an hour or so.  Repeat several times until the runoff is not so
green.  You are removing the water soluble stuff that doesn't taste very
good and has no useful effect.  If the water is too hot, you will remove
the good stuff, so be careful. 


Add the (now soggy) special hops as a very late dry hopping in the
secondary to a very strong beer (barleywine is best IMHO).  You are
relying on the alcohol to extract and isomerize the goodies, so give it
about a week before straining them out and bottling/kegging.  Since the
special hops compliment the flavor of the regular hops, you want to
reduce your regular hops slightly, but don't eliminate them. 


The quality of the resulting beverage is dependent upon the quality of
the base beer and the special hops.  If you know a grower, you can use
the waste that was trimmed, but it won't taste nearly as good as using
prime buds.  Yes, it can be expensive if you purchase the goods at
retail prices.  Your best bet is to befriend a grower and work out a
barter arrangement. 


FYI: Brain Death Barleywine was a 5-gallon batch of 1100 OG barleywine
with 5 oz of prime tops.  One bottle was all you needed.  Suck one of
those babies down before a concert and you were set for the night.  They
lasted for 5 years and continued to improve.  The bottles (yes, he asked
for seconds) that MJ tried were about a year old.  No, I don't have any
more. 


As a BJCP Master Beer Judge with extensive experience with special hops,
I am available to help you evaluate and improve your efforts. 


Don't forget: your government will send armed thugs to assault and
kidnap you and steal your property if they find out that you are in
possession of unapproved herbs.  Vote Libertarian if you want to to be
able to decide what herbs you should consume.

small brewers from the Vt., Mass., N.H., Maine area.  Among those in 
attendance were Geary's, Harpoon, Mountain Brewers, Catamount, Otter 
Creek Brewing, St. Ambroise (Canadian! Great Oatmeal Stout).  Pete's Brewing 
Co. was there, as was ol' Pete himself.  Not surprisingly, the Boston Brewing
Co.'s stand was not all that crowded.  Among the local breweries were
McNeil's Brewpub of Brattleboro, Vt. (with the most -12!- beer styles), 
The Vermont Pub & Brewery (makes a great Dog Bite Bitter), and Vermont's 
newest brewpub Jasper Murdock's Ale House (unfortunately, their location 
escapes me).

Subject: Lagering question


Last month I made my first attempt at lagering, but have a concern.
I used the Jeepers Creepers Light Lager recipe from Papazian's book and made
a starter with the Wyeast Dutch lager yeast. After a solid primary
fermentation at 48 degrees, I racked to secondary and brought the temp down
slowly to 39 degrees. Since I racked to the secondary, however, there has
been no airlock activity. When I racked to secondary, the gravety was 1.006
(at the high end of the final gravety range for the recipe.)
The questions: 
1.
xx Should there be airlock activity during secondary for this or any lagered
beer?
2. Don't you remove most of the yeast when you rack to secondary if you are
using a bottom-fermenting yeast?


Also, could someone suggest a good book with information on lagering. I
enjoyed papazians book, but he says little if anything about lagering.


Thanks in advance

Hello to the World's Homebrewers,
     My name is Ted, and I have become a homebrewer; I am also a science geek
who works on microtubules. These are cellular structures too difficult to
explain here (if interested, read anything by Tim Mitchison or take a
class at the local polytech). I am posting this to say hello and tell you
all that I look forward to my life as a homebrewer (life as a dog?).


     Why pitch at a lower temperature when brewing Hefe Weissen? Maybe the
German brewmiesters liked a nice syncronous(sp) culture of yeast. Cold
will do this by depolymerizing microtubules in the yeast's mitotic spindle
and blocking the cell cycle (read work by Tim Hunt) in the G2-M phase
transition. When the yeast warms up, the microtubules can repolymerize and
the cells can progress on their way to making you Bavaria's truth serum
(when I drink Weiss I always want to tell stories about when I was 10
years old, ah joy). Understanding the cell cycle will aid you in
understanding not only your yeast, but yourself.

Subject: Re: Homebrew DigeGott Coolers/Better Beer


Rick inquired about Gott coolers and I thought it appropriate
to comment about switching to grain brewing:


My first mash tun was based on a 5 gal Igloo cooler, a drilled,
trimmed mixing bowl(false bottom) and it became *extremely* 
distorted after about 40 mashes.  I have since graduated to 
a 5 gal Gott - same false bottom design - and there is no
sign of deformation after about 50 mashes.  Unless Igloo has
changed the plastic formulation in their cooler, I reccommend
the Gott.  I attached a plastic bottling spigot in place of the
factory valve(I used a rubber washer on inside and out).


About better beer:


I feel the most important factor in making quality homebrew
is getting the yeast right.  I made the transition to liquid
yeast and grain brewing at the same time and the difference
knocked my socks off.  I have since made some very good beers
from *light* dry or liquid (Edme DMS is very good) extracts
and high quality specialty grains, quality hops and liquid
yeast.  These beers are indistinguishable from well made
all-grain beers.


I feel what is gained by grain brewing is the ultimate 
flexibility in recipe design, and control of practically every 
aspect in brewing - short of malting your own grain.  If I
had the choice over again, I'd make the same move to grain 
brewing: the time commitment is substantial, but IMHO the 
rewards are worthwhile.


There are viable dry yeasts on the market, but IMHO, liquid
yeasts are far superior and the recent number of strains
available allows you even greater control of your beer.

Norm Pyle suggests a method of bottling from kegs - for a few at a time.  I 
have used the same method, using a Phil's filler (standard disclaimer)  on 
the end of my cobra tap, and it works well for low-carbonation beers, but I 
have never been able to get it to work with alts and hefe-weizens (~3 
volumes CO2).  They still foam like the dickens.  The one thing I haven't 
done to try them is to chill the keg to just above freezing, which might 
help, but defeats the purpose of a quick and simple bottling method.  If 
anyone has success with high carbonation beers at 45 deg F, I'm all ears!
Alexander Ramos asks how to check the gravity in the carboy.  For two years, 
I've been filling the crack around the stopper with 100 proof vodka, letting 
that sit for a few minutes, then simply removing the stopper and tilting the 
carboy to fill a graduate cylinder and replacing the stopper/airlock.  Have 
n ever had an infection yet, and I know that my brewcave is far from squeaky 
clean.  I recently bought a glass wine thief to take samples with, but its 
far more work to sanitize it and grab a sample than to simply disinfect the 
stopper and pour.  Guess this is a perfect example of appropriate
