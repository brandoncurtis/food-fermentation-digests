Subject: Canada Malt Statistics




My posting yesterday described CM 2 row attributes and with a little
help from Spencer Thomas and a CM Chemist, heres what the stats mean.


Ext F or C, As is and Dry, this is extract or yield based on Fine or
Coarse crush and is expressed in percentage, with malt out of the bag
versus dried.


F/C is the percentage differential between crushes. It appears that
there is only a slightly higher yeild for fine crushes (1.4%)


Color is expressed in Degrees Lovibond.


DP is Diastatic power, both Alpha and Beta Amalyse, the grains
ability to convert starches to sugars.


AA is percentage Alpha Amalyse.


Malt and Wort Prot is is the level of protein in the malt and
subsequent wort.


FAN is Free Amino Nitrogen, expressed in parts per million or MG/L.
This is good for yeast growth and activity.


Assortment is the percentage of grains sized 5/64ths inch to 7/64ths.


Thrus is the percentage of grains that fell through the 5/64 sizing
screen.


I'm waiting for the remainder of the data sheets from Canada Malt to
arrive from Thunder Bay, I'll post them when they arrive.

Subject: Rolling Rock clone/Adding sweetness to meads


I've been asked to try to duplicate Rolling Rock in a batch of
homebrew.  Does anyone have an extract or extract/grain recipe?  I
think probably something like 4 lbs pale malt and maybe some rice
are in there, but I can't get a bearing on the hops at all.  They
seem very muted, almost to the point of not being there.


On another topic, we made some Jamaican Blue mead, based on the recipe
posted here a while back.  OG turned out to be 1.069 or so, and after
a couple weeks had dropped to 1.000.  Naturally, not wanting to waste
a drop, we "sampled the sample" and found it to be extremely bitter
(i.e., _all_ the sugar fermented out).  Mixing a teaspoon of honey
with the mead made it taste, well, heavenly!  I realize this mead has
some serious aging to do, but I'm not sure the sweetness will come
back.  So my question is: how can you add sweetness to something,
without having that sugar kick off another round of fermentation (or
is that what's really needed here)?


Thanks in advance.

Subject: Stuck stout


In HBD 1338 Jay Lonner wrote that his OG 1.052 stout using Wyeast #1084
Irish is stuck at 1.032.  How coincidental that I currently have a
"Kitchen Sink Stout" using the same yeast OG 1.065 seems to be stuck at
1.025 after two weeks.  I also brewed a pale ale (OG 1.050) the same
weekend using the new Wyeast Special London Ale and have been fermenting
both under the same conditions (approx 68 F).  The pale at racking had
dropped to 1.014.  If anything the stout was better aerated and had a
bigger starter than the pale.  Seems curious given the recent raves about
#1084 being such a vigorous fermenter.  I was expecting a slightly high FG
given all the junk I added but 1.025 seems a bit too high to me.  Jay, did
you get any helpful advice?


FWIW, I was aiming at an imperial stout on the low end of the scale with an
OG of 1.072, however it was my first batch with my new mill (previously
used the champion mill documented in the Zymurgy gadget issue).  My usual
yield dropped from about 29 or 30 pts/lb/gal to about 22.  I crushed a bit
finer the next day for the pale ale and got a better yield.


Grain bill for the stout:
14 lbs english pale 
 .5 lb wheat
1.5 lbs munich
6 oz flaked barley
3 lbs various lovs crystal
1 lb choc
6 oz black
14 oz roast barley


2 hour mash `at` 154 F
90 minute boil


Anyone have any clues or advice?  Do I need to give it more time?  There's
not much activity through the airlock.

It so happens I was reading Terry Foster's PALE ALE (Boulder: 
Brewers Publications, 1990) last night and read the following:


     "In fact, 'oakiness' is not a characteristic of English IPA,
     although the beer was and sometimes still is aged in wood. 
     You see, English oak is very different from its American
     cousin, and imparts little or no flavor to beer stored in
     casks made from it.  Indeed, I remember a conversation with
     one of Britain's few remaining brewers' coopers, in which he
     said they would never use American oak, 'because it would
     spoil the beer's flavor!'"  (pp. 31-32)


So apparently oak flavor is not "officially" part of the IPA flavor
profile.  Do any of the English brews mentioned above taste "oaky"? -- 
I haven't tried them.  Talk of IPA, however, does lead me to a question that 
probably belongs in Internet's alt.beer newsgroup, but I'll ask anyway, and
knowledgeable sorts can answer me via e-mail.  In the paragraph
previous to the one I quoted, Foster mentions Ballatine India Pale
Ale.  I had this once, several years ago, and I bought it through
Trader Joe's in LA, cheap!  I wasn't quite the beer snob/freak/geek then that
I am now, but I was amazed at the interesting & complex taste of this
cheap beer.  I never saw it again, so I figured TJ's had just bought
out the last batch, or something.  Does anyone in HBD land know
about the fate or availability of Ballantine India Pale Ale?

Howdy!


   I am considering starting a Zmurgy BBS down here in San Diego, CA.  I
   was wondering, however, if the number of homebrewers down here warrants
   a dedicated BBS.  I'd like to ask folks the following:


   1) If there was a homebrewing BBS in your town, would you support it?
      (post messages, participate in get-togethers, etc)


   2) What would you like to see on a BBS?
      (Recipes, pictures of labels, Homebrew Digests, Scanned pictures of
      the brewing process, etc)


   3) Would you consider calling local long distance, intrastate,
      or interstate?


   Thanks!  Thought this would be the best forum in which to get a feel
   for how popular this idea would be.

In HBD 1341 Al writes in answer to Carl:
>unless you cool before pouring through the kitchen strainer, you will have
>some Hot-Side Aeration...


After 8 batches, all of which have been slowly poured through a funnel with 
strianer (to remove hops, grain particles, etc) into 3 gals of cold water I 
have never experienced any HSA (at least that I know of).  I use a sanitized 
saute pot for a laddle and at most the 2+ gals of boiled wort has not been 
cooled any more than for a 15 minute steep (I would hate to drop the boil 
pot on the way to cooling it and do not yet have an emersion cooler).  I then
sparge the spent Hops, etc. with between 1/2 and 1 gal of boiling water; still
no HSA.


This is certainly not a flame (I don't know enough yet to flame) just some 
major confussion (on my part) but how does one get HSA when the pot is no 
longer on the flame or burner?  I was led to understand that HSA would most
likely occur through overly strong stirring during the boil.  What exactly 
does HSA do to the taste of the beer?  Mine all seem great (IMHO) if not a 
lot hoppier than most would choose.  Is the HSA a problem in the strainer 
due to boiling the entire 5 gals rather than a concentrated wort such as I 
am making?


TIA for any insight.

The only beerhunter I know is the game where you shake up one beer in a case

Lee asked in HBD#1342 about German malt from Durst. In December Scott
Birdwell of DeFalcos in Houston sent me some of their Pils malt to
play around with. We made a Helles style lager (OG=1.054, FG=1.013)
with it using W-34/70 as the yeast strain. Samples tasted from cold 
storage rang my bell. There was a deep malty flavor which fully
displayed those special Bavarian flavor tones. I am going to bottle it this 
weekend, and if anything different results I will report it. At this
moment this malt seems to be very much the equal of Irek's malt, at a
fraction of the price.


I was unaware of the Durst Vienna malt until Lee mentioned it on HBD, but
I am certainly going to try some. Lee, thanks for pointing out that it
is available.

In HBD 1342,Greg Bishop asks about printing the postscript version of Cat's
Meow on a Macintosh.  I did it using Apple's Laserwriter Utility (ver. 7.1)
with an Apple Laserwriter.  This program has an option under the Utilities
menu called "Download PostScript File...".  You just have to make sure you
have a printer that supports Postscript (I think most Apple printers,
certainly the Laserwriters, do).  


I downloaded the version of Cat's Meow that has all of the even pages in
one file and the odd pages in another file, allowing me to print the odd
pages, turn the paper over, put it back in the paper tray, and print the
even pages on the other side (thus saving paper).  As long as one downloads
and follows the instructions, this works really well (took me a minute to
figure out, though).

Subject: pH Unit


Gary Kuyat asks:


>It is accurrate to .1 pH unit. (What the heck is that unit called anyway???)


The pH unit is called "pH".  It is the inverse logarithm of the concentation of 
hydrogen ions in the solution.  


        ie: if the solution is 4 ppm hydrogen ions, that is .000004,
        log(.000004) = -5.398, so pH is the inverse of this (not the
        recipricol), or pH = 5.4. 


        Note that the pH of *pure* water is 7.0.  This is considered 
        "neutral".  What is the concentration of hydrogen ions in
        a sample of pure water?  Well, that would be:


            1 * 10 ^ -7 = .0000001  or 0.1 ppm, or 100 ppb 


        See?   Try it yourself for values of 1 part per thousand (.001), 
        and for one part per billion (.000000001).  Since we think of 
        "acidity" as something like "Are there more hydrogen ions in here 
        than in pure water?", you should have some idea which way the 
        numbers will go before you start.  


And that's about all I remember about it from freshman chemistry.  I *do* need 
to review this...

Subject: Cannibis and Brewing....




All of this talk about cannibis and beer has got me thinking,
particularly after reading Chuck Cox's posting yesterday.  While I
have no problem with anyone using pot, I think it's important that if
anyone uses it as a "special hop" in beer, it should be identified to
the consumer prior to drinking, as I'm sure Chuck did with MJ.


What I'm getting at is that some people have an intolerance to THC,
causing a severe reaction.  If one brews a "Brain Death Barleywine"
and submits it to a competion without clearly identifying "Contains
Marijuana" on the entry form, an unsuspecting BJCP judge with an
intolerance to THC may have a reaction serious enough to go to
the hospital.


I'm speaking from experience.

January/February issue):
"I was pleased to see 
that you didn't lead people down the garden path over the use of wood. Wooden
barrels are ju
st too much hassle - even our most traditional brewers rarely use them
nowadays - and beer from nice clean aluminum tastes just as good. It would be
a shame if the use of wood died out completely, but there are dozens more
important issues surrounding beer quality. Don't make life more difficult
than it already is!"


Though CAMRA makes no mention of what kind of wood is used for wooden casks
(the spiles, for example, are made of various woods), I take it as
significant that one of the staunchest defenders of quality and preservation
of real ale (CAMRA) feels quite comfortable with stainless steel.

Subject: Belgian Chocolate?


I recently brewed what was supposed to be an English Brown Ale.  I used the
following grain bill:


6# 2-Row Klages
1# Light brown sugar
 .5# Belgian Chocolate 
 .5# 60L Crystal


and fyi..
1 oz. Norther Brewer at 50 mins.
Total boil:  90 mins.


The result was a beer that ended up with a noticeable amount of oxidation (due
to a mashing process error), too much alcohol (OG 1.058, FG 1.012) and a very 
biting roasty flavor more reminiscent of a stout than a Brown Ale.  I 
understand the oxidation and alcohol problems, but the biting roasty flavor 
still has me stumped.  I am wondering if "Belgian" Chocolate might give a 
stronger flavor than say a "British" Chocolate.  Can anyone comment on whether 
or not this is correct?  If not, then what could the problem be?  TIA for
any info.

Al Korzonas wrote a few digests ago, and then there were comments
about boiling to drive off the hop aromatics, and Al had mentioned
that if one could figure out a way to boil and not drive off the
hop aromatics, then one would be a hero.


In fact, it's been done.  All it really takes is a covered boil.
This is not real practical for homebrewers, but it has been tried
on a commercial scale.  This has a bunch of effects:  It raises
the pressure, so raising the boiling point and increasing hop
utilization, and therefore allows shorter boiling times, a net
increase especially considering energy costs.  ***BUT*** it has
not been adopted commercially.  Why?  Because the hop and malt
aromatics made decidely *BAD* beer.  Tasters rejected it over-
whelmingly.  Now this doesn't explain why late hops work, except
that maybe the aroma compounds are altered negatively by the long
boil times.

Jack Skeels asked if Red Tail yeast in the bottle was viable.
The answer is yes.  When interviewing Sid Stafford, head of
brewing at Mendocino (makers of Red Tail) for my book, I asked
If a lot of homebrewers cultured the yeast from their bottle.
He replied that they did, but they preferred that homebrewers
didn't.  My immediate reaction was that some of the Anchor-
yeast-paranoia had rubbed off, but then Sid went on to say 
that the reason was they felt the yeast was too old by the time
a homebrewer got it.  He then said they would rather a 
homebrewer bring a sterile container to the brewery and they 
would give them all fresh, viable yeast they wanted!


But if you don't live close to the brewery, the bottle yeast
will work fine.  I've had many beers made with this yeast,
cultured from the bottle.


He also asks why it's clumpy.  That's just the yeast.  I'm not
sure if they use a fining agent, but I know the beer is filtered
prior to bottling. It is then kauesened with some beer from
one of the primaries going on and bottled.

Pete Zingleman asks how to tell if his hops are still any good.
Smell them.  If you smell anything you don't want to come out
in your beer, don't use them.

There has been some discussion of oak flavors in an IPA and in
general for beer.  It is my understanding that oak IPA casks
were lined with pitch, so no oak flavor will result.  The same
is true of the wooden fermenters used (or used to be) for making
Pilsner Urquel.  A-B boils the beechwood to make sure that it
doesn't impart any flavor to the beer.  Oak flavors in IPAs are
reportedly a "modern" interpretation of the style, and the real
thing probably had no oak flavor at all.

Jeff Frane questioned Al K's assertion that barleywine was dry-
hopped.  I can't say for any English barleywines, but the two
most popular US-made barleywines (Anchor Old Foghorn and Sierra
Bigfoot) are most definitely dry hopped.


Jeff also asked a long time ago why his responses that quoted
other posts were kicked back for being over 80 characters.  It's
most likely because the carets (>) that are usually added to a
quote kicked the line length over.  I didn't post this when he
asked because I felt sure someone else would respond, but I
don't recall anyone ever doing that, and this reminded me.

Now something of my own:


The other day I picked up at a book sale a book called 
"Chemical Sterilization" for $1.  I just had a quick look at
it this morning, and it mentioned what seems like a near
perfect sterilant:  glutaraldehyde.  It appears to also go by 
the trade name Cidex.  It purportedly kills much faster and
better than chlorine or iodine based solutions, rinses away
well, has low volatility and is completely non-corrosive.


Like I say, I've only looked at the data for a few minutes.
Glutaraldehyde is listed in my Fisher catalog but that's as far
as I've got.  I'll look in my Merck Index tonight.  But does
anyone else have any experience or data on this stuff?

Subject: Little porta-keg thing?




Hello:
        In this months Brewing Techniques in the new New Products 
section, there is a product described that looks very interesting to me.  
I can't remember the name of the device, but it is manufactured by a 
company called Liquid Bread out of Florida.  It is advertised as a device 
for making mini-kegs out of 2 and 3 liter soda bottles.  The description 
says you fill your bottle with beer, put the device on the top, squoosh 
out the air, fill the headspace with CO2, and that you can then force 
carbonate the beer and pressurize it up to 30-40lbs.  So it seems like it 
attaches to a gas fitting, can take high pressure, and allows you to 
dispense beer in some way.  If I am understanding it correctly (which I 
certainly might not be) is looks like it would be handy for taking 
relatively small amounts of beer to parties, peoples houses, etc.  My 
question is, does anyone else have a more cogent understanding of how 
this thing is supposed to work, has anyone actually USED one, and does it 
work as advertised.  I am sending in my handy Reader Service Card to get 
more info but thought the net might provide a quicker response time. 
thanks in advance.

I concur Jeff. In my tour of the Pilsener Urquell Brewery there was absolutely
no evidence nor mention of dry hopping going on. The tour was extensive taking
us through the mash and boil rooms into the fermentation cellars (we got a 
picture down into the top of an open toppped fermenter) and then into the lager
cellars (great shot of me in front of the kegging rig). Never was any mention
or evidence of dry hopping apparent. Such dry hopping would have been evident
from the equipment and techniques if it had been done. My experience is also
seconded by Darryl Richman's fine article written following his tour of
the Pilsener Urquell facility as well.

Prior to this diatribe I wish to state that many people have positive 
experiences using wooden casks for storing/aging of their beer. That said
I wish to put forth my beliefs based on travel and readings...


This is a phalacy that folks have attempted to refute on more than one 
occasion. Firstly there is a difference between American Oak and European Oak. 
European Oak which is used in Belgium, Britain, Germany, is very neutral
and imparts little or no flavors even when not treated (more on this later)
while American Oak has a decidedly pronounced flavor that is sharp and fairly
acrid. 


Mike Sharp of Lambic Digest fame found that he had to "break" in his Oak
cask made of American Oak to flavor it with Lambic and impermeate it with
his little critters as the tastes from the first batches (of which I tried
a few) were very sharp and unpalatable especially tasted side by side with
portions of the batch not Oak aged (which is not to say that those non Oak
aged early Lambics were astoundingly palateable, but they had a decidedly
different flavor).


The second factor is that at least in Germany all the wooden vessels are 
lined with a flavor neutral pitch so in fact the beer never touches the
wood itself. I believe this was also the practice in Britain. Most European
brewers chortle at silly American homebrewers who add Oak Chips thinking they
are somehow making their beers more authentic when in fact they are quite
misguided.


A final refutation of the use of Beechwood in Budweiser's Beechwood aging is
that in fact it is neither for aging (contact times are rather short) nor for 
flavoring. AB uses the Beechwood chips as a fining agent to help aid the 
flocculation of their yeast. Of course this fact is rather contradictory 
with marketing hype so for public consumption it is deemed "Beechwood aging"


Don't believe everything you read in brewing books. Something that appears
one way at face value (ie traditional use of wooden casks, esp. of say Oak)
has more to do with what materials were available and commercially used
(esp. for reasons of duraibility) than magic properties of the materials
themselves, and understanding the full manner of the practice of using them
(ie that they were almost always lined with pitch to seal them) is more 
telling than the many naive assumptions still propogated regarding them.
