I typically mistake the influence of Goldings for an unusual malt. Maybe we
should also be distinguishing between hop flavour and aroma here. A barleywine
like Gales Prize Old Ale is chock full of Goldings flavour, but this is
slightly different from aroma. I personally doubt whether any barleywine can
have significant aroma, in the strictest sense, on account of its maturity.
That is not to say that dry hopping could not have contributed to its
flavour.

Ok, let me introduce another crowd.  I LIKE the flavor of oak 
and sometimes add white oak chips TO THE BOIL.  I've even 
added it late (aroma oaks?). I find that the toasty/vanilla 
flavor goes well with a brown or mild ale if a very light 
hand is used. It can lend a subtle dimension if the 
perception is at or slightly above threshold.  It also works 
well with Viennas or amber lagers.  Of course, these beers 
are not intended to be brewed to any style or to do well in 
competitions, they are simply intended to be enjoyed.  I 
think they would confuse a judge or two ;-)  


On a related note, in addition to oak, pecan and chestnut do 
wonderful things as well as nutshells, nutmeats, morels, 
chantrells.....but now I'm way off the topic!

Not that I know enough to get into a flame war, but Michael Jackson shows
in his Beerhunter episode on German beers that one style of beer is aged
with great slabs of beechwood in the casks. It might have been a rauchbier
(smoked) but don't take it as gospel.


He also mentioned on the radio intervew he did some weeks back that AB goes
to a lot of trouble over Bud, citing the Beechwood aging, but confessed
that it was hard to discern any improvement.


Also, thanks for the advice on yeast scavenging/culturing. I have a big

Subject: definition of pH


Hi All,
Just thought I'd use one of my Analytical Chemistry references to clear up any
confusion about pH and what it means.  For documentation sake, I am a PhD
candidate in analytical chemistry and the following is a direct quote from a
good quantitative analysis text "Quantitative Chemical Analysis by Daniel C.
Harris".


     The definition of pH is


          pH = -log(Activity of H+) = [H+]*(gamma H+)


     Where
          [H+] = Concentration of hydrogen ion in (moles/liter)
          gamma H+ = activity coefficient for hydrogen ion.


     When we measure the pH we are measuring the negative log of the hydrogen
     ion activity, not the concentration.  To simplify life however, we will
     normally use the incomplete form when we speak of pH


          pH = -log[H+]


Just a few addditional notes for those of you who like this kind of stuff:


     6.02x10^23 molecules = one mole of molecules


     In general whenever you see a small p preceeding a variable it means
     take minus the log of that variable.


In practical terms, all that is probably necessary to know is that for aqueous
solutions, the normal pH range is 0 - 14 where a lower measured pH means that
you have a higher concentration of free hydrogen ions and the solution is
therefore more acidic.


If anyone out there is interested in more detailed info. you can send a request
to me and I'll point you in the direction of some books that have more about
the subject of acid/base chemistry than any normal person would ever want to
know.


See Ya,

Mitchell Evans asks about homebrewing BBSs:


Well, I started up a Homebrewing BBS about 1 month ago, interest has
been slowly creeping in, although I haven't as yet advertised in any of
the 3 local homebrew stores. I keep some HBD's on-line as well as other
stuff from the homebrewing archive. I'll let you know how things are
going in 6 months. Usually that's how long it takes to get a caller
base established on a BBS.


Oh, here's a shameless plug for this (free to call, totally non-profit

Subject: glutaraldehyde


In HBD 1343, Mark Garetz asked about using glutaraldehyde as a sterilant. 
I've been using a product called Metricide to disinfect EEG electrodes. 
I've also used glutaraldehyde for fixing (solidifying) brain tissue in rats
before removing it.  The solutions used for sanitizing contain only 2%
glutaraldehyde, and will kill most any germs and other assorted nasties
with a 45 min. contact time (it will completely sterilize with a 10 hr.
contact time).  As Ed Hitchcock said in HBD 1344, it might be risky using
this stuff with any food-related items.  When I used glutaraldehyde as a
fixative when perfusing rats, I treated it with respect (if you cut your
finger and get this stuff on it, you'll wish it was only salt water!).


The product Mark mentioned, Cidex, is not currently available.  I was told
by a company that normally sells it that the EPA is doing some testing on
it and other glutaraldehyde disinfectants, but they should be back on the
market soon.  The only one I know of that's currently being sold is
Metricide.  


It had crossed my mind to use this stuff in my brewing operation, but
putting any substance this nasty anywhere near my beer makes me nervous. 
Also, some of these glut. disinfectants contain a surfactant to make them
last longer (without it, the stuff is reusable for 14 days, with it, it
lasts 28 days).  I was told by a couple of other EEG technicians that, in
some of these products (including the Metricide that I'm currently using),
this stuff can form a thin layer on the EEG electrodes I'm disinfecting, so
they may not work as well.  This leads me to believe that the 28-day
solution could leave behind a film, even on well rinsed items.  Also, this
stuff gives off fumes that are probably carcinogenic.  So, ventilation and
a covered container are essential.


So, the 14-day solution (without the surfactant) might be safe to use, as
long as everything is rinsed very, very, very, very, well afterwards.  Even
so, I'm sticking to the tried and true sanitizers that I know hasn't made
anyone keel over.

Subject: troubleshoot


          Over the weekend, I bottled my latest and a sample revealed 
          a big problem. I think the problem comes from one of  three 
          variables.  The one variable I have no knowledge/experience 
          with is:
          
          What happens to the brew when you use a plastic fermenter 
          and oxygen passes through the plastic into the fermenting 
          wort? How would the oxygen affect the taste?
          
          I suspect one of the other two variables is the real 
          problem, but I'd like to know theories/experiences others 
          have had with plastic/oxygen.

Subject: Re: pH


          FYI


          The origin of the term pH was debated a month or so ago on
          the internet chemstry education discussion group (chemed-l).
          As I recall there was no difinitive answer but the general
          consensus is that it came from potential Hydrogen.  But
          potential could be translated from any of 5 or 6 languages
          and no one really knows remembers who thought of it first.
          SO -- If us chemists can't figure it out, us brewers really
          shouldn't bother.


          HOWEVER


          Mr "t's" review of pH from Saturday was fine with one
          exception.  Hydrogen ion concentrations must be in
          moles/liter (not ppm or ppb) where a mole of H+ weighs
          1.0 g.  But since a liter is asumed to be 1000 g in a part
          per whaterver unit, the previously reported calculation were
          1000 times too big.


          Not a flame
          I'm a chemistry teacher
          It's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it.

Subject: report: dry hopping in a cornelius keg


About 4-5 weeks ago, I asked HBD what the wisdom was w.r.t. dry hopping beer
in the keg.  The majority of the posts ranged from 1/2 oz to 1 oz.


I just tapped the keg.  It is a light porter, I guess that is the best way
to describe it.


I dry hopped it with 1 oz Kent Goldings plugs in a muslin bag, sunk to the
bottom with a big glass marble.


The beer conditioned in the keg for a period of 3-4 weeks.  There isn't too
much of a noticible hop nose to the beer - I was actually counting on a very
strong hop nose.  Then again, I tend to be more of a hophead then the
average homebrewer.


Next time I do this, I am going to _double_ the dosage: i'll use 2 ounces
of leaf hops.  I want to _smell_ them hops!!!!  :-H

Subject: annoying low-fills


When going out to a bar, I always enjoy getting some 'good brew'.  But,
for good brew, you typically have to pay a top price.  Here in the Boston
area, $3.25-$3.75 a pint (16oz) is typical.


I don't mind paying that price, but when I order a pint, I want 16oz, not
13oz!


It is amazing how many people are getting ripped off out here.  If the glass
isn't filled with beer (without the head) right to the very top of the glass,
the you are not getting 16 oz of beer.  Ever pour a 12oz bottle of beer in
one of those straight-sided 16oz glasses?  It damn near fills it, maybe 1/2"
below the top of the glass.  That is how lots and lots of pints are sold here
in this area.  They charge you a price for 16oz and you are getting 12-13oz
of beer!!  That last 1/2 inch of the glass is about 4 oz of beer!  


Recently I was at the Union Street Bar (?) in Newton and I ordered a Harpoon 
winter ale.  It was a pitiful pint, as i like to say, maybe 13 oz of beer.
I asked the bartender to top it off, and he said, "that's the way we pour them
here."  He didn't get a tip.  Several bartenders usually oblige me, although
I sense a bit of unwillingness sometimes.


Maybe I'm jaded having been to England where they are very careful to give
you a full, 20oz pint of beer, exactly what you pay for.


I'd love to mount a campaign for "correct" pints, but have no idea how
to do it.  I speculate that these bars do it intentionally, playing on
the lack of attention/concern from their patrons.  It is a sad ripoff, I
think.

  So, you're saying I _shouldn't_ enter my "LSD Oatmeal Stout" in the GABF???
You should see _all the colors_ when you hold it up to the light!  


  Personally, I suspect that someone brewing a cannabis beer would be more 
likely to run around wearing a sign reading "ARREST ME, PLEASE!" than clearly 
label it and/or enter it in a competition, but one never knows, eh?  "Relax", 
I think that the probability approaches zero that you'll encounter such a brew

Another data point wrt wooden casks.  During my travels through
Germany, one of the most consistent findings was that when a beer
passed from "ooooh thats really good" to "ohmygod, this is heaven",
the differnece often was that the beer was dispensed directly from
a wooden barrel, ala Andechs.  It may be pitch lined, but it sure
works wonders for the beer.  This is still practiced by the Munich
breweries for the Doppels, and some incredible Franconian Darks were
also dispensed this way.

I use it for hood/instrument cleaning and for yeast fridge (especially around

Subject: More on Oxygen


Hello Group,
Let me start by saying that I did not intend to speak as an Expert on Wort
Oxidation. As an engineer, I am used to doing a literature search, reading, 
and then putting together a summary position. But, as my wife constantly 
assures me, I Could Be Wrong! That said, Let me thank Al for his inputs. 


Jonathon Knight wanted to know more of what oxygen can do:


According to Dr. Fix in the Zymurgy Trouble Shooting Issue ('87):
Acetaldehyde is a precuror to ethanol during the fermentation process. 
Ethanol can also be oxidized to form Acetaldehyde...produced by oxidation, 
it produces unpleasant acetic-cider tones.


Also from the same issue, Dave Schroedl writes about Oxidation:
The oxidized/stale flavor is caused by a compound called Trans-2-nonenal. The
sherrylike-winey flavor by acetaldehyde and furfural compounds. The rotton
pineapple-garbage (flavor) is caused by higher alcohols and the same compounds
as listed abouve.


I was interested in the Pasteur Effect and that oxygen introduced during
fermentation can produce more Diacetyl. More good reasons not to allow aeration
once fermentation has started.


These effects are why good siphoning practices are encouraged when transferring
beer to a secondary or for bottling. Any splashing while it is exposed to the
air during transfer can cause more oxygen to be absorbed. A good practice
during siphoning is to do it slowly at first by keeping the difference in
elevation small, and keep the outlet below the surface so that there is no
turbulance as the container fills.

Friday night I set out to make a good Bohemian Pilsner.  I bought
Wyeast Bohemian Lager Yeast a couple of days before and the bag had
puffed up nicely.  Friday night I cooked the extract and the hops and
put the stuff in a plastic water jug to begin primary fermentation.  I
Added the yeast at 65F and placed a cork, size 8 1/2, and a
fermentation lock on the jug.  On Sunday, I finally started seeing a
little bit of foam on the surface.  I went out for the day and at
6:30pm, the foam and CO2 pressure had blown the airlock right off the
fermenter.  I sanitized a hose and placed in the hole in the cork.
All was going well, but the hose was a tad on the loose side and stuff
was coming out the cork.  So, I decided to push the hose in a little
deeper and POP, the cork fell into the beer!  I quickly sanitized a
glass and placed  over the opening to keep any nasties from falling
in.


Is my beer doomed?  And please, stop laughing.  It could happen to
anyone....

Subject:      re: laaglander in starters


Greetings,
  I have had the same experience as Mark Woods concerning yeast starters
made with Laaglander DME, NO APPARENT FERMENTATION, not a single burp
from the airlock, NOTHING!!!  However, like most other things,
don't worry, use the starter.  I have pitched these unassuming starters
into over eight different 5-gallon batches and have had good starts
(carboy bubbling merrily away within six hours) in every instance.
These flat starters occurred with three different yeast strains, WYeast
american ale, Wyeast london ale, and yeast cultured from a Chimay bottle.
The specific gravity of the starter does not seem to matter either, I
have tried from 1.020 to 1.045 and still no bubbles.  It certainly seems
to be associated with the Laaglander; can anyone comment as to why?
I'm not concerned (since the starters work), just curious.

Subject: Hop Back


I have received a couple of requests for info on my hop back, and I thought
it might be of general interest to you gadget freaks out there:


My hopback is based on the Kinney Baughman model from the Zymurgy Gadgets and
Equipment Special Issue.  Kinney recommends using a 1-quart mason jar for
the extra capacity.  Mine is a 1-pint mason jar.  It will hold 1/2 ounce of
loose hops, maybe more if I pack them.  The 1-quart would be nice.


Kinney drills holes in the top of the jar and installs grommets for an
air-tight seal (this is important).  I acquired a large rubber stopper
(green) similar to, but much bigger than, the stoppers used on carboys.  This
stopper was punched in a machine shop so that two 3/8" copper tubes could be
pushed through.  I think the rubber stopper is more reliable, but the
lid/grommets should work fine.


The inflow pipe goes to the bottom of the jar and the outflow pipe pulls
liquid from the top of the jar.  The outflow pipe has part of copper scrubber
clamped on with piece of wire, and then around that is a nylon hop bag tied
on to the pipe.  This works as a good filter to keep the hops out of the CF
chiller.  Kinney solders a 1/2" copper end cap onto the outflow pipe of his
hop-back.  It is used, I believe, just to keep the scrubber and bag from
slipping off the end.  I just flared the end of the outflow pipe for this
same purpose.


To use it, I preheat it with hot water to avoid temperature shock, then fill
it with loose hops.  Next, push on the stopper and make the connections to
kettle and chiller.  Finally, start the flow and watch it fill.  It has the
added benefit of filtering out hotbreak from the kettle.  The original
commercial hop-backs were designed to filter out the kettle hops (get the
hops back) and the hot break as well.  A final note:  I include the hop-back
hops in my IBU calculations, as if they were in the boil for the entire time
it takes to run the wort through (about 15 minutes in my case).  Why?  The
temperature of the wort is near boiling, and the movement of the wort through
the hops is similar to the boiling action.


The first time I used this gadget, I thought "HSA", because hot wort is
moving through a vessel partially full of air.  I later read that the steam
coming off the wort is enough to keep the oxygen down and that it doesn't
appear to cause problems in commercial operations.  I have had no noticable
HSA problems and it is true that the jar fills with steam and the air is, of
course, pushed out through the chiller.

Subject: Fate of Ballantine India Pale Ale


Ballantine IPA was, after many, many corporate buyouts and takeovers,
produced in the Fort Wayne, Indiana Falstaff brewery, owned by General
Brewing. This was the former Berghoff brewery built by the famous Chicago
restaurant family that now owns the Huber brewery in Monroe, Wisconsin.
Anyway, the old Berghoff plant was a creaking, leaking dinosaur suffering
from years of deferred maintenance, and so General decided to close it
and tear it down. They moved production of the Ballantine brands to their
well-maintained, modern, efficient (and even more historic) Pabst brewery
in Milwaukee. We still get it from time to time here in the Chicago area,
and it is basically the same beer, a pretty good effort for a mass beer
factory. However, I believe that they are producing quite a bit less of
it than they did in Fort Wayne. Microbreweries have cut into B-IPA
sales considerably.


General has always been somewhat of an enigma among brewery holding
companies - occasional success simply stupefies them. They really didn't
know how to handle, or capitalize upon, the attention the beer geek crowd
was paying to Ballantine IPA in the late 1980's, and they probably blew a
chance to make some money on it. They also have been relatively slow to
try to capitalize upon the recent success their flagship Pabst Blue
Ribbon brand has been having at recapturing some of its former large
market share in the Midwest, and have just recently alloted an actual
advertizing budget for PBR. Strange.

Subject: Lager Procedures


I have decided to take advantage of the Chicago weather and make an
outdoor lager.  Since this is my first attempt at a lager, I'm not sure
exactly what to do.  I plan on pitching room temperature yeast into
room temperature wort in the primary (plastic) fermenter, then moving
the fermenter outdoors, shielded from the wind and sun.  After fermentation
begins (2-3 days) I plan on racking to the secondary (glass), which I can 
encase in styrofoam.


Questions:


Any problems with my plans?


How long should I expect to lager prior to bottling?


Is there anything special I need to do at bottling time?


Since I am about a month behind in reading the HBD, private E-mail 
would be appreciated.


Thanks in advance

Subject: 2 questions - pH test papers and lactic acid


Question 1 -
I just started using some Crosby and Baker pH test strips that I bought about
3 years ago.  They are enclosed in a little glass tube.  I find them 
very hard to use.  Do these go bad?  Or is it just me that 
has a heck of a time matching the color of the strip to the one on the 
instructions.


I know my tap is 7.0 (from using an aquarium pH test kit), but I have a 
tough time figuring this out with the strips.  Could they have gone bad? 
I don't want to buy more unless these could have gone bad.


Question 2 -
Along the same lines, for acidifying my sparge water I recently got some 
lactic acid.  Based upon the fact that I am not comfortable with the pH
readings I can get currently, could somebody give me a ballpark idea 
on how much to use for acidifying 4 gallons of VERY soft water.
Is it more likely to be .5 tsp of lactic acid or 2 tsp lactic acid?
Miller mentions mixing 2 tsp in 3 cups water, but doesn't explain if you are 
then supposed to use just a little of this mix, or most of the mix.


In case you are wondering why I am using lactic acid ----
I am using lactic acid because Miller highly recomends it.  I use gypsum 
in my strike water to adjust the pH, calcium and sulfate, but cannot use 
it in the sparge water to adjust pH because I would then have to much calcium 
and sulfate.  


I am not expecting a lot of responses on this (as it is probably not the most 
exciting of questions) so if you have any knowledge of the above, please 
email me.


TIA

Subject: Copper, and Zima


I've observed a strange thing.  My cooler, mash tun has a copper
manifold dealio in the bottom. I also have a copper tube which extends
upward and has a sprinkler attached.  


What I've observed is this: The copper UNDER the mash stays shiny,
while the copper ABOVE the mash becomes darkened and has a filmy 
coating. When rubbed on the fingers and sniffed- it has a strange
metallicy sort of smell. Not something I like, or want in my beer.


I'm presuming this is a matter of oxidation making the copper
darker, and the acidity of the mash maintaining a clean copper.
Like dropping an old penny into a vinegar bath.


So:  Question here is,  should I worry?  Should I /could I do anything
about it. I guess I could rinse the copper in a mild acid bath.
Did I get the wrong kind of copper perhaps? Am I braindead (don't answer that)


***
Zima:  Found some in CA over x-mas. Clear as a whistle.


Taste?  Yes it has taste.  Have you ever tried Squirt or any of those
citrusy-grapefruit like sodas?  Add a shot of vodka and there you have it.
Zima.  Malt beverage?  Hah....maybe a long time ago (pre-processing).


Ya sure. FIne. It may have a quality of it's own. More like a wine cooler-
many of which are also malt-based beverages. But it ain't beer.


I have one bottle I was gonna save- ya know , to sit on a shelf for looks-thru
But toot suggested I save the cap from the opened one, fill it with water
and re-cap.  Looking at it- who would know!

Alright alright...I give.  Let go-a my arm already!   Uncle!  Uncle!


I guess no-one gathers that any mention of the "big boys" should 
automatically have a  :)  attatched.  I don't consider their "methods"
of "brewing" to be anywhere near what we as homebrewers and micros and such
consider "brewing techniques".  Our goals are SO different.
        1. Miller,Coors,Bud:  Make a beer with no taste/no color.
                Sells LOTS of it!  Then market other products w/logo!
        2. Us and them.  Make tasty, quality, varied brews of numerous
                differnt styles and flavors and colors. Enjoy it slowly.


Just one spuds opinion.  I was intending to kid about bud and beachwood.
Sorry if it wasn't obvious enuf.


As for the use of oak: if anyone followed before, the cask I have access
to is from Hofbrau, so it's gonna be european oak. If it's been pitched, 
then so be it.  Yes- american oak is very different. 


Ok...so maybe oak "flavor" isn't an essential of style, but just a 
coincidence of "packaging".  But it does have a quality of it's own.
It "can" make a contribution to a beers flavor. Some may not desire it,
some may even be repulsed.  The modern "cask-conditioning" is in steel,
or (gasp!) aluminum.  Ok. So it's easier to maintain.




BUT: I will stand by the fact that an oak cask "Looks neat, and is fun
to tap, and serve from!"  Don't bother with it if you don't want, but 
I'll try it again, just for the halibut. I'm like that.


Didn't intend to start a flame-wood-war or anything, and there are
obviously less than precise statements being made (by me for one!)
but that's what we're out here for. Sharing ideas, and occasionally-facts.

        Mark Garetz asked about glutaraldehyde as a sterilant.  Glutaraldehyde
is used as a tissue fixative in electronmicroscopy.  At 1 to 2% concentrations
it is a wonderfully fast fixative.  It will fix your fingers if you handle it. 
It will fix your corneas if you handle even the dilutions outside of a hood for
prolonged periods of time.  I'll bet it is a great sterilant, but all diluting
of it should be done in a hood.  I don't think it's a good idea for use in
brewing.

Subject: extract usage




I just finished bottling my first lager.  It was a recipe that used
Root Beer extract as a flavoring (thanks to those that supplied recipes)
As I was looking over the instructions that came with the extract:


Briefly  mix extract with 4.5 lbs of regular sugar and warm water pitch
Bread yeast and bottle.  


I have made this before a long time ago (before beer) and was wondering 
what stops these things from all blowing up?  Some of the beer catalogs
suggest using champagne yeast for their extracts.  Either way with so 
much sugar it seems like a disaster waiting to happen.  I didn't give it
a second thought as a kid.  We even used Lucky Lager stubby bottles,
which are not a returnable but have pop-off tops.  I think one bottle 
blew up.  Anyway, just curious.  I am thinking of using the rest of 
the extract to make some soda, but was going to use corn sugar (less) and
either the champagne yeast or maybe an ale yeast.  Would this combination
produce the aforementioned hand-grenades?

I think that you may be surprised by the difference if you cool before
any aeration.  I was.  Initially, I cooled by adding a gallon of boiled,
chilled icewater.  This made such a difference, I immediately built an
immersion wort chiller.  I suggest you try chilling somehow and then see
what a difference it can make.

It can occur anytime the beer is hot (generally most agree that anything
hotter than 80F is considered too hot) and is oxygenated.  The flavor/aroma
is sherrylike -- it's really obvious when you compare side-by-side.  I don't
know if concentrated wort would oxidize faster or slower than if you were
doing a full boil, but I contend that it's a bad idea in both cases.

The DeWolf-Cosyns Chocolate malt that we get here in the US is "debitterized"
whatever that means.  There apparently is also a "non-debitterized" version,
but it's not imported.  I have not used British Chocolate, but the DWC
Chocolate malt, I feel, is much less astringent than Briess, which is the
only other Chocolate malt that I've used.  Please note that there are two
brands of Belgian malts now imported into the US, so you may have the other
one.  Ask your retailer.  The Belgian malt distributed through L.D.Carlson
is not the DeWolf-Cosyns malt.  I have no experience with the non-DWC Belgian
malt.

Actually, I'll bet it was not hop aromatics that were the offending
ones but rather compounds from the malt that made the beer "bad."
I'd have to pull out my books and journals to check for more candidates,
but offhand, I know that DMS is unpleasant at high levels, usually
boiled-off in a standard "open-boil" and would be retained in a
"closed-boil" system.  DMS evaporation was exactly one of the reasons
I had in mind when I said that there currently was no way to retain
bittering hop aromatics in the boil.
