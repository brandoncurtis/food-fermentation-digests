I posted a message a few months back (HBD 1260) about the CF chiller I
made.  I bought a box of 50' of 3/8" OD (1/4" ID) soft copper tubing.
I used 30 feet when making the chiller although I could have probably
have gotten away with less than 30 feet as I get the wort from about
200F to 70F with a very low water flow rate.  I used some of the
remainder to make an aerating wand and a siphon cane.  The smaller
diameter does mean that it takes 15 to 25 minutes to drain 5 gallons of
wort through the thing.  I don't mind as I can use the time to get the
yeast ready and clean up the mess I've made in the kitchen.  A larger
diameter would drain faster but would require more water.  Also a 3/4"
diameter hose is a lot cheaper than the 1" hose you'd need with the
larger pipe.


I avoid the clogging problem by siphoning from the boiling kettle into
a 6 gallon food-grade plastic bucket that has a tap at its base.  I use
the copper cane with a copper scrubber and mesh bag on its submerged
end to filter the hot break and hops from the wort.


The bucket of hot wort is taken to the garage and placed on top of the
washing machine.  The CF chiller sits on a stool just below it and the
carboy sits on the floor.  I use some 3/8" ID plastic tubing to connect
all this and then just open the tap and watch it work.  The wort is
chilled, aerated, and transfered to the carboy all in one step.

I used two garden hose Y adapters, the yellow plastic kind with ball
valve shutoffs on the arms of the Y.  If they leak you can fill the gap
with epoxy (silicon calking won't hold up to the pressure).  On mine,
one end leaks a little and the other doesn't, I don't worry about it.

If I ever get my half barrel converted to a boiling kettle I may need
to deal with this.  With my present setup (mash and boil in the
kitchen, cool, pitch, and ferment in the garage) it is easier and more
convenient to siphon the hot wort off the break and into an easy to
carry bucket.  As always, YMMV.

Subject: Need help priming with wort...


Ok, so I made a couple of errors.


Some of you noted that you surely want more than 1 volume of CO2 for
carbonation.  Yup.  However, some of that CO2 is already dissolved in
the beer as it comes out of the fermenter.  At 60F, approximately .9
volumes of CO2 are already dissolved in a saturated solution.  Thus,
producing 1 more volume from priming will give you almost 2 volumes,
the "usual" carbonation level.


The more egregious error was in my statement:
>   With dry malt extract, at 40pt-gal/lb, you'd add about the same.  


I forgot that you'll only get 75% attenuation.  So you want to add
more like 5-6 oz DME (4oz / .75 = 4 oz * (1 + 1/3) = 5.33).  Same
applies to adding gyle. (I.e., add 1/3 more than the simple
calculation tells you.)


If you krauesen with actively fermenting wort (or is it beer by
then?)  then it's a bit more complex: to get fermentable sugars left
in the krauesen, take the OG-1, multiply by .25 (to get the presumed
unfermentable content) subtract from the SG-1 of the krauesen at the
time of addition to get remaining fermentable extract.


An example
        OG = 1.040
        SG = 1.030 at time of krauesening
        UG = (OG-1)*.25 = .040*.25 = .010
        SG-1-UG = .020
        .020 / .002 = 10
Thus, you want to dilute the krauesen 10:1.  For a final quantity of 5
gallons, add 1/2 gallon of krauesen.

Subject: Protein and iso-humulone analysis.


Speaking of 2-dimensional protein electrophoresis ... I have enlisted
the help of a fellow brewer here at ZGI and we are considering running
a number of 2-dimensional protein electrophoresis tests on a number of 
quality beers.  This test first separates the proteins (peptides) along 
the first dimension by electric charge then along the second dimension by 
molecular weight.  What we are hoping to generate is a series of protein
signatures of individual beers and perhaps cluster such signatures into
styles.  For example, there may be an "English Bitters" protein signature 
that typifies the style.  Likewise for Pilsners and other styles.


Recent posts have described an optical assay for iso-humulone.  Has anyone
out there actually tried this?  We are also thinking of a time course
study of beer conditioning and iso-humulone concentrations.  I have
noticed that often my fully fermented pre-bottled wort is excellent, but
after a week of bottle conditioning it is almost undrinkably harsh, then
sometime during the 3rd week of conditioning the beer-fairy visits and
blesses all my bottles and the brew is wonderful again.  An assay for
a single bittering component may not tell us much, but it might.


Light bulb. Some of you may remember a rather ridiculous post about the
shape of Rager's hop utilization curve which has also been an interest of
mine.  What about taking wort samples every 5 minutes over the course of a
2 hour boil and assaying for iso-humulone?  Now the numeric values of
%utilization would only be as good as the %AA rating supplied with the
hops so they would be suspect, but the curve shape would be quite valid. 


Look out, I'm rambling and free-associating.  Maybe Mark Garetz of HopTech
could contribute a post as to the reliability of the %AA ratings we get
from retailers, and who and how they come up with these numbers. 


If anyone has any suggestions on these ideas or experience with either of 
these techniques I want to hear from you.

Subject: women brewing, flame, all grain question


i haven't been able to read the last few issues of the digest, so i don't
know what the background discussion to the women's brewing contest is, but
here's my cents:
the guys who are griping about it are using reverse political correctness,
if you ask me:  they are being so ultra-p.c. about equality that they get
mad when _they_ feel they have been left out.  the problem is that men and
women aren't treated equally, so it's useless to complain about the whole
issue.
as for me, i see it more as an inclusion than an exclusion.  the world of
homebrewing is definitely male dominated at the moment, and this seems to
be a good way to get more women interested.  i hope the contest goes well.


flame:
Phillip Seitz got mad at the entire digest because _one_ person made his
belgian friend leave the digest.  actually, i contributed to the "pot in
beer" discussion, so i deserve the flame:  that discussion was pointless,
immature, and i apologize for it.  however, to criticize the whole digest
is even more immature.  what do you expect, mr. seitz?  don't you think
that with the amount of people on this digest it is inevitable that once in
a while someone might write in something that offends someone else?  maybe
if your belgian friend had felt that he would  be able to learn something
from this digest and not just help out all us lowly novices he would have
been more likely to overlook the offense, wade through the crap that gets
posted here (including this post), and read the stuff that really counts. 
as i stated before, i accept the flame, but i think mr. seitz owes the rest
of the digest an apology.


lastly, i just read through papazian's section on all grain brewing for the
second time and i am still thoroughly confused.  does anyone know of some
literature on this subject that covers the process step-by-step (i can't
figure when to do what from charlie's book because he skips around so
much).


thanks in advance.

Subject: pH/Threading/Decoction


Larry Meyer (and others) mention that pH is temperature sensitive (several
posts ago I mentioned that it is not - a bad assumption on my part).  The
good news for me is that I pull off a teaspoon or less of liquid (from the
mash) and drop it onto a cold plate for checking the pH.  This is pretty sure
to drop its temperature to very near room temperature, and this is guaranteed
to be at least as accurate as comparing the color to a reference.  I guess my
original assumption wasn't so bad after all, i.e. I lucked out.

Decoctions are supposed to really bring out the malt flavors; much better
than any type of infusion, step, etc.

The low pH will prevent tannin extraction.


>Also, won't boiling a fraction of the mash kill off the enzymes in that
>partion of the mash? Does that matter?


That fraction of the mash needs to be held at conversion temperatures long
enough for it to convert, *before* it is boiled.  Also, one of the main
points to decoction mashing is to burst starch particles at these elevated
temperatures, so that they can in turn be converted to sugar by enzymes in
the main mash.  Of course, I should shut up and let the decoction experts
take over.  I don't think I committed any blasphemy yet...

I have a question on autolysis. We are told to rack to secondary to 
eliminate the possibility of cannibalism. But there is yeast sediment in 
secondary and after bottling. Why aren't we concerned about autolysis 
there? What characteristics does it add to beer?


On another note, does anybody else have trouble finding enough adjectives

I am going to be in Nashville next week and Vancouver at the end of the month.
Brewpubs?  I intend to brew a Belgian white in the next few weeks and was going
to use 45% wheat (flakes probably), 5% oats, and 50% malt.  I have Belgian

Restricting a competition based on gender is just one of many ways to
restrict things, no better or worse than any other.  Are there any other
restricted competitions out there?


If the idea is to get more women into competition (they really should
have no disadvantage in an open one), maybe the organizers should
consider working on getting novices of all types into it.


Nationally, Autocrossing/Solo I (parking lot racing) has special classes
for women.  Some of the women can beat most men in their class.  Our local
club does not have the ladies classes, but we set up a
novice/semi-interested/weird car class that anyone may compete in until
they walk off with a first place trophy.


A beer competition for those new to the sport may be a good idea.  Let
people compete against their peers, get good feedback from the judges to
improve their work, and then move them into the mainstream.

Doug Lukasik <LUKASIK_D`at`sunybroome.edu> has a problem with a hopbag that floats
in the carboy and blocks the outlet.
First, are you dryhopping in the primary? If so, try racking to a secondary and
not topping off. That will leave room for the bag and the beer won't be
fermenting so much anyway. Are you bottling or kegging your beer? If you keg,
you can dryhop in the keg. Remove the hopbag when you have reached the point of
perfect hoppiness. If you bottle, you might want to try not using a hopbag. Most
of the hops will float (as you have discovered) and not be a problem in racking
or bottling. You will loose a bit of beer to the hop layer, but not much.
