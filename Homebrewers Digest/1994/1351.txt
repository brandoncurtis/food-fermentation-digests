Subject:  Brewery Tours in UK




Does anyone have any first hand knowledge of smaller breweries in the
UK, where they welcome homebrewers and answer real questions.
We are going to the UK in June and would like to hit several of the
breweries for more information.  


In the past we have been stuck on the tourist list I guess and get really
less than knowledgible guides at many of the "big names" and come
away with little knowledge.  On a previous tour of Scottish breweries
and distillers the tiny places often had the brewmaster or owner take
you aroung and if you asked knowledgible questions they knocked
themselves out showing you the guts of their lifes work (not to mention
the private bottle of 40 year old single malt, or the "personal" batch of
heavy.


Cheers and thanks 1!

I've noticed several posts lately regarding short pints in various pubs. 
It has also been mentioned that, in civilized countries (i.e. England), 
there are laws against that sort of thing. Most pubs in the UK use 
glasses that are marked at the pint level (19.6 oz) with a line about a 
half inch or so below the rim. It's a great solution and I've been 
wondering if there is a source for such glasses in the US. If anyone 
knows of such, please post or email me the address. Cheers.

I can't speak for Phil Seitz, but what I expect is a mature and
responsible approach to the rare opportunity HBD represents.  We
haven't seen much of that lately, have we?


>  don't you think

Not necessarily.  There was a time when such things were rare, because
the participants in the discussion didn't take HBD for granted, and
understood that the responsibility for maintaining the quality
of the discussion was theirs.  That understanding has apparently
been lost.

Just exactly so:  as long as the discussion is heavy in noise and light
on signal, the very people HBD needs most will have _no_ incentive
to participate.  Why on earth _should_ they?


It's as simple as this:  You don't piss in the well gives you water.
Many who have been some of the most valuable voices on HBD post
rarely or not at all now, because they don't need the noise.  If
your postings are mostly met with nitpicks and flames, you have to
conclude that your contribution isn't valued, right?  The same
applies for grossly inappropriate requests.

And I disagree.  He gave us a wakeup call that we seriously needed.

I favor Dave Miller's "Complete Handbook of Homebrewing" (Garden
Way, Storey Publications, '88 or thereabouts).  For leading you
through the intricacies of all-grain brewing, I know of no better

On January 23, the Grateful Deaf (Hearing Impaired) Homebrewing Club held
their 2nd annual home brewing competition at Admiralty Beverage in
Portland Oregon.  Jim Kennedy the owner of Admiralty deserves all our
thanks for providing the facilities for an excellent event.


AHA judges, mostly from the Oregon Brew Crew, judged all beers in 10
categories.  Our thanks go out to the Oregon Brew Crew and all the volunteer
judges.


The awards ceremony was held during halftime of the Superbowl at KC's
Sports Center in Portland, OR.  The event was attended by approximately
_150 deaf/hearing impaired homebrewers and affectionados.  Grateful Deaf
homebrew was served as well as beer donated by Northwestern Brew Pub,
Nor'Wester (Willamette Valley Brewing), McMenamins, Star, Widmer, and
Portland Brewing.  Our thanks go to all these Breweries for their
contribution and support.


Best of Show award went to Scott Martin for his Brown Ale.  Best on Tap
award also went to Scott Martin for his IPA.  Ken Fisher received the Home
Brewer of the year award.  Ken is the president of the club and the
driving force behind the competition and the awards ceremony.

HELP! 


I've read everything there is to read, and now I'm ready to take the 
all-grain plunge. I'm pretty nervous, because I haven't even seen 
anybody perform a full mash before, and I'm more or less winging it. 


I'm attempting the "Trappist" recipe out of the Cat's Meow, and am 
unsure whether I should dough-in all grains simultaniously, including 
the malted wheat.  I'm planning on using the step-infusion called for 
in the recipe.


If anyone out there could give me some pointers (and encouragement), 
I would be very appreciative.  Be gentle...


Private mail is ok (in fact, preferred), unless you think it's 
beneficial to everyone else out there.


Thanks in advance.

   You need to cool the wort to 70 degrees because hotter wort might kill
the yeast.  Yes, there is something seriously wrong with waiting until the
morning to pitch your yeast--you dramatically increase the chance that 
bacteria and wild yeast will infect your brew and contribute nasty flavors.
As a general rule, the sooner  you pitch the yeast, the better--immediately
pitching the yeast is the best route.  There is no need to let your wort
sit for ANY amount of time prior to pitching your yeast.  If you are   
brewing with malt extract, do this: keep the sterile water in your 
refrigerator until you are ready to brew (i.e., the 3 gallons of water
you will put in the fermenter to mix with the wort).  While brewing,
put the 3 gallons of water in your freezer for 45 minutes or until it
begins to show signs of freezing.  After boiling your 2-2.5 gallons of
wort, cover the pot and submerge it in very cold water for 10 minutes (I
use a laundry tub and fill it with cold water with some ice cubes). Next,
pour your 3 gallons of VERY cold water into the carboy and strain in the
2 gallons of partially cooled (though still hot) wort.  You should find
that the temperature of the mix is now at a good pitching temperature.
So, pitch your yeast immediately and you should notice that they start
fermenting immediately (i.e., you will see CO2 bubbles starting to form
in the airlock)--if not, you are not making your yeast starter properly.


Hope this helps!

Subject: The Way We Were


I normally ignore the flames, off subject posts, and other irritations 
of net life to the best of my ability;  I know that the larger the HBD 
audience grows, the more it will resemble the rest of Usenet.  I used 
to encourage people to join the HBD because it was a high quality 
resource, where the discussion was focused and people could politely 
agree to disagree where objective science left off and art began.  
There was a certain respect for each other, because even if we were 
treading different paths, we had the same goals.  Now I'm not so sure.  
I certainly don't give the HBD the glowing recommendations that I used to.

Guilt by association.  You may feel that it is unfair to the rest of 
the reading public -- and it is -- but if we want to make the digest 
return to its former high state of signal to noise, we must all work 
together to do it.  It only takes a few selfish people to ruin it for 
everyone else.


> don't you think

Of course it is.  It has always been so.  The difference is whether 
there is enough mutual respect present to overcome problems like this.  
With that respect in place, an occasional bad posting is seen as an 
aberration;  without it, it looks to be the norm.  Until we return to a 
state where we accord some respect to what other people want out of 
this digest, we will not be able to attract and keep those sources we 
really treasure on the net.

Consider what causes someone to give up their time for the digest;  why 
should a busy person read the HBD for the few nuggets that interest 
them, or take the time to answer a question when the only result from 
this investment is a lack of respect and a continuous show of 
selfishness?  One might read the digest for a while and grow to respect 
the other posters for their insight, resourcefulness, or knowledge in a 
variety of areas.  Only then would there be some real basis for putting 
up with a problem poster or two.  Only then could one be certain of 
getting a return in kind.  Respect is not given automatically, it is earned.

I have been using the Hoplet plugs for the last several batches and have found
them to be quite good.   However, I have recently had  bad experience
with Styrian and Kent Goldings and Fuggles.  When I opened the package
they smelled very cheesy and were yellow.  I decided not to use them in
my dry hop and will be bringing them back to my supplier.


Anyone else have this experience?  I can't remember the brand but here is
the description of the package and contents:


 -packaged in a barrier/foil type of bag with professional lettering
 -they say they were packaged in the UK
 -there are ten 1/2oz hop plugs
 -sell for about $ 4 to 5 a package


The cascades and norther brewer have been very good.


Any clues here?

Subject: Useless Brewing Items


I would like to start a message thread listing worthless brewing items
that people have purchased or considered purchasing.  Here are my two
contributions to the list:


IODINE TEST STRIPS
These are used to test the strength of iodine sterilizer. 
Unfortunately, their color change is so slight that you are better off
using the color change of the iodine solution itself. In other words, it
is easier to observe the change from clear, to amber, to light brown
than it is to observe the change from gray, to light blue, to light blue.


OXYGEN ABSORBING BEER CAPS
Since live yeast is so good at absorbing oxygen (In fact, a lot of
these caps contain yeast as their active ingredient!), I can't see why
anyone would need these expensive bottle caps.  Unless, of course, they
filter out all of their yeast, force carbonate and then bottle.

Subject: Women Only Competition


I have a few questions/comments concerning this sensitive subject:
 
1. Is this merely an idea at present, or have preparations actually begun?
2. Did women brewers come up with this idea?
3. If the reasoning used to justify this type of contest is truly sound,
   then what are we to do about the other groups (e.g. blacks) who are
   even less represented in our ranks than this one?
 
Increasing the diversity of the home-brewing population is a noble cause.
If, however, the responses generated by the mere mention of a women-only
competition is any indication of the outcome, then I fear it will do more
harm than good. Furthermore, it is my sincere belief that polarization,
whether by the teaspoon or by the truckload, is wrong. Women can brew beer,
enter it in any contest, learn from their experiences, and eventually win -
just like any of God's reasoning creatures.  Everyone, regardless of race,
color, creed, national origin or gender, must compete on the same ground if
they are to gain the respect and equality they desire and deserve.
 
The less relaxed, more worried home-brewer,

Subject: London Special Ale no more


WYeast 1968, which has been called Special London Ale, is getting a new
name.  Apparently, the old name caused a lot of confusion, since they
already had a "London Ale" strain -- people wanted to know what the
difference was.


Well, the difference is that they are too completely different strains,
from different breweries.  But, at any rate, 1968 will now have a new
name: "London ESB".  Which, personally, I don't think solves anything.


Whatever the name, it is an exceptionally fine ale strain.  The only
problem I've encountered with it is a mysterious tendency for finished
bottles of beer brewed with it to disappear from the house.

Subject: Single stage v. Two stage fermentation




I have a question:


  I have been using a single stage fermentation forever, but after
following this digest for a while, it seems that the majority of people
are racking to a secondary.  I've always been told that if you are
bottling within a week or two, it doesn't make a difference which method
you use.  Is this incorrect?  Assuming you are not dry-hopping, and are
bottling within a reasonable period of time, is there an advantage to a
two stage fermentation?


Thanks,

Steve, to raise pH you need to add carbonates.  The most common source is
calcium carbonate:  chalk.  This is not always a good idea if you don't know
what's in your water already (maybe you already have lots of calcium ions,
and don't want to add more.  Get a water report from your city, and work from
there.  Miller's book has a pretty good chapter on water adjustments.  That
said, I'm not sure I'd bother with a pH around 5.0, but it will go lower with
dark grains (I'm assuming you are talking about a pale mash).

I agree completely.  I encourage everyone to at least try partial mashing,
because of the options it gives you.  You now have access to every type of
grain in the world, because you can mash what needs it, instead of just
dealing with the specialty "not-necessary-to-mash" grains.  Best of all, it
can be done with stuff around the house; a little extra equipment, and a
little extra ingenuity.

Well it seems everyone is complaing about the waste of space on HBD.
Well, only being on since sometime in November, I can tell you what I
find as a waste of space:


1. Constant requests for brewpub locations.  Can't someone keep a
master list that we all can reference?  How about an E-Mail address
where we can send names of brewpubs.


2. Sign off messages longer than some posts.  Just give us your name
and address.  Makes the HBD more manageable


3.  Requests to subscribe, unsubscribe and cancel articles.  Don't
know how this can be avoided.


4. PICTURES OF BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD.  What the hell are they doing on
the HBD?


And now to legitmize this article, I will ask a brewing related
question:  is there a FAQ of some sort or an issue of Zymurgy out
there that details the different mashing methods.  I'm an extract
brewer, and have often seen the terms infusion, decoction, double
decoction, etc.  Could anyone possibly the define these terms for the
confused like me.

I think you are stuck with pressure cooking and autoclaving as the practical
methods of sterilization.  As you know, sanitizing is not sterilizing, and
supposedly the cocci arent around long enough to spoil the beer.

I have a dedicated water heater, but I wouldnt worry too much about the tank.
The  water pulls off the top of the tank, and presumably the sediment is on 
the bottom.  You might want to flush and drain the tank if your going to use
it a lot.

Subject: Sugar Krauesen/Hopback hose?




Hi folks--


One of my batches-in-progress is a cream ale, scaled down from a recipe
in a recent _New_Brewer_. The grain/adjunct bill worked out to 12 lbs. 2-row
Klages, and 3 lbs. rice syrup for a 10 gallon batch. The OG was 1.050 and I
pitched the Wyeast Kolsh strain (used a starter, naturally).


According to the
recipe, I should ferment down to 1.010-1.014, transfer to a conditioning
vessel (in my case, 5-gal cornelius kegs), and krausen with what the author
called a sugar krausen at a volume of 10% of the fermented beer. I'm a bit
confused about the use of sugar. My understanding is that a fermented sugar
solution would result in a harsh, cidery mess, which of course I wouldn't
want to mix with my cream ale. I would like to experiment with krausening,
and follow the published recipe as close as possible. The article the recipe
comes from references some older texts that go on about how sugar krausening
"adds lusciousness" to cream ales. Once again, I am dubious, but feel
compelled to work up a 1-gallon batch of "sugar wort" (not cane sugar, but
perhaps rice syrup or dextrose), adopt a devil-may-care attitude, and see
what happens. Anyone care to throw in some advice?


Also, I'm interested in building a hopback ala Norm Pyle's description, but
I need a source for heat-resistant, brewery-safe, flexible hose. Anyone have
a lead?


Email is welcome.

I remember hearing or reading somewhere that ales are less 
suseptible to DMS primarily due to the higher kilning
temperatures of pale ale malt which ``drives off'' some of the
sulphur compounds which are precursors to DMS. Pilsener or lager
malts are generally kilned at lower temperatures and DMS is more
of a problem.

Subject: Wheat Beer, is it just the yeast?  I don't think so!


Hi!


        I have just a couple data points to add to wheat beer
discussion.  The last beer my roomate brewed (sad that it was so long
ago) was an *American Wheat*.  The recipe looks as the following:


8 lbs pale 6-row
3 lbs wheat
1 oz N. Brewer (1 hour)
1/2 oz Hallertauer (1 hour)
1/2 oz Hallertauer (10 minutes)
Nottingham Dry Ale Yeast. ????


        In this recipe, wheat made 27% of total grist.  I would note
that this beer was fermented warm (77F).  The beer was very tart and
had hints of cloves in the nose.  I have also made an *American Wheat*
(about year and a half ago) with wheat making 43% of the grist,
fermented with Nottingham dry ale yeast at cooler temperatures (62F).
This beer had the very same characteristics, tart with a hint of
clove!  I still beleive that the yeast plays the greatest role in
producing this clove character, but I believe that the wheat plays a
large role in this flavor than generally accepted in homebrew
circles.  One final note, a group of brewer's in my homebrew club did
a not so scientific study of the affects of yeast.  One yeast, EDME
dry, produced a wheaty characteristic (though the beers brewed where
not wheat beers).  Any comments?

Subject: pH and water chemistry HELP


I have a quick question concerning adjusting pH and ion content of our local 
water supply. Though we have successfully brewed many styles of ale 
(IPA-Stout) with our water (in its undoctored form - it seems that the 
buffering power of the malt has seen us through), I am still concerned that 
using our water in its "as is" form is far from the best course.  


Here is the profile of our water:


 Calcium:       91 ppm          Sulfate:        260 ppm
 Bicarbonate:   220 ppm         Sodium:         43 ppm
 Chloride:      13 ppm          Potasium:       24 ml/L
 Flouride:      0.5 ppm         Silicate:       20 ppm
 Magnesium:     41 ppm          Nitrite:        0.4 ppm
 Manganese      54 ppm          Nitrate:        0.4 ppm
        Chlorophorm 30 ppb (note parts per billion)
                        pH 7.2-7.5


(Levels of copper, Iron, Lead, Nickel, Tin, Zinc & Chlorophenols are trace)


How can we best treat our water for brewing pale ale?  The level of 
bicarbonate is quite high, and the level of calcium is not high enough to 
cause the bicarbonate and calcium to react and percipitate out during a pre 
brew boil. Can we use lactic acid to lower our bicarbonate level? (Gypsum is 
out because of our already high sulfate count)
Is the current level of sulfate problematic? 


How would this treatment change if we were brewing a brown ale or a pilsner 
(repectively)?

well... with all the 'intellectual discussion' :)  about a women-only homebrew

the concept by having exclusionist competitions for every possible minority.


How about a senior citizens only homebrew comp.   A competition open only
to the physically challenged, or a lesbian/gay only comp would create lots
of opportunities for brewers, and for PC flamers as well.  All of these
groups seem under-represented at homebrew competions I've attended.


The only real result I can see from such competitions is more people brewing

Compact models have 7500 btu on main, 6500 on aux. spaced 9 5/16  inch

The Coleman Peak 1 stoves generally put out 8500 btu. These are the single

There are Dual Fuel versions of all these that burn Coleman fuel and car

Text item: Text_1


     Some of you may remember my post awhile back regarding Rhinoceros 
     Stout that was (note, I said was) available at he Oakhills Brewpub 
     here in Portland.  They have stopped brewing it for now but have 
     assured me that it would be back.  Anyway, I was able to get the 
     recipe and want to give it a try.  The problem is that the recipe 
     is for a 220 gallon batch.  I was told that the yeast used is a 
     special yeast made up by Wyeast for McMenamins Pubs and that the 
     same yeast is used for all their beers. Although I find that hard 
     to believe.
     
     Here are the ingredients for a 220 gal. batch.
     
     Malts
     ----------------------------
     1.) 300 lbs. - 2-Row
     2.)  30 lbs. - Vienna
     3.)  25 lbs. - Victory
     4.)  25 lbs. - Black Barley
     5.)  25 lbs. - Hugh Baird Brown 
     
     Hops
     ----------------------------
     1.) 1.5 lbs. - Cent (?)
     2.)  .5 lbs. - Cent (Finishing)
     
     My questions are:
     1.   How do I extrapolate this for a five gallon batch?
     2.   Does anyone out there in brewland have a phone number/contact  
          at Wyeast?
     3.   What is the best way to gather yeast from the bottom of a      
          container? (Which is what I might have to do should phone call 
          fail.)
     4.   What is meant by Cent.?
     
     Any help from the HBD Brewmeisters will be greatly appreciated and 
     final results will be posted.  This stout is one of the finest I 
     have ever tasted.  It ranks right up there with (please God don't 
     strike this fine Irish head dead) Guinness Stout!

1)  Following the trend on cookers,  if you check Sams Club (usual
disclaimer), you will often find not only the cajun cookes but another crab
cooker version about 35,000 btu.  They run around $75.00, and come
complete with a 7 gal pot (alum) for about $100.00.  Many propane
stores have 35,000 btu hobs for about $30.00 or so.  Simply connect to a
20#er and you are brewing cheap.


2)  By using a piece of 4" PVC pipe about two foot long, 40' of copper
tube 3/8" in diameter, some RTV-11 sealant and a couple of reducers
from a 4" down to PVC garden hose fittings you can make a chiller for
not too much.  On the output side go from the copper up to threaded
fittings and into a regular cartridge water filter.  You can easily remove
trub, excess yeast and hops.  Get the cheap wound filter to do this
cheap.  The PVC then necks down from 4" to 2" then 2" to 3/3" then to
the garden hose adapter.  I bought the stuff at a hardware center and
put it together in about a half hour.


3)  A comment:  I don't know what all the fuss is about women in
brewing etc.  In England in times past the women were expected to be
expert homebrew persons.  That was considered part of housekeeping. 
I really wish my wife would have picked up the interest or skills
necessary.  However, I do 99% of the cooking and the brewing.  Did I
miss somthing ?  I tried to get her interested in the womens contest
(answer)  <thats your job>  ......  Chill out and enjoy and lets get on to
more of the type of conversations that will make us all better brewers.
Like who believes that you can increase the sweetness and malt
character of an all grain brew by increasing the temp to about 70C and
shortening the mash time which would favor alpha enzymes?????

I have been thinking about the process of yeast-driven in-the-bottle
carbonation and wondering about the various techniques.  It seems
the common practice is to use corn sugar but that some use 
DME or even wort.  
I am surprised that otherwise fanatical brewers would "adulterate"
their beer in the final step with corn sugar - or do the benefits
outweigh the problems.  I though it might be interesting to bottle
a solution corresponding to the dilution of 3/4 cup corn sugar in
five gallons of water with a little yeast and let the water carbonate
and then taste it.  This might give an indication of the contribution
of any corn sugar based flavors to the beer.  Or am I all wet?


What do the commercial world class bottle conditioned beers do to
get their carbonation?  Thanks in advance.
