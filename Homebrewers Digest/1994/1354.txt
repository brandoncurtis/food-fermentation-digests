Multiply by 5/220.  Taste it and find what ingredients did not make
the extrapolation due to your brewing equipment geometry.  Adjust
quantities and brew it again, and again, and again.  I was able to
duplicate a 300 gal. recipe scaled down to 5 gal. on the first try. 


You must also be aware of the OG, not just the ingredients.  I knew
that the OG on that beer was 1050 to 1055 and then I could assess how
well the mathematical extrapolation worked by knowing how much grain
it takes *my* mash tun to produce that OG.  It happened to just be

Subject: Calcium maximum?


In several recent posts people have expressed concern over bringing their
calcium levels too high.  Is this really a concern?  Obviously there is some
level that is too high, but would this ever really be reached?  It would
seem that by adding CaCO3 or CaSO4 the anion would always be of the most
concern in terms of having too much.  


Is 200 ppm of Ca too much?  Why?  It would seem that with the CO3, PO4,
and the organic malt components such as phytate, excess Ca would just
precipitate.  Is there a danger of depleting the wort of the nutrient
PO4?  


Lots of questions, who has some answers?

I am planning a trip to the New England states and would like to
know of any good brewpubs in the area.  We will be stopping the first night
at Sturbridge, Mass.. The remainder of the week our headquarters will be near
Lake Winnepesaukee in New Hampshire.  We will most likely be taking day trips
into Maine and Vermont.
Here's the catch:  a three-year-old, and a six-month-old.  I have never been
to a brewpub, but all this talk about them makes me want to experience a few.
 If brewpubs are "no place to take a family", would they at least have

Subject: backpack brew


Bob 'The Backpacking Tech Weenie' Talkiewicz's post got me thinking again
about the idea of brewing in the wilderness.  I'm trying to come up with
a practical rig that isn't too heavy.  So far, its :


1) regular backpack stove and cookset (SS)
2) 2 liter plastic soda bottles for fermentation / bottling
3) assorted other misc small light stuff : airlocks, hop bags, etc.


The batch size would be about 2 liters.  (Hmmmm... if my local multi barrel
batch commercial establishment is a "microbrewery", then my setup at home
must be a picobrewery.  Is this backpack rig a "femptobrewery" ?)  Depending
on where you go, cooling may or may not be a problem.  This method probably
isn't practical unless you have a cold stream, snowpack or glacier nearby.


I think that the biggest problem with the backpack brew is that it takes
2 weeks minimum to mature.  Not a problem if you have that much time and 
plan to stay at or near one place the whole time, but a big problem if
you're on the move alot.


It might be workable for two trips to the same place : beginning of first
trip for brewing.  End of trip for racking to bottles.  Retrieval and 
enjoyment on 2nd trip !  You just have to hope that the bears don't like
Pale Ale.  The small batch size is a minor hassle.  It shouldn't take
much more than an hour and a half from start to pitch.


Any thoughts on this slightly deranged idea ?  Or should I just forget it
and lug cans of Weinhards down the trail ?

Subject: extract tang/maple ferment


Well I finally found a Cyberspace Suit, so I thought I'd post a couple
of questions.
 
Has there ever been an analysis of the "Extract Tang" flavor?  I.E.
What exactly is it, what causes it to be stonger in some extracts
than others, what causes it in the first place and what procedures
minimizes it appearance?  I brew all grain, and have eliminated it
from my brews that way.
 
Is there a name for fermented Maple Syrup and water.  I made a test
batch, with dry lager yeast, at lager temperatures.  Talk about an
interesting complex flavor!  The stuff hasn't cleared yet but it has
been lagering at 34F for 3 weeks.  The recipe is simple, 1 qt syrup to
3 qts water.  Pasturize covered, at 170F for 30 minutes.  SG 1.095
Haven't taken a gravity reading since, as I don't want to waste the
experiment.  I call it "Maple What?"

I've been using an awful lot of these plugs (made by Morris Hanbury) and
have only run across one case where the hops in a package were in bad shape.
You were correct in returing the hops to the supplier and no doubt your
supplier got a refund as well.  I just wanted to mention that my luck with
these hops has been very good and that the occurance of a bad package (in my
experience) has been quite rare.

A test done by George Fix and his associates a number of years ago
showed that not all the O2 in the headspace was used up by the yeast.
The tests showed that after a few weeks, 30% of the air remained in the
headspace and that the O2 fraction in 40% of the air reacted with beer
constituents.  They concluded that the yeast consumed the remaining 30%.
This was dextrose-primed, bottle conditioned beer and Dr. Fix mentioned
that he did not know if tests such as this had been repeated using
wort primes.


Why is the priming important?  Because with sufficiently high concentrations
of glucose (dextrose) and fructose, yeast will forgo respiratory growth
and just perform anaerobic fermentation (this is known as the Crabtree
effect).  It is also notable that with sufficient levels of O2 in solution,
the opposite effect can occur (the Pasteur effect) in which the yeast are
forced out of anaerobic fermentation and back into respiratory growth.


Also, there was a side-by-side test done a while ago by The Chicago
Beer Society in which a batch was split between "Smartcaps" (aka "PureSeal")
and regular caps.  The "Smartcap" beers had a better hop aroma.


A number of micros have adopted the use of PureSeal caps and I'm sure they
did not do so without good reason.  I use PureSeal caps exclusively.


One last point: PureSeal caps are activated by moisture.  When I get mine
(by the case) I immediately put them in HDPE buckets with gasketted lids
and insert a dessicant.  When I package them, I use 6-mil, HDPE (vapor-
barrier) packages and heat seal them, vacuuming out a reasonable amount
of air (too much vacuum and the caps poke through the bag).  If your
supplier is selling them in paper hags or storing the full cases "in the
back somewhere" they could be shot by the time you buy them.  Also if
you use boiling water to sanitize them, don't waste your money.  I've
spoken with the lead engineer for these PureSeal caps and he said that
boiling makes the caps useless for absorbing O2.  He said to use 200ppm
bleach for sanitizing them.


******
Mike asks for a conversion from dry extract to syrup.


The syrup is roughly 20% water (i.e. 80% extract), so use 25% more syrup
in place of the same amount of dry extract by weight.

That's exactly why I went back to dextrose, but don't worry about the
effects of 3/4 or 1/2 cup dextrose in a beer that had 5 to 12 pounds
of other fermentables in it.  It's such a small percentage of the
fermentables, that it's effects are untasteable, in my experience.

COPPER:
SO...noone else out there has had any problems with copper oxides?
Or has any knowledge of them?  No metallurgists/chemist amongst us?


I had complained (whaah) about the sparger portion of my copper manifold 
darkening, and oxidizing, while copper under the mash remains shiny.


NOBODY offered any similar incidence, or advice.  Hmmmm. Am I truly
the only one who's ever had such a problem? I feel so scpecial. (lisp)


I haven't yet tried the vinegar rinse prior to use, but maybe soon.


My next plan is to construct a metal racking cane from copper to pull
my hot sparge water right out of the pot on the stove next to my cooler/tun.
Hopefully this unit will not also suffer the oxidation situation!
My plastic racking cane just wasn't up for the task!  floppeeeeee.


Question: Anyone have a good method for bending tubing w/o buying 
a proper bending "tool". I believe anything that works and is right on hand 
(or really cheap) is the right tool for any job!


* another thought about metal:
I have a LARGE cast aluminum boiling pot. It works well, and was a GREAT
bargain.  I make a point of NOT scrubbing the oxides, and carmelized
schtuff from the sides. Just chunks. If you've ever used steel wool on
Aluminum you know that it removes a layer (silver brown haze runs off in 
the water).   I know stainless is preferred. Easier to clean, not as good
at heat transfer, MORE expensive.


My Theory:
 Leave a layer of protective oxidized aluminum on the surface of the pot.
Aluminum is quite reactive, and oxidizes quickly, but once oxidized it
is rather unreactive. Therefore safer (even tho the Alzheimer's connection
didn't pan out) for brewing use.  And I don't mind having a brown layer
left on the surface.
                 Any thoughts, theories, ...facts?....

A commercial Question:  
    I ordered some hops and stuff from Alpha Hops in washington. I was 
very pleased with the prices and happy with the quality of the goods.
I ordered a number of pounds of hops and shared the wealth with friends.


One guy sed he didn't care for the hops, that they were too dry and
wouldn't want to get anymore.


Personally: I thought the hops were in very good condition. Green,
intact cones (not FLAKES), almost no crystal sediment at the bottom of
bags (a sign to ME of mishandling- roughness), had some vine stems- but
that don't bother me.  My understanding is that hops are SUPPOSED to be 
dry for proper storage. The only wet hops I've ever seen were picked from
my own vines!


More importantly - the crystals are yellow, not orange, and smell nice
and spicey, not rancid/sour.  I get a thrill everytime I fondle them!


I also received nice data sheets on each variety, alpha,beta, oils...BUT
it didn't say what year the harvest was.  I assume 92-93. I should call.


SO...the question... has anyone else had experience with AlphaHops' hops?
What are your impressions? Do you know when harvest was?  E-mail is good.

Subject: Queen of Controversies


I am the Secretary to Gold Country Brewers Association, co-sponsor of the 
Queen of Beer Competition.


Though controversial, the competition has been getting more publicity 
than was expected, and we are grateful for that.  But before this 
competition becomes legendary before it has begun, I'd like to try to 
answer some of the questions.


If you are turned off by the "women only" aspect, then do not participate 
in the contest.  Simply, without entries, there cannot be a contest, and 
you need not read further.  The simple fact that the contest has been 
flamed, gives hope that there will be few "ghost brewing" sessions 
by men to try to usurp entry.


The contest is a reality, and will be held April, 16th, 1994.  Entry info 
and addresses have been published before.


The actual planners and originators of this contest are women.  Beth 
Sangeri of H.A.Z.E. in Placerville, CA and Donna Bettencourt, President 
of Gold Country Brewers, are the principals.


The idea is prompted from the fact that when Beth tried to ask some 
questions about brewing to a group of male brewers, the advice she was 
given started "What your Husband should do..."  She is an experienced 
brewer with some awards.


Donna recently won a ribbon in Porter for the AHA club only competition.


The two have noted a general lack of other women in brewing.  Both 
admitted to being inspired to improve their brewing by Nancy Vinyard's 
Homebrewer of the year award.  Both feel that that there should be 
simpler ways for other women to be inspired to brew than winning top 
national honors.  


As for exclusivity, this is not an AHA sanctioned event, so there are no 
club or personal points at stake.  The Grateful Deaf have organized a 
very successful competition and gala for a number of years, with the 
spotlight on deaf/hearing impared homebrewers.  AHA club only 
competitions are restricted to a much smaller percentage of homebrewers 
than a women only competition.  Likewise, most AHA competitions are 
restricted to those who only use a particular bottle size, completely 
ignoring those who use large or innovative bottle styles, or keg.


Point is, exclusivity is nothing new to homebrewing.


IF this competition is succesful, it will spotlight diversity in 
homebrewing, not polarization.  At any rate, this competition will 
happen.

In HBD #1350 Bryan asked about adding ginger.  I used 2oz of freshly

nice but my SO (also a brewer) said that it overpowered everything else
after about 1 month of conditioning.  As a caveat; she does not like
ginger overmuch.  I would see no problem with adding more ginger, but only if
you like ginger (a lot).

Subject: Wyeast 2308 odors


My recent starter for this yeast (Munich lager) produced a faint sulfury
smell, SO2 like.
I just racked my Pale Bock into secondary after an active 10 day primary
ferment at 47 F. I've noticed that faint odor again.
Now it is diacetyl rest time and I wonder if this sulfury aroma will be blown
out .
I've used this yeast twice before with good results. Plus I've never had
contamination problems(famous last words maybe?)
HOw about some feedback...

I have been using the Hoplet plugs for the last several batches and have found
them to be quite good.   However, I have recently had  bad experience
with Styrian and Kent Goldings and Fuggles.  When I opened the package
they smelled very cheesy and were yellow.  I decided not to use them in
my dry hop and will be bringing them back to my supplier.
 
Anyone else have this experience?

JW,
     I too have used the Morris Hanbury hop plugs, and have been GREATLY
impressed overall.  However, I was at a local shop today and happened to
see one of the workers re-packaging 5 oz. packs of plugs into 2 oz. packs
when I immediately noticed that something was very wrong. The hops were
yellow-orange and had expanded slightly. The hops, English Fuggles, were
obviously very old, oxidized, and unsuitable for making anything but
cheesy-tasting swill.  These hops were also "dealer fresh" - they hadn't
been laying around.  Obviously someone across the ocean is trying to unload
a bunch of old stock on us ignorant yankees. I strongly urge anybody buying
these hops to demand a look under the hood before purchasing. I would also
encourage home-brew shops to send them back to Crosby & Baker and tell them
to look into the problem.  I have purchased Fuggle and Golding plugs which
were outstanding, so I know this is something which can be prevented, and
should not be tolerated.

Hi All!


I have a question about a Bohemian Pilsner I'm brewing.  Here's the
recipe:


3.3 lbs. Northwestern Gold ME
4.0 lbs. Alexander's Pale ME
2.0 oz. Saaz plugs (60 minutes-bittering)
1.0 oz. Saaz plugs (30 minutes-flavor)
1.0 oz. Saaz plugs (2 minutes-aroma)
1/2 oz Saaz plugs (dry hop)


Wyeast Bohemian Yeast directly from the pack(no starter)


I  boiled the extract, 1 1/2 gallons water and hops as indicated in
the recipe for one hour.  Added everything by siphoning into a plastic
water jug with 3 gallons cold water.  Topped off with cold water.
Waited for everything to drop to 65 and pitched the yeast.  I let the
stuff sit at around 65 for 1 day and then placed it in the back room
of my basement where it sits at a nice 45 all day and night.


I racked to a secondary after 12 days (glass carboy) and dry hopped.
It's been in the secondary for two days now and I took a SG reading
and got 1.013.  I had completely forgotten to take an OG reading, but
looking at other Pilsner recipies, it seems 1.021 is a common final
gravity.  Well, I tasted the stuff in the carboy.  It's REALLY SWEET,
as compared to most brews I've had, and color is a dark gold.


Should my beer be this sweet?  Is everything ok?  E-Mail replies
please, no need to waste bandwith.

I just got the 1994 catalog from Superior Products and there are a
couple of items in there that I thought might be of interest:


pg 30: 10 gal Coleman water coolers
       1-C-310 Red      $33.50
       1-C-312 Blue     $33.50


       I assume that the geometry & materials are like the 10 gal. draft
       boxes they show under the same heading.  If this is the case,
       they are plastic, upright coolers.


pg 43: James Page Brewing Kits: "Specially formulated for taste, quality
       and ease of brewing by the award winning James Page microbrewery
       in St. Paul, MN" (Frankly, I've never heard of them.)  The kits
       contain 6# of hopped malt extract, aroma hops and yeast.  The
       exception is the American Lager which has 4.5# malt and 1.5# corn
       syrup.  They have Burton Pale Ale, Midlands Brown Ale, Bavarian
       Dark, Amber Maerzen, American Lager, Continental Pilsner & Wheat
       (65% wheat malt, 35% barley malt).


       3-J-241          $16.95


I have not ordered or seen either of these products, I am just a
satisfied customer and I thought others might like to check it out.


Their catalog is free, they take MC & Visa, no minimum order.

Subject: Brewpub Requests


1)  There is a very nice brewpub list available on sierra.stanford.edu, 
called "publist".  If I am not mistaken, John Mellby maintains this list
and periodically sends in the update.  It is a very good resource.


2)  There is also a need for reviews from local people.  I often find 
myself needing help for a) what is near to where I will be staying and 
b) what kind of places the brewpubs are.  For instance, I am 
geographically ignorant and did not know that LaJolla was near SanDiego,
CA, and would have missed many brewpubs near that area without help from
locals.  Also, some brewpubs I brought my kids to and others I went to 
myself based upon recommendations by locals again.


So, I personally think that posting a "I read the 'publist' and would 
like additional information on brewpubs in XXXXX, please respond by 
e-mail" is appropriate to the HBD.  Replies are probably *not* 
appropriate in the HBD.

Also, even though I suppose I should just be grateful if my first batch
turns out to be edible, could anyone suggest a particular malt extract

my first batch will be an ale, I would like to do something along the lines

Subject: bitter brew


          Trouble in River City
          Okay, my last ale came out horribly bitter. I mean, I can 
          hardly drink it (well--okay--I have to drink it fast). Four 
          variables in this batch: 1) I used a plastic carboy for the 
          first time; 2) I tried a different mash, mentioned in HBD 
          for American 2-row, a low temp (135?) and then a high time 
          (160?) (sorry, don't have my receipe book at work). This was 
          supposed to produce better extraction (and I think it did). 
          3) I used Tettnanger hops for the first time ever, both boil 
          and finish. 4)cold winter made me brew it cool ~58-62, with 
          Canadian Ale yeast (Yeast Lab liquid, forgot the #) and I 
          had a long, long ferment.
          
          Question: Which of the four is the most likely culprit? A 
          combo of all? Maybe an airborne bug, instead? I am 
          particularly concerned about the mash technique. The HBD 
          thread (sorry, can't remember the author's name) said the 
          conventional temps were all wrong for American 2-row (I used 
          pale Klages), and these new temps were right. If this is 
          producing the excessive bitterness, however, I'll never do 
          it again!

Subject: HSA question


I'm an extract/specialty grain brewer using Charlie's method of pouring
hot wort thru the strainer into a carboy of cold water.  I haven't 
_noticied_ any HSA problems as described here, but want to see if taking
extra care improves the beer - I'm concerned that cooling in an ice bath
or some such might cool the concentrated wort too much, so that when mixed
with (very cold Minnesota tap) water, it'll be too cold for pitching.
Straining the hot wort into the carboy makes instant perfect pitching temp!


My questions are: would siphoning the hot wort into the carboy (with a
copper scrubby on the end to catch hops/grains) still cause HSA? For my
setup, is it straining the hot wort (thus exposing it to oxygen) that
causes HSA, having hot wort contact cold (and oxygen laden) water, or
a combination of both?  If siphoning will not eliminate the problem, will
it produce a noticiable difference?


I know this is on the FAQ edge, but I haven't seen this addressd directly.
Private email is fine if not of general interest - I'll summarize posts

I have an easy solution that works extremely well for creating a sweet
mead. Use sherry yeast. I have a six year old prickly pear
fruit(15lbs) & mesquite honey(20lbs) 5 gallon mead that is still
wonderfully sweet, aromatic and very alcoholic. To put it bluntly,
it IS the nectar of the gods! I will be entering this in the AHA
nationals this year so watch out! Whenever I serve it - which is
very rarely(that's how you make 5 gallons last six years so far
and I still have half of it left) I get rave reviews. I'm going
to hate having to sacrifice possibly 3 bottles for the competition.


I can't emphasize enough, that the type of yeast that you use for
fermenting any beverage will have one of THE greatest effects
on the final overall character. Get into liquid yeasts and culturing,
you'll never regret it!

I think the original poster meant, (or should have meant) non-denatured
ethanol.  It is pure ethanol (at least before exposing it to moisture), and
does not contain anything poisonous.  It too is cheap ( < 3.00 per pint)
and is not taxed if for research purposes.  Instead of tax there is just a
bunch of paperwork to fill out.  Unfortunately it may be hard to get ahold

Subject: those uppity wimmin brewers




Sigh.


I had promised myself to stay out of this one for the sake of preserving the 
sacred bandwidth.  Alas, I cannot.


First of all, I would ask anyone who still thinks a women-only brewing 
competition is a bad thing to read Cathy Cullen's post in HBD1352, or if you 
did already, read it again.  Then skip down to "jerryb" 's post about humor, 
something which we really do need a little more of around here.


Is brewing largely a "guy thing" as Cathy suggests?  Very probably.  We would 
like to think that the homebrewing community is more enlightened than the 
rest of the world, but let's not get too prideful here.  In the same HBD 
there was that incredibly tacky, unnecessary signature with, what was it? - 
"If I have to die, let me die between your breasts," or something like that.  
As I recall, it was attached to a mis-directed (in more ways than one) 
request to unsubscribe.  Good.  


At any rate, let me advance the notion that the homebrewing world is not as 
totally disconnected from the beer world as we would like to pretend.  How 
many beer commercials have managed to desensitize us to the objectification 
of women for the purpose of selling a product?  You know, the bimbos-in-
bikinis numbers with the guys ogling admiringly while apparently swilling 
some Budmillob.  Beer a guy thing?  Homebrewers may say no, but Madison 
Avenue has a different idea and they have a lot more influence over what 
folks think than anybody on the HBD.


But the issue really is competitions, I suppose and whether all should be 
open.  I don't do competitions myself, but I have noticed that there really 
is no shortage of them.  For me at least, there is no sacred principle that 
is being violated by one all-women competition - whose purpose is, as Cathy 
points out, not to exclude men but to ENCOURAGE women in a field in which 
they are under-represented - when there are two or three zillion other 
competitions in which I could enter my beer.  Is it the start of an 
unwholesome, un-American, neo-fascist trend?  Will we all be drinking Amazon 
Bud by the year 2000?  Come on, y'all - lighten up.
