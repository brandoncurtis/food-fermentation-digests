The grassyness could be from stale grain, certain types of bacterial
infections (which could also make the brew cloudy) or from stale hops.
The cloudy sparge implies that perhaps you sparged too hot -- too hot
a sparge (too much over 170F) will liberate unconverted starch from the
grain.  If indeed the cloudy sparge was from too hot a sparge water,
then the beer too has a starch haze.

I fear that if your hop utilization formula will have a similar complexity
to your hop freshness formulas, then nobody will use them.  I agree with
Dave Miller that the errors in the formulas can add up, but disagree that
the result is a useless number.  As you later wrote, you need to get into
the ballpark and then adjust based upon your system.  I've simply been using
Ragers numbers, adding 10% if I use whole hops and 10% more if I use a
hop bag (which is always) and the bitterness comes out just as I expect
it to.  All this with a variety of yeasts, hop varieties, and a few other
variables.  Constants were: the hop bags. the kettle geometry, the burner,
the fermenter geometry, grain supplier and virtually all of my procedures.

Then why supply a complicated formula in this illusive book you keep

You're missing a little physics, which is not particulary intuitive.  You
are putting your thumb over the wrong end.  Actually, I don't recommend
you use your thumb at all -- use a pinch-type hose clamp to shut off the
"out" end of the sanitized hose, filled with water and then dip the
other end (a racking cane helps keep the hose at the bottom without
sucking up yeast) into the carboy.  Keep the "out" end lower than
the level of the beer in the "in" vessel and open the clamp.

I've never quite understood the benefits of lagering until I 
finally did a bock.  It had all kinds of off aromas and flavors
for 3.5 months in the bottle (at 40F) and then finally at 4
months, everything came together into a wonderful beer.  I don't
know how lagering an ale will change it's flavor -- I've never
tried making an Alt or a Koelsch, but I suggest you start
lagering it and see how the flavor changes.  Even if I knew
how the flavor would change, I'll bet I could not put it into
words. 


1007 is actually a Koelsch yeast and will give you a much drier
beer than a true Alt.  I've long thought that 1007 (German Ale) was
an Alt yeast until Roger Deschner pointed out that it is actually
a Koelsch yeast quite recently.  Alts are supposed to be much 
sweeter and maltier than the 1007 will allow -- Wyeast European
Ale (#1338) is an Alt yeast.

Oh yes.  Feedback, I believe, is the best reason for entering a competition,
not ribbons.  You will always get your scoresheets back from a reputably
run AHA Sanctioned competition and probably from 99.9% of the non-AHA
Sanctioned ones too.

An 8 gallon kettle is just about the minimum size for a 5 gallon batch.  You

An enameled pot can be used and I've seen 8 gallon ones reasonably priced,
but don't use the handles to lift it when full!!!!  You can use an electric
stove, but your brew day will be much longer than if you had a hotter heat
source.  I used electric heat up until two years ago and it just takes much

Any food-grade plastic container will work, but you want to insulate it
somehow so it doesn't loose too much heat during the mash.

Subject: Unsmacked Wyeast


Does anyone remember a post or short thread about using Wyeast "unsmacked"?
Just cut the poach open and inoculate your starter.  Does anyone do this?


One of ZGI's resident yeast experts plated a smacked pack of 1028 a while
back (couple months) and it came up with substantial contamination with
some sort of chained coccus (unless it's E.Coli we're pretty weak in
bacteria. Guesses are welcome).  Chris is convinced the contamination is
real and not a lab problem.  I have high regard for his opinion and lab
skills and believe him.  Anyone else done/found/suspect the same? 


The question then arises, was it the Wyeast culture or the wort?  And that
is the reason for the opening question.

Don't ask me why the 52 quart cost less than the 10 gallon.  I don't

Subject: BrewPubs in America - THE LIST




Hey people!  I have been reading this list for about a month now and I have
some general comments to share:


1.   I think that all of the talk about finding brewpubs to visit (or plan a
trip arond) is SILLY.  Most cyberspace people are from universities.  This
implies that there are LIBRARIES close at hand.  Well, I did everyone's
homework.  Get over to the library and find the "The Brewer's Digest."  This is
the trade magazine for the brewing industry.  Every year they publish a
complete listing of breweries and brewpubs listed by state.  They also list
ALL BEERS brewed in the US and abroad.  The October 1993 issue has a great
article on hops that everyone will find interesting.
2.  What is the crime for fermenting in plastic buckets?  I do and I get
excellent results.  They are easy to store and clean.  It seems that there are
a lot of people who don't like plastic buckets.  I would like to see some
posting for this reason.  Beware!  I am a chemist and I firmly don't believe
a plastic surface that is between 1 and 2 mm thick can transport any detectable
amount of oxygen.  In fact, I am planning to start brewing in 16 and 24 oz.
plastic Coke bottles.  Any feeling on either of these two plastic subjects?

Subject: ginger


Just to reassure folks who like ginger but might be timorous about adding
too much to a beer...


We experimented a lot in years gone by.  For an amber ale, we did various
batches in the range of a few up to 12 oz of fresh ginger root for a five-
gallon batch, eventually settling on 8-10 oz depending on the strength of
the ale.  The higher end (12 oz) wasn't "too much" ginger; it just didn't
balance with the body of the ale.


We put a full pound in a mead (OG effectively just under 1.100) and we
didn't feel it was too much.  It did take a couple months to settle down
from "startling" to "intriguing".  It's a ginger-lover's drink, and an
excellent companion to Hunan-style food.


My only caution is that these quantities are for folks who *like* ginger.

My thoughts on replicating Newcy Brown: aim for sweetness (FG of 10-15) and
moderate bitterness (ie, a non brown ale amount of Northern Brewer). Other
essential ingredients: a high diacetyl yeast, at least 1 lb of brown sugar, and
caramel to achieve the desired colour. Happy hangover :-)

Milhous Irish Alt


Ingredients (for 5 gallons)


8 pounds, Mountmellick Irish unhopped amber malt extract
1 oz, Bullion hop pellets (7.6 alpha)
2 oz, Mount Hood pellets (3.9 alpha) (1 oz boil, 1 oz finish)
1/3 cup, chocolate malt (cracked)
1/8 cup, bulk patent malt (cracked)
3/4 cup, crystal malt (cracked)
2 pkgs, Muton and Fison ale yeast (7g each)
3/4 cup, corn sugar (to bottle)


Procedure


Add cracked grains to 3 gallons of cold water and heat. Once
boiling, remove grains. Add extract and all but 1 oz of Mount
Hood hops and boil for 1 hour. Add 1 oz Mount Hood hops during
the last 10 minutes of the boil. Combine with cold water to
make 5 gallons, cool and pitch yeast at 75 degrees. Ferment
until completion and bottle with corn sugar.


Comments


This was modeled after my Milhous Alt, but I couldn't find
any Ireks extract. It turned out with a thicker taste due to
the higher volume of extract and with an unique taste. Besides,
I wanted to blend the german alt style with the irish to match
my own ethnic background.

This was modeled after a Goldenflower Ale recipe from "The

This was my second batch of homebrew and really turned out
well.  It had a very hoppy flavor with just the right bitterness
for my taste.  The cracked grains led to a nice copper color.
Some drinkers compared it to Washington DC's Old Heurich.
For my next batch, I plan to reserve some of the hops and add
them during the last 5 minutes of the boil or dry hopping.

I usually add 1/4 cup of molasses to my English style ales and it
adds a very distinct yet suttle flavor. I would not recommend
adding a larger amount since the flavor would be overwhelming
and I doubt very much that you would enjoy it. You can even
detect 1/4 cup in a strong stout if you know what residual
flavors molasses leaves in a fermented ale. So if you want to
play with molasses I'ld recommend trying it in 1/4 cup increments
in several batches.

I recall from a recent judging study session that this is mowed-lawn flavor 
is one of the Higher Molecular Alcohols (HMAs).  Yeah, it could be one of 
the many weird hop produced compounds.


Excessive or incorrect HMAs are typically caused by too high a fermentation 
temperature.  Yes, ales have HMAs in them normally, because they combine 
with fatty acids to produce esters.  But too high a temp will cause this 
sort of thing.

Joel Teague - all I can say is quit rubbing it in!  OK, I can say more.  A
while ago someone posted and received replies on building the ultimate
brewery in his basement.  Of course, he's probably down there brewing now
instead of reading the HBD.  Good luck on this venture.  This could be more
fun than...eating chocolate.

Laura Conrad makes some good points about brewing books being too technical,
but I'd like to discuss some of her arguments.  First of all, there are loads
of people out there who can't seem to manage understanding a cookbook.  So
the cookbook writers have chosen to assume a level of technical knowledge
above this group of people.  You have to draw the line somewhere.  Many of
the writers of brewing books have built nice, complex, interesting breweries
and they therefore probably qualify as techno-weenies (I fit in here
somewhere, on the low end of this group).  Anyway, techno-weenies aren't
likely to be very good at writing for the masses; its just they way they are.


Also, I believe that brewing beer is a more complex process than baking
bread (sourdough excepted), therefore requires a more difficult procedure.
I'm talking about making all-grain beer vs. bread from scratch.


Baking bread requires you to grind grain, mix with water (at a very rough
temperature range - i.e. warm) and yeast (the yeast type and bacteria
count/type are not critical because of the short time the yeast is allowed
to work - less than 2 hours), let it rise, punch it down, let it rise, and
bake.  Brewing beer requires you to grind grain, mix with water (at a much
more precise temperature +- about 10F), let it sit, rinse with water, boil,
add hops, cool, add yeast (the yeast type and bacteria count/type are crucial
because the yeast will work for weeks), let it ferment, move it to a serving
container, and carbonate it.  Now I'm sure I've insulted some bread lovers
out there but I think it is clear that brewing beer is not a simple process.
The steps I describe are the most basic steps for making a simple beer.
Better beer requires more attention to detail and a more complex procedure.
My point is that brewing beer requires a certain level of technical
knowledge, and to do it right, which is what the homebrew book writers
intend, you either need to have this knowledge or gain this knowledge through
some reading.  One more thing, measuring SG via the boiling point of the
liquid is impractical from a time standpoint and would make an interesting
chart when you include elevation, as the cookbooks usually do.  Please don't
take this as a diatribe; it is meant as a polite disagreement..

Subject: Non Technical Brewing


Laura Conrad suggests a cookbook-style brewing book.  Laura, I have a
comment on that, "YES!!!"


Actually, I would guess that a large segment of the brewing population
takes a decidedly non-technical approach to making good beer.  I would also
guess that the segment represented by HBD is badly skewed toward AR techno-
nerds who routinely worry about insignificant digits.


Personally, the last time I used my hydrometer was about three years ago
and I don't miss it a bit.  My approach to beer is similar to my approach
to spaghetti sauce (I recommend omitting the tomatoes for the beer, though).


Write the book, Laura.  I'll buy it.

Subject: Cooking vs Rocket Science


Laura Conrad suggests a "how to brew" book that sticks to well-known
cooking terminology.  Overall, it's a good idea.  I try to treat my own
brewing more like cooking than biochemistry, and people have brewed for
hundreds of years without any scientific schooling, hydrometers, or even
decent thermometers.


However, a good cookbook will provide all the tips and tricks it can to
increase the beginner's (and the pro's) chances of success.  I, for one,
would not encourage a beginner to brew without a hydrometer.  It's no
more difficult to use than a thermometer, and can help avoid mistakes
with serious consequences ("Case of homebrew explodes, destroying half
of downtown Newbyville.  Film at eleven.").


Much of the technical info on the digest, and in books, could be skipped
for the first-time brewer (water chemistry, etc.).  Procedures could be
simplified (like my first all-grain batch!).  In fact, how many times
have you seen people post "I've read Papazian, Miller, et al and am
still confused"?  I'd say there's room in the market for another "how to
brew" book :-).  But I wouldn't avoid the "scientific" techniques
entirely, intimidating as they may be.


The scientific mindset was probably fostered by the growth of
mega-breweries in the last century and by a certain Danish biologist.
This led to the high-quality, consistent products that most of us are
used to drinking and want to duplicate; a little science can go a long
way to helping the homebrewer achieve that same quality.

P.S.  I think there are some other non-technical factors that make
brewing intimidating.  One is batch size -- 5 gal is a lot of anything
to make at once, unless you have a family of 20.  Another is expense --
an all-malt extract batch can cost $30, a not insignificant sum if it's
undrinkable.  No wonder people worry about getting it right!

Subject: long-lived liquid yeast


Last winter (1993) I purchased a package of WYeast American Lager Yeast
(dated 1 January). I never got around to using it before the basement warmed
up to ale temperatures, so it remained at the back of the fridge. Last month
I decided to see if it was still viable. Recalling past posts that refrigerated
yeast could last a few months, I had low expectations. Nevertheless, within a
week of popping the package, it had swollen to full size. The solution is now
bubbling away in a starter.


Moral: some liquid yeast can survive 13 months under refrigerated conditions.

Heres the thread,

thing I went with epoxy cuz the hole I drill didn't look to pretty. It took
HOURS and I went through almost 4 fully charged packs on my 12V Makita.
Stainless is definitely TOUGH SHIT to drill....


>I have heard this before, but I have found SS to be as easy to drill as

What's the story here?  Metallurgists speak!  (please).


Mr. Metallurgist says:         :^)
I really don't know why it was so hard for Rick to drill his keg. 300 series
stainless should be easy to drill unless its galling (sticking/gumming up). I
have a feeling that the problem was the Mikita Drill speed. It may have been
too slow or the (new) bit was dull. If it was too slow, it may not have been
able to bite in and lift a chip.  If the speed was too fast, without enough
pressure to bite in, the stainless would heat up and start galling, coating 
end of the bit with metal that would prevent it from cutting.
***
I can't find the post, but someone mentioned using a big aluminum pot without
cleaning off the inside oxidised layer.  If you were making stew, I would say
go ahead, because that "seasoned layer" as its called prevents food from
sticking. However, I would wonder what old food flavors might leach out of it
when boiling wort in it. Maybe if you do a couple of dark beers first, it would
cover it up.  If you want to use Aluminum, I suggest you get the pot Anodized.
Anyone living in a Metro area is probably not far from a Metal Finishing house.
Check the Yellow Pages. They can probably anodize it to MIL-A-8625, Type 3 -
Sulfuric Acid Hard Anodize, for 50 dollars. Hmm when you add that cost to the
cost of the pot, aluminum is no longer so economical. Oh well, maybe the pot
was given to you by your aunt or something.  Using plain aluminum would not
seem to be a problem health-wise anymore, but may still give a metallic
aftertaste. I don't know, I have not used one to make beer.
***
Copper will also give off ions to the acidic wort as noted by shiny copper wort
chillers. It is a needed trace mineral used by the body, but there is always to
much of a good thing. Note how Conn experienced nausea from his copper tea
kettle. However, most brewerys use copper kettles, if we are not getting sick
from those copper kettles, then we should not get sick from wort chillers. It
does not matter if the copper is from the a green oxide or clean surface, it is
still a copper ion once it gets in solution. The oxygen ions do what oxygen
does best, oxidize. In fact, now that I think about it, these oxygen ions are
not the same as oxygen dissolved into the wort during aeration, but are in fact
more reactive. But, I do not know whether they will preferentially combine with
other oxygen ions to form O2 or will combine with the wort. We Need a Chemist
to tackle this question. It could make a good arguement for precleaning our
copper.

     My partner and I brewed a porter from the sytles-series book weekind 
     before last. First attempt at a controlled mash, also our first to go 
     into secondary fermentation. Fun stuff.
     
     During the boil, the usual stuff formed on top, with an interesting 
     difference. Within the caramel-colored pools of froth were chocolate 
     brown, shiny spots of oily stuff that had the ability to remain 
     together unless attacked fairly vigorously with the stirspoon. They 
     were not fazed in the least by riding the boil action. Since they 
     tasted good, I took to skimming them off, but they never disappeared

     Is this the mythical hot break? Did I eat all the good hop oils out of

Joel Birkeland asked again about Wyeast's Brettanomyces culture.  I have used
it to make a framboise! (raspberry lambic)  It is slow, but seems quite
attenuative.  The first pouch I put in a starter seemed to do almost NOTHING
for a week!  I thought it was dead!  There was some slight sourness in the
starter, but MILD...  After pitching it (anyway) into a beer going into
secondary, and waiting two months it definately ate most of the sugar.  The
sourness that resulted was a good complement to the raspberry flavor (from
Hoptech) that went in just before bottling.  My brother thinks the final beer
is _too_ sour, but I don't think so.  He adds a little sugar syrup to his glass
just before pouring the beer.
