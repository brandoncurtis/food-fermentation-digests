Lee Menegni is on a quest for malt flavor.  I was reading the archives
recently (the all_grain_equipment file in particular) and came across an
article by Russ Pencin on 12/18/91.  He attended a class with Dr. Lewis
and learned about the degradatoin of crystal malts at mash temperatures.
Russ changed his technique to add the crystal just before the mashout
and claims to have a significant inprovement in malty flavor.  At this
point, what I know is what I've read.  I'd like to see some discussion
on this point.

Mark Garetz talks about hop AA%.  I'm very interested in reading your
upcoming book.  You've made a number of assertions here on the Digest,
and I'm looling forward to examining your supporting data.  I'm not
aware of much really detailed information in the literature.  


My own observations:  I can distinguish bitterness levels based on
Rager's formulae (which I understand to be just a thumbnail sketch
through some emperical data - certainly not 3 significant digit
accuracy).  In other words, I perceive 40 estimated IBUs (eIBU), calculated 
from Rager's formulae, to be more bitter than 34 eIBU (for the similar
beers, same OG).  I often have difficulty trying to decern differences
if the eIBU difference is less than 10% or so.  I also have a simple
`balanced bitterness' line from Martin Manning which has proved
remarkably useful in getting to the right place in the ballpark.  So,
I'm calibrated in Rager's method; it works well for me, but has its
limitations.  i.e. scaling, differences in wort composition, yeasts,
accuracy, etc.  I have to backstop Norms comments a month or so ago: 
I'm grounded in Rager's method and it works for me most of the time.


I guess what bothers me most right now is that you've asserted one
source of error in the process is more important than others, without
an error stackup analysis.  For example, there is perception (+/- 5-10%),
actual AA% in the hops used (What is a reasonable standard deviation?),
error in calculation formulae (sd?), and a host of other process variables
discussed here in HBD.  I'd like to see some data on variability before
I lean one way or the other on formulae errors.


BTW, I think the Brewing community is lucky to have someone dedicated to
persuit of hop issues like this.  Lets see some data and discussion!


Was Dr. Lewis refering to Micro's who are trying to develop a recipe, or
those who have an established recipe and have process variability?  I
would disagree with him if he was discussing the later.

It was decicively demonstrated to me that all grain is not _dramatically_
better than extract.  I visited Kinney Baughman at Tumbleweed last fall
and had my perceptions changed for good.  I had a big improvement when I
switched from extract to all grain!  But now, with some perspective, I think 
I quickly improved the raw materials and technique and attributed the 
improvement to all grain.  The key is to perfect your technique in areas 
besides mashing, use the best quality ingredients (Alexander's was 
recommended to me by Kinney).  Good quality whole hops, excellent yeast, 
sanitation, careful fermentation, etc. Some respectable Micros are using 
extract, maybe right under our noses.

This is a good reason to switch and is why I still am all grain!

Karl Sweitzer talks about sweetening meads and Potassium Sorbate.  I
thought wine had sulfites added to inhibit the yeast when the desired
dryness was reached.  My wife has anaphalatic (I can't pronounce it
either, but its bad, very bad) reactions to wine preservatives.  Is
Potassium Sorbate added to commercial wine?  I'm not really into wine,
but it would be nice to make some that she could drink once in a while. 
Special occasions, etc.  Dr. Fix, do you have any experience with
stopping wine fermentation with filtration?  Does one filter out most of
the good stuff, as with beer filtration to 1 micron?

Subject: Ultra clear Sierra Nevada Pale Ale


I received many recipe requests for my ultra clear SNPA I wrote about in 
HB1356. Here it is. The first recipe listed is a basic SNPA recipe 
suggested by many HBD readers about a month ago (thanks to all). The second 
recipe is what I actually brewed. I increased the amount of all ingredients 
to produce a 5 imperial gallon batch (22.5 litres, 6US gallons). Also, I 
made 3 substitutions due to lack of availability at my local homebrew 
supply shop. Since I've never tasted a SNPA, (unavailable in Canada) I 
don't know how closely my recipe matches the real thing. What was produced 
is a crystal clear pale ale with a great hop flavor and bouquet that smokes 
anything I've ever brewed. Finally, sorry about the standard/metric switch, 
all ingredients are sold in metric in Canada so get those calculators out.


Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (HBD readers' suggestion)
5US gallons


10 lbs Klages 2-row pale malt
 .5 lbs Cara Pils Malt
 .5 lbs Crystal (40L) Malt
1  oz  Perle, 6.8% AAU, 60 minutes
 .5 oz  Cascade, 5.5% AAU, 30 minutes
 .5 oz  Cascade, 5.5% AAU, 5 minutes
1  oz  Cascade, 5.5% AAU, dry hop in secondary (optional)        
1  quart #1056 yeast starter
3/4 cup priming sugar


O.G. 1.048, F.G. 1.008 - 1.014, 33.6 IBUs
Mash temperature 153-155F.




Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (My version)
22.5 Litres (6US gallons)


5.4 kg British 2-row malt
271 gms Cara Pils Malt
271 gms Crystal Malt        
33.6 gms  Northern Brewer, 6.8% AAU (pellets), 60 minutes
16.8 gms  Cascade, 5.5% AAU (pellets), 30 minutes
1 tsp Irish Moss flakes, 15 minutes
16.8 gms  Cascade, 5 minutes
60 gms  Cascade, dry hopped in secondary
2, 7gm pkgs gelatine dissolved in .5 litre boiling water added in racking 
to secondary        
2 pkgs Coopers dry (starter)
90 gms priming sugar 


O.G. 1.050, F.G. 1.016


Single step mash 158F (1 hour)
Sparge temperature 165F (.5 hour)
Water = distilled + 1 tsp gypsym added before mash
In primary 4 days (70F)
In secondary 7 days (70F)


Notes: 90 gms priming sugar is only about 3 oz, 1/2 cup in 6 US gallons and 
yet the carbonation is perfect. IMHO, the 3/4 cup standard is much too 
high.
I chose Cooper's yeast because, although it isn't #1056, it's neutral and 
clean. 
I still have no idea why this came out so completely void of chill haze.

        I recently brewed a simple batch of Amber Ale with John Bull
malt extract.  I carefully sanitized every piece of equipment throughout
the process and performed each step exactly as I had been instructed by
the company from whom I bought the equipment.  Unfortunately, after
a week and a half of carbonating the beer, I sampled it, only to find that
the beer had an obvious cider taste to it.  
        Just wondering if anyone has any advice for my next batch.

>         I understand that legally we're limited to 200 gallons per household.


(Just for AR precision, that's 200 gal/yr/household of 2 or more adults,
100 gal/yr for one person.)


> Who keeps track of this?  What do they do to you if you exceed your allotment?

The regulations belong to BATF--Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
(27 CFR 25.*, if you care to dig it out.)


If you go over, they make you stop.  OK, seriously, what's going on?  Taxes
and sin-control.  Mostly taxes.  They don't want you running a commercial
operation and not paying liquor taxes.  What do they do?  More a question
of what *can* they do...they've got various options.  If you make more than
the 200 gal/yr limit, they could get you for not having a brewery license,
for not paying taxes on the beer, ...  [You can only begin to imagine the
rules a licensed brewery has to obey!]  Why would they do any of these
things?  To get you to pay the taxes or stop brewing too much.  Or because
you're a person that somebody has decided needs to be harrassed.  Mostly
the former; only the latter if you piss off the right person.


How do they know?  Well, if you've got your son selling beer from a lemonade
stand on the sidewalk in the summer, it's easy.  If you're getting carried
away, and somebody complains, that's where it starts.  Otherwise (i.e.,
most of the cases anyone would care about) they find out the same way "they"
find out about any victimless crime.


Seriously, the numbers are there because they have to put some sort of
number in the law to define the upper limit of "homebrewing".  The idea is
to draw a line between brewing for home use and brewing as something on the
edge of commercial.  You could make 150 gal/yr and get busted if you tried
to sell it.  (That's a serious point.  You can make it, drink it, serve it
at home, take it to competitions and tastings...all fine.  But DO NOT offer
your beer in any circumstance that can be construed as "selling" it without
being licensed.)


> These are all hypothetical questions; my husband and I couldn't possibly drink

Well, if you get close, start alternating with wine/mead.  There are
separate limits for beer and wine (and if you think 200 gal/yr of beer is a
lot!...)

FYI a lambic beer is a beer brewed _only_ in the Payottenland area of Belgium
West of Brussles.  A lambic (or lembeek in Dutch) is a beer that has no yeast 
pitched into it.  It is open to the elements usually in the roof of a covered
barn with slats which can be opened at both gable ends.  The brewer usually
doesn't take too much trouble about cleanliness, (cobwebs common!), and its
the wild yeasts that float in that give the lambic family its distinctive taste.


My personal favourite is a Gueze beer, this is a mix of old and new lambic beers
blended in much the same way as a blended whisky is put together.  Fruit beers
made with a lambic base have the word "Lambic" on the label, other fruit beers
like the excellent Liefmans Framboise use a 'normal' brown beer for their base,
and should not have "lambic" mentioned anywhere.


Traditional Belgian lambic's and fruit beers have a high wheat content, and 
this is probably where Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic gets mixed up in its name.


I'm out here in Scotland, so most of the stuff on the HBD is pretty irrelevant,
(i.e. U.S. based) but I'd be interested to hear if anyone has attempted to brew
a "wild" beer.

Andrew Winner asks about how to siphon to/from a carboy.  I haven't heard of
anyone else who does this but, I have a little plastic crimp valve that fits 
over the siphon hose to shut off flow. These are less than a dollar.  I use a
piece of (sanatized) plastic tube that fits into the hose to start the siphon, 
shut off the crimp valve and replace the start tube with a longer tube to reach
the bottem of the carboy. 
 
Scott asked about using a blow-off hose.  I always use a blowoff hose for the
primary ferment.  I would suggest at least a 1/4" hose at least 5' long that is
secured to a large (1/2 gal +) container of bleach solution.  This prevents
very vigorous ferments from fouling an airlock.  This is particularly a problem
with meads or with high pitching rates.


About removing kraeusen, I do.  I also lose some portion of the wort.  I can't
comment about the effects of not removing it because I always have.  It's not 
much additional effort so who wants to take chances.


One last comment about chillers, the second great advantage of using a chiller
is that if you do a full boil you can take hours off the time you need on
brewing day.  Before I made my chiller, I tried several alternative cooling
methods including ice/water bath, exposure to subzero temps and addition of 
chilled, boiled water.  Each of these methods took at least an hour 
(mostly more) to reach pitching temp.  With the immersion chiller using 60degF
water I get from full rolling boil to 80degF in 15min.  


I have bought several new glass carboys from a Corning outlet store in Fremont
Indiana for $10.00.  If there is one in your area you may want to check the
prices.             Tom R.

I am looking for a better way to rack my brew from the carboy
 to the bottling bucket. Has anyone else tried puting a spigot
 on the side of their carboy? I have tried 3 times and every
 time I use a centerpunch to mark the pilot hole the carboy breaks.
 I tried using a smaller hammer, but that didn't work either.

There is also a paperback book that lists all the brewpubs, but the name
escapes me ("On Tap" maybe???).  The author puts out an update every year to
cover openings and closings.  Jeff Frane's comments are well taken.  This forum
is for homebrewing, not beer drinking (although I'd bet most of us end up
drinking the beer after brewing it).  The caviat that I would throw in is this:
If the brewpub(s) being discussed offer tours, and especially if they cater to
homebrewers, then I think the thread is appropriate.  If not, then not.

Beware, Derek, I am an engineer and a smart-ass to boot!  I think the real
drawback to plastic is that it scratches easily.  The scratches can contain
pockets of bacteria which sanitizers won't always reach.  If you don't throw
your brewing gear into the bucket for storage, and you don't clean it with an
abrasive scrubber, a plastic bucket should work well for years.

That sounds like a good idea. I live just a few miles from the Olympia
brewery and they always brag about their great water. Tell me of your

  I've been tossing around my options for reducing my average brew time to less

boiling or heated.  The obvious choice is to buy some sort of mega gas burner.
  Another thought was buying or fabricating a 3/8" copper disk that would sit 
on the electric stove burner under my brewpot.  I tend to run the stove at 
less than max to prevent scorching, the disk would be to distribute the heat 
evenly across the bottom of the pot.  It seems that this would also be handy to 
have if/when I get a gas burner.  Anyone done this?  Was it worth it?  Is there 
some magic goo to spread between the metal surfaces to help conduct heat?

Subject: Kegged beer storage life


I've just put 5 gallons of pale ale (og 1.050) into a keg for the first
time and realize that all the kegging info I've read still leaves me with
a couple of questions.


I read here or somewhere about the "shelf life" of cask conditioned real
ale once tapped.  This was referring to gravity flow, open-to-air serving
and basically implied that low gravity beers were good for a few days,
high gravs for a few weeks.


Questions:  What about CO2 dispensed beer, non-filtered, keg primed?  I
assume that as long as there is no exposure to oxygen, the keg should last
as long as an unopened bottle even if I serve part of it, correct?  What
problems might I encounter if I refridgerate the keg for serving, pour
only half, and then return the keg to my 55-60 F storage shed (I don't yet
have a fridge I can dedicate to beer only).  If I do return the keg to
storage, what level of pressure should I leave in the keg?  This will be
dependent upon keg temperature when I disconnect the gas I assume?

I'm getting really tired of being told "You can't post THIS!", "You can't
post THAT!".  The following quote is from the OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION of this
discussion group, as published in Paul Gilster's excellent book,
The Internet Navigator:


"The Homebrew Mailing List is primarily for the discussion of the making and
 TASTING of beer, ale, and mead.  Related issues, such as BREWERIES, books,
 judging, COMMERCIAL BEERS, beer festivals, etc. ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.


"Wine making talk is welcome, but non-homemade wine talk is not".


Reviews of brand new brewpubs certainly are IN, based on this description.
Now, if the official criteria for submissions were to be changed to exclude
brewpub reviews, I would be more than happy to comply.


Also, regarding the suggestion that everybody just check the latest Brewers'
Digest for brewpubs listings:


This book is hopelessly out of date because of the rapid growth in this
industry.  I personally have visted 7 brewpubs that are not in last year's
edition because they are quite simply TOO NEW.  They are not listed in the
Publist, either, BTW.  So, how is the craft-beer loving traveller supposed
to find these brand new places, without turning to like-minded colleagues
on the HBD?


BTW, The Publist has not been updated since November 12, 1992 (at least,
that is the date on the version currently at sierra.stanford.edu).


There's been a LOT of changes in the brewpub biz since then!

I agree.  I have been brewing a long time (since 1965).  I now
brew mostly all grain. The most complicated things I use are a
thermometer and a hydrometer.  No pH tests, no complicated
formulas.  I could dispense with the hydrometer if I wanted to. I
view brewing as a kitchen art, although just like a lot of other
things, an art that has been aided immensely by science.  The
"worrying about insignificant digits" is exactly what I see in
today's books and magazines.


Unless you have _really_ unsuitable water, and you no doubt
already know if you have water _that_ bad, if you mix the grains
with hot water, you are going to get conversion...Tried and true
hopping schedules, using AA% if known on a "seat of the pants"
basis, are going to be close enough, unless you insist on
achieving a commercial uniformity (to which there is really no
point in homebrewing).  It is not the science itself that is
important in homebrewing, as I see it: it is applying whatever
practical lessons the people who generally know whereof they
speak (Dr. Lewis & Dave Logsdon, to name two) can extract from
the science...

First, thanks to all who replied to our high bicarbonate/low calcium water 
question.  The concensus is to treat the H20 with a small amount of Lactic 
acid before the boil.  This has worked well so far, the beers in the fermenter
now!


Second,  we are considering using a stainless steel keg as boiling pot.  The 
keg (1/2 barrel) we have is the staight sided type, the questions are:
        1. Where should we have the welder cut the keg (on the top on the     
    inside of the handles or on the side below the handles)? 
        2. To those who use a keg as a boiling pot- How do you conduct the    
    sparge?
             2a. Is your keg configured as a mashing/lautering tun in one
                 with a false bottom and spigot?
        3. How would you improve your design if you could do it again?
        4. What are the major cautions  you have for us (note: a professional 
    welder will be doing the job for us)?
        5. What do you use for a lid to this kettle?


Thanks in advance for allowing us to pick your brains and rummage through your

but the responses should go via e-mail.  If you *really* want to tell the
world about pubs, put in a 1 or 2 line announcement in HBD that you've got
very exciting news about brewpubs in "Locality x" and can be e-mailed for
details.  The small proportion of the readership who actually live in or

Subject: Hop Aroma and Flavor




Bob Talkiewicz (btalk`at`aol.com) wants to put together a hop aroma and 
flavor identification program. It just so happens that I have some 
information on hop teas, having recently put together a small article
on hop flavor and aroma for Brewing Techniques.


Bob's intuition is correct. A hop tea is a great way to get acquainted
with the aroma and flavor characteristics of different hop varieties. It 
also serves as the most reliable way of evaluating the aroma potential of
your hops, unless you happen to have a gas chromatograph. Other claims have
been made regarding oil% but that is all they are, unsupported claims.


That said, how do you make a delicious and nutritious hop tea? I'm sure that 
a lot of HBDers have made hop teas, maybe to add hop character to a beer 
needing it, or as an alternative to dryhopping. These instructions are aimed 
at giving us a feel for what hops contribute to beer without the contributions 
from malt and yeast to cloud matters. 


So what is needed to make this tea? A quart mason jar for each 
variety, a scale capable of measuring grams (or fractions of an ounce), a 
sauce pan, brewing water (ie what you use for brewing), a liquid measuring 
cup, and hops. For consistency, volumes of water and masses of hops should be
the same for each batch. This also allows you to compare different lots of
the same variety (ie 92 vs 93 crop).


Measure 4 cups of water into the sauce pan and mark the level on the pan. 
Bring to a boil and boil for 5 mins. to drive off dissolved O2 and other
junk. Add 2 g. of hops to the boiling water, stir, and turn off the heat. 
Steep for 5 min., add water to get back to your starting volume, and pour 
gently into a mason jar, straining out the hops as best you can (a hop bag 
helps immensely). Cap the jar and cool. Repeat for each variety. The steeping
time can be varied, or the hops can be boiled for varying lengths of time to
mimic different hop additions to the kettle. Experiment and keep notes!


This should give you a good start. I think you will be surprised at how much
you can tell from a hop tea. Add a little honey and vodka and we might have
something that could compete with Zima :-0

Did you prime with Malt Extract?  Did you force-chill it before adding
to the bottling vessel?  If your answers are "Yes" and "No" then I
suspect that the flakey substance (which stretches a bit when you tilt
the bottle) is protein.  The solution is to either force-chill the
priming solution or to switch to corn sugar for priming.  I chose the
latter and the problem went away.


The funky aftertaste could be an infection or could be from stale
ingredients.

I don't think that's right.  I've noticed that, in brand new, just
received from the manufacturer, PureSeal caps (aka SmartCaps) some
have bumps, others don't.  I seem to have misplaced the phone number

Not having followed this thread too closely, but, surprisingly, the

A couple of weeks ago, I tried my first partial mash and was shocked in

amount of time, sparge". Papazian, on the other hand, got heavy into pH,
water, "hold at 138 for 30 minute, bring up to 150, hold for X". A complete
reverse from what I'm used to seeing from these two authors.

Hey Derek,


        Thanks for the hot tip about "The Brewers Digest."


Regarding your question about plastic bottles.  On my first batch
of homebrew last fall,  I thought I'd try putting a portion of my
brew in a 2-liter coke bottle.  It came out fine.  My friends and 
I conducted an extensive taste test (hic!) and detected no
difference in the taste of the brew from the glass bottles and the
brew from the plastic 2-liter.  The 2-liters are food grade plastic
and the only problem I see with using them is the social stigma 
attached to anything that isn't glass.  I guess what I'm saying
is that the people I've talked to just think they're tacky. 
Please don't call the fashion police on me, I'm new here on the
brew scene.
