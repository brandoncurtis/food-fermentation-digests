        There is a gadget that is available at many homebrew shops called 
        "The Carbonator."  It retails for just under ten bucks.  It is 
        basically a quick disconnect fitting, the same size as is found on 
        Cornelius kegs, that screws onto the top of a two liter P.E.T. bottle.
    The soda is force carbonated in the PET bottle.
    
        I've used my Carbonator        for two batches of root beer and it's worked
        well.  The only drawback is that it is only possible to do one bottle
        at a time.  I'm considering turning to yeast so I can have a larger 
        supply of soda on hand.

Hi All,


We've recently started a homebrew club covering the Cape
Town area, as far as I know this is the first club of it's
kind in South Africa. The steady growth of the club ,
pretentiously called the `Amateur Brewing Association', far
exceeded my expectations. We have also been offered a one-
off slot on national radio and are hoping that other clubs
will start in other centers of the country as a consequence
of this. Maybe it helps to promote homebrewing as a national
pass-time, high aspirations :-)


I'm hoping that someone will be able to give me information
on the AHA. While I realize that the association holds
national and regional(?) competitions in America and
publishes a brewing magazine, what are its other aims and
how do homebrewers perceive the association's influence on
homebrewing in America? Also, any background on the history
of the AHA would be appreciated.


Lastly, does anyone have their address and fax number in
Boulder, Colorado.


Many thanks,


Michel

I must take exception to Jack St Clair`s assertion that there is no 
danger of sanitizing solution being sucked into your brew.  You must be 
sure that your brew is at room temperature when you rack to the carboy or 
the resulting cooling BEFORE the yeast becomes active could suck 
sanitizer in.  Once fermentation has begun, I concur w/ JSC, there is no 
danger of bleaching your brew.

Well, that's probably true during fermentation.  However, I
often seen a negative pressure through a blowoff tube or a
regular bubble lock before fermentation begins.  Once co2
production begins, a positive airflow is established.  I have
always theorized that this is caused by temperature differences,
but would love to hear other possible explanations.


Yes, I have seen enough negative pressure to draw liquid up
through a blow-off tube, but I've never seen enough to draw it
all the way up into the carboy.  Yet.

Actually it is the old wisdom that recommends a 1.020 starter wort.
Conventional wisdom (i.e. George Fix and others) recommend that the
starter wort be as close to your brew as possible. I usually fly by
the seat of my pants, so I keep a bunch of sterile 1.040 hopped wort
around for starters. The reason for using hopped wort is the added
protection against infection provided by the hops.

Suprise, yet another thing that Jack and I disagree on!  The aroma profile
of EKGs are often described as "earthy" or sometimes "grassy".  Its the 
way the hop is.  Dry hopping of ales is about the best method of increasing
hop aroma, as can be demonstrated by drinking a Anchor Liberty, or one of
my ales.  My latest Styrian Goldings batch was dryhopped with SG, and cask 
hopped with EKGs, and the results were absolutely fantastic.  Too bad it 
kicked last nite.  For my money, if you want hop aromatics above what a 
kettle can deliver, you gotta dry hop.  BTW, the initial harshness of some
cask hopping seems to blend and diminish over time (if you can wait!).


Good brewing,

There is one (mostly hypothetical) situation to take note of,
however.  If one attaches the blow off tube while the wort is
still hot, the cooling of the wort can create a reverse pressure
where the liquid at the other end of the tube may get sucked back
towards the fermenter.  Of course, if the brew is this hot then
one shouldn't have pitched yeast and attached the blow off
anyway.

I had a rare treat the other day; real Berliner Weise. It was awesome, very tart
and gueze like. I've been looking for this beer style in States for a few years
and this is the first time I've found it. If you are in the Boston
Metro area any time soon stop in at the Wursthaus in Harvard Square and have one
but be forwarned; it has a very unusual taste and will set you back $4.75 a
bottle (but this includes rasberry syrup :^) . In reference to the number of
requests for brew pubs in various parts of the states, there is a commercially
available guide to these: "On Tap: The Guide to U.S. Brewpubs" , which has gone
through at least two editions.
If anybody in the Boston area would like a free bottle of Spruce extract 
come and get it. I made a nasty spruce beer last Xmass with it and want to trash
it or give it away.

Collin Ames asks about extract IPA recipes.


I've made several, roughly like this:


6 lbs. light malt extract syrup (I like William's English Light or EDME)
1 lb. demerara or brown sugar
1/2-3/4 lb. medium crystal, steeped
10-12 HBU's Fuggles or Northern Brewer, 60 min.
1/2 oz. Fuggles, Willamette or Goldings, added at end & steeped w/heat off 20 
min. or so
Liquid yeast culture from starter soln., I prefer Wyeast 1098 "British"
4 oz. corn sugar to prime.


If you like oak chips, they add an interesting flavor (although purportedly 
not "correct" for the "style," so don't do it if you want to send your beer 
to a competition) - I toast a half cup or so in a 350 deg. oven on a cookie 
sheet for 20 min. and add them to the secondary (dry-oaking?).


Go for it, Collin.  Pale Ales are easy to make from extract and delightful to 
drink.  Bottoms up!

Subject: Using Hop Pellets / Carboy Vaccuums


Paul Beard mentions problems with hop pellets.  I've gone through the same
problems myself.  Using hop cones (whole hops) will virtually eliminate this
problem, especially if you use them in hop bags.  The problem is that not all
varieties come whole.  Do you cool your hot wort before dumping it into the
fermenter?  If so, you can whirlpool the wort and let it settle while its
cooling.  Another thing that works fine is to just remove your strainer and
let everything into the fermenter.  You can then rack it to another fermenter
(leaving the hops behind) when it all settles out.  If you do this, you'll
have to rack it before fermentation gets active - this will stir everything
up for sure.  Some people do this as a matter of course to get the wort off
the cold break material.


Paul then writes:
>Answers can be e-mailed if this seems too newbie-ish for public discussion.


This type of question is perfect for this forum, IMHO.  If you can't discuss
methods to ease the brewing process, then the HBD isn't worth very much, now
is it?

Fermentation won't create a vaccuum but temperature differences between the
inside and outside of the carboy can.  The only time I see this as a problem
is before primary fermentation gets going.  The wort can easily be a few
degrees hotter than the outside air and as it cools it sucks in some air (or
bleach water, as the case may be).  Once fermentation begins, Jack is correct
and you have no worries, mate.  I suggest using an "S" type airlock until
fermentation gets going (this type of airlock will allow gas to bubble
through in either direction, without any liquid getting through).


Good Luck,
Norm

Text item: Text_1


     Well, wouldn't you know it, I blew it on the blow-off bit the other 
     day.  I said that there is never a time when a vacuum is formed in 
     the carboy and have been reminded that this is not the case.  
     
     Dick Foehringer of "The Brewmeister" homebrew supply shop in Folsom 
     CA, reminded me that this is not always true.  When the yeast is 
     pitched while the wort is still above room temperature and the 
     carboy neck is stopped, a vacuum can be formed sufficient enough to 
     suck the contents of the airlock or, worse yet, the contents of the

Subject: Contaminate, pasteurize, potatos, and Gott


I intend to contaminate and pasteurize my Wit.  For lactobacillus type
critters I will remove some of the beer and put it in Thermos flask.  Add
a little grain and hold for an hour at 125-130 (as per Noonan in a recent
BT or Zymurgy, or was it Miller?).  At that stage assume most critters 
except thermophilic lactobacillus are dead and contaminate wort with it.
After a day or two put in my brewpot, heat to 170, chuck in the wort chiller,
chill and bottle with wort and fresh yeast.  Comments or this suicidal 
venture :-)?


For a potato pilsener one might follow an oatmeal or flaked barley type
recipe, like the North German pilsener recipie in Miller.  Boil 5 times
the amount of potatoes as adjunct (potatoes are 80% water), mash fairly
well and add to saccarification rest.  How it would turn out, I don't know,
but I wouldn't exceed 20% of fermentables as potato.


Dominick Venezia recounts Gott experience.  I have a 7 gallon, and found
that the tap is easily removed and corked and that 1/4" copper fits inside
nicely, as he did.  I have considered the false bottom question - even
to the extent of manufacture.   Perhaps a simple solution would be a Phil
bottom connected to 1/4" copper.  I considered getting  a sheet of 1/8" 
plastic.  Cutting out an exact circle to fit, cut it into slices, perhaps
1/2 - 1" wide and glue them backon to 2 triangular shaped feet, such that
one side has the bottom just over the tap hole, with the other end resting
on the far side with a 1/32-1/16" gap between each piece (or the width of your
cutting blade).  Then brew with the back end sitting on a piece of strofoam.
Someday I'll do it and report, but in the meantime my copper manifold is OK.

Careful!!


This is only correct assuming:


A. The wort temperature is stabile. 


B. The yeasties have started doing their CO2 thang.


If the temperature of the wort and/or the headspace decreases,
the volume of both will decrease. This volume will be displaced
by whatever solution your blowoff-tube is stuck in. Depending on
how much the temperature decreases, how long the blowoff tube is,
and the rate at which CO2 is flowing out of the system, it is
quite possible to suck sterilant into your precious wort.


If you cooled your wort down to, say, 70 degrees, pitched a yeast
starter, sealed the fermenter with a blowoff tube stuck in chlorine,
and your room temperature is 65 degrees, you're going to have a
contraction of gas in the headspace when it all settles out at
65 degrees. Unless your yeast starter is really active and the
lag time before significant CO2 production is not longer than this
temperature drop, you could conceivably suck all of your sterilant
into your wort AND whatever wild thangs which are floating in the
air that gets sucked in after it. 


Of course, this is only the pessimistic, doomsday, worst case
scenerio. You could always just relax, don't worry, and have a homebrew.


So how do you safely isolate your wort from air and nasties?

Traditionally, these systems consist of a vessel open at one end in
which water can be added. There is a tube entering the side of this

on the open end of the vessel, the air will draw into the liquid via
the tube, percolate through the water, and to the source of the vacuum.

 The Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse yeast is ale yeast, however there is most 
 likely lager yeast added at bottling,which is the one at the bottom 
 most likely.
 Additionally, there is a fat chance of the yeast being dead anyway --
 due to pasteurization before shipment.
 So even if you get a starter from a bottle, it's not going to be
 the "right" yeast.

I would suspect that the package had been mishandled (either frozen or

that I've talked to don't really know much about brewing (or just think
they do).  Most around here don't even brew regularly!

The problems is the oats.  You need to mash them if you want to use them
in a beer.  You need to add some Base malt, like Pale or Pils to provide
enzymes or you can use a diastatic malt extract such as Edme DMS.
I believe that M&F makes a diastatic malt extract too.

I agree, but I think the concentration you suggest is a bit low.  The
recommended concentration is 1 tablespoon of household bleach per gallon
(this is based upon my discussions with Dr. Joe Power at the Siebel

You should put it into a gallon jug or bucket which has a quart of
liquid in it.  Some have suggested using sanitizer, but I just use
plain tapwater.  If you have concerns about your tapwater (in case
it gets sucked up into the fermenter while the wort is cooling) you
can boil it first.

No, you do not have to rack.  I've been adding dryhops to my primary
with no problems at all.  I just wait for fermentation to subside to
about a glub per minute and add the dryhops for a week-to-10days.

Sounds like either the hop bag was too coarse a mesh or your strainer was
clogging with hot & cold break, not hops.  I use hop bags all the time,
use pellets most of the time and have removed the strainer from the funnel.
I just pour the wort in until I reach the trub and then stop pouring.
Usually, I leave only a quart or so of liquid in the kettle.  I've brewed
this way using both blowoff and non-blowoff and the beers have come out
mighty tasty (and won a few ribbons too).

Your second hunch is correct.  It's IBUs (or some would say, estimated IBUs).
Check out the formulas in Jackie Rager's article in the Hops Special Issue
of Zymurgy or the formulas posted in back issues of HBD.  Then again, doesn't
Noonan give recipes in the back?  Those say "X ounces of hop Y with a %AA of

Yes and no.  It is true that "during fermentation" there is always
positive pressure, however, many homebrewers (despite the warnings)
use small diameter blowoff hoses.  If your wort goes into the
fermenter at, say 80F and you then put it into a 65F basement, the
contraction of the air in the headspace will create enough of a 
vacuum to suck liquid into the fermenter up a 3/8" ID hose.  Also,
the same is true if you overfill certain kinds of airlocks (like
the Econolock).  That's why boiled-cooled water is the safest
thing to put in your airlock/blowoff bucket, but I just use hot
(160F) tapwater.


Certainly nothing is going to crawl up your blowoff tube, so why
even use sanitizer?  Blowoff can support mold (I know, firsthand),
but by then you can just switch to an airlock.


****
Phil asks about beer shelf life.


The shelf life of beer depends on your sanitation, hop rate and
on the alcohol level of the beer.  Good sanitation, high hop rate
and high alcohol level will make a beer that will keep for *years*.
More normal hop rates and alcohol levels, if you keep the beer in
a cool place and you have good sanitation, should be good for a
month or two and then begin to decline in quality, but should still
be drinkable for well over a year.  How quickly the beer will
begin to lose quality depends a lot on oxygen in the beer (HSA and
post-ferment) -- the less the better.  If the beer begins to
overcarbonate, then either you bottled too early or your sanitation
is not as good as it could be.

I rarely engage in one-upmanship, but I can top a previous posters aged yeast
packet story. I have and still regularly use a Wyeast 1084 Irish culture that
I excavated from the back of my refrigerator two years past the package date.
As I (vaguely) recall, when I activated it, it took only about two days to
swell up. This was a couple of years ago, and the culture has been
regenerated multiple times since. The moral here is that if the yeast is
treated well, i.e. kept between 32-40 deg F, it will last a good long while.
If not, like it was allowed to get warm in transit, it may be DOA.
Conscientious dealers will pay extra for rapid transit, and place their
orders during cooler weather. If they order directly from the yeast supplier
rather than through a wholesaler, there is one less chance for problems to
occur.

I have gotten many relpies through my emailand I'd like to thank you all by
summarizing my results.


First, let me say that I haven't actually gone out to look for these things
yet, so I don't know the prices.


What I really wanted was a pump housing that I could rig to my drill so that
I could have a variable speed pump, and not really have to worry about having
valves to restrict flow...I could just reduce the rpm on the drill.  A few
good suggestions came over the lines.


1.  Dishwasher pump.  should be food grade shouldn't it? and should be able
to handle the temp.
      some dishwashers have two pumps, one is a recirc pump, the other a
drain pump.  


2. Washing machine pump.  Should be able to handle the temps.


3. Look into a grainger catalog.  I live in the Tampa area, and luckily the
company I work for has a grainger account.  I'll be looking into this soon.
will post later.


All in all, I think I like the dishwasher pump idea the best.I think it will
be the cheapest (about $30 the last time I purchased one) and I will be able
to rig it to my drill.  I'll let you know.

Subject: Maple in brewing


Regina H. asks if maple syrup is very fermentable.  I'm not a technical 
brewer, but a general answer is that it is fermentable to the point of 
making your beer very thin.  This may offend those who want body, but it 
doesn't bother those whose primary interest is taste.  I suppose you 
can add a few non-fermentables to get the body up, but I don't bother.  I 
make what would otherwise be a Belgian white ale, except that I add a quart of 
maple syrup to a 5 gallon batch.  It is about the only beer recipe I repeat.


Does anyone know where the cheapest maple syrup in the VA-DC-MD-PA area is?

My all-time favourite brew is the Hefe-Weizen found in the Bavarian
region, which is characterized by that clove taste.


Recently, I made a very good imitation I called "Kansas Heifer-Weizen".
The following is for a 5 gallon batch:


 3.3 lbs -  Yellow Dog extract (12% wheat) (thanks Sam!)
 3.3 lbs -  Northwestern "Weizen" extract (65% wheat)
 1.5 aau -  Hallertauer hops, 50 minutes in boil (bittering)
 1.5 aau -  Hallertauer hops, in wort for 10 minutes after boil
 1 quart -  starter from WYEAST #3068 Weihenstephen wheat yeast.


After chilling and siphoning into the primary, I aerate the wort
for about 5 minutes with pure O2 from my welding rig, then pitch.
O.G. was 1.042, and F.G. was 1.014.  Fermentation was for 9 days
at 63 deg. F., then racked into a Cornelius keg.


Results _excellent_ with a very nice "clove" flavor.


Brew on!
Frank

Hi All:


Just a quick question. I am looking for sources to buy hop
rhizomes (are there any other kinds)?  Please respond via
e-mail.  I will consolidate al  responses and post  the 
resulting directory in about a week.


TIA and happy brewing.

Subject: Missing HBD's and Bicycle Beer (tm)


I missed several issues of HBD.  For some reason they quit coming and
I had to re-subscribe.  If someone could forward the digests between
Feb. 25 and March 2  (if there were any).


Also, I had an interesting beer the other day called Bicycle Beer.
Actually it's more of a flavored malt beverage (thats what it says
in small letters on the bottle).  It's bottled here in Indiana , but
the company is based in Chicago I think.  After trying the beer I happened
to be reading through some back issues of The Brewer's Digest and saw 
an article on the same beer.  Apparently it is being marketed as a malt
based equivalent to wine coolers.  It is for the "60% of the population
that don't like the taste of beer..." Anyway, I was wondering if
anyone else had tried this stuff.  I thought it was better than wine 
coolers but that isn't saying much.  Brewer's Digest is really not very
useful for the homebrewer.  Someone had mentioned that it contained
lists of brewpubs, but I think that is a once a year issue.  The library
did't have it.  Mostly it is about commercial brews and advertisements.
