Subject: air-tight primary fermenter


I am having a problem with my 8-gallon "tupperware" style 
fermenter.  It no longer seals completely air tight.  Air is 
coming in around the lid, but at a rate that is apparently not 
significant.  However, even during a vigorous fermentation, 
my fermentation lock does not bubble any more.  Does 
anyone have any ideas about how to seal the vessel?  I've  
tried water to "wet seal" the lid when closing.

Subject: Potato beer


The question has been asked:


Has anyone ever made a potato beer?




Yes, I admit it, I have brewed with potatoes.  The inspiration and guidance 
for this questionable activity came from an article that appeared in The Foam 
Ranger's Brewsletter Urquell some years ago.  When I get the time (and 
remember to), I will type in the entire article.  


In the meantime, here are the basics of making Spud Brew:


You can make most any style of beer that you want with potatoes.
Lighter-colored and flavored beers let the spud character shine through better.
You are making an adjunct beer here, so use a good proportion of six-row.  
You'll need the extra enzymes. 


First, shred the potatoes (I've never bothered to peel them, just wash them and
grate them finely.)  and boil the crap out of them, using _lots_ of water. 
Your brewery will smell like a soup kitchen, not a brewery!  Allow the mixture
to cool to ~150 deg (ice cubes will help speed this up), and stir in a portion
of your crushed six-row (how much depends on exactly what you are making).  You
are aiming for a protein rest temp here.  Let the whole mess sit for an hour,
then add the rest of the barley malt (and water if necessary to maintain proper
consistency). Heat to ~152 deg for 90 minutes for conversion. 


>From here, proceed normally (conversion, 'mash'-out if you want, sparge, etc.).
I've not had trouble with starch haze with this method.


Charlie P says in his book that potatoes don't add any flavor/aroma character 
to beer.  I'd have to disagree.  It's not strong, but there is a potato 
character that is distinctive.


One other point to remember is that potatoes are largely water, meaning that 
only a small percentage (maybe 10-20%) of the weight you add is convertible 
starch.  I get ~ 5-6 pts/lb/gal. from one pound of potatoes.  It's not much.


Good luck!

Subject: Boiling caps


In HBD #1363, Greg Bishop wrote that boiling bottle caps to sanitize
them "is likely to damage the rubber on the cap and therefore lessen the
integrity of the seal that is formed."


This is not consistent with my experience.  I have bottled 30+ batches
with crown caps (I used champagne & grolsch bottles previously) and I
always put the caps in a pan of water and bring it to a boil while I
boil the corn sugar solution in another pan.  I have never had a problem
with the seals on the caps.


As to the original question, whether it is necessary, I don't know.  I
do not find it to be much extra work and it helps me to not worry.

Subject:      Holes in Glass


Once upon a time I had the need for a 1/4 inch hole in a piece of flat
glass.  What I did was took some modeling clay (glass putty would work
too), and made a dam a larger than the 1/4 hole around the area do be
receive the hole.  I made up a mixture of fine oil (kerosene) and
dry abrasive compound (400 or 600 grit, don't remember), and poured some
in the dam.  I mounted a 1/4 inch brass tube in the drill press, selected
a low speed and used a light pressure and just waited for the results,
adding fresh abrasive mixture occasionally.  It takes quite awhile!


You can use any kind of a lightweight oil, or even a cutting fluid.  Water
is no good as it evaporates too quickly.


To be honest, the best thing to do, is to use a plastic bottling bucket
for this.  If you MUST use a carboy, then I would suggest using a
polycarbonate carboy as it would be a whole lot easier to deal with!


Just some thoughts...

Subject: freezing cracked malt


     Somehow the text of my last message got zapped, so here goes 
     again:
     I've got a lousy grain cracker so am thinking about ordering my 
     grain roller-cracked from my friendly supplier. Small amounts are 
     no problem, but I wonder about the effect on 50 pound bags (which 
     will last me 2-4 months). I assume I shouldn't leave the 
     pre-cracked sitting around (am I off-base here?).
        Are there any problems with freezing cracked grain? Like does 
     it go bad? Any special precautions? Should I be re-bagging in 
     ziplocks? (I've got a big basement freezer, half-empty most of 
     the time anyway.) Should I just bite the bullet and buy a roller 
     mill for next anniversary/birthday/xmas? What say you?

I'm tying to build the tower system that Bill Owens talks about in his
book. I've found the pump and the foot switch. Now I'm looking for some
hose/tubing to withstand 200F. It needs to be flexible and be food grade.


I can't come up with anything. As I understand it - the regular tubing you
get is only rated to 140F.


Any ideas.

I use a 10 gal GOTT with a Phil's Phalse Bottom in it.  The PPB comes
with a plastic elbow on top in the center.  It is just a matter of
hooking it up with tubing to the outlet.  If you need a plan for

All of mine was designed for a RIMS so it is capable of withstanding

pumped out from the false bottom, not just running out via gravity.

Subject: beating a dead horse with a blowoff tube


  Another $.02.  While the wort's cooling to room temp I use an airlock (it 
bubbles the wrong way).  After positive pressure starts I run a blowoff tube 
into a clean plastic 1 gallon water bottle - no water, bleach, battery acid, 
etc.  I use about a 2 foot tube, and nothing's crawled through and 
contaminated my beer yet.  
After foaming subsides and I switch back to an airlock, I've typically got 
about 1/2 liter of (low alcohol) beer which my dog gleefully consumes.
  IMHO, any microbe athletic enough to climb through 2 feet of tubing, against 
pressure, deserves a beer.

I'll be bottling up my _first_ batch of beer in a couple of

Should I sanitize everything _immediately_ before bottling?
I cannot find a reference which states how long one can wait

Subject: Blow-Off Tubes


The blow-off tube CAN suck the bleach water into your carboy.  This is not
hypothetical, as I discovered.  If you pitch at 80F, attach the blow off
tube, and allow the carboy to cool to 60F or so overnight, you might wake
up the next morning to discover water all the way up the tube,
especially if your yeast is very sluggish.


At this point, disturbing things any further will surely cause at least
some of that water to fall into your carboy.


This happened to me with a low-gravity batch and a slow-starting
yeast.  Bacterial contamination apparantly followed.  It turned out to
be the worst-tasting batch I had ever made, with definiate DMS aroma.
It was quickly christened "slug-bait", and seems to perform well in
that role.  My dad also seems to enjoy it.


Since then, I swear by the use of a starter.

Within Illinois, BAA ships via UPS (unless they've changed their policy)
for many states outside IL, they ship via RPS.  Until some court ruled
that their services did not qualify as "personal shipments" of alcoholic
beverages and stopped them form operating in TX, they shipped my monthly
samples via RPS.  Unlike UPS, RPS does not require a signature for
pickup.  In fact, if you were not home, they just left the package by
your front door, backing in the TX heat, with "BEER" written all over it,
making one heck of a tempting target for my neighbors or any passers-by.
The last package delivered before they terminated my shipments was indeed
stolen; fortunately, VISA offers a refund for merchandise never delivered
(nothing against the people at BAA; I explained the situation in detail
and they were friendly and helpful).  As for RPS...

        There is a gadget that is available at many homebrew shops called 
        "The Carbonator."  It retails for just under ten bucks.  It is 
        basically a quick disconnect fitting, the same size as is found on 
        Cornelius kegs, that screws onto the top of a two liter P.E.T. bottle.
    The soda is force carbonated in the PET bottle.
    
        I've used my Carbonator        for two batches of root beer and it's work

Subject: Drilling holes in Glass


Hello, I just saw a posting in the digest about someone 
needing to put some holes in glass.
When I was in the Coast Guard, we made a plumbers putty ring on the
glass, filled it with valve grinding compound, found a piece of stainless
Stainless steel instrumentation pipe the same diameter as the
hole we needed, cut across the end of it with a hack saw, making
about a 1/4 inch deep cut, put it in a drill, and started
drilling, the valve grinding compound acts as a very good cutting
agent. This takes awhile, so have a few of your best bottles on 
ice before you start.
Hope this helped some.

Subject: Wyeast 3056 Works too! (I think....)


Greetings,


I did respond by direct e-mail previously, but the 3068 yeast note prodded
me into posting:


I've just racked a Weissbier (Papzian's recipe) to the secondary.  I used
3056, pitched from a .5 Gal starter.  3.5 days of blistering-fast
fermentation, went from 1.050 to 1.012.  Primary was done at about 72F or
so, per the book "German Wheat Beer" by Warner.


The clove, vanilla and spice flavors were right on in the sample from my
racking.  And the smell of the primary, even after I had rinsed it
out...well, HEAVENLY might but too strong of a word, but its close!  After
reading the previous post about 3056, I'm truly convinced that pitching rate
and temperature is are key elements in bringing out these flavors.  


3056, it works for me.  Of course YMMV.

Subject: carboys, once and for all




     I seem to recollect promising to summarize and post concerning the 
     best places to get carboys. I don't think I have much new to add to 
     the fray at this point, so I'll keep it short.
     
     In the 7-gallon category, the hands-down winner seems to be St. Pats, 
     Austin, TX with clean used lab carboys for $11 + shipping. 3-4 people 
     told me how nice, prompt, etc., they were. They have an 800 number; I 
     don't have it at hand. Somebody will post it. They also have an email 
     address - stpats`at`wixer.bga.com. You can order through it, but _nobody_ 
     thinks that sending a credit card # via email is a good idea. 
     
     James Page in Minneanoplace seems to be the #2. They tell me that 
     their prices will be going up to $18 from $15 as soon as they have 
     some to sell. Theirs are new. The 3rd runner up was $22 - I forget 
     who. Nobody has any in stock at this time, so it's moot.
     
     The 5-gallon carboys are carried by Waccamaw Pottery for $10.99, and 
     Corning Glassware Outlets for $8.99 (DC area prices). Look for either 
     at your local Humongous Mills outlet mall. Waccamaw is 40 min from me; 
     Corning is 60 min. I'll spend the 2 bux. Likely a good opportunity for 
     a pickup truck and a group buy here (I'm _not_ volunteering).
     
     FWIW, YMMV, I have no affiliation with anything whatsoever, and I 
     think that trying to drill holes in glass is a dum idea.

Subject: O2 Absorbing Bottle Caps


I was on a flight the other day and sitting next to me
was the Exec VP of a chemical/polymer company and of
course right at the end of the 5+ hour flight I found
out that his company makes the material used in the 
oxygen absorbing caps.  Let's be clear on this.  They
don't make the caps, just the polymer that is used in
the caps which they sell to the cap companies.


Anyway, we didn't have much time to talk about this 
since it was near the end of the flight, and he didn't
have the product data sheets with him, but here's what
I gleaned from him:  (Now don't shoot the messenger!
I'm just reporting here and don't have any way of
verifying the info, and remember that *he* had a product
to sell.  He has a phd in chemistry, however).


The O2 absorbant is an "ascorbate" but he wouldn't 
confirm which kind, potassium, sodium etc.  But he did
nod when I suggested it was one of those two.  It is
"blended" (for lack of technical term here) with the 
plastic liner material, which is either PVC or polyethylene,
I guess you can order it either way.  He wasn't sure 
about the "moisture activated" statements, but supposed
that the humidity in the head space played a role in 
transporting the O2 to the cap.  He also thought that
soaking the caps in water/sanitizer solution would most
likely reduce their effectiveness, but by how much he
wasn't certain.  He's going to check it out and get back 
to me.


One of the more interesting tidbits: he said that the 
cap was useful for scavenging the O2 in the headpsace, 
*and also for keeping the beer free from O2* because he
said the cap liner is not an O2 barrier and oxygen would
migrate from the outside and into the headspace.  I asked
if the positive pressure wouldn't keep the air out, and
he said he didn't think so, that intuitively it would seem
that way but gas was mostly space and there was lots of
room for the molecules to sneak around each other.


I'm still a bit skeptical.  But not being a physicist or 
chemist I can't judge.  Of course just as he said this
we had to part company to get to different connecting
flights, but we did exchange cards and he said he'd send
me some data on the material.  So I'll report back if I
learn anything new.

Subject: Holes in Glass


Sorry if this already was suggested...If I remember what my father -
who was a tool and die maker (expert machinist) told me, the way to
"drill" glass was really to grind a hole in it.  You can make a 
"drill" by using a piece of relatively soft metal tubing and using
a slurry of some really hard abrasive.  Basically, you hold the 
tubing in an electric drill against the glass and wear a hole in it.
Note: the tubing is just flush cut at the end... no apparent "teeth".
He also told me that you can make a drill by banging a soft metal
tube (soft steel) into industrial diamond powder.  This causes the
diamond grit to be imbedded in the steel.  Chuck it in the drill,
lubricate with water frequently and grind away.
I suspect that it may take quite awhile to grind through and that
some sort of fixture to hold the drill in place would be needed.
I guess it would be possible to fit a carboy in a larger drill press.


Good luck.

Subject: SPARGE WATER




>From what I've read in the past HBD issues, and Miller's books,
it seems the conventional wisdom regarding sparge water
quantity is; .5 gal per 1 Lb grain. For a five gallon batch
and grain bills of 7 lbs or so, this is fine, but what
about 11 lb grain bills? One can easily end up with 8+ 
gallons of wort in the kettle.
Is their a specific gravity of the sparged-grains-liquid to
aim for? I know over sparging will extract excessive tannins,
but what constitutes over sparging?
Is their a gal/lbs/temperature/time/pH equation to acheive maximum 
sparge efficiency? 


While I'm on the topic of sparging, the common chemical for
reducing the pH of hard water is Gypsum. My boiled Tap water
requires 1.5 Tbls of Gypsum to bring the pH down to 5.5 (when
cooled). The pH drops about .2 for each 1 tspn/gal.
I don't feel comfortable adding this quantity of Gypsum to my 
water, so what other acids are available to the Homebrewer,
and who supplies them?
Thanks in advance.

and proposes a device similar to a waterpipe to do this.


This idea was also mentioned in the first or second issue of
Brewing Techniques (the liquid used was hydrogen peroxide) and
I believe the author was an HBD member.


I suspect that this will not work to remove nasties from our
air.  Follow with me on this (I'll borrow Steve's ascii drawing)...

The air, with its suspended dust, wild yeast and bacteria travel
down the input tube, where they meet the liquid in the jar.  The
surface tension of the liquid causes a bubble to form.  Now, what's
a bubble... it's a little ball of gas suspended (temporarily) in
the liquid.  The gas (air) in the bubble still has all the suspended
dust, wild yeast and bacteria in it.  The bubble rises to the surface
and pops, releasing its cargo of nasties into the headspace of the
jar.  The pressure in the headspace, causes some of this air to
travel up the "tube to fermenter" and then subsequently into the
wort.


Am I right?


Steve suggests vodka or bleach solution, but even if this works, I
suspect that we would not want to bubble Chlorine Bleach vapors
through our wort.  If it does work, I would imagine that either
hydrogen peroxide or vodka would be our best bet.


I think that to remove airbourne nasties, we need to filter the air.
There have been many posts suggesting those .2um disposable (hospital?)
filters and at least one home-made one.  I don't exactly recall the
design of the home-made one, but I believe it was made by simply stuffing
cotton or activated charcoal or both into a short length of plastic tubing
and then pushing the air through it with an aquarium pump.

Im back from my latest beer hunting expedition to California.  Ill put 
together  a brief summary next week (at the risk of being flamed terribly
by Mr. Frane :-)


The two people who posted above caught my attention.  I realize people look
to the net as some incredible source of free information, and it is.  I 
would like to caution these brewer wannabies as to the reality of getting 
into the buisness.  The main impression I returned with this week is that
too many people are entering the buisness without the required expertise
in brewing.  I sampled far too many average to infected beers over the 
past two weeks, and some were even from so called reputable brew pubs.  To
Troy, who do you think regulates brewing in the US?  Maybe the Bureau of
Tobacco , ALCOHOL, and firearms?????  Obviously, there local laws and 
regulations to inquire about, but the BATF is the place to start.  To 
Scot, (Actually to your friend):  If you dont even know who manufactures
brewing equipment, how do you possibly believe you are qualified to run
a brewery?  Have you ever been to a micro?  Do you have any serious brewing
experience?  Have you subscribed or read any of the numerous brewing journels,
The New Brewer, Brewing Techniques, hell even Zymurgy advertises for 
wannabies.  BTW, Cross Distrubiting in California sells used equipment. And
there are more used breweries on the market every year as inexperienced 
people fail.


I imagine this sounds a little harsh, and maybe it is.  There are many 
qualified brewing consultants in the buisness.  I strongly suggest that 
if these folks are serious about sinking a million or more into a difficult
endeavor, that they spend the couple of thousands required to get a good
consultant and listen to what they say!

I think you are adding a serious amount of work for a questionable result.
The fact that you used a yeast that originates in the Rodenbach brewery, is
probably going to result in some degree of "contaminated" beer anyway.  If
you really want to discover the results of this particular yeast, let it
finish and find out the results.  If you want to brew a real Wit bier, 
use a real Wit yeast, there are several on the market now.  There is also
some real good info thats been posted over the last year or two regarding
excellent methods of traditional Wit production.  


Good brewing,

Rob Moline here.  Have been reading HBD for over a year courtesy of my wife's
access to the net and I am finally moved to put in my $.02 on a number of
subjects.


Firstly, on Laura Conrad's and other's thoughts on a basic homebrewing book. 
"Homebrewing 101 - A Practical Guide for the Beginning Brewer" is a book I
wrote and copywrited in September 1993.  As the GA law decriminalizing
homebrewing went into effect on July 1, 1993, I approached the owners of
Savannah's "Mill Bakery, Eatery, and Brewery" with a request that I be allowed
to use their establishment as a meeting place for a homebrew club.


This was as a direct result of my own humble and bumbling attempts at
homebrewing in 1991 in Tallahassee FL.  I too was confused by the only source
of info on hand, C. Pap's "NCJOHB."  I then learned of the North Florida
Brewers' League monthly meetings at the Monroe Street "Mill" and learned more
at my first meeting than I had in several months.


Obtaining permission from the owners Bob Freeman and Lewis McClure for using
the Savannah Mill also resulted in their requesting a short written run down on
how to brew.  This four page quickie sheet then evolved into a small book with
chapters on Legalities, Brewery Evolution in the U.S., Malt, Hops, Yeast,
Water, the Brewing Process, Required and Optional Equipment, Diagrammatic
representations of sets ups and a list of acknowledgements that include the
HBD, NCJOHB, and Zymurgy.


The book is designed purely as a first step to brewing a single stage, closed
fermentation, extract kit based brew, based on my own trial and error
practices, as I believe that the beginner needs to get the basics established
before advancing to mashing, sparging, and hop and malt selection.


I have at this time sold some 200 copies of "HB 101 - APGFTBB" and have
received very favorable responses from beginners who indeed say, "I've read
Miller, papazian, et. al, and am still confused" and then become brewers using
my text.  A 2nd edition of "HB 101 - APGFTBB" will soon be available, with
details on my failures and successes in all grain and kegging.


Realizing that the HBD is not a forum for commercialization, I have not in the
past been tempted to mention this on the net, but with the recent post that I
believe said, "I'd buy an HB101 if one existed" I felt I had to state my
copywrited use of the name.


I have not been looking for wider sales of the book (currently only available
at the Mill) until I had the 2nd edition ready and critiqued by other brewers
and beginners, perhaps at some time in the future.  If e-mail shows a demand,
maybe sooner than later.


BTW the Savannah Brewers' League, established at the Mill on 9/15/93 is now an
AHA sanctioned club with 63 members.  I was elected and am proud to serve as
president of the league, a position I hold as a result of organizational leg
work, rather than brewing expertise.  In fact, I haven't yet reached that lofty
plateau where extract brewers look like lower forms of life! But, many of the
membership are stunning craftsmen and women, and easily run rings around me.


On the subject of "Queens of Beer," I am pleased to announce that the SBL
January Competition winner was Becky Kearny for her Steam Beer.  I hope that
"Queens of Beer" becomes an established annual competition.  Good luck!


On the subject of Cooper's kits and plain malts.  I have over 50 batched of
Cooper's (both forms) under my belt and have never found them to be 2nd rate or
hazy.  A quality product IMHO, among the first of my beer experiences in the 12
years I spent in Australia.  I recommend them in my book, as pub bought Coopers
in Oz is bottle-conditioned, and hence the beginning brewer can produce a beer
similar to a word class product (Michael Jackson "Pocket Guide to Beer" 3-4
stars) on their first time out, yeast sediment and all.


On the subject of obtaining Cornelius kegs and equipment, 6 months ago I was
extremely fortunate to have obtained a complete set up, consisting of a
Cornelius ice chest with 4 dispensing cut outs, a huge 4 line Corny cold plate
(weighs a ton), a large roller stand to support the chest with space for 2-3 5
gallon kegs and co2 tank, a co2 tank, regulator, and taps.  This is an older
design unit that has had its fair share of abuse, and is now unsuitable for
further commercial use, maily "cos, it's so damn ugly."  Actually marked "junk"
in black magic marker on the side, it was slated for dumping by the Sav Pepsi
distributor until a friend of a friend learned of my search for kegging
equipment.  (I imagine that a case of homebrew and $20 at an auto body shop
might redeem it.)  A co2 tank will cost $35 deposit and $12 for exchanging for
a full one from the Sav Coke distributor.  I have obtained several used 5
gallon kegs from a Tallassee bar that converted to bag in box, and the local
Coke distributor will sell anyone Corny kegs full of pre-mix Coke products for
$14 and change -- no deposit.  (This is info that will be included in the 2nd
edition, but I start feeling guilty when I read requests for cheap equipment
and I don't share knowledge I possess.)


There is a point here.  Talking to people about homebrewing and sharing a six
pack here and there will work wonders.  I've never met a soul who wasn't
delighted to get some homebrew with their own personalized labels, and who then
didn't go out and brag about it to their friends.  Goodwill created in this
manner has many benefits; increased club memberships and decreased fear of
homebrewing throughout the community among them.  This is especially important
down here in ultra-conservative land!  Also how do you think I get all my free
cases of bottles (eagerly pre-sorted to my preferences), my new lager fridge
free, the corny set up, co2 tanks and the two regulators that have come my way?
 Spread the good word my friends, the next person you talk to may have a
brother with a warehouse full of equipment he wants to throw away.

Subject: Soda keg taste?




I would be really greatful if someone could give me some advice on a recent 
problem.  I have two five gallon batches in soda kegs that were well 
cleaned, but that now have a definite surup flavor.  I admit that in one I 
did not replace the lid o-ring, but I did in the other.  The one has a 
sickeningly sweet flavor that tastes just like the o-ring smelled(duh),  I 
have replaced it now.  Both of these kegs have the red plastic lids which 
were also scrubed with TSP, but I still think its posible that they could 
have contributed to the off flavor. Should I switch the  lids to metal ones? 
 I was also wondering if I could partly mask this nasty sweet  flavor by 
adding some hops to the keg?  How would this best be done, boiled &strained, 
or dry hoped, (ie bitter or aroma)?  Which would mask the flavor the best? 
 Please, could someone help a felow brewer.  I can't drink five gallons of 
this beer, and I can't bring myself to throw it away.


Thanks in advance, and private mail is OK.

Lately some of my non-brewing friends have asked me if I can make something
that tastes like Red Nectar Ale. It is made by the Humbolt Brewing Co in
Arcata, Ca. It is amber/red in color- I would describe the taste as fruity,
malty, and somewhat sweet. Hop bitterness definitely seems lower than most
California microbrewery products. I once saw a pamphlet from the brewery
noting that crystal malt is used. The bottles have a yeast sediment, which 
I just started culturing- growth is fairly vigorous, but I haven't smelled
or tasted the starter yet.


Does anyone out there have any more specific information on this beer, hop
variety and schedule, what type of yeast is it, etc., or a recipe? 


By the way another very nice beer from the same area as Red Nectar is 
Steelhead Extra Pale Ale from Mad River Brewing, Blue Lake, Ca. If you
see it, try some.
