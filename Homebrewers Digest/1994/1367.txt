 My name is Dave Switzer and I attend the State University of New York at
Plattsburgh.  Since I live so close to the Canadian border I hear a lot 
about the Canadian beers on the Market.  I have recently heard of a current
beer that is rich and also containing 7.3 percent alcohol.  It's called
Molson XXX.  I want to know, does the taste have a logger beer essence or
is it a watered down tasting beer such as Coors.  I would like to know in
order to decide whether to purchase it or not.  If anyone can help me out I
would greatly appreciate it.  Please E-Mail me soon because I have a planned
trip to Canada coming up and I would like to know.  Thanks alot!

Subject: Celis Grand Cru clone


Hi all,
I am interested in brewing something moderately close to Celis Grand Cru 
(incredible stuff!).  Here is the recipe as I have it so far in my mind:


     4lbs Klages 2 row Pale malt
     1lb Dextrine malt
          Infusion mash, 155 F, 1hr
     6lbs NWestern Weizen LME
     1lb Laaglander extra pale DME
          Add to kettle after mash runnings have been boiled down to a
          reasonable vol.
     25-30 IBU blend of Hallertau, Styrian Gold., and Tettnang
          Mostly for 60min boil, maybe 5 IBU in last 15 min
     0.5oz dried orange peel
     0.5oz dried coriander
          both added at end of boil
     Dilute to 5 gal of appx. 1.075 wort.
     Pitch large starter of Hoegaarden Wit yeast, and ferment in my 60F
     basement


Comments? Suggestions?


I have one specific question about whether one should mash dextrine malt or 
treat it like a specialty grain and steep it in the 170 F sparge water?


Does this sound like about the right hopping rate?
______________________________________________________________________


Just thought I'd throw in an observation about the use of hop pellets and 
keeping them out of the fermenter.  I never use hop pellets alone; I always use
some leaf hops (either as loose cones or as plugs) with the pellets.  The 
advantage of this IMHO is that when I strain my chilled wort through my 
collander into my fermenting bucket, the leaf hops form a filter bed (not 
unlike a lauter tun) in which the tiny particles from the pellets get caught.  
Using this method, I have never observed excessive particulates in my 
fermenter.


Oh BTW, you can send the comments about the Grand Cru recipe directly unless 
they are of general interest.  I'll post the final version if the beer turns 
out well. TIA

Subject: Whole Hop Pellets


Greetings:
In the past I have used 1 oz. packets of dried hop pellets; but have been
annoyed at the amount of hop sludge that they create on the fermenters bottom.
Recently I came across  whole hop pellets, packaged as two, five half oz.
segments, akin to a tootsie roll.  Are these simply hop cones/flowers that have
been compressed, or are they ground up?  If not, do I use a mesh hop bag?  They
are stored frozen, so another question is whether or not they should be
defrosted, or are they simply plunked into the boiling wort straight from the
freezer? Any advice or comments are appreciated!
Thanks

   YES, you can drill a hole in glass. I have drilled several holes in
wine bottles in the past when turning them into lamps. Well, not quite
drilling. You use a grinder made for the purpose. It looks like the
eraser end of a pencil with a rounded end, about 1/2 inch in diameter.
Just use it like a drill and lubricate with plenty of water.

Would anyone like to comment on the consequences of letting your sparge water
temperature drop too low.  We use a cooler with a false bottom, but sometimes
we run out of water to keep it topped off when sparging.  While heating new
water the temp sometimes drops to 150 F, or lower.

Subject: Follow up to hopping Scotch Ales


Thanks for all the responses to my question on hopping Scotch Ale.  It appears
that the BU given by Noonan is IBU.  After a couple of questions like "Are you
sure he didn't give oz. of hops?", I looked again.  Sure enough, further on
in the recipe he does give hop quantities in HBU.  For the case of the 140
Shilling Edinburgh Ale with a BU of 60 and utilization of 20%, the HBU is
given as 20.


I think it's time to put an order in for Wyeast 1728 and start making up a
gallon of 1080 wort.

The key words here are "hop AROMA boils away *after* about 15-20 minutes"


Rememeber that German Pilsners are quite hoppy in the nose, and this is
achieved by a hop addition at 15 minutes to cast out.  Also, the method
of trub removal/wort chilling will influence the hop aroma/bitterness
equation.

Subject: Woodruff/weissbier yeast/carboys


     Rick Dante asked about Woodruff. I suspect you're referring to 
     Sweet Woodruff which is a ground-cover/herb that is not too 
     unusual. My wife and I grow it throughout our backyard (mostly to 
     eliminate grass which requires cutting). It is traditionally used 
     as a flavoring in German "May Wine," and when it blooms in the 
     spring, we always drop some sprigs in our glasses of red wine. As 
     an herb, it has a taste similar to Tarragon (I've heard that it 
     is sometimes sold commercially as Tarragon), and we always dry a 
     little bit for use over winter (nice in chicken dishes). I never 
     heard of it for beer, but now that you mention it....why not. 
     Maybe make a "tea" to add to the wort? Incidentally, we never 
     could get it growing from seeds--finally had to buy plants, and 
     it took it several years to get solidly established. I'm planning 
     to divide some in a couple weeks, so I can plant it around the 
     bases of my new hop plants.
        Different matter--I bought some import Pschorr (sp?), that was 
     called "Pschorr-Sumthing Weissbier with yeast." It was expensive, 
     like $2 for 16 oz., but I figured I'd recover the yeast and get a 
     free starter. The beer was great and I really liked the clove 
     taste, but I couldn't get yeast to grow--I assume it was dead, 
     because I did all the normal precautions. Q--I've read that the 
     Germans demand the yeast with their Weissbier. Is the yeast 
     normally killed somehow? Or did my purchase just have a long ride 
     from Germany to Michigan? I would like to try this again, because 
     I had zero luck with Wyeast 3056.
        Shift gears again--a place called Little Ole Winemaking Shop 
     (honest), 4 S 245 Wiltshire Ln, Sugar Grove, IL 60554, 
     708-557-2523, sells 5-gallon carboys for $8 but will not ship 
     them (don't know why). It's just west of Chicago, so next time 
     you're driving a pickup that way... (no connection, blah 
     blah...).

When you're making high-gravity beers, you've either got to put up
with lower than optimal extraction rates or with large, long boils.  I
usually start my high gravity mashes with about 1 quart/lb, giving me
some leeway to raise the temperature by adding hot/boiling water (I
mash in a drink cooler).  In my experience, and with my setup, if I
take just first runnings from this, I'll get about .6-.7qt/lb of wort
at about 1.090.

Aha, a common misconception.  You don't want to measure the pH of the
strike water, but the pH of the mash itself.  The calcium in the
gypsum combines with phytins in the malt to liberate phytic acid that
drops the mash pH into the appropriate range.

Subject: More beginner questions (bitterness)


Hop bitterness extraction is complicated and depends on several
factors, some of which have to do with the hops, and some of which
don't.


There are factors that affect the actual iso-alpha acid content (IBUs)
in the finished beer, including:


1. Hop AA content.  This is related pretty linearly to bitterness, all
   else being equal.
2. Form of hops (whole versus pellets).  Pellets extract better.
3. Length of boil.  Longer boil (up to about an hour) extracts more
   bitterness.
4. Specific gravity of wort.  If the SG is over about 1.050, the
   amount of bitterness extracted from the hops goes down (Mark Garetz
   will debate this point, but it corresponds to my experience, and
   that of others).


These first four factors are the ones used in the typical formula
(such as is found in Papazian's book).  But there are more, including:


5. Vigour of boil.  A wimpy "simmering" boil won't extract as much
   bitterness as a strong "rolling" boil.
6. Yeast effects -- some amount of the bittering compounds will attach
   to and settle out with the yeast.  A quick-settling yeast will
   remove less than a slow-settling yeast.


And then there are factors that affect the perceived bitterness, even
in beers that have equal levels of iso-alpha acids (the primary hop
bittering compound).  These include:


7. Final gravity (sweetness and body) of the beer.  A light-bodied,
   dry beer will let the bitterness through much more so than a heavy,
   sweet one. 
8. Water ionic composition.  In particular, high sulfate levels will
   accentuate hop bitterness, sometimes unpleasantly.
9. Carbonation level.  All the flavors of a "spritzier" beer will come
   through more, including the bitterness.
10. Use of bitter, dark grains will contribute a non-hop bitterness.
11. Color -- a dark colored beer will typically be perceived as more
   bitter than a light colored beer.
12. Hop variety.  There are other compounds that can be extracted from
   hops that are bitter -- in particular, some of the beta acids or
   their oxidation compounds.  And the balance of alpha acids (and
   therefore iso-alpha acids) differs between hop varieties, and *may*
   affect the perceived bitter flavor.


And I'm sure there are others.

Subject: Heated mash?




All-grainers,


Does the process of mashing produce heat?


I've been using my new Gott cooler for mashing and sparging for 
about the last five batches. I've had no problems coming up with the 
right strike water temperature to arrive at the pre-determined 
conversion temperature. By this I mean, after mashing in, vigorous 
stirring of the mash for five minutes, and then a five minute rest 
to let the temperature stabilize, my mash temperature is at or within 
one degree of what I wanted. Later, however, maybe a half an hour 
later, the temperature has climbed anywhere from three to five 
degrees. I preheat the cooler with hot tap water prior to mashing 
in. Could it be that the water I'm using to preheat is too hot, or 
is the mashing process producing extra heat?


TIA,


Chuck

Subject: brewing non-alcohol beers


Greetings fellow homebrewers --
 
Has anyone out there in HBD land successfully brewed a non-alcohol
beer?  I've got a couple of good friends who are beer lovers but,
alas, can no longer drink alcohol.  I'd love to make them some
tasty n.a. brews but have never tried it.  I'm looking for any
suggestions that anybody has.
 
I suspect that the alcohol can be cooked off by bringing the already
fermented brew to just below boiling for a while, and then proceeding
with bottling as one normally would.  I seem to remember seeing
some comment about that on the HBD when I first subscribed.  My
questions are:
 
 
Most importantly, would that work?
 
Would it kill off the yeast and prevent carbonation from working?
 
Would it alter the taste?
 
Are there particularly good or bad types of beers to try this with?
 
And, is there another technique that anyone has tried?
 
 
I'm about to start a new batch and would like to try this with at
least part of it.
 
Thanks in advance for the access to everyone's collective brewing
wisdom.  If anyone would like to reply to me directly, you can send
me email at either kroeger`at`wiscps.bitnet or kroeger`at`polisci.wisc.edu.
 
Happy brewing!

Subject: NOT Pilsener Urquell!


Hi brewers!
Last week I posted a question about how and why yeast sticks to the 
bottom of the bottle (still waiting for theories, explanations, etc....) 
because I was worried about a pils with cloudy, swishy yeast.  I got a 
few useful responses about how the amount of honey that we'd used 
could affect the unaged taste and possibly create 2 cases of capped 
glass grenades.  Well, we (Kristina and I, a co-brewing couple) tasted 
the stuff over the weekend, and it's plain awful.  Here's the recipe we 
followed, straight from Papazian (p. 190, Propensity Pilsener Lager):


5 # plain light DME  (we used 6.5 # M&F plain light extract, wet)
1 # crystal malt
2.5 #  honey
2.5 oz. Saaz  (boiling, 45 min.)
 .5 oz. Tettnanger (flavor, 10 min.)
 .5 oz  Saaz   (aroma, 1 min.)
1 tsp Irish moss
1 pkg dry lager yeast (we used Red Star)
        primed with .75 cup corn sugar


        O.G.  1.052, fermented at around 40 deg. for 4 weeks
        F.G.  1.020, fermentation complete?, no bubbles for 6 days
Charlie said that this would be something like Pilsener Urquell.  No way.  
It's thick, reddish-brown, and SWEET.  The honey comes through FAR 
too strong and cloying.  As for carbonation, this stuff is already more 
bubbly and heady than any of the ales we've done.
        This stuff is so yucky that we're considering drastic action.
We'll leave a six-pack to either explode or mellow into drinkability, and 
uncap the rest and rebottle.  All I can think to do is to add a weakly 
hopped gallon of water (making the total around 5.5 gal), dropping the 
S.G. 10 points, and hopefully shifting the reddish color closer to the 
golden area of the spectrum.  Any other ideas?  Repitching some 
yeast?  Tossing in yeast nutrients?  Chucking the whole damn thing? 
Was our basic mistake in the recipe itself, i.e., too many fermentables? 
 Or were our cheapo dry yeasties the real culprits???


Speak, o fonts of constructive criticism

I too have had acceptable results with Wyeast 3056 on both extract
and all grain wheat brews.  For the record, I keep the fermentation temp.
towards the high side, 70-72 F., until the krausen settles back (about 
2-3 days), then cool down to about 66-68 F.  I've gone lower, (62-64),
but this seems to really slow things down.  The banana nose is there but
at a level that I like, but I could probably go for a little more on
the phenolic (clove) side of things.  This is why I have been promising
myself to try the 3058 next time...

Subject: growing hops


I have a question for all those hop farmers out there.  I'm getting ready
to order rhizomes that my dad will plant in his garden for me.  I have a
book on growing hops that says, in one place, that one should plant both
bittering and finishing hops and says, in another place, that one shouldn't
plant more than one variety of hops together.  I want to grow at least two
varieties.  They'll be growing in a row about 21 feet long, and I plan to
put about 9 rhizomes along that row.  Does anyone see a problem with
planting, say, 6 Cascades rhizomes and then 3 Perle Rhizomes?  Is
cross-pollenation a consern here?


On another, but similar, note, I need to figure out a way to dry the hops
when harvesting season comes.  The book I have has plans to construct this
big drying gizmo, but I don't want to get into that right now.  Can they be
dried in the oven?  How about something like a small hot-air convection
oven or a food dehydrator?


Any advice is welcome.  Private E-Mail is fine.

I strongly suspect the plastic lids.  I have all metal lids and have

Subject: Plastic bottles - The Experiment


I have decided to run the experiment.  I am going to bottle my next two
batches in plastic (PET) 20 oz. bottles.  I am doing this for two reasons. 
First, the plastic bottles will be much easier to store than glass.  There
is little or no chance of breakage when full or empty.  Second, I want to
see if the question of oxygen transport through the plastic is an issue for
homebrewing.  Apparently it is in the soda industry - BUT they typically
deal with pressures in the bottles that a homebrewer never has to worry
about.  Imagine the pressure inside a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi as it is
trucked across the S.W. desert!


Here is how I got the bottles.  Since they are mostly air (when empty!)
they are typically made in the same city that the soda is bottled (it is
much cheaper to ship the raw plastic than the finished product).  I just
found the BOTTLE  manufacturer.  They were very friendly and actually sold
me some experimental 20 oz. bottles.  A little bit of kindness on our part
went a long way.  In fact, we bought 720 bottles!  We had decided to split
the bottles between 6 people.  At 15 cents/bottle it comes to $3.60/case.  


The people at the bottle factory mentioned the CO2 diffusion problem.  They
said that the shelf life of soda is 3-4 months before it goes flat.  From a
homebrewing perspective I don't think that this is a problem.  The yeast
will slowly replenish the CO2, probably at a rate MUCH faster than it
diffuses.  I also think that the constant pressure in the bottle will keep
gasses from diffusing INTO the bottle.  At any rate, the plastic bottles
may not be such a good idea for mead, wine or any beverage that sits in the
bottle for more than 6 months.


I will post the results of my experiment.  Cheers!

reverses?  When the yeasties do really get into action you're going to be
forcing the liquid back into the "input" tube (now the output).  Doesn't
this indicate the use of one of those S-bend airlocks?  Or am I missing

The aroma of the hop oil might very well be grassy, depending on the variety
of hop used.  Some hops have an aroma that is less, shall we say, "smooth"
and
that doesn't blend as nicely as others.  Also, age will heal a lot of wounds.


A young beer that is dry hopped with Cascade smells, to my nose, like a
freshly mowed lawn; leave it age for a while and stuff blends nicely.


Lots of factors at play here!

|Subject: More beginner questions


|          1) What's the story on HBU's as in Papazians book? It seems
|          that you can get the same HBU value using different amounts
|          of hops with different AAU's, yet you come up with a
|          different perceived bitterness according to Papazian's
|          table. So, if a recipe calls for 20 HBU's you could get a
|          more or less bitter brew depending on how you achieve the
|          HBU value. I'm confused.


     Yes Virginia, there is confusion. If you boil 2 oz of 10 % alpha hops
you get the same bittering as 4 oz of 5 % alpha hops or 8 oz of 2.5 % alpha
hops. Wat effects the bitterness more is the amount of time you boil the
hops. If you boil less than 60 minutes you reduce the utilization rate thus
reducing the bitterness.


|          2) Does the vigor of the boil affect either the color
|          of the final brew, or the OG of the wort? My Pils is NOT
|          straw colored (more like red-brown) and I missed the OG by
|          10 to 15 points.


     Yes, the vigor of the boil does slightly effect the color. You run the
risk of slightly carmalizing the sugar at higher temperatures. The major
question would be did you use extract or all grain. With extract you'll
rarely get a nice straw color. Some extracts will but I haven't found one
myself. Did you use any crystal malt? How dark was it ? Use a Cara Pils
crystal next time. It's a very light malt.
     The Gravity just means you didn`t have enough malt. With all Grain
it's easy on the first batch or two not to hit the gravities. You learn to
compensate for your own brewery.


     Hopefully this helps you David and some others.

Subject: Homegrown Hop data point


This is the traditional season for hop growing questions, so I thought
there would be some interest:  My Hallertauer hop rhizome, which I planted
two years ago, has about thirty shoots, up to four inches long, as of March
6.  This is in San Jose (37.5 deg N latitude).    


It does not appear to like full sun at my location:  The west side of the
house is four feet away, and a covered patio blocks the southern sun.  Both
seasons, when the growing tip extended above the patio roof, it turned
brown and died.  The remainder of the plant flourished.


I made a primitive trellis of two pieces of water pipe pounded into the
ground.  They support some aircraft cable, each end of which is staked to
the ground.  The vines twine around pieces of twine which are tied to the
cable.


Contrary to the HBD FAQ, I planted the root horizontally, as per "Homegrown
Hops".  It seems to prefer this, because the root is spreading horizontally
over our herb corner.  It might be time to divide it.  I bought the root
from Fermentation Settlement, after trying for a couple years to grow the
scrawny "twigs" supplied by Nichols Garden Nursery.  It was very pleasant
to get a root as thick as my index finger, that "took" right away.  Another
worthwhile bit of advice from "HH" is to plant the root as early in the
season as possible in your location.  Nichols did not ship until it was
convenient for them in March, so maybe that is why they never sprouted for
me.


I would be interested to hear other people's experiences.

Subject:      Bad Taste


This is a call for help. I'm new to homebrewing, and my last four
batches have developed a definite medicinal taste. The brew is beautiful
to look at, nice head retention, not even a hint of chill haze, but that
awful taste... it's not that strong at first , but the burp taste could
remove paint. Its like fumes comming out of your mouth!
      Just a little background, I kit brew following Papazians methods,
and I pay careful attention to sanitation. After reading thru the Yeast FAQ
it mentioned that chlorine can cause yeast to give off a medicinal taste.
I use bleach to disinfect, but I was confident that I rinsed pretty good.
I haven't had my water checked (well water, but the well was drilled just
last year if that matters).
    Can anyone out there lend me there experience and guide me toward a
fix? Could it be just as simple as rinsing better? Could it be my water
is causing some kind of reaction? Maybe there is something else I don't
know about. The beer is drinkable, but all my friends keep asking me to
break out my home brew, and if my wife gets wind that I'm wasting money
on bottled crap my beer allowance could be in jeopardy.
