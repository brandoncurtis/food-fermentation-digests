Subject: Boiling the wort question???


Afew days ago in the digest someone was talking about boiling the wort so 
much as to carmalization.  What does this mean and does this happen when 
your wort is in a rapid boil for awhile.  I have a problem with my beers
I'm tring to figure out.  The beers taste good but I get alittle bit of
a sweet smell when opening the bottle
and a little bit of a sweet taste, not to bad just enough to taste it.
I don't get the bitter hop taste that I've tasted in other homebrew.  
Maybe I'm not putting enough hops in?  Maybe I'm not boiling the hops 
long enough?  I use honey all the time not corn sugar.
Can high temp. during boil carmalize the wort and add a sweet flavor?
Can honey change the taste alittle.  Don't get me wrong I'm sure my beers
are not infected with something.  Maybe it`s the extract or recipes I'm using?
Any ideas or info. anyone can give me would be appreicated. 
I boil my wort rapidly for at least an hour each time varing the hops.
Is this to much?  Thanks Todd

Another reason to "politely refuse": hop seed will NOT be genetically
identical to the parent plant, even if both parents were of the same
variety, so you will have no idea of the character of the hops you
would grow.

This is one of my favorite ale hops.  Wonderful dry-hopping hop.


A recent IPA of mine had the equivalent of almost a half pound of EKG
in 5 gallons.  It was a sort of 1-dimensional experiment: nothing in
it but pale malt and EKG.  In a January tasting (about 2 weeks after
bottling) at the local club, at least one taster thought it was
infected.  But, it took 3rd in the HWBTA, so I can't complain too
loudly.  The next one won't be quite so bombastic.  (I made this after
a judge commented on my previous effort that it didn't have enough hop
flavor.  "You want hop flavor!  I'll give you hop flavor!")

I suspect your experiment will be quite successful, particularly if 
you confine yourself to standard lagers and ales meant to be consumed 
fresh.  I base this on casual empiricism:  (1) the best homebrew I 
ever had -- an American IPA that I actually preferred to SNPA, or 
Anchor Liberty Ale -- was in a 1 litre PET bottle;  and (2) Wellington 
County Brewery, which is producing the some of finest ales in Ontario 
bottles in 1 Litre PET bottles.  However, none of these are meant to 
age.  In fact, Wellington puts a 1 month expiry date on the labels.

HBDers,


In answer to my question about the process of mashing producing 
heat, Kirk Oseid (KLO`at`fluent.com) noted that he had read a 1940's 
article which spoke of the "heat of hydration" adding 1 to 2 degF 
(depending upon the moisture content of the grain) to the mash 
temperature. Spencer Thomas (Spencer.W.Thomas`at`med.umich.edu) added 
that my calculations perhaps had not included the effect of "slaking 
heat".


Since I have experienced this with every mash I have done in the 
insulated Gott mash/lauter tun, I'll start taking readings to see if 
there is a correlation to mash size, strike water temperature, etc.

Subject: The Joy of Hop Growing


It's nice to hear the favorable stories of hop growers all over the place.
Mine are just approaching their second season (I couldn't help myself-
I had to dig down- tenderly- and see how they were doing. We had sunny 60's
yesterday, and I wanted to share it with them!)


One addition I'd make to the methods of hop planting described would be
to plant at least 2 rhizomes per hill.  The distancing, and spreading
concepts are just starting to be realized.
Reason for 2/hill:  Pests and other problems.  If one doesn't start, or is
just a weak rhizome you might not get a strong enough vine first year.
So far it seems all of mine have taken pretty well. There are numerous
sprouts just waiting to pop up.


Question:  Picking rhizomes. I know you shouldn't do it in the first year,
but... I couldn't find anything in Beach's book on harvesting rhizomes!
He talks all about his other attempts with shoots and stems, but not
about the true rhizome!  Argh.


When I dug down I did find some THICK horizontal roots. I was surprised
at how far out fromthe plant they are.  I'm afraid my cascade and mnt hood
may shake roots down there somewhere!  So,  just cut off a root fairly close
to the main stem and cut that into further divisions. Instant rhizomes!
Gave a couple to a grower-friend and saved one for me.


Question: What about damage to the main stem, or potential damage
at the wound sites on the rhizome?  Any treatment worth applying?
(like the tar stuff on tree branch- stumps)   I guess use a nice SHARP
clipper (not like the rusty dull one that sat out all winter - like I used!) 


How far down does one expect to find rhizomes?  How far down would I
need to bury a dividing wall to avoid mixing of varieties?
The other two are well contained- about 10 feet apart, but the cascade and
hood are a bit closer. They sit around a corner of the house, but they 
could reach around ( I discover!)




Anyway: For anyone thinking about getting in to it ... Go For It! Funfunfun.
It really doesn't take much effort. I don't think I'll ever be able to
rely solely on HG hops, but maybe for all my finishing!


***
Also on Home Malting, growing your own barley.  You'd have to have some
serious space!  Check the Zymurgy Grain Brewing Issue. There's an article
about making a malter.  I received an article via snail mail once with
a method for kilning different types of malt. Sounds like a fun project,
but if I can't grow enough hops for my own brewing efforts I know I won't 
be able to grow enough malt!  A couple acres, maybe we'd talk.

Subject: Bulkhead Fitting Plans


I have had so many requests for this that I thought it worth posting
for all.


                Bulkhead fitting description


A bulkhead fitting is a way of getting an attachment for plumbing on
two sides of a plate (bulkhead).  The simplest bulkhead fitting is
made with a close nipple, two rubber washers, two metal washers and
two pipe thread nuts.  Place the nipple through a hole in the plate.
Slip over a rubber washer, slip over a metal washer and then run on
the nut.  From the other side, do the same.  Tighten the two nuts
against each other to form a seal.  If the bulkhead is curved like in
a round cooler, you may need very soft rubber gaskets, but if it is
flat, the rubber can be harder.  O-rings sometimes work.  If you
cannot get pipe nuts, you can make them by buying reducer fittings.
For a 1/2" pipe nut, buy a 3/4" to 1/2" reducer.  Hold the 3/4"
threaded portion in a vise and use a hacksaw to cut off the hex nut
portion.  These are available for sale from McMaster-Carr in brass or
bronze, but I have only seen them in retail stores in pot metal which
one would *not* want to use in brewing.  The metals to be used may be
brass, bronze or stainless.  The washers should be 1/2" washers with
the hole bored out to 3/4" plus a hair to fit 1/2" pipe.




Bill of Materials


1        1/2" x close nipple
2        rubber washer or O-ring (3/4" ID)

I agree!  I'd rather have plain caps than "Real Beer" caps, but overruns
are even better (not to mention cheaper).  I can't believe that the
seemingly inexhaustable supply of "Boulder Sport" caps has finally run
out.  My homebrew shop has not had any overruns for many months --
perhaps the shift to PET bottles and cans, and the recent increase in
the number of homebrewers, means they just aren't making as many bottle
caps these days.

I've had trouble obtaining clear beer for the batches that I have kegged
(in 5 gal Cornelius kegs). I recently decided to try using gelatin finings
in the keg for an ale, and obtained much clearer beer. My latest batch is a
lager (Wyeast 2124) that has been lagering at 38 degrees in a carboy for 6
weeks. I just kegged this lager and noticed that it is quite cloudy. Is
gelatin fining recommended for a kegged lager? Polyclar? Is my clearing
problem due to the long distance through wich the yeast need to settle in a
keg? All of my bottled beers have been crystal clear, so I don't think it
is due to my mashing and brewing procedure. BTW, I always force carbonate
in the keg.

I know for a fact that PureSeal (formerly SmartCaps) bottlecaps
are not only oxygen-scavenging, but also create an O2-barrier
to keep O2 out of the bottle, just as Mark reported.  Indeed,
positive pressure of one gas will not keep another gas out of
the bottle/bag/fermenter.  It's not how gasses work.  Also,
despite the fact that CO2 is heavier than air, if you purge
a container with CO2, but then leave it sitting open for a
while (or seal it with an O2-permiable seal), the CO2 in
the container and the O2 in the air will begin to mix.  The
rate of transfer depends on the type and thickness of the
material through which the gasses must pass.  This phenomenon
is called diffusion and I'm certain all of you have heard
of it.  It is the process by which gasses (or liquids, for
that matter) move across a permiable boundary from an area
of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
This is why the CO2 will not keep out the O2 and vice versa.
It's the reason that HDPE fermenters are not good for long-term
storage of beer, especially finished beer, and why polyethylene
bags are virtually useless for hop storage.

While this may be true for keeping nasties out of the fermenter, I
want to warn anyone who might be thinking about not filling their
airlocks at all to consider the first topic of this post.  The airlock
not only is for keeping nasties out, but also to keep oxygen out.
If you don't fill the airlock, diffusion cause the concentration of
O2 in the headspace to approach that of air, especially as the fermentation
begins to subside.  Now, you can get brew good beer like this, as can be
seen with Anchor, Samuel Smiths, Liefmans, Pilsner Urquell and any number
of other breweries that use open fermenters, but then again, consider
that they transfer the beer as soon as fermentation is complete.  Exposure
to O2 after fermentation is going to create a lot of aldehydes.  If you
aren't convinced that this is bad, try some of that air-pumped Industrial
keg beer the next morning.  Does it taste good?

I completely misunderstood the purpose of Steve's design.  I thought
that he was using his device to "sanitize" are for aerating the wort.
Now, from today's post, I see that this was meant to be a "sanitizer"
for incoming air during the wort-cooling/lag period.  The diagram
above implies a small diameter blowoff hose, which I urge all homebrewers
to steer clear of.  I've had two mishaps with clogged blowoff hoses
(1/4" ID and 1/2" ID) and now only use a 1" ID (1.25" OD) blowoff
hose that goes right in the neck of the carboy -- no stopper.  Also,
the large diameter hose has the added benefit of relieving the
homebrewer from worries of water/sterilant/etc. getting sucked up
the blowoff hose.  There would have to be a huge change in temperature
and a very large headspace for the headspace air to contract enough
to pull enough liquid up the blowoff tube to make a difference.  Sure
the liquid will rise up a foot or so, but that's about it.  When the
fermentation begins, the water will come out back into the blowoff
jug.

I had a conversation yesterday with a friend who spoke about a
fermented millet seed beer he had in Mongolia. He said you just
added water to the fermented seeds and stick your long straw and
the pot. I too was puzzled and amazed and passed on the hbd
story of Mongolian Fermented Yak milk in a pouch. All this and
the great post someone put up about unusual African beers makes
me think that there should be an unusual/international beer(or
fermented beverage) FAQ if there isn't one allready. Any
interest, stories, motivated researchers of the fermented
arcane, out there ? 
On a seperate topic I've read about different flavor crystal and
other specialties can contribute depending on when they are
introduced  into the brewing process.  How can mash out
additions of crystal etc. be effectively duplicated in extract
brewing ?
 -thanks

The following article was taken from the April 1987 issue of the Foam Ranger's
Brewsletter Urquell


***************
The Beer That Made Idaho Famous or How I Mash Potatoes
                                                         by Cary Jensen


Often I am accused of being just a little mad when I introduce a beer like
Meister Potato Brau.  Comments like "what possessed you to ruin good beer by
making it with potatoes" are reliable when I talk to the uninitiated.  However,
these detractors are typically silenced with one (sometimes two) quaffs of this
'nectar of Idaho.'


I know, I know, comedian Chevy Chase once extolled the virtues of beer made
from this unglamorous tuber by proclaiming "I drink Spud and I pour it on my
suit."  Remember though, the drink 'for people who can't taste the difference'
only lived in the imaginations of drug addled comedy writers for that
particularly novel late-night TV program.


Charlie Papazian writes in "The Complete Joy of Home Brewing" that
'Fermentables produced from potato starch do not contribute significantly to
the character or flavor of beer, other than providing fermentables to be
converted to alcohol.'  He further writes that '[the] use [of potatoes as an
adjunct] is discouraged by beer drinkers justifiably or unjustifiably against
"potato beer".'


Well, it's just this kind of negative thinking which gets me started.  All I
need is for one person to say 'Yuck!  What a disgusting idea!" and there I go,
getting out the ol' brewing pot and grating up some potatoes.


As you may have guessed, if you are still with me, is that potato beer is not
for novices or the weak of heart.  It does required that you prepare a mash.
On the lighter side, though, the starch in potatoes is easily gelatinized, so
working with this unusual adjunct is less hassle than you might imagine.


When I prepare a 5 gallon batch of potato beer, I usually only use between 2
and 3 pounds of potatoes.  These I prepare by slicing thinly like potato chips,
or grating, using either a food processor or a cheese grater.  I have not
peeled the potatoes in practice only because I am terminally lazy.  You may
want to try peeling your potatoes and see if there is any noticeable difference
in taste.


The grains I prepare by submitting them to a protein rest at about 122 F for 45
minutes.  During this time I boil the shredded potatoes in a second pot.  This
boiling serves to gelatinize the starches in the potatoes, maaking them easily
converted to sugars by the active enzymes in the barley grains.  As I noted
above, potato starch is easily gelatinized; it is not necessary to boil the
potatoes prior to adding them to the mash.  However, by adding the boiling
potato soup (this is what your kitchen will smell like at first) to the mash,
you can conviently raise the temperature of your mash up to 155 F, an ideal
temperature for converting the starches to sugars.


Maintain the temperature of the mash using whatever methods you currently use
until all of the starches have been converted to sugars.  Lately this has taken
me between 30 and 45 minutes.  Use an iodine test to determine when this
conversion is complete.  Sparge as you would do with any other all grain beer,
discarding the spent potatoes, no matter how strong an urge for cooked,
shredded potato you develop during the mashing procedure.

RF61384%LTUVAX.bitnet`at`CUNYVM.CUNY.ED (sorry, no name given) asked about
Velvet stout:


   Had it.  Unimpressed.  It tastes like Miller, but EXTREMELY
astringent.  (sharp with that harsh "puckering" at the back of the jaw)
No roast malt flavor or aroma.  just that nasty astringency.
Note:  AHA guidelines consider excessive astringency a flaw in stout
(not that i have a lot of respect for AHA guidelines, but this time i agree)


  I think its likely to be a lager, adjuncted.  I give it mostly
full marks on appearance (lacks head), mostly low marks on aroma
(no good ones, no bad ones), low marks on flavor, mid-to low
drinkability.  perhaps a high 20's.  (only one flaw... astringency,
but way off style)

Hiya


I have been reading this group for 6 or so months now (through 
rec.crafts.brewing, but now I am a full subscriber), I have eight 
batches under my belt (had to get a bigger belt!  :-)), most of 
them extract, dabbling with specialty grains and I even did a 
small partial mash on my first wheat beer (also used Wyeast Wheat 
yeast, so I am hopeful for a good result - I couldn't believe it, 
I actually smelt the famous banana smell emanating from 
air-lock!).  


ANYWAY ...  sheesh some people go on ...  I never envisaged going
all-grain (just too damn expensive for the equipment - I am a
very poor post-graduate student), but I have found a place that
will sell me a tea urn for $20 (apparently they are about 20 or
30 litres = 5 or 7 gallons).  In case you don't realise this is a
stainless steel vessel, with a large thermostatically controlled
electric element in it, and a tap mechanism, that is normally
used to dispense tea.  I figure it is actually a very cleverly
disguised masher/sparger/boiler.  This could be the answer to all
my prayers!  I want to know if I have to worry about the element
scorching the wort/grains? If so, how do I get around this? Use
some sort of false bottom? I figure I can sparge by fitting some
sort of manifold to the bottom of the urn and pipe it through the
exsiting tap. Any feedback would be good.


Thanks
