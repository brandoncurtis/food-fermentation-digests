Sheesh!  I have to start proofing my posts!  What I was trying to say
yesterday was that the IBU formula in the HOPS.FAQ file and in
Papazian's book give me completely different numbers as to how much
hops I need to add to get a specific IBU value in my beer.  Who's
right?  Am I doing something wrong?


Another question.  I canned some starter cultures for the first time
yesterday, and they came out really cloudy.  Is this normal?


And lastly.  I've been reading the recipies in TNCJOHB.  They give
hops in oz. and HBU units.  Are the HBU units supposed to be the final
bittering of the beer or the amount of hops to throw into the boil?
Knowing utilization is not 100%, these values would be completely
different.

 The best area in my yard for growing hops (based on all the good
stuff here) seems to be along a E-W 4-foot high chainlink fence. Will
the (lack of) height of the fence be a problem? Or will the vines just
grow (or be easily trained) along the fence horizontally rather than
vertically?

Howdy!


I have a couple of questions for everyone out there.  


First, I'll be moving to Massachusetts (Concord area to be exact) this spring. 
Where is the nearest good source for homebrewing supplies?  I'd prefer to stay
outside of Boston if possible ;-) 


Second, I'd really like to brew a cream stout close to Sam Adams Cream Stout. 
This isn't meant to start a Sam Adams bashing thread, I just happen to really
like this beer.  Anyway, if anyone has any recipes, preferably
extract/specialty grain based, I'd really appreciate hearing from you.  I'll
post a recap of what I receive.


Thanks in advance,

There is no problem microwaving bottle caps as long as they are under

Subject: Ice brew & Alc. % Labelling


I happened to notice something the other day while I was trying to find
something paletable in Miller Light Ice (it tasted, IMNSHO, like an
aluminum flavored club soda with a little bit of hops) - The can had
quite prominently on the side, 5.5% Alc.  Now, does this strike anyone
as new, or have I just never, ever, noticed alcohol percentage labelling
on any other beers produced or sold in the states?  I know all about the
og labelling and such used in England and on the Continent (thanks to
MJ), however I thought that such labelling was outlawed in the states so
as to prevent some shmucks (like myself in college) from buying the
strongest beers just to get sloshed quickly.  Can anyone shed any light
on a possible legislation change here, is this a Texas thing (I wouldn't
be suprised), has Miller got a special permit for this, whats up?
If this is new legislation, I look forward to seeing a little more info
on the bottles of my favorite beers.

Greetings,


I've been having some problems with extract efficiency.  My last
batch was a variation of 'Isar Weizen' from _German Wheat Beer_
by Eric Warner.  My brew used 8 lbs Wheat (German) and 3 lbs Pale
Ale malt (American) and yeilded around 6.25 gals.  Now if I plug
this info into the extractf program I got out of the archives it
gives this output (just for kicks I also checked it against the
numbers given in the recipe):

Both?  At any rate my extract eff. is low.  I checked the P.H. at dough in

In HBD #1369, Steve Zabarnick sez:

                            <stuff deleted>

Maybe some help.  I had the identical problem and it was driving me
CRAZY!  I also determined that C-kegs that I'd primed for natural
carbonation served non-cloudy beer, so there was something my method of
forced carbonation was doing to cause the haze. In this case, what I
had started doing was to inadvertently oxygenate the beer during the
kegging process.


Prior to filling an empty keg, it's recommended to gently run a volumn
of C02 into it with the keg lid left unsealed.  The CO2 will sink, and
the O2 will be forced out the top and thereby purged. The reason to do
this is so that the beer picks up no oxygen during the tranfer from the
fermentation vessel to the keg.  You also want it so that the filled
keg contains nothing but CO2 in the head space.  At that stage, you're
safe to agitate and force carbonate the beer.


What I had done led to a certain amount of unpurged air in the head
space or in solution with the beer as it was siphoned in.  How much I'm
not sure but apparently enough to do harm.  With oxygen still in the
keg, as pressure was applied the unwelcome O2 was forced into
suspension along with the C02.  Oxygen in a finished beer produces
conditions favorable for the development of haze and it also
dramatically reduces shelf-life.  You likely will not see this
condition happen to bottled beer so readily.  Where the head space of
most bottle conditioned beers probably contains some amount of O2,
there is no reason to agitate the bottle or to unnaturally force any
gas into suspension.


Otherwise, I've never found the need to introduce finings into an ale
that's been given a reasonable period of time to mature.  I suspect the
reason finings are often used in traditional Brit ales is to allow
these beers to be served crystal clear even though they are often very
young when the first pints are pulled.

Subject: Hops Comments - (long, sorry)


Good Morning Group,
While I am no Hops expert, (yes, yes, thanks for all the agreement), I thought
I would comment on Andy's plea for correct formulas. 
Andy, at this time, research indicates that we are not sure there are any. We
do have several approximations, of varying complexity, and time will probably
show that Schrodinger was the closest.


Regarding the Hops FAQ, Norm told me he would be on vacation this week and is
not available for comment. Those formulas are a good approximation, and there
are others that have been posted by several HBD members. I use my own tweaked
version of Rager and Utilization tables.  They seem to work consistently for
me.


I would have liked to take up Glenn Tinseth on his experiment, but I just have
the HP15C. ;)


Here are some of my formulas, I apologize for length, but upon reflection,
figured some of the new brewers might appreciate it. It is from a file which I
wrote for a friend a while back.


*THE ALPHA ACID UNIT
The AAU is simply defined as the percentage of Alpha Acids 
multiplied by the amount used in ounces. For example, 1.5 oz of 
Perle hops (7.5% Alpha Acids) would be equal to 11.25 AAUs. If 
recipe specifies an amount of AAUs, the amount of any Hop variety 
to be used may be calculated. Usage of AAUs tends to assume a one 
hour boil as standard. But, 11 AAUs in a Pilsener is very 
different than 11 AAUs in a Stout. The gravity of the beer makes a 
big difference in the perceived bitterness of the final beer. This 
is where use of the IBU is needed.


*THE INTERNATIONAL BITTERNESS UNIT
The IBU is based upon utilization of the Hop oils, specifically 
the Alpha Acids. The Alpha Acids are isomerised into the wort 
during the boil at a rate dependent on time. This rate has been 
shown to decrease with time, peaking as it approaches 30 percent 
after boiling times of greater than one hour. 


Hops also contain other aromatic oils which are lighter and boil 
off more quickly. To incorporate these Finishing compounds to the 
beer, some Hops should be added during the last 15 minutes of the 
boil or utilized by Dry Hopping. Dry Hopping does not isomerize 
the Alpha Acids, so it does not contribute to the overall 
Bitterness character, but does give a nice hop smell and taste.  
The equations expressed below take into account the change in 
Utilization rate with time and make use of the influence of wort 
gravity to that rate. 


NOTE: The constant 7489 is for US units; for grams and liters,
      use a constant of 1000.


An IBU can be expressed by the equation: 
IBU = (Wt * %Alpha * %Util * 7489) / (VT * AG)


Where Wt is the amount of Hops in ounces, Percents are decimals, 
VT is the total recipe volume, and AG is the Adjusted Gravity.


*THE ADJUSTED GRAVITY


The Original Gravity (OG) needs to be adjusted if it is greater 
than or equal to 1.05. Rager gives the example that if the OG for 
a 5 gallon recipe is 1.048, but he's only boiling 2.5 gallons, 
then his apparent boil gravity is 1.096, or twice the OG. (That's 
twice the 0.048 part) Therefore, the 1.05 condition needs to be 
met for partial boils. This is done with the following equations.  
We need to multiply the degrees of extract by the volume ratio to 
adjust for the boil, then apply a factor of five if the GB is 
greater than 1.05. (VT is total vol., VB is Boil vol., GB is Boil 
Gravity)


GB = ((VT/VB) * (OG - 1)) + 1
If GB is greater than 1.05, 
Then: AG = 1 + (5 * (GB - 1.05)) 
Otherwise, AG = GB.


*THE UTILIZATION RATE*
Rager originally published Utilization 
numbers in the Zymurgy Special Issue on Hops and Beer. These 
figures have been critiqued for lack of references and being too 
optimistic. Mark Garetz of Hoptech has published other Utilization 
numbers based on information from Gail Nickerson of the Department 
of Agricultural Chemistry at Oregon State University. She has 
published many studies on Hops to the Journal of the American 
Society of Brewing Chemists.


Garetz's utilization numbers take into account the effect of the 
yeast scrubbing out the isomerized Alpha Acids and other Hop 
compounds during fermentation. This factor is expressed in terms 
of the relative flocculation rate of the yeast being used. The 
faster the yeast settle out, the less time for them to scrub out 
the hop compounds. One way to describe this effect is to note the 
manner in which bottled beer mellows as it ages. The remaining 
active yeast gradually scrubs the harsh edge out of the bitterness 
profile.


Additionally, it has been argued that boil times of less than 10 
minutes do not allow significant isomerization of the Alpha Acids 
to take place. It has also been argued that boil time greater than 
50-60 minutes do not accomplish any more utilization. Here are 
revised Utilization numbers previously published by Mark Garetz. 


Boil Time     Rager     Avg Yeast   Fast Yeast   Slow Yeast
<5 min         5%          0%          0%           0%
6-10           6           0           0            0
11-15          8           1           1            1
16-20         10           4           5            3
21-25         12           6           7            5
26-30         15           11          13           9
31-35         19           13          16           11
36-40         23           16          19           13
41-45         27           19          23           15
46-50         28           20          24           16
>50           30           21          25           17


The homebrewer has two choices: a) use the Rager numbers like 90% 
of homebrewers do, or b) use Garetz/Nickerson numbers which may be 
more real. Its up to you. The difference is not great.


Final Note: Glenn Tinseth noted yesterday that boil times of greater than an
hour have been shown to contribute to Utilization. I consider him to be more
knowledgable than myself, so will take his word for it. But, I limit my boils
to an hour as a matter of time management anyway. I would be greatly interested
to get Utilization data for 60 to 90 minutes though, more data is always good.

Maintain the temperature of the mash using whatever methods you currently use
until all of the starches have been converted to sugars.  Lately this has taken
me between 30 and 45 minutes.  Use an iodine test to determine when this
conversion is complete.  Sparge as you would do with any other all grain beer,
discarding the spent potatoes, no matter how strong an urge for cooked,
shredded potato you develop during the mashing procedure.


The recipe I have included below, for those who are ready to take the plunge,
requires the use of malt extract in addition to grains.  If you wish to make
'Spud' from scratch, replace the 3 pounds of extract with 4-5 pounds of
additional malted grains.


Meister Potato Brau (for 5 gallons)


5 pounds 6-row domestic barley malt, crushed
2.5 pound grade A Idaho potatoes (washed and grated)
3 pounds M&F pale unhopped malt extract
1/3 oz Burton salts
1 tsp. Irish Moss
1.25 oz Hallertauer leaf hops
1 oz Cascade leaf hops
ale yeast
sugar (or whatever) for priming


Mash the grains and potatoes as described above, adding the Burton salts to the
grains in the first step of the two-step mash.  When conversion is complete,
sparge with 170 F water.  Bring the collected liquor (and additional water to
give ~6 gallons volume) to a boil and remove from the heat.  Add the extract
(if used) then return to the stove.  Once boiling resumes, add the Hallertauer
hops.  Boil for a half hour, then add half the Cascade hops and the Irish Moss.
Boil for an additional half hour, add the remaining Cascade hops and remove
from the heat.  Let the wort sit for a couple of minutes to let the finishing
hops steep.  If you have the means, achieve a quick cold break  with your
favorite method.  This is fairly important for a clear potato beer since a good
deal of proteins are present in the wort.


I suggest a two-stage fermentation since the aforementioned proteins will
produce a sizable amount of sediment at the bottom of your primary fermenter.
Rack into a secondary fermenter when active fermentation subsides.  Bottle
after another 4 to 12 days, adding your priming material at this time.  Wait a
couple of weeks, then enjoy!


One or two caveats are in order here.  First, contrary to Charlie Papazian's
description, beer made from potatoes does have a unique character.  Although
this may derive from the fact that I do not peel the little spuds before I
shred them, I seriously doubt it.  After having made 3 batches of the stuff
over a several year period, I have come to notice a distinctly 'potato' aroma
and taste.  I'm not implying that this sensation is unpleasant, just that it
exists.


Secondly, when serving your end result to the unsuspecting do not, I repeat, DO
NOT, tell them what is in it until they say 'Gosh, this is great!!'.  Only then
is it safe to reveal your dark secret.


If they say 'Blechhh, what is this sh__', tell them that you found the recipe
in Uncle Bubba's old work jeans after he passed away and that you promise never
to make it again.  Tell them anything but the truth.  Average people tend to
fly into a violent rage if they think that you have given them 'spoiled' potato
beer.


In fact, though, I think that you will be pleasantly surprised by your beers
made with potatoes.  I have, and so have others.  My first potato beer, Meister
Potato Brau, was awarded a bronze certificate in the AHA Nationals in the
Pilsner category in 1985 and a 3rd place in the Dixie Cup in the Novelty Beer
Category (even though it was, gulp, 18 months old).  My most recent attempt,
Spud, took second place in the Specialty Beer category of the Foam Rangers 1987
Club Competition.


So try it, you'll like it.  In fact, take it one step further and make a Potato
Stout or a Sweet Potato Stout for that matter.  Try a Green Potato Beer for St.
Patrick's Day (use green food coloring, not green potatoes!).  Why not try
adding dried potato flakes to your already steeping mash? (I have indeed
considered this interesting twist.  Obviously, though, you would not add 2
pounds of flakes since that would be enough to make mashed potatoes for the
entire Houston Astros Baseball team - including seconds.  Try a couple of cups
and see where that gets you.  Be aware, however, that some consider this
suggestion blasphemy; you are already walking on thin ice using fresh
potatoes)?


But most of all, remember:  potato beer is good for whatever ales you!

Greetings, Oh Collective Consciousness on the Net. 


I realize that the answer might be RDWHAHB, but....


I'v had a fermentation going in a batch of extract-based SNPA clone.  I used
the SNPA yeast, and have had a good fermentation for over 10 days!  But the
head (krauesen) still hasn't gone away.  My questions:


1)  Is everything okay?


2)  Should I keep on waiting until the kraeusen falls back in before I rack?


3)  Is this long of a fermentation good or bad, or what?


I realize that this is not a crisis, but I would really like to understand
what's going on....

Following the current thread on unusual alcolholic beverages from around
the world, here is a paraphrased anecdote that appeared in a recent
Chemical and Engineering News (January something or other):


It seems that in the Seychelles Islands, a visiting physician was
puzzled by an epidemic among the locals of various fractured bones and
contusions.  Most puzzlingly was that the patients would not talk about
how they acquired their injuries.  After winning the trust of some of
the local folk, the doctor eventually learned that these patients were
"moonshiners" of a certain degree.  The Seychelles have a very high tax
on alcohol, so to get around this, the locals ferment coconut milk,
while it is still in the coconut attached to the tree.  (The article did
not go into specifics, but one could imagine boring a hole into a
coconut and pitching in some source of yeast.)  The moonshiners would
then return after a week or so and suck the alcohol out of the coconut,
and every so often fall on the way back down.  The local police are hip
to this, but unless the hapless tree climber incriminates themself, they
cannot do anything about it.


Makes me glad that my beers are in my basement, I just can't get much
lower than that. :)

Subject:  Recipe: Cat Claw Wheat


        Here's a recipe for a wheat beer I brewed recently.  It has a
golden orange color and a nice tang to it.  Enjoy.


                Cat Claw Wheat*


        15 pounds of wheat malt
        10 pounds of pale 6-row malt


        1.5 oz. of fresh '93 cascade whole hops
        0.75 oz. of fresh '93 tettnanger whole hops


        3/4 # Laaglander light DME
        Wyeast #3056


1. Make a starter with the 3/4 # of DME and 1 gallon of water.  Boil
down to 3/4 of a gallon and cool with an airlock in place.  Pitch a
_well puffed_ pack of 3056.  Let this go for two days.


2. Preheat the mash chest with a quart or two of boiling water.
Empty preheat water and mash in the grains with about 5 gallons of 140 F.
to hit a protein rest around 122 F.  After about ten minutes, withdraw
4 quarts of liquor from the bottom of the mash, bring to a boil, and add
back to the mash.  (This was to hold temp., you might not have to).


3. After another ten minutes (20 minutes total protein rest), use about
4-5 gallons of boiling water to hit around 155 F.  Hold for 45 minutes.
Additional boiling water can be used if necessary, but should be 
avoided if possible.  (I like to hold the extra H20 for sparge if 
I can).  You can also withdraw a gallon at a time, bring to a boil,
and return it to the mash (2-3 times max.) to hold temp.  (Yes, I
know that I'm over the 1 qrt./#grain recommendation...)  


4. Sparge right into the kettle using 7 gallons of 175 F. water.
Go right to the boil (that's right, no mashout) and skim off the 
gray oily foam that comes to the top (subsides after 5-10 minutes).
 
5. Boil down to 13.5 gallons and add the cascades.  Boil for 60
minutes.


6. Turn off heat and add the tettnanger.  Let steep for about
15-20 minutes.  Run through cooling unit to yield three four-
gallon cuts to three 5 gallon fermenters.  OG on my last run
was 1.056.


7. Pitch 1 qrt. of well mixed starter to each fermenter.  Ferment
at 70 F. for 2-3 days, until things settle down.  Lower temp to
67-68 and ferment for another 11-12 days (total 2 week ferment).
I use the brewcap system (except for stouts!) and tap the yeast 
that settles.  Final gravity should be around 1.015 to 1.018.


8. Siphon to keg, chill to 45 F. and C02 at 2.6 volumes (30 psi 
til it won't take any more, then go to about 17 psi).


9. Bottle and age for at least three weeks.  It's good off the keg
right at day 0 but improves mucho by day 21!


Comments:


1. I'm finding more and more uses for Cascades!
2. It's called "cat claw" wheat because of an incident that occurred
while brewing.  Both the cat and dog (65#shepard) are allowed to 
watch the brewing process but are not allowed to cross the line from
the den into the workshop area.  They normally are content to sit side
by side and share the dooorway.  For some unknown reason (this batch 
smelled particularly good??), a fight broke out and the dog bought
a mean shot from the cat on the nose.  I couldn't call it whining
pooch wheat, could I??
3. Don't fear the high wheat to pale ratio as far as a stuck mash drain.
I had no problem whatsoever and even had to slow the drain rate down 
so as to not sparge too quickly.  (I use a 6' X 1/2" slotted coil
as my manifold).
4. EXTRACT BASED.  I've made a good extract based wheat using the same
proportion of hops/time schedule and 3.3 #'s of Northwestern Lq. Extract +
4 #'s of light DME (domestic-Red Bank Brewing).  << 5 gallon batch!!!

I tried this one on rec.crafts.brewing, but got no responses. Hope someone

I was in Pittsburg at the Allegheny Brewing Company and had what they called
a "Kaiser". It was a lager, cloudy white (like a Celis White), highly
carbonated and a good hop flavor (dry hopped or very late boil hops). It was
unfiltered and very tasty. It is one of their specialty beers (not available

Subject: Pallpark IBUs


Hello everyone,


        In HBD #1369, Andy Patuszak asks about IBU calculations.  He
says he is confused since there is more than one approximation
availible.  He states that a Table  of % utilization and HBU for beer
styles would be easier.
        Andy, these various formulas are each author's attempt to model
this very table you speak of.  I don't have the formula I use with me
or memorized, but if you combine terms, HBU is one of the variables!
        We must remember that these equation are only a way to
approximate IBUs, they are our *best guess*.  Find a formula you like
and stick with it.
        For people who don't want to get envolved with IBUs, I suggest
a simple APPROXIMATION.  It will only get you in the *ballpark*.  Also
the errors become much greater with boil gravities > 1.050.


        IBU = 15 * HBU / GALLONS        (assumes full volume boil)
or        HBU = IBU * GALLONS / 15


        Again this is just a quick and dirty approximation.  Sure
there are better ones and more complex, but I use it for quick way to
determine how many IBUs in a recipe that is given in HBUs.  It is my
starting point and it seems to work fine.
        I do recommend using IBUs since it remains constant for a
given style in any volume, HBUs don't.

more work for the court.  Same with UPS.  If you pack the bottles well
(read r. Wigglesworth article in the spring '91 Zymurgy: Packing Your

shipping glassware and it was packed extra good.  They just smiled and

Subject: Brewing Water


I'd like to share my experiences with brewing water.  
As described in earlier posts, I have been trying to eliminate chlorine in my
brewing water.  Since I only boil two gallons of my water I became concerned
about the quality of the other three.  I used to purchase three one gallon
jugs of spring water from the grocery store.  This worked quite well, except
that I ended up with three large plastic jugs to either recycle or throw
away.  
  Just recently I purchased a Brita Water Filter system from the local
discounter for about 20-30 dollars.  This is a unit with about 2 gallons
capacity through which water is poured into and the water then passes a
de-ionizing filter.  According to a leaflet enclosed with the filter it will
do the following: If the influent water has a free available chlorine level
of 2.0 ppm it will be reduced to 0.2 ppm.  If the influent water contains 860
particle/ml it will be reduced to 17 particles/ml.  If the influent water has
a temporary hardness (as CaCO3) of 210 ppm it will be reduced to 70 ppm. 
This is data from the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF)
  The most important technical detail for me is the removal of the chlorine. 
>From a subjective standpoint, the filtered water tastes a lot better than my
tap water, so that is a move in the right directions for me.  The filters
will handle 35 gallons of water before they should be replaced.  
  I'm not concerned with hardness removal because I always use some malt
extract in my brewing and I feel that that will provide enough of the
necessary minerals unless I'm doing a pale ale.
  That's all for now.  I hope this has been of some value.  Next time I will
describe how I carry out wort aeration.

Subject: Intro and Wort Chilling


I am writing to you through the No Tarmac brewboard of whom John DeCarlo is
the sysop.  He is based in Arlington, VA.  John is kind enough to provide
copies of the HBD for d/l to one and all at no cost.  Thanks, John. 
I'm going to take a moment for self introduction.  My brewing experience is
of 2 years duration with extract and partial mash extracts.  My main goal in
brewing is to maximize the time I spend enjoying my homebrew.  I enjoy the
brewing process and learning about it and its associated activities through
HBD, Brewing Techniques and other sources.  Simplicity and flexibility are
key in brewing.  Also, reducing costs.  The less the ingredients cost, the
more I can brew.  I enjoy reading the digest.  However, I don't spend much
time with the debates on the very fine points of brewing.  I think, that I
should contribute something here.  For those of you who find my posts of
value, great.  For those of you who don't, just scroll on by. 
Wort Chilling-------------------
   I use a 16 qt. SS brewpot.  I put in 2 gallons of water and add my malts
and boil with hops according to schedule for 60 minutes.  At the end of 60
minutes I carefully remove my hop bags and replace the lid.  I place my
brewpot in my sink along with 4 1 qt ziplock bags.  The bags are prepared in
advance of brewing by filling them with 1qt of water and freezing them.  I
fill the sink with water until the brewpot just begins to float. 
Periodically, I spin the brewpot and change the water in the sink.  It takes
me about 15 minutes to chill the wort from just below boiling temperature to
about 100F even in the Summer.  The volume of wort in the brewpot is about
1.8 gallons.  I pour three gallons of refrigerated water in my carboy and
then add the wort.  The temperature of this mixture is about 70F.  So in a
very clean and rapid fashion I achieve proper wort temperature.  This has
worked very well for me.  I plan to post something on my brewing water next
time.

Subject: Sanitation


Continuing on with my contributions to the HBD, I'm going to describe the
methods I use for sanitation.  I used to use dilute chlorine bleach solutions
in carboys and on equipment.  This did not work very well at all.  I had a
couple of batches which had off flavors which I can only relate to chlorine
residue.  As everything that I have read, says that chlorine and homebrew
don't mix, I've abandoned bleach.  I used to use B-Brite and rinse.  But, I
think rinsing with potable tap water negates the sanitizing effects of the
B-Brite. 
I am now using 70% ethanol.  I purchase 190 proof grain alcohol and 80 proof
generic vodka at the liquor store and mix the two.  According to my
calculations this produces an 67.5% ethanol solution.  To sanitize a carboy,
I pour in 3-4 oz. of alcohol, shake, and let stand.  Before I add anything to
the carboy, I drain the alcohol into a cup, and then add my wort or fermented
beer.  This has worked without a hitch so far.  The alcohol in the cup can be
used to fill an airlock or for sanitizing other equipment.  
I also bought an 99 cent spray bottle from the K-mart cosmetics department
which I keep filled with 70% alcohol as well.  It is very convenient for
surface sanitizing, especially during yeast manipulations. I recently saw a
post from someone on the HBD who suggested that one obtain "denatured"
alcohol from a lab for home use.  I hope this person meant "UNdenatured"
alcohol.  The denatured alcohol is rendered unfit for consumption by the
addition of toxic or unpalatable chemicals.  SDA-23A alcohol contains acetone
for example and is used topically for cosmetics, especially, nail polish
remover.  I think the Merck Index lists all of the grades available.  
Next time, I'll share my experiences with brewing water.

Subject:      Commercial Chocolate Beer


     In between batches of bottled brew, so I had to stop at the grocery the
other evening for a sixpack.  While looking for something interesting to try,
I came across "Michael Shea's Black & Tan", which is described on the package
as a union of porter and lager, brewed with dark chocolate.  Well, having read
so much about chocolate beers I simply couldn't resist.  And, to my suprise,
it actually tasted pretty good.  So now that my interest in chocolate brews is
peaked, I have a question for those of you who have tried it:
    This beer, brewed with "dark chocolate" was a tad more bitter than I would
prefer.  Is is possible to brew with milk chocolate instead, and would this
taste difference transfer to the finished brew and create a slightly sweeter
product?  For a 5gal extract batch (with some supplemental grains) what is a
reasonable amount of chocolate to begin with?
    Input from you "sweet tooth" homebrewers would be most appreciated; the
more interesting or unusual responses will be summarized and posted.
    Thanks...

For those of you wanting to make rootbeer, try this one out.  I haven't tried it
yet,
PLEASE let me know how it turns out.  (BTW, my first post to the HBD).  Recipe
courtesy of Compuserve Wine Forum, spikenard description courtesy Grolier's
Encyclopedia.


INGREDIENTS:
 5 qt water                                  1/4 oz hops
 1/2 oz burdock root, dried                 1/2 oz yellow dock root, dried
 1/2 oz sarsaparilla root, dried        1/2 oz sassafras root, dried
 1/2 oz spikenard root, dried*                1 1/2 cup sugar
 1/8 tsp yeast, granulated


PROCEDURE:
 Simmer herbs in water for 30 minutes. Add sugar, stir to dissolve, and
 strain into a crock. Cool to lukewarm, add yeast, and stir well. Cover
 crock and leave to ferment for about an hour. Bottle and store in a cool
 place. Makes about one gallon.


*The American spikenard, Aralia racemosa, of the ginseng family, Araliaceae, 
is a plant native to the eastern United States. A decoction of the root was 
used by Indians for backache, rheumatoid arthritis, and coughing. 
 
 *** Notes included with the recipe:  "Root beer extracts, usually in
 an amount suitable for five gallons of beverage, are available from
 Hires, Schilling, and other herb and spice purveyors. These yield a
 drink that's very close in flavor to commercial root beers. Making
 your own infusions, however, allows for experimentation and a
 distinctive 'house' brew. Ours is less sweet than most."
