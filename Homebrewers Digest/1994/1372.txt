Subject: Beer stuff


Some of you may remember my posting about a Marzen I brewed a
while back where I scorched the mash (while doing a step
infusion mash).  For the record, the scorched taste was much
more noticeable when fermentation was complete, but mellowed
substanially with time until it more or less completely
disappeared.


I made another Marzen, this time with a double decoction mash.
It is still ferementing.  At this point all I can report is that
during the lag time the wort was so clear you could read through
it.  I'm dying to see how it turns out.


Recently I also did a triple decoction mash on a Pilsner, using
Bavarian Pils malt and the new Czech Pils yeast from Wyeast.
The triple decoction mash was very time consuming, about six
hours for the mash alone.  This was quite an involved process as
I mashed in at cold tap water temps, infused with boiling water
to raise it to acid rest temps (approx 97 F) and then proceeded
with the decoctions.


The grain for the Pilsner, as well as the grain for a pale ale I
did recently, was ground with a JSP Malt Mill that is available
at a local homebrew shop.  While I haven't done any objective or
quantitative comparisons, subjectively I prefer the crush
provided by the malt mill over my corona.  While I will probably
continue to use my corona for some time, this experience has
strengthed my desire to one day own my own Malt Mill.


I can not remember if I mentioned it in a previous post or not,
but my first attempt at making sake has been a resounding
success.  The first batch was made as per Eckhardt's book, and
is in my not so humble opinion, excellent.


Currently, I'm looking for ways to increase the volume of beer I
brew per session.  I've considered ring burners and such like,
as well as only doing a partial boil and spliting the wort
between two batches.  I might try using the same wort and two
different yeasts to produce different beers.  I would be
interested to hear other people's experiences in this regard.


I am also interested in making a Maple Wheat beer, not unlike
that brewed by the Niagra brewing company.  If anyone has any
experience brewing with maple syrup, it would be most
appreciated. I am more interested in hearing from people who
have brewed *and* consumed some or all of at least one batch.  I
want an idea of how much syrup I should add to for what degree
of maple flavor.  Cost is not, at least initially, a concern.

Subject: Where should I plant my hops?






Hello Hop Farmers!




I too want to grow hops this year. I'm thinking of getting Cascade,
Centennial, Mt. Hood, Nugget, Perle, and Tettnanger rhizomes.
Anyways I have a big dilema: Where to put them.


1. Front of the house seems ideal for the hops. It faces South and is in
full face of the sun until the houses across the street block it at
the end of the day.  But a 25 foot pole sticking up might stand out.
The neighbors might not like it. The Landlord might not like it.


2. The Backyard faces North. A 12' X 35' trellis already exists extending
out of this north wall but it is only 8' high. It's all (rubbly)
concrete underneath except for 35' X 2' dirt flower area (no flowers
there now) right next to the wall.  Obviously the overhead lattice is
huge, but I'm concerned about the 8' height.


3. At the northeast corner of the house there is a 9' X 9' square of dirt
just past the overhead trellis.  If I planted here I could nail a 15'
pole extending from the top of trellis and run string down to the hop
hills on the  9' X 9' square.  This square is somewhat exposed to the
south.  The problem here is a pole sticking 15' past the roof might be
noticible to the people next door, though it might not be too
noticible.


4. Past the trellis in the backyard is a fence and below the fence the
hill is covered with thick iceplant. I could painstakingly clear some
of this out, plant hop hills and nail 5' poles to the top of teh
trellis and run string down to the hills. This would be 25'. THe house
will block its sun eventually (except for the vines reaching 5' above
the roof).


What should I do? Where should I plant the rhizomes??

Subject: Floating Thermometers


Some time ago there was discussion about how to make a floating
thermometer.  On a recent trip to my brew supplier I saw some
for sale.  They look quite similar to the thermometers you'd
use in a fish tank.  The ones I saw are made by True Brew, and
cost about $4.  So for those who want one, they exist.

Subject: Broken bottle when capping!


Well, I was bottling my beer this weekend, and on the third to last
bottle, the neck broke in my capper!  I've never experienced this
before - has anyone else out there?  Some data points - I had about
half refillable bar bottles and half non-refillable microbrew bottles
(Sam Adams, Celis, Dominion, etc.).  The one that broke was one of
the non-refillables.  Also, my capper is one of the double-lever kinds.


I was just starting to become convinced that the non-refillable brown
long necks were just as good as the others, especially after reading
it in a Zymurgy article in the current issue, but now I'm not so sure.
Does anyone out there agree with me that it was probably the bottle?
Would it be less likely to happen with a floor model capper?  Or was
this just a fluke that could happen to any bottle with any capper?


Also, I refuse to get worried when I think to myself "if this bottle
can't stand the force of my capper, will it withstand the force of
carbonation?" - but the thought does continue to pop up!

When I keg, I use a sterilant that does not need a rinse, it is iodine based,
and after I scrub it out with hot water, I fill the keg up with the
sterilant.  Then I cap the keg, and after waiting at least ten minutes for
the sterilization to take place, I drive the sterilant out with CO2.  Then I
open the keg to rack, and I am racking into a CO2 environment, no
Oxigenation, no cloudy beers.  The force carb is better for a non cloudy
beer. I have been told that if you naturally carb (prime) then the "extra"
fermentation that takes place to get your carb causes the yeast involved to
flocculate into sediment on the bottom and can give you a cloudy beer.  With
a force carb and a good rack, i.e. leave the sediment behind in the
fermenter, your beer should look almost as if it were filtered.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Lactic Acid


I am one of the crazy ones who wants to start making belgian ales.  My
question is: Is there a place I can purchace lactobacillus (lactic acid
bacteria) or do I need to create it by souring lactose?
The reason I am asking is that I am very interested in creating a
Flander's Brown or Belgian Red which could use the introduction of
lactic acid during a secondary fermentation.  I could be incorrect on
this though.  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I find this rather odd, so I'm hoping that you all can help me.  I

gallons and dilute down method.


Well, I used one can of M&F Wheat and a bag of Northwestern Weizen,
made five gallons.  My O.G. was 1.030.  It seems low.  Sholdn't I have

That and you might be brewing yourself into the ground (or your 
brewer, if you dont brew the beer).  Think about how fast 1/2
BBl of beer goes.  Yields 12 gallons, maybe 15-18 if you do 
high gravity brewing.  Say thats one 1/2 BBl per batch.  Now, 
how many tanks do you need, how many days to ferment one batch?
Say a 7 day beer, you brew every day (!), and filter since 
you are pushing young beer.  So, you need 5-7 fermenters, and
you only make 7 kegs of beer per week?  At 7 hours per brew,
plus 2 to filter, you can look forward to 63 hours in the
brewhouse alone! 


You wont make much money
this way, and whoever the brewer is will hate it.  Its a lot
better to put in at least a 5BBl brewery even if the clientel
is "Pabst swillers".  AS soon as you open a "brewery", the 
beer snobs come out of the wood work!


Good luck,

A friend of mine adds ice to his hot boiled wort to cool it off quicker
and to make the up the extra volume need (partial mash w/ extracts).
He puts hot water from his tap into sanitized containers & freezes. He
feels that most of the oxygen and chlorine has been forced out of the water
by the water heater. Does anyone know if his assumptions are correct?


Does anyone know of any wholesale suppliers will sell bulk grains/extracts

Subject: What have I brewed??




Hi,
        I recently read a few threads about yeast culturing and
thought that it would be interesting to try it myself. So I looked in
my fridge to see what beers I had that I could take a culture from. In
the end I chose a Chimay (the kind with the blue metal cap) and
started a culture. Within a few days I appeared to have succeeded
judging from my bubbling airlock. Anyway, when it came to make up some
wort into which I could pitch this culture all I had was a 2lb can of
EDME SFX malt extract and 1lb of crushed malted wheat. So I did a
partial mash, boiled with 1/2 oz of Hallertauer and came up with a
gallon (imperial) of wort at SG 1064. I cooled, aerated and pitched.
Racked after a week and kept it in the 2ndry for another two weeks. I
guess that the fermentation temp was somewhere between 14 and 17 C. I
then bottled with just under 1/4 cup of sugar.


        It tasted quite good at bottling and was quite a dark brown
colour, but I couldn't really say what it tasted like (in terms of
beer style) as I haven't really tasted too many of the Belgian styles.
Anyone want to have a guess at what I've got?? Its been in the bottle
now for a week so I think I'll give it least another couple of weeks
before trying properly.

Subject: Whiff of Banana


Ok, I haven't been paying attention. What is the prognosis for a 
brew now in secondary ( 4 days) which produces a hint of banana-like odors
when sniffed? I know this has been discussed. I'm making a Victorian
Bitter and am using Wyeast British Ale yeast A04. The aroma is not strong
nor is it unpleasant, at least as of the moment. However, the possibility
of infection with unwanted beasts comes to mind, particularly since I made
one tiny, but mistaken step in my sanitizing procedures and I forgot to 
immerse my racking cane and siphon tube--I sanitized their insides, but forgot
to sanitize their outsides--and I am afraid I may have infected the cool
wort on transfer from the boiling kettle. Also I notice a collection of
yeasties clinging to the side of the carboy, low down above the usual mass
at the bottom. Looks like a series of little light colored whitish drips of
wet paint. This all says " infection!!" to me. Any opinions, experience or
knowledge of this out there?
regards,
bruce

Subject: Bad batches of beer


Rick Gontareck talked about a spruce beer that took a long time to mature:


I have some brewing friends that I can bring to tears by reminding them 
of the batch they thru out. It was a Trappist style ale and when they racked
to secondary it tasted foul and they decied to dump it. But they wanted to 
take it to the homebrew club's "troubleshooters corner" to find out the 
problem, so they grabbed a handy bucket (un-sanitized), filled it up; 
took a bottle (also unsanitized) and held it under until it filled and 
capped it. It was placed in the fermentation fridge to bring to the next 
meeting but was forgotten.


Six months later as joke they gave it to somebody to drink and it was great!
They claim it was the best beer they had made and 15 gallons of it when down
the drain.

Subject: Homebrew U




          Thought I'd provide a brief report on Homebrew U, a one-day 
          seminar held in Seattle every March with well-known homebrewing 
          experts/brewers.  This years event was held on March 12th, with 
          about 300 people attending.  Main speakers were:  Roger Mussche, 
          Belgian yeast/lambic expert, Dave Miller, author and brewer; 
          Randy Mosher, H.B., author; and Byron Burch, author.  The brewers 
          from Pike Place Ale, Thomas Kemper, and Big Time Brewpub also had 
          a panel Q&A session.  The seminar is organized by Liberty Malt 
          Supply/Pike Place Brewery/Merchant du Vin Importers all owned in 
          whole or part by Charles Finkel (disclaimer, etc.).
          
          An excellent lunch was prepared by local chefs, as well as 
          several beer samples to accent the food (or was it the other way 
          around?).  Beers included: Pinkus organic Weizen, Ayinger Ur-
          Weisse, Lindeman's Framboise Lambic, Brasseurs, MacAndrews Scotch 
          Ale, Pike place IPA, Rauchbier, Pike Place XXXXX Stout, Sam Smith 
          Taddy porter, and Traquair House Ale (barleywine).  They also 
          broke out a few cases of Lindeman's Grand Cru Renee Lambic 
          Gueuze, which Dr. Mussche had brought with him from belgium to be 
          wholesaled by Merchant du Vin.  They didn't even have labels on 
          them yet!
          
          Afterward, many attendees worked their way to the Liberty Malt 
          store to taste Pike Place Ale and barleywine, as well as chat 
          with the speakers and others in the audience, including Mr. Sake, 
          Fred Eckhardt and the brewer from Portland Brewing Co.
          
          To be honest, some of the talks were kind of dry (unless you're 
          already into mead), but all in all, it was well worth the $55 
          fee.  See ya next year!

Subject: First timer questions


Having just procurred the necessary equipment to brew my first batch, I find
myself with a couple questions that I would sure appreciate answers to.


I will be using a 5 gallon carboy, closed w/blow-off, single stage process,
starting with a Coopers real ale kit (3.75#) and an additional 3# of bulk
laegander light (syrup). This "recipe" was suggested by the brew supply store.
I plan to ignore the instructions in the kit since they don't agree with what
I've read and call for lots of white sugar. I do not plan to use any sugar
(except some corn sugar for pitching to bottles).


1) What's the best way to store my 3# of bulk malt extract syrup since I won't
   be starting for a week or two? Does it need to be refigerated? Does it hurt
   to be refigerated? How sensitive is it to contamination (it's stored in a
   foam container with plastic lid)?


2) Does it make much difference how much water is used in the wort considering
   that I'll be adding the wort to water anyways? Obviously I'm not going to
   try and boil syrup; I'll probably add about 1.5 gallon water - my concern is
   how do I make sure that I don't put too much water in the carboy, and then
   not have enough room in the carboy for all of the wort.


3) I know that fermenting is sensitive to temperature, but how senstive?
   My basement seems to be about 58 degrees F. Is this too cold? What about
   right after after bottling? What about storage?


4) How do I get a hydrometer sample out of the carboy? siphon? Should I worry
   about SG for my first batch, or should I just let it blow a couple days and
   then let it ferment a couple weeks?


Thanks in advance.

I am a new boy to this hobby, actually, I haven't even started yet.  I am 
however, an emense fan of fine beer.  After having lived in Germany it is hard
to find a beer in the U.S. that fits my tastes and imports are often unfresh.
I have three questions:
1)  Is it possible to brew a fine beer at home (up to my european standards)?
2)  How much would a good kit cost?  What would be best for my desires?
3)  Where do I purchase supplies?  Do you have any mail order addresses?

Subject: First Batch Paranoia


After reading this digest for a while, I finally have summoned enough
courage to start my first batch.  I am using a M&F premium kit to
which I have added (per the instructions) 1.5 lbs of Amber DME.
I boiled 2 gallons of wort, then added cold water up to 5 gallons
in the fermentor.  After cooling I added to supplied yeast by
sprinkling on top and stiring.  
The OG was 46.  I ptiched the yeast at 9pm, and by the next 
morning, it was really bubbling.  Vigorous fermentation continued
for 2 days then slowed down.  I tookn SG reading 4 days into the the ferment 
I took an SG reading that read a little over 20.  This beer should have a FG 
of 10.  
2 days later the SG is right at 20.  Is this beer stuck?  
It is still very dark (it is supposed to be an amber ale).
There is some gunk stuck on the sides of the fermenter (It is a
plastic bucket with an air lock on top).  Is this yeast, and if 
so does it need to be reincorporated into the wort.  I assume it
got there when the krasen (sp?) died down.
If the beer stays at 20, will it be drinkable?
Any help to these paranoid rantings will be greatly appreciated.
By the way, if you are every in Louisville, stop at the Silo, 
a nice brewpub that I visited last month.

Subject: canning wort


There were a couple of posts in today's digest about canning wort for
use in starters so I suppose this is of general interest:


 1. "Hot water" canning should be sufficient.  I followed the directions
    Miller gives in "The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing" and it worked
    quite well.


 2. The wort did not need to be refrigerated.  I kept the jars of
    starter in the basement for up to a year and they worked fine.

From: birkelan`at`adtaz.sps.mot.com (Joel Birkeland)
Subject: Testing conventional brewing wisdom


The discussion of hop utilization that has appeared here is another
example of a subject where a little science could go a long way.  There
are numerous other examples:




        The effect of primary blowoff on flavor.


        The effect of racking beer off the hot/cold break.


        Effects of oxygenation and pitching rates on FG 
        and fermentation times


        etc...




It seems to me that well designed experiments could provide quantitative
results in the above areas that would be of use to many homebrewers.  I
appreciate that the experiments would have to take into account quite a
large number of factors, e.g. boil vigor, fermentor geometry, water
chemistry, etc....  


I suspect that existing research aimed at commercial brewing is not
applicable because of the huge scale difference and also because of
differing goals of commercial and home brewing.  What is needed is
research directed specifically towards home and other very small scale
breweries.


I know of a few brewers who have performed experiments like this, but
usually the scope of their work is too narrow, not extensive enough, not 
well controlled, or poorly documented.


It seems to me the AHA could fund work like this.  The cash outlay would
be minimal and the results could be very beneficial.  Maybe they could
take time out from printing Charlie Papazian masks and "I wish this were
my homebrew" coffee mugs.  Naah, what was I thinking?

Subject: Homebrew healthier then store bought??


I use to make my own beer years ago, and recently my interest in doing
so has been rekindled, mostly due to this mailing list.  Before I go and
spend a lot of money on equipment though, I need to find out something.


In the last few years I've been getting headaches from drinking store
bought beer (even one bottle).  I wonder if this could be because I've
become more sensitive in some way to chemicals that might be added to
the beer or an allergic reaction to the beer itself.  Do manufactured
beers have chemicals and/or perfumes added to them that could be causing
my headaches?


Are there certain kinds of hops or malts that people tend to have less
allergic reactions to?


What would be some good simple recipes to try?  (example: light on hops
and/or lighter flavors of malts).


I've recently switch from store bought wine to homemade wine because of
the sulfites always added to store bought.  This year I bought a 50 gal.
oak barrel and bought Zinfandel juice from a winery in Lodi, CA.  Made
a nice wine completely chemical free.  No more headaches from sulfite!!
Hope I can do the same with beer...




Thanks,
Mont.

Subject: Wort Gravity vs. Hop Utilization


Mark Garetz restates his position that boil gravity does not affect alpha
acid utilization.  I remain open-minded about it all, but will offer
something to think about.  Most homebrewers report that when they go to
full-volume boils, the beer became overhopped.  This was certainly true with
me, although at the time I didn't know what an IBU was.  I assumed that the
lower boil gravity (remember that the fermentation gravity didn't change) was
the reason.  As most things here in the HBD, this is not scientific data, but
anecdotal evidence.  It is also a small set of data (I know a little about
the importance of sample size).


Also, the point about the iso-alpha acids oxidizing in the head has me a
little confused.  We've been told forever that one of the affects of
fermentation is to push out the oxygen in the headspace of the fermenter.  I
wouldn't expect much oxygen to be in the headspace for this process to
happen.  Am I off?  I could see this happening more in an open fermenter,
which are still used commercially in places.  Perhaps the research was based
on this type of fermenter.
