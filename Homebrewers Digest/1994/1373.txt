Hi, fellow brewers.  While watching TV late Saturday night, I saw what I
thought was a joke, but in fact it turned out to be a real commercial.
It was for "Miller Lite Ice" Beer...I laughed so hard I almost cried!
What's next? I can see it now..."Miller Genuine Dry Ice Draft Reserve".
What do you think about a Dry Ice beer?  "Pop it open, and watch it
sublime" would be a good ad for it.  Or how 'bout "New Miller Dry Ice:
Don't put your lips on the bottle!". 
        Anyway, I thought that I would share this with you.

     As I see it, your statement means little or no change to an
all-grain brewer but significant change for an extract brewer.  If
I'm brewing an extract Pale Ale with an OG around 1.044, then the
gravity of my wort would be about 1.090.  I then double the volume
with pre-boiled/chilled tap water to lower the OG down to the
desired gravity.  My all-grain beers start at 6 to 7 gallons & boil
down to 5 gallons.  When calculating my IBU's I would add hops
based upon a gravity of 1.090 for the extract beer while the all-
grain beer would get hops based on a 1.040 OG.  The net result
being the extract beer uses more hops than the all-grain beer.  If
I understand correctly what you posted, then my extract beers are
being too heavily hopped.
     Is this correct?  Does anyone else have empirical evidence to
support or counter this?


Thanks,

Subject: Canning Wort


Recently someone asked about the need for pressure canning wort for
future yeast starters.  The question came up recently at our monthly
meeting of the St. Louis Brews.  We had the good fortune of having
the omniscient Dave Miller in attendance on that particular day!


According to Dave:


Hot water canning (no pressure) will kill all bacterial beer pathogens.
IT WILL NOT KILL WILD YEASTS!


Wild yeasts UNCOMMONLY plague the homebrewer.  For most circumstances, 
pressure canning is "overkill".


If you have a wild yeast infection, it will become apparent in your 
canning jars within a week or so by evidence of active fermentation 
in the wort.


Storage of the canned wort can take place at room temperature.  If you 
have evidence of fermentation in the jars don't use it.  Consider 
pressure canning next time.


Hope this helps.

Subject:        3 Tower all grain system


I am attempting to enter the all grain world via the three tower,
gravity fed concept. I'm currently doing partials.


What is the best way to implement a mashing vessel using a 15.5 SS
keg. The three options I am considering are:


     1) False Stainless Steel bottom
     2) A copper ring that sits in the bottom and has small slits in it.
     3) An "Easy Masher" type installation with a screen.


I will be using propane type cookers for a heat source and I am concerned
about scorching. Should I not be adding heat to maintain temp or during
mashout ? How do people do step infusion with a propane cooker ?
What is the maximum BTU rating I should look for when buying a cooker,
what is the minimum.


When using a false bottom, should you try to minimize the area under
the SS plate by using a plate that rests in the bottom curved portion
of the keg? (I have found some 10" SS dinner plates in a camping store
for $4 each)


Any information would be helpful.

A fellow homebrewer here in Rhode Island has made a maple wheat beer. He
bought a wheat beer kit (could not remember the specific kit) and only used
3 gal of maple sap. He boiled the wort with about 2 gal of tap water and
after chilling the wort added approximately 3 gal of sterilized but not
reduced maple sap (to make 5 gal). He then fermented as usual. The results
were excellent.

I think it is intuitively obvious that the higher OG of a ferment will tend to
"scrub" more hop character out of a beer.  Hop constituants also tend to 
adhere to yeast, so yeast quantity and removal (filtering) effect hop 
character.  Im still on the fence as to the actual boil gravity effects,
but I agree with Norm that the super concentrated extract brewer tends to
have more problems developing the same hop character.


As for open fermenters and oxygen, I say it doesnt matter, provided a 
adequate quantity of healthy yeast is pitched.  Now, I dont let my beer 
sit in the open fermenter long after it is done fermenting,  I rack within
a few days of the removal of the yeast head.  And I dry hop in my primary.


Best,


Jim Busch (looking forward to reading Marks book)

If this is the ring burner from the Kamp Kooker stove that they sell,
here is how mine is set up.  The Kamp Kooker has the burner in a wind
shroud about 1" below the top of the shroud, then the grid for setting
pots on which is also about 1" deep.  With my kettle sitting on top of
that, the ring on the bottom of the kettle keeps it another inch or
two further off.  So the bottom line is 3 to 4 inches from the flame
for the lowest portion of the kettle bottom.


A tip for your boiling arrangement.  I have two converted keg kettles,
one for sparge water and one for wort boiling.  Rather that sit the
first kettle on the burner and then have to move it, I made a platform
out of wood, sort of like a workbench without any top and then welded
up two kettle "holders" out of angle iron.  The holders sit on the
wood legs and hold the kettles and I added legs to the burner to make
it sit about 1/2" below the holders so that I can just move the burner
back and forth between the kettles without having to lift the kettles.


I was able to buy the Kamp Kooker stove from Cabela's Sporting
Outfitters for $49.  Thay have an 800 number, but I don't have it with
me.

I proposed that very thing about 2 years ago. It all started over a

directors. As far as I can tell, nothing ever came of the idea. With Brewing
Techniques now the mag for technical info and Zymurgy firmly settled into
its nich, I don't think you'll see anything from the AHA.


Now as for moneys to do this type of research? It is out there. You do need
to write a proposal and submit it to some of the mega breweries. They have
quite a large amount of money for basic research I'm told. Now you got the
money, so you go out and find a university with some equipment and a grad
student who likes beer. Now all you need is the time! Thats the hard part to
come by.

I brewed up my 2nd batch of beer last Sunday:  Papazian's
"Vagabond Gingered Ale".  Everything wend smoothly, and the
brew was fermenting nicely initially:


             at 5 hours:  60 bubbles/min
             at 15 hours: 90 bubbles/min


Then, everything came to a screeching halt...


             at 22 hours:  .5 bubbles/min
             at 24 hours:  .5 bubbles/min
             at 32 hours:  no bubbles seen after 5 min of watching.


I'm concerned that there may be a problem here...I expected the 
fermentation to last considerably longer.  Is there any justification
for worry here? 


I'm fermenting in a well-sealed plastic bucket, at 70 deg.  I pitched the
(dry) yeast directly onto the cooled wort.  Should I re-pitch?  Unfortunately,
I don't have a hydrometer yet so those readings are not available.

Hello New Brewers, and those considering it.


For David, who is currently enjoying the agonizing suspense of his first batch,
Relax, grab some microwave popcorn and watch Mystery Science Theatre 3000. I
doubt your fermentation is hung at 1.020. Wait a total of 2 weeks before you
bottle it so you can be sure its done fermenting. A hydrometer is not going to
help you that much when doing all extract, and opening up the fermenter to take
readings is not a good idea. Wait and see what it is when you bottle. Its your
first batch, you can do even better next time, right?


The stuff stuck on the Fermenter sides is the protein ring (and some yeast),
leave it alone, do Not stir your beer at this point. If the beer stays at 20
when you bottle, all that means is that it will be a bit sweet with less
alcohol. Not a big deal.

RE:  Hop planting ideas.  axed by Rick Dante   rdante`at`ucsd.edu


Why not try them all!  :)


I'd vote for the south side. The more sun- the better- with hops.
You really don't need some huge big heavy pole, especially  if you are
right next to something big like a house!


I simply attached fairly heavy hooks to the side of the house just
below the roof line.  There is a pretty high edge I can attach to.
The lowest part was only 15 feet, and the hops climbed much higher!
I had to attach more line higher up!  Anymore and the cascade would have
had to climb the electric wires!  (NOT recommended!!!!)


I used the rough hemp type twine. It has lots of rough edges that the
hops can cling well to. It is heavy enough to take plenty of weight.
The house is nice and white, so they get plenty of "reflected" light.
It get's quite warm, but as long as they are well watered they don't seem
to mind.  They will also serve to shade the house- and keep things cooler.


NOTE: They've only had one year so far. I plan to run more stringers this 
year.  I have sprouts poking their way up now. Anyone ever try a "wall of
water" on their hops!  The sprouts do taste good! (oops I knocked a couple
off from excessive fondling!   :(       )


A fellow brewer/grower did something like Rick described.
He put in two 12 foot posts and ran a trellis between them.
He has a small shed (8ft), and started vines up it, then ran across 
stringers to the top of the large posts. The hops will go where you 
want them.  They are very trainable. (more than my dogs!)


SOIL PREPARATION:  Something else to consider is what the condition
of the soil in the different locations is.  But regardless I would
recommend getting a bag of steer manure, and some fine bark, and peat moss.


Mix the manure in well, deep down. Mix peat moss in the upper portion,
plant rhizomes just below the peat layer, then layer bark on top. U can
use coarser bark farther out from the growing portion of the mound.
You'd have to examine the quality of your soil before deciding the best
treatment. You might even want to add some sand to aid drainage, depends
on you soil! 


The high school put up a nice 6 ft chainlink fence on the east side of
my house. Sits a foot higher than my ground level. I plan to stick some 
rhizomes in there too.  Just let them go wild on the fence. I figure the 
more mounds the better!  I doubt the high school kids would bother them,
now- if they were grapes, or hop cousins, might be a dif. story!


***
>RE:  Bottle busting from capper


*   I've had this problem -but mostly with odd shaped bottles using
an Italien wing capper.  Some bottles- like Michelob don't fit.
Fat necks.  They get in the way.


My cheap- bench capper won't bust a bottle unless it's set at the 
wrong height and REALLY forced!  The wing capper is much more likely
to find a fault in a bottle. Overall I think the bench capper is more
capable of capping dif. bottles, but the wing capper is easier/quicker to
use as long at it'll fit the bottles, no "resetting" of heights- as with
the bench capper.

Canning wort for use in starters:
 1. "Hot water" canning should be sufficient. 
 2. ...not need to be refrigerated..Kept the jars...in the basement.. a year


*   My 2c worth:  Jim, if it worked, great.  My suggestion (as a personal

then they can be stored warmer (cooler is still better!), but if they are
just "Hot water" canned you might be well advised to keep them refrigerated.


Depends on how long you plan to store them too.  If you're talking weeks;
no problem, months; eh- probably ok,  YearS...make starters more often!


As an point of reference:  Biology labs working with cell cultures generally
store media in cold rooms. Small amounts might be stored on a lab shelf
for shorter periods of time.  Solutions that are autoclaved and sealed-
are considered sterile until open.  But a visual check can tell if 
contamination has occured. Cloudiness- sediment are signs. 


Something like culture plates (petri dishes) definitely should be stored
cold. Even then, over a long time - some contamination is likely to
occur, especially with the rich kind of media our fungi like!  
Plates are much more open to potential contamination than screw cap jars,
or sealed mason jars!


Just one spuds opinion.  Take it or leave it. 
Bottom line: If it works-  do it!

Re:  Hop utilization in full gravity boils / canning 


I found my utilization increased when I went to full gravity, 6 gallon, 
boils using the Cajun Kooker, aka jet engine, from full gravity, 4 gallon, 
boils on the electric stove.  I suspect that the more vigorous boil from 
the high BTU kooker was the factor in extracting more bitterness.


RE: canning wort 


I use two pots, one with water, jars and lids the other filled with wort.
I boil the wort and the pot full of jars and lids.
After the wort has boiled for about 10 minutes I remove jars from the 
boiling water and fill them with wort and place a lid over them.
I then replace the wort filled covered jars in the boiling water and 
boil another 10 minutes.  I then tighten the lids and let the jars cool.
I store them in unrefridgerated.  By boiling the wort and then transfering
them to the sanitized jars I speed the procees up.

Subject: FAQ: Stuck fermentation...


A quick question.  I am doing a German WeiseBeer as per the recipe in 
The Complete Guide to Home Brewing.


I just took the SG of it last night and it is at 1.49 (it will have 
been two weeks on Wednesday).  Unfortunately, I spaced taking the SG 
when I first pitched, so I don't have anything to compare it to (other 
than the book's saying that it's starting SG should be between 
 .43-.50).  It isn't that it's not fermenting, as it has been bubbling 
away all through the last two weeks.


Also, I tasted the sample I withdrew, and it tasted more like Apple 
Cider than beer (very sweet).


Anyone else have a similar experience? Advice? Condolences?

Subject: Stirring and SG measurements


I thought that low OG measurements from not stirring were only a
problem with partial boils in extract brewing.  As an all-grainer, I
figured I was immune.  Well, the other night, I found out differently.


I was making an experimental Belgian Wit beer using flour instead of
raw wheat berries (pre-ground, doncha know?)  As you might expect, the
sparge was extreeeeemely slow (about 1ml/sec, or about 1 gallon/hour).


Here's the picture: I've got a plastic tube running from the spigot on
the lauter tun down into a pot on the floor that is collecting the
run-off.  At one point, I noticed that the tubing had sort of curled
up so that the outlet was right at the top of the liquid in the pot.
I tried to push it back down, but that's where it wanted to be.


Eventually the sparge finished (I did manage it to make it go a little
faster towards the end) when I had collected about 3 gallons (my
target volume for this test batch).  I took a sample by dipping the
hydrometer tube into the pot, and measured it.  1.030.  What!?  I was
aiming for 1.045!  Hmm....  Stir.... Take another sample.  1.046.
Whew!


I guess what happened was that the wort coming out late in the
sparge, near the top of the liquid in the pot, just stayed there, and
didn't mix with the heavier wort below.  I took my sample from the
top...

You made a unique beer, just like many Belgian brewers do.  Who needs

A friend recently returned from Belgium with this story:  He was
shopping for beers he couldn't get here in the US.  He picks up a
bottle of "Roman", and asks the clerk "What kind of beer is this?"
The clerk, pointing at the label, says "It's Roman."  Friend says,
"No, I mean, what style is it?"  Clerk, pointing at label, says, more

Someone mentioned a while back about leaving a starter culture open
and seeing what happened.  Well, I did just that.  A starter has been
sitting open in my kitchen for 7 days now, and not a lick of
fermentation of any kind.  I smelled the stuff.  It still smells like
wort.  I'm going to smack an airlock on tommorow and see if anything
else is happening.  Oh yeah, it tastes like wort also.  Conclusion:
Wort is not as easy to infect as you might believe.  True, stuff will
grow in it, but the infecting agents obviously arent hanging around
kitchen air just waiting to fall into wort.


To conclude my study, I'm going to bring some Nutrient Agar plates
home and leave them on the counter and see what grows.


BTW: The starters grow yeast with no trouble.

In Digest #1372 MacDonald writes about a whiff of Banana.


Typically the banana odor you describe is amyl acetate, and not often
among the alcoholic beverage/Fermentation products you find.  


Fermentation Products (common)
Acetaldehyde, methanol, propanol, acetone, methyl acetate, ethanol
isobutanol, butanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate (?), diacetal, n-propanol,
isopentanal, ethyl propionate, propyl acetate, isobutanol, acetol, butyric
acid, isobutyric acid, henanol, propionic acid, fufural, isoamyl acetate (Ah
!! thats it), Pentanol, acetic acid, 1 and 2 methylparaben, butyl acetate,
ethyl butyrate, isoamylalcohol etc. etc. etc., I am sure Jim Fix has more.


Perhaps an infected wort, but I do think I would look elsewhere, like
excessive temps, etc. first.  


For you information I had purchased a bit of the London Ale yeast and
noticed my 1 qt. starter had a similar growth on the sides and a skim on
the top of the jug.  All was super clean, and I suspect it is a contaminant
within the culture itself.  I have a sample of the contaminant but don't
have the time to do the analysis.  


Make sure you clean everything, and try a new starter.  I have had
excellent luck either begging breweries or brewpubs that have brews I
like for yeast.  Most are good guys and help out.  A few are less than
nice but there are ways to leave with what one wants anyway.  Ah! that
new clean white hankie.

Yes, but if you read the instructions on the iodophor, you will probably
notice that the iodophor solution does not need to be rinsed if the item
to be sanitized is allowed to *air dry*.  I don't think there's a fear
that you will get sick from this and since I'm not a chemist, I can't say
where the iodine would "go" as the solution dries (I don't think that
iodine is very volatile, or is it?).  If you do decide that you want to
rinse, but your water is not sanitary, you could rinse with cheap beer.

Various lactic acid-producing bacteria will sour beer, not just lactobacillus.
I don't know of any commercial source for lactobacillus at this time, but
you can buy Pediococcus from various sources -- ask your retailer to order
you some.  I made what has turned out to be a very sour beer (after a year
and a half) by using just Pedio and no Lacto.  Both pedio and lacto will
eat most of the sugars in wort -- it doesn't just have to be lactose.  It
just so happens that they will also eat lactose (whereas most yeast won't)
which is why you need to be very careful with sanitation if you add lactose
to a brew.  Some brewers have reported success with adding Lactic Acid,
but the result was reported to be rather one-dimensional until the beer
matured for a while.

99%  You probably did not mix well enough when you added the hot wort to
the cooler water and most of the gravity was at the bottom.  Don't worry,
the yeast will stir things up...

Actually, it is immaterial what temperature you set the freezer control at
as long as it is lower than your replacement thermostat setting, which, in
the case of a freezer, will be true at any setting related to fermenting/
lagering.

My experience mirrors Norm's.  I too believe that increased boil gravity
reduces utilization.  The reason I think there is no data out there from 
the brewing researchers is because the big breweries don't really care 
about this information.  They formulate recipes and adjust hop usage based
upon IBU tests on the finished product.  I know that Anheuser-Busch buys
hops in incredibly large amounts and then they store them sometimes for
two or more years before use.  I'm sure they test the hops for %AA
periodically (especially when going to a new lot), but the final adjustments
probably come from bitterness measurements in the final product.

Don't be confused Norm -- Mark was wrong in saying that oxidation of
kraeusen components makes them insoluble.  Kraeusen is indeed bitter and,
for the most part, insoluble in water, beer and alcohol, even in closed
fermenters where it does not have the opportunity to oxidize, just as you 
noted.


I too am trying to keep an open mind on the kettle utilization issue, but
my experience leads me to believe otherwise.  You can surround your
fermenter with copies of the Proceedings of the ASBC Conferences, you
can wave a copy of DeKlerck over your kettle, you can read every article
published by the MBAA and none if it will guarantee that the beer you make
is drinkable, let alone good.  Just because the literature doesn't say it
is so, doesn't mean that it can't be so.  I put a lot more weight on my
experience than I do on my reading (except the HBD -- because it is mostly
a collection of experiences) when it comes to making decisions about my
recipes and procedures.  If my gut feeling says one thing and Hough et. al.
say something else, then I go with my gut feeling and take good notes.
Brewing is both an art and a science.  Science can sometimes help explain
why the art works, but it can't replace it.  The final proof is in the
quality of the beer you make and if you are happy with it.  You can't
learn to be a great brewer from a book... you have to roll up your sleeves.

Yes, I've broken a few no-refill bottles with my double-lever capper.
It hasn't happened often since I made two improvements:


1. I keep the capper oiled.  The less force needed to work it, the less
chance of breaking a bottle.


2. I'm careful not to torque the handles.  In other words, I use a motion
like pushing something straight into the ground, instead of a motion like
breaking a stick in half.  It may be all in my head, but it seems to help.

Well this is just anecdotal evidence, but I've been brewing for several
years now, I've broken several bottles with my capper, but I've never
had a bottle bomb, even with a couple of over-carbonated batches.

This thing is called a heat-exchanger, and is basically a set of embossed
SS plates clamped together like a big accordian.  The hot wort and cold
water are channeled between alternating plates from the top, and cold
wort and hot water come out the bottom.  The whole thing comes apart for
easy cleaning of the individual plates.  The plates are hung from a pipe
across the top, like a rack of suits at the clothing store.


When I was a wee lad, my family used to run a creamery, and had one of
these gizmos.  It was huge (over 6' tall).  It would take boiling hot
pasteurized milk and make it ice cold for bottling.  When my father 
decided to get out of the business (in the late sixties), he sold it
(and several huge SS tanks, walk-in coolers, pumps, pipes, etc.) for
scrap.  What I would give to have some of that equipment now...


It would certainly be a challenge to make one of these cheaply.

Just my two cents worth on the hop utilization thing.  What some folks fail
to take into account when they use the argument, "My beers got more bitter
when I went to a full-wort boil, so the lower gravity must increase hop
utilization" is that two variables changed in the process.  Along with a
decreased gravity, the total liquid volume went up too.  Since hop acid
isomerization is an equilibrium reaction, volume (dilution) will definitely
have a positive effect on utilization, and wort gravity may therefore play
little or no part in the process.  Has anybody done two same-volume boils,
one at a low gravity and one at a high gravity, and then had the iso-alpha
acid assayed?  That would be the only way to tell.

I had been lead to believe that the changes in federal law during the Carter

tone of the article was such that one could easily infer that the ABC folks 
were not going to be busting any doors to search for carboys but htey did say 
it was illegal to brew or possess homebrew - now how is a guy supposed to 
relax?


     With any luck I will not be living here after summer 95 (and you can bet I
won't be looking to relocate into Oklahoma or Utah) but what can be done in the
interim?  How can there be homebrew stores here if the law prohibits the 
process?  I must say I am a bit paranoid  -  a feeling not enjoyedfor MANY 
years but still just as unpleasant.


     Any advise from the old hands out there?
