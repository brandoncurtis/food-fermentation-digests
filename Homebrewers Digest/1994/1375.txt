My own evidence, over about 10 years of brewing, is that you are
absolutely correct -- the concentrated wort customary in extract brewing
necessitates a much higher addition of bittering hops (but see Steve
Daniel below) -- and this is *clearly* not a product of fermentation
gravities.

I don't know how "intuitive" it is, Jim.  What is there about a
high-gravity ferment that would "scrub" hop character?  It seems to me
that if there's anything "obvious" about the question, it's the relative
sweetness of a high-gravity wort and the necessary increase in bittering
hops necessary to balance that sweetness.  Frankly, I've never seen any
significant difference in fermentation between a 1.040 and a 1.070 beer
that would account for differences in hop utilization.


((And while I'm thinking of it, would the hop formula afficionados
remind me whether or not these formulae factor in the water?))

I'm under the distinct impression (reached during a conversation with
the Blitz-Weinhard brewmaster) that most large commercial breweries
utilize high-gravity brewing -- something that would account for the
research into hop utilization during fermentation.  The brewery process
calls for watering the beer down *after* fermentation -- unlike the
homebrewer who more likely waters the wort down *before* fermentation.
As such, there isn't much difference between the wort in the kettle and
the wort in the fermenter.


I would hope that homebrewers, not just A-B, would "formulate recipes
and adjust hop usage based upon IBU tests on the finished product" -- I
know I do, although my IBU tests are all done by the in-house tongues.
So what?

It's probably not the same thing, but: I have doubled batches from 5
gallons to 10 without doing anything but doubling the bittering hops --
and dilution didn't seem to be a factor.  For many extract homebrewers,
I'd suspect the ratio isn't any higher: 3 gallons concentrated wort up
to 6 gallons or so of all-grain wort.  As I said above, my experience
has been that it's very difficult to replicate the hopping quality I get
in all-grain beers in extract beers -- a real problem in configuring
beers for my Beginning Brewing classes.


Perhaps Al Korzonas is close to the truth when he suggests that the
documentation doesn't exist because for most commercial breweries, the
problem doesn't exist: they simply don't produce 1.090-1.100 worts the
way homebrewers do and in the relative ranges they are concerned with,
hop utilization simply *isn't* significantly affected by changes in wort
gravity.


As I said, they *are* concerned with hop utilization in concentrated
fermentation because they more concentrated they can make their
ferments, the more beer they can pump out with the same volume of
equipment.

Hey homebrewers!


I am also interested in this hops utilization problem. Everywhere I look it 
seems that there are different opinions, equations, etc. on hops utilization 
and IBU's that could potentially affect the outcome of a beer to a significant 
degree. I also agree that (more) controlled research needs to be done to 
address this problem. I would like to help with this research problem. I am a 
clinical statistician at a large pharmaceutical company in the Chicago area who 
can lend a hand in the design and analysis of these experiments. I am 
unfamiliar with most of the hard scientific research that has already been done 
in the area due to lack of accessibility of the research materials. (The Siebel 
Institute here in Chicago claims they have most, if not all, materials 
published on the subject of brewing but unfortunately you must be a student or 
an alum to use it and it is not open to the public). Nevertheless, the offer 
stands so drop me an E-mail.

Subject: Treatment of Specialty Grains


Hello folks,
        in discussions of when and how to utilize specialty grains 
in all-grain brewing on r.c.b., several different opinions were expressed.
Frankly some of them confused me.  I am going to give my opinions on this
topic and the reasoning and logic behind the opinions and hopefully it will
generate some discussion.


        Assumptions:
        Specialty grains are added to beer for three primary effects:  the 
addition of color to the finished product, the addition of certain flavor 
profiles to the finished product, and the addition of body to the finished
product.  I would like to break down the flavor profiles into two groups:  
sweetness, and any other flavors.
        I have read in discussions that the primary times in the all-grain
brewing process that people add the specialty grains are 1) as a part of 
the main mash before any rests or conversion, 2) at the mashout stage, 3)
while the final runnings are heating up and then removing when they come
to a boil.  For my purposes I will treat scenario 2) and 3) as being the
same since in both instances, all enzyme activity has ceased.


        My Take on When to Add Specialty Grains:
        In almost every case, the specialty grains should be added at the 
mashout stage.  The only case specialty grains should be added to the 
primary mash and mashed is when a certain specialty grain is added only for
the color factor and the specialty grain in question has both a dextrine and 
color character associated with it.


        My Reasoning:
        Body and sweetness associated with specialty grains comes from the 
fact that a "mini-mash" has already occured within the husk of the grain
during the malting process, leaving dextrines as a large part of the malt
composition.  Dextrines add both sweetness and body to the beer as they are
unfermentable to yeast.  To add a specialty grain to the main mash for 
mashing defeats the purpose of using the grain in the first place.  The
dextrines that are freed up in the mash from the grain get converted to 
fermentables during the main mash by the enzymes that are present and you 
lose both the body and the sweetness.  On the other hand, if you add the 
specialty grain to the mash at the mashout process, the increased temperature 
will cause all enzyme activity to cease and for all practical purposes all of 
the dextrines in the grain will remain intact and manifest themselves in the 
final product.  The sparging process will ensure that an acceptable extraction 
occurs.
        If the grains used will only impart color, then adding them at the
beginning of the mash is acceptable.  If the grains used are used with the
intent to only impart color and to eliminate any dextrine quality from
the grain manifesting itself in the final product, then adding the grain
at the beginning of the mash is required.  But I think that the majority
of the time this is not the case.


This is my understanding of the issues with specialty grains.  For the 
majority of scenarios, it just doesn't make sense to add the grains at
the beginning of the mash.  If someone has any other inputs to this 
discussion, I am looking forward to reading them.

Subject: Starting a brewpub help (John Oberpriller)


There has been a lot of questions concerning starting a brewpub.  I'm not an
expert, nor do I play one on TV.  But you might be able to get some tips on
starting up for less than the 500K to 1M normally required by contacting the
following:


Sprecher Brewery, Milwaukee, WI - This is a microbrewery, not a brewpub.  It
was started with approx. $10,000 using mostly converted dairy equipment.


Lakefront Brewery, Milwaukee, WI - This is a low budget brewpub.  The owner is
trying to qualify for a BIG BUCKS loan by developing a track record first. 
( I've never been to this one. A friend told me about it.)


Cherryland Brewery, Sturgeon Bay, WI - This place is also a spartan setup.  Not
to much glitz here.  They use a UniKettle procedure, I think??  Some of they're
equipment was custom manufactured by out of work ship welders.


I hope this helps the brewpub wannabe's.  I appologize for no addresses or if
the info is a bit dated.  I don't live in Milwaukee anymore.

The village of Kulmbach, Germany near Bayreuth, *claims* to be the inventors or
discoverers of ice beer or more correctly Eisbock.  The Reichelbaeu brewery
*claims* that in 1890, they mistakenly left some barrels of bock beer out in
the winter weather.  The result, concentrated bock beer around 9%.  Apparently,
the Eisbock is still produced by Reichelbraeu and EKU.  I haven't tasted it
yet, but I'll write in if I do.


Disclaimer:
The above tid bit of history was not intended to validated the MEGA Breweries
Ice Beers, nor is it presented as fact.  In the case of the MEGA brews, they're
just removing water they shouldn't have added in the first place.  Let's face
it,  Big Bud and the Lite King are the reason most of us started brewing.

Subject: Food grade sealant




Hello all!  


A quick question, I tried to add a plastic valve to 
my primary, and although the hole I cut seemed to be 
cut cleanly, the valve leaks.  The leak is very slow, perhaps
a drop per minute, but it makes the fermenter unacceptable 
for any use other than as a bottling bucket.


Can anyone recommend a food grade sealer I could use (in
addition to the gasket that came with the valve)?


Thanks.


P.S. Oh, not to take anything for granted, the both the 
valve and the fermenter are food grade plastic.

Subject: speed growing yeast


On saturday morning I got motivated to make a batch of homebrew (a
Bass-alike from 'The Cats Meow') but I didnt start the yeast yet. It
was Wyeast London Ale, I popped it about 7:00 am and slipped it under
the waterbed sheets quietly while my wife was asleep. She is not real
happy about sleeping with yeast, but I assured her that it is 
sealed. 
By 7:00 pm it was pretty well puffed so I pitched it into a
starter (which I canned last month) in a wine bottle with a trap on
it. I kept the temperature at 85 deg with a temperature controller
and an electric heater cartridge. Basically I made a hot plate
that I sat the bottle on, and I used a thermocouple wire taped to
the bottle for the controller to read and display the temp.. Before
I went to bed ( about 16 hours after I started) it was bubbling
pretty well, but not much through the trap.


At 10:00 am on sunday I pitched the activated starter into my
Bass-alike. 


By 10:00 pm I had a steady stream of bubbles out of my blowoff
tube, and its been going full stream since, 48 hrs later


It seemed to work. Is this procedure bad in any way?


thanks for feedback

Subject: Re: Starter Culture


I regularly take a sample from my cooled wort and put it into a tall 
cylindrical container for measuring S.G.  This container has been 
cleaned and sanitized.


After a day or so, it usually has a krauesen on it and tastes fairly 
clean.  I used to joke that I made so much beer in the kitchen that ale 
yeast lived in the air.


Now, after my first contaminated beer (with wild yeast--my sweet and 
raisiny porter with lots of Special B became dry and overcarbonated), 
probably because I didn't boil my bottle caps for the first time, I 
suspect that my kitchen is more likely a haven for wild yeast.


It's actually an interesting experiment you can try several places (like
where you mash, where you boil the wort, where you crush the grains, 
where you ferment, where you cool the hot wort for pitching, where you 
bottle, etc.).  And you can try it at different times of year--the 
warmer it is and the higher the humidity, the more stuff living in the 
air.  If you always get *nothing*, you may not need to be as careful 
with sanitation as the rest of us.

One minor note for people concerned about growing hops near the house. 
As an owner of a brick home who has to fight ivy and such because it

However, never fear!  Hops won't act like ivy at all.  I now have twine 
coming down from the chimney and hops growing up the side of my 
house--they provide some attractiveness and insulation in the summer and
hops of course.

 >What is the best way to implement a mashing vessel using a 15.5 SS
 keg. The three options I am considering are:
 
      1) False Stainless Steel bottom
      2) A copper ring that sits in the bottom and has small slits in it.
      3) An "Easy Masher" type installation with a screen.
 
 >When using a false bottom, should you try to minimize the area under
 the SS plate by using a plate that rests in the bottom curved portion
 of the keg? (I have found some 10" SS dinner plates in a camping store
 for $4 each)
 
 I hate to sound pompous but, the easy masher has relegated the false bottom 
 to a location next to the dinasaurs in the museum.  I can't think of a single 
 advantage other than potentially faster lautering with a false bottom and 
 that has questionable value in homebrewing.
 
 The em is utterly simple, works like a charm and is cheap and easy to build 
 or buy.
 
 The false bottom, unless carefully made and fitted will cause no end of grief 
 with scorching and junk getting stuck in the line.  Even then, you have to 
 live with the dead space under it and recycle wort till it clears out.
 
 Actually, I do not know of any way to deal with the scorching problem with a 
 false bottom.  It almost precludes mashing in the same kettle.
 
 The copper pipe manifold is an alternative but is grossly complicated and 
 difficult to build compared to the em and I don't know of any commercially 
 available nor why one would want one.

Subject: PID Controllers


For those of you using a RIMS or other electrically-heated mash
system, from recent experience I can *strongly* recommend
scrounging around and acquiring a commercial PID (proportional
integral derivative) temperature controller.


About 2 weeks ago I happened upon two such units in a
junk bin in an electronics surplus shop, and feeling lucky, bought
them both. Tested both on my bench and they worked fine, so I
installed one on my BrewMagic RIMS system.  Brewed a pale ale
today, and all I can say is WOW. LED readout of set point and
present values, electronic calibration, autotuning of PID values,
etc., etc., etc. Bottom line -- after calibrating, just set the
desired temp and watch. Mash temp's automatically held to within
0.3F (and could be even better with an RTD rather than a
thermocouple sensor), with no overshoots. Makes step mashing
truly "push button.". 


These units are certainly not cheap if you purchase them retail
($190 and up), but they can be found in the surplus
electronic, industrial, and scientific supply channels if you're
patient and persistent. [If anyone is interested, I still have the
second unit (Fuji Electronic PYZ4 -- 1/16 DIN size) and a copy of
its users manual.]

Subject: Filtering


I was my local HB and wine making store and I saw a filter for wine
making and started wondering if I could use it for beer. It was
pancake style and took 9" flat round filters. A separate pump could
be purchased to get it thru. I think I could use CO2 instead. The
filter housing and 10 filters cost $80. 
Does anybody have any idea if this would work?

Subject: Keg carbonating and bottling


Since I wasnt impressed with my first attampts at natural
carbonation, I proceeded into kegging and artifical carbonation
early on. I just cant seem to get the ammount right(not enough). I
carbonate at 30 PSI and store tapped (for easy sampling) at 15 PSI
and 50- 55 deg. It pours well at this pressure but if I go any
higher it is real foamy. I also tried lower pressures but it seemed
that it didnt pour as well and since I wanted more carbonation It
didnt make sense to leave it low. What do others do ? Suggestions
will greatly be appreciated. 


 Since I now have 2 batches in corbouys, i figureed that I should
make some room in a keg. I had about 3/4 gal left in the keg so I
figured that I would bottle it. I sanitized and chilled the
bottles and boiled the caps. To chill the keg, (it was already at50
deg F) I put it in a 5 gal bucket with ice and rock salt. I
prepared the wash tubs for filling.
As a dispensing valve I tried to use a filling stick ( I dont know
the correct name) that came with a starter kit. This must have
been designed for gravity filling because it filled the bottles up
with foam. First I tried at 15 PSI then 10 then 5 and I gave up. I
attached the standard dispensing tap and tried just tapping into
the bottle. The problem was that the foam coming up prevented the
beer from flowing down. For this, I put a 6" piece of tubing on
the tap outlet so I could dip into the bottle and fill from the
bottom. The pressure that seemed to work the best was 10 PSI. This
worked OK but I still lost some foam down the drain. Is this usual?
Is there a better way? 


Thanks, Bill Nichols   <bnichols`at`mlab.win.net>

IBU=50 X Abs at 275 nm of an isooctane extraction of acidified beer


ASBC BU's=(96.15 X Abs at 255 nm) + 0.4 of an acid washed, diluted, slightly

I doubt that Burch knows what he is correcting for.  What he tries to provide,
and what we all need, is a utilization curve that applies to how we, as 
homebrewers, boil wort.  There have been several guesses.  Garetz' curve is
the closest to the one that I have worked out for my own system, but that
is no guarantee that it will work for yours.

I agree that this will not make a Dopplebock.  They have no roasted character.
German breweries were not allowed to use unmalted barley, under their purity
law, but they do have "chit malt" which is basically barley that has just
barely been malted.  This gives them the characteristics of unmalted barley
but lets them get around the law.

Subject: Party Kegs are for me...


 I too have to agree with "rprice" who loves the party keg system. After having 
accumulated mucho bottles I have found a much easier and quicker way to store 
my home brew. I enjoy using these party kegs so much that I bought two sets of 
4 containers each including the taps and CO2 cartridges. The 4 containers 
which will hold a 5-gallon batch, the tap, and two boxes of CO2 cartridges 
cost me $49.95. I can't explain to you how much easier this has made my life 
as far as home-brewing is concerned. The big "PAIN" for me was cleaning and 
capping my bottles. The process of bottling took me at least 2 hours which 
includes cleaning and disinfecting. Now it runs me an hour tops when using the 
minikegs. 
 The reason I bought 2 sets was so I could have to different brews on tap at 
the same time. Right now in my frig I have a pale ale and an English ale at my 
disposal. I have a separate frig in my basement that I keep these in but you 
could easily fit a keg in with your foodstuffs in your kitchen frig. I also 
think that the brew tastes better out of the kegs in comparison to the 
bottles. Another major advantage is that after the first 2 glasses you have no 
yeast sediment in your beer. With the bottles you have to at least be aware of 
the yeast at the bottom of the bottle (although it never bothered me). As you 
can imagine these "party kegs" have made my brewing life a whole lot easier and 
I certainly think the expense is worth it. I bought my keg system at the Brew 
Ha Ha in Pottstown, PA (the usual disclaimer). Their 800 number is 800 243 
2620 or their local number is (215) 326-2620. This system was $39.95 not too 
long ago so it looks like they are becoming more popular...

Hello brewers!
  I am a novice... Last week a friend and I cooked up our first batches of beer
(from kits), an IPA and a Porter.  We are presently having a debate about a
point which I think someone might be able to help me with.  My brewmate is crazy
over the damn hydrometer readings and is taking them everyday;  he is opening
the carbouy every day to take them.  I think that fermentation is (supposed to
be) anaerobic and that this may well have messed us up...  What are the
thoughts of you all wizened brewmeisters?  Is our first brew doomed?  If the
fermentation, which was very active (roiling) on the second day, has been
interrupted by opening the carbouys, is there something we can do at this point
to save these batches?  I look forward to a response at:
[Nelsonto`at`student.msu.edu].
Thank you!

Wanting to make yeast starters per the HBD stove-top method (JS-method?),

neither Beer Makers ("Finally sold the last one.  Didn't fit the drilled

Please let me know who carries them (No. Cal. or mail order).  By the way,
the hole in the black lab-type stopper is much narrower than brew store

Subject: Priming with dried malt extract


Peter Williams asked about using dried malt extract for priming ...


Peter, I too have had disappointing carbonation using dried malt extract, so
I'm glad to hear it's not just me! My guess (and it's only a guess) is that
the sugars in malt extract aren't as readily usable by the yeast as the
nearly pure glucose in corn sugar is, especially under the relatively adverse
conditions in the bottle (high alcohol content, ever-increasing pressure,
etc.). I have found that letting the malt-primed brews condition a little
longer (6 weeks to 2 months; a lot longer, actually) helps a bit.


I don't think that the small amount of corn sugar added at priming adversely
affects the taste of the beer, so I've pretty much switched to using that
(or sometimes honey, which also works well) on a permanent basis.


Anybody else have a more learned opinion to offer? I'm curious to know how
wild my guesses are ...

This may be well and good (I'm discussing this further with Andy offline),
but I would like to warn against "leaving the stuff sit for a while
before turning on the wort chiller."  Doing this will increase the
production of Dimethyl Sulfide in the wort which, in the case of lagers,
could be significant (Woodstock Lager, contract brewed by Point Brewery,
is a recent example I've tasted with too much DMS -- Old Style, by Heilemann,
is a perennial favorite example).

Well, despite the fact that I still don't consider Mark Garetz
an expert, I must admit that the correlation between hop utilization
and isoalpha acid concentrations *could* explain the fact that,
in my experience, Rager's formulas have worked.  I still feel that
not enough research has been done in this area yet to discount
any other factors, *including* boil gravity.  Mark has reported
that he has found no record of research in this factor, so why
are we so quick to discount it?  There are a great many factors
that must be considered and should be investigated before we
finalize the formula that contains the factors that make a
significant difference and excludes the factors that don't.


BTW, I appreciate your posting of your references Mark... Thanks!

Subject: Wort Gravity and Utilization of Alpha Acids: Data!!




Lots of opinions on this subject recently. I love to pick
up the digest and see "hoppy" subject lines!


I did a little experiment a week ago and ran the samples
yesterday in Gail Nickerson's lab at OSU. For those of you 
who don't want the details here is the jist. Two worts, 1.086
and 1.043 (all grain) each boiled with the same amount of hops,
in the same size pot over the same burner. The initial volumes
were identical. 


The HPLC showed that the utilization in the kettle for the high 
gravity wort was 20%, for the low gravity wort it was 42%. This 
method is specific to iso-alpha acids and was done by a pro (Gail).
I won't make any sweeping generalizations based on this, admittedly,
tiny sample. More to come. 


Something to chew on...

Subject: Rinsing sanitizers




I have seen numerous posts questioning the need to rinse various 
sanitizing agents from fermenters, kegs, etc. prior to contact with 
beer.  If the instructions indicate that the agent does not need 
rinsing, as with iodophore, it should be allowed to air dry.  It seems 
that during this air-drying stage, other nasties could come in contact 
with the recently sanitized surface.  In reality, the biggest problem 
with air-drying is the time and advanced planning required to do so.


My solution to this problem is to pressure can or autoclave several 500ml 
bottles of water at the time I make starter solutions.  This way, I have 
plenty of sterile rinse water and I don't have to buy cheap beer for the 
purpose.  Purchasing their wimpy products only encourages them to brew 
more.  This sterile water also comes in very handy when I want to 
de-brew a beer a small amount.  I have even used it to sparge the hops 
in my hopback.

Darren Aaberge, in HBD 1374, writes about bittering units and the
confusion surrounding them. Here's what I know about the situation.


BUs (Bittering Units) and IBUs (International Bittering Units) are
one and the same - an internationally agreed upon unit for 
describing the bitterness of wort and beer. The method uses an 
isooctane extract of the sample, which is run on a UV spectrophotometer. 
The absorbance data is run through an equation, and voila, you have IBUs 
(or BUs). 


This method is *not* specific to iso-alpha acids, anything that absorbs at 
the wavelengths in question contributes to BUs. Even unhopped beer has 
3-4 BUs. The number of BUs is therefore slightly higher then the mg/L of 
iso-alpha acids. 


Hope this helps,
