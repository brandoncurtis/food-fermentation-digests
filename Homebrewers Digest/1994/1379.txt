>
I can share with you a few reasons why I use two-stage fermentation:


1) Secondary fermentation provides additional time for the beer
to clear - results in less sediment in the bottle
2) Secondary fermentation done properly allows the fermentation to
go to completion - thus improving uniformity in carbonation - depending
on the yeast used, and the carbohydrate makeup of the wort, there can be
a fairly large range of fermentation times required to 'ferment out'.
3) Secondary fermentation is somewhat of a convienance factor: I have
anywhere from two to five fermentors running all the time.  The two-stage
process allows me to package the finished beers at my leisure without
concerns of autolysis (can occur is beer is left on a large yeast mass
for too long)
4) Many big beers and all meads requi

Not in my experience.  I know of no homebrewer who is watering down the
wort *after* fermentation on a regular basis (some have done a few
experimental batches), but most of the extract brewers I know are watering
down the wort *before* fermentation.  There are a number of homebrewers
I know (myself included, when I do extract batches) that do full-boil
extract batches, so please don't assume that *all* extract brewers are doing
partial boils.

This is not necessarily true if you have the proper back pressure from your
serving line.  See Dave Miller's article in the 1992 AHA National Conference
Proceedings, "Just Brew It."  I did my math, adjusted my hose lengths and
can serve and store at the same pressure without problems, one pint a week
if I wish.

Blackberries and raspberries have quite a bit of acidity in them.  They
don't seem that sour because they are so sweet.  Once all that sweetness
ferments away, the sourness really comes through.  I'm even thinking about
adding Calcium Carbonate to my raspberry beers to counter some of that
sourness.  Note that the larger a sugar molecule gets, the less sweet
it tastes to us.  Glucose is sweeter than sucrose which is sweeter than
lactose.  Malto-dextrin will add a lot of body and FG, but will not really
add much sweetness at all.  If you want it to be sweeter, you might try
adding lactose at bottling time.  Note that lactobacillus WILL ferment
lactose, so you better be sure that there's no lactobacillus in there
before you add the lactose, or you might get glass grenades.

Jack has pointed out the ease with which heat can be added to the
mash using his system. As a subscriber to the protein rest system
I find it necessary to add bunches of calories to the mash and I
have only been able to do this with a lot of stirring to prevent
hot spots and scorching.  I am puzzled at how this can be done without
damage to the screen tube which I visualize projecting across the
bottom of the mash tun...what's wrong with this picture?

Subject: icebeer/o2 permeability of polyproplene


Popular Science has a short blurb this month on a `filterless water
purification system' which got me thinking about this megabrewery icebeer 
nonsense.  A volume of non-pure water is drawn into a chamber.  A cold
source cools the water from the top until approximately 10% of the water is 
frozen.  A drain in the bottom lets out all the remaining water, leaving
the ice.  Since the impurities are more soluable in a liquid than a
solid, the remaining ice is 90% to 95% pure of particulates, ions and
even bacteria.  A heat source then melts the nearly-pure ice for
drinking water, etc.


So if its true that freezing a portion water gives you nearly pure
ice, with nearly everything else remaing in the liquid, what is the point 
of icebeer?  They freeze and extract some of the water - which I suspect
is H2O and only H2O.  Then they add back `pure' water to make up the
volume loss.  Did I miss something?


***


A week or so ago Al gave a great post about the nature of gasses and O2
permeability of HDPE.  What about polyprplene?


I bought two 2 gallon polyproplene bottles from American Science and
Surplus, maninly for preparation and short-term storage of sanitizing
solution.  I'm trying to become more consistent batch-to batch, and I should 
be able to measure out an appropriate ppm bleach solution with the graduated
bottles.  


However, I occasionally need a 2 gallon secondary fermenter, and it
would be nice to know if polyproplene is appropriate.  Note that it may
be better to temporarially secondary ferment small volumes in plastic,
than in a 5 gallon glass carboy, because the unpurged headspace (in this
case 3 gallons) contains a lot more O2 than could permeate through the
polyproplene.

     Yes. It is illegal to brew beer in Alabama.  You can fermint 5 gal. of 
     wine per year if you grow the fuit.  I would not worry to much about 
     brewing being illegal, just don't sell the stuff.  I know many people 
     who have been brewing for years without a problem.  I don't know what 
     kind of penalties are involved if you get caught, though.  Just don't 
     advertise your homebrew and you should be okay 8-).  (In fact, there 
     is a store here in Huntsville which sells homebrewing/wine making 
     supplies.)

     Well, _EVERY_ bottle had label "stuff" stuck to the bottom.  Morel:

Subject: Cannabis instead of Hops - M. Jackson Comments


I was lucky enough to spend the weekend in Philadelphia, at the University of
Pennsylvania's "Book and the Cook" event.  Michael Jackson hosted two events,
the first being a dinner featuring the Beers of Belgium which was similar to
the event that was in the Beer Hunter videos and the second being a tutored
tasting of 13 American microbrews.  


I had been waiting for the opportunity to bring up the idea of cannibis 
instead of hops with Mr. Jackson, but would you believe he beat me to the
punch?  He was discussing the fact that drying hops smells like the 1960s
because of hops relationship to cannabis.  He then went on to mention a
homebrew that he had tried at a competition sometime back which he noted was
somewhat "special." It turns out the beer was made with pot. Apparently, it
was also pretty good.


I mentioned to him the little "discussion" that had been going on in HBD and
he chuckled...then signed my Beer Companion book "Watch out for those
cannabis beers!"  


I guess catnip beer would be completely out of the question!


The Book and the Cook events occur every year so look for it around this
time next year.  Next year's event will feature Eastern vs. Western US beers.

The Chicago regional 1st round judging for the AHA National Homebrew
Competition is scheduled Friday and Saturday, May 6-7.  Midwest judges
should note that this is the weekend after 1st round judging in Cincin-
nati.


Judging will take place at Cavanaugh's Restaurant, in the landmark
Monadnock Building in Chicago's Loop.  Competition entries should still
be delivered to Goose Island Brewing, however.  Due to space conflicts
at the Goose (the famed Goose Wing will be no more due to the major
demolition/reconstruction at 1800 N Clybourn), we will not be able to
judge there.  But in spite of the site change, we'll still hold the 2nd
Annual Midwest Invitational Brewoff and Dinner on Saturday night, May 7.
This definitely means that we'll have a tremendous stock of superior
homebrew to quaff after judging has been completed.


A mailing to all regional judges will go out by the end of this week.  If
you're itching to get involved though, you don't have to wait until you
get it.  You can reply to either of the three site directors listed
below:

Subject: anaerobic kegging


Ben Woodliff suggests purging your c-keg before filling to prevent
O2 contamination. I agree and take it 1 step further.


 - With both locks on and the bung open, fill the keg with CO2 from
the bottom. Use the 'out' lock with the dip tube connected to the
CO2. 


 -Close the bung and bleed the CO2 from the 'in', again from the
bottom to the top. The keg is now completly purged.


 - Connect the siphon hose to the 'out' lock (the dip tube) and
siphon the beer, filling the keg again from the bottom to the top.
The CO2 displaced by the beer will vent from the 'in' lock, it
must be on or the siphon won't work. Keep an eye on the siphon
hose, if you start to suck some muck, you can probably pull the
lock off before it gets into the keg. The lock will neatly seal
right away.

No, they water down after the boil, but before the fermentation. If
you top up the secondary, there's a small amount of watering down,
but I doubt that's significant to this discussion.

As to his less-than-subtle swipe as RIMS units, I disagree.


As Jack is fond of relying on Dr. Fix's expert opinions
when they favor *his* products, perhaps he should consider
Dr. Fix's rave review of the BrewMagic RIMS.  This unit offers
substantial advantages over conventional methods, including
pinpoint temperature control, increased extract yield, and
less labor.  


While the BrewMagic unit is, admittedly, a pricey item, the
fact remains that RIMS units can and do work.

in HBD1378 Todd Carlson asks for a list with mashing
instructions.


This is a rule of thumb for anyone in doubt:
Cut a grain in half and inspect the interior,
If it is very dark brown to black       - doesn't matter.
If it is glassy/caramelly, any colour   - shouldn't mash *).
If it is starchy/floury and beige-brown - should mash, has no enzymes **).
If it is starchy/floury and white       - should mash, has enzymes.


*)  Note that some types of malts (special B for example) are a mix of
    different types of grains.


**) Turn-over point for the colour is slightly darker than munich malt, 
    which will just about convert itself but no additional adjuncts.

 I also disagree that you "get what you pay for". Shop around. As
someone once put it "Retail is for suckers".


 I got my keg setup from the local resturant supply/surplus place. I
got the 5 gal cornelius SS kegs for $5-10 each, cornelius regulator
for $15-20, CO2 cylinder (SCUBA tank size, not the wimpy one) for $20
[it cost $28 for the local welding gas supply shop to inspect and fill
it - been using it "regularly" :-) since last July - almost time to
refill]. They threw in the hoses and fittings for free.


 I explained that I was making *beer* to put in all those kegs I was
buying (have about 6 now), and the owner got _real_ interested. I took
him a six-pack of some ~light beer and a 1/2 keg of Nut Brown Ale. He
tried and and decided "this guy makes the best beer I ever had!".
We're good buddies now. He _gave_ me a 15 gal SS Sankay keg the other
day - "try this and see if these work for you".....

        I had a similar experience with sourness in a blueberry beer

and I actually gave up on it - swearing to learn to make sweat mead
to mix with it before serving.  BUT you should taste it now: mellow,
wonderful color, clean taste - almost sweet.
        Anyway, don't give up on your blackberry batch.  Just let it
sit a while for the differnet tastes to 'marry' (as they say in wine
blending).  It's a real education to taste one about every two weeks
and check out the transformation already underweigh.

Subject:  iso amyl acetate


In reply to Jeff Benjamin re: amyl acetate,  the presence of amyl acetate
isn't somthing we all expect in the profile of a home brew beer at a
detectable level.  The laundry list is from an HPLC standard profile that is
commonly used for brewing/fermenting.
The presence of the amyl acetate at this level is not a common profile
that one would expect.  Getting "hit in the nose by bananas" isn't
somthing that I would expect when opening a fermenter.  
The biochemical soup left after a natural fermentation isn't fixed in stone,
and an off batch isn't uncommon. The easiest way to handle the problem
is to change yeast,  review the logbook and figure out what changed,
clean up, and try again.
In the past microscopists used amyl acetate as a final solvent prior to
critical point drying for SEM preperation.  That use has been reduced as
younger scientists felt that the amyl acetate would pose health risks. 
The reason it was used; however, was the fact that the amyl acetate
was freely miscible with CO\2, so it is likely that the odor might have
been more easily noticed because it had partitioned into the CO2 and
was being stripped from the been in amounts sufficient to detect while
not being an overpowering force in the brew ??


Anyone have more thoughts on the amyl acetate ??  


If I get a chance when it warms up I will do a high temp ale brew and do
a HPLC profile, it would be interesting to see if the Wyeast sample puts
out significant amyl acetate in the profile.


Cheers !

Fellow Homebrewers:


I've been reading the Digest for several months now, and have found it to be 
most helpful.  I'm hoping some of you might help me with a growing concern I 
have.  How do you keep your racking tubes clean?  I have always soaked them in 
a bleach solution in a 5 gallon bucket for 30 minutes or so.  No problem with 
the hose, as it can be coiled in the bucket.  However, the straight tube and 
racking cane are never more than half submerged in the solution.  Over time, 
these tubes get a hazy, scratched appearance and I am concerned they are 
harboring little beasties I don't want in my brew.  Any ideas?


Secondly, and I hope not related to the first question, I just finished a 
steam beer that tastes like Grandpa beer (I call it Grandpa beer because it 
tastes like the beer my father-in-law used to make).  Has a sour/yeasty smell 
and a cloudy appearance.  I've made this all grain recipe before and it came 
out clear with a clean hoppy nose.  Obvoiusly some kind of infection and 
that's never happened to me before.  I'm starting to panic.  What if all my 
equipment is infected?  I always attributed Grandpa's bad beer to his high 
fermentation temperatures but this beer was fermented at 61F using Wyeast 
California Lager #2112.  Any ideas on this one?

Subject: Tales of a First All-Grainer


     A few weeks ago I decided to start doing all-grain brewing (there was 
     a parallel brew on compu$erve I wanted to compete in).  I open TNCGTHB 
     to the "Advanced" section to find out what equipment I needed.  Since 
     I have been extract brewing for a couple of years I was sure I have 
     everything.  All I needed was a large kettle, a mush tun, a 
     lauter/sparging system, and a wort chiller.  So I orderd a Vallrath 38 
     quart pot from Williams Brewing, and a lautering/sparging system from 
     Brewers Resource.  (Yes, I know there are other ways, but they were 
     belated x-mas gifts.)  Bought 60 feet of copper to make the wort 
     chiller (hey, I've got to _something_).  I already had a large cooler 
     to mash in.  So, having the equipment, I downloaded several files for 
     compu$erve (at the time I didn't have access the I-net) about 
     all-grain brewing.  Reread TNCGTHB several more time.  Finally bought 
     the grain.
     
     Since I was using wheat in my pale ale, I decided to step the mash per 
     TNCGTHB.  So, into the cooler go the grains.  Heat up the water then 
     dump into the cooler.  Stir.  Stir.  Stir.  Heat up more water the 
     dump into the cooler (all per TNCGTHB page 300 I think).  In to the 
     sparging vessle.  Sparge.  Sparge.  Sparge.  The wort smells just like 
     extract so I took this as a good sign.  Boil wort.  Chilled the wort.
     (Whole time from clean kitched to clean kitchen was 6.5 hours).
     Pitched yeast.  Waited.  Waited.  Bottled.  Waited.  Waited.
     
     Results:  After a week in the primary (dry hopping), a week in the 
     secondary, and a week in the bottle, the beer tasted, well, _GREAT_.  
     The beer is a little cloudy but that was due to inpatient sparging 
     (always a next time).  I'm sure the beer will only inprove with some 
     time.
     
     Bottom line:  There is nothing to doing all-grain.  Just a little more 
     equipment, a little more time, and a little more patients.

Subject: The greatgrind prophet spake verily!


A great pronouncement last week on HBD revealed that the false bottom
is now a museum piece.  This pronouncement was made by the grind prophet
and had to be considered.  So to test the prophesy it was decided to test
the great EM device - for a Weizen.  Due to a shortage of malted wheat
the bill was only 5/9 wheat malt, but nevertheless a possible sticky mess
maker.  The batch was brewed according to the book written by the great
weizen prophet.  The test was performed in gott cooler, and the runoff
cleared quickly and flowed without problem, having to be restrained to limit
the rate.


Additional commentary.  When I purchased the grinder the EM was included
as part of a deal and had remained idle for months after failing miserably as 
a hop filter.  I have a seperate lauter tun and to use the same pot for 
mashing, lautering and boiling would add hours and trouble even if it were
possible - I need the pot for heating sparge water.  However I did replace the 
copper manifold with the mesh for this batch.  Extract may have been
down marginally, but this may have ben due to the fast runoff instead of the
dead zones areound the bottom.  It should be noted that I have never had a 
problem sparging a weizen since I started decocting them, and the next EM test 
will be a stout with 25% unmalted barley infusion mashed.

Subject: Re: Chiller Theory


Let me preface my response by saying that this should not be interpreted as
Charlie Bashing; trying to have a meaningful discussion on the differences
between Papazian and Miller is probably how the whole IRA political mess got
started.


What Ron Dwelle's question points out though, is that Charlie left out certain
key bits of information apparently. One big reason that we chill and attempt to
chill quickly is that a large temperature gradient causes the permanent
coagulation of proteins that then settle out. These proteins are known as the
Cold Break. It is these proteins that are responsible for a majority of Chill
Haze in the finished beer. Only the large temperature difference between
boiling and chilling temp provides the change in entropy necessary for the
coagulation. Otherwise, when you chill the beer in the fridge prior to
consumption, the proteins just coagulate enough to produce haze and are able to
go back into solution on warming.


Now, one reason Charlie may have left this out, Is that this does not impact
the flavor of the beer significantly. Its an appearence thing. Miller mentions
it because his favorite beer style are clear Pilsener type lagers. Charlie's
aim with his book, as I understand it, was to get people past some otherwise
potentially daunting technical details and onto actually brewing a beer. I like
knowing and understanding every part of a process, so I myself, can make the
decision on where to cut corners.


Other reasons to chill quickly, ie. with a copper wort chiller, is to reduce
the time available for infection and reduce the time spent brewing. Living in
southern California, where its always warm, and air quality is doubtful, there
are always airborne nasties to watch out for. 


One alternative chilling method that may have a large potential are my wife's
feet. Past experience in other situations has shown that they have a
considerable heat sink capacity. I think just putting them against the sides of
the pot will probably do it.   :-)

Pike Place Pale Ale is from the Pike Place brewery at the Pike Place

Vermont. (Well maybe not too supprised, but I would be dissapointed) It

I also use 1/2 BBl sankeys.  I agree that the backflow valve needs to be
removed, but I still could never fill the damn keg.  It would fill up some
but maybe 20% of the keg was never getting filled.  Maybe it was the 
height on my siphon hose, that I needed more "head" on the siphon
to fill it, but in my system I could not adjust this.  My solution has
been to fill 3 corny kegs and push each one into the sankey under CO2
pressure.  This has worked well.  Add the priming solution to the first
corny keg, siphon beer into this, then push it into the sankey.

Sure, but there is an enormous difference between what homebrewers can do
and what makes a long term successful operation.  I actually like fresh 
Sprecher beer (or I used to, its been awhile since Ive been to Milwaukee).
When you actually sit down and price out the difference between a new or
used *brewing* tank vs the costs of modifining something that was never 
intended for brewing, the savings are questionable.  In the last issue of
"The New Brewer", a big deal was made about how a California brewer increased
capacity by welding extensions onto his grundy tanks.  I believe the result
was a 10 BBl tank.  In the classifieds in the same issue was an ad for a
15 BBl used unitank for $5,500.  I bet the mods alone cost the guy close
to a grand.  At 10 kegs extra per week, the tank pays for itself in about
10 weeks.

 Don't get me wrong, you need good equipment.  But it's possible with a little

Sure, all the money in the world doesnt make a bad brewer good.  All too 
often, operations are centered around homebrewers who will kill to be
the "brewer".  Usually these guys are paid substenance wages.  One of
problems in the industry is that experienced brewers are passed by in 
favor of inexperienced ones.  Penny wise and pound foolish.

This is true only if the solution is at the saturation point of the 
solute.  Using your analogy, a teaspoon of sugar will dissolve equally 
well in both volumes.  A pound of sugar would not.


Please correct me if I am wrong, but under normal hopping regimens, iso-
alpha acids are nowhere near saturation concentration.  It seems realistic
to expect as much iso-aa to go into solution in 2-3 gallons as in 5-50 
gallons given the same amount of hops and the same gravity. 


This is where I have been having problems with Mark Garetz's comments 
from 15 March where he states that increasing the hopping rate reduces 
utilization in the boil.   


Please help me understand this.  Where does my logic fail?  Just out of 
curiosity, what is saturation for iso-aa in beer wort?

In the last several digests I have followed the thread on Specialty Malt
additions at mashout with interest.  It seems to me that if these grains
are added at mashout they will be under-utilized.  Even though the crystal
malts and dextrine malts are basically pre-mashed it doesn't seems that
they will have enough time to disolve their sugars.  Maybe adding them
during the last 15 minutes of the mash would allow for more solubilty.


On another tact: Since we know that higher mash temperature,
ones that favors alpha amylase, give us a sweeter less fermentable
wort and lower temps give us a drier more fermentable wort; I am interested
in how mash stiffness effects fermentabilty (if at all).  What are some
other factors that we can use to control the fermentabilty of the wort?
