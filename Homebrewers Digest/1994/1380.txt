Try a used one at a restaurant supply store.  In every major town there's
a restaurant going out of business every week -- much of their equipment
goes to these reselling places.

I'm afraid you're off by one Oxygen.  The active ingredient in B-Brite and
One Step is Sodium Percarbonate.  When mixed with water, it makes something
similar to a mix of Washing Soda and Hydrogen Peroxide.  Sodium Carbonate
(Washing Soda) is good for cleaning, but does nil for sanitizing it's the
H202 that does the sanitation.

It is not recommended to rehydrate yeast in wort.  The hydrostatic pressure
is higher and thus 90-110F sanitary water is best for rehydration.

It may or may not be related to the rehydration, but could just be the yeast
strain.  Some produce a lot of sulfury aromas, which later dissipate.

The acidity of wort will not keep neither cultured or wild yeast
at bay, nor will it kill many of the wort-spoiling bacteria like
Pediococcus and Lactobacillus.  It will kill some bacteria and
the acidity, combined with the alcohol of the *finished* beer
and the lack of oxygen after the yeast has begun fermentation are
enough to kill all known *pathogens*.  I don't know about botulism.

I don't agree with any of the above except the part about "all malt."
The small amounts of priming sugar are not going to lend any flavor
to your beer -- there's just not enough there to make a difference.
Also, the small amount of DME that you would use shouldn't make an
appreciable difference in the head retention.  See my Technical
Communication in the latest issue of Brewing Techniques for more on
this subject.

Speeding up cooling is the most important part -- speedy cooling:


        1. reduces the risk of infections taking hold
        2. reduces DMS production (cooked corn aroma)
        3. increases cold break formation

"Why" is because the larger mass of a full boil takes a long time to cool
with the "kettle in the sink full of ice" method of cooling.   Don't forget
to account for the cost of the ice.

Subject: Harvested yeast


John Pavao mentioned harvesting yeast slurry from his fermenters and storing it
in capped beer bottles.  I used to do this, and now I don't.  I advise others
not to do it, too.  Store the slurry in a flask or a bottle or something with
an airlock.  If you harvest a little early, you can get tremendous pressure in
a sealed bottle.  I know.  I'm still here to talk about it, but one day last
week I spent several seconds trying to figure out why I couldn't see, and was
that blood dripping off my face.  It wasn't; it was the thick yeast slurry
which left the bottle and headed for the moon and was stopped by my face and
the ceiling.  All I lost was one contact lens.  It was pretty upsetting.

Subject:  5 Liter Mini-Kegs


The 5 Liter mini-kegs seemed to receive a lot of praise from people
over the last couple of HBDs.  Well, I went looking for them.  The
thought of being able to keg five gallons for around $50-60 was
definitely intriguing.  Well, I can't find them anywhere.  I can get
Party Pigs no problem, but the Mini keg seems to be cheaper both in
terms of initial cost and upkeep.


Couple of questions:


1- Do these babies work like the cornelius type, meaning yeast in the
   first glass and clear beer the rest of the way?
2- Where do I buy these things???  I can't find any homebrew shop that
   has any!
3- Please tell me I don't need a CO2 tank and regulator!


Speaking of regulator.... is there a specific type that CO2 needs?

Aromatic is a wet-kilned amber malt, similar to munich but darker.  Biscuit
is a dry-kilned amber malt which does not have enzymes.  Victory is a toasted
malt which does not have enzymes.  Caramel, dextrine, carapils, carastan,
caravienne, caramunich, special B -- all of these are crystal malts.


Bottom line: if it's crystal malt, it does not need to be mashed; if it is
not, then it should.  Caveat: with dark roasted grains like chocolate,
black (roasted) malt and roasted barley, you can get away with not mashing
because the small amount of haze produced will be concealed by the resulting
dark beer.


>but what is RIMS?


Recirculating Infusion Mash System -- basically, it is
a mash tun with a pump that draws out the runoff, sends it to a heater
(an immersion heater in a pipe usually) and then returns it to the mash tun.
Originally devised by Rodney Morris and described in the Gadgets Special
Issue of Zymurgy (I believe).  Actually, "Infusion" is a misnomer because
an infusion mash is one where hot water additions are used to raise the
temperature of the wort.  Still, a pretty cool idea.  It has apparently
been improved upon.  There was a review by George Fix of the new system
in a recent issue of Zymurgy -- near the back.
 
>What's an easymasher (TM)?
An easymasher is the kind you make at home.  An EasyMasher(tm) is one
that is made by the HBD's own Jack Schmidling.  Simply put, it is a
copper tube mounted in a pot, via a spigot, encircled by a cylinder of
stainless steel mesh.  I have been one of its most fervent critics in
the past.  Recently, I've done a small test of it.  All this test
really concluded for me was that indeed it is "easy" and that its
extraction was "acceptable."  I'm planning to do a full batch test of
it soon (a much fairer test than the meager 4# I did earlier) and will
report my findings here first.

Has anyone had experience with Wyeast 1056,

last several batches, and have been
disappointed with bottle carbonation.


I have had good vigorous fermentations down to 
1.010 - 1.015, over 3 - 4 days, but have left the beer
in the carboy for 5 - 10 days after fermentation has
slowed to a crawl.


I have primed with 3/4 to 1 cup sugar, but even 2 months later,
carbonation, though present, has been minimal.


Is this yeast known to be difficult to start up
again??

Howdy,


I have a friend that brewed a stout that came out with a hard to describe
off flavor.  When I was grilling him on what happened, I discovered that he
had accidently pitched two kinds of yeasts;  Yeast Lab Irish Ale with either
WYeast American or British Ale.  Not going into the details of why he did it,
but the WYeast was ready to pitch in a starter, & the Irish Ale yeast was
pitched straight out of the container.  Do any of you yeast masters have any
thoughts on this?  Could it cause a stout to develop any off flavors?  Will
these yeasts "mate" together, creating a new "breed"?  Anybody want some
mutt yeast?

Steve, I think that economics play a much larger role.


Your average 50-gal wine barrel holds about 200 retail bottles of wine. 
Let's just say that the wine retails for $10 a bottle -- $2000 of retail
product per barrel.  the equivalent amount of beer, a little over three
kegs, retails for what,...about $150 max?  Let's say $200.  So we have a
10-to-1 price ratio for the product, allowing us to use expensive fining
ingredients.


Next, let's consider that the vast majority of wine is not fined using egg
whites or any other additive, they are racked (often as much as 5 times),
filtered, and centrifuged.  All of these processes are faster and less
messy, as well as cheaper.  That is why they are used for beer as well.


Even if you buy pre-separated egg-whites, the frothing and adding process is
very time consuming relative to your margin on the product.  


As a final note, the reason that wine makers use egg whites for fining is
partly historical -- micron-type filters didn't exist two-hundred years ago.
What egg-fining is done is done because of concerns about maintaining
quality while achieving clarification: filtration and the like remove
quality and body characteristics also.  Today, the only wines that are
egg-fined are the 2% of the wines that are in the super-premium category,
usually retailing for any where from $25 (domestic) to $500 (Bordeaux and
Burgundy) PER BOTTLE.  


It should suffice to say that I don't think that Baron Rothschild of Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild was really bothered by the cost of a couple dozen eggs
when making his $16,000 barrels of wine taste and look great.

In addition to being brewed at the Pike Place brewery in Seattle, this
ale is also brewed under contract (for east coast distribution) at the
Catamount Brewery in White River Junction, VT.  (Catamount is an
excellent brewery, and in addition to their own beers, makes a fair
number of contract brews.)  I don't know if there are any substantial
differences between the stuff brewed in Seattle and the version brewed
in Vermont, but I assume they use the same recipe.  


In any case, this is probably the maltiest pale ale I've ever tasted,
though I'm not sure I would describe the flavor as chocolately.  I
assume the maltiness is due to the use of Maris Otter malt, which
probably also accounts for the high price ($10 a six-pack).  It's worth
the price, though, and I'm glad we east coasters can get the stuff, even
if it's contract brewed.  Unfortunately, it's the only Pike Place beer
we can get here.  I've heard some of their other beers are great as well.

the adjuncts as well. Flaked barley, corn, oats, and unmalted wheat (read as
flour if you want) I've been adding to the mash. I don't think anyone would
care to add flour to the boil unless they want barley gravy. Does any of the
above sound shaky?


Also, regarding dextrins, since they are sugars, not starches, they should
survive a mash intact, Shouldn't they?


Dark grains I've been steeping like tea in tepid, not boiling water. I'm not
sure I get the most efficient flavor extraction (I'm not expecting ferment-
ables here), but emprically, it works.

Subject: CO2 Generation


I was wondering...alot of brewing processes can involve the addition
of a blanket of CO2 to prevent oxidation.  Most people recommend
a blast of CO2 from a bottled source, preferably through a filter.
For those of us who don't have a ready source of bottled CO2, is it
possible to generate small quantities via some sort of kitchen 
chemistry.  Certainly vinegar and baking soda will make CO2 on
demand, but probably contaminated by vinegar funes.  Could an 
in-line sanitized water scrubber clean up the gas?  Also the
thought crossed my mind that simply heated baking soda will 
liberate CO2 and the heat will probably kill the beasties.  
Has anyone out there tried anything like this?  Thanks in
advance... more of a pondering than a hard need for info.

It should be no sweat.  I have a small fridge that I made into my keg
fridge.  I drilled a 3/8-1/2" hole in the side (from the outside) for
the CO2 line.  Used a file to make it nice.  My CO2 hose fits nice and
snug in there.  I also put a tap in the front.


What I encountered was this sheet metal on the outside, insulation next,
about 1" worth, than plastic.  I doubt you'll encounter freon lines in the
wall of the fridge, but, ya nevah know!

Thanks Jim! Jim stopped by on his recent trip to Calif. We had a few brews
and shot the bull about guess what? Well none of those beers you had Jim had
the grains added at mashout. I would also guess you MIGHT have been
influenced by the FREE beer phenomena. Nah.


Now I know the article that Micah and I authored did suggest this idea of
adding specialty grains at mashout. Well I'll try to give you all some
perspective on my uses of these techniques. For a quick review on the
general ideas behind the article, we stated that adding grains at mashout
was a way to potentially produce more melanoidins. Those malty smelling good
guys. Additionally the grains added at mashout don't leach as much harsh
roasted notes into the final beer probably due to their reduced exposure in
the mash. Well in practice I add specialty grains at mashout for Porters,
Stouts and maybe Bocks. The Porters and Stouts because I want to reduce the
roast grain bite and the Bocks to increase those malty notes. Now I will
also state that a mashout to me is raising the final mash up to about 170f.
It takeas about 10 mins for me to do this. I then rest the mash for 10 mins.
before the start of sparging. I have known of some brewers adding grains at
mashout and not raising the temp. It don't work! As for the amount of grain
required to accomplish the same color, yep it does take a bit more. Maybe
about 20% more as a guess. Try it, you may like it.

Most frig gas lines run up the back of the frig. There isn't USUALLY
anything in the sides except insulation. To be safe, drill a small hole from
the inside, probe and drill slowly and you should be fine. If you hit a gas
line, just plug the leak with a little gum and enjoy those warmer beer flavors.

Its been a few days, so hopefully Jeff wont flame me:-)


California brewpubin' 94, pt 2




Day 3:


gak and I head north, stopping at Marin Brewing.  Ive been
here before and they only had the Mt Tam pale ale online.
Same thing this time except they had some fruit beers. I
realize this place is known for fruit beers, but neither
gak or I are into fruits, so there wasnt much to sample.
We did have an amusing time watching the brewer try to
figure out how to run his DE filter.  The ale is a bit
on the super citrous side, and I like Cascades, but there
is something about the hopping blend in this one that was
not right for my palate.


Next stop, Peteluma Brewing.  Not too much to say here.
I had the sampler, not a winner in the bunch.


On to Mendocino Brewing.  I have really liked the Red Tail
in the past and was looking forward to the visit. Sadly,
all of the products were yeasty, hazy, young and displaying
a ferment character.  I have to wonder if success is getting
in the way of good beer.  I also bought two six's of Red Tail
in the SF Bay area, and the same general faults were found.


On to Anderson Valley via a snowstorm that few Californians
seemed comfortable to drive in.  Fortuneatly, gak found a 
way around them, as I was having flashbacks to the frozen
east coast I had just left.  Unfortuneatly, we drove right
by AV, and so we ended up at Ft. Bragg.


Ft. Bragg was a blast!  A busy coastal town, the bar was
full but we got a place.  A Jazz band played to dinner
and beers.  The beers were excellent.  Red Seal, Trad. Bock
 .....
The area is beautiful, and the pub was well worth a visit.
I could see myself living in this area.


Day 4:


Anderson Valley.  A well stocked selection of beers, 8-9
in total.  All well made beers, with the exception of the
"Belgian Ale:, which sadly displayed the signs of Wyeast
Belgian yeast (phenols and Banana).  A real haven for the
dark beer lover, as three differnet porters/stouts were 
available.  A pretty good ESB had us heading south through
the wine country.


Calistoga Brewing:  located in a little trendy wine tasting
town, the brewery actually had some good beers.  Despite
being warned previously of the lager, I had an excellent
hoppy (dry hopped, but hey, its america) lager and some
good ESB.  


Napa: another loser.


Pacific Coast:  OK, its an extract brewery, so I didnt 
even bother with thier beers, but with about 15 quality
micros on tap, you go for the good stuff.  A Celis Wit
was just right to top it off.  Later in the week I would try thier beers
and for extracts, they really are not bad.  High alcohol high 
hops is the order here.


Good quaffing,

Geez, Gordon sorry to disappoint you. Sez on the bottle:


Pike Place Pale Ale (the standard painted on left coast bottle
                     design)
Microbrewed using the finest...(blah..)
Proudly Brewed & Bottled by Wht River Junct, VT, 05001


Even though I'm a frostbitten Canadian, VT means Vermont to me. :)
The bottle also has redemption states on the back for NY, MA, etc.


Re: the chocolate flavor, perhaps my question was ambiguous. I was
interested in where the chocolate flavor came from in the beer not
where the beer came from. Carlo also noticed the flavor, perhaps it's
something indigenous to Vermont? Are we the only folkes that taste
chocolate in the Pale Ale?


Gordons suggestion to drop by while they're brewing certainly seems
inviting, but the 3000 mile drive makes it a bit of a hassle. If

How about another breaking bottle story...


I only use returnable bar bottles and cap with a bench capper.  I broke a 
bottle a few months ago and what a mess it was!  The bottle disintegrated 
into a gazillion tiny fragments that flew all over the kitchen.  I was cut 
and spent the next two hours cleaning up the mess.  My wife found little 
slivers of glass for days, and was she ever happy about that!


Before I broke the bottle I would to leave a little circular dent on the top 
of each cap.  I decided that I might be applying a little too much pressure, 
so I no longer leave dents in the caps.  I'm convinced that the glass of the 
bottle that broke was flawed, but I don't want to risk applying any more 
pressure then is needed when capping these days.

I believe the misunderstanding is that it is not the concentration of ISO-
alpha acids that is limiting, but the concentration of alpha acids.  A larger
boil volume allows more of sparingly soluble UNISOMERIZED resins to be 
dissolved, allowing more to be isomerized per unit time.  Also, the use of more
hops cannot overcome this solubility limit, so the utilization is decreased
in highly hopped beers.
 
Quote from Malting and Brewing Science, 2nd Ed. pg 489:
In wort boiling higher utilization is obtained from weak worts than from
strong worts [No reference!] and, as may be anticipated from the solubility 
of humulone (Fig. 14.5), hops are utilized more efficiently at low rates than
at high ones.  Indeed, it was concluded that the solubility of humulone
was the limiting factor in its utilization.

from the same cooler (warmer?).  How about adding the specialty grains to

problem I see is a possibly tannin extraction from a high (7 ish) pH.

Message:
Recently I have read George Fix's book on brewing Viennas and 
Oktoberfest beers.  At the end of the book he mentions a technique 
for determining the degrees lovibond in a beer by using a "standard". 
The standard used is Michelob Dark with a known 17 degrees lovibond.  
I've checked all over the place to find Michelob Dark and no one 
carries it anymore.  The question is:  Can I use a substitute if I 
know the degrees lovibond?  For example: Sam Adams Cream Stout is 60 
degrees lovibond (according to one of the brewers).  If I were to 
dilute this roughly 3 times (20 degrees lovibond), could I use 
George's graph in the book?  Hmmm.  Anyone have any suggestions?  
As soon as I master this, I'll demonstrate the technique at our Worry 
Worts club meeting in Milford MA.  Greg.

Yes, Scott, you missed a marketing class.  It's a ploy, a marketing tool,
something to keep people from trying microbrewed beers.


"A perceived need [by the customer] is a need" someone once said.  Let's
say, for example, a company convinced the homebrewing public that knowing
the oil content of your hops will help you get more consistent dryhopped
beers.  Despite the fact that to be useful one must also know what fraction
of that oil is myrcene, companies that label oil content on their hops would
be perceived as having a superior product, which would not necessarily be
the case.

After the weekend north of SF, gak and I found a few 
additional places to quaff.  Heres the summary.


Los Gatos:


Another in the trendy California Brewsterauants mold, lager
brewery, brick oven pizza (painfully expensive for the size,
but it is Los Gatos), large open "German" style beer hall.
The beers were all well made and this makes it worth the
visit.  Nice shirts with the brewery logo, and the brewer
is doing a good job with the beers.


Gordon Biersch, SF:


Well, Dan certainly blew a wad on the sudhaus in this place!
One of those temperature controlled hands off all SS German
breweries.  I kinda like the German flavor of this and the
Palo Alto pubs, but you gotta wonder about the cost benefit 
ratio of such a premium German system over some of the 
better made US ones.  But then again, its been a long time
since Dan has had to worry about cash flow. The unis were 
from Pub brewing.  Dan has changed the logo on the glassware,
so if your a collector, theres new ones to be had.


Typical GB lagers, good refreshing clean Export.  Caramelly
maerzen.  Unfortuneatly, the Dunkles was showing diacetyl. 
Again, brick oven goods, very trendy (at the base of the 
Oakland bay Bridge).  


BTW, the GB served at the San Jose arena was in top form.  
Seemed very close to the quality from the SF and Palo
Alto operations.  Its a real treat to watch a hockey game
and drink a damn good beer.


Thats it, not too much to report, but it was real fun.

I recently came across some cheap c-kegs in a local 
scrap metal yard.  They were pin-lock kegs in excellent
condition, even holding pressure with some syrup residue 
in them.  I cleaned them up and replaced all the o-rings.
Unfortunately, the safety/bleed valves are not like my other
kegs.  My old ones had a pin on the lid that allowed gas
release when pulled.  These valves are nipple shaped and
have no obvious moving parts.  They have platic inserts
that seem to require a special tool to operate.


Well, because the kegs had held pressure when I got them, I
figured that with beer related pressures (10-20 psi) I would
be OK.  However, after sanitizing one with CTSP and boiling
the lid I placed 5 gallons of my latest ale in one of them.
When I went to pressurized the keg, gas leaked from this 
nipple shaped valve!


Does anyone have experience with these C-keg pressure release
 valves?  Are there special tools or replacement
 parts for these valves?  Instructions?
 
 By the way, regarding keg dispensing, Al Korzanos said:

Okay,


Enough with the talk about mashing, sparging, hop rhizomes and all that
garbage. Let's get back to our favorite topic on the HBD: cannabis beer.


I just put a batch into the fermenter about two weeks ago. I put some of
the "special" hops in the boil and then added the rest to the secondary
fermenter. The beer is an IPA with about 6.5% alcohol. I'm going to let
it sit in the secondary for about 10 days and then bottle it (this
weekend)


A friend of mine was telling me that he saw a book on pot beer at our


local head shop. Not that I would ever go into one of those or anything
like that.


I realize that this may not work. The alcohol might not be enough to
dissolve the THC, etc., et al. Don't worry, I got my "special" hops for
free.


Feel free to send comments on your own experiences. I'll be sure to

Subject: Not Boiling the Wort: Ramifications?


Hi Group, 
There is an interesting thread going on in rec.crafts.brewing, with several
novice brewers raising questions on what they are losing or missing by not
boiling the wort, as some of their kits recommend. Hops utilization aside...


The best question to come from this is:
If the wort is not boiled, and the Hot Break does not form and settle to the
bottom, What additional fermentation products could result that could affect
the beers flavor?  


My understanding thus far is that these proteins would remain in solution were
they would be available to the yeast and may be metabolized into fusels,
esters, or the dreaded ring-around-the-collar. (just kidding)


Could some of you brewing chemists comment on this?

There are two in fact:


St. Amand - born ca. 584; founded monasteries in France; patron of everything
related to beer, wine, and brewing.


St. Wenceslaus of Bohemia - born ca. 907; patron of Bohemia and brewers;
martyr (murdered by his own brother in 929).


Or so the story goes....

Subject: back issues of AHA National Conference proceedings


Hi All,
        Al mentions AHA Conference proceedings about calculating proper 
keg pressures (Dave Millers article,1992). I was wondering where one can 
get a copy of these documents. Is it archived anywhere on the net?


thanks,
Wayde Nie

Subject: Fridge modifications.


Hi all,
        Bryan Gros ask about fridge modifications in #1379. To his 
suggestions I would add, seal the hole with silicon when you have fitted 
the line. If you don't then moisture from the air will get into the 
insulation in the fridge wall and cause mold/mildew and will lower the 
insulating ability of your fridge.


HPH, 
Wayde Nie
