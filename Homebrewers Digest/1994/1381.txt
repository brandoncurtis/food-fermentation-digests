Anyhow ...  I just thought I would add that I have done a total

partial mash (a weizen would you believe - looks good too!)).  


Being in a reasonably civilised country I bottle all my beer in 
750 ml bottles.  I use a funny little (read cheap) hand capper

This is then placed over the cap (which is resting on the mouth

Subject: Low ETOH Ales


Low alcohol ales are certainly possible, and can be quite good.
Consider, for example, the various Scottish Ale, Mild Ale, and Bitter
styles:


Style                      OG Range      Alc range    IBUs    Color (SRM)
 - -----                    ------------    ----------  -------  -----------
Scottish Light Ale       1.030 - 1.035   3.0 -  4.0   9 - 15   8.0 - 17.0
Scottish Heavy Ale       1.035 - 1.040   3.5 -  4.0  12 - 17  10.0 - 19.0
English Mild Ale         1.032 - 1.036   2.5 -  3.6  14 - 20  17.0 - 34.0
English Ordinary Bitter  1.035 - 1.038   3.0 -  3.5  20 - 25   8.0 - 12.0


All of these are under 1.040 OG and under 4% alcohol by volume (thus
under 3.2% by weight as required by some states in the US).  I don't
think that anyone who has had a good example of one of these would
disagree that they have flavor.  I recently made a Scottish 70/-
(1.036, so in the "Heavy" category) that was very well received by
Scots friends.  The recipe went something like this:


Scottish 70/- (5 US gallons)


4.5 lbs British pale malt
 .75 lbs Munich malt
 .4 lb Belgian Special B malt


Single infusion mash at 70C, sparge 6 gallons


Boil with 4-5 HBUs bittering hops 60 min.  Flavor/aroma hops optional
(for authenticity, you'd leave them out).


I fermented with YeastLab Irish Ale yeast, but the Wyeast Scottish Ale
might be a better choice.  Don't forget to make a starter.


To make this from extract, start with 5 lbs of amber malt syrup, or
4lbs amber dry malt extract, steep the Special B in water at 160-170F
for 30 minutes and strain into the brewpot.  If doing a reduced volume
boil, you'll need to increase the hops (maybe double).


The key here is introducing a fairly high level of flavor-carrying
malt (primarily the Special B, but also the Munich), and mashing at a
high temperature to keep the fermentable level low (obviously you've
got no control over this in an extract batch, except by which extract
you choose).

I had the new Coors Eis Bock last night and I was very impressed.   It is a 
light amber color with a malt flavor fairly similar to this years 
Winterfest.  (I thought the Winterfest was decent the Eis Bock is good).  It 
had a very good hop bitterness.  Hop bitterness? From Coors?  Yes!  I gave 
it the GBU alpha acid test  (Girl friend Bittering Units).  She tasted it 
and said "hoppy  YUK".  That means it has to be good.   Coors also has a 
pitch on the side of the 6-pack carton for their  Wheat beer coming out this 
summer.

Subject:  Ice Beer


After having tasted Ice Beer, I have determined that it's not the same
stuff as the regular megabrew.  The taste is different, almost
nonexistant.  I really believe that Ice Beer is an attempt to show the
public that there has been some advance in brewing technology that
only the big boys can do. God, if you want to make a beer the average
micorbrewer or homebrewer can't make, start making lambic!
Since they refuse to go through the expense
of going all-malt, they're trying to show you that they've improved in
other ways.  Hell, I just heard a commercial on the radio from Bud
saying how they use rice instead of corn in their beer because it
gives better flavor and is more expensive.  Perhaps these guys never
heard of using, oh, I don't know, say......MALT!  GET A CLUE
MEGABREWS!


I do have to praise some breweries like Coors and Miller for trying to
make a beer other than their usual swill.  Coors has that new Eisbock
and is coming out with a weizen.  Impresses me that they would even
try.  Miller has their reserve and Stout, both of which are at least
an attempt.

Subject: Problem with mites on hops


My Hallertau hop rhizomes are about to start their second growing
season here in Massachusetts.  Last year, they started out
vigorously, but mid to late in the season I got a _large_
infestation of spider mites which totally devastated the vines
and destroyed the few cones that had been produced (they smelled
great before that though).  Since this is the second year, I am
looking forward to a potentially larger cone harvest, and so I
would really like to avoid the same problem.  Can anyone provide
me guidance on controling spider mites WITHOUT the use of a
systemic insecticide?  I will use one if I have to, but I would
prefer a more environmentally harmonious solution.  Thanks.

Subject: A "Q" beer, no, not STAR TREK


Since this get all across the U.S. (and other places) I figured I'd ask.


Is there a brewery (not defunct) that brews a beer that begins with a "Q".
I'm particularly interested if it is available in PA, MD, WV, VA or down the
east coast, including Florida. Also Quebec and Ontario.


It would be nice to know if a "Q" is brewed anywhere in the world, but I
don't intend to fly there to get it. I'm traveling to Montreal' this summer
so Quebec and Ontario are OK. 


To date, the only beer I've heard of WAS from a brewery in Maryland and it
WAS called Queensbrau. I collect bottles and have every letter of the
alphabet (and then some) except "Q".

I bought an EasyMasher(tm) from Jack, I have done my first 2 all-grains
with it, and it is as its namesake suggests easy. My pts/per/lb for the first
batch was 28. I somewhat followed Miller's mashing schedule, and I used
9 lbs 2 row pale malt that was crushed with a motorized Corona. The problems
I have encountered is that the Sparge will stick, my solution is
to pick-up the hose, I attach the racking hose to the spigot, and
it back-flushes the screen and then runs fine. Now I know that
this is probably due to the Corona crush, but I can't afford a roller
mill at this time, and the homebrew store crushes the grain the free.
The other problem is I need a quicker thermometer.   


I think that reguardless of what method you chose to mash, the important
part is to start mashing. I've noticed that the beer is smoother and
doesn't have that bite. The more times you mash the more proficient
you will become. There are probably as many ways to mash as there are
readers of the HBD, and each one of them has there own merits. I guess
the end_all is whatever works for you.

Just a follow-up on my blackberry stout,  I took two bottles to the brew store
for the owner to taste.  While tasting a porter he made, we decide to open up
the stout, even though it was unchilled.  Boy, was it great, no sourness
at all.  The owner (an expert brewer) said it was probably because the chilled
beer numbed the sweetness taste buds making the chilled stout sourer.  I keep
my beer in a fridge at 50 F, guess I'll let the stout sit for an 1/2 or more
before drinking.  Guess some beers need to be drunk at room temp.  Any
thoughts on this.

Subject: "Batch Latch" company info needed


Fellow brewers,


Three or four years ago I purchased some 2 and 2 1/2 gallon beer balls
with hardware to make them sealable and reusable. The system was called
the "Batch Latch", and was offered by a company called Mark C. Fritz
Corp. (or something like that). At the time I also ordered an attachment
that allowed for the use of those little CO2 cartridges, which turned out
not to be worth the plastic it was made from.


During the time since then I took a couple of years off from homebrewing,
but have recently reentered the fray. I seemed to remember this company
also offering a tap attachment that could be connected to a regular CO2
cannister. It occurred to me that a beer ball and a 2 1/2 lb. CO2 cannister
would fit in the bottom of my fridge if I removed the bottom wire shelf.


Amazingly enough I also managed to find an old instruction sheet with the
company's 800 number. So three weeks ago I called and got somebody who
seemed to know what I was talking about. He said the tap had just been
redesigned, and he took my name an address to send me information. However,
I (very stupidly) threw away the paper with their number a couple of days
later.


If anyone has this information, I would very much appreciate you forwarding
it to me (kgriffin`at`ltec.com). Also, if anyone has any experience using the
CO2 tap and could say whether or not it even works reasonably well, that too
would be appreciated. Thanks.


Kyle

Subject: Icebeer: A Theory


        While, as Al points out, Icebeer has been used as a marketing ploy, I
suspect that the real reason for its development was to make beer concentrate
by a gentler process than either boiling it (which would obviously destroy it)
or by high gravity brewing (which tends to make less desireable biproducts and
flavours).  Ever wonder where that hangover comes from when you've had a couple
of beers at the ball game?


        By brewing and fermenting a conventional gravity beer and then freezing
it, you can store the concentrate for lagering purposes and reconstitute it
later at the final product stage.  This is important for a large brewery since
storage tanks cost space and money.  Labatts boasts that they use the ice
crystals for filtration, which may be the case, although I suspect they still
use the diatomaceous filterbeds for final polishing.  The freezing process will
also help precipitate proteins (colloidal stabilization).


        BTW, this does not necessarily make a better beer:  if you don't put the
lots of the good stuff in, you don't get the good stuff out.

The smell you get from vinegar is mostly acetic acid, which boils at ~135C;
the reason you can smell vinegar at room temperature is that you can sense
acetic acid in very small quantities. I would \expect/ that this quantity
wouldn't be perceived in a batch of beer; you could probably reduce the
amount of acetic acid by chilling the vinegar and/or putting the generator
in an ice bath---this is likely to involve less plumbing than a scrubber.
But you'd probably need to run the system a while to flush all the oxygen,
and if you just mix soda and vinegar you're likely to get an eruption; this
is what powers old-style fire extinguishers.

You can also buy the cans with German Beer in them at many Lic.

means college seniors go ape over my homebrew and can't wait to do it

I get a shot of yeast in the first pint, then none after that.  You can dump
the prime sugar into the can, or add it to the beer before kegging. 
Anyway I love the system.  You can easily keg several small batches
and have different styles on hand, or do large batches in small kegs
keeping some in storage.  


Sterility is with BBrite a rinse and then the oven for a short blast to

Fox (or probably your local homebrew store) can sell you a new lid with the

 I find it necessary to add bunches of calories to the mash and I

 As I mentioned, stirring is the necessary evil of kettle mashing, no matter 
 how it is later lautered.  The convenience of the em lies in not having to 
 transfer the mash to a separate lauter tun after mashing.  This evolves from 
 the fact that one can stir the mash with the em installed.  The strainer is a 
 3/8" dimeter tube only six inches long which does not present any particular 
 problem that is not dealt with in routine stirring.
 
 As far as damage to the screen, it almost as stiff as the copper tube itself 
 and I have yet to hear from a single customer (out of over 1000 sold)  with a

 Don't believe I suggested that they do not work.  However, not having 
 George's review at hand, I would want to know "increased extract yield" over 
 what?
 
 The last batch I made with an EASYMASHER and a fixed MM produced 10 gallons 
 of wort at 1.050 from 14 lbs of Belgian pils malt.  You'al can do the yield 
 calculations, I am too humble to lay out the number.  I normally use my 
 motorized adjustable mill set very fine but I just wanted to re-assure myself 
 that the statements I make about the fixed mill producing the same yield is 
 valid even in batches larger than the typical hombebrewer's 5.  I normally 
 get a yield over 30 but this was a very plesant surprise.
 
 Neither will I argue about the pinpoint temp control but I will ask, just 
 what good is it and how does one use that to justify the cost?   Answer again 
 is probalby ... fun.
 
 Less labor for RIMS is a given but I get a lot of flak from people when I 
 brag about the throughput of the MM.  I also suspect that one could save more 
 labor per buck spent by motorizing a MM than by buying/building a RIMS.
 
 Finally, I am not criticizing RIMS, just trying to look at it realistically.

Fellow Brewers,


  A quick question for those with more experience.  In the days when I
used dry yeast, fermentation would complete in a week or less.  Now that I
have switched to liquid yeast, I find that fermentation takes two weeks to
complete.  Is this unusual?  I always use a 32 ounce starter, pitched at
my best estimation of "high kraeusen" (12-24 hours in the starter, and
showing a large head of foam).  Fermentation always starts quickly, within
6 hours, but ferments a lot longer than dry yeast.  I've seen this effect
with Wyeast British, Belgian white, and a few others.


Thanks,

Pickin's are kinda slim in Chicago right now. Two brewpubs

GOOSE ISLAND is the best. One of the best anywhere, in fact. Always a
good lineup of specialty beers. Good food too. In the city on the near
north side at 1800 N Clyborn.


TAYLOR STREET, Naperville. Brand new. Might not even be producing beer
yet, but the restaurant is open and they have some micros on tap.


MELROSE, overlooking I-90 in Barrington. Primarily a restaurant. Good
brewers trying hard, despite limitations of extract system. Some of their
beers are brewed for them by Capitol of Madison Wisconsin, under
contract.


WEINKELLER (2 locations - Berwyn and Westmont) Westmont seems to turn out
better beer. Berwyn has a cramped small brewery that limits the quality
of their own beers, but has good food, a list of 500 bottled beers, and
often some good micros on tap.


BREWMASTER'S PUB, Kenosha Wisconsin. Just a stone's throw across the

BEST BEER BARS:


O'CALLAHAN'S, Hubbard `at` Dearborn, Downtown Chicago. Crowded on weekdays
after work; quiet and relaxing on weekends. 8 taps including Pilsner
Urquel. Simple bar food.


BLUE CRAB LOUNGE/SHAW'S CRAB HOUSE, Hubbard `at` Wabash, Downtown Chicago. A
half dozen oysters go so well with a pint of a good hoppy microbrewery
beer. Very very good, but expensive, seafood on the restaurant menu.


QUENCHERS, Fullerton `at` Western, Chicago. (just west of I-94 at Fullerton

          "professional-quality" equipment, come back a week or two later 
          and bottle (CO2 is injected), and take the beer home.  No clean-

Subject: Grains at mashout


Thanks to Bob Jones for commenting on mashing specialty grains.  I've
had a few questions waiting patiently for the next time this topic
came up.


Does the practice of adding specialty grains at mashout to improve malty
aroma work for all grains/styles?   If this is the case then one must 
decide, based on style, when to add specialty grains.  I noticed that in 
practice, you only add specialty grains at mashout for dark beers (different 
reasons for different styles) e.g. a Munich might need the more malty aroma 
while it might not be as appropriate for a Ordinary Bitter.


The next question was: Is it the mashout that does it, or just a shorter
mash time (e.g. no mashout).  Bob, you said it don't work.  Why don't it 
work?  


My third question was about color and whether the color potential of the
grain was affected.  Bob, you guessed 20% more grain (and therefore color 
potential) is necessary.  Is this due to steeping time? In other words, a 
finer crush might help?  How much of the extract potential of the grain
is available from mashout-only.  Will boosting specialty grains by 20%
to meet color requirements affect the extract balance?


Finally, a 10 minute rest after the mash out was mentioned.  I have
never purposefully done this, for no other reason than I didn't know
about it when I started mashing, and I haven't had problems that I
couldn't trace elsewhere.  Is the purpose of the post-mash rest just
time, or are you letting the mash settle onto/over the straining device?
It usually only takes a few minutes to transfer the mash to the lauter tun 
and get everything in place to lauter.  One quick stir to set the bed, and 
away I go.


***


For me, one of the most interesting things about brewing is not being 
rigidly confined to style guidelines.  I set out to make my first pilsner 
(czech) this winter.  I first went out and sampled various examples to
set the mood.  I got to wondering what a pilsner made towards the extreme 
of, say Celebration Ale, would be like.  So 40+ IBU and a generous
dryhopping later, I'm quite pleased.  (Help, I think I'm becoming a hophead!)

To the first point, I believe you are right that in beer we are nowhere
near the iso-alpha acid saturation point.  OTOH, I don't think anyone
has ever claimed that the effect is due to limited solubility of
iso-alpha acids.  My interpretation of literature is that most believe
that somehow it is the isomerization reaction itself that is 
inhibited by the higher hopping rate.  No one is sure of the mechanism
but there are lots of theories.  The effect is well documented.  It
is not some theory I invented myself.


Based on an admittedly limited but reliable set of data, I have come up
with a hop rate correction factor that can be applied to Rager's formula.
It looks like:


HF = ( IBUs / 260) + 1  and is used along with the GA factor in Rager's
formula.  So anyplace in Rager you find (1+GA)  change it to: (1+GA) * HF.


This is for full volume boils.  For partial boils one needs to factor in
the increased hop rate due to the lower boil volume.  It looks like:


HF =  ( ( ( Final Volume / Boil Volume) * IBUs ) / 260 ) + 1


Note that this works only in Rager's "solve for ounces or grams" equations.
If you want to solve for IBUs we have a problem in that HF is based on IBUs
and we don't know what they are yet.  Both Glenn Tinseth and George Fix
gave me quadratic equations to solve the problem, but they are quite complex.
(Please don't construe this as their endorsement of the equation.)
Instead I propose a "trial and error" approach where you would perform
the "solve for IBUs" equation without HF, and since we know the answer will
be too high, reduce it by say 10%, calculate HF based on this number and then
perform the "solve for weight" equation and see how close you are.  You might
have to do this a few times to "zero in" on it.


A last note: please accept this in the spirit with which it is offered:
It is an approximation.  It ain't perfect.  It needs a lot more field
testing and as a brewing community we may decide that the constant (260)
needs to be another number, or we may toss the whole thing out with the
spent hops and grain.  If you don't like it, just leave it out of
of the equation.

Make up a 1qt starter with Wyeast Belgian (1214).


In 7qt water


Steep 12 oz Cara-Pils to 180F, remove.  Boil, add 3# G.W. Kent Dutch
Unhopped Light dry, 1 3.3# box/bag Bries/Northwestern Weizen (60%/40%)
syrup, and 1# honey.  Boil 10 min.  Add 1/2 oz. 4.5% Willamette [in
retrospect, I would use 3/4oz or 1oz], boil 45 min.  Add 2t irish
moss.  Boil 15 min.  Add 1/2oz Saaz.  Boil two min.  Remove from heat.
Add 3 12oz bags cranberries, crushed, pretty much thawed.  Steep 15
minutes.  Chill.  Adjust to volume in carboy, aerate at least 8 min (I
use filtered air via a pump).  Add 2oz lactose boiled 5 min in 1.5c
water and yeast starter from above.


I didn't need a blow-off (but YMMV).


Primary for 6 days, secondary for 3 or 4 weeks.  May have very strong
chill haze, I'd just let it be.


Prime as usual w/ 3/4c priming sugar.

wort stains from the bottom of the pot by putting it in my oven and
putting the oven through its self-cleaning cycle.  This resulted (as I
had feared) in a badly discolored brewpot (now a copper color)--but at
least the bottom is clean!!  Is this discoloration harmful to brewing
beer?  If so, how do I get rid of it?  I have already tried Comet and
Brasso to no avail.

  Alan of Austin asked if the "off" flavors in his friend's brew might
have been caused by mixing two varieties of Wyeast.  I would say that,
since one of the varieties was added after being in a starter, there is
a good chance that the mixing created the off flavors.  Not, as you
suspected, because of any weird genetic mutations but simply because too
much yeast was added.  Adding too much yeast can create an undesirable
flavor called "yeast bite".

Andy asks about minikegs...
 
First, I bought mine locally, but they are also available mailorder
from BrewHaHa. The local price was very close to the mail price, so
it was worth it to patronize local biz.
 
You don't need a tank and regulator. You prime the minikeg just like
a bottle, except cut your priming sugar in half. The tapper holds a
CO2 cartridge in the handle. When you are ready to tap, the CO2 cart
merely displaces the beer as you dispense, so you don't get air in the
beer. You do not force prime.
 
If you're gonna drink it fast, there is a party pump style tapper,
that you just pump with your hand to build pressure. This tapper was
actually more expensive than the CO2 style, although the carts at $1
each add to the cost.
 
Pretty close to Real Ale, and it fits in your fridge.<g>
 
Re: cutoff kegs...
 
I'd be interested in the phone # of the folks that sell cutoff kegs,
too. Thanks in advance.
