In addition to the use of standard twist drills for drilling through

      Brian,        
 
        I have found that autolysis starts after about 12-14 days in my
primary. It is dependent on the temperature and the yeast. A standard 
condition at my home brewery is 72F and EDME ale yeast. The off flavors 
that are indicative of autolysis are due to the deterioration of the yeast
cells on the fermenter bottom. You should be noticing a yeasty flavor 
with a hint of dirty sock! The flavor is much more pronounced when the 
brew is not chilled. If you haven't chilled it yet do so and let it sit 
for a couple weeks and enjoy.

I'm not a metalurgist, but I did work in my uncle's metal fabrication
shop for a summer years ago.  When SS gets too hot it discolors.  That's
what happened to yours when you put it in the self-clean cycle (doesn't
that get up to something like 500F?).


I don't think you can remove it, but I don't believe it will hurt your
brewing.

I've got a pile of old Pin-Locks that I use regularly, WITHOUT any
sort of pressure relief mechanism on the lids.  The surest and
easiest way to releive pressure from these cans is to simply apply
the business end of a Robertson screwdriver to the gas-in poppet.
Keep the screwdriver as clean as you would the pin mechanism in the
CO2 attachment on your gas bottle.

Scott Wisler asks some more questions.....

The effect on ANY style can be subtle to major. A lot depends on things we
haven't even talked about. Such things as : what type of specialty grain,
the freshness of the crack, etc. Just consider this technique another knob
on the final flavor and aroma. sort of like dry hopping or late hopping is
to bitterness.




>The next question was: Is it the mashout that does it, or just a shorter
>mash time (e.g. no mashout).  Bob, you said it don't work.  Why don't it 
>work?  


Yes, it is both the shorter mash AND the higher temps needed to acheive
optimum benefit from grains added at mashout.


>My third question was about color and whether the color potential of the
>grain was affected.  Bob, you guessed 20% more grain (and therefore color 
>potential) is necessary.  Is this due to steeping time? In other words, a 
>finer crush might help?  How much of the extract potential of the grain
>is available from mashout-only.  Will boosting specialty grains by 20%
>to meet color requirements affect the extract balance?


Sure the color is effected. That's why you need to add more grain to acheive
the same effective color. I don't think a finer crush is a better answer. A
good crush is alway preferred. I assume you mean extract yield when you say
extract balance. The yield or goodness extracted from grains added at
mashout is reduced, again thats why one might consider adding 20% more than
normal. All this is a guess on my part. It ain't science here we are talking
about with this technique, it's art! I would suggest some of the people who
have tried it, chime in with their experience, both positive and negative.




>Finally, a 10 minute rest after the mash out was mentioned.  I have

I see the 10 min. rest at mashout more as a steep time for the specialty
grains (if added) and a mash stabilization stage. The bed probably is
effected some, but I would say most of the bed forming mechanics are driven
by grain crush and runnoff speed/rate.

Subject: Cleaning Stainless steel


Hi Group,
Tim Lawson wrote about putting his stainless steel pot thru the self cleaning
cycle of his oven to remove wort stains and that afterward it had turned a
coppery color.


Unfortunatly that was probably not a good thing to do. The two types of
Stainless steel used for cookware, Austenitic and Ferritic, do not like high
heat.  Good brewpots e.g. Vollrath, and beer kegs are austenitic (300 series).
Ferritic stainless is usually used for flatware and utensiles because it is
cheaper. Ferritics are weakly magnetic while austenitics are not. If anyone has
purchased an inexpensive! stainless brewpot it is probably Ferritic. This is
not bad, its just not great. It is less acid neutral and may give a metallic
taste.


So, back to cleaning. Both of these types of stainless are prone to high
temperature embrittlement. Embrittlement occurs around 850F +/- 100F. I doubt
the self-cleaning cycle got that high, but FYI. The change in color is due to
oxidation of the surface, unfortunately high temperature oxidation tends to
penetrate along the grain boundaries and become permanent. There is an oxalic
acid based stainless steel cleanser in the supermarkets here called Kleen King.
It is very good at removing these oxides. This will work for restoring most of
the silvery finish inside and out. In the future though, I would recommend Easy
Off oven cleaner or the Kleen King, instead of the oven. Just rinse well. I
think using the pot as-is would definitly result in metallic tastes.

Subject: Lagering in Bottles/Kegs




I posted this to rec.crafts.brewing several days ago and got no response,
so I thought I'd give it a shot on the HBD.


I've just bought a lagering fridge and Hunter AirStat so I'm starting to plan
my first "real" lager.  I was reading a few brief paragraphs in Miller's
TCHOHB on lagering, and he mentioned that most commercial brewers krausen/
prime the beer *BEFORE* lagering, whereas most homebrewers lager in a
carboy, prime, and then bottle/keg.  He mentioned that a closer approximation
to traditional lagering techniques would be to prime and bottle/keg the
beer after secondary fermentation, and then lager the already primed
bottles/kegs at low temperatures.


One advantage I can see to this method is that you wouldn't have the problem
of yeast going dormant by extended lagering since they would already have
done their work (re: carbonation) before lagering started.  I would probably
keep the bottles at fermentation temperature for several days after priming
before slowly reducing the temperature to ~35F for extended lagering.


Does anyone have any experience doing this?  If this is a bad idea I'd
appreciate hearing it, but I think I'll try it on my next batch (a
Bohemian Pilsner).

P.S.  I bottled my first all-grain batch (steam beer) last week and it
      tasted *AWESOME* at bottling time.  Can't wait to try it "for real"
      in another week or so.  No extract beer ever tasted that good!

Subject: Indiginous recipies in last Zymurgy


Dear Brewers,


In the last issue of Zymurgy, there was an article about indigenous
brews of the Himalayas and the Andes.  I am interested in trying my
hand at the Andian recipe for "chicha," which is a corn-based brew.
The recipe calls for the corn to be malted, cracked then brewed in a
fashion similar to brewing with barley.  The problem is (or are) that
I've never malted any grain before nor even brewed an all-grain beer
before.  Further, it is quite difficult to find grain corn that
hasn't been treated with a fungicide (?), especially in the city of
Chicago!  I've been to health food stores, and even called a few
feed stores, but all of their corn had already been treated.  So my
question is (or are) might someone in the Chicagoland area know where
I might get some of this type of corn.  (For that matter, might anyone
know if or where I can order this corn - not as an adjunct, but in
simple grain form?)  Finally, has anyone else tried brewing with
corn as a primary ingredient... Or tried malting it?  I'd greatly
appreciate any insights and or advice about this, and I will post
a summarization of the responses I receive for the interests of
other adventurous brewers.


Thanks, and Cheers!,

PROPOSAL:  The First (?) Internet Beer Research Project


<This is being posted in alt.beer, rec.crafts.brewing, rec.food.drink.
beer, the Homebrew Digest and the JudgeNet Digest>


The debate about porter vs stout has be going on intermitently for as
long as I've been around the net.  I suspect that we are as likely to
come up with the definitive answer as we are to dolving the mystery of
the 33 on the Rolling Rock bottles. 


Typically, I've thought of stouts as opaque, black ales, with a strong
roast/burnt malt bite and porters as softer flavoured cousins that
might be somewhat translucent, but with nearly as much body.  Yet I've
had several porters that had significantly more bite than draught
Guinness and stout that were softer than draught Guinness. 


I've never assumed stouts and porters to be substanially different in
OG, except when it comes to Imperial Stouts.  Yet, the porters (p 113)
and stouts (p 116) listed in Eckhardt would be rather good data for an
exercise in disciminant analysis, giving some support to a post seen 
recently.  However, Eckhardt has been known to be slightly
unconventional in his categorization of beer. 


I've read most of the folklore about the origins of the names stout 
and porter, and their history since.  Personally, I would like to take 
a more scientific/academic approach, rather than the urban.folklore 
speculations that are so prevalent on the net.  Therefore, I am 
proposing a collaborative research project to resolve the question of 
what constitutes stout vs porter.


Please feel free to post or email your comments.  To readers in the 
either of the Digests, I suggest we not carry on the submissions and 
discussions in either of these places.

Subject: Home-Grown CO2




In a recent HBD, Steve Scampini asks about CO2 from
a vinegar reaction and its drawbacks. One solution
is to use dry ice instead (dry ice beer? has Bud 
thought of that one yet?). Dry ice is available at
many major grocery stores and isn't very expensive.
Just drop some in your partially (or fully) filled
fermenter and besides just plain looking cool, it
will displace any oxygen as it melts. Amaze your
friends, scare your kids, or just just make your 
wife roll her eyes and shake her head, mumbling 
something about juvenile, neanderthal...              
   I dont know about the purity of dry ice (someone
posted something once about oil in welding grade
oxygen?), but I have never had any problems. Please
be careful, disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer, 
dry ice is awful chilly stuff and it could crack a
carboy under the right conditions. Hope this helps.

Another example:  One will find a certain type of person who finds it

almost every day, sometimes 2-3 times in a single day!  Howver, one

Surprise!  It's brewed in Vermont and in Indianapolis as well as at the
origin, Seattle.  I've tasted only the Seattle and Indianapolis versions
and there are big differences.  No chocolate flavor, but the hop nose
in the Seattle version was just wonderful -- the Indianapolis version
nose was just okay.

The two questions ARE probably related.  I sanitize my racking tube by soaking
it in a carboy full of either Bleach+water or One-step+water.  Think about it.
When you put the racking tube in the carboy, you are actually wetting the
entire length that has potential for contacting the beer or the neck of the
carboy.  The sour/yeasty smell and cloudy appearance is probably due to a wild
yeast and possibly also a bacterial infection.  Once the tube gets scratched
up, just replace it.  Is saving $2.00 on a racking cane worth blowing $20 on
ingredients?

The obvious (not cutting into any lines or wires) is only one concern.
Another is long term.  The space between the inside and outside walls
of a fridge is filled with insulation.  The inside wall is generally
colder than the room.  Therefore, if you put a hole in the outside wall
of a fridge, make sure to seal it up well with bathtub caulk or something
similar so that room moisture is not attracted in through the hole,
eventually soaking the insulation and making your fridge less efficient
(not to mention the possibility of creating a breeding ground for moulds).


For this reason and the fact that I was not going to pour a pint every
day (fear of mould in the faucet) I chose to keep everything (including
the CO2 tank inside the fridge (yes, it's alright to keep the CO2 tank
inside the fridge).

Yes, I'm hoping to someday restart the mailorder.  I'm glad you did find
some sources.  Forget the glass blower route -- I tried that and got
quotes you would not believe!  Incidentally, I would not turn down a
desperate homebrewer -- after all, I'm a homebrewer first and I'm doing

Subject:  5 Liter Mini Kegs


Well, I got a lot of responses from people regarding 5 Liter
minim-kegs.  I thought I'd summarize my findings.


1- You need 4 kegs to keg a five gallon batch
2- Same as a Cornelius, first tap all yeast, the rest all clear
3- Complete kit prices range from $49.95 to $65 depending where you go
4- The taps are availabel in plastic or all metal varieties.  The
   metal ones increase the cost of the setup by another $25-30.
5- The setup uses CO2 cartridges, like a pellet gun, and a keg will go
   through about 3-4 of these babies before you're done tapping.


Most people had a friend that had a mini-keg setup and their friend
loved it.  I did't get mail from anyone who actually owned one
themselves.  But, I'm convinced.  I'm stopping to get one on the way
home today.  I'll be kegging this weekend!

 >From: mosher`at`sidmav01.us.dg.com (Steve Mosher)
 
 >I bought an EasyMasher(tm) from Jack, I have done my first 2 all-grains
 with it, and it is as its namesake suggests easy. My pts/per/lb for the first
 batch was 28. I somewhat followed Miller's mashing schedule, and I used
 9 lbs 2 row pale malt that was crushed with a motorized Corona. The problems
 I have encountered is that the Sparge will stick, my solution is
 to pick-up the hose, I attach the racking hose to the spigot, and
 it back-flushes the screen and then runs fine. Now I know that
 this is probably due to the Corona crush, but I can't afford a roller
 mill at this time, and the homebrew store crushes the grain the free.
 
 Several things come to mind here:
 
 First of all, we need a definition of a "stuck mash".  I would suggest that 
 what you described is simply clogged plumbing and as you point out the 
 resolution is simple and elegant.  The cause may or may not be the mill and 
 as I never have this problem, you may be right.
 
 It would be useful to know if the problem occurs with malt crushed by the 
 retailer and what sort of mill they are using.
 
 I think the recognized definition of a stuck mash is when the entire mash 
 becomes compacted and impermeable to the flow of sparge water and back 
 flushing all day will not fix it.   I have never "enjoyed" this experience 
 either but I suspect it is usually related to temperature or allowing the 
 water level to drop below the top of the grain.
 
 >The other problem is I need a quicker thermometer.
 
 I find the most practical to be dial/probe types.  I have a short piece of 
 copper wire wrapped around the probe under the dial and hooked over the lip 
 of the kettle and haven't come up with anything that works any better.  Lag 
 time is on the order of 15 seconds and this is easy to live with.

Subject: Plastics and Permiability


Thanks Al for the O2 permeability chart.


Qualitatively, this tells me how polyproplene ranks with respect to
other plastics.  I.e. much better than LDPE, but not as good as HDPE,
and some others.  It also gives some quantative information.


Rearrange slightly to look at units:
>Plastic                      
                                            10^-10  (cc-m)
                        O2 Permiability in          ---------
                                                 (sec-cm^2-cmHg)




This is telling me how much gas gets through (the cc-m part)
on a per unit time, per unit area basis at a given pressure (the
sec-cm^2-cmHg part) ..  cc = cubic centimeter, m=mole? (can you clarify?, 
I don't understand the numerator units.)  I would think that the cmHg
(Pressure, in centimeters of Mercury) is the difference in partial 
pressure of O2 across the plastic membrane.  In our case, this is
approximately equal to the partial pressure of O2 in the atmosphere, 15.2 
cmHg at sea level.


The O2 that gets through helps form an aldehyde (if I remember
correctly).  What is the taste threshold for this chemical?  


What I am driving towards here is this:  The taste threshold is a mass
fraction of the undesireable chemical.  Using the volume in the
fermenter, you can determine a bound for the tolerable mass of O2.
(Assuming that all the O2 that permeates through goes to aldehydes). 
Then using your fermenter geometry and the above permeability data, you
can determine the length of time you can leave your beer in a particular
plastic fermenter.  (I would include a healthy safety factor)


A couple observations:


As the fermenter gets bigger, the potential of a problem decreases. 
This is because volume increases like the radius squared, and area increases
like the radius.  There is more area for O2 to get through, but far more
volume to distribute the O2 over.


It is better to fill a plastic fermenter to capacity than to use it
half full.  A half full fermenter has the same area exposure to O2 as a
full one, but less volume to distribute the permeated O2 over.


Since a small fermenter (like my 2 gallon bottle) is a potential 
problem, there are some things that can be done.  I could enclose it in
something non-permeable.  Al, how bout selling me a couple square feet of
that proprietary plastic hop wrap?  :)

Subject: Acid (not the mind expanding kind)


I'm using the water treatment spreadsheet that recently appeared in the
September/October issue of Brewing Techniques.  (Yes, I also incorporated
the corrections which appeared in the November/December issue :-)  Phosphoric
acid has been the tool of choice when I need to acidify my mash and sparge
water and I have been diluting it as per Miller's recommendations in NCJOHB.
However, the spreadsheet is set up to figure 0.1M concentrations and their
effects on the water in question.  So, what I need from you chemistry types
is a way to make a 0.1M solution from the concentrated solution.  The 
concentrated USP Phosphoric acid I use has the following specifications:


Formula Weight: 98.00
Molarity:  14.7
Specific Gravity:  1.7
Weight Percent: 85
Chemical Formula: H3PO4


I've been away from college chemistry WAY too long to figure this out and
I know the answer is relatively straightforward, but I don't want to just
guess at how to go about it.  You know, my original major was microbiology
and I took quite a few chem/physics/bio classes.  If I'd have known how much
some of it would have helped my in my present hobby, I would have paid more
attention to the boring lecturers I had (on second thought, nah).

Take the Grolsch bottles!  I have been using them ever since I began
making homebrew and IMHO they are great.  No capper, no broken bottles,
they hold 16 oz., and they look neat.  I make up computer generated labels
for them, front and back, and glue them on with white Elmer's glue.  I
have over 400 of them.


Store the rubber gaskets separately in a plastic Zip-Lok bag.  They can be
boiled to sterilize them.  Replacements are available from most homebrew
suppliers.


When filling the bottles, I just flip the stopper with a gasket attached
over the mouth of the bottle, but don't lock the wire bail down.  This
allows the yeast to generate a small amount of CO2 to purge any air out
of the bottle neck.  After a while I lock all the filled bottles closed.


One 5 gallon batch of homebrew fills about 35, 16 oz. Grolsch bottles.
I always brew with 40 bottles ready to be filled.


If you want some more, try local bars that serve Grolsch in those bottles
or ask your dad to drink more Grolsch and give you the empties.

Subject: mixing yeast strains/grains at mashout


Tim suggests that Alan's off flavors were from yeast bite.  This is a topic
I'm glad to see brought up, because I've done some rough scaling to compare
some microbrewery pitching rates with what homebrewers use.  On some
heavily pitched batches, it looks like they use the equivalent of 1 or 2 
cups of pure yeast (not slurry with yeast mixed in, but pure yeast) per 5
gallon batch.  Since this does not seem to produce yeast bite in their 
beers, I conclude that homebrewers tend to worry too much about yeast bite.
The trouble here is that I know things don't always scale directly from
micro sized batches to homebrew sizes.  Do any of the more experienced 
brewers out there have any numbers on when yeast bite might start to occur?
As it stands, I don't think the off flavors Alan talks about are from yeast
bite, it doesn't sound like you used that much.  I haven't thought of 
any other explanation either.   


Thanks Bob for the info on adding grains at mashout.  I don't have access
to your original article, but I wish I did.  Have you done side-by-side
comparisons between adding dark grains during the mash or at mashout?  Is
there a noticable difference?  FWIW, I've been adding grains at mashout
on some of my brews.  The jury's still out on whether it adds anything.
OTOH, I'll try anything for more maltiness in my beers.
