Subject: Unmalted adjuncts - mash or boil


Regarding the question of whether unmalted cereals need mashing: obviously they
do, if one wishes to convert the starch into fermentable sugars. On the other
hand, that is not the only reason for using adjuncts, eg, the use of oats to
provide proteins and glucans in stouts. If you can waste the extract, and live
with a starch haze, then in theory, you should just be able to boil the
cereals, provided that they are unhulled. This typically results in a large
amount of fluffy hot break, which I prefer not to ferment. Unfortunately for
extract brewers, I do seem to get better head retention when I mash the
adjuncts. Speculative reasons: (a) they contain proteins of the wrong size, and
need a protein rest to have a useful effect (b) converting the starch to sugar
somehow makes the rest of the cereal more soluble (c) lipids (oils) in the
cereal are trapped in the grain bed during sparging, instead of being passed on
into the boiler. It has been observed before that even flaked oats contain a
relatively large amount of lipid. On the other hand, look at what happens when
you make porridge, then extrapolate that effect to beer ...

my believe is that the screen is clogged, and that by back flushing it clears
a path for the wort to flow. This "problem" is not a big deal. It is easily
rectified by just picking up the hose above the spigot.

The malt is milled by a motorized Corona at the retailer. for what its worth
I pour the malt into a 5 gallon bucket which flows into a wide funnel at
the bottom of the bucket, to the hopper of the corona. The retailer is
American Brewmaster in Raleigh, N.C.

This did not happen. Just by the action of draining the wort through the
grain causes the bed to compact, but I haven't not to stir the bed
to get the flow going.

The formula to use for dillutions is quite simple.
        C1 * V1 = C2 * V2


where CX is concentration (M, or Molarity in this case)
and   VX is Volume; 1 is the initial case, 2 is the dilluted.


In your case :


(14.7M ) * V1 = (0.1M) * V2


or 


V2/V1 = 147


This means that you need to add 146 parts water to 1 part H3PO4


NOTE:  you don't add 147, as 1 part in the 147 is the acid


This formula will work with any concentration units, %, ppm, etc.

 I think you are creating a problem where none exists.  Compare what you are 
 considering with the absolute enzyme destruction in large proprotions of the 
 mash with decoction.  
 
 Furthermore, you only need as much bottom heat as is required to compensate 
 for the heat loss.  This requires only a very small flame and ocassional 
 stirring to redistribute the heat.  I would suggest that this is far less 
 hassle  that dealing with an insulated kettle.

I haven't seen anyone talking about this and I did it for the first time
tonight and it worked so well that I thought I'd share it.


I have been kegging for a long time, but rescently I have moved and do not
(yet) have access to an extra refridgerator.  So I had to go back to
botteling.  This is what I did.  I boiled my priming sugar as usual, and
sterilized my bottles w/ a bleach solution as usual.  But I also sterilized
my keg.  I racked the wort into the keg along with the sugar, mixed it well,
caped it and used my co2 bottle to drive the wort into the bottles.  The
control of the flow was extremely easy, and I never had to worry about losing
the siphon, I also didn't have to use  a hose clamp.  I spilled so little
wort, that I think I will be botteling much more often.  Also, when the keg
blew off, there was less than half of a bottle left in it, so minimal waste. 
Hope this helps someone.

Help!! I'm brewing my first three digit batch (100 gals), and the yeast 
won't start!! I am using "Red Star" brand ale\beer yeast. I made a wort
and pitched the yeast in at 90 degrees, and after four hours, no sign of a 
rise. If I can't get the little beasties going, I'm gonna have a lot of brew 
just sitting around. Should I put it all into carboys with ferment lockers, 
and wait until to-morrow to get different yeast, or should I pitch the 
yeast I have despite the lack of activity? I have never had this type of a 
lag in the yeast before.


Please reply as soon as you can! I'm in San Francisco, and the local time 
is 10:00 pm. 


Thanks!!!

Subject: Red Alert! My yeast is weak. Help!


Yahoo! I just brewed my biggest batch ever, 100 gal. Had a some problem
with the yeast, so I thought I'd see if anyone had some advice.
 
I used Red Star Ale yeast, pitching it into 4 cups of a malt\water
solution at 95 degrees following the instructions on the package. After 5
hours, there was no activity, so I made another starter, this time starting
at 90 degrees. After 4 hours, there was some activity, but not much. In a
panic I looked up the yeast info in the HBD archives, and saw that Red
Star has had problems in the past but was supposed to be better now.
Not having anymore yeast, and it being past midnight, I pitched it into
the wort and went to bed.
 
Next morning, no activity. Yikes!! In a full panic, I went to the local
home-brew store, and was assured that the yeast was OK, as the owner
said he has been using this yeast for a while now, with good result. I
bought a bunch more yeast, and this time made the starter at 85 degrees,
following advice from the home-brew store. This time it did take off.
 
Next morning, (today) there is a head on the beer, but only an inch. I am
used to having at least six inches or so. The beer has been sitting at 65
degrees for about eighteen hours now, since the final addition of yeast.
 
Here are the questions: Does Red Star Ale yeast suck, or was I unlucky?
Is 95 degrees too hot? I have always pitched it at 90 degrees. Should I
worry about infection due to the long lag time? Everything was super
sterilized, using sodium metabisulphite. I have never had a problem
with yeast before, out of 60+ batches.
 
I'm really nervous, with so much brew at stake. Ahy help or comments
would be greatly apprieciated.

time to answer the endless newbie questions on the hbd.  (This is not

very tiring to me, and I give credit to anyone who can keep it up.  Also, 
in most cases he doesn't mention that he runs a supply store unless somebody 
else brings it up.

Is this oven step wise?  I've only intermittently used my minikeg over
the year I've had it, but I vaguely recall someone/something mentioning that
these things had a thin plastic lining?  While it was mentioned in the

Subject: First Time Liquid Yeast User Problem...


I brewed the other night and used liquid yeast (Wyeast) for the first time. 
Well I bought Wyeast #1028 (London) and I "started" it the night before and 
by the time I used it it had blown up nicely. Being meticulous as I usually 
am while I brew, I did everything as I usually do. I'm still an extract 
brewer but an all-grain wanna-be. I have been told that liquid yeast could 
tremendously increase the quality of my brew. So since I am already very 
happy with my beer, at least at this extract level, I figured I would make 
the same exact batch of my amber ale and utilize liquid yeast instead. 
Everything was going smoothly until I opened the ballooned foil packet of 
Wyeast. It exploded all over the place. I think enough got into the wort 
though since it is bubbling. I made it a point to use a disinfected 
scissors and just snipped the corner of the packet. I had yeast on my 
cabinets in all directions. Can someone let me know how I should've opened 
this packet???

      Distinguished Micro-Brew info this not but it's info to say
 the least.


      Those interested here are a few facts on the Miller Reserve
 Products via Miller reps talking to the Beer Barons of Milwaukee
 Homebrew Club.


      Lager (New formula since last Sept.) approx. 15 IBU's and an
 original Frederick Miller Lager Yeast dating back to when good
 old Fred brought it to this country. Main malt is a 6-row, with
 some light crystal.


      Amber Ale  approx. 22 IBU's, a British Ale Yeast fermented
 at ale temps., 6-row malt, with some light crystal.


      Velvet Stout approx. 30 IBU's, same British Ale Yeast , 6
 row malt with black patent instead of Roasted Barley. Remember
 there labels say 100% Malt.


      Miller is not trying to market these products to the home
 brewer or those that love Micro Brewed beers. Their philosophy is
 that American tastes are changing, and the Reserve products are
 filling a void between the full flavored, higher gravity, and
 generally hoppier Micros and the regular swill that is drunk for
 drunk sake.


      All Reserve products are brewed in New York, but operations
 will be moved to New Jersey when they close the NY facility.
 Recipe formulation is done in a pilot brewery in Milwaukee which
 produces 10 or 20 gallon batches.

NOW, on a different note. A shameless plug for the makers of....(drumroll)
 
  J E T    C A R B O Y      A N D     B O T T L E    W A S H E R.
 
They win my "Cool Dudes" award of the week. My first washer, after much use
and abuse gave it's life in the line of duty. As stated in the lifetime 
warranty on the product:  If FOR ANY REASON...send it in, replace, pay shipg.
 
Well,  with ABSOLUTELY NO HASSLE they sent a replacement, cash for my shipping
an apology, and a NEW lifetime warranty, plus a promise to research the defect
 
 The poor thing was basically just rough handled enough that the metal valve
 thingy that sticks out gave way. You know, when you bend metal back and 
 forth, and back and forth, it breaks after a while.  But, no hassle.
 Prompt, complete attention. This is one satisfied customer.
 (Makes me even happier that I just found one at a thrift store for $.50!)
 
 I can't say I have no connection. I bought a couple of these things.
 I like them, I like the company, I'll recommend their product. 
 I even got money from them.  For my shipping, not for saying this.
 
 So, if you've thought about it?  Do it. It's a good toy for brewers.
 I'm not involved with the company, and do not share any profits with them
 other than profitting by an extremely useful, environmentally sound (water
 saving) product made by a company with excellent customer service.


Sorry for the commercial interlude. I just like to pass on GOOD news in the
marketing world when I come across it. SO: Do feel free to return your
bottle washers if they ever go bad on you. It's worth it.


PS: FWIW:  I've noticed that Williams carries a snap-on fitting for sinks for 
these puppies. Nothing against Williams (I like them and order grain often)-
BUT I found the same snap-type fitting at a hardware store for about half the
price.  Unfortunately for me...I have a dishwasher snap attachment which is not
compatible, so I'm stuck screwing anyway.  Too bad for me.

Subject: Aerating wort


I'm still a little (alright, a lot) confused on the issue of aerating the wort
 prior to fermentaion.  In the premier issue of "Fine Cooking" (Feb/March
 '94), David Ruggiero has an article in which he goes through the homebrewing
 process.  After explaining that the wort lacks oxygen necessary for the yeast
 to do its thing, he says "The surest way to introduce a sufficient amount of
 oxygen is to splash the wort around as you pour it into the fermenter."


 Would too much aeration produce nasty oxidation crud?  Does just transferring
 the wort to the fermenter aerate it enough (without having to splash it
 around)?


 Thanks in advance for help on this

Subject: chimay contracted out?


Hello all, 
I haven't written for a while, but despite this being not directly
brewing related (except for culturers?) I thought I'd run this by you.
I read on rec.food.drink.beer (the new one) about Chimay:
Chimay has been taken over by Interbrew (the brewers of Stella Artois) late
last year. There has been a noticeable increase in the amount of Chimay
available since then (especially USA ?). Therefore IMHO not all Chimay is
being brewed at the monastry. This was confirmed by a Belgian brewery contact
I have. Also same applies at Maredsous.

 ..
Anyone else heard this? Does this imply that the yeast may change,
(or even, heaven forbid, the brew?).
If it was april 1st I'd have a good laugh, but this is worrying.
Just a Britain is waking up and realising big brewers=poor beer, 
Belgium is begining to be raped.
:-(
Rob. Thomas.
