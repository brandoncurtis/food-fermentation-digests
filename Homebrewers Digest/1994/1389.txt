Subject: Wort cooler follow-up


I did not claim my system of cooling wort was unique; just the best I've
tried with simple equipment. The cooled wort is sanitary "enough" because
I don't get spoiled batches, whereas using the wort cooler in the more
usual way I did. Under- or over-cooling the wort is most unlikely since it
is easy to gauge the temperature of the siphon tube as the wort drains out
and stop it off and make adjustments, if necessary. Thus the hypothetical
re-siphoning one respondent objected to is not necessary. The cold break
takes place in the secondary and settles out before pouring the cooled and
aerated wort into the primary fermentation vat.

Subject: Finings at bottling stage?


I've been adding gelatin finings to the secondary with good success.  Due 
to a slightly inferior extraction rate, my current batch of ale ended up 
somewhat short of 5 imperial gallons. I'm not doing a secondary 
fermentation on this batch for two reasons: First, since I use 5 imperial 
gallon carboys, I'd have to top up with about half a gallon of water in 
racking to a secondary, thus lowering my SG. Secondly, the recipe calls for 
a one-stage fermentation. It seems that if I add finings to the primary, 
I'll just stir up the sediment. 


My question is this: has anyone tried adding gelatin finings at the 
bottling stage? I rack from the primary to a carboy in mixing in the 
priming sugar at the bottling stage so I could just add the gelatin then. 
Any ideas? Will the gelatin added at this stage affect negatively the 
conditioning of this batch?

Subject: All-grain, yield


 
 >I asked Kinney: `Can't you brew a better beer using all-grain?'
 The answer is basically, Yes. But.....
 
 Interesting comment that should not be lost in this rosy scenario of an 
 extract brew pub.
 
 I guess my question from a business point would be, "why bother?"  It ends up 
 being an eatery with a half hearted brewery and one might just as well buy 
 good craft beer as take all the pains to make mediocre beer.
 
 >Kinney suggested that when I make my next stout, I use extract and
 specialty grains because the strong flavor would more than cover any
 flavor benefits from the pale grain....
 
 Misery loves company?
 
 > I am quite tempted to try this, even though for me, extract is 6 times more 
 expensive than DWC grain.  I am curious as to just how good an extract beer I 
 can make.
 
 Aside from satisfying your curiosity, I find it hard to understand why one 
 would be so tempted, particularly in light of his admission that one can make 
 better beer using all grain.

 >Subject: Grain Bed Depth
 
 >I was going through some old recipes and I noticed an interesting trend in
 my extraction rates.  I used to use a 22qt easymasher type setup for my
 mash/lauter tun and using an established process I normally got somewhere
 in the range of 28-29 pts/lb/gal extraction.  I recently swithched to a
 33qt easymasher type setup and noticed my extraction rate drop to 24 on my
 last 2 batches.  My suspicion is that the lesser grain bed depth is the
 main culprit.  I would estimate that the depth dropped from 6"-7" to about
 4".
 
 >  Can anyone comment on this phenomenon?  What is the optimal grain bed
 depth?  Thanks for any discussion.
 
 Well, you say "easymasher type" so the real answer might be that all 
 "easymashers" are not equal.
 
 I have one (EASYMASHER tm) installed in a 6 qt kettle which I call my "pilot 
 plant".  I mash one lb malt with two qts of water and sparge to  produce one 
 gallon of wort and get the same yields as I get in the 33 qt kettle and a ten 
 gallon Volrath.   The grain depth varies between one and about 10 inches in 
 these tuns.
 
 I really do not believe that grain depth has any effect on the yield 
 whatsoever.  It may effect the efficiency of the filterbed but the EM doesn't 
 seem to be much affected by that either.
 
 I would suggest that you look elsewhere for the loss.  Keep in mind that it 
 is absolutely essential that you only change one variable at a time when 
 measuring yield and measure everything carefully.  Then do it twice for 
 redundancy before you even start to think about what is goin on.

Subject: Bottling from kegs


I have recently begun kegging my beer.  What a headache saver! 
Occasionally I'd like to give a bottle of homebrew to a friend and have
questions about bottling from a keg.


Should I turn up the pressure from the CO2 before bottling?  Is the loss of
CO2 from the beer significant if I cap the bottles immediately after
filling them?  What would be a good pressure to use (I keep my beer in the
keg at about 47 degrees Fahrenheit with a CO2 pressure of about 13 lbs. per
sq. inch).


I would appreciate advice from people with experience bottling from kegs.


Thanks in advance for any tips.

I had the same problem.  I ferment most of my beers in a seven gallon carboy
sitting inside a 5 ft^3 refrigerator which has a full width freezer at the
top.  My normal glass air locks were about an inch too high.  What I did was
make an air lock out of 10 mm glass tubing like this:

I had the tubing laying around since I make neon sculptures, but any sign
shop should have this size.  The 10 mm fits snuggly in a 3/8" drilled stopper.
I would think that the tubing could be bent fairly easily in a standard
propane torch flame, however I used a 5-point crossfire intended for neon
tubing.  Be sure to flame polish the tubing ends where they were cut.  The bulb
parts allow bubbles to burst and prevents the water from being blown out or
sucked into the carboy.


I would be willing to make a FEW of these for people that need them, no charge.
You furnish the stopper and shipping costs.

I disagree Dion, I think that 800 PSI on a 3000 PSI regulator
leaves quite a nice safety factor.


The only thing one has to do is change the CGA fitting on the
regulator to one that will mate with tho top of a CO2 tank (all
sizes are the same)

As for the it not working at such a low pressure, a regulator does
not stop dispensing as a tank is emptied, but will empty the tank
to atmospheric pressure.


I was looking for a deal  like that when I was setting up a kegging
system, but none were available.

Subject: Low alcohol brews


Several questions have come up recently about low-alcohol brews.  I've
been experimenting with the methods Jack Schmidling posted a few months
ago for non-alcohol brews.  I have a few answers and a few more
questions myself.


Jack's method, basically, is to brew a normal batch of beer, then heat
it to about the boiling temp of alcohol (145F) until the alcohol is
gone, and bottle.  I've found this method works fairly well, and is
low-tech enough for the average home brewer.  Here are a few points
worth adding/emphasizing:


1)  The alcohol boils off into the air you're breathing (over the
    kettle), so use adequate ventilation.
2)  You lose some water along with the alcohol, seemingly about the
    same volume of both, depending on how long you heat the beer.
    It's somewhat difficult to judge the volume lost, which is
    critical for priming before bottling (my first batch was over-
    carbonated).  You can calculate the volume of alcohol to boil off
    by estimating the alcohol content from the original and final
    gravity.  Add 2 or 3 times that much water back in before bottling
    to maintain the same volume (or just measure the final volume)
    before priming.
3)  I hold the beer at 145F for about 30 min, then heat to 160F and
    hold for another 10 min to sanitize.
4)  The beer takes on a mild "cooked" flavor from heating.  It also
    turns a bit darker.  Both the color change and the cooked flavor
    dimish substantially after a few weeks in the bottle.
5)  I stir the beer while heating it, but only gently, to minimize
    oxidation.
6)  Stronger flavors in the original beer (like hoppiness) are reduced
    by heating.  So, it's good to start with a strongly flavored beer.
    I haven't yet tried a hop-back during chilling, or steeping hops
    during heating, or adding essential hop oils to the bottling
    bucket, but all seem like reasonable ways to add back at least the
    hop flavors the heat drives off.  My latest N/A started from a
    dry-hopped Sierra Nevada Pale Ale clone, which retained much of the
    hop flavor and aroma after heating.
7)  Heating kills the yeast, so to condition the beer you need to add
    both priming sugar and yeast.  Use the same type you used for
    fermenting, or you risk overcarbonation from adding a more
    attenuative bottling yeast.  I start some leftover wort fermenting
    with a sample of beer from the fermenter a couple days before
    heating/bottling the N/A beer.  It's at high krauesen when it's
    time to bottle.  I mix in the fermenting wort, or just the yeast
    from the bottom of the starter bottle, along with priming sugar.
8)  It's difficult to judge how much alcohol is left in the kettle
    after heating.  I use my nose to judge when it seems most of the
    alcohol is gone.  The bottle conditioning adds a bit back in.  If I
    recall, Jack tested his for alcohol content, but I suppose my
    methods yield a beer with less than 1%.  This is NOT non-alcohol
    beer, but it is very light alcohol compared with the 4-5% of the
    starter beer.


Now for my questions:


1)  Does anyone know a quick method to test for alcohol, akin to the
    iodine-starch test, that I could use to tell when all the alcohol
    has been boiled off?
2)  Does anyone know how the mega-brewers create N/A beer?  To get some
    motivation for this project, I tasted every N/A beer I could find
    on the market.  They all taste about the same (light Pils style,
    even the German imports) but had no "cooked" flavor.  If I could
    either remove the alcohol without heating, or remove the cooked
    flavor after heating, I'd make a better brew by far.

Subject: Rubber flavor in yeast starter


Hi all,


I use Wyeast liquid yeast for all my brews, and always make up a starter
a day or two ahead of brew-day.  The starter is wort I've salvaged from
the bottom of the brew kettle after siphoning most of the chilled wort
into the primary.  I filter the hops out of these dregs, bottle it in
mason jars using a hot-water bath, and then use it later to start yeast.
To start the yeast, I pitch the Wyeast package contents into a jar with
the wort and attach an airlock.  Regardless of the strain of yeast, how
long the starter has been fermenting (1-7 days), what beer type went
into the starter, and whether I shelter the starter from light or not,
it always has a fairly strong rubber taste.  Yet, my beer never has a
rubber taste.  I don't really use rubber anywhere in the process, except
the stopper in the bottle, which the starter never touches.  So, I don't
suppose it's actually rubber causing the taste.  The taste doesn't cause
any real problem - I just pour the starter off the yeast sediment and
pitch only the sediment.  But, I figure someday I'll create a
contaminated starter and miss the off flavor because the rubber taste is
so strong.  Any ideas?


Thanks in advance.  Phil_Bardsley`at`unc.edu

Subject: Fruit Beers


With all the talk about fruit in beers in HBD #1388 I feel I should interject
into this conversation as a Vintner not as a Brewer (I do both quite well).
As a vintner the use of Campden Tablets is to prevent the wild yeast from
starting the fermentation. 1 crusched campden per gallon of wine (anywhere 
from 5 lbs to 15 lbs of fruit) 24 hours before yeast pitching. For a brewer 
this is not practical as the Wort may start it's spoilage and produce very 
high levels of diaceytl. Best results would be to pitch the fruit into your 
at high krausen. This gives you the best chance that wild yeasts will not get
a foot hold. Once fermented the wild yeasts will not effect the flavor of the 
beer. 


One thing to remember with some fruits & berries (especially Raspberries) 
is that they contain alot of acid. This acid will disapate in time (a few 
years), so don't over do the high acid fruits and berries. There is a way to 
the acid content in the wine by using potassium bicarbonate (NOT SODIUM
BICARBONATE, baking soda).


For my next fruit beer I intend on making a must (same as a wort but must is 
a wine term) very heavy with raspberries (about 20 lbs) in 1.5 gallons of 
water. Adding potassium bicarb. to reduce the acid to a tolerable level. Once
compete, I'll add this to a 3.5 gallon beer (brewed with a slightly higher
than normal gravity to compensate for the addition of the must). I'll keep you
guys posted as to the results from this. Sometime this fall.

99 carboys of beer on the floor, 99 carboys of beer. If one of these carboys
should happen to keg, then 98 carboys of beer on the floor.

 That translates into wildly variable extraction efficiencies.
 
 Is this just a rhetorical statement to be taken with a large dose of salt?
 
 If not, I would be interested in what you consider "wildly variable"  and 
 just what it is they do to caues this and why I never see this in my "town".
 
 Re:  Jeff Frane's view on the REAL diety.
 
 As a born-again Athiest and sometime Agnostic, I can't help but take note of 
 Jeff's allegation that God is in reality.... Irish Moss.
 
 Never wanting to be accused of being narrow minded, I think I might just 
 check out this one.   I have never worshiped said god and proclaimed I never 
 would, but elevating Irish Moss to godhood is more than I can resist.
 
 Irish Moss, ora pro nobis.   
 
 Amen
