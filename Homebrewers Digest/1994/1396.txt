Just my $0.02 worth.


I've just started collecting foreign beers (up to about 50 and going strong)
and on _all_ beers sold in Australia it is mandatory to state the alcohol
levels as % Ac/Vol. Part of our countries laws regarding the publics right to
make informed choices of what their drinking. Imported beers must either have
a label different from those in the US, or have a seperate label attached to
the back of the bottle. Something for you collectors of beer bottles to think
about.


Anyway the results so far are:


Bud                   4.7%
Schlitz               4.6%
Miller Genuine Draft  4.5%


The Coors bottle I've got somehow missed the Customs net.


BTW, these beers are on a par with any of the local swill.


Cheers

Subject: Original Budvar (Budweiser) labels


Was just cleaning up some bottles to put my latest brew in, and
instead of throwing away the labels I soaked off, I thought someone
out there who hasn't had the pleasure of seeing the Original Budweiser
beer, might like an original label to call their own.  It would make a
great conversation piece for that American Budweiser drinker.


I picked up this beer in Europe, and it is the original Budweiser,
which was served to the Czech King as early as 1531.  I have about 30
sets of front, back, and neck labels to send.  I have more but I
haven't soaked them off yet.  I don't quite know how to go about
giving them away, but I guess if you send me an email message with
your name, I'll send you a message back telling you your place in line
(1-30), and give you my address to send a SASE.  I'll put the labels
in your envelope and send them on their way back to you.  If I get
more than 30 requests, I could get off my duff, and clean up some
more, I think I may have another 30-40 out there in their plastic
returnable cases.  We'll see what the response is! Also some of my
friends have more bottles, and I have them earmarked to come to my
humble homebrewery eventually.


The Budweiser bottle is a bright green clear smooth glass bottle, the
labels mostly orange and white, with a gold border. .33L, ALC 5.0% vol


Looking forward to hearing back, well worth a couple stamps!

I've had similar experiences with Wyeast American Ale yeast.  It was slow to
start, but once it got going it fermented to completion rather quickly.
Seems to be quite efficient.  I wonder if bag shows full expansion before
the yeast is actually ready and fully activated.


Thanks for the reply about the Celis Bock.  Makes sense that it is an ale,
though it had the right color and base flavor for bock, sans the low
gravity.  Nice stuff no matter what you might call it.


I have been using Iodophor as a sanitizer for my last few batches.  The
claim is you don't have to rinse the carboy, bottles, etc.  I didn't, and
just bottled today so I don't have the results first hand.  But I am
wondering if others use Iodophor successfully, without rinsing.  If so, this
stuff is miraculous!


For brewing schools, you might try UC Davis.  They have classes for
homebrewers and microbrewers alike.

Subject: A New Hop Root Question


Hello Brewers,


I have a different type of question concerning hop rhizomes. I planted my 
hops last year and I will have to dig them up this year since I will be 
moving. While poking around the roots today I found a couple of runners 
comming off the main clump of roots. I understand that these runners are 
the rhizomes, and I what to know if I can dig these up and replant them to 
make new plants? Or are they too young, or do they need to have buds of 
some sort on them? The rhizomes right now are about 1/2 the thickness of a 
pencil but basicly look like the sticks I planted last year. 


Thanks

Subject: Yeasty Flavor, Water Help


Hi all...Couple of Questions, but background first...
I am a partial mash brewer, 12 batches, liquid yeast, immersion and counter
flow chillers, primaries only, 5 gal. batches fermented in glass carboy.
1. My two previous beers have had a slightly yeasty taste throughout the
batch (proper pouring taken into account).  They have been a pale ale and
a brown ale.  The pale has a chill haze problem - I do use Irish Moss, but
have yet to try reconstitution.  Questions: 1. What is the possible problem?
Wild yeasts? not too likely - no significant off flavors and good sanitation.
Excessive yeast/sediment transferred in racking?  Others...? 2. What
solutions are recommended by the HBD wisdom?  Use of a secondary?  Note that 
this problem did not show up in my Oatmeal Stout (excellent IMNSHO) nor in 
an alt.  Other previous beers had other problems, I'm finally getting down
to the nitty gritty.  TIA


2. I may be getting ahead of myself, but I got water data from City of Austin
and was wondering...1) anyone in the Austin area want this data (electronic
copy)? 2) Anyone willing to answer my questions such as: what the hell 
does one do with pH 10.1 water, total hardness 120 (better than the local 
lake with a hardness of 214).  I am, due to the current lack of lagering 
capacity, an ale brewer. I'm looking to find the tweak in the water which
may assist in a cleaner beer palate so I can truely appreciate every bit
of the nice maltiness, esters, and hop aroma in my ales.  Any assistance
would be greatly appreciated.  
ps. note the new Email address for those interested...

        I have recently read a few things about the importance of lowering the
ph of the sparge water to that of the mash.  Anyone out there have any specifics
on the effects of doing/not doing this?
        What does one normally use to lower the ph -- gypsum, lactic acid?  Any
formula to follow to use the correct amount?
        My tap water has a ph of about 8.5.

Subject: Re : Re : Raspberry Extract


I've had several questions concerning what raspberry extract
I used for my 5 gal. of stout, and how I used it, so here's the info:


  1.  I used the natural raspberry fruit flavoring (4 oz, catalog
      number NF-20) from Brewer's Resource (1-800-827-3983).


  2.  I added all 4 oz. at the end of the boil, just before dumping
      everything into the cold water in the fermenter.


  3.  The entire fermentation was in the primary (I haven't yet had
      any off flavors or any other reason to rack to a secondary).


In my own (perhaps biased) opinion, the resulting beer had a very noticeable
raspberry aroma and flavor.  I can't say whether this was by pure luck, or
because of how I used the extract.  If anyone out there uses this approach,
please let me know how it turned out for you.

 In my opinion, the high alcohol of the BW results in the fermentation 
 yeast being too weak to reliably be used as a bottling yeast, and this 
 is true for either strain used.  I suggest that you allow the primary 
 to go for 1-2 weeks, rack to a secondary and leave it until you are 
 confident it is done fermenting.  Then grow up fresh yeast, 50-100
 ml of wort, pour off the "still beer, add the yeast slurry and priming
 sugar/wort in the bottling bucket.  Phil Seitz has had excellent results
 using this technique for strong Belgian Ales.

I dont agree.  You do have to make sure that the beer ferments out, you
dont want to be bottling at 8P and adding sugar.  If you can attenuate the
beer to 4P, I would still use some sugar, and be extra careful with sanitation. 
The only bacteria that could be introduced at bottling time in a BW comes 
from the bottling and air, not the still beer.  
 
 One of the points that has been overlooked in this thread is autolysis.  For
 a keeping beer like this, it is even more important to remove the ferment 
 yeast using secondaries and maybe racking between corny kegs and force 
priming.  A 3 or 5 gallon corny would seem ideal, in ease and sanitation.
 
 Others argue that bottle conditioning is essential......

Subject: Way high SG in steam beer after ferment


I brewed Pappazian's 'The Sun Has Left Us On Time' steam beer a couple
weeks ago using M&F light malt extract and Wyeast California lager. After
a very vigorous 5 day ferment at room temperature I racked the beer and
put it in my basement (about 56F-60F). That was about ten days ago.
Yesterday I racked it again and checked the SG (prior to racking). It was
a whopping 1.042. I forgot to check the initial SG, but it should have
been around 1.048.


How can the SG be so high still? The beer is still bubbling away down in
my basement (slowly because of the temp). It tastes very sweet with a hint
of the rotten eggs I've seen in my lagers.

        I scrounged an old bench capper from a junk/antique store. Its made of
stamped steel and is probably 30+ years old, maybe more. Cost was $15. It will
probably last another 50 years with regular use. Doesn't do the jumbo 1.5l
champagne bottles, but I use them rarely anymore. Its faster than a grab the
neck kind and costs about the same. Screw it down to a small board for best
results. That's my recommendation for a bottle capper!

If you don't want to (for such reasons as "I like the beer I make",

potentially consider changing what I do as an experiment.  Whether you 
are all-grain or extract or partial mash or kegger or bottler or 
blow-off or no-blow-off, you have room to improve if you want to.


If you don't want to (for such reasons as "I like the beer I make", 
"I've won homebrewer of the year three times already-enough is enough", 
"I won't until I find more time [me]") that's fine.


Any comments on my outline are welcome.

Subject:      Starter Containers


  Just wanted to share a brewing idea with y'all....


I found a great container for making starters for Wyeast.  I used to use a beer
bottle with an airlock, but now I just sanitize a 2 L pop bottle and make the
starter in there.  Advantages include the fact that you can see the starter as
it gets going, you can "dent" the bottle at first and watch it get pressure as
it returns to original form, and to depressurize, just give a half twist to the
top (without really breaking sterility).


  Plus, you can make almost 2 liters of starter in the same container.


  Now, a question:  Has anyone used Eroica hops as a finishing hop or as
a dry hop addition?  Is it any good for this purpose?

Subject: Yeast Starter Problems


I have recently converted over to making yeast starters instead of my usual 
method of just dumping the packet(s) into the entire batch.  The logic 
behind it seemed to be good insurance.  My procedure has been to boil about 
a quart of water with DME and 1/4 tsp of yeast energizer for about 15 
minutes, then pour into a gallon jug containing about a quart of preboiled 
and chilled water.  The gravity of this mixture is about 1.035.  After 
chilling in an ice bath (pitching temp in approximately 15 minutes), I 
aerate by shaking for 5 minutes.  At that time, I sprinkle the yeast in 
(two packets of Red Star Ale Yeast on last attempt), agitate, affix stopper 
and air lock.  Signs of activity are almost immediate.  My problem is that, 
even after two to three days, the starter looks like golden brown mud.  
Nothing falls out of solution.  I looked in Miller's book, which states 
that stable haze is nonflocculating microorganisms caused by wild yeast or 
bacteria.  If this is true, then I am amazed that anything could live 
through the sanitation I put my equipment through when I'm working with 
yeast.  I have had the same results three times in a row, all with 
different yeast.  The starter does not have any off odors, rings at the 
neck, ropes, etc.., but it does have a muddy flavor to it.  Should I pitch 
this muck and just fine the crap out of it?  I really think that I am doing 
something fundamentally wrong -- Please let me know what it is before I 
lose my mind.  If anyone has any suggestions for a tried and true, 
never-fail method, please share them with me by private e-mail.

I have been extract brewing for approximately 6 months now and I find it very 
expensive to do so. Can you experienced all-grainers out there give me a cost 
differential on all-grain vs extract for a basic English-type amber ale? I 
have been comtemplating investing in the equipment for all-grain brewing and 
if I could have a cost justification I might be able to sell it to my wife. 
Just for doing a pale ale utilizing 2 cans of unhopped light extract can run 
me as high as $28-$30. Granted the brew comes out excellent, based on my 
limited extract standards, but that is a bit pricey. I look forward to some 
cost analyses by you all-grainers out there. I'm sure such a justification 
came into your decision to go to all-grain as well. Thanks in advance...

Subject: Titanium Boiling Pot?!?


In response to Gordon Saby's post about getting an ASTM B265, G2 Titanium
boiling pot made for him by a friend, I offer this general information, lest
his post starts a clamor for titanium brewing equipment. The same cleaning
agents that work for stainless, may or may not work for stainless, but you
won't hurt it by trying them. Titanium is very corrosion resistant,
However...read on...


ASTM B265, Unalloyed Titanium, Grade 2
(ref. Metals Handbook Ninth Ed. Vol. 3)
Typical Usage:  Aerospace airframe and engine components such as 
engine shrouds, casings and airframe hot gas ducting; corrosion resistant 
sparger (sic) tubes for the chemical process industry.


Weldability is good. Corrosion resistance to various salts and acids is 
rated as a couple of thousandths of an inch per Year, and Nil (sic) in most 
cases. 
Thermal Conductivity = 9.5 BTU/ft hr F versus 9.4 for Stainless
Cost for Ti about $8.00/lb versus $2.90/lb for Stainless


Heating of titanium in air at high temperature results not only in 
oxidation but also in solid solution  hardening of the surface as a result of 
inward diffusion of oxygen. A surface -hardened zone of alpha-case (or air 
contamination layer) is formed. Normally, this layer is removed by 
machining, chemical milling or other mechanical means prior to placing 
part in service, because the presence of alpha-case reduces fatigue strength 
and ductility.


Hydrogen Embrittlement of titanium can occur in hydrogenerating 
solutions at room temperature and during exposure to reducing 
atmospheres at elevated temperatures. Elevated temperature atmospheric 
exposure also results in surface contamination by oxygen and nitrogen 
(oxygen preferentially), which can be extended subsurface to greater 
depths with increasing time or temperature. Violent oxidation reactions 
can  occur between titanium and red fuming nitric acid.


"What does this mean to a Homebrewer?" I hear you exclaim vehemently.
Well, in terms of wort interaction, titanium is the next best thing to gold or 
platinum, and better than stainless steel. 
But, notice above where I cited the section on Heating and Hydrogen 
Embrittlement. Titanium has a great affinity for oxygen and hydrogen. 
Oxygen acts as an alloying agent, strengthening and stiffening it. 
Unfortunately, it quickly gets to be too much of a good thing. Hydrogen 
goes a step further, in that there is no beneficial amount, and only 
embrittlement results.
Why do I bring this up?  Because many brewers use gas stoves or propane 
cookers to fire their boils. There are three types of combustion here: 
oxygenating, complete-combustion, or reducing.  Assuming your stove or 
cooker is experiencing complete combustion, the pot would still be 
experiencing high temperature oxidation from the surrounding 
atmosphere at some point of its bottom surface. With either a oxygenating 
or reducing combustion, the pot is being exposed to either more oxygen or 
hydrogen. Of the three, the hydrogen would be the worst, resulting in 
cracking in a relatively short period of time.
I suggest getting a piece of aluminum sheet to sit the pot on while heating, 
that should increase the usable life. 
Personal Comment:  You lucky dog!  On the other hand, given the 
anticipated atmospheric reactions, for the rest of you brewers, I wouldn't 
get too excited about it.

Fellow seaweed users,


I tried to rehydrate my Irish Moss (Brewer's resource brand) by adding about
1/2 cup hot water to it (2 tsp. IM) the night before I brewed.  By the next
day, it had gelatinized in the jar.  I scraped it out and added it to my
boil, and it mostly stayed in large clumps.  I get the feeling that this
wasn't what was supposed to happen.  I've used IM before (my first brew),
but really didn't notice what it did.


My questions: What gives?


Easy-answer (tm) system:


a)      Hey Jack, RDWHAHB, it worked fine.
b)      Too little water.
c)      Don't use hot water.
d)      Don't rehydrate.
e)      Break up the clumps before you put it in the wort.

For 5 gallons, start with a total of 25 lbs of malt.  I'd go for
something like this:


80% pale ale malt (20lbs)
10% Munich or other light roasted malt (2.5lbs)
4% Aromatic malt (from DeWolf Cosyns) (1 lb)
4% Special B malt (ditto) (1 lb)
2% Crystal (40-50L English, e.g.) (.5 lb)


This should give a nice, complex malt base to the beer.


Mash it with about 10 gallons of water, and drain the tun dry with NO
additional sparge water.  This should give you 6-7 gallons at around
1.090 (my mileage, anyway).  For a long boil, go for the higher amount
of water; your sparge gravity will be a little lower, but you'll boil
off more water for a slightly higher OG (1.110-1.120).  (You can
sparge the remaining grains to get wort for another 5 gallons of a
light beer, probably around 1.035-040, if you've got the boiling
capacity.)


Then you'll want lots of bittering hops, somewhere around 25-30HBUs.
Keep in mind that the bittering will mellow, and that you want lots of
hops to (1) balance the sugar and (2) enhance the keeping qualities.


You might throw in some finishing hops, but I doubt they'd survive 20
years very well.  If you do, a couple of ounces might give it a chance
of surviving.


3 hours should be the longest you'd boil, because at that point, the
hot break starts to break back down into soluble protein.


Be careful about HSA.  With all that malt, and the long aging, any
oxidation effects will be painfully obvious.


Build up a BIG starter (1 gallons is optimal) of a yeast that will
ferment at low temperatures (I've had good luck with Wyeast Scottish).
The starter gravity should be higher than normal, at least in the
final stage.  You'll probably want to do it in two stages, first 1
pint, then 1 gallon.  Let the 1 gallon starter ferment all the way
out, so there's a nice thick yeast slurry on the bottom.


Aerate the wort very well.  Just shaking it in the carboy will not
do the trick.  I use an in-line aerator made from a piece of copper
tubing with little holes drilled in the side near the top.  The siphon
hose attaches to it, and I stick it into the carboy as I'm siphoning.
You could also use the aquarium pump trick.


Pour most of the liquid off the top of the yeast slurry, swirl the
starter jug well to mix it up, and pour it into the carboy.  
Alternatively, you could make the starter directly in the carboy, and
pour off the "beer" (or make a batch of regular beer first) before
running the wort into the carboy.


A 6-gallon carboy is probably a good idea, it will give room for the
large krauesen that is sure to develop.


Ferment COOL.  A warm fermentation will produce undesirable levels of
fusel alcohols that impart a harsh, solventlike flavor to the young
barleywine.  Although, with aging, they will oxidize into esters that
may add to the flavor; I'm not sure.  I've been trying to run my heavy
beers around 50F, almost as if they were lagers.


Be prepared for a long fermentation.  Rack to secondary when the
fermentation is basically finished, to get it off the yeast (don't
want autolysis), but then leave it in secondary for a couple of months
longer to make sure it's done, and to let the flavors "combine" and
mellow a bit.


At bottling time, pitch fresh yeast along with your priming sugar.
Otherwise, you probably won't get any carbonation from your tired
yeast.


I would bottle with the oxygen-scavenging caps (SmartCaps?).  The long
aging period will allow any oxidation that's going to happen to
happen.  You want to minimize it, so anything you can do to help
reduce it is good.

Howdy from Zion!


Here in Utah, (correct pronunciation is Utarrrr) we measure piety in
inverse relation to the alcohol content of our beverages.  We have
therefore had a long tradition of permitting only 'safe' major label
beers in our supermarkets.  Safe has been defined as 3.2% ABV.


My questions are:
Do all of the majors brew multiple strength beers?  Do evil, sinner saturated
states like Nevada and Californicate get all the strong beer while the
pure of spirit people of Utarrrr and the Bible Belt get the 3.2?  Do
the majors devote some of their breweries exclusively to lighter beer?
Do they brew it different or just utilize questionable practices like 
'Ice Brewing' to kick up the alcohol for the bad people?


P.S.
To whoever posted the recipe for the "Jamaican Blue Mead" last year:
Wow!  Good stuff so far BUT 2 questions:
Why did you keep the alcohol level down (only 8 gallons honey)?
Did all of the color from your blueberries drop out?  Mine came out looking
like a white wine.

Subject: Explosive ferments


In Homebrew Digest #1394, Doug Lukasik asks whether his switch to partial
mashes or the use of yeast starters is the cause of his explosive ferments.
I'd have to say that it must be the yeast starters.  With well oxygenated
wort, the large initial colony can really crank out the CO2.  Without a
starter, the yeast is consuming some of the sugars while it is building
up its population and thus peaks at a lower rate of fermentation.


I've been reading an old textbook on nuclear safeguards that I picked up
at my local 24 hour self service 15 cent book store.  At the end of 
the book are case histories of nuclear accidents.  There seem to 
be parallels between these early reactor accidents and homebrew mishaps :


Hyperactive primaries <=> supercritical fuel assemblies
Wort contamination <=> Iodine contamination
Kettle boilovers <=> reactor coolant boilovers
Gushing bottles <=> supposibly subcritical cleanup solutions going critical
The smell of burned wort on the heating elements that means "My housemates
        are gonna kill me" <=> The blue flash that means "I'm gonna die
        of radiation poisoning within the next two weeks."


Yes, as you can see, nuclear science and brewing have a lot in common.  Except
brewing is a lot cheaper.  And the supplies are easy to find.  And no-one
has yet died by adding too much yeast to their reactor . . . er, um . . 
primary.  OK, ok, maybe there isn't THAT much in common after all.

I recently made a small batch (2 gallons) of coffee stout by adding a
quart of strong French Roast coffee to the brewpot after the boil.  The
coffee was made in a drip maker, so it was filtered through a paper
filter, but I didn't filter it again afterward. 


The beer turned out great.  The initial sip tastes like a good dry
stout, but the finish is intensely coffeeish, and lingers for a *long*
time.  In fact, this is the most intensely flavored beer I've ever
tasted.  It takes a long time to drink a bottle of this stuff --
definitely a sipping beer.


The stout has been in bottles for about 6 weeks now, and I haven't
noticed any of the stale taste Eric mentions.  Also, the head retention
is good, which leads me to believe that not a lot of coffee oils made it
into the finished beer.  Still, filtering the coffee a couple times
before adding it to the brewpot is probably a good idea.


If anybody else wants to try this, I would suggest using a slightly
lower coffee/wort ratio than I did, unless you really love coffee. 
Also, go pretty light on the bittering hops, because the coffee will add
quite a bit of bitterness to the brew.

Greetings Brewers,


I don't really have a noteworthy opinion on whether or Zima is beer or not,

                     And since Zima tastes like Sprite...


                     Could one make a fairly potent version of Shandy by
                     mixing equal parts of Zima and Ale (or Stout)?
