Subject: Reciculating wort and RIMS


As some of you might have guessed the comment to Miller in the latest
Brewing Techniques about recirculationg wort was from Micah. I haven't even
read the article yet, but Micah's point on recirculation is that the lipid
stripping can cause stability problems in your finsihed beer. This was also
one of the points in the article we coauthored in Zymurgy. These problems
may only show up if you ship your beer or it is stressed in some form, like
when you ship it to a competition. If you want to test your beers for
stability, try taking several bottled beers and elevate their temp up to
about 90-100 deg f for several days. The longer they stay clear and taste
good the better. Haze forming can be from bacterial problems as well. Micah
told me recently that he routinely takes sample bottles from the breweries
bottling line and stress tests them. He has had his beers tested at Coors
and got really good marks. I wish he were still around to give more details
on these tests. The RIMS issue never occured to me until I read it here. I
would say that RIMS made beers would be less stable than none RIMS made
beers. I'll leave the proof/disproof as an execise for the student. Just one
more reason I'm an anti-rims zealot.

Subject: Survey research on small brewers.


Dear Homebrew Digest and Beer-L List Members,


I want to thank those of you who were kind enough to point me in
the right direction regarding published sources for brewing
industry data.  Your help has made the research for my paper
much easier than it would have been otherwise.


I hope that you will not mind too much if I ask you for a few
minutes of your time, and information which you possess.


I would like to gather data on small brewers, micro-brewers,
brew pubs, etc.  How you identify yourself doesn't matter. But I
would like to gather data which will let me compare this segment
of brewers to the large brewers.


I can guarantee that I will keep all responses confidential. I
will be the only one to see individual responses.  Any data will
be used in the aggregate, or to develop statistics (e.g.,
average capacity, productivity ratios, etc.).  If an
individual's response could identify them (e.g., as the only
person in a class), then I'll combine their data into another
category.


The information I'm looking for is similar to that which I've
gathered from the Brewers Almanac. If the list members want, I
could send the statistics (averages, etc.) on the HBD for you to
see.  But if anyone would object to even this type of
presentation, I won't put it on the list.


I would like to be able to develop trends over time (e.g.,
annual increases in brewing capacity), but that information may
not be readily available for everyone.  I'd like to see as much
or as little information as you'd care to send me.


If you like, you can respond to the following questions on this
e-mail, and just send it right back to me. If not, sorry to have
bothered you.


If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me
directly.

Subject: Smoky Mountain Stout


Just a report on a sample of bottled stout from the Smoky Mountain Brewery
in Waynesville, NC.  Our homebrew club (TrUB) had a stout night and had
commercial samples of stout including Old 38, Dragon Stout, and Young's
Oatmeal Stout.  As I was leaving the store I saw Smoky Mountain Ale-"A
stout" brewed in NC so I thought I would give it a try.  We tried this last
so we could compare it to the better known commercial stouts.  Well it has
been awhile since I opened a bottle and had it shoot up in my face.  Yes,
it was a gusher and so was the other bottle.  To be fair maybe it was just
this lot; however, it was a poor beer with off flavors, little body and
worse than many homebrews I have had.  I was disappointed as I was hoping
more good brews would be brewed in NC.  Anyone else sampled beers from that
brewery or have any info. on it?

Subject: Iodine, Yeasty Flavor, Sparge pH, Fruit Extracts


From:  Bruce DeBolt, Brew Bayou Club, Lake Jackson, TX






To address some messages in recent days:






1.  Iodine






After having some sanitation problems I switched from bleach 


and rinse to iodophor (BTF brand) and no rinse.  I've made 


10 batches without any problems.  Dosage is 1 Tb per 5 


gallon or 1/2 tsp per gallon.  Let sit at least two minutes 


(minimum time).  Of course your container should be clean first.  


Iodophors must be acidic to work, typical products are 


formulated with acid to a pH range of 3.5-5.5.  This allows them to 


work in somewhat basic water (my tap water is pH 8.5), just make sure 


there is a yellow to amber color.  Shelf life stability of the concentrate 


is very long, but I don't have an exact number.   To conserve 


iodophor treat your carboy first, then use that solution for 


everything else.  It is much more cost effective to buy the 


big bottles of BTF (1 liter) than the smaller ones.  






2.  Yeasty Flavor






When I switched from dry yeast to liquid yeast the residual 


yeasty flavors in my beers, especially pale ales, 


disappeared.  I have always made a starter with liquid yeast - 2 Tb 


extract in 2 cups water, plus 2 hop pellets.  Boil, cool, pitch.  


Pitch in fermenter within 12-24 hours.   To date I've used Wyeast 


American, European (Alt), and English ale. 






3.    Sparge pH






Miller recommends lactic, phosphoric, and/or gypsum for 


adjusting sparge water to 5.7 in his book.  An award winning 


brewer at the local homebrew supply says just get it below 


6.0.   My brew water is essentially free of ions and neutral 


(pH 7.0) - I use 1 tsp gypsum (to get some mineral content) 


and 1/4 tsp lactic acid to hit pH 5.7-5.8. 






4.  Fruit Extracts






I've used cranberry and peach extract from St. Patrick's in 


Austin.  I split a 5 gallon pale ale batch in half and used 


2 oz. of each flavor.  The peach had a lot of aroma, and 


some flavor.  The cranberry was stronger in flavor, and 


somewhat tart - better overall than the peach for the base 


beer brewed.  One thing to keep in mind is extracts are pure 


flavor, there is no sugar.   To taste like "fruit" you want 


some residual sweetness.  For pale ales use a less 


attenuative yeast (such as Alt) and/or mash at higher 


temperatures.  Watch the hop additions.  My pale ale was too 


bitter for the peach flavor.  I'll be bottling a pale ale 


this week with peach, cranberry and pear extacts, will let 


you know how it goes.    See HopTech's catalog for more 


details on bittering and extract dosages (1-800-DRY-HOP).






5.  HOMEBREW COST - ALL GRAIN, BULK EXTRACT, CANNED EXTRACT






I originally wrote this article for our homebrew club 


newsletter.   You can adjust the economics to suit your 


local supplier or recipe, but it serves as a good general 


example.






The following is a comparison of making Generic Ale using four 


options based on a simple recipe.  For prices I used typical 


numbers from an area retailer.  There are discounts by going 


elsewhere and those will be mentioned at the end of the 


article.   I'll assume a 5 gallon batch yielding fifty two 


12 oz. bottles.   The simplest recipe is based on a hopped 


extract kit with added corn syrup.  The other options use 


only malt, either extract or all grain.  I've assumed that 


the extract kit is lightly hopped and kept the hop content 


moderate in the other options.   The ratio of grain to 


extract is based on a guideline of 7 gravity points per 


pound of liquid extract vs. 5 points per pound of grain.  In 


actual practice most brewers would probably add other things 


to their brew, such as specialty grains, but this example 


will be kept simple.






Basis prices


        Canned hopped extract, 3.3 lbs    $12.00


        Brewery grade corn syrup          $1.50/lb      


        Bulk liquid extract               $2.00/lb


        Bulk grain                        $1.00/lb


        Hops                              $1.25/oz.


        Priming sugar                     $0.50/batch 


        Dry yeast (liquid - add $1-3)     $2.00 






Options for making batch:






 - Kit #1 - Canned extract with yeast packet included.  2 lbs 


corn syrup added to increase gravity.  This beer would taste 


"lighter" than those below, so it wouldn't compare exactly.






 - Kit #2 - same as Kit #1 but two cans used to achieve 


higher gravity, better malt flavor, with no corn syrup.






 - "Bulk Extract" or "All Grain" according to the following 


Generic Ale recipe:






        Liquid extract          6.6 lbs (to equal amount in can extract)  


              


         or All Grain           9.2 lbs  (7/5 ratio vs. extract)


        Hops                    2 oz.  (1 oz. bitter and finish)


        Dry yeast               1 package


        Priming sugar           1 cup






THE BOTTOM LINE






                Kit #1    Kit #2        Bulk Extract    All Grain


Malt            12.00     24.00         13.20           9.20


Corn syrup        3.00    -              -              -


Hops              -       -             2.50            2.50


Yeast             -       -             2.00            2.00


Priming sugar     0.50    0.50          0.50            0.50






TOTAL             15.50  24.50          18.20           14.20


Price/bottle       0.30   0.47          0.35             0.27


Price/6 pack       1.80   2.82          2.10             1.64






As the table shows the main cost is malt, usually followed 


by hops, then yeast.  For higher gravity beers the malt or 


grain cost goes up and everything else stays about the same 


(sometimes extra hops).  Extract companies do the mashing 


for you so it costs more than grain.  As you move towards 


the right in the table (starting with Kit #2) costs go down 


and control over the final beer goes up.  The most obvious 


conclusion is that for cost reasons, if you like all malt beer 


you should buy bulk extract or go all grain, it is much cheaper 


than buying cans.  






HOW DO YOU LOWER THE COST?






For an all malt brew the cheapest way to is to go all grain.  






Liquid yeast can be re-used if you are careful about 


sanitation.  Some people really lower the yeast cost by re-


using several times, or by culturing multiple slants from 


the original package.   I've been re-using it once per 


package with no problems (12 batches), saving the rinsed 


dregs from the primary.  This brings the cost down to dry 


yeast, or less.






If you have cheaper ingredient prices this can significantly 


affect the economics.  For example (from a mail order 


catalog):






        Liquid Extract  $1.65/lb


        Dry Extract     $2.35/lb for 3 lb, $2.00 lb for 50 lb


        Grain           $0.55/lb for 50 lb bag


        Hops            $2.40 for 3 oz.,  $8.50 for 16 oz.


        Dry Yeast       $1.00


        Liquid Yeast    $3.50 






If you substitute the cheapest of these prices in the table above 


the Bulk Extract 6 pack drops to  $1.28 ($11.08 batch) and the All 


Grain 6 pack is only $0.98 ($8.48 batch).  If a home brewer 


can make a six pack for under $1.00, imagine how low the 


ingredient costs in a six pack must be for the big 


breweries!

Greetings...


Does anyone out there in HBD-land have an extract/specialty grain
recipe for Grant's Celtic Ale? I received a six-pack of this stuff
from "Beer Across America" in March and LOVED it. It is lower in
calories, lower in alcohol, light in body... but has a super
burnt (almost coffee-like) flavor. If you don't have a recipe,
does anyone have an idea on what kind of grain/malt gives this
kind of flavor?

Subject:  To Mash or Not to Mash?


I have a quick question about mashing.  Up 'til now I have been
just an extract brewer and have invested large amounts of money
into my kegging system.  Now there are external controls which are
keeping me from spending more money on this hobby of mine.


My brew kettle will safely boil 3 gallons of water.  Until I am
allowed to purchase a mash bin, could I:


Mash 2 gallons of water with all the grains.  Dump this into a
sparging bag in the primary fermenter, and sparge with water until
the level comes up to 3 gallons.  Bring this back to a boil and
finish brewing as with kits.  


I realize I won't get everything out of the grains, but it would
cost less than kits.   If this works, it would allow me and others
to try their hand at all grain brewing without investing more $$$.
  
Is this worth the effort?

This note is just to keep the flame going.  It was nice to see 
several recent all-grain brewer's fess up to the hidden cost in all 
grain (ex. propane cost, mashers, lauter tuns, etc.).  According to 
their data, I would have an initial up-front cost of between $180-
$270 to convert to all-grain (and before anybody jumps in about 
building the equipment yourself, remember tools, supplies and sweat 
cost money).  They also state that the cost for grain and fuel run 
them about $8-$9 for a 5 gallon batch (This is, of course, excluding 
the occassional person who get get their grain from their local 
microbrewery for a couple of bucks).  Considering that I can purchase 
enough decent quality malt (Northwestern, Yellow Dog, for example) for 
the same batch at about $10-$15 and that it only cost me about $.10 
per boil for electricity, this means that the cost differential is 
about $2-$7 per batch.  At the lower end, this means 90-130 batches 
to recoup the cost; at the upper end, 26-39.  Last year, I brewed 17 
batches.  This means that it would take me a minimum of 2 years to 
recoup the up front charges for my beer.  By the time I do recoup my 
losses, there's a good chance that I will have to start replacing 
some of this equipment.


Now, there is a good chance that people out there can do this a lot 
cheaper (remember, too, that I could make extract beer a little 
cheaper by using some cheaper adjuncts).  The point is, it seems to 
me that economics (especially when you consider the time) are not a 
good reason why to switch to all-grain.  Better beer, more control, 
more fun in your hobby, these are good reasons.  However, I have fun 
making extract beers and enjoy drinking them.  I have more fun 
tinkering with special ingredients (fruits, herbs, honey, etc.) and 
seeing there effect on the beer than I do with tinkering with protein 
rest times.  The point: to each there own, do it your own way.  
That's the whole point to homebrew; I don't have to drink what the 
mass producers make; I have the freedom to drink what I like. There, 
now back to the fun stuff.

Michael Ell writes that he bottled his ale early (1.028).  I agree that this
is early, but you have less to worry about than you might think.  If the
bottles are truly "similar to Grolsch" then I would venture to say you will
not have bottle bombs.  The Grolsch bottles are especially thick and the
rubber seal at the top will give up before the glass.  The other thing you
have working for you is that you can easily bleed off excess pressure from
these bottles with a quick open-shut.  You might cool them first to prevent
the beer from gushing out.  No worries, mate.

re: Cornelius keg CO2 dissatisfaction:
On getting CO2 into solution, I've had the same problem with too much foam. 
While my foam/beer ratio steadily decreases with the number of pours during 
a KegBout (tm), the amount of CO2 in solution is rarely satisfactory. My 
procedure is: siphon unprimed beer into keg, flush headpace with CO2, seal 
lid, pressurize to 24psi, shake vigorously, repressurize back to 24psi, then 
set out on back porch for about 1 week (temps are mid 40's to low 50's) 
during the week reshaking and repressurizing every other day.
on tapping day, depressurize keg and immediately repressurize to about 10psi 
and dispense. Beer tasted great, but no CO2 in suspension except for about 
15 seconds during the initial pour (looks like a pour from a Guinness pub 
draught). Yes I have a despised 'cobra head' tap. what gives? would putting 
a little priming sugar help the CO2 along?

Subject: Re: Extract vs. All Grain 




  Basically, I am replying to a message which claimed the need for a
mini-kitchen in the basement, and 8 hours of free time to brew an all
grain batch.  It just isn't so.


  I am an all grain brewer.  I changed from extract primarily to get
more control over the brewing process (particularly the ratio of
fermentable to unfermentable sugars) and save money.  My early all
grain batchs were of significantly lower quality than my late extract
batches. Experience changed this drastically.  With more control comes
more responsibility.


  After experimenting with multi-step mashes and pseudo-decoctions, I
settled on the single infusion process, 10 gallons at a time.  The
only equipment that I have now that was unneeded for my previous 5
gallon extract batches is: A powerful propane burner ($65 inc. propane
tank), a cutoff keg brewpot ($15 + 3x$2 sabre saw blades) and a 54
quart cooler with slotted copper manifold ($20 + $2).  I'm not saying
that I haven't bought/built extra toys, but this is what I _needed_ to
make the switch.  I brew in my backyard.


  Once I settled on this equipment and process, I also settled into a
brew schedule which takes about 4 hours from start to finish,
including cleanup.  Compared to 2x5 gallon extract batches, I'm coming
out ahead.  And, in that time is fair amount of free time.  The way
I'm set up, I need pay little or no attention to the mash or sparge.
The only part I watch really closely is the initial boil, to prevent
boilover. 


  Don't bet me wrong, I'm a _big_ advocate of enjoying whatever method
of brewing you choose, be it chew up the grain and spit it into a pot.
I just don't want people to be unneccesarily scared away from
alternate brewing methods.

Hello All,


It's so good to be back.  You really miss Cyberspace when your employer tells
you not to use it anymore.


Anyway, I bought A Yeast Labs Trappist Ale Yeast.  The stuff comes in a tube
with an expiration date that said August 1994.  Well, I pitched into a
starter (1 quart) and it's taken well over 2 days for any action to happen(I
shake the starter and see if any CO2 comes out of solution).  Before this the
starter was completely dead.  I assumed the stuff was dead and bought a
Wyeast Belgian Ale Yeast to replace it.  I'm thinking of pitching both.  My
question is:  what's the chance that the Yeast Labs stuff was dead and my
starter just kicked in with some infected fermentation?  I'd really like to
use the stuff if I could.  Liquid yeast isn't cheap.

Subject: Torrified Wheat


After returning recently from London and visiting with several brewers I
noticed that most of them add a small percentage of torrified wheat to their
mash.  The purpose of this is to improve head retention and after stopping
by the hand pumps on the way out I did discover that this and other aims
where mightily achived.  Thinking this practice was unique to English
brewers I was surprised to find microbrewers in Penns. and Maryland also
adding this to their grist.  Nostalgia sweeping over me I look through old
Zymurgy's and here again I find reference to this odd grain in the recipe's
for English ales.  Frustration and perplexity have overtaken me now
because for some reason you can't get this poor fellow from any homebrew
shops, or at least any I tried (about 20).  Well, they did say I could buy
a 55lb bag from them but then agian so did Crosby & Baker.  So, as this
narrative grows longer, my question is where can I get this stuff or why
doesn't anyone on a homebrewing level use it.  Or mayber a better question
would be how can I convince other brewers to call their local shops for it?
One clarifier:  for what ever reason there is a terminology chasm associiated
with this word "torrified" that leads many to direct me to cereal aisle
at the local grocery.  I don't want puffed wheat for breakfast and I certainly
don't want it in my beer.  Crosby & Baker's use of this word applies to a 
hard "pearled" grain.  So any help or discussion would be most helpful.

Subject: Homebrew Digest #1398 (Ap


As a great actor once said, "I'll be bock."  ... and so I am.


The results are in from the Zima/Shandy field test:


  I tried Zima with an old favorite, Guiness Extra Stout (hey, I'm planning
  on making my own stout next Christmas.  Don't let that get in the way of
  science!)  In the true spirit of the Scientific Method, I tried several
  solutions with the following ratios:


   ZIMA    GUINESS    COMMENTS
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   50.0%    50.0%     At first, effervescent, citrus, thin, too much Zima!
   25.0%    75.0%     Better. Still too much citrus aftertaste, tho.
   12.5%    87.5%     Not bad! Guiness Lite?? (kind of an oxymoron, huh?)
    0.0%   100.0%     Ahhh, there's the rub! Best yet; I think I should
                      patent this stuff!


  Other observations:  I was right about the strength (phwew!).  However, I
  guess I missed the mark on that point.  Apparently Shandy was derived to
  allow the youth of our cousins across the 'puddle' to partake of the wonders
  of finely made beer (a point that was graciously pointed out by one of our
  recently tansplanted readership).  If you do want to give it a try, just put
  in a generous splash. It tends to sweeten the stout a bit, make it a bit
  lighter, and the citrus quality adds a certain... character.


  I wonder if you could make a Black & Tan with this stuff??  Black & Clear?
  That concludes my unofficial field test.  Any ideas what I can do with the
  other 5 Zimas? (keep it clean, kids...)


  SPECIAL NOTE:  As I often see notices about new brew pubs and the like, I
  thought I might mention that a fairly new restaurant/brewery, J.D. Nicks
  (formerly Wolfgang's) is operating in O'Fallon Illinois (near St. Louis). On
  April 18, they are opening a homebrewer's supply store (in the back of the
  restaurant).  I have no affiliation; I just think it's great that us 'Boys
  from Illinois' no longer have to drive 45 minutes, one way, to get to a
  local supply store.  They also plan to start a homebrewers' club, and the
  masterbrewer had offered to sell Briess malts and starters from the yeasts
  at the micro-brewery!  I think this part of Illinois is finally starting to
  come 'round!

Peter Austin is a familiar manufacturer around here (MD).  Alan Pugsley
has setup Wild Goose in Cambridge, MD, and REd Feather, in Chambersburg,
Pa, and the Wharf Rat II in baltimore.  I agree that the Hop Percolator 
is a good thing, but its hardly revolutionary or even innnovative.  Its
basically a hop back.  And you're right, its better if they are closed.
A closed system will have water vapor in the head space so oxygen transfer
is minimized, hence less of the dreaded HSA (which IMO is over emphasized
as a problem for homebrewers, but is certainly a concern for a shipping 
micro).  There is no douubt that the use of a properly designed hop back
is great way to go for ale brewers or for any brewers using whole hops.
It is quite true that the vessal needs to be big enough to allow a 
reasonable flow rate of cast out wort.  What may be innovative or at 
least different from classic hop backs is that the wort is whirlpooled 
to remove trub and hop pellets prior to the Percolator stage. Classic
hop backs are usually designed to handle the entire hop load of a batch,
the kettle , flavor and finish hops are all run through the hop back.
I would imagine that the Percolator would result in better clairity of
cast out wort into the fermenters.


Open fermentation, its *the* way to make traditional ales.


Best,

The original poster might, in fact, find it valuable to read a little
bit about mash pH (maybe not Greg Noonan's book!), to get a few more
[informed] opinions.  Jack occasionally sticks his neck out, assuming
that whatever [presumably] works for Jack will work for all.
Apparently, Jack is under the impression that water is water, no matter
where you are.


It is true that measuring the pH of the mash is of more valuable than
measuring that of the tap water.  Jack may not have noticed, but the
contribution from grain can vary considerably, depending on the nature
of the grist and the method of mashing.


I've lost track of the original poster, so apologies for leaving out his
name.  But, whoever you are, you will probably get more value by the
correct use of gypsum, in your case.  If you contact your local water
department, they will send you a copy of your water analysis (assuming,
of course, you are in a municipal water system).  With this and a decent
brewing text (perhaps Miller's book is a good place to start), you
should be able to make some simple additions.  Come to think of it, the
simplest explanation I've seen was in Dave Line's Big Book of Brewing,
and he offered a handy chart for additions for various beerstyles as
well.


Although Jack will apparently disagree, control over your brewing water
is *enormously* important to an all-grain brewer, and one of the most
essential elements in successfully brewing to style.  You cannot brew a
pale ale with Munich water, anymore than you can brew a Dunkel with
Burton water.


Really, Jack.

        As the cheapskate who started the discussion, let me chime in 
     again. I don't keep great records, but while I was doing my taxes 
     last night, I let my "quicken" take out all the check stubs to 
     the brew-source shops for last year. This covered all my grain 
     and other supplies for 21 5-gallon batches, except for some 
     molasses, the water, a few weird spices I tried out of the 
     cupboard, and the natural gas in the stove. For 1993, cost per 
     5-gallon batch was $8.79. I think I'm lower than some other 
     postings mostly because I re-cycle liquid yeast as much as I can 
     (until I start to worry about it). (Did someone really say that 
     they use a brand-new Wyeast package for EVERY batch?)
        In equipment, I'm a cheapskate too and don't go in for the

     sort-of-rube-goldberg-schmidling-like mashertunboiler, using 
     parts scrounged from the basement. I've maybe spent a total of 
     $10 in $0.99 airlocks, stoppers, plastic hose, etc. in the last 
     year (that's mostly included in the $8.79 above). (I dont' know 
     how much I have in bottles--maybe $25-- but it's not quite an 
     expense, since I could take them all back and get a refund.) For 
     grainer-newbies, I say, you CAN spend big bucks for all-grain 
     brewing equipment (easy), but then we throw you out of the 
     cheapskate club and turn your name over to the Republican 
     National Committee.
        While I'm in the cheapskate mode, let me inquire.
        I like the idea of the mini-kegs but blanch at the expense 
     (and I'm not too crazy about the construction of the 
     things--especially whatever the lining is that can't stand 
     bleach). But, look, I've got all these heavy-walled 3 and 4-liter 
     wine bottles (Gallo, Carlo Rossi, and other cheapskate samples of 
     the vinter's art) lying around that I just have to take back to 
     the re-cycler.  They all seem to have the same screw-threads on 
     top, they're nice and green, they fit in my fridge, and they even 
     have a little carrying handle.
        Can't someone make a dispenser/CO2 thingy like the one that 
     sits atop the store-bought mini-keg, but which would fit a big 
     wine jug? WHAT A GREAT IDEA! I'll even lay aside my cheapskate 
     mantle and buy the first one that one of you entrepreneurs 
     manufactures (at a reasonable price, of course). Or maybe just an 
     adapter for the mini-keg model? Are you out there, Jack?
        Cheers,

Subject: doctored beer


I want to do a 'doctored beer ' program for my club. Basically, this is
lacing corporate beers with flavorings, spices, chemicals to mimic off
flavors and aromas.
I have some info but am wondering what else is out there. the main things are
what to use and how much.

Subject: Priming with brown sugar


A small, but meaningful, data point:


A beginner friend and I did a double batch of porter.  We did a
5 gallon boil, chilled, evenly divided into two carboys, diluted
with equal amounts of Bull Run water, pitched an evenly divided
2 liters of starter (Wyeast London Ale), fermented in the same room,
and gave each carboy an equal amount of affectionate petting during
fermentation.


At bottling time we primed one with 3/4 C of corn sugar, boiled in
a bit of water.  We primed the other with the same amount, by weight,
of brown sugar, boiled in an equal bit of water, for the same amount
of time.  I don't remember how much the sugar weighed, how much
water it was, how long it boiled, what the weather was like, or
whether my socks matched.


So far, (her beer is gone, mine is getting close) noone has been able
to detect any difference whatsoever between the batches.  Your
mileage may vary.

Subject: Carapils


I was reading Miller the other day and noted that he contends that Carapils
malt is added as a specialty grain primarily to aid in body through the
introduction of larger proteins into the wort.  He also recommends mashing
the grains with the main mash and mentions nothing about residual sweetness
associated with the grain.  He seemed to imply that the residual sweetness
of Carapils is a "myth" brought about by the common homebrewer's 
misunderstanding that dextrines contribute to body and mouthfeel, while it
is actually protein (i.e. since Carapils does add body and dextrines are what
add body to beer, then Carapils must contain dextrines.)  I have 
stimulated discussion in this forum a couple of times on this subject in an 
effort to better understand the effects of Carapils on the final product
but I still don't feel that the complete picture has been painted.  Would
anyone care to comment on Miller's assertions?  Have personal research or
observations corroborated them?
