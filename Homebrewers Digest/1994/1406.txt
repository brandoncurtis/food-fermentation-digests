Subject: Cask ales, pt 3


Dispense of Cask Ales:


When the cellarmaster has determined that a new cask is ready for dispense, the
beer line connecting the cask and the beer engine are connected.  A beer engine
is merely a fancy hand pump that "pulls" the beer out of the cask.  As beer is
removed from the cask, air bleeds in through the porous spile.  It is for this
reason that cask ales are best during the first few days of dispense, and are
known to become increasingly undrinkable after about day 3 or 4. Oxidized beer
in any country is not very pleasurable, and casks allowed to sit for too 
long exhibit a strong oxidation effect.  In an effort to combat some of the 
ill effects of oxidation, brewers and publicans have devised several methods 
of introducing CO2 into the cask.  The least objectionable is the blanket CO2
method whereby an extremely small amount (1-2 psi) of CO2 gas is pushed into 
the cask.  Since CO2 is heavier than air, it will form a "blanket" over the 
beer, protecting it somewhat from the oxygen.  Another method makes use of 
actual CO2 tanks to push the beer out and mechanical pumps are also in use to
help pull the beer from the cask.  Traditionalists despise all methods of CO2
use to help preserve the beer quality, arguing that all result in some form of
"gassy" ale.  The campaign for real ale (CAMRA), is particularly adamant about
only dispensing real ale by the use of a beer engine without blanket pressure.
To this end, they refuse to list pubs that employ CO2 systems in their
excellent book, CAMRAs Good Beer Guide , published annually. 
While CAMRAs dedication to tradition is admirable, it may be unrealistic to
expect the smallest pub in the furthest region to be able to adequately care
for cask ales in the same fashion that the busier pubs can.
 
If cask hopping is employed, a small strainer device is used to keep the 
hops in the cask, and out of ones glass. At the tip of the dispensing nozzel,
a sprinkler attachment is used to force the beer through several small holes,
resulting in a release of carbonation into the beer and glass.  This results in
a thick head and is similar in principal to the tap design used by Guinness.
Cask ales can also be dispensed directly from the cask using gravity. In this
arrangement, a cask is positioned so that the beer outlet is pointing down,
and merely by opening the spigot and allowing an air vent, the beer will pour 
out of the cask by gravity flow. If a soda keg is employed in this technique
the liquid dip tube would need to be removed or severely shortened. If the 
beer is to consumed in one evening, it is an excellent method of dispensing
quality beers.

I'll keep this short and sweet to save bandwidth, but I just wanted to
let the digest know that there are some really great people out there.


I posted about my troubles in locating yeast culturing agar locally in HBD
#1404, and since then I've gotten TWO offers from readers to send me agar;
they didn't even ask for anything in return.


I've been participating in Internet news for over 7 years now and have
read many newsgroups regularly during that time.  However, I've never seen
so many people go out of their way to help people out as I have in the six
months I've been reading rec.crafts.brewing and the HBD.  I think that this
is a fantastic resource and the reason is because of the people behind it.
I've learned more about homebrewing in the past six months than I probably 
ever would have without such a wealth of information.


Keep up the good work -- I really look forward to my morning HBD fix!

Subject: oven/temperature/worry


        Oven Mash--Phil Brushaber asked about mashing in the oven. My 
     one try was a failure because I could not get the mash 
     temperature right. The lowest my oven thermostat will go was 170, 
     which I thought would be too high, but after 8-9 hours overnight 
     in the oven at 170, the mash itself was barely 140, and I had no 
     idea how long the mash had been at what temperature. The next 
     morning I boosted the oven temp to 220, and eventually got the 
     mash up to 165. Overall, I wasn't too thrilled with the 
     process--I think you'd have to develop some type of formula to 
     determine what oven temperature you need to bring x-volume of 
     mash up to x-temp. If you heated the mash to mash temperature 
     first, the oven would probably be a good temperature-holder, but 
     if you do the heating outside the oven, why bother? As I recall, 
     the wort and the brew turned out okay--I called it "Oven Shovin' 
     Porter"--but I don't think I'll try the oven again. 
        Temperature--Ken B. (berkun`at`guiduk.enet.dec.com) said: "One 
     other problem is measuring temperature. I seems to vary 
     considerably depending on where you measure.  So I'm no where 
     close to figuring mash temperature accurately." 
        Here's a true anecdote that I'd like some response to: I have 
     an acquaintance, chemical engineer, who works for a testing lab 
     and was kindof interested in maybe trying homebrew, so I invited 
     him over to watch the process. I had mentioned to him my cheesy 
     thermometer (it's a candy/jelly spring-metal el-cheapo), so he 
     brought along a superdooper digital electronic thermometer from 
     the shop that measured temp like instantly, within plus or minus 
     1/10000 of a degree (or something like that). We are mashing, and 
     he's monitoring the temperature for me--and I am ASTOUNDED. In 
     the mash itself, the temperature varied by as much as 20 degrees 
     centigrade, depending on where you poked the probe-thingy. Stir 
     the mash and you just seem to move the hot spots around. I 
     thought I was mashing at 55 degrees, but I was really mashing 
     parts at 45 and some at 65. Wowsa!
        Is there a good technique for dealing with this radical 
     difference in mash temperatures? Stirring, of course, but my 
     impression was that if we stirred enough to even out temperature, 
     we'd be losing much of the heat we needed. How do you experts do 
     it?
        Water-Brass. Our local city water supply just announced that 
     they are going to begin treating city water with phosphate, as 
     part of an attempt to control lead leaching from pipes. I didn't 
     understand the chemistry of it at all, but I got worried about 
     what it'll do to my mash & wort. Is there a quick & easy answer, 
     or am I going to have to read up on all the water ph stuff 
     everyone has been writing about? Up to now, I've just had to get 
     rid of the chlorine to get excellent beer-making water. Don't 
     tell me I have to worry (and not have a homebrew).
     Cheers

Greetings!


I would really appreciate some strong opinions about my first question:  if
I'm going to dry-hop a PU-clone (ala Miller) using Saaz pellets (1 oz.), how
do I keep them from gunking-up my secondary?  Will they settle on their own?
Should I use a bag?  Also, how long will my primary take at 50F, typically?


Also, my wife and I will be travelling to Switzerland for a conference in
May.  I was thinking that it might be fun to see a brewery while we're
there.  Is this feasible?  We'll be flying into Zurich, and staying in
Davos.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!  My wife suggested that I
tap the impressive capabilities of the HBD for some help with this, can we
impress her?

Subject: Post Road Ale recipe and Yeast question


This is my first posting, even though I have been reading for about 4 months 
and have been brewing off and on for a couple of years and I have two 
questions for the homebrew experts out there:


1.  Does anyone have a recipe (extract and specialty malts) for Post Road Ale? 
 This is one of my favorite beers and try as I might I can not seem to 
duplicate it.


And,


2.  In his Beer Companion, Michael Jackson talks about a couple of different 
ales and how they are now being brewed with bottom-fermenting yeasts, he 
particularly calls out Pete's Wicked Ale as either using bottom fermenting 
yeasts now or in the near past.  But, he also mentions some other ales (can't 
remember off the top of my head) that use bottom-fermenting yeasts.  Pardon my 
stupidity, but I thought that the difference between an ale and a lager was 
that the former used top-fermenting and the latter bottom-fermenting yeasts.  
Is he implying that the designation ale/lager doesn't mean very much in the 
commercial beer brewing world or is there some deeper meaning that I am 
missing here.


TIA

Subject: lagering and aging question


I have been trying to figure out the quickest way to get a lager ready for
drinking.  I believe it would involve something like leaving it in primary
until it is almost fermented out, then bumping the temp up about 5F for
a few days for a rest, then racking to a secondary.  (Note that I'm not
talking about a steam beer.)  Now comes the lagering part.  What is "best", 
cold at 30F, or warmer?  I have heard that the big guys lager at warmer 
temperatures to speed up the process.  I have also read (If I am not 
mistaken) that 30F is supposed to be faster.  How about opinions as to 
what each approach does, or what is your favorite method?  I realize that
lagering faster does not necessarily produce a better beer.


e-mail or posting is fine.  I don't always get around to reading the HBD
immediately.

Subject: all-grain equipment & yeast samples


Just read a rather interesting post on the ease of building a cooler mashton.
Well.... after borrowing a freinds for awhile (which is what got me to try
all-grain initially... I made my own.  It's a cheap and relatively easy design
which I've never seen mentioned.  I've dubbed it the Suurballe-special after
its inventor.  It requires no plumbing or disassembly of the spiggot.


I found 34 and 48 quart Rubbermade coolers at my local Safeway at ridiculously
low prices.  After searching for months, I can now say with certainty... WAIT
UNTIL SPTING to buy your cooler.  They will be widely available and at a
reasonable price.  I got the 48-qt model.  The copper manifold is the hard
part.  You need to bend it and then cut the slots in the bottom.  I used
3/8" copper.  The manifold is simply jammed into the spiggot hole.  I attached
a plastic siphon hose to the outside with a small hose clamp. Standard plastic
siphon hose fits snugly over the spiggot hole.  The sparge flow rate
is controlled with a plastic pinch roller attached half way down the hose.
There's no leakage, altho I recomend re-tightening the hose clamp periodically.
The pinch rollers are available thru scientific equipment catalogs.   Total
cost... about $30.  Total effort.... about 8 hours.   Capacity is 32 lbs
grain with room for sparge water and I got better than 30 points on my
first batch... a porter based on G.W. 2-row.    I'm happy !


On another topic... my homebrew club recently collected and shipped
'yeast samples' from our members to a regional homebrew comp via UPS.
I received a call days later from the collection site informing me that
there were problems with my, and others entries... missing bottles, missing
entyry forms and checks.  Apparently, UPS damaged the box and simply
re-packed what was left without notifying either the sender or receiver
that the package had been damagged.  After chatting w/others in the Malts
who have experience running competitions, this appears to be standard
practice for UPS.   They have denied any knowledge of the incident.
I don't have an answere... I'm just expressing my frustration and
annoyance over this shoddy approach by what I'd thought was a reputable
shipper.

    Hi All,


       In HBD#1404, David Knight writes:

       I believe what you are tasting is the typical phenolic produced by
        this strain of yeast. Wyeast 2112 California Lager is a steam beer yeast,
    which produces a rounded, thick, slightly muddy phenolic (I have trouble
    describing it too) when fermented warm.


>5 lbs of pale malt and 2 lbs of rice, O.G. 1.040, F.G. 1.006
                                                        ^^^^^
>Primary ferment at 70 degrees


       I've brewed about three dozen batches with this yeast, at primary
    fermentation temps ranging from the low 50s to the low 60s. I
    noticed that the phenolic flavor was more pronounced in batches fermented
    at higher temperatures. With the batches done in the low 60s, the
    effect was quite pronounced, it tended to dominate the character of
    those beers, whose FG was ~1.015, and were fairly assertively hopped.
    Fermented at 70F in a beer with FG of 1.006, I'd imagine the effect is
    quite unpleasant indeed.
        If you were aiming for a beer with "little flavor", an American
    Light Lager, I suggest you selected the wrong strain of yeast, and then
    fermented it too warm.   Steam beers are generally fermented somewhat
    cooler than 70F, are amber colored, medium to full bodied, and are
    fairly hoppy.  All of this tends to balance the phenolic flavor, and
    produce a beer of marvelous complexity (can you tell I like steam beer?).
        If you want a light, clean lager, try Wyeast #2007, which I believe
    is called American Lager/St. LouIs pilsner, or some such.  You should
    also ferment this quite a bit cooler, 48F-50F or so.  If you don't have
    the facilities to do this, I'd suggest making an ale instead, using
    Wyeast 1056 American/Chico ale yeast.




>bottled with 4 ounces corn sugar
>*NO* carbonation.  There is a slight *pfft* sound when you open the cap,


        Sounds like the bottles were sealed OK, sounds like the beer was
    slightly underprimed to me.


        Hope this helps.
   
        Cheers,
          Jim

I have the same problem (I only have one fridge for brew and don't

I made a wooden holder -   STANDBY FOR ASCII GRAPHICS!:

This works great for me.  I wouldn't recommend trying to bend
the pickup tube, just orient the keg so the tube is at the
lowest point of the keg.  You can serve all but the last mug
of brew this way.

In HBD #1404, Lou King inquires about using a Cajun Cooker rated at 135,000
BTU indoors. This is potentially very dangerous. Devices like that don't
worry too much about the amount of carbon monoxide they produce since they
will be outdoors. According to existing safety Codes, indoor appliances with
no venting system are limited to much lower BTU rates. For example, a burner
on a residential cooking range is about 9,000 BTU.

Subject: Brewpots / Pay-Back


A couple of thoughts about ceramic on steel pots.  I don't
trust the handles so I don't use them (the handles).  I have 
a hose from from the kitchen faucet to the stove that I use
to fill the pot.  I sparge into the pot and siphon the boiled
and chilled wort directly from the pot to a waiting carboy
(which has yeast in it).  Almost no lifting.


I also use a c-o-s pot as my mash tun.  Once I have the grain
doughed-in and at temperature, I cover the pot and put it inside
the oven.  This is about as good an insulated box as anything
you could build.  Try it.  I would be surprised if you lose
more than 2 degrees F in 60 minutes.  Going all-grain will 
take more time but it need not require *much* more work.
Of course, a 10-gallon Vollrath or sawed-off Sankey might not
fit in *your* stove but my c-o-s fits in mine.  Oh yeah, it 
helps if you have a fairly stiff mash (1.33qts/lb) and pre-heat
the oven briefly before putting the pot inside..


Finally, brewing from extract or all-grain are both costly,
time-consuming ways of getting good beer.  But what's the
alternative?  Buy commercially made beer?  That will save you
a lot of time but the costs add up quickly.  To see how quickly,
I plugged the following numbers into a spreadsheet.  I used
what I consider to be average prices for equipment and ingredeints.
Obviously, you should be able to lower costs by shopping/scrounging
around.  The equipment is based on what I use and would recommend
to new brewers.  For instance, I don't consider a pot big enough to
hold a full wort boil and a wort chiller to be "optional" equipment.
YMMV.  But, even with this "elaborate" set-up, extract and all-
grain pay for themselves in about 9 months.  With my numbers, all-
grain has a slightly shorter pay-back period than extract but slightly
different prices could tip the scale to extract.  Again, YMMV.


Note:  this spreadsheet makes two MAJOR assumptions.     
    1.  Every batch of homebrew is drinkable (ie: no snailbait)
    2.  You count the time spent brewing as entertainment,
        not labor.


All prices are in U.S. dollars.

Subject: More info on Brass Parts


Hello Group,
In response to several questions I received regarding Brass parts, I decided to
get on the ball and make some calls. A couple firms have yet to get back to me,
 but what I have found out is pretty significant.


I called Elkhart Supply? Co? (anyway, a large ruminant cardio-organ) in
Chicago, and spoke to Engineering. They supply brass parts to many of the large
hardware chains such as HWI, Ace, and Home Depot. They identified their
threaded fittings as being made from ASTM B584, alloy C84400, which is one of
the Leaded Semi-Red Brasses I identified in HBD 1404. This alloy has a lead
content of 7%. Elkhart uses this alloy for all of its threaded piece parts.
Other parts which are not threaded, but intended for soldering, are made from
C12200, which is a lead-free copper. 


Elkhart buys their Valves which they distribute, from Nibco (NibCo?) also of
the Chicago area. Nibco makes a lot of valves including the gas and plumbing
quarter turn ballcock valves that many of us use. These are also made with ASTM
B584, alloy C84400. (7% Lead) (sigh)


But, Elkhart also told me that their parts and usage are indeed certified to
the Safe Drinking Water Act for Lead contamination/leaching. On the other hand,
that is with reference to water, not wort. But, we are talking about small
contact areas and times with any of these parts. The EPA conducts their tests
on water that has been standing in the presence of lead or lead-tin solders for
a matter of hours. Therefore I don't think the homebrewer is in much danger
from a small fitting. Any lead that could be leached out would be from the
surface, and not replenished by diffusion in the metal. The amount of lead
available at the surface for leaching is small, roughly one atom in five, based
on atomic percent. Hmmm, that still is not very reassuring. If someone has the
dissociation constant for this alloy in wort, of several representitive
gravities, using several representitive mineral buffered waters, then I could
calculate an atomic parts per million per hour for Lead release based on mass
of the part for each of the worts. Any takers? No??
 Well, I am not going to worry about it for occaisional contact. For those
people who are using RIMS systems, where wort would be in contact with several
brass parts for (several hours), then you may want to find stainless steel or
use lead free copper (non-threaded) fittings with Silver Solder (making sure it
is both lead and cadmium free).


>From this information, we have a better idea of the risk, but still not much to
gauge its significance.

Subject: cask ales, pt 4 (last)


Brewing Tips for Home Production of Cask Conditioned Ales:


The production of cask conditioned ales is not that different from the normal
production of homebrew.  In both cases, the beer is naturally carbonated in
a closed vessal.  The major difference is in the amount of carbonation that 
is developed, typical ales and lagers are conditioned to about 2.5 Volumes
of CO2, while cask ales are closer to 1.5 - 1.75 volumes.  When brewing cask 
ales, there are two methods to follow:


a. Let the fermentation complete, and add a small amount of fermentables in
the cask.


b. Carefully monitor the fermentation and when the gravity is within 1 degree
Plato of the terminal gravity, bung the cask. This method is preferred but
can be difficult due to the requirement that the brewer know fairly accurately
what the real terminal gravity will be.  This technique is simplified by 
using SS soda kegs for dispense, and carefully venting excess pressure as the
cask conditions.  The use of finings for the homebrewer can be an additional
effort that many may not want to bother with.  In this case, be sure to use
a yeast that is known to be an excellent flocculater. If cask hopping is done,
only fresh whole hops or whole hop plugs should be used.  Place the hops in a 
permeable bag, using a sanitized weight to force the bag to the bottom of the 
cask.  If you intend to serve the beer as true cask ale, a gravity feed can be
employed but ideally, the cask should be emptied in one night.


A Brief Description of Styles [4]:


Type                   Original Gravity    ABV          Unfermented Matter*  IBUs        
"Ordinary" Bitter- 1.031 - 1.045.      3-4.6        27-45%            20-40
Draught Mild       1.030 - 1.036       2.5-3.6      29-48%            14-37
Best Pale          1.040 - 1.050       4.3-6.6      21-43%            19-55
Brown Ale          1.030 - 1.040       2.5-3.6      43-55%            16-28
Strong Ales        1.066 - 1.078       6.1-8.4      32-44%            25-43


Historically, IPAs were of much higher OG, but my experience has found that 
today,
these are as low as 1.035 up to 1.045, and merely a hoppier version of Bitter.
Strong ales today are often found as "low" as 1.051 OG but frequently in the
1.062 range. Note that despite the relatively low alcohol by volume (ABV) of 
all but the strong ales, these
beers have a lot of unfermented matter that gives the cask ales abundant body
and mouthfeel.  Unfermented 
matter is primarily composed of dextrins, which normal yeast cannot metabolize,
and as such the dextrins will carry over into the finished beer intact.  The
use of caramel malts (or crystal malt as it is often called) will always 
increase the quantity of unfermentable matter in a beer and caramel malts are
routinely used in the production of cask ales.
Many brewers create a wort of OG 1.055 or higher and dilute this into the 
fermenter by adding boiled and cooled water to result in the 1.035 OG.
By using this technique, a degree of carmelization can be achieved from the 
kettle processing that may result in beneficial flavor attributes.


Glossary of terms:


Burton Unions - Classic fermentation technique that recirculates the yeast
overflow from the fermenter into a collection tank and back into the fermenter.


Isinglass - A fining agent made from the processed swim bladders of fish,
primarily the Sturgeon fish.  


Fining agents - Materials that help to clarify cask conditioned ales.  Includes
isinglass , geletin, and in the case of protein removal, Alginol (negatively 
charged polysaccharides). 


Residual extract - Not to be confused with terminal gravity.  Residual refers
to the amount of fermentables remaining at a certain time, these fermentables
will be metabolized by the yeast in suspension, given time to do so.  


Stillage - A wooden device used to prop up and hold the cask in position for
dispense.


Terminal gravity - the final gravity of the beer. It is measured after all of 
the fermentables are consumed. 


Top Fermented Beers - beers fermented using a top fermenting yeast strain, 
S. Cervesae.  Yeasts of this class tend to ferment the wort through action
near the top of the fermenter, and also tend to rise to the top at the
fermenter at the end of fermentation. 


Unfermentable Matter: primarily dextrins which normal brewers yeast cannot 
metabolize.  As a result, these body builders are carried over into the 
finished
beer and contribute sweetness, body and mouthfeel. It can roughly be calculated
by reading the terminal gravity.  A beer that has an OG of 1.040 and a FG of
1.010 has 10/40 unfermented matter, or 25%.  


Yorkshire Squares - Classic square fermenters, made of slate at the Samual 
Smith brewery.  Consists of a slate bowl device that is situated above the
fermenter allowing yeast overflow to collect for removal or if left, re-
introduction into the fermenter.

Yesterday morning I awoke and read this stunning confession from Jack:

Oh, Jack.  You mean this hasn't been about water after all?  All this 
because I've been rude, acted the cad and hurt your feelings?


(Drum roll.  All 6'8" of me on bended knee.)


Jack.  Pleeeeease forgive me.  Almost three years ago, in private email, 
I rashly said I didn't believe you had sold 100 maltmills.  (I don't 
remember the liar and the fraud part, "fraud" not being part of my 
lexicon but, hey!, if you said I said it, I must have said it.  Goodness 
knows I've been wrong about everything else.) 


What I do remember is that when you were thinking about joining the 
business end of the homebrewing hobby, you had asked me as a veteran 
homebrewing business-person about the vagaries of this peculiar business. 
Not wanting to dash the hopes of this anxious young wannabe, I remember 
saying it's been a long haul but that things were beginning to change.  
(Indeed, my and many other longstanding homebrewing businesses have more 
than tripled sales in the last two years.)  At that time you told me you 
thought the malt mills were going to cost well over a $100.  I recall 
saying you would have a difficult time selling a piece of equipment for 
more than a $100 in the homebrewing market.  Clearly you took the advice of 
this 10 year homebrewing business veteran, got the price down under a $100 
and have a thriving business to show for it. 


And I congratulate you on your success.  Really.  Your maltmill has been a 
valuable contribution to the homebrewing community as I'm sure hundreds of 
your customers can attest.  And in the spirit of the brotherhood, don't 
worry, I won't charge you a consulting fee. 


But I hope you won't mind me saying here in front of our friends that I am 
truly touched by this shocking admission of yours.  To think, after all 
these years, I thought you didn't care.  Do you realize how much time we've 
wasted? 


:-*  <Smack>  :-*


I love you, too, Jack.

In a side discussion, I was told that the dextrins in the crystal won't be
affected by the enzymatic activity of the mash.  I've never read this myself,
or if I have I don't remember it, but then I've never read anything
conclusive to contradict it, either.

Well, the process of making crystal malt is temperature and time controlled.
Without enough time at saccharification temperature the enzymatic activity
wouldn't be sufficient to do this.  As the temperature rises, the enzymes are
quickly denatured.

I believe virtually all commercial breweries mash all of the grain bill
together.  What this means to the homebrewer is unclear to me.

I mash all the time, and it hasn't helped me learn this stuff.  Contrary to
the general beliefs of the esteemed capitalist from Chicago, some things you
just have to get from books.  Sorry to admit I've not done enough reading in
this area.

Subject: D.C. Places




          A correction to the message that said there were no brewpubs in 
          D.C.  The Capitol City Brewpub is right across the street from 
          the Convention Center.  They serve ales and lagers (emphasis on 
          lagers) and have some good food under $10. The beers range from 
          great to mediocre, and sometimes stray from the stated style, 
          probably to appeal to the untrained palates of the masses (I 
          know, I'm a snob), so ask for tastes first.  It gets really 
          packed right after work, so expect a wait if you want a table.
          
          Warning on the Brickskeller:  if you order an obscure label, 
          there is a good chance the beer will be stale.  It's amazing that 
          in cosmopolitan DC they have a place that serves 600 beers and 
          many customers still order "BUD".  Otherwise, cool place.
          
          Bardo in Arlington is worth the trip.  Their own beers are 
          inconsistent, but there plenty of other choices.  The food is 
          great, the service is lousy, but that's part of the charm.
          
          As of two weeks ago there were no "brewpubs" in Old Town 
          Alexandria, but there are plenty of places that serve good beer.  
          Try Hard Times Cafe, an award-winning chili parlor.
          
          The limited selection above is one reason I moved back to Seattle 
          after 4 years in DC.
          
          I feel a little guilty (but not much) writing so extensively 
          about brewpubs in a "homebrew" group, but beer appreciation comes 
          with the territory.  Is there another existing place where this 
          thread is more appropriate?

 I just brought my new enamel-on-steel kettle home and I set it on my electric

need to have an all stainless steel kettle such as a cut-up keg or a very
