Subject: RE: Hunter Airstat Modification


In HBD1156 Bruce Ray asks how to modify a Hunter Airstat to maintain 
temperatures below 40F.


I originally posted this last November and have been using it with
the mod very happily ever since.  I use the airstat to control a 
13cf chest freezer. I put the airstat in a manual "HOLD" mode and
simply set the temperature up or down as desired. The airstat is
designed to control a compressor driven refrigeration device (a
room air conditioner) so it is right at home with a refrigerator or
freezer. It turns the attached unit on when it senses a temperature
2 degrees above the setting and off 1 degree below the setting. It
has a built-in timer with a 4 minute delay to keep the attached unit
from cycling too rapidly. At 45F my freezer runs less than 2 hours
total in a 24 hour period and about 3 hours at 35F.


You cannot change the Air Stat range but you can offset the sensor 
calibration.  In other words, performing the following modification
will allow you to set the Airstat at 40F yet the fridge/freezer temp
will be maintained at 35F.


The sensor is a thermister that provides 10K ohms of resistance at 
25 degrees C. According to the thermister data sheet, at 32 degrees F
: [m[K the resistance is 27.28K and 22.05K at 41 degrees F. The resistance
decreases as the temperature rises so if you make the air stat think
the sensor is 22k when its really 25k the air stat will say 41 but
the sensor temp will be around 35 degrees F. This is done by simply
putting more resistance in parallel with the sensor. Using ohms law,


        Rt = 22K, Rth = 25K (Thermister), and Rp (parallel resistor) =


                Rth (25K) * Rt (22K)
                --------------------  =  183K Ohms
                Rth (25K) - Rt (22K)
 
With this resistor in place the the range of the air stat is effectively
shifted about 5 degrees lower.  Just keep in mind that the temperature
reading on the air stat will not match the fridge temp.


The thermisters change in resistance is not linear. It will change about
20k ohms going from -13F to -4F and only 2k ohms going from 68F to 77F. 
Therefore the desired range of use should be considered before determining
the magnitude of offset. Although, in the 12 degree swing between 33F and 
45F this should not pose a problem.

I installed a 180K ohm resister in series with a sub-mini spst toggle
switch mounted on the front panel just left of the AC outlet and below the
pocket that holds the sensor. It is fairly easy to do since the sensor 
leads are readily accessible. This switch lets me use the airstat normally
above 40 degrees when off and down to 34-35 when on. The airstat seems to
sample the sensor about every 5-10 seconds and will indicate the change
in this timeframe.

Subject: Transplanting hops


Last year I planted two hills of Cascade hops and both did beautifully the
first year.  However, some other plants in my garden have taken off early
this year and are shading one hill significantly.  Although the shaded
hill has sprouted, the sprouts aren't going anywhere.  I was wondering if
I might have any luck moving this sprouting crop to a sunnier location. 
Advice would be appreciated.  Cutting the offending shading plants is not 
an option.

Subject: Malt Extracts (Truth in Labelling)


Every few weeks or so, the question arises:  what is actually *in* the malt
extracts sold to homebrewers?  Would it be too much for extract makers to
give us some information?  Are they hiding something?  Just saying "Pale" or
"Amber" or "Dark" extract tells us almost nothing.  We shouldn't have to rely
on laboratory tests to find out how the extracts are made.  I would be
overjoyed to see something like this provided with malt extracts:


Base malt:
Specialty grains:
Mash temperature:
Mash time:


Is this too much?  They could provide extract numbers, color numbers, and a
whole slew of other information too, if they wanted.  Anybody want to bend
the ears of the guys at Briess or Munton&Fison, et. al.???

I have been folwing the aretion thread, and thought of another possible way
to areate. What if I took a corny keg, filled it with water, and pressurized
it for a day or so with O2 from my welding tank? Would the boil remove all
the O2. I actually add most of my water during sparging, so I could get away
with it anyway. It seems this method would have two advantages: The O2 would
be sterile, and the amount of O2 could be controlled. What do you folks think?

Subject: re: strength of enamel pots


Regarding the recent thread on enamel or "ceramic on steel" brew pots:
     There is good cause for concern about the strength of the handles on
these units.  My mother was once taken to the emergency room with 2nd and
3rd degree burns after a handle broke off of an enamel canning pot full of
scalding Elderberry jelly concoction ready for bottling.  This was a tragedy
akin to losing a batch of your best Pilsner-to-be, both because Ma was
injured and because Elderberry jelly is like nectar of the gods to me.  Why
am I only now thinking of the obvious zymological possibilities here?...


    I use an enamel pot in brewing but I either avoid lifting it when full
 or hold onto the wide lip at the rim.  Others have noted that they avoid
 lifting theirs by siphoning and stringing a hose from the tap for filling.
The caution is warranted.


   On a related issue, after years of experience (none of it metallurgical),
I believe there is no reason to suspect that an enamel pot cannot withstand
the heat of a SuperMegaCajunKingCookerFlameThrower--as long as it's got some
kind of fluid inside (wort or water probably better than gas or kerosene).
Melting an empty one might be an interesting thing to watch, however.

I liked this too.  It was the practical side of tradition.  I was a bit
suprised to read that they didnt like cask hopping at "higher levels".
They said they settled on 1/6th of an oz per keg, if I remember right, 
claiming a tinny effect.  I have used up to 40 oz in a 5 gal keg with 
no tinny effects, this is with East KEnt Goldings.

I know this is a bit dated... sorry. 
I use this exact same setup and have come to the realization that
its the valve in the bottling bucket. Mine always traps a bubble
around the intake to the valve which causes foaming before getting
to the phils philler. Next time you bottle, check the 3/8 tube and
see if you don't notice bubbles flowing down to the 
filler. As you fill you can hear the turbulance created at the 
bottom of the bottle as the beer flows in. I would bet the plunger 
type bottler would be worse than the phils because of the small 
outlet at the bottom. One thing I've found that helps is to raise 
the bottle to just below the top of the liquid level in the bucket. 
This lowers the head pressure in the line and decreses the flow 
somewhat but allows the bottle to fill easier. 
As always -- your mileage...

Subject: air stones, aeration, hot air?


Cold water from the tap is usually highly aerated. If you pour a  
partial boil into a primary 1/3 to 1/2 filled with cold tap water you  
should have sufficient aeration.


I do a full boil & chill so I siphon against the side (mostly inside,  
sometimes not) of my primary and let the wort run down the inside  
while trying to keep the splashing to a minimum. This seems to work  
for me. Fermentation starts fast (I do starter cultures) and my beers  
can last up to a year. I believe that the wort is sufficiently  
aerated this way and that oxidation is minimized. I don't bother to
shake the primary other than carrying it down a flight of stairs to  
the basement. Man was made to lift beer by the glass not the carboy.


I do not understand why anyone would want to pump air into their  
beer. I put an airlock on my fermenters to keep air out. Pumping air  
in makes little sense to me and those I know who tried it, saw no  
differences.  If memory serves, yeast becomes anerobic soon after  
start up so continued addition of air may actually hurt. If you want  
to do this, however, I refer you to Moe's Marine Aquarium Reference  
for easy to construct filters. These will help eliminate dust,  
cigarette smoke, your roommate's noxious....(well, you get the point)  
that would otherwise be pumped into your beer.  Finally, keep the  
pump above the level of the diffuser. Otherwise, you run the risk of  
creating a siphon in the case of a power failure.


By the way Moe includes a good section on water from a non-brewing  
perspective. Also, easy DIY charcoal filters for tap water and other  
DIY ideas that may help.  One caveat, most marine fish keepers like  
to raise their PH, not lower it.  Use these ideas to address specific   
problems or for the fun of experimentation.

Subject: slow fermentation


Two weeks ago I put a "Williams" stout into the primary fermenter.  
Nothing happened for a couple of days as far as fermentation, so I 
aerated it.  The next morning it was bubbling away slowly.  For the next 
few days the fermentation appeared to progress, but never very 
vigorously.  I was ready to bottle yesterday and had sterilized my 
bottles and was all set up before I took a gravity reading.  It was about 
1.030 and the recipe said it should be down to at least 1.022.  I aerated 
it again and resealed the primary fermenter.  My question is this.  If I 
can't get the yeast to kick in and finish fermentation, should I rack it 
and repitch the yeast?  I am at a total loss as to what went wrong.  I 
have never had any problem with slow fermentation before.  I live in a 
very mild climate and the temperature has been about 60 to 65 degrees 
throughout.  I used the liquid yeast that came with the kit and the 
packet swelled right away and I used it within a couple of days after it 
had swelled.  Anyway I am trying to salvage this batch if I can.  Thanks 
in advance for any advice.

But I WILL still use my aluminum.  It works just fine. I don't clean it
too much. Just leave a crusty layer of wort. ALL I use it for is brewing.
Oxidize aluminum is pretty unreactive, whereas un-oxidized is highly
reactive.  So I figure leave a good coating, then it's fine.  It can stand up
to acid just fine.  I don't get alkaline in contact with it.  That wood be bad.
Aluminum is a better conductor than stainless, just harder to clean. 
So I don't!  Just scrape off the pellets and leave the hardened wort.


Since someone once worried about:  
"not cleaning off the inside oxidised layer.  If you were making stew, I 
would say go ahead, because that "seasoned layer" as its called prevents 
food from sticking. However, I would wonder what old food flavors might 
leach out of it when boiling wort in it. Maybe if you do a couple of dark beers
first, it would  cover it up. "   Ok, so it ain't no Dutch Oven.


But the point here is:  Enamel on steel should be fine.  BUT, have a grain
of salt (or barley). My burners aren't as hot as a King Kooker's.  But they 
do fit a Dutch Oven, and brewpot just fine!  You might consider a 
pizza stone to rest on the electric burner, or flatten some pipe to position
on either side and rest the pot on that, to save the burner from strain.


As for use of a Propane Cooker indoors: The responses I got dealt mostly
with the hazard of storing/using PROPANE indoors. Leaks can become a
SERIOUS fire/explosion hazard.  I have mine RIGHT next to a window with 
a window fan pulling air & exhaust out. The room is FAR from airtight.
The propane tank intself sits outside to avoid potential propane buildup.
(you WILL know. Imagine really nasty fart gas from cheap mexican food!)
A window across the basement draws in fresh air. Most responses were more
concerned with air depletion than CO accumulation. I haven't smelled any! :)
I will be using it a relatively closed garage (big, fan exhaust again).
Many people use them in garages w/o hazard that I'm aware of. Let me know
if I'm wrong...please I can take it (as long as I'm still alive!)
Good thing Coyote's have 9 lives, and extras can be ordered from ACME cat#69L.

Come-on,  get a room fellas!     But NOT in Colorado!      :) <kidding!!>


But really:  I do hope this, uh,  er...debate can now be considered resolved.
                 (ok, so I know better.   Jack?  Your serve.)


PS:  Kinney are you really 6'8".  Wow- you can make BIG beer with extracts!


FWIW:  I thought I'd take this opportunity to chime in with some old news
I never did get to posting.  A couple years back js and I arranged a mail 
swap of some goods.  He posted a very nice and flattering description of his 
impression of a Cyser I had sent him.  It was so, tasty and effective, that his 
SO dragged him off to the bedroom before the bottle was finished.  IMHO 
that is a GOOD sign for any Mead- type beverage.  I couldn't have had a 
higher compliment, well except for my dad finishing off a bottle of it 
himself. He is a mid->good quality wine-drinker.


Anyway... point being....Jack had sent me a bottle of a Pale Ale. I was too 
impatient to wait for it to settle, so I had a cloudy glass.  It was quite
tasty, smooth, a bit  underhopped for my preference, but- hey...I'm a hophead 
in a big way.  It had a good head and was overall a very clean tasty ferment.


He had also sent a tiny sample of some brandy made from wine.  
The joke, which I missed at the time (over my head!)  was that the beer 
was a non-alcoholic brew, and if you wanted a kick, you were to add the 
brandy to the beer. I was a little embarassed, but I extend it as a 
compliment, that for the life of me, I couldn't tell!  Ok, so I was under the 
influence of a couple of MY brews already, but I could not detect any 
evidence of wrongdoing.  SO...  why bring this up?   Cuz I felt like it.   
 
Besides, sometime back there was a discussion of making NA homebrew.  
Just so you all know, the method of heating fermented brew to drive
off the alcohol seems to work without detriment.  
I'm not gonna do it!  A good hb buzz makes for better howling! Owwoooo!
                                           
BUT...Jack,just so you don't think I'M kissing up to you...and the rest of ya'
I have NOT bought a Schmidling mill.  I have an 'ol flour making wheat
grinder type aquired from an ex-girlfriend.  Motorized, stone grinding 
wheels.  It does as good (better) as a Corona stone grinder would. I've seen 
a Maltmill in action (Art's brew supply in SLC) and it seems fine.  I'd be
glad to perform a comparison grind if arf would be willing to give another
mill away as a thanks for the 10,000 he has now sold. (to ME I mean!)
And I truly would post a QUICK response as to the results! No REALLY!
Quicker than you can say-  "grind me baby, grind it good! Grind is fine!"


Finally:  I did want to point out that in a video made by the above 
mentioned Schmidling productions (tm,inc,esqu,mfr,etc.!) Jack himself
can clearly be seen SUCKING on the end of a siphon hose, and then
racking finished beer with a DISTINCT splashing and spraying of wort.
Later in the Video, a homebrew suppliers is quoted as saying, "90%, no
99% of the time the biggest problem for a newbrewer is due to oxidation. "


Just so it doesn't sound all bad: Jack had some very nifty time-lapse
imagery of yeast budding, and grain germination. Ok, so there was the
cheesy computer graphics (read: mouse). I guess it's an old production.  


SO, now I've completed MY end of the bargain and posted a statement
of my impression of arf's NA beer.  It was an all-grain if I remember.
                        So THERE!  Nya!

Help!  I hate the bastards!  They CAN be devasting! Some of my new
cutting are under attack!  Go away little beasties, be gone! HELP!!!!


Lastly: That "too hoppy" brew from Red Rock (in SLC) I would guess
is the Amber. It is dry hopped, and has what I consider a nice dry 
cascade hopped flavor.  It's not over-bitter, which is what I'd consider
"too hoppy".  Have you ever tried dry hopping a homebrew? It's a truly
different beast of a hop quality. 
Ok, so a hop-back'll do it too!  Right  Kinney!    :)


Really lastly this time: Another brew pub in SLC: UINTA (sp?) 1700 S. 300 W.
Haven't never been there yet. Please report if anyone tries it!

Subject: Under-Aeration for Scotch Ales?


In the brewing series "Scotch Ale" book, Noonan talks about under-aerating
the wort. You are supposed to pitch huge quantities of yeast, but not aerate
very much. The theory goes that you don't want a bunch of yeast reproduction,
just for them to start eating. I think (and that's dangerous) this is supposed
to reduce some of the flavors normally associated with Ales. Also, you're
supposed to ferment at lower temps (like ~50F).


By the way, huge quantities means a gallon starter for a S.G. 1.090
Wee Heavy.


The variations for each beer style is amazing. This sure is a great hobby!

Hello All,
I'm a new subscriber to the group (I've received and read all of 3 distribs) 
and was amazed at the brewers wars (extract vs. all-(mi)grain) that I've 
seen.  I'm been a novice brewer for the past 2 or so years and (please 
don't thrash me for it, but...) an extract brewer also.  I've had some 
pretty good luck so far with brewing some very tasty and pretty potent 
beers.  I even had one batch win First Place in 92 at the HWBTA in Dallas
for the Speciatly Pale Ale catagory (English Bitter Recipe).  I've only
had 2 batches come out bad after I got somewhat lazy during sterilization.
I dumped those to the learning bucket and have taken more care in what I 
do now.  I signed up to this distribution to get some helpful brewing 
tips, do's and dont's, and your favorite recipes (extract and all-grain),
 _NOT_ to read why someone is a non person unless they hate Zima and 
only brew all-grain recipes.  Those of you who have made the
step/jump/leap/dive from extract to all-grain, how long were you using
the extract recipes?  How much was your investment for the new tools of 
the trade needed for all-grain brewing?  I'm sure at some point in my 
hobby I will want to make the change to all-grain, but until then 
I'll keep on with the ole reliable extracts that have brought myself 
and freinds many hours of frosty mug tipping hapiness.  Cheers.

I'm curious whether there's any sort of consensus on the best container for
primary fermentation of a 5 gallon batch.  I'm about to purchase a second
carboy, and don't know if I should get another 5 gal. model, and continue
to use a blowoff tube, or whether a larger one--with its greater safety of
having a fermentation lock on right from the start--is the way to go.


Is getting rid of the nasty kraeusen worth the risk of contamination?
Do the blowoff tubes often get clogged and pop off?  And just how
nasty is that gunky foam?


Thanks for any suggestions

From: David Draper <ddraper`at`laurel.ocs.mq.edu.au>
Subject: Pressure barrels/cask cond.


Hi All, after the excellent series on cask conditioning and a couple of
subsequent followups (my redundancy of the week), I offer my experiences
in using a pressure barrel for that cask-conditioned feeling.  I used a
King Keg barrel, 5 imperial gallon capacity.  I think this one is superior
to the Hambleton Bard or Boots version because it has a top-tap system:
the tap is near the top, to which a hose is attached that in turn has a
plastic "floater" on it, so you are always drawing from the top surface of
the liquid.  It comes with a CO2-injection valve on the lid, which allows
you to apply pressure for dispensing when the level of liquid gets
sufficiently low that conditioning pressure is no longer enough to push
the brew out.  A nifty trick when using this is that, when you rack into
the barrel, you can *loosely* fit the cap, then attach your CO2 canister
and just *barely* engage it--so that there is a slight, but constant
stream of CO2 being injected into the barrel.  After a second or two, the
CO2 fills the ullage in the barrel, and pushes the air (which is lighter)
out of the loosely-fitted cap.  Another second later, and there is only
CO2 inside the keg.  You then screw down the cap while that slight CO2
stream is still flowing, then disengage the canister and store the barrel
until ready to drink.  I don't take credit for this idea--I gleaned it
from somewhere, but I don't remember where--might even have been netsters
for all I know (sorry if I'm not crediting a reader who told me about it...)


It is definitely true that, even with the above trick, the last 1/3 of the
barrel will have very off flavors if the beer is drunk at the typical pace
of a 5-gallon batch.  However, if you anticipate a rapid-consumption
situation, it can't be beat.  Great for poker night, for example. 
Alternatively, just put a batch in there and don't touch it *until* you
have a rapid-consumption event.  I would suggest that, with judicious use
of the CO2 canister, one could drink the first 1/3 of the barrel at normal
pace, and then consume the last 2/3 in such an event, and have good beer
throughout.  You really do get the feel of British pub beer using this--my
British mates, some of whom were none too polite-for-politeness's-sake,
were quite complimentary on my barreled efforts, despite the drawbacks I
faced while brewing in Britain (as readers of my posts are now sick of
hearing: no liquid yeast, v. poorly kept hops).


Just my 2 pence worth.
Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Wow, sounds like an excellent argument for the SS perforated sheet false 
bottom, but I guess you need to deal with dinosaur vendors.....


Seriously, I think what Jack has discovered is yet another reason why 
counterflow chillers are better than immersion, trub removal.  By combining
both the hot and cold trub, and by optimizing your trub precipitation, you
have overwhelmed the ability of your little home brewery to adequately 
remove the trub.  If you had used a false bottom as a hop back, the surface
area available to help seperate the hot trub would have kept most of the
hot trub in the kettle.  Cold trub is not nearly as significant a problem, 
and is easily removed if you use open fermentation to skim, as Jack and I
do.  Cold trub can also be removed somewhat by bubbling oxygen in the 
fermenter, essentially making a crude floatation tank.


Good brewing,

It seems to me that to minimize water useage, you are going to have to devellop
a closed system - in other words, recirculate the same water through the
chiller and find a way to remove the heat from the recirculating water.  I
would use a fairly high volume water pump that circulates water from a tank,
through the wort chiller, then through a radiator to remove the heat from the
water, and then back into the tank.


You will have to play with the variables like circulation rate, total water
volume, etc.  I'm not sure how efficient this setup would be, but it will
conserve water.


My guess is that you will also need a fan to circulate air through the radiator
and dissipate the heat.  Sounds like an interesting experiment - good luck with
it.

I am using a 5 Gal glass carboy and a recipe for a simple amber (4 Gal).
I'm getting good fermentation (it's bubbling its little heart out), but it
