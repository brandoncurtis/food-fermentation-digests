No consensus, but I'm sure you were actually fishing for thoughts.  Most
will probably center around blowoff & head loss theories.  I hope to add
a different consideration.


Just a thought about which carboy to get.  I have both the 5 & 6.7 gallon
versions and now do my primary fermentation in the 6.7 & secondary
fermentation in the 5.  Why?  Because I reuse the slurry.  If you read
back a few postings from yours in today's hbd you will find an article
that mentions that its important to use a large yeast count.  What I do
is perform the primary ferment in the 6.7 gallon carboy.  When the batch
is ready to be transferred to the secondary I brew another batch.  When
the next batch is chilled and ready for transfer to the primary, I transfer
the contents of the 6.7 carboy into a 5 gallon secondary and leave the
"sludge" behind.  This sludge is the yeast starter for the next batch.  I
then dump the new batch onto the yeast sludge and fermentation is
evident within minutes.  The reason I use a 6.7 gallon caboy for the
primary is that the yeast cake will increase in volume over several
batches (I typically repeat the sequence 6 times before I begin a
new yeast).  I have done this using both liquid & dry yeast as the
initial yeast and have had excellent results.


Just something to consider in the decision process,
Chris

I agree completely.  AHA has set up a project to boil and analyze
25 different malt extracts (both liquid and dry).  Just Brew It. 
club members will boil all the extracts under as similar conditions
as possible and take a 500 ml. sample.  The samples will be sent

You might also have sufficent extraneous microorganisms to spoil your
beer.  Extract brewers doing a partial boil should make sure that *all*
the water they're using is pre-boiled.  Ask your local water bureau --
even they can't insure that *everything* has been kilt before it gets to
your warm, sweet, comfy wort (bacteria heaven) where they'll have plenty
of opportunity to multiply.  And the water bureau makes that attempt
with chlorine (sometimes lots of it), and boiling helps drive off the
chlorine.

Look up the section on fermentation in George Fix's "Principles of
Brewing Science" for an explanation of the necessity of oxygen in good
fermentation.  No one is suggesting (as far as I've seen) adding oxygen
beyond the pitching stage.  By the way, no one, NO ONE, wants to pump
air into their "beer" -- we're talking about cold wort, at the
pre-fermentation stages.

Subject: Attenuation of #1968: Special London Ale Yeast




I wonder if anyone can relate their experiences with the new wyeast Special
London Ale Culture.  I pitched it to a typical Pale Ale recipe that had a
average OG of about 1.048.  Everyting about the mash was normal.  I got a
good vigorous ferment, though not a real boiler.  After six days in the
primary and four in the second, I expect to be at a target # for a FG. 
However the reading is only about 1.018 and the ferment looks pretty well
done (oh maybe i could squeeze a point or two more out of it over the next
few days.  


Question: the strain is promoted as rich, full, malty.  Does this mean
low-medium attenuation and a higher than normal (normal in my book is
1.010-12) Final Gravity?  The Raw taste check is okay, considering the
stage.  Should I pitch in some dry yeast to squeeze out a couple more
points? My instinct and my worry level--which is low--says no.  I've
heard great
things about this strain and I'm dying to get in the bottle and get it to
the summer table.  Responez vous by private E-mail or to the list.


Thanks.

 If you insist on using my name in vain, kindly read what I say carefully

 I said no such thing and (paraphrased) does not get you off the hook.
 
 It hardly seems worth once more, repeating what I said but I can probably 
 paraphrase it a bit more accurately and it certainly will be the last time I 
 try.
 
 I said something to the effect that just because the pH of the sparge/mash 
 water is beyond the "normal" range, does not mean that it is necessary to 
 adjust it before using it.  I suggested brewing a batch first to see if there 
 is a problem and as a reference point if adjustments are made in future 
 batches.
 
 Your article is interesting in and of itself but to drag me into it to

Johnathan,


Your method will oxygenate the water, just as force carbonation 
carbonates it.  But when the wort is boiled, *ALL* dissolved gas 
is removed from the liquid.  The only gas present in the boil is water 
vapor (steam) which contains some of the organic components from the wort 
that happen to dissolve into the water vapor bubbles as the bubbles rise 
to the surface.


May I cautiously suggest using your method to oxygenate the wort after the 
boil.  Use the same procedure as force carbonation, but less pressure.  Or,
a SS bubbling stone attached to your O2 tank (since you already have one)
would also work very well.  The small bubbles increase the surface area
between water and gas, thus increasing O2 transfer.  Within 15-20 minutes,
your wort should be at over 50% O2 saturation.  Remember previous posts
said that over 25% O2 sat. did not improve the fermentation rate.  The SS
airstone attached to an aquarium pump (with an inline charcoal filter)
will get you up to 20% O2 sat., (since the air is 20% O2, 80% N2) within
30 min.  I personally use the air pump method and do two 20 min. sessions,
once before pitching, and then the next morning just for good measure.

        I would think that boiling will drive off all of the disolved O2.  Even
heating it to 170F for sparging will likely rid most of the O2(imho) -- not to
mention the full hour boil.  However, as one is racking to the primary, it may
be a good idea to bubble your welding O2 into the sweet wort.  This should be a
better source of oxygen than using an aquarium pump and pumping RAW air & all
the air-borne nasties through the wort.

Subject: More on AmAleYeast...


     Regarding the several comments on 1056 American Ale yeast, lemme 
     try this idea out on you all: my impression is that 1056 is much 
     more temperature sensitive than other ale yeasts, especially on 
     the cool side. Seems if I pitch a little late, after wort temp 
     has fallen, 1056 is terribly slow to get going. Also, I just had 
     an over-prime problem with a batch (bottled during a Feb cold 
     snap), and I suspect the 1056 fooled me by quitting before the 
     ferment was done. Never seem to have these problems with Canadian 
     Ale yeast and English (Whitbread) which are the two other ale 
     yeasts I use most of the time.

I have to say right from the start that I think using cat litter in beer is
disgusting!  Besides, I'm allergic to cats!  ;O)


**


One solution to Brett Shorten's farmer friend's drought/chiller problem is a
recirculation pump.  I don't have the details, but I believe John Palmer uses
one (palmer#d#john`at`ssdgwy.mdc.com).  Bug him for the details; I'm sure he
won't mind...  OR...  He could collect the outflow (hot) water and use it for
other things like cleaning up afterwards (I do).  He could even dump it back
into his tank; it's only been run through some copper.


**


As to Will Smith's extraction woes:  the first batch, which you achieved 25
pts/lb/gallon is pretty normal, especially if the 5 gallons of 1.050 wort was
after the boil, etc.  You have some lost wort in the kettle (I do) and in the
hops, which pulls the numbers down.  I suspect before the boil you had 26-27
pts., which isn't bad at all, though you could push it up a little with
practice.  The second batch I calculated 13 pts/lb/gallon.  The only thing I
can think of here is that you didn't get full conversion in your mash (did
you do a starch test?).  Maybe your temperature was a little higher than you
thought and the enzymes deactivated too quickly.  As to soft water, get some
pH papers and check the pH of the mash.  This could negatively affect
conversion if its not close to 5.  Good Luck.

Subject:  No Head in brew.


Hello,
  I am a novice brewer and just finished brewing my first batch of
homebrew. I read a couple of  books and researched the brewing
process several weeks before I started to do any brewing. Well my first
batch of Pale ale (done with  hopped extract) was done by the books. I
cooked it in a 8 gal enamel canning pot and  used a two stage
fermenting process. After a few days I was able to bottle it into 25oz
champaign bottles. Well the waiting is all done and I opened my very
first bottle of homebrew last night and was quite disappointed. The beer
didn't have any type of head retention. There was good carbonation,
and a head did form but quickly  disappeared. The beer tasted OK but
didn't have enough hoppy flavor, I did add some finishing hops 15
minutes before the end of boil, but I guess it wasn't enough.


My question is what should I do to increase the head retention in my
brew. I have read about Heading liquids but don't know anything about
them, should I use them. What is it in the brew that caused the head to
remain after pouring?


If any of you Pro Brewers could help me out I would greatly appreciate
it.

Brewers:
        What is the critical temperature for HSA to start appearing?  Is the

        As per my procedure:  I sparge into a separate pail as I use my boil
kettle to heat the sparge water.  Once I have collected most of the run-off (and
the kettle is empty) I pour from the pail into the kettle (read a reasonable
amount of aeration here -- I pour as gently as I can, but....).  Generally, the
last 2 gallons of run-off are drained directly into the kettle.
        Once in the kettle, the wort is not moved while hot.

Does anybody have a receipe for Duvel Belgian Ale, or a close approximation?
I've Checked Cat's 2, but I'm not sure if any of what I see would 
really be close.
Duvel, at least to me, has a taste like a combination of a Tripple and 
a Wheat such as Paulaners Hefe-Weizen.  Both extract and all grain 
ideas welcome.
Reply to me directly, and I'll summarize in a later issue.

Is a leaky propane tank a common thing?  If storing the tank in the 
garage or basement is bad, where do you store it?  Out in the backyard?
Should you build a little box to protect the tank from the weather
and keep it outside under the porch or something?


Also, how many batches do people get from a 20# tank?  I'm usually right
around empty after four batches.  So that's about $2 per batch for
propane (for you extract people that are counting cents).

Subject: open ferment, pH, pizza stone


          I have seen quite a few references in the past 2 weeks to
          open fermentation.  This is not a "thread" per se, as these
          have been in unrelated postings, but the topic does come up
          frequently.  I no longer use a blow off tube (to avoid
          losing too much beer).  I use an 8 gal plastic primary
          fermentor and rack to a 5 gal glass carboy secondary.  I
          start with 6 gal of water (partial mash recipe) so after
          boiling, racking off hot break, and racking off trub, I have
          just enough beer to fill the secondary to the neck.  This
          seems to give me more beer for the effort.  But after
          reading the nice series on cask ales, and seeing the open
          fermentation vats in M. Jackson's book, I am considering
          just leaving the top of my primary fermentor loose and
          skimming the crud during vigorous fermentation.  Do any of
          you with open fermentation experience have any hints?  Is
          this really a good idea given the paranoia over
          contamination and oxidation that is so prevalent in the
          homebrew literature?


          On water pH:  I have little experience in the water
          chemistry of brewing so I have stayed out the the pH
          discussion.  However I am a biochemist and some of the
          comments made on water chemistry sound questionable.  My
          comments are from a chemist who brews, not a brewing
          chemist.  Water is buffered by the presence of weak acids
          and bases.  When the pH drops (H+ goes up), weak bases in
          solution react with the H+ to become weak acids.  When the
          pH goes up (H+ goes down), weak acids lose H+'s to become
          weak bases.  These molecules act like H+ resevoirs --
          soaking up extra H+'s and replacing lost H+'s.  The
          concentration of free H+ changes relatively little.  Thus
          the solution is buffered.  Many moleucles in the mash are
          acids that can potentially act as buffers.  Amino acids,
          phosphate, carbonate, even denatured proteins will buffer a
          solution.  Certainly many of these moleucles will not be
          rinsed out by sparging.  Diluting a buffer does not change
          its pH.  It seems unlikely that sparging with very soft,
          distilled or deionized water will raise mash pH
          significantly.  I want to learn more on the water chemistry
          in the mash.  What are your favorite references?


          Finally, someone mentioned using a pizza stone under a 33 qt
          kettle on an electric stove.  Could that person please
          elaborate?  Thanks

Subject: Madison, WI competition


Saturday, May 14 marks the date for the Eighth Annual BIG and HUGE homebrew
competition, sponsored by the Madison Homebrewers and Tasters Guild, Ltd.


Homebrewed beers (beer only, please) of big and huge character will be 
evaluated by experienced beer judges, and evaluation sheets will be returned
to every entrant.


Ribbons will be awarded for the top three entries in each category, and best 
of show will receive the much-coveted Woolly Mammoth Plaque.  Awards won in
the Big and Huge also apply to point scoring for Midwest Homebrewer of the Year
(for residents of appropriate midwestern states).


Categories:


Big Ale (OG 1.050 - 1.060)


Huge Ale (OG 1.060 and up)


Big Lager (OG 1.050 - 1.060)


Huge Lager (OG 1.060 and up)


If your OG was right at 1.060, you have the choice of which category (big or
huge) you would like to enter.


In each of the four classifications, beers will be evaluated based on the AHA 
style category proposed by the entrant and will be in competition with all
others of different different styles in the same B&H class. For example, a
barley wine and a trippel will be judged according to their respective
style characteristics, but their numerical scores will be compared against
each other for possible awards in the Huge Ale category. Similarly, American
pale ales and robust porters can compete for Big Ale honors (provided they
qualify with respect to OG readings), but they will each be judged, of course,
according to their respective style characteristics. On your entry form and
bottle labels you must indicate both the AHA style category and the 
appropriate big or huge category.


This event will take place Saturday, May 14, 1994 at 6 pm at the University of
Wisconsin Memorial Union, 800 Langdon St., Madison, WI. See 'Today in the 
Union' for the assigned room, or ask at the information desk.


MHaTG members, including competition staff are eligible to enter the 
competition; appropriate measures will be taken to assure anonymity and 
fairness in judging. Judges will NOT evaluate beers in the categories of their
own entries (makes sense, eh?) Judging will be done the evening of the event
in strict accordance with AHA competition guidelines. Entries from
professional brewers and/or beers brewed on commercial premises are 
ineligible.


Entry requirements: Three 10-17 ounce brown or green crown-capped
bottles (no swing-top Grolsch-style bottle) per entry. Bottles and caps must
have no labels an/or identifying marks, including raised lettering. Printed
caps should be blacked out with a permanent marker. You guys know the drill.
Attach one completed entry form to each bottle with a rubber band - no glue 
or tape. Recipes should be packed with the beers, but do not need to be 
attached to each bottle.


Fees: MHaTG members $3.50 per entry / Non-members $4.50 per entry before 
5pm on May 13 - $5.50 day of show. $7.00 per additional entry for residents
of Midwest Homebrewer of the Year states.


If you cannot deliver them personally, you may send them to:


        The Wine and Hop Shop
        ATTN: BIG and HUGE
        434 State Street
        Madison, WI 53703


until 4pm the day of the competition. You may deliver them personally between
4:30 and 5:30 pm to the site. We are not responsible for the perils of 
shipping homebrew.

Subject: mashing specialty dark grains


Greetings,


In an attempt to recreate a "Bass" Ale with an all grain method I mashed only
6-row malt and Chocolate; 6# and 3 oz. respectively.  What I ended up with was
practically stout.  I had made a similar Ale long ago when I was still extract
brewing and used 1/2# of chocolate with remarkably good results (i.e. like
Bass).  My question is should mashing these dark grains have had such a
significant effect?  I've gotten differing opinions from fellow Zymugists in my
area.  I use an oven mashing technique, single step infusion for about 90
minutes, standard 170 degree sparge.


Incidentally it made great dark and rich ale, not too thick but some bitterness
was evidently contributed by the chocolate since my hops schedule was aiming at
about 23 IBU.


Thanks for the help.

<Jim Busch wrote>
   Seriously, I think what Jack has discovered is yet another reason why 
   counterflow chillers are better than immersion, trub removal.  By combining
   both the hot and cold trub, and by optimizing your trub precipitation, you
   have overwhelmed the ability of your little home brewery to adequately 
   remove the trub.  If you had used a false bottom as a hop back, the surface
   area available to help separate the hot trub would have kept most of the
   hot trub in the kettle.  Cold trub is not nearly as significant a problem, 
   and is easily removed if you use open fermentation to skim, as Jack and I
   do.  Cold trub can also be removed somewhat by bubbling oxygen in the 
   fermenter, essentially making a crude floatation tank.


I have been using a stainless-steel screen in my kettle to separate
the hop cones from the wort.  I have noticed that after chilling with
my immersion chiller and racking out from below the screen (with a
spigot drilled through the kettle) that the hops do a pretty good job
of filtering out the break material.  I have switched from using
very-high alpha hops to low--medium alpha hops to increase the depth
of the hop bed that the wort must filter through.  However, I am
somewhat uncertain as to how much of the trub I am removing.  How much
volume should I expect to get from the hot and cold break material?  I
have thought of "washing" the hops to see how much trub they actually
capture.  Secondly, I have been thinking about recirculating the first
gallon or so from the kettle back through the hop bed.  I believe that
this will give me better trub removal and do no harm.  Has anyone
tried this?  This method would seem to remove the trub removal
advantage of counterflow chillers.

Subject: Re: Wort Chillers when water shortages are a problem


Brett,
        I'm a new brewer.  I borrowed a friends immersion chiller for my
first batch.  He moved before I brewed my second batch (he got his chiller
back before he left :-) ).  I bought supplies to make a similar chiller that
hooks up to the faucet via a washing machine hose.  When brewing my second
batch, I could only find the tubing and the bag of everything else had been
misplaced; so I had to improvise (which is the fun part of brewing).
        To chill my second batch, I filled up a bottling bucket with water
and put in some blue ice.  I attached 3/8" plastic tubing to the spigot and
attached the other end to the input of the immersion coil.  I started cooling
my extract wort (~2gal H20 + extract).  It was cooled in about 15-20 minutes
supprisingly only using about 3 gallons of water.  The cooling time between
the first and second methods was about the same.
        What suprised be was the small quantity of "COLD* water that needed.
Your mileage may vary.

Subject: What's in Extracts?


 In HBD #1409, Norm <npyle`at`n33.ecae.stortek.com> wonders if it is too much
 to ask malt extract producers to provide detailed information about the
 formulation and production of their products.


 Well, coincidentally, I called Briess Malting Co. in Chilton, WI this morning
 to ask that very question.  I was told by the Director of Brewing Services
 that the "formulations were proprietary" and that the difference between
 thier various extract products was "the addition of crystal malt and/or
 chocolate malt and/or black malt" and that the choice of ingredients was
 "determined by the style of beer that the extract was designed to produce."
 Not too informative, to say the least.  When I asked her if she was willing
 to tell me what I needed to know, she said that "she was being careful not
 to tell me details."  After a polite thank you, the conversation was over.
 I was very surprised.


 The extract products from Nothwestern Extract Company of Brookfield, WI
 are simply repackaged and/or redistributed Briess products.


 Briess, of course, distributes Product Information Sheets on their CBW
 (Concentrated Brewers Wort; i.e. extract) products that include "Typical
 Analytical Specifications."  Data from these sheets are summarized below:


                                                          lbs/

   (1) The color range given (Lovibond) is that which would be expected of the
       final beer provided: specified O.G. is used, 1 hour boil, no scorching.


   (2) The last three columns should be interpreted as follows:  The original
       gravity (O.G.) requires *approximately* X pounds of extract per gallon
       (lbs/gal.) and will ferment to a final gravity (F.G.) somewhere in the
       range indicated, where X is the lbs/gal. value from the table.


 Details?  Not really.  The Product Information Sheets state the obvious:
 the dark is darker than the amber which is darker than the gold and that
 they all ferment.  Oh, and the weisen extract contains wheat.


 I agree with Norm.  I would very much like to know more details about the
 production and formulation of extract products and I don't think that it is
 too much to ask.  I know that the collective HBD conciousness probably knows
 a great deal of this information.  I suspect that all sorts of details have
 been gleaned from conversations with more candid distributors and talkative
 company employees during tours, from articles, and from experience.

I wish I had known about this.  A researcher posted in alt.beer asking 
if it was possible to suggest a series of beers that were identical 
save for their bitterness level.  This sounds like it would have been 
the solution.


BTW, Carlo Fusco, who asked the original question, gave me an American 
IPA at 49 IBU that was outstanding.  It was not as bitter as I would 
have expected for 49 IBU (maybe that's why he was asking the question) 
but was full of hop flavour and aroma.  I hope he didn't ask the 
question to mess with his very wonderful recipe for this beer.

It sounds like Great Western is being foolish as well as wasteful.  I
toured Upper Canada Brewing here in Toronto.  They were very proud of
their water and energy conservation measures.  They used what seemed
to be a modified counter-flow system:  The hot wort and unheated water
for the next mash flowed through a heat exchanger that simultaneously
pre-heated the mash water and cooled the wort.  They claimed it was
extremely cost effective, saving both on water usage and energy costs.

I sent the following note to Karen Barela (AHA president), figuring it must
represent at least a few of us.


Dear Karen,


The latest issue of Zymurgy clearly is the foulest smelling magazine I have
ever smelled. I think it must be that mustard green insert. I start to
sneeze everytime I get near it! Once I get over the sneezing, headaches
start to set in. I sure hope you guys have a handle on the problem and don't
publish another issue like the last. I bet I'm not the first to comment on
this problem.
