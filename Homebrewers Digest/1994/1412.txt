Subject: Questions about pH throughout the Brewing Process




Hello,


I've been monitoring the HBD for sometime now and have noted a number
of entries discussing pH.  However, I have not been able to piece
together all of the information I am looking for.


I will be embarking on my second all-grain brew this this Saturday
(4/30/94) and will follow it up with an extract version on Sunday
(5/1/94).  Each time I make another batch I like to apply something new
that I have learned from the science of brewing.  However, chemistry
was never my strength and I'm having a bit of trouble with nailing down
target pH at various points of the all-grain/extract brewing process
and how to adjust the pH, if necessary.  I appreciate all responses.


First, some info for you.  We have well water which I have always
considered to be "hard".  When our water is boiled there is always a
white residue on our pots.  Ice from our refrigerator, well melted, has
a white precipitate.  Our water completely trashes our humidifier
leaving a white residue on the heating element and requires cleaning
once every 1 to 2 weeks.  I attribute this white substance to calcium
or mineral content, in general.


A water analysis was performed when we bought the house.  The quantity
of important elements was read as:


Units are in milligrams/liter except for pH.


        Calcium                         18.349
        Magnesium                   5.542
        Sodium                          95.154
        Zinc                            3.960
        Nitrate                            4.310
        Fluoride                    0.260
        Alkalinity                225.800
        Chloride                  10.510
        Hardness                  68.641
        pH                            7.060
        Corrosivity                    0.795
        Specific Conductance        512.000


Can anyone comment on this analysis??


I have available two substances: gypsum and calcium carbonate.  I plan
to use a 3 step infusion mash.  My questions are:


        1.) The mash pH should be 5.2?  What substance do I use to lower
            the pH of the mash?? gypsum or calcium carbonate? 
        2.) The mash will have three different temperatures 130, 150 and
            158-160 degrees F (I believe).  What should the pH be at
            each temperature?
        3.) Should I lower the pH (make more acidic) the sparge water?
            What should its pH be at 170 degrees F??  What do I use to
            lower the pH gypsum or calcium carbonate??
        4.) What should the pH of the boil be at the temperature of the
            boil??  Does this pH also apply to extract brewing?
        5.) What should the pH of the wort be when the wort is cooled
            and ready for yeast to be added??  Does this pH also apply
            to extract brewing?


All responses are deeply appreciated.  Direct email is welcome.

I know I have seen recipes for ROOT BEER go by in the past, but I neglected
to make note of them.  


I would appreciate recipes for root beer...the closer to "I.B.C." I can
get, the better...

Subject: SA Tripple Bock




   Mark Stickler in HBD #1409 found SA Tripple Bock to be port-like.


   I work with a guy who recently returned from a short trip to the
East Coast.  He took the Sammy Adams tour and said that they showed
the tour "a lot" of WOODEN kegs which were claimed to contain the
fabled Tripple Bock ("Samatorator?")  Apparently, the tour guide said
that SA had no plans to re-make the stuff because it was costing them
"over $100 a barrel" though I suppose if they can get $25 a short six
for it, then we'll see more.  Anyways, I just thought I'd relate the
aging in wood thing (I have no idea if they were lined or not).
Perhaps that has something to do with the sherry flavors he tasted?

 >From: Jim Busch <busch`at`daacdev1.stx.com>
 >Subject: Re: IM and the EasySparger
 
 >So, did you follow the advise to rehydrate it in advance of brewing?
 
 No, but not to be a crank, just didn't seem to make much sense as it sits in 
 the hot wort for several hours before the chiller is even turned.
 
 
 >>  Also, if Ulick is using Irish Moss, I can appreciate his frustration with 
 an  EASYMASHER....  it just plain won't work (as a crud filter that is).  I 
 never  said it would work with IM but it's nice to know these things.
 
 >Wow, sounds like an excellent argument for the SS perforated sheet false
 bottom, but I guess you need to deal with dinosaur vendors.....
 
 Just for the record, I received mail this morning from readers who routinely 
 use IM with EM's and have no trouble, so I am not sure where we are at.
 
 However, be it known that I never claimed that an EM was better, in all 
 respects, than a SS false bottom.  The advantages of the  EM are:
 
 * that it CAN be a single kettle all grain system
 
 * mashing and lautering are done in the same vessel requiring no transfer to 
 the lauter tun..
 
 * Virtually no re-cycling of wort is required to clear out the dead space
 
 * It is inexpensive and easy to use.
 
 >Seriously, I think what Jack has discovered is yet another reason why
 counterflow chillers are better than immersion, trub removal.  By combining
 both the hot and cold trub, and by optimizing your trub precipitation, you
 have overwhelmed the ability of your little home brewery to adequately
 remove the trub.
 
 I really do not understand what you are saying here... like, whose on first?
 
 >  If you had used a false bottom as a hop back, the surface
 area available to help seperate the hot trub would have kept most of the
 hot trub in the kettle.
 
 Again, if I used a false bottom and which chiller?
 
 I am at a loss as to how to respond to this but maybe that was your goal.
 
 But you know I will give it a try anyway.
 
 If I used a false bottom and the process I described, there is a chance that 
 the fb may not have clogged and therefore prove to be better than an EM for 
 IM.  My guess is that it may well have clogged anyway and can't imagine doing 
 a 2 hour boil with a false bottom in place.
 
 Now, if we switch to a counterflow chiller, there is no need for the false 
 bottom because we can simply suck all the crud through the chiller and let it 
 settle out later.   Furthermore, with a cf chiller, the EM may well have 
 worked anyway.
 
 So as I see it, you have made a tentative argument for one or the other but 
 not necessarily both and a judiciously placed syphon would have solved all 
 the problems in the first place.
 
 I would also be interested in knowing how many people use their false bottoms 
 in their brew kettle.

After seeing numerous articles posted regarding Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and the
ability to make a yeast culture from it, I decided to check into the feasabilit
y of doing a culture. So I go to the local beer mart and look at a bottle, and
I see no yeastie beasties laying about... So I talk to the local owner, who is
also a homebrewer, and he doesnt feel that there is any cultivatable yeast in t
he bottle. SO, the question is: Over here on the east side of Ol' Mississippi,
does the law still exist that we can get no beers that have not been pasteurize
d ( like Coors used to be (?)) or is the yeast I am interested in culturing inv
isible to the eye. There is absolutely no sediment in the bottles I looked at.
E-Mail responses are fine, I will summarize.

Subject: Looking for Owades Paper


Here's one for my fellow old-timers:


Five, six, maybe seven years ago (perhaps at the Estes Park conference)
I recall being shown a copy of an article or transcript of a talk that
Joe Owades gave about designing Sam Adams Pittsburgh Lager.  It included
a technical discussion of the recipe as well as a market analysis.  I
have been trying to track it down with no success.  Other folks recall
the paper too, but no one can remember where it came from.  If you have
any leads, please let me know.

From: "Brian Thorn" <bthorn`at`nmsu.edu>
Subject: re: Homebrewing and Water Usage


I have to agree with Rich Webb.


We all should be conscious of conserving water where possible.  Homebrewing
IS a very water intensive process.  It may be cheap for most of us, but IMHO
we should treat it otherwise.  In So. Cal. and metro Ariz. much of the
municipal water comes via canal from 100's of miles away.  I live in So. New
Mexico where it seems like it never rains.  It's easy to be consious of
water use for that reason, even though I pay about $1.00 for 2000 gallons.


I have not purchased a wort chiller simply because I was concerned about
wasting the water (the food grade plastic bottles with ice have worked
relatively well for me).  Now that the creative input of the great HBD
brain has caused me to see the light, I think I'll part with the cash and
take one more step on that great stairway toward *PERFECT* (or is that
DIVINE) beer.
Cheers,

Subject: Kegging systems, and beer trading in DC Area


  I am new to the HB list, and found the first distribution interesting
and helpful.  Not wanting to sit on the side-lines, I was hoping to
find advice on putting together a home kegging system, since the
most tedious task in the HB process (for me anyway) is cleaning, sterilizing,
bottle capping, and filling beer bottles.  I am interested in determining
several things:
  * Material parts list for putting together a 5 gallon system
    (such as Kornielius)
  * Disadvantages of kegging versus bottling in beer quality
  * Suppliers of CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP, did I say, CHEAP, kegging supplies
    (yes, I am even soliciting to buy equipment from other
      home brewers who may have an extra keg or two laying around
      gathering dust).
  Thank you in advance for the information.  I am also interested in
finding other home brewers who may be interested in exchanging brews (you
give me a bottle, I give you a bottle) in the DC Metropolitan area.


    Thanks,
    Mark R. (Olney, MD)

I've got one warning -- be absolutly sure which wall has the cooling

Subject: COYOTE's Cool Question


Jim the Coyote asked about building a box for refrigeration (God, I hope I
spelled that right).  In the past I've sent direct e-mail to folks when I've
seen this question, but what the heck, maybe there are more people
interested.


There is a good how-to/why-to book called How and Why to Build a Wine
Cellar.  It provides an excellent intro on how to construct a variety of
temperature-controlled environments, using air conditioners, thermal sinks,
water cooling, etc.  It also discusses topics such as humidity and
condensation in such conatrction/fabrication.  


In that wine cellars are typically targetted for 40-55F with a humidity
<80%, I think that this book would give anyone enough of the ground rules so
that they could engineer a brewing-capable equivalent.


Usual disclaimer... and aside from looking through an issue of the Wine
Spectator or going to a really good wine shop, I'm not sure where you can
find a copy.

I do get Johns humor but I guess I should correct myself.It should have
said GRAMS.  40 grams per 5 gal.  I did the experiment with 4 kegs, each

    I brewed a strong Scotch ale with this yeast(1728) recently. The beer was
fermented at 60-62F, and racked to secondary 8 days after pitching, so I don't
think fusel alcohols should be an issue.  This past Tuesday, the 26th, I
kegged the beer.  I ended up with slightly over 5 gallons, for after filling
the keg, there was enough beer left over to fill a large glass, about 10
ounces or so.  Since I hate to waste homebrew, I drank it.  Hey, even flat,
green homebrew from the fermenter is infinitely better than BudMilloors.
This 10 ounces was the only beer I consumed that evening.
    Next day, I experienced a similar effect to what Rich reported, I was
kind of out of it all morning.  I had a terrible time concentrating at work.
I did not experience any bad aftertaste.  I had recently recovered from
a severe headcold, so I attributed the feeling to being run down, didn't
pay it too much attention at the time.  Reading Rich's post has makes me
wonder about this, anyone else that's used this yeast experience this?

Wyeast's 1968 London ESB strain is highly-flocculant, with an apparent
attenuation of 67-71%.  They caution that "this strain is so flocculant
that additional aeration and agitation is needed."  My own experience
with it has been excellent, and I continue to use it in the sure
knowledge that I will get a nice malty finish and some light diacetyl.
But it's possible that under cool conditions the yeast would flocculate
so quickly that a fairly high diacetyl level would be reached.  I would
suggest that rousing it several times during fermentation is not a bad
idea.  And do be sure that it gets a definite diacetyl rest.

A question for the group...I recently made a batch of C. Papazian's Rocky
Racoon Honey Lager and figured this might be a good batch to try dry hooping
with.  I fermented for a week in the primary, racked to the carboy and added a
"tea" made from a cup of previously boiled water and 1/2 oz of Cascade
pellets. After allowing it to finish (18 days), I decided to bottle last
night. When I pulled the airlock to rack to the bottling bucket, I got a
strong sulfur smell from the carboy; not overwealming, but noticable.  I'm
fairly sure that the beer was not light struck (I lagered in the same dark
corner of my basement that I always use)...any ideas what might have happened?
 Could it come from the hops?  Can this beer be saved? (I bottled it anyway,
hoping that the smell will age out :) Any advice would be appreciated...

Subject: Coleman Coolers for mashing


Hi all,
I am currently in the process of acquiring the equipment
for all-grain brewing.  I've been searching high and low
for the fabled 10 gallon Gott "tower of power" at local
(Baltimore) retail establishments.  This is starting to
turn into the Holy Grail for me - I cannot find one anywhere.
I did find a 10 gallon Coleman water "jug" which is shaped
like the "tower of power" only square instead of circular.
The problem is that in the info that came with this jug, under
"Helpful Hints", I see "DO NOT USE JUGS AS CONTAINERS FOR HOT
LIQUIDS. Jugs perform best when used with ice to keep things
cold."  Intrigued, I called the 1-800 number for Coleman.  The
person I spoke to said the same thing as the "Tip."  When I
asked him about any possible problems with putting hot liquid
in the jug, he got evasive, and just reiterated their 
recommendation.


This 10 gallon "jug" was considerably cheaper than the prices
I have seen here in the HBD for the elusive, perhaps mythical
Gott "tower of power": $29.95 for the Coleman.  My question:
are there any nasty side effects of using coolers intended
only for cold liquids as mash and lauter tuns?  Will the 
plastic break down and leech into my wort?  Should I take the
10 gallon Coleman "jug" back and continue my quest for the
Gott cooler?

Last summer, the local firefighters came around offering safety 
inspections.  We discovered that it is quite dangerous and, in our
municipality illegal, to store a propane tank indoors or in the
garage.  A 20# tank has enough energy to destroy half our house.
They should be stored in the open.


Also, don't do what my parents did -- they spray painted the tank 
black so it would blend in with the barbeque.  This encouraged the 
tank to absord the energy of the sunlight, heating the tank and 
forcing the gas to leak.  It was estimated that they were losing about 
half their gas during the peak of summer.


Most propane dealers have literature and even videos on the safe use 
of propane.

Subject: Extracts Again




The question of malt extract composition has come up with some
regularity over the years, but I must say that I was flabbergasted
to see Norman Farrel post this in HOMEBREW Digest #1411:

The AHA sells 7 full-color pages of ads in every Zymurgy issue, and
six of them are generally bought by purveyors of extracts.  That
fact alone has long caused me to doubt that they'd ever seriously
address the extract question, and the fact that they'd even go
this far surprises me greatly.  By turning the preparation of the
worts over to a homebrew club, though, they've created the possibility
for enough inconsistency for the makers of the extracts to later
claim that the results aren't valid.  Before your club runs the
test I suggest you get a copy of the Paik, Low, Ingledew et al.
study, "Malt Extract:  Relationship of Chemical Composition to
Fermentability," Journal of the American Soc. of Brewing Chemists,
Vol. 49, 1991.  The methods described there assure a very high
degree of consistency.


Many lines further down, Edward C. Bronson (in an excellent posting!)
described calling Briess and speaking to someone I believe from the
context to have been Mary Anne Gruber:

I'm much less so.  Extract producers have never been candid about what's
in the stuff they sell, though I would imagine that they treat very
large-volume purchasers somewhat differently from pub-brewers and
homebrewers.  My article on the subject in Brewing Techniques ("Malt 
Extracts:  Cause for Caution," V. I, No. 2, July/August 1993), which 
draws heavily from the study cited above, shows that at least some
of them actually have something to hide, and it's my suspicion that
in one way or another, all of them do.  The assumption I started
with, that extracts are simply concentrated worts, is apparently
more than a little questionable.  I'm glad to see this question
come up, and I hope it leads to the sort of pressure that will cause
extract producers to clean up their act, just as yeast producers have.

In the low- water usage cooling system discussion:


        What I used to do was to have a bucket of ice water with spigot
placed on top of my fridge. This would run (via gravity) through 50 ft of 1/4"
copper tubing and collected the water into 5 gallon jugs.  The water could
be used for plants, topping up fish tanks, or simply saved for the next
brewing session. I used a bag or two of ice ($2/brew session or make your own)  
           It usually took about 2-3 buckets to bring 10 gallons down to comfy
pitching temp.  The other addition was to have 20 ft of 3/8" copper tubing
in a bucket of ice water. When the warmed wort was racked from the pot to
carboys it was racked THROUGH the 2nd stage cooler and I was able to bring
the wort down to lagering temps in about a half hour total cooling.


        I tend to keep chloring solutions around, and add a little fresh

MOVING HOPS:
        If they shoots are still fairly small, you're doing ok (under a foot
say).  You can dig them up- just dig a bigger hole than you think you'll need.
You will most certainly take out some roots in the process, but they will
survive a bit of root pruning without too much harm.
        I feel I've passed the point of safely transplanting mine. They are
about chest high on their stringers now, so I'll be moving cuttings, and my
new rhizomes to the new pad, and letting these remain. I've arranged to share
the harvest with the tenants.  I'm also probably gonna have someone move into
my apartment (when I move out) who is an avid -fairly- new brewer. The tenant
downstairs seemed to favor the idea when he learned the new guy has a kegging
setup- so when I move mine the house will not lose the capability.
Also- that way I can come back and fondly the cones, and share a brew with the
occupants once in a while!


        I have decided that rooting cuttings in water first, then planting
in soil is more effective than just sticking them in dirt. I have had both
work, but MUCH better success rate with liquid rooting first.  FWIW.

I've got my first use of a Kolsh yeast underway.  Pardon my ignorance, but

I've used.  I still don't have a good example of a Kolsh recipe. I just went
for pale malt, and some crystal. (touch of biscuit)  The only recipe I found
was Millers (2nd book) but was extract based so I don't know what REALLY in it!


Any tried and true Kolsh recipes? Experience with the yeast?
I haven't tried a Kolsh beer to my knowledge, so I'm not sure what the style
description involves. Any info?                  'Preciate it pals!

barneywine, and might have the potency to start making you see purple dino-s.
My Barneywine was reported to have put a whiskey drinking insomniac to sleep
for the night.  That was flattering!  Seems like a powerful effect to me!
(did you hear? Barney can't sing "I love you, you love me..blah blah blah"!)


But if you're scotch ale had only an OG of 1.06-  well, maybe it's not that 
potent.  Try one a wee-heavier ...say in the 90's, then we'll KNOW!


But really- Hops are know to induce sleep.  You can drink a hop tea, or stuff
a pillow with hops to help insomnia- I mean to reduce, eliminate...make sleep!
You can calm a colichy baby by running a vaccuum, cure a headache by massaging
your thumb/palm.  These and more home-remedies are included in my book...
"How to make lots of money off of gullible TV watchers"  (Copywrite:Time Strife)


But really:  Check an herb book and they discuss the "medicinal" value of hops


As for the dragon breath:  Chew some parsley before going to bed.
Don't smoke cigars with your homebrew.  Brush your teeth. Keep a bottle of
Scope by the bedside. (and a spitoon)


In actuality: bad breath is caused by bacteria literally rotting in your
mouth.  They consume sugars and produce acid. Some of the products of 
their "fermentations" cause rancid smells. Halitosis is more likely after
a nights sleep when your salivary action has been at a minimum. THe natural
brushing of your tongue and gums, and flush of saliva tents to reduce bacterial
populations.  You can be tested for Dental Caries Susceptibility (acid prodtn)
Brushing with a baking soda toothpaste can reduce the acidity, and inhibit the
buggers. It's probably more likely that residual beer sugars are responsible
than yeast. Plus- excess drinking (common with yummy scotch's) will allow
alcohol vapor from the lungs to migrate through the nasal and oral canals.
Perhaps there are some hop-aroma components that also exit in vapor form.

Maggie the Dust Mite Mama would feel about the above story?   Imaging Joel
expaining it to her?  Nyuck- Nyuck- Nycuck.    No bedtime for Bonzo!


(FWIW: I enjoy a good cigar once in a while, but find them to interfere with
my homebrew enjoyment.  All I smell is the cigar aroma from my moustache,
rather than the rich hop aroma from my homebrews.  Oh well, every vice has its
downfall.  Even sex is supposed to kill brain cells.  Oh darn...)

I got this reply from Karen regarding the smell of the lastest issue of
Zymurgy. Sounds like they are aware of the problem.

Subject: Extract based oatmeal stout/Czech pils yeast update


I know that it has been a while since the question was asked but
William's Brewing makes an "Oatmeal Dark" extract if you want to make an
oatmeal stout without mashing.  It is $13.90 for 6 lbs of syrup (I
think).  I used it last summer and was very pleased.


*******************


Earlier I mentioned that I had a starter going from Wyeast's new Czech
Pils yeast that did not seem to flocculate well and produced a lot of
diacetyl.  Well, it seems that my starter temp was too high.  I
fermented a lager at 47^F and it did very well.  It has also packed down
better in the bottle than I was expecting.  I made two batches of Dave
Miller's "Bohemian Pilsner" from "Continental Pilsner";  I fermented one
with Wyeast Bavarian Lager and one with the Czech Lager.  It seems that
the Czech yeast likes the colder temps better; it conditioned much
faster at 47^F.  I am quite pleased with it.  Now I'll have to see if my
palate can tell the difference!
