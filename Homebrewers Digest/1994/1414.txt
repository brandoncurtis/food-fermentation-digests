Subject: The size of the homebrew market?




Hello Folks,
I just found this homebrew usergroup on the Internet and I'm hoping that
someone out there can help me quantify the size of the domestic(U.S.)
homebrew market.


I've already contacted the American Homebrewers Association, and they 
were marginally helpful(telling me they had 22,000 current members).  Yet
they weren't able to give me concrete info on the size of the market, 
either in terms to total homebrewers or in terms of dollar revenue.  I also
spoke to the Beer Institute in Washington, but they were no help.


Anybody out have suggestions concerning where I might be able to get that 
type of information?  I have received some of the market research results
that ZYMURGY conducts, but this hasn't helped me quantify the size of the
market.  Especially the growth of "newbie" brewers.  I've working on a graduate
school project and running out of time...hopefully someone out there on the
Net has some suggestions.


Thanks In Advance

Hi - I was thinking of brewing a chocolate all-malt stout - something along
the lines of 3kg of dark malt extract and some unsweetened cocoa.  However
I would like to have some sweetness in the bottled product.  What's the best
way of achieving this result?  The sweetness will have to survive some
months in the bottle, and I don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners
such as saccharin or nutrasweet (phenylalanine).  What do you folks reckon?

Subject: Spring Water ph/hardness




  
        Just a little experience Id like to share from this weekend.


        My grains were happily mashing along and I thought Id just for the heck 
        of it check the ph and hardness of the spring water I used. I have to
        buy it cause our water is so bad... anyway, the last time I tested the
        supposed SW, it showed a ph of 6 and a hardness of over 200ppm, this was
        last winter, and i thought great! At $.50 a gallon this will be great   
        for ales. (BTW I use two aquarium water test kits) To cut to the chase -
        the new SW tests ph~8(alkaline) and hardness~50ppm(very soft). Much     
        different than the last batch.
        
        So the moral of this little story is DONT assume your really getting    
        spring water of the same quality, or type this week as you did last     
        week. I basically bought tap water, da.


        The only thing I could do was add crystals to the sparge water and hope 
        for the best.

Can anyone give me any info using a Party Pig.  I got one for my birthday and
I'm wondering how well it works.  Can anyone give me tips on how to use it.
One question I have do you let the beer carbonate in the pig on the shelf 
first or just put beer in it and chill, age and drink?  Yes I know you have to 
buy a new bag each time you use it.  Any feedback from users would be nice. 
One more question what is the recipe for using chlorine for sanitizing. 
 I use B-Bright and the directions say I can't use the suff that's in 
B-Bright to clean the pig, so I need to use chlorine to clean it.
Thanks Todd.......

Does any one really use these damn things?
I have just started mashing and find it impossible to make sense of these
strips. Since I'm not confident with the readings, I haven't treated my water
at all. (I got 28 point extraction on my first mash w/ 2/3 wheat)
My buddy, who still remembers the chemistry I've forgotten, says the test
strips are next to worthless because they are only about 30% accurate.

Thanks to all for their rapid responses. To summarize: it appears that it is ei
ther A) I didnt look hard enough for the dregs, or B) it appears that the quant
ity of dregs varies somewhere between just a haze at the bottom of the bottle a
nd noticeably visible dregs at the bottom. Yes, dregs have been sighted east of
 the Ol' Missisippi. So that only leaves one question ( thought there was only

I think you ignoring the reasons to rehydrate the IM.  Lets review....  


Hydrate: A chemical compound that contains water combined in a definite ratio,
the water being retained or regarded as being retained in its molecular state. 
American Heritage Dictionary, 1981. 


Seems to me rather obvious that different chemical reactions are going to
occur when adding water to a solute as opposed to adding wort containing
all kinds of things (and at a vastly different pH) to the same solute.  Not
to mention the effects of different temperatures as they relate to 
chemical equilibriums.  Temperature, pH and water can be powerful catalysts.

Either, albeit i am suggesting a counterflow. A immersion even strengthens
my point, you are adding 1/3rd more trub when you use immersion, since 
both the hot and cold trub are in the same kettle.  More break necessitates
more surface area to prevent clogging.

Not two hours, just 90 minutes :-)  Lets review, open area for FBs: great,
open area for EM, small.  Or in other terms, how many tiny perf sheet holes
fit into one EM?

Woooowwww, Nelly!  No, no ,no.  Regardless of the chiller methods, practical
brewers remove the hot trub in the kettle.  You dont want this stuff sitting
around on your wort any longer than possible.  Its the cold trub that can
be racked off or left as is. Not too mention that without a FB, the hops 
would horribly clog any counterflow chiller.  FBs are great hop backs, they
work just fine in a boiling kettle, and they offer the advantage of helping
in trub removal.  The only "problem" is to remember to put the FB in prior
to the first hop addition.  BTW, I cant see why anyone would want to hang
around or come back in the morning just to rack wort off of trub that could
easily be left in the kettle, this hobby is enough work as it is.

Syphon?  What about the EM?  I thought this is what you posted, a clogged EM.

I sure do.  Great hop backs.  Just use the brew paddle to help sink the
bottom when you are moving it from the lauter tun into the kettle (after
cleaning it of course).

I am a relatively new brewer and would appreciate any advice about bottling

use malt!" I will graciously bow to popular opinion. ;)

Subject: HELP - cheesy beer




Yesterday (5/1) I brewed an all-grain pale ale. In 20+ years of 
brewing I have *never* seen the likes of this.


The recipe (5 gal) was simply 8 pounds of pale ale and 1 pound of 
crystal, 32 IBU's, OG 1.062. The only difference from my standard 
recipe was that the pale ale was Belgian vs. the usual English.


After chilling I racked to a santized carboy, sealed and let stand 
for a couple of hours for the hot and cold break to settle out, my 
standard proceedure. After two hours the break had fallen out and I 
racked off of it. I pitched the yeast and aerated. The yeast was 
Wyeast 1056, a fresh pack, in 1 quart of 1.040 starter, at high 
krausen.


I aerated by pouring back and forth between two carboys through a 
funnel, shaking each carboy vigorously when they were 1/4 full. The 
only departure from my usually overzealous sanitation routine was 
that I aerated the wort at the location where I had ground the 
grain. I attached a blowoff tube, covered the the carboy, and left 
with a 4" cap of foam on top of the wort.


I returned about four hours later expecting to find full active 
fermentation in effect. The blowoff tube was blowing CO2, but when I 
uncovered the carboy there was no cap of foam. There was only a 
thin (approximately 1/4") layer of "cheesy" brown looking stuff on 
top. When I looker closer I remember thinking, "My God, there's a 
mother growing in my beer!." By *mother* I refer to the growth 
that you sometimes find in vinegar. Hanging under this cheesy layer 
was a convoluted growth, almost flower-like, growing down from the 
cap. It was about 1.5" long and about an inch in diameter. There must 
have been a lot more of these because when I swirled the carboy the 
cap and growths broke up into about a million pea-sized pieces of 
curd that swirled all through my precious beer.


Half of these pieces re-formed a cap on top of the wort and half 
fell to the bottom. This stuff looks like cheese curd. It looks like 
the stuff you see when you pour lemon juice in milk.


There were no abnormal smells. There was no yeast floculant.


This morning I looked at it again. Normal fermentation. Capped by 3" 
of foam with the cheesy stuff on top. Smells ok, minimal 
floculation. Blowing CO2, about once every 3 seconds, out a 1 1/4" 
blowoff tube.


Ok folks, what is it? Could it be a "spontaneous" brettanomyces 
innoculation caused by aerating where I ground my grain? If it is, 
what's it going to be, considering the grains, hop levels, and most 
of all, the yeast used?  Does anyone KNOW what this is?


TIA,

From: Bill Sutton <wrs`at`hpuerca.atl.hp.com>
Subject: H2S "problem" outcome / kit yeasts


Some weeks ago I posted a question about the strong H2S smell I got from
the Glenbrew Secret Brewer's Yeast. I took my May Beer to its destination
celebration on Saturday night, and ...


It was simply the best beer I've ever made, and well in the top 10 beers
I've ever had!


It was beautifully clear (no chill haze!), head retention to die for
(we left one to settle and the head was still thick 15 minutes later, at
which point we couldn't stand the wait any longer and drank it), pleasant
hop aroma and a hint of apple taste (expected due to the addition of that 
traditional spring herb woodruff), and a very light mouthfeel (which is
what I was shooting for) ...


OK, so it was only my 3rd batch, the first made with non-kit yeast, and I'm
easily impressed, but it certainly met all my expectations.


I changed a number of things in my brewing process, so I'm posting the recipe
and method just so I can comment on the changes I made and the worries I had.


   1 can Alexander's Sun Country Pale extract (3.3 lb, I think)
   2 oz Willamette hops
   3 lb clover honey
   1 cup dried woodruff
   water to 5 gallons


Boil extract, honey and 1 oz hop pellets 45 minutes. TURN OFF HEAT (new     
method for me, see below), add remaining hops and woodruff. Steep for 15
minutes. Temperature at end of steep ~180 degrees F.


Rehydrate Glenbrew Secret Brewer's yeast in 2 cups wort. Chilled wort by    
immersing brewpot in cold water - 85 degrees F after 30 minutes. OG 1.042.


Pitched yeast when foam formed on starter. Primary fermentation 1 week
in plastic bucket. SG at end of primary - 1.008. Racked to glass carboy
for secondary, 2 weeks. FG - 1.003. Primed with 3/4 cup brewer's sugar.


Worries:


   1) Primary fermentation created a STRONG H2S smell that dissipated
      after 3 days. Little smell when racked to secondary. Worried me
      enough that I posted to the HBD. I was told RDWHAHB.


   2) Tasting at rack to secondary revealed an almost overpowering
      sweetness from the woodruff (and I had thought 1 cup for 5 gallons
      wouldn't be enough!). Taste at bottling was still strong, but it
      had mellowed somewhat.


   3) I had bottled with sugar rather than malt extract this time, because
      I wanted the beer to be very light and springlike. After the beer was
      in the bottle for 2 weeks I tasted it - there was the "classic"
      sugar-primed cider feel - uh oh! It was a little confusing, because
      woodruff does have an apple-like flavor, so I didn't quite panic.
      I went back upstairs, poured myself an IPA, and hoped.


Changes in my process:


   1) If boiling releases all the hop aromas, why do we add finshing hops
      during the boil (I know, there's always dry hopping, but I'm
      taking this one step at a time). With all the discussion in the
      digest about steeping specialty grains rather than boiling them,
      I thought "why not steep my specialty herbs?" I think it worked out
      EXTREMELY well, so I will keep experimenting with it.


   2) I actively chilled my wort. No high-tech method or speed chill here,
      and since I pour my wort through a strainer to the primary, the cold
      break settling wasn't really going to be helpful anyway. However,
      it certainly made things a lot faster (I used to just let the wort
      sit for an hour or so.)


   3) I racked to secondary more out of necessity than desire, as I was
      going to be out of town for 2 weeks after the first week of
      fermentation. After the strong H2S from the primary, I had no
      desire to leave the beer on the trub any longer than I had to.
      I don't know, but I think this was the prime contributor to the
      clarity of the beer (sediment wise). I am now a firm believer in
      the secondary!


The other change brings me to the second topic. I had always used the kit
yeast before, and this was the first time I used a purchased yeast. After
bottling this batch, I made a yorkshire bitter with the kit yeast and
once again seemed to have lackluster fermentation (this time stopping at
an SG of 1.022!). Why are the kit yeasts (I say kit yeast, but it is just
the standard M&F dry yeast) so lousy?


I like using dry yeast, it is much more convenient and easier to pitch.
Are there any other good dry yeasts I should check into? I have the yeast
of Zymurgy, but time has passed since then.


I wanted to post this as a "thank you" to the hbd for the advice I've
gotten (both directly and indirectly).

 ***
 Joan (who I haven't seen much of here) has called for the HBD to be split
 into two digests:  One for extract one for all-grain, so she doesn't have
 to read so much.  (sorry,  I don't mean to flame here, just rubbed me wrong).
 
 Ok:  so...where do we put irish moss discussions?  Are brewpub requests to
 be split into extract vs allgrain brewpub requests?  How about cookers?
 Suppliers who sell only extracts, vs only all grain suppliers? 
 Where does the cross-over equipment go?
 
 Basically:  There's no way that's gonna happen. Some extracters might never
 make the so-worth-while- move to allgrain if they didn't have people like
 me around harrassing/ antagonizing them into it. Plus where would those
 debates take place?!  Theres FAR too much common ground to cover, plus
 it's just not practical.  I'd want to see what the extracters where trying>
 to pass off, so they could be kept honest, and correct!  Plus I'd want to
 participate in the on going all-grain gadget quest!                      
 
 An Honest suggestion:  Try REC.CRAFTS.BREWING where you can more easily
 read one message at a time, plus have access to HBD when you want.
 If you don't have access to NEWS  we...what can I say....but....ts.
 
Just my 2c on the thought. Your opinion may, and will vary. But I'd be 
 willing to wager the free maltmill that Jack's gonna send me (right arf!!! :)
 that I'm right about this one.
 
 ***    Oh reminded me of the Pilsner Pour from Jacks video.  That was COOL.

  While moving our office from Orlando to Charlotte over the weekend, my
  partner in beer hunting and I had the chance to run up to Boone, NC to
  Kinney Baughman's establishment.  Unfortunately, Kinney was not in but
  we didn't let that stop us from enjoying the place.  The Southwestern
  menu was extensive and the food was great.  Great atmosphere too!  Oh
  yes, the beer.  VERY good.  I had the Porter, the Gold Ale, and the Steam
  beer - all of which were quite good.  I found the Porter a bit sweeter than
  what I was used to (Anchor, Sierra Nevada, Yuengling) but still good.  The
  joint was jumping as they say and people were lined up outside to get a
  seat (Saturday evening).  Hell, I even bought a T-Shirt.  To Kinney I say
  "Great Job, Great Place!" and to the HBD at large I highly recommend the
  trip to Boone if you are even remotely in the area.  It's a beautiful drive
  up into the Smokies to get there.  I will most definitely become a regular.
  Hope to catch you in next time Kinney!

Subject: Wasted space & partioning the digest


I think that we might be missing the point on the question
of breaking the HBD into parts to customize the information
for the different levels of experience or technique.


The real sectioning of the HBD should be around the
Brew Information / Non-Brew Information fault line.
You may know what I mean. It seems that a lot of the
text that I receive via the HBD has very little to do
with beer, and a lot to do with the egos of the persons
sending it.


You said this about me. That's not what I meant, and you
know it. Your mamma is one too. Don't talk about my mamma
like that you %^*&*^^&*%)(*&())(*&%$%^&* (Tm) and so on. It gets
so tedious.


It's too bad that there can't be some sort of text
recognition program that scores the posts for some
sort of content quota. If the score leans towards the
informational side, it gets allowed into the HBD. If it's
just a continuation of a seven year mutual flame session,
it gets redirected towards the person who is intended
to be flamed, and spares the rest of us from having to
sit in on your arguements. If you want to have some sort
of fight over the net, do so privately. I don't mind
debate, but a lot of this stuff is simply juvenile.


There. That is as much space as I feel like wasting.
The problem with complaining about the signal to noise
ratio is that the complaint only serves to increase
the noise content of the signal. Damn...

Regarding brass and SS together, there have been discussions about the
electrolytic actions here before, and I refer you to those.  Strongly
suggest using a SS nipple.  It is no harder to solder SS to SS than
brass to SS.


Regarding soldering SS to anything, yes, silver solder is what you
want to use.  Yes, a butane torch is *plenty* hot, in fact, you want
to carefully watch to not get it too hot.  Use good flux meant for
silver solder.  Be extremely careful to have all surfaces extremely
clean.  Do not use steel wire brushes of any kind, nor any abrasives
which have previously been used on steel.  Apply flux liberally.  Use
as little heat as possible to just barely melt the solder.  Once the
solder flows remove the heat immediately and cool the area with wet
rags immediately.  If you think the solder is not flowing correctly
because you are not applying enough heat, and you apply more heat, 95%
of the time you will be completely wrong.  Improper flowing is most
usually due to having improperly cleaned, improperly fluxed, or
overheating causing oxidation.


WARNING!!  Prolonged heating or overheating of SS will cause severe
embrittlement to occur.  You can literally shatter SS with hammer tap
if it has been overheated.

Hello Again!!!


I want to thank all who responded.  Unforunately, I did not get your
responses before I left for the weekend but I did manage to get through
it all.  


I have not read all of your responses, but a quick browsing as indicated
the Dave Miller book "The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing".  I did
manage to pick this up before the weekend (on the suggestion of the
local brewshop) but I could only implement what I was reading on the
fly.  I will need to sit down review all the responses and post results
on the HBD.


When I have results from the brewing process this past weekend, I will
also share these with everyone on the HBD.  I did try to correct
(minimally) the pH of my water, but hesitated to do too much for fear
of messing with something I really don't understand well enough.  I
hope the recipe works - an Apple Honey Ale.  At least it smells great
throught the water trap.


I'm really grateful for the number of responses - Thanks!

Subject: Re: Duster's In Lawton MI


In #1413, Ulick Stafford mentioned a brewpub called Duster's in Lawton, MI.


You're right that Dusters doesn't sell food, but they will let you bring food
in (at least at the moment).  So order your favorite pizza, and dring
microbrew while you wait for it to arrive.


I was there a couple of weeks ago (I live just south of Kalamazoo) and must
admit I didn't care too much for the wheat beer.  They have since added a
root beer, which by all accounts is just great.


I really hope they make it, but from a business stand point I have my doubts.
 They have limited seating (about 12 - 14 tables as I recall) and I can't see
them making money without serving food.  It's easy to tie up a table for a
couple of hours for only $25 and the cover charge ($3 each).  They're just
far enough outside the city to make people think twice about driving all that
way just for a beer.  They don't help matters either by not naming they're
beers.  When I went there we were informed they had three beers, wheat, red and
brown--hardly inspiring.


I know, I know, everyone's a critic!  Their biggest plusses--a really cute
town, and a beautiful brick building, with copper-topped tables and fixtures.
 The jazz was good too.  If anyone is interested, their number is (616)
624-3771.  (standard disclaimer, blah, blah, blah)


By the way, the bar/resturaunt across the street is called Big T's, does
indeed have 180 or so beers, and some great food.

I need a quick crash course in plaxnting hops.  Just the first few weeks of
preparation and care--after that I'll have the books I need.


First off: I know it's late to be planting hops here in southwest Michigan.


I wanted to plant hops last year, but didn't have the space.  I gave up on
the idea this year to for the same reason.  The other day the (soon-to-be)
inlaws  told me I'm welcome to plant them behind their new building, so I'm
ready to go.


I bought some rhizomes this afternoon at the local brewery and supply store
(Kalamazoo Brewing Company), but they didn't have any of the books on growing
hops.


If anyone can give any advice here it would be much appreciated.  In
particular:


1.  Do I need anything to bring these guys back to life (Nugget and Fuggles).
2.  How do I prepare and fertilize the ground, and how deep do I plant them.
3.  Rooting powder?  Plant horizontal or vertical?
4.  Any other details that will tide me over until I order the books I need. 
Which books are the best?


I know some of the information has been discussed in recent months, so in the
interest of bandwith, private e-mail is preferred.  I will post a summary if
requested.


As always:  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Temperature control


Thanks to all that replied to my request for sources of Hunter Airstats.
After thinking a while about temperature control, I decided I would build
another temp controller similar to the one I have been using on another
frig. This controller is made up of a Honeywell temperature control with a
range of -30 to 90 def f. It has a setable temperature differential and a
single pole double throw switch. One contract is closed on temperature rise
and the other is closed on temperature fall. With the addition of another
single pole double throw toggle switch and a heater it is possible to build
a controller that will control heat in the winter and cold in the summer. I
use a 650watt glo coil heater and place it in the frig. The thermostat costs
about $30 at Graingers and the heater about $6. The schematic is pretty
simple, but I ain't too good at ascii graphics.


In my opinion, the requirement to control the temperature up or down in very
important. It is true that fermentation is exothermic, however it has been
my experience that the heat generated is inaddequate to maintain the
fermentation to the desired temperature all the time, especially in the winter.


Thanks again for all the suggestions on sources for the Airstat, seems the
general concensus was to look hard and consistantly at Home Depots. They are
there to be had.

Subject: Where Do You Ferment Ales?


I`m curious about the environments where homebrewers ferment their beers,
particularly ales.  I`m particularly interested in how much effort goes into
controlling temperature, exposure to light, and other environmental factors.


I got to thinking about this over the weekend, when I realized that the air
temperature in my basement was a bit too cold for the ale yeast that I intended
to pitch in a brown ale that I had just finished boiling.  I ended up placing
the fermenters in my upstairs bathroom, where the temperatures are better for
the yeast, but the wort will be exposed to more sun light.  A quick review of
my brewing library revealed very little on this topic.

COYOTE requested a review of Uinta so here is one.


It is actually not a brewpub but a brewery. They distribute their beer to
several local bars, pubs and clubs. They do have growlers to go at the
brewery (389 W. 1700 S.) and at $5.00 a fill (1/2 gal) it is a good deal
in these parts. The growler jug itself is $3.00 and refillable. They will
fill other growlers (eg: Squater's, Red Rock) but prefer to fill their own.


They are brewing 3 beers right now: extra pale ale, porter and
hefe-weizen. They are very decent brews and all quite hoppy - even the
hefe-weizen. I would have prefered less hops in it but it was only their
first batch. They are planing another wheat beer but it will be filtered.
I'll keep you posted.
