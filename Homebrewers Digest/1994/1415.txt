Subject: Metals usage in Brewing


Hello Group,
In response to yesterdays post by Terry for welding/Joining info and other 
current issues concerning our brewing metals, I offer the following 
compilation on zymurgical metallurgy.


*Steel*
The stainless steel most used for Food related applications is an austenitic 
stainless, 304.  304 is non-magnetic, weldable, and used extensively for kegs. 


The stainless used for Good pots (like Vollrath) is usually also 304.  Other 
stainless kitchen stuff, like utensils and some pots, will be ferritic
stainless, 
which does not have Nickel in it (or not much) and is less acid-neutral.


What makes a steel Stainless?
The alloying addition of Chromium (and Nickel) create a significant 
percentage of those atoms at the surface, where they form tenacious oxides 
which seal the surface and prevent further oxidation. Anodizing Aluminum 
alloys is the same idea, creating a solid aluminum oxide barrier to further 
corrosion. Anodized (black) aluminum cookware, (Magnalite, Calphalon) is 
acid neutral / acidic food resistant, like stainless steel, because of this
heavy 
oxide layer.  Plain (bright) aluminum cookware does not have the degree of 
surface oxides necessary to prevent reaction with acids.


*Brass*
Brass is an alloy of Copper and Zinc with some lead thrown in for 
machinability. The lead percentage varies, but for the common brass alloys 
found in hardware stores, it is 7% or less.  Lead is entirely soluble in 
Copper.  Therefore it does not have a high propensity for leaching out of 
brass.  Jack Scmidling posted yesterday about the lab results on beer made 
with his Easy Masher (tm) system which is indeed a worst case scenario for 
wort exposure to brass, because his practice is to let the hot wort remain in 
contact with the brass fittings for several hours before chilling and then he 
ferments the beer in the same vessel.  Most users of the EM would be 
boiling, chilling and transferring the wort to another fermentation vessel, so 
their beer would not be in contact with the brass for more than a few hours 
at most.  Be that as it may, the Lab results showed that the Tap Water was 6 
PPB, and the beer was less than 10 PPB.  The beer may have been equal to 6, 
but resolution prevented determining this.  The EPA limit is 15 PPB.  While 
only one data point, it does support my original thought that brass in the 
wort should not be a problem.
 
*Joining of Steel and Brass/Copper*
Stainless steel can be welded, but it must be done under an inert gas 
atmosphere.  The most reliable method for welding stainless is the Tungsten 
Inert Gas (TIG) aka. GTAW and Helio-Arc.  Because 300 series stainless 
steels are prone to High Temperature Embrittlement and Sensitization, the 
welder must be careful not to apply too much heat for too long during 
welding.  An experienced stainless steel TIG welder will know how to 
produce a good weld without overheating it.  Overheating causes 
precipitation of the chromium atoms away from the grain boundaries to 
form carbides.  The formation of these carbides results in localized corrosion 
and rapid cracking.  I have also heard of this cracking happening to a 
brewer who had his Cajun Cooker propane burner too hot on his stainless 
boiling pot.


Soldering/Brazing of Stainless steel to Brass also works.  Solder or brazing 
rod containing Lead or Cadmium should never be used.  Both surfaces to be 
joined must be cleaned and fluxed for best results. Silver solders work well 
for joining Brass and stainless.  Of course, it is best to mount the fittings 
away from the heat source, typically on the side of the keg or pot.


Silver based brazing alloys are lower melting than Copper/Zinc brazing 
alloys, so the silver based are the more practical choice for
Do-it-yourselfers.  
Again, make sure the filler alloy does not contain cadmium.


*Galvanic Corrosion*
In the acidic wort environment, some rate of galvanic corrosion will occur.  
The most anodic metals will corrode preferentially to those that are more 
cathodic. The galvanic series is:
(Most Anodic)
Magnesium
Zinc
Aluminum
Cadmium
Plain Steel/Iron
Lead
Tin
Brass
Copper
Silver Solder
Stainless Steel
Silver
Titanium
Carbon
Gold
Platinum
(Most Cathodic)
Net experience has shown that the corrosion rate between Stainless and 
Brass/Copper at the homebrewing level, has not been significant.  While 
there has been some corrosion taking place ie. copper wort chiller 
brightening, the rate is small.


If anyone has any specific questions, you are always welcome to email me.  
Brazing is not one of my specialties, nor are Copper alloys, but I will look 
up as much as I can.  There are a few of you whom our server doesn't like or 
vice versa (Dion, Dennis), but hopefully that can get fixed.

Subject: A/B vs SA


Howdy, y'all,


I've just caught up on the last few days of HBD, & I noticed something quite
interesting.  One post mentions an Anheuser-Busch ad that basically trashes
homebrewing, while another reviews Samuel Adams Triple Bock.  So why is it that
no one out there makes _any_ response to the A/B ad, but people start flocking
to trash SA?  Should A/B be forgiven for making us look like backwoods
moonshiners, while Mr. Koch is still considered evil manifested?  Some people
were trashing the Triple Bock & hadn't even tried it yet! (Yes, sherry, port, &
madeira notes are acceptable in heavy beers, BTW).


Yes, I'll admit that Koch's marketing techniques & constant litigation habits
are reprehensible, but no different that A/B's.  At least Koch is introducing
this country to some beer styles that haven't been brewed on a large scale
ever, while A/B calls our stuff swill.  Who's the real bad guy out there?


An aside:  has anybody out there used dewberries, loganberries, or boysen-
berries?  It's the season, & I've got my hands on some dewberries, & was
thinking of making a Dewberry Dunkleweissen.


Peace&brewing,


Alan of Austin

Well put.  Users of my BBS Network have recently been expressing quite
a bit of outrage over A-B's recent ads which seek to disparage homebrewers.
I have summarized the debate (not that there is much debate - everyone is
AGREES that these are infuriatingly inane ads!) in the lead story in the
most recent HBU BBS Network E-News.  It is much too long to reproduce here.

Thanks to all, for the responses to putting taps on a chest freezer.  It seems
that only one person has actually drilled through the side of their freezer 
(between the coils) to place a tap through.  The rest have placed tower taps on
top of the freezer.  The tower taps are nicer taps but you must provide more
clearance from the wall for the lid with the taps on it.  There you have it.

Subject: More info on HydraPure Valves


Hello Group,
I talked with Jim Davis-Plumbing Valve Product Manager of Nibco. The HydraPure
lead-free brass valves and fittings are not currently being actively
distributed. And the company is not interested in mail order. So, the
recommended course of action is to call up your local plumbing supplies
distributer and tell them you would like to purchase these products. As Nibco
is interested in developing a market for these lead-free parts, they are eager
for distributers to request them. Most types of parts are available for
purchase by retailers. They have 90s, Ts, Unions, Couplings, Gate Valves, Stop
Valves, Angle Sillcocks, Boiler Drains, but the Ball Valve (1/4 turn) (#585-70
HP) that all of us want to use is not yet available in the 1/2 inch size. Doh!
FYI, the cost of these parts is a significantly higher because of the small
amount produced and lack of market. A Boiler Drain valve (with the round
handle? you turn several times to open, like your outside faucet) costs either
$5.85 or $8.40 for the 1/2 inch 74 HP or 64 HP, respectively. In the
illustration, the 74 HP is shown oriented horizontally, the 64 HP vertically,
but otherwise they look exactly the same. 


Andy Rooney Moment: Have you ever noticed that we apparently don't have a 
common-usage word for these outdoor faucet round handles? Its just,
"Go turn on/off The Water." I sat here for minutes wondering how I was going to
describe what kind of valve I am talking about. The above was my best rocket
scientist answer.


They do have Kitchen and Bathroom faucets available, in case anyone is
interested.

Hello,
        Yesterday, JS posted something about getting
his beer tested in a lab for lead, brass levels, to
set upper limits on easymasher contributions.  I am 
in california.  Does anyone know of a lab or company
around here that would do this for a reasonable price?

Specifics:
malt:                3lbs Amber, 3lbs Light malt
grains:                     1/2lb roasted C40, 1/2lb C40, 1lb C60, boiled 30 min
boiling hops:        1 Cascade, 1/2oz. ?? (lost label)  hops
Finishing hops:      1/2 oz. ??? hops
yeast:               2 packages ale yeast
                     1 tsp. gypsum (to harden water) 


I brewed this beer last Saturday night (April 23).  In the primary 
fermentation carboy I got fairly active fermentation for the first
3 days, then it 
subsided as the temperature in my closet fell below 65F. I placed the 
carboy near a radiator and got two more days worth of regular bubbles 
in the airlock. It stopped bubbling completely, and my partner and I 
were afraid we had done some damage to the yeast by pitching it when 
the wort was still near 100F.  We made another 1.5qt batch of wort and, 
after chilling it to 70 and letting the yeast work on it for a couple 
hours, we poured it off in the batch in questions. On Sat. 4/29 I could 
see no activity, 
even when the carboy was near a radiator.  I planned to rack it to 
another carboy, but have had trouble getting my hands on one.  I will 
finally be able to tomorrow.  My original s.g. was about 56, it is currently 
reading 29.  The stuff tastes fine, but I thought I should be looking 
for an ending sg or around 12 to 10.  


Questions: Do I risk getting a contamination in the beer if there is 
no observable fermentation? Is there anyway to restart it, or is is 
possibly still working even though I can't see it? What ending gravity 
should I be looking for? Was the added small batch of wort a bad idea?


Thanks for your suggestions. I have found HBD to be the best resource 
out there and always interesting to browse.

This has bugged me too, just on principles, it does waste a lot of water. I
don't know how your friend moves water but if he uses a pump maybe he could
recycle it back to the holding tank. If the tank is large, as it probally is
being a water supply, then it should be able to take the heat without too
much temperature rise. You don't have to throw the water away.

As an extract brewer who has recently moved to partial mashes, I would like
to lodge a strong vote against this idea.  Sure there is a lot of stuff to
go through every day, but 95% percent of it applies to you, whether you
realize it or not!

 While in England last fall I had the pleasure to imbibe in a wonderful

I made this great (MHO) ascii drawing of the business end of my homebrewery,
and I thought it'd be worth sharing.  It is a tower system; the drawback to
this is that the hot liquor tank sits up quite high, which has its safety
problems, but it is pretty stable.  I've seen a nice version of this made
from a steel tree-like support system, but mine is based on what was on hand
(a refrigerator and some lumber).  John Palmer suggested I mention the
cost of the various components, but so much of it was custom made for the
cost of homebrew, it's little tough to say.  The biggest cost was the labor
for building all this stuff, but when its a hobby labor doesn't count, right?

        Hi all,
  I'm looking for an all grain (or extract, we'll wing it) recipe
for Heineken. 
  On a related note, how often is The Cats Meow updated? I couldn't
find a Hineybrew clone in my copy, but its 6 months old. Just curious.


        Thanks in advance,

Subject: All grain question/Beer-related activities in Boston


Hello everyone out there in homebrew land! With several years of extract-
brewing under my belt, I am getting enough nerve to brew my first batch
using all grain.  This weekend I visited the Frederick Brewing Company
in Frederick, MD, and I guess you could say that I was inspired. Anyway,
I am sorry for the grain-newbie question, but I am confused about something:
I was always under the assumption that crystal malt was to be steeped
and not boiled so as not to release harsh tannins.  But Papazian's
all-grain recipes state to mash the crystal along with the other grains.
Am I missing something?  Please don't get mad at me for the (stupid?)
question, but I can't seem to find the answer.  Thanks in advance.  Please
e-mail me directly.
        Also, I will be in Boston for a wedding on Memorial Day weekend,
and I'd like to take in a few beer-related sights, sounds, and tastes.
I have lists of Boston brewpubs/breweries, etc., but I would appreciate any
recommendations you have so I can narrow the scope of my adventures.  Any
advice on where to go would be greatly appreciated.
        Thanks for the help.  BTW, I highly recommend a visit to the Frederick
Brewing Company for those living in MD, DC,PA, and VA!

I know I'm not going crazy but I'm sure in the past couple of months I have 
seen a chart listing the HBU's of extract kits. I can't find it now though.


I have a couple of cans of hopped extract and I'd like to get an idea of how 
hopped these extracts are so that I can make adjustments in the brewing 
process to reach the desired bitterness and aroma. Has anyone else seen this 
chart (or anything like it) and can point me toward it?

Perhaps it is the yeast itself.  The effect went away after about a week
more in the keg.  In short the yeast settled out.  I would suspect that the
concentration of the yeast in suspension from your "secondary" sample, would
be as high or higher than my impatient tapping of the keg.

It may be that the higher concentration of hop components in young beer may
cause the effect also?  I really don't think it would have enough influence
to maintain over through most of the next day.  Also more commonly higher
hopped beers would cause this problem.

The problem is that, although there are a lot of Zymurgy subscribers and
a lot of people writing about brewing on the Internet, in reality only
12 of them actually make beer.  The rest of them are too busy building
recirculating mash systems and figuring ways to measure their alpha
acids to the fourth place to brew.  Hence, the market is tiny.

Out of curiosity, did you use any Irish Moss in the boil?  I have been
consistently getting ferments that look much like this with the
combination of Belgian malts and IM.  Is the wort itself clear?  Mine
is, even during fermentation.  But the first time I saw all this weird
glop in the wort I panicked, too.  It seems, however, to be normal.  The
Belgian malts are very high in lipids and I suspect that you are getting
what you *should* be getting.  Let's see how the beer turns out.

You have no idea how long those kits have been sitting around, and how
long the dry yeast has been sitting there at room temperature (or
worse).  The stuff simply will not last forever. The reason you're
seeing lackluster fermentations is that the yeast is mostly dead.

I've done some reasonable test beers using the new Red Star ale yeast.
It's extremely vigorous and hasn't produced any off-flavors.  On the
other hand, I would no more use dry yeast in a beer that I loved than I
would serve my homemade Pat Prik King Mu with Uncle Ben's rice.

If you have a basement you are miles ahead of the game.  For temperature
control, get a sturdy rubber trashcan (clean!), put in your fermenter,
add water to the trashcan (enough so the fermenter doesn't float!) and
suspend an aquarium heater in the water (I float it on a piece of
styrofoam).  These heaters are extremely accurate and will allow you to
hold fermentation temperature right where you want it.

Greetings all,


I just bottled up a batch of (soon to be) sparkling cider.
Most of the bottles are sealed with corks (I had a bunch
of old Chimay bottles around) and the book I have on wine making
("The Art of Making Wine" or something like that, a rather 
basic book) says to stand the bottles up.  Now everything
else I've read says that corks must be wet in order to seal
properly which would mean I better lay them down.  So, anyone
out there with experience corking carbonated beverages who
would like to comment?


Thanks,

As far as light goes, I either a) wrap the carboy in an old towel, or b)
cut a hole in the bottom of a large paper grocery-type bag and place the
bag over the carboy (the airlock or blowoff tube sticks out through the
hole).  Not completely light-proof, but probably effective enough unless
your carboy is sitting in direct sunlight.

Typically, we're talking small amounts, like a gram or two per gallon
(1/4 to 1/3 oz per 5 gallon batch).  I'll often use unground spices as
well, like whole cloves or stick cinnamon.  My advice is to start low
until you get a feel for different spices.  If you don't add enough, no
harm done -- you still have drinkable beer.  If you add to much, you may
end up contributing to the slugs' Xmas party.


On a related note, I have noticed lately that a lot of new brewers are
making unusual beers in their first few batches -- using honey, spices,
superstrong beers, etc.  Now, I'll admit I did the same thing; one of my
first all-grain batches was a miserable attempt at a barleywine.  We
all want to make something that's not available in stores.  I certainly
encourage that.


In 20/20 hindsight, though, it seems like beginners ought to start off
with basic stuff and get down the technique before complicating things.
All this info is confusing enought without adding any complexity.  This
is not meant to be a flame (a sure sign I'll get torched :-), but I'm
curious as to everyone's motive (both beginner and expert) for making
strange brews.

I've decided that I dislike chemistry, or should say I have remembered

off of lots of white crud.  This is good I said to my self.  However 
when I checked  the pH of the cooled water I found that it had gone up

make sense to someone out there who dislikes chemistry less than I do?

I too have been looking for a PWA recipe and found this in PALE4.REC on 
Compuserve.
For my first batch I have modified this to the following:


6.6 lbs Yellow Dog Malt Extract
6 oz Chocolate Malt
6 oz Crystal Malt 20lv
 .65 oz Brewers Gold Hops Pellets ( This from the neck label of a bottle.)


Follow the above recipe.


Yes I'm ambitious (sp?) for my first but I want to make a very special brew 
for #1. I'd also like to see any other recipes for PWA.


Any comments on my variation will be appreciated.


BTW, I enjoy the HBD the way it is and learn much from all of you, and THE

I mounted the heat/cool switch in a box attached to the bottom of the
thermostat. The frig plugs into an AC receptacle mounted in the box. The
heater is connected via a piece of lamp cord and is located in the frig. I
have an indoor/outdoor thermometer mounted to the side of the frig. This way
I can tell what the inside temp is and judge the ambient temp to decide if
I'm going for the heat or the cool. Be careful when mounting the heater
coil. It floats at 120 VAC even when not used! Don't touch it! Place it in a
safe out of the way place where you can't get to it. Don't forget to use 3
wire gounded recepacles for all wiring. The frig could also float when in
the heat cycle if there was an internal short somewhere. Ground the
thermostat housing and the attached box. If you don't know much about
electronics/electricity, it would be best to find someone that does and buy
them a few beers for some help.

Subject:  Conserve Water while cooling.


Hello,
 I have been reading HBD for about 6 months now and have seen
several articles about using a wort chiller for rapid cooling of the wort to
pitching temp. There has been a lot of talk about conserving water while
doing this. I live here in New Mexico and we haven't had much rain in
the past year or so and we are now starting to conserve water. Thus I
had to come up with a way to cool my brew and still be able to
conserve on water usage. I have been able to cool my wort down to
70* F in about 20 mins using only 2 to 3 gallons of water..


I started with a 5 gal plastic container. (doesn't have to be food grade
but does need to be clean). I drilled two holes in the lid about 6 inches
apart. The size  of the hole will be dependent on the size of garden hose
you have hooked up to your wort chiller. Next I connected one end of
my wort chiller to a small electric water pump via garden hose.. The
other end of the wort chiller I connected a piece of  hose and inserted it
into one of the holes in the lid. (leave enough hose to reach down into
the container about 3" or so)  On the intake or feed end of the pump I
connected a piece of  hose and inserted it into the other hole in the lid.
(this hose must reach down into the water or at least 1" from the bottom
of the container. I then put two gallons of water into the container. To
keep the water cold I have used large ice chunks made from 1 gallon
milk jugs. I fill the jugs with water freeze. Once frozen, cut and remove

to use crushed ice because the small pieces might get sucked into the
pump. Place the lid on the container and start the pump.


The first pump I used was the type that you connect to a standard had

there and hold the drill until the wort was cool. I since purchase a small
water pump for $45.00 that I don't have to monitor.

Subject: Appropriate yeast for Barleywine?
I am about to attempt my first barleywine. It appears that some pitch just an
Ale yeast, others pitch a Champagne yeast, while even others pitch an Ale
yeast and then later pitch a Champagne yeast in the same batch. What is the
proper procedure? What are the advantages of any one method over the other?


BTW, I am an extract brewer, if that makes a difference in answering this
question.

Subject:  Conserve Water while cooling.


Hello,
 I have been reading HBD for about 6 months now and have seen
several articles about using a wort chiller for rapid cooling of the wort to
pitching temp. There has been a lot of talk about conserving water while
doing this. I live here in New Mexico and we haven't had much rain in
the past year or so and we are now starting to conserve water. Thus I
had to come up with a way to cool my brew and still be able to
conserve on water usage. I have been able to cool my wort down to
70* F in about 20 mins using only 2 to 3 gallons of water..


I started with a 5 gal plastic container. (doesn't have to be food grade
but does need to be clean). I drilled two holes in the lid about 6 inches
apart. The size  of the hole will be dependent on the size of garden hose
you have hooked up to your wort chiller. Next I connected one end of
my wort chiller to a small electric water pump via garden hose.. The
other end of the wort chiller I connected a piece of  hose and inserted it
into one of the holes in the lid. (leave enough hose to reach down into
the container about 3" or so)  On the intake or feed end of the pump I
connected a piece of  hose and inserted it into the other hole in the lid.
(this hose must reach down into the water or at least 1" from the bottom
of the container. I then put two gallons of water into the container. To
keep the water cold I have used large ice chunks made from 1 gallon
milk jugs. I fill the jugs with water freeze. Once frozen, cut and remove

Subject: spruce beer recipes?


Spring is here and I'd like to brew an all-grain batch using the fresh
growth of Sitka Spruce trees.  The trouble is that I'm new to all-grain
brewing, and all the spruce beer recipes in the CatsMeow II and Papazian
are extract based.  Does anyone have any good all-grain spruce recipes,
or could anyone help out in apporoximating Papazian's "Kumdis Island
spruce ale"?  
Thanks much in advance.
