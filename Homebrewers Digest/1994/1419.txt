                      BrewArt, vol3--The Woodcuts
Welcome to the BrewArt Collection, volume #3 (for Macintosh)!


        ** "The Woodcuts Edition" **


copyright 1994 George (Ty) Tempel




This collection should show up at sierra.stanford.edu in the
/pub/homebrewing/docs directory as "brewart_3.hqx" or
"BrewArtv3.hqx". As with the other BrewArt collections,
you can download with a TEXT mode anonymous ftp to
sierra.stanford.edu. Once you've gotten the file onto your
macintosh use something like StuffItExpander to
un-binhex the file into a DiskDoubler self-extracting archive,
which explodes into a folder.


Chances are that if you were to simply double-click on any
of the clip art files nothing remarkable would happen. Since
they are clip art, you need to use the "Open" or "Place Art"
menu selections within your graphics program to open these
files and pop them into your own designs.


ABSTRACT:
This collection is the thrid edition of a set of brewing
related clip art that I am in the process of creating and
compiling. I have used some of these elements on my beer
labels, and a few of my network-friends have found them 
helpful as well.


DESCRIPTION:
The artwork is provided in the form of PICT files, which
are easily handled by nearly all major applications in
the Macintosh universe. I considered converting some stuff
to EPS (postscript) format, but not everyone out there has
access to nice postscript printers, such as myself. Since
the files are PICTS, it is feasible to convert them to
one or more various DOS/Windows formats, but you will loose
information in the conversion process. Since I don't have
a DOS/Windows machine (insert large grin here), I cannot
do the conversion for you, so it is left as an exercise
for the user (didn't you hate it when textbooks would
do that?).


Also, as an added feature, any text in the clip art is
provided in the form of bezier outlines, so you don't
need to have the fonts on your system. This allows
a safe distribution method, as fonts are copyrighted
and usually cannot be freely distributed. Most of the
advanced graphics software today has the ability to convert
outline fonts (PostScript or TrueType) into bezier
outlines that can be edited with the application, just as
if you had drawn them yourself.




Just for the record, I created the artwork using
Canvas 3.5, Color-It 2.3.2, Adobe Streamline 3,
and Adobe Illustrator 5.


Some of the artwork is pre-colored, but you can change 
that if you like. I have an accellerated Macintosh II 
(Dove Racer, 32MHz), a vintage DeskWriter inkjet printer, 
and the Logitech ScanMan. I also find that if you wish
to use Avery labels, try to find a box of #5164, which
are 3.33" x 4". They come right off of the bottle when
you use a little B-Brite cleanser, and some graphics
programs support the Avery label formats for templates
(mine didn't, however).


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


THE FINE PRINT:
This collection is released as brew/credit-ware (I know,
an awkward term, but you'll see that it fits). If you
decide to use any of the clip art from the collection, you
must give me, George (Ty) Tempel, partial credit for the
artwork and send me a bottle of the homebrew that you've
labelled. It's just that simple. No messy fees, etc. Please
remember that it is unlawful to send alcohol via the
US Postal Service, but private carriers (UPS, FedEx, Airborne,
etc), _can_ ship the stuff, just make sure that the brew
is securely packaged (try placing the bottles into tight
plastic bags just in case...). I have shipped several
bottles without problems, but sometimes I label the
contents as "food", "yeast culture equipment", or "glassware"
and have never had a problem (knock on formica).

As of this date, the release of my 3rd collection, not a
soul has sent me anything. Nada. I'd at the very least
like to hear from you, if it's not too much trouble!




Comments and suggestions are welcome, and stay tuned for
more collections to be released at later dates!

Absolutely NOT!!!  Coke produced the specifications for pin lock
fittings specifically so that they had a proprietery size.  No
portions of any ball lock QD will mate to threads on any pin lock.
This is a shame, since there are a number of fittings including NPT
threads which go on the top of ball lock QD fittings which are not
available for pin lock.  I have talked extensively to the Hansen
technical people (they make the pin lock fittings) and they had never
thought to try to adapt some of the ball lock stuff to pin lock.  They
thought it would not work, and then tried it to make sure,  and sure
enough, it does not.

You can get 6.5 gal carboys for $19.95 from:

They come with a styrofoam base.


Now for my two questions.


I currently use a plastic primary for one week, then use a 5 gal glass carboy
for several weeks, keg and force prime.  What would I gain by using a glass
primary?


Second, Garden Ridge Pottery has a large selection of interesting bottles.
However, many of them are colored glass.  One that I would like to use has
a very light blue green color to it.  It is fish shaped, but has a wine bottle
top that will take a cork.


The problem with lead and brass makes me wonder if I need to be worried about
what is used to color the glass.  Does any one have any info about this?

Subject: Distilled vs. Deionized


What is the difference in the resultant water between distillation and
de-ionization?  Do these names apply to two different processes that produce
the same thing (i.e. pure water)?


My well water
 has a high iron content (I can taste it-and when the shower's running, I can
even smell it), will distillation remove this?
Also, on a related issue, in the distillation of water, if chlorine boi
ls off at a lower temperature than water, isn't it likely to be condensed
right back into the (then) distilled water?


What's the skinny on this?


Thanks in advance.  (private e-mail welcome)

Randy Mosher of the Chicago Beer Society has built a couple of these things.
My concern about their use is the relatively large surface area of
rubber that will be in close proximity to my beer.  Besides not being food
grade, I'll also bet that it may impart a butyl aroma to the beer after a while.
I'll stick with using Carbonators(tm).

Not quite.  Carbon dioxide dissolved in the water (carbonic acid) is acidic,
but carbonates are definately not.  They will make your water decidedly
alkaline.  Carbonates in the local water are the primary reason that Dublin,
Munich and London originally brewed only dark beers where the acidity of the
dark grains worked in concert with the alkalinity of the water to put the
mash in the right pH range to get decent conversion.

There are about eight different connectors for 5gallon syrup canisters,
half of them ball the other half pin.  One of the ball-lock connectors
will fit in place of one of the pin-lock connectors.   If you are lucky
enough to have a keg with the common thread size, then indeed, you can
interchange.

I'd like to advise against storing anything in B-Brite or One-Step.  They
contain Sodium Percarbonate, which, after a while becomes just Sodium
Carbonate.  I once soaked bottles overnight in Sodium Carbonate (washing
soda) and it left a carbonate precipitate on the bottles.  Only soaking
in lemon juice water removed it.

No... *less* attenuative yeast -- one that will leave more sugars.
Wyeast #1338 (European Ale) is the least attenuative of all the
Wyeasts.  Lactose will sweeten it, but I suspect that your dryness
was lactobacillus from the fruit (I believe that freezing won't kill
them) and they definately can eat Lactose.  You can try sanitation
by freezing and then blanching or try Camden tablets.  Once you kill
the lactobacillus you can sweeten with Lactose.

Subject: Pumps






        I spotted an advertisement recently in Nuts & Volts Magazine for a
small stainless steel pump.  The ad reads as follows:


        Pump, Fluid, magnetically coupled,
        stainless steel body, self priming
        115VAC pumps approximately 3 liters
        per minute suitable for RF cooling,
        fountains, etc. Used, reconditioned,
        like new $75 PPD. Mike's Surplus
        Stuff, 800-769-7977 9pm-midnight EST


I called Mike and asked about his pumps. He said that they were removed from
commercial inkjet printers. They have universal motors, some are 220VAC, and
are reconditioned. I asked in what way were they reconditioned. Mike said
that they are cleaned and tested. He also said that they have 1/4" inlet and
outlets and were made by Tuthill Pump Co of CA. He did not know what the
impellers were made of. The model number of the pump he had in his hand was
D9879CWFK.


        I called Tuthill Pump Co of CA and talked with Ron Tate. Ron decoded
the model number and came up with:


        C = Carbon Teflon filled PPS (trade name Ryton) drive and driven gears
        W = no bypass
        F = ????? (Perhaps E? E = Ethylene Propylene) O-ring seals
        K = Carbon bearings


The gear shafts are 316 Stainless.


        The bottom line is that these are positive displacement gear pumps 
capable of substantial pressure, low flowrate, made of materials which should
be compatible with most chemicals encountered in brewing. They should be
suitable for use in a small home brewery. Universal motors have brushes,
which eventually wear out, but also have the advantage that they can be
speed controller by a simple rheostat and can run on either AC or DC.

In HBD#1417 John Palmer & Norm were talking about Jack Scmidling
having his EM nickel plated.  The nitric acids, and all the cleaning
processes are very closely watched in a plating house.  Poor cleaning
leads to poor adhesion.  A "peeler" is akin to a cardinal sin.  Think

Subject: Chlorine Bleach and Stainless


Hi Group.
Well, in response to a few requests of my Stainless and Chlorine /treatise/, I
dug it up from under the short leg of my desk.
(from last year)
In the recent post by Ed Hitchcock, he mentioned the current HBD wisdom of not
using Bleach (chlorine) in Stainless Steel kegs and the current interest in
iodine. I checked out the Metals Handbook Vol. 13- Corrosion, on Chlorine and
Stainless and here is what I found.


Chlorine (aqueous) is highly corrosive to austenitic stainless steels, which
includes the 304 alloy most commonly used for Food Grade containers. The
mechanism of corrosion homebrewers mostly have to be concerned with is Pitting
Corrosion.  This is caused by localized concentration of chlorine ions.  Those
ions become concentrated by evaporation of water containing chlorine.  The
corrosion is manifested as tiny pits which, due to increased relative
concentration of the chlorine in the pit to the surrounding environment,
quickly put pinholes in your tanks.


To prevent this type of corrosion, the key is good rinsing of the bleach water
from the steel.  First off, let me say that the 1+ tablespoon bleach per gallon
(4ml/liter) is not much in the context of the industrial corrosion that the
Metals Handbook is written to.  Most of what I read dealt with continuous flow
through pipes, etc.  Anyway, If you rinse with warm boiled water until you
don't really smell it, and then prevent water droplets on the sides by either
filling the keg with beer or drying them out with a towel, you will not have
the localized concentration necessary to induce pitting.


One other thing that can be done with Stainless Steel is passivation.  A 20% by
volume solution of (HNO3) Nitric Acid will ensure a uniform oxide film which
will prevent the localized concentration/activity difference which initiates
this form of galvanic corrosion.  But I don't think this should be necessary.
(end)
Additional information:  Storing bleach water for more than a couple hours is
not advised. One brewer experienced thru-pinholes at the waterline of his
stainless pot when he let is sit for several days. The corrosion rate is not
lightening fast, but any pinhole that starts to form will only get deeper with
repeated exposure. When left to sanitize, the keg should be as full as possible
so that there is no waterline or other surface energy transition that will set
up the corrosion reaction. Corrosion attack is dependant on concentration, so
do not exceed the 1-2 tablespoons per gallon of bleach concentration. I believe
I read that these concentrations are effective sanitizers for a 20 minute
period. 


Reading over this, I realize it is not the most favorable commentary; so let me
pose this parallel: Your local community swimming pools have at least as much
chlorine smell to the water as this concentration, and the stainless steel
ladders submerged in those pools last for years. So, Sanitize, rinse with
boiled water, and you should have zero problems.

Subject: Lower Calorie Beer


This is my first posting after having read the HBD for about a month and
brewing for about 6 months. 
I am basically an extract brewer (due to a >full time job) who sometimes
infiltrates specialty grains while heating the boil water.
Unfortunately, I have noticed several effects from homebrewing that were
not evident with store-bought beers;


1. Belly getting bigger
2. Head in morning getting heavier


Is there any experiences out there to aid my plight? I LOOOOOOOOVE the full
beer taste
 & don't want to lighten things up too much.
Will filtering reduce the hangover effects? Will adding rice (wince) or 
diluting(wince also) help the belly?


[diluting(wince also) help the belly?
What exactly is it that the big boys do to make a light beer? Is there some
way to make a "better" light beer via homebrew methods?

Subject: Priming sugar question - no, really!


Whud id iz: Hi there, so sorry but somehow I managed to screw up in trying
to post this question in HBD #1418.  Too much relaxing while driving the
info superhighway, no doubt.  Let's try again, shall we?


I am wondering about the differences between various priming sugars.  I
just bottled my second Australian batch, after which I noticed that the
fine print on the bag of "brewer's sugar" said that the contents were
dextrose, derived from wheat starch, and not glucose, which is what I have
used in the past.  OK, so the print was an inch tall.  Please don't shoot
me, but I don't have a bottling bucket and simply prime each bottle
individually with 1/2 tsp.  Anyway, after 9 days in the bottle, the first
of these batches has only a mild "pffft" when uncapped, with nil
carbonation (flavor is great though--nothing else is wrong).  I know it
needs another couple weeks conditioning, but in my experience with
glucose, beers like this one (fairly robust pale ale) are much more
carbonated at this stage.  Am I doomed to undercarbonation with these two
batches?  (BTW, the other is a stout.) Private email preferred, if it's
worth it I'll post a summary. 


Thanks a lot, I'll try not to screw up any more posts.
Cheers, Dave in Sydney

Pete Figura asks about making Spruce ale.
My advice is GO LIGHTLY on the spruce. I followed Papazian's Spruce ale
recipe and it was so 'sprucy' as to be undrinkable. One judge commented 'I
could drink only one sip'. And people think being a judge gets lets you taste

Well, I recommend you send an email message to mgaretz`at`hoptech.com
and ask Mark Garetz of HopTech for some Blueberry extract and a
catalog.  Also, 1 800 DRY-HOPS will get them.


Mark's company specalizes in Hops, has some great prices, and does hop
oils, essences, and extracts.


His fruit extracts which come in Raspberry, BLUEBERRY, Cherry, Peach
and Pear are the same extract used by commercial breweries.  100%
fruit flavor, with no preservatives.


I have used his Raspberry may times, and have tried the peach once.
If you go for it, let me know how the blueberry turns out!

The first stop should be your state Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  
You'll need a brewery license, you'll need to be bonded, you'll probably 
need a label, even if you keg, and it has to be approved by the boys in 
Washington (a nontrivial procedure).  Depending on where you are and how 
familiar the state authorities are with handling brewpub licenses, it'll 
take you a minimum of 2 months, probably 6 months, to get a license.  
I think our license in NC cost a $1000.


The Microbrewers Resource Directory from the Association of Brewers in 
Boulder is the best one-stop resource for start-up info for small 
breweries.  Check out the catalog in the middle of Zymurgy for ordering 
info.

Subject: Full-boil extract brew questions...


 I just received my new BCI converted SANKEY keg in the mail and it's in great 
shape. Thanks for all of you who suggested going this route. I plan on 
purchasing a King Cooker in the next week. I bought this in anticipation of 
going to all-grain. What I would like to do first though is do an extract brew 
but with a full boil so I can get used to the King Cooker and using a wort 
chiller before I add mashing to the process. I'm also interested in any taste
differences with a full-boil extract brew vs my boil 2 gallons and add water
later brew. Can any of you out there give me any pointers about this. I really 
don't know how much water to use with a full boil? I assume I want to use in 
the range of 7 gallons since an hour boil will lead to some evaporation. I 
would like to hear any ideas out there. I think after this full boil extract I
will be ready to mash and all-grain it. Maybe I'm wimpin' out but I want to 
get a feel for all of this new equipment before I do an all-grain batch. By 
the way, maybe I'm a little slow but can someone tell me what BTW and YMMV 
means stands for? I feel as if I'm missing something here and I'm actually a 
little embarrased to ask.

Thanks to everyone who helped me upping the bitterness of my brew. I tried 
the hop tea idea...boiled 1 oz Goldings in 2 liters of water for 45 min. 
All I can say is WOW!. It made the beer quite bitter, and added a whole 
new hop flavour to the brew. I like it alot and I am considering doing it 
regularely. Adding the hop tea really shows you what flavours and aromas 
are driven off during fermentation.

About a week ago I posted here about the Dark Sleep Stout that was

I got 240 ppm.  What is the proper range for stouts?  BTW, this stuff

  Hearing all this trouble, and that of the bottle breaking because of 
temperature differences, I can't help but think that there is no reason 
to be using hot tap water through your Jet washer.  Your tap water is 
not hot enough to kill any nasties, so the benefit of the washer is 
purely that of the scrubbing action of the high pressure spray.  You 
might as well just be using cold or luke-warm water.  This is one of the
reasons that you need to sanitize before filling.

 >Sorry about the misleading subject title, it was a cheap trick to get
 attention.
 
 Worked like a charm.  I didn't respond because I didn't read it the first 
 time and far less importantly, I haven't a clue as to the answers to all your 
 questions.  However, as you did get my attention, I have some thoughts on the 
 subject in general.
 
 >Extraction rates (e.g. 35 points/(lb/gal) for pale malt) are based on 100%
 efficiency.   But when do you get 100% efficiency from a mash ? 
 
 Just for the record, the last time I used DK pale ale malt, I got an extract 
 of 37 pts/lb/gal.  That's 106% for those not inclined toward heavy math.
 
 I believe most of this is based on data published in one book from 
 measurements made on specific malts at some point in time and with some 
 particular set of conditions, equipment and process.   No doubt others have 
 done similar measurements and there may be a wealth of data somewhere but my 
 guess is that the variations in malt from lot to lot, supplier to supplier 
 and variations in process, technique and equipment make this method of 
 evaluating efficiency about as useful as arguing about how many angels can 
 dance on the head of a pin.  It also throws in an additional confusion factor 
 that makes it difficult for brewers to compare the actual results of their 
 efforts with results published by others.
 
 From a practical stand point, all one needs to know is the gravity of a 
 gallon of wort produced by a pound of whatever malt is in question.  To 
 extrapolate that real number into a mythical percentage of a variable number, 
 seems a bit silly and counter productive.

Subject: Re: CTSP info


   Chlorinated Trisodium Phosphate is made by making a 12 mole solution
   of TSP and adding 5% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) crystals.  As the
   mixture crystallizes, the sodium hypochlorite is bound by the water of
   hydration.  


   You cannot make CTSP by just adding bleach to TSP.


O.K. so CTSP is not simply TSP+Chlorine.  But do we know what the
practical diffences are?  What does this binding mean to me as a
homebrewer.  I.e., assuming that bleach is not safe, why is CTSP safer
on stainless than TSP+Bleach.  


        John Palmer wrote in digest 1221 that what we as homebrewers
need to watch out for is localized concentrations of chlorine.  He
suggested that we rinse with warm boiled water and then either fill
the keg with beer or dry it out with paper towels.  In this manner we
should not have dropplets where the concentration of clorine is much
higher than the surrounding areas.  Keeping this in mind, does the
binding in CTSP act as a wetting agent so that we keep the solution
from forming droplets?


        Assuming that we can trust John Palmer, it seems unnecessary
to use CTSP at all.  A simple chlorine rinse would seem to work fine
(and be much cheaper).  


Anyone care to fill in the gaps?

Subject: Beginner in Mashing HELP ME!


I would like to start to learn how to become a "Grain Brewer". I'm an
extract brewer with 20 brews under my belt.


I have read numerous messages and files concerning All Grain Brewing, but
I'm confused when I comes to Sparging. and use of a Lafturn.


Here's my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong)


I place the grains into a bucket, with false bottom (one bucket with
zillion holes within another bucket) or pot add water at 1qt h20 to 1 lb grain.
Hold at the respective temps for the respective times to mash the grains.
(Can I mash several types of grains together?)


Then pour hot water over the grains (how much water?), then let the colored
water (wort) that comes out go into my brew pot.


I read somewhere that you keep adding water to the mashed grains until the
wort runs clear??  How do I know what the OG reading should be?


Then proceed as I would as in extract brewing


How can I figure out the effective rate of my mashing?


Help me if anyone can! Or explain it to me in SIMPLE ENGLISH terms. And
what equipment do I need to buy to "Mash and Sparge"


Damn, I'm confused!!!!!!!!!!!!

Not the point at all, Mark.  I never said or implied that.  Bleach is
just fine,  but it is not a good cleaner, CTSP is.  Therefore, I can
clean and sanitize with a single product.  That is the only reason I
use CTSP instead of bleach.  If you never have anything which needs
cleaning, stick to bleach for sanitizing.

This weekend I was getting the urge to brew something - anything - and I
found some carrots.  I juiced up a gal, heated 2 cups to boiling and added

be alot of fermentable sugars.


So what have I made?  Does anybody care?  I know that there will be

I'm going to give it a few weeks then rack it and let it settle for a few
