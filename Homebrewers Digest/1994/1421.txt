It is the method that you have wrong.  to force-carbo:


1) do not prime
2) put keg in fridge and chill to as cold as it'l go w/o freezing
3) once cold, connect C02 and pressure at 30 PSI... 
4) keep CO2 on and set at 30 PSI
5) shake the shit outta the keg.  you'll hear the hissing of the co2 as the
   beer sucks up the co2
6) do this for 15 or so minutes (you'll be good and spent after that exercise!)
7) disconnect Co2
8) let keg hang out for 24 hrs.
9) reduce pressure to serving pressure, or about 8-12PSI
10) drink.

Subject: Dark Weiss & Kegging Questions


My friend Dave, an infrequent homebrewer (aka heathen), claims to have 
recently drank a "dark weiss" made in Germany.  I contended that it would
be difficult to make such a beer conforming to the German beer purity law
(R_?).  Can someone please settle this?  I suspect that I'm wrong, they
must be able to use roasted grains, how else could they make Beck's Dark?


I have many questions on kegging, and have already read TNCJOHB and the
kegging FAQ.  Anyway, here's some background.  Recently I bought a
kegging setup: a 5 lb CO2 tank, 2 gauges, regulator, and misc fittings.
I already had 3 pin-lock kegs.  I also wanted to be able to use the
"Carbonator" caps for 2L pop bottles, which use a ball-lock fitting.  I
got a threaded connection on the end of the supply line, and matching
threaded ball and pin-lock supply fittings.  [shameless plug for Gar
at Heartland Hydroponics in Vernon Hills, IL, who was most helpful].


Seems like an easy way to be able to use either fitting type: if I needed
to I could buy the ball-lock liquid-out fitting plus the line and tap
and use either keg type.  I also purchased the large O-rings for the kegs,
and bought the smaller ones for the dip tubes at a hardware store, like
the FAQ recommended.  Anyway, here's the questions:


Is it recommended to also replace the middle-sized O-rings on the keg
poppets?  If so, will standard parts from the hardware store work?


What are the tradeoffs between natural (priming) and forced carbonation?
Should the dip tube be shortened for natural carbonation?  I'd rather not,
dumping the first glass seems like a better choice.


Sanitation.  Do you need to sanitize the CO2 supply lines or fittings?
Does the CO2 kill the microbeasts?  What about the liquid out side?  
I can force sanitizer through the output side, but I'm at a loss about the
supply side.


How do you measure/monitor the pressure in a keg?  My setup has an in-line
check valve, so you can't use the dispenser gauge to measure pressure at
the keg.  Do you just bleed it off, then restore it to the desired level
using the regulator & gauge?  Seems like a measurement would be a good way
to check for leaks.


I don't have a fridge for keg storage (yet).  My basement has a crawlspace
at one end that stays at about 65 F, usually lower, until late summer.  Is 
this cold enough for forced carbonation?  I thought about icing the keg in
a 7 gallon bucket for serving, then putting it back in the crawlspace 
during idle periods.  Will this temperature cycling hurt the beer?


Do you shut off the main valve when not in use?  I'm kind of paranoid
about finding my CO2 cylinder empty just when I'm ready to dazzle friends
with my kegged brew.  Are CO2 leaks common?  Can you really smell it, like
the Coyote says? 


Sparkling water.  My setup plus the Carbonator caps have been a great hit
for homemade, all natural, juice flavored sparkling water.  My bride is
impressed, and abuse over buying more HB equipment has been minimal.  A 
tip for anyone out there trying to justify the cost.  FYI, my basic
setup was only $125, with a full CO2 cylinder, but without kegs and the 
extra (threaded ball-lock) fitting.  Email if you'd like details on making 
sparkling water, kinda off the subject for the HBD.


Finally, long ago someone posted about having both 20 LB and 5 LB cylinders,
and filling the 5 from the 20.  Sounds pretty cool, and reduces the risk
of being outa gas if the smaller system developed a leak.  Dealing with
800 PSI of CO2 to charge the 5 from the 20 sounds pretty scary though.
Any thoughts/tips/warnings?


Sorry about the long post.  I promise to return to lurking long term
if you'll please answer my questions.  Thanks alot for any thoughts,
advice, or ridicule.

Okay. So the swimming pool analogy is all wet.  Combing thru the HBD archives

Now I have been using 1 tablespoon per gallon (4ml/l) (1/2 ounce/gallon) and
letting it sit for 20 minutes. By looking at the articles above, the reader is
left with two handfuls of chlorine, looking at his stainless steel keg and
saying Well...?
Does anyone know how many ppms are in a mg/liter??! And how many fluid ounces
per gallon that is?!!
I know, I should be able to figure this out for myself, but its almost 9am and
I have had only one cup of coffee and no donuts.


BTW, FWIW, I am not the Wizard of OZ on these matters, so if you think I am
wrong, blurt it out, I don't mind. I will dig further for the correct answer.
As always, YMMV.

Larry Kelly wanted to know about Homebrew BBS's.


Try Home Brew University BBS at 713-923-6418 (8-N-1)
They also have another "Campus", but I do not have that number handy.


Bruce Wiggins asked about kegging and carbonation pressures.


Look on sierra.stanford.edu under /pub/homebrew/docs for:


co2.txt                - CO2 temp/pressure/volume chart for kegging
co2.ps                - PostScript version of above
co2-volume.c        - C program to print the above chart


These are also on the above BBS.


When I force carbonate my kegs, I take the gas fitting of the CO2 hose, and
replace it with the liquid fitting and let the CO2 bubble up through the beer.
Chill the keg of beer first, and shake while carbonating.  When you hear the
bubbles stop, shake it some more. Keep this up until it does not bubble any 
more.


Try undershooting your target, and then tweeking the carbonation level up.

Some ideas for an improved Zapap from a 20 year brewer (13 years full mash 
using a Zapap).

I've avoided runover of the lower Zapap bucket and increased the capacity  
as well by silicone caulking the gap.  I did this originally to avoid 
pulling air down the side of the sparge, but these are side benefits.  Be 
sure to use food grade caulking, not the stuff with mold inhibitors and 
fungicides (see previous posts).  A better insulator than a winter coat is 
the bottom of the Styrofoam shipping container for a seven gallon carboy.  I 
cut a hole through the Styrofoam and use a part of a broken racking cane 
(lots of those always on hand) as an extender for the outlet tube.  I like 
to brew seven gallons and then dilute to 7-3/4 gal. to fill a quarter bbl. 
Sankey keg, and find I can lauter more than 13 pounds of grain. 
 
>I scorched the counter top next to the stove because of that same >heat 
(bad). Chalk-up another installment of the angry-wife >syndrome. 
 
I avoid scorched stove tops and counters by covering the burner         
reflector bowls, stove top and counters with heavy duty aluminum foil.  It 
also makes cleanups easier, and reduces angry-wife syndrome, too. 
 
I recently retired a 33 qt. enameled steel brew pot when the handle welds 
began to rust and leak. I found a new 40qt. aluminum pot for about $65 
(including lid).  After the extensive commentary on the net earlier, I'd 
like to report that I get no metal flavor, and I get much better hot break 
due to the more efficient boil even though I can use only one burner.  I get 
long stringy break material (like cooked egg white) soon after full boil, 
much more than I used to get.

Well, after several replies from people, I have to admit I was wrong.
I was operating on what I believed to be accurate information obtained
from Spartanburg Firestone Steel who makes the kegs and Hansen who
makes the fittings.  They both specifically stated that Coke had made
the threads incompatible.  From other people's experience, there are
obviously *some* keg and fitting combinations which will interchange.
I have 10 pinlock kegs from three manufacturers with two different
valve body manufacturers and every one of them has the same threads.


I am very sorry for making a hasty and incorrect statement.

I have no expeience with this, but I've given it a great deal of thought, so
I'd like to throw in my 2 cents.


A few months back the discussion of burners came up (surprise) and someone
mentioned reducing the time it takes to come to a boil by surrounding the keg
with a modified oil drum (I think it was) or some such container.


My thought is this: why not vent this jacket to the outside and get rid of
all that CO2, H2O and C
O etc.


Ridiculous ASCII graphics to follow:


                ____I      I____
 ______________[    I
xxxxxxI    ]       XXX = heat source
 ______________     I      I    ]       xxx = sfc. of wort
               [    I      I    ]       ]   = wall of oil drum (or similar)
               [    I      I    ]       I   = wall of brew kettle
               [    I______I    ]       ___
               [     XXXXXX     ]       ___ = outlet pipe




End of Ridiculous ASCII graphics.


Ok, so hopefully you get the idea.  There's a hole cut in the top of the oil
drum to slide the kettle down into.  The drum is open at the bottom so that
the burner can draw in enough air.  There's a hole in one side of the drum,
near the top, with the exhaust pipe connected to it.  Voila.


You may need to make a baffle or two to even out the hot air flow around the
kettle (for efficiency's sake), but other than that it should be fairly
simple (ugly too).


The only problem I can see is venting the hot air fast enough to keep the
system efficient and to let the burner breath new O2.  I originally thought
of using dryer duct, but depending on the required length, the diameter may
not be big enough.


What say you cyberspace engineers, will this work?????????

Well, after several replies from people, I have to admit I was wrong.
I was operating on what I believed to be accurate information obtained
from Spartanburg Firestone Steel who makes the kegs and Hansen who
makes the fittings.  They both specifically stated that Coke had made
the threads incompatible.  From other people's experience, there are
obviously *some* keg and fitting combinations which will interchange.
I have 10 pinlock kegs from three manufacturers with two different
valve body manufacturers and every one of them has the same threads.


I am very sorry for making a hasty and incorrect statement.




        {
        Oh well.  No big deal.  You sure sounded right to me.  It's exactly
        the sort of thing I would expect from Coke (the Annheuser-Bush of
        soda).  I'll bet they tried.  


        I guess I'm going to have to dissasemble the valves and see if I'm
        lucky and have a matching thread type.  Any idea where a good source
        is for new valve bodies?  Sounds like you've talked to a lot of these
        guys.


        }

Well I have just found Heaven! 
For lunch today I tried a Watney Cream Stout (on tap) and could not
believe just how great this beer is. 
I was wondering if there is any fellow homebrewers that might have a
recipe that I could use that would be somewhere close to this wonderful
cream stout. I have tried a Cream Ale using lactose, and it turned out
fairly good but it wasn't a stout.
Please if anybody could help me make some of this (taste of heaven)
beer I would be forever indebted.

HOW TO GET A JOB AT A BREWPUB WITHOUT TRYING


Pay attention, 'cuz I ain't tellin' this but once.  A friend of mine last
week was having a beer at a brewpub he visits on occaision.  He struck up
a conversation with the brewmaster, whom he had chit-chatted with a couple
times before.  It came up that the brewmaster was looking for a new
"cellarmaster" (the guy, in the case of this brewpub, who does the grunt
work in the brewery).  My friend, Jim, expressed some interest, having always
wanted to brew for a living.  The brewer told him he had to interview a couple
of people the next day, but he would get back to Jim.  Well, two days later
Jim got a call with a job offer.  The next day, he had his first day working
in a brewery.


Three days later he met Michael Jackson while on the job.


And all without even trying.

Greetings,


I just returned from a class at the National Institute of Standards (NIST)
and found a great BrewPub and Liquor Store. 
Both in Gaithersburg, Maryland.


The Liquor store is in the Giant Shopping Center directly across from
the light that brings you into NIST. They had more microbrews and
foreign beers than I knew existed. A fine fine selection. Take
route 270 North (from Washington DC) to exit 10, make a right at
the first light, this is the shopping center lot.


The Olde Towne Tavern & Brewing Co. is also in Gaithersburg. I went
from the liquor store (they directed me). At the light that you entered
the shopping center, make a left as if you are going back to I-270.
Go under 270, and make a left on Meem Street. Make a right onto Chestnut.
Finally make a right onto East Diamond St. The pub is on the corner
of E. Diamond and Summitt, park across the street in the train
station lot. They do not have a liscence to brew their own yet, but
they did have; Dominion Lager, Ale & Stout (VA); Dock St Pilsner (PA);
Blue Ridg Porter, Wild Goose Amber, and Old Henreich Marzen, all on tap.

Re: Low Calorie Beers/All Grain Brewing


In HBD1419, PNEUMAND`at`delphi.com complained of 2 problems from 
homebrewing:
1. Belly getting bigger
2. Head in morning getting heavier


For the second problem, C. Papazain recommended in his book (TNCJOHB) 
using a blowoff tube in the primary fermentor to get rid of nasties in the
beer 
that cause deleterious side effects (e.g. heavy head in bed).  I have tried
this 
only once, but I did not see any real benefit; however, I usually only drink
1-2 
beers per days (i.e. I usually don't get bitten by my beers).


For the first problem, I do have some tried and true suggestions.  First, do
not 
compromise your beer.  The basic problem really is fat intake,of which beer
has 
none. :-)   I had a similar problem with a growing belly (gained 30lbs after
I 
started brewing) and although beer does not have fat, it does have alcohol
and 
alcohol interferes with the the breakdown of fat in the body.  If your
homebrew 
packs a higher alcohol content versus commercial, then your body will have a 
harder time getting rid of the fat.  THE SOLUTION IS TO CUT THE FAT 
(you may also want to limit your beer intake while you are trying to lose
weight 
to help speed the process).  So enjoy your beer slowly, don't eat junk food
(low 
fat pretzels go great with beer) and you will be healthier, happier and more 
relaxed.  I am speaking from experience since I managed to lose 25lbs in 3 
months by just eliminating the fries, fatty meats, high fat milk, etc.
- --------------------------------------- 


I have some questions for any of you recently converted all grain brewers (I 
brew with extracts and add specialty grains to enhance):


1) Besides increased self satisfaction and eventual cost savings, what are
the   
      benefits?
          (e.g. have you ever made a similar beer using all grain versus
extract
                        noticed any significant differences)


2) What are some of the difficulties you faced switching over (e.g.
equipment, 
            technique) and how did you overcome them?


3) Are you completely converted over to brewing via all grain?


4) Is there anyone out there who has converted back to extract brewing?


If I get enough responses, I will summarize.  I think most of the extract
brewers 
would agree with me in the sentiment that we do not know what we are missing 
since we already make very enjoy the fruits of our simple labor.


Thanks in advance,

I'm interested in your Anchor Liberty recipe.  I tried Anchor Liberty over 
the weekend and it tastes almost exactly like the pale I just made.  I just 
wondered how similar our recipes are.


6 lbs. Northwestern Pale liquid X
1 lbs..  Lagglander Pale dry X
1/2  lbs.. Crystal 40L
1/2  lbs.. Toasted 25L
3 oz. Cascade (whole leaf)  5.5%,  60min  (Partial Boil)
1 oz. Cascade (whole leaf) dry hop , one week
1 tsp. gypsum
1tsp Irish Moss
Wyeast London


start gravity 1.053
end gravity  1.010


If I were to use only  1/2 oz. dry hop I think they would be identical.
