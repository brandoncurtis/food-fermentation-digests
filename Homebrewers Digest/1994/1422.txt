Subject: Wyeast 1338 for wheat beers


In his discussion on making Bavarian-style wheat beers in "The Complete
Handbook of Home Brewing", Miller recommends Weihenstephan 338 ale yeast,
claiming it "has too much clove for an altbier, but makes an excellent
Weizen" (p215).
  In view of the similarity in numbers, does anyone know whether this is
the same yeast as Wyeast 1338 European ale, and/or if this strain is
useful for this beer style?

Subject: Parallel Yeast Cultures


Greetings:


Having read Homebrew Yeast FAQ, I am attempting to produce parallel yeast
cultures  from a  package of Wyeast 1056, which I understand to be a good
all-around yeast. Last week, I started a 5 pint starter of sterile wort, and
pitched the inflated Wyeast, this into a 1 gal. carboy.  This  fermented out
nicely in a week or so, and I  then bottled about five bottles of yeast-laden
brew for subsequent starters.  I ended up with some remarkably trub-free yeast
in the bottom of each bottle.  Yesterday, I decanted a bottle, and pitched the
yeast slurry into a 1.5L bottle along with a half pint of sterile wort.  This
morning it was fermenting well, so I guess this whole procedure does, in fact,
work. All that is left to do is build up my starter with some more sterile
wort, and pitch the works into my next batch-o-brew.


I have one big question, however.  Once I have bottled the yeast, at what
temperature should I  store the bottles?  Wyeast packets are, of course,
refrigerated, and since my resultant bottles will be treated just like  packets
of Wyeast, should I treat them as such temperature-wise? Any answers, input, or
comments are very welcome. Thanks

Chip Hitchcock mentions that swimming pools have up to 1 ppm of chlorine
and then guesses at recommended amounts for sanitizing.


The recommended amounts for sanitizing are in the 50-200ppm of chlorine,
in cold water with no organic material, for 15 minutes.


How much you should add of your household bleach is left as and exercise
for the reader.  Consider that old bleach containers may not have the 
same concentration of chlorine as new ones.

ALL-GRAIN...HOW I DID IT by Rick Gontarek


 
 Greetings all.  Recently I posted that I made my first all-grain batch
 this past weekend, managing to do so without spending lots o' dough. 
 Due to the overwhelming response I received, I've decided to detail
 how I went about it.  Bear in mind that by opening my technique up to
 the digest, I stand to take a fair amount of criticism for how I did
 certain things.  I'm not saying that I may not have done a few things
 wrong, but it was a positive experience that I hope might inspire 
 others to begin a foray into all-graining.  Of course, all comments
 are welcome.
         I purchased 15 lbs of pale malt from a local homebrew supply
 shop for about $15 (already a great savings over extracts).  I am
 fortunate to have a friend who owns a Corona grain mill.  So Sunday
 morning I made myself a pot of coffee (too early for homebrew) and
 began to crush the grains.  It was fun!  Yes, there was shrapnel and
 dust everywhere (I'm still blowing it out of my nose!), but it was
 nothing that a quick sweep job with a broom couldn't take care of.
 I have two friends that have all-grained using grains crushed in a
 blender. If this is your option, do several short pulses and only par-
tially fill the blender with grain.  This will take some time, but it
 can be done.  Some will indoubtedly argue that this is stupid,
 but in a pinch a blender does the job.
         My recipe was as follows:
 
                 Golden Ale
 
 8 lbs. Pale malt
 0.5 lbs cara-pils (dextrin) malt
 0.1 lbs (2 ounces) Crystal malt (20L)
 0.5 ounces Cascade hops (pellets)
 1.2 ounces Williamette hops (pellets)
 Sierra Nevada Yeast starter (yeast originally obtained from the
 Frederick brewing company)
 
 I did a single-step infusion mash.  In a five gallon stainless steel
 pot, I heated 2 gallons of water to 170 degrees F. To this was added
 the crushed grains...the temperature then fell to 156 degrees F.  I put
 the lid on and was surprised at how long the temp kept steady!  I measured
 the temp with a thermometer (an essential requirement), and when it fell
 two degrees, I cranked the heat on for a few minutes (gas stove).  While
 stirring constantly, the temp went back up to 156 degrees in a matter of
 moments.  After one hour, an iodine test revealed conversion to sugar.
 BTW, I bought the iodine at a local pharmacy for $1.29.  In another pot,
 I had three gallons of water at 170 degrees F.  After starch conversion,
 with the help of my lovely (and tolerant) wife, I proceeded to pour
 the mash through a large kitchen strainer into a clean bucket.  The
 grain was poured through the strainer a little at a time and rinsed a bit
 with some of the 170 degree sparge water.  The spent grains were then placed
 temporarily into another pot.  When all the grains were drained and rinsed
 once,I added the rest of the sparge water to the grains, swished it around,
 and poured the gamish-mash through the strainer again.  Yes, a lauter-tun
 was borrowed from a friend (a plastic bucket from the hardware store with
 a bunch of holes drilled through it) and was used to strain anything
 remaining in the pre-wort.
         At this point I had about 5 gallons of wort.  I poured this into
 my 5 gallon pot, and it came up to the tippy-top, leaving no room for
 boiling, etc.  So, I merely poured about half of the wort into another
 pot!  These were brought to a boil, and 0.5 ounces of Cascades were added
 to one pot and boiled for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes, half of the
 Williamettes were added, and boiling continued.  After another 30 minutes,
 the heat was turned off and the remaining Williamettes were added.
 I put the pots into my bathtub filled with cold water.  Because the
 heat from the pots rapidly warmed the bath water, after about 10 minutes
 I drained the tub, filled it again with cold water, and added some ice.
 Of course, I kept the lids on the pots the whole time so as not to allow
 the green fuzzy things growing on the walls of the bathtub to get into
 my precious wort (just kidding about the green fuzzy things...we keep
 a clean bathroom!).  I made it to 70 degrees in about 40 minutes.
 The contents of the pots were then strained into an anxiously-awaiting
 glass carboy.  I brought the volume up to almost 6 gallons with cold water,
 and then pitched the yeast.  Tonight I transfer to a secondary, adding
 1 ounce of Cascades to dry-hop, and then wait 'till early next week
 to bottle.
         If anyone wants more details, please send email and I will try
 to help you out.  By the way, many of you helped me figure out my
 extraction rate (37*6/8.6=25.8 pts/lb/gallon, not bad for a first try!).
 Thanks so much for everyone's advice/help.
         I hope that my use of bandwidth had inspired many of you to
 just do it.  I love to cook, and spending an extra 2 hours over my
 brewpot was therapeutic for me.  A few of you had also written to
 me stating that you have aversions to liquid yeast.  Go for it, I
 say!  Your beer will be much better.  I have successfully cultured
 yeast for several months now, and now I have collected several
 different strains from local brewpubs and microbreweries.  It takes
 very little extra work/time, and it is well worth it.  Besides, it's
 sort of cool to tour your local micro and ask for some of their
 yeast!  What a hobby!  What a country!  I love beer!
         Sorry, I got carried away.  Anyway, I will let all of
 you know how my beer turns out.  I suspect that it will be
 tasty and well worth the extra effort.
         Until next time..."Keep your feet on the ground and keep
 reaching for that bottle of homebrew".

Subject:       Light Beer




Several days ago, somebody (I believe pneumand`at`delphi.com) asked a 
question about brewing lighter beers.  While I haven't tried the 
method, last year's summer (or maybe fall) Zymurgy edition has an 
article on one method for doing it.  The article was called 
"Quarterbock".  It recommended making a bock beer (initial SG 1.080), 
letting it fully ferment, and then diluting it with water during the 
bottling process.  This way, your lite beer has more flavor since it 
has all of the tasty products made during the initial stages of 
fermenting a high alcohol beer.  It sounds like a reasonable process 
for getting more flavor into a low alcohol beer, and should be worth 
the try.

A couple of things: your buddy was most likely drinking dunkelweizen
(readily available in the U.S.), which is a dark wheat beer (not *real*
dark, but considerably darker than the usual).  They can get their color
from a number of methods (see Eric Warner).


You are apparently under the misimpression that the Rh***bot (don't ask
me to spell it!) forbids dark grains.  The restriction is that they use
malted barley, but there's nothing against roasting the barley once
malted.  In fact, some dunkelweizens even use roasted malted wheat.

One of the advantages of using flaked maize is that you do not need to
cook it, but I'm a little non-plused when I read something like "can you
use X with extracts or does it need to be mashed?"  What exactly do you
*do* with any adjunct if not a mash?  Even a pseudo-mash?  Surely you
aren't actually boiling this stuff, ala CP?  


Try doing a simple infusion of grains -- whether caramel malts or flaked
wheat -- for 45 minutes or so at 150, then rinse them and add all the
liquid to your pot and add the extract to that.


Personally, I think flaked maize is one of brewing's golden secrets, and
have used it in very good (really!) lagers, abbeybiers and pale ales.
But syrup?  I guess I'm still something of a bigot and I'll let them use
syrup in glop like malt liquors -- not in my beer, thanks!

I'm brewing a Pecan Ale tonight. I got the original recipe from John Pratte. 
He had a couple of methods to add the pecans but I've chosen to make a small 
side batch of unhopped wort (1# amber extract and 2 cups water) while I'm 
doing the specialty grains (Crystal and Chocolate malts). After boiling the 
mini-wort, I'll put a cup or so of chopped pecans into it and let it steep a 
while. When the main wort is finished, I'll strain out the nuts and pour the 
mini-wort in with the rest of the wort. Since the mini-wort was unhopped, I 
can now roast the pecans and snack on them while waiting for the "Main 
Event" to finish fermenting.

After several years, my nextdoor neighboor has decided that brewing beer
in my kitchen produces noxious odors in the hallway between our units.  It's
always been my understanding that brewing is a form of cooking food, which
can not be legislated or restriced if done in one's home.


However, I believe he's trying to use his current position as vice-president
of our condominium association to get it to impose restrictions or prevent
my brewing beer in my kitchen.   Consequently, I think I need some specific
legal advice, and maybe the name of an attourney in the SF bay area
(preferably a homebrewer).   Thanks in advance

Subject:       The uses of "Malta Goya"


Two days ago I bought from my local grocery store a bottle of
"Malta Goya" (33 cents) and when I tasted it at home I thought
"Gosh, this stuff actually tastes and smells like real wort!".
The label said that is made from "Barley Malt, corn sugar, and
choicest hops" sounds familiar?
Anyway, this beverage is very sweet and I was thinking if
somebody has any experience in using it as either part of your
wort or as a priming agent.  Another use would be as a yeast
culture solution.
Anyway, if you want to explain somebody what  "wort" is and how 
smells, save yorself some time and money and buy malta Goya.

I picked up a 6 1/2 gallon glass carboy because the stout recipe

time passes?


Or should I just spring for another bottle?  My hobby is starting

Yes, roasted malts (black patent and chocolate) are OK. Roasted barley is
not. Dave probably had a Bavarian Dunkelweizen.

Dan Woods ask about dark German wheat beers:


It is not *roasted* grain per say that is not allowed under the 
Reiheitsgebot, but *unmalted* grain. So a roased malt (like chocalate 
malt, etc.) would be OK, but roasted unmalted barley (as used in stouts)
would not. And yes, Dunkleweizen beers are to be found in Germany.

Wow!  I'm so humbled...  I guess there is life out there in the net


The response for requests for the Scotch Ale recipe was large
enough to post so,


First of all the recipe is constantly being modified and played with.
A lot of the times, I change a hop, modify a temp, change a specialty
malt, or something.  But the base usually is the same.  If any of you
saw my article in the Winter '93 issue of Zymurgy on hop tables then you saw
one of the versions of the recipe.  The recipe is all grain, but I suppose
if you substitute light or pale malt extract for the base grain, and use
the specialty malts as is, you will come close.


First the recipe I talked about in the post.


 15 lbs  Belgium Pale Ale
  1 lb   Crystal 40L
1/4 lb   Roasted Barley


  Water adjustments (for Chicago Water)
  1/2 Tsp Salt
  1 1/2 tsp Gypsum


I use the salt for chloride ions.  I'm no expert on water treatments so
don't ask me why.  I read that chloride helps to round out the flavor, so
I add it.  I'm not even sure it makes a difference.


Mash 152F 60 Minutes
     168F 10 Minutes (Mash out, to raise the temp for sparge, mostly)


Hops :
1 oz Perle 6.8% (P)
2 oz Fuggle 3.6% (F)


Min  P     F       <---- If you have trouble with this hop schedule table,
60  3/4                  Read my article :-)
45  1/4   1/2

15        1/2
F         1/2

I got a poor extraction rate on this recipe for some reason, if you do
better, expect a much higher OG or drop the base malt a few pounds.
For example, look at the next recipe, which is the base recipe.


 -------------------------------


12 lbs English Pale Ale
 1 lb CaraPils
 1 lb Crystal 40L

      149F 45 Min
      158F 45 Min

The purity law has no prohibition on using dark grains, as long as they are

1 liter = 1000g so 1 mg/l = 1 ppm.  The next question is harder since you must
know how many mg of Cl/oz.  Bleach is usually "5.25% Sodium hypochlorite."
(.0525 g/ml)*(35 parts Cl/107 parts NaHClO3)*(29 ml/oz) = .49 g Cl/oz
If you want 1 gallon of 100 ppm you need (3.8l*100mg/l)/(490 mg Cl/oz)=0.77 oz


My only reservation here is the conversion to free chlorine, which I have
assumed to be 100%.


Isn't chlorine much safer for SS at high pH?  Isn't this why CTSP is a common
cleaning/sanitizing agent?

I think you would be better off going with syrup (or just plain corn sugar)
as a source of corn if you don't want to mash.  Most of the carbohydrate 
of the corn will be starch, which you don't want in your wort.  Why not
do a minimash with as much palt malt as corn?

There are often posts about oxygen needs for these cookers.  I just happened
to be looking at the 1991 Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifies 50 cubic
feet of free air space per 1000 Btu/hour.  What this doesn't speak to is
the venting of the carbon monoxide.  Just a data point.

Subject: Re: California Common Ale


Hi, I'm new at this email thing and at homebrewing.  I've so far brewed 4 
batches of reasonably decent beer and a crisp hard cider.  Right now I 
have a "Steam Beer"TM in bottles and am wondering if I haven't 
experienced my first major setback.  I used an amber extract and a couple 
pounds of various lovibond crystal malt for complexity.  I hopped 
heavily, 2 oz boil, 1 oz finishing, and .5 oz dry hopping 2 days before 
bottling.  I used WYeast California Common liquid lager yeast, which is 
supposed to behave well at temperatures below 62 F.  The initial 
fermentaion went well, racked over to secondary after 5 days, let stand 
in secondary about 10 days.  I primed with about 2/3 c corn sugar at 
bottling and came out with 50+ bottles.  The green beer was a bit sweet, 
but nice hoppiness and full body.  Everything appeared to be on track to 
my inexperienced eye.  After 2 1/2 weeks in the bottle, the beer is 
almost completely lacking carbonation.  I have sediment at the bottom and 
the beer is a beautiful, amber color.  I know I'm impatient but I wanted 
to drink my beer.  After 1 1/2 weeks, the beer was flat and sweet, and I 
went and added Windsor dry ale yeast to several bottles to see if I 
couldn't pick up the carbonation.  Nothing.  I admit that the 
fermentation temp has been above 62 F for most of the time, but shouldn't 
the ale yeast have taken off?  How long should I expect to wait before 
this beer should be carbonated and drinkable?  Or does it sound as if 
this beer has failed?  What should I do to save my precious 5 gal?  As 
Papazian says, maybe I have ruined my beer by worrying, but I was excited 
about this brew and want it to be ready in another 2 1/2 weeks for a 
special occasion.  Any advice is welcome and greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

1.  I just read Peter's notice regarding the new brewpub.  We are supposedly

In HBD # Dan Wood asked how to measure/monitor the pressure in a keg.


Here are plans for a Keg Pressure Tester and Relief Valve that you can attach to
your soda kegs to read the internal pressure.  It is similar to one that was
described by Dan Fink in an issue of Zymurgy.  It has multiple uses.  You can
check keg pressure with it, to see if your keg has developed a leak, or to see
if CO2 is going into solution.  (Note:  the valve on a CO2 regulator doesn't
perform this function.  It tells you how much CO2 the regulator will attempt to
place in the keg when it is attached).  You can use it to bleed pressure from
the keg via the needle valve, if your keg is old and doesn't have a pressure
relief valve built in (not recommended).  If you are transferring beer from one
sealed keg to another, you can crack the needle valve just barely to allow
built-up pressure in the receiving keg to escape slowly.  Otherwise, when
pressure was equal in both kegs, the transfer would stop.

          Finally, when I do partial mashes, there is a lot of
          water/wort in the grains after sparging (crudely, with a
          ladle and a collander).  In full scale, efficient sparging,
          should I a) stop adding water and recover the final runnings
          by draining the grains "dry" or b) keep adding sparge water
          to the top until the end and leave the grins "wet".  Thanks

Subject:       nerdy ramblings on nomenclature and sanitizers...


John Palmer asked for clarification on ppm vs mg/l.  Here's my 
attempt at making a mountain out of a mole-hill (chemists, get it?).  
I'm a real thrill at cocktail parties.  YAWN.


Parts per million is a common unit of measurement for expressing trace 
concentrations of the quantity of an analyte with respect to the 
weight of a sample. This can be expressed many ways as on a wt/wt 
basis, wt/vol, or vol/vol.  Each expression has its associated 
nomenclature.  All the below express parts per million or ppm:
wt/wt   = mg/kg or ug/g
wt/vol  = mg/l or ug/ml
vol/vol = ul/l or nl/ml


The easiest way to make sense of this is to equate ppm with mg/l, 
though this may technically get you in trouble with some really picky 
analytical chemists.  Unfortunately, there is no other kind (JUST 
KIDDING).


Sanitizers and you.  Listed below are 4 methods of sanitizing (not 
necessarily STERILIZING) equipment based upon the Minnesota 
Department of Health food sanitation code.  Your mileage may vary.


1.)  Immersion for a period of 30 seconds in clean water of at least 
170 degrees F.


2.)  Immersion for not less than 1 minute in 75 degree or warmer 
water containing:
    a)  not less than 50 ppm of free available chlorine if 
hypochlorites (bleach) are used.
    b)  not less than 200 ppm if chloramines are used.
    c)  not less than 50 ppm if trichloromelamine is used.


3.)  Immersion for not less than 1 minute in 75 F or higher water 
containing not less than 12.5 ppm available iodine in a solution 
having a pH not higher than 5.0


4.)  Immersion for at least one minute in water of 110-130 F 
containing not less than 200 ppm and not more than 400 ppm of a 
quaternary ammonium solution.


What does all this really boil down to?  Start with perfectly clean 
equipment, sanitize with boiling water or bleach.  If bleach is used, 
shoot for 50 to 100 ppm (get your test papers!) which is a capful or 
two per gallon.  Rinse off the sanitizer with boiled water.  I think 
about 800 zillion other people have said this but its simple and 
works.  My personal opinion is to not fiddle with all the other stuff.


Usual Disclaimer:  I'll deny everything.  You're all adults, make up 
your own mind.  All opinions expressed are strictly my own, not the 
MN Dept of Health, Clorox Inc., or those 800 zillion other people.
