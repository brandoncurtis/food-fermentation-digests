WARNING! Long message to follow...




Following is a summary of the recipes which I received when I put out the
call for all to submit...in exchange, I would like to hear from everybody
about the sources where I can obtain the (obscure) ingredients called
for...thanks to those who submitted these!


#1)


INGREDIENTS:
 5 qt water                             1/4 oz hops
 1/2 oz burdock root, dried             1/2 oz yellow dock root, dried
 1/2 oz sarsaparilla root, dried        1/2 oz sassafras root, dried
 1/2 oz spikenard root, dried*          1 1/2 cup sugar
 1/8 tsp yeast, granulated


PROCEDURE:
 Simmer herbs in water for 30 minutes. Add sugar, stir to dissolve, and
 strain into a crock. Cool to lukewarm, add yeast, and stir well. Cover
 crock and leave to ferment for about an hour. Bottle and store in a cool
 place. Makes about one gallon.


*The American spikenard, Aralia racemosa, of the ginseng family, Araliaceae, 
is a plant native to the eastern United States. A decoction of the root was 
used by Indians for backache, rheumatoid arthritis, and coughing. 
 
 *** Notes included with the recipe:  "Root beer extracts, usually in
 an amount suitable for five gallons of beverage, are available from
 Hires, Schilling, and other herb and spice purveyors. These yield a
 drink that's very close in flavor to commercial root beers. Making
 your own infusions, however, allows for experimentation and a
 distinctive 'house' brew. Ours is less sweet than most."

    Heat slightly less (about 2 tablespoons) less than a pint of water
to about 110 degrees Farenheit (sp.?) (43 degrees C.).  Dissolve 
1/8 cup (one fluid ounce) of granulated white sugar, plus one tablespoon
of _Blackstrap_ molasses.  Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of root beer extract.
Add a pinch of yeast to the empty bottle, pour in the above mixture,
and cap.  Let ferment for 1 to two days at room temeprature.  Age
in the refrigerator for at least one day, preferably 3 to four.
- ----------


    The above is rather primitive, since I can't drink or give away
gallons worth of root beer.  I prefer to make it by the bottle as
the mod strikes.  The blackstrapp molasses gives the root beer a
very dark flavor, and the heavy taste of real blackstrapp mollasses
is offset by the sugar.

Standard Book of Formulas_, by Harry Bennett, copyright 1938 by

                                        OLD FASHIONED ROOT BEER


"Use strong bottles with patent stoppers or tie corks in securely. Use a stone
crock or granite vessell in which to let drinks stand while 'working.' Fresh
roots from the woods are always preferable to dried herbs. Select a cool place
in which to store the drinks; the longer they stand in a warm place after
bottling, the more effervescent they will become! When filling bottles, fill to
within an inch of the top.


1 cake compressed yeast                                 5 pounds sugar
2 ounces Sassafras root                                         1 ounce
Hops or Ginger Root
2 ounces Juniper Berries                                                4
gallons water
1 ounce Dandelion root                                          2 ounces
Wintergreen


Wash roots well in cold water. Add juniper berries (crushed) and hops. Pour 8
quarts boiling water over root mixture and boil slowly 20 minutes. Strain
through flannel bag. Add sugar and remaining 8 quarts water. Allow to stand
until lukewarm. Dissolve yeast in a little cool water. Add to root liquid. Stir
will. Let settle then strain again and bottle. Cork tightly. Keep in a warm room
5 to 6 hours, then store in a cool place. Put on ice as required for use."

These recipes come from:  The Scientific American Cyclopedia of Formulas,
edited by Albert A. Hopkins {query editor of the "Scientific American"}
New York, Scientific American Publishing Company, 1921


Root Beer--1.--To 5 gal. of boiling water add 1 1/2 gal. of molasses.
Allow it to stand for 3 hours, then add bruised sassafras bark,
wintergreen bark, sarsaparilla root, of each 1/4 lb., and 1/2 pt. of fresh
yeast, water enough to make 15 to 17 gal.  After this has fermented for 12
hours it can be drawn off and bottled.
  2.--Pour boiling water on 2 1/2 oz. sassafras, 1 1/2 oz. wild cherry
bark, 2 1/2 oz. allspice, 2 1/2 oz. wintergreen bark, 1/2 oz. hops, 1/2
oz. coriander seed, 2 gal. molasses.  Let the mixture stand 1 day.
Strain, add 1 pt. yeast, enough water to make 15 gal.  This beer may be
bottled the following day.
  3.--Sarsaparilla, 1 lb.; spicewood, 1/4 lb.; guaiacum chips, 1/2 lb.;
birch bark, 1/8 lb.; ginger, 1/4 oz.; sassafras, 2 oz.; prickly ash bark,
1/4 oz.; hops 1/2 oz.  Boil for 12 hours over a moderate fire with
sufficient water, so that the remainder shall measure 3 gal., to which add
tincture of ginger, 4 oz.; oil of wintergreen, 1/2 oz.; alcohol, 1 pt.
This prevents fermentation.  To make root beer, take of this decoction, 1
qt.; molasses, 8 oz.; water 2 1/2 gal.; yeast 4 oz.  This will soon
ferment and produce a good, drinkable beverage.  The root beer should be
mixed, in warm weather, the evening before it is used, and can be kept for
use either bottled or drawn by a common beer pump.  Most people prefer a
small addition of wild cherry bitters or hot drops to the above beer.

About sassafras...  My 1930 Merck's Index, 4th ed., says that sassafras
is supplied as either the root or bark of the root.  If the current
sassafras bark is from the trunk, then it's not the stuff in the old
recipes.  Sassafras root, oil, etc. is a federally controlled substance
because of the presence of safarol and iso-safarol [sp? they may end with
an 'e'].  As I recall, it was placed on the federal list in 1977-8.  It is
toxic to the liver as well as carcinogenic.  Oil of sassafras smells very
much like root beer, but not as strongly as modern root beer extract.  My
hunch is that the taste and aroma that you want are volatile oils and not
the safarol.  I wouldn't choose to drink safarol, but others might...

Hi All! I have no affiliation with the hospice, but my friend works 
there, so I thought a shameless plug for their fundraiser was in order:


        The 8th Annual California Festival of Beers is a benefit for Hospice of 
San Luis Obispo County.  It will take place on Saturday, May 28, from 11 
to 3 at the Avila Beach Resort and Golf Course.  About 55 Calif. 
microbreweries will be represented.  Ticket prices are $32.00 for tasting 
and $5 for designated drivers (about 80% of the proftis are a direct 
donation to Hospice's program).  
        There will also be two blues bands featured:  Emmy Mack and the Trim, 
and Big Daddy's Blues Band.  For $32, you receive a souvenir pilsner glass and 
twenty-five tasting tickets (more avail. at Festival).  Designated driver 
tickets are $5 and include lunch and soft drinks.

had finally given up when the truckload showed up unannounced.  It looks
like the company that makes the Glatt, while they make a very precise 
product, is a bit casual in their business practices.  It IS worth the

Subject: Re: Using corks


There have been a couple of posts lately about using wine bottles for
bottling beer.  At the risk of sounding like an alarmist, I would not
recommend it.  Wine bottles are made for still, not carbonated,
beverages.  In my wine-making days of the mid-70s, there was a lot of
attention given in the texts of that time to making sure your wine had
fermented out before bottling so that you would not get bottle bombs (as
well as the problems of getting a sparkling wine instead of a still one
and having yeasties in the bottle).  Someone mentioned earlier that you
would not be able to get the bails (wires) to hold on to the wine
bottles but there is a good chance that the bottle would go first.


You can use champagne bottle if you want to bottle in fifth sized
bottles.  The plastic stoppers and bails are readily available and many
of the american "champagne" bottles will take a standard cap.


That said:


 * I don't know that wine bottles are appreciatively thinner than beer
   bottles but they might be


 * There was (is?) a wine bottle opener on the market that worked by
   pumping air into the bottle until the cork came out so they must be
   able to deal with some pressure.  I did hear of an anecdote where a
   Mateus bottle blew up using this device.  This was presumably due to
   the strange shape of a Mateus bottle and the uneven distribution of
   the pressure.


 * The manufacturers of my mini-kegs say to use less priming sugar when
   priming the kegs because it is a larger volume and less is needed.
   These are equivalent to ~10 bottles and take 1/2 the priming.  Who
   knows how to adjust for a wine bottle.


The bottom line:
I would recommend steering away from wine bottles and using champagne
bottles or big beer bottles if you want more than a 12 oz. bottle.  Oh,
people have also had success with the 1l and 2l PET bottles.  Some of
the British breweries distribute that way too.

Subject: Re: Parallel Yeast Cultures




It must have been in the moon last week to try parallel yeast cultures with
Wyeast 1056 - I did the same thing, the same way!  Right now I have a batch
using one of the starters - when I bottled the other starters I also brewed
a batch of American Ale.  I have always believed that Ale yeast should be
stored at fridge temps ( below 50F ) to make it go into hibernation.  I
stored my 5 bottles of starter in the frige, upright, in the back.  This is
based on what I've successfully done with saving the trub from
primary/secondary for repitching.  I've always stored the trub in a canning
jar in the fridge, for up to 1 1/2 months, then created a starter and
repitched.  Never had any problems with this.
 
I'd be interested in any "scientific" based or yeast expert based opinions
you get.  I'm not an expert, but just seem to go with what works and makes
sense to me.
 
Good Brewing,
 
Frank
 
P.S. - Isn't it nice that using parallel yeast culturing has lowered the
cost of yeast from $3.50 a batch to $0.58 !  And that doesn't include trub
repitching !

Subject: Anchor Liberty Clone responses




I had several questions about the recipe so I'm re-posting with more detail.


Anchor Liberty Clone


6 lbs. Northwestern Pale liquid X
1 lbs.  Lagglander Pale dry X
1/2  lbs. Crystal 40L
1/2  lbs. Toasted 25L
3 oz. Cascade (whole leaf)  5.5%,  60min  (Partial Boil)
1 oz. Cascade (whole leaf) dry hop , one week
1 tsp. gypsum
1tsp Irish Moss
Wyeast London


start gravity 1.053
end gravity  1.010


If I were to use only  1/2 oz. dry hop I think they would be identical.


Primary ferment was one week at 68 degrees.  Secondary ferment was one week. 


For the dry hop I just threw them in the secondary.   The hops float so you 
can siphon from underneath them.   The longer you dry hop the more the hops 
get "water logged" and start to sink.  You may want to try 5 days instead of 
7.  When I transferred it to the bottling bucket I did get some hops in 
there.  Wracking to a second bottling bucket might help but I was to lazy. 
   I did waste a little more beer than usual during bottling  trying to 
avoid the hops.   It is worth the extra effort to use whole hops.  The hop 
nose is awsome.


If you  do a full boil, you may want to cut back on the bittering hops a 
bit.  Mine was nicely bitter (maybe a bit more than Liberty).

I agree! I have used flaked maize on several occasions over the years with
very good results. I mostly use it in light lagers. Once I made a lager that
used about 2 pounds in 10 gallons. The beer was light on hops and
brilliantly clear and very pale. I friend was over and I poured him one and
said "what do you think?". He said "it tastes like Budwieser". At first I
was pissed, then I sort of set back and thought about what he had said and
why I brewed the beer to start with. I had both failed and succeeded. I had
proved one of the things I set out to prove, that I could brew a beer
without flavor flaws and defects. There isn't much to hide behind in this
style of beer. However I had brewed a beer I could go out and buy cheaper
than I could make. Since then I have brewed this style of beer on occasion
only with more malt and alittle more hops. Sort of a high test Bud. Probably
pretty close to the real Budvar. Give flaked maize a try, in small amounts

About the dark colors in German brewing and the use of dark malted
grains; just wanted to add that many German brewers use a dark
extract syrup added directly to the kettle in order to darken the
beer without using dark malt.  I personnaly dislike the practice, 
but plenty of good beers are made this way.  And dont forget that
these same anal brewers also use concentrated hop extracts for
the bittering hops.  Its a really involved industrial extraction 
process whereby raw hops are pulverized and using solvents, the
hop oils are extracted and condensed, then packaged in tins.  The
resulting oil is about as thick as 90 weight gear lube.

This is suprising.  I was under the impression that iodophors 
should be used in cold water.  Same with chlorine. Now I guess 
75F is not real warm, but if the standard says "or higher", I
am confused, or misinformed.  Any chemists want to add to this

Raise your glasses HBDer's,


        It doesn't seem that long, but this will have to be good bye
for now.  I am now leaving my choosen institution of higher learning
for the real world (hopefully more money to brew with) and will have
to give up my email account!  So before I leave I wanted to share a
recipe with you.  It's flavor reminds me of SNPA and has the color of
Bass.  I hope some of you might be able to get ideas from it.




F.A. B. Pale Ale American        (First Ames Brew)


7   lbs pale malt
1   lb Munich malt
1   lb special roast malt (45L)
1/4 lb crystal malt (40L)
1/2 lb wheat malt
1/4 lb dextrine malt
1/8 lb black patent
1   oz cascade hops 5.5% AA (1 hour)
1   oz tettnang hops 3.8% AA (1 hour)
3/4 oz hallertauer 2.6% AA (1/2 hour)
3/4 oz hallertauer 2.6% AA (10 minutes)
water up to five gallons
1/2 cup corn sugar priming
Wyeast American Ale #1056




        This was the first beer I brewed when I moved back to Ames, IA
hence its name.  But enough of that.  Crush all grains and add to hot
tap water (approximately 2.5 gallons).  Let mash set for 15 minutes.
Raise temperature to 122 F for protein rest and hold for 35 minutes.
Add 3/4 gallon of boiling water to bring mash to 140 F, hold for 30
minutes.  Add additional 3/4 gallon of boiling water to bring
temperature up to 155 F.  Hold at this temperature for 1 hour.  Sparge
till your hearts content and begin boil.  Boil hops for indicated
times (I put the hops in boiling bags).  After 1 hour, stop boil and
chill wort and siphon into primary fermenter.  Pitch yeast from
starter.


        That all there is to it.  Well, I hope my future employer has
internet access or else I will have to get some service so that I can
get my HBD!

3) I have an 8 gal ceramic plated "canning" pot, that has a spot of rust on the

Sparge water pot? Is there a way to protect my beer/water from this rust spot?

I'm not a lawyer, but let me take a crack at this...


First, WEBSTER'S II New Riverside University Dictionary defines noxious 
as 1)injurious to physical health or 2) harmful to the mind or morals.


I think it,s fairly obvious to even the layman that the first definition 
would be tough to prove.  No matter which side has the "burden of proof," 


the homebrew side has a slight advantage here (all-natural).  


The second definition is a little tougher.  Mind/Morals?  If beer is 
against either, there might be an argument.  But, then, we're talking 
about wort, not beer in this instance!  (Another plus for Jack!)


So much for the humorous side, let's get to it....


Brewing, home/micro/whatever, is legislatable (as is everything, just 
don't mention air around a politician, it's still free!).


FEDS:
The federal gov't requires their take(tax) on household production IN 
EXCESS OF (and someone please correct me if I am wrong) 200 
gallons/household/year or 100 gallons/person/year. NOTE: Both apply, you 
do the math.  Also, it's been a few years since I checked the numbers, 
but I think these still apply.


STATE:
State laws in this respect are a little tougher.  I can only tell you 
that Delaware definitely does not have such a "homebrew" limit.  I know 
this solely because I asked my local state congressman to find out, and 
he did.
You may want to contact either your state representative or senator (or 
the CA equiv.)


Or maybe you should offer some homebrew to the $*#&, uh, gentleperson.  
Who knows, you might wind up with a brew-partner!

Yes indeed Wyeast #1338 is Weihenstephan 338, but I don't agree that it
produces too much clove.  I've tasted a great number of beers made with
this yeast and feel that it does not have a significant phenolic character.
The only explanations that I can offer for Miller's comment on p.215 of
TCHOHB, are that either he got a wild yeast in the fermenter along with
the cultured yeast or he fermented at a higher temperature than he should
have.  Now, don't say, "Miller?  A wild yeast infection?"  Recall that in
the same book, he suggests starting a siphon by sucking on it with your
mouth.  Although this is more an invitation for a lactobacillus infection,
it indicates that there was at least one weak link even in Dave Miller's
process at the time.  I'm quite sure that he uses pumps at the brewery now.


**********


With all the recent talk of rocket engine cookers, I'd like to offer one
piece of advise: get one that has an adjustable air intake.  If you don't
the cooker you get will be optimized for high-throttle burning and will
not burn efficiently at lower settings.

Steeping caramel malts is great, but steeping flaked wheat or barley or
corn by itself is going to give you nothing more than huge hot and cold
breaks and a starch haze.  You *must* mash all grains except for crystal
and the dark roasted grains (which cover up their own starch haze).  Note
that the flaked grains don't have any enzymes (and it looks to me as if
they don't have much husk either) so you must mash them along with some
enzymatic malt such as pale ale or pils malt.


*********
Tom writes:
>bucket.  Anyway, is it a definite bad idea to lager in plastic,


Yes, definately a bad idea.  The plastic pail is oxygen-permiable
and thus the alcohols in the finished beer will oxidize to aldehydes
giving you all sorts of off-flavors.  Buy more glass or lager in a
Cornelius Keg!

and then proceeds to give the times, temperatures and concentrations
of the various methods.  With all due respect to the MN DoH, I think
that the contact times for our (brewing) purposes should be longer.
I've read times like 10 minutes and 15 minutes.  I'll bet it has a
lot to do with the fact that a couple million lactobacilli on a fork
is not going to kill anyone, whereas in our case, it could (depending
on the vigor of your yeast starter) result in off-flavors in the
finished beer.

Subject: Spargatron


Todd asks about sparging with a coffee maker...
I think it was Ed Hitchcock that first wrote about the
Spargatron.  (are you still out there Ed?)  I howled when I
read it and dug up an old element that I knew I was saving
for a good reason.  I just use mine to run boiling water through
my counterflow chiller prior to use. I dont use it to sparge
because of two potential problems, chlorine and temperature
control.  If youre using tap water like me, the coffee maker
element would heat up the water but not evaporate the chlorine.
I usually fill my mid-sized pot with 20L of tap water the night
before brewing and turn the electric stove on low.  By morning,
its gently steaming at 75 degrees C and the chlorine is gone.
While 75 isnt a magic number, if the sparge liquor is much
hotter you will extract more of the dreaded tannins.  If its
much cooler, the lautering will run slower and possibly less
efficiently.  I found it hard to hit a constant temperature
between blazing hot and tepid with the coffee maker element.
I settle for blazing hot and use it to sanitize my chiller.


I did decide to decrease the volume between the two buckets
in my zapap tun.  If you trim off the lowest ring around the
inside bucket, it will sit lower in the outside bucket.  This
reduces the dead space and also the amount of wort that seeps
between them because it makes for a tighter fit.


With respect to the question of wasting water where there is no
shortage,  Id say its more a problem of wasted processing.
I have also wondered how big a deal this is.  Chlorine is
ultimately added to the lake and atmosphere. Energy is required
to pump and clean the water.  The Great Lakes are not drying up
but I wonder about the other aspects.

Subject: Bulk Grain Storage


I am getting tired of running off to the brew shop every time I want to
brew in order to pick up more grain, so I thought I would try buying
grain in bulk.  I already culture my own yeast and buy hops in quantity
(and if the growth of my hops so far is any indication, I should be able
to sustain myself for a good part of the year, assuming the psycho lawn
guys don't kill off the rest of the plants), but grain storage takes up
a lot more space, so I have pretty much kept only extra specialty grains
around.


Since it will take up a lot of space, I would probably need to keep the
grain either in the garage or on the back porch.  Either way, I would be
storing the grain uncrushed and sealed in those white plastic buckets.
What I wonder is if I am just asking for trouble.  I expect it will probably
get fairly warm during the summre.  Are hot temperatures going to adversely
affect the grain?  Am I going to have a bug colony growing in my grain?
Are the plastic buckets going to keep moisture out?  Is the cat going to
chew through the plastic to get to the grain?  Does anyone out there have
a grain silo they are looking to sell?


Thanks for any ideas.

Subject: Cals and Alc for OG vs FG




There are periodic requests on the HBD for calorie and % alcohol formulas. 
I've generated a number of ASCII charts (matrices) that some may find
useful.  There are 5 charts, % Alc by volume, % Alc by weight, Calories
from Alc, Calories from Wort, and Total Calories.  They are all matrices
of OG (1.030 - 1.100) by FG (1.000 - 1.030) in 0.001 increments. 


They have been concatenated into a single file named "charts.all" and
uploaded to sierra.stanford.edu pub/incoming.  My guess is that it will
end up in the pub/homebrew/docs directory.  Each chart will fit on about
1.5 landscape pages of 6 pt Courier font.  You will need to separate them
or add form feeds between charts.


All the formulas are from George Fix who attributes them to the European
Brewing Congress (EBC).  If you want the details I can send them by
private email.
