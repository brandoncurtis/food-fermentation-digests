Jack doesn't recommend motorizing the mill.

Subject: What about more COMMON yeasts?


I'm new to the list (and to the Usenet homebrew news-scene as well), though
I've done a little Mead and a couple micro-batches of Dandelion wine...


The folks brewing beer seem to know best about *YEAST*, so I thought I'd
ask here:


        Why all the fancy yeast?


With all the hubbub about virtues and pitfalls of different yeasts, I'm
almost ashamed to admit that the only yeast *I've* ever used was Red Star
Dry Active Yeast from the baking section of the nearest grocery.  Are these
named-and-numbered yeasts really that much better?


{By Whom,Where,How} are different strains of yeast developed/found/isolated?


And what about wild yeast?  How would I start out, if I didn't have any
place to buy yeast from?  (Just curious, for historical interest.)


If the answers would read too much like an advanced course in microbiology,
I'll understand if you decide to blow these questions off.  Still, there
had to have been reliable means of doing this for brewers centuries ago to
brew decent beer... and they didn't know microbiology.


(BTW:  The baking yeast I've used is a bottom yeast, in case you wondered.)

Jeff B. admits that he uses Quaker Oats.   Good.   Now I'm looking for 
another confession.  Has anyone used horse feed in brewing?  I was in 
my sister's barn the other day and naturally walked over to the grains.  
There was cracked corn, raw oats and sweet feed.  Cracked corn sells 
for $.05/lb (no wonder the majors use the stuff).  Raw oats have a large 
amount of husk that should help in sparging.  Sweet feed contains 
various grains, molasses (?) and who knows what else-anyway it tasted 
good, sweet and the horses love it.  I am reasonably convinced that these 
grains are 100% consumable, some of these horse owners seem to love 
their animals better than their children. 


I suppose that the oats are the most useful (after cooking of course).  
Anyone had any experience?  I may try it in my next wit or lambik.  Hey!
maybe this is a new way to get that Lambic horseyness!

I was not.  In fact, I'll go you one further.  There are a few people 
on the digest who only want to see the things they want to see, and
berate the rest of the world when they see something they don't want to
see, claiming it wastes their precious time.


I for one, would like to see more commercial posts on the digest,
especially those that offer some truly new product, ie, Jack
Schmidlings Maltmill when it first came out, because I'd rather hear it
straight from the source than waiting however many months it takes to
get into print...it's just plain faster and more convenient.


Furthermore, I feel that the number of entrepreneurs on the net who
would take advantage of this would be far fewer in number than the
number of whiners who complain every time someone posts something they
don't like, and therefore waste a much smaller fraction of these
important peoples time...like I'm doing now.  I don't market any
commercial brewing goods, and I'm still willing to say I'd like to see
more innovative advertising on this digest in place of inane
complaints.

Subject:       "Big" all grain stout


Well folks, I've had excellent success with this recipe and thought I 
would share. I wanted to create a "big" stout, with lots of body and 
heavy on the "charred" flavor and lots of mouthy feel to it.


Ingredients:
   8 lbs American 2 row
   1 lb English Chocolate 
   1 lb English Black Patent
   1 lb English Crystal - 90 Lov
   Infusion mash `at`145 F for 1 hour
   2 oz Fin Goldings boiling
   2 oz Halluertau (sp?) boiling
   3 tps gypsum
   Wyeast Irish Lager 1024 (I think...sorry, can't remember the 
      Wyeast number.  I know it was the Irish lager though.)
   1/4 tsp. Irish Red Moss (old habits die hard)      
   2 week ferment
   Aged about 4 weeks
   
Results:
   OG: 1.10
   FG:  1.014


I noticed in Cats Meow a similar recipie, but it had about 1/2 the 
lbs. of specialty grains, none of which were the "English" 
variety, whatever "English" means.  This brew's results I found 
were excellent - although not entirely perfected because of the 
fermentation temp (65 F).  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Actually, at almost all of the beer tasting events I've ever been
involved with, the organizers get people from where ever they can.  To
put it in perspective, for the Colorado Brewer's Fest (which is held
here in Fort Collins, CO), they need about 400 servers.  The local
homebrew club has about 60 people involved.  Even if you add in the
number of people in the Denver and Boulder clubs, it's not enough to
cover that.  The breweries usually have nothing to do with the
organizing of the event.  They may have someone available to answer
questions, but they never arrange for their own servers.


Each year, as some of the same people work the event, they learn more.
I'm not sure what a better solution would be.  Even if the event
organizers put together a training class for servers (remember that most
of the organizers don't know much about beer either), you can't cram a
thorough history of brewing and beer styles into an hour or two and
expect it to stick.

I was in Edinburgh last November.  Excellent city, probably the best I saw
while in England/Scotland for 15 days.  There is a brick street, mainly for
walkers, that has lots of good places to check out.  On that street, there
is a small brewpub.  They do extract only and produce a good product (IMO).
I had a tour there - friendly folks, heavy scottish accent though.  Go check
them out - sorry I forget the name, someone in here might know the name! 
Also in Edinburgh, is Scottish-Newcastle.  Check out their tour too - it is a 
huge brewery, ala budweiser, but the folks are very friendly. You'll enjoy 
the aroma in Edinburgh - beer brewing (from the S-N brewery).


I'd go back to England in a moment's notice - a great place to tour around
and savoir many delicious pints of brew.

So, what advantage does this have over chilling the beer to 35F, and 
applying 25 psi for a shorter duration?  Seems like you are just making
yourself work more at higher temps since CO2 is much less soluable in
warmer liquids.  If the target is 35F, and X volumes, just get it there
and then apply the proper pressure.  And if you have a week or so to
wait, no shaking is required, just hook it up and let it sit around 30 
psi.

I use 5% raw oats from the health food store and do multiple protein rests

Before the wort is fermented, one needs to be very careful whith anything 
that contacts the wort.  When dealing with bacteria free still beer, the
risks are drastically reduced.  I just hold my hand (freshly sanitized
from cleaning too many kegs) over the end of the siphon and suck the 
hand instead of the hose. No big deal.

You need to realize the lead time required to publish this mag.  Feb was 
the deadline for articles to be printed in the Fall issue.  Not sure how
close the Ad deadline was to this but there is considerable layout work
required and I doubt the staffing is sufficient to allow faster turnaround

Not sure, but I hooked my maltmill to a 10.5" pulley and the motor to
a 3 " one.  Works fine.

I imagine that JS will respond here, but as far as I knew all standard MMs
use Orings to drive the passive roller.  Thats why I forked out the extra
money for the gear drive, esp. since I knew I would motorize it and drive 
about 7 times the "normal" malt quantities through it.  When you look at the
way the prices have increased on the Glatt, I imagine the choice is very close
and availability would seem to favor the MM.


Good brewing,

From: iogilvie`at`dmcs.dnd.ca (Ian Ogilvie)
Subject: Alternatives to Hops


        I've noticed a couple of postings lately in which people are looking for
alternatives to using hops in their beer (one poor soul being allergic, and one 
wishing to use wormwood), and I thought I would pass on a few bits of 
information.
        I won't talk about wormwood; there have already been a number of responses 
to the use of wormwood, the bottom line being DON'T!


        With respect to hop alternatives, "ale" was brewed in England with no hops 
prior to the 14th century. (It was only after soldiers returning from the 
Hundred 
Years War demanded the "biere" they had drunk in France, that the British 
began to 
use Hops). What was used was just about anything, the most frequently 
mentioned being 
nettles, rosemary, alecost (costmary), and even ground ivy. Some bittering 
agents 
included balsam, and sage, and or course, we still have recipes for spruce beer 
(although most still call for some hops)


        The following is an old recipe for Nettle Beer (which I have not tried so
I leave it to the adventurers amongst us).


        2 gal    young nettles        9 litres
        1/4 oz   ginger root          10 g
        4 lb      malt extract         1.8 kg
                   ale yeast
                   some blades of mace
                   a few cloves
        4 oz     sarsaparilla         100 g
        2 gal    water                9 litres
        1.5 lb   sugar                675 g
        2        lemons 


Method:


Wash young nettle tops and put into a saucepan with water, ginger, malt, 
spices, and 
sarsaparilla. Boil for 15 minutes. Pour this over the sugar in the primary 
fermentor.
Add the juice of the lemons and stir until the sugar is completely 
dissolved. Cool to 
70 F (20 C), pitch yeast and rack to the secondary after the fermentation 
has slowed.
(3-5 days). Secondary for 7-10 days. Prime and bottle as usual.


        All of the above notwithstanding, hops provide a unique flavouring and have
preservative qualities, so don't expect to be completely satisfied with the 
alternatives if you are a 'hophead'. However, if you DO like a malty brew, try
a few alternatives. (Nettles are reputed to be best in Stouts because they 
impart
a slightly salty taste which is found in most full-bodied beers)

Subject: Flaked Maize clarified, heh heh


A couple of people have pointed out to me that Al Korzonas may have been
referring to the idea of steeping flaked maize by itself, and that
without the presence of some malt, a starch haze could well result.
This is true, if that's what Al meant.  I admit, the idea of infusing
the maize alone never occurred to me.  Why would anyone do that?


So, to clarify: for extract beers, do a mini-infusion of grains
(including some malt) and adjuncts rather than boiling them in extract.


You may include small amounts of flaked grains without any problems.


Clear?

and asked him if he would put together the menu with the chef and serve as
MC.


Last week, I found out that there were still a number of places at the dinner
open. I asked the manager's permission to put the word out to the Chicago
Beer Society (normally only members and their guests are allowed) and he
agreed. Whether Charlie or CBS put it in the HBD, I don't know.


This most assuredly NOT a money-making venture. The manager  is a great foody
and wine person and just wants to expose his members to the variety of beer.
The club is losing money, even if this is sold out. I saw some empty seats
and thought some real beer folks might want a shot at them. Charlie just
wants to see it succeed.


This just in from the National Restaurant Association Show:
Gosser, a beer brewed in what was formerly East Germany is rolling out with
Shiftsbrau, which seems to be a really chewy dark Munich dunkel and a really
hopped Bavarian lager. Both were well made and (at least at the show) fresh.
Coors is doing seasonals including a wheat and (supposedly) a true Eisbock,
which I'm supposed to sample today.Genessee's microbrew division has come out
with a honey beer which is interesting. Nothing new at the Anchor or Sam
Adams booths, but I'm doing regular quality checks on the Old Foghorn
barleywine ale samples.

Malta is a very popular soft drink in Latin America (I've heard),
including Puerto Rico (from my experience).  It does indeed taste like
carbonated sweet wort; my Puerto Rican mother-in-law likes the taste
of my wort becase it tastes like malta.  I have a friend who likes to
make half-and-half malta and beer.


BTW, a "malta" is usually the 12-oz bottle.  A "maltita" is a
smaller, usually 6- or 8-oz bottle.

Subject: Alternatives to Hops


            I've noticed a couple of postings lately in which people are 
     looking for alternatives to hops. I thought I would offer a couple of
     tidbits. 
            Prior to the 14th century in England, "ale" was brewed with no 
     hops It was only after soldiers returning from the Hundred Years War 
     demanded the "biere" they had drunk in France, that the British began 
     to use Hops. What WAS used was just about anything, the most frequently 
     mentioned being nettles, rosemary, alecost (costmary), ground ivy, sage
     balsam, and of course spruce.
            The following is an old recipe for Nettle Beer (which I have not 
     tried, so I leave it to the adventurers amongst us).


             2 gal    young nettles        9 litres
             1/4 oz   ginger root          10 g
             4 lb     malt extract         1.8 kg
                      ale yeast
                      some blades of mace
                      a few cloves
             4 oz     sarsaparilla         100 g
             2 gal    water                9 litres
             1.5 lb   sugar                675 g
             2        lemons 


     Method:  Wash young nettle tops and put into a saucepan with water, 
     ginger, malt, spices, and sarsaparilla. Boil for 15 minutes. Pour 
     this over the sugar in the primary fermentor. Add the juice of the 
     lemons and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Cool to 
     70 F (20 C), pitch yeast and rack to the secondary after the fermentation 
     has slowed. (3-5 days). Secondary for 7-10 days. Prime and bottle as 
     usual.  


          All of the above notwithstanding, hops provide a unique flavouring 
     and have preservative qualities, so don't expect to be completely 
     satisfied with the alternatives if you are a 'hophead'. However, if 
     you DO like a malty brew, try some different spices and herbs. (Nettles 
     are reputed to be best in Stouts because they also impart
     a slightly salty taste which is found in most full-bodied beers)

Subject: "Common" problem?




Greetings fellow brewers:


In January I made a batch of "California common" beer using 6.5 lbs Munton &
Fison DME, .75 lb. 60L crystal malt steeped 20 min `at` 155 degF, 2.5 oz malto-
dextrine, 2 oz Northern Brewer whole hops, 1 tsp Irish moss, and Wyeast 2112. 
The yeast made into a 17 oz starter in a 22 oz bottle.  The boiled and chilled
(immersion) wort was transferred into the primary fermenter (glass) via
sanitized sauce pan and funnel with a screen.  The wort was aerated twice
(half and 3/4 full) by covering the opening with sanitized plastic wrap and
shaking until the carboy is full of foam.  The yeast was pitched at 68 degF
and fermentation was at 54 degF for 10 days primary and 13 days secondary. 
When pitching, I had to pour very slowly (due to the foam) and the starter ran
along the outside lip of the bottle.  I did not flame it or rub it with
alcohol.  OG was 1.062 and FG was 1.024.  


The primary fermentation was normal but the secondary looked cloudy and had
clumps of foam on the surface.  Churning was still visible within the wort. 
The previous batch I brewed had a similar look and turned out fine so I didn't
worry.  When I bottled (3/4 cup corn sugar) the beer tasted strangely sweet
and a bit green.  I can't think of any other flavor but strange to describe
it, not bad but strange, and not what I expected.  After a month in the bottle
the beer was clear and the green flavor went away the carbonation and body was
good but the strange sweetness was still there.  Now after 4 months, the beer
foams uncontrollably with large bubbles when poured into a glass, the body is
a little thinner, the flavor is about the same and there is a cloudy
precipitate that does not compact in the bottom of the bottles.  The foaming
only occurs when the beer is poured.  Now for the $10,000 question.  


                  ????? INFECTION ?????


I thought that most infections were evident at bottling time. There was
nothing unpleasant about the smell or flavor of the beer.  I use chlorine
bleach to sanitize my bottles and B-brite for everything else.  I store my
carboys filled with B-brite and have never had any problems with residue.  I
brew in the garage and do everything else in my basement.  I am careful to
sanitize everything and don't use my mouth to start the siphon ;).


One other question, is B-brite a cleaner, sanitizer, or both?  I think in
Miller's book, he says it is a cleaner but my Homebrew store says it is a good
sanitizer. 


Thanks for any advice,

Regular "Quaker Oats" style rolled oats are also fine for mashing.


Oats can be obtained as whole "groats", steel-cut, rolled, "quick cooking"
rolled, and as flour.  Whole oats and steel-cut oats (groats that have been
cut into little pieces) require cooking in order to gelatinize the starch and
make it available for the enzymes.  This adds an extra step to mashing and
possibly a sticky mess to deal with.  Whole oats can take an awfully long
time to thoroughly cook as well.  Rolled oats have been steamed and passed
through rollers.  The steaming softens the grain so that the rolling flattens
instead of breaking them; it also partially gelatinizes the starch.  This is
why you can eat rolled oats without cooking (e.g. museli).  "Quick cooking"
rolled oats are steel-cut oats that are then steamed and rolled.  The only
difference between these and the regular rolled oats is the size.  Because
they are smaller, thinner, they cook more quickly.  In terms of mashing,
they are really no better than the regular variety since they will be in the
mash-tun for tens of minutes.  Oat flour would gelatinize and mash very
nicely, but would probably cause sparging problems.

I have already done this and someone may benefit by my approach.  I
used a 1/20hp 1750 RPM motor which weighed about 4 lbs.  To gear it
down, the motor has a 1.5" pulley and the mill got a 9" pulley which
results in 291.6 RPM.  Why Greg has voided a warranty due to
motorization is that if something should wedge the rollers, the gears
will strip since they are just plastic.  To solve this problem, I
mounted the motor directly below the mill on a little shelf which is
attached to the stand by a hinge on one side only.  The weight of the
motor pulling down the shelf is what acts as a clutch on the V-belt.
If I grab the 9" pulley to simulate jamming the mill, the small pulley
will just spin on the belt.  Let loose and it goes again.  The weight
of the motor must be sufficient to push down on the V belt enough that
you can have grain between the rollers when stopped, and then turn on
the power and have the torque overcome the inertia.  Even with a
1/20hp motor, the reduction ratio provides plenty of torque to do
this, but if you do not have the right amount of weight, you do not
get enough friction on the belt.

Ok, I'll bite !!
I've been giving a lot of thought to the production of the before mentioned
Capt. Crunch with Crunch Berry Beer. I have formulated the following recipe:


8lb 2row malt
2lb Capt Crunch w/CB
1.5 oz Cascade (maybe Saaz) hops

Yes I said lager. This should be a fairly "light" brew with the flavor of the
CC comming out. 
One question of concern. The sugar added to cereal is the infamous cane sugar.
What affect is this going to have on the taste of such a light beer. Also, I
intend to mash the cereal with the grain.
My wife thinks I'm crazy to even try this. Who knows, maybe the big boys (AB,
Miller,etc) will want the recipe.;-}

Subject: Step Mashing Questions


Hi Group,
I have just acquired three Sankey kegs and was thinking of using them to build
a three tiered gravity fed system this summer. I was temporarily blinded by
sheer brewing lust (yep, y'all know what I mean) with regards to the mashing
system potential these three kegs give (Darth Vader and his Death Star have
nothing on three kegs in the hands of a homebrew engineer).


Anyhow, my question boils down to this: How useful is a propane fired,
insulated keg Mash/Lauter tun compared to a cooler? In other words, what will
Step Mashing capability really do for me?  Here is my data that lead to these
questions:


While reading Miller for Mashing Chemistry inputs to the Mashing FAQ, (yes, I
started it over the weekend, only a couple months to go...) I noticed that the
Acid Rest is not really used, The Protein Rest is only necessary when using
under-modified or unmalted grains (like Oats) AND that Alpha and Beta Amylase
enzymes work backwards to rising temperature. What I mean is that Alpha works
on breaking large sugar chains and likes higher mash temps (158F), while Beta
takes those shorter sugars and breaks those up into smaller more fermentable
sugars, but likes temps of around 140 although the Mash needs to be at least
149F for the starches to gelatinize so that the enzymes can work on them.


So, It would SEEM that the most fermentable Mash (Oats and Protein Rest aside)
would result from starting with a thicker mash to protect the enzymes (more
data from Miller) at a higher temp, say 156-8F and letting that cool, ie
un-insulated keg, over the hour to 150F or less before sparging to get the best
fermability profile out of the mash. With this scenario, it becomes apparent
that a Mashout would be needed to get the whole thing fluid again. Of course, a
mash conducted in this manner would have less residual sweetness, because the
beta would have broken down the more complex sugars from the Caramel Malt (if).
I guess it comes down to: What Style would I be trying to Brew?


I am looking for some comments from those of you who use these types of
systems, (Dion, Jim Busch, Jack, et Al). How do you make use of this
capability? Go ahead and post it, I think that this is good HBD material we can
put in the FAQ (along with the fifty thousand responses I have received
regarding Oats; I could grow a Horse! Thanks everyone).


PS. I got the kegs for 10 bucks each at a metal scrap yard, and they are in
really good shape!

Subject: zima or bud = headache






Hi.  It took me a long time to figure out why I could sometimes
have a screaming headache after a night drinking a 6-pack and some
times feel fine after consuming considerably more.  I narrowed it
down, finally, and found that after consuming as little as one
Budweiser/bud-light/bud-anything else I would surely wake up with
a screaming headache.  I now simply avoid Bud products and have no
problems.  Until last week...


Last week I decided that I would finally try a Zima.  Not bad if
you like Alka-Seltzer with lime.  Guess what.  Slamming headache
the next day.  


Correct me if I'm wrong:  Both Bud and Zima are made with rice
sugar.


This is the only thing that I can find that correlates between 
these two products which might be giving me a headache.  The 
experience really borders on an allergic reaction so I'm curious
if rice is the culprit and if there are any other products which
I should try to avoid.


Ideas?  Suggestions?
Thanks, Jason.

Subject: pH meters and adjustments for temperature


I've been looking around for pH meters recently and I have some questions.  The
meters that are in my budget that correct for temperature only work up to 120
degrees F, which make them pretty useless for brewing.  I want to be able to
dip my meter right into the mash and have done with it.  So my question is in
two parts: firstly, any recommendations for pH meters that correct for higher
temperatures?  Secondly, is there a chart somewhere that someone can refer me
to that shows how to adjust pH for temperature?  I'm thinking of something
along the lines of the SG vs. temp chart at sierra.stanford.edu.

P.S.  Did my first full mash over the weekend and ended up with an extraction

Subject: Wormwood...


Chuck,
Not to dismiss any concerns from fellow brewers but I feel that brewing with
Wormwood would prove interesting and safe if a few precautions are taken. 


First off, wormwood is a legal plant and used by many people for everyday
medicinal purposes. From "The Herb Book"> Properties and Uses: Anthelmintic,
antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative, cholagogue, febrifuge, stimulant,
stomachic. Wormwood is above all a stomach medicine, being useful for
indigestion, gastric pain, and lack of appetite, as well as the related
problems of heartburn and flatulence! It is also said to be helpful for liver
insufficiency by stimulating liver and gallbladder secretions. Wormwood oil
is a cardiac stimulant and therefore acts, when taken in proper dosages, to
improve blood circulation. Wormwood tea has been recommended to help relieve
pain during labor. The powdered flowering tops have been used to expel
intestinal worms. A fomentation of wormwood tea can be applied externally to
irritations, sprains and bruises. The oil acts as a local anestetic when
applied to relieve pains of rheumatism, neuralgia, and arthritis. CAUTION:
Pure wormwood oil is a strong poison, and excessive use of the plant can also
cause poisoning. With proper dosage, there is little or no danger.<
To make an infusion you would steep 2 tsp. leaves or tops in one cup water
with a proper dosage being a tsp. at a time up to 1/2 cup a day. 


So there you have it, what you make will probably be not very good "beer",
though you may have better luck making a type of mead. Since dosage is
important, moderation would definately be the key!


As for Absinthe, I would suspect it's toxicity arose from the concentration
of wormwood oil, a "speedball" reaction with alchohol (in which case beer or
wine would probably not be a good idea), or something with the distillation
process. But I'm not sure, so don't take my word for it. As dangerous as
Abstinthe is supposed to be, it's had a long interesting history. It has been
argued that it was one of the factors that allowed much of French
Impressionist art to happen; rotting the brains of artists like Van Gogh and
Toulose-Lautrec and allowing them to see the world as they did! Sort of like
with some of you and LSD in the 60's, huh?;-) Well, as for me, I think I
could muster the curiosity to try a glass of absinthe if anyone's got a dusty
old bottle of Pernod from 1875. How about you? (Flame proof jacket ON!)

Subject: Re: pub paraphernalia


This is a request for information:
Several years ago I saved an advertisement for a firm called:
English Ale Trappings
P.O. Box 8885
New Fairfield, CT 06812
because they had a nice array of Scottish and Newcastle pub stuff -pint
mugs, mirrors, towels darts, etc.
They have apparently gone out of business as my correspondence has gone
unanswered.
I have just finished my homebrewery/pub and am looking to furnishing it
with British ale collectibles. Does anyone on the HBD know of a source
for this sort of thing. Thanks in advance to direct responses.
