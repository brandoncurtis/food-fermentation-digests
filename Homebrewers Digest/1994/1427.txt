Subject: wheat beer questions


although i have enough homebrew to keep me from really worrying
about this, i am kind of annoyed.  i followed the extract recipe
in papazian, using a couple of cans of m&f wheat/barley extract. 
at the end of the boil, the wort looked rather darker than i had
anticipated, but i did not worry; no, i pitched a nice puffy pack
of wyeast bavarian (3056?).  i let it ferment away while i was in
atlanta (thanks to all those who sent info on places to drink
beer; i'm confining my apartment search to places within crawling
distance of taco mac's) for about 12 days.  since i wasn't
around, i can't know what the air temperature was in my
apartment, but i'm skeptical of the likelihood that it got much
over 70 f for any appreciable amount of time.  when i bottled,
the beer was still pretty dark (it looked sort of like a pale ale
without the reddish tinge), and did not have a particularly
wheat-like smell (although the glop stuck on the side of the
fermenter did).  i bottled about 3.5 weeks ago, and tried a
bottle the other day (i know that's a bit early, but i was
curious).  it was kind of watery, and it didn't really taste like
much of anything.  it didn't taste bad, or as if i had a
breakdown in sanitation, it just didn't taste much like a wheat
beer.


has anyone else had this kind of experience using charlie's
recipe (or other extract-based wheat recipes)?  if not, does
anybody have any hypotheses on what has gone wrong (both in terms
the color and the lack of expected flavor profile)?  could it be
that the bavarian was the wrong type of yeast (i.e., can you only
get the banana/clove flavor with the 3068 yeast)?  finding a
solution to this problem is critical, because i took the old
dominion brewery tour this weekend, and discovered that they
aren't going to be releasing their wheat beer until after i leave
town.

Subject: Re: Malta Goya


While on the subject of non fermented malt drinks,


Aass, the Norwegian brewer of wonderful imported Bocks, pilsners,
Julols, etc., makes an unfermented malt product called Vorterol (please
put a slash through the last "o" to get the proper Norwegian spelling)


This product is carbonated, but is not overly sweet somehow.  I first
encountered it during a 45 kilometer ski race, when the last water stop
was sponsored by Aass and they served only Vorterol there - not what I
wanted to be drinking at that point (Actually, they served hot water and
honey at the first two stops, another weird concoction for the middle of
a ski race).  Since I had just turned 18 and legal by Norwegian standards
that year, I spent more time drinking other AAss products that year.


On another note, I don't find the occasional use of the HBD to mention a
new product or event of interest to homebrewers all that noisome.  On the
other hand, repeated bad mouthing of other products in the interests of
one's own product is rather annoying.  I suspect the owner of a certain
grain mill company and I might differ on the exact definition of 
"heavy-handed advertising."

Subject: Culturing Yeast from Primary


I've read a number of sources discussing both culturing yeast onto plates and
slants, as well as re-using yeast slurry from either the primary or secondary
fermenters.  It was mentioned a number of times that subsequent re-pitching
of yeast slurry yields better results on successive batches.  The only problem
I see is that you need to us the slurry within a relatively short time-frame
(within a couple of weeks) before it starts turning sour (lysing).  My question
is this:


Is it possible to culture the yeast from the primary/secondary and still get
better results from batch to batch? (i.e., re-culture each batch's slurry)


  on the same note...


Would contamination be an issue with this method and what should we watch out
for?


It seems to me that all the benefits would be preserved and allow brewers to
hold on longer to good performing cultures.


Any responses would be appreciated.  Thanks.

There have been a couple of post recently about sucking on the end of 
siphoning tube in order to get it started.  Yesterday, Jim mentioned 
placing your hand over the end of the tubing and sucking on your 
hand.  I believe a better method is the following.  Sanitize the 
small piece of plastic pipe you use connect your rubber stopper to 
your blow off tube (if you don't have one, cut a 3 inch section off 
of the top of a bottling cane).  Insert this just barely (1/4 inch) 
into your siphoning tube.  Suck on this and pinch the tube when the 
wort has made it to the end of the tube.  Remove the piece of pipe 
and place the tube in the appropriate vessel.  This way, neither your 
mouth or your hands have to touch the end of the siphoning tube.

Because after you master the cooking side of beer production (wort 
formulation), the most important aspect of brewing is fermentation.
The most important aspect of fermentation is yeast.  You cannot make
many beers with the same yeast, it just doesnt work this way.

Subject: Wormwood is it!




There have been lots of articles lately telling how dangerous wormwood is.
Precaution is good, OK, but I think this is getting ridiculous. In Sweden,
Denmark, Germany and other European countries, liquor containing wormwood
extract are sold and consumed without people getting poisoned. 


Some examples: Gammel Dansk (Denmark), Baska Droppar (Sweden) and Underberg 
(Germany). Blending one's own wormwood vodka is common practice in southern 
Sweden. The recipe is simple: Soak the dried flowers in vodka for some week.
Remove solids, mix with vodka to the taste you prefer. Optionally, add half a
teaspoon honey to make it a bit smoother. I have had gallons of this throughout
the years, and not yet become an impressionist painter :-)


I do not know if or why absinthe made people crazy, but don't blame responsible
use of wormwood without good evidence!

The key here is your definition of "strange sweetness".  If it is unpleasant
and other "classical" off-flavors such as solventlike, bandaid, or if in
addition to the sweetness there is sourness, then I would say infection.  
However, since you also said


>I thought that most infections were evident at bottling time. There was
>nothing unpleasant about the smell or flavor of the beer.  I use chlorine


it seems most likely that you simply bottled too soon considering 
your FG of 1.024.  At a temp of 54F even Lager yeasts take longer to ferment
and you probably should have let it sit in primary for at least 14 days, and
maybe even 21 days before recking to secondary.  What probably happened is
that the beer had not finished fermenting in primary, and you removed
most of the yeast when racking to secondary setting back the fermentation
even more.  Come to think of it, with this fermentation, diacetyl is a
good probability (and can be described as a "strange sweetness").


If the beer is good, you may be able to salvage it by slowly bleeding
out the excess carbonation by slightly opening the caps.  If the beer begins
to foam in the bottle, reseal, wait a few minutes and repeat a few more
times. This should also prevent any bottle grenades.

Absinthe was made as a 190-proof (i.e. 95%) alcoholic drink. Just as gin
wreaked havoc in Britain in the late 18th and early 19th centuries,
absinthe wreaked havoc in France, Belgium, and Switzerland at the turn of
the 19th century. Alcoholism was the cause, but there was no way the
French would attempt anything like prohibition. A convenient scapegoat was
found in absinthe; since it was the prefered drink of poets, painters,
cabaret singers, and other societal rejects, the good citizens could
easily soothe their anxiety and put all the blame on "them". 


Manufacturers knew perfectly well what was going on, and when they came 
out with a substitute, pastis, they wisely kept it at around 100 proof, 
and emphasized in advertising that one should add lots of water to it. 
Absinthe continued to be legal in Spain, where it had traditionally been 
drunk more diluted, as a cooling summer drink rather than as a quick trip 
into alcoholic stupor as it had been in France.


Wormwood, being exceedingly bitter, cannot be used in large quantities. It
simply cannot. While it is true that pure oil of wormwood is toxic, it is
not especially more toxic than oil of peppermint, oil of thyme, or for
that matter oil of hops. Typical acute toxicities for such
terpene-containing aromatic oils cluster around 1g/kg (LD50 in rats). 


>Well, as for me, I think I could muster the curiosity to try a glass of

Take a bottle of Pernod, put in one twig of wormwood (as much as a 
typical supermarket twig of parsley), and wait a couple of weeks. 


ObBeer: To brew, for bitterness add the wormwood in the boil. Thujone is
_not_ the major bittering principle of wormwood, incidentally, so it can
be boiled away while still retaining considerable bitterness.

before.  We made 50 gallons of beer and fermented it in 5 gallon
batches with 10 different yeasts.  Thus: same beer, different yeast.
The results were, in some cases, *very* different.  Admittedly, some
of the differences were more subtle.


Recently, a friend & I made 15 gallons of Wit (Belgian wheat) beer and
split it into 5 3-gallon batches, each with its own yeast.  The
results ranged from very fruity, through spicy to downright phenolic.
These batches (as opposed to the yeastola) were fermented together in
a single location, so there should be no other factor affecting the
flavor other than the yeast.  Very convincing!

>From *Jeff* Renner 
 
I have recently acquired an unused National Instrument Co. Model 100/C *Hand 
Proctometer* (which isn't what it sounds like) that was disposed of as 
surplus by the Univ. of Mich.  This is a beautifully made, temperature 
corrected instrument that looks like a six inch long telescope and measures 
the refractive index (1.3330 to 1.3600) of a single drop of liquid.  A 
calibrated etched scale in the viewer reads this as urine specific gravity 
(1.000 to 1.045) or blood serum protein (0 to 12 g/dl).  You place a drop on 
a prism, close a cover, and hold it to your eye up to the light (see the 
naked lady?).  I have seen vineyard workers measure S.G. of grape must in 
the field using such an instrument and a drop of juice from a single grape.  
This would be a great quick way of measuring S.G. of wort and finished beer 
if I could calibrate it but I see some problems.  Urine, blood serum and 
grape juice have presumably predictable, uniform mixes of refractive 
dissolved compounds, whereas wort has varying mixes of several sugars, and 
finished beer has varying amounts of alcohol as well.  Does anyone have any 
experience with the refractive indices of wort and beer, or of the 
components of these?  How much does the R.I. to S.G. of wort vary depending 
on mash schedule and temperature?  I have one data point:  a pale ale wort 
at 1.046 read 1.036 on the internal urine S.G. scale. 
 
I'd love to use this beauty.  It must have cost a pretty penny new.  I also 
have a used motorized, vacuum operated refractometer (Behring Rapidmat II 
Digital Refractometer).  I imagine this could be used to continuously 
monitor S.G. as sparge was pulled off in a big scale operation.  I haven't 
figured out how I'll use this yet.

Subject: Special London Ale yeast: tastes GReat!




A while back I enlisted the HBD's expert amateurs (and other wise) for
help with a finicky Special Londan Ale yeast (wyeast).  The Pale is up to
speed and the flavor is excellent.  The slightly higher than normal FG did
not affect the overall flavor.  This beer has a particularly English
flavor, like I've had it in some fancy pub.  The clarity is excellent, the
yeast cakes out hard on the bottom and does not pour into the glass when
filled.  I highly reccomend it.  Thanks for everyone's help!  
        I brewed a stout and adjusted the mash temp to be lower than
normal (149-151F).  My OG was 1.057.  When all signs appeared to halt, I
checked the gravity: about 1.022.  I roused the carboy and added a couple
of ounces of saved dregs from the primary.  I got another mini ferment
going with a thin foamy head on the beer.  After  a week, the beer
cleared, and my FG was 1.017: satisfactory for an OG in the high fifties. 
the taste at bottling was great, maybe more of a sweet stout.  
        I quickly got the yeast going again in a kind of hybrid belgian
white beer style with coriander, ginger, and orange peel.  With a gravity
in the low forties and that spritzy white beer taste, this should be the
perfect summer beer.  Maybe I'll just sit out with a mug full and watch my
hop vines grow.  (the damn things are already 12 feet off the ground!)

  I bought mine at Fun Fermentations in Orange, CA.  They got their 
order from Glatt about 4 months late, but in enough quantity that he had 
them in stock for quite a while.  I'm not sure if he still has them in 
stock.  (sorry, I just shop there.)


  In terms of a review, I would take this mill VERY seriously.  It is an 
extremely good mill, was easy to connect to a drill for automation, and 
makes a consistant crush.  One of my friends has one of your (Jack 
Schmidling) mills, and in terms of comparison I would say there are some 
trade-offs.
  I like the crush from the Glatt better, and I like the fact that it 
does not come connected to a base, so I can attach it to whatever 
surface I like.  Also, the adjustable Glatt is only a little more 
expensive than the non-adjustable Schmidling Mill, and cheaper than the 
adjustable Schmidling.
  OTOH, The Glatt comes with a handle which is longer than the mill is 
tall, so if you are going to use the handle (rather than using a drill), 
you HAVE to attach it to the corner of a table.  Also, the output chute 
runs about 45 degrees downward, pouring the crushed grain in a nice path 
to go into a bucket, but it is not contained, so if you crush too fast 
(like with a high speed drill on full speed), grain can go flying 
everywhere.  


  BTW, I find that the adjustable rollers are very desirable.  Even 
though my friends Schmidling Mill is fixed at a distance which is good, 
I was able to adjust my Glatt so as to get an even better crush.  
(DISCLAIMER:  I would assume that the adjustable Schmidling Mill can be 
equally adjusted).


  In summary, If Mr. Glatt ever learns to run a business (ie: shipping 
in quantity enough to satisfy the demand), he will definitely give you a 
run for your money.  At least there are now TWO better alternatives to 
the old fashioned Corona mills.

Subject: Mill alternatives


A lot of recent discussion about motorizing the new breed of home-scale
roller mills prompts me to write about a mill that has served me perfectly
for the last few years.


It is a grocery-store coffee grinder that I picked up through the want ads
for $50. When I described it here at the time the responses were "they give
you nothing but flour" but after two years experience I think these were
from folks whe had used grinders that were not adjusted properly, or who
were snobby purists. These machines use grinding plates as do the much
maligned Corona, but they have large interlocking knobs on the plate that
provide *momentary* contact between the plates rather than a shearing grind
like the Corona.


I got the big grinder (30" tall) that looks a little like a slot machine. I
had to clean out the grinder plates, and loosen the adjusting knob a turn
or two to get the plates set the right distance apart. Now a little turn of
the handle from "fine" (does well with unmalted wheat) to "perk" (does
great with pale two-row) to "coarse" (crushed burnt malts without
pulverizing) allows me to crush anything I'd like to put in a mash. I think
that the lack of adjustability severely limits the available home roller
mills (Jack, ever put raw wheat through a MM?) Crush time is 1-2 minutes
for 10#.


Is it a perfect crush? As good as I've ever seen. The husks are whole, and
*most* of the malt kernels are in 4-6 pieces. There is a little flour, but
mostly when using raw wheat and even then only about 5%. I've never had a
stuck sparge, I think because the malt husks are whole.


I recommend keeping your eyes peeled for one of these things. The only
regret I have is that I miss the experience of cranking a hand mill for 45
minutes, and the subtle taste of the sweat that dripped off my brow into
the grain in the old days.


good luck

I prefer whole leaf hops (as long as you can get them in good shape) for
many reasons.  I think they give better hop aroma since they are not
processed like pellets and plugs.  They float, so racking out from under them
is easy (I use a hop bag over the end of the racking cane).  Putting them
into the carboy is pretty easy with a funnel.  The amount depends on the type
of hop.  I think that 2 oz. of EKGs is not too much for 5 gallons, but I
wouldn't use that much Cascades.  It is a matter of choice, of course, so
you'll have to experiment to see what you like.  Freshness is the key...

The big thing I like about a heated tun is the flexibility it gives you
to change things.  Malts, adjuncts, temps, times, thickness...  My basic ale
is a american pale ale, infusion for a rest at 153F, then mash off at 
170.  As you noted, mash stiffness is not sacraficed when raising the 
temp using heat as opposed to using hot water in a cooler.  If you are
just making ales like this, a cooler is probably as good as a heated 
tun.  Now, when you want to make a Wit bier, or a HefeWeizen or a 
DoppelBock...then you must have a method of temperature controlled
mashing.  With the last two examples, a step mash is mandatory, and
a decoction is preferred.  Take the example of making a Weizen.  Typical
mash temps are 110F, 122, 126, 132, 144, 158, 168F.  How thin is the
mash going to be if you do this in a cooler?  Now certainly you can
use a cooler and decoct to raise the temps, and Im sure there are
many HBDers who make excellent beers this way.  I like to maximize 
the quality of my beers (and volume!) while minimizing the work 
effort.  It takes a lot more effort to decoct in a cooler than it
does to just add heat and stir.  


Whether its a benefit or not, direct fired tuns will produce more 
melonoiden reactions than cooler infusions, giving the beer a different
quality.  


good brewing,

Subject: the continuing Wormwood debate


Fellow homebrewers,


I've been following the recent discussion of brewing with wormwood, and
would like to add my two cents.  Recently, someone posted that many
post-impressionist painters drank absinthe which contains wormwood, and
hypothesized that the drink gave these painters their unique perspective of
the world.  Similar arguments have been made about playwright August
Strindberg, often considered the father of expressionist drama, who was known
to down large quantities of absinthe while he wrote, even after governments
illegalized the stuff.


I'm a little skeptical about basing interpretations of these artists' works on
the fact that they all drank wormwood.  I am, however, more comfortable with
using the evidence provided by the numerous biographical accounts of these
artists' lives to argue against consuming wormwood for non-medicinal purposes.
Most know that Van Gogh was not the most stable of people.  I won't guess
whether wormwood caused or accelerated his mental condition.  His
insanity--manifesting itself in argumentative relationships with his family,
self-destructive relationships with women, self-mutilation, and suicide--is
enough to put me off of wormwood.


Strindberg led a similarly sad life.  He broke up with his first wife early
in his career, in an age (the late nineteenth century) when divorce was
scandalous.  Throughout his life, he and members of his family suffered nervous
breakdowns and institutionalization.  He also saw two more marriages fail,
and his children estranged from him.  A contemporary play based loosely on
the life of the playwright, titled simply *Wormwood*, explores the conflict an
aging, bitter writer experiences as he struggles to write without absinthe,
finally giving in to temptation and drinking.


I provide these short biographies to suggest to readers of the HBD that they
should be careful when fooling around with stuff like wormwood.  I, too, can
get caught up in the melancholy romance of the suffering genious, and agree
that the lives of these artists make for great biographies, movies, and plays.
However, we should never forget that alcohol itself is a depressant poison.
Adding additional poisons, particularly ones linked to insanity and
hallucination, to alcoholic beverages doesn't seem like the wisest of ideas.

Not to set off any alarms, but back in high school some friends

discriminating consumers, you might say! Also, in college,
people tended to purchase kegs of Old Milwaukee (cheap,
kegs were delivered, etc....). My knees, screwed up from
years of soccer and some wrestling, would ache just as
badly as my head---the knee problem also occurs with
too much milk consumption (lactic acid build-up in the joints).


Anyrate, no homebrew has _ever_ given me a headache, 
whether it was my own or a friends. I don't recall any
microbrews doing that either, so Jason might be on to
something here.  It _could_ be the rice, but I personally 
think it's also stuff from
part of the processing/packaging (and that lovely

i can avoid headaches and knee-aches all together
by staying w/homebrew and microbrew.
