That someone did sign the post "Al."  Neither I nor anyone else here is going

I still contend that the human mouth is a darn good source for hundreds of
bacteria, including lactobacillus.  Perhaps you would like to provide a
reference to the contrary?

When did I say that lactobacillus is a yeast?  I suggest if you are going
to criticize something in the HBD, you might do everyone a favor and quote
the post which you are flaming.  That way, everyone can read for themselves
that you missed the point.  Secondly, if you are a dedicated siphon sucker,
then I suggest that odds are that your beers are indeed infected.  Perhaps
you drink them quickly and they don't have the opportunity for the infections
to become apparent or maybe you are not sensitive to sourness and the smell
of a lactobacillus infection... everyone's senses are different.

Jim asks about shipping beer from Europe.


I spoke to someone from the Duty section of US Customs in Washington DC
yesterday about limits regarding beer into the US.  He said that exceeding
limits on other items (not alcohol... and perhaps tobacco, I would imagine)
is subject to duty.  Alcholic beverages, on the other hand are different.
Unless you purchased the beverages in a US territory, you are limited to
1 liter of alcoholic beverages per adult.  Period.  Yes, he said that
US Customs people usually allow reasonable amounts of beer through, but
by law, anything over 1 liter was subject to seizure.  I asked about
shipping it in and said that I heard of a guy who shipped six or seven
cases of beer as unaccompanied luggage on KLM.  He said that the guy was
very lucky because it was certainly not legal.


Since I had planned to bring a lot of beer back from an upcoming trip,
I will be much more conservative on how much I will bank on the good will
of the US Customs officers.

Subject: Mashtun Design


Hello, all:


I've recently been playing around with a motorized mash "folder" to try and
eliminate the temperature gradients that occur in the usual homebrewing mash
tun.  (Note:  RIMS users do not have this problem.)  I have been reading a 
few of the more complete books on brewing (the two-volume set _Mashing_and_
Brewing_Science_ and _The_Practical_Brewer_) and have seen references to
the mechanical mash mixing devices employed in large scale operations -- both
in the cereal cookers and in the mash tun.  Now I know that what the "big
boys" do doesn't necessarily translate to our own small-scale brewing setups
(this disclaimer is for js, who likes to point this out occasionally :-), but
there are some things which translate very well (roller mills, like the 
MALTMILL(tm) come immediately to mind ;-).  


I have recently seen numerous posts from folks who have access to some 
pretty accurate digital thermometers and they have made the important 
observation as to the lack of uniformity in mash temps.  So, being one to 
tinker, I decided to see if in fact a more thorough and continuous mix would 
have any effect on the outcome, i.e., the product.  (Disclaimer:  I know 
this is completely anal and unnecessary for producing fine homebrew, so save
the BW and don't post/email about what a waste of time this is ;-).  


What I attempted to do with this setup is to provide a "folding" action 
that eliminates temperature gradients without introducing HSA, which seems
to the be newest bane to our existence.  Because the paddle is well below
the surface of the mash (it is adjustable for different mash levels), the
only disturbance of the mash surface comes from the entry point of the 
stainless steel shaft.  I have experimented with my hand-held mash paddle
and found that by turning it between my palms I can acheive a nice bottom-
to-top movement of the mash, with very little disturbance of the air/mash
interface.  (However, it gets pretty tiresome doing this.)  Also, the keg is 
pretty much sealed from the outside air by the foam insulation which fits 
snugly between the bottom of the paddle support and the top of the keg.  


The motor was purchased from American Science and Surplus and provides a 
continuous 154 rpms with 30 inch lbs. of torque. (It's a GE "Minigear" motor
and it cost $19.95.  The rest of the material, except the pillow blocks which 
were $8.00/pair, I had lying around my shop, so I'm into this for relatively 
little $$$$.)  With the pulley arrangement I have, the paddle moves at ~35 
rpms with a total torque of ~90 inch lbs.  The pillow blocks have phosphour
bronze bushings and have wick-type lubrication, which prevents any of the
lubricant from finding its way down the shaft and into the mash.  They are
flange-type and are mounted on either side of the angle iron support, flange
to flange.  This provides more than enough stability for the shaft.  The
whole arrangement is mounted to the keg with two 1/4" bolts, which pass
through the keg handles and the angle iron frame.  It takes a couple
minutes to mount/dismount it.

Subject: Malt aroma


Dry hopping and late boil hop additions are well known methods of introducing a
hoppy aroma to a beer. Little information, however, seems to exist on getting a
strong malty aroma. If I withhold late hop or dry hop additions in my all grain
batches, I don't get a strong malt aroma, just a beer nose. 


Miller explains in TCHOHB that dimethyl sulfide (DMS) contributes to a malty
aroma but then suggests ways of reducing DMS by improving sanitation, cooling
wort quickly, etc. I'd rather not chance poor sanitation to obtain my goal.


Do certain types of grains improve malt aroma? Is it influenced by different
mashing methods (decoction, etc.)? Mashing temperature? Ph? Any ideas? 


TIA

PS. I know Pilsner Urquell is renown for its Saaz hop aroma but to my humble
nose, it also has a heck of alot of malt aroma in there.

Subject: Yeast stuff--COMMON and a new faq


It never rains but it pours---I've uploaded a new version of the yeast
faq to sierra. I corrected a few spelling errors, and I added an
appendix that describes the William's wyeast strains (William's
redistributes Wyeast yeast under their own label but changes the
numbering system and names). This appendix was given to me by Brian
Smithey, so thank Brian if it helps you.
If these changes are unimportant to you, don't bother to get the new version.


If you do want it and it hasn't shown up yet, breath deeply, have a
homebrew, and try again in a few days :-).


In response to the question about COMMON yeasts, you have a point, if
Sumerians could make beer in open vats, why do we worry about yeast
strains (or starting a siphon by mouth for that matter)?  Well, it
depends a lot on what your tastes are, what style of beer you make,
etc, but the proper yeast *can* make a world of difference. Although
brewer's yeast and baker's yeast are both Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
the strain variation and selection between the two are very different.
Ever more worrisome to me is the quality control aspect. If the yeast
is rehydrated and mixed with flour for a few hours before being baked
in an oven, the risks of adverse outcome from bacterial contamination
is slight. Mixing your yeast with a giant vat of sugar water for a few
weeks, however, presents another class of problem entirely. 


If you are put off by the cost or bother, I suggest that you try Red
Star's excellent dry ale yeast. You have little to lose and may learn
to appreciate the difference.

Subject: Staplebrau/Low-T_Ale_ferments


Whud id iz: I got some good info from respondents to my recent posts about
low-T ale fermentation, in true HBD style.  I stupidly neglected to
mention my main concern of fermenting ale yeasts at 56-60F, which is
the possible flavor effects, rather than vigor of activity (things
seem to be cruising along with no problems). Thanks to Spencer Thomas, Andy
Donohue, Chip Hitchcock, and P Brooks.  Any errors in my summary below of
their input are undoubtedly mine.


The consensus is that ales will definitely lose some of their fruitier
notes from fermentation at these temps., and be crisper and cleaner. 
I.e., more lager-like and less ale-like.  Although Chip suggested that
there should be little effect on malt and hop flavors, P Brooks'
experiences were that the less-active ferments produced less scrubbing of
hop aromatics, so the beers seemed more hopped than they actually were. 
Bottom line: no ill effects, just some (subtle?) flavor differences.


Staples in beer: Alan of Austin brought up something I hadn't considered,
namely that staples have an adhesive on them.  I examined a row of staples
from the box I am in the middle of, and could see nothing with the naked
eye.  I took it to the lab and had a look under the microscope, and could
see a VERY thin bit of this plasticlike stuff, but ONLY on the corners of
the staples, not in an enveloping sheath.  I would estimate that the
amount of this stuff in the batch of beer I brewed with the stapled bags
is a fraction of a milligram (I didn't peel it off and weigh it because it
was just too small).  I am going to go ahead with this because I think it
is an acceptable risk--but good thinking, Alan!

Subject: Different Fermentation Methods


It seems like the more I learn the more confused I get.  For my first 11
batches I've been using a primary fermenter for the first 3-4 days, then
racking to a secondary fermenter for another 5-7 days.  I finally bought
a glass carboy (6.7 gallons), and started using the blowoff method (with a
nice 1" tube).  I'm concerned with infection using this method, all the
blowup crap sitting around in a water bucket.  I let it sit like this for
about 2 days (until it quit blowing off into bucket), then switched to a
regular airlock.


Questions:


1) Miller recommends using only 1 fermentor, but doesn't like blowoff method.
   Though he states single closed fermentation, he says he racks off to another
   carboy after fermentation is done.  He cools this carboy and lets it sit
   for a couple of days.  (How's this really different from using two-stage
   fermentation)?


2) How long can I let the beer sit on the yeast when using the blowoff method?


3) What about nasties traveling up the blowoff tube sitting in the bucket of
   water (which blowoff crude goes into).

I don't have any references handy, and don't recall

I've had pretty thin mashes for higher temp. rests. What

I'm just wondering what benefit a thicker mash would give me.

I did this for my first 100 batches or so.  Now I dont bother, doesnt
seem to matter for me.  Filling the tube with water and diverting it
to another bucket until beer flows is another simple effective way to
do this without additional effort (assuming your water is treated with
chlorine).

Norm, if I had the schedule, I'd agree that this is not of major
interest, but since you've hit one of my hot buttons, I decided to post
instead. 


When I saw the AHA conference information in Zymurgy, I thought that it
would be nice to go since it's so close to me.  I noticed the same thing
that you did:  there is no schedule of when each presentation will be
given.  There was a number to call for more information.  When I called
them, they told me that they'd send me out the schedule right away.
What I received (three weeks later) was the same information in Zymurgy
(i.e. no schedule).  I needed to know the schedule because I wasn't
interested in all the presentations and I can't afford to take the whole
time off.  Later, at the first round judging for the Nationals, I ran
into Karen Barela.  I told her about this and gave her feedback about
how frustrating this was.  She told me that they can't publish the
schedule in Zymurgy because of the long lead times.  Fine, but why can't
you mail the schedule out when people ask.  She told me that I should
have been sent the schedule.  Everyone else I know got the same mailing
I did, so I'm not sure what the deal is.  Later, a friend of mine called
her and asked about the schedule.  She told him that she didn't have a
copy to mail or fax him, but she did read it over the phone to him.
Given that they've known at least part of the schedule since January
(Jeff Lebesch said that his presentation has been scheduled since then),
you'd think that they could have it together.  I've decided that it's
just not worth it.


Sorry for venting.

Well, I inadvertently brewed a very light beer a few months back and decided
I liked it anyway.  I basically undershot the amount of grain I needed and
overshot the sparge water, and just didn't wait to boil it away.  Now that
I've tried it, I'm incredibly pleased with the result except for one thing.
How does one get these lighter beers to keep the beautiful head (it really

Sorry if I implied to anyone that richard had anything against charlie, but
in fact, if you read my note, you'd realize there was no such implication.
The only "conclusion" in the post was possibly through the deductive process
that richard was whining, and even then not obnoxiously in comparison to

I am getting ready to brew a batch of Red Ale this weekend and now that summer
is here I'm becomming concerned about fermentation temperatures.


During the winter, I always do my fermentations in the corner of the kitchen
with nome nifty home made insulated jackets over the carboys for temperature
stability and light blockage.


Well, now my kitchen is up to 75 degrees in the day and I'm concerned that temp
is too high.  My basement is 66 degrees and that may be too low for Wyeast
American Ale yeast.  What is the collective wisdom of the digest?  I do have an
area on the landing of the basement stairs that is 70 degrees, but it would be
a bit crowded with 2 carboys perking away.


Any insights are greatly appreciated.

Subject: Glatt mills?


 
 Hope I don't sound ungrateful for the information, after all, I did ask for 
 it but there are a few comments worth making here...
 
 >From: Allen Ford <allen`at`darwin.sfbr.org>
 
 > Compared to the earlier version of the Maltmill with longitudinally-grooved 
 rollers, the Glatt mill thruput and crush is superior.  According to 
 competent sources, compared with the newer knurled-roller Maltmill, there is 
 no noticeable difference.
 
 The two are not even in the same ballpark as far as throughput is concerned.  
 The MM puts out 300 lbs per hour and the Glatt with its plastic gears can't 
 even be kept running that long without having to replace broken gears.
 
 Aside from reliability, the most recent published data on the Glatt puts it 
 at about 60 lbs per hr.
 
 I will concede that there is probably little practical difference in the 
 crush as that is the reason people use rollers mills but to say the Glatt is 
 superior is not backed by any tests I know of.
 
 > For me the major selling points of the Glatt mill were: 1)both rollers
 are gear driven so no slippage of a passive roller can occur,
 
 Until one of the plastic gears breaks.
 
 The unique design of the MM makes gears unnecessary.
 
 > 2)the gap between the rollers is adjustable on both ends, allowing the 
 rollers to remain parallel at all settings,
 
 That is more perception than a real advantage in actual practice.  The fixed 
 MM rollers are parallel and produce an excellent crush on any grain out 
 there.  The adjustable can produce any sort of alternative crush desirable 
 using its unique non-parallel design.
 
 > and 3)the price was ~$40 cheaper than it nearest competitor, the Maltmill.
 
 Not sure where $40 comes from but the MM sells for $99 and will do everything 
 the Glatt will do, much faster and forever.
 
 >I am currently setting up to motorize the Glatt.  Although the
 manufacturer states that motorizing the mill will void the warranty,
 he claims that I should be able to run it at or below 300 rpm. 
 
 But did he say he would honor the warranty?  And isn't it only 90 days 
 anyway?    With plastic gears and plastic bearings, the limited warranty is 
 totally understandable.
 
 > How does this compare to the warranty and recommended speeds for the 
 Maltmill?
 
 The MM has a lifetime guarantee and can be run at any speed you wish.  
 I have known people who run them at 1725 rpm and another person had the 
 pullies reversed and was running around 5000.  Needless to say, neither of 
 these are very good ways of running them but the mills didn't self destruct.  
 I think the most efficient speed is between 300 and 500 but with short, 
 skinny rollers like the Glatt, you would probably have to run it much slower 
 to get it to feed properly.
 
 >From: Bob Fawcett <bobf`at`gulfaero.com>
 
 >I got a MaltMill yesterday and the enclosed literature has a similar
 warranty disclaimer.
 
 I think if you read it again, you will find that it not similar at all.  It 
 is only a disclaimer of JSP liability for personal injury if you motorize it. 
 If the mill breaks while chewing up your hand, a replacement (mill) will be 
 cheerfully sent but call a doctor for your hand and not a lawyer.
 
 >  There was no mention of a recommended speed since Jack doesn't recommend 
 motorizing the mill.
 
 Again, it's not a question of recommending, it a question of liability for 
 injury if you do motorize it.
 
 >The crush of the new knurled rollers is great.
 
 I would be interested in knowing how the new knurled rollers on the Glatt 
 mill relate to the following.....

 Subject: Glatt malt mill
 
 I would like to get in touch with people that have bought or
 used the Glatt malt mill.  I am having trouble with grain
 feeding properly, and was wondering if this was a universal
 problem.  The first mills shipped had wide horizontal
 grooves.  Glatt changed this to a knurled pattern, which
 supposedly had a higher throughput.  When my mill was new it
 worked great, but now grain will not feed unless I apply
 pressure on the grain in the feed hopper.

 >From: Jim Busch <busch`at`daacdev1.stx.com>
 
 >...as far as I knew all standard MMs use Orings to drive the passive roller.  
 
 The current design seems to run as well without the orings as it does with.  
 I still put one in because it facilitates assembly and checkout but I have 
 been telling customers not to bother replacing it if it wears out and to let 
 me know if there is a problem.  It's been almost a year since I changed the 
 roller design and I have yet to hear from anyone that the oring helps.
 
 This of course leads to....
 
 >Thats why I forked out the extra money for the gear drive, esp. since I knew 
 I would motorize it and drive about 7 times the "normal" malt quantities 
 through it.
 
 One might ask, if the oring is not needed, why the gears?   The answer is 
 that I seem to have outdone myself and obsoleted a nice option.  I am unable 
 to measure any difference in the time it takes to crush with and without the 
 gears on my mill.  As I never do more than 14 lbs, however, I have no way of 
 knowing if there is any difference on large batches.  I have asked several 
 high volume users with new mills to run for awhile without the gears and let 
 me know what the learn.  I have not heard from anyone yet so I am still 
 offering the gears as sort of insurance but not at all sure they are useful 
 anymore.
 
 >From: hollen`at`megatek.com (Dion Hollenbeck)
 
 > Why Greg has voided a warranty due to motorization is that if something 
 should wedge the rollers, the gears will strip since they are just plastic.  
 
 It seems as though this risk occurs everytime one starts up with a full 
 hopper, the modus operandi of hand cranked mills.  This is the time of 
 maximum torque and the only difference between motor and hands is one might 
 stop if he knows what crunching gear sounds like.  Granted, with small 
 rollers, the Glatt take less torque but if a stone or other foreign body (or 
 even Carapils for that matter) gets in, it is a potential disaster.
 
 >To solve this problem, I mounted the motor.....
 
 This "problem" says more about why not to buy a Glatt than all the literature 
 I have published to date.  If I were the customer, I would demand that the 
 manufacturer solve the problem.

Re: wormwood posts


The recent postings regarding wormwood have shared a remarkable property: the 
ability to express strong opinions independently of any facts.  As far as 
health dangers are concerned: ANYTHING (including necessities such as water, 
oxygen, etc.) in sufficient quantity can KILL you--the key is moderation.  
It's hard to be moderate with absinthe.  The toxicity of wormwood notwith-
standing, the bottle of Hill's Absinth I bought in the Czech Republic is 70% 
by volume (140 proof).  The homemade version I tried in Dayton (from a recipe 
modified from _Henley's Formulas_--an older version with the standardized 
chemical names of the ingredients) used neutral grain spirits of approximately 
75% by volume.  The alchemist in question has done PhD work in toxicology and 
has tried using wormwood as a bittering agent for beer.  His advice: unless 
you've got access to the proper laboratory equipment, you're probably going to 
make it too bitter.  When asked as to exactly how bitter wormwood was, rather 
than reply quantitatively, he put it in qualitative terms everyone in the room 
readily grasped: "It will make your mouth pucker up like a butthole."[or was 
that "buttonhole"?]  I believe him as he has the educational background to 
make such an assessment and first-hand experience in working with it.


Re: Malta Goya uses:


Guerrilla brewers in the Magic Kingdom of Saudi Arabia found Barbican (another 
malt beverage) extremely useful as prepackaged wort.  It's odd how good it can 
taste when it's the only beer available anywhere.

Subject: Dispensing cask ales


Hi All,


As some of you might remember, I sort of fell in love with those cask
conditioned ales on my recent pub crawl through England, Scotland & Wales.
After coming home and trying to make one of these cask ales I quickly
discovered that a large part of the character is developed when the beer is
dispensed via the hand pump. The action of forcing the beer through the
sparkler into the glass whips air into the beer. The air really is required
for authentic low carbonation ales. The whiping action generates a great
head that is an integral part of a good hand pulled beer.


I built a gadget that attached to the end of a hose that simulated the
effect of the sparkler. It consisted of a piece of tubing and a cap on the
end with several really small holes in it. Worked great, dazzeled all.


The next generation I developed is a tap style for my frig. draft system. It
replaces the standard bar type tap and has a knob on the side that opens and
adjusts the flow rate. The output stream of beer is directed down into the
glass. The whole gadjet really works well. I have discovered that it is
possible to keep about 3-5 psi on the keg all the time for dispensing and
this pressure is high enough to push the beer with addequate velocity to
generate a good head via the sparkler without building the CO2 up in the
beer over time.


Now for the big question. I have one, and it works great. Would anyone else
like one? I have a friend who has machine shop and could build them up for
us. A lucky few of you could become the beta testers for this gadget. I
would guess the cost of the tap would be under $50. If there is enough
interest, I would continue to have them made and sell them. OK so what do
you all think? 


I would be interested in hearing what your collective wisdom is on the
commercial viablity of such a gadget. I would guess the homebrew market
might be small and the pub market would be larger. The ability to serve cask
ales on several taps without spending $1000 on a hand pump seems like a good
idea to me. Then of course there is the beauty of those cool hand pumps and
the ritual of the pull that may also play an important role in the
acceptance of the final beer.

human consumption, or for consumption in alcoholic beverages only (e.g.
galangal root.)  This is noted in the catalog.


The store is worth visiting.  It is located in Detroit's Eastern Market
district, around the corner from the (demolished) Stroh's Brewery, which
is across the street from the (long-closed) Goebel Brewery.  Local farmers
(some from Ontario) drive to the roofed-over market in season and sell
