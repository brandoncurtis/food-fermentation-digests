Subject: Some newbie questions


Greetings brewmeisters,


I am preparing to brew my first batch of lager and have a few 
questions to ask.  First, in Papazian's book he states that malt
syrup contains 20% H2O, so I have concluded that 1 lb of malt syrup 
is equivalent to about 13 oz of dry malt extract.  Is this correct?
Would it be better to convert recipes using SG contributions (much 
more of a pain to calculate)?


Second, I live in St. Louis, and right now the temp has been near
80 F lately.  My basement is cooler but it still stays above 70 F for 
most of the day.  Being a graduate student I don't have much money to 
spend on an expensive cooling system for fermentation.  I think a fan
would help decrease the temperature a little, but can anyone recommend
a cheap alternative to cool my primary (a 6L glass carboy).  Would it 
be better if I did my primary fermentation at work where I could put 
the carboy in a 10 F cold room?  Should I just brew in my basement,
relax, and have a homebrew?  BTW, I am planning on using a California 
lager yeast.


Also, can anyone direct me to a procedure for sporulating and drying 
yeast?  (I have access to all the necessary lab equipment at work.)


Lastly, I would appreciate suggestions as to whether a blow-off tube 
(into a bottle of bleach water) can be used throughout the entire 
fermentation process, or if it would be better to switch to an airlock 
after the fermantation slows.


I really appreciate the wealth of knowledge about the art of brewing 
that the more experienced brewers share with us newbies!  It is a 
wonderful thing to be able to communicate with hundreds (thousands?) 
of homebrewers and their respective experiences with brewing.


Long live the internet!

Subject: Hmmm......






        1).  Ok, to make it short - I am currently brewing a batch of
cherry stout (from "Cat's Meow II") that is acting a bit funny.  When I put
a bottle in the fridge (2 hours) the beer seems to lose all carbonation.
When I opened one at room temperature, it immediately gushed out for about
1 second, then stopped.  Without having to post a great deal of data, does
this sound like anything that can be remedied?


        2).  I became pathetically addicted to Hale's Irish (stout?), only
to discover LATER that it was a seasonal brew.  Does anyone have anything
that comes close?


        3).  I would like to try liquid yeast (pre-packaged) but so far the
opinion is "Well, every now & then you'll get a dud."  So I have been
getting yeast from the people who make Pike Place ales/stouts.  I know I
will be needing different types of yeast in the future - any advice with
brands vs. homecultures?


        Comments/flames/anything gladly accepted.  Pat, I'd like to buy a
clue.

Subject: Lager still fermenting


I inadvertantly came across an ad in my local paper selling refridgerators
for $100.  When I called, it turned out they were very large ones (4.5
feet tall) and all quite new.  They were being sold by a motel that was 
remodeling all their rooms (hint, hint, for all of you looking for fridge 
bargins).


I sprung for one (and an external themostat) and brewed my first lager.


The problem?  It's been in the fridge for 2 weeks but apparently it's 
still fermenting.  At least the air lock bubbles every 30-40 seconds.


I know that the colder the environment, the longer the fermentation, but
is it a problem that it is taking so long?  I racked the wort after about
a week because so much trub settled to the bottom but stuff continues to 
settle.  Am I risking off-flavors because the wort has been sitting on 
the yeast so so long?  Will it ever stop fermenting?  Has it developed a 
life of its own?

Subject: Two Liter Ceramic Top Bottles


Always looking for the best way to bottle/keg my homebrew, I recently converted
to 5-liter mini-kegs, splitting my batches between  the mini-kegs and bottles,
depending on the style of beer.


Recently, a friend returned from Belgium with a two-liter ceramic top 
refillable bottle from a Belgian brew-pub (DOMUS Huisbrouwerij, Leuven,
Belgium)  The next best thing to trying the delicious micro-brewed amber ale
was admiring the bottle.


Not three days from this discovery, I found the same bottles at the Baltimore
Brewing Co. in Baltimore, MD ($6.50 fill/refill, $12 bottle deposit).


Does anyone out there know how to get these bottles without paying for a local
brew-pubs logo or travelling to Belgium?


Also, my next batch of beer is going to be the honey lager from Papazian's
KJOHB, but I'll be using maple tree sap instead of water (My parents froze some
and brought it for me from Vermont for this purpose).  Does anyone have any
suggestions or comments.

Subject: Re: Spruce/Ginger/Herb Additives & Grape Nuts


          I've questions for any&all that've made spiced brews using ginger, 
          spruce, herbs, etc....  & a lesser comment on GRAPE NUTS.
          
          Based on my and friends' experience with ginger brews, I have a 
          theory that not only is control of the measure (weight or volume) 
          of a spicing additive important in avoiding unwelcome excess 
          flavorings, but also the control of SURFACE AREA of that additive 
          in contact with the wort.  Can anyone provide data to test/support 
          my theory?  For all those who've made spruce beer, did you use 
          finely chopped spruce bits?  Puree?  Separate Needles off tips?  
          Whole tips? How much did you use, by weight &/or by volume?  
          Iyho, was your brew overspiced? Spiced right? Underspiced?
          
          In making the ginger brews I've enjoyed, I've cut 2oz. by weight 
          ginger roots into slices between 1/4" and  1/8 ".  Fellow ginger 
          brewers tell me they cut their 2 oz root into slices much thinner, 
          and get a less satisfactory, overly spiced brew.   
          
          I believe the thinner you slice a 2oz ginger root, the more root 
          surface area will be in contact with the wort, thereby imparting 
          more and more ginger flavor.  I'm guessing that using a potato 
          peeler to inundate the wort with several square inches (feet?) of 
          paper thin slices of ginger would result in a much stronger 
          (perhaps annoying?) ginger flavored beer.  Conversely, I guess 
          that if you don't cut the root at all, and plunk a whole 2oz root
          into the brewpot, you would get a very lightly (perhaps 
          imperceptibly?) spiced brew.  
          
          Although I've made very tasty and enjoyable brews from ginger, I 
          am looking to soon try my hand at a spruce brew using ...gasp!.. 
          liquid spruce essence.   I will go very light on the 
          spruce essence indeed based on all the discourse on spruce beer 
          a la pinesol.  If anyone has advice on collecting/cleaning/cutting 
          real spruce and or juniper berries (or tips?), that would be 
          appreciated as well....although I'm not sure of the supply of 
          fresh non-pesticide treated spruce & juniper in the Houston area.
          
          AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ... GRAPE NUTS.....
          
          Do y'all think we can find more information on brewing GRAPE NUTS 
          in some of the Wine digests?          BA-doom-boom-BOOM       :-)
          
          But seriously folks,  the labeling on the box states that no 
          preservatives are used, and that it is made from wheat and malted 
          barley....  could be an interesting brew.....  REAL CRUNCHY like.
          It might even be good to add a bit of dairy-derived sweeteners 
          (e.g. lactose albeit non-fermentable so I hear) in the formulation.
          Anybody have info on adding such to their brews - cereal, grain, 
          extract, or otherwise?  I've heard SAMS Wholesale Club sells Grape 
          Nuts in 4lb boxes, although I don't know for what price. 
          
          Thanks for the BW.

Subject: Fermentation Temps


Fellow HBDers--
    I have something of a newbie question.  In reading the various sources
on brewing procedures, esp. the yeast FAQ, one of the first things I
noticed was that various strains of yeast have suggested fermentation temps
(i.e., temp range for ale vs. temp range for lager) and optimum temps
(e.g., Wyeast American Ale at 68F).  I recently stuck a Fermometer(tm) on
my primary fermenter, and one of the first things I noticed was that the
ambient temp is one thing, but the temp inside the fermenter is something
else---several degrees higher.  First, let me say that it's no great
surprise to me that fermentation generates heat. 8{)  However, this raises
the question of "optimum" temp.  My assumption, now, is that it's the temp
of the fermenting wort, and not the ambient temp that I should be
monitoring if I want fermentation to occur near the optimum for the given
yeast.  Have I missed something, or am I on the right track here?


Cheers,
Mark

I'll bet the "freshly sanitized from cleaning too many kegs" is an important
part of this working for you.  Considering the amount of crevices in the
skin, it still sounds too risky to me.  Virtually every beginning biology
lab course, even in high school, has the same 1st experiment:  pour two
plates of nutrient agar; put a thumbprint in one; wet a Q-tip with saliva
and glom it into the other plate.  You don't have to work for a biotech giant
like AT&T to see the difference: the thumbprint plate has an order of
magnitude more growth than the saliva plate.  Just as you wrote, Jim, the
risk is considerably lower after fermentation (when sugar levels are low,
alcohol has been produced and there is little O2 for aerobes), but the risk
is non-zero whether you use your hand or mouth (or boiled/cooled water for
that matter) to start your siphon.  I just choose to minimize the risk of
infection at all points in the process and urge all brewers to do the same.
It's not that much more difficult and my time and money are in too limited
a supply to waste on infected beer.

I suspect that the problem my be that you possibly chilled too quickly and
perhaps fermented a bit too cold.  Subsequently, the beer did not finish
completely (green beer flavor --  could it have been acetaldehyde... a green-
apple-like aroma/flavor?) and that you bottled too early.  When chilling from
68F down to 54F, you want to make sure you don't do it too quickly (I've
read 2F per day, but I think that's excessive -- I do 5F per day) or the
yeast will get shocked resulting in a slower-than-normal ferment and higher
finishing gravities.  I think that 58-62F is a better temperature range for
the primary and secondary ferment temperatures for a California Common.  There
is a chance also that it may be an infection, but the "green beer" flavor
leads me to the bottled-too-soon theory.

It is a good sanitizer.  Both B-Brite and One Step are sanitizers, but the
proper government paperwork has not yet gone-through so they could label them
as sanitizers.  Soon.

It's not so much that beta amylase "likes" 140F, it's more like beta amylase
"hates" 155F and above.  At the lower end of the saccharification range, both
amylases work together to make lots of small, fermentable sugars, where as
if you do saccharification at the high end ot the range, after a short while
most of the beta amylase is denatured, leaving only the alpha which cannot
break all the bonds on it's own.  Thus, more dextrins, less fermentability.

Not quite.  To get the most fermentable wort, take the mash to 148F and hold
it there... adding a *little* heat if needed, or make a jacket for the mash
tun out of insulation and slip it over the tun when not heating.  To get a
very unfermentable wort, i.e. chewy, sweet beer, take the mash to 158F and
hold it there.  Note also that, just as most reactions, saccharification at 
cooler temps will take longer than at warmer temps.

Rick asks about a Mead article.


I don't recall the article, but there was a talk given by the owner of
Havell's at the 1988 or 1987 (or was it 1986) AHA Conference.  You can
still get the conference proceedings.  Call the AHA/BP at 303-447-0816.

Rick writes:
>       Why all the fancy yeast?


In my opinion, because of the wide variety in the flavor of the finished
beer that you get when you use different yeasts.  If you want more
diacetyl (butterscotch flavor/aroma) use Wyeast Irish Ale (#1084), if
you want a woody flavor, try Wyeast London Ale (#1028), if you want a
malty beer, use Wyeast European Ale (#1338) which is reported to be a
true German Alt yeast, if you want to brew something like Sierra Nevada
Pale Ale, use Wyeast American Ale (#1056)...  the list goes on and on.
Baker's yeast is cultured specifically for baking, although I've read that
acceptable beer has been made from it.  There are a number of very good
dry beer yeasts available recently (Cooper's, Red Star Ale (the new strain),
Nottingham, Windsor, others) which can make beer as good as the liquid
yeasts, but again, the beer will vary greatly with the yeast you use.


Consider a brewpub like Weinkeller (one in Berwyn, IL, one in Westmont, IL).
It is my understanding that they use only one yeast for all their ales and
another for all their lagers.  In my opinion, all their ales taste alike and
all their lagers taste alike.  Now consider brewpubs like Mishawaka B.C.
or Goose Island.  They use a variety of yeasts and thus their beers each have
their own character.

The integrity of the husks is a good measure of the quality of a malt mill,
but it is incorrect to measure the quality by the amount of flour that is
produced.  There are a number of books (homebrew and professional) that have
said that excessive flour causes set mashes.  I cannot disagree more strongly.
If you dough-in improperly, flour can cause clumping and then balled starch
can later be released into the wort, but a set mash... never!  Oh, and for
those of you that insist on a reference: DeClerq.

The talks are repeated multiple times and more than one is going on during
each session, but the ad in Zymurgy is not the real "schedule" it's just
a rough listing of what's when.  When you arrive at the conference, you will
get a package which will have the complete *real* schedule and that has always
been easy to understand.

OK, my question for the day:
 
Force carbonating...thought I was following directions. Clear
beer to the Cornelius keg.  Chilled.  Up to 30 psi, shook for 15
minutes.  Now, besides sore arms and blistered palms, I got a keg
that would dispense only foam, and foam backflowing through the
regulator...Somebody else said "40 psi and 40 shakes."  Somebody
else said attach the gas line to the liquid side, let the CO2
bubble up from the bottom...My question, is there a text file
somewhere that has the (fairly) straight dope on this?

This is basically true, but you need to know more about the yeast strains
to make such a broad statement.  If the temperatures are too low throughout
the entire fermentation cycle, you won't give the yeast a chance to break
down the diacetyl.  I know - I've produced copious amounts of diacetyl
with both the Wyeast Irish and European ale strins.  My dry stout became
so bad that I had to dump the last 12 bottles or so, but the alt, though
marred by diacetyl, was drinkable to the end.  If you want to use and ale
yeast, but want to reduce the esters, I recommend a diacetyl rest as some
of the lager brewers use.

Subject: BrewTek Yeasties (and a recipe) 


After quickly being convinced about the superiority of liquid yeast over
the dried version, I recently took the next step and tried culturing yeast
from a one of the strains sold by BrewTek. I used their CL-160 British
Draft Ale, and pitched it into a partial mash old ale which is now busily
perking away in the basement.  Everything went according to the directions,
with the only anomaly I noticed being that the super-wort starter was
cloudier than I expected. Aroma and yeast activity were fine, and the odor
coming from the primary airlock seems good    ;-).


Anyway, I admit to a little healthy concern (although no worry) about this
process and these yeasts. I had the whole Wyeast procedure down pat, but
this is different. Does anyone have any wisdom regarding the BrewTek
yeasts they can share?  I'm looking for comments on the various strains and
their uses, as well as storage, procedure, or other comments.


On another note, someone a week or two back was looking for an extract
based Porter recipe.  I had just bottled the following recipe, and
hesitated to give it out without aging and tasting first, but after three
weeks (still a little raw) it appears that it is quite nice, a very
middle-of-the-road porter: nice flavor, not too heavy.  Interestingly, it
is essentially a "use the leftovers" recipe.  The Northwestern Extracts were
available at a great discount from the local homebrew shop when you
purchased more than some amount, and all the rest of the ingredients were
remainders from previous batches. The name is a testimony to my current
employer, which has recently been purchased by a major competitor.

I'm new to the HBD, so excuse if this topic has been discussed before, but I
stumbled across an even cheaper solution. 


I bought one of those outlet timers that people plug their lights into when
they go away on trips - the kind with a clock dial that you set to go on and
off at a specific time. The one I use lets you set the on/off mode in
half-hour increments. After experimenting with a variety of time settings, I
now can maintain a relatively stable temp of 45-48 degrees in my fridge (I
brew lagers primarily) with the device. 


My settings are ON for a half-hour every two hours (ON 30 minutes/OFF 90
minutes). Should you try this approach, your settings may change depending
on the thermostat and efficiency of your fridge, as well as your preferred
temp.
  
You should be able to find these timers for around $7-$15 at a hardware or
department store. Just make sure you get one with half-hour increments - the
common 1-hour timers don't provide enough control (I've tried it).




On another note: Does anyone have instructions for fabricating a
counter-pressure filler?

I agree with Ulick Staffords opinion (an educated one at that) on sucking
siphons.  I have been homebrewing for the past 4 years and I too use the mouth
siphon method -  I have never had a problem with it.  I think an important
thing to remember for those people that worry about 'contamination' is that as
long as the proper "infection" is started quickly (pitching yeast - 8oz or
more) there is no problem with siphoning by mouth.  Also, there are many
sources of bacteria in our homebrewing environments that may pose a threat to
those sterility mongers out there (other than mouth siphoning that is).  In the

Subject:  Maltmill vs Wheat Malt


I have received questions from several people regarding how well my 
JS Maltmill crushes wheat malt, so I thought I would report the data 
from my first attempt at wort production from wheat.  I have the 
non-adjustable $99 version which was recommended by JS.  Here is the 
result:


Grain bill:  5 lb German wheat malt (from Heart's of Orlando, FL)
             3 lb 2-row Briess pale malt  (normal 154-146 mash with 
                                            protein rest at 122 deg)


Final Wort Volume: 5 gal exactly


Specific Gravity: 1.050 (corrected to 60 deg F, actual was 48 `at`72 F)


Extraction:  31.25 pts*gal/lb grain


Bottom Line:  The non-adjustable Maltmill does indeed work for the
              german wheat malt that I used.


Other Comments:  The sparge was much faster than I had expected.  I 
use a lauter tun constucted from a plactic bucket to which has been 
fitted an easymash-type system (single copper tube with SS screen 
wrapped into a tube, the whole thing connected to the plastic 
spigot).  I *used to* use a zapap bucket-in-a-bucket but have found 
my new method a little easier.

Subject: Beer as food, head retention, blowoff


>From *Jeff* Renner 
 
Don Rudolph asks about beer as food.  There was an article in zymurgy two or 
three years back that said basically (paraphrasing from memory):  There are 
many wonderful reasons to drink beer, but, folklore to the contrary, 
nutrition is not one of them.  Beer contains some carbohydrates, a little of 
the B vitamins, a little protein, few minerals (not even iron in stout; 
sorry, nursing mothers), virtually no fat (one plus), and rather caloric (7 
cal/gr.) and toxic ethanol.  For nutrition, you are far better off to have a 
slice of bread.  Sorry. 
 
Rich Scotty asks about fermentation  temperatures.  From my experience, I 
would say that 66^F is not only acceptable for Am. ale yeast 1056, but 
ideal.  High enough for good rate of fermentation, low enough to minimize 
fusel production and weird off flavors.  Your insulating jacket would help 
hold in metabolic heat (yes, yeast does produce some).  Aren't basements 
wonderful?  I have two insulated corner closets in mine that max out at 66^ 
in the heat of summer and drop to 48^ in winter, perfect for lager 
fermentation. 
 
Mike Zentner asks about head retention in light beers.  Try substituting 
about 15% carapils for pale or pilsner malt.  This should help and also give 
some additional body that may be welcome in a low gravity beer. 
 
Chris Strickland asks about nasties in his blowoff tube.  I, too, like the 
blowoff method.  I start with an airlock, and as soon as I get a positive 
pressure, switch to a sanitized blowoff tube into water with a bit of 
bleach.  Should keep nasties out of the beer.  I used to put the blowoff 
tube on immediately, but once had enough negative pressure either through 
cooling and/or oxygen absorbtion that it pulled bleach water halfway up the 
1 inch tube. I pulled the end out of the water, and a bubble rose the entire 
length of the tube and pushed a few cc of bleach water into the wort.  I 
calculated that it was only a few ppb, but I got chlorophenols bad enough to 
take to the brewclub meeting as textbook example.  Five gallons feeding the 
septic system critters!  I think Miller's method really is just a variation 
on two stage fermentation.  I generally rack when fermentation slows way 
down, but sometimes haven't got around to it, and have waited a couple of 
weeks.  Not necessarily recommended, but it doesn't seem to be a problem. 
 
In yesterday's post, I added an extra "c" to the word protoscope (as in 
"protein") and got proctoscope (as in, well, you know).  And then asked for 
advice on how to use it.  Sheesh!  It must have taken restraint HBDers not 
to tell me.  Thanks.

I have an adjustable maltmill from JSP, and I also noticed decreased
throughput.  (BTW, my mm has the groved rollers.)  I have played with
adjustments extensively and even took great pains to get the rollers
parallel again.  I believe I have isolated the problem, though.  It
seems that the rollers get a bit crusted with compacted flour and this
seems to make them more "slippery" than when they are new.  I haven't
tried it yet, but I think a wire brush (copper?) would clean up the
rollers well and allow them to suck in the grain once more.  This may be
the same problem which Jim experienced with his glatt. 


BTW, while I think product announcements are fine, and even allow that
representatives should be free to BRIEFLY defend SEVERE misinformation
about their products, Jack's post in HBD #1428 was too long and
contained too many unnecessary jabs at the competition.  What counts as
severe misinformation and brievity is a judgement call, but I for one will
surely feel free to inform "advertisers" of MY judgements when I feel
the need.

I stand by the previous statements I made.  I compared the two mills 
side-by-side using both hand cranking and motorization to power the mills.  
Several different grains were used.  THE MALTMILL DID NOT FEED THE GRAIN 
THROUGH AS FAST AS THE GLATT MILL DID.  I JUDGED THE QUALITY OF THE 
CRUSH TO BE SUPERIOR WITH THE ADJUSTABLE GLATT MILL.  Call me 
suspicious, but I do not take anyone's (especially product 
representatives) word as gospel unless I have corroborating evidence.  In 
this limited test, THE GLATT MILL WAS SUPERIOR.

I understand that some people have had this problem.  In fact, the 
manufacturer is quite open about the fact that the plactic gears do have 
problems at least occassionally and verbally promises to replace them any 
time they fail, regardless of whether the mill is motorized.  I HAVE HAD 
NO SUCH PROBLEMS.

Agreed.  I perceive it to be an advantage and therefore it is.

I called the homebrew supply shop at which I purchased the Glatt mill to 
be sure my figures were correct.  Indeed, I was wrong.  I paid $85 for the 
Glatt mill on a one-time good deal.  His price is now $95.  For the 
comparable Maltmill with adjustable rollers and gear drive, the shop 
owner owner quoted me a price of $180.  THIS IS A DIFFERENCE OF $85, not 
$40.  Sorry, next time I'll check my facts more carefully!   


I am not trying to convince anyone that the Maltmill is a piece of crap.  
It is not.  Neither is the Glatt mill.  Both produce crushed malt from 
which comes excellent beer.


If I understand him correctly, Jack has not compared the two products in 
side-by-side crush tests.  In fact, I believe that he stated that he has 
not even seen the Glatt mill.  I HAVE compared them and have reached my 
conclusions based on these tests, not on what someone else has told me.


I resent this forum being used to publish untested, defamatory, and/or 
misleading statements in a blatant attempt at self-promotion.  It is 
both unethical and unforgivable.     


I reiterate, I have no connection with any company selling maltmills.  My 
interest is in disseminating what I know to be accurate information and 
in correcting what I know to be erroneous information so that homebrewers 
can make informed decisions.
