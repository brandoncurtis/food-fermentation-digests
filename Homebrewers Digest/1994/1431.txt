Subject: head retention in "light" beers


In HBD # 1428 Mike Zentner asked for advice because his low gravity beer 
lacked head retention.  I am experiencing a similar problem in the 
following batch.


2 cans John Bull light unhopped malt extract
1/2 # dark crystal malt
handful of choc malt
2 oz. cascades


I crushed my grains and brought to a near boil before removing, rinsed 
grains with boiled water.  Then I added the two cans of extract ~1/2 hour 
apart (my brewpot was in danger of flowething over) and slowly brought to 
a boil before adding ~1 oz. of hops.
Boiled for 45 min and added 1/2 oz. hops & 1 tsp. of IM.  Boiled 
additional 15 min.  Diluted 4 gall. boil to final volume of scant 7 gall.
It took two hours to cool w/o a wort chiller.  
Pitched a package of wyeast special london ale yeast.  4 day primary then 
racked to secondary where I added 1/2 oz. hops.  After a 5 day secondary 
I bottled.  


OG 1.042; FG 1.012


The beer is 3 weeks in the bottle.  It tastes great, looks good, but 
lacks a good head.  I thought that I had enough malt to get a good head but 
when I pour a bottle I get ~1/3 in. of head that quickly disappears.  
Even in the short time that the head is present it consists of large soapy 
type bubbles rather than smaller bubbles that stay longer.  What's up???  TIA

I'd like to toss in my two cents (since I couldn't possibly BUY 
anything with them:-)


A major point that is often forgotten is the decoction mash. The 
increased melanoidin production adds considerably to that malty flavor.
The water content in Munich is high in carbonates and low in sulfates
(temp and permanent hardness, respectively). The sulfates add a dry
palate to the beer (like the high sulfate content of Burton-like pale
ales). I don't know what water treatment the Bavarian breweries use
for their water for lagers, but I know that Spaten uses CaCl2 in their
Franziskaner weissbier. I think they try to avoid gypsum altogether.


Third, the continental malts used for German lagers is higher in SMM
than other malts (like American or British). The slight residual DMS
contributes to the malt flavor. And lastly, most people complain that
their lager ferments smell like rotten eggs--a slightly residual sulfury
component is actually a welcome addition to increasing the malty profile.

>Has anyone thought about using an *inverted* soda-keg for a fermenter?


I hadn't thought about it, but it sounds like a good idea.  Its interesting
what you think of when properly motivated.  For example, I was thinking the
other day about doing a (mostly) closed transfer between secondary and keg.
Purge the keg with CO2, and bleed off the excess pressure.  Put the liquid
and gas fittings on the keg with loose tubing on each (sanitize the liquid
tube).  Put the liquid tube in the secondary and suck on the gas hose to
start the siphon.  The beer goes from the secondary, which is filled with CO2
(except for the small amount of air mixing at the top) to the keg, which is
also filled with CO2.  One nice thing about this is you can sanitize the keg
days ahead of time, and do the transfer at your leisure.


Another idea I had was to pull the guts from a water heater and use it to
control your mash/sparge water tank.  I'm talking about yanking the element,
temp sensor, and control box.  The temperature range should be just about
right (maybe WARM for mash water, and HOT for sparge).


Or, how about this one:  build a small keg system for that true British style
cask conditioned ale.  I'm talking about a 1 gallon system or so, which could
be filled from the keg (with or without a counter pressure arrangement).
Then, draw off the beer, allowing air to fill the void as they do across the
pond.  This allows for experiments in shelf life, etc. without sacrificing
the entire (in my case) 5 gallon batch.  It doesn't have to be a pressure
vessel, I don't suppose.  Maybe a 1 gallon cider bottle would work.  Keep
those ideas coming.


Cheers,
Norm

Anybody out there filter?  I have seen at least one method for
sanitizing and storing filters for beer, but would be interested in
hearing about other methods.  Also, have you noticed a decrease in any
of the flavors due to filtering (i.e. hop aroma, bitterness,
maltiness)?

I'd like to thank all those who responded to my brewing aroma problem.  I'm
taking a pro-active approach since all he's doing is whining to the manager.
The real problem is related to his getting on the board 4 yrs ago and getting
that board to make him property manager.  I was president of the associatikon
last year when he was replaced by a competent, professional management company.
This new professional manager sends letters when he gets complaints.  I've got
quite a collection going on this topic.   Here's the letter I sent
with the names changed to protect the dickheads
- -----------
                                                         May 19, 1994




Mr Property manager,


As a result of Mr. Budswiller's sudden chronic complaints re; aromas
produced by my hobby, I sought advice from several Internet user
forums in which I participate.


I received numerous responses which ranged from sympathy & revenge, to
legal referrals, civil liberties issues, and technical or engineering
solutions.  I found this last to be of most immediate use.  It was
suggested that if air flow between both units and the common hallway
were restricted the alleged problem would cease.


As an interim solution, I will place a rolled-up bath towel along
the bottom of my front door during the boil.  This should reduce
much of the air movement between my unit and our hallway/landing.
I will continue the practice of propping open the common door and
leaving it open during, and for at least two hours after the boil.
Assuming Mr. Budswiller also keeps his door closed, I'm confident
he will be unaffected by any aromas produced in my kitchen.


A more permanent solution would be for the board to consider
weather-proofing both doors.  This would eliminate any aromas which
either of us might fund objectionable.  I suggest this as a
cost-effective solution in other buildings where aromas are a
perceived issue.


Please share these thoughts with the board and let me know what it
decides.


                          Sincerely.
                          blah blah blah.....
- ----------------------------------
and now on to something much more serious....  About 6 weeks back I posted
about making a mashton out of a Rubbermade 48-quart cooler with a copper
manifold jammed into the spiggot hole, and a piece of transfer tubing
attached to the spiggot and a pinch roller to control sparge flow.


My first beer thru ( a porter) can only be described as a poly-vinyl porter.
It has a combined aroma of roast malt and new car plastic.  The taste is
intensely plastic/chemical and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.  I asume
that something from the new cooler leached into the mash.  Also has a very
strange alchahol/chemical harshness.  I suspect the stuff is toxic and
will dump the batch after getting a few more opinions.  Anyone have a
similar experience ?  I'm worried about the future safety and usefulness
of my new toy.
- -----------
My .02 worth on siphoning.  I usually siphon by mouth but usually do one of 2
things...
1.  a  'beer condom'  or  2" piece of 1/2" tubing which fits over the end of
    3/8" siphon hose.  Suck on that and pull it off when the flow starts
2.  rinse mouth with 1/2 oz. Jack Daniels or similar immediately before
    sucking.  (don't know if it works but I feel better for doing it   :)
I rarely have infection problems, even with older beers.

Subject: Maple Syrup Fermentation


All,


The controversey is over.


I just hung up the phone with Sumner Williams of the Proctor Maple
Research Center at the University of Vermont.  It seems Maplwutt
has a traditional name.  "Sap Beer".


Sumner was very helpful in giving me a little background in Sap Beer,
and why wouldn't he be helpful... he's a homebrewer!!!!!!  Small world
isn't it!


Anyway the first reference to fermenting Maple Sugar/Syrup is found
around 1791 where it was discouraged because of puritan attitudes, not
because of the end product.


Sumner also references a book, "The Maple Sugar Book" by Helen and
Scott Nearing (c)1950, which talks about the making of Sap Beer.
Sumner paraphrased a historic recipe from the book to me over the
phone...


"Take one pound of hops and place them into a clean barrel.  Fill with
sap (when it is running in the spring).  Allow to ferment and the beer
will be ready in two weeks.  The beer will remain good until June..."


I think I'll stick to the current fermentation technology, thank you.
:-)


A couple of data points here...


Maple Sap is 2% sugar.. Sucrose and Fructose.
As the Spring progresses, the Maple tree's natural metabolism starts to
convert the Sucrose into Invert sugar.


As Sumner has access to a PC and MODEM I invited him to join in on
conversations on HomeBrew University Midwest at (780) 705-7263


I thanked him wholehartedly and will be sending him a bottle of my
Sap Beer in gratitude!

Absolutely wonderful. Very, very full body. Chocolate malt comes thru nicely.
Nice balance between hops and sweetness. Great creamy head (brown color). 
Head and mouthfeel of a Guiness, taste of a porter. Best beer I've ever made!
Sure am glad I made 8 gallons of this one!

Does anyone have a recipe for Sam Smith's Nut Brown Ale?  I am a

recipe, I can ask friends in my homebrew club on how to convert an 
all-grain recipe.  I have Cat's Meow I and II, so if you can point me

Now for my yeast questions.  What strains of yeast (ale & lager) are 
more suitable for fermenting at warmer temps?  Over the winter, my 
apartment was a comfortable 65-70 F, which I guess is also 
comfortable for most yeasts, but in the summer, the temp will 
probably be at least 75 F most of the time.  Are there specific 
yeasts which I should be certain to avoid at these warmer temps?  
What are the effects, in general, of fermenting at warmer temps?

Subject:  Brew Filtration systems


Hello fellow brewers,
  I have been brewing quite some time now....Not! I have been in the
brew circle for around 5 months now and my head is full of questions. I
have so many I don't know where to start. I don't think I'll ask all of
them at one time but I do have one that needs a good answer. I have
noticed that when I make a batch of brew (I am on my fifth batch, a
stout.) I make sure that there are not that many small particles left in my
wort, and I use Irish moss in the brew and don't shake up the
secondary before bottling, but I still get some residue left in the bottom
of the bottle after it ages and I pour it. I bottle in 25 oz. bottles and it
seem such a shame to waste that little bit of brew on the bottom of each
bottle. I know that you can still drink it but I don't care too much for the
taste it leaves in your mouth.
Is there some way to filter the brew? Does the filtering the brew cause it
to loose anything? And if there is some way to filter this stuff is it worth
it? Should I just get use to wasting that little bit with every bottle? 
Please let me know what can be done to solve this problem. I was
always told that when you waste good beer it is alcohol abuse in its
worst form.
Thanks in advance for any assistance.

Subject: sour extract brews?


A brew buddy and co=worker of mine has asked me to poll the collective
wisdom of the digest in hopes to finding the cause of 3 failed batches.
The types made are a lager and 2 ales. Three different yeasts were used.
They were made in 2 different kitchens using different utensils. They all
fermented properly and the brewer is very miticulus about sanitation.
The problem is they all have a sour taste to them.
The only common denominator is the extract that was purchased mail order
from bulk not canned. The yeast all were "shop" cultures but were different
varieties. He also uses distilled water for his brews. He is also very 
carefull to maintain constant temps and keep light out.


My suggestion was his extract was infected but he feels it was the yeast
that was infected. I may make a batch of all grain with his last yeast
from his supply but I sure would hate to waste a batch. I thought we 
maybe make a 1 gal. "batch" of started and let it ferment out to test
the yeast for the sour qualities. Do you think this is a valid test.

Subject: Irish Moss


I was on an educational outting sponsored by the Audubon Society
on beachcombing this weekend (Massachusetts).
To my delight, one of the seaweed samples collected on the beach was
identified as Irish Moss.  I told everyone about beer and Irish Moss
and they all mumbled yeah, yeah, yeah and went on to look at the 
periwinkles.  Has anyone out there picked their own Irish moss for 
brewing and how does one process it?

Subject: Nutritional content of beers


In HBD #1428, Don Rudolph asked about the value of beer as food.
A while back, perhaps a couple of years, Bud Grant of Grant's
Brewery of Yakima Washington tried to print nutritional
information for his beers on lables to be attatched to the bottles.
The Federal Government's representative Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (motto: We love cults: barbecued...) came down on him
like a truck of empties. It seems that there is no way that the
government would allow the words 'beer' and 'food' or 'nutition'
to be mentioned in the same sentence. Bud was forbidden to print
this information on his bottles.


Now for the good news. He did print up a bajillion little cards
that when folded up, can be left on bar tables, so that patrons
can plan their evening menus while loosing focus. I visited
Grant's taproom last year, and I swiped one of these cards.
Here is the information that the government doesn't want you to
know. The feds will be knockin down our doors for sure now...

Now I for one am all for something that gives me 170% of all
the B12 I need, in fact, I sometimes think that I need more
vitamin B12 than most people. Furthermore, I can
medicate myself. Who needs wormwood when I've got Folacin???

p.s. Sorry about the multiple posts. I've been away for a while,
and I'm just busy as hell trying to catch up on the HBD posts
that were stacking up in my absence....


One thing about this group I've noticed. When someone puts a
ball (post) in play, there's no shortage of people willing
to pick it up and run with it.
Good enthusiasm. Potential for blood...

Subject: A Schmidling customer sings




Text item: Text_1


Jim King complained to Jack Schmidling about "whining and blatant 
competitor bashing."  In general, I agree.  I think praising one's own 
products (in this case, the MaltMill (tm)) and trashing a competitor's 
(the Glatt mill) is a belittling trait and will diminish one's 
credibility (even if I do find Jack's comments more interesting than 
most that appear in the HBD.)


Here's one customer's point of view.  I recently purchased a 
MaltMill(tm) and think it's wonderful.  I wish I could compare it to a 
Glatt, but I couldn't find anyone in Portland, OR who had one, and no 
stores could get one.


I bought the nonadjustable model.  Contrary to Jeff King's comments, the 
handle goes on and off easily, just by tightening or loosening a nut 
(maybe the adjustable model is different?).  It's heavy duty and solid 
as a rock. The base fits perfectly over a plastic pail and there's no 
dust during grinding.  Hand cranking 11 pounds of grain took about five 
or ten minutes (your time will vary depending on how many times you stop 
for a homebrew). And IMHO, the grind was great.  I got 30 points out of 
the batch, which was the highest yield I've ever gotten, even when I 
ground the grain on the roller mill at Steinbarts in Portland.


I haven't attached a motor, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the 
warranty didn't seem to preclude the possibility.


I have no affiliation with JSP, just a happy customer.

Hi all,
A disgusting newbie question: what should I use (if anything) to care for 
my pretty stainless steel pot that I use for brewing? It seems like I 
remember my grandmother saying something about how to care for stainless, 
or was that sterling silver? Is gentle soap and water with prompt drying 
ok? It was a gift, and         I am a really poor grad student; if I mess up 
this pot-nothing to brew in!

I haven't been very happy with the English hops I have bought in California.


I'll be going to London in early August.  Does anyone know where I can get hops
there?  I'm most interested in whole hops and hop plugs (not pellets).


Also, does anyone know of any good beer stores in London for English and
continental bottled beers?


Thanks,

I suspect that unfiltered home brewed would be higher in B complex vitamins 
due to the presence of yeast, especially if the sediment is consumed. 
 
Segal's conclusion after giving possible reasons to drink beer is "Beer for 
overall health and nutrition?  You've got to be kidding."  This is of course 
before the recent findings about positive benefits of moderate alcohol 
consumption and heart disease protection.  But still, I have to agree with 
her that beer consumption is "fun" or "empty" calories, something most of us 
have room for in our total diet, but not a significant source or nutrients. 
 
Art Steinmetz asks about the "skin" or husk on wheat.  That is the bran, 
something barley has too.  Wheat is a naked grain, the husk was selectively 
bred away, probably thousands of years ago.  There are some primitive husked 
wheats.  I believe emmer is one. 
 
I just brewed a weizen using home malted wheat (and yes, the MM(tm) did a 
great job, but it seems to work best to mix the malts together first to get 
the best feed).   I am surprised that maltsters haven't discovered Michigan 
soft, white, winter wheat for malting.  I've grown this myself in the past, 
although not the batch I malted.  The fact that it is white (the color of 
the bran, as opposed to red) means that it also has fewer tannins and 
phenols, and soft wheat has lower protein (between 9 - 10%).  This should be 
perfect for malting and using unmalted in Belgians.  I malted it 
conventionally, then dried it in a pillow case in the clothes dryer, then 
kilned it in an oven!  I've used it in small amounts before and it worked 
fine, this is the first time I've used it for a majority of the grain bill.  
The mash went as quickly as ever (1 gal./6 minutes with insulated Zapap, and 
final extraction rate was good, just under 30 pts/gal/lb. 
 
Christopher Mack asks about weizen yeast - why do the biggies filter and 
repitch lager yeast at bottling, why does their yeast sediment taste so 
yummy and his so lousy, and what is the best temperature for weizen yeast. 
 
One at a time.  As Dave Miller in Brewing Techniques (vol. 1, no. 2) points 
out, "wild" yeasts, which S. delbrueckii (the weizenbier yeast) can be 
considered to be, continue to produce their "off" flavors the longer they 
are in contact with the beer.  This is the reason to remove it at the end of 
fermentation and replace it with neutral lager yeast for bottle 
conditioning.  Keeping the temperature down will also help keep the wilder 
flavors under control with this yeast.  Chris says he would brew with the 
YeastLab Bavarian Weizen yeast if someone would attest to it.  One of our 
club members took Best of Show with an *extract* beer made with this yeast 
this past year in the S.N.O.B.S. competition in Cleveland.  It tasted 
terrific and a judge's comment was "I can't believe this isn't a commercial 
beer."  YeastLab's instructions for temperatures are 66^ - 70^ F, but low 
60s (where I have mine going) works fine, and should temper the phenolics.  
Over 70^ is going to bring on the bananas.  Nontypical disclaimer - I have 
no affiliation but it is produced here in town, so I may have a local 
booster's pride. 
 
I think Christopher's sediment may taste lousy not due to yeast, but to 
other late sedimenting stuff like tannins, maybe trub, etc.  A longer 
secondary might help, as would gelatin or Irish moss before racking prior to 
bottling. 
 
And Charlie Burke, you are right.  Decolorized iodine won't work.  The 
regular should be right next to it on the drug store shelf.

Subject: Any Help/Thoughts Would Be Appreciated




I asked about the strange white stuff floating in my
secondary a few weeks ago.  I got one reply by private
email and someone on the net telling us newbies not
to use gypsum.  I have tried to relax and bottled the
brew (a pale ale with 1, count it, 1 teaspoon of
gypsum).  A week and a half later, I have very tiny
(sand or smaller) granuals floating (in suspension?)
in the bottles.  The rest of the recipe was a variant
on the basic bitters (extract) recipes I have seen in 
Charlie P. and elsewhere.


I'll ask again:  any opinions?  Is this infection, gypsum,
something else?  Is there any way to get rid of this stuff 
(a pinch of something and yeast and re-capping?).  Could
some of you pause discussing the relative merits of
mills and advertising on the net long enough to give new
brewers like myself some help?  Thanks in advance.  Private
email is fine.


Cheers,

Subject: Converting Brix to sg


A quick conversion from % brix (as sucrose) and sg (20C for sucrose) is to
take the brix reading, multiply by 0.00425 and then add 0.9988.  So a Brix
of 18 would equal 1.075.  The actual value is 1.074, close enough for me.
I don't know how much difference there would be in sg between glucose and
sucrose (the refractometers are calibrated usually for % sucrose).  the
error would probably be minor.

Re: Julie Espy's comment about tax-deductible tickets...
 
If one receives value (like a subscription) for a contribution, the
contribution (or at least the portion equal to the value of the
subscription) is NOT tax-deductible. So if one receives anything for
the ticket price (like free beer), the ticket price is not deductible.
 
This, of course, should not matter when it comes to helping out a
worthy cause (like the Hospice of San Luis Obispo County) or to
attending a beer festival! And although I will not attend (living
across the country), I appreciate being kept informed about all
festivals and competitions.

Subject: Wheatbeer and Temperature control (two issues)


Mike McCaw asks if anyone has information on dispensing wheatbeer from 
kegs.  I worked in a bar in Edinburgh (Scotland) which had  Schneider 
Weiss on draught (I can recommend it to anyone lucky enough to 
have access to a supply).  We had similar fobbing problems when it was 
first installed.  These were cured by the addition of a length of beerline of 
very small diameter (1/16th" internal I think) and exceptional length 
between the keg and the tap.  The pressure at the regulator was NOT 
adjusted as increasing it resulted in a return of the fobbing.  While 
this solution worked it did so at the price of a vastly reduced pour 
rate, and a slight (max 3 degF) increase in the temperature of the beer 
once dispensed.  I hope this helps.
        Living in Australia, I am finding it difficult to control the 
temperature of fermentation.  The obvious solution of fermenting in a 
fridge seems a rather expensive answer.  Brewing in the winter is not the 
answer either as temperatures can range from 4-26 Deg C over a day.  Does 
anybody have any cheap alternatives to using a fridge?
