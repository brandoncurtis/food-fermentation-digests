 >From: jim.king`at`kandy.com (Jim King)
 
 > I like the crush from the Glatt better....
 
 This is a subjective statement that should not be confused with the actual 
 crush quality.  In the serious world, the crush is evaluated by sieve 
 analysis and in the most recent study I know of, the Glatt was not even 
 different from the MM, let alone "better".  The same study indicated that the 
 best crush came from two passes through a fixed MM, with the Corona a close 
 second.  The adjustable MM would have come off best if it had been adjusted 
 correctly.  Because of its unique, non-parallel rollers, just setting it with 
 a feeler in the center makes it look like a fixed mill.
 
 > and I like the fact that it does not come connected to a base, so I can 
 attach it to whatever surface I like.
 
 The base on the MM is a feature that costs money and allows totally portable 
 and dust free use.  You can obviously remove it or clamp it to a table for 
 fixed use.
 
 >  Also, the adjustable Glatt is only a little more expensive than the 
 non-adjustable Schmidling Mill...
 
 I would still like to hear from someone who can prove that it makes better 
 beer than a fixed MM.  So, for a "little more" you get a mill that is less 
 than half the size, whose critical components are plastic and an acknowledged 
 reputation for catastrophic failure.   I may be a little thick-headed and 
 biased but I just don't understand why people wait in line for them.
 
 > In summary, If Mr. Glatt ever learns to run a business (ie: shipping
 in quantity enough to satisfy the demand), he will definitely give you a
 run for your money.
 
 If he doesn't solve the reliability problems before upping his volume, he 
 will soon wish people would stop buying them.
 
 He is welcome to whatever share of the market he can capture and there is 
 certainly more than I need to satisfy my urge to get my hands dirty.  My only 
 interest is to defend my product from misinformation and make sure that 
 prospective customers understand what the tradeoffs really are.  Thus far, 
 the choices seem to be a Model T, a Yugo, a VW and a Rolls Royce but without 
 the price differential one would expect.
 
 >From: wolfgang`at`cats.ucsc.edu (Robert F. Dougherty)
 >Subject: maltmill throughput...
 
 >I have an adjustable maltmill from JSP, and I also noticed decreased
 throughput.  (BTW, my mm has the groved rollers.)  I have played with
 adjustments extensively and even took great pains to get the rollers
 parallel again.  I believe I have isolated the problem, though.  It
 seems that the rollers get a bit crusted with compacted flour and this
 seems to make them more "slippery" than when they are new.  I haven't
 tried it yet, but I think a wire brush (copper?) would clean up the
 rollers well and allow them to suck in the grain once more. 
 
 A normal (steel) wire brush will do a good job of cleaning out the groves and 
 this should should have been pointed out in the instructions.
 
 However, as time goes by, the sharp edges will eventually wear down but this 
 is not usually a problem with adjustable mills.  This is the reason I have 
 switched to the coarser texture about a year ago.  
 
 > This may be the same problem which Jim experienced with his glatt.
 
 Possibly but the situation is reversed, viz., he is having problems with the 
 new diamond knurl that Glatt has switched to.
 
 >Jack's post in HBD #1428 was too long and contained too many unnecessary 
 jabs at the competition.
 
 I apologize for the length but as this is an open information exchange, I 
 sort of consider the "jabs" as information that can be taken as simply data 
 points which can be verified or countered by the readers.   But I see no 
 reason not to point them out just because I happen to make a competative 
 product.

Subject: Mills Part two


 
 >From: Allen Ford <allen`at`darwin.sfbr.org>
 
 >I called the homebrew supply shop at which I purchased the 
 Glatt mill to be sure my figures were correct.  Indeed, I 
 was wrong.  I paid $85 for the Glatt mill on a one-time good 
 deal.  His price is now $95.  For the comparable Maltmill 
 with adjustable rollers and gear drive, the shop owner owner 
 quoted me a price of $180.  THIS IS A DIFFERENCE OF $85, not
 $40.  Sorry, next time I'll check my facts more carefully!
 
 No, just stick to an objective definition of "comparable".   
 The plastic gears are an integral part of the Glatt and it 
 will not function without them.  The precision ground, steel 
 gears on the MM are an option that may improve the 
 efficiency in high volume use but are not required or even 
 useful in homebrewing applications.
 
 The MM is more than twice as large as the Glatt as has been 
 stated ad nausiam and hardly seems comparable and it needs 
 to be proven that adjustability is of any real advantage to 
 a homebrewer.
 
 >If I understand him correctly, Jack has not compared the 
 two products in side-by-side crush tests.  In fact, I 
 believe that he stated that he has not even seen the Glatt 
 mill.  I HAVE compared them and have reached my conclusions 
 based on these tests, not on what someone else has told me.
 
 I purchased a Listerman mill and a Corona and did exhaustive 
 tests and published the results.  I will be delighted to buy 
 (or swap for) a Glatt for the same purpose when it becomes a 
 final design or at least an off the shelf product.  At the 
 moment it is like nailing jellow to a wall and would no 
 doubt change again about the time I finished testing one.  I 
 can't even get a data sheet on it and have relied on 
 articles posted here and comments made by customers who have 
 called complaining about it.
 
 >I resent this forum being used to publish untested, 
 defamatory, and/or misleading statements in a blatant 
 attempt at self-promotion.  It is both unethical and 
 unforgivable.
 
 I agree and again apologize if it came off that way but my 
 information is based on the above and in addition, the Wort 
 Processors did a review of the mills about a year ago and 
 much information can be gleaned from their report.  There is 
 also a review to be published in the Fall issue of Zymurgy 
 but as it has not yet been published, I can only allude to 
 the results and not cite them directly.
 
 
 >From: jim.king`at`kandy.com (Jim King)
 
 >  The mills are EXTREMELY equal....
 
 Hmmmmm....  nice choice of words.
 
 > I especially find offensive your attempt to compare the
 price of the adjustable Glatt to that of your fixed roller 
 mill in an attempt to claim that they cost the same.  
 (rather than comparing to your adjustable mill, as would be 
 more appropriate).
 
 What you find offensive is simply  my reaction to Glatt 
 promoters claiming that the MM costs $200.  One can now pay 
 $1000 for a MM but that doesn't mean one need to spend that 
 much to do what can be done with a Glatt.
 
 As I have stated frequently, if one can make beer as good 
 with a fixed MM as an adjustable Glatt, it is not offensive 
 to point this out.  It is doing prospective customers a 
 favor.
 
 >  In addition, you try to imply that your mill is easier 
 and better for motorizing. 
 
 Not quite.  I said it was designed with that in mind and has 
 bronze bearings in lieu of plastic and the warranty is not 
 in any way effected by motorizing it.
 
 > The Schmidling mill that I have worked with has a handle
 that is VERY difficult to remove...
 
 Not sure what the problem was but it is as difficult as 
 loosening the set screw and sliding if off.  
 
 >  I did not intend to keep a "my mill is better than yours" 
 battle going....
 
 Prove it.  If I wait a few more days, you will probablay 
 force me to extend this  even more.  Don't take it personal.  
 Enjoy your mill and remember about stick and stones?
 
  > Try letting yourcustomers sing the praises of your mill, 
 rather than doing it yourself.
 
 They do but it is not their responsibility to defend my 
 product and I reserve the right to do it as I see fit.
 
 And for a final word to put things into perspective and 
 close out this interesting thread.....
 
 The MM dwells on a separate plane from other mills.  Its 
 supreme performance virtually forcloses any situation where 
 one would even consider an alternative.  The malt flows over 
 the rollers while you bask in near limousine comfort.  
 However, motorizing your MM would squander a sublime 
 pleasure.  Elegant polished aluminum, natural fiberboard, 
 dual massive rollers, smooth rolling oil-impregnated 
 bearings and the finest assembly staff in the world, enhance 
 this monument to perfection.  But no single feature 
 distinguishes the MM; its glory is the way all is 
 synthesized into an awesome, incomparable whole.

Subject: Water heater controls


In HBD1431, a suggestion was made to use the guts of an electric water heater
for sparge/mash water heating. A few points of information....


For most of our collective lives, the "center detent" on storage water
heaters was set to deliver water at about 140F. However, in the last few
years, concerns about the potential liabilility of scalding the young/old
have caused manufacturers to change the center detent temperature to equal to
120F.


You should also know that the thermostats on residential storage water
heaters usually have large deadbands. That is, they cool down well below
setpoint before they turn on. And, they go well above before they turn off.


So, expect temperatures below what you need for mashing with a considerable
swing

Subject: a couple things


My first question today-  How do you figure specific gravity that results
from diluting a known gravity and volume with a known volume of water? In
this case I diluted 7 gal of 1.067 into 10 gal. and didn't use my hydrometer
on the new volume.
In Papazian's book he has a little chart and also says that the rate of
dilution and change in specific gravity are not the same at various
densities.
Is there a formula that handles this? Or even a more complete chart or graph?
Re: malt mills. I have this great idea of converting an old ringer from a
washing machine into a roller mill. At first i thought of replacing rubber
rollers w/ metal ones but on any rollers I 've seen so far, the rubber is so
damn hard that it may work as is!
Has anyone tried THIS???
One more thing. I've just started mashing and used some rice in my last mash.
After boiling the rice to gelatinization I added it to mash. The thing is
that examining sparged grain, the rice seems to have disappeared! Did it all
convert?

Subject: "brew King" mini-kegs


Hello fellow brewers,


I have been listening to the HBD for a while, but this is my first post.
Please have mercy...
My wonderful and charming wife recently gave me this mini-keg system from
the local hombrew shop. She said "the guy said it was great". It looks
(in theory anyway) like a neat device, but I thought I would tap the
collective wisdom of the HBD before I use it.


The thing is a 5 liter can with a plastic plug. It came with a tap that
has a tube that reaches the bottom of the can and holds co2 cartridges.
The name on the box is Beer King.


now the questions:


        - Should the beer be primed as usual??
        - will the plastic plug be blown off?
        - If I don't drink it all in one sitting, will the co2 cartridge
          keep it fresh?
        - Does anyone have any experience with this thing?
        - Should I keep it or return it?


Thanks

George:


I *LOVE* my JSP Malt Mill.  I Did get the adjustable option ($20-$30) but
rarely use it.  Most malts crush fine on the factory setting.  Besides the
adjustability is only on one side of the roller being adjusted.
It works but I'm still unconvinced it was worth it, but hey, you never
know.  It is very reliable in "stock" form with a rubber ring pinched between
the passive and active roller, but has the potential to wear out.  There is an
expensive ($100 I think) option that converts the whole thing to active drive
on both rollers.  This option is probably overkill unless you mill 50# per
week.  Good luck.

Subject: SG Corrections


Rich Larsen asked about an automated adjustment procedure for correcting SG
readings, to which John Bloomberg replied that the answer was probably in a
recent BT article. Unfortunately, this is not so.


Depending upon your accuracy requirements, this can be a tricky problem. For
measurements taken with a hydrometer, you need to correct for the density
change of the wort, which is a function of both its temperature and extract
content, and also for the change in volume of the instrument itself with
temperature. There is a good table of the density of water as a function of
temperature in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, which includes a
polynomial fit. Somewhere in there is a thermal expansion coefficient for
glass as well. To get the extract effect, De clerck's book has a chart
showing the correction (in Plato degrees) as a function of temperature and
degrees Plato. It has a rather limited range of temperature shown, however.


The best strategy for high accuracy is to minimize the correction by
adjusting the sample to near the reference temperature. Professional-quality
instruments have both an internal thermometer with a direct correction
readout, and cover a limited range of density (~10 degrees Plato or ~40
points SG) to minimize the error introduced by adjusting only for
temperature.

MicDark is used because it is readily available in the US and is

A friend gave me some maple sap he had concentrated down to 1.09
(Thanks, Dave!) which I used instead of the corn sugar suggested by
the extract kit I was using.  About a month ago I tried the first
one.  It was so sweet that I'll let it set for a while.  I gave a
bottle to perspective brewer who liked it, but thought it was over-
carbonated.  (He likened it to cola that had gotten warm.)  Neither
of us noticed a cleaner finish and any woody/maple/oak/spice notes
would have been overwhelmed by the sweetness.  BTW my OG=1.043

Subject: Carbonation question and a gizmo.


Hi everyone,
How does carbonation work?  The first time I feed my yeasties,
at fermentation time, they make alcohol (yes, they do a lot
more than that but please don't give me a HBD beating because
I'm being brief).  The next time I give my yeast something to
snack on, at bottling time, they produce carbonation.  How come
more head isn't produced during fermentation, and alcohol isn't
increased during bottling?  I must admit I don't understand
carbonation the way we do it at all.  I'll post any good replies
I get that haven't been posted already.


The gizmo I have is called a "Boil Alert" by Fox Run.  My wife
and I found this years before I started brewing in a housewares
section of a small store.  We can't remember where but maybe
one of you knows where they can be found.  So what is it?
It's a three inch glass disk that sits in your brew pot and
starts flapping around BEFORE your brew comes to a boil.
There is no boil over!  None at all.  This thing is great,
not only does it warn you that boiling is about to start.
It's flapping around stirs the mix and does the same thing
you would do if you stired constantly while the mix heated up.
After the boiling starts I get a wide flat spoon and remove it
to avoid bothering my family (usually I brew in the mornings).
I can't induce my brew to boil over since I started to use
this (yes I tried).  If someone knows where to find these
I'll post that as well.

Al Korzonas comments about mouth siphon sanitation:

>This shouldn't be much of an improvement.


I tend to agree with this, but I do know lots of brewers who suck start siphons
and their beers are not infected.  I may have to do some testing of quart size
brews to see what happens (yea, I mean spit in it).

This I have to take issue with.  How 1/2 oz of 50% EtOH can be lethal without
carotid artery injection is not something I understand.  If you were holding
the alcohol in your mouth you would be breathing thru your nose, you would get
some absorbing thru the walls of your mouth.  But breathing alcohol is not more
toxic a way to absorb it than any non injectable method.  Its used in chronic
alcohol studies in rats.  You maintain a certain level in the air they are
breathing and they stay sauced to a certain degree.

Subject: Experiences with 10BL Brewing Eq./Vendors


I'm looking for information on 10BL brewing systems - the quotes from
vendors are coming in, but since none of us have direct experience with
large commercial systems, it would be helpful to hear from other brewers
who have. Some of the main issues:  reliability, installation/delivery, 
service, ease of use and standard functions/additional features.


This will be a standard brewpub setup and will be serving from holding/
bright tanks. Due to space limitations - ales will be the primary beer
served.

Subject: Cask-conditioned "real ales"


It is my impression after several messages on the subject that "real ale" can
only be found in the UK.  So my question is, how is cask-conditioned ale that
is available here in the States different from "real ale," apart from being
domestic?  My favorite local bar always has two cask-conditioned ales on tap,
served from expensive-looking handpumps no less.  Last night I had several
pints of cask-conditioned Grant's Scottish Ale, which was obviously unfiltered,
not too carbonated, and absolutely delicious!  I have also had cask-conditioned
Red Hook, which is significantly different (in a good way) from regular Red
Hook.  What am I not getting?

Subject: RIMS Usage


I would like to know if anyone out there has had any experiences with the RIMS
(recirculating infusion mashing system).  I fabricated one from Rodney Morris'
instructions (with a few modifications - hey, I'm an electrical engineer. I
couldn't help myself).  I used it for 12-15 batches and after each batch I
rinsed it with fresh water.  The last batch of beer I made using it had a nasty
chemical like taste to it.  I removed the heating element from the unit and
noticed that the element had corroded.  I also notice that since my grain bed
was about 9-10 inches thick (with 8 - 9 lbs of grain) the grind had to be
coarse so that the flow rate through the grains could be maintained. 
Subsequently, my yield was always about 1.045-50 for 8 lbs of grain and
specialty malts.  I would appreciate any feedback on this subject.

You cannot compare printed (on paper) colors with transmitted colors since
the darkness of the transmitted color is dependent on the width of the
sample container.  What you can do is to pour a sample of the test beer and
a couple of reference beers into the SAME containers and then compare them.
Bass is 10 degrees Lovibond and Michalob Dark is 17 lovibond.  Perhaps you
could call some local breweries and ask them what the SRM is of their beers.
Then you can put together your own reference list.  After a few times, you
will be able to estimate the color without the references to within a few
degrees.

I feel that 1 ounce of dextrin malt will add very little.  You could
skip it if you want or add 1oz more of the light crystal if you want to.
I don't know how much malto-dextrin powder would be equivalent (if I had
to guess, I'd say perhaps 1/3 ounce net wt.) but it should be added to the
boil to ease disolving.

I'm sure you didn't mean that you were going to boil your yeast, but the
answer to your main question is that it's the byproducts of the bacteria
or wild yeast that give the beer an off-flavor or off-aroma.  Killing
them will not remove it.  Thus, spoiled extract would still make bad
tasting beer even though you boiled it.  The alcohol may or may not kill
bacteria introduced before or after fermentation.  Gushers usually indicate
that an infection has NOT been killed off by the alcohol.  Vegetive, sour,
nasty or meaty off-flavors/aromas with no gushing usually imply an infection
during the mash or one that has been killed off by the alcohol.

Good point, but also you must remember that in the UK, I'll bet that most of
the beer made in open fermenters is Real Ale and is consumed within 10 to 20
days of fermentation.  Off flavors don't really have a chance to develop.
I've got a tape of a program called "The Brewer's of Helston" which features
the Blue Anchor brewpub in Helston.  I counted no less than 10 instances of
sloppy sanitation.  Ironically, in part of the program the owner says something
like: "When we took over the place, we had some problems with the beer coming
out bad.  We had someone look over our processes and help us clean them up."
Gosh, I'd hate to see what they were doing *before* they fixed their problems!

That would be the Zenne valley of Brussels and the beer is called lambiek
(also lambic or lambik).  Not only do wild yeasts contribute to the production
of these beers but also bacteria (including Pediococcus, Lactobacillus and
Enteric bacteria).


>Hence,
>contamination is a relative thing - some peoples trash is other peoples
>treasure.


Indeed... I'll bet a German brewmaster would burn his/her clothes after a
visit to a lambiek brewery!


Oh, and by the way, I do make purecultureLambieks, and I still don't use
my mouth to start my siphon on those batches.


Okay, to contribute something useful and since I started this whole "don't
use your mouth to start a siphon" thread, I'll post my siphon starting
technique.  Basically it relies on the previous liquid starting the next
liquid through the siphon and using a hose clamp (not my fingers) to keep
the liquid in the hose when changing to a different liquid.


1. fill siphon hose with water
2. use the water to siphon sanitizer into the hose
3. use the sanitizer to siphon rinse water through the hose
4. use the rinse water to siphon the wort/raw_beer through the hose
        (discard the first cup or so)
If bottling:
5. use the raw_beer to siphon the primed beer through the hose
        (discard the first cup or so)

Good point, I have been using CaraVienne in much higher percentages
than my other caramel malts for just this reason.  I use a small bit
of Aromatic or Biscuit, a bit of CaraMunich, but mostly CaraVienne in
my pale ales.  Also been upping the Belgian Munich to around 8% of 
grist (primarily for when I do a high gravity beer and dilute 10%).

Maybe I shouldnt jump in here since I was one who was pointing out that 
in my opinion post fermentation contamination is less of a concern than many 
think, but....


Before high krausen takes hold, dropping pH, upping CO2, etc....*any* 
bacteria is real bad.  Thats why practical brewers are so careful with
prefermentation sanitation.  Many bacteria can multiply 3 times as rapidly
as feremntation yeast, and the results are detectable in parts per billion.
Thats why sucking hoses in prefermentation anything is very bad practice. 
While the comments on yeast overwhelming the bacteria are valid, the 
concern is justified due to the disasterous results that can occur.

I also use open fermentation and pitch copious amounts of fresh yeast slurry.
The issue is not one of fermentation techniques, it is of initial conditions.
I fail to see the relationship between professional brewing equipment and 
siphon sucking, this is one area where we have an exclusive!  And the comment
related to Belgian brewing is not at all applicable to the discussion at
hand. It is also of note that the British cask ales are intended for rapid
consumption and will be more resilient to slow acting bacterium. 


And on the subject of things growing, did anyone see the piece on CNN about
chicken processing plants using a TSP wash to kill the samonela on chicken?
Didnt even look like any rinsing was required.  TSP is great stuff!

I'm not exactly sure what I said (given the cropping job) that set Lance
off.  And I'm not interested in ad hominem exchanges about who, exactly,
has a closed mind.  I'm also not interested in perpetuations of the
notion that effectively spitting into your wort is OK.  I would suggest
that those who are interested do a little checking on the relative
reproduction rates of bacteria and yeast.  I would also suggest that
people be a little more careful about assuming that what works in a
brewery that brews every day will work in a homebrewery (heavy accent on
the home) where beer is brewed, at most, weekly.


I haven't heard of any beer successfully made by adding oral flora, even
lambics.  It's important to bear in mind that not all bacteria are
created equal.

Hello all,


All this talk about sg and temperature has me wondering about something
I've read in a book concerning sparging.  It suggests sparging at around
77 C until the spargings reach a sg value of 1.005.  Now, would this
be before or after correction for temperature?  This information would be
of great value to me since I will soon make the jump to the wonderful world
of all-grain brewing.  Thanks in advance!

Rob Pyle (what a great name!) asks about a mead sitting at 1.065 or so.  I'm
no mead expert but I believe meads typically end up with very low FGs, Rob,
like below 1.  This thing needs more yeast (racking leaves lots of it behind),
and some yeast nutrients to help it out.  Honey has not what yeasties need to
make good.  I'd also raise the temperature to the high 60s to help things
along.  Also, what is "yeast extract"?

John Pratte asks about mounting the control unit from the water heater to his
pot.  You can avoid welding by making a bulkhead fitting, which is basically
a sandwich of two or more fittings, with the wall of the pot and a rubber
washer as the "meat".  Assuming your water heater control unit has a male
pipe thread, the fittings will have to provide a female pipe thread to the
outside.  Bulkhead fittings can be made with a variety of threaded adapters;
every time I make one it comes out a little different.  This is how I've
attached valves, etc. to my kettles and tanks.  Also, drilling a hole greater
than about 3/4" in diameter is difficult to do unless you have a 1/2" drill.
Mine is only 3/8", so I borrowed a chassis punch, which is used by
electricians to punch holes in electrical boxes.  It requires a much smaller
hole to be drilled, so is much easier to do.

Jack Skeels asks about krauesening.  I believe that true krauesening is the
process of adding fully fermenting wort (at high krauesen...) to the beer
just before bottling to add priming food and yeast.  Adding wort to prime is
often called krauesening, but I believe that is a misuse of the term.  The
answer to your question is this:  you can do it the easy way, but it ain't
krauesening.
