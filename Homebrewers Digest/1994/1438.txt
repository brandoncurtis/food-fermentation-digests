Greeting Brewmeisters!


Well, I tapped my first keg!  I ran into a few problems however, and I thought
I'd ask for advice from the collective wisdom of the HBD.  First, let me tell
you that I have a 5 gallon 'Cornie' with ball fittings, and a two gauge
regulator.


  1) When I attached the gas line and started to agitate the beer, I got some
  beer into the gas line.  I don't think I got any beer into the regulator,
  and after two days, I've noticed no problems with the gauges.  Is there a
  way to tell if I've got beer in the regulator?  Also, what happens to the
  regulator, if I did?


  2) Sterilizing and cleaning was kind of a pain!  I did what I could, but I
  read in the Miller book that you should remove the ball fittings.  How do
  you get them off?  I started to get an open ended wrench but it was on so
  tight, I was afraid of breaking the fitting.  Any ideas?  Also, any clever
  ideas on how to clean picnic tappers (and unfortunately, gas lines)? I had a
  booger of a time getting water to flow through the hose!


  3) Memorial day was a success.  I carbonated at 2.6 volumes (by agitating,
  and resting for a day) and then resetting the regulator, bleeding CO2, and
  setting to 5 PSI to dispense.  It was a little under carbonated, and a bit
  foamy, but almost everyone liked the beer (my Austrailian lager didn't pass
  the 'Girlfriend test', Oh well).  Next time, I'll try to continue agitation
  until I can no longer hear gas flowing through the regulator.  Does this
  sound like the correct procedure?

Subject: Digest Browser Program


A recent post mentioned something called Digest Browser as an alternative
to scrolling through the digest.  I was curious so I checked it out.


This works program works great if you run an off-line reader like Eudora
for Macintosh (a great mail program once you get it working).  I downloaded
Digest-Browser-16.hqx from ftp wuarchive.wustl.edu;
cd/systems/mac/info-mac/app.  I store my HBdigest in its own mailbox on
Eudora; close Eudora, open the Digest BRowser and open the Eudora Folder to
the digest mailbox.  The digest browser gives me a double window--the table
of contents on the top and the messages below.  Highlight the item in the
contents and the appropriate message shows up in the bottom window. It's a
great way to skip by items that you are not interested in reading.  Works
for any digest that has a contents list at the beginning.


Brefully yours, Mark Evans

allen,
my wife's beer tastes run from the medium body and nut-brown
type stuff to the lower end of the spectrum (she used to like
Carta Blanca, but can't find it). She also likes Weiss beers as well;
except for the Carta Blanca, my tastes, fortunately, are similar. 
Neither of us are real hop-heads --have tried them,  but just
can't take the bitter stuff-- so we do drink a lot of the same things.
She, among lots of our friends, particularly like the Gingered Ale
recipe I had posted all-grain questions regarding earlier ---i offer
this as a indication of her favorite.

In my earlier posting I forgot some descriptions:

* By the time I had a nearly full brew kettle, the runoff was
almost colorless (but not quite), and still a little sweet.


* The wort has/had a lovely copper brown color. Yummy.


So, when is a good time to stop the runoff? Did I leave some
stuff in the Gott that should have ended up in the brewkettle?

                      mash numbers


Hi all...


Well, this past holiday weekend I got a chance to do my 3rd mash,
this time using my new 5gal Gott and my 160K btu cooker. I did
the following:


* combine 10lbs 2row, 1lb crystal, 1 lb carapils in the Cooler with
 3 gal of 130 deg water. Stir. Temperature approx 122 deg. Wait 30min.


* performed iodine test just to see what it would look like. Yup, got
some black stains in the sample water.


* add 6 qts of 200 deg water, stir. wait 30 minutes. During this time
the temperature varied between 148 near the top and 156 closer to
the middle (couldn't reach the bottom). After stirring the temp was
about 154 or so.


* Heat 6 gal sparge water to 170 deg. The mash was done before
this came up to temp, so the mash sat an additional 25 minutes
inside the closed Gott cooler.


* Begin sparge into the brew kettle. Using hose clamps, I allowed
the Gott to drain directly into the kettle and semi-clamped the sparge
water hose to try and keep water near the top of the grain bed (it
dropped a little bit off and on).


* Do the boil & hop schedule thing. Here's the recipe:


10 lbs 2 row
1 lb crystal
1 lb carapils
5.1% Cascades (about a tablespoon of pellets), 60 min
1 tablespoon grated/sliced ginger root, 60 min
5.1% Cascaded (another tablespoon of pellets), 10 min


The whole thing (full volume boil) took about 23 min to cool
with my 1/4" immersion chiller and about 5 gal of water.


My starting gravity was about 1.045 or 1.047 (can't remember
here at work). Is this good? My other 2 mash attempts had
rather poor extraction, but I had trouble with equipment
during those attempts. Now that i've got a nice homemade copper
manifold inside the Gott and something for a full volume boil
I anticipate smoother running and better results.


I've made a similar recipe before, using extracts:


4 lb pale LME
2.5 lb light LME
1/2 lb carapils
1/2 lb 60L crystal


This had a SG of about 1.048 (give or take 0.001, again, my notes
are at home). The friend at the homebrew shop said the all-grain bill
(up above) should do the trick and give me a gravity about 1.050.


Did I do something wrong? How can one determine/predict the
starting gravity? How does one calculate the number of points
extracted? I'd really hate to find that my all-grain attempts
are for naught...


thanks in advance

Subject: Scottish Brown


I recently purchased Byron Burch's *Brewing Quality Beers* book. In it,
he gives a recipe for a Scottish Brown. Being a fan of brown ales and of
Scottish descent, I am interested in making this beer.


Two questions:


1) Byron calls for 4oz of dextrine powder. Could I use dextrine
(cara-pils) malt instead? And, if so, how much?


2) What is the difference 'tween brown ale and Scottish brown? The
Scottish brown seems to have more hops, but are there other differences?


Thanks

Subject: Pickle buckets as lauter tun


I suspect this is a common problem, but I haven't seen any data/info
on it so I'm going to ask anyway.  If the info/answers to my questions
is/are well documented, then feel free to flame the crap out of me
(privately, please), but be sure to direct me toward the appropriate
info sources while you are doing it.  Here's my question:


I just acquired some of those white food grade plastic buckets from a
restaurant so I could fashion a lauter tun (I'm about to take that
famous all grain plunge).  Of course, all three buckets that they gave
me formerly contained pickels since I didn't specify (under the
"beggars can't be choosers" axiom).  I don't feel like trying again at
a different restaurant unless I determine that these buckets are
worthless.  


So, does anyone know of an effective deodorizing technique for this
situation?  Has anyone used (former) pickle buckets as a lauter tun?
Were there any negative effects on your beer?  Any data at all on this
one? 


Thanks.  Private email fine.

Well, everytime I read Dave's book I pick up something else I haven't been

but it isn't spring water and is not hard or soft. 


But, I thought maybe there is something to this sparge acidification and I

I'd look into it.  But I can't seem to find Lactic Acid 88% solution anywhere.  
Where would one go to find it?  Also if this is more difficult to obtain, how 
about the Phosphoric acid Dave recomments?  


Anybody know where to get these?  My drug store doesn't seem to know or
care.  Also, anyone out there with experience with and without acidifying
sparge?
Incidentally, my worts are just about as recommended in Dave Miller's book.

In HOMEBREW Digest #1437, Stan White asked:


> To all: yup, the recent discussion around all grain have made me look at
> "making the move".  BUT....  a bit o' terminology I just can't figure out.

Ah, so it's a question of mashing types, is it?  Well, in a nutshell:


INFUSION:  Add grain to hot water, mix, and wait while temperature
slowly drops.  This is the principal method used in the UK, and malts
there are made for it, very fully modified and with a low percentage
of nitrogen.  The very common "picnic cooler" mashtun is made with 
this method in mind, and it's probably the most commonly used homebrew
mashing method, despite the fact that the higher nitrogen content of
North American pale malts not infrequently leads to chill haze.


STEP-INFUSION:  To improve clarity and yeild, and gain control over
the makeup of the final wort, there are advantages to stepping the
mash through a temperature program. The usual steps are a mash-in,
then a protein rest (where proteins are degraded into smaller components,
some of which are important yeast nutrients), one or more starch conversion
rests (if desired, separate temperatures can be used to favor beta- and
alpha-amylase), and a mash-out.  Can be done in a picnic-cooler tun by
additions of boiling water (tricky!), but is more commonly done with
a direct-fired vessel of some sort, the mash then being transferred
into a separate lauter tun.


DECOCTION:  This is a very special way of creating the steps outlined
above.  A fraction (usually the "thickest," meaning mostly grain)
is removed from the "rest mash," raised to a temperature favoring
enzymatic action (usually ~160F) and held for a while, then boiled,
the boiling mash being then returned to the rest mash, where it 
raises the temperature to the next step.  The usual result is increased
malt aroma and flavor, improved clarity, increased yeild, and slightly
darker color.  Adds much time and work to the brewday, but seems to
be the best way to handle Continental malts.  Can be done in just
about any setup that doesn't make removing and returning the decoction
too difficult.


AMERICAN MIXED MASH:  What the Big Boys do.  Mix the corn or rice you
plan to use with a portion of the malt, step it through a mash program,
then bring it to a boil.  While the cereal's cooking, start the main 
malt mash.  Dumping in the cooked cereal will bring the mash to conversion
temperature.


These are just the most common methods;  there are others.  I would think
that anyone reading this who's been thinking of trying a mash would 
have to conclude that if such different ways of approaching it are
all successful, the process must be very forgiving.  It is!  Give
it a try!

Not at all, Jack.  I don't even know you and I don't believe personal 
attacks are appropriate on this forum.  What "turns my crank" is your 
making blanket statements concerning brewing processes and/or equipment 
that are contrary to my own experience.  As an example, I cite the 
following:

Fact is, I have been using a mash tun (converted keg) with a false bottom 
for precisely this purpose.  I simply recirculate while adding heat with 
a propane burner.  I am able to pump the foundation liquor up to the top of 
the grain bed before it has a chance to boil and form steam (or scorch).  
This is why I am interested in the concept of stirred mashes.  I would 
like to even out the temperature of my mash more effectively.


If you're ever in San Antonio, I would be glad to show you my setup and 
demonstrate to you exactly how its smooth operation refutes your "well 
thought out" comments.  While you're here, bring a Maltmill and we'll 
compare it with my Glatt.  


I would reiterate--I have no product to promote.  My only concern is 
accuracy in the brewing information disseminated in this digest.

          About that spruce beer,


          Is it imaginable that different species of spruce are
          specific in the flavors they add to a beer? Or the stength
          of those flavors? I noticed a post from someone who used
          Blue spruce tips. Blue spruce is noted for it's sour
          tasting needles. From the high country of the west,
          Englemann spruce might provide a more subtle character than
          Blue spruce. Where I am, Sitka spruce is showing it's new
          growth and tempting me to brew with the tips. How about
          Black spruce of Alaska, or Red spruce of the Eastern
          states?


          Any ideas on what the best tasting spruce might be?

It doesn't sound that high of a final when you say you used "lots" of
crystal.  How much is lots? :-)  The more crystal, the less fermentables
in your wort.  So a 1.030 gravity might be around the ballpark.

I don't have any numbers, but my experience with this yeast tells me
it is very attenutive.  A while back, I posted some info on a batch that
I did, and got a quite impressive FG.  I believe it was 1.070 down to 1.014.
I just did two batches with the dregs from the previous batch, one a barley
wine and the other a smaller ale (that I am going to add fruit to later)
Anyway, the BWine SG was 1.104 and the smaller ale was 1.060.  The BWine
as of one week in the primary, was down to 1.030.  The smaller ale was
down to 1.009!!!  The key to good fermentation is to aerate the wort as
much as possible before pitching the yeast.  This is especially true in
high gravity worts, such as yours.

Subject: Mashout Necessary? revisited


At the risk of causing trouble...


Way back in HBD #1242, Domenick Venezia asked whether mash-out was
really necessary.  There were several responses that seemed to be
saying, "Well, not really but don't try to skip it on a wheat beer or an
oatmeal stout!"  I think I will start making it a regular part of my
procedure based on only a few data points:


I have been brewing all-grain batches since last fall and had never
done a mashout.  I was getting reasonable extraction rates (~30
pt/#/gal) so I was happy.  A couple of weekends ago, I decided to try an
overnight mash.  The extraction rate was only 25 pt/#/gal.  I theorized
that the problem was that the mash was a lot cooler than on other
batches so the sugars were not as soluble.  Last weekend I made another
batch (not overnight mash though) and added the mashout step - the
extraction was 32 pt/#/gal.


Now I am not against adding a little malt for the sake of convenience
but I would like a little more consistency so that when I shoot for a
target O.G. of 1.040, I get between 1.038 and 1.042 and not 1.032!


So...
Is my hypothesis at all sound?  I will continue to mash out in the
future - if I get any really low extraction rates, I will post the
results.




BTW, Domenick's original concern for doing a mashout was the added
transfer and equipment that would be needed to heat up the mash.  I just
added 5 qts. of boiling water and it brought it right up to 170^F.  I
calculated that 5 qts were needed using the great thermo equations from
Kelly Jones that I had forgotten long ago (see HBD #1207).  Thanks Kelly!

There is a possibility that the tanks contained poisonous gases, but it 
should be possible to determine what type of gas (toxic, flammable, 
corrosive, etc.) the cylinder contained by looking at the connector.  Go 
to a home brew store or a fellow brewer with a CO2 tank/regulator and 
look at the threads that connect the tank to the regulator.  For CO2, the 
connector is a CGA 320.  Compare these threads to the used tanks at the 
junk store.  (Better yet, borrow a regulator and see if it fits.)


There is a second item to be concerned about.  In order to get the tank
filled from a dealer (if it is a CO2 tank), the tank must be certified. 
Look for a number stamped in the body of the tank near the valve that
looks like a date: eg. 4-88+*.  This is when the tank was last pressure
tested and its rating.  All tanks must be periodicly re-tested.  I think
the period is ten years.  I am not sure who pays for the testing, it is
probably the owner of the tank.  If the tank fails, it is returned with
holes drilled thru it and you lose the cost of the tank as well as the
cost of the testing.

I bottled my latest ale last Saturday evening. After capping, I proceeded to
carry 24 bottles in a standard cardboard beer crate to my storage area. Halfway
there, I noticed the bottles in the center of the crate were about an inch lower
than the bottles around the edge. I had time to utter one short %#`at` before the
bottom fell out. (No, the box wasn't wet -- just old.) 


All 24 crashed to the floor. Five exploded sending glass everywhere. After the
noise subsided, I realized my left knee was badly gashed. The wound was to the
bone and required 16 stitches to close. This could, however, have been much
worse. I could have been more seriously injured, or worse yet, my daughter or
wife could have been struck.


It took this sobering experience to change my bottling procedure. Plastic milk
crates will now be used. Please don't wait for something like this to happen to
you.

With regard to the siphoning methodology I thought I'd elaborate on 
Al's method.  Needless to say I'm not a fan of mouth siphoning, I 
don't like the taste of bleach or boiling water!

I use a procedure similar to Al except I fill the siphon hose with tap 
water by forcing water into hose end from the faucet.  I put the 
racking cane in 1 gallon jar of sanitizer next to the sink.  As water 
is forced into hose,  bubbles (air) are blown into sanitizer, at this 
time I release hose from faucet and place it in the bottom of  the 
sink.  This will start the siphon.  Drain enough liquid through to get 
sanitizer into all parts of the hose then clamp to soak or transfer to 
rinse water (I use boiling water).  I also soak the hose end by 
dipping it into the sanitizer.  You don't need surgical gloves to 
transfer, just touch parts of the hose and cane that doesn't go into 
the wort, ie., elbow of cane or area above clamp.  The secret to 
maintaining a siphon is to keep both the cane and hose full of liquid. 
 If for any reason you touch something that hasn't been sanitized 
(some of us don't have the best depth perception or aim with two feet 
of dangling hose), you can clamp and stop the flow, and dip into rinse 
water again.  I keep a pitcher of rinse water in a pitcher nearby 
exaclty for this purpose.  If for some reason I lose my siphon and 
have to resort to sucking on the end of a hose, you can rinse with 
rinse water before placing it into the transfer vessel.


This method takes a little practice to master but is definitely safer. 
 I use a similar siphoning procedure to transfer radioactive liquid 
into a disposal container in the lab.  It's definitely easier and 
safer than pouring!  I would'nt even think of puting anything in the 
lab in my mouth, especially radioactive liquids!!!




On another note there was a recent post regarding a gizmo called a 
"Boil Alert."

I would also like to attest to the use of this glass disk (also called 
a pot watcher) to homebrewing.  I started using these when I started 
brewing on the stovetop and have yet to have a boilover.  It works on 
much the same principle as boiling stones.  It serves as a site of 
nucleation for bubble formation so that you don't get a 'bump' or 
burst of bubbles released all at once.  I like mine so much I 
convinced Jeff to add them to the Brewers Resource catalog (the new 
catalog should be out any day now).  He has the pot wathchers in stock 
if you're interested in trying one (800-8-Brewte(k)).  You can also 
find these in gourmet cooking supply shops and the like.  They cost 
about $3.

Subject: Party Pig


I've been lurking on this list for a month or so now, thought I'd ask a
question.


My girlfriend purchased a "Party Pig" keg-like system for me a couple of months
ago (probably to get me to stop bitching about bottling so much).  Anyway, the
Party Pig is a food-grade plastic container that holds roughly 2.25 gallons of
beer.  There's this valve assembly that fits on top of it, and these "pressure
packs" that go inside.  The idea is, you fill the pig with beer (up to a line
marked on the side of the container), put in the pressure pack, force air into
the pig (with a hand pump they provide), watch the pressure pack expand, wait a
week or two, and then start drinking draft beer.  The pressure pack maintains
constant pressure inside the pig so the beer doesn't go flat and flows out
easily.  The directions say to prime as you normally do.  Sounds like a good
idea to me, so I put half a batch of (excellent, IMHO) pale ale into the pig.


A couple of weeks later, I decided to try the beer.  I put a mug underneath the
spout, pressed the release nozzle, and got a bunch of foam.  No problem, I
thought, I probably just have to bleed a little pressure and then it's pure
drinking pleasure.  So, I put a pitcher underneath the tap, pressed the button,
and filled the pressure with foam.  And another.  And another.  The end result
was that I was never able to get anything approaching beer, I essentially had
2.25 gallons of foam (wasting a great pale ale).


I used roughly one cup of light malt extract for priming, this is what I
normally use.  Does anyone else have experience with the Party Pig, and if so
has it been a good experience?  How much do you prime your beer?  Or is this
thing just a lemon?  I have one more pressure sack for the pig left (it came
with two), I'm willing to try it again, but first I want to understand what I
did wrong.

Some of you may be familiar with an article I wrote for Brewing Techniques on

Friend, colleague, and fellow HBD'er Jeff Berton has converted some Excel

these were included in the article in graphical form, but the worksheet as

this one.  After entering the proportions of fermentables and their potential
extract figures, vary the assumed extract efficiency until the actual weights
come out right.  Remember that when doing this you must adjust the volumes
such that the net run-off `at` 60 degrees F matches the actual result to get a

Question--
while thinking about whether to and what kind of gas grill to get, I thought
to myself, "I wonder if these would make useful brewing heat sources?"
Anyone tried it? They have the smaller table top ones, which I figure are
basically coleman stoves with lava rock.
So, is there enough heat? I'm talking about maybe a 10 gallon boil at most,
but likely only a 5 gallon (but full!) boil. 


Or should I just brew from the heat given off by one of Schmidling's posts?

by the "force and shake" method destroys much of the beer's head retention 
capability.  The author suggested that the head retention characteristics 
were actually broken up during the mechanical agitation of the carbonation 
process.  My kegged beers do not have the greatest head retention, while my 
bottled versions do (a single data point).  Anyone out there dispute or 
agree with this statement???  I plan to carbonate my next beer with my old 
method (attach the CO2 at 10-15 PSI for two weeks) as an experiment.

        Ok, next question!


        I've racked to the secondary, and it's clearing nicely, and the
        SG seems almost stabilized; at 1.027. Which seems very high to
        me, with an OG of 1.048.


        What might be up? Stall? Just a very *slow* ferment? Did I 
        rack too early? (The foam had fallen back into the beer).


        Or could this be the actual FG of the beer?
