Subject: I need a favorite recipe


I am looking for a summer brew to make, something with a good flavor (I'm a
fan of Fuller's ESB and brews of that ilk) but with a low octane for our
steamy summer months here in the Deep South. To put it simply, I'd like an
alternative to iced tea, but I don't want to find myself in the hammock
when I should be rebuilding the pleasure grounds.


I'm not a lager fan (too many bad commercial gassy beers, I expect), but if
someone can offer an extraordinary recipe, try me.


Any suggestions?

Subject:  Mashout-


In Dominick Venezias post on Mashout he mentioned a three step sparge
process that I use.  A few years back I visited a couple of small
breweries and several of the highland Scotch distilleries.  In each they
produced their beer (distillers just forget the hops), in a large lauter tun
which had folding arms to stir the mash and a couple of very large water
heaters on an upper level (all looked very similar so I assumed were
produced by the same outfit).  Following the mash schedule they would
run in 170F water for the first sparge run, then pump this off through a
chiller to the fermentation tanks,   the second sparge was at a slightly
higher temperature of 180F, and the gravity was dropping rapidly (like
about 1.010 as I remember), then they did a very rapid final sparge at
about 190 to get every last bit of sugar out of the mash.  This was about
1.005 or so and was retained by pumping up to the holding tank, and
while the next batch was mashed the water in the bulk tank cooled to
about 170F where the process started again.
I adopted the same three step system for my homebrewing setup,  and I
mash out by adding a small amount of simmering water to the mash to
raise the temperature to 170F or so, then blend more of the simmering
water with cold to make a 180F batch, which I sparge through, followed
by another shot of the simmering water.  
I use a very short mash schedule (50-60 min.), and recirculate the first
gallon or so of mash water, until the mash sets and the wort runs clear. 
Then I let the water level reach the grain bed, and begin adding the 180F
water at that point.   When the flow reduces and the bed begins to settle
I add the 190F water and often I find that the gravity of the run off will
take a jump.  Tannins and silicates so far haven't been a problem with
this technique, and I get excellent extraction rates.
I am not sure if it is a Scottish thing to get every last gram of sugar from
the mash,  I was told that it aided in extracting all of the sugars from the
mash and increasing the final gravity without over dillution of the wort.
The owner and distiller at Glengoyne used this method and spent a long
time covering his methods with me,  he convinced me, and I have stuck
with it.  The microbrewery I visited was run by a couple of former
distillery employees who may simply have used the same equipment and
techniques by habit.  But who is to argue with good booze and beer.
As a final note,  on that same trip at a brewery somewhere in the UK one
bit of advice I remembered was that the pH and mash temps were critical
to maintaining the malt character and mouth feel of the finished beer. 
Seems that they used higher temps (like about 155-158F) for short
periods of time, at a pH of about 5.8.  This they explained was to
enhance the activity of the enzymes good at eating smaller sugars while
leaving the longer chain sugars for your beer.

Subject: More on the Party Pig


Well, I'm certainly impressed by what the HBD can do, my mailbox has been
overflowing with suggestions on how to get good results with the pig, not to
mention several posts in the last digest.


The overwhelming advice I've gotten is to prime less than you normally do for
bottles.  The directions that came with my pig were somewhat ambivelant on
this, they said to prime normally, and then said to use 1/3 cup sugar.  They
did not specify if that was 1/3 cup for the whole batch (5 gallons) or just for
the pig beer.  Of course, I use dry malt extract rather than sugar for priming,
they made no mention of priming ratios for that.


I've got a pale ale that I just racked to the secondary, I'm planning on using
the pig for half of it when it's ready.  I will use 1/4 cup of extract to prime
the pig, I'll prime the beer for bottles as I normally do.  I'll let people
know how it turns out.


Thanks to everyone who responded to my first post, I know where to go next time
I've got a question.

Subject: RE: dunkelweizen all-grain recipe




    Hi All,


Spencer Thomas asks about all grain dunkelweizen recipes.


>1. Does anyone have a great all-grain dunkelweizen recipe?  (That you
>   will share !accurately! with me?)


Well, this one took a first in a competition last year:


5# DWC Pilsner
5# DWC Wheat
1 cup chocolate malt


Two of the three judges scored the beer in the low 40s, all three commented
that it was too dark, and had a dark roasted malt character that was a little
too pronounced. I agreed with their comments. The malt character in a
dunkelweizen should be soft and subtle, not sharp and distinctive. Also,
"dunkel" in this case is a relative term, this style should be somewhat darker
than a pale hefe-weizen, but not as dark as a porter or stout.  For both
those reasons, I'm going to reduce the chocolate to 1/3 to 1/2 cup, and leave
it at that.


>My tentative recipe is looking something like this:
>* 30-70 Pilsener (DW-C) - Wheat (DW-C or Ireks)


Forget the Ireks. I've tried it, as well as domestic wheat malts.  IMHO, the
DWC wheat is a superior choice. Plumper, with a higher yield and ~30% lower
protein content, the DWC wheat was easier to mash and lauter and produced a
clearer, cleaner finished product than any other type I have tried.


>* Some amount (5%?) of dark crystal (Ireks 90L) to darken and add body


Addition of high lovibond crystal will also contribute rounded, caramel-like
tones, and likely some residual sweetness as well. Dunkelweizen, like the
pale version, should be light, crisp, and tart. 


>* Double decoction mash.
>* 12 IBUs of hops, 60 min.


Yep. Your target of 12 IBUs is about right, you want to avoid excessive
bitterness. The combination of high hop bitterness and clove character is
quite unpleasant, it will detract from the drinkability. Use a noble type
hop such as Tettnang or Hallertau, do a single addition, and boil for 60
minutes. Avoid late additions for flavor or aroma.


One other thing, most of the flavor of this style should come from the
yeast. Use an authentic weizen yeast, I use the Weihenstephan(sp?) #68.
I believe Wyeast now distributes this as #3068.


Hope this helps,
       Jim

This reminded me of a similar albeit much less tragic experience that happened
to me.


I was getting something out of my beer fridge when I accidentally knocked a
bottle of beer out of it.  The bottle fell to the floor and exploded.  I immed-
iately felt something spraying and, looking down, saw three bloody gashes on my
leg.  My first thought was that I had a severed artery.  I composed myself
enough to look down again, and then around.  That's when I noticed that the
flying glass had also punctured a hole in a can of pub draught Guinness that
had been next to the fridge.  It was Guinness that was spraying on my leg, not
my blood spraying out of it.  Phew!


In no way am I making light of Richard's accident or of the danger of working
with bottles and carboys.  But the above incident did have me chuckling,
especially after I determined that the three gashes were superficial.


Be careful out there.  And don't lose your sense of humor.

After reading the thread regarding siphoning, I thought I would add my .02
worth. The easiest thing I have found is to sanitize the siphon apparatus
and while rinsing, leave the hose filled with water. Cap the end with your fing
er ( I wear rubber gloves while I do this ) insert hose into beer, let it flow
draining the water and first bit of beer.  Second best is to buy an item I have
seen called a ' Battery Filler ', it is a rubber squeeze bulbwith a nozzle
attached, similar to a baster, but with considerably more suction power. I
found mine in the auto section of my local dept store. This one even works on
my 4.5' length of 3/8 siphon tube, which is difficult to start a siphon with
when you are using a 36" cane. Being plastic, it is easily sanitizable.


Another item I have seen recently, and considerable discussion on is the
party pig. Good idea with some rough edges. Biggest one seems to be the
pouring difficulties. I have not looked at one to see if you could do this, but
 the theory goes as such. Your beer line has a certain loss of pressure per
foot, which is part of the reason that a pig will not perform the same as a tap
 system. The pressure at the end of the hose is not nearly as high as the CO2
pressure in the tank. If you tried to pour your beer with 8 psi at the outlet
of your spigot, you would have much the same result as the pig. The same theory
applies to your 'beer king' kegs and tappers ( which I have had one of for
many years, even before I started brewing ).  So the answer is to add a 4' or
so length of beer line to the device. How? Dont know offhand, but I am sure
someone out there can offer suggestions.

I'm planning on brewing a wheat beer soon and have a question for the
collective wisdom regarding the correct water composition.  My home tap
water is very hard - it has more than a passing resemblance to Burton-on-
Trent water (well I only live a few miles away).  The question is, is this
OK for brewing wheat beer, or do I need to do any treatments?  As a last
resort I have access to distilled water and the necessary chemicals at work.
I recently posted this to r.c.b. and didn't get any takers - please help!

I would like a copy of your file, Jeff.  The RIMS schematics I have seen,
and the resultant fabrication of motor/heater hardware, seem like a LOT 
more work than the few hours I put in on the motor and paddle for the
stirrer.  Also, I've read articles/reviews (the one by George Fix comes
immediately to mind) where he said that Rodney's version did not translate
well to batch sizes larger than 5 gallons.  It seems that the tun 
geometry is dependent on batch size (I think the system from SABCO 
eliminates this, does anyone out there use one?).  However, I also know
that many people have put a lot of effort into making their RIMS systems
work, and I imagine there are many fine designs available now (compared to
the original).  Thanks for the input, and I look forward to receiving 
your file.


>And a RIMS is a tinkerer's dream.  


Well, I don't have much spare time yet as I am a full-time father to my
10 month old, but after finishing the paddle assembly, I find myself getting
the itch to build something else ;-)  It's a hell of a disease, isn't it?

Thanks, Glen.  I am well aware of the drywallers type of stirrer as my 
father was a plastering/drywall contractor for 35 years.  Actually, it's 
what killed him (he died from mesothelioma, caused from the exposure to
asbestos).  He also had a few paddles fabricated LONG before they were on
the market; these were made of stainless and they are sitting in my garage.
I used them on jobs numerous times.  Most of them are designed to spin at 
a higher rpm than my motor/pulley arrangement spins at.  However, I think 
if you just want to stir the mash intermittently, they would work fine 
attached to a drill.  Maybe I just have a mental block about them because of 
the negative association I have.  BTW, he had all of them made to fit 
different size buckets.  I have fond memories of mixing plaster in 5 gallon 
pails and having it fly all over until I figured out the trigger technique!

According to the info in Zymurgy, if your beer has made it past the first
round, you will be notified between May 30th and June 6th.  At that point,
you should send three (3) more bottles to Denver between June 13th and
17th.  I'm not sure if all of the first round score sheets will be 
returned during this time, or just the ones that made it past the first
round.  As usual, the writing/editing in Zymurgy (Gad, some of the sentences 
need a LOT of help in this magazine) leaves some empty space for the 
reader to interpret.

I have found it next to impossible to dump my tubing into the sink or

else is soaking.  So, I go to the next best thing, IMHO, and siphon all 
the sanitizer out of the primary, which takes ten minutes or so and

        As a previous spruce basher, I'll mention that I used "Black 
     Hills Spruce" (bought as a live Xmas tree & then planted several 
     years back) in the boil. I'm right now re-trying a small half 
     batch, using a different Xmas tree, a Blue Spruce, and using the 
     spruce tips as a "dry hop" in the fermenter and not in the boil 
     at all. (I luuuuuuuuv the smell, pant, pant, and will keep trying 
     til I get the taste!)
        I had four responses to my "rapid ferment" query--all saying 
     that Wyeast 1098 is a true speed demon and a 48-hour ferment was 
     maybe even "common." Guess I'll go back for another try. (Now if 
     I could just cut my mashing time in half!)
        On buggy hop bines, I planted garlic cloves around my bines 
     (an old Organic Gardening trick). It supposedly repels (not 
     eliminates) the bugs. Another organic trick is to spray with 
     soapy water; then rinse. Not sure how effective these are on 
     various bug types. I've seen no critters so far, and the goddam 
     rabbits which eat everything else I plant don't seem to be hop 
     heads.
        To Jack Schmidling: Like many on HBD, I'm a kettle masher, 
     thanks to your write up. One item, you tell us to sparge with 
     boiling water (you say something like, "trust me on this one.") I 
     have (and I do), but I'd like to know why. Speak? Speak?
        Now for the me-stupid question. When I planted my hop 
     rhizomes, I wrote the variety name--Cascade, Nugget, Perle, and 
     Willamette--on plastic tags with waterproof ink. Except the ink 
     didn't turn out to be waterproof, and my beer-soaked brain 
     couldn't remember which I planted where. Any good way to tell 
     them apart by looks, now that they're half way up my house? They 
     all smell pretty similar to me.
        Cheers all...

If I was brewing a batch of beer and was not going to do a full batch boil,
what would be the optimum amount of water to brew with.


Like if I'm making a 5 gallon batch, would I boil 1 or 2 or 3 gallons?


Then of course the remainder would be cold water in the carboy.

This episode reminds me of my only near-disaster with glass, and this
is a good opportunity to offer some more safety suggestions.
When capping bottles, you are putting appreciable stresses on the
glass.  A bottle with some non-obvious weakness can explode during
the capping process.  This happened to me ONE time but I have taken
precautions ever since.  When the  bottle failed, shards of glass went
flying every-which-way.  I had a very minor cut on my left hand which
was steadying the bottle in the bench capper.  Whenever I bottle now,
I wear a glove on my left hand and I wear safety glasses.

Subject: Pig Foaming, Mailing Beer


 
RE: Pig foam...
 
I use the 5 liter minikegs, and one of the most important rules is to
CUT your normal priming sugar/malt/whatever in HALF. I kegged one
part of a batch of dopple, and I primed that part (almost a gallon
and a half) with one tablespoon of corn sugar. The head is fine,
although I must note that the minikeg uses a CO2 cart to force out the
brew (not for priming).
 
RE: Mailing Beer...
 
Some of us on the Zymurgy RoundTable on GEnie periodically swap
homebrew, and we always just ship UPS. You cannot ship beer via US
Postal Service. Just wrap your individual bottles in newspaper or
bubble wrap, then pack them in a box that allows at least one inch of
space around each bottle (including in between them). Fill the space
with crushed newspaper or peanuts (peanuts allow shifting, so this
makes the individual wrapping very important). Use good packing tape.
 
Some UPS clerks think that you're not supposed to ship either glass
or beer via UPS, so it's best just to label the package "brewing
supplies" or "yeast samples" or something, although I did ship some
to Canada last winter, and since I had to be honest for Customs, I
put "Brewing Samples for Judging." No problem.
 
I've never had a broken bottle.

Subject: Malting oats/mildew


Previously I have malted barley and wheat (3-5 lbs at a time) and have just
finished malting 5 lbs of oats, the first batch I've tried. I can't keep the
temperature below about 70^F so there is always a danger of mildew. In the case
of barley, I have obtained a satisfactory degree of development in about 3 days
at which point I dry, smoke, or roast the grain depending on what sort of malt I
wish to make. However, the oats took longer to sprout and developed more slowly.
In 5 days I only had a germination rate of about 66%, but I also noticed a
distinct musty smell. I decided not to risk ruining the whole batch so dried it
in my oven at 125-130^F over night. The musty smell is almost entirely gone now,
but I am not certain whether the mildew is actually killed or is still lurking
in there to come out and ruin my prospective oatmeal stout. Does anyone have
experience malting oats, or know what temperature is needed to definitively kill
mildew?

It took someone posting from a biotech firm to put things in a proper
context and jog my memory.  One of the things they teach you in
undergraduate biolabs is that the thin surface of bubbles is a hostile
environment for proteins, nucleic acids, and other long polymers.  In the
thin film of the bubble such molecules are stretched and may become
denatured or sheared. ( I guess that Reed education was good for something
).  Cells in suspension can suffer the same fate.


Jusk keep bubbles out of your blood and brain and you should be Ok.


I haven't seen inside a keg of beer undergoing rapid force carbonation but
a quick shake of one of my bottles of homebrew shows that a foam forms. 
Given enough enthusiasm, I imagine a significant fraction of the heading
peptides could be damaged.

Subject:      Bottles for homebrew




  We recently were bottling our latest batch (10 gal of Obscure IPA) of
homebrew, and discovered to our dismay that our capper would not cap
Caledonian Brewing Co.'s bottles, since they have a recessed ring around
the neck and the capper can't get a grip.  This got us to wondering
about whose bottles are good for homebrew bottling (New Amsterdams
worked just fine, and a lot of our IPA ended up in those) and whose
bottles don't work as well.  I don't know if this is FAQ-bait, or
just a topic of potential interest, but I'd be interested in other
people's experiences and responses.  If you prefer to mail responses
to me, I'll summarize them and post it.


  I don't think this information will seriously affect my commercial
beer drinking habits (yes, I must admit that I still do drink some
non-homebrews), but it may change what bottles I keep and which ones
I recycle.  BTW, we're keeping the Caledonian bottles with an eye to
eventually getting a bench capper.

THis is a tough one.  The dark malts that would be a natural choice are
not available here, and I doubt many homebrewers have dark malt coloring
that most Germans use.  You want to limit the caramel sweetness, and limit
the chocolate taste but get the color contributions.  The beer need not 
be real dark, so I would use under 5% dark crystal and maybe 1% chocolate.
If its domestic chocolate, I would leave it out all together.  I hate the
use of Black Patent in any beer, so Im not about to suggest this.  If
you can get a dark Munich malt, this may be a good bet, or maybe do some
experiments with Belgian malts, but the maltiness may be too much.


Good luck,

You could slice off the rings around the outside of the bucket that
prevent it from sliding down inside the outer bucket.  Mine has
foundation space 3 or 4 cm deep (about a gallon).  It's comparable
to the foundation left by the adjustable vegetable steamer basket I
