>From *Jeff* Renner 
 
Domenick Venezia asks for the source of the article Mark Simpson quoted 
claiming that head forming proteins were damaged by the "force and shake" 
method of carbonation.  It was in the article "Gas Gossip: Nitrogen vs. 
Carbon Dioxide in Brewing" in the new (Summer, 1994) *Zymurgy*, 7:2, p.55., 
by Cliff Tanner, who, according the bio at the end of the article, is "a 
brewer and member of the Northern AleStars Homebrewers Guild for 12 years, 
(and) is owner of Braukunst Homebrewers Systems, a kegging specialty 
company."  The specific quote is, "Although some people shake their kegs to 
speed up the carbonation process, this is a bad practice because the 
agitation can affect shelf life and head forming capacity.  Shaking breaks 
some of the medium-length peptide chains necessary for head formation."  He 
gives four references at the end of the article but doesn't give a specific 
citation for this claim.  When I saw this, I wondered about it myself.  It 
seemed implausible on its face and contrary to my experience.  I'd like to 
know Cliff's source for this. Thanks, Domenick, for refutation from someone 
who knows peptides. 
 
Dave Draper in Sidney has carbonation problems.  Dave, one first place to 
check, although it's not too likely, is crown caps and bottle lips.  Make 
sure they are sealing.  However, I bet that the change in extracts is the 
source of your problem.  I imagine that the dry extract you used in the UK 
had more slowly fermentable residuals that added to the bottle CO2.  
Assuming that you are looking for 2.3 volumes, a rather typical carbonation, 
your latest try of 9 g priming sugar/liter should be right on.  Here's why:  
yeast metabolizes sugar into nearly half CO2 and half EtOH, which would give 
you 4.5 g CO2/liter, which is 2.3 volumes (see Warner, "German Wheat Beer," 
p. 39).  I think you've already solved your problem empirically.  BTW, have 
you considered batch priming?  It seems to me to be a lot less trouble, as 
long as you make sure the priming solution is evenly distributed. 
 
Spencer Thomas asks for ideas for a dunkleweizen, and I though I'd share the 
ideas I already gave him privately.  I like to use Munich malt for 
continental darks.  I think it gives the proper rich maltiness without the 
dark roasted flavor that is out of place.  Since only 30% of his grain bill 
is barley malt, substituting Munich for Pils would only give a ruddy color, 
as Spencer points out.  I have made "Munich" wheat malt following Miller's 
(CHHB, pp. 202-203) directions for home kilned Munich barley malt, and from 
which I made a dunkleweizen.  I had no conversion problems, so enzymes 
seemed OK.  Spencer doesn't remember, but he probably judged this beer at 
the 1993 Mich. State Fair, where it took a (probably weak) third (it was 
newly bottled).  A dark crystal would not be out of place, either.  I don't 
have experience with aromatic malt, something I intend to remedy.  I think 
chocolate malt, unless subliminal, would be out of place. 
 
Having said all this in favor of using lots of Munich, I should offer one 
caveat:  I believe such dark grains are more susceptible to HSA.  I have a 
low OG (1.040) dark lager that was all Munich and some crystal that was 
lagered for six weeks and then kept too long at dispensing temperature 
(44^F). After 10 weeks on tap it began to acquire a toffee flavor, and 
within two more weeks it had crashed and burned, become undrinkably wet 
cardboardy.  It tasted great when it was fresh.  Polyclar at racking might 
have helped, but I'm a careful brewer and hadn't had the problem before, so 
I didn't use it. 
 
George Cavanaugh has trouble with Japanese beetles.  George, an effective, 
"green" method of control is a pheromone baited trap.  They really work.  If 
you can't get one locally, try Gardens Alive at (812)537-8650 (usual

George Tempel (& Frank Haist) is worried about low mash extract.  George, I 
agree with Randy Davis, you've made a good start. But you are right, you 
should be able to get a better extract.  A few thoughts.  Don't rush your 
sparge.  If everything is working right, you can pull the runoff so fast 
that the sugars don't have time to dissolve.  One gallon per five or six 
minutes should be tops.  This can especially be a problem if you don't mash 
off, since they are less soluble at lower temperatures.  You could safely 
raise your sparge temperature to 176^F.  Since you already diluted your mash 
going from protein rest to saccharification, you may not want to add any 
more boiling water to take it up to mash off.  However, you may be able to 
skip the protein rest in favor of a mash off.  If you are using American two 
row, a protein rest is probably unnecessary.  You mention that your initial 
runoff was a little cloudy.  You may want to consider recirculating the 
first one or two gallons.  An additional advantage to this is you can use a 
decoction mash off by heating the early runoff to boiling before stirring it 
back into the mash, or at least the top 3/4, so you don't disturb the bottom 
of the grain bed.  You might also get a longer wooden spoon or paddle since 
you said you can't reach the bottom of the Gott.  If you watch your runoff 
pH and SG (cool before checking both), you'll get an idea of when to stop 
and whether you've left any "goodies" in the Gott.  I like to stop around 
1.005 - 1.008, as long as the pH is under six.  At this point it has nearly 
no color or sweetness.  You might be able to sparge a little more if you 
begin to boil after the first gallon (watch for scorching), thereby reducing 
volume earlier. 
 
Earlier, Melissa Schauder had some questions, some of which were nicely 
answered here later.  Melissa, I will fulfill your misgivings that someone 
would suggest that you invest in a good brewing book by doing just that.  
They aren't expensive.  Now that it's the end of the semester, you must be 
returning some textbooks for credit (you know, that "Seventeenth Century 
Hungarian Cathedrals" that you had to buy for History of Art and then never 
even cracked ?).  I would recommend one of three, depending on your style.  
Charlie Papazian's "Complete Joy of Homebrewing" is fun and loosey goosey, 
full of recipes, and really encouraging in its "Relax, don't worry, have a 
homebrew" approach.  Dave Miller's "Complete Book of Brewing" is kind of at 
the opposite end of the scale - scientifically oriented, more of why, not 
just what to do.  Miller's new book, "Brewing the World's Great Beers", is 
in the middle, more of a beginner's "how to," but to my mind, better based 
on good techniques than Charlie's.  Any one of these would repay their 
investment many times over. 
 
You asked if anyone else in St. Louis  brews.  Indeed they do, and there are 
two clubs.  The aforementioned Dave Miller is now brewmaster at the St. 
Louis Brewery, but he used to be president of the St. Louis Brews.  Contact 
Jerry S. Dahl, 9 Adams Lane, Kirkwood, MO 63122, (314)822-8039.  There is 
also the Mo. Winemaking Society, c/o Paul Hendricks, 2018 Norma Lane, St. 
Louis, MO, 63138. 
 
Brewers in the rest of the country - see the comprehensive list of clubs in 
the new Zymurgy (the same one with questionable peptide information).  Then 
join a club near you.  If you are a beginner, there will be lots of advice, 
encouragement and feedback available from more experienced brewers.  If you 
are experienced, there is still more to learn, and you can offer beginners 
your pearls of wisdom.  I learn something new every meeting (or HBD, for 
that matter). 
 
David Lambermont asks about mash temperature and thermometer advice.  Yes, 
David, you will find an enormous difference in temperatures in a mash.  Stir 
with a good paddle (but don't aerate).  You wanted a quick responding 
thermometer.  A dial stem thermometer is the ticket.  Our local Sam's club 
has a three pack of adjustable, one inch dial, six inch stem, American made 
thermometers, for under $10!  I almost bought a pack, even though I don't 
need any more.

Fellow Brewers,


I asked a question a couple of weeks ago about brewpubless states...we
unfortunate souls seem to be MS, SC, GA, AL (?), HI (about to be rectified), 
and PA (something about wierd laws).  Someone also mentioned UT - but I seem
to remember posts about Utah brewpubs - maybe just micros?  If you live in
or just love Mississippi - please write me - I have nebulous desires to change
our brewpublessness.  If you have been active in changing the laws elsewhere,
your input would be invaluable!  TIA.

club...please e-mail, regular mail or phone me...

I guess beetle traps don't work for you?  Hand picking is about the
only other method I know.  I assume you use stuff to kill grubs in
your lawn so they don't survive to become beetles the following
year.  Maybe local garden groups or your friendly local cooperative
extension agent would have suggestions.

Subject: Picnic Tap and Hose Rinser (was: New Kegger)


In HBD #1438, new kegger Bill Rust solicited clever ideas on how to clean
picnic tappers.  I know where he's coming from.  Soda kegs are very convenient,
but I always hated drawing one or two pints and then be faced with cleaning the
picnic tap.  I never felt comfortable leaving it on the keg with its beverage
line full of beer, and I quickly grew tired of partially dismantling it to rinse
it out.  So, a few years ago, I designed this gadget to make my life easier.

Items 1a and 1b are often packaged as a set and can be found in most home
improvement stores.  The Snap Nipple (Item 1a) screws onto your sink faucet and
stays there.  The Washing Machine (or dishwasher) Quick-Disconnect (Item 1b)
snaps on and off the snap nipple in the same manner as a ball-lock soda
disconnect.  There are two types of these available.  One has a small diameter
snap nipple and a smooth white plastic disconnect ring.  The other type has a
larger diameter snap nipple and a white disconnect ring with ridges on it. 
This second type of disconnect incorporates an aerator.  If you are installing
a snap nipple to your faucet, and you have to remove an aerator from the faucet
to do it, continued domestic bliss dictates that you use the second type.


Item 2, the 3/4" FHT x 1/2" FPT Adapter, adapts (duh!) the quick-disconnect's
3/4" male hose threads to the MP Reducer 1/2" MPT x 1/4" MPT (Item 3).  The
reducer is a means of adapting from 1/2" threads to the 1/4" threads of the
Ball Lock Adapter 1/4" FPT x 9/16-18 Male (Item 4).  The Liquid Tank Plug Assy,
Cornelius Ball (Item 5) then threads onto the ball lock adapter.


I keep this gadget in a kitchen drawer where it's handy.  After I've drawn a
pint from a keg, I remove the picnic tap, line and disconnect and bring it to
the kitchen sink.  I attach the keg disconnect to the gadget, attach the gadget
to the faucet, turn on the faucet, and then run water through the picnic tap
and line to rinse it out.  I know it isn't sanitized, but at least it's somewhat
clean.


I use quick-disconnects in many places in my brewery.  My jet bottle washer has
one attached and snaps right onto my kitchen faucet for quick use, then snaps
off.  My wort chiller has a snap nipple on it, and I attach it to the faucet
with a washing machine hose with Q-Ds on each end of it.  I have a hose sprayer
with a snap nipple on it and, using the chiller's washing machine hose, I attach
the sprayer to the hose and the hose to the kitchen faucet, to facilitate
cleaning out kegs and spraying the cat.


Obviously, with a small change of parts, this gadget could also be used with
pin-lock disconnects.


Enjoy!

Does anybody out there belong to a homebrewing club at a university?  I 
was thinking of starting one at mine and would appreciate any tips/ideas 
about activities or the like.  emailing me privately may be better as to 
not waste space/time.  Thanksalot.


Also, someone asked about mailing homebrews.  I mailed a six pack, in the
cardboard holder, wrapped with some newspaper and bubble wrap, in a box 
barely bigger, and they arrived fine.  I did use stronger Pacifico bottles.
I don't think the stirring will be a problem if the recipient lets them 
settle.  What the post office doesn't know won't hurt 'em- just my 
opinion on the alcohol mailing policy.  One possibly major problem- it 
cost me $11+ to mail the six pack, ups.

Subject: First "pressings"


Somebody posed a question a few days back about a Japaneese brewery 
advertising that they use only the "first pressings".


That sounded familiar so I dug out "The Practical Brewer" and sure 
enough the  chapter on wort production describes the use of a filter 
press for wort separation.


After the filter is full and the wort has been recirculated for clarity, the
first wort is drained before sparging begins. Some copywriter seeing this 
might (I guess) call the first runnings the "first pressings."

Can someone tell me what level of extraction I can anticipate using Phil's

I'm in the process of beginning an All Grain Brew, and have read in
previous HBD that one should know or have a good idea at what the level of
extraction should be with one's equipment when designing a recipe.


also can one take an OG before boiling to figure the level of extraction
pts/gal or can you only tell after the boil?

Subject: German tested Extract Weizen recipe


After 3 attempts, I have finally perfected an extract Weizen recipe that even
the Germans at our Munich-based company approve of;


1 can Brewmart Mexican Cerveza-style kit, hopped
1 can Munton and Fison Wheat Malt Extract
1/2 # Wheat Grain, cracked and seeped for 45 minutes `at` 150 deg.
1 tsp. Irish Moss (last 5 min. of boil for clarity)
1 pk. yeast from Brewmart kit


Fermented at about 80 deg. and bottld with 1 cup Corn Sugar. Ready at 3 weeks.
Sounds strange, but came out excellent. VERY much like German Weizens on tap 
in Munich. (not hefe or dunkel, though....still more experimenting to be done)


Hope this helps some beginners out there. ( And maybe some all-grain types
who are adventurous enough to visit this side of the fence for 1 batch :)  )


I had tried the True Brew Weizen (with 2 Wheat cans) before with thumbs down
from the Germans. (and me too...) I also tried the above recipe with 1# Light
DME instead of the 1/2# wheat with similar results (thumbs down).

Subject: Fruit beers


Greetings to all of you folks out there in homebrew-land.  I have a
question for you all.  Being that the Summer is here and a local farm
will soon have pick your own blueberries, I plan to brew my summertime
traditional fruit beer.  Last year I made a raspberry ale that was
quite excellent.  I tossed the raspberries in at the end of the boil
to pasteurize them, and then tossed everything into the primary
fermenter.  While the resulting beer had a noticeable pink hue and
tart aroma, it lacked the serious raspbeery (pun intended) flavor
that I was after.  I seem to remember that at one point there was a 
discussion here relating to the use of fruit in beers.  So, my question:
Is it better to add the fruit to the secondary fermenter or directly
to the primary as I did?  Does fermentation scrub lots of the
raspbeery character out of the beer?  If the fruit is added to the
secondary, how is it pasteurized?  In thumbing through the Cat's Meow,
I see recipies that use both methods.  I would be grateful for any
answers.
        By the way, if anyone wants my raspbeery ale recipe, email me.


Thanks, everyone, in advance!

Subject: Starting the Siphon


  In an effort to keep this thread alive, I have to relate the technique I
used to start a siphon last night. I was tranferring from a carboy into my
bottling bucket. I had the racking cane in the carboy, held in place with
one of those orange, two hole, rubber caps (I don't know what they're called).
The cane was stuck through one hole, and I blew into the other. This started 
the siphon with no problems. This may not be too sanitary, but it can't be
much worse than what lands in the beer as it sits in the bucket.

This is like asking what's the best tasting food.  You'll get more opinions
than hop varieties, and it really depends on what style of beer you're
brewing.  I personally like East Kent Golding, Hallertauer Mittelfrueh, Saaz,
Liberty, Mt. Hood, and Cascades.  Which one's are best?  You got me.


The alpha acid percentage is not critical if added at the end of boil and
quickly chilled.  This is because it takes elevated temperatures to
isomerize the alpha acids into their bitter components.  There will be some
bittering contribution though, as the wort will remain at elevated
temperature for a finite amount of time (also depends on the type of chilling
and the method of finish hopping).

I just made a dunkelweizen this weekend.  I would say, from reading Warner's
book, that the best way to add color is with dark munich malt.  I don't
think (from memory) that he used crystal or chocolate malt in any of his 
recipes.  Since I could not find any dark munich malt, however, I "cheated"
with crystal and chocolate malt.  My grain bill (for 5 US gallons):


        5 lbs wheat malt
        3 lbs light munich
        1.25 lbs Briess 2-row
        8 oz light crystal (20L)
        2 oz medium crystal (40L)
        2 oz chocolate malt (400L)


This, along with a 90-minute boil, gave me the medium-amber color I was 
looking for.  Time will tell if the crystal and chocolate will give the
beer an undesirable harshness.  I think you'd want a fairly soft finish
in any weizen.  I've tried this year's SA Summer Wheat (Dunkelweizen) and
I think it's too harsh, as well as under-carbonated.   The color's right, 
though.


Speaking of color and dunkelweizens... 


Does anyone else think that the AHA color range for Dunkelweizen is 
too dark?  If the range is 17-22 SRM and 17 SRM = Michelob Classic Dark,
then all the commercial dunkelweizens I've had (4 or 5) have been too
light for style.


and...


Does anyone have a chart that compares degrees L or SRM with EBC?  I have
the formula from George Fix's article but since he disparaged it and
since I hate math a simple comparison chart might be more useful to me.

Subject: Brew Cap


Hello,
        This is about siphoning.  I've been away from the Digest, and so
may have missed it, but has anyone tried a thing called Brew Cap?  It's a
soft plastic cap that snugs over the carboy mouth.  It has two nipples on
top, with a hole in the end of each.  Into one goes the siphon cane, into
the other goes pressure from ye olde lungs.  You blow into the auxillary
nipple, increasing the air pressure inside the carboy, and forcing beer
up the siphon cane & tube.  No muss, no fuss.  Works great.  Cheap too.
Beer is not touched by human hands, so infection risk is minimal (of course
you might want to take a slug of Wild Turkey before you blow, purely for its
oral sanitization properties, mind you).
        Hey, if this was already mentioned, don't flame me.  I'm already
sufficiently crisp.

BOSTON - multiple opinions listed.


BrewPubs


Cambridge Brewing Co, Hampshire St., Cambridge MA
 - Beer is very good and the food is excellent.  Best brewpub in Boston area.
 - I haven't thought much of their regular beers, but occasionally the
specials were \wonderful/ (Bronx Cheer Stout...). Food a bit random.


Boston Beer Works, Brookline St (across from Fenway Park)
 - Good, avoid ball game crowds
 - Excellent beers but it's a tad noisy here.  Gotta try their IPA!
 - Good eclectic food in fairly substantial portions. Wide variety of beers-
good flagship red, golden with raspberry or blueberry (latter very good),
stout, strong ale, lots of specials. Probably the best currently open.
WARNING: they're directly opposite Fenway Park, so they'll be jammed if
the Red Sox are at home.


John Harvard Brewpub, 33 Dunster St, Cambridge
 - 'Nicest' brewpub, beers are so-so, food very good.


Commonwealth Brewery, Portland St.  (1 block from the Boston Garden)
 - IMHO the worst BP for beers.  Serve everything in heavy thick glasses so
it feels like a lot but it isn't.
 - English style, OK bitter (they've weakened the recipes in recent years)
and stout, OK food.
(This is the only BP I've been to in Boston and I didn't like the beer - B.
DeBolt)


 - In the Boston area, my favorites are Boston Beer Works, conveniently
located directly across the street from Fenway Park, near Kenmore Square
and John Harvard's Brewhouse in Harvard Square, Cambridge.


BARS


Doyles, 3484 Washington St, Boston (Jamaica Plain)
 - The best bar in city area.  Very old and dark.  About 25 beers on tap 
and they're very good about keeping things fresh.  The food is strictly
bar food. Funky neighborhood but worth the visit.


Sunset Grill, Brighton Ave, Boston, near Union Sq Allston (~2 miles from
downtown, reachable by public transport, "T" line)
 - Most people consider this the premier beer bar but it's a little too
noisy and crowded for my taste.  Widest selection of beer, food pretty good.
 - Good food in large portions, ~300 bottled beers, and 70 taps (including 
at least one great beer, Old Newbury, that you can't get anywhere else
except a small area up on the coast north of Boston).


Plough and Stars, Mass Ave (Between Harvard and Central Sq.), Cambridge
 - Small working class bar with the best pint of Guinness around.  Very
friendly atmosphere.  The lunches are not to be missed - out of this world!


OTHER MASSACHUSETTS PLACES


Northampton Brewery, Northampton MA
 - Nice place, the beer range from mundane (Amber, Golden) to some pretty
interesting (Holiday, Summer...) offerings. They also serve some guest
brews (Harpoon ...). A wonderful beer garden.


Amherst Ale House, Amherst MA - beer bar with a vast selection.


Spirit Haus, Amherst MA - liquor store, over 300 beers.  A bit pricey IMHO.
(ie 5.95 for Lindemanns).


Latest best NE Beer ... Middlesex Oatmeal Stout (from Burlington MA I think)


VERMONT


As for my $.02 on the topic, you've got to go to The Vermont Pub and 
Brewery in Burlington - Greg Noonan's place. Best brewpub I've been to. 


Brattleboro
 - Windham Brewey/Latchis Grill (Lathis Hotel)- good beers, good food. A 
little bit of the yuppie wannabe influence. They are looking for a brewer, 
bring your resume' if interested.
 - McNeils Ale House (in the old fire station) - about 12 offerings on tap
plus a selection of other guest beers and a bunch of bottled products.


This comment from a Boston resident - McNeil's beer, atmosphere, and prices 
better than Boston BP's, especially better beer.


General Vermont List for others


Bridgewater - Mountain Brewers, Bridgewater Market Place, Rt. 4


Norwich - Jasper Murdocks Ale House, (IN the Norwich Inn)


White River Junction - Catamount Brewery  296-2248


Middlebury - Otter Creek Brewing Co., Exchange St.


Burlington
 - Vermont Pub & Brewery, Corner of St. Paul and College St.'s
 - Due early summer, Magic Hat Brewing Co., Flynn Av.


MAINE


>From an earlier HBD post:
 - Portland - Gritty McDuff's, great Black Fly Stout
 - Kennebunkport - Federal Jack's, Brown Moose Ale and Blue Fin Stout, very 
 good. 


Others mentioned, no opinions given:
Magic Hat--Kennebunkport??
Sunday River--Bethel
Breadloaf Brewery--near breadloaf usa (may not be open yet)
Geary's--Location unknown to me, available in stores
Bar Harbor--there are rumors of four breweries in this small town.


This is from a Boston resident - the best I have been to is found in Camden
(better than Boston area BP's), called Sea Dog.  They have a very attractive 
pub and conduct tours on Saturdays (perhaps more often in the summer).


RHODE ISLAND - only one brewpub


Union Station Brewery in Providence.  In Union Station, across street from 
new Convention Center, off I95.  Five of their own brews on tap at all 
times which vary from a characterless Golden Lager to a decent porter and 
some good ales.

Subject: Question on priming with extract


I know this is probably a stupid question, but any help would be appreciated.


I almost always keg my beer, but we all need to bottle occasionally for 
friends, competitions, etc.  I have been using the standard corn sugar
ratios.


If I was to use dry malt extract, how much would I use?  Typical 'boil
with a little water and cool' routine?


Thanks in advance.
