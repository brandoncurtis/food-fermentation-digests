Greetings
In an effort to calibrate my feeble knowledge of hops, can anyone tell me what
type of hops are used in the beer giants such as Budweiser, Coors,  Millers,
ect? To me, the hop character of each brand is almost identical (as well as
being almost completely muted).  Do they all use the same hop variety, or what?

Subject: keg fridge comments


Greetings:


I finally began using my keg fridge last weekend - what a pleasure it was!
I bought an OLD used fridge for $50, bought the tap hardware from
Superior Products for $30, installed the tap through the door of the fridge
and now have my favorite brews on tap.  


Using a "real" tap instead of the cobra tap is a difference like night and day.
I was forever playing with dispensing temps and pressures with the cobra.
The first beer I drew I used 10 psi and out came a great ale with just the
right amount of head.  Perfect.  Needless to say, once my friends discovered
my new toy, the first keg went quite rapidly {:^)


Bottom line:  If you've started kegging and are disappointed with results,
make that extra investment, get a fridge and a tap and enjoy.


BTW - I bought 3 kegs from St. Patricks in TX for $33 + s/h, and even though
they are pin types, they are ~2 inches taller than the kegs I had.  Just a data
point if you try to lay the kegs in the fridge.


regards

Subject: Autolysis


My thanks to all who responded to my last question on Scottish
Ale yeasts.  Especially to Jeff Frane for providing exactly the
information I was looking for.  Did anyone add that to the Yeast
FAQ?  That was the first place I looked....


In reading Foster's book on Porter over the weekend I came
across a comment from him that ale yeast was more prone to
autolysis than lager yeast.  Sorry I can't be more exact than
that, I'm at work and I don't have his book in front of me.  My
experience to date would tend to suggest the opposite is true.
I've never had a batch of ale yeast autolyse on me, but I have
had a couple lagers go after sitting at room temp for three
weeks or so.  Comments anyone?

Subject: Washing machine mashers


I thought of the idea of a washing machine masher a couple of years ago while I
was considering building a RIMS (recirculating infusion mash system after
Rodney Moris' article in Zymurgy gadgets edition).  I thought that a washing
machine could probably be modified to brew.  However, after thinking about it
and bouncing the idea off a fellow brewer and colleague, I decided that the
washing machine would need too many modifications to be worth the trouble.  One
of the major modifications would be the agitator hub and transmission -- the
seal between the hub and the transmission is not good enough to prevent oil or
grease from getting into the mash.  Although this does not happen often with
clothes, it does happen.  The mash might even cause this to happen prematurely. 
I don't believe that the pumps or hoses are of food grade type either.  


I am not saying that it can't be done.  Being an engineer I often think that
there isn't anything that can't be done.  The effort or cost is usually what
decides what will and will not be done.

Subject: Cheese Vat as mash-tun?




I have acquired a 30 gallon SS cheese vat.  The vat is cylindro-spherical
in shape, with a bottom drain, hinged lid, and a steam jacket.  It came
with various screens, cutters, and molds for making cheese, but the thing
that caught my attention was the integrated steam jacket (also that fact
that the unit was the right price -- free :-).  The steam jacket envelopes
the the bottom 75% of the tank, and in effect, makes this thing a giant
double boiler.  There are pipes coming out of the jacket, for steam in
and for steam out.


Can this beast be used as a mashing vessel?  It would seem to me that it
would be ideal for step-mashing.  Does anyone have some thoughts/suggestions
in this regard?

Subject: Pale ale?




I'm on my 8th or 9th batch of homebrew and have made only darker beers so far.
I've enjoyed, browns, porters, some splendid stouts and bitters, a dark steam
etc. But I finally got the urge for a pale.  I attempted an IPA using
Charlie P.'s recipee but I used amber malt and so missed the piss-yellow 
color I was hoping for.  So I have tried again...  


My problem is that this batch, currently sitting quietly in a carboy, 
waiting for me to get around to bottling, was supposed to be an IPA---
But it looks like a nice dark brown.  I brew from extract and used 
Ironmaster's IPA beer kit.  I added 3 lbs of light Steinhart Co.
malt extract to get 7lbs total.  The shock came when I poured the Ironmaster
malt into the boil, I thought it didn't look pale.. oh well.  It still
doesn't look pale.  Is it possible that they mislabeled their malt? Has anyone
had this problem, should I write to Ironmaster?  Also, perhaps once I bottle
it the beer will magically transform into a piss-yellow pale...  


(P.S. I also missed the starting gravity for an IPA, mine was 1.040 not the
1.070 I wanted, I geuss I should use about 10 or 12 lbs of extract next time).

I have a question that I think may be able to be answered here.  I am 
a relatively new homebrewer (about 8 batches) and I need to know if 
twist off returnables are okay to use for homebrewing.  I recently 
acquired several from a friend who wants to contribute to my hobby to 
help me "get rid of all that beer I'm making".  I have heard that they 
are okay and that they are not.  I tried capping one and it seems to 
be pretty tight but I am reluctant to waste a whole batch testing it 
out.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Subject: Extraction Rate Question 


Folks - 


After yesterday starting my second all-grain batch, I'm looking
for a little wisdom on extraction rates.  I seem to be getting
rates of about 25, and was expecting more.  Yesterday, for example,
I made a brown ale with:
          8   lbs. Kleges
          3/4 lb.  Crystal
          1/4 lb.  Chocolate
          1/4 lb.  Black Patent
I was expecting a SG of about 1.046 or above, and ended up with 1.042.  
Granted, 1.042 is OK for a brown ale, but I'd like to be able to 
predict better, and understand what is going on with the mash.  I
did a simple infusion mash at approx 152 degrees for 90 minutes.
I used a Gott Cooler with the Phils' Phalse Bottom. (see note below),
and sparged with 4 gallons of 170 degree water over the course of an
hour.  I did not measure PH, but know that my well water is very hard,
and perhaps a bit alkaline.  Any clues on how to improve my yield?


Note:  As a scout leader, and with three kids of my own, I was hesitant
       to modify the Gott in such a way that it couldn't be used as
       a normal cooler.  I purchased the Tomlinson faucet that is
       available by mail from Gott, and by drilling it out ever so 
       slightly, got a snug fit to the hard plastic tubing that is
       used for bottle fillers, etc.  A cut a short piece of this, 
       mated it to some siphon tubing, and mated that to the false
       bottom.  This unit can be easily removed, is secure when 
       installed, and leaves the cooler available for other uses also.


Note 2:I didn't receive many (only one) responses on the BrewTek yeast
       question a few weeks ago.  Come on, anybody use these strains?
       any one you particularly like, or dislike?  Any problems 
       culturing?  Inquiring minds want to know!  (Yeah, that phrase
       grates on my nerves too...)


Thanks,

Does anybody have a mash schedule that includes temperatures, time, pH,
mineral content of H2O, ect.. Please either post or email me directly

Subject: Questions on strength; more malt? Honey? Other options?




        I bought supplies the other day to make a stout, and then
        later decided I wanted to make the brew a little stringer.


        I've got 6.8 lbs of Laaglander dark malt.


        The question is, what's the best way to get a little more strength
        without producing a lot more sweeteness?


        I was thinking of adding more malt, or maybe some corn sugar?


        The guy at the local brewshop said 'Or you can try honey, but 
        I've never tried it with a stout', and went on to say that
        honey gives strength without a lot else.


        So? Any opinions? I would like to produces something quite 
        strong, but I don't want somethings hugely sweet. I know
        sugar would work, but I'm leery of sugar; it seems, I dunno,
        *fake* somehow.


        So what's the best way? 




                Thanks.....


        (Oh, BTW, thanks to all those who helped me out on my 'is it
        stalled' question. I bottled yesterday, it tastes good already,
        can't wait to see what it's like when the bottles are ready!)

Subject: Q: Quality of Vienna/Munich malts?


In reading George and Laurie Fix's book on the history and brewing
of Vienna style beers, they make it quite clear that the quality of
the base malt in the grain bill is of the greatest importance when
brewing this style of beer.  They emphasize that good quality 
pilsener malt (e.g. of the Moravian variety) should be used and
that as-good-as-possible crystal malts be used to obtain the
proper color.  It is mentioned that historically, Vienna malt
was indeed high-quality (e.g. Moravian) malt that was kilned
to a higher temperature and the color was already in the base
malt.   In modern times, however, "Vienna" malt  is produced
by using a lower-quality base malt and therefore wasn't very
suitable for producing a good quality Vienna beer when used as
the sole grain. 


"Munich" malts, as we know them, are also specuated to be made
of lesser barley varieties (although I'm sure the big German
brewers could get exactly the grain they want, just us
small folks have to take what's available.)  Same comments apply
here.




The authors hint that there may "soon" become the recognition
among maltsters that a Vienna malt made from Moravian(esque) barley
has a market, and a beer could be made that much better. Does 
anybody know if such a malt is available?  It would be good
to try brewing with such a grain and compare it to the pilser/crystal
combination.

        that would be a bad idea. I would think it would be *too* fine;
        you'd loose too much of the matter in your beer; and with it, 
        a quantify of your yeast.


        Also, it would clog very quickly; these things aren't that
        good an handling large particulate matter. So you'd keep
        having to rinse it....

Subject: Can someone explain the different grains


When I brewed my first all grain brew, I went to me local supply store and
the recipe I was trying was just a basic Pale Ale (Just wanted to start
simple).  They had a variety of 2 row grains.  They had American Pale Malt,
German Pale Malt and Belgin Pale Malt.  They also have a similar grouping
of Crystals and Wheats from differnt countries.


The store told me that they are basically all the same, just from different
countries.


Is this true, or does one country make a better grain than the other. What
are the major differences? The prices were the same or only 5 or 10 cents a
pound difference.

Subject: Kegging Thanks, Toronto Brew


Many thanks to those who sent email to help with my foaming
problems with my first keg.  Things are going well now, so
I'll try to summarize my findings.  I realize that these
generalizations are inherently limited, and you experienced
keggers will cringe, and perhaps flame.  Nonetheless, here
goes, for the benefit of other neophytes:


1. The dispensing temperature and pressure must be fairly
constant for about 1 day prior to dispensing.  This may 
require venting of carbonating pressure well in advance of
dispensing.  Dispensing at 8 PSI at ~50F works well for me.


2. A partially dispensed keg should receive additional CO2
pressure prior to storage in a warmer environment.  If
the keg warms without added pressure, the CO2 will come 
out of solution and the beer will go flat.  Storage at
20 PSI is working OK for me.  Extra pressure, even up to
the 40 PSI I carbonate at would be OK, but would require
additional time to decarbonate/depressurize to dispensing 
levels, a waste of time and CO2.


3. It is very easy to lose track of consumption while drinking
off a keg.  Don't try to gauge by the accumulation of empties!


FYI: I'm keeping the in-use keg in about a foot of icewater
in a 5g bucket, and shopping desperately for a fridge.  My
basement stays cool, if you store a keg in a warmer area,
you may need higher storage pressure.


Also, next week I'll be in Toronto, at the Hotel Plaza II
on Bloor street.  I may not have a car.  Any good spots in
the area?  Please respond via email. Stay away from my wife.

My recent request for a extract Duvel recipe yielded one helpful bit of
information but no recipes.  While I would hate to break up the 
fascinating "how clean is my mouth" suction series on starting siphons,
I thought the playful minds of the digest might be interested in 
discoursing at length on how they would go about reverse engineering 
a particular beer, say Duvel.  What I have learned to date is that 
Duvel uses two hops Saaz and Styrians (sp?) and two (!) yeasts, one
for bottle conditioning only (implying that culturing from the dregs
may not give good results(?)).  Other things I know are:
8 or 9 % alcohol in the bottle
golden yellow color
tastes good
If you guys have not tried this beer, it is worth looking for IMHO.  I
have had the good fortune of trying it in Europe (read fresh and 
inexpensive).  If I remember correctly Michael J. gives it four stars ****
in one of his books i.e. a world class beer.
TIA for your kind consideration.

I brewed some beer in 1982 and bottled it using priming sugar for 
carbonation, gelatin for fining and ascorbic acid for preservative.  
I ran across a six pack in 1988.  It was *still* good!  I couldn't 
believe it.  The only thing that concerned me was the color of the 
cork under the caps.  The cork had turned almost black.  It tasted 
good anyway, and I suffered no ill effects.  A few years later, I 
actually drank the last bottle.

A couple of recent posts complained about not being able to get into
the Homebrew Archives at sierra.stanford.edu.  Well, the ftp software
limits the number of simultaneous ftp connections to five and somehow
it lost count and got stuck thinking that there were five logged in
when there was nobody home.


I've reset the count and connections are pouring in.  There's probably
some pent up demand but you should be able to get your files now.


Personally, I think that poor thing just got tired and wanted to take
a break.  For the month of May we had over 13,000 ftp connections that
transfered over 1.8 Gigabytes of data.  Almost all of this was beer
related.


Finally, the department is going to reorganize the computer facilities
here and there is a 50-50 chance that the archives will have to move.
If and when this happens I will try to find another place locally that
I can shift to.  If that is not possible, I will find another site to
take on the job before we have to close.  Don't worry, any change is
still several months in the future, and I have hopes that the archives
will still be welcome under the new setup.

>I just got done skimming this misinformation . . .  
                 ^^^^^^^^
Perhaps if you had READ the complete article, you wouldn't have jumped to
such needless conclusions.  


>I got pretty peeved for two reasons, one is that "tips" like these have 
>no basis in brewing science and are contrary to accepted practice, 
>especially with regard to increased leaching of tannins from the lauter tun.  


In theory, of course, you are right.  However, the words "accepted practice"
leave the resonant sound, in my mind, of lemmings running for the cliff.  
Granted, there has been a great deal of advancement in the brewing trade,
and craft for that matter, by the careful study of processes.  We have all
gained a fair amount of control over our hobbies as a result of this, but 
I think there is always room for new ideas and new ways of approaching things.  
The folks who brought us lambics, pilsners, and steam styles of beer went 
against "accepted practice."  Of course, they were concerned with different 
types of fermentation techniques, and we are dealing with sparging 
techniques here.  


If you had read Jack's article carefully, you would have stumbled across the 
words: ". . . but if you use boiling water in THIS system, the average 
temperature will be well below 170F and you will be lucky to keep it above 
150F" (my emphasis).  Jack is merely stating what he has found to be true 
with regard to the easy mashing system.  I lauter in a Gott cooler and I get
very little temperature drop, but I imagine if I used a kettle the heat 
transfer would be much greater.  Therefore, I would need to boost my initial
sparge water temperature, wouldn't I?  The key word here is obviously "this,"
which is used as an adjective modifying "system" in Jack's article.  This 
would lead me to conclude that Jack did not mean that boiling water 
sparges should be used in EVERY system.  Jack's article was not meant to 
be "brewing science" only recorded observation as it relates to the
easy mashing setup.


>Secondly, the "article" is basically free advertising for JSP and had 
>no buisness being in the articles section , it belonged in some product 
>review area.  


While there were references to obtaining said easy mashing system from
Jack Schmidling Productions in the article, there was also a comprehensive
parts list that anyone with a little motivation could have used to assemble
all the necessary parts, i.e., build their own easy masher.  Also, you'll
notice in the article it wasn't referred to as the EASYMASHER(tm).  The
"article" as you call it appeared in the section reserved for brewers 
entitled: "Brewers' Forum."  Which, in past issues, has brought us such 
notable contributions as:
"Modifying Half_Barrel Kegs for Use as Brewing Vessels," by Martin Manning
"A Three-Tiered Gravity-Flow Brewing System," by Bob Caplan
"Beer Tree: A Three-Tiered System with Roots in Simplicity," by David O'Neil
and many others.  All of the articles that have appeared in this section
of the magazine are written from the [home]brewer's perspective.  Hence, the 
designation "Brewers' Forum."  I'm sure the editor was very careful to 
put Jack's article, as well as those mentioned above, in this section 
because they really aren't written to be "technical" articles.  They are
examinations into the tools of our trade as it relates to the home brewing
scale.  My reading of Jack's article suggests that it had every right to 
be included in the "Brewers' Forum."  However, it is ultimately the editor's
decision, and I happen to agree with it.


>I'm sure the "Oracle" has something silly to say about all of this.


Perhaps, but so do I.  And it seems that jumping to conclusions based on
"skimming" only perpetuates "misinformation," which is silly in itself, 
isn't it?

That's the point, isn't it?  Does it really matter how we arrive at our 
product as long as our processes work for us?

On January 12, 1993 I bottled an attempt at a Belgian Wit in which I used a bit 
too much coriander for flavoring. I found the flavor and aroma off-putting and
just left the whole works on my basement floor where the temp is 55-60 F. 
This past weekend I decided to check it out and found that the coriander is less
offensive to me now and I can drink it. Obviously this was a clean brew as it is
crystal clear and quite stable after 18 months in bottle. Slightly over-
carbonated (about the same as most commercial beers) but good. I used only
malted barley, wheat, yeast and a very small addition of hops along with
coriander and orange peel in this brew. Initial gravity was ~1.044.


Anyway, my point is that clean homebrew stored in a cool dark place can have a
very long shelf life without any additives although most will be at their peak
fairly early.

>From *Jeff* Renner 
 
Cliff Tanner has E-mailed me the following about his "shaken peptides" 
passage in the recent Zymurgy (assume I put <'s in front of every line):  
 
As for the inadvisability of shaking a keg to carbonate, there was a long 
 thread on CIS awile ago about this.  I thought I had that archived, but 
 can't seem to find it right now.  In general the consensus was that shaking 
 might indeed be bad for the beer -- and since it was unnecessary anyway, 
 why do it?  My first inklings about this came from the shaker trays in 
 commercial beer laboraties.  in support of that the following was presented 
 by David Klatte, who is a commecrial brewer: 
 
 <Given enough time all beer will oxidize, creating off flavors and haze. 
 Heat and agitation speed this process up tremendously.  Beer is "force 
 aged" in analytical laboraties by heat and continuous agitation.> 
 
 <Beer has a finite ability to create a good, foamy head.  Every time the 
 beer is agitated in the brewing process, some of that foaming potential is 
 used up.  Excessive foaming in the brewery leads to a beer with an anemic, 
 rapidly collapsing head.> 
 
 Guy Hagner agreed: 
 
 <<It has been my understanding that head is formed by medium sized 
 peptides.  I had always figured that as long as the peptides fell back into 
 solution the head forming ability would be retained.  But your reply 
 indicates that many of the peptides are being broken in the head forming 
 reaction.  This also makes good sense now that I think about (it is exactly 
 analgous to overwhipping egg whites).>> 
 
 And our brewing experience tells of the beer that carbonates well at a 
 certain pressure while another won't.  Simple deduction over time would 
 lead one to suspect the OG of the beer and hence (indirectly) the amount of 
 protiens. 
 
 And finally, it isn't even necessary -- the same results can be had with a 
 couple days more time -- so why even consider doing it? 
 
 Hope this makes sense.

Subject: Malting,pts/lb/gal,trub, filtering, fining, keeping beer


>From *Jeff* Renner 
 
In view of the interest here recently on malting, let me point out two 
Zymurgy sources that I have used over the years for direction in malting 
wheat, though they are actually for barley.  The 1985 Special Grain Brewing 
Issue (8:4) contains a non technical "Primer on Malt by The Non-Technical 
Staff at Great Western Malt" that is a good general guide to malt, and "Home 
Malting for Homebrewers" by R.C.Dale, which is detailed and specific, and 
includes Dale's malting cabinet/kiln.  The whole issue contains many good 
articles on grain brewing.  I think this it is still available from AHA. 
 
Mark Alston points out that he gets better extract by slowing his sparge 
rate down to a gallon/15 minutes, while I suggested 5-6 minutes/gallon 
maximum.  I think it's a question of how much time one has to devote to 
sparging.  I generally pull 9-10 gallons for 7-1/2 brew, so that's a lot of 
extra time.  My efficiency is around 30p/lb/g, where Mark's is around 35.  I 
use an insulated and caulked Zapap, and used to get around 33 when I used a 
Corona Mill, but I sometimes had to wait to let the sparge flow.  Now, using 
a MM(tm!) roller mill, I have to keep the outlet turncock at about one half. 
 I'm sure that both a slower sparge and finer grind would improve the 
efficiency, and I'm still considering how or if to adjust the roller 
settings.  I use a friend's, so it's not that easy.  Sorry, Jack, I know I 
should buy one of my own. %^)  It's a series of trade offs that I still 
haven't decided on. 
 
Speaking of points/lb/gallon, Larry Kelly asks when to figure this, in the 
boiler or in the fermenter.  I take at the fermenter.  This, of course, 
lowers my value.  I always lose a fair amount from my early estimate when 
the boiler if full after the sparge (I do cool my sample).  I would guess 
that most of this is due to loss in hops and trub.  However, you report 29 
at the beginning of the boil, 26 at the end, and 20 after dilution.  
Something here isn't right, and I don't think it is all due to the lack of 
linearity when diluting.  Someone else (Martin Manning?) needs to help on 
this. 
 
Speaking of trub, Larry also asks what the chunky stuff is that settles out 
in his primary.  That, Larry, is cold break, which, with hot break, is 
coagulated and precipitated protein collectively called trub.  Hot break 
should be left behind in the boiler but some cold break is actually 
beneficial for the early yeast growth.  Miller suggests you remove it after 
an initial settling period (like overnight), and Papazian says remove it if 
it bothers you.  I usually don't bother.  I'd be leery of using a sponge 
aquarium filter because I don't know what's in it.  I do filter the last of 
my wort of hot break.  I "whirlpool" in the boiler before using my counter 
current cooler, then take the last one or two quarts that I can't run off 
cleanly and filter it (now cool, so no HSA) through a square of clean cloth 
tied over a food grade plastic bucket.  I sometimes even squeeze the last 
part.  Then I reboil and cool it and add it to the fermenter.  I used to let 
it settle in a jar in the fridge overnight as some author recommended, but 
find this is better. 
 
Larry also wonders what the proper amount of sparge water is.  I generally 
prepare about as much as the final volume I want.  Then I usually have 
enough to keep sparging until the pH rises up toward 6 and/or the SG drops 
below 1.005-008.  If your efficiency was better that day than expected, the 
extra bitter wort that doesn't fit in the fermenter can be saved for priming 
or a starter.  Or, you can make a little stronger beer than you figured and 
dilute it later. 
 
Another question Larry has is about fining agents.  I like gelatin, although 
isinglass has intrigued me.  At racking (either into a secondary or 
tertiary), I mix a 1/4 oz packet (unflavored!) in a half cup or so of cold 
water, then raise the temp (nuking works well) until it becomes clear - 
don't boil, it breaks it down and it's useless.  Then I siphon a bit of beer 
into the mix and siphon it to the new container, making sure it's well 
distributed.  It usually drops clear within a day or two.  Using this 
method, I can count on enough yeast for bottle conditioning, but with a 
yeast layer on the bottom of the bottle about the thickness of a coat of 
paint. 
 
Larry, with your inquisitive mind, it sounds like you'd really enjoy a good 
brewing book.  Check my note in HBD 1441 for recommendations. 
 
Phil Miller want to know how long a beer should last in the bottle and what 
he could add to his beer to make it last longer.  Phil, it's more what isn't 
in your beer - bacteria, wild yeast, oxidation.  Take care in your 
procedures and store cool or cold out of light, and it can last a long time. 
 Although lager are best fresh from lagering, ales can actually improve, 
especially strong ones.  I recently opened a 13 year old dark ale made with 
extract and *dextrose* (we didn't know so much back then) that was still in 
fine condition, although it had fermented out very dry and was highly 
carbonated. 
 
Eric Miller wonders about spoiled canned extract.  Phil, I've seen enough 
swollen cans to know it's possible, especially if the factory didn't process 
them right.  The older they get, the more chance they have of going off, and 
they certainly aren't going to improve.  I'd sure move that can from 85^F to 
a cooler place!

Has anyone come up with a formula regarding the relationship of the rise 
in Origial Gravity needed to balance a reduced amount of sparge water
to result in the same Original Gravity in a standard recipe?


I've got a pretty cheap source of grain, but during these summer months
my time is at a premium. I have been making some pretty high gravity 
brews which I have to boil down from 9 -10 gallons down to 5-6.


I'd like to cut down on the volume to boil by cutting my sparge back, but 
of course want to keep the gravity that the recipe calls for.


Help out a brewing buddy and get out the old slide rule!
