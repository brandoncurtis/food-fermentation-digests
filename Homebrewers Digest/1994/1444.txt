Subject: Aeration, how long is long enough?


Dear Homebrewers:


A couple of weeks ago I made a comment that an airpump/airstone would
oxygenate wort within 30 minutes.  I then recieved notes asking if I had
any proof and where did I get my values for oxygen saturation.  Well, these
comments sent me to the library, but my research schedual has postponed my
reply until now.  My comments were second hand from a colleague who 
worked with dissolved components in aqueous media (ie. stuff in water).


When I checked the library computer for articles on oxygenation, I was
surprized at the number of articles it found.  When I tracked down the
first couple, I found that they all dealt with the oxygenation of waste
water in treatment plants handling 100,000+ gallons per day.  I was
reluctant to report any of these results until I located articles that
correlated "bench top experiments" (under 20 gal.) to operating waste
water treatment plants.  Surprizingly, the rate of transfer does not
change upon upsizing, only the the volume of air required.


For those who are interested, the mass transfer equation is:


C(t) = C* - {(C* - Co) * exp[-KLa(t - t0)]}


C(t) is the oxygen concentration at time t (mg/L)
Co is the oxygen concentration at time t0 (mg/L)
C* is the oxygen saturation level at the test temperature (mg/L)
KLa is the mass transfer coefficient (per hour)
t0 is the initial time point, usually 0 (hours)
t is the time when C(t) is measured (hours)
exp is the exponent base e


The volume and density of the liquid do not effect the rate!  The density
does not even effect the oxygen saturation level.  The five values for fine
bubble aeration KLa varied from 6.3 to 13.8 per hour in the four articles I
ended up using.  The average was 10.3 per hour.  (The articles also listed 
the KLa values for coarse/big bubble and surface aeration, but I did not 
include them in my average.)


>From a colleague's Dissolved Oxygen Meter, the oxygen saturation values are:


  DO        temp
(mg/L)  deg.C. deg.F.
 9.07    20     68
 8.24    25     77
 7.54    30     86
 6.93    35     95


These values are for water in equilibrium with air at one atmosphere.  
The units of mg/L are the same as ppm (parts per million).


Lets look at a practical example.  Starting with boiled wort, which is
deoxygenated (Co = 0 mg/L), that has been cooled to 70.deg.F (C* = 9 mg/L)
and a tranfer coefficient as described above (KLa = 10 per hour), I get
the following results (and a crude ASCII graph):


     DO      time
mg/L  % sat. min.  
  1    11    0.71    9|                *(8.5)    *(8.9)       *(8.99) 
  2    22    1.51    8|            *(8.0)
  3    33    2.43  m 7|        *
  4    44    3.53  g 6|      *
  5    56    4.87  / 5|     *
  6    67    6.59  L 4|   *
  7    78    9.02    3|  *
  8    89    13.2    2| *
  8.5  94    17.3    1|*
  8.9  99.0  27.0    0*________________________________________
  8.95 99.5  31.2     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
  8.99 99.9  40.8     0    5    10   15   20   25   30   35   40 min.


One final note.  In going from tap water to sludge, the saturation level
does not change, only the "effective transfer rate".  The coefficient KLa
becomes alpha * KLa, where alpha varies from 0.6 to 1.0 The actual value
for alpha is determined by compairing the tapwater oxygen transfer rate to
the sludge transfer rate.  Remember that sludge contains lots of
undissolved materials.  I think wort is closer to water than it is to
sludge! 


For the example above, if alpha = 0.8, the KLa becomes: 0.8 * 10 per hour
= 8 per hour. The time for 0 to 8.9 mg/L (99% sat.) would increase from
27.0 min. to 33.8 min.

Subject: "Alt" yeast question




I have read HBD opinion which says that the Wyeast "European" (I forget the 
number) is an "alt" yeast, but I have also read, I think in a mail-order 
catalogue, or perhaps even the Wyeast "Yeast Profiles" sheet, that the 
"German" (1009 I think?) is in fact "the" "alt" yeast.


I have not tried the "European" meself, but I made an extract+specialties 
brew loosely based on Papazian's guidelines for an Altbier in that nifty 
little chart he has, and it's one of the best brews I've made!


At any rate, I'd like to invite some more discussion on this:  will the real 
Altyeast please stand up?

I'd like to add another book to Jeff's list:


Randy Mosher's new Brewing Companion, published by Alephenalia Press,
1994.  It's much more in the nature of a reference manual than a
narrative introduction to brewing.  But, it incorporates dozens of
useful tables and charts, has several kinds pages for recording your
brewing sessions and recipes -- lots of "blank" (that is, not filled
in) pages in the book, or you can make copies and put them in a
binder.  It's got chapters on basic brewing, ingredients, recipe
design, styles, etc.  And it's visually exciting (as you might expect,
given Randy's background as a graphic artist).


10 years in the making, and it shows.  Unfortunately, it's also got a
bunch of (mostly just annoying) typos.  List price is $19.95

Subject: Caledonian Bottles


Philip Proefrock asks if there are more suitable bottles for homebrew 
than Caledonian Brewery bottles.  He says that the Caley bottles have a 
lip that prevents the bottler from getting a grip.  I have bottled about 
75 L in Caley bottles with no problems.  I used a two handed lever 
capper, which while not a bench capper, seemed to work fine.  It didn't 
cost much either.  I know that St Andrew's Ale (as it is sold in the 
States) comes in 12oz bottles, whereas Caledonian 80/, 70/, & Golden 
Promise (their organic beer) come in pint/20 oz/500ml bottles.  Maybe the 
larger bottles are a different design.  Now that I live in Australia I no 
longer have access to Caledonian bottles, but I can recomend them to 
anyone who does.  It is well worth experimenting with different cappers 
to find one that is compatible, because while Caley bottles may not be 
the most fun to fill, they are certainly loads of fun to empty.  :-)
Happy Bottling

Subject: Contamination?




I am a relative novice at brewing, and was wondering about contmination 
during the process.  My first batch went well, but my second batch had a
few bottles that really foamed up, and I'm wondering if it was caused by
contamination.  Does anyone know if that is a symptom, and, if so, what
I can do to keep it from happening again?

Ale yeasts find cold temperatures more hostile than lager strains.  So, when 
placed in this condition, they try to kill others for the sake of living 
themselves.  When I say 'this condition' I mean cold conditioning.  Diacetyl 
rests as a warm condition is only for max 5 days, at cool temperatures also.  


Chill your lager.  That's what lagering is - cold aging/conditioning.


Cheers.

Which amylase is it?  Alpha or beta?  Make sure you know which one.  Read up on 
both of them in Papazian.  Use the same temperatures.  Use about 20 ppm.  If 
you're using flaked maize, you don't need to boil.  If you're using maize 
grits, then you have to cook.  Cook grits for 20 minutes at boiling temps, with 
a little bit of 2-row to keep it from turning into a solid lump.  Add to the 
rest of the mash, then add amylases.


You should rely on your malt for enzymes.  Use a maximum of 35% flaked maize.


Cheerio.

Always try to maximize cold break, by rehydrating and adding Irish Moss before 
end of boil.  10 minutes should do, if rehydrated in water beforehand, say 
three hours before.


Keep it out of your fermenter.  Just do your best, with this matter.

They are all essentially the same type of barley (not variety though) and 
should be generally the same.  You're playing with malting practices, total 
nitrogen amounts, and more in depth things.  They will all work, but will 
change your product slightly.  Obviously, you'll use British malt for pale 
ales, if you can get some.  German and Eastern European malts will have malting 
and mashing problems, and are great for decoction mashes (which was the orignal 
way of using these malts).

Basically.

Not better, just different.  They all have their optimal uses, in different 
situations.  So, better per style, or utilization.  Major differences are 
malting quality, extraction rates, amounts of small starch granules...don't 
worry about it.  


What you could do to answer your own question is make three batches, each using 
one type.  Keep everything else the same.  Temperatures, volumes, times, pH and 
the like.  It could be great information.


Cheers.

Subject: Extractions rates, etc.


Hi y'all
 
I don't have one of those funky copy-and-snip email editors, so forgive me for 
poor style in this post.
        1)   Derek Sikes asked about his Unpale IPA from extract.  We tried 
making one of Charlie's Pils and it was <awful>.  If you want a pale ale, start
with a simple bitter, like Charlie's Righteous Real Ale.  It's also a good 
basic extract recipe for experimenting with hops, fruit, etc.
        2)   Ken R. wants to know about using twist-offs--- don't.  They can't 
handle the pressure. In an ideal world, you'd want lots of 'bar bottles', i.e.,
Bud longnecks.  The bottles they use for bars (refilled at least a few times)
are thicker than the regular storebought returnables (crushed, melted, and 
remade into bottles. It's amazing how wasteful we are!).  We use Sam Adams 
bottles (the thin ones) and haven't had any problems.   
        3)   Karl MacR wrote about making his stout 'stringer' (couldn't 
resist ;-))  We've used honey to boost alcolhol content in a couple of dark 
brews.  It ferments out VERY thoroughly, but can give a 'honey bite' flavor
when its still young or if you use too much.  Stick with a pound or so for a 
5 gal batch until you get a feel for the flavor.
        4)    And now the real reason I'm writing this-- extraction rates.
We made an oatmeal porter the other day, and I figured our final extraction 
rate at 23 pts/#/gal.  Yuck. I think it's because we have an uninsulated Zapap
lauter tun that radiates heat.  I stuck the floating thermometer in the tun to
monitor its temp, to see if it stayed around 168 degrees as we sparged. No way.
It dropped down to 150 or so within 20 min., so we started heating our sparge 
water up to 200 degrees to compensate (yeah, we know, tannins, etc.  At least 
its a porter, that'll hide a bit of that flavor).  No dice;  could'nt get the 
temp above 165.  Putting the lid on the buckets helped, but I'm still a tad
frustrated with this low temp-low extraction thing.  Jeff Renner wrote that
he has a 'insulated and caulked' Zapap.  Huh?  How do you clean it? What's it 
look like, etc.?  
        The lesson we learned with this porter-- we're going to follow the SG, 
not the recipe.  That is, we diluted our wort (with 1 gal) in the fermenter to
top it up to 5.5 gal, and THEN took the SG. Mistake.  We had diluted it down 
to 1.037, a bit below the 1.045 or so we wanted for the 'style'. If we had just
gone with a 4.5 gal batch, we wouldn't have had to add 1 # dried extract to 
boost the SG.


Thanks for coping with a long and rambly post.  Any opinions on improving 
the Zapap would be HIGHLY appreciated.


Have a good day, y'all.

Subject:  Hop utilization questioned


        I have to take exception to the hop utilization vs gravity published in
        the HBD recently.  I recently made two identical IPAs with the
        exception that the second batch I only boiled the hops and added the
        extract to the hot water after the hops were strained out.  I did this
        to compare results.  The second brew was extremely bitter compared to
        the first.  Both used 1.5 oz of Norther Brewer, 7.5% AA. in a 1.052
        ale.  I can't compare taste because of the bitterness difference but
        clarity and color are the same and the second batch had a rockier head.
        I've since made a brown ale, same OG using 3/4 oz of NB boiled without
        the malt for 60 min and bitterness is comparable to my first IPA.  This
        turned out to be one of my best in 28 batches.  I seem to remember
        someone (Glen Tinseth ?) getting hop utilizations of 46% when boiled in
        plain water. This figure more approxamates my taste results.  Besides
        higher utilization of hops, there is no boil-over or break mat'l to
        worry about when the malt isn't boiled; are there disadvantages ?

I imply from this that you are expecting a straw yellow color such as found in
BudMillerCoors.  An IPA ought to be a nice deep copper color.  You mention that
you have made some bitters, and an IPA should be a slightly stronger version of
a bitter.  Your S.G. of 1.040 sounds about right for an extract version.  You
don't mention what your hop rates were, but this sounds like it should be a nice
beer when it's done.

Subject: Quality Vienna Malts


Ireks of Germany makes a fine undermodified Vienna malt that has sufficent 
enzymes to convert itself and can be used as the base malt in Vienna and 
Fest beers.  
George Fix, in a previous HBD post, mentioned a less pricey quality German 
Pilsner malt from Durst, thay also make a Vienna Malt.  These are more 
modified than the Ireks.
The DeWolf/Cosyns Belgian malts Pilsner and Munich (only 7L) are high 
quality highly modified malts.  The only issue with the Belgian malts is 
they have a lower level of SMM, a precursor of components that produce 
malty flavor, than the German malts.
The D/C crystal malts were very well reviewed by Doctor Fix in his article 
on Belgian Malts in one of the early issues of Brewing Techniques.  He 
particularly liked the Caramel Vienna malt.  The article additionally 
included updates for the Vienna beer recipes published in the Fix's 
beer styles book.

No problemo.  Kettle salts are allowed by rein..since the water has these
materials occuring naturally.  Through the normal warped logic, if it 
occurs naturally, you can add a few hundred times the amount and still
be "pure"! So, go ahead and add Gypsum or chlorides.

I fail to see the relationship between advocating increased tannin extraction
and European rodents jumping into the sea!  Its hardly on the cutting edge
of brewing science to realize that sparge waters above 180F increase tannin
extraction, see DeClerc, or Hough et. al.  I suspect good coverage of this 
is also found in Miller and Noonan.  How making beers that are more astringent
is advancing the hobby is beyond me.

Now just what the 'ell does this mean, anyway!  Where is this mysterious

place, and leaching of tannins).  Or is this "sparge bowl" some amazing 
heat sink whereby water drops precipitously from 212F to 176F!  I mean, whats
35F difference between friends??  And I thought one of the "wonders" of 
kettle mashing is the ease of a mash off, ending in a tun at 170F.  If the

Wrong again, Don.  If you use sparge water above 180F, you are going to 
increase the tannins extracted.  I also use a kettle to mash in and a 
"kettle" to lauter in .  I can assure you it is better to sparge with 
170F water than with 190F.

Isn't there a malt FAQ somewhere?  I remember it being put together a

Interesting that your local store carries a good selection, and hasn't
the faintest idea why.  The short answer is: THEY ARE WRONG!!!  Malts
originating from the US, Belgium, Germany and England are quite
different from one another, as they should be.  Brewers in different
countries make different sorts of beers, have different requirements for
those beers and different expectations of their malt.


I *think* this is addressed in the malt FAQ.  If not, it should be.


Another, highly-prejudiced short answer: the specialty malts (caramel,
etc.) from Europe (Belgium, especially) are superior to those produced
in the U.S.  They are made from better barley and are made through
better processes (I said I was prejudiced!).  To my thinking, the malts
from Belgium's DeWolf-Cosyns are the finest in the world.


If, in fact, you can buy these for a few cents a pound more than
domestic, DO IT!!

On the brighter side, he says:


    Dry malt extract will show deterioration by absorbing moisture from
    the air and hardening.  I have seen it keep for a year when stored in
    a very dry room packed in a double layer of airtight plastic.

Subject: Attention Mathematicians!


Here's a table I use to for making high gravity beers from
first-runnings, only.  I then sparge second runnings to make a weaker
beer from the remaining extract.  The method is this: mash with the
specified water-grain ratio, then drain the bed dry.  Use these "first
runnings" for your strong beer.  You can sparge as fast as it will go,
because if your mash is properly mixed, the sugar in the liquor and in
the grain are in equilibrium, so no extra sugars will be extracted by
going slowly.


How to read the table: the first column is quarts of water per pound
of grain.  The second is the specific gravity of the run-off in
"points" (e.g. 105 means 1.105).  The third column is quarts of
run-off collected per pound.  The final column is your extract
efficiency in pt-lb/gallon.  These are pre-boil figures, so if you
boil down from 6 to 5 gallons, you'll get another 15% or so (e.g.,
1.105 -> 1.120, which I actually got in my most recent "bombastic beer"
attempt). 


        qt/lb        SG        collect        extract
        1        105         .4        10
        1.25         90         .65        15
        1.5         80         .9        18
        2         60        1.4        21


These numbers work for my system, and were determined by experiment.
Your mileage may (will?) vary.  I'm assuming that each pound of wet
grain absorbs .6 quarts of water.  A recent article in Brewing
Techniques gave a figure of .4 qt/lb, which would obviously increase
the amount of run-off (and would improve the efficiency).

My standard practice is to assess extract efficiency at the end of the
sparge, and armed with this information, adjust the boil time to hit target
gravity. A good approximation of the change in SG over the boil (or for
dilution) is that the ratio of SG points (start/finish) is equal to the
volume ratio (finish/start). I consider losses due to hops and trub  to cause
a reduction in the available final volume, and these usually cost 2-3% (of
the final volume). 


I do not worry about any changes in SG due to trub formation, or the change
in wort volume due to the spent hops. In spite of this, the change in gravity
from the start of the boil to the end seems, as near as I can measure, to
follow the (constant extract) SG-volume relationship previously stated. Since
the final volume I measure includes the displaced volume of the hops and
trub, and is therefore a bit high, I would guess that the effects of hop
volume and trub formation are off-setting. 


A 10% change in extract, as in going from 29 to 26 pt/lb/gal, seems out of
line, and I would suspect some sort of measurement error. Consider these:


The measured volume of wort in the kettle must be corrected to the same
reference temperature as the SG; a 4% adjustment if you measure volume at
boiling and correct to 60 degrees F! 


The run-off must be well mixed prior to taking an SG reading, and failure to
do this can give huge errors. 


I find the typical amateur brewer's hydrometer, with 0.002 calibrations, very
difficult to read, and each 0.001 error here (1.050 wort) will cause a 2%
change in calculated extract.

The problem is not in your recipe but in your expectations of what a "pale
ale" should look like. An IPA is pale by the standards of 18th century
England, when porters were the standard drink. Thus an IPA should be amber
to deep copper in color, which hardly seems "pale" to Americans weaned on
piss-yellow lagers!


It is also true that beer looks a lot darker in the carboy than in your
glass. This is just a function of amount of liquid the light must pass
through.


Does Charlie really expect you to get 1.070 from 7# of extract in 5 gal?
1.040 sounds closer to reality. Go for 10# next time, and consider adding
some bittering and flavoring hops if you aren't already doing so.

This is not 100% brewing related, but I don't know where else to ask this so
I'll keep it short and simple.


A couple of months ago I bought a used frost free refrigerator for lagering.
The refrigerator is about 8 years old and sits in our garage (hooked up to
a Hunter Airstat).  When I first bought it, everything worked fine (I used
the internal thermostat to get down to about 35F).  However, temperatures here
in Georgia have been getting hotter and hotter lately, and the humidity has
increased significantly, to the point that the garage can get up to 100F
during the day.  As a result, my refrigerator is working full-time just getting
down to around 55F.


Am I simply asking too much of this poor beat-up appliance?  Should a 'working'
refrigerator be able to handle conditions like that?  Would it be possible
to get a refrigerator that could maintain 35F when the room temperature is
around 100F and humid?  Should I just sell the thing and buy a smaller 
refrigerator that I can store in a closet inside my house?


Thanks in advance for any assistance.

The last few brews I have made have developed rings around the bottle neck
where the beer meets the glass.  According to various sources, this is a
sure sign of infection.  However, all of the beers are crystal clear and
delicious, even after a few months.  Can this effect occur without there
being an infection?  The only correlation I have is that these beers were
made in much warmer conditions (10 degrees higher than non-ringed beers).

Can anybody explain the benefits of the "Power Sparger"?  The author

ability to save time (i.e. you can force more sparge water through in a
shorter amount of time).


I use a copper manifold in a cooler, and I have to slow down the
speed at which I can draw sweet liquor off(I use a valve on the output side).
 -IF- I wanted my sparges to go faster I would leave the valve wide open.


Can somebody explain what I missed?  Is the author implying better
extraction in a shorter time(which would be a benefit)? Or is he merely
showing a way to decrease the sparge time (which to me would be at the
expense of extraction, which is not a real benefit)?

Derek Sikes asked about getting a light color beer (paleer pale ale).
This is quite difficult to do with extracts unless you go to a full 5 gallon
boil and use the palest of extracts such as Alexander's or William's pale
extracts.  The canning process itself would most likely tend to darken
extracts and carmelization tends to occur if you don't do a full 5 gallon
boil


Karl MacRae asks about getting a higher strength beer without sweetness.
 Honey is probably the best way to do since it does not give a cidery flavor.
 However, you must choose the blandest honey (clover?) you can find or you
will add other flavors.
