Subject: Vienna & Munich malts, HSA and shaking, Reinheitsgebot and salts


>From *Jeff* Renner 
 
Several related thoughts.  Davin Lim asks about the quality of Munich and 
Vienna malts as compared to when George & Laurie Fix reported in their book 
on Vienna beers.  George reported favorably on the Belgian versions in a 
recent Brewing Techniques, and I have seen the protein analyses of the 
German Durst malts, and they are the same as for their Pils malts, under 10% 
as I recall, but at any rate, very good.  I have brewed with both, and was 
very happy with a low gravity (1.040) American red lager that was all Munich 
with a little crystal.  However, that is the one that I recently reported 
self-destructed after 2 months on tap from oxidation.  An identical brew 
last year showed no problems, but it was gone in a month.  A 1.050 Vienna 
made with all Vienna and a little crystal never quite pleased me as it had a 
bit of harshness and hotness to it, in spite of being fermented at 48^F.  I 
entered it in the nationals for feedback, and it scored 31.5 in Chicago, 
about right, I think, and one judge thought there was a fruitiness 
indicating high fermentation temperature.  I think the slight harshness may 
be incipient oxidation like the all Munich beer. 
 
Here's where I think the problems may lie.  First, I shook carbonated both 
of these beers, something I only started doing this past year.  In 15 years 
of kegging with either priming or slow force carbonation, I've never had 
oxidation before.  The Munich was in a Cornelius, which was easier to shake 
hard than the Vienna, which was in a Sankey (someday I'll post how to easily 
seal a Sankey).  In view of the recent postings here on shaken beers, I 
think I'll stop doing that.  I haven't noticed a head retention problem, but 
this oxidation is new. 
 
Second, even though I have filtered out trub and hop pellet particles from 
the cool last wort for years and reboiled them, as I reported in HBD 1443, 
perhaps I only got away with this because I didn't mistreat the beer 
afterwards.  It seems possible that the cool wort would harmlessly pick up 
O2, which would then be driven off during heating and be available for HSA.  
Any ideas?  I'll be more careful when filtering to avoid unnecessary 
aeration.  
 
I think the Munich and Vienna malts hold promise.  After all, they were 
originally the malts developed for use with the waters of those cities and I 
believe were used for the entire grain bill. 
 
Recent comment here about the cost and sanitation problems of Polyclar 
notwithstanding, it removes the oxidized polymerized polyphenols that Miller 
says are often present in high levels in homebrew (see Miller, CHHB, Ch. 28). 
 
Bob Jones asks how water salts fit in with Dennis Lewis's report of their 
use by Spaten Brewery and the Reinheitsgebot that should tickle the spell 
check).  Even though a recent article (Brewing Techniques I think, but maybe 
Zymurgy) said that salts were forbidden, a subsequent correction said that a 
few were permitted - gypsum, CaCl2 and maybe a few others, but not acids 
like phosphoric and lactic.

Subject: A few stainless steel questions...


OK, here's a question (or ten) for the assembled knowledge of the HBD --


I have been building a 3-vessel all-grain setup for the last month or so.
It will look something like this:


     |   |    |     |
     |   |    |     |
     | A |    |  B  |
     |   |====|     |======
     -----    -------     |
=======================|  |  |
   |                |  |  |  |
   |                |  |  C  |
   |                |  |     |
   |                |  -------
   |                |  ==||==


OK, as you can see, two vessels are going to sit on a table, and one on the
ground.  (Flames to alt.ascii-art)  A is the sparge water tank with an 
electric element inside.  B is the mash tun, and C is the boiler.  I do 
infusion mashes, so there's no heat for B.  OK, so I have (or will have)
1/2" ID Stainless pipes fitted into both tank A, B, and C.  A and B will
have a pump connecting them.  So, I will fit ball valves to each of these
beasts.  Now for the real questions --


1.  What comes after the ball valve?  I want to use some kind of flexible
tubing (like the braided PVC stuff that's resistant to 200 F).  How should
I connect the ball valve to the tube?  Can I use plastic fittings?


2.  I haven't purchased the ball valves yet, and some guys in my homebrew
club swear by the brass ones that they get at Home Depot (no affiliation,
etc. etc.).  Are these kosher?  What, if anything, should I specifically
look out for when buying one of these things?  I realize that the stainless
ones are great and all, but this is a matter of $25 a piece versus $25 for
all three.  _BIG_ difference in my book.


3.  Is anyone else using a comparable setup (ie with a pump between sparge
and mash vessels)?  Want to trade notes?


4.  How do I clean the blackened areas of my vessels?  Ie once they've
been used on the burner, what do I do to clean them up?


As always, thanks in advance, my apologies if anyone thinks that this is
a waste  of space, and happy brewing!


P.S.  I plan to do some tests with my mash-tun.  First, I'm going to use
an Easy(tm)Mash(tm)er(tm) style setup, then I'm going to try a window-screen
false-bottom, then I'm going to try a perforated, SS sheet stock false
bottom, then I'm going to try a "refined" Easy(tm)Mash(tm)er(tm) setup.
I'll be posting some empirical results sometime in August or September
after I've made some serious beer...

Three thoughts:


1. The pale in Pale Ale was used relative to the dark brown ales and
   porters that were common in England.  The new "pale" ales at about
   8 - 10 degL  were not particularly light in color especially when
   compared to a modern lager (approx. 2 - 5 degL) but then there were
   no lagers in England at that time.  An IPA, because of it's usually
   longer boil times will be even a bit darker because of the additional
   caramelization.  


2. It always looks MUCH darker in the carboy than it does in the glass!
   I kegged an IPA last night and in the carboy it looked a lot like
   my last porter.  In the hydrometer cylinder it had a medium bronze
   color.  A bit dark, but expected, as I overdid the crystal, but not
   excessive for the style.


3. When boiling the wort, partiularly a high gravity wort, you have to
   careful not to scorch the wort at the bottom of the pot.  To a
   certain extent this is unavoidable with our direct fired kettles,
   but if you make sure that your wort is well mixed before applying
   heat and keep stirring you can minimize it.  Partial boils will


If you want a "piss-yellow", high gravity, pale ale (probably too light
to be called an IPA) I would skip the IPA extract and just use more of
the pale malt extract.

Has anyone had any experience with the "Checker" pH meter that American
Brewmaster sells via Zymurgy?  The price seems remarkably low compared to
other meters on the market, which tend to run in the $60-80 range.  What's

Just returned from my whirlwind tour of Eastern europe. (had 65 e-mail
messages waiting for me).


Stopped off in Nuremburg, then Prague, then Rocklaw (Poland), then Warsaw,
down to Vienna, over to Salzburg and back to Frankfurt.


My they sure do make those beers different over there. Of course had the
Pilsner Urquell, stopped in at U Flecku in Prague and sampled the two
Polish beers that were supossed to be half decent (Okecim was one, I can't
remember the other).


Suprising thing is that most places didn't have a lot of different beers on
tap. Mostly it was either light or dark (not that I'm complaining or
anything.)


Traveled with an Irishman. We managed to find a British pub, a Scottish
pub and, low and behold, an Irish pub in Wrocklaw in Poland. Maybe it
was just me, but the Guiness there sure tasted a lot better. Held a really
good head, too.


Lost my phrasebook. Good thing that the word for beer is the same in
Polish as it is in Czech.

From: robinson`at`orbit.acrso.ns.ca (John Robinson)
Subject: Autolysis Correction


My appologies folks.  When I posted previously about autolysis
you should read Eric Warner for Terry Foster and Weizen for
Porter. :)  ]


Werner states (on page 80) "Top fermenting yeast also tends to
autolyze quicker than bottom fermenting yeast, and so affects the
flavor stability of Weissbiers that are distributed over a large
area or stored for long periods of time."  


So much for quoting from memory! :) 


I'm not sure I know how to interpret this passage.  First of
all, my experience would seem to contradict this on the surface.
That is, in my experience, at room temperature (20C), lager yeast 
is more prone to autolysis than ale yeast.


If one were to compare them both at their respective 'optimal'
temperatures, I would expect, intuitively, that the tendancy
would be about the same for both strains.


Miller warns of autolysis (repeatedly) in general, but only
talks about lagers specifically.  On page 166 he says: "A final
point about repitching is that you need to be especially wary of
autolysis.  Because of the greater accumultion of yeast on the
bottom of the fermenter, I rack my repitched lagers as soon as
the bubbling interval reaches 30 seconds, rather than the usual
60."


So what does the collective wisdom say?  Did Eric Warner err in
his statement?  I know many Weizen's are bottled with a bottom
fermenting yeast, but I had always thought this was to prevent
the continued slow development of those compounds (like 4 vinyl
guiacol) which make a Weizen a Weizen so that they did not
completely overwhelm the flavor of the beer.  Admitedly, I drew 
this conclusion on my own, as I could think of no other reasonable 
explanations.


Miller does have one additional passage that may be apropos
here from page 157:


"The danger at this stage is *autolysis*.  This is a last-ditch
measure in which the yeast cells excrete proteolytic enzymes and
feed on one another in an attempt to survive.  The result is
often a rotten, rubber stench in the beer.  Of course, autolysis
does not begin immediately, or all at once.  Much depends on the
strain of yheast, its health and stability and the temperature:
as with all metabolic processes, the warmer the medium, the
faster autolysis sets in."


>From this I draw two conclusions: 1) Perhaps typical Weizen
yeasts are of a strain that is more prone to autolysis and 2) in
general, given the temperature dependent nature of autolysis, I
would intuitively think that lager yeasts would be more prone to
it, as they have a higher metabolism at a lower temperature than
their ale counterparts.

FYI, tips like this *do* have a basis in brewing science. If you are like
many HBers your lautertun may not be well insulated (zap-zap or Phil's for
instance). If you sparge with 170F H2O your grain-bed (what's it called
again?) will be lower in temperature, say as low as 150F (I have measured
this - who else has?). This can occur over a long sparge, even with mashout.
This affects extraction efficiency. If I want high extraction I sometimes 
sparge with 200F+ H2O, making sure the very top of the bed does not exceed
175F. This ensures the rest of the grist (is that what it's called?)
will also be below this figure. Most heat loss occurs from the top, but
you can easily monitor the internal temperature. This temperature is easily
achieved by controlling flow rates. Heat is lost by your sparge water in 
the sparge plumbing. If you use this technique the grain does not rise 
above the magic 175F mark and tannins will not be overly noticable in 
your beer. (I say overly because some are always present no matter how
you do it!)
This technique is also useful if you want to minimise HSA. You can
infusion mash and sparge in the same vessel thus avoiding the transfer
process. The hot sparge water raises your mash temp (eg 151F) to mash
out temp. Why is this inferior to infusing boiling water for mash out
or even heating with an element? It is certainly easier, and preferable
to transferring hot grain around the place.


A variation on this technique is not to sparge at all (as recommended
by George Fix in Zymurgy Winter 1992)! 
Think about it. Why sparge? Commercial breweries sparge for economic
reasons. The HBer generally brews to make good beer. Eliminating
sparging produces cleaner beer, via a simpler process for marginal
extra cost. 
Here's how. What I describe is really a "batch sparge".
Using your boiling "sparge water", infuse into your mash at 151F
to mashout (170F) (be careful to avoid hot spots). This is necessary
to avoid a stuck runoff (especially when adjuncts are used such as 
wheat, oats etc.). You need to calculate how much water to add using
basic thermodynamics, or Papazian's tables. Alternatively boil more
water than you could possibly need and infuse it until the desired
temperature  is reached.
 Then drain the whole lot into your boiler (slowly) and forget about
sparging. I think this requires a large, insulated cooler. I use a 10
gallon Igloo with Phil's false bottom and it works fine. It saves a lot 
of work (sparging) and produces cleaner beer (10 to 100 times less 
phenols according to Dr. Fix).My efficiency has dropped from 82% to 68%. 
Therefore I need about 14% more grain for the same beer. This works out 
at about 1.5lbs for my average beer (<$1 at my prices). Australian malt 
is 2 row lager type and well modified, thus very suitable
for infusion mashes. I sometimes combine this with a protein rest in the
same vessel when using adjuncts.


I really only revert to the hot sparge when brewing 10 gallon batches.
The 10 gallon bucket is then not large enough to cope with all the
extra grain, making sparging essential. The "batch sparge" (really just
mashout infusion) should be used with an insulated lautertun, but the 
hot sparge can be used with any type. Just watch the top-of-the-bed
temperature! This may be why the books do not mention this, as        it is
possible to stuff-up if you let the water run too quickly.


Flames encouraged!

I had the same problem as 'Fizzled out'. Adding Champagne Yeast to Root
Beer makes something other than Root Beer. Like Yeasty root Beer.
My solution was to take a 1.5 Liter Warsteiner Keg and adding a chrome tire
valve to the top. I then adapt a tire chuck to my CO2 tank. After putting
the root beer in the keg, I carbonate with CO2 through the tire valve. Shaking
like a madman.
Dispense with either a pump or CO2 dispenser.
Now on to Guava/Mango/Pinapple/ ????? carbonated drinks. 
Partial fermentations, too.... ????????

Is liquid rice malt extract available in the USA? If so, has anyone tried 
using
it in place of rice in light beers?
I have seen the stuff in health food shops over here (when buying other
brewing ingredients of course (8^]) - they're a great source for all kinds
of stuff and cheaper than homebrew shops) and often wondered what
it is like. It looks just like very pale liquid malt extract.

Hiya,


Well, I'm in the process of gearing up for my first brewing
attempt.  I have been reading Papazian's book and it sounds
pretty straight forward.  The question I have is: Would it
be a bad idea to keg your first brew attempt.  Because I
have a qtr. keg (7.75 gal) and it seems as if it would
be much easier to keg than bottle.  The only problem is
that in papazian's book, He shows a keg with a plug on the
side.  But my keg only has only opening for the tap and no
other holes.  So how would I clean it, and how would I fill
it???  Any comments, suggestions, and the like would be 
appreciated....Also thanks to those who gave me book 
recomendations.

Once upon a time I was told it was to keep flies out of the beer.  


And now for something completely different...


A couple of years ago I brewed a batch of Papazian's Holiday Cheer and 
was quite happy with it.  I intend to brew another batch soon but I want 
to get the body and alcohol content to an appropriate Christmas/winter 
level.  When I detailed my intentions to use 9.9 # of extract and 1-2 # 
of specialty grains in a 6 1/2-7 g. batch to a fellow brewer his comment was 
"oh, up there in the barley wine range".  So here's the dilemma:  I've 
read (Miller maybe?) that barley wines and other high gravity beers 
require at least one year of conditioning to be appreciated.  Will the 
10#/7g. ratio put me in the barley wine neighborhood and will I get away 
with 5 1/2 months of aging?  Final ?: what might be an appropriate yeast 
for (what I hope will be) a high alcohol beer like this.  Many TIA.

I find this very difficult to swallow.  When the temperature is dropped
below normal, in my understanding, ale yeast go dormant.  That is to
say, their metabolism slows down.  While they may autolyse eventually,
it would seem to me that it would take much longer to occur than for a
lager strain which would have a higher metabolic rate at the same temperature. 
I would be interested in any references you might have to back up this
assertion that ale yeasts autolyse more rapidly at lower temperatures.


> Chill your lager.  That's what lagering is - cold aging/conditioning.


Not sure what the purpose of this remark is.  I know what lagering is.
The lagers I tried to brew at around room temperature were not chilled
precisely because I didn't have any way to chill them.  Had I owned a
fridge for brewing at that time it would have been a simple matter but
alas such was not the case.

I have a question I hope some of you more advanced Brew Meisters can answer.


I have seem some All Grain beer recipes that really interest me, the only
problem is that they call for Larger yeasts.  I do not have the facilities
to larger a brew.


Is there a problem it I use all the recipes ingredients expect substitue an
ale type yeast instead of the larger yeast?


What ale type yeast should I use?


Also, If I was to use the larger yeast, but at ale yeast temps (65 or so
degress) what would be the down side?

Subject: Using Polyclar


I have read through many back issues of HBD on the use of Polyclar to help
reduce chill haze.  I have a couple of question I could not find in the
back issues.


Can Polyclar be used in any type of brew?  Most messages I saw in HBD
mentions people largering their brew, can Polyclar be used in Ales too?


Also since Polyclar is supposed to help bring suspended yeast to the bottom
on the fermenter, does this lower yeast content, when bottling, affect the
conditioning of the bottle beer? Does it take longer to carbonate, using
corn sugar, because of the lower yeast content?


Also should the amount of corn sugar, 3/4 cup to 5 gallons, remain the same
or should one increase the amount of sugar?

 >What do you know, I expect the Oracle to respond directly, but instead
 I get flamed by a Don Put <dput`at`csulb.edu>:
 
 It was clear from your remarks that it wasn't the article that bothered you 
 quite as much as the name of the author.  As Don pointed out, you obviously 
 "responded" without even taking the time to read it.
 
 There is not much more I need say but now that you have awakened the sleeping 
 tiger by tweeking his tounge with you finger, I might as well bite it off.
 
 <I just got done skimming this misinformation as printed in the latest
 issue of Brewing Techniques.  I got pretty peeved for two reasons, one
 is that "tips" like these have no basis in brewing science...
 
 Who called it "science"?  I was simply describing a simple process to make an 
 all grain batch with the least amount of equipment, hassle and science.
 
 > and are contrary to accepted practice....
 
 So, all magazine articles should be re-runs of everything considered 
 "accepted parctice".  No creativity, novel ideas; just what has already been 
 published by the experts and accepted.   Who the hell needs a magazine for 
 that?  Like the HBD, BT is an idea exchange.  If you don't like the idea, 
 don't use it.  If you can prove it is a bad idea, feel free.
 
 < especially with regard to increased leaching of tannins from the lauter 
 tun.
 
 I didn't say anything about "increased leaching of tannins", but you are free 
 to expound as you wish.
 
 <Im sure the "Oracle" has something silly to say about all of this.
 
 I think most will agree that you took care of the "something silly", I will 
 respond to the original question which I seem to have missed on the first 
 round.
 
 I know nothing about excessively hot sparge water other than what has been 
 stated repeatedly and I "accept" the caveat that it should not exceed 170F 
 with a major qualification.
 
 It has been my experience with kettle mashing and sparging that the rate of 
 heat loss through the surface and the kettle far exceeds the heat added by 
 sparging with boiling water.  The net result is that if you use boillng water 
 and sparge at a rate consistant with "accepted" practices, the actual mash 
 temperature will not even be 170F, let alone anything excessively higher.
 
 If you follow the "accepted" practice of using 170F water, the actual mash 
 temp will be on the order of 150F.
 
 I don't claim this to be a universal truth and it certainly does not apply to 
 insulated mash tuns but I was writing about a particular type of system and 
 what I said is how it works.
 
 Furthermore, the objective reader will recognize that I made no statement 
 that contradicts anything in the way of "accepted practices".  I simply 
 pointed out that one needs to make some temp measurements before blindly 
 using numbers that are "accepted" without understanding the basis for the 
 numbers.  The important consideration is mash temperature and not sparge 
 water temperature.
