Subject: Sparge Temperatures / turbid wort




Just wanted to add my $0.02 worth on sparge temperatures.  I have a number 
of batches under my belt with my new modified keg 3-vessel setup.  The first 
few times, I religiously kept the sparge tank in the 170 - 175 deg. range, 
and was puzzled by my long sparges and lower than expected extraction rates. 
 When I checked  the thermometer mounted in the mash/lauter tun, lo and 
behold it never got above 150 deg!
Now this could be one of two things.  Either it is simple thermodynamics (My 
mashes end up around 150-155, and I havn't been doing mash-outs), or Jack is 
right and we lose a lot more heat in the sparge plumbing and to evaporation 
than one would think.
I checked this in my last batch - raised the mash temp to 172, and sparged 
with water at 175 deg.  15 minutes into the sparge, the mash/lauter tun temp 
was 150 deg!
This boy is going to raise his sparge water temp significantly for the next 
batch.
Now the question.  This batch (my standard pale ale recipe), which is the 
first to get a mash-out, is the most turbid wort I have ever fermented! 
 There was a lot of cold break evident in the line from the wort chiller, 
but the line to the chiller was somewhat turbid, and it is usually crystal 
clear.  No big settlement of trub in primary.  It has been fermenting for 
four days now, and still looks like a block of alabaster.  Could the 
mash-out have caused this?  (Maybe I extracted some more starch from the 
grains?)
Gee, maybe I should pitch some Brett and see if I can get a pLambic out of 
it!
Thanks

Jim,


Could you please explain why tannins are not extracted when doing decoction
mashing which requires boiling of the grains and adding them back into the
mash.  As I understand it, tannin extraction is a function of temperature
and mash pH.  The lower the pH, the lower the tannin extraction. Thanks.
Don't want to part of a flaming, but this issue is important as most
home brewers would stay away from decoction mashing with your logic.

Subject:  bottle volume/priming rate


  Due to recent visits to Germany and an affinity for Tucher Bajuvator
available in Virginia, I have built a sizable collection of 0.5L returnable
bottles for homebrewing.  They reduce the tediousness of filling 48 12-oz
bottles per batch to a mere 34, reduce the number of trips to the fridge
for refills, yet the volume is still low enough that it's not too painfull
to give away samples to friends.  Besides, I'd do anything to feel an inch
closer to relaxing in a Bavarian Biergarten.


  That's my experience, now a question.


  The priming rate I've used for my all-grain beers (usually high gravity)
has been 1/2 to 3/4 cup corn sugar.  No problem carbonating at this level
except it's usually much too highly carbonated.  I'm aware that priming rates
should be reduced for kegging and wonder if this is true in going from a 
12 oz bottle to 0.5L (17 oz).  Intuitively, it doesn't seem logical that
the beer volume should affect the degree of carbonation.  Is there any
experience regarding bottle volume related to priming rate?

Johnson Controls makes an EXCELLENT controller that uses a solid state
thermocouple design.  This thing will go from -20F to 100F and supports both
heating and cooling applications!  It is a little more pricey than the hunter
at just less than $60 retail.  The Brewmiester in Cranford, NJ (1-800-322-3020)
can will sell these for $58.50 each.  I recommend this controller highly!  It
is TOTALY configurable, can work for heating or cooling, has an ajustable
"differential" (the amount the temperature may wander off the set point) from
1 to 20 degrees Fahrenheight!  It has C and F scales on the face, and can be
mounted hundreds of feet from the cooler.  In my use, it has been quite
accurate.  The only "catch" is that you'll need to get a short extension cord
and cut it in half.  Using a screwdriver you can wire the terminals to the
cord in about 5 minutes.  You end up with an extension cord with the controller
in the middle.  Then, just plug in anything, and you can turn it on or off
when it gets too hot or cold!  I don't have the model number off hand, but
the Brewmeister will know what I'm talking about.  Wiring is explained in simple
diagrams in the instruction booklet.  If you would even consider the rewiring
of the Hunter required for lagering (unmodified hunter only went down to 40F)
then this will be a breeze!

Subject: Mash Water Adjustments




  When I started all grain brewing, I was advised to add 1 teaspoon of gypsum
to my mash because it would help things along.  I am seeking the advice of the
HBD to better understand the purpose gypsum serves.  The label on my
gypsum container states that it is a water hardener.  I do understand the
importance of having an acidic PH 5.1 - 5.5 for mashing, but not sure why it is
advisable to add gypsum regardless of water PH or hardness.
     I feel it is important to understand the makeup of my water so I had an
analysis done.  The PH of 6.1 matched my litmus paper calculations.  I am not 
sure how to determine from the mineral analysis if my water is soft or very soft
Here is the analysis report.   I included the whole report since I am not sure 
which minerals determine hardness.  What the heck does MG/L or UG/L stand 
for?  Books I read referred to PPM.   Any advice on mashing adjustments I 
should make would be appreciated.

Subject: Racking wort to secondary in 8 hours?


I just finished reading Millers book: The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing


He mentions that the wort should be racked in the secondary fermenter 8
hours after racked into the primary.


WHY?? Doesn't that give a better chance to contaminate the wort?  Yes, I
know about trub build up, but if you pitch the yeast and the yeast finishes
in a few days and then rack into the secondary, a few days is no big deal.
So why does he say 8 hours?

I am contemplating using copper/brass fittings for my drain valve in my 
primary fermenter.  Does anyone have any experience with beer having 
prolonged exposure to copper/brass?  I do not want to spend the money 
if my beer is going to obtain off flavors from the metals.


I asked this before, but I received no response:  Does anyone have any

I was under the impression that the first was a success, but have heard

Subject: A Sticky Situation


The fridge conversion is almost done now (two faucets with the third on
backorder) and I have run into a minor problem.  Sometimes I won't have a
particular beer for a couple of days and in that time the faucet tends to
get all gummed up.  Basically, some of the beer will dry up which makes it
difficult to pour the next beer.


So does anyone have a nice simple solution or a nice simple solution that
takes care of this problem.  I don't want to detach the hose after each use
and drain the beer in the tube, which though effective, more or less defeats
the purpose of having a draft system.


Thanks for any help.

Here is my recipe for a Dunkelweizen
7 lb        Dark Wheat Malt
2.5 lb        Munich Malt
2 lb        Caravienna Malt
 .5 lb        Carapils Malt


1 oz        Hallertaur Hersb.(2.9 AAU) 60 m
1 oz        Tettnanger (6.2 AAU) 15m
1 oz        Hallertaur Hersb. (2.9 AAU) 1m


Single Step Infusion (no protein rest) at 158
Wyeast #3068
O.G. 1.052 T.G. 1010


I ended up repitching the yeast from a previous batch (Room-mates bavarian
weizen, D&M Brockington) and the yeast didn't create the banana & clove
taste, but the aroma was right on.  I think the yeast had just been used too
many times. 
The beer scored a 37 and NHC and a 30 at Heart of the Valley.  The NHC judges
thought I'd used chocolate malt to get the color, go figure.  I personally
think the color ended too dark.  Next time I'm going to try 3 lb Caravienna,
2 lb English Pale, and 7 lb Wheat.

Recipe makes 5 UK gallons


4lb                Dark Malt Extract
8oz                Crushed Roast Barley
8oz                Crushed Crystal Malt

2oz                Fuggles Hops (Bittering)
3oz                Black Tracle (Barrel priming)


Brew using your favourite technique for non-mashed beer and ferment with your

1-85249-113-2.


Recipe makes 23 litres


3.3kg                Dark Malt Extract
620g                Crushed Crystal Malt
120g                Black Malt
500g                Maltose Syrup
500g                Invert Sugar
30g                Challenger Hops (Bittering)
35g                Fuggles Hops (Bittering)
12g                Fuggles Hops (Aroma)


Brew using your favourite technique for non-mashed beer and ferment with your
favourite ale yeast.


I've left out specific brewing instructions as these are inevitably subject
to individual preferences. If anyone wants step-by-step instructions, email
me directly.


It is interesting to note that the 'original' Old Peculier was fermented in
Yorkshire stone squares, using a Northern England Ale Yeast which required
frequent rousing to keep the fermentation going. The 'peculier' attributes of
this type of yeast played a significant part in the overall flavour profile
of the beer. Following Scottish & Newcastle breweries' takeover of
Theakstons, 90% of O.P. now made is brewed by  in large stainless-steel
fermenters in Newcastle-on-Tyne, Northern England, using a more
general-purpose yeast. Thus much of the original flavour has, in my opinion,
been lost. BTW, Paul Theakston still brews in Masham (aptly named),
Yorkshire. His beer is called 'Black Sheep Ale' and is well worth seeking
out.


Wishing you many trubless worts.

Subject: Lids on steins


After seeing so many answers on the lid question I decided to get to the
bottom of it.  So, I called our office in Germany.  Our beer guy there said
the reason was just to keep it fresh.  Afterall, the steins are usually about
1 litre in size and it may take quite a while to drink.


However, this guy may not know the historical significance of the lids,
(flies??), so I suspect that the reason for the lids is a combination of
tradition and freshness.

Subject: My first all grain/raspbeery ale recipe/KitchenAid grain mill


Greetings to all in Homebrewland.  For those of you who have been 
following my first all-grain adventure, it was a huge success!!  To
recap, I made an all-grain golden ale with a minimum of extra expense.
It has now been in the bottle three weeks, and it is very good.  It
was also the cheapest (ie, least expensive) brew I've ever made.  I am
now hooked on all-grain.  For those of you on the edge on contemplation,
just do it.
        My first all-grain batch was made by borrowing a corona grain
mill from a buddy.  Because I want to continue the all-grain brewing,
I have been looking into inexpensive grain mills.  My wife and I
received a beautiful Kitchen Aid stand-up mixer as a wedding gift
last year, and I understand that a grain mill attachment is made
that is compatible with it.  The price I got from a local
distributer was about $180, but my Dad works in food service and
can get me one for $90.  Has anyone used this type of grain mill
set-up (either for homebrewing or anything else)?  Is it worth
the investment? I would appreciate hearing from anyone with
information regarding the Kitchen Aid grain mill.
        Due to many requests for my fruit beer recipe, I've
decided to post publicly.


                        Rick's Raspbeery Ale


Ingredients


1 can Alexander's Sun Country Pale Malt extract
2 lbs. light dry malt extract
0.5 lb crystal malt
2 ounces Cascade hops (45 minute boil)
0.5 ounce Cascade hops (finish)
5 lbs picked and frozen raspberries
YeastLabs Canadian Ale yeast starter
4 tablespoons pectic enzyme


Prepare yeast starter a day or two ahead of time.  
Steep crystal malt in two gallons of water, remove before boiling
commences.  Add malt extracts and boiling hops, boil for 45 minutes.
Add finishing hops, boil for 5 minutes.  Turn heat off and add
pureed raspberries.  Cover and let steep for 15-20 minutes.  Dump
everything into primary fermenter (after wort has cooled), bring
volume up to 5 gallons of water,  Dump in yeast.  Add pectic enzyme.
Go in primary for 4 days, transfer to secondary and bottle when
clear with 1 cup corn sugar.


The original gravity was 1.042, final was 1.010


The resulting brew was very tasty, with almost a pinkish head. It 
was tart, not overwhelmingly raspberry-ee.  


Several HBD 'ers have suggested adding 1/3 of the fruit to the
primary, and the other 2/3 in the secondary so the aroma and flavor
doesn't get scrubbed away during fermentation.


This is a good one, one of my best.  Enjoy it, and let me know
how it turns out!


Cheers to all of you

Thanks so much for the info.  I wonder if you are also covering the 
dynamic aspects of wort aeration.  Two areas I have wondered about are:


  1) How does the dissolved O2 number change over time as you are 
     pumping into wort without yeast in it (is it linear or not)?


  2) How does the DO number change as the yeast begin respiration?
     Another view of this question is:  How much O2 would the yeast
     want? If you max out the DO then pitch, would the yeast benefit
     from more DO later in the process or is there enough already?  Some
     people I respect feel that the yeast can take up O2 fairly
     rapidly, even while you are aerating, which might dictate a longer
     aeration period or perhaps a second aeration period an hour or 
     three later.


Thanks.

A couple of brewers have asked about the problem of "ring around the
collar" in their bottles, and wondered about the lack of any off-flavor.
The answer is that YES, this is a contamination and YES it seems to be
otherwise benign.  I have run across beer bottles like this numerous
times over the years in competitions (although not in the last several
years) and even had a batch of my own once (a long time ago, sonny).
But it does indicate a problem with sanitation somewhere, and is a
gentle nudge to figure out where you're taking shortcuts.  It will also
cause an otherwise good beer to lose points in a competition.

I rarely offer recipes, particularly extract-based recipes, but this
particular beer turned out well enough to share.  I put it together for
my Beginning Brewing class -- one of the perks is that I get to drink
the beer.  I've been trying to resolve problems with alpha acid
extraction and the correct amount of Irish Moss to use, and this one has
come very close to satisfying me.  Effectively, I've doubled the
bittering hop rate and the Irish Moss rate that I would use for an
equivalent all-grain batch.  Given that the process calls for boiling
1/2 the wort, this makes some sense.


My process calls for steeping the grains at about 150F for about one
hour before sparging them into a kettle, into which the extracts and
necessary water are then added.  I also pre-boil the water which will be
added to bring the volume up to 5 gallons (I do it a day ahead and put
the carboy into the hop fridge at Steinbart's).  If I had access to a
good laundry sink there I would force-chill the boiled wort before
adding it to the cold water, in order to bring the temperature down
quickly.


The Irish Moss caused a *massive* break.  Without doing a full boil and
siphoning off through a wort chiller (which doesn't work for beginners,
does it?) I'm not sure how to prevent carrying over the hot break.
Ideas?

This is excellent advice!  I used Ensolite pads for quite a while and they

hold the pads tight to the tun, giving a real good insulation factor.

Sure, it works great.  Moving the beer can be a pain, depending on your

I've made some quite good beer from the second runnings.  They're not
any more phenolic or astringent than a normally sparged beer, IMHO.
"Second runnings" is perhaps not quite the right term.  What I do is
to re-infuse the mash, and then sparge normally, watching the SG, etc.
The local water is quite soft, so I don't have pH problems; someone
with hard carbonate water might need to acidify it, I don't know.


The gravity of the second beer depends on how much sugar is left in
the mash, of course.  Let's look at a concrete example:


    18 lbs English Pale Malt
    1 lb Belgian Aromatic Malt
    1 lb Belgian Special B Malt
    1 lb Pale Munich Malt
    .1 lb Roasted Barley


First runnings beer:
    Mashed with 7 gallons water (1.33 qt/lb), and took almost 5 gallons of
    run-off at about 1.088. (What I'd expect from my chart, although
    the amount collected is more in line with water retention of
    .4qt/lb instead of the .6qt/lb used in the chart.)
    Boiled down to 3.6 gallons at 1.122.


    This beer is still fermenting at 50F. (brewed 3/26)


Second runnings beer:
    Sparged 7 gallons at 1.024, boiled down to 5.5 gallons at 1.031.
    I later added the "steepings" of a pound of English crystal to bring
    the effective gravity up to about 1.033.


    I brewed this beer for my wife's graduation party, loosely in the
    "Scottish Light" style.  I wanted a low-gravity "poundable", but
    flavorful beer.  It's got a really nice malty/caramel aroma, offset by
    hop bitterness to give a crisp flavor.  I don't find any phenolic
    aroma or astringency in it.


    I got lots of compliments on it, from folks most of whom drink "plain
    American" beer (and a number of them said "I don't normally like
    beer").  We went through over 5 liters of it at the party (30 people),
    together with almost 5 liters of stout.


A note: I got lower than normal extraction on the second beer (I was
shooting for a "Scottish Heavy" around 1.036).  I think this is
because this was my first batch in a different system, and I forgot to
account for the fact that it has a large "dead space" in the
mash/lauter tun underneath the false bottom (as opposed to my usual
copper-manifold in a Gott cooler system).

Subject: Skunkiness


>From *Jeff* Renner 
 
Paul Huneault likes the skunkiness of imported lagers.  Paul, some people 
will be incredulous that you like something that is considered a defect from 
exposure to light.  But you are by no means the first person I have heard of 
who finds it pleasant.  It's a neurological truism that the human brain 
(well, actually the vertebral brain, as cattle, elephants and birds have 
been documented to seek out fermenting fruit and become intoxicated) that 
when our pleasure center is stimulated by ethanol, we form a pleasant 
association with the delivery vehicle.  Probably an endorphin release, 
everything seems to be.  This explains why alcoholic beverages are an 
acquired taste, and why folks in other lands smack their lips over fermented 
mare's milk, masticated maize, rye bread and water, and other fermenti we 
might find revolting. (See Spring Zymurgy for some recipes for indigenous 
brews.) 
 
Your favorite, skunkiness, is formed when light of a specific wavelength 
strikes and modifies a certain sulfur bearing portion of the iso-humulone 
molecule (from hops) in the beer.  This wavelength is fairly well filtered 
out by brown glass, hence the choice of that color for beer bottles.  Those 
favorite imports of yours are marketed at home in brown bottles, but 
somehow, the US market has come to associate green bottles with "import 
quality."  And, of course, your preference for these beers is because, even 
with a slight skunkiness, they really are more interesting than Schludwiller. 
 
So, your ever inquiring mind will ask, how does Miller avoid skunkiness in 
MGD in clear bottles?  Ahh, those clever folks at Miller don't use whole 
hops.  They use a patented hop extract in which the light sensitive portion 
has been modified to render it unreactive. 
Still want to make your beer skunky?  Place it in clear bottles (or even the 
whole carboy!) in direct sunlight.  I've heard that even 15 minutes will 
suffice.  Florescent lights are also rich in the culprit wavelength.  Want 
to avoid it?  Avoid direct light, use brown bottles, and cover your carboy.  
Cut an "X" in the bottom of a paper grocery bag and put it upside down over 
your carboy with the neck and airlock sticking out through the X.  Actively 
fermenting beers are not in too much danger from indirect light; the 
suspended yeast keeps light from penetrating very far.  Dark beers are less 
sensitive for a similar reason.

Regarding Jeff Renners post:


I have used Sankey kegs (and soda kegs) and I agree with Jeff, stick with the
soda kegs for everything but the biggest brews.  If your a glutton for
punishment, read on...


Jeff suggests leverage to close the kegs, clearly by his experience, this works


To give another option, I use a brass drift I borrowed from my auto shop
to drift the reatining ring into place. A friend planted the idea by using a
plastic screwdriver handle but I got tired of messing up a perfectly good
screwdriver.  I also have an idea for a tool which will do it.  Consider
cutting a circle out of a piece of wood or metal the same size as the neck of
the keg, then cut it through the center.  By clamping it back together you have
a lock underneath the ridge around the fitting.  Now drill three holes and use a
steering wheel puller and a socket (or the like) to press the center part down
and insert the ring.  Be careful with the seals I have no idea where to get new
ones.    I may construct a prototype out of 2" thick oak or another hardwood -
as I think pine would split.


If all this sounds like a fancy gear puller, it is - but the gear puller
doesn't work because the underside of the fitting on the keg is sloped.  I
suppose you could modify that with a die grinder then use a gear puller but
that keg material doesn't grind or cut very well (I've tried).


I must admit these big kegs are great for a party but man, what a pain!


good luck

          A Brief Chemisty Lesson:


          A number of recent posts have correctly pointed out that
          beer will appear much darker in a fermenter than in a glass.


          In case you are curious, us chemists quantify the effect
          with the equation:


               A = abc


          Where "A" is the absorbance of the solution, "a" is a
          proportionality constant called the extinction coefficient,
          "b" is the distance the light travels through the sample and
          "c" is the concentration of the light absorbing substance.
          As you see, the relavent factor here is "b".  According to
          the equation, the absorbance of the beer will be dirctly
          proportional to the diameter of the container.


          This relationship is gennerally refered to as BEER"S LAW!!

To clarify my earlier post:  when you have the flat retaining ring started

Then force the ring outwards by twisting the blade of a *large* (I had said

when dealing with sparging.  Since I am still a lowly extract brewer, 
I can't testify to the truth of this statement.  However, as a 
physicist, I find the statement very heartwarming.


A few comments on this raging debate on sparging temperatures.  Let 
us first remember that temperature and heat are two entirely 
different things.  Heat is energy; in fact, it is the energy 
transferred between objects of different temperature.  Temperature, 
on the other hand, is simply the property of an object; namely, the 
property that two objects have in common when no heat is being 
transferred between them.


There are 3 types of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and 
radiation.  As far as sparging is concerned, I believe that radiation 
is not a major concern (I could be wrong due to a lack of knowledge 
about the intricacies involved in everbodies' processes.).  Conductive 
heat transfers occur because 2 objects of different temperature are 
in thermal contact (ex. the hot flame is in contact with the cooler 
pot, so heat is transferred to the pot).  Convective heat transfers 
occur by material movement and mixing (ex. you open the lid on the 
pot and the hot, less dense steam goes upward and mixes with the 
cooler room air).  If you keep the lid on your sparging apparatus 
(apparatii), you should be able to minimize convective heat losses, 
meaning that the primary method of heat loss is by conduction.


This makes for a much easier physics problem since we have a simple 
formula for conductive heat losses.  It is


Q/t = k x A x (T2-T1) / d        where


Q/t = heat rate loss (heat per unit time)
k = thermal conductivity
A = area of thermal contact
d = thickness of insulation (ex. thickness of sparging kettle) 
k = thermal conductivity of insulation
T2 = hotter temperature (wort)
T1 = cooler temperature (room temperature)


If you are trying to maintain a steady temperature in your mashing 
and sparging, you would need to minimize this formula.


Just a comment on a few other things that Jack stated.  While it is 
true that stainless steel is not a great insulator (compared to 
styrofoam or fiberglas insulation), it is a fairly good insulator 
compared to most of the metals used in pots.  It has a thermal 
conductivity of 0.3 J/(sec cm C), which is far less than any of the 
aluminum alloys (1.8-3.0), iron (1.3), or copper (7.1).  This means 
that it will loose heat at a rate that is 1/4 to 1/24 of that of any 
other pot (unless you use some other type of material for your pot).

Edition)


He also commented on extrapolating heat loss based on what it did 
during the first 30 minutes (10 F lost).  I hope that he is using the 
above equation when he is doing that extrapolating.  You will note 
that as the temperature decreases, the rate at which the heat is lost 
decreases.  If we assume a room temperature of 75-80F in the kitchen, 
then a drop from 170 F to 160 F means that the rate of heat loss due 
to conduction has decreased by about 12-13%.  Therefore, it not just 
a simple matter of saying "10 F over 30 minutes means that 40 F will 
be lost over 2 hours".


Sorry about the length of this post.  But, it is a little less boring 
than sitting in a classroom for 10 years listening to it.  So be 
thankful (unless you too are a physics geek).
