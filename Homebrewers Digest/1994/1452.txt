Subject: Beer judge poisoning


I think most of know that a beer can get pretty nasty with infections and
not be hazardous to you health. Now when I judge a beer I expect the beer to
have normal ingredients and I would not worry about tasting it. Now say our
experimenting brewer decides to add and interesting ingredient to the beer
to insure a winner. Maybe something cool like oysters or hemlock! Hey I
don't know about other judges, but I don't want to be subjected to such
experiments! At one of our club competitions, one of our judges judged an
oyster stout (it was not labeled as such) and was pretty upset that he was
unknowingly subjected to the foul stuff. I agree! The entrant was also upset
that his beer (that was hammered) was not judged as an oyster stout. The
catagory was Dry Stout.


Some ingredients are on the fringe, I don't want to be subjected to them! As
far as I know there is nothing in the normal ingredients of beer that
prevents or cancels out all bad or dangerous ingredients. 


Have fun experimenting with YOUR beer!

Subject: water


Jeremy Bergsman comments on a water analysis, but made one or two comments I
must question.  The extremely soft water was obviously a surface water, 
possibly from a fast running stream.  This can be told by its softness,
high silica level - sand being washed, and its high organic level.

Yes, it is bad but it is not the result of industrial pollution. Jeremy's
statement is ridiculous.  Usually organics in the water supply are the 
result of biological activity, i.e. algae photosynthesiziing and excreting
or decaying.  The organic matter makes treatment tricky and usually 
requires more chlorine than an organic free ground water.  It can also 
react with chlorine to form not very nice compounds.  For such water I
recommend activated charcoal filtration to remove the organics and chlorine.
(While on the subject - so called environmentalists and their disinformation
really get my goat - over 99% of so-called carcinogens in surface waters
are naturally occurring).

No. It is fine.  Anything under 1 ppm is OK and even a little over will not
adversely affect the taste.

I have seen in the yeast FAQ a yeast for use in California Common Beers.
I don't know anything about this type of beer and would like to ask the

Are they ok for summer brewing in NE, my basement stays at about 68F?

Subject: Plastic Carboys


I am new to internet surfing but not to homebrewing (about 25 batches).  I
have a question regarding plastic carboys.  I originally started out using a
glass carboy, but when a mishap caused me to smash a tile in our kitchen, I
was banished to the garage and decided to switch to the plastic type.  I have
often heard that plastic retains beer spoiling 'nasties' much more so than
glass, so I was wondering if I am asking for trouble using plastic?  Since I
am paranoid about ruining batches, I do not rack into a secondary but let the
whole fermentation process occur in the primary.  Is this a big mistake too? 
I hope that these questions have not come up recently in HBD.


Thanks for all responses,

Howdy from Zion!


The recent thread on light induced skunk essence has me concerned.
How much light will cause this problem?  Most of the stories tell of
carboys or bottles left in the sun for 1/2 hour, 1 day, etc. being
affected.  Will I get this problem from occasional and very indirect
sunlight?  I keep my carboys in a closet for primary.  Will 60W
lightbulbs hurt the beer?  For secondary, I place the carboy on a rolling
cart in my dining room (read very, very indirect sunlight).  


I have not noticed any obvious problem, but I would like to read some
quantitative information regarding this light pollution.

Subject: Polyclar Question


I used polyclar on two batches of brew,  I used 2 teaspoons of polylcar to
each batch.


One batch I boiled some water, then after a boil of 5 minutes, I added the
polyclar to that water, then dumped the stuff into the fermenter. Only a
little, little, little bit of foaming occured.  My  airlock did bubble, but
not tremendiously.


the other batch I added 2 teaspoons polyclar directly to the fermentor, I
got a little more foaming.


I have read messages on HBD and in books on how this stuff is suppose to
REALLY FOAM UP! Well where is all this foam????  My batches are 3 gallons
each. I could of bottled the beer, but I wanted to give polyclar a try and
see what happens.


Did I do something wrong?  Did I use to little polyclar?


Where's the foam??

right down about an inch above the mash bed. I consructed it all out of 1/2
rigid copper and 1/2" flex copper for the ring.

Subject:       Heat vs. Temperature


Sorry to waste more time on this, but duty calls.  In yesterday's 
post, Andy Walsh takes umbrage with my definitions of heat and 
temperature.  Sorry, Andy, but those are the technical definitions 
for these terms.  Heat is energy, but it is the energy TRANSFERRED 
between two objects of different temperature.  An object does not 
contain heat; it contains thermal energy.  And you are correct in 
pointing out that there are equations correlating temperature to 
thermal energy (They are not the one that you wrote, though, which is 
the equation for the amount of heat that an object delivers or takes 
in when it experiences a temperature difference at constant volume 
and without a PHASE CHANGE.  Since every object will undergo 
at least one phase change on the way to absolute zero (0 K), 
your idea to set T1=0 is incorrect.).  However, this 
does not change the fact that temperature is defined as the property 
that two objects in thermal contact have in common when no heat is 
transferred between them.


The reason that I belabor that point is because if you understand 
this, then you immediately realize how to calibrate your thermometer. 
Each temperature scale (Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin) is defined 
by the temperature at 2 points.  Therefore, if you allow your 
thermometer to come into thermal equilibrium (no heat transferred) 
with the appropriate objects at these two points, you will be able to 
calibrate your thermometer.  For example, put your thermometer in 
boiling water and read it.  This point, whatever it is on the scale, 
is 212 F (100 C) at standard pressure (check your favorite handbook 
for corrections do to altitude).  Next, put the thermometer in ice 
water and read it.  This point is defined to be 32 F (0 C) at 
standard pressure.  For any point in between these two points, merely 
interpolate by dividing the space between these two readings by 180 F 
(100 C).  For readings outside of the boiling and freezing points, 
the only thing that you can do is to assume that the thermometer is 
linear and extrapolate appropriately.


The other point that I would like to make is that the equation that I 
mentioned in my article was NOT meant to be used by homebrewers.  All 
three forms of heat loss are occurring and therefore using an 
equation that describes only one form would be innapropriate.  I 
agree with you to run the experiment and check the results.  I 
mentioned the equation only to point out that Jack's assumption that 
the same amount of heat would be lost in equal amounts of time was 
wrong since the amount of heat lost depends upon the temperature 
differences involved.


I apologize once again for the interjection.  And now back to 
brewing...


John

Yes and no.  Is the air with which the starter is aerated sterile?  If not,
then the starter is not sterile.  If it is sterile, then I think you have
a very good system.  I know that yeast propagators used in commercial yeast
production grow the yeast aerobically.

Subject: RE:Hot water,live animals,kelvin.


Hello All, a few comments and a question.


1. Andy Walsh is curious about boiling water being hotter than boiling.
Last semester in Food Science 361 we learned that sugar too will raise the
temp. of boiling water. Anything that is in the solution will absorb/hold the
heat and raise the temp. Candy making can be dangerous for this reason. The
sugary syrup can be really hot from being supersaturated. It won't LOOK hot
but...I hope that the more scientific h.b.er's will forgive me for not provid-
ing graphs. Also boiling is not a function of temperature. It is a function of
pressure and the heat needed for the "escape velocity" to break the bonds
and to "leap" into the air. I don't know about the thermometers. Perhaps the
manufacturer did like you, but at a higher altitude, he stuck the therm. in
 boiling H2O then stuck on the internally accurate scale based on "boiling
 at 212/100", wrongly. Is there a city/country of manufacture? What is it's

2.(Live) Animals are used in brewing in China. There is a medicinal liquor that
is made with lizards. It is a pale green color and has lizards on the label.
I was told that the lizards are thrown in the vat. It is supposed to be very 
good for you.  If any h.b.er lives in NYC or San Fransisco he/she can find it
any chinese store. If you live in NYC I invite you to buy some at Kamman Food 
Canal Street, or any grocery store on the Bowery below Broome. Let us know how
you like it. Just as life is too short to drink cheap beer; life is too short 
not to drink Lizard Liquor! I had some, it won't kill you.Just Do It!


3. The Question- I have some cherries and want to use them in beer. Is there a
prefered chemical sterilization or is boiling in/before/after wort good?
Is an ale or lager yeast recommended? This is only my second batch, any sugg-
estions are welcome. I do have the C.M. Thanks for your indulgence.
 Private e-mail flame or reply is prefered. It's tacky to feud on a public

Subject: Oh my God, an infection??


I'm beginning to think that some of my latest bottling is infected, and I'd
like to tap the collective wisdom of the HBD.  I've read Miller's Finding
Faults section, and it seems I may have one.


Background:


The recipe is the Bohemian Pilsner from Miller's book.  I used Saaz hops and
a partial mash.  The yeast was Brewtek Original Pilsner.


In the secondary (glass) I dryhopped 1.5 oz of Saaz pellets for about 2
weeks -- basically until they all dropped to the bottom.  I then racked and
bottled.


One week after bottling, the beer had a wonderful creamy head -- very stable
- -- but had a weedy, grassy bitterness.  One of my friends and Mark Garetz's
new book both said that this weediness should dissipate with some time.


Well last night the weediness is mostly gone, but the beer has a pronounced
lemon flavor.  I looked this up and Miller says that astringency is a
lactobacillus infection.  Is this what's up?  


What are the probable causes?  The only weak spot I can think of is my
racking technique, which I changed as a result of the recent postings.  When
I racked this beer, I sanitized the tubing and cane in bleach, rinsed and
filled with tap water and plugged the end with my...THUMB!


I'm naively hoping that this lemon thing is yet another phase that my beer
is going through, not a terminal condition.  What do ye think, oh great
ones?


TIA, and clean racking,

Subject: Questions regarding soldering of copper?


Hello all!


Within the last month or so, someone posted some good information
regarding the types of solder that would be appropriate for homebrewing.
They specifically listed several mixes/compounds to avoid.  Unfortunately,
I've misplaced that post.


I'm in the process of making a copper racking tube to use for siphoning
from my brew kettle thru my chiller.  My plans call for soldering a larger
end cap at one end to help keep some of the trub out of the chiller/fermentor.


If anyone knows of the post that I am referring to or has a copy, I would
appreciate hearing from you.


Private reply to kschutz`at`atmel.com will work.

Subject: Brass Ball Valves/Cleaning SS/Gravity Feed vs Pumps/Grain Mills


Well, first I'd like to thank everybody who replied to my last posting
about Stainless Steel/Valves/Pumps/etc.


The consensus about cleaning them was that the best way is to use
the old "Boy Scout" method of applying liquid soap all over the bottom
and then washing it off when done.  The funny part is that every
reply I got mentioned the Boy Scouts specifically.  I think that
this warrants further study.  Was everybody out there a Boy Scout?
I only made Cub Scouts....  Otherwise I would've known, I guess...


A word of caution about ball valves, specifically brass ones.
The Home Depot sells these ones made by "Jones Mfg Co.", and they
are complete crap.  The hex-nut part of the valve is poorly machined,
and the brass is soft, and this leads to your wrench stripping off
the damned corners of the thing.  I did not have this problem with
the "Speedaire" brand valves that I picked up from Grainger for the
same price.  Hope this helps someone.


Also a lot of people asked why I wanted to use a pump and not use
the full gravity feed system.  Well, the answer is that I am a complete
klutz, and would suffeer 8th degree burns all over my body after the
complete 15.5 gallons of scalding hot sparge water hit me square in the
noggin.  The burner'd probably also whack me on the head, causing a nasty
concussion to go along with it.  Don't beleive me?  Come over sometime
for a homebrew and entertain yourself.


Also, the recent post about animals in beer was intensely amusing,
congrats to the gentleman that posted it.  We need more humor around
here!


My query --


Could anyone point me to more information about building a grain mill?
I've been wanting to do this for a long time, but recent events have
motivated me even more.  I have already got the Zymurgy gadgets issue,
in which there's an article about how to build a grain mill from hell,
complete with 30 lb hopper, 800 hp motor, etc, etc.  What I'm really
looking for are those knurled rollers, like the ones used in the
MALT(TM)MI(TM)LL(TM).  I know exactly what they are, they're made from
the same stuff that they make handles for dumb bells with.  They also
make bench-press bars from the same stuff.  Anyone know where I can
buy this stuff?  Grainger doesn't seem to have anything comparable.
If anyone else is interested, contact me, and I'll mail you all the
information that I get.  Finally, what about a crank?  What's the best
way to build one of these?  Beleive it or not, I can't get past this
one...


Once again, thanks in advance!  This digest is seriously one of the
best places to get information anywhere on the Net...

The only manufacturer that I have run into that sells 1/2 bbl fermentors
is Elliott Bay Metal Fab. (normal disclaimers apply). I don't have a price
from them for this fermentor, but they sell the 2 bbl ones for $6,700. I
would expect that the 1/2 bbl one would be on the order of $1,500 to $2k


To this you would have to add the price of the compressor to chill the glycol
or water to run in the jacket plus the pumps. 


Many other groups sell systems from 2 bbls and up. for correspondingly large
sums of money.


Happy brewing....

Subject: Thermometer Calibration


Dweller`at`GVSU.edu writes "...can I assume the error is linear..."  No.  You
cannot assume it is linear.  It may be linear, it may be non-linear, it may
be a combination with linear and non-linear components.  If you want to
calibrate the thermometer, you can create a standard curve using another
thermometer that is "known" to read true.  Take several readings in a range
that you will be using the instrument with both the "bad" thermometer and the
"good" thermometer.  Plot the temperature readings taken with each
thermometer on different axes on a piece of graph paper.  Depending on the
correlation, you may need a set of french curves to draw a best fit line (or,
since you have a computer, you may be able to do this with software).  The
more data points you take, the better your graph will be.  If you want to get
fussy, you can take several temperature readings at each temperature with
each instrument and average them before plotting.  


You can interpolate the "correct" temperature by finding the point on the
graph that corresponds to a reading taken with the "bad" thermometer and
finding the coordinate on the "good" thermometer axis to which it
corresponds.  


Then again, if this seems like an inordinate amount of work, throw it out and
buy a laboratory grade thermomter ($15-20) (BTW you will need to have one --
the "good" thermometer -- in order to perform this exercise anyway).

I have the same filter unit.  When I ordered, I knew 0.5u was too small, 
so I ordered it with a 1u filter.  I found this was taking too much malt 
flavor and body out with the yeast.  I did as you and got a 5u filter from 
a local store and have been quite happy.  I think you can order a 3u 
element from the people you bought the original unit from.


However, I should point out that I saw George in early May and asked 
him about the difference between the 3 and the 5.  He said many people 
were getting excellent results with the 5, that there was not a lot of 
difference between the 3 and 5 (considering the sizes things in the beer 
I was trying to filter out), and that I probably would not get marked 
improvement in going from the 5 down to a 3.


Of course, I was trying to get rid of  extra yeast.  I have not had a 
problem with chill haze in my Oktoberfest or other amber beers.

I do NOT use hops in my yeast starters.  For why?  Because I autoclave
them, I don't feel like the feeble antiseptic contribution is worth the
effort.  And because I let the starters sit around in their Erlenmeyer
flasks and I don't want to fret about whether sunlight is going to make

Subject: shame


Last week I sent a request to cancel the daily delivery of this 
digest.  Rather than take the time to read the header that comes 
before the body of the digest, I sent the request to the wrong 
address.  In the past I have been solely interested in skipping 
directly to the contents to see if anything would be of interest.  
For sending my request to the wrong address (a flagrant violation 
of homebrew protocol and breach in Email etiquette) I offer my 
apologies.  However, in response to this innocuous fax pas I 
received several nasty letters and unnecessary comments. For 
example:


        Steven C. Boxer had the nerve to spew:
        > 
        > set homebrew nomail
        > 
        set mailing_list_user newbie
           As stated on the first page of each and every digest ever 
        sent to your mailbox, list requests go to the address 
        (surprise surprise) hombrew-request.  To send this to the 
        actual list just makes for more clutter and pushes back real 
        articles a day or two from being published.
             "Technology is a wonderful thing in the hands of 
        responsible people; a void of wasted resources in the hands 
        of fools."


In response to those individuals who have tainted this digest 
with personal attacks, pejorative and profiteering, I say shame 
on you.  I suggest to those who are so self-absorbed that they 
wish to transform a hobbyist's newsletter into an arena of 
negativism that they take stock of themselves and to the relative 
insignificance of homebrewing.  This recent trend has yielded a 
less enjoyable digest, created a negative impact on the hobby and 
alienated at least one reader.

Use decoction at least for this step (boil 1/3 of the mash

Add this step:
Raise temp to 72'C, leave for .5 hour

Do a full volume boil and cool before splashing (straining).

Read: when temperature is below 10'C, skip the dry hopping.

No, leave for 60 days at a temp. below 4'C, then prime and bottle.


Note that the recipe that Dave Line gives is not one of 'a beer
like I would buy'. It sounds too much like English mock-lager to be
called pilsner, let alone Pilsner Urquell.

Subject: Growing Hops


Howdy All:


I have a few questions on growing Hops.  I planted some Hops
rhizomes this Spring, and all have sprouted.  I live in northern
Virginia, near Washington, D.C.  One of the rhizomes, a Cascade,
has done fantastic, with five shoots (three over 5' high with one
at 15' with small flower buds), while the rest the rhizomes only have
1-2 shoots, and between 1-3 feet high.  Is the one Cascade plant
unusual for growing so fast in its first year?


This Cascade plant gets a little more sun than most, but a few
get just as much but are not doing as well.  All rhizomes were
planted in March/April in a 50-50 mix of Virginia red clay and
compost cow manure (16' dia. x 18" deep).  Other varieties
growing in addition to the Cascade are Hallertauer, Northern
Brewers, Saaz, Tettnang, and Willamette.  I also have another
Cascade in a different (less sunny) location, and is not doing
nearly as well.


My second question is if there is a good or recommended liquid
fertilizer that can be used to give the hops a boost (e.g.,
Miracle Grow)? Email or post ok.


TIA

Hello everyone!  I have a hop question that I was hoping to get an
answer to.  I am brewing a partial-grain honey lager that I want to
dry-hop.  My local brewstore only had Cascade hops in leaf form.  My
question (I hope I don't sound like a fool) is: Can whole leaf
hops be used exactly the same as pellets?  My last batch of beer
used 1 ounce of Cascade pellets in the secondary, so I was wondering
if I can toss 1 ounce of Cascade leaf hops in and get the same amount
of aroma, etc.  Private email would be appreciated.
        Also, does anyone know where I can get good (cheap) bulk grain?
My local store only occasionally has 15 pound bags for sale.  I'd like
to get, say, 50 pounds to keep around.  I know William's sells bulk
grain, but living on the east coast would make the package a tad
on the expensive side.
        One last question:  How do you expert all-grainers measure
the amount of grain? For my first all-grain batch, I crushed
15 pounds of pale malt and then measured-out how many cups of crushed
grain I had.  Then I had a conversion factor by which I could tell
how many cups of crushed grain equals one pound.  This crude method
was good for the first batch, but it would not be practical if
I bought a 50 pound bag o' grain!  Is there anything clever that people
do short of buying a scale?  Thanks for the help.
        Ta ta, and have a cold one for me!

I have a Lager that has been two weeks in the primary, that I want to get
into bottles soon because it's wrapped in wet towels and ice packs in my
closet due to the mini heat wave we are having in New England.  It
started at 1.047-8, I pitched with wyeast American Ale yeast, it has been
fermenting around 55-60 deg F for 2 weeks and there is nore more activity
in the air lock.  


Question: what F.G. should I expect/bottle at?  Due to the heat I'm
anxious to get it into bottles where I can lager it more easily. 


TIA etc....
