My sparges are this short also, due to the fact that I use the pump
from my RIMS system at slowest speed to pump wort from mash tun UP to
my wort boiler.  In that manner my sparge boiler and wort boiler are
above the mash tun and pump and I do not have to have a high tower.
My extraction rates are about 85% of "book" values as stated by
Miller (about 29 ppg for pale malt).


I have been concerned that I should be sparging more slowly, but the
last runnings are just barely sweet and very light colored, the draff
is not sweet at all.  The SG of the last runnings is down around 1.005
so it appears to me that I am getting all I can with that short of a
sparge.  My only concern is that a fast sparge may be causing some
astringency.

Subject: Kegs from scrap


I've been meaning to mention this for months, and an exchange with Ulick
Stafford reminded me: for those brewers in Oregon or nearby, I noticed a
nice big pile of beer kegs in a warehouse at Winkler Scrap Metal.  I
meant to give them a call some day, but haven't, so have no idea how
much they want.  The ones I saw were old, probably Golden Gates(?), and
it seems to me there were some quarter-barrels in there.


Winkler is at 3365 SE 17th (for now, apparently they'll be moving), and
at (503) 231-0799.

I agree with you that there may be ways to obtain legal title to a
keg, but I think the point is that the brewery is the legal owner, not
the distributor and the distributor has no right to pass legal title
to anyone, this can only be done by the legal owner, the brewery?
Right?  And since the brewery has invested over $100 in the keg, I
doubt that until the keg is "worn out" they would be willing to pass
legal title to anyone for a measly $12 deposit.  I see no reason why
Alcoholic Beverage laws should apply at all or even mention legal
title to kegs, since kegs are not alcoholic beverages.  It seems to me
that kegs would fall under common property laws and as such, if I
loaned you my lawnmower and you sold it to someone else, I think I
would have the right to prosecute and win against the buyer, given
that I could prove legal title in the first place, and neither you nor
he could come up with a bill of sale.  Why shouldn't it be exactly the
same for a keg?  I mean, it may not have a serial number, but every
one is surely emobossed with the brewery name, and without a complete
and legal chain of bills of sale from brewery to end possesser, the
end possesor cannot prove legal ownership.  This precisely what SABCO
is providing with the keg, is legal chain of ownership since you can
produce a bill of sale from SABCO and they can produce a bill of sale
from the brewery.


I am *not* a lawyer and therefore these are just my opinions, not
facts.

Subject: A recipe for MGD




   Please don't flame me before I speak.  I am getting 
married :-(   :-)  :-(   :-) next week (July 2nd) in 
Ft. Worth, TX.  I have made 40 gallons of beer and about
9 gallons of mead for the occasion.  The beer and mead 
are being shipped from here in LA to Ft. Worth by truck :( 
and hopefully will arrive in as good a shape as it did 
when it left.  Well Texas (or at least this part of TX) 
is in the dark ages as far as good beer is concerned. 
I couldn't talk my father-in-law into getting a keg of 
good beer (another rarity in this region, best keg 
I could get was Shiner Bock, an ok micro beer). 
Apparently some people are hooked on Miller Lite, Coors 
Light, or MGD.  


   So, here is my question, 'Does anyone have a recipe
for one of these "poor excuse for a beer" beers?'  I am
going to write up the other recipes 
('Honeymoon Scream (Steam)', 'The Groom is Pale, Ale',
'Cranberry Orange Blossom Mead', 'Melon Honey Mead')
and I would like to show the domestic recipe as well.  With
a little lick they may come and appreciate the ingredients
of a fine beer vs a cheap American imitation beer. I thank-you
Beer People for being you.




p.s.  If anyone has good names for the meads, I would like
      to hear them.

Subject: Counterflow Chiller extras


Tim Hahrner asked me how I was able to insert one copper tube in  
another. My reply got bounced, and I figured it might be useful for  
others as well, so here's how I did it:


All I did was spend a fair bit of time making sure both tubes were as  
straight as possible. I suspect that this is probably the most  
important thing, but you need >40' of space to do it. I found that if  
I twisted the inside tube while pushing it through, I got over the  
sticky parts OK. I had both tubes laid flat out on the ground, and  
lifted as little as possible. If you lift them even a little too  
much, they will bend under their own weight. Also, I used a little  
spray lube (WD-40), but I didn't soak the thing in it. Finally, I  
made sure before I started that the edges of the tube ends were  
smooth and rounded. Be especially wary of the inside edge of the  
outer tube, as this is often pushed in by the tubing cutter, and may  
need to be filed or reamed.


All in all, it took me about an hour from cutting the tubing and  
straightening it to having one tube inside the other. I was surprised  
at how well it went. I think it helps that the hard copper surface,  
especially with a little oil, has much less friction than most  
plastic. I used TSP to clean and boiling water to rinse.


Hope this helps,

There has some comment on how the "publist" at the sierra archives is not
updated very often. How about having a volunteer be the "keeper of the list"
for their particular "area" (could be a metro area, part of a state, a whole
state, depending on size). They could be uploaded to the archives as separate
files (in a "publist" directory) and each would have the keepers address
("email changes, reviews, etc. to joe`at`whosis.com"). That way you download 
only the section of interest to you and have someone to send comments to.

Subject: Dallas brew & world cup






I got to see the World Cup soccer (football) match at Dallas this
previous friday and it was an unforgettable experience.  An       
interesting note is that the Dallas Brewing Co. sold about as 
much product as Budweiser did by the look of the lines.  The next
day I was able to visit their brewery in the West End district and
sample a few of their beers.  They had 4 on tap, a light, an amber,
a pilsner, and another which I can't recall right now.  The gentleman
who served them to us was a grad. of UC Davis and was one of the 
brewers there.  The tour, unfortunately, consisted of "that's the
brewery there on the other side of the glass.  You'll understand that
we can't actually let you get close to the brewery because you are
unclean and will spoil the beer.  Oh well.


The next stop was the Hubcap, a restaurant/brewery which had opened
the night before.  This meant that the stout that I sampled still
was blowing some yeast out the tap.  Too bad, though it was still
tastier than the Guiness I get at the market here in mid-America.  
I decided to try a wheat to go with my fried jalepenos (good, but $6
for 6 small stuffed jalapenos).  This one was better.  I wanted to 
try them all but was running short on cash so had to return home.


All in all a full, fun, but short, expensive weekend.  I think I'll
try it again in a month or so!

Subject: Duesseldorf, Bierstadt


My hat is tipped to Mike for his interesting comments about Duesseldorf and
Altbier. Although I haven't made it there in two years, when I am there, my
Stammtisch is at the Oberkassler Hof, just across the Rhein from the
Altstadt, and my Sunday Stammtisch is at the Brauerei zum Fuchschen.  I
often can be found at the Zille, which is right neat the bridge on the
Luegalle. I was actually introduced to Altbier in Frankfurt at the Klapper
33 (Frankenheimer Alt).I know this is a homebrew newsletter, and, but any
homebrewer would love the Altbier in Duesseldorf. It is quite simply the
freshest, most delicious beer made in the world. Now, a few comments about
and additions to Mike's letter:


it's pretty common to see Germans putting the 
>coaster over the glass in the summertime when at outdoor biergartens.  Keeps
>off the yellowjackets.


In Duesseldorf they also keep the bill on those deckel. One way they keep
the beer fresh is by only serving you a .2 liter glass. By the time you
finish it, the Kellner brings you a fresh one. He or she puts a line on
your deckel to show how many you bought. Way cool.


>       Fuchschen, Shumacher, and Shlussel are all good but lack the bustling
>my-God-why-doesn't-this-place-burst-apart-at-the-seams atmosphere.  


Who needs that? I love Fuchschen primarily for the Gegrillte Haxe-Grilled
Pig Shoulder that would make the American Heart Association shudder.


>And now the real good dirt:  You can buy the stuff and take it home.
>go to one of D-dorf's BIG department stores (I'd suggest Horton's on Graf-
>Adolf-Strasse), and find their grocery section.  


I've never seen on of those ceramic bottles, but I do know that the local
beer distributors sell Uerige and others with Grolsch type tops (I forget
at the moment wat those are called). HOWEVER, the beer is stamped with the
date for freshness and it should be consumed within three weeks time.
Treating beer like milk: That's the respect that beer deserves! I am not
sure that it travels well.


>Would y'all believe that I found a cold bottle of Schlosser
>Alt
>at a hotel catering to Germans in Bagamoyo, Tanzania?  


Those bottled beers that travel outside of the Duesseldorf/Moenchengladbach
area just do not taste the same as the beer that you get directly at the
source. Schloesser is the best of them though. I would avoid Kutscher.


Well, if anyone wants to pay our expenses, I would like to intoduce my wife
to Duesseldorf's wonderful bierkultur. Our one year old has kept us from
traveling, but in the meantime I've brewed a great porter! Anyone with any
recipes for altbier homebrew should send them to me. Thanks for hearing me
out!

HELP!  A long time ago someone published the recipe for making invert syrup.  
I have mislaid my printout of that posting: would someone do me the favor of 
re-posting or e-mailing direct to me?  Thanks!!!


I am gratified to see many of you weighing in to the discussion of Wyeast 
1007 vs. 1338 ("will the real Alt yeast please stand up).  So far, the 
evidence seems to be in favor of 1338, although there are some good arguments 
on the other side as well.  For myself, I made a DARN good beer with 1007 
that was supposed to be an alt....


Anyone ever used 1338 in a spiced holiday ale?  I've never used it at ALL, 
and my previous essays using 1056 and 1098 were not entirely to my liking.  
I've been thinking something more malty would be nice.  Any thoughts?

Subject: spruce & Mexican Pubs


Awhile ago I asked about spruce beers.  The happiest sprucers tended  
to brew a heavier ale as the base beer and add 1-4 cups (volume) of   
fresh new growth needles to their boil. Typically the needles are  
added at about the half way mark or later stages of the boil. The one  
most notable exception to the rule  was a light ale spruced with 1/4  
lb pine nuts crushed with shell.


Those that followed Papazian were less (or not) satisfied. Those who  
used essence were not satisfied.


These results represent the kind contributions of those willing to  
reply to my request and not a scientific study. Thanks to all  
contributors!


Andy Walsh asks:

Corona in style?


Having just returned from fishing in Baja, I can tell you that  
whatever was mas frio tasted real good to me, even corona. I prefered  
the Pacifica (as did most locals). The Dos Equis & Carta Blancas were  
all in cans and sub standard. BTW, If you're old enough to remember  
dime Cokes, you may want to try a Coke in Mexico. In most areas they  
are the good old-fashioned CANE Sugar variety of our youth and taste  
much better the corn sugar variety sold in the states.

Subject: Cloudy beer




Greetings:  


I have been brewing for about 2 years now (from extracts) and I am 
very happy with my finished products. A problem that I have been unable
to beat thus far, however is getting the beer clear.  Here is a quick
overview of my process:


Boil
Chill with immersion chiller
Filter through mesh collander into primary (poured through)
When primary fermentation stops, rack to secondary.
When beer clears in secondary, rack to bucket, bottle.


I am not using any agents to help clear the beer right now.  Does anyone
have any suggestion on how to get my beer from being cloudy?

I have gotten a few responses to my "build a formula from a table" request
that indicate I was unclear.  What I am looking for is a program that will
output a formula when a table is input.  For example:


1 15.3
2 16.6
 .
 .
 .
20 211


would give .5X^2 - .2X + 15   This way I can make formulas out of my tables,
and enter them in my calculator!

Subject: Keg Ownership/THANKS!


I'm not a lawyer, and I don't play one on TV, but...






How is the payment of deposit on a keg and treating it as one's own any


different than payment of deposit on returnable bottles and keeping them?










"Well, if the keg is going to be sliced and diced and permanently defaced


it will no longer be useful to the original owner and he should be upset."






"Yes, but while the bottles are not usually mutilated, they are pretty much


taken out of circulation permanently and effectively lost to the owner.


I suppose this can be justified by saying that the bottles "could" be


returned at some time in the future?"










So, it seems to me that if you've got a problem with "borrowing" kegs, you


should also have a problem with "borrowing" bottles.  Either that, or you're


engaging in the old double standard.






While purely a guess, I would think that the Big Boys lose more $ to


homebrewers from bottle loss than keg loss.  But in the grand scheme of


things, (not just homebrewers) there are probably more $ lost from unreturned


kegs, which is why they may be more sensitive to keg loss.






If you have problems with "borrowing" kegs/bottles - don't do it!  If it


doesn't bother you - fine!  As in all of life, it's your conscience, you've


got to live with it.

Anyway, I really just wanted to say "thanks" to all on the HBD.  I haven't


brewed any for about 7 years, and had been thinking about starting back up


several times recently, but just couldn't get off my butt.  Well, I


discovered the HBD and, flames and all, it seems to have inspired me.  I


now have a pale ale merrily bubbling away in the kitchen.  I had forgotten


how bad the waiting part was!!






Thanks folks!

Howdy fellow brewers!
A while back someone asked for (and got) information on several homebrew
BBSs. I would like to compile as near to a definitive list as I can.
>From reading HBD I gather there are also lists devoted to mead, yeast and
lambics, correct? Does anyone have these 'Net addresses? I also want as many
brewing related BBS names and numbers as I can get. Any descriptive info on
these boards/lists is also appreciated.
Private e-mail to <tg436`at`aol.com> is preferred to save bandwidth.
I will post the compilation if there is interest.

Subject: Beer thru Customs/Beer recomendations


    I have one of those opportunities of a lifetime.  My sister will be
travelling to Scotland and England on a business vacation.  She has agreed to
look for some beers to bring back for me, but I need to allay her fears about
shipping or carrying beer across international frontiers.  Since I don't have
any experience to call on, I hope that some where out there in HBD land there
are a few world travellers that could fill me in on the legal aspects of my
request.


    What kinds of limits are there on carrying alcoholic beverages back into
the US?  Is there a special duty charged?  Anything you think might help?


    Second question -- Now that I've taken care of the legal aspects of my
indirect beer hunting, I want some recomendations for the beers that shouldn't
be missed (but could still be safely tucked in a suitcase).  I've taken the
time to send her much of the information  in Greg Noonan's Scotch Ale book
(lucky dog gets to spend a week in Edinburgh).  What about some other beers
that might be available in Great Britian but not in the US?  Isn't Budvar (the
real stuff, not the American, ahem, imitation) available in GB?


Private e-mails are fine unless you think the general public might be
interested.


Thanks in advance for the help.  Hoppy Brewing.

Tell us...does Texas law not provide for any distinction between the
concepts of "rental" and "ownership"?


Under the normal procedure of renting a keg, a deposit is made with the
renter to ensure that the rented property is returned.  The deposit is not
intended to represent the value of the keg in a transfer of ownership; it
is intended to represent good faith that the keg will be returned to its
rightful owner.


> ...or would limit

The retailers and distributors do not own the kegs, ergo they do not have
any right to "pass legal title" for the keg to anyone else.


> ...How about a reference to a statute
> or applicable regulation?...


How about the fact that renting property does not constitute a transfer of
ownership?  Or are you of the Canter/Siegal net-school that "anything you
can get away with (using appropriate lawsuits to intimidate justice) is
righteous"?

And I'm not saying that "everything which is prosecutable is a crime";
however I have a knee-jerk reaction to assertions that anything you can get
away with under the law is OK.

Subject: treatise on hangovers




Ronald Narvaez sez:


        Well I think I have finally found the cure for hangovers. In
        the "Joy of home brewing" Papizian has a section on the
        effects of alcohol on your system. In this section it says
        that the alcohol robs your body of vitamin B complex.
        Therefor if you take a good dose of  vitamin B complex
        (found at most health food stores) before going to bed
        along with a large glass of water you should not wake up
        too hungover.
        Last weekend was my 29th birthday and I brewed a batch
        of Goat Scrotum Ale to party with. The brew was
        prepared as per the recipe except I added more dry
        extract than called for to increase to kick of the brew.
        Well the beer was great and I drank and drank and drank
        some more. Boy did I get a good feeling from all this beer.
        Before I went to bed I took 3 Vitamins and 2 Tylenol
        geltabs with 32 oz of water. When I got up I took a hot
        shower and then ate a good breakfast. Well I didn't have
        any headache, upset stomach, or that tired feeling. I am
        not one to drink to excess that often but the next time I do
        I will repeat this cure and see if it works as well again. Has
        anyone else tried this or something that works just as well.        


*        I know that the best way to avoid a hangover is not to
        drink too much, but there is always those few times when
        the beer just tastes sooooo good. 


Although my college years (which I'm finishing up this summer) have
been all but devoid of wanton partying, when I was back in high-school
excessive imbibment and frequent partying were much the same word. I
would take a B-complex stress vitamin (you know, the kind with many
many times the RDA dosage of each B) before setting out to consume
what was usually in the neighborhood of about 10 drinks (gasp!).  At
least three items always accompanied me to whoever's house: a sleeping
bag, which I always planned on using for I always planned to get
smashed and would never drive with any booze in my system;  Pepto
Bismol, which I never used but probably should've; and Advil, which I
never used at all. In fact I never had a hangover until freshman year
in college on one of the few occasions I drank anything alcoholic. It was blue
cool-aid spiked with a bottle of $5 Mexican everclear (definately NOT
triple-distilled!) and I didn't have my stresstabs.  All I can say
about that was that my stomach lining was dyed blue for in the morning
I got sick. And after I got sick till there was nothing left in my
stomach (or so I thought) to be sick about I drank some water...and
then got sick some more: BLUE liquid. It didn't matter how much water
I drank and puked...it was all blue liquid. The combination of
cool-aid and drink left my stomach dyed blue. And this leads me to my
final point (in addition to Ronald's):


Pepto Bismol


For the longest time I felt that the queezy feeling I get after wanton
consumption accompanying the spins which keeps me from sleeping were
due to the poisoning effects of alcohol. This always irked me because
I could never go to sleep while spinning. It made me feel sick. And so
I would get up a do something all night long until I worked off the
booze (in high-school I would help whoever clean up their house. Well,
often they would be passed out so I would clean up their house. Not
because I'm a nice person, but because I couldn't sleep).  Well the
spinning part is easy to account for. It's a brain thing that I'd be
happy to go into (and reconstruct from my 2-year old knowledge of the
relevant neuroscience) but I'll try to wrap things up since this is
getting quite long.  Anyways about the queeze. A lot of the queeze
never  seemed to be centered in the stomach so I never took my pepto
bismol. This sort of makes sense since the sensory status of a whole
bunch of internal organs (including the stomach) travel along a single
cranial nerver, the Vagus nerve. A little bit of crosstalk can occur
making it hard to pinpoint the exact site of pain. Ever wonder why
"heartburn" is called such when it stems from the guts?  Anyways, once
this year when I had a queezy stomach after taunting my stomach lining
with homebrew I took my pepto bismol BEFORE going to bed and it got
rid of the queeziness. It coats, soothes, and makes your brain ignore
the fact that your stomach lining has just fought the gastrointestinal
version of World War I. Trench warfare style. With poison gas.


So I've probably grossed the entire HBD out with my anecdotal accounts
and such but with good reason. I'd guess that most of us will get
smashed at least once a year. New Year's Eve. And many will be getting
smashed at the intervening festivities. And some will get smashed
because of that special homebrew that came out just right and tastes
so good that they just can't help nay don't WANT to help themselves
(except to the keg or bottles of said homebrew) *.  And my advice, which
really is nothing new, is to:


1: Take a B-complex stress vitamin before imbibing. I buy the cheapest.
2: Before bed, drink lots of water as per Papazian appendix 4. Take
   another stress tab now if you like. It might not be necessary though.
3: After the water settles about 5 minutes or so, take a dose of pepto bismol.
    Again I buy the cheapest I can get. For some reason I like the liquid.


If you really overdid it you might need to do the following in the morning:


4: In the morning drink more water (the pepto seems to dehydrate your
    a little more). And take some more pepto if your stomach needs it
    but a little breakfast might make you feel better. If you get sick
    after eating your breakfast: a: your stomach needed the extra
    pepto and b: your stomach does NOT thank you for over-imbibing.


The advice about a nice shower first thing is good too. 


So in short: The stress vitamin prevents headache hangovers. The pepto
helps prevent stomach hangovers. The water helps everything and the
shower helps you feel ready to tackle a fresh new day (with a fresh
and clean body). It's nothing new but neither are the basic principles
of healthy eating and weight loss. Sometimes you just need to hear it
for the nth time.

Hello,


I've read with interest posts by a HBer who calls himself the "Alabama Outlaw"
and imagined how exciting his/her life must be to live on the edge - just one
short step from the slammer - In my reverie I was tintillated by the thought
of a life of crime!  When I came back to reality, I was a bit bummed that, no,
I was just another ordinary Joe...


UNTIL...


I was reading in the paper the other day a column called "Ask Jack Sun" (sort
of our local info person, and Ralph Nadar - people write in with questions
or problems and AJS finds out the info, or calls people and does like Elvis,
i.e., takes care of business in a flash).  Anyway, someone wrote in asking
about homebrewing, and AJS called the state ABC and discovered that home-
brewing is ILLEGAL!  Here I was, thinking I was just an ordinary lunk, but
I'm not..well, OK, I'm still a lunk, but I'm a LUNK ON THE EDGE!!


This is particularly interesting in that a couple of weeks ago a friend
was featured (with a BIG picture, NAME, and place of employment) in this
same paper describing how he brewed a batch of beer (Crying out Loud Ale,
Teddy Beer, etc were the monikers) in honor of the birth of his new baby
girl, and was passing out bottles like cigars!  Well, no revenoors have
busted down his door looking for his brewery........YET!


Does anyone else out there live in a place as backwards as this - its
OK to make wine, but not beer? - go figure....


By the way, does Mississippi law enforcement have any jurisdiction on the
Information Superhighway, or is it just the Information Superhighway Patrol?

Subject: Re: Dry Malt or Liquid Malt




     I've heard some people say that malt syrup gives more
body to an ale than malt powder but I think that may be
personal preference.
     They both have physical problems when using - syrup
is messy and some find it a pain to handle. Powder absorbs
air-borne moisture like a super sponge and is very sticky.
     One thing to remember is that malt powder is almost
all fermentable where as about 75% of syrup is (I think
thats right). This means for a given weight of one you
need to adjust if you use the other. Apart from that, I've
always been told that they can be used interchangeably.
     A slightly more technical problem with malt extract
in general, is if you are using any specialist grains in
your brew which need their starchs converted to fermentables.
There are two types of extract - diastatic and non-diastatic.
Diastatic malt extract contains the relevant enzymes
(diastase) to help convert the starchs in the speciality
grains. Non-diastatic extract doesn't (obviously). The use
of one where the other is specified in a recipe will mean the
results might not be what was expected.

A couple of quick questions (private e-mail responses)


1)  When in the brewing process does one filter the wort/beer?  Seems to me
    that if one filters from primary--->secondary or secondary--->bottles
    the yeast would be filtered out--->no yeastie beasties to munch on the 
    sugars to make the ETOH?  I can see filtering the wort--->primary prior
    to pitching....


2)  The wife is forcing me to build a new house - I like where we are now!!!
    My consolation is that she has promised me that I can have a room (prob-
    ably a *closet*) which will be dedicated to hiding the brewery from the
    revenoors (see earlier post from yours truly).  The room/?closet will 
    probably have a sink (& might double as the wife's pottery studio - so
    much for "dedicated").  Now for the question...Does anyone "out there"
    have any suggestions as to a set up for a small room brewery with the 
    boiling and whatnot outside to prevent CO poisoning?

Subject: Coopers yeast


Stephen Hudson asked about Cooper's yeast.
Our homebrew club members culture yeast from Cooper's Ale bottles quite 
frequently. We regard it as a very good all purpose ale yeast. I have found it 
to finish on the sweet side when used in high gravity brews. I suspect it is 
the same as Yeast Lab A01 Australian Ale for the American readers. I have never 
used this, but the description in the yeast faq matches Coopers'. Aside from 
that, as Coopers'  is the most easily available Australian yeast (it is bottle 
conditioned, unfiltered and unpasteurized), it is likely the only Australian 
yeast available in the USA (to my knowledge) is Coopers'.
("very complex, woody and flavorful...medium attenuation" in the yeast faq)
The dried ale yeast is a different strain to the liquid yeast. I have never 
brewed two identical brews to compare the two, but members in my brewclub 
prefer the one cultured from the bottle. As Coopers is readily available, why 
not try a culture? Get a fresh bottle though.
