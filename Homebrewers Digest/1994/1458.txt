Subject: saccharine/ fruit beer


>Any comments on the saccharine??  Is there an alternative method (like
>adding lactose, or something...) that I could substitute for the 
>saccharine??


I made a brown ale that called for malto dextrin for residual sweetness 
and body.  I think Papazian has some info on the use of malto-dextrin 
or perhaps someone more experienced can help you out.     


And now for something completely different:
        I recently made a fruit beer and wanted to report my experiences 
and ask some questions.  
        Background:  Last summer I made a raspberry ale by adding 5# of frozen 
raspb's to the kettle after the heat was off.  Fine beer, nice and clear but 
really lacked the raspb aroma and flavor I wanted.  So this year I decided 
to add them to the secondary.   
        Boiled my wort etc let the belgian ale yeast go 'til it slowed down 
some.  I went to get frozen raspb's at the local club place and they were 
out!!!  So I used the pound and a half I had in the freezer and supplemented 
with 3# strawb's.  
To kill any nasties that survived the freezer I put the fruit in a pot and  
brought it just  to a boiling temp and then cooled quickly in an ice 
bath.  I added the fruit to the secondary and what an eventful 4-5 hours.  The 
raspb's sank immediately but the strawb's floated up to the too small head 
space.  I soon learned that strawb's are a close approximation of a 
sponge.  
        So they floated, swelled up, got pushed into the blow off 
tube which they promptly and regularly plugged.  I spent the next several 
hours pulling the tube/plug assembly out, clearing the hose, fishing 
strawb's out of the carboy neck ( w/ my fingers ) and wiping strawb's off 
the wall.  After what I feared was a now contaminated batch calmed down it 
took a looong time to ferment the sugar contributed by the fruit.  
        I bottled hoping for the best.  It's young yet but doesn't seem to have 
any off flavors.  Next time I'll leave plenty of headspace so the fruit 
stays in the beer instead of going into  the blow off.  The beer is 
incredibly cloudy.  I suspect that I activated the pectin by heating the 
fruit.  
        So here's some questions for you h-brew guru's:
        *Should I just use pectin enzyme?
           If so when is it appropriate to add it?  W/ fruit I assume.
        *Is it unnecessary to heat commercially frozen fruit?
        *If I tried to sulfite the fruit would I encounter side affects?


Many thanks in advance and I hope this is useful to some would be fruity 
brewers.  


Cheers and Beers

Subject: Really Dry Beer!


Read an interesting article in the newspaper last night.  It was from
one of the wire services but I forget which one.


Summarizing the article, it seems a brewery in Czechoslovakia has
developed powdered beer.  I kid you not.  The article didn't say what
exactly was meant by powdered beer, but that in 10 days the beer is
ready to drink.


The purpose behind all this is marketing to the former Soviet Union
countries.  When communism fell, new markets were opened.  But because
transportation and other costs were so high, shipping Czech brew to
those countries was cost prohibitive.  Powdered beer alleviates much of
that cost.


The developer of the stuff says that it tastes pretty good.  Well of
course, what else would he say?


What would Ilkka have to say about this?  ;-)

Thanks for info on scorching - I suspect I was not turning the flame
off when I added the extract and thereby toasting the malt.


On another note, I recently measured my "33 quart" enamel brewpot...
15.5 inches in diameter and 10 inches deep.  Basically, a simple
truncated cylinder.  Based on the conversion factor of cubic feet to
US gallons, I keep coming up with more like 7.15 gallons rather than
8.25 gallons.  Am I blowing what is an incredibly simple calculation 
or is this like buying a Two by Four stud and finding it to be 1.5 X
3.5 inches?

Well I asked if any of you had a recipe for a Fruit beer, namely a
Strawberry or Apple one and o one replied to me.  Well i'm thinking about
trying to design one myself, but I have a few questions.  I have
never designed a recipe before.


I want to make an Ale, light to medium in color (not dark or stouty
looking)


Should wheat malt be used?
Should I crush or puree the fruits? (ie. make an apple sauce out of the
apples)
HOw much fruit should be used? (I want the drinker to be able to recognize
that there is fruit in the brew) 4-5 gallon batch of beer will be made


Basically I'm asking if anyone can throw my way any input he/she should
have in designing a recipe of this type.   What types of grains should
I use? Munichs, Pale Malts, Crystals...etc..etc.  I prefer to use and All
Grain type recipe instead of using extracts.

Actually, Wyeast doesn't have an "Alt" strain, per se.  They have 1007
"German ale yeast", which is pretty fluffy (flocculation is low) and
1338 "European ale yeast", which is a high flocculator.  Question is,
which is the "alt" strain (and a source of some debate in a certain
forum)?  To the best of my knowledge -- and I will double-check this --
neither of these strains was specifically from a Dusseldorf source.  I
know that the strain Widmer uses (which, I am certain, originated with
Zum Uerige) is quite fluffy, but it *does* flocculate to some extent.


Wyeast also has a "kolsch" strain, which is described as a low
flocculator.


I would venture to suggest that some of the poor floccing strains might
perform a little differently in the bottle than in a large vessel.


When I speak to Dave again (needs to be pretty soon), I will raise the
question of altbier strains.

 Again, to correct a bit of misinformation....
 
 The most critical parts of the mill are NOT stainless.  The rollers are 
 cold-rolled steel, the bearings and the gears are still plastic.
 
 Stainless steel rollers ARE available on the MM, although expensive and the 
 bearings are oil impregnated bronze and the gears are precision ground steel.

 I have pondered this question and will be interested in the answers.  I 
 didn't think there was a shortage of recommendations, I just have never sean 
 any reasons.  As such great pains are taken to minimize the head space and 
 the oxygen in it, one can't help but wonder why not zero.
 
 The only possible reason I can think of is that it acts as a buffer in the 
 event of minor freezes.  This can be important to commercially packaged beer 
 but I see no reason that would be of any use to the homebrewer who takes good 
 care of his/her beer.

 Seriously, I did not mean to be snide, just realistic.  If I didn't think

 This seems so obvious that it is hard to believe the discussion ever got

I'll be gone 3 weeks - that would make a total of 5 weeks in the fermenter.
I haven't got a secondary fermenter - I've only got a 50L and a 25L primary,
which are always both full.  I have heard that the brew shouldn't be left
too long in the primary due to the risk of autolysis - what makes a primary
different from a secondary, other than less dead yeast at the bottom?  I'd
like to age the next two batches for a while since I'll be brewing an Old
Peculiar and a strong pale ale, but wouldn't want autolysis to spoil them.
Thanks,

That makes sense to me.  I'm starting to think that it's the dispensing
method, rather than the carbonating method, that causes the difference in
the head.


In fact, Bob Jones wrote back in May:

Certainly, a cobra tap will introduce much more froth than pouring from
a bottle, especially if you don't open the tap all the way.


I may buy a counterpressure bottle filler soon.  If so, I'll be able to
compare tap-dispensing vs bottle pouring on the same, force-carbonated
beer.

Subject: laws and kegs?






Louis brings up the question of keg ownership.  He makes a good
analogy to the returnable bottles that many homebrewers use for 
their own brews.  Would not the Cornelius (sp) kegs which many
of us use for kegging fall under the same category, or am I the
only brewer who is not paying $100 for each of my kegs (close to 
the list price for a new Corny).


Personally, I only payed 5 dollars apiece for 6 kegs which I pur-
 -chased from a guy who wanted to get them out of his garage.  I 
bought them from him but 3 of them still have stickers on them 
which state:  "This container belongs to ... company."  


Don't get me wrong, I don't feel the need to return these to the
soft-drink distributer just yet, but I am going to bring a few of
them to a party where many police officers and lawyers will be in
attendence.  I was just curious if any of them would be trying to
put me in jail for theft or unlawful use of somebody elses
(else's) container.  (I'm hoping that I end up with good beer for
the party, or they might try to put me in jail for that too.):)


No new info really, just thought I'd point out the relevance of
Louis' question since a majority of our storage devices (bottles,
Corny's, and Sankey's) fall within this "deposit" category.  'Nuff

In the state of Va, it is against the law to charge more 
than 10 (or 15) dollars deposit per keg.  This is a absolutely 
rediculous limitation to the brewers.  You would be amazed how
many kegs sit in a backyard, merely due to the drastically small
deposits levied on the consumer.  Remember, these kegs cost at
least $85.

Not sure about microscopes, but the 5 micron pleated high efficiency cart
sold by the filter store results in a polished, clear product. If 5 works 
this good, I cant imagine ever using a smaller one.

I believe Norm had it closer. Since CO2 is heavier than air/O2, the Co2 
will "blanket" the surface of the fermenter.  This effectively forms a 
barrier where the air is safely removed from the beer/wort solution. As for
direct O2 introduction into fermenting wort, this will surely create elevated
diacetyl levels.

Well I've never seen one of these, but I remembered an old trick
that my friends used to play on one another at partys.  If someone
was drinking out of longnecks, you could hit their bottle on top
with your hand or the bottom of your bottle, and the bottom of 
their bottle would break out in a rather neat circle.  This usually
got somebody's shoes wet and nearly everybody got a good laugh out
of it (but I digress). 


The round bottom from the bottle sounded like it would work much
like a Pot Watcher.  I took a cheap longneck and put it in a brown
paper sack which I less-than-gently dropped on the sidewalk.  This 
produced a nice piece of glass which I washed off and dropped in
with the boiling wort.


To the astonishment of both me and my brew partner the silly thing
worked.  We haven't even come close to a boilover since (knock on
wood and damn Murphy's laws).  You will probably be able to find
something better than a broken bottle (glass marbles come to mind), 
but I would definitely recommend at least trying this.  You can
fish the stuff out of the kettle at the end of your boil and continue
as normal.

        The poor man looks up and says"Oooooh, Mr. Checkson...."  A trade?
                Also, I'm deliberating over making 1-3 gallons of mead. I
        tried a commercial mead called Chaucer's and wasn't impressed at all.
        Too sweet, thick and the flavor of cheap wine. Does homebrewed mead
        turn out like this or is Chaucer's a poor example of GOOD mead?

Subject: Lautertun Dead Space




     Some all grain brewers seem to be concerned about the dead 
space created under a false bottom mash/lautertun.  I use the 
two 5 gallon bucket device for my tun.  This leaves about a 2 inch 
dead space between the bottom of the drilled bucket and the 
solid bucket.  I fill this space and about 1/2 inch of the drilled 
bottom with hot water prior to adding the grain.  Why is this dead 
space a concern?
     I have been planning to switch to a gott cooler with a copper
manifold.  This would eliminate the dead space issue, but I am 
curious as to why it could cause a problem.
     I am having difficulty finding a 10 gallon gott cooler.  I know
they exist from seeing info on prior posts.  I have only been able 
to find the 5 gallon size which would be too small for 10 gallon 
brews.  Any advice on finding or converting to this style tun would
be appreciated.

Please don't use this as a forum to recommend I use a counterflow
chiller, I have my reasons for *not* doing that at this time.


I am currently using an immersion chiller and although I can drop the
temp of my wort from 212F to 100F in about 20 min, it takes another 30
min to get down to 75F because of the lack of temperature
differential. 


For those of you who recirculate ice water through an immersion
chiller, do you begin recirculation after using tap water, or do you
use the ice water right away?


What quantity of ice and water do you use for cooling 5 gals of wort?


For the thermodynamically adept in the audience, what would be an
equation to determine how much ice water at what temp would take how
long to cool how much hot wort?

My question is: do you just throw out the malt after these intervals, or is

or do you only find out after you've made the beer? What flavor profiles do 
beers made with old malt possess?

I know that when pitching lager yeast a larger population is 
required in the starter ...  someone on rec.crafts.brewing said 
you had to "feed" your starter over a number of days, by pouring 
out some of the old starter and putting in new wort with more 
malt.  


I understood from the yeast FAQ about washing yeast that the 
yeast that was sitting at the bottom of the flask is not viable, 
and the viable yeast is in solution, so by pouring out the older 
starter you are wasting only viable yeastie beasties ...  any

Hi y'all


I am going to attempt my first lager (I have a cupboard that 
stays at a nice constant 11 deg C).  I accidentally got a WYeast 
American Lager instead of a California (I sort of wanted Steam 
Beer sort of ..) has anyone tried this?  Is it good?


I am sort of set up to do an ale-type beer (is a Steam Beer more 
ale tasting than lager??), so what would a Coopers Ale Kit, 2 kg 
of Munich Malt partial mashed (+ a widdle bit of wheat) and about 
and ounce of goldings taste like??  Sh*t???  


I was planning a primary ferment for about a week and a secondary 
for about another two weeks, dry-hopping with some Styrian 
Goldings then bottling and lagering in my cold garage for a month 
or so.  


In order to get carbonation do I bottle, raise to 18 deg or so 
for a week and then lager?  Or is the yeast active enought at 4 
deg C (or lower) to carbonate the beer whilst lagering??  


Thanks muchly

Hello HBD,


I am a first-time poster and kind of new to homebrewing (8 batches since
Thanksgiving).  I am currently in the intermediate-type brewing mode - using
specialty grains for flavor, etc... extract for the fermentables, liquid
yeast, etc.


I just started batch 9 (preparing the starter), which is a Weizen.  I noticed
that the liquid yeast was a lager, at least I think so.  The HB store where I
got it (Heartland Hydroponics) has it Identified as B80 (Weizen (says
fermentation T=56'F) .  I believe that ther scheme is A## for ales, and B##
for lagers.  


Since I believe its a lager and I do not plan on lagering it (no room in the
fridge), is there anything that I should be aware of.  Will it be similar to
Steam Beer (fermenting wise - not flavorwise, obviously) or should I not have
jumped the gun.


Personal replies are fine, unless you'd like to share your wisdom with
everyone...

   Why not plug it in to 220 and give it more power? ARR ARR ARR!
   No, wait;  I have a better idea.  Your refrigerator is controlled
   by a thermostat just like the air conditioner in your house.  It is 
   actually just an on/off switch that is temperature controlled.  What 
   you need to do is bypass the thermostat.  First, unplug the 
   refrigerator (!), then find the temperature control knob (thermostat).
   Now remove the thermostat;  maybe it screws in, maybe it snaps in?
   Look at the back side of the thermostat.  You'll probably find two 
   wires.  Cut the two wires off, leaving long enough leads for 
   reattatchment in case you change your mind later.  Strip the ends of
   the two wires and attatch them together with a wire nut.  Check 
   your connection, make sure there are no dangling wires, and plug
   in the frige.  It should start running immediately and keep running.
   
   Now for the disclaimer:  By no means set the temperature controller
   to some ridiculously low temperature.  The refrigerator could ice up, 
   burn up, or worse yet... ruin your beer.  Even if your modified frige 
   seems to be working ok, you'll still be pushing it a little harder 
   than it was meant to be run.  It will probably wear out sooner than
   if you just left it alone... but nobody said that homebrewing was 
   cheap, did they?

Subject: Frustratingly Flat brown ale.




I brewed a 5 gallon batch of an American brown ale with Wyeast american ale
(chico) more than a month ago.  I racked to the secondary after a few days
and left it there a week or so before priming it in a bottling bucket and
bottling it.


I used 3/4 cup of corn sugar to prime which I boiled in water for 15
minutes before adding it to the beer (as usual).  I am sure I added it
because I almost forgot.  I realised just as I was lifting the bottling
bucket up onto my counter and poured it in a mixed it up.


In the 6 weeks or so since then it has been sitting in my kitchen at about 70F.


This was my 4th batch.  I had no problems with the first two.  The third
was a belgian ale that took a long time to carbonate.  I was a little
disconcerted that it took that one two months but not suprised since it was
a strong beer and it had aged for 10 weeks in the secondary.


I am at a loss to explain this one though.  It isn't too strong and it
didn't sit in the secondary too long.  There is yeast sediment at the
bottom but very little fiz in any of the bottles I have opened.


About a week ago I shook them all up a bit. Now I imagine the carbonation
is growing so things may be working out and the beer is tasty anyway.


Still, I wonder if others have had this problem with Wyeast American Ale.
Any hints, suggestions, sympathy stories?


Thanks.

This stuff is a real good Pilsener (I think it is in Jackson's Pocket Guide).

Beer types are very regionalized in Germany so talk to people before you go.
I agree with Jamie Magee that the Altbier in Dusseldorf is the best.  After
spending 2 days there several years ago, I had to drive to Kassel one night.
We arrived late and stopped for something to eat so naturally I ordered an
Alt to go with the meal. The waiter asked if I was sure I wanted an Alt and
I insisted I did.  After he came back and asked a second time, I asked my
German host if something was wrong.  He explained that in Kassel only women

I doubt there is any chance of contamination here, but just be careful
when you do this that the oily part does not come in contact with a
surface which beer will contact later.  You think you have it all 
cleaned out, but there is an oil film present even after you rinse with
your chemicals (at least if you try lysol, soap solution, hot water,
isopropanol, ad nauseum (like I tried with mine)).  The only way I
found to get ALL of the oily film out was abrasion with a lot of soap.
Similar to John, I had to snake a wire through a long section of 
tubing.  I used plain undiluted dishsoap for a lubricant, and it worked
pretty well, and has the plus of rinsing out.  BTW - I do understand
John's design in that the WD-40 only contacts the Water side of the
chiller, so don't flame me.

  Actually, the ~20% of malt syrup that is not fermentable is *water*.
Therefore, you will need to increase the amount of syrup to get the
same specific gravity as from DME. An easy rule of thumb is that 6lbs
of syrup equals 5 lbs of dry malt extract.


  As for the question of body, etc. etc., I think that there is a lot

Goose to be one of my favorite beers made in the states. Consequently, I'm

Goose. It's the delicate hops flavor that I enjoy so much. If anyone knows

Subject: water storage and immersing brewpots


Techno-brewers:


I've been learning the hard way to use already-boiled water for sparging.
        Can anyone recommend a good method for storing water, especially 
        the large amounts needed for extract-brewing?  I'm thinking of 
        just using plastic containers (either water bottles or a cheapie 
        fermenting bucket) but I know plastic is susceptible to oxidation 
        (which is probably not a bad thing since the wort needs oxidized
        before the yeast is pitched).  Can the water also be contaminated 
        by micro-organisms penetrating the plastic? 


Also, I saw a post the other day re: wort chilling by immersing the brewpot
        in a sink of ice water.  My stainless steel kettle came with an
        explicit warning NOT TO DO THIS because it can warp the pot.


Good brewing!
