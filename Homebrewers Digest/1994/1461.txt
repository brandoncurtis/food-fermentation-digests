Subject: Newbie Questions: Bottle Autolysis & Yeast rate?




Hi all!  I just brewed my first batch, a dark extract porter.  Had my
first bottle last night, and it was GOOD, reminds me of the Sierra 
Nevada Porter i used to drink in Santa Cruz.  *However,* I have
two burning questions whoch I can't seem to find the answers to in
either Papazian's fine book or the one issue (Summer '94) of 
Zymurgy in my possession.  Detecting a high signal to noise ratio
over the last month on this list (perhaps the highest on the entire
net), I'd like to ask them here.


1.  How long can my beer stay in bottles at room temperature?  I know
    the Papazian book says it's *ready* in 10-14 days, but do I
    have to worry about autolysis at some point?  This is an 
    important question, as the space in my small renter's fridge is
    at a premium.  FYI: It was a single stage fermentation and there
    is a definite white sediment in each bottle.


2.  The Zymurgy issue I have refers to a typical dry yeast pitching
    rate of 14 g per 5 gal., or about two packets.  I used 7 g, and
    have an Apparent Attenuation of 62%. Zymurgy says typical App.
    Att. values range between 67-77%.  Is mine low enough to be 
    worrisome?  Is the low pitching rate the cause of the low App.Att.?
    FYI:  O.G. = 1.058; F.G. = 1.022.  From lack of knowing any better,
    I handled the yeast in a thouroghly boneheaded fashion, throwing
    it into the carboy sans any rehydration at all - DOH!  Could this
    be a factor as well?  (I expect yes.)


Corrollary to 2.  Do y'all REALLY use 14 g yeast per 5. gallon batch?


As these are obvoiusly newbie questions, feel free to e-mail rather
than post the answers.  Thanks in advance, and merry brewing!

Subject: O2 Eating Bottlecaps


Oh, great...  Like we need something *ELSE* to worry about.  I was reading
The Celebrator Beer News and came across this story about oxygen absorbing
bottlecaps.


The author (Mark Garetz) starts the story by explaining to the brewfully
challenged that after initial aeration, O2 is not a good thing for beer
and explains why.  He then goes on to say:


"But you might be surprised to learn that air can get into the bottle
after it's capped.  Huh?  Doesn't the positive pressure of the CO2
keep the air out?  That's what I thought too, but I got the full
story from Charles Benedict at Advanced Oxygen Technologies (AOT).


"The material used as a liner in the beer cap (more correctly called
the crown) is a good CO2 barrier.  But since nitrogen and oxygen
molecules are smaller, they can get through the material.  They do
this regardless of the pressure inside the bottle through a process
called diffusion.  So after a few months there will be a significant
amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the beer that wasn't there to begin
with.  Nitrogen doesn't cause any problems, but we know what O2 does.


"Researchers at Zapata (a major crown manufacturer) and AOT tried to
solve the problem by making a liner material that was a barrier.
While successful in the lab, the material was not practical for volume
production.  Then they thought of binding an oxygen-absorbing material
into the plastic liner and this eventually proved quite successful."


"... (Oxygen absorbing caps) do cost a bit more than standard caps,
but they may be worth it if you're planning on keeping a beer in bottles
for a long time or to give you that extra edge in a competition.  (A
national judge told me that entries were stale and oxidized because of
the six-month lag between the due date for the prelims and the finals.)"


This kinda doesn't make sense to me.  If you take a gas-permeable balloon
and "inflate" it completely with liquid would you find air bubbles in
it after a few months from air diffusing into the balloon?


Also, the caps don't work indefinitely.  They first absorb the O2 in
the headspace of the bottle.  Are we to believe that still are able to
absorb the "significant amount of O2" that diffuses into the bottle?


Sorry about the long post, but inquiring minds want to know.

forget the apple puree, molasses, and brown sugar. use ~5-6 light DME,
stay with .5 - l lb crystal malt, and gput fuggles in for the entroe boil
(or maybe leave it out entirely).  use the new wyeast london ale yeast,
and drop the yeast out after the initial fermentation, ala-english-bitters
style, to leave that green-apple flavor (acetaldehyde).  dry hop with styrian
goldings.  I've made many a recipe like that that tastes like apple juice.
dropping out the yeast is the key, and the morris-handbury styrian goldings
hop plugs accentuate the "apple juice" flavor.  normally I use an oz or 2
of fuggles for the boil, but I've never tried spicing it, so it may need
to be sweeter (though fuggles is pretty low AA, and my brews are still
pretty sweet).  I'm thinking of trying something similar with a mead...


>However, my brother seemed to think that rather than an apple taste, this

yep. apples in beer don't produce an apple flavor - drop the yeast out
early with finings or refrigeration (or both).

I don't know about the "feedback" to the yeast, but your reasoning about
the headspace is incorrect.  1 litre of beer at a given psi/temp will
actually hold more than 1 of litre CO2 gas at the same psi/temp, beleive it
or not.  this is intuitively non-obvious.

I have had some ales that had a definate apple flavor to them.
However, I would imagine the fruity flavor is a yeast product
rather than the brewer using apples in the recipe.  Is this true?

I started homebrewing this past fall when the weather in Ohio
was much cooler.  Now after two batches that yeilded a pretty
good product (made from extract) my house is beerless and I'm
thirsty.  My problem is that I don't have a refrigerator or a
true basement to keep things cool during fermenting.  About the
best I can hope for, without sending my power meter into orbit,
is a downstairs temperature of 75-76 degrees.  Can I brew an
ale, porter, or anything else at these temperatures without fear
of off flavors?  Are there any yeasts that produce a good beer
(assuming all else is well) at these temperatures?

Greetings Brewers!

Fe> tried a commercial mead called Chaucer's and wasn't impressed at all.
Fe> Too sweet, thick and the flavor of cheap wine. Does homebrewed mead

I would like to answer with a referal to "The New Complete Joy of Homebrewing"
by Charlie Papazian.  I recently brewed his Barkshack Gingermead and after
only two months it is smooth, delicious, and so clear it dazzles.  It also had
a nice punch to it!  With regards to Chaucer's (which I've also had), this was
as dry as a Brut champagne, and had many other flavor similarities.  His
instructions for making mead are clear and simple, and he also provides an
interesting historical background.  Let me recommend using WYeast dry mead
yeast for this. (BTW, it's liquid yeast for dry tasting mead)


2)  Diacetyl Woes...


I've recently started kegging with a 'cornie' keg setup.  It was also my first
time using a refrigerator for lagering.  I made an Australian lager with
Cooper's extract. I primary fermented at 50 degrees F using WYeast - American
Lager for 1 week, then dropped the temp to 42 degrees F for a 4 week secondary
(this is because 42 is as low as I go with an Airstat.)  I then force
carbonated to 2.6 atmospheres (16 psi approx) using the shake method.  (NOTE:
after two days, I lowered the pressure and dispensed at 5 psi, and then left
the keg at that pressure for the remainder of the time.)


Now the problem, after about 3 weeks, I started to notice a distinct diacetyl
taste in the beer.  Another two weeks and the diacetyl was overpowering.
Fortunately, that was only for the last 1/2 gallon in the keg.  I have been
brewing with extracts for 5 years now and have NEVER had a this problem.  Any
suggestions?


Salut.

Jack, are you admitting to having bacteria in your beers? And at levels that
are present after submicron filtration?

I think something is amiss in technique if submicron filtration is not
resulting in a brilliant, clear product.  The Filter stores 5 micron , high
efficiency product will result in a very clear beer when properly used.
To do this correctly, one needs to cold condition the beer, and push the
beer through the filter at reasonable delivery pressure, say 5-10 psi. 
Add additional CO2 in the filtered keg, if the pressure is too low. 


It should also be noted that some taste panels have preferred unfiltered
pasteurized beers over the same sample that was submicron filtered (article
by Jim Koch, in the Brewery Planner).

Comparing string wound filters to pleated ones is a waste of time.  BTW,
I dont favor filtering as a normal part of homebrewing, its more work 
than its usually worth( good malts and aging and technique can create
very clear beers).

I guess corn starch is a good test if one if removing permenant starch 
haze from a poorly made beer.  I wonder how much this starch level has
to do with anything found in regular beer samples.

If the numbers you reported are accurate then your tap water must
be about 72.6F.

It is much better to use the ice water at the end.  Actually it would
be best if you could use ice water for the entire time, but this would
require more ice.  Lets suppose that after the temp was brought down to 
100F, you began pumping in water at 32F.  If you pumped at the same rate,
it would take you only 5 minutes 38 seconds to reduce the wort from 100F 
to 75F.  If, however, you used 32F water for the first 5 minutes 38
seconds, the temperature of the wort would have decreased from 212F
to 146F, and you would need another 42 minutes to reduce the
temperature to 75F using your 72.6F tap water. In summary
you can reduce your wort temp to 75F with your immersion chiller
in the following times


50 minutes   -  Using 72.6F water for entire time.
47.6 minutes -  Using 32F water for first 5.6 minutes, then 72.6F.
25.6 minutes -  Using 72.6F water for first 20 minutes, then 32F.
17.6 minutes -  Using 32F water for the entire time.


>What quantity of ice and water do you use for cooling 5 gals of wort?


This depends on what your flow rate through the immersion chiller
was.  In the above example you would need enough water at 32F
to last for 5.63 minutes.  For each gallon of water at 72.6F you
will need about 0.4 gallons of ice which should be melted in the
water to yield 1.4 gallons of 32F water.


>For the thermodynamically adept in the audience, what would be an
>equation to determine how much ice water at what temp would take how
>long to cool how much hot wort?


The formula I used to analyse your immersion chiller was


T(t) = Ti + (T0 - Ti) * exp(-R*E*t)


where   T(t) = the temperature of the wort at time t.
        Ti   = the inflow temperature of the water in the chiller.
        T0   = the initial temperature of the wort.
        R    = the normalized flow rate of water through the
               chiller (actual rate divided by volume of wort.)
        E    = the efficiency index of your chiller (E=1 means
               the temperature of the water at the exit of the
               chiller is the same as the wort, E=0 means 
               you forgot to immerse the chiller in the hot wort.)


Alternatively, the time required to reduce the temp from T0 to Tf is
given by solving for t.


    -1       Tf-Ti
t = --- log (-----)
    R*E      T0-Ti


For your setup the product of R*E = 0.08134.  You need to measure R
to determine your efficiency E explicitely.  The amount of water at
Ti required would be 


A = t * R * Volume of wort.


By the way, on my last batch I actually did pump ice water through
my immersion chiller and it worked great.  No, I wasn't so
compulsive to actually measure the exact amounts used and my
efficiency, but I went from 100F to 68F in under 10 minutes.

Subject: Why use a Lauter Tun?


Well that was a loaded question, wasn't it?
The question occured to me Saturday night when I was over at Gordan Biersch in
Pasadena having another Marzen. (Good Beer; don't know how true to style it is,
but its definitely a Good beer).
I was looking thru the glass (the window, that is) and asked the barkeep if the
one on the left with the hopper was the Mash tun (yep) and the other is...(the
Lauter tun). Which left me thinking that most brewerys I have toured have
seperate tuns for mashing and lautering, while most homebrewers (well, >33%)
using the same tun for Mashing/Lautering with very good results and, it seems
to me, better economics of time. Obviously, there must be a good reason for
having seperate tuns.


Would anyone be able to offer some insight into why large(r) scale breweries
use the seperate tuns? Do you know what the (grain/filter bed) system is for
large scale lautering? False bottom, perhaps?

Subject: O2 scrubbing, preboil? keg definitions, 8.16 gal.


 From *Jeff* Renner 
 
Erik Speckman points out a mechanism that I hadn't considered in the "CO2 
scrubbing out dissolved O2" thread: dissolved O2 diffusing into the CO2 
bubbles which carry it away.  Thanks for pointing that out.  It's a neat bit 
of reasoning that I will retain.  I suspect that in fermenting wort, 
however, that will never have a chance to occur.  I think the yeast will 
probably metabolize the O2 before the CO2 gets to saturation. 
- ---------- 
Phil Brushaber doesn't want to preboil his water, but it's tasting of 
chlorine now that it's summer, and he feels that since he does a full wort 
boil anyway, won't that take care of the problem?  Not necessarily, Phil.  
You should get the chlorine out first to avoid the formation of 
chlorophenols when you boil the wort.  These nasty tasting guys are 
noticeable in the ppb range and, I think, are suspected of being 
carcinogenic as well.  Try letting the water sit overnight;  the chlorine 
should outgas. 
- ---------- 
Sean Rooney confesses: he is keg illiterate.  The barrel-shaped keg you 
bought, Sean, is one of the old style Golden Gate, Hoff-Stevens or similar 
kegs (I don't know the subtle differences).  Some breweries still use them.  
They are tough to convert to boilers, etc, because you have to weld shut the 
hole in the side, but it's been done.  I'll leave that part of your question 
to someone with experience. 
 
But as for definitions you wanted:  a Sankey keg is the new (15 yrs?) 
cylindrical keg.  Among their advantages is that they need no wooden bung to 
seal them since they have only one opening for filling and tapping, and they 
are more convenient to tap.  Their cylindrical shape makes them easier to 
roll, too (see below).  They are sealed with a ball valve and draw tube 
device that the breweries never remove.  They just inject hot caustic and 
rinse, but homebrewers usually remove them for cleaning (and dry hopping).  
A Sankey tap is the device that fits into the sealed opening to depress the 
steel ball and allow beer to be drawn and CO2 injected.  (I have also seen 
the seal/draw tube called a tap, and have called it that myself.  There must 
be better a better term for this.)   
 
A pony keg is the term for the old 1/8 barrel, or 3-7/8 gallon keg.  They 
are almost extinct, although the Stevens Point Brewery in Wisc. at least 
recently would fill them on special order.  They told me that the few they 
sold were mostly during haying and harvest seasons, when farmers would put 
them out in the field for the help!  Some people call 1/4 bbl. kegs pony 
kegs, but that is not historically correct.  There are now new 1/6 bbl. 
Sankeys (5-1/6 gal) that could be called that.  (In Cincinnati, where I grew 
up, those little corner beverage stores are called pony kegs.)  The only 
place I've seen full barrels (31 gal.) is in the old brewing cities where 
the breweries still use old style barrels.  They weigh about 300 lbs. full.  
When I was a boy, we enjoyed watching the delivery men roll them down a ramp 
into the local tavern cellar using straps to hold them back.  I don't know 
if full bbl. Sankeys are made.

Subject: Colorado Brewer's Festival


The 5th Annual Colorado Brewer's Festival was held Saturday and Sunday in 
Fort Collins Colorado.   37 of Colorado's megas, micros, and brewpubs brought
out their best for a day in the sun.


I only attended Sunday which was a blistering 104 degrees and my focus was on
beers that I have not had before.  It's would be too easy to drink my
favorites but I was looking to expand my horizons.


   Bristol Brewing Company
   4740 Forge Rd.
   Colorado Springs 


   Bristol's Red Rocket Pale Ale
   A malty brew with a nice hop flavor and nose.  A rich red color and well 
   balanced.  This was a very enjoyable IPA and was an excellent beer to start 
   the fest with.






   Carver Brewing Company
   1022 Main Ave.
   Durango


   Festival Raspberry Wheat Ale
   A nice tart fruit beer.  The raspberry flavor was perfect for my taste, not
   too much or little and slightly malty.  A very nice summer beer.  This stuff
   went fast.






   Durango Brewing Company
   3000 Main,
   Durango


   Anasazi Wheat
   The server mentioned this was more of an ale than a wheat and she was
   right.  This was very hoppy beer without the clove/banana character I enjoy 
   in a German-style and too hoppy even for an American wheat.  This was the
   IPA of wheats.






   Heavenly Daze Brewery and Grill
   1860 Ski,
   Steamboat Springs


   Steamboat Scottish Ale
   A very nice Scottish ale that's a little bit hoppy for the style.  My
   favorite Scottish is still Odell's 90 Shilling but this is a close second.






   Hubcap Brewery and Kitchen
   143 E. Meadow Dr.
   Vail


   Boysenberry Honey Ale
   These guy's know how to make a very nice honey beer.  One of my favorites
   from the 1993 GABF was their Killer Bee Honey Ale but Boysenberry Honey 
   top's that one.  A very well balanced fruit beer that not too sweet but 
   perfect!  This was a very close second to Phantom Canyon's for my best of 
   show.
   




   Lonetree Brewing Ltd.
   375 E. 55th Ave.
   Denver


   Sunset Red Ale
   This beer was a tad bit bitter and didn't have the hop taste or aroma I was
   looking for but a very drinkable beer.






   Phantom Canyon Brewing Company
   #2 E. Pikes Peak,
   Colorado Springs


   Phantom India Pale Ale
   MMMMMM good, hops central!  This is my pick for best of show.  A excellant
   example of an IPA, well balanced and highly recommended!






   Pikes Peak Brewery
   2547 Weston,
   Colorado Springs


   Red Granite Amber Ale
   This beer was a bit hard to place into a style catagory.  It was more of
   a brown than an amber but too hoppy with a hint of clove.  Sort of the
   IPA of browns.






   Tabernash Brewing Company
   205 Denargo,
   Denver


   Alright, alright at the end of the day I had to breakdown and drink one of 
   my all time favorites, Eric Warner's Tabernash Weiss.  This is a excellent 
   example of A German style wheat with a bit a clove and banana character.

I REALLY appreciated Martin Lodahl's comments about the 
classes being offered by UC-Davis's Dr. Lewis.  I think
these sorts of candid comments about the usefulness of
particular vendors is invaluable.  I was curious about
these classes, but will save my $ thanks to Martin.


On a related topic, is there anyone else who is frustrated
with the lack of timely response when dealing with the
AHA?  Every time I call, write, or whatever, it takes what
I feel to be an inordinate amount of time to get a response.
As Zymurgy is supported by advertising, tests are self
supporting, etc., what exactly is their problem?  A good
resource, a good concept, horrible customer service.  Just 
an opinion, thanks for letting me vent.


After reading ALL the mill stuff over the last couple of
months, I bought a jsp Maltmill(tm).  While I think Jack
is sometimes too defensive, this is a truly fine product.
Quality construction and an excellent crush.  I am satisfied.
Standard disclaimers apply.


Finally, sincerest thanks to all of those who take the time
to post such thoughtful, insightful and technically valuable
material to this forum.  I honestly believe this is the best
brewing resource on the planet.

When I went to Germany 1 1/2 years ago, I wasn't sure about just how much
you were allowed to bring back.  From an earlier vacation to Mexico, I
knew a possible limit was 2 liters/person, but didn't know if Europe was
different or not.


I opted to bring as much as I could carry in carry-on, act stupid and
innocent, and offer to pay any duties necessery.  When we went through
the X-ray at Munich, I could *clearly* see all of the 22 1/2 liter bottles
of beer I'd backed (laboriously, each in it's own sock w/sweaters stuffed
around them), and got a little nervous.  Not a word was said, though, and
neither was anything said at Heathrow (where I got X-rayed twice; can you
say 'paranoid'?) and nothing here.


>When I ran my carry-ons through Gatwick security in London, the security

They didn't even do this for me.  At Munich they made me shoot a picture
with my 35mm camera to "make sure it worked" (although it only clicked;
any semi-intelligent terrorist would make a fake camera with a fake click),
but nothing else.  Nobody anywhere said a word about the beer.


>officer I had canned sugar and beer, and he smiled and said go on.  A piece of

I don't think I even had to say anything to customs; like I said, I was
going to act stupid and innocent and offer to pay whatever if nabbed.


The worst part was carrying a ~75lb carry-on bag through three airports.
My right arm was 2" longer when I got home!  :-)


As for what beers to get, just go to the local liquor store/beer dist-
ributor and get a couple each of the styles you like.  Go for the stuff
you can't find in specialty stores in the US.  Also only buy beers you
know you like, or at least like the style.  I ended up with a couple 
black beers that I wasn't thrilled with, and could have gotten better
stuff worth the effort.


Next time I go to Europe my carry-on will have wheels!

Subject: white ring in bottle neck/dry hopping/apple beer


Help:  I just bottle up my 12th batch, a weizen a few days ago-> when I looked
at the bottles this morning, every bottle has a white ring around the
neck...have I finally infected a perfectly (?) good batch of beer?  I looks
like crystals, not the usual scum that you see from bacterial infection; the
beer is absolutely clear, what gives?  I used:


6.6# Northwestern Weizen extract
1 oz Cascades (boil)
0.5 oz Saaz (finish)
Wyeast #3056 - no starter


fermented 7 days in primary; 7 days in secondary...
Any suggestions, comments would be appreciated; I won't throw this one out
'tilI try a couple...
******************
I tried my hand a dry hopping a while back - used 0.5 oz Cascades in a batch
of CP's Rocky Racoon Honey Lagar; a couple of months has passed, and I got the
effect that I was hoping for - it tastes a lot like Anchor Liberty Ale - a
nice hoppy slap on the tongue!! :)  A caveat to anyone thinking of dry hopping
however; be sure that your beer has enough malt to stand up against the
increased hoppiness that your beer will have.  Rocky Racoon is a very light,
not-too-malty beer; the Cascades come very close to overpowering the beer.  It
has also taken a couple months for weird flavors to vacate the beer-> at first
it smelled skunked, then very astringent, it is now turning into a real
winner, albeit the hoppiest beer I have ever made!
****************
Someone recently talked about trying to make an apple (pie) beer; I might
suggest adding the apples to the secondary, not the primary.  Fruit added to
the primary seems to get totally fermented out, leaving only sour tastes
behind. If you wait and add the fruit to the secondary, there will be less CO2
to scrub out the fruit smell, and more alcohol to extract estery flavors from
the fruit. It's worked for me with rasberries, blackberries and peaches.

Was asking about : Making a strawberry of apple beer


>I want to make an Ale, light to medium in color (not dark or stouty
>looking)


Well, I don't know if you just don't like darker beers or if you just
want to make a light beer because you want the fruit to come through,
but most of the light/pale based fruit beers I've had were really
rather "soda pop" like.  At the risk of over simplifying I'd say that
at least a solid amber base is needed to say "beer" rather than "wine
cooler".  That being said, strawberry and apple are among the hardest
fruits to get to stand out in a beer.  The flavors are subtle once you
ferment away all the sugar.


>Should wheat malt be used?


I think most people do, but mostly for tradition's sake rather than
because it makes a difference to the final beer (other than killer
head retention).  The breadiness of a wheat beer is likely to be a
subtle contribuition in these beers.  Now if you are fermenting
with a weizen yeast.....that's different. A strawberry weizen
actually sounds quite tasty, especially in the 112F heat we've been
having this week.


Ok, You asked for a recipe.  Here's an apple one.
5.75 lb. Klages
2 lb.    Munich (use german rather than domestic if possible)
~15 IBU Liberty or Mt. Hood or Crystal or Hallertau hops beginning of boil
 I use whatever has the lowest AA% in the store.  You want enough hop
 for antisepsis, but you don't want bitter.


Boil down to get a 3 gallon batch (OG should be somewhere around 1.060-65)
chill and top up to 5 gallons with 2 gallons of apple juice or cider
that hasn't been treated with sulfer or whatever they put in most of the
grocery store stuff.  Gravity of the juice I get is usually about 1.055.
I don't think there's anything you really want from the apple pulp, the
juice will work better.  For real apple pie effect try a little bit of
cinnamon or "apple pie spice".  When I've made this I used 3 sticks of
cinnamon steeped in hot cider and mixed the two when they reached equilibrium
temp.  I also use 1/4 to 1/2 lb. of Scottish (80l) crystal, but that may be
darker than you like.


Strawberry weizen would be easy.  Just take your favorite weizen recipe
and rack over the top of ~8 lbs of frozen strawberries in the secondary.

My feeling here is reality is that most of the
corny/firestone kegs were not legally aquired.  Since the
soda giants have completely given up on these kegs (100%
here in CA at least) and gone to those bladder pack syrup
things that they don't really care.  The soda folks have
by now sold most of their inventory to scrap yards, at least
that's where I see them.  So when I pick one up from the
metal scrap yard am I getting one that was dumped on them
by the coke plant or one that they get through less formal
channels.  I doubt that the scrap dealer knows either.

Doug Trainor asks if he should try making mead if he didn't like
Chaucer's


I say go for it.  I was judging meads at the S. CA Renaisance
(never could spell that) Fair.  We were judging next to one
of the concession stands that was selling this mead.  Aside
from the two horribly infected meads entered, Chaucer's would
have scored dead last.  Bland weak and too bloody sweet for
that gravity.  you can do better.  Just remember to let it age
for at least 6 months, a luxury that Chaucer's clearly does not
have.
- -------------------------
And finally (about time) a question:


I'm going to try a Dutch lager and since I can't do anything simply
I want to take a whack at doing a mixed mash like the Big Boys do.  The
most specific reference that I have (Miller's Continental Pilsener) says
to use "corn grits".  Well, I can't figure out what he means.  I can
find "corn meal" and "hominy grits", hominy being (my wife says) corn
that's been treated with acid or lye or something to partially break
it down.  Is this what I want?

In Martin Lodahl's description of Dr. Lewis and his brewing classes, he

I think) "produced some of the most horrid beer on the west coast."
I wholeheartedly agree.  His beers were disgusting.  I went on a little
tour of the brewery with the manager of the pub.  All of the equipment
looked fine, but the manager mentioned that they didn't fiter their
water like Sudwerk does.  Big mistake.  Davis has some of the most
heinous tasting water on the west coast.  I believe the carbonate level
is around 500 ppm.


And we all know what bad water does to your beer...

I sent that last post out before I was done.


I ordered 6 kegs from them at the old price.  3 arrived in couple of days. 
 The other three were "lost in shipment".  After numerous calls and two more 
shipments I finally received the other three.  By the time I included all 
the phone charges, They probably cost me over $15/each.  Several times in 
the course of trying to obtain the last three, St. Pat's said they would 
call UPS to track them and call me back with the info.  They never called me 
and seemed quite irritated when I called them concerning these lost kegs.


Once I finally got all 6, it turned out one had a leak in the bottom. 
 Unfortunately I discovered this when I was pressurizing it after I had 
filled it with an American Brown Ale.  I probably lost half a gallon on the 
floor.  They had told me they pressure tested them but this one must have

 Figured I'd be money ahead just to take my business somewhere else.
