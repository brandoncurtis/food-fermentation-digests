Subject: Wort Priming


When I brewed up my latest batch,I had the need to skim a little wort off of
the top to prevent overloading my measley 3 gal brew pot.  I have saved the 3
cups of raw wort (sg=1.072) because I thought that it would be a good idea to
use it to prime when bottling time comes around.   With that, I air the
following questions:


1)  Do I have enough (volume-wise and sugar content-wise) to prime
adequately?  (I am brewing a weizen).


2)  I can assume that nuking the "starter" 'till it boils is a good idea to
kill any nasties.  Am I correct?


3)  Can someone furnish the formula to determine the approximate sugar
content of the "starter" so I (and others) may be able to find out how much
wort to use in the future?  I figure that planning on making a little extra
wort at brew time might be a good idea. 


I would appreciate any reply as, I'm sure, a few others on the HBD.
Thanks,

This probably isn't strictly speaking the place to post this ..  
but ...  what the hell!  


Canberra (ObAustralianFact: The Capital Of Australia) has at last 
got a brew-pub ..  the Wig And Pen.  Not only that, they are 
making English style beers, serving them at cellar (12 degC) 
temps and they have English Beer Engines to dispense them!  Happy 
happy happy, joy joy joy!  They claim they are the only brew-pub 
in Aussie serving beer this way ...  and it is 10 mins walk from 
where I am sitting ...  fantastic!  


ObBrewingObservation: The English Bitter they make (which is the 
only one I have tried so far) had a very nice hop (cascades) 
aroma, they get this from just _ONE_ hop addition, 1 kg at the 
start of their boil ...  they have no late addition, hop back or 
dry hopping.  I expressed my surprise and they informed me that 
it was due to the freshness of the hops. Thar ya go ... any 
comment?


Some may remember that I am fermenting a sort of bastard ale / 
lager thingy at the moment, well it hasn't cooled down as quickly 
as I had hoped and has spent at least a day fermenting at about 
17 degC Will this produce all sorts of horrible Esthers etc from 
my WYeast American Ale yeast?  


Thanks muchly for your perserverance

Hello all!  I received several replies regarding how to dry-hop, and
I'd like to thank everyone.  So, I brewed a honey lager abd I added
1 ounce of Williamette hop pellets to the secondary.  It has been 11
days, and the hops are still floating on top!  Someone said that
they will fall out and sink to the bottom.  How long do I have to wait?
I know that I should probably relax, don't worry, have a homebrew, etc.,
but I wante to know how long it should take for the hops to settle out.
Yes, next time I'll use a hop bag...
        Thanks to anyone who can answer my question.  See Ya!!

        Not to mention the fact that the partial pressure of a gas 
dissolved in water is related to (usually directly, CO2 being the obvious 
exception) the partial pressure of that gas at the surface.  Thus, as the 
O2 is purged from the headspace in the carboy, the O2 will diffuse out of 
solution into the headspace, where it will be forced out through the 
airlock.  Yeast scavenging helps a lot too.


        And speaking of headspace, Erik Speckman goes on to say:

        Which sounds great, but doesn't explain the commonly observed 
phenomenon of overfiled bottles being undercarbonated and underfilled 
bottles being overcarbonated.  That's the wonderful thing about science.  
So much of it seems so bloody counterintuitive...

Subject: Fusels, stuck fermentation


Ok, I admit it. I'm frustrated. Two of my last few batches have had problems 
with fusel alcohols. They've both had fairly high OG. I believe I know what 
happened to the first batch. It was a dubbel, and I used Chimay yeast which I 
cultured from bottle dregs. The problems there were (probably) under
pitching and fermenting at 66 degrees. Now I know better. The second batch was 
a weizen. It had an OG of 1062. I used Bretek cl-920 German Wheat yeast which I
grew up from a slant. The grain bill was 70% wheat, 2% Munich, balance pils.
I made a _huge_ starter, having learned from the problems with the dubbel.


Over the weekend I tapped the keg of weizen. The aroma was wonderful, until I 
got a whiff of the fusels. The terminal gravity was 1018. I expected alcohol, 
but not the hot alcohols I got. In every other way this is a very good brew. 
I'm frustrated over the fusels, though. I just reread George Fix's article in 
Zymurgy, but it didn't explain the problems I had with the weizen. Is there 
possibly a problem with proteins form trub? It is frustrating to have a very 
good brew spoiled by high fusel levels.


The other problem I'm having is a stuck fermentation. I have an IPA sitting in 
secondary right now. I took the gravity when I racked to secondary (6 days),
and the gravity was 1020. Not bad, I thought (OG was 1056). I checked the 
gravity again yesterday (now two weeks on), and the gravity was 1030. I should 
also mention that I dry hopped in secondary with 2 oz. of Kent Goldings. The 
dry hopping explains some of this, but in general, I'm puzzled. I used a 
massive starter (half gallon slurry) of good yeast. This is an 8 gallon batch.




Any help would be appreciated. Private email welcome.

Hi, I started to brew a pilsener extract last night and when I opened the 
top to the malt extract there was three packets. One being the dried 
brewers yeast, the second being a brewers yeast nutrient, and the third 
was a packet (25ml) of Isinglass (sp?). When should I add this stuff? I 
was going to add it when I rack to the secondary, is this correct? I 
added the yeast and nutrient last night around 7pm and by 7am I had a

Subject: Non-beer ferment time


Hi folks - 


I am trying out a recipe gotten out of Cat's Meow II for something called Sima,
which is a "Finnish homebrew" based on sugar water and lemon peel & lemons
(OK, OK, I admit it - I thought maybe it was the basis for Zima! No flames, 
please - I can't help it if I like it and it's not BEER!).


The recipe says to only allow it to ferment for 1 - 1 1/2 days before bottling.
My yeast has only barely SNEEZED after 2 days. I haven't bottled it yet - any
suggestions on length of time I should wait? I was wondering if the high acidic
content could be interfering with the yeast activity (it has finally started to
be more active now).


Suggestions please!

Part of the reason is that bigger brewers need more vessals.  In many
traditional German small breweries the lauter tun also doubles as the
whirlpool.  The bottom of the lauter tun is constructed with the 
tangential wort inlet, for a whirlpool.  Bigger breweries, like Old 
Dominion need a completely seperate whirlpool. Even bigger breweries 
like Sierra, have a dedicated mash tun, dedicated lauter tun and
dedicated kettle.  This arrangement effectivly increases production
volume by one third, since the next mash can be doughed in while the
previous ones are marching through the other vessals. 


Think about it another way, if a small brewery uses a combi mash/lauter
tun system, and the brewer is lautering, where does he put the sweet
wort?  Its gotta go somewhere.  The other issue is in larger breweries
one wants to do temperature controlled step mashing and this is more
difficult to do in a combi unit.


False bottoms come in two flavors, perforated sheet and V-wire.  Perf
sheet is OK for small enough systems, and I am quite fond of the 
performance I get out of mine.  V-wire is something I really wanted
to add, but then I found out how expensive it is!  V-wire is sheet
SS, fairly thick, with the V pointing down.  THis helps in the flow
through characteristics of the lautering process.  The 'V' runs along
in several inch long troughs, they do not transverse the entire 
lenght of the sheet.

He wasn't the only writer on the matter.  But try the experiment yourself.
Next time you bottle, fill a third of your bottles to the 1/2" - 1"
recommended by Charlie P.  Fill another third nearly to the top.  Leave a
huge headspace in the final third.  After conditioning, sample one of each
on several occasions.


I've never run such a carefully controlled experiment, but I have observed
that overfilled bottles tend to develop less carbonation than the 3/4"
fill which is most convenient with my filler (when I try for any more, I
wind up with an overflow).  And the last, underfilled bottle of the batch
seems to develop a LOT of carbonation.


I've noticed a couple of postings which suggest that fill level shouldn't
make a difference.  Obviously, there is something missing from the
discussion.  What is it?  Fellow chemists -- any ideas?

Not knowing where you live I don't know what brand names you have available.
In North Carolina and all the Southern states there are several brand names
of grits.  Quaker (as in Quaker Oats) brand is fairly well distributed. They
make white grits, but if you can get them the yellow would most meet your
brewing needs.  The white ones are corn that has been bleached.  Living here
in Ill (no grits) and having grown up having grits, eggs and sausage for
breakfast I much prefer the yellow ones.  You don't even want to come close
to hominy which is exactly what your wife said.  You may ask your grocer if
they can get the Quaker brand yellow.  If not I'll try the MOM and DAD
pipeline for you. Post or E-mail direct is fine.

Subject: Wheat extraction


   Hello all,


   I recently attempted my first weizen which was also my 6th all grain
   batch. My first 5 were all infusion mashes using English pale malt and
   with my system (picnic cooler with a Phil's Phalse Bottom(tm)) I was
   obtaining extraction rates of 28 sg-pts/lb (measured after the boil).
   The weizen was not only my first mash with ANY wheat malt as part of the
   grist, much less the predominant part, is was also my first use of
   Belgian pilsner malt. It was also my first step-infusion mash.


   Anyway, I was able to hit the first temp with relative accuracy with
   only a 2 degree overshoot and a mash PH of 5.6-5.8 (I can never read
   those PH papers any better than that). This was the protein rest temp 
   (124F for 30 minutes, I wanted 122F for 30 min). When I added the 
   boiling water to reach my sacch. rest temp of 150F, I misread my 
   thermometer, thought I had undershot and kept adding more boiling water. 
   By the time I had realized my mistake I had a very thin mash with a 
   temperature of 154F.


   I let that go for 1 hour and sparged. I ended up with a starting gravity
   of 1.036 when I was targeting 1.053, which, by my usual calculations, put
   me in the ballpark of 20 sg-pts/lb for an extraction rate.


   I used 6 lbs of German wheat malt (malter unknown) and 3 lbs of Belgian 
   pilsner malt (DeWolf-Cosin I believe). 9 lbs of British pale in my
   system would normally give me a SG of 1.050 using an infusion mash.


   Anyway, I want to retry this and get it right. I am appealing to the
   collective wisdom of the HBD as what the possible cause(s) of my 
   seemingly low extraction rate are/were. According to Miller's extraction 
   rate tables wheat malt is supposed to be higher by a few points than most
   pale barley malts (at least with his system).


   I can't help but think that the problem is systemic in nature but if I
   have to just up the malt I'll do it. Is German wheat malt or wheat malt
   in general usually have this dismal performance? Will a too thin mash
   dilute the enzymes too much? Should I have just let the mash gone

That is still a very good price.  Kegs in retail stores go for $25 for
one in horrid shape to $40 for ones in good shape, to $50 for one in
pristine shape.  At the price of $15 each, snap up all you can while
they last.  IMHO, St. Pats' was underpriced the last time they had a
load of kegs and they are now in the comparable price range to the
best prices ever around in the past.  Still a good deal.

Some of you may recall several weeks ago I posted about my first batch 
being VERY bitter. Well, I drank it anyway. After getting used to it, I 
could almost say I liked it. I made batch #2, a Petes Wicked Ale clone 
(kind of) and after primary of 8 days, secondary of 10 days and 5 days in 
the bottle, I just couldn't wait any longer. I put a couple in the fridge, 
and popped em on Sunday. Hold the phone Martha, it was goodddddddddddd!!! A 
taste of coffee, smooth, undercarbinated (Well.....impatience). I LOVE IT. 


I also bottled my 3rd last night. It was the first recipe again but this 
time, with 1/3 the hops. Tasted the (okay, drank) hydrometer sample. and 
again good. Very light, it's for hot sweaty gulping beer days. just a touch 
of bitter, and a nice after taste.  Is it possible??? Have I brewed 2 good 
beers in a row????? Am I batting .666?????? Tune in again in a few weeks, 
Same Bat time Same Bat channel.............


Also, just a hint from a new guy. Don't try and bottle and watch a good 
movie at the same time. I was watching the conclusion to Gettysburg and 
kept over filling my bottles during Picketts Charge. Oh well, so little 
time so much to do.

I am yet another very dissatisfied ex-customer of St. Patricks of Texas.  I 
ordered three of the ball-lock kegs for $33.  This was the first time I had 
ordered from St. Patricks, and will definitely be the last!   After a three 
or four week delay, I received three pin-lock kegs, and was charged the 
higher price that those kegs went for.   When I called to complain, Lynne 
said she must have heard me say pin-lock when I ordered, and couldn't I use 
the pin-locks anyway? (I later learned from discussion on rec.crafts.brewing 
that others have been shipped pin-lock kegs instead of the ball-locks that 
they had ordered).   I then explained to her that I already have a setup 
with hoses/connectors hooked to a 3-keg distribution manifold, and have no 
use for pin-lock kegs.  Lynne said she would send me replacements either 
that day (4/25) or the next, and requested that I return the pin-locks ASAP 
(Interestingly, I had to correct her when she said she would be sending me 3 
pin-lock replacements).  At this time Lynne also told me that she would 
refund me the difference between the pin-lock and ball lock kegs, and 
reimburse my expenses in shipping the kegs back to her.  I shipped the 
pin-lock kegs back on 4/27, and on 5/17 sent Lynne email asking where my 
ball-lock replacements were.  The kegs obviously had not been shipped to me 
as promised. She finally replied on 5/23, saying: "I haven't received any 
kegs from you and I ran out of kegs to send.  I will send you 3 more kegs 
today, but I need you to check with UPS to find out where your kegs are...". 
 I checked with UPS, who informed me that the kegs I had shipped had in fact 
been signed for by an R. O'Connor at the St. Patricks address on 4/29!  I 
mailed Lynne a copy of the signed receipt ticket that I obtained from UPS. 
 It was at least a week into June when I finally received the three 
ball-lock kegs, so for the second time the kegs were not shipped when 
promised.  I still have not been refunded the price difference or my 
shipping expenses.

Before I ask my questions, please don't consider me flame bait.
I am merely appealing to your collective expertise:


1. Although I've brewed app. 10 batches from extracts, I never see the
"hot break" of flocculating particles.  Is it important?  How long do
extracts REALLY need to be boiled?


2. It certainly is more convenient to brew a hop tea for an hour to add
the bittering hops than it is to boil the hops in the wort (less messy).  
Any problems with doing so?

   I think something is amiss in technique if submicron filtration is not
   resulting in a brilliant, clear product.  The Filter stores 5 micron , high
   efficiency product will result in a very clear beer when properly used.


Jim, you are forgetting that "microns are not microns."  What some
stores sell as a .5 micron filter are much closer to 5-10 microns.  My
 .5 micron filter is nowhere close to a real .5 microns.  Actually I am
quite happy with that fact.  I don't want to filter my beer to .5
microns and my ".5 micron" filter gets my beer mostly clear but not
exactly sparkling (unless the beer is almost completely clear to start
with; which is not the case with my non-flocculating yeast).  This was
discussed by George Fix in this group as well as at the convention.
So, all this arguing about what size filter one needs is nonsense
until we get some universal rating system.


In conclusion, everyone with .5 micron filters don't worry about this
nonsense about overfiltration.  Filter your beer and decide by *taste*
and *look* if your beer is being over filtered.  These blanket
statments about certain micron ratings being correct and others too
fine does not work out in the real world.

Good question.  Actually, as more and more air diffuses into the
ballon, the concentration of air in the water goes up.  As the
concentration goes up, the rate of diffusion into the balloon falls
(diffusion rate is proportional to the concentration difference).  The
concentration of air in the water will only approach its saturation
level, but go no higher.  Bubbles won't form until the concentration
is at (or above) saturation, so bubbles shouldn't form in this case.

It's funny how people's tastes are different - I thought this stuff was

a good mead.  This was the only brew at the festival I had trouble finishing.
The honey was definitely not fermented out yet, I think it would be a great

Subject: Filters - Air/Beer




On the subject of filters...


For those of you that have access to scientific "stuff" (ie. SP/Baxter 
Catalog) there is an air filter for sterile air/gas filtration that is
excellent for in-line or sterile venting applications.  It is pressure 
rated to 75 psi (bidirectional) and removes 0.3 micron DOP particles at 
99.97% efficiency.  This is a Gelman product that cost $112 for 24 filters.


What good are these?  Well...
1) Wort aeration.  Instead of these other contraptions that I have seen to 
sterilize air/O2 (ex. charcoal w/ cotton, peroxide in a flask), these vents 
will do the trick and they attach right to the air line.  BTW, there are 
also gas dispersion units available that are disposible and reusable.


2) Venting Yeast Starter Flasks.  When cooling down wort for the yeast 
starter -- these vents can be attached so that the air that comes in when 
the flask is cooling (prior to pitching) is sterile.  I suppose that they 
could also be used for the primary fermentors prior to yeast pitching.


3) CO2 gas lines -- enough said




To G. Fix, J. Busch, and others who filter there beers:


I am looking for a good way (cheap/fast) to filter beer between my 
secondary (which is in a corny keg) and my conditioning keg (also corny).  
The beer is carbonated in the secondary (spundig) and can either be room 
temp. or refrigerated.  Is there a 3 to 5 micron filter out there that is 
reusable? Will it work with carbonated beer?  I would like to get some type 
of cartridge that I can use pressure from my CO2 tank to push the beer 
through, then can be cleaned for reuse.  Do they exist?


All the ones that I have seen are single use.  If I am stuck with a single 
use type -- which is better; a pleated filter, activated carbon, or a 
string-wrapped type?  I have seen a carbon type that would do the job, but 
it gives no indication whether or not it can be cleaned out for future use.


TIA

I am currently planning my switch from extract to all-grain and have some 
quesstions regarding equipment to purchase.  I have read the all-grain 
faq but still have some questions.


Mash/Lauter Tun:  I am thinking of a round Gott type of cooler with 
either a strainer/grain bag or manifold which will drain out the modified 
spout.  Are there definite advantages/disadvantages to either?  What size 
cooler should I get?


Cooker:  I have seen the King Kooker for $50 with 170,000 btu but I am 
concerned with the stability of the tripod.  I found a Cache Cooker for 
$70 rated at about 100,000 btu which looks more sturdy.  What btu rating 
should I look for?  Does anyone have a distinct preference?


Brewing Outside:  I live in an apartment and will have to brew outside on 
the patio.  If I use a screen to cover the grains and then the wort will 
I be ok or is this a really lame idea?

Subject: Old style kegs, Beer through customs


As a followup to Sean Rooney's question and Jeff Renner's nice answer to it,
I recently (1 1/2 months ago) saw the "old" style kegs with the wooden plugs
being used quite a bit in the UK for cask conditioned ales.  Gives ya
something to think about, eh?


Specifically, I saw these kegs used at the Caledonia Brewery in Edinburgh.
I also have pictures of a cellar at a bar in Edinburgh where some of the
wooden bungs are visible on the kegs.


On a related note, while touring the Caley (the local lingo for the
Caledonia), I saw their old traditional wooden floor maltings.  The
building was not used for malting anymore, but was only used for storage of
their malts.  Well, Rich Fortnum (who was a rather good host, I might add,
Have you recovered from my visit yet, Rich? :*] ) tells me that last week
the whole building burned to the ground!  Ouch!  Did someone say "smoked
scotch ale"?  (couldn't resist :-) ).  It's a shame.  It was really nice
to see that old building and think about the history of brewing in that area.

As to getting beer through customs, I brought 41 bottles through London

The few I couldn't fit in the carry on went into one of the suitcases packed

glasses.  I planned to pay any duty, but never could find any place on the
forms to declare it, and nobody asked.  It was *real* obvious that I had
a load of beer as I gingerly carried it through the airport.  It generated
several nice conversations with other travelers.  None of the customs guys
questioned it at all.

and a release valve on the other.  Just like those that are commercially
available.  So my question is, what do I do with this?  I hook it up to
the gas side of my keg, and I get a reading on the gauge.  So?  Can it
be used for anything else?  What do the readings mean?  If the keg is
too full, I get liquid and foam backed up into it, but it seems to be
easily cleaned.  Help me out.  I've got a new toy, but don't know how to
play.

Subject: Brewing methods


My wife and I have made 57 five gallon batches since Jan of 88.  One got
infected and got tossed. 2 were bad tasting, 1 virtually undrinkable.  The
rest have ranged from so-so to sublime, mostly in the very good to excellent
IMHO (3 blue ribbons in 2 years at Siskiyou County Fair). Our goal is one
batch per month (we both like to drink a six-pack or so per week). I've done
ales and lagers, and extract, extract/mash combo, and all grain mash brews.
I'm sharing this mostly to find out if anyone else approaches things
similarly or if my methods raise eyebrows or perhaps solve a problem for a
novice. 






Biggest improvements since I started?






- --purchase of a 9 1/2 gallon brewpot (Vollrath, William's Brewing, Box 2195,
San Leandro, CA, 94577, 800-759-6025).  Boiling the whole wort is a must!






- --a big propane stove from Camp Chef with 100,000 BTU/hr and a smaller
30,000 BTU/hr burners (got it at my local gas company)  






- --use of liquid yeast (Wyeast "punch n' grow" packets, available from lots
of places)






- --a refrigerator dedicated to beer






These set me back a few bucks but it was worth it.  I'm just a schoolteacher
so its not impossible for the average Joes out there.






Extract:






Boil one hour with hops, my preference is with whole Cascades,  usu. 3 oz. I
steep (pre-boil) adjuncts in a nylon straining bag.  I don't have wort
chiller so I let the boil sit overnight (covered in a food grade plastic
bucket) and pitch the yeast the next a.m.






It ferments in my closet at a steady 65-70 deg. F for 10 days to two weeks,
sometimes I switch to a 2ndary but I'm into "easy." I don't usually dry hop
'cause its messy, tho' it can be a nice addition.  I prime with 2/3 cup
table sugar boiled in 1 qt. water. The bottles go in the closet for 1 week,
then to the fridge.  Two weeks at about 35 deg F and we drink.  I've had 'em
4-5-6 months later and the "lagering" is excellent.  Clean, clear, smooth,
yummy.






I use Wyeast "American Lager" in the cold months and either the "Bay Area
Lager" or "CA Ale" in summer.  I've made traditional "ales" with lager yeast
with excellent results.  Primarily I brew to my tastes and don't give much
of a hoot about "style", except for my annual St. Paddy's Day Stout (and
I've also used lager yeast here with, again, exc. results).  I guess my
beers are "steams", hybrid ale/lagers.






Mash:






I only mash in the summer, when I'm off school and have time to play around.
 Again, we are into steady production and an "easy routine."  I get 2-3 gals
of tap water (we get good stuff around here) and heat to 180 deg F. It goes
in a Gott cooler with spigot with 10 lbs. of klages 2-row in a nylon
straining bag.  Stir, wait one hour.  Mash temp about 154-156 usually.
Sparge with sun-warmed 5 gals tap water into brewpot.  I use a "solar
shower" hoisted up above the mash tun, it has a nice spray nozzle.  All the
rest is the same.






This summer I plan to do a few wheat beers, wish me luck!

In Toronto, a popular choice is the Belgian strong ale 'La Chouffe'.

Subject: Wyeast "Steinbart" strain


I was at my local homebrew shop the other day, picking up the ingredients for a
new batch.  The shop owner (whose advice I have found to be extremely good)
recommended I try a new Wyeast strain, Steinbart (I believe #1021).  He said it
is another American ale strain, and that it is currently in only limited
distribution.  Does anyone know anything about this strain?  I decided to use
it, as I have never gotten bad advice from the store before, but I'm just
looking for any info on this strain that is out there.
