Re:  Michael Lewis, UC Davis Brewing Professor






Several posts have mentioned this man and his classes.  I took an
inexpensive one-day workshop.  He's very interesting and informative, tho'
not without his somewhat "heretical" ideas that can piss off the homebrewer,
micro-brew or import connoisseur.  He calls Bud a "splendid" beer, finds
"styles" and fussing about "ales vs. lagers" dated and silly, says "trained
tasters" can't distinguish "body" (or at least have widely divergent
perceptions of it) in a beer and blind tests have revealed most homebrew
wisdom about putting "body" in beer to be unscientific.  He spends a lot of
time on mash theory, hop utilization (if you don't boil for an hour you
won't convert the alpha acids to iso-alpha acids, the "desirable" bittering
agents), and other intriguing elements of beer science and lore.
Worthwhile, I think, and I like the fact that he challenges some
"conventional wisdom".  He doesn't have to be your guru, y'know, just a good
teacher.






I was influenced by Dr. Lewis in two areas:






1)  He instructed us to first master the "pale beer" and use that as a base
to create higher gravity and darker colored brews with adjuncts.  He
encouraged us to proceed slowly, changing one thing at a time.  That way we
could more easily identify the steps in the process and the ingredients that
affected the flavor.






2)  He repeatedly emphasized that beer brewing was personal and the only
palette we had to satisfy was our own.  Pleasing judges in a contest could
be gratifying but its not the same as brewing for personal satisfaction.  He
felt contests were to tied up in traditional categories and that this was
too limiting, it was important to brew good quality "beer", not such and
such ale or what have you.  He was challenged by several students on this,
and he relented somewhat, saying he wasn't opposed to contests, just that he
didn't want us limited to only brewing traditional styles.






The course included a tour of the Davis brewing facilities and an informal
repast with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Anchor Steam.  As I said, I learned
quite a bit. I still refer to my notes, and had a good feeling about the
whole experience.  An intermediate brewer could benefit greatly.  I don't
want a brewing course that simply reinforces my prejudices about beer, I
hope I'll come away arguing with some of what I heard as well as with
material I can put to use immediately.  After all, our avocation is a
wonderful blend of art, craft, science, history, tradition, technology, and
personal bias.  I hope we never subscribe to *anyone's* gospel on the "the
only way to do it."

Subject: bud malt  etc.


Recently, a brewer-freind offered me some FREE grain, and of course, I accepted
gladly.  It is Great Western #1202, which I was told is specifically mashed
for AB.  I brewed a one-grain ale with 10 lbs.  The 1st runnings were light
straw-colored, lighter then I'd ever seen, and the end runnings were the
color of Zima while still containing noticeable sweetness.   I got a decidedly
poor hot break but my SG of 1051 was in-line with my normal extraction.
I'm having fantacies of brewing a bud-colored barleywine.


Can anyone tell me something difinative about this stuff ?  Is it realy
Budweiser malt ?  Is it fully modified ?


Speaking of Bud... a rdaio ad I keep hearing has got me wondering... does
anyone have a recipe for that Opaque Pumpernickel Stout ?  I'm particularly
interested in how the beef bullion is added.  Should I use only the first
press of that ingredient  ?    :)

Subject: Questions on Beer Styles?


I am a little confusted on the way to create a beer recipe. I 


have looked at cats meow and other similar recipe bases and 


have noticed that many different beer types have the same 


exact ingredients. HOw can this be?


 


How can a Pale Ale have the same ingredients as an India Pale 


Ale or a Pilsner?  Or how can a Porter have the same as a so 


called Stout?  


 


What ingredients determines a beer style?


 


I have Suds v3.0 and using the recipe formulator, I pick a 


style of brew I want to create, but how do I know what malts 


to use?  I could take Pale Ale Malt add some crystal to the 


proper color of beer according to the program. But what hops 


make a beer a different style that another.


 


If I took Pale Ale Malt and made an IPA, or took a PAle Ale 


Malt and some Wheat malt would it still be a IPA.  


 


According to SUDS all I do I guess is match the color, HBU's 


and gravities to make a style of beer?  This seems to easy. 


How can just changing a beers color, change the beers style?


Or adding 1 of 2 more HBU do the same?


 


Any input is appreciated, post on HBD for others to read!

I have a King Cooker and you are correct in your assessment of the tripod.  I
never trusted the thing.  It is poorly designed and doesn't fit well enough to
be useful.  I solved this problem with my trusty Black & Decker Workmate (tm).


When I brew, I set up the workmate with a small piece of sheetrock to protect
it and fire everything up.  Works great and they're useful for many other
things around the house.


As to BTU capacity, I wouldn't worry about it too much.  I have never come
close to opening up the King Cooker to full throttle - I fear it would burn a
hole in the bottom of my keg/boiler.  It would certainly lead to scorching
problems at the very least.  


IMHO, it is much more important to look at these stoves from the perspective of
how well they distribute their heat rather than how much heat they can produce.
 In other words, is the flame localized or well distributed?  Is there a flame
difuser on the stove?  Distribution of the flame will significantly reduce
scorching of the wort.

John Horzepa <jhorzepa`at`radiomail.net> asks about "Steinbart (I believe
#1021) ale yeast."


I don't know about the Wyeast number - I've never seen it numbered
before. My local homebrew store is supplied by Steinbarts, and usually
has this stuff in stock.


What I've heard: This is a single mutation from Wyeast 1056, Chico ale.
The owner of Steinbarts likes it more than 1056, and had it cultured and
packaged just for his store by Wyeast. It is supposed to be highly
attenuative. 


What I know: I've used this for at least a dozen batches of beer. It is
very reliable, and flocculates well. It doesn't like cool temperatures -
make sure to ferment at least in the high 60's or it will be very slow.
Below ~75 degrees this yeast ferments very clean, with few esters. I've
never fermented above 75, so I don't know how it performs at high temps.


It performs well if you pitch onto the dregs from a previous batch.


It makes a nice sweet mead, dying at about 8% alcohol. 


It is my house yeast - I like it.

For most beers, priming raises the SG by about 0.004.  For a weizen, you
probably want a bit more, up to 0.006.  Assuming your finishing SG is
1.012, you have 0.060 worth of fermentables in the saved wort.  But this
will be diluted when you mix it with the beer.  If you dilute to make 1
gallon, you'll get:


     0.060 points  x  0.1875 gallons  =  0.01125.


Dilute that to make 5 gallons:


     0.01125  /  5  =  0.00225


This is not sufficient to prime your beer.  You would need more like
7-8 cups of 1.072 wort for priming.  But you can still use this wort
as about 40% of your priming, and supplement with your normal priming
ingredients.  If you do use it, make sure it's sanitary.  If it's
been sitting in a jar in your refrigerator with just a lid on it,
you should boil & cool before using; wort like this is ideal media
for growing all kinds of beer spoiling organisms.

It's also got the word "stout" on the bottle.  But I think it's part

Subject: re: Chili Beer




I have made several chili beers now, so here's my $0.02 worth.


I have found that almost all of the chili flavor/aroma and heat is scrubbed 
out in fermentation.  A chili in the bottle _can_ heat up a beer, but the 
final heat level will be quite unpredictable.  Chilis in the bottle or in 
the fermenter should be _BOILED_ at least ten minutes, (20 is safer) in a 
small quantity of water in a covered pot.  They will remain whole, but lose 
firmness.


The best technique I have found is to boil 1/2 to 1 pound of halved 
Jalapenos (adjust amount for pepper variety) in a half gallon of water in a 
small covered saucepan for about a half hour.  After cutting them in half, I 
remove the seeds from about half the batch.  Calibrate this extract by 
putting a tablespoon in a cup of beer and tasting.  With the peppers I get 
around here, 1-1./2 - 2 tbs is about right.  Then use this extract to top 
off the carboy at bottling/kegging time.  I just put the requisite amount in 
the keg, and fill on top of it.


I have gotten the best results with a lightly hopped pale ale, but have no 
objection to the lager (cave creek) approach.   When done right, there is a 
wonderful chili  nose and light chile flavor, enough bite to be assertive 
without being unbalanced or downright painful.

I've used this strain on my last 3 IPA. The slurry from the primary of the
first, was repitched on hte second batch. The slurry from the primary of
the second, was used on the third. Nice attenuation, ferments well at 70. 
I did a side by side comparison of the 1021 and the 1056. It behaves and
tastes like the Wyeast 1056, except maltier. I'll use it again.  I bought
mine from a shop in New Jersey.

Subject: Altbier yeast (not again!??)


In reference to the question of what is the "real" Dusseldorf yeast, I
finally got a chance to speak with Dave Logsdon.  Officially, W1007 is
the altbier strain, and originated in Dusseldorf (apologies for the
missing umlaut).  David said that, indeed, this is a very fluffy, poorly
flocculating strain, although it *will* flocculate (more or less)
eventually.


He agreed that, in a commercial setting, this provided some problems.
Most breweries simply cannot wait around for the yeast to settle, which
can take weeks.  However, he did offer some suggestions, particularly
useful for homebrewers.


1. Give it time.  Homebrewers have a real advantage in this regard, as
they don't have customers (well, there's always the occasional thirsty
spouse) wanting the beer NOW and don't have a lot of expensive equipment
tied up.


2. Use finings.


3. Rack the beer.  According to Dave (and judging from personal
experience with other yeasts), racking after primary fermentation will
go a long way toward helping the remaining yeast flocculate.  I gather
this is a particular issue with the cylindro-conical fermenters so
common among microbreweries.


He also agreed with my notion that the dynamics inside a bottle are
different than those in a large tank.  Given a bit of time, even a very
fluffy strain should flocculate once the beer is bottled.

My first posting to the HBD and it's a brewpub request.  Oh, well.


I'll be traveling to Durham, North Carolina July 8 and will also be 
spending a few days in Pinehurst, NC.  Any recommendations on 
area brewpubs to try?


Also, all this talk of the marvels revealed through all-grain brewing has 
this new brewer poised to take the plunge.  Okay, so I'm actually 
thinking of doing one or two more partial mashes first, followed by a kit 
beer or two to get confidence at its highest peak, then maybe daring to

Yes, that's about right.  Different extracts have differing
amounts of water in them.  Alexanders has more than most,
but most of the rest are about 20% water.  Dry malt extract
starts out between 3% and 6% water and can, as Brian said,
absorb a lot of water out of the air.


As I said before, not all extracts are the same.  Some contain
corn sugar or other sugars.  I've limited my use to several
extracts with which I've had good luck (Northwestern, Munton & Fison,
Ireks, John Bull, Alexanders and Laaglander) and I know the
approximate fermentability of each.  Note that, contrary to
what Brian wrote, dry malt extract is not close to 100% fermentable.
Wort made with Laaglander Dry is only about 55% fermentable
(apparent attenuation) whereas M&F is more like 70%.  Note
also that yeast plays a role in this too, some yeasts being
more attenuative than others.

Well, malt syrup will tend to get darker and pick up oxidation flavors
(sherrylike) as it ages.  Cooler temps help reduce this effect, warmer
tend to oxidize it faster.  At refrigerator temps, I would imagine you
could keep syrup for well over a year without much flavor degredation.


Uncrushed malt, kept dry and cool, can stay fine for well over a year.
I've brewed with two-year-old DeWolf-Cosyns malt which was stored at
60-65F in new, gasketted, thick, white, HDPE buckets and the beer turned
out very well.  Stale grain can taste grassy, musty, moldy, phenolic and/or
metallic (due to oxidation of lipids) and will impart similar flavors to
your beer.  Again warm temps and higher moisture will speed staling.
One very vivid example of the effect of moisture is the fact that two
brewing seasons ago, I stored my DeWolf-Cosyns CaraPils malt in one of
those 5 gallon HDPE buckets I mentioned above.  By the end of the brewing
season, the malt smelled very phenolic (like bandaids) and tasted similarly.
This last season, I threw a canister dessicant into the bucket with the
grain.  Last week, the grain still smelled and tasted as good as new.
Note that CaraPils is very high in moisture in terms of malts (twice as
high as some malts by the same mfgr), so this effect is most profound
in CaraPils, in my experience.


Crushed malt should ideally be used within a day or so or it will pick up
water (turn slack).  Within a few weeks it be noticably stale unless it
is stored in a moisture-proof package (immediately during the humid summer).

As many others have explained, CO2 does scrub dissolved O2, but also
it scrubs out aromatics (malt, hop and fruit) so:


        to maximize malt aromatics, I would venture to guess that lower
        fermentation temps should increase malt aroma,


        to maximize hop aromatics, use dryhopping and add them after
        virtually all the CO2 has evolved, and


        to maximize fruit aromatics, again, wait till most of the primary
        ferment is over (the fruit will have its own ferment also, but
        what can you do?).

I believe Charlie was the one who popularized this theory (?).  In my
own experience, a large headspace increases the carbonation in the finished
beer a significant amount, but a very small headspace doesn't decrease
the carbonation much at all.  I have not tried NO headspace.


Pierre-- if you could find out more about this and maybe relay our
observations, perhaps that prof could give us a better explaination?

I agree regarding the Phantom Canyon, but must disagree on the Hubcap.  I
found it much too sweet (as if they added raw honey to the keg) with lots
of honey aroma and flavor, but absolutely no boysenberry.


Frankly, the best beer I tasted in CO was Jim Liddil's Best-Of-Show pLambic
(and I had Boon Gueuze on the Crazy Train (thanks ?) and Hansens pre-1983

Not to worry.  At 17C (62F), Wyeast American Ale will produce a very
un-fruity ale.  With this yeast, you need to get up into the 20-22C
range to get significant esters.

I wouldn't wait.  I'd siphon now, but you may want to attach a scrubbie
and a hop bag over the end of the siphon.

I wouldn't use a hop bag -- I'd use whole hops instead.  Even with a
hop bag, a significant amount of hop pellets will still come through
the bag.

As you said later in your post, break material has been implicated by some
to increase fusel levels.  Note also, that both ester and fusel alcohol
production is also increased by higher-gravity worts and by higher-temp
ferments (also remember that fermenation is exothermic and a high-gravity
wort will generate a lot of heat -- that's the mistake I made with my
1.087 Chimay yeast banana/model_airplane_glue beer).

I'm not sure how long you need to wait after adding the Isinglass, but
it should be added when fermentation is over.  It will take most of the
yeast out and unless you want a high-diacetyl beer, you want to make
sure that the yeast has had a chance to re-absorb the diacetyl it made.
Note also, that working with powdered Isinglass is a great deal more than
just sprinkling it in.  It needs to be prepared in an acidic solution
and rehydrated over a period of several days.  I suppose you could
redydrate it in finished flat beer (for the acidic solvent), but I've
never read step-by-step instructions for use.  Pre-mixed, liquid isinglass
is available from homebrew supply stores, but must be refrigerated after
preparation or will become useless.  Does anyone have detailed instructions
for preparation and use of isinglass?


********
There were a couple of question on fast ferments (like 1-2 days).  This
is not uncommon in warm weather, especially with dry yeast.  The result
is a highly estery beer with elevated fusel alcohol (solventy) levels.

I would like to thank all the brewer's out there who responded to my calls
for enlightenment. Thanks to you I will be able to refine my process while
still keeping things as simple as possible. The major points I got were to
1) Quit worrying; 2) Watch my temps before pitching my yeast; 3) Don't
rehydrate so long; 4) Short ferment times are not unusual; 5) Beer can sit
in the primary longer than 1 week; 6) After bottling a month is a
reasonable time to wait for the beer to carbonate up.


Thanks again!


By the way I tried a bottle from batch #1 last night. Nice flavor! Low
carbonation which I have been assured will improve with time!

I suppose I should add my St.Patricks experience in with the rest...I
ordered three ball-lock for $33, and two o-ring sets for about $3/set.  A
week later, I got the three sticky, smelly, partially syrup filled tanks
strapped together with tie-wraps and duct tape.  After searching for the
receipt, I found it stuck on the sticky side of the duct tape.  Carefully
prying it off, I could barely tell that they had charged me $16 per set for
the o-rings which were not included at all.


Several phone calls and a month later, my o-rings appeared and the credit
was issued for tha "accidental" overcharge.


Another note...


I was in Portland this weekend, and saw the "amazing warehouse o'kegs"
which Jack StClaire had mentioned (and called about-thanks!).  It is truly
an awesome sight, although not a sankey to be found amongst the probably
two thousand there.  The guy didn't know how much to charge me, so I didn't
buy anything...


At the Bridgeport Brewery there, I asked for a tour of the facilities, and
was told rudely by a blond manager-type guy that Sunday is the day for
tours.  When my friend (a Portland person) mentioned I would be returning
to CA on Sunday, he said that had he known that, he wouldn't even take me
around at all.  I was not impressed by the level of service or attitude,
but the hand-pumped cask conditioned ale, and the xx stout were wonderful. 
Thanks for the leads...

Hi y'all


Thanks to everyone who replied to my post (it was quite 
overwhelming - I feel like I am in a "virtual brew-club"!).  


I assiduously replied to everyone who mailed me .. Phew!
But Mark Childers, your address just bounced when I replied,
not sure what happened there, so indulge me and I'll include a
few personal comments tha might be off general interest:


* Aidan, it was interesting reading your letter on HBD about the brewpub
* in Canberra.  Is the brewpub thing big down under or just starting?


I think it started, stopped, and is starting again.


* How about in other parts (Darwin, Perth).  


Well I have only been to Perth for 2 days but I it has the 
original Matilda Bay Brewing Company place, in Freemantle.  They 
make a sort wheat beer and quite a nice dark lager (thy don't 
call it a bock) called Dogbolter.  They have expanded their 
brewpubs, so there is one in Melbourne now, and ther is also the 
Geebung Polo Club in Melbourne too (haven't been there).  I 
haven't been to Darwin (it would be a bitch brewing there - very 
hot).  


Sydney has three brew-pubs that I know off, and they are all 
within 10 mins walk of each other in The Rocks.  Scharers has the 
nicest beer, they have a bock to DIE FOR!  All brewed using 
strict Reihengiwhatssit.  


* I was in N.Z. for some time and the availability of fresh, 
* english style beer was a real treat.


I am from NZ, Palmerston North to be precise, and I never saw a 
english style pub (cask conditioned hand pumped etc).  I never 
really liked most of the mega-beer in NZ either.  Where were you 
living in NZ?  Didya enjoy yourself (I am rather proud of my 
little country).  


The main reason for this post was:


* Some may remember that I am fermenting a sort of bastard ale / 
* lager thingy at the moment, well it hasn't cooled down as quickly 
* as I had hoped and has spent at least a day fermenting at about 
* 17 degC Will this produce all sorts of horrible Esthers etc from 
* my WYeast American Ale yeast?
                     ^^^
Sorry this should have been Lager yeast ...  sorry for the 
confusion, even I am not that stoopid to worry about Ale yeasts 
fermenting at 17 degC.  


I have racked the lager to a secondary, it seemed ok so fingers 
crossed.  I dry-hopped with Styrian Goldings (1 oz of whole hops).  


We'll see how it goes.  I should also say that I tasted my first 
stout using WYeast Irish Ale, only my second beer with liquid 
yeast, and it is beaut!  Even after only 10 days in the bottle, 
it is a full tasting beasty, but will age very nicely I think.  I 
would highly reccomend the use of Liquid Yeast, both the Wheat 
(WYeast Wheat) and the Stout I have done have been good, and 
definitely lacking that homebrew tang.  


* Rick Gontarek (gontarek`at`ncifcrf.gov) asked:
*
* Hello all!  I received several replies regarding how to dry-hop, and
* I'd like to thank everyone.  So, I brewed a honey lager abd I added
* 1 ounce of Williamette hop pellets to the secondary.  It has been 11
* days, and the hops are still floating on top!  Someone said that
* they will fall out and sink to the bottom.  How long do I have to wait?


Whole hops don't sink, they float, the pellets sink. This is ok,
just rack your beer out from under the hops, I think a hop bag
will reduce your efficiency (is that right??).


Later

Subject: Summary of replies to lager yeast questions


In yesterday's HBD I posted some questions about my first-ever experience with
lager yeast, in particular Wyeast's Czech Pils strain.  I was concerned about
the really long lag time and sluggish primary fermentation I am experiencing. 
The replies I received had several points in common:


1.  Lager yeasts, generally speaking, do not ferment as spectacularly or as
quickly as ale yeasts.  Apparently a normal primary fermentation for lager is
10-14 days, with 3 weeks not at all uncommon.  The concensus is that my rate of
airlock glugging (one glug every 6 or 7 seconds) is nothing to worry about.


2.  A larger yeast starter was a universal recommendation.  I used a 1-quart
starter for this batch; next time I intend to use at least a half-gallon
starter -- maybe even 3 quarts.  One responder suggested that I ferment my
starter at the same temperature that I intend to conduct the primary
fermentation of the actual beer at, in order to avoid weird
temperature-differential effects.  This is advice that I intend to follow.


3.  Most responders suggested starting fermentation at ale-ish temperatures,
and to move the beer to a cooler environment after active fermentation is
evident.  I have mixed feelings about this advice.  Miller writes that this
technique will result in the production of more diacetyl than the yeast can
later reduce.  He goes on to say that the "correct" way to shorten lag times is
to pitch a larger starter.  I know that many HBDers consider Miller a little
anal, but I do not share this opinion; I intend to do things his way unless
experience convinces me otherwise.


Many thanks to those gallant souls who replied!  I especially liked the way you
all (or almost all) closed your messages with assurances not to worry and that
my beer would be great.  There's nothing like a little good HBD karma to set
your mind at ease!


Jay.

I just read Jon Higby's response to the information requested on St Pats, and I

someone asked you for information on a topic, and you did not agree with it,
would that then be a 'complaint'? You appear to feel that way. If you will

dollars and ordering with St Pats. I still feel that way. But if you dont
agree with the information presented, dont label it a complaint, label it
as information, and be a man and accept your flames, be responsible for what
you speak in a public forum.

Saw the posting on chilling beer with a copper coil, and thought I would add
my comments. I have been doing so for about 2 weeks now, and have done some
experimenting on obtaining optimum results. My current setup, which I am happy
with, uses 18 foot of 3/8 OD copper tubing wound in a oval shaped 2 layer
coil, shaped to lay flat on the bottom of my 10 qt 'lunchbox' cooler. I chose
the laying flat position to minimize the consumption of natural resources,
being ice. I used 6 foot of beer line to come in to the cooler, which is a
bit long for line pressure drops, as I need 9 psi in the keg to get the same
results as 7 psi usually did for me with the cobra head tap, but is necessary
for placement of the keg on the floor and cooler on the countertop. Results
are good, I dont think you could pour a pitcher from this, but a 12 oz glass
works fine. To adapt to the end of the copper tubing, I used chrome plated
brass fittings ( I believe available from Foxx ) and ground the plating
off of the tubing insert end of them so I could use lead free solder to
attach them. Need more details, EMail me. I tried using shorter copper
lengths, but found less than 10 ft to be completely unacceptable.
