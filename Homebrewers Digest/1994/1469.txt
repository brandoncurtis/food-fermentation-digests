I have a problem. I'd like to subscribe to 'Brewing Techniques' magazine, but
I've only got their toll-free 800 number. Why is that a problem you ask?
Well, I live in the UK and we can't call US 800 numbers from here. So...can
anyone email me an address or non-800 number for 'Brewing Techniques'? Also,
while I'm on the subject of being zymurgically challenged by living in the
UK, can anyone recommend US homebrew suppliers who are prepared to export to
the UK; I'm mostly interested in (small) equipment/accessories.

Brewing at work...


I work at a very progressive (re: fun) company which has weekly small 
gatherings where beer (and softdrinks) are consumed.  Unfortunately the 
only beer that is served is the typical large commercial Budmilloors type 
(IMO crap beer -- Sorry Dr. Lewis).  These usually have small turnouts (gee 
 - I wonder why?)  Every 4 to 6 weeks we have a large get together 
(theme-type), sponsered by one of the Companys'Departments, where we get 
microbrew (Yeah!!!) if the sponsoring Department wants a good turnout.  
Once a year we have a company-wide Homebrew competition (_big_ turnout) 
sponsored by our Fermentation Dept.(makes sense).


A few of us "fun" people have approached our Human Resource Dept. regarding 
supplying the weekly gatherings with homebrew that is employee brewed.  The 
company would finance the ingredients and the equipment, and we would 
supply the labor.  They have been receptive to the idea.


This leads to many questions --


Initially, the beer would be brewed off-premise and brought to work by the 
brewers.  However, we were wondering what issues would have to be addressed 
if we wanted to brew on-premise  [Note: we are not concerned with liability 
issues of drunk employees since they already supply beer at these 
gatherings and the company supplies a taxi cab for employees who may imbibe 
too much (very frowned upon -- most are mature enough not to get carried 
away).


SINCE THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION, WE DECIDED TO ASK THE COLLECTIVE HBD 
WISDOM ON THE ISSUES THAT WILL COME UP AND WHAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF.


For reference:
1) the company is in California
2) this beer is not sold -- only given away
3) in the future produce more than 200 gallons per year may be produced 
here at work, but not by the brewing individuals in their households
4) what kind of licenses would be required for a company to produce beer to 
be given away to their employees -- agencies to contact?


We are interested in comments on issues that we may not have foreseen, but 
please do not guess at answers to these issues since it would only cloud 
the situation (like the current thread on headspace carbonation)


If this were a business to sell beer to the public this would be clear cut, 
but I have a feeling that lawmakers may not have thought of this type of 
event occuring -- any help?

This hop character boil duration chart is taken from the Rocky Mountain
Brews,
May/June From an artical by Keith Wanless.I found it to be very helpful,
as I like my beer rather hoppy in most cases. This is pretty basic and
probably
foolproof. You'll still need to figure out your HBU's and amount of hops
yourself to meet your style criteria, but if you know when and in what
amounts
that you need, or like to experience hop character in your beer, then try out
some different durations.


I'd also add though, that the amount of your boil has something
to do with the amount of your hop bittering  character exctraction. Maybe
someone out there knows the amount of liquid needed to utilize all of the
oils in, say 1
oz. of XXAlpha hops?

Before trying to shed some light on the questions raised, there may be a
vital piece of the puzzle that's been missed by all (Gee how I love a
sweeping statement!).


The low-fill bottle may have the differing amounts of CO2 than the high (or
'normal') fill bottle - IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PRIME. Those who prime in
individual bottles & DON'T COMPENSATE FOR LOW-FILL, those who DO
COMPENSATE, & those who PRIME IN THEIR BOTTLING BUCKET.  I present to you a
can of worms...


Is it possible that people who have different experiences with
under/over/normal carb., also have different priming styles?


Back to Suurballe's questions:
>I'm confused by this whole thing, so maybe you could answer two question's:
>1)  How was the over-carbonation of a low-fill bottle perceived?


I can see that at a given headspace pressure there is more gas to escape
from a larger headspace, possibly giving the impression:  "Gee, that's alot
of gas!".  But I perceive over-carb. as excessive foaming in the bottle as
it's opened, & likewise when pouring.


>2)  How can it be that there is more CO2 per unit volume in beer than in the
>headspace?  How much more is there?


I really shouldn't attempt this one, given that I've previously displayed
my lack of a firm grip on pressure vs. amounts vs. solubility (Thanks
Cushing Hamlen for pointing that out!)  But I will say this:


                                 CO2 - very soluble?

     I would say that there is a risk of exploding bottles if you prime. It
sounds like this is the end of a matured batch as you say you have some beer
"left in a keg" and so priming should be unneccessary anyway.

I just started all-grain brewing with a Gott setup.  I bought the 10
gal. so I would have no regrets. <g>  Actually, I wanted the flexibility
to someday brew a 10 gallon batch... which I think is possible in a 10
gallon Gott.  Gott also makes a 7 gallon.  Buy either the 7 or the 10.
I paid $39 for the 10 gallon at Builders Square and will soon buy the 7
gallon for holding sparge water.

Very easy for me (born lazy).  I simply bought an EM (easymasher) from
Jack S., I removed (unscrewed) the Gott cooler spigot, I forced a 3.5
rubber stopper on the EM by removing the SS screen, pushing on the
stopper and then replacing the screen.  To install, just stick the
stopper in from the inside. So.. for a little over $60 and about 5
minutes of work I feel I have a deluxe 'cooler' mash/lauter tun.  I read
about this setup here in HBD.  It works well and I am very pleased with
the results.

Subject: Lagering in Cornelius Keg


I need a little help in the procedure for doing a Lager- in a Cornelius Keg.
 I am an experienced ale brewer using  partial mashes- but as the summer
temperatures reach a point where my A/C will not keep me comfortably
in-range, my thoughts turn to a lager.  I need an outline of the process for
doing a primary in the Stainless keg- as the glass carboy is too large for my
beer fridge.  


Is this the process- and please offer corrections...
Prepare wort according to normal methods- begin primary ferment using lager
yeast in "normal, i.e., room temperatures- about 75 F, after a day or so-
transfer to fridge temps. after fermentation slows to a stop- lager for
several weeks more- then bottle/keg as normal- using residual yeast in
suspension- at room temps again for a week or two- then cool for drinking--  


what did I miss? Questions? how to deal with blowoff if I use a Cornelius
keg?  do I rack to secondary after the initial room temp starting period? or
what? how long will the fermentation take at fridge temps- call it 40
degrees?


what else?
thanks

Subject: carbonation & headspace


I've been thinking about this issue.  I agree that it seems unlikely
that a larger headspace actually causes higher carbonation levels.
But there must be something about it that causes the PERCEPTION of
higher carbonation.  Here's a couple of possibilities:


1. Louder PFFFFFT when opening the bottle.  With a larger headspace,
   there's MORE gas under pressure, so more gas will escape in the
   initial rush when you lift the cap.  The gas that's in solution
   comes out more slowly, and doesn't even start until the pressure is
   relieved.  With zero headspace, you'll get no pffft.  With a big
   headspace, you'll get a lot.


   Anecdotal evidence: I opened a bottle of beer last night that was
   filled essentially to the brim.  Very small pfft.  But when I
   poured it, I got a huge head (it was a wheat beer).  Interestingly,
   I didn't get the "gushing" that I'd observed in bottles with a
   lower fill.  Which leads to:


2. Somehow, the gas rushing out in the initial PFFFFFFFFT from a large
   headspace disturbs the beer so that more bubbles form in the
   bottle, before you start pouring.  In extreme cases, this can lead
   to "gushing".  In any case, as a head forms in the bottle, you get
   the impression of a highly carbonated beer.  When opening an almost
   full bottle, this disturbance of the beer is minimized, and little
   or no "gushing" occurs.

Has anyone ever used a propane or natural gas BBQ as a cooker?


Is the heat capacity way too low/too high?  I guess when doing it outside one

There is a GW malting facility in Los Angeles, actually it's in one of the
industrial suburbs (I think it may be Vernon), and they sell directly to
homebrewers every Wednesday.  You have to place and order on Tuesday, and
the minimum order is 100lbs, then you pick it up on Wednesday in a 
container supplied by you.  Last time I checked, it was $0.23/lb.  I 
believe it's a two-row variety, but I'm not sure which one.  Also, I'm not
sure if it's the same as they supply to Bud, or one of their other products.
I've never used it (I'm kinda stuck on the Belgian stuff myself), but I
know a lot of local homebrewers who do; they seem to like it just fine.

I believe flaws are the point here.  If you can make good pale beer, you can
make good beer in any style.  I think most beginners recognize that they are
beginners, and that some experience is necessary to perfect the technique.  I
think we insult their intelligence when we recommend that they "brew a dark
beer because it will hide the mistakes."  The same hurdle must be jumped when
switching to all-grain brewing.  It takes a few batches to get it right, and
most of us recognize this and are willing to push through it.  And most of the
recommendations I have heard for people starting to mash are along the lines of
"stick with a pale ale until you get it right, then branch out."  Why do we give
one set of advice to more advanced brewers, but admonish beginners with "relax,
don't worry, you can't screw this up totally" homilies from the School of Sloppy
Beermaking?

I agree with the premise, I normally leave about 2" of head space in my 
bottles and now leave 1" or less.  It APPEARS my beer is less carbonated 
*when opening* because of the less amount of "hiss" given off...but the 
actual carbonation seen/tasted appears to be the same.


I would also like to offer another explanation (*if* lower fills are more 
carbonated), that is: the extra amount of oxygen available in the void is 
used by the yeast to continue living a little longer, thus giving off a 
little more carbon dioxide...makes sense to me.


Good luck...JRT`at`PGE.COM

On the subject of St. Pats kegs. I purchased six of them. One does
not seal due to dents and folds in opening and is completely unuseable.
Another keg has a leaky "out" valve and it's thread arrangement does not
match any of the other kegs I have. The valve will have to be rebuilt before
the keg is useable. One of the kegs is so dented on the bottom it will be
a very hard keg to clean. Another keg's "rubber" bottom is comming off and
will have to be repaired before long. Out of six kegs, two are in reasonable
shape (after cleaning like all other kegs I have ever purchased). I will not
speak for others, but for me, it would have been cheaper to look for the
$25-$30 kegs I can find around here. I do not recommend St. Pats to anyone.

First of all I would like to thank everyone for the reponse
to my question on warm temperature brewing.  Here is a summary
of the tips:


Keep the fermenter cool in a water bath (w/ or w/o ice) and 
drape a towel around the carboy to take advantage of evaporative
cooling.  (I'm embarrassed I didn't think of this.)  Once you
get to your desired temperature it is very difficult to get that
much thermal mass to swing in temperature.


Use a yeast that performs well at the higher temps.


Brew something that is commonly made at a higher temp. and has
characteristics not easily overcome by a small ammount of the
potential off flavors at these temps.


Thanks lots.

Most, if not all, of your questions are (or should be) addressed in the

This is one of the rare instances in which I agree with Dr. Lewis, and
it has long been my own advice.  I think it's much more useful to get a
grasp of the brewing process by making simple beers (pale malt and a tad
of caramel) than beers filled with lots of different malts, adjuncts,
whatever.  It's (1) easier; (2) varying the recipe by changing the
caramel malt, or the base malt or the hops allows the brewer to see how
each of those variables works; (3) it is, as noted, more transparent,
thus allowing the brewer to see what's going on (including flaws); (4)
it serves as the base for all other beers.


Frankly, if you can't make a simple pale ale you don't understand the
process.  Isn't it better to learn that process than to pretend you
understand it, while covering up your mistakes?

50% is way too much, but at levels around 10-20% in certain British
styles would be well worth exploring.  Of course, the *kind* of brown
sugar is important, at least according to British texts. The critical
factors are the unfermentables, which can make or break the beer
depending on how tasty they are.  One catch: the only way to tell is to
brew with the sugar.

Steel wool works great. Specifically, steel wool that is impregnated with

Naturally, one will worry about scratching the stove. Without seeing the
stove, I cannot comment, but, in general, stoves have what's referred to
as a "baked enamel" surface, which is resistent to very high temperatures,
and also resistant to scratching.


As with all things, there is a limit. 'Unbreakable toys are useful for
breaking other toys', and all that. Clearly the stuff can be scratched by
a determined party, with a hammer or a screwdriver.


However, the soap, along with some hot water, provides an excellent lubri-
 -cant which facilitates abrasion, without erosion of the baked enamelling.

In HBD 1468, John P. Curcio <jpc`at`philabs.Philips.COM> asks about
converting rubber-bottomed kegs to kettles.  I have done this; believe
me it is no fun.  The rubber is attached to the keg bottom with an
industrial strength glue that resisted my every attempt to pry it off.
In the end, I found the only thing that worked on the glue was intense
heat.  Although its a bit environmentally unfriendly, the way to do it
is to take the keg out somewhere where no one is going to call the fire
department on you, and set the bottom of the keg on fire using a
torch, etc.  Be sure the keg is vented so that pressure doesn't build
up, and keep some baking soda, water, or a fire extinguisher on hand
to control the fire.  Before too long, the flaming rubber can be
gently pried off the keg bottom using a pole.

Kirk asks for advice...


If you have scorched boil over on your stove, try an abrasive cleanser. I've
used Comet. A couple sessions of soak and scrub usually does it.


If you have somehow managed to scorch the finish on your stove, the finish
must not have been that durable to begin with. You didn't paint the stove,
did you?
If it is a problem with the original stove finish, maybe you can get the
manufacturer to replace the stove top gratis.
Or get a replacement stove top from your local appliance parts  place, unless
you are beginning to like the dog house. After a while its not so bad;)

Subject: American Alt




Recently my beer-distributor neighbor brought around a new beer for me 
to taste: Schmaltz's Alt.


Schmaltz's Alt, "A dark German style ale", is brewed by August Schell 
Brewing Company of New Ulm, MN. The bottle label is forest green and 
tan/cream and says, " In 1993 a new style of Schell beer was born to 
commemorate the loss of one of our founders." Centered on the label is 
an old-time picture of an early (19th century) brewer sitting on a 
wooden keg.


The beer is clear with a dark copper color. It has medium carbonation 
and a very sweet malty aroma. There is no hop aroma. The head is brown 
and does not last long. The initial flavor is sweet malt with little hop 
flavor. The hop bitterness nicely balances the maltiness of the beer; I 
would estimate that the beer is about 20 IBU's. There is a silght black 
or chocolate malt bitterness at the finish. This is not a heavy beer in 
spite of the strong sweet malty flavors. I'd guess that it started in 
the 1.050 range.


I compared this beer to M. Jackson's alt descriptions in _Beer_Companion_ 
and found many similarities.


I do not think that the beer is selling very well, probably because
the schmatzy label makes people think that this is a novelty beer; it 
isn't.  My neighbor says that it retails in the $15/case range.


Cheers!

I've just gotten a chest freezer which I intend to use for

maintains temperature by turning the power on and off.


I'd also like to use the freezer to regulate fermentation

freezer is in the garage where it the air temperature can
easily get above 90). 


My question is whether using the Air-Stat to maintain 
temperatures near 70 will do any damage to the freezer, 
since it will be operating so far from its design point.
For instance, will it cycle excessively.


I'd be interested in hearing from anyone with experience in

I agree with Raymun but I can see a problem with this, too.  When

the person who posted the question has an adequate number of supplies
they should summarize and post the answers to the HBD.  This type of

Another solution is to post a "yeah, me too" message to the person

Subject: Sludge in my wort


OK so it's not sludge but it looks like it.  Here's my problem:
After I'm done boiling my extract based wort for about an hour, I filter
the wort into the fermenter.  Since I started using my new funnel with the
built in filter, it clogs 9 or 10 times per 5 gallon batch.  The filter
is fairly small and the "clog" is a very fine impenetrable goop.  I have
to stop pooring, rinse the filter and continue.  Besides the annoyance
of this process I don't like chancing contamination so often.
Other information:
        I use both bittering and hop pellots, the latter added in the
         last 5 minutes of boil.
        I cool the wort before filtering
        I add grains(in bag) until just before the water boils


What is this stuff I'm filtering out and is it something I want to
    keep or get rid of?
Do I need a no filter, a different filter, or a prefilter?
Any other clues or suggestions.


BTW, I loved the boil over submission.  I'm thinking about hanging it
up in my kitchen so my wife can view my spills with the proper perspective!

 Clearly from everything I have written, including the cliche "all microns are

Hello homebrew experts!  


I have a couple of questions regarding my experiences with homebrewing.  
I have just bottled my second batch, a summer type lighter colored ale, 
dry hopped with Cascade hop pellets.  I, being the beginner that I am, used
light malt extract (John Bull unhopped) in the cans, Cascade hop pellets,
Irish Moss, Munton Dry Ale Yeast, water, etc.  I also bought one of those
5 gal glass carboys for use during secondary fermentation.  Now comes 
question number 1.  The first time I brewed, I used hop plugs and put them
in the boil in hop bags.  This time I just threw the pellets in and I got
a ton of sediment in my bucket when I went to rack it to the secondary.  The
sediment seemed to be pure hop sludge!!  I used the Irish Moss so that my
beer could be as clear as possible, but it seems like it was a waste of time
because of all the suspended hops in the mix.  I then dryhopped my last 
remaining ounce of hop pellets in the secondary and being the glutton for
punishment that I am, I again noticed a substantial amount of hop sediment
at bottling time.  Should I have used the hop bags for the pellets also?


Second topic - my lame first batch.  Actually it wasn't that lame in the
beginning.  It was a darker beer and I primed it with the standard 3/4 cup
corn sugar.  When it was two weeks in the bottle, I tried some and it was
ok.  I thought that it was good for a first attempt and my friends that 
homebrew agreed.  Alas, as time went on, the beer became very carbonated.
Large soda-sized bubbles...  it was horrible.  I had about a six pack left
over when I started the boil for my second batch and I noticed that one had
exploded!!!  I opened another bottle and I witnessed an extraordinary 
geyser affect about 1 foot high out of the bottle!  What happenend here?
What can I do to prevent this in the future?




Any and all replys will be greatly appreciated.  I look forward to the days
of all grain brewing, but I feel I need to "master" the basic methods first.




Thanks much,
