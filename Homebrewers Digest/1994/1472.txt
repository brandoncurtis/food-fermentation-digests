Subject: Heinekin & Radiation


I must humbly withdraw my comment on Heinekin irradiating their beer. After
furthur research into the source, I found that Heinekin was found to buy
irradiated barley and hops. The source of this was German trials to ban the
sale of Heinekin in Germany before the European Community alliance was formed.
I still believe that the source of Heinekin's skunkiness MUST be from the
water they use, somehow. In the low lands like that, the water must have to
pass through, and be treated by many different things.

Subject: secret bud strategy


Here's what someone said about the bud vs homebrew commercials & bud's longterm
marketing strategy:


- ------------------------------------
Miller and Coors have entered the craft brew arena with Miller's reserve
series and Coors' seasonal brews, Eisebock and now Weizen. They saw the
market for high end beers and went right to it, figuring to compete with
the Sam Adams' of the world.
Bud on the other hand saw it and went the opposite direction. Instead of
competing with the micros and regionals, they're gonna buy em up. Case
in point is the recent 15% ownership and distribution agreement with
Red Hook. If they position themselves as the "brewery that still makes
the standard swill and we're damn proud of it," they don't lose anything
and actually it makes sense to try to make the separation more pronounced.
- ------------------------------------------


Frankly I think Budweiser is following a pretty clever secret plan.  After all,
why go to all the trouble, cost, and risk of coming up with a new upscale beer
product when you can just buy up the people who have already figured out how to
do it right?  This is a typical corporate strategy.  As far as a signature bud
microbrew line; I believe they plan to buy Czech Budweis, not to buy the name
and churn out cheap watery beer (they already do that) but to buy an
established respected product line to put into every yuppie bar in the US from
coast to coast.  They'll probably even call it "Bud Classic."


Think of it, instead of having to think up a new recipie, new procedures,
investing in new equipment, they just buy the brewery and plug the product
right into their marketing and distribution network.  No muss, no fuss.


Speaking of bud commercials, have you all seen the one with the hipster
stranded in the corn fields with a broken car?  He hallucinates an even cooler
dude who gives him a "Ice Bud" and tells our regular-guy protagonist that some
people just "won't get it" before he melts away into the corn.  The subtext
here being to ignore the critisms of people (just about everyone, actually) who
can see that "ice brewed" is a pile o' crap served up to find a new market
niche and laugh at the "ice beer" drinker for being a dup.  I remember sitting
in front of the TV saying "i don't get it" during those bonkers "join the
revolution" comercials where ice brewed beer somehow set the people of the
future free from their spacey-fascist opressors.


can't wait for that first taste of delicious old-world Bud Classic!  Yum!

Subject: *.hqx files/beer labels


This is a summary of my recent question of beer label software and the
BrewArt files thatt can be ftp'd from sierra.stanford.edu.


1)  This response was from George Tempel (tempel`at`MONMOUTH-EDL.ARMY.MIL)


The BrewArt collections on sierra are my binhexed (*.hqx) Macintosh
self-expanding archives of PICT/TIFF and other graphics clipart that I have
designed and developed for designing labels. You can convert the binhexed
file into a Macintosh application by dragging and dropping the binhexed files
onto a program such as StuffIt-Expander, which can automagically do the
conversion for you.
No, the archives do not contain DOS/Windows versions of my artwork. I don't
have one of those machines, and thus cannot support them.


2)  There doesn't seem to be any software out there that is specifically
designed for making beer/wine/mead labels.  Most people recommended using a
drawing program and using imagination when creating labels.


3)  Though I didn't ask this question, many people suggested using WHOLE
milk as a "glue" for the label.  It was recommended that you dip your label
in the whole milk and be sure it is fully wetted and then just stick it to
the bottle and allow to dry.


I hope this helps some of you that asked me for my findings.  Thanks to all
who took the time to respond to the original post.

In response to the recent posts about "sterile" ice cubes: I have found two
things that work well.  What I usually do is dump six trays of ice into a
bathtub of cold water and then stick my pot in it.  I have also cleaned all of
the paper and sticky stuff off a coke bottle (plastic, two-liter), filled it
with tap water and froze it.  When it time to cool my wort, I gave it a quick
bleach and water wash, rinsed it off good and *PLUNK* into the pot it went. 
The bathtub seems to work just as well though and is less hassle.  Good luck!

   Responding to Tad Deshler about the burnt stainless steel
kettle:
   A strong basic solution, such as potassium hydroxide is
what we use at work. At home, I use a mixture of bleach and
water. If you're willing to wait a couple of days( depending
on how badly you burnt the kettle), it should all dissolve
away. If it's only hte bottom of the kettle, it shouldn't take
too much bleach. Good luck.

David,


Cloudy siphon hoses are not a problem.  They absorb water and become
cloudy so it is from your extended soaking times.  I often sanitize my
siphon hoses overnight so they are ready to use 1st thing in the morning
and they are usually cloudy.

Subject: Re: Strawbeery Beer


I have brewed up a strawbarry beer twice now with great results. 
I use a basic Continental Light recipe and add approx 5 lbs of pureed
strawberries to the secondary. I have found that adding them after the  burst
of fermenting activity has died down works best. 


 One note though, there will be a lot of trub so filtering would be
recommended. I dont have a filter so on the second batch I racked it from the
secondary after 4 days to another secondary  (thirdary??) 
this seemed to work well too.


The beer has come out very well with a good strawberry flavor.

 The short answer is that it has done more to take the work out of brewing 
 than any gadget I put together since the EASYSPARGER.  Brewing is now a part 
 time project.  Mashing, sparging and boiling only require occasional 
 attention.
 
 > Specifically, what differences, qualitative and quantitative, do you see

 None.  However, I have never "not" mixed.  The difference is that now it is 
 continuous through out the mash period.

Subject: fruit beers


Hi all!
In light of the recent posts on fruit beers I just wanted to add my
comments to the discussion.....


I have made several fruit beers and have had much success by making a basic
light wheat beer then adding my fruit into the secondary.  Some people in
my brew club have brewed with the fake flavorings that the homebrew shop
here sells but I can definitely tell the difference. I would suggest
against it. If you have any doubts just try the Thomas Kemper berry beer. 
The fake syrup flavor shines right through!
The point I am trying to make is don't use syrups. so "Pratte" don't use
any blueberry syrups, use the real thing. It tastes much better.


How much should I put in the secondary? 


I made a 2 gal batch of blueberry beer and only used one pint of crushed
blueberries and it worked wonderfully. I also made a full 5gal strawberry
batch.  It was last november? and I couldn't get any fresh strawberries
from the grocery store so I purchased a full can (7 lb?) of strawberries
from the homebrew store that is meant to be used in wines.  The
ingreadients read: strawberries. that's it! So I poured that into the
secondary and my light wheat beer had a pink color and a very nice light
(not overpowering) strawberry flavor. I would suggest useing 7-10lbs of
fresh strawberries in the full batch. the reason I suggest so much
is because everyone else I have talked to could never get enough flavor
out of there strawberries to tast. 


Drawback: can of stawberries...... 17$!

Subject: RE: Hop Boil durations front,bac


>Algis writes:


>Also, I'm curious as to the meaning of back aroma and front
>aroma.


I called the author of the article from which this table
was reproduced (incedently he is the owner of Highlander HB
supply in Denver) to ask of the meaning of front-back aroma.


Front Aroma- a strong smell from aromatics-the dry hopping
effect of a resinous, flowery nose.
Back Aroma- A more of a feeling in the sinus, that is not
apparent as a flowery nose. (I would liken this to the spicy feeling
I get sometimes after swallowing as well as with first sipping,
in the back area of the nose.)


Well there you have it. Most of the feed-back (flames?) is that
no flavor is acheived in boil longer than 10 min. So many recipes
I've seen call for multiple additions
at 40, 30, 15. I'd bet Sierra NV does more than one addition. Although
their pale ale is to my taste overly dry-hopped.


So now my observations, opinions:


The point of Kieth's article was to help in acheiving the perfectly
hopped beer. "The perfectly hopped beer" is probably unattainable
as most peoples tastes vary. As Charlie say's, "The best beer in
the world is the one in your hand".


Perfectly "hopped" beer simply means a balanced beer. So lets,
for the sake of this disscution, speak of a style that is moderatly
to highly hopped.


For the brewer this is a matter of adding hops at correct
intervals to acheived hints of all the smells, flavors and bitterness
character available without overpowering the others. A perception
of smooth non cloying hop character. Flavors following and
complimenting the last. Simple it's not.


The yeast used, the malt used etc. will effect hop perception.
Hop perception = Balance or vice-versa. The point?: Hops are one,
major part of beer.


What we can attempt to acheive as homebrewers, is a beer that
tickles all the sensory nerves of the drinkers palate.
What style of beer does that? My beer hopefully, which is why
I brew.


Yes there is other ** STYLES ** of beer that are not supposed
to have hop aroma etc. of which I enjoy many. Sometimes to many.
:-)


My theory is that flavor is a combined reaction of aroma and hop
bittering qualitys along with reactions to the grain during mashing
I.E.- hops are bitter period, hops are aromatic period. Hop "flavor" is
a reaction during mashing to the sugars (goodness) of the grains.
If you boil hops long enough the bittering qualities are removed
from the aromatics which disappear into the brewhouse. At shorter
boil times some of the aromatics attach to the wort leaving
a percieved flavor which is really malt, with hop aromatics at
the chemical level. So your really snorting your beer and not
drinking it!
:-)
Also the grain hulls must add a flavor that is, besides tannins,
which are beneficial.
Why have brewers always left the chaff in with the malt while
mashing. It could be removed totally before mashing.




Flame away
and brew on.

Subject: Summary: Low CO`at` with Wyeast American Ale.


In the spirit of full disclosure:


A few weeks ago I asked about some carbonation problems I have had with a
brown ale fermented with Wyeast American Ale.


I recieved a number of responses from people who have had similar problems
with this yeast.  One has found that using 1 full cup of corn sugar will
give good carbonation in a reasonable amount of time but warns that he
can't say what will happen a few months down the line.


Another said they had to wait a few months before carbonation reached the
expected level.


I recieved a few suggestions that agitating the bottled beer helps things along.


A few others said they never had any carbonation problems, presumably with
Wyeast American Ale


My own experience is that agitation and time haven't helped much. Does
Sierra Nevada supposedly pitch new yeast for bottle conditioning?

Subject: lagering at ale temps-summary


Greetings homebrewers,


I had posted a letter about two months ago about brewing my first 
batch (a lager) in the St. Louis heat.  I received several responses 
and after reading the posts lately I thought I should summarize and 
post the suggestions along with what I did.


First, I made the mistake of not thinking about all the steps involved 
before buying my supplies.  My main problem was that I purchased 
liquid California Lager Yeast without knowing if my basement was 
really cool enough to brew a lager in.  (I later found that temps in 
the basement were around 22-25 deg C, a bit too warm for a even the 
California Lager Yeast which claims that it can be used up to 62 deg F 
without problems.)  I do, however, have a 4 deg C cold-room at work 
that I have access to, but I had misreported this cold-room as being
10 deg F.  Sorry!  I asked for recommendations as to whether I could
brew in my basement or not, as well as the benefits/necessity of using
a blowoff tube vs. an airlock.  The suggestions were as follows:


Mark Evans from Dubuque, IA, recommends using a Belgian Ale strain in 
my basement due to its ability to work at higher temps.  He also 
suggests switching to an airlock after 48-72 hours.


Jeff Renner described many different formulations I could use to brew 
in my basement but also quips, "even a lager at wrong temps should be 
drinkable if your other procedures are sound"


John Theodore of Seattle, WA recommends placing the primary fermeter 
(a glass carboy) into a garbage can with water in it and place ice in 
it to keep the temps down.


Sean MacLennan says that I could go ahead and brew in my basement with 
the lager yeast, but that I shouldn't expect a true lager taste.


I took all the advice to heart and went ahead and brewed in my 
basement.  I have since tried the beer, and, as predicted, it had a 
noticeable fruity smell and taste (esters, I presume) that probably 
arose from brewing above the recommended temp.  Aside from the fruity 
taste (and the poor carbonation from tasting too soon) I consider my 
first batch a success.  My next-door neighboor agrees and is more 
than willing to help me make room in my refridgerator for more 
homebrew!  


IN CONCLUSION, for those of you who wish to brew a true lager, it is 
necessary to have temps just above freezing. But (IMHO) a lager 
brewed at ale temps is still better than a Bud!  I also recommend the 
Wyeast California Lager Yeast highly as even at the higher 
fermentation temps it had extremely high attenuation (OG 1.045 to FG 
1.004), it cleared beautifully, and still gave only a mild fruity taste.
Also, an airlock is preferred to a blowoff tube after the initial 
fermentation subsides.


QUESTIONS:  Are there any viable yeast left in the bottles of store-
bought beers such as Guinness i.e. can the yeast be cultured and used in 
homebrew?  Are there any brands of beer that are better for this?  
Which ones?


Thanks to all who came quickly to my aid before and to all who 
frequently post to the digest.  Without you many a new homebrewer on 
the internet would not have the wherewithal to start brewing themselves.  
(Myself included!)


Cheers to all and have a homebrew!

  OFFICE MEMO         Strawberry Beer                       Date:  7/9/94
Mark B. Alston wrote that The Breckenridge Brewery's strawberry ale was the
worst beer he ever tasted.  He must be fortunate indeed to have never tasted
anything worse.


I too was disappointed in the beer although it is far from the worst I've ever
had...  My complaints about the beer was a lack of any distinct strawberry
flavor.  This was fresh brew purchased on site in Denver.  I know that it is
dificult to bring out distinct fruit flavors from my own experiences with fruit
ale brewing, but these guys are supposed to be pros.  The other noticable flaw
is the cloudyness of the brew.  I believe that this is probably pectin haze,
but this stuff is the cloudyest brew I've seen in quite some time.


All in all, I'd pass on this one.  In Breckenridge's defense, they do make some
righteous brews.  Try their Oatmeal Stout or the Avalanche Ale - they do make
good beer - the strawberry just isn't one of them.

The clear plastic hoses are made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and a healthy
dose of plasticizer (bis(2-ethylhexyl phthalate a.k.a. dioctyl phthalate).
If left exposed to water for prolonged periods of time, this tubing will
absorb water.  However, the water is immissible with the PVC and plasticizer
and will turn the hose cloudy (a milky white).


>So I have several questions:
>
>1. How long do hoses last?


Quite long.  If they are soft, pliable, and clean, they can be used.
Appearance (other than cleanliness) are primarily a matter of aesthetics.
Months to a year or longer is not unreasonable.


>2. How do you store them?


Dry, laid out or coiled.


>3. How do you clean them?


Rinse with sanitizing solution.  For the blowoff hose (1-1/4" O.D.), I use
a solution of dishwashing detergent (Cascade) and follow by rinsing with
sanitizing solution and then water.


>4. Can I use them even if they're cloudy?


Yes, as long as they're soft and pliable.  If you let the cloudy hose set in
a dry place long enough, you might find that the tube clears up as the water
diffuses out.

The archives at sierra.stanford.edu have a listserver.  From the

"Ftp is the prefered method of accessing the archives but if this is not
possible for you, than Sierra's listserver can be used to send files to
your account via e-mail.


"All but a few files may be retreived via mail by sending a request to the
listserver at listserv`at`sierra.stanford.edu (image files are not presently
accessable).  The directory structure appears to be very different for
listserver access so one should use the INDEX command to get a copy of the
names of available files.  The list server only supports HELP, INDEX, and
GET commands and should be used in the following manner.  (NOTE:  This
software is VERY picky.)


"To get a list of the files available from the Homebrew archives send:


     INDEX HOMEBREW


"To get files from the archives you need to send one or more lines like the
following:


     GET HOMEBREW filename


where 'filename' is one of the files listed by the INDEX HOMEBREW command."

I have to agree.  I drank half (barely), and put the other half

What's turbino sugar?
I made a similar batch a few months ago, but used dextrose instead. The beer
is supposed to be pale (Duvel copy) but mine came out quite dark. I did a
complete wort boil over 60 minutes so that could explain it; 15 minutes might
be better. I also made Brewferm's Tripel and Grand Cru. All were dark! I also
used the Wyeyeast Belgian for each.
I was not very happy with the outcome overall. These kits are *expensive*,
especially when you have to use 2 per batch. 
The Wyeyeast Belgian generally gets the thumbs down by most brewers.
There was an interesting discussion on Judgenet Digest #801 concerning 
this yeast. The impression is that it gives lots of banana esters if brewed
at *normal* (70F) temperatures and is much better at 57-60F. 
OK, so I made 3 batches of banana beer - my fault, not the yeasts'!
As far as conditioning is concerned, it is faster in the secondary than in
the bottle. This is because there is a greater contact area of the yeast
to the beer in the secondary, than in the bottle, where it settles out. It is
the action of the yeast that conditions the beer. So you'll get a better
result if you leave it sitting in the secondary at coolish temps for a month
at least..
Another tip is to add fresh yeast when bottling these strong beers to
improve your head - no I usually can't be bothered either! If you do add
fresh yeast *don't* add priming sugar as your beer will be severely 
overcarbonated - believe me!
These beers definitely improve with age. I'd say try and leave them (bottled)
for a year or so to get the best out of them. 6 - 8 weeks? still in nappies!
The Belgian yeast has quite a harsh character when young that mellows
with time.
The solution is to make another beer or two in the meantime of a different
style that you can drink whilst waiting!
BTW, the Grand Cru is my favorite.

I attempted to make a honey/wheat beer.......not sure what I have.  So I
am hopeing to tap the HBD wisdom and find out what I should do with what I
have. First, this is the recipe:


3.5 lbs alexanders wheat malt extract
10  lbs honey (oops)
1   tsp irish moss (last 15min)
1   tsp yeast nutrient (last 15min)
1.5 oz pellet hops- experimental holliture<SP?> taste alike (144?)
 .5  oz same hops last 10 min of boil
   wyeast 1056


I was *trying* to get a potential alch of aprox 8%. I overshot it just a
little. The gravity reading on this (at 60deg) was 1.110 !!!! that's around
14% potential alch.


What have I made? beer or mead? possibly Meer????? 


How long will it take to ferment? will I have to use a champagne yeast to
finish it?


What will it taste like? 


Also, I wanted to put about 10lbs of peaches in the secondary.  


**** ANY advice would be much appreciated *****

note about the ice thing: I just made a wort cooler. total cost only 33$. that

VERY worth it! it took (aprox) 18min to get from boiling to 78 deg. 
my tap water in the seattel area runs at about 58 deg.

Subject: Polyphenols and Charcoal


Hello, all:


While perusing the first volmume of Malting_and_Brewing_Science (studying
for the BJCP exam I plan to take sometime next year), I came
upon a few references to adding charcoal (I assume activated) to the mash
to reduce polyphenol levels.  This is related, at least tangentially, to 
the, ahhhh, discussion we had recently on sparge water temperature, and the
pH and gravity of the final runnings.  Again, this seems to be really
"big boy" stuff, because they are concerned with all possible extraction from
a given grain bed, but I just thought I'd throw this out for some 
intellectual interaction.


"Additions of hydrogen peroxide or charcoal to the mash, or charcoal to the
sweet wort, also reduce polyphenol levels"  (277).


"Charcoal is thought to adsorb haze precursors and so remove them from the
wort"  (277).


"As the pH [of the final runnings] rises, the composition of the wort solids
alters and becomes less desirable as proportionately more silicates, 
phosphates, polyphenols, high-molecular-weight nitrogenous materials and
possibly polysaccharides come into solution. . . . Because of the undue
proportion of polyphenols, silicates and other unwanted materials in the
last runnings, it has been suggested that these should be treated with 
active charcoal, at 10-50 g/hl of wort . . ."  (293).


"Charcoal added to the mash or to the copper before the boil usefully 
reduces the tendency of the derived beer to form a haze" (295)


The most recent reference cited for these statements is from 1968.  So, was
this once a process that was accepted, either theorhetically or 
practically, and has now been disregared?  Has anyone tried this?  Would  
using this technique for the final half of the runnings cause any harm?
Do any good?  


I've never made an "astringent" beer, but I would like to know a bit more
about this.  If anyone has access to the J. Inst. Brewing, I'd like to
get original copies of these references.  Of course, I'd gladly send you 
postage and copying expenses, as well as sending you "beer" money.


TIA,

Yaay!  (sorry for such an over the top outburst on this serious 
brewing digest ..  :-) 


I have a boiler!!!!  I went to the recylcing place and purchased 
a "wash copper" for A$30 - a 35 litre copper vessel mounted in an 
enamal coated steel frame, with a 4000 W element in it and a 
drain at the bottom with a tap at the side and everything!  It 
seems perfct for brewing (used to be used for washing clothes in 
the bad old days).  I just have to clean it and re-wire (and 
possibly replace) the element.  Someone said they clean their 
wort chiller by dunking it in vinegar (acetic acid), I was 
wondering if their was a better method, the crud on this seems 
pretty ingrained.  I have tried with vinegar and some elbow 
grease, and managed to clean up some of it, but I want this 
sucker to sparkle, with minimum effort.  I have access to heaps 
of chemicals, so how about 1M HCl ..  (I know not to use HNO3).  


About the wiring ..  there are four red wires attached to the 
element.  Am I right in assuming that this is some sort of temp 
control (more elements = more heat) and that one of the red wires 
is the neutral?  The element is grounded through the copper 
vessel (which has a ground attached to it).  I will need to 
re-wire this, but plugs here have a "phase", "neutral" and 
"ground" ...  how do I know which of the red wires is the 
"return" (neutral)?  


I will want to acidify my sparge water (on the advice of an 
all-grainer here), what is the chemical of choice (again 
availability is not a problem).  


All grain here I come!


Any help most appreciated.

I'm sorry if I'm wasting any bandwidth with this, but I have asked a few
questions previously, and didn't receive any answers, or received somewhat
incomplete (IMHO) answers.  I have about 15 batches under my belt, and owe much
of my success to the dialog and answers that I get regulary from the HBD.  I
value this group's knowledge, without it I would be pretty lost -- a scary
place to be for a beginner.  So here goes again: 


1)  So if I want to bottle kegged beer (14PSI), I just squirt it into a bottle
and cap it?  It doesn't seem right to me, intuitively, but maybe the CO2 thing
is really like that?? 


2)  I have a converted keg boiler and immersion chiller, but don't really see
how to separate the stuff that drifts near the bottom (cold break) from the
rest of my cold wort.  How do y'all do this?  It seems that I would leave
behind a painfully large amount of wort if I just don't touch it. 




3)  It takes qui [Bte a while with my 30,000 btu cooker to get my keg boiling.
Does anybody have a nifty idea for how to insulate the keg to speed the process
up.  I use aluminum foil now, but think that there must be a better way. Oops,
the question: how to insulate a converted keg to reduce time till boil. 


4)  And last but not least, a special challenge to the homebrewers in the UK:
Does anybody have a guess at the grain and hop bills for the draft Kingfisher
beer served in the Indian restaraunts/pubs in the London area? 


Again, I'm sorry if these questions are millionth-time, naive, or obvious. I've
read Miller, Papazian, Noonan and a couple of others several times, and frankly
don't know where else to go. 


BTW, I vote for the summarize your answers approach, and have tried to always
do it when I have received more than one response.  


Thanks again,
