An issue that has come into prominence recently is that of liability
for alcohol-related accidents.  (I.e., someone gets in a wreck on the
way home from a club meeting.)  Some clubs have incorporated in order
to shift potential liability from individual members to the
corporation (which is essentially penniless, so not a good target for
lawsuits).

Sorry for the messed-up post yesterday, don't know what happened.  Hope this is
easier to read.


Hi All


All Grain Equipment Questions:
     My wife just bought me a Gott Cooler for my B.D., so I shall
be transitioning to all grain soon.  I was wondering about brew
pots.  I have seen adds in brew supply catalogs and seen canning
pots in department stores for 8-8.5 gal ceramic on steel pots,
but they are listed as medium duty.  I have also read in the HBD
of some brewers whose ceramic on steel brew pots had the handle
break off.  How sturdy/reliable are these brew pots, and how
would I know short of buying one?    I know that kegs can be
modified, but don't have one, yet, nor time to mess with one. 
Initially I would brew a 3-4 gal batch on my electric stove
before investing in a Cajun/King cooker and working up to larger
batches.
     Now as for the Gott cooler, I am thinking about getting a
Phil's Phalse Bottom (tm?) versus a nylon grain sparge bag.  Now
my understanding is the sparging process is fairly long, so I
would want to replace the Gott spigot with a open drain plug or
such, and control the flow of water with a valve/restrictor of
sorts.  Does this sound reasonable?  Does anyone know of a Gott
manufactured spigot replacement part, and where to get one?


Growing Hops Replies
In June I posted a question on why one of my hops plants was
growing like crazy, and the other ones weren't, and what
fertilizer would be good for the plants. Below are portions of
the replies:


R.P. Mattie wrote:
>    Composted cow manure is a very good choice.  The only other
     thing you might have wanted to have added is sand, which
     allows some air space and the growth of roots as well as

     kind of soil Ph hops prefer.  the clay is quite acidic, the
     compost mildly so.  You might want to add lime for its
     alkalinity, and perhaps some kind of calcium/mineral source. 
     Go easy on these things, and miracle grow kind of stuff. 
     Because they are so easily and quickly taken up, they seem
     to lead to a kind of soil burn out, which is bad for the
     living things in your soil, so bad for your plants in the
     long run, unless you like hydroponic gardening.  You CAN add
     a high-nitrogen fertilizer, and the hops WILL grow MUCH
     faster, but it will be really leggy and flabby and not at
     all hardy.   . . .

     been using a little miracle grow every 2 weeks and otherwise
     add compost on a regular basis.  I also found this
     semi-organic budding fertilizer made from ground up fish
     called "Alaska Mor Bloom" which is 0-10-10.  It seems as
     though it has boosted the plants a bit...it also helped
     along some herbs that have been struggling this year.


     By the way, my other Cascade, a Northern Brewers, and a
Hallertauer are now up at 5-8 feet.  My one _Giant_ Cascade is up
to 18 feet with lots of nice flower buds.  Just hope the Japanese
Beetles don't eat them!  In the May/June issue of Brewing
Techniques has an article on growing hops, and says that sprays
like Diazinon and Malathion are available, but have 14 day
waiting times to harvest if you use them.  The gardening
salesperson at the local hardware store recommended Liquid Sevin
for controlling bugs, and from reading the back of the bottle,
most waiting periods are 0-2 days before harvest.  Anyone know
about this stuff and if direct spraying on the flowers will
damage them?   As far as harvesting, I was thinking of putting
the flowers in mason jars.  I've seen that some of the
vacuum/sealer machines have attachments for sucking air out of
canning jars.  As an alternative, I was wondering if the CO2
cartridges for soda water, etc, might be used to flush the air
out of a canning jar before sealing.  There was also a previous
mention on the HBD about oxygen barrier bags from Cole-Parmer
scientific catalog.  Could those be used with one of those
vacuum/sealer machines, and are they expensive?  Email or post. 
I'll post if interesting responses.  TIA

HONEY BEVERAGES-THEIR SWEET BEGINNINGS
by Brews Stevens (brews`at`delphi.com)
The earliest alcoholic beverages were probably made from diluted fermented
honey.In fact, the beer that the first Anglo-Saxons drank was a brew of
water and honeycomb in a clay pot,with the possible addition of herbs for
flavoring. Modern brewers have gone back to valuing the use of all natural
ingredients in their beers. One such ingredient is honey. This sweet syrup
is used in a variety of beers from herb and specialty styles to traditional and
flavored meads. The use of honey has become popular with the rise of micro
and home brewers. These operations generally make specialty upscale products
with premium ingredients.These breweries are growing at a rate of 15-20% per
year. Sam Adams recently released its Honey Porter and Rogue is using honey
to augment the sugar bill in its barley wine formulation.
Due to the popularity of home and micro brewers use of honey, the National
Honey Board
has commissioned the Bison Brewing Co. of Berkeley,Ca. to study the use of
it in beers. The study investigated the type,level and techniques for adding
honey into beer.Five prototype samples of honey ale and stout were
developed.Citrus,sage,clover and buckwheat honeys were studied.Depending on
the type of honey used and the type of beer desired,between 2-4 lbs.of honey
were added per barrel(as % by weight of total grain bill). To achieve
optimal results when adding honey to beer,honey's diastatic enzymes as well
as its yeast and bacterial counts must be considered.Honey should be added
in such a way so that it's diastatic enzymes(alpha+beta amylase) do not
degrade the dextrins(non-fermentable sugars)into simple sugars, thus
destroying the texture and body of the finished beverage. The yeast and
bacteria in honey,which are generally in stasis due to the low water
activity,can grow and proliferate when diluted during beer making.This can
effect the microbiological stability of the beer. In order to prevent any
complications it is important to pasteurize the honey and add it at an
appropriate time to your beer.
As a result,,a practical method ofpasteurization was developed by Bison. The
honey is fresh,unpasteurized andits delicate flavor profile and composition is
preserved by heating it to176 degrees for 2.5 hrs.under anaerobic conditions
prior to use.Honey is
then added to the batch at high kraeusen(peak fermentation activity) diluted
to the same OG as the beer. The addition of honey is bound to decrease the
dextrin content due to dilution as well as increasing the alcohol potential
due to the high fermentability of its sugars. Therefore the brewer should
use higher saccharification temperatures during mashing(154-160F) as well as
start with a lower wort gravity to reduce alcohol potential. A subtle honey
flavor is contributed using 3-10%by weight.Lighter honeys such as sage,mixed
flower,orange blossom,clover and alfalfa are best suited for flavor
additions. At 11-30 % levels,a distinctly noticeable flavor will develop.
Stronger flavored hops,caramelized or roasted grains,spices and other
adjuncts should be used to offset the tone. At levels above 30 % the
beverage can be considered in a category of its own approaching mead. The
stronger flavored honeys such as buckwheat or heather impart a distinct note
even at low % additions.Eucalyptus honey is said to provide a medicinal
bitterness to beverages it is used in. There are still ares that need to be
studied such as the development of furfural and its derivatives(causing off
flavors) as a result of heating the honey. FAN levels(free amino nitrogen)
are low in honey and are generally offset by all grain worts but extract
brewers can inadvertently be at levels below nutrient demand for the yeast
due to additives used in extract formulation such as corn and rice.

Subject: Hop Characteristics


I have created this table of hop characteristics for my own use. I tried to send
it in a tabular format, but the list scanner for the HBD won't let in anything
over 80 characters by. It's hard to do this table in 80 characters! My original
version also has the values of acid for the hop flowers and pellets (where
available) at my local homebrew supply shop.


I suggest that if you want to keep this info, reformat it into tabular format,
and place it in your brewing notebook.


Good luck!

In HBD #1474 Jeff Renner caught and corrected what might have been a 
rather awful mistake on my part.  Many thanks!


He was correct in his surmise that I was referring to brewing bread with
spent yeast, not trub.  Being that my husband is still and extract
brewer we have no trub.  (Yes we have to trub today?)

In pure water, CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid:


   CO2  +  H2O  <====>  H2CO3        (<====> indicates a reversible reaction)


Carbonic acid is a weak acid and dissociates slightly:


  H2CO3  <===>  H+  +  HCO3-  <====>  2 H+  +  CO3=


HCO3- is the bicarbonate ion.  Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is also known as
baking soda.  Thus adding CO2 to water cause it to be come slightly acidic.
If the water is slightly basic because of dissolved carbonates, adding CO2
will cause it to become somewhat more acidic:


  H20  +  C02  <====>  H2CO3  +  CaCO3  <====>  Ca(HCO3)2


The carbonic acid reacts with the carbonate salt to form the bicarbonate.
If a solution containing calcium bicarbonate were heated, the CO2 will be
driven off the shifting the reactions to the left.  Calcium carbonate will
be formed as a result.  Upon prolonged heating and evaporation of the water
calcium carbonate will precipitate from solution.


In none of these reactions does the addition of CO2 cause the solution to
become basic.  Without seeing specific chemical reactions, it's not clear
what your biochemist friends are referring to.

>And what types of beers should use what type of grain?


[other examples deleted for brevity...] 


You'll find all the answer to all these questions in the Malt FAQ.  As
soon as someone writes it, that is.  ;-)

It's actually Type I (one). I pressed too hard on the key. What it is, is 
a very efficient rearrangement of a specific structure containing ketones 
and CC double bonds. Absorption of light causes such a structure to shift 
electrons around, and to cleave the molecule. What happens next depends 
on the exact structure, but in the case of iso-humulone there is loss of 
carbon monoxide, and generation of the precursor to 3-methyl-2-butene thiol,
aka oil of skunk.

Hydroxyl radicals are very energetic, whereas those produced by such a 
reaction are not, so very likely there would not be any significant 
amount. Furthermore, beer is mostly water, so highly reactive radicals 
will react mostly with water.


Of course, they could cause taste alterations, but not skunking.

The point of boiling hops, is to heat-isomerize the "alpha acids", which 
have very little taste and are insoluble into "iso alpha acids", which are 
bitter and water soluble. The alpha acids are collectively known as 
humulones (the beta acids are known as lupolones), and the isomerized 
products as iso-humulones.


Because the photoreaction requires a ketone group, hydrogenated iso alpha 
acids are light stable. They are used by the makers of clear-bottle beer, 
such as Miller.

I have just prepared a batch of Lips Lager (made as an ale) using edme dry
yeast, carefully pitched into the wort at 75 degrees F.
The vigorous primary ferment lasted for about 12 hrs when it rapidly tapered
off and almost stopped after only 36 hrs.  The temp in my appt. is usually
around 78 degrees.  I have never experienced such a rapid slowing of the
fermentation in my vast experience as a Homebrewer (now going on brew #6)!
 Can anyone tell me if this is typical of an infection?  I don't know if I
should bottle it, relax DW&HAHB, or trash it and try again.  I would
appreciate any advice.

Subject: first batch problems


Sorry this is so long, but hopefully somewhere in the details is the problem!


Well, I started my first batch Monday the 11th, and having experienced a few
problems, I thought I'd ask for suggestions.


I tried to make something similar to Papazian's Wise Ass Red Bitter.  I boiled
2 cups water, took it off the heat, added 2oz of crushed roasted barley, and 
then let that sit while I got 3 gallons of water boiling.  Once it came to a
boil, I took it off the heat and stirred in 6.5 lbs of amber malt syrup and
strained/sparged the barley into the pot.  I put it back on the heat and went
back to rinsing my bleached carboy.  Naturally, it boiled over, but I didn't
lose much.  I got a more stable boil going, and added 2oz Fuggle hops pellets.
At -15, I added 1/2 tsp Irish Moss, and at -10 my wort chiller.  At 0, I
removed it from the heat, added 2oz Goldings hops pellets, and then fired up
the chiller.  About 15 minutes later, I checked the temp, and it was a happy
80 F., so I gave it another 5 minutes and it was down to 75, so I turned it
off.


I then proceeded to siphon off the wort, got down to the gunk in the bottom of
the pot, and saw that I only had about 1.5 gallons in the carboy.  At that
point I grabbed my (sanitized) funnel with a screen and poured in the rest.
After some stirring on the screen, I ended up with an additional 1/2 gallon
or so in the carboy.  I added my Wyeast American Ale yeast, which I'd had in
a 1 liter starter for a day since it had plumped, and dumped it in, stoppered
it up and gave a good shake, then topped it up to 5 gallons.


I airlocked it, then realized about a half hour later that I'd not taken a
specific gravity.  I poured one cylinder-ful out, and took the OG.  It was
1.020!  Not exactly what I was looking for.


I went ahead and re-airlocked it and let it go.  Within six hour it was in the
30-40 bloops/minute range, and by the time I went to bed some 12 hours later,
it was at about 50-60.


It's now two days later, and it's, unfortunately, down to about 50 seconds
between bloops.


Here's the questions:


Why the low OG?
Is the 1 bloop/minute a problem?
When should I rack it to the secondary?


My plans now include getting a bigger brewpot, and maybe a new hydrometer.
It came with no scale for correcting for temperature, but I can only assume
that taking the SG with the liquid a bit warm would lower the measurement, but
I have no idea how much.  Like I said, the wort was at about 75 when I pitched.


Thanks for your time!

Subject: Re: Carboy Bunging Problem


Tony McCauley asked how to remove a Bung from a carboy. 
I'll guess it is a typical rubber stopper (with or without a hole in it).
 -    If is with a hole:  Use a racking tube and push into stopper
(stopper should be with smaller end facing up), then put soapy
water around inside of carboy neck, and try to pull out. 
Alternately you could turn carboy over and jiggle till small end
of stopper rests in carboy neck, then use needle nose pliers and
remove.  Place one end of pliers into hole other on outside of
stopper and pull. 
 -    If it is without a hole:  More difficult.  May have to
destroy stopper to save carboy.  Might try to chill carboy in
fridge or ice bath, then when cold, shake stopper into opening of
carboy (again with inside neck lubricated with soapy water and
small end of stopper facing out).  Keep carboy upside down while
running warm water over bottom and sides of carboy to heat inside
air.  As air expands, pressure inside carboy may be enough to
push stopper out.  Alternately, may try a strong coat hanger and
propane torch.  Get end of hanger very hot (red?) and quickly
push into stopper (again with small end facing upwards), and let
cool, then apply soap water to inside of carboy neck and pull
out.  One last suggestion is a knife attached to pole and try to
stick into stopper and pull out. Good luck!

Subject: wort splashing


I've read some interesting posts about aeration of
wort on it's way into the carboy (ie. splashing into
the carboy).


One said with no qualification, "No, Don't Do It". Well
this **should** be qualified, "No, Don't Do It with hot
wort". THis will indeed lead to the card board taste,
the dreaded HSA (HotSideAeration).


On the other hand, if you cool your wort to pitching
temp then aerate it, this will give the yeasties plenty
of O2 to get started. This is desirable. This is my
method.


After chilling to pitch temp, I hook up a hose to my
boiler to drain the wort to the fermenter. This hose
has had a drill passed through it at 90 degree angles
about 4 inches from the end. This allows the wort
to suck air throught the holes as it passes by. This
actually ends up with a large froth in the carboy.


Using this method for many batches, I've never
had an infection or the dreaded HSA.

Concerning a better handle for 33 quart enameled pots.  I agree
that 
the spot welded handles are a joke.  The idea presented for a
collar
style handle was interesting but for lifting the ptot, but I am not
sure
how it would work for tipping and pouring the wort when it was
cooled.
One material to consider for such a handle is good old plywood.  It
is
easily machined with commonly available tools.  It will burn of, of
course
and is prone to getting dirty unless sealed with some paint or
such.
Another option is to attach better metal handles in a more robust
fashion.
The temptation is to drill holes and use bolts but then there is
the rust
problem.  I was wondering if it might be possible to clamp metal
handles
below the rim using one of those pallet banding system like they
use to 
place metal straps around crates.  No good answers, lots of
questions.


Getting the bung out of the carboy is a great problem!  My first
thought
is some bad-a** solvent that would munch on the rubber (latex?). 
Maybe
lacquer thinner of course used with the upmost care (wear goggles,
fire
hazard, etc.).  Leave some in the carboy for a while.  Do a test by
placing a bung in a coffee can with some
thinner for a couple of days and see what happens.


Someone might suggest pressurizing the inside of the carboy and
blowing
the bung out...my guess would be exploding carboy time.  Don't
"brick"
the carboy just yet (this is more fun than thinking about A/B,
grain
mills or even Zima.


P.S . I talked to a guy who lived in Saudi Arabia for four years. 
Of
course, alcohol is illegal so there is lots of "homebrewers".  He
is
from Europe and is used to real beer.  His recipe:
Buy a bunch of non-alcoholic "malt" beer (over 25 types available
in
Saudi).


Throw a bunch of sugar in the "beer".  Add "yeast" (probably
champagne).
Brew up to 11% alcohol!!.  Mix some non-alcoholic beer back in to
cut
back to "normal " beer %.  Ymmmm.  Told me that sometimes you get 
gushers.  I told him about sanitation which came as somewhat of a 
learning experience.  Now that is down-home brewing.

On a recent trip to England and few pints in merry old London I had Sam
Smith's Museum Ale. There was a distinct taste of wood
bitterness/astringency in this ale. The first and only English ale I have
ever had that had this characteristic. Sam Smith's kegs this beer in wooden
casks. The vast majority of their ales are kegged in metal kegs. I too
thought that wood flavors and tastes was a myth until I tasted this beer.
Was the taste good or bad? Well I would say it was subtle enough to add some
interest. Would I add oak chips to my ales to try and achieve this flavor?
No! Now if you got a french oak keg around and can clean it well (you
wouldn't believe what Sam Smith's goes through to clean theirs) and can
drink the entire keg in a week or two, I say give it a try. Short of that,
forget the oak chip additions.

This seems to be the received wisdom on this issue, but I'd like to
contest it. Logs and rocks are respectively floating and sitting on
the bottom and this is precisely NOT what suspended solids are
doing. Floating and sitting solids have no effect on the density
but suspended solids will: your hydrometer drops into the fluid and
raises the volume of liquid it displaces, suspended solids
included. Assuming the suspended solids are heavier than the
liquid, it will require a smaller volume to balance the weight of
the hydrometer. 


The difference is that when the particles are suspended they are
part of the fluid; when they float or sink they are not. If putting
the hydrometer in the sample makes any suspended particles rise
with the fluid, the particles will affect the reading.


However, for a particle to be suspended for any significant length
of time its density must be very close to that of the liquid, so
the real answer is that it probably doesn't matter.

Subject: Partial Mashing


Hi Dave,
Saw your post.
One thing I want to bring to your attention is that for a partial mash, you are
working under the limiting conditions of your Boil Pot. yes, you had noted this
but it is important to realize that Mashing Theory aside, YOU can only use 4.5
gallons of Wort. So: Here are the Rules and Exceptions,
1. 1.3 quarts water per lb grain to Mash.
2. 1.5 times That much water to sparge with.
3. Have more sparge water on hand in case you run out (Yes!).
4. The grain bed will absorb a lot, hence #3.
5. Figure on how much grain you need for your target assuming 30 pts per lb per
gallon and then add another lb and don't worry about your efficiency.
6. Forget about stopping the sparge when you get to 1.008; stop when you have
4.5 gallons or as much as you want. (you will probably be at 1.015 or better,
but who cares, grain is cheap).


For a first partial mash, you want to be concerned with proper technique and
not have to worry about whether you are making enough. Quality not Quantity.
So, pad your amounts. Think about hot side aeration ahead of time so your
runoff tube is not splashing the fresh wort into your boiling pot. Raise the
pot up so that it fills smoothly, just like when you are bottling. I thought
about it after the fact one time and ended up spilling 1.5 gallons of my first
runnings into the carpet! <8-0
Take a gravity reading when you are done sparging, add your extract, mix it up
well and then take another gravity reading for your boil gravity so you can
plan your hop schedule. This way you can calculate your efficiency (I know what
I said, but you will be curious anyway) and still work your Hop equations.
Mashing is really quite easy, just take your time. 
PS. I tend to Mash for 60-80 minutes.

using a wire hanger that has been bent in order to fit the hook
