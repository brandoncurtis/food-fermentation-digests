Subject: Jim Busch & Bud vs Ice Bud & Yeast Wars




I would like to thank Jim Busch on behalf of myself and hundreds (thousands?)
of
other brewers reading the digest for the excellent primer on grains posted in
Digest #1475.  It is this selfless spirit of helpfullness and the sharing of
information that makes this forum renown.  Thanks for making it work Jim!


now, in other news:  the other night I was seized with curiosity.  Just exactly
what was the difference between Bud and Bud Ice?  Exactly how hot is the "ice"
they use to brew it?  I trucked down to the local Plaid Pantry and bought a
bottle of "Bud" (just bud, not dry, or lite, or clear, or draft (ha!) or
anything) and a bottle of "Ice Bud" and took them home to compare.  I took
bottles from the dark part of the cooler hoping to find beer spared the UV
light.  Also at this point I must add that I am not a beer judge, I just play
one on the homebrew digest.


                        "Ice Bud"                "Bud"
- -------------------------------------------------------------------
color in bottle:        lite!  (clear bottle)        dark brown (brown bottle)
color in glass:                golden yellow                very pale yellow
head:                        none at all                small fizzy head
Taste:                        vague malty taste        no taste at all, like thick
                                    vague alcohol aftertaste        water.  hint of
sweetness?
                    hint of sweetness?
specific grav.                1.010                        1.008


conclusions: Ice Bud has an actual perceptable flavor which I think tastes
better than Bud (i.e. tastes better than nothing).  Maybe the ice brewing thing
really works ;> ?  How Bud manages to have absolutely no taste I'll never
figure out.  I was actually impressed that the beer I bought wasn't skunked
like most bud I've experienced.


also, results of my belgian dry yeast packet from under the can lid vs Wyeast
Belgian ale.  I made a batch of Brewferm Diablo.  I split a litre or three off
and fermented it with the yeast pack from under the lid, and used Wyeast
belgian
(fermented in the mid 60's F) for the rest:


The dry yeast gave the beer acceptable flavor reminiscent of belgian beers I've
tasted.  However, the liquid yeast developed a much more pleasant final
product.  It's as if the dry yeast flavor has rough edges, and flavor of the
liquid is smooth and soft.  Results of the famed girlfriend test:


dry yeast beer:                um... tastes slightly like cough syrup
liquid yeast beer:        fruity!  interesting!


conclusion:  chuck the yeast packet, shell out the cash for good liquid yeast.

Subject: Sake making, part 1


In HBD #1476, Jim Cave asks for tips on making sake for a friend.
Last year I bought Fred E.'s book on how to make sake. His method
wasn't real clear, so I tried to interpet what he said
into something that I could use. I made sake last spring using the
first method mentioned here. Since then, Fred came out with a
'different' method, and I did the same interpetation of that method.
I have not tried the second one. I sent examples of the first
method to the nationals this year. I'd like to tell you how well it
did, but I've not received my judging sheets back from them. Youl'd
think that for a 10$ entry fee, they could at least keep track of
the entrants. Oh well, that's a gripe for another time. In any case,
I'm rather proud of the sake that I did make, even though it
didn't win the nationals...


In any case, Fred does publish a Sake newsletter, which contains
a lot of information on commercial sake and tasting critiques.
If you are interested, give me a buzz and I'll give you the
address.


Good luck!

Subject: Bung in carboy


I have never used this method to get a bung out of a carboy, but it works
great for getting corks out of wine bottles. Take a bandana and tie a
knot in one corner. put the knotted corner in the bottle with the rest
of the bandana laying flat around the opening of the bottle. Shake the
cork onto the bandana and into the mouth of the bottle. Now slowly pull
the bandana. The cork will snug into the mouth of the bottle and the
knot will catch on the backside of the cork and pull it right out. A
little lubricant will make it easier.

Subject: Hydrometer/Temperature variation table


A few new brewers have queried about Hydrometer readings that vary due to
wort temperatures.  I posted this table from Byron Burch's "Brewing Quality
Beers: the Homebrewer's Essential Guidebook" (1986) some time ago, but
thought it was worth reposting. The temp. is the beer/wort temp. at the
time of gravity reading.

    the following is a question posed by Danny Dumps of Outhouse Brewing
    McKinnleyville Ca.  forwarded by ELQ1


     Howdy folks, After reading Illkas comments on modern brewing, I thought
  I'd stop chilling by carrying the boiler and dunking it in a creek, so I 
  stole, or I mean bought some copper tubing and a friend said to wrap it 
  around a parking pipe, but they are 4" and I need a least 8" so I went to
  the Safeway parking lot and used a light standard, its just over 8". I      
  wrapped it real nice and tight and it looks good, now for my question,
   How do I get the dinged dang thing off the light standard?

Subject: Beer-Bread Recipe


I FTP'ed this off a recipe archive for vegetarians. It's pretty simple. Not 
quite up to the sophistication of the all-grain brewers 8-), no doubt. But hey,
we LOWLY EXTRACT BREWERS gotta do our thing too! Oh,I ain't baked it so...


3 cups self-rising flour
1 12-oz can/bootle of GOOD of beer
2 tablespoons sugar


Mix ingredients and put into greased loaf pan.  Don't overmix.  Bake at
375 degrees for about 1 hour.


Options:  You can cut down on the self-rising flour and add whole-wheat
flour, bran flakes, rolled oats, nuts, and 1/2 cup raisins in any
combination.  For example, I use 1 cup white flour, 1 cup whole-wheat

Subject: Stuck Bung


To the guy with the Stuck Bung in his carboy, I think the perfect tool for
removing it is one of those bow-fishing arrows.  They have a collapsable
barb on each side of the arrow point.  So, if the bung has a hole in it,
he should be able to slip this point thru (collapsed) and have the barbs
open when he pulls on it.  VOILA!


If the bung doesn't have a hole maybe he could just shoot this arrow
into the bung with the bow and VOILA!  Safety goggles might be in order
for plan B.

          Has anyone primed with fruit sugars/juices?  
          
          Any ideers on the proper amount of fruit juice 
          per 5 gallons to add just PRIOR to bottling?
          Tasty results can be had by priming with corn sugar,
          honey, unfermented wort, etc... but what are the 
          conversions of 1 cup honey = X cups fruit juice, 
          apple or other.   Can't you just imagine peach, 
          apricot, apple, pear, strawberry, raspberry, etc?
          
          This might take longer than corn sugar, but it 
          should be worth the wait.

Subject:  Re: Carboy Bunging Problem


Just my .02 worth:


If the stopper has a hole in it life is good.  Just string to the middle of a
short nail ( the length of the nail must be less than the width of the carboy
openning).  Turn the carboy upside-down, and shake it till the stopper gets
stuck in the opening with the hole facing down.  Then, while holding onto the
end of the string (w/o the nail) push the nail thru the hole in the stopper .
 The nail will now fall flat and you can pull on the string to remove the
stopper.  


I have done this far too many times...

Subject: yeast culturing


I have a couple of questions about culturing yeast.


1.  The yeast faq says that dried malt extract is the best medium to use for
starter cultures.  I made up a culture medium from DME, but it is very
turbid--lots of suspended solids after autoclaving.  I could
filter/decant the clear wort off of the hot break material, and then 
re-autoclave, but this seems like too much work.  I know that some people
grow yeast on laboratory media, such as LB or YM.  Will yeast that are
grown in these media be good for pitching?  Or do they really need to be grown
in malt extract medium?  My goal is to inoculate a liter or so of _clear_
medium with a colony, grow up the yeast, and then pitch.


2.  Is there a recommended number of active (ie, glycogen-containing) yeast
cells to be added to 5 gal of wort?  Or, to put it another way, what is the
optimum concentration (cells/ml) of active yeast in the wort right after
pitching?  Can you count the number of _active_ cells microscopically?


3.  What is the relationship between initial yeast concentration and wort
oxygenation?  If you pitch at high levels, is less oxygen required in the wort? 
(I am going on the assumption that the oxygen is required for yeast
multiplication, and if lots of yeast is added, less growth is required.)


4.  Bringing back the thread of "Who Owns The Kegs?" (and at the risk of
injecting more "lawyer-eeze" into things):  Who owns the yeast strains?  If a
company spends lots of time and $ developing a great strain, is it stealing to
culture and maintain that strain yourself, instead of buying it from them each
time you brew?  I know that some strains of bacteria are patented...  Just some
food for thought.


Thanks in advance for any info about culturing.

An issue that has come into prominence recently is that of liability
for alcohol-related accidents.  (I.e., someone gets in a wreck on the
way home from a club meeting.)  Some clubs have incorporated in order
to shift potential liability from individual members to the
corporation (which is essentially penniless, so not a good target for
lawsuits).

Hi All


All Grain Equipment Questions:
     My wife just bought me a Gott Cooler for my B.D., so I shall
be transitioning to all grain soon.  I was wondering about brew
pots.  I have seen adds in brew supply catalogs and seen canning
pots in department stores for 8-8.5 gal ceramic on steel pots,
but they are listed as medium duty.  I have also read in the HBD
of some brewers whose ceramic on steel brew pots had the handle
break off.  How sturdy/reliable are these brew pots, and how
would I know short of buying one?    I know that kegs can be
modified, but don't have one, ye

Subject: New(?) German Malts in USA


Red Bank Brewing and Brunswick Brewing (both NJ) have begun selling German
malts from the Steinbach maltster. At least the label says Maelzerei
Steinbach. Supposedly, they are the exclusive importer and have brought
in 40,000 lbs. Zip City (NYC), Mountain Valley (NY), and Stoudt's (PA) have
all bought some according to the owners of the stores. I haven't gotten
much info from them, mostly because they are hard to pin down. I've been
told the protein level is 11%, but haven't seen any data. Now the real
interesting part is the grain types:


Pilsener
Vienna (10L)
Wheat
Dunkel Wheat
Dunkel
Faro (black)
Sour
Rauch (smoked)


The sour is used in lieu of water treatment in Germany, but I can see uses
for it in a Wit. Zip City is unveiling their smoked beer next week which was
made with 100% Rauch malt (which I find hard to believe). A dark wheat with
dark wheat malt sounds good and if that is real Vienna malt, I can see an
Octoberfest coming up. The Dunkel malt is supposedly a dark (20L) pilsener
malt. Has anyone heard of this stuff? Dr. Fix?
I bought some and plan to try some experimenting, but I'd like to here
from others who have information.


Price? $1.50/lb, discounts start at 20 lbs with 55 lbs. for $44.50.
Brunswick Brewing - 908-572-5353 (my closest store `at` 30 mins away)
Red Bank Brewing  - 908-842-7507 (Tom is the true importer of this)

  This recipe, inspired by others I've read here and in the _Cat's_Meow_,
turned out well and I thought I'd share it.  OK, OK, I'm an extract 
brewer (my father keeps telling me to graduate to all-grain) but I can 
still enjoy a good beer!


Dave Deaven




  "Merry Ann and Ginger Ale"
  Ingredients for 5 gallons
  6.6# John BUll light extract
  3C crystal malt, crushed
  1C roasted barley, crushed
  hunk ginger, grated
    steep the crystal malt, barley, and ginger in warm
    water to make a tea to be added to the boil.
  1oz N. Brewer's hops (50 min, bittering)
  hunk ginger, grated (5 min)
  1oz Cascade hops (aroma, <5 minutes)
  chill quickly.  OG=1.042
  1pkg EDME ale yeast + 1pkg John Bull ale yeast
    hydrate in pint of 100F water at least
    10 min before pitching
  Rack to secondary after peak krausen (2 days for me).
  Prime and bottle when done (8 days total for me).




  This had a great ginger bite when bottled, and after
  10 days in the bottle is a delicious brew with a pleasant
  ginger finish.  It's not very full-bodied, and this 
  strange yeast combination produces a characteristic taste I'm sure
  can be improved, but the method of adding ginger at the end of
  the boil seems to have produced the effect I was looking for, so
  I'm happily relaxing.

Subject: Extraction efficiency


I brewed an Alt today with a single decoction mash and got 105% extraction
efficiency!  So what is wrong with this picture:


I took a number of SG readings throughout the boil.  Initially I had 8
gallons, boiled for a while and reduced it to 7.  Both readings give
extractions of 105+%.  At 6 gallons I had 1.041 (corrected) which yields
about 102+%.  I used 4 lbs Klages and 3 lbs Light Munich.  I was aiming at
an OG of 1.048 and hit 1.045 with 4.75 gallons into the carboy.


Are my expected points for an infusion mash and a decoction mash (even a
single) that much more efficient? 


8 gallons at SG `at` 51.00 C: 1.020
             SG `at` 59.00 F: 1.031


7 gallons at SG `at` 43.00 C: 1.028
             SG `at` 59.00 F: 1.036  (corrected)

Subject: Tubing qualities


Hello homebrewers,
I'm relatively new to the Digest, but have been inspired and educated by the
info and threads
shared on it.


I made my first all-grain pale ale a few days ago and got psyched up and
prepared for it by
reading some back logs of the Digest... and things went great. My
approximation of Fuller's
London Pride is merrily bubbling away.
An attempt to give some info after taking so much - regarding tubing
formulations - hope it's of
interest.
Norprene A-60 (R) tubing is designed for high temperature applications, with
a range from neg
60 to plus 275 degrees. It is ozone and U.V. resistant, although those
features aren't so
important. It is flexible but retains its shape, can be autoclaved 5 times
and is compatible with
sanitizers (like Idophor).
Tygon (R) B-44-3 is targeted to the food, dairy and beverage industries, is
heavily used in the
soft drink industry. B-44-4X is used in food and milk processing plants.
Manufacture claims the
bores of each are smoother than stainless steels and won't trap bacteria, and
so flush-clean very
easily. There is a braided version as well.
Anyone looking for a supplier can E-mail me direct. I'm don't make/sell the
stuff - I'm a wildlife
consultant but used the tubings in a previous aquarium business. Hope this
helps.

This sounds great. Could somebody supply the phone number and address of this
Great Western facility in Los Angeles? 
Also, do they only sell pale 2-row to homebrewers on these HBer's Weds? Or
might they also sell some other varieties that I (or anyone else) would be
interested in such as malted wheat?


Also, does anyone know if GW has a malting facility in the Bay Area?

>as I can't imagine this is of general enough interest to warrant posting. 


A couple of years ago I discovered that boiling 1 tablespoon of B-brite 
in a gallon of water after a round of brewing will float the light, white 
sugar scale off the Bruheat element without scrubbing.  If you don't do 
something to remove the white scale, it will become brown the next time, 
then black, and much more difficult to remove.


Pass the word along.  There a lot of Bruheat owners out there who bought 
their Bruheats before I started including this hint in the instructions.
- ---------------------------


On another note, I thoroughly enjoyed Gregg Tennefoss's post yesterday 
about the disasterous experience with his refrigerator that still resulted 
in a good beer.  I've been thinking a lot lately about "guerilla brewing" -
that's when you brew a beer in which several if not all the rules of 
brewing are broken and you still come up with a good beer.  For several
different reasons, I've had the occasion of late to do a couple of
"guerilla brews". They're still fermenting but so far, so good. 


I think Gregg's experience is important.  We spend a lot of time (and 
rightfully so) splitting the fine frog hairs of brewing science trying to 
improve our efforts.  But in doing so, we lose sight of how forgiving 
brewing can be.  I'm reminded of the fellow who was homebrewer of 
the year about three years ago.  He had brewed a dunkelweizen in honor of 
his newly born son.  He checked his beer one day and discovered the cork 
had blown, beer was all over the basement and it had been left unattended 
for a couple of days.  He almost threw it down the drain but decided to 
recork it and give it a chance.  It won Best of Show in the AHA Nationals.


Something to remember when brewing angst strikes.


Cheers!

Andy, stand by to cast off!  I lived in England for 3 years,
compliments of Uncle USAF, and here is the scoop as I know it for
homebrewing.


Wow, perfect choice!  I think the British probably invented the
homebrew industry.  Ever look at the extract kits in your local supply
store?  Most of them are English made, even though the types say
Bavarian Pilsner, Dortmunder Lager, etc.etc.  They started doing
homebrew to beat the Queen's taxes.  They can brew a 5 gal batch, with
one extract kit and some sugar ( :-( ), for about 10p a pint.  About
15 cents.  Far more people homebrew over there then here!  Supplies
for brewing can be bought in every chemist's shop (term for drug
store).  Even the small one in our village carried things.  The larger
ones like Boots the Chemist's has pressure barrels (I brought 2 back),
all the wine and beer supplies that you can stand.  If you watch and
catch sales you can get extract kits for about 2 Pound 50 Pence which
is about $4.00 American.  Those are the average kits, and higher
quality ones go up 1 or 2 Pounds Sterling.  Generally I found that
kits are half the cost of here.  My pressure barrels were 20 Pounds
each, or about $32.00.  Over here the same thing costs $70-75.


You can take your B-B-Q grill, and get your American propane bottle
refilled, however there's one catch...The normal way the British buy
propane is to bring in their empty bottle, and trade it in on a full
one.  There are two kinds of bottles and fittings.  One for cooking
and one for heating (calor gas room heaters) I think the threads on
the heating bottle is the one that fits the American regulator.  It is
cheaper to use their bottles, you get more for less.  Not every little
propane supplier can fill your American bottle, because all the little
distributers send their emptys into the big plant to get them
refilled, and delivered back to their shop...so you have to locate the
nearest propane "filling station" if you want to do it that way, and
you will pay a little more for that service!


You won't have any trouble finding folks that homebrew, it is a way of
life for many.  Many try and brew as cheaply as possible, hince the
sugar brewing.  Well, I could talk all day, send me an email with your
further questions and I'll get you answers.  I still have British
friends I keep in touch with over there.

I was wondering if anyone has made, or knows how to make Japanese/Chinese style
rice wine.  I'm interested in learning the process.  If you know a good recipe,
please contact me directly at:

Subject: Boiling stones


There was a recent thread on boiling aids to prevent boil over.  Bottom
bottles, melted or otherwise, and I think some one called one such thing a
"clacker"?  Basically we are talking about boiling stones, an aid to
bubble nucleation.  I use bottle caps (5-10) - used ones since I generate
so many.  Also used ones are nicely bent so they can't stick to the
bottom. 


Cheers!

Subject: Yeast starters


I have been doing something for a while with my yeast starters that is
counter to the "standard model".  It has worked well for me and I'm
describing it here to perhaps elicit comment.  Using standard canning
techniques I make 1500 ml of starter solution (~1.040) and end with 3
Pilsner Urquell 550 ml bottles capped and cooling.  When they are finally
at room temp 2 go into the refridgerator and one is decanted into a
sterile 1000 ml flask.  This flask is innoculated and fitted with an
airlock and placed in the dark.  It is allowed to ferment out and
flocculate which takes about 48 hrs.  The supernatant is decanted and the
second 500 ml aliquot of wort (at room temp) is added.  This one goes a
bit faster and is allowed to ferment out and floculate too.  The same with
the 3 aliquot of wort.  In 5-7 days I have about an inch of yeast in the
bottom of the flask, not slurry, nearly pure yeast.  Now, on brew day
while transferring cool wort from kettle to carboy, I decant the 3rd
supernatant from the yeast flask and divert ~500 ml of the wort into the
flask which is refitted with the airlock.  While I spend the next 30
minutes rocking and rolling my carboy to aerate, the yeast wakes up and
starts burping, then I pitch. 


Why do I do this?  I make my starters with light DME (no hops), a yeast
nutrient (YNB), and water.  Pitching rates can require 1-2 quart or more
starters.  A 2 quart starter is ~10% of the volume of a 5 gallon batch.
Even 1 quart is ~5%.  This is quite a contribution to the final product. 
I mean, people are worried that their keg gaskets will impart flavors and
aromas to their beer!  What do you think 1/2 gallon starter of some
totally different recipe does!  So that's my rational, it is an attempt
to pitch only yeast and no other ingredients into my carefully crafted
recipe.


Given that everything is done with the utmost care to sanitation (squirt 
bottle of 95% ethanol, flame throwers, etc.) any comments?
