Subject: Pepper beer and clarification


Greetings all,


        I've just tried a pepper beer I started a couple weeks ago, and I
noticed something unusual. It was amazingly clear. Clearer than any beer
I've ever made (I've been brewing, extract only, for about 4yrs). I didn't
use any finings of any sort, and it fermented (and aged) in a corner of my
non-airconditioned CT apartment (temps in the 70s-90s) for less than 3
weeks start to finish.
        The recipe follows:


        1 can (4lb)        Alexanders wheat malt
        1 can (1.4lb)        Alexanders pale malt kicker
        1oz                Cascades (boil)
        1/2 oz.                Cascades (finish)
        2                Scotch Bonnet peppers (habaneros) diced, frozen
                        (the only way I can stand to cut them, zow!)
        Winsor yeast        First time I tried this one. (Dry yeast, BTW).


        Boiled for about 45 minutes, added the peppers after the heat was
shut off.  Cooled by immersing the pot in ice water bath.  Piched yeast from
starter (about 20oz, made in Alexanders can).  Bottled in a week, aged about
two (maybe a day or two less).
        When I poured the first sample the other day is was clear, a lovely
amber color, but totally clear!  (It also has a nice mellow pepper finish :-9 )
It looked like it had been filtered or something, but there was a good
sedmient on the bottom, so I know there were yeast in there :-)


        Any ideas as to what might have done this?  Perhaps the capiscum(sp?)
in the peppers?  Maybe some really fine yeast?  I'd certainly like to be able
to replicate this clarity (esp. for a nice light amber beer!).

Subject: Topping off the boil, Siphoning


In #1480, I posted details of a dispute between brew-buddy Brent and I
regarding topping off the boil, and whether it would lead to HSA,
impotence, etc.  Since I've seen no HBD replies, and the only email
replies I received expressed confusion about what the heck "topping off
the boil" means, I'll eat a little more BW explaining, then pray to
Ninkasi for guidance.


My cut-off keg brewpot holds about 12g (regretfully, I cut it off at the 
sides).  While I go so far as to dare 5g batches to boil over, I am
humbled when dealing with 10g, since I'm down to about 8" of headspace.


For these 10g batches, rather than watch the brewpot constantly, I've
been first boiling 8g of wort (providing that much needed extra few
of inches of headspace), then adding hops, then finally adding 2g of
hot tap water (well water, no chlorine), restoring the boil, and boiling
for the next hour, usually with stepped hop additions.


The hot tap water sits for a few minutes prior to addition, and seems
relatively oxygen free.  I try to pour slowly, and avoid splashing.


So, wise ones: is this hosed, or a good solution for cranking out those
bigger batches?


On siphoning: You can't beat the curved "candy cane" style racking
canes with the plastic cup at the tip. I like to store the carboy
with the back side elevated about 1/4", leaving a shallow spot in the
sludge.  The racking cane then fits well diagonally in the carboy, with
the tip in the shallow spot.  Works like a charm.


I have a cone shaped plastic thing designed to sit in the neck of the
carboy, with a grove through it to hold the racking cane.  This thing
is a series of stepped cylinders, much like the drill bits that cut
increasingly large holes.  It worked OK, but I like the curved cane
better.  It came from a brew supply store in Grand Rapids, MI: I'm
not recommending it, just providing a lead if anyone is interested.

Subject: HSA during mash


Howdy from Zion!


I am just beginning my foray into all-grain brewing (mainly concern over
content of extracts!) and have been avidly reading the advice given here.
My question is about HSA during lautering.  I knew that splashing wort into
a fermenter caused HSA, but I was under the impression that aeration
in the extract before the boil would be totally removed by the boil.


Does the lauter HSA cause off flavors that are not removed by the boil?
Do the extract sugars get oxidized by splashing the runnings?


I have other friends who read the HBD and are ready to go all-grain.  A
nice explanation about this pre-boil HSA problem might spare we Utarrr
pioneers a wasted trip to the feed-store for grain.  (Wooden wheels
ain't cheap!)

    Hi All,


    My wife and I are planning a trip to England this fall to celebrate our
anniversary. She doesn't brew, but where beer is concerned she is an
enthusiastic "end-user". We're in the process of planning our itinerary,
and naturally we want to stop at as many pubs that serve cask-conditioned
real ale as possible.
    Can some kind soul please tell me where I can find the CAMRA guide? I'd
also appreciate any personal recommendations. Private email please to
conserve bandwidth, I'll send a copy of the responses to anyone who asks.

The Anchor Brewing company has only done one advertizement to my knowledge.
During the 1992-1993 Baseball season, they put an ad in the Candlestick Park
baseball program that said, "The hometown beer supports the hometown team",
along with a picture of the Steam beer logo. The helped them get the Steam 
beer into the Stick for the baseball season.


But Fritz M. does sponsor artistic endevours such as 'the Anchor Players',
I think this is a string quartet, or some such. But I have never heard of
any other ad, rather than a sponsorship or charity donation.

I was reading with interest the SA summary posted by JK Hopp. I drink
quite a bit of SA. I generally like it. His ale is a bit hoppy for me
but I drink it nevertheless. I use his bottles to bottle my brew. If
you want the labels off, and get them clean, soak them in a solution
of Chlorinated TSP. I used 1 pound in about 10 gallons of water. In a day
the labels were history!

                                      ^^^^^^^^^^
I am quite sure the fermentation temperature is the problem.  Rich Fortnum
told me this yeast does "strange things at warmer temperatures".  I have
had good luck with it at 62 to 65 degF.  I have noticed that this yeast
seems to be extremely attenuative (for example, a 1.068 OG extract batch
went to 1.008!)  Have others noticed this?  I have a scotch (OG 1.100)
going with it now at 62F, and haven't noticed anything strange coming out
of the airlock.  If you can, I recommend you cool it down below 70F, and
preferably below 65F and hope the phenolics are scrubbed out by the CO2.


Scotch ales are traditionally brewed at cool temperatures to help get that
clean maltiness they are known for.  The Caledonia, for example ferments
starting at about 61F, and lets the temp drift up to a maximum of 65F
during the fermentation.  The scottish ale yeast (Wyeasy #1728) seems to 
require that.  I suppose this will draw lots of comments from others who 
have made great beer with this yeast at 90F or something, but what the heck!

Thanks to those who responded to my cry for help! My 1st batch
has turned out to be quite nice. Took about a month to get decent
carbonation. Nice color, good flavor. Not bad for a straight
extract brew. My 2nd batch has carbonated well in just 2 weeks.
Not sure why. I used less extract and added my own hops and a 
different yeast. Doesn't matter it's light and nice. 3rd batch has
been in the bottle a week now. This one was extract, DME, hops,
and crystal malt! I can't wait!


Thanks again,

From: "Harrington, Stephen J" <sharrington`at`msmail4.hac.com>
Subject: SG with suspensions


I thought I would add the following data point to the discussions of SGs.


I bottled a Pale Ale (OG = 1.052) yesterday, and took a sample right at the
start of siphoning into my bottling bucket.  The sample was very cloudy due
to the sediment at the bottom of the carboy.  The FG was 1.022 (Oh no! Too
high. Add less priming sugar).  When bottling was complete, I had enough left
in the bottom of the bucket for another sample.  The reading was 1.017 --
more in line with what i expected and this included the priming sugar I
added.  Given this result, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that
a sample needs to have all suspensions settled out before the measurement is
taken.


Regarding Wyeast w/o packets:  My homebrew supplier said that the first
shipment of the new yeasts which he received did not have the packet, but the
later shipments have all had them.  He had not heard that they were going to
be eliminating the packet. 


I posted a concern over a Jinxed Pils.  


Mark Evans pointed out that temperature changes can cause lager yeast to
'hide' for a while.  He also told me not to be concerned over racking out all
of the yeast and suggested that I try and recycle a good liquid yeast.


Spencer Thomas astutely said:


"Another possibility in your case is this: when you racked, you drove
CO2 out of solution.  At the low fermentation rate you've now got
going in your secondary, all the CO2 is going into solution (CO2 is
very soluble at low temperatures).  If this hypothesis is correct,
then you'll start to see bubbles eventually."


I think this is what happened because after I racked into secondary, I topped
the carboy up to 5 gallons with preboiled water.  This, of course, has no C02
in it, so the apparent cease in fermentation was an illusion.  The CO2 was
not bubbling out because it was in the process of saturating the solution.  


The Pils has a very small ring of bubbles at the neck now and there is
positive pressure in the carboy.  Once again a case of needless worry.  Now
for a homebrew!  Thanks to all for your inputs.

Mail-order buyer beware


I just had a thourally unpleasant experience with a newer Brew
mail-order business, the 'Brew Club' in Santa Cruz.      I placed a
fairly large order which included a carbonator (CO2 fitting for a PET
bottle).   When I got the order, I noticed I'd been overcharged for
this item ($10 in catalog.. $13 on invoice)  I called to inquire and the
woman who always answers said that their supplier had raised his prices
and I could either accept it or mail it back (at my expense).  I decided
to keep it.  A week later I tried it and found it to be defective, altho
it made a wonderful beer super-soaker  :(.  I called back and she said
that the whole batch was defective and she'd send a replacement.  This
too was defective but this time when I called I was told that I would
have to return it (at my expense) to get a replacement.  I did, and when
I called a week later to confirm receipt I was told that since I'd only
returned one, that no further refunds would be given.  I told her I
wasn't aware that she'd wanted the original, at which point she began
whining about her problems with her supplier.  I suggested that if her
supplier was more important than her customer, perhaps she was in the
wrong business.  She said tough beans, and I would not get a refund.


At this point, I'm out $15 with zero recourse.  I won't be doing any
further business with this so-called 'Brew Club'.  I now realize that
once they've got your credit card #, you're pretty much at their mercy.
I've dealt with other homebrew mail-order businesses and on those rare
occasions when there were problems, they've always been professional and
customer focussed.  The moral I guess is deal with a reputable,
established dealer and not a fly-by-night shoestring operation.

Subject: More JK commentary


I think, quite aside from all his other sins, the thing that bothers me
most about Jim Koch is his wrapping himself in the flag of the microbrew
revolution.  I don't think I am alone in this and, for me, at least, it has
nothing to do with the fact that I don't think SA has ever qualified as a
micro.


The problem is that this arrogant statement totally ignores the history of
microbreweries in the western parts of the USA, where Anchor was the
preeminent (if not the only) craft brewer in the country by the mid '70s.
Even if you don't consider Anchor a micro, consider that Seirra Nevada,
Grant's, and Red Hook had 2-3 years of production behind them when Boston
Lager debuted in '85.  By that time Widmer, Hale's, Pyramid, Thomas Kemper
and Bridgeport were in production in the Pacific Northwest alone.  Hell,
even Utah had its first Micro by 1986.


SA may be successful and have wider distribution and larger sales than any
of the craft breweries I have mentioned but that doesn't change the fact
that, in the west, at the very least, there was a strong "grass roots"
craft brew movement underway before SA brewed its first beer.




(My bias towards western breweries results mostly out of ignorance of the
history of micros and craft beer in the east, but that doesn't change the
fact that JK was not the brewer he claims to be.    I would be interesting
in hearing  some of the "early" history of the craft beer movement in the
east, via e-mail, of course)


Cheers.

Subject: Japanese beetles


More on Japanese Beetles from an actual ENTOMOLOGIST.  Hope somebody
hasn't already covered this.
 
Japanese (not "Jap" beetles, please) beetles were introduced to the
US via NJ in about 1916.  They have spread extensively since then. 
There are a variety of products labeled for control of adults. 
Carbaryl (Sevin) and malathion are commonly available and broadly
labeled.  FOLLOW THE LABEL.  If a little is good, stop there.  More
is only more dangerous.  Neither have shown any health effects from
chronic occupational exposure or animal studies as of 1992.  A
nitrite-carbaryl compound has caused tumors in male rats, however. 
Malathion concentrate will etch automobile paint (see drift, below).
 
The half-life of carbaryl in (unspecified in my reference) crop
plants is about two weeks.  You may also have some luck with
Bacillus thuringiensis "BT" or "BTi" preparations ("Thuricide,"
"Dipel").  Be aware that it is illegal to use a product unless it is
labeled for that crop, and it is unlikely that there is much labeled
for hops.  Check with your local Cooperative Extension Service (at
your land grant university, in the phone book under "Agriculture") 
to see if any local exemptions have been granted for your state. 
They know a lot more than Billy-Bob down at the feed store.  They
may also have specific information on hop growing in your state. 
 
Be careful when treating tall hop vines that you do not allow
pesticide to drift onto adjacent property - that's a violation of
the law.  It is also likely that the pesticide you are using is not
labeled for hops - another violation of the law.  Be especially
careful if your neighbors keep bees - bees are not hard to kill and
are specifically protected by most pesticide labels.  Pesticide
regulators have far larger fish to fry, however, than this kind of
thing unless it's brought to their attention (by an irate drifted-
upon neighbor, for example).  
 
Milky spore disease preparations are effective and reasonably
selective but are slow, as they work by suppressing the population
of larvae in the soil (good control is not usually achieved until
the second or third season).  The larger the area you can treat
(your property only, mind you) the longer the recolonization
interval (the time it will take 'em to find your plants) will be. 
Parasite / predator introductions have shown promise in a few cases,
but no commercial preparations are available.  Major native
predators are wheel bugs (Arilus cristatus L. - if you've ever seen
one you'd remember it) and predatory stinkbugs (Podisus sp.). 
Birds, particularly grackles and starlings, are also effective
predators of the adults.  
 
Pheromone and bait traps are effective, but as noted should be
placed away from the crop.  The idea is to establish a perimeter so
that arriving insects will be distracted before they reach the crop.
 
Same with UV bug-zappers; studies have shown that they attract FAR
more than they kill, but will suppress populations in a small area
if set up around the perimeter.  Most people do not use enough of
either to be effective.  That doesn't mean you need a zillion.  Read
the label and use the maximum number allowed.  
 
Hops are a minor crop and it is unlikely that, if any pesticide
products are currently labeled for use on them, they will continue
to be after the re-registration process (as you may have heard, re-
registration and special review by EPA makes glaciers look speedy). 
Given this fact and the emphasis on natural ingredients and purity
among brewers mega, micro and home, I am certain that there is an
IPM (Integrated Pest Management) program either in place or under
development for insects and diseases of hops.  The logical place to
start looking would be USDA's research station in Yakima, WA, or the

Subject: RE: Thin mash; sterility; Columbus brewing?


Bill Marks asks what's wrong with a thin mash.  Although purists may disagree, 
I would say nothing.  When the total mash and sparge volume is excessive, there
is a possibility that you may extract more tanins from the hulls, but a few
quarts more or less won't probably be noticed.


Thomas asks about sterility.  I usually sterrilize all brewing equipment,
bottels, etc. before using them the first time using a fairly strong bleach
sollution (as directed on the back of my bottle).  For subsequent batches,
I don't feel it's necessary to sterrilize provided I clean equipment and 
bottles immediately after use.  Rather, I sanitize using sodium bisulfite 
(available from most brew supply stores) or as a last resort with a mild 
bleach solution (directions for sanitization also on the bottle).  In 12 
years I have never had a gusher, but I'm damn picky about cleaning all 
equipment as soon as I'm done using it.  Don't wory about nasties on hops
spoiling your wort.  If added to the brew kettle, the boiling wort will
kill all nasties. If added to the secondary fermentor, your strong yeast 
culture should be domimant over any minor infections that could be trans-
ferred with the hops. 


Lance asks about the possibility of converting spoiled beer into fuel.  I don't
know if anyone has had success with this, but my beer would be too dilute from
tears to be useful in any distillation.


Now for a question of my own.  I'm contemplating moving to Columbus, Ohio.
Can anyone comment on whether our chosen hoby is legal there.  If so, can
anyone comment on the water quality.  Thanks in advance

Had a chance to attend an invitation only beer/food tasting featuring 
Jim Koch and his beers. It was at a  Italian restaurant called 
"Antonio's" here in Orlando Florida. About 70 people attended, 
mostly distributors, local restaurant/bar owners,  suit and tie 
handshakers.  Only a handful of local brewers. The evening 
started with the lager, his favorite.  The Italian style food & 
beer combo went as follows:


Sorry for the lack of specifics with the food, but I forgot to 
keep the handout of the evenings menu ingredients. 


* Some soft Brie like cheese in Puff Pastry with Half Pear 
   Blanched in Dark Wheat Beer served 
   with Summer Wheat Beer.
* Dumplings cooked in a cream sauce with a Duck 
   Ragu served with Boston Stock Ale
*  entree- Roast Chicken with Italian Sausage, 
   Onions and Green and Red Peppers served 
   with Double Bock
* Espresso Moose served with Cream Stout
* Bread Pudding with served with Honey 
   Porter - first cases in Florida


The Cream Stout and the Honey Porter were served at room 
temperature, all others were ice cold.  The servers were 
pouring the beer to glasses, not decanting.  I noticed Jim 
pouring one for himself till it foamed over and shook the 
bottle to get the froth from the end of the bottle into his glass.


Jim came across as being very personable.  Before the 
dinner he talked to the chefs and tasted most of the foods 
being served to make sure they "worked" well with his beers.  
He didn't have any sort of speech prepared, just talked about each 
of the beers being served and had a few funny stories, very casual.  
He enjoyed mingling and talking to everyone that attended.  He 
spoke of the importance of freshness and quality of ingredients.  
He stressed the fact that beer is a food and should be treated as 
such.  Afterwards he sat with 3-4 of us for an hour or so and enjoyed 
more of his beer and talked brewing and beer.   


Some interesting facts:
 - Double Bock has half pound of malt per bottle.
 - By chance, it was 10 years ago this week that Jim started the Boston
  Brewing Co.
 - Jim's father had an interesting diet plan  -  "There is food in beer, but if
  there isn't any beer in the food just drink beer."
 - Triple Bock is aged in old Jack Daniel barrels.  Its taken three years to
  isolate his "ninja" yeast for the brew.  It is a 17%  alcohol brew, 18% 
  is the limit for yeast.  Bottles are 8 oz. cobalt blue with a X caret
  gold label and a sherry style cork.  Will not be available in Florida 
  (only state, DOH!)    


Bash him if you like - I enjoy(ed) his beers.  Standard Disclaimers apply!

I'll tell you, had someone hit me up for money when I appeared for my
first club meeting, I would never have attended a second one.  We do
have some sort of policy like that "on the books," adopted at a time
when we had several people who came to meeting after meeting to suck
up the beer.  These parasites didn't brew and had no real plans to
start, and never brought beer of any kind to share, but they always
brought their mugs, you betcha ...  So we adopted that policy, and it
did indeed chase away our tapeworms, and then we dropped the enforcement
of it altogether in the interest of putting on our most friendly face
to prospective members.  This is a situation, I think, where the gesture,
rather than the actual dollar amount, sends the message.


I've noticed, by the way, that hardly anyone attends two meetings
without joining.

Hi all.


The first item is probably for people in the Seattle/Bellevue/King county 
area. although anyone with some experiences in this area, your info/caveats 
would be appreciated.


I am interested in buying a bulk shipment of Belgian DeWolf- Cosyns Pale Ale 
Malt, uncrushed, from Certified foods in California. The thing is: they only 
accept orders of 500 lbs or more (in 50 lb sacks) It would be a _looonnnng_ 
time before I could use all that grain, so is anyone else out there 
interested in buying into a BIG shipment of uncrushed, premium grain? I dont 
know If I can mix and match grain types within the order, but they carry the 
full line of DWC specialty grains, including Special B and color malts. Keep 
in mind that the only individual size is 50 lb sacks. their price on 500lbs 
of Pale Ale Malt is $.53 per pound. This isn't the best deal on basic Pale 
Ale Malt, but keep in mind that this is a higher grade of grain. If anyone 
knows of a competitor that can match apples to apples, let me know!!


 For more info E-mail: nmcgaugh`at`hq.walldata.com


Does anyone know of a good source for used  *elephant* kegs? these are the 
***HUGE*** kegs that breweries used to use a few years ago, before the days 
of spinal litigation..you probably can guess what I want it for. Mail order 
is fine.. *no* i'm not gonna be using 300lbs of the DWC malt order on this 
baby.. :*)


On a similar note: anybody know of a good source for ??55?? gallon food 
grade buckets?? These would have to be beer/wine/mead/cider friendly, and 
airtight(lid) and preferrably nonporous (walls) for grain storage or 
fermenters.(getting into the lambic/barleywine/mead kick) cole parmer has 
been pathetically slow in getting me a catalog, and all of the restaraunt

     Having seen various references to "Gott coolers", I came to
the realisation that these are the big insulated boxes that you
take on picnics to keep stuff cool (homebrew being one example).
I haven't heard the name "Gott" in the UK so wasn't sure at first.
Since then, I've spent a couple of weeks, on and off, checking
out every picnic cooler I could find in any shops I happened to
be in. The 10 gallon capacity has often been mentioned as the
best size - could I find a 10 gallon cooler? Not a chance.
"Perservere Brian, I told myself". Then today, reading HBD 1482
about Gott coolers, it dawned on me....
     For those who haven't guessed it by now - you're obviously
all talking about 10 US gallon capacity - I've been looking at
these things in EVERY SHOP I've been in but because I was
thinking 10 Imp. gallons I ignored them. Picnic coolers here are
marked in Litres - the 35 Litre capacity ones that I've seen
everywhere are 9 1/4 US gallons which is probably as near as I'm
going to get. I've been looking for 45 Litre coolers! Oh well.
     One small example of confusion "across the water".
 
Cheers,
 
     Brian

Still working on my first batch, I sanitized the secondary (ok, I sanitized
everything), added 1oz Fuggles and 1oz Golding hops pellets to it, then racked
the beer into it.  It's one week later, and not bubbling at all, but I do see
bits of hops rising and falling in the beer.  The haze is gradually clearing,
but I see no signs of the hops getting out of the way so I can bottle.  Should
I just keep waiting and expect the hops to all settle (most seem to be floating
on top of the beer since the start) to the bottom?
