Hiya


Thanks to everyone again for your answers to my questions about 
strike temps in infusion mashing etc.  I guess I should get one 
of those thread search programmes for old HBD issues (But I ain't 
Gott ;-) no PC though) coz it seems most of the info had already 
been discussed in the past, so as a pointer to info about the 
thermodynamics of calculating strike temps I refer you to an 
article (which Rick kindly sent to me) in HDB #1207 by Kelly 
Jones.  


If you want me to send you the info then I'll be pleased to do 
so.  


Kelvin (kelvink`at`mtu.edu) also sent me some nifty info on infusion 
mashing that any newbies out there (like me) to all grain might 
like, if you want it then gimme a buzz (if there is enough 
interest I will see about posting it instead of mailing if that 
is ok by Kelvin).  Apparently some of the info was supposed to be 
going into a "Mash FAQ", has anyone seen hide nor hair of that 
beasty? Might be a good thing to have at an ftp site like Sierra.

     I made use of the heat from the heat exchanger on the
back of my fridge-freezer by accident. The first place I
had a few years back was quite small and the only place to
ferment my beer was in a corner in the kitchen beside the
fridge-freezer. It wasn't until the weather turned a bit
colder that I realised the corner was always quite warm
from the heat exchanger. The thing was quite inefficient
and would switch on for long periods of time so gave off
some reasonable heat. Of course, this obviously made my
electricity bill a bit higher but kept my beer happy.

          Jim Grady and his 5 year old son ask:
          Why do they call it hops if it doesn't hop off?
          
           The name "hop" comes from the German word "hopfen". It is 
          only pluralized as "hops" because "hop" refers to a single 
          ripe cone of the "Humulus Lupulus" plant. Only the female 
          flowers produce the cones used in beermaking.
          
           Just tell your son to help them "hop off" and I'm sure he 
          will be happy to harvest your hops!

I've been using "Electrosol" automatic dishwashing soap.  A little in the 
carboy and fill it with the sink sprayer, let sit overnight , and everything 
rinses out in the morning.  This seems to work better than bleach for me.

Subject: M. Garetz and Hop Utilization




I would like to thank Mark Garetz for his contribution to the literature
available to the homebrewer.  His book "Using Hops" is an excellent
reference on a broad spectrum of questions concerning hops and
brewing.  My question for the net is to ask if anyone has started using
the "Boil-time utilization" numbers that Mark recommends.  Based on my
experience (and biases), Mark's numbers for hop utilization in the boil
are quite low.  Further, many other references seem to be at odds with
or contradict Mark's numbers.  


For example, the table below lists the results computed with a
spreadsheet that replicates the hop calculations as discussed in George
and Laurie Fix's book on Vienna beers.  The calculations are based on a
typical Vienna with a brewlength of 18.9 liters, Target OE of 13 P, and
Target IBU of 25 (mg/L).  This "typical" beer assumed three hop 
additions with 60, 30, and 15 minute boil times and alpha-acid fractions
of 0.04, 0.05, and 0.03 respectively.  Given these brew specs., the only
parameter allowed to vary in the spreadsheet was the boil-time
utilization values - which were taken from the authors indicated in the
column headings of the table.  Note that for Garetz's numbers I did one
calculation with CA = 1 so that "boil-time only" results could be
compared with the other author's numbers.  In the third column (where CA
was not assumed to be equal to 1), the adjustment factors included are 
the Gravity Factor (GF), Hop Rate (HF), and the Temperature Factor (TF).


                    Fix      Rager      Garetz    Garetz w/CF =1


Total Hops [g]     63.80     70.9       209.7      182.7
Total Hops [oz]     2.25      2.5         7.4        6.4




The question I must raise here is that while the Rager and Fix
utilization rates might not have been optimal  - is it possible that
they were off by a factor of 200% to 220% ???


Observation:  Where Mark's boil time numbers have a significant impact
on hop weight calculations are in the additions with 0-15 min. boil
times.  It is "commonly" accepted that these late additions are done to
enhance the hop aromatic content of the beer - aromatics that are
evaporated off with longer boil times.  The bulk of the literature prior
to Mark's book however, has assumed that "some" isomerization still
takes place at these shorter boil times. Fix for example, assumes a 10%
utilization rate and Rager assumes an 8% rate for additions with 15 min.
boil duration.  If one chooses (as the Fix's suggest in some of their
recipes) to have 15% of the total iso-alpha acids in a beer be
contributed by the 15 min. addition, it is not hard to show that their
addition must increased by 360%  - if one uses Mark's utilization
numbers.  For a Vienna I suggest this will result in a hop nose 
completely out of character for the style.  


My point here is not to refute Mark's boil-time utilization numbers.
Rather it is to point out that if they are correct then one must 
take much more care in planning when hop additions are to take 
place to get the desired balance of bitterness and aromatics.  
At least more planning than has been suggested by the HB literature
in the past.  Mark's book touches on this point -(but there could
have been more  - see chapter 9, pg. 152). 


It seems we might need a "when-to-add vs. style" table. Perhaps 
in a later edition of the book - Mark?

Subject: All-grain newbie, other misc stuff


Greetings all.  I am a relative newcomer to the world of all-grain,
but I was so very happy with my first batch that I will continue
brewing beers from scratch!  Anyway, this past weekend I made a golden
ale with 8.5 lbs of pale malt and a bit of crystal malt (2 ounces).
I did a single-step infusion mash for one hour, and then I sparged
with a simple lauter tun fashioned from two buckets, one with
lots of drilled holes.  But I wound up with an OG of 1.030!!
I was indeed majorly bummed.  The first time I did an all-grain
I wound up with an extraction efficiency of around 25 pts/lb/gallon,
so you can see that I've taken a giant step backwards.  
        Would doing a decoction mash or mashing for a longer
period of time help my extraction?  BTW, I used Klages 2-row pale
malt that was crushed with a Corona.  I don't have the time and/or
space for lots more equipment, so I would appreciate hearing
from anyone on how I could improve my extraction efficiency
without too much extra trouble.  TIA to everyone!
        Regarding yeast culturing for the home brewer: I
have made some malt/agar plates for growing some yeast, but they
tend to run.  Adding more agar didn't help.  I am a biologist
with accesss to lots of LB plates, so I was wondering if anyone
has cultured yeast on these plates.  I tried it once on an
LB plate, but was surprised when it took three days at 30 degreesC
for any colonies to show up.  What's the trick?
        Also, does anyone have a good all-grain recipe for
"Pete's Wicked Ale"?  I'd like to make something similar.  I thought
about about 9 or 10 lbs of pale malt, about a pound of Crystal
malt, and about 1/2 pound of chocolate malt.  Cascades?  Would
Wyeast 1056 do the trick?  Thanks to anyone with some advice and
experience.
        Good brewing to you all, and thanks for the help!

Does your regulator have a check valve?  If so, this may explain a delta
pressure between your keg and regulator output.  Isn't the accepted
pressure drop in these valves about 2 psi?  Is your regulator reading
2 psi higher than bleeder or vise-versa?

Subject: Roasting Brown Malt


I have seen the odd request for info on roasting your own malt to
produce Amber and Brown malts.  The following is reproduced from the
appendices of the Durden Park Old British Beers book. If you wish you
may reproduce this provided you acknowledge the source (as is usual).


Do you want this in the archives at Sierra?


    Home Roasting Pale Malt to Pale Amber, Amber and Brown Malt
    -----------------------------------------------------------


Some ingredients needed to make OLD BEERS might not readily be 
available, in particular pale amber, amber and brown malts. All 
three can be made by roasting pale malt in a normal domestic oven as 
described below. Carapils with a colour number of 25 can be used as 
a substitute for pale amber. However, carapils has little diastatic 
activity and, as with any low activity grain, eg. roast barley, 
brown malt, amber malt, it should not exceed 45% of the total grist, 
the balance being pale malt. Carapils, however, might only be 
available by bulk purchase direct from maltsters.


Roasting Method
- ---------------


Line a large baking tin with aluminium foil, and pour in pale malt 
to a depth of 12 mm (1/2 inch). Place in the oven (preferably fan-
stirred) at 100 C (230 F) for 45 minutes to dry out the malt, then 
raise the temperature to 150 C (300 F).  After a further 20 minutes 
remove 6 or 7 corns from the tray, slice across the centre with a 
sharp knife and compare the colour of the starchy centre with that 
of a few pale malt corns. The pale malt is almost pure white; for 
pale amber the colour should be the palest buff, just noticeably 
different from the pale malt. Continue heating until this colour is 
obtained, usually about 30 minutes.


For amber malt, continue heating until the cut section is distinctly 
light buff, usually 45 to 50 minutes. If brown malt is needed, raise 
the temperature at this point to 175 C (350 F) and wait until the cut 
cross-section is a full buff, i.e. about the colour of the paler 
types of brown wrapping paper. When the correct colour has been 
reached, remove the tray from the oven, allow to cool and store the 
roast grain in an air-tight screw-top jar (large kilner jars are 
ideal). If used soon after production, the flavour imparted by home-
roasted grain is superior to bought grain.


The roasting times given above are intended only as a guide to 
producing the wanted roast grain Practical tests on the oven 
available will enable home-brewers to adjust the time and 
temperature to produce the colour needed.


Crystal malt, which is usually available, has about the same colour 
potential as brown malt but a more caramel-like flavour.


<end>


The following has not made it into the the appendix yet but .... 
For those who are interested in retaining diastatic activity, subsequent
(informed) experiments have shown that a longer time drying the grain at
a lower temperature helps protect the enzymes. The following will produce
a diastatic Pale Amber.


Set the oven at 70-75 C (160-170 F) and put in the tray of grain (the grain
bed can be a little deeper - up to 1.5 inches, say) and leave for 2 hours
to dry out the grain. Raise the temperature to 88-94 C (190-200 F) for 
30 mins then to 110-115 C (230-240 F) for a further 30 mins. Check the 
colour as above. If insufficient colour, then check at 15 min intervals.
If after 1 hour at this temperature, colour has not been achieved, raise
to 120-125 C (250-260 F) and continue to check at 15 min intervals. The
resultant Pale Amber should be able to mash itself.


For Amber malt, after the grain has spent 1 hour at 110-115 C (230-240 F)
raise the temperature to 127-132 C (260-270 F) and check colour every
15 mins.


*** And note: these diastatic darker grains will be more acidic than normal 
pale malt and if large proportions are used in a mash you might have to
make an allowance in you water treatment. 


I hope that helps. Good mashing.

Hope this isn't a FAQ--
Most hydrometers are accurate at 60 deg F. Papazaion mentions this, but does
not note how to correct for temperature. Does the SG shift upward with 
higher temperatures, or downwards? Does anyone have a formula for
conversion based on temperature, or at least deviation from base temp?


Thanks--our "what's left in the cabinet" brown ale is bubbling nicely.


PS--Without a blowoff tube in the primary, what's a safe and effective

Or is it better to just endure the fusels until we get a blowoff?

Just a quickie!  Anyone out there know of any brewpubs in Cleveland, OH.  I'm
going to a wedding in August, and I am looking for creative ways to fill a
small amount of spare time (yes, we already thought of catching a ball game).

Subject: Re: Cleaning carboys


I use a 7 gal carboy for my primary and I get all that "primary gunk"
out with 1 to 2 Tbs of B-Brite in the carboy with 7 gal of hot water.
The gunk is quickly dissolved - usually in a few minutes, a bit longer
for stubborn stains.  It is quite effective.  I never use my
carboy brush anymore.


In fact, this is about the only time I use B-Brite.  I sanitize with
Clorox.


BTW, my wife used to make a paste with Cascade (the dishwashing
detergent, not the hops) for stains on the counters or stovetop that
could not be scrubbed out.  Now she uses B-Brite.

Subject: yeast propagation






I am aware that some microbreweries use cylindroconical vessels to
propagate their yeasts.  I have seen one only once and that was 
through plate glass.  I was wondering how the yeast was propagated.
I have an idea but the question of autolysis comes directly to mind.
Will someone who knows please tell me?  What other ways can a
brewery propagate their yeast?
TIA,

The question really is -- and perhaps Martin Lodahl is in the best
position to answer this -- whether Anchor really is a "steam" beer or
not.  Is this the same beer that was brewed before the advent of
refrigeration or not?  Judging from the few descriptions I've seen of
actual steam beers, I'd say *not*.  Dave Miller makes the case that
Anchor is really a pale ale, and that in a blind tasting no one could
pick it out of a group of similarly-excellent pale ales.  I snorted when
I first read that, but subsequent tastings have changed my mind.

We're also talking about someone who has a good deal of money to throw
at lawyers if need be.  Of course, in Anchor's case, the mere *threat*
of a lawsuit would be enough to warn off anyone who wanted to fight the
issue.

It isn't innuendo, it's fact.  I had it several years ago from the
distributor.  Actually, the Anchor from SE Asia wasn't very exciting,
and for beer drinkers not much of a loss, but it really was a trademark
issue and Maytag prevailed, probably without any court time.


What's more greatly missed is the truly spectacular ABC Stout the
brewery made, but the fault is their own.  At one time, the beer was
bottle-conditioned, about 1.065 and incredibly creamy but they
apparently felt the need to compete with the locally-brewed Guinness and
changed the recipe -- for the worse.

Me, I just want to find some more Maisel Dampfbier -- which they
considered a sort of modern altbier.  Wonderful stuff, but I haven't
seen any in Oregon in more than 5 years.

Ok, maybe this won't apply to everyone, but we have a 350# tank of liquid
CO2 at work all of the time, and the thought of driving downtown and paying
$15 to get 5# of CO2 irks me.


Any thoughts on whether I could fill my own cylinder from our liquid tank?
The fittings seem trivial, the big tank has a "liquid out" valve that is
just like the "in" port on the cylinder. If it weren't for the thought of
the big KABOOM and three orphans at home I'd just do it myself.


Do I worry too much?

Subject: mixing of ferment




I am a Yeast biochemist and the reason we mix (stir) our fermentations
is to achieve good aeration of the culture.  Yeast are facultative 
anaerobes (they can grow with or without O2).  They simply grow much
better with oxygen (generate many more ATP/glucose in presence of O2).
This is due to the Krebs (citric acid) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.


Just remember, O2 in beer after the ferment takes off is a Bad Thing(tm).
