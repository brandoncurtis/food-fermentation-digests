Hi Doug,
     apologies if it sounded like I was telling you off for
using Saaz for bittering - it wasn't intended that way. Saaz
in the UK are more expensive than other hops and are regarded
as giving good aroma and flavour so I wouldn't spend the extra
if I was simply bittering. If they aren't more expensive where
you are then that's differnet but it still seems a shame to do
it. You mention a figure of 4.6% AAU, my book says 5.5% (maybe
different units) but that is still not very high. There are
many others including "high-bittering" hops with percentages
of 9%-12%. Hops are generally categorised as aroma, general
purpose, bittering or high-bittering. Saaz is considered as
an aroma hop. I normally "bitter" with general purpose hops but
for a high bitterness would use bittering or high-bittering
hops for economy and convenience.
Cheers,
     Brian

     Many people have negative views about plastic for brewing
for one reason or another. I have about half a dozen 5 gallon
plastic fermenting bins (one is 3 years old) and 3 5 gallon
plastic pressure barrels, all of which have a permanent beer
smell. I don't notice any problems with using them either from
an infection point of view or tainting of flavour. They work
for me!

Subject: Reusable bungs for Mini Keg


The reusble bung I have has a center piece that is pushed out
when inserting the tap.  So I don't have to remove the bung (exposing the
beer to air), is there a problem if I push the center piece
(hard rubber/plastic) into the keg when I insert the tap.  Or will it leave a
rubber/plastic taste in my beer.  I don't expect the beer to last any longer
than a week after being tapped.

    I've spoken to a couple of homebrewers who took the Anchor tour, and
they both said the same thing, Northern Brewer for bittering, Hersbrucker
Hallertau for the late additions. No mention of Cascades.


>Now, I'm not one of the folks who reviles Cascades; in fact I like them a

    Ditto, Cascades are just right for American pale ales, I use liberal
amounts when I brew that style.


>They're got a distinctive taste that I really

    Cascades produce a strong citrusy, grapefruit-like flavor and aroma,
which I don't pick up in Anchor steam. The aroma of Anchor steam is quite
floral, seems to me to be very much like Hallertau. That's what I use for
flavor and aroma additions when I brew steam beer.
    Anyone have inside info on this?

I've got a batch of mead that has been aging in the carboy for a few 
months after fermentation was finished.  It's been racked several times, 
so I doubt that there is any more CO2 headspace on top of the mead.  The 
mead is several inches below the carboy neck, and I was wondering if I 
should be concerned about oxidation.  I was planning to let the mead sit 
for another few months (I'm lazy), but will I be in trouble?

In HBD 1490, John Williams <jwilliams`at`hartford.edu> asked
about a deal for buying 5 liter mini-kegs for $55 for 4
with plastic tapper & CO2 cartridge.


This is the Datagraf tapper, right? I understand that these
are okay for short time periods, but that you can't rely
on it to hold pressure in the keg for longer periods, i.e.,
more than a day or two. There is, however, a solid metal
version that is considerably more expensive (I believe 
about $55 just for the tapper) that, according to Gene
Thomas, owner of the Brew Pot in Bowie MD, is more
reliable and can hold pressure longer. (Better do SOMETHING
for the higher price...thought it DOES look pretty ;-)


I've seen the plastic tappers sold by themselves for about
$16. What I'd do is buy that, and then go to my friendly
local beer outlet and buy 5 litre kegs full of beer and
then use the empties. Local stores in my area are selling
various brands, such as Warsteiner, DAB, Grolsch etc. for
anywhere from $11 to $15 per keg. 4 filled kegs will
therefore run you about $50-60, plus the $16 cost of the
tapper, and hey, for a little more $$ you get LOTS of
good beer to drink as a bonus!


Why buy empties?

Subject: What kind of infection?


[Swallowing my pride and clearing my throat]  My name is Dan Wood and
I've made infected homebrew.


My fellow FVHAA homebrewers and I have suffered from identical infections
on all too many occasions.  While we have unaffectionately dubbed this
malady "the funk", I'm hoping that someone can identify it, based on
the clues below.  Knowing our enemy would certainly help morale, and
could assist in eliminating the problem.


The facts:


1. I'd guesstimate that between us, about 2-4 batches per hundred are
affected to varying degrees.  Way too much brew is being used as
drain cleaner.


2. The infections mostly occur in brews made in late spring and summer.


3. We do full boils, good sanitation, etc.  Most of us brew in our
basements.


4. It smells of rotting vegetables (definitely not HSA), and has a slightly
sour taste.  The smell is much worse then the taste.


5. The degree of infection grows exponentially with longer lag times.


6. The infection has been present in both hazy and clear beers.  It does
not create gushers.  There are no visible indications of infection.


7. It seems independent of the yeast: whether dry yeast (usually Yeastlabs
Whitbread) or generous Wyeast starters were used.


8. It has happened regardless of whether the siphon was started by
mouth-to-straw or prefilling the hose with water.


9. It is evident in the primary carboy, not caused by racking, kegging,
or bottling.


10. It has been carried from one batch to another where yeast from the
secondary was reused.  This happened once, I've stopped reusing yeast.


I managed to avoid it on my last batch (fingers crossed) through use of
extreme sanitation procedures: 1+ hour bleach-water soaks, rinsing in
preboiled water, misting all surfaces with vodka, etc.


The option of not brewing in spring/summer is very painful to me.


Many, many thanks in advance for any information and advice.

Subject: Re: 5 liter mini kegs


A couple of folks have asked about the 5 l mini kegs. My experience with
these has been mixed, and mosly poor.


I have had three problems.
        1) the tap doesn't seal well, unless pressed closed by thumb, not easy
with a glass of brew in hand


        2) The CO2 cartridge leaks; I must use a new cartridge if kept more
than a day or so.


        3) It is extremely easy to overcarbonate the cans. I bulged out 4
cans over the last few months, though have had no disasters. This is
certainly avoidable if you use a low (very low) amount of priming sugar,
but once I bulged a can when the yeast was simply slowly attenuative (it
bulged only after 6 months storage). Notably, overcarbonated kegs are
*very* difficult to dispense.


Overall, these cans are an alternative to a kegging system, but not a
perfect one. I recently bought a real keg system; I guess I've ruined any
chance of selling off my mini-keg system to HBD'ers by the above discourse.

Subject: Re: minikeg priming question


J.Strickland asks about priming for bottling and 5l-canning:


I've used the "minikegs" marketed by a mailorder homebrew store in
Pennsylvania with some success (that is after getting a cracked part on
the tap replaced, which they did very promptly, and after playing around
with the "regulator" for the CO2 cartridge. I say _some_ success,
because it appears the cans may not withstand reuse--after cycling
through the four cans, I had a can "deform" on the first reuse. They're
a nice idea, but don't necessarily work so well in reality.).


You say that the priming recommendation is 1/4 cup for 5l-canning and
3/4 cup for bottling? My instructions said to use about _half_ as much
for the 5l cans as for bottling.


I wouldn't worry much about bottling and canning from the same batch.
I'd never want to put an entire batch in the cans anyway--the cans
aren't always very portable for some purposes, it's certainly not a
standard competition size, and it's not very good for stashing away a
sixpack or two for deferred consumption. When I first used one, I
decided to go with an in-between figure for priming and it worked just
fine.


But one reason it works for me is that I would never consider using 3/4
cup per 5 gallon batch. I don't know where that amount ever came from,
but I consider it WAY too much. If I want a HIGHLY carbonated brew I
might use 1/2 cup. Typically, however, I use 1/3 cup or less for
bottling a 5 gallon batch (or the 4.5 gallons or so that remain after
racking) and the carbonation and head are just fine. With that amount of
priming sugar, thre's no problem diverting 5l to a can. Remember, your
instructions were for 1/4 cup anyway. That it might end up a little more
carbonated than the bottled product is of some benefit because it will
be that much longer before you will have to use a CO2 cartridge to
dispense the beer.


BUT WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT, let me throw out the question. Does
anyone actually prime with 3/4 cup for 5 gallons??

Does that recommendation assume (as might have been the case in the
early days of legal homebrewing) that beginners would brew at home to
save money on swill rather than to brew nonswill styles, and the massive
amounts of priming sugar were needed for the more highly carbonated
swillish styles??? Or do lagers (which I don't brew for lack of low
temperature control) require more because the yeast is less active over
the long lagering periods and cooler temperatures??  Any other ideas why??

Let me add my two cents on the Seattle/Vancouver question:


First, if anyone DOES know of anything in Vancouver, let me know because
I haven't found anything great out there. I have yet to get a tour at
Granville Island on two attempts. The first time, they were doing
repairs, but I was graciously offered samples so I could decide what I
might want to pick up at BC Liquor. Fair enough. The second time (on a
separate tripto the city) they were offering tours again, but only once
per day (even though the sign says TOURS (plural) daily and we missed
it. The other person with me on that trip had not had the beer before,
and we were flat out refused a sample from the tap (it's not a bar--the
taps are there for customer samples). There's supposedly another brewery
in the city, but I'm not sure what it is (anyone out there?) The brewpub
that was once apparently in Horseshoe Bay, near the ferry terminal, is
no more, but there is a pub with a few decent ones. Try the Okanagon
Spring brews, particularly the Stout and Porter. Skip the underhopped
pale ale.


If you want to see brewpubs in BC, cross over to Victoria. Spinnakers is
the first. I understand they've changed brewmasters at least once, and
what I had a couple years ago didn't live up to the reviews of a club
member who hadbeen there years before. Still, it's a nice place and the
beer is FAR from lousy. While we were having dinner there, I asked a
waiter if there were any other brewpubs in town. He said we'd probably
find many of the Spinnaker's staff at Swan's when they were done with
work. The beer there was (one that visit anyway) better, but the food
and service were worse. There's another brewpub (or "cottage brewery" as
they're often called) nearby in Saanich. They were planning to bottle,
pending licences, when I stopped in. Don't remember the name, but the
road to it was signed off Route 17 (?)


Hope this helps. I hope also to hear about any decent places in
Vancouver.


Cheers

Subject: ring around the carboy ! (newbe questions)


Subject: More newbe stuff!


Hiya !


Thanks to everyone for the responses to my questions about wort
coolers. It seems this is much more of a concern with all grain
brews, and a bit less significant when extract brewing.


Well.... I hate to say it, but i think i'm worried :)


I made up a new batch about a week ago. It was a fairly expensive
concoction using about 6+ lbs of a bavarian malt extract, and 3.3
lbs of a dark malt. It also has 1 lb of crystal malt, and 1/2 lb
of chocolate, (roasted) malt. I mini mashed the grain, without
much regard for sanitation. Seemed to me that if i was planing on
boiling the thing for 75 mins or so, sanitation at this stage
wasn't too important. I also thought i'd experiment with a 'heavy
hopping' schedule, and added a total of 5 oz (wow!) of a variety
of hops, at various times over the 75 min boil. Northern brewer
for bitterness, etc.... Just as an note, we have a new water
system, so rather than risk using the home well water i picked up
5 gallons of locally bottled spring water.


I used a lager yeast (first time for this type) and a champagne
yeast for a little kick. I've used the champagne yeast before,
it's interesting, and very active. Both were a dried yeast, using
a quart or so of boiled water cooled to 110F as a starter.


A couple of bad things happened.


1 - I attempted to strain the wort when transferring to the
fermenter. I used a boiled cheesecloth bag, and sanitized the
strainer. I don't think i'll ever do this again. The combination
of heavy hopping (pellets!) and the grain really clogged up the
strainer. I was concerned (not worried yet!) about the amount of
'handling' this operation caused. It would be better to just let
the excess hops and fine grain particles not filtered in the mash
straining, settle in the bottom... oh well..


2 - I just bought a new plastic fermenter with a spigot in the
bottom. It seemed like a great idea, but now i'm not too sure. I
used a plastic bag to cover the spigot during primary
fermentation. BUT, when i went to transfer, apparently, a small
amount to wart leaked out into the plastic. The bag was NOT
sanitized... This may have started a nice bacterial growth.


3 - Argh! I'm using a 'S' type fermentation lock. After setting
up the plastic bucket and putting some water in the lock i moved
the bucket on the table a tad and slurp! the water got sucked out
of the lock and into the wort ! Argh! The lock was sanitized, the
glass i used to fill the lock with wasn't.


A calamity of errors ! Then, the dreaded result!


I racked to the secondary fermenter after about 5 days after the
activity seemed reduced. The yeast had settled to the bottom, and
the top of the wort was clear. My secondary fermenter is a 5 gal
glass carboy. I tasted the wort when i moved it. I'm really not
accustom to the heavy hops, and obviously, the yeast suspension
level was very high, so it's difficult for me to tell much at
this point.  My concern is, there was pronounced bitterness, and
a sour (?) taste? With so many new flavors, it's difficult to
trust my novice taste buds!


Now after just a day or so in the carboy, there is a hazy ring

This isn't _exactly_ what Darren Tyson was asking, but I want to correct
the possible misinterpretation that Saint-Louis remains a complete beer
wasteland. I would have agreed completely when I was a student at
Washington University (graduated mid-1980s). Back then, the only nearby
source for decent beer was asmall "gourmet" grocery/liquor store in
Clayton, and even then it meant getting imports.


Since then, of course, the city has Dave Miller's place, Saint-Louis
Brewing, which I've visited a number of times on my two trips to
Saint-Louis this year. There's also J.D. Nick's brewpub in O'Fallon, IL.


On the question of what I would drink if the choices were unpleasant....
No, I don't bother at the ballpark, except our local minor league (VERY
minor league) team, which serves Capital Brewery products in addition to
Budswill. If I'm at County Stadium watching the, yes, Brewers. They
don't have anything I'd enjoy, so why pay over $3 for it? If I'm in a
bar, I might resort to a Sam Adams if it was that desperate a situation.
If I'm in a music club or in a bar after, say, playing hockey, and the
focus is not at all on the drinking itself, maybe I'll have a Berghoff
(if I'm even that lucky) or worse, but I won't drink very much of
it--only enough to be "social." In general, I'd rather have water, or at
the ballgame, I'll take my parking stub to get the two free sodas for
designated drivers.  I don't drink for the buzz, I drink to enjoy flavour.


On getting a life for censors..... The person who complained about the
Doonesbury reference to Rush Limbaugh in a .sig line doesn't seem to
show much tolerance for free speech. I don't think the original writer
was making a deliberate attempt to inject his politics in a beer forum.
The post was within the scope of a beer forum, and the .sig line
probably goes out on all his email. I think that the "Dittoheads" seem
to be just a little too sensitive to the slightest bit of criticism. I
suppose I shouldn't be surprised.

use it as a priming vessel. If you bottle, you could drill a hole near

In HBD 1490, Patrick Casey (pacasey`at`lexmark.com) asked for help
in making a mild ale.


Here's an excellent recipe that comes from Daniel McConnell of
the Ann Arbor Brewers Guild. It appears on page 62 of the new
beer recipe collection "Homebrew Favorites" (Storey Publishing,
1994, ISBN 0-88266-613-4). (Ask me for info on this).


MILD BROWN ALE
==============


This is a low gravity brown ale that has moderately sweet palate,
but plenty of chocolate, nutty flavor. This is my personal favorite
recipe for fast-making, fast-drinking beer. It is not a competition
style beer, due to its low gravity, although I think it would do well 
in the "mild" categories. It is best if it is carbonated at a low
level. The flavor peeks in about 4 weeks, so it should be consumed
very quickly.


Yield: 10 gallons  Total boiling time: 60 minutes  O.G.: 1.034


9 pounds Briess 2-row malt
3/4 pound light crystal malt
1 pound Munich malt
1/2 pound chocolate malt
2 ounces black patent malt
7/8 ounce Northern Brewer hops (10% alpha, boil 60 minutes)
1/2 ounce Cascade hops (5.9% alpha, boil 20 minutes)
1 ounce Hallertauer hops, steep
3/4 ounce oak chips, in boil 20 minutes
Yeast Lab A01 Australian in a pint starter
1 cup, corn sugar for priming


Single infusion mash at 154 F for 45 minutes. Draw off thin mash,
boil, and return to hit strike of 170 F. Add the chocolate and
black malt at mash-out. Sparge. Bring wort to a boil and add Northern
Brewer hops. Boil for 40 minutes and add Cascade and oak chips. Boil
another 20 minutes and turn off heat. Add Hallertauer. Cool, transfer
to primary fermenter, and pitch yeast. Ferment 5 days at 68 F.
Prime with 1 cup corn sugar and bottle.

Im not sure about mechanical stirring, but I do not believe that any rousing
of the primary fermenter is going to oxidize your beer.  Theres just too
much CO2 both being evolved and in solution of the beer.  The key is to 
minimize any splashing of the beer surface, which could stir in O2.  If you
were introducing O2, it would likely show up in the beer.


This is certainly a great type of yeast for cask conditioned ales.  Once you
are satisfied with a recipe and know the terminal gravities, then it is
a game of racking the beer into the cask when the terminal gravity is 
within 1-2 Plato, depending on the amount of carbonation one wants in the
cask.  The fact that it slowley drops the last few degrees is a key reason
that the yeast is ideal for cask ales.  Think about how quick a brewer would
need to be if this technique were used with American ale yeast, 1056.


> Subject: mild ale recipe request


I would suggest the following.


English Ale Malt for OG of 1.055 (13.8P)
1/2 pound of UK crystal
some brown malt, or a combo of more crystal and a touch of chocolate.
Mash at 158 for one hour with no protein rest.


Boil wort 1.5 to 2 hours or longer, depending on amount of carmelization
desired.  


Counterflow chill and dilute to 1.034 ish (8.5P).  Ferment with London
ESB and serve on cask hand pump!.

Nope, never done in the UK.  The color malts are merely a guess. I 
have never brewed this myself.

Animals were, until recently non patentable.  Genetic engineering has
changed all of this.  For a product to be patentable it must be
non obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, and serve a useful
purpose, ie work.  For a yeast strain to be patentable it would have
to have been modified/constructed in some fashion to be different.
This could include the process of genetically altering the DNA so
that the yeast could metabolize non traditional fermentables (can
you say dry beer?).  Now, this is not sufficient in and of itself.
A Patent Examiner (I used to be one in a former life), can take the
"teachings" of another patent, say the one that describes how to
genetically alter DNA to do a similar result as is claimed in the
application, and combine it with another reference to result in 
an "obviousness" rejection under section ??103??   A quite typical
day in the life of an examiner.

Trade secrets are an entire diff bag of hops.  Patents, lose thier 
protection after 17 years, while  trade secrets last the life of
the secret. Thats why Coke has never patented its formula, it would
have lost it around 1910.  Fortuneatly in brewing this kind of
"secret yeast" is nonsense.  There are just not that many strains
that meet the brewers requirements.  And if you did sell brewery
X's yeast, how would anyone be able to prove it beyond a reasonable
doubt?

If you are down to the 7-8 gallon size, you might as well use
one or two BrewCaps, or whatever the upside down Kinney contrap
is.  If you get a price on a 1.5 BBl SS uni, let me know.  I 
am not sure of the value that a uni will provide over a straight
cylander unless you are intent on making lagers.  The price diffs
are just too high for the return.

Andy Walsh (who downloaded one of our catalogs) notes that Wyeast 1968
should be occasionally roused.  This is true, and shouldn't be an
oxidation problem at all, particularly for those using carboys.  There
is, after all, a big blanket of CO2 there and some vigorous agitation of
the carboy for a couple of minutes should help get things going.  I've
been raving about this strain for months now, and consider it one of the
best ale yeasts available.  It seems to go through an interesting
process after a couple of weeks in the bottle, where a signature level
of diacetyl appears.  This is not, I hasten to say, a nasty diacetyl,
but rather a warm, buttery note.  If you've ever had a good serving of
Fuller's ESB, you'll know what I mean.

Subject: Bittering hops


Douglas R. Jones seems to be taking flak for using Saaz at the brew store's 
reccommendation.  Sazz are not generally used for pale ales.  However, for 
any of you out there flaming poor Doug, have you tried it?  Hmm?  I would 
bet that his pale ale is excellent.  What some people fail to recognize is 
that isohumulone is not everything in a hop, and more is not necessarily 
better when it comes to %aa of hops.  As a bittering hop Saaz would not 
impart its usual spiciness, but would impart its wonderful vegetal flavour. 
You see, hops are not simply volatile aroma and flavour components and 
alpha acid.  They also contain a whole lot of subtle plant characteristics, 
many of which remain after a long boil.  If you want that english bitter 
flavour, you have to use tonnes of low-alpha hops, rather than a pinch of 
high alpha hops, in order to get that earthy, vegetal background note.  Try 
it out.  And think about the hops as a whole, not simply as a number on the 
bottom of the pack.  Remember, high alpha hops were devised by big 
breweries who a) want to spend as little as possible on their product and 
b) want as little flavour contribution from the hops as they can manage.

Sounds like Doug Jones really caught hell from you HBDers over his choice of
using Saaz for bittering.  If it had been any other hop in the world, Doug,
you probably wouldn't have gotten so much flack for it.  Its just that Saaz
is highly regarded as a finishing hop for the finest lagers.  Many people
though, including myself, using "finishing" hops for bittering, since they
seem to give a less harsh bitterness compared to high alpha hops, even when
the same IBUs are in the finished beer.  BTW, 4.6% AA is high for Saaz, but
certainly not considered a high alpha hop.  There are some varieties as high
as 15%; I think anything over 9-10% could be considered a high alpha hop.

Subject: Bitterness calculations




Regarding the discussion of hopping formulas, I think they should be used
as a reference.  The formulas, whether it is Rager's or Garetz', are an
attempt to estimate the number of IBUs in a beer.


Since homebrewers have no practical way to measure the actual IBUs
in their beers, we have no way of knowing which formula is the best.
Glenn's research sounds like a good attempt to improve the
situation.


I think most of us use the IBU estimates as a relative scale.  After a few
batches, we know about how bitter a beer with 40 IBUs (estimated) will
be.  Most of us have some kind of calibration in our heads for our tastes
and our equipment of what "40 IBUs" mean.  If you don't have enough
experience yet with IBUs in your beers, Eckhardt's book gives the IBUs
in quite a few commercial beers.


So use Rager's formula or use Mark Garetz', but be consistent and
you should get consistent bitterness.  I noticed a big improvement in
consistency when I switched from using Papazian's HBUs to IBUs.

 Can someone e-mail me the modification for offsetting the temperature on the
 Hunter t'stat? I appear to have lost the HBD where it was last published. I
 have just run across a few on closeout at a local hardware store. TIA.

I have a beerland homebrew kit and I'm trying to order ingredients from 
Beerland and have gotten a busy signal for about a week straight.  If 
anyone knows if they are still in business, or what the deal is, let me 
know.  Thanks
