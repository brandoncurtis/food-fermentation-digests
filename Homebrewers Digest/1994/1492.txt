Exactly what is decoction mashing?  It was my understanding that a
portion of the grist was boiled and then returned to the mash, and this
statement suggests that just the first runnings being boiled and and
returned is the method.  Is there a decoction FAQ? Am I missing
something? If so, please forgive my naivete.

One of my coworkers in our company's Paris office is interested in
homebrewing.  I offered to try to find out about homebrewing in France. 
Specifically, the answers to these questions:


 - Is homebrewing legal in France?  If so, are there many homebrewers?
 - Are homebrewing books available there?  (English is OK.)
 - Where does one get equipment and ingredients?


Thanks in advance for any information.  If you don't think the answers
are of general interest, please e-mail me directly.

Subject: Wyeast 1968 ESB


I tried to post a long ditty on the 1968 yeast but it bounced back, so
here is the short version:  it is HIGHLY flocculant and makes a 
wonderful cask conditioned beer, ready in record time.


I ferment the primary in a 7 gallon carboy and after 2 days of ferment,
I roused the carboy around and got the stuff to settle out even faster.
There is no problem in this because the CO2 has pushed all the oxygen
out of the carboy.  


I made two batches with the 1968:  a OG 1.040 ESB and a OG 1.032 brown 
mild.  Both came out smooth with a nice finish.  This is one fine yeast!

Subject: milky spore/beetles


   The following excerpt was taken without permission from National Gardening
Magazine dated August 1990.


Pest Control
Japanese Beetles / by Lee Reich


The milky way
 It's ironic that the two popular methods of Japanese beetle control 
 -trapping and milky spore disease- are of dubious effectiveness. Yellow 
traps baited with scent or sex attractants are familiar sights in backyards,
and in fact are very efficient in attracting adult beetles. The problem is
that Japanese beetles are good fliers, so the traps draw more beetles into
an area than are captured. The result: plant damage can actually INCREASE!
 Milky spore is a bacterial disease(caused by Bacillus popillae) that kills
the grubs. (skip stuff) 
 Though milky spore infects grubs in the laboratory, ongoing research 
suggests that in the field it may not work well, especially in cold soils,
such as those found in New England. Today's guidelines are based largely on
USDA research of a half century ago. But those scientists inundated large 
areas with spores, and their inoculant was manufactured by a different
method.  (end of excerpt).




 I have found where I live (New England) that this stuff has no affect on 
beetles. I also understand (from our groundskeeper here at work) that the
conditions must be almost perfect for the spore to work anywhere, such as
moist soil, warmer winters, or an abundance of grubs.


 Furthur on in the article he makes a statement that I agree with whole
heartedly, "But remember that plants (and hopefully,you) can tolerate some
damage, so there's no need to spray at the first sign of attack."
 Large portions of my hop leaves are missing or full of bullet holes.
Will this effect my yield? I doubt it. I'll let them have some leaves if
they leave me some flowers.
 The gentleman who had had his vines completely stripped has a battle on
his hands and should try everything (except companion planting ie. marigolds
etc. these things don't work IMHO).
 And finally, I've found that these beetles have a much greater preference 
for my grapevines and roses than for my hops. Maybe some of you people
could throw in a vine or bush somewhere and let the bugs have their way with
them.

Subject: Hops and etymology - a REALLY useless post 8~)




        Given the recent discussion about where the word 'hops' comes from, 
I pulled my American Heritage Dictionary off the shelf, ignored the smell of
mildew and checked on our favorite flower.


        Hop (weird characters) - Any of several twining vines of the genus
                Humulus; especially H. lupulus, having lobed leaves and green,
                conelike flowers.  Plural - the dried, ripe flowers of this 
                plant, containing a bitter, aromatic oil and used in brewing
                beer [Middle English hoppe, from Middle Dutch. see 'skeup-'
                in Appendix*]


        This appendix is compilation of Indo-European root words.  So...


        skeup-: Cluster, tuft, hair of the head. 1) Germanic 'skauf-',
                Old English 'sceaf-' bundle, sheaf. 2) Germanic 'skuft-',
                Old Norse 'skoft' hair of the head, scruff 3) Germanic
                'hupp' Middle Dutch 'hoppe' the hop plant (having tuftlike
                inflorescence).


        The reference the dictionary gives for this interpretation of the
Indo-European root is Julius Pokorny's 'Indogermanisches Etymologisches
Worterbuch' published in Bern, 1959.


        I make no claims as to the accuracy of the dictionary or the 
interpretations of (possibly) long-deceased authorities. But it makes sense
to me.  After all, hops do go to your head 8~).

Subject: The beginners guide to advanced and all-grain brewing


The beginners guide to advanced and all-grain brewing
By Richard B. Webb, the Brews Brother's 1993 Homebrewer of the year


The purpose of this guide is to give you the brewer all the information 
you need to 
strike off into unknown territory, and to help you become the ultimate 
brewing god. In it, I 
will try to communicate my brewing philosophy and techniques. In short, 
I will teach you the summation of everything I know about brewing and life!


Zymurgy (pronounced Zi-mer-gee, with the i pronounced like 'eye') 
is the study of 
living, organic chemistry. It seeks to use and manipulate chemical 
compounds (such as 
salts and sugars), living organisms (yeast), and a universal solvent 
(water!) to create a 
pleasant tasting, psychoactive substance called alcohol. 
Alcohol is a drug, similar to many 
other drugs that every culture known to man has used to expand the 
consciousness, 
commune with the gods, or just to catch a buzz. Alcohol in general, 
and beer in 
particular, may have been the driving force behind the eventual civilizing 
of the beast, 
man. After all, without fermentables, there is no alcohol, and without 
cultivation, and 
therefore civilization, there are precious few fermentables. Some 
societies come by their 
alcohol requirements the hard way, doing all kinds of mean, nasty, 
stupid things to make 
it. In modern times, and with modern methods, you and I can drink 
like kings, if not like gods.


The word alcohol describes a range of molecules, formed from carbon, 
oxygen, and 
hydrogen atoms. These molecules are formed by the metabolization of 
certain sugars by 
living organisms, called yeast, leaving roughly equal 
parts alcohol and carbon dioxide as 
a by-product. We use this special ability of the yeast to make various 
types of beverages which include alcohol.


Equipment


1.     All grain brewing: 
What new equipment do I need?


1.1.     Boiling pots


The process for all grain brewing is actually pretty easy. If you 
are an extract brewer 
now, you probably have the beginnings of an equipment pile already. 
An extract brewer 
can get away with a three or four gallon boiling container, but this 
is just a spittoon to 
serious all grain brewers. The first thing that you need for all grain 
brewing is a larger 
boiler. All grain brewing typically produces a gallon of water for 
every three or four 
pounds of grain, and it doesn't take much grain before the volumes 
of water begin to 
strain that old coffee cup of a boiler. My first bit of advice is 
to invest in a large boiler, 
the bigger the better, with a minimum of seven gallons is best. You 
may find yourself 
outgrowing even that size of boiler as your brewing plans become more 
ambitious, so 
consider getting an even bigger pot to start with.


Stainless steel pots are ideal for brewing, but they can be a bit 
pricy. My first big 
boiler was an aluminum stock pot, coming to the scale at around eight 
gallons, but I 
wasn't very happy with it. The aluminum scratched easily, and stained 
too readily. 
Cleaning it up took up layers off the bottom, and fears of excessive 
intake of molecular 
aluminum led to the eventual discarding of the pot. If you do use 
aluminum, do not use it 
to store wort for very long. The acidity of wort often dissolves the 
aluminum, leading to discoloration or worse.


An alternative to stainless steel is enameled steel. This is made 
by heating a glaze 
onto the surface of a cheaper type of steel kettle. This can work 
for you, but remember 
that any chip in the enamel that exposes the underlying steel will 
allow that steel to begin 
rusting. My advice? Find a used stainless steel mega-pot and use it 
until you feel the need to upgrade.


1.2.    Cooling systems


Your old small boiler may have fit just fine in a sink filled with 
cold water and ice for 
cooling the wort after boiling, but your bigger boiler will never 
fit. If you don't have one 
already, invest in a wort chiller/heat exchanger of some sort, or 
better yet, learn to make 
your own. They are frightfully easy to make, and if you can get other 
people interested, 
you can sell wort chillers that you've made to them. I prefer the 
copper coil immersion 
wort chillers myself. As the hot wort is cooled rapidly, proteinaceous 
matter (also called 
floating junk) condenses and precipitates out of solution. An immersion 
type chiller 
allows this stuff to settle out to the bottom of the boiling pot before 
it is transferred to 
the fermentation containers. If you get really creative, you can build 
a couple of wort 
chillers and chain them together, with the first chiller immersed 
in a bath of ice water, 
pre-cooling the water before it begins to chill your hot wort.


Immersion chillers are best kept clean prior to use, and are sterilized 
by placing into 
the wort while it is still hot. If there is any water inside the chiller, 
especially if there are 
also air bubbles inside, the heat from the kettle will force the water 
out of the chiller. Watch your shoes!


Another type of chiller is called a counter-flow chiller. This tube 
inside a tube 
system allows the draining of hot wort through a copper tube whose 
outside is being 
cooled by water. The picture formed is the opposite of the immersion 
chiller where the 
wort is on the outside of the tube, with coolant water flowing through 
the tubing. The 
counter-flow chiller has the advantage of siphoning the wort from 
the boiling container 
into a fermenter at the same time as it is being cooled, saving a 
step of transfer later on. 
This idea is seductive, especially if you have no better way to transfer 
cool wort to the fermenters in the first place.


The use and care of the counter-flow chiller is a little more involved 
than the 
immersion chiller. Because the counter-flow chiller is much more efficient 
at cooling 
the wort flowing through it, the proteinaceous matter that precipitates 
out of solution 
tends to stick to the sides of the tube. Care must be taken to completely 
flush this matter 
out of the tube prior to the next use. Failure to do so will ensure 
that your next batch of 
wort will be contaminated by nasty beasties growing in your chiller 
between batches. 
Proper cleaning of the chiller involves back flushing the tube with 
a series of nasty 
chemical baths which themselves leave residue which may taint future 
batches!


I guess you can tell which kind of chiller system I prefer. The system 
you pick depends 
on what your priorities are. You can choose high efficiency, balanced 
against the need for 
intensive cleaning protocol, or you can accept a lower efficiency, 
easier cleaning system. 
In either case, pick a system that works for you and your brewing 
system.

Subject: sanitation/off flavors/aging


Hi everyone!


  A friend and I are having a small disagreement about the necessity of
strict sanitation practices. He doesn't get the HBD so I am trying to
explain some of the information to him. I have even gone as far as making
copies of posts and giving them to him. He is unswayed. He isn't nearly as
tedious/anal about it (sanitation) as I am and he has never had an
infected batch!  So I can't really tell him he is doing something wrong.


My question is this: what types of off flavors are caused by lack of 
sanitation, HSA, or general poor handling of beer?


   -and-


Will some of these or all of these flavors mellow or disappear over time?
also does hop flavor/aroma get stonger or softer over time?


My friends ages his beer about 3 or 4 months in his kegs before he drinks
it.  So I am thinking that possibly the reason he has to age it this long
before it tastes good is because he doesn't treat the beer well and it
takes time for the strange flavors to disappear.  Could this be the case?
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The keg FAQ says to age for at least two weeks for a normal (ale) type
beer.  Why would he need to age his so long before it is any good?   


any posts to the HBD or private are much appreciated!

Subject: Re: BruProbe/JB Distributing


Spencer Thomas had some questions about my BruProbe post so I figured he
is not the only one.  Here is his question and my reply:
> 
> It's not clear from your post (nor, exactly, from the article), but
> does one still have to buy all the parts (except the probe) for the
> circuit, and assemble it?  
> 
   The BruProbe consists of the brass wand with the temperature sensor,
   a 2 kohm resistor (to prevent ringing), a cable that goes from the
   end of the BruProbe to the display circuitry, and a 3-pin, male DIN
   connector.  J.B. Distributing also provides a mating connector with
   the wand so you can easily connect it to your circuitry.  BTW, the
   article incorrectly states that the sensor is the LM34D; it is the
   LM34C which the author seems to recommend since it has an expanded
   temperature range.  The wand is $20.


   J.B. Distributing also sells a PC board for making a circuit that
   will display the temperature.  It is a bare PC board with
   instructions for putting it together and a parts list for ordering 
   the parts from Digi-Key.  The circuit is made up of a voltmeter chip
   an LCD display and some support components.  When I learned that the
   output of the BruProbe was 10 mV/deg F, I decided to just buy a
   digital multimeter instead (I can put it to other good uses).


   Even though I only bought the BruProbe, J.B. Distributing gave me all
   the instructions to help me power the probe properly and get the
   connections right.


   I hope this clears up any confusion.

Subject:  Mayville, WI brewers?




      I am asking this for my good friend and brewing buddy who is quite 
computer challenged (does not even own one) but is looking for any brewers in 
the Mayville, WI area.  He, like me, is new to brewing and looking for a local 
"big brother" to admire (spelled p-e-s-t-e-r) and look up to.   I promised him 
I would ask.  So it is done!


     Secondly, it seems as if, almost on a daily basis, I see another state 
listed where brewing is illegal.  I just saw that CA forbids such activity.  To 
date I count Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, California (?) and this fine state I 
live in: Alabama.  Are there others?  Thanks for all of the help I have 
received from this digest.

Thanks Folks!


Occasionally, I see requests for pub info here in the Digest, and I have
wondered who really responds to those; Now I know.  Wow, did I get a lot of
enthusiastic reponses to my query.  BTW, it seems that Great Lakes Brewing Co.
is the clear winner (every single responder recommended it highly!)


Also, thanks for the Kriek tips.  I'll be trying them out, although it may be
Christmas before I can sample it.


Several digests ago a reader asked about brewing software.  I responded by
recommending Suds, but only as a record keeping program.  Well, it seems I
need to eat my words.  I have been evaluating version 3.0a of the program, and
I am happy to say that it has a powerful new recipe formulator.  Also, if you
call Homebrew U. BBS, you can get The Cat's Meow in Suds format.  THIS IS A
MAJOR UPGRADE!.  It's a pleasure to use (although, there are a few minor
bugs.), and it's only $20.  My apologies to you Suds users out there!


BTW, why did Zymurgy ignore Suds in their Software review last spring?????
Anyway, thanks for all the kind inputs, and keep up the great work!

Subject: outdoor brewer to be


Help!  I've been banished from my kitchen, so it is time to move the
operation outside.  Therefore, I am in need of some advice on propane beer
cookers.  Where's the best place to find a reasonably priced,efficient, and
sturdy unit?  While searching back issues of the HBD I found a reference to
Metal Fusion, manufacturer of King Cookers, but there was no phone
number/address.  If this is a worthwhile source I'd appreciate the info. On a
more health/science oriented note, does anyone know of any harmful effects
associated with the intense aromas that are prevelant while boiling hops and
wort indoors? The KEEPER of my kitchen claims nausea as a byproduct, hence my
banishment.  TIA for replies.  Todd Little

Yes, bisulfite will "neutralize" chlorine since chlorine is an oxidizing
agent and bisulfite is a reducing agent.  The chemical reaction is:


   Cl2  +  Na2SO3  +  H2O  ---->  2 HCl  +  Na2SO4


Sodium bisulfite could be used to treat buckets impregnated with chlorine
though from a physical standpoint it would probably take as long to neutralize
the chlorine as it took to impregnate.  According to the above equation, the
reaction of chlorine with bisulfite creates hydrochloric acid so the solution
would become more acidic.  This would degrade the bisulfite by allowing it
to be lost as sulfur dioxide:


   2 HCl  +  Na2SO3  ---->  2 NaCl  +  SO2(g)  +  H2O

Subject: yeast info


I have had many requests from people to send them the Compuserve yeast 
information I referred to in a previous posting. I personally pay for my 
Internet access, and even worse, I pay per byte of data I send and receive over 
the net. This multiplies if I send the same data to multiple recipients. So, 
sorry folks, to all those who requested the yeast info, but I won't send it to 
you.
I would post it to the HBD, but it is very large, and much of the data is 
advertising material for Advanced Brewers Scientific. I am also uncertain about 
the legalities of chopping it up and sending the relevant data to the HBD.
Interested parties without Compuserve access should contact Advanced Brewers 
Scientific via email at gummitch`at`teleport.com. I am sure they would be happy to 
post their catalogue to you. This catalogue has all the yeast info referred to, 
along with recommended strains for different styles, and a stack of yeast 
culturing gear. (I have nothing to do with this company etc.)

Subject: Wicked yeasties


I just finished a six of Pete's Wicked Lager and, while rinsing the
bottles for recycling (twistoffs!), I noticed a trace of yeast on the
bottom.  Has anyone tried reculturing this stuff?  Is it THE yeast or
a strain used only for krausening?  I wonder the same about the trace of
yeast in my Celis White bottles--could I possible use it to get that
wonderful clove-ness?

Subject: Hopping steam beers


Dear Friends, my contribution to the current activity on steam beers,
especially the way they are hopped.  Jim DiPalma asks about "inside info";
don't have any except what's in MJ's Beer Companion, which mentions three
additions of Northern Brewer.  I brewed a steam a while back using the
American hops I had on hand; the schedule was 17 g 11.3 Chinook 60 min, 20
g 6.4 Clusters 40 min, and 14 gr 5.4 Cascades 10 min (all pellets, for a
23 litre batch).  This gives IBUs in the neighborhood of 40, which is
about right I reckon.  This produced a pretty decent beer (used Wyeast
2112 BTW), but it was not anything like Anchor, mostly because of the hops
(could have used a little more body but that's another story), definitely
upholding Dick Dunn's comment about Cascades in the finish not being on
target.  My most recent batch (partial mash this time, first was extract +
spec.  grn) is another steam (23 litres, 3 kg pale malt, 250 gr 80L
crystal, single infusion, plus 1.25 kg extract syrup, Wyeast 2112) but
this time I stuck to the Ungloved One's info, and did three additions of
6.8% N. Brewer pellets at 60, 10, and 2 minutes (IBUs also around 40). 
The difference is phenomenal, and not only do I think this will end up as
the best beer I have made to date, but it is actually going to taste
something like a beer that people have heard of <grin>. 


So based on this exhaustive one-data-point study, I'd say if you want
steam, go for the three additions of N Brewer and forget the other
suggestions.  In particular, there was a recipe a couple digests ago
(don't have the details handy) that had British hops and either 1028 or
1098 yeast--no chance for that one IMHO.


Finally, one unrelated comment: awhile back someone suggested that Jeff
Renner thinks he is his wife.  This is obviously absurd.  He thinks he is
his wife's *computer*.


Cheers, Dave in Sydney
