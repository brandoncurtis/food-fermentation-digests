Does anyone use 3/4 cup for priming?  Yes, I do!  For 5 imperial gal (6US) 
(yield=60bottles), I normally use between 3/4 and 1 cup dextrose for pale ales. 
This gives about .003 increase in gravity.  At this level I still find it takes 
a long time (4 weeks or more) in the bottle to achieve an appropriate level of 
carbonation.  It is definately not overcarbonated!  Could this be due to to the 
fact that I generally leave the batch in the secondary for several months (2 
kids at home...), which probably means there's not much yeast left by the time 
its bottled?

 Based on the information you provided I have a feeling you may have
run into a mold problem. You stated most of you brew in the basement
and the problem occurrs in the spring and summer. If you basement is
like most others, then it would tend to get damp and subsequently
moldy in the spring and summer. My basement tends to be dryer in the
fall and winter - heating also helping this to be true. Try moving
your operation from the basement.


 I had one bad batch of beer out of the 15 to 20 batches I brewed.
It was my second and it happened because I topped of the secondary
fermenter by pouring tap water into it - Dumb ! Aeration plus un-sanitized
water caused this. But I refused to toss it. Slightly sour, I drank it
anyway. One of my brewing buddies, who likes to bust em, threw it over
his shoulder at a competition. That was the only one he ever threw
though ! I've kicked his but every time since. So don't despair.

Subject: Bad Advice in Zymurgy


Greetings,


I just finished going through the latest Zymurgy, and for those of you
who don't subscribe, also included in the summer issue was a sheet of
information called "The Beer Basics."  I use the word information
lightly, since there are a number of things that are *not* recommended,
unless you enjoy stuck fermentations and/or oxidized and contaminated
beer.  The problems I see have nothing to do with learning advanced
brewing techniques, but are things that even the beginning homebrewer
should be aware of.  Below will be a list, follow by my comments.


A. Ingredients


   Zymurgy: "Dehydrated yeast is sold in small paper packages."    


   me:  If your yeast is in paper packages, don't use it because paper is
   permeable to air.  Your dried yeast should be in foil pouches and stored
   in the refrigerator until use.


   Z: "Tap or bottled water is fine"


   me: "Don't use bottled mineral waters, and any water added to your wort
   after boiling should be boiled separately and chilled.


B.  Equipment


   Z: "Don't use aluminum (brewkettles)."


   me: This statement is a little strong.  There is no conclusive link
   between aluminum and alzheimers, but the acidity of the wort will
   affect the finish.  I'd rather see someone brew in an aluminun pot
   than not brew at all.


C.  What to Do


1.  Sanitizing:


   Z: "Fill your (sanitized) fermenter with 3 gallons of fresh cold water
   and cover (before adding the boiled wort).


   me: Ordinary tap water has bacteria and other microorganisms.  Preboil
   for at least 15 minutes, and chill before using.


2.  Cooling and pitching:


   Z: "Carefully pour all the (hot boiled) wort into your water-filled
   fermenter."


   me: This invites oxidation, ala Papazian's method of using a strainer.
   Chill the wort as much as possible before transferring, either by
   using a chiller or adding cold water to your brewkettle before the
   transfer.


   Z: "When the wort has cooled to near room temperature, open the lid
   and sprinkle two packets of yeast over the wort.  Work quickly so that
   the wort is exposed to air as breifly as possible.  There is no need
   to stir."


   me:  This is incredibly bad advice, as most brewers here know.  Nowhere
   in this little blurb was wort aeration discussed!  Once the wort has
   cooled, it's *very, very* important to aerate your wort by stirring,
   splashing, shaking, etc.  Do whatever it takes.  Dry yeast should not
   be sprinkled on the wort, but should be gently rehydrated by adding to
   a cup of water that has been boiled and cooled to 90 to 100F.  This
   can be done while the wort is boiling, so it requires no additional
   time.  Also, the yeast distribution is important to a good fermentation,
   so at least stir in into the wort with a sanitized spoon.  Following
   the advice here is a good way to get a stuck fermentation, since the
   yeast needs lots of dissolved oxygen initially to create enzymes and
   build up energy reserves during the lag phase.


I apologize for the length, but I thought it was important to clarify
some of these suggestions.

<<<<<< Attached TEXT item follows >>>>>>
Text item: Text_1
     Hi Folks,
     
     Well, I've completed my acquisition of equipment for all-grain 
     brewing.  The temperature in my basement will (I hope) be down to ale 
     fermenting temperatures by the end of September.  I intend to begin 
     all-grain brewing with several 'practice' batches of Pale Ale.  If I 
     can get the technique down with this style, I hope to use it as a 
     knowledge base for more brewing adventurous beers.
     
     I would like to brew something similar to Geary's, Harpoon, or Sam 
     (TM) Adams (TM) Stock (TM) Ale (TM). I hope to revise and refine my 
     procedures by repeated attempts at the same recipe until defects are 
     minimized and the outcome is predictable.
     
     Question: Is there a recipe you have used that yields a beer similar 
     to the ones mentioned above?
     
     Please e-mail responses.
     
     TIA
     
     Mark

          Greetings!
               Having just recently completed my first all-grain
          batch, a whole new crop of questions have come up.
               I am curious what the differences in extraction rates
          would be between a batch using x pounds of a 6-row malt, and
          one using x pounds of 2-row malt of the same type.
               My first effort used 7 lbs. of pale 6-row Briess malt,
          and 1 oz. (total) of Cascade pellets.  I got an extraction
          on the order of 20-22 pts, using a two step infusion mash.
          I mashed in a converted keg w/ a slotted copper manifold.  I
          kept things simple to more easily spot any gross errors in
          technique, in case any of you were wondering.
               I would appreciate any feedback, and I'd like to thank
          the digest for its wealth of info., it enabled me to have a
          reasonably successful first effort.

Subject: boiling over


Here's a thread I've never seen kicked around.  Just before my wort reaches
a boil it tries to foam over the top.  With vigorous stirring I can bring
the foam down.  Once it reaches a rolling boil everything is fine, although
sometimes adding more hops will cause the situation to repeat.  Now, this
always seems to happen when I'm not staring directly into the pot.  Surely
some brewers out there have come up with a good solution to this.

Yes, whiskey barrels are fine, especially if you are going tp make port
or sowe other form of fortified wine.  Whiskey barrels by definition
are charred and this is not necessary a good thing for wine especially
if you intend to make a white.


The problem with a used barrel is you do not know what is inside and
you don't know how it was maintained.  Whiskey barrels are charred and
the barrel itself contains whiskey - that is OK.  But how long has the
barrel been empty?  In what conditions has it been stored?  55 gallons
translates into approximately 759 lbs of grapes assuming an additional
compensating volume of 15 % :


        55 x 1.15 = 63.25
        63.25 x 12 lbs/gal. = 759 lbs.
That's alot of bad wine (vinegar) if there is a mold in that used barrel.
My first recommendation is, unless you fully understand the risks of
making wine or beer with cooperage - stay away from it.


You mention you are in New Jersey and from the email address in the
military.  You may be near some local wineries (Cream Ridge if you
are near Fort Dix) which may be looking to get rid of some non-charred
oak barrels.  


As for care, you cannot disassemble a barrel.  Once taken apart, a barrel
is useless for containing a liquid.  So DO NOT DISASSEMBLE A BARREL!
If you must, you may manage to get one of the heads off but you must
keep the head wet while it is off and assemble it back in exactly the 
same position in order for the barrel to remain "liquid" tight.


Basic care:
- -----------
If the barrel is new, sap clear or parrafin, place several coats of
raw (not boiled) linseed oil on its out side.  I say at least 2 or 3.
This will help to seal the wood reducing the amount of evaporation
(the wood of the barrel will absorb liquid and the liquid will evaporate
through the outside of the barrel and so on....).  Fill the barrel with
water.  It may leak at first.  Eventually (it better) it will stop
leaking as the wood expands.  Once the barrel is tight, you may treat
the water in the barrel with citric acid blend or potassium metabisulfite
or campden tablets.  Consult you wine books (I recommend "Grapes Into
Wine" by Phillip Wagner).  Before you place the new wine into the barrel
empty the water and treat with a sulfur strip or two.


For a used barrel, the same care above applies.  However you may want
take the head off and scrub with soda ash (washing soda) as Jim Grady
recommends.  Tighten the outside bands, fill up the barrel with water
and let it tighten - no leaks.  Drain the water, dry the outside,
tighten the bands, and cover the outside of the barrel with several
coats of RAW linseed oil.  Let dry and refill with treated water until
the new wine is ready to go in.


What all this is leading up to is what to do with the barrel when there
is no wine in it????  When "not in use" the barrel must remained filled
with treated water which is replaced every 3 months.  When changing
water during the summer, take advantage of the weather to reapply
linseed oil.  Keep the barrel "topped at all times.  Also being a
resident of New Jersey, I find the outside of my barrel to get covered
in mold.  A strong chlorine bleach and water solution applied to the
outside takes care of that problem.

Although prone to leaks, smaller barrels are available in 2 and 30 gallon
sizes.  If you are near Pennsylvania, try giving Ambler Wood Stove and
Beer Supply (yes I wrote this correctly).  They are in Ambler, PA.
I don't have the number off hand.  Another approach is to find a local
winery and find out from where they get their barrels.


Sorry for rambling on - it's good to have a wine maker on line.  Good
luck!

I love the 1968 yeast, and I love the idea of the hand pump, but I think I
would ferment it at the higher gravity for the extra esters that is likely
to produce.  Then I would dilute it with preboiled water.  This, I think,
would give a more interesting low gravity ale.  Actually, this would make
a great side-by-side experiment.  Hmmm.

Yes, they  bottle kegged, forced carbonated beer.  Exactly their
purpose and nothing else.  Don't know of any literature on them other
than how to use them which is the pamphlet generally packed with one
you buy.  I have made my own and have visions of marketing it some
day.  Big difference with mine is that I use ball valves instead of
needle valves and put it on a stand.  It is really difficult to hold a
filler down into a bottle against 30 psi for a case of bottles.  The
stand and little platform for the bottle allow you to use a 1 foot
long lever to squeeze the bottle between filler and platform making
filling super easy.


Any questions about CP filling, ask away, I consider myself somewhat
of an expert in the field.

John:


A pressure cooker is not an absolute requirement for plate preparation but
is highly recommended if the plates are to be stored for any length of
time. If you boil, then do it for at least 20 minutes. It would also be
prudent to streak out a given yeast on 2-3 plates in case one shows up
contaminated down the road. If you want to do longterm storage on slants
(something I did not cover in my article) then a pressure cooker for
sterilization is, in my opinion, a good investment. The way I see it, a
pressure cooker is not that expensive an investment when one considers how
much has already been spent on brewing equipment and how much you spend
per batch. Good luck and happy yeast farming.

Before I even read today's hbd I had a friendly advisory on the length
of the header and on multiple posts.


1) This damn ibmmail-er generates the header and I can't do much about
it.


2) But these were particularly long because of my oversight. Bear with
me for the explanation. IBMMAIL is not "directly" on the net. Therefore,
I have to either a) insert a few lines of code, including the internet
address to make it forward to the net or b) once I've sent something to
that address, use an ibmmail generated code that identifies the user.
Obviously b) is more convenient. On my last few intended posts I used
the id that appears when I _receive_ hbd (I1002526) and did not get a
confirmation message. A few days later, I figured out that the problem
is that the id for POSTING is I1010141. I forwarded the previous posts
to the correct address, and not only did they all show up the same day,
but they picked up an additional header and .sig.


This has to happen only once for me to know the correct id for posting.

Subject: 125 year old ale yeast


A few months ago will watching the discovery channel a program called
beyond 2000 (originating from austrailia) did a segment they called "back
to the future". The story went that a barge had been discovered, which had
sunk (I don't remember the ecxact date) approx.125 yrs ago in the Thames
river in London. While doing a salvage or excavation, to unbroken bottles
where brought up. When opened at a lab they discovered that they were beer.
Or as they said Porter. The beer was bad, but they were able to isolate
yeast and "nurture it back to health. <Break to scene of narrator having a
pint in an english brew pub>. The narrator held up a bottle and I'm almost
sure it said "Flag Porter".


So what temp. is the sludge on the bottom of the Thames? Yeast is
apparently much hardier than is now believed.
Has anyone else seen this show? Has anyone heard of this beer or story
before now? Can you tell me (if you know) where I could research this
further? I'd love to try a Porter (or brew one) with this strain.


What comes after pico? (Homebrews must fit in somewere).

In HBD #1490, Phil Miller asks about getting the old beer smell out of his 
plastic fermenter. My suggestion is SUNLIGHT. After each batch, I clean the 
bucket well, then leave it out in the bright sun for a day. It seems to get 
that smell right out of there.  Obviously, you must still sanitize the bucket 
before reusing it. Good Luck!

> I recieved a postcard from the AHA regarding Papazian's new book ...


This past weekend, I picked up Charlie Papazian's new book, _The Home Brewer's
Companion_.  Its cover price is $11, and I found it quite by accident sitting,
next to Dr. Fix's _Principles of Brewing Science_ at the local Olsson's Books
and Records store.  I was also at my local homebrew store (Brew Masters in
Rockville, MD) this weekend, and they didn't have copies yet, although I'm 
sure they soon will.


I'm most of the way through it now (page 357).  Including the appendices and
index, the book is some 445 pages.  I'll try to give a capsule review in the
next paragraph or so, but first I should explain that I'm a new (3 batches)
extract brewer.  I got started with Papazian's _The New Complete Joy of Home
Brewing_, and equipment and ingredient kits from Brew Masters.  


_The Home Brewer's Companion_ seems to me like a very well-done follow-up to
_The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing_.  I should note that it refers back to
TNCJHB frequently - in a lot of ways, THBC picks up where TNCJHB left off - and
I don't think THBC would be as useful to me if I didn't have TNCJHB available
to build on and refer back to.


The first 6 chapters (about the first 100 pages) were the most useful to me.
The first of these covers 'simple improvements', while the rest go into
considerable detail about each of the ingredients used to make beer.  This is
followed by chapters on the equipment and process of making beer.  Although I
found them interesting, most of the information seemed more relevant for
all-grain brewers than to me as an extract brewer.  When and if I take the
all-grain plunge, I will certainly want re-read the relevant sections of both
books.


There are, of course, recipies - extract, mash-extract, and all-grain - for
many different brews.  There are also a beer style guidlines, and a chapter
on beer evaluation (which, along with some of the appendices, I haven't read
yet).


All in all, I feel that it was $11 well spent.  I don't think I'd want to pay
$14 for the privledge of waiting three or four weeks for it to arrive, though.
Check your favorite bookstore or homebrew shop - it should already be on the
shelves.

Subject: Pike Place Brewery's unpopular decision/1/2 bbl keg results/RE: 




Pike Place::::
A sad piece of information for those homebrewers who thought that Pike Place 
Brewery administration was on their side: recently I went to the brewery to 
get my usual yeast sample to homewbrew with. With me was my sanitized 
container, and a bottle of 1.5 year old mead to give to the brewery employee 
who helped me out. This is/was a common practice for the brewery. I was 
informed that the management/administration of the brewery had enacted a 
policy of no longer supplying people with yeast. This was a sad day for me 
as Pike Place has always been friendly to homebrewers, hell they operate a 
HB shop not 1 block from the brewery. Fal Allen, and the other brewery 
employees have been nothing but helpful and kind to me. I find this to be a 
bad piece of business decision making by the people upstairs. If Charles 
Finkel and the other business partners in Merchant Du Vin/Pike Place Brewery 
were to know about the fact that their decision was an unpopular one, that 
homebrewers comprise a large share of their market, they might possibly 
change their policy. This really bums me out. Pike Place/Merchant Du Vin's 
business office can be reached at (206) 322-5022. call them and let them 
know what you think about this. I know I have..


1/2 BBL kegging results.
This last saturday I got my new converted Sankey up and going. It is done up 
as a drain plate type with a pickup tube going to a TEEL SS ball valve 
cheesy ASCII follows:


|         | top 'o' keg
|         |
|           _|
|          / ~====  ball valve
|         / /~====
|        / / | *SIDE VIEW*
|       / /  |
|         / /<--------PU tube
\     / / /
 \  _ _ /_/ _ </--------- drain plate
  --\_______/--


the drain plate is ~ 4" round and had 1/8" parallel slots ~3/8" apart and 2" 
long running through it. The plate has a slipring collar in the middle of it 
in which the pickup tube goes through. The plate's side sit on the bottom of 
the keg, providing a 1/2" space underneath it.


I used a propane fired 'cache cajun cooker' rated at 135K BTU, it brought 15 
gallons of 60 deg tapwater to a boil in 20 minutes. I did a partial 
decoction mash with my rubbermaid cooler (Ive now ran out of space there, 
thanks..) and used the cooker to boil the 'first runnings' from the strike 
mash to raise the temp up to 155 deg. my recipe follows:


5 oz kent goldings `at` 5.1 AAU
30 lbs M+F pale ale malt
3 lbs 80'L crystal


I then let the mash sit for 45 mins `at` 155 deg to fully convert. meanwhile I 
was heating up the 15 gallons of sparge water up to 170 deg. First runnings 
from the picnic cooler were coming out at a high rate of speed, so I slowed 
the runoff rate down, and kept sparging and then recirculating for about 30 
mins (3 times recirculated). I got about 17 gallons of wort (aaagh!!), so I 
put 14 gallons in the keg and put the rest aside. I boiled with most of the 
hops for 70 mins, and then boiled the remaining 3 gallons for 30 mins. the 
wort was a little 'coarse' smelling but I attribute that to the poor 
condition of the hops I used. The hot break was pretty good, but the wort 
was qute cloudy, in spite of a settling period of 15 minutes.I stuffed my 
now woefully inadequate immersion chiller right into the keg for cooling 
purposes. The drain plate worked quite well in keeping out the gunk and 
hops. The TEEL valve areated the wort nicely as it came out, as I had no 
drain off tube on the side of the keg, and the wort shot out the side of the 
keg, and had to be aimed into the appropriate brewing vessel.


 notes from the session: 'need a drain tube for racking' 'two people is a 
must for carrying purposes' 'investigate different wort chiller ?counterflow 
time?' 'need a better racking system for the picnic cooler to keg transfers'


End result: 16 gallons of 1.054 wort, split into 3 batches, 1 fermenting in 
plastic, 1 in a carboy, and 1 in a cornelius keg. all a doing nicely, but 
the 'father' is a little worse for wear.. I used up about 1/4 of a 20 lb 
tank of Propane, and got some fresh air... _very_ tired at the end of the 
day.

Probably you already guessed it is seasonal.  This time of the year is

of the year to brew is on June 21.

Production of DMS and acids (either lactic or acetic) will cause these
characteristics.  Sounds like its pointing towards a bacteria infection.

More evidience supporting bacteria.  Long lag times allow the bacteria to
multiply before the drop in O2 content and ph in the fermenting beer puts
the bacteria to sleep.  (correct me if I'm wrong here HBDers (I know
you will :-) ))

It is probably an airborn organism.  Close windows when brewing, banish
the pets to outdoors, turn off fans, let the room air settle before
transfering cooled wort or racking, grind grain away from transfering
areas.

I assume you mean the first batch was ok, but the second batch was
spoiled.  The "bug" may not have gotten a good foot hold in the first
batch but built up enough numbers there to get going in the second
batch.  You could wash your yeast.  See yeast FAQ.

I used to get the "Chicago" infection (a wild yeast I think) when I used
bleach as a sanitizer.  Tasted like a cross between chalk and burning
electronics (Those of you from the Windy City who remember Tap & Growler's
lagers know what I mean)


After I lost 3 batches in a row to this beast, I got serious.  I now use
straight 3% Hydrogen peroxide to sanitize and rinse briefly with water.
Haven't had a re-occurance since <kok... kok, sound of knocking on wooden
head> and stuff doesn't smell like bleach when I'm done.  One note, use
rubber gloves when using peroxide.  It tore up by finger tips so bad that
I was sporting band-aids almost constantly.  I finally put two and two
together and figgered out that my fingers would split open about one week
after every time I brewed (duh!).

To insure that the agar is sterile, it must be autoclaved.  Since autoclaves
are a bit beyond most HBers budget, a pressure cooker works just about as
well.  The temp gets above the 212F boiling point of water due to the pressure
of the steam.  This will wipe out the nasties and their spores.  Nasties
being a technical term.


You don't HAVE to do it, but you'll have a better chance of success if you

In my part of the U.S., there are some corn syrup products which have

Subject: Dunkelweizen


A while back I posted a quest for dunkelweizen recipes.  I got lots of
advice, and decided to follow this one from Steve Dempsey (others
had similar advice):


  [Eric Warner] says that any real dark German beer gets its color
  from the medium/dark munich malts.  Using the roasted malts like
  chocolate will give you plenty of color but not impart the right malt
  flavor profile.


So, cutting the "shuck & jive", here's the recipe:


        2.5 lb Belgian (DWC) Munich malt (8L)
        5.0 lb Belgian (DWC) wheat malt
        0.4 lb Ireks dark crystal (90L?)
        0.1 lb Chocolate malt


Mash schedule (double decoction)
        Strike with 2.75gal `at` 56C
        30 min 52-51C
        decoct 40%
                15 min raise to 70C, 15 min rest
                15 min raise to 100C, boil 30 min
        return decoction, raise mash to 60C.  
        Take 6 quarts, heat to 70C, return to mash get 63C
        30 min rest
        Take 6 quart 2nd decoction, 
                heat to 70C over 10 min, rest 20 min
                10 min raise to boiling, boil 20 min
        Return decoction, raise mash to 70C
        60 min rest
        Sparge 7 gallons `at` 1.031 (oops -- low!)


Boil 1:30, hopping:
        20g Hersbrucker `at` T-60min
        8g Hersbrucker `at` T-15min


Collect 5 gallons `at` 1.042 (Again, lower than target)
Pitch YeastLab W51 from starter.


Fermentation ran for 14 days between 70-75F (I think it was done after
7, but I didn't have time to bottle).  Bottled with 1c corn sugar.
Warm conditioned 1 week to carbonate
Cold conditioned 4 weeks `at` 50-45F.


Tasting notes:


It's missing the real MALTiness I was trying for, but at least some of
that can be attributed to my lousy extraction rate (which I attribute
to a bad Corona crush -- I opened it up too much so as not to burn out
the motor on my electric drill).  The clove character is there, and
it's not highly banana-y (surprising, given the fermentation
temperature).  A nice beer, but not the award-winner I had hoped for.
(It got a 32/50 in our club's Weiss is Nice taste-off.)


Next time:


What will I do to improve it?  Several things:
1. Better grain crushing.  Either crank the Corona down & buy a new
   drill, or borrow a friend's MaltMill.
2. Try roasting some of my own dark wheat malt and/or dark Munich to
   replace the dark crystal & chocolate malts.
3. Tune in my decoction procedure better.  I never manage to hit my
   sugar rests right the first time, but with practice, I'll
   eventually figure out how much to take.  Also, I'll try doing a
   starch test after the sugar rest during the decoction(s).  I think
   I may have underconverted during these rests, leading to overall
   conversion problems.

Subject: Re: Relevance of boiling hop varieties


Paul Sovcik recently asked;
>Does it really matter what variety of hop you use when you are using
>it as an early addition?
Yes it does matter as not all IBU's are equal. That is, there can be a vast
difference between the bitterness imparted by two hop varieties even if the
number of IBU's are the same. For example if you use sufficient Chinook to
produce 30 IBU's and make the same beer with 30 IBU's of Perle (or another
variety) the resulting beers will not be the same. The Chinook batch will
have a much more noticable harsh bitterness than many other lower alpha
varieties. 


>I mean, all you really want to get out of it are bittering units, and the

The aroma and flavor (other than bitterness) will be boiled off but the
characteristics which result in smooth, harsh or astringent bitterness
will not.
 
>Therefore, might it be not a whole lot cheaper to buy super high alpha
>hops and dole out small, carefully measured amounts for the 60' boiling
>additions?
I used to do just that. I would use a small amount of Chinook for base
bittering and "noble" varieties for finishing and dry hopping. I produced 
good beer and yes, it was cheaper. At some point I decided to try the same
recipes with "noble" hops only and found a marked difference. In most cases
the resulting bitterness was much smoother and enjoyable and my beers are
better for it. My theory now is that the choices made for bittering hops
are just as important to the finished product as the choices made for late
additions and dry hopping. 
 
>Or am I missing something....  is using Saaz as a boiling hop going to

Although I don't have any experience with Eroica specifically, I would guess
that there would indeed be a noticable difference. 


These comments are the results of my own experiments and some of you may not
agree. If so, I welcome other opinions.
