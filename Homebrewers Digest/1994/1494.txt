Subject: Re: Infection




Dan Wood writes of an infection that has been troubling him and some
friends.  I don't have my notes handy, so there might be errors in
what I am about to say.  Hopefully others in HBD will correct me as
needed.  My response to Dan follows.


Based on the symptoms you describe I have reached a fairly firm
conclusion of the nature of your problem . . . And the answer is . . .


              [ i think  :-) ]


Coliform bacteria present in minute amounts in your water.  I would
guess that it is getting into your beer when you *rinse* your fermentor
following sanitization.  Below are responses to selected symptoms.


> 2. The infections mostly occur in brews made in late spring and summer.


Seasonal infections are common, particularly in spring/summer since
the air is simply teaming with microbiota.  More to the point, municiple
water supplies often change on a seasonal basis.  It is reasonable that
the coliforms are only present in your water during late spring and summer.


> 4. It smells of rotting vegetables (definitely not HSA), and has a slightly
> sour taste.  The smell is much worse than the taste.


Sounds like dimethylsulfide (DMS) [ H3C-S-CH3 ], often described as
"cooked cabbage."  And coliforms make the stuff in large quantities.


> 5. The degree of infection grows exponentially with longer lag times.


Bingo.  Coliforms are low pH or ethanol intolerant (uh, I don't remember
which, maybe both).  As soon as the yeast get going lowering pH and making
ethanol, the coliforms cease to do their damage.


> 6. The infection has been present in both hazy and clear beers.  It does
> not create gushers.  There are no visible indications of infection.


The coliform bacteria is either dormant or dead by the time your beer gets
into the bottle.  See item 5.


> 7. It seems independent of the yeast: whether dry yeast (usually Yeastlabs
> Whitbread) or generous Wyeast starters were used.


As stated earlier, it is not comming from dry yeast, but your water.  As
for yeast starters, how generous?  Underpitching is one of the most common
mistake amoung homebrewers.  Lets face it, growing all that yeast is a 
pain in the butt.  Do it.  Minimum pitching quantities for a five gallon
batch are slurry from a quart starter for ales and slurry from a two quart
starter for lagers.  Dan, you *need* starters this size.  Unless you *like*
that aroma in your beer.


Another thing to be careful of is relative temperatures of the yeast and
the beer.  Significant differences in temperature at pitching time weakens
or kills yeast, making for long lag times and weak fermentations.  You
can not afford long lag times.


> 8. It has happened regardless of whether the siphon was started by
> mouth-to-straw or prefilling the hose with water.


Yes, but if you take steps to sanitize your fermentor rinse water you
might start to see a corrolation with infection and prefilling your
siphon hose with unsanitized water *iff* you siphon your beer from your
boiler to your primary.  This item is related to the discussion under
symptom 5 above.


> 9. It is evident in the primary carboy, not caused by racking, kegging,
> or bottling.


Yes, again, see symptom 5 above.


> I managed to avoid it on my last batch (fingers crossed) through use of

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There you are.  Kill the b*st**ds before they get to your fermentor.


What to do:


1) Adopt methods that avoid use of any unsanitized water prior to onset
   of fermentation.  Some sanitizing agents do not require a rinse.  I
   don't recall what they are (I use bleach) but I am sure others in HBD
   will gladly assist you here.  Another approach is simply to sanitize
   your rinse water.  Pre-boiling rinse water is arguably the best approach,
   but rather difficult.  You can also rinse in a weak bleach solution
   (one ounce per 5 gallons).  This approach is controversial, as you
   can well imagine.  If the bleach is too strong, you taste it, too weak
   and it doesn't do the job.  Be careful that the cure is not worse than
   the disease.


2) Pitch adequate quantities of yeast as described under symptom 7 above.


3) Call your local water department and ask to speak with the "water
   quality lab."  You will probably get to talk to the head water chemist,
   who is also the only employee of the water quality lab.  And she will
   probably talk your ear off once she realizes you are not calling
   complain about the taste of the water and are really interested in
   the water chemistry.  Yes, this person likely works alone all day and
   may be starved for intelligent conversation about her work.  At least
   that is the way things are where I live.  You can learn a great deal
   from such a conversation.  This step will help to confirm (or deny!)
   the theory I have presented.


   Questions to ask:  What is the bacteria count? [you might get a "pat"
   answer of zero, which is what it is supposed to be.  In this case a
   concilliatory response of "Gee, I can see how such a strict standard
   may be hard to adhear to, do you ever have a problem with bacteria?]
   Do bacteria issues vary with season?  How does the water supply vary
   with season?  Do you have more than one source of water?


   Ask about nitrate/nitrite concentrations and how they relate to
   bacteria in the source water.  [There is an important connection
   here, but I don't recall what it is.  Your local water chemist
   will know more than I ever have.  Others on HBD will also be able
   to help.  Anyone?]


   Another tack is simply to describe what you ar doing (brewing beer)
   and the problem you are having and ask for advice.  Say something
   like "Sometimes when I brew beer I get this rotten vegatable smell.
   Someone I know said this smell might be dimethylsulfide and that
   coliform bacteria can produce this compound.  Does this explanation
   make sense to you?"  The chemist will likely have a lot to say about
   the topic.


Good luck.

Subject: Isolating wild yeast


My next brew is going to be a Colorado pale ale -- I have 10 lbs of
locally grown and malted barley, homegrown hops, and pure Rocky Mountain
spring water(tm).  The only "imported" ingredient will be the yeast.


This got me thinking.  How difficult would it be to isolate some local
strain of wild yeast that would make good beer?  I've done some
culturing, but I'm not sure I have the expertise or equipment to 
accomplish this task.


I imagine the procedure (greatly simplified) would be something like this:


1.  Set out a plate of yeast-hospitable medium for a day or so.
2.  Using a microscope, pick out single cells of yeast that look like
    they may be of different varieties. (How might I do this?)
3.  Place each "single cell culture" onto its own plate or slant to grow.
4.  Try each yeast strain in a test batch (1 liter?) and rate its
    characteristics.


What are the chances that I'd find a strain that worked well?  Would it
have to be some variety of S. cerevisiae, or are there other yeast
species that would work?  Would I be wasting my time?  This certainly
would be a lengthy process.  If I found a good strain, could I patent
it, or would it just be a trade secret? :-)

Subject: Re: Counter Pressure Bottle Filler


Dan Houg asks about counter-pressure bottle fillers:


CPF (Counter Pressure Filler) are designed to fill a bottle under the same
pressure as the keg is under. This keeps the disolved CO2 from escaping during
the filling. Once the CPF is removed, the bottle needs to be capped ASAP.


I looked into a number of them and ended up buying one from BrauKunst in
Mn. It has a pressure relief valve (releases at about 6 PSI) where all the
others have a valve for releasing the pressure out of the bottle (which
allows the beer to flow into it). I put a finger over the release valve to
control the flow rate. I have no problem filling bottles by myself (have heard
others say that it is a 2-man job).


I've been very happy with it. Price: $36 which included the gas and beverage
tubing and the appropriate quick disconnect for the liquid out line from
your keg. Stainless steel tube, brass joints, brass valves for the gas and
liquid lines. It seemed to me to be the best for the $$.


I've also heard good things about the "Benjamin Products" CPF. Cost is closer
to $55 and it is plastic. Heard bad things about the Fox CPF.  St. Patricks
also has a new one - stainless steel, but I haven't tried it ($40).

Subject: Plastic Fermenter Help Needed


In HBD #1490, Phil Miller asks about getting the old beer smell out of his 
plastic fermenter. My suggestion is SUNLIGHT. After each batch, I clean the 
bucket well, then leave it out in the bright sun for a day. It seems to get 
that smell right out of there.  Obviously, you must still sanitize the bucket 
before reusing it. Good Luck!

Subject: Wyeast 1338


As some may remember, I re-plated Wyeast's European Ale yeast because the
first plate appeared to be a mixed strain.  My results strongly indicate
that 1338 is a mixture (always hedging).  One of the strains grows very
fast and vigorously (larger colonies), the other somewhat slower (smaller
colonies).  This is consistent with the observation that 1338 is a fast to
start/slow to finish fermenter. 


If anyone has a way to verify this with Wyeast I would appreciate it.  
Also, if this is a yeast that Wyeast "developed" perhaps a rationale for
the mixed strain might be forthcoming from the company.


By the way I am very happy with the performance of the yeast in my Alt. It
did finish somewhat malty (as hoped) with a low ester profile.  The Mt.
Hood tang comes through quite nicely.  I'm anxious to try it after 3 weeks
cold conditioning in the 'fridge.

No offense taken. I am being, perhaps, a bit sensitive anyway! I need more
homebrew, quite obviously! 


Thanks for your comments and help. Though I have not done extensive
research into costs here in town. Each pkg I have bought (2 AAU values of
Saaz, Hallertau and Kent Goldings has always been the same price) I will do
some price checking in the future.


Many believe for the type of beer I am brewing, which I think may finally
have been determined to be a Brown Ale, using a lower AAU hop and more of
them will yield a better ale.

Hi all, I just brewed a batch of brown ale and what happened is I pitched
the yeast at 7:00 in the morning and by 6:00 in the evening, it was foaming
up alot (pretty unusual I thought).  anyway, by the next morning, the foam
was going down somewhat, and by that evening, there was no more foam.  What
happened?  It seemed to be going so nicely at first and then nothing!  I
used Edme dried yeast if that makes any difference.

If you havent been popping the fermentation lock off of the mead, you 
shouldnt have any problem, I had a mead that took 6 months to fully ferment 
out, and the flavors to mellow. you     should'nt have any problems. Also 
look into using Bentonite (its a clay..) as a clarifier. 2 applications are 
usually what it takes to get your mead crystal clear, and hopefully take any 
oxidization(if you have it) components with it...

the book so dont have any more) quoted a price of $10.15 plus $4 for
postage and handling. I cant recall anything that said any more was
payable for customers here in Australia (or any other foreign country).
But when the book arrived a few days ago, they had charged me $9, or
nearly the price of the book, for postage and handling.
  If anyone out there still has an intact copy of the glossy leaflet I
refer to, could you check and let me know whether the order form says
anything which might justify my being charged $9 for postage and handling
on this item, please?

     In a disagreement (two or more conflicting opinions) it is almost
always the case that each side can learn something from the other(s),
often to the advantage of all concerned.

     You've said a great deal there. I suggest you stop trying to tell
him that he is "doing something wrong" until the day arrives when (if
ever) he makes a bad batch that can be proved to be as a result of
poor sanitation practices. Then you can really gloat! :)
     You do not say how bad your friend's practices are so I may be being
unfair. Perhaps he does some really disgusting things but I am
assuming that he at least washes his equipment after use - at least to
the extent that he washes the plates, knives, forks etc. that he eats with.
I do NOT advocate poor practices in any way shape or form but have a real
problem with those who preach sanitation/sterilisation to the level of
paranoia as I have seen many times on HBD and r.c.b. Cleanliness and
common sense should prevail.
     I do not use any chemical sterilisation/sanitation agents - I clean
my equipment with washing-up liquid after use (rinsing very well). My
hydrometer and thermometer are simply rinsed under the hot tap after use
and dried with a clean towel. I use English top-working ale yeast and
leave my fermenting vessels open to the air as is traditional with such
yeasts. I use plastic utensils some of which are 3 years old. In the
past few years, I have brewed 30+ batches of brew (kits, extract and
full grain) and 30+ gallons of wine (some kit, some real fruit). I have
never made an undrinkable wine (early efforts were a little yeasty due
to not finishing properley) and only 4 batches of "bad" beer - two were
from the same make of kit which I decided was a poor kit, one (another
kit) had a satchet of hop extract which I added all of instead of
a small amount making the thing VERY bitter and the other was as a result
of flourination of the water where I used to live. None of my friends or
family have ever refused any of my beer or wine and my efforts have
inspired a couple of them to starting making their own. I shall continue
to be less than paranoid about sanitation/sterilisation of my equipment
until the day I get an infected brew. If this ever happens I promise to
tell you all about it so you can say "I told you so".
     This message was not intended to offend nor was it aimed specifically
at Victor Franklin. This in my opinion is a candidate for the saying
"Relax, Don't Worry..." etc.

Actually, if lessons learned from cooking apply to brewing, you *want* such an
aluminum pot to be discolored.  This means a protective oxide coating has 
formed.  You are lucky to have this happen, as it means you get no more 
aluminum dissolving.  If you happen to scrub it shiny, you are in bad shape 
once again.


So, like you would with a well-used aluminum pot or pan, wipe food off it, but
try and keep it in the discolored state, as it protects the pot from 
dissolving and your food/wort from excess aluminum.

Subject: Looking for Corona Mill replacement plates


I've been experimenting with modifying my Corona, and so far
have made some improvements by fixing the plates so they
are constantly parallel and tuning it etc.  


Recently I wanted to modify the grinding plates to see if I
could reduce the amount of shredding of husk.  I began to grind the
plates so the grooves were not so sharp.  It seemed to be working
as I ground them more and more flat, until I went a bit too far.
I finished it off by grinding them completely flat to see if it
would more like a regular mill.  It became really hard to crank.
I began grinding rounded edge grooves back into the flat plates
and might end up with something interesting eventually.


In the meantime, the darn thing is too hard to crank and anyway I'd
like to get some new plates for comparison purposes.


Any ideas on where to find them?

Subject: keg system leak




Greetings All,


Well I've got a slow leak somewhere in my system. I thought I had it fixed when
I put new O-rings on the keg locks and bought a new regulator but I was wrong.


I am using a pin lock Cornelius keg. I've replaced the o-rings around the 
outside of the pin locks. I'm using about 12 psi of CO2 and I dump a tank about
every 10 days. I've checked for leaks using a liquid leak check detector and
can't seem to find any. There also a new washer between the CO2 tank and
regulator. The large O-ring on the lid seems to be sealing ok (can;t see a leak)
but maybe I should replace it. I've got a new one from Williams brewing thats
supposed to be better than the original ones.


If anyone has any advice or experiences they would like to share please drop me
a message. This CO2 is expensive!


Many thanks,

Subject: Cost of all-grain equipment




<<<<<< Attached TEXT item follows >>>>>>
Text item: Text_1
     Hi Folks,
     
     A few months ago there was some discussion about the cost of acquiring 
     equipment for all-grain brewing.  I have been buying stuff for that 
     same purpose, and have been keeping receipts.  Note that I *didn't* 
     try to do this as cheap as possible.  I elected to get highest (IMHO) 
     quality stuff that will last a long time.
     
     The equipment I purchased/fabricated is:
     
     Mash/Lauter Tun consisting of a 10 gal. Gott cooler with a Phils 
     Phalse Bottom.  I replaced the spigot with a valve, and used various 
     tubing sizes to connect the valve to the false bottom. 
     
     Sub-Total          $78.02
     
     Wort Chiller is of the counter-flow variety.  Length is 25 feet.  The 
     chiller is fastened around a 5 gal bucket and has a ball valve on the 
     wort outflow end.  The valve regulates wort flow, and also allows 
     filling the device with a sanitizer solution for storage. 
     
     Sub-Total          $52.29
     
     Brew Pot is a converted 1/2 bbl. Sankey keg.  The keg has a hole 
     drilled near the base with Cu tubing inserted and sealed with some 
     bulkhead fittings. A Cu pot scrubber is fastened to the 'inside the 
     keg' end of the tubing, and a ball valve is attached to the other end. 
      1/2" thread-to-compression fittings on both the keg outflow and 
     chiller inflow allow connection with a 1 ft. high temperature hose. 
     
     Sub-Total          $73.80
     
     Brinkman Stove (160K BTU) with a 20 lb. propane tank is the heat 
     source.  I had to have a friend weld some supports on the stove ring 
     to accommodate the keg's diameter(this can be done at a local weld 
     shop for $10 - $20).
     
     Sub-Total          $81.20
     
     
     Grand Total       $285.31
     
     
     This setup works _very_ well.  Gravity moves the liquids and all 
     interfaces are mechanical (no siphoning).  It may sound to some like a 
     large investment, but the ingredients for a 5 gal. batch cost $15 less 
     now as compared with my extract batches.  So, it'll pay for itself in 
     20 batches.
     
     Private e-mail if you want detailed prices and materials, or to 
     comment.

Decoction is the process of bringing a portion of your mash up fairly
slowly through saccharification temperature range, boiling it for
several minutes, returning it to the main mash, and repeating if
desired. You may do a single decoction to boost you from a protein
rest to starch conversion temp, or a double or triple decoction as
well.


I believe the consensus is to remove the thickest part of the mash
for each decoction to minimize enzyme denaturing during boiling, 
except for a decoction used to boost from starch conversion to
mash-out.  For this decoction, mash liquid is run-off, boiled and
returned to the mash to minimize unconverted starch brought
back into the main mash by this final decoction.                


I think Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer' is the best decoction reference
of the commonly available brewing books.

IMO, Anchor Steam has a kind of weird bitterness that I beleive to be
unrelated to Northern Brewer hops, but to me seems like a bitterness
that is sometimes obtained in pale, bitter beers made with carbonate
water.  Comments?

Dan Strahs <STRAHS`at`msvax.mssm.edu> gave us the ("REALLY useless" 8~)
etymology for the word hops.  I'm curious if anyone has a complete
etymology for the word "bine".


My American Heritage College Dictionary has the following:


        bine n.  The flexible twining or climbing stem of certain
        plants, such as the hop or woodbine.  [Alteration of BIND,
        VINE.]


        vine n.  1.a.  A weak-stemmed plant that derives its support
        from climbing, twining, or creeping along a surface.  b.  The
        stem of such a plant.


Not much help in determining how hop stems got their own word.  My
Webster's Unabridged at home isn't much help either.  The alteration
is fairly obvious, but why the separate designation?  Any linguists
out there have an answer?

I have somewhat of a newbie question. I've been solely an extract brewer
for several years and am gearing up to switch to all-grain. I know
what I need now and plan to obtain all that stuff within the next few
weeks or months (I'm in the process of moving and my new home will
have a great brewery in the basement). I plan to make an immersion
chiller, because of the relative ease of making one. My question is
this, here in Colorado, (and I imagine all over the west) we technically
live in a desert and it's considered evil to waste water. I estimate
running water through a wort chiller for 10-20 minutes would send
upwards of 50 gallons down the drain. Do any of you people have convient
ways to reuse the water? What's the word, water conscious brewers?

ps. maybe I should collect the warm water into a tub and give my dogs a

I guess that people would rather read this stuff than the bounces
of HBD #1490 again and again, so here is yet another installment of


The beginners guide to advanced and all-grain brewing
By Richard B. Webb, the Brews Brother's 1993 Homebrewer of the year


part 2
1.3.     Mashing and Lautering


A tun is a container that is used to maintain certain environmental 
conditions while 
the malt sugar is being created. The mash tun holds the grain in a 
soup of water and 
sugar during this process. A lauter tun allows the liquid surrounding 
the grains to be 
drained off, while allowing more rinsing water (the sparge) to be 
run through the grains, 
allowing even further sugar extraction. One attribute of a good mash 
tun is the ability to 
allow liquid to flow easily through a straining system incorporated 
in the tun. An example 
of this kind of mash tun involves a bucket with some sort of false 
bottom inside of 
another bucket. This sieve design allows the grains to form a filter 
bed while allowing the 
sweet liquor to flow through the false bottom strainer. I tried this 
system, but I wasn't 
very happy with it. The sieve design took forever to make, and the 
whole thing suffered a 
major flaw in temperature control. Another of the attributes of a 
good tun is the ability 
to maintain a steady temperature, and the un-insulated bucket system 
just falls short. 
The most versatile tun that I've found is made from a large 
picnic cooler, with straining 
filters placed in the bottom to let the liquified sugars pass through 
while restraining the 
spent grains. This set up combines the best attributes of the mash 
and lauter tuns into a 
single device, saving money, process steps, and a mess on the kitchen 
floor. (Another 
reason I do my mashing in the garage...) My tun system incorporates 
a series of PVC pipe 
sections into which slits have been sawn. These sections are  joined 
with PVC elbow, Tee 
and X sections to form a sieve type filter. The original design had 
a lot of joining 
sections, with poles of PVC pipe jutting into the bottom of the grain 
bed. This unwieldy 
structure was connected to the cooler drain spout, which allows the 
liquid to be drained 
out. A small rubber stopper fits over the spout, and a valve in the 
other end of the 
stopper allows the control of liquid flow from the tun.


My latest design of the sieve is a very simple one. Instead of a trident 
design of pipes 
all along the bottom of the tun, I now use two four inch sections 
of slotted pipe, joined at 
the center with a PVC Tee section. End caps keep the grain out of 
the ends of the plastic 
pipes, and the outlet from the Tee section is connected to the cooler's 
outlet. Not only is 
this design simpler, but it is also harder to dislodge from the outlet. 
The smaller number 
of slits gives a longer sparge time, which increases the sugar extraction 
rate.


If one of your goals is to maximize the amount of sugar that you can 
create from your 
grains (the ones that you've spent good money for!), then you need 
to know about 
sparging. In this example, sparging is the running of hot water through 
the hot grains to 
dissolve the last bits of sugar from the mash. This is best done gently 
and slowly. If the 
water is flushing through the grain, pathways of water are formed, 
channeling the water 
around, and not through the grains. Hot water is used, but the temperature 
of the grains 
should never exceed 170 degrees Fahrenheit, as this would leech out 
harsh bitter oils 
from the grain husks. And the quantity of water must be such that 
after a sixty minute 
boil, the amount of wort called for in your recipe is the amount you 
wind up with. If you 
do make an error, it's probably better to wind up with to little liquor 
after the boil, 
because it's relatively easy to add sterile water to the fermenter, 
while any excess liquor 
is subject to contamination as it is stored. The important points 
to remember are 1) 
gentile sparging, 2) temperature control, and 3) try to get the quantities 
right!


When creating such a tun and filter system, there are some points 
that you should 
keep in mind. The size of the tun determines the amount of grain you 
can mash, and if 
your tun is too small, you will be restricted to making light and 
wimpy beers, because you 
simply have no room to mash larger amounts of grain. When buying a 
cooler to make 
into a tun, get one with a drain system already in place. Drilling 
your own hole is a 
gateway to frustration. Finally, use high temperature PVC pipe for 
your filtering system. 
The maximum temperature required in a tun is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, 
a 
temperature sufficient to melt many thinner grades of pipe. The pipes 
won't become 
liquid at that temperature, but they will warp, allowing grain to 
enter the sieve, plugging 
up your system. You haven't lived until you have to spoon 25 or more 
pounds of grain 
into a straining bag because your filtering system has failed.

Hullo,


     I will be starting a new job next month in Covington, GA (about 30 miles 
east of Atlanta) and I need some help from local beer lovers.  Can those of you
in the know give me info on local:


     A) Brewpubs in the Atlanta area


     B) Shops at which to buy homebrew supplies - I am partial mashing right
        now, but I am rapidly moving towards all grain (especially since I

        King Cooker!)


     C) Good commercial beer sources (ie. large selection of imports and
        quality domestics).


Thanks for your assistance.


At the risk of starting another mill argument (oh no!), I would just like to 
say that I recently acquired a Glatt Mill and like it very much.  I have also 
used the Phil Mill and the Malt Mill (TM) and I think the Glatt crush is as 
good as the MM and superior to the PM.  As I see it the big advantage of the 
Glatt is the complete adjustability of the rollers.  The advantage of the MM is
the convenience of sitting on top of a 5 gal bucket (less mess).  Both seem to 
do a great job crushing and I think both are good purchases.  BTW, I payed $109
plus $8 shipping from CA for my Glatt, and I had to mount it to a table top  
before use.


No affiliation, just thought I'd give my impressions.


Have fun, and brew well my little droogies.
