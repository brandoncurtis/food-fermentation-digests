Yet another installment of


The beginners guide to advanced and all-grain brewing
By Richard B. Webb, the Brews Brother's 1993 Homebrewer of the year


part 5


The Mash (cont)


2.2.    Extracts


Commercial malt extracts are made in the same way as I have described 
above. 
However, the extract manufactures have taken the extra step of removing 
some or all of 
the water that the sugar is suspended in. Doing this requires a tremendous 
amount of 
energy, both in the heating of the extract, and in the vacuum process 
by which water is 
most economically removed. Furthermore, certain unscrupulous extract 
manufacturers 
have been suspected of substituting corn sugars and other cheaper 
sugar alternatives for 
malt sugar in order to increase profits on their products. All grain 
brewing allows you to 
be 100% sure about what goes into your pridefully crafted brews.


There is nothing wrong or sinful about using malt extracts. There 
are many wonderful 
malt extract kits available in the market today. Extract brewers have 
taken many knocks 
concerning their "beginner" status. This is mere provincialism. 
The use of malt extracts 
allows the all-grain brewer to thicken up a batch of normally extracted 
sugars without 
the long term boiling that would otherwise be required to reduce the 
sugar solution to 
the higher gravities required for styles like bocks and barley wines.


2.3.     Non-barley additives


Other substances, called adjuncts, can be added to the mash or kettle 
for a number of 
reasons. The most common adjunct, at least in British style brewing 
are various kinds of 
sugars. Because the malting of barley is so labor intensive, and therefore 
expensive, many 
types of sugars have been added to the boiling kettle to stretch out 
the mix. Along with 
the previously mentioned cane and corn sugars are the intermediate 
steps in the 
production of these sugars. Molasses results from the initial boiling 
of the sap of the 
sugar cane. Condensation of molasses gives a product called brewers 
licorice, which 
tastes very similar. Further refinement yields brown sugar, and finally 
cane sugar.


Other type adjuncts are more commonly added to the mash tun, with 
the most 
commonly added grain being wheat. Wheat is hard to malt, because it 
lacks a protective 
husk around the grain. Wheat is also higher in proteinaceous material, 
which can lead to 
a particulate haze in the final brew. However, it is impossible to 
make a wheat beer 
without wheat, so one must use it to match a particular style. Also, 
the use of a little 
wheat in the mash can contribute to improved head retention, and so 
many of my recipes 
call for a pound or so of wheat in the grain bill.


Other grains can be added to the mash, but are not always malted. 
Rice is often used 
to stretch out barley sugars. In fact, the big mega-breweries use 
a lot of rice (and corn) 
to make the beer that makes the money that powers the hydroplanes 
and dragsters that 
seem to be these companies main products. Rice is not malted, but 
must be boiled, 
prepared just like you were going to eat it, to soften up the starches 
inside the grain. If 
this is not done, the enzymes provided by the barley malt will not 
be able to gain access 
to the starch in the grain.


Another method of making starch available to the enzymes is used with 
grains like 
rye, oats, and corn. These grains are crushed in special rollers, 
with the heat released by 
this operation serving to cook the grain. The crushing action also 
makes little grain bits 
out of big grain bits, making enzyme access that much easier. These 
grains, especially rye 
and oats, could also be boiled, but this would allow some nasty oils 
to be leeched out.


What other kinds of starch can be used to make beer? Your imagination 
(and the 
trust of your friends) is all that stands between you and the next 
big micro-brewing 
revolution. If you can think of a starch, it can probably be mashed 
into your next brewing 
adventure. Many cultures make their own kind of beer without knowledge 
of barley, but 
other sources of converting enzymes must be found. Sake is a type 
of rice beer that uses 
only rice for starch and sugar. A special mold is added that releases 
the enzyme that is 
responsible for this transformation. Millet and other grains are used 
for many 
intoxicating native beverages. In many cultures, it is the women's 
job to masticate (or 
chew) the grains to make them soft. Their saliva contains the same 
enzyme that converts 
starch to sugar. (This is where the trust of your friends comes in. 
Maybe you don't want 
to tell them how you made the beer until after they've tried it...) 
For other sources of 
starch, the sky's the limit. Potatoes? Sure. Pumpkins? Why not. Peanuts? 
OK. Chickens? 
Well maybe not. The important thing is not to limit yourself to doing 
what everybody else 
does. You can't learn anything if you don't make mistakes.


Till next time,

In #1498, Mark Evans told of his Hop Vine Monument.  Several
years ago, my brother gave me a couple of bits of cascade.  I
threw them into the ground right next to my deck. Two years
later, it became obvious that the vine was no longer satisfied
climbing to the top of my deck rail, so I trellised it to the
roof of my ranch house.  No longer satisfied with living the
bound life of trellis vine, my cascade explored the outer
limits of known space by creeping up the TV antenna which
extends about 10 or so feet above the roof.  Now a year later,
I harvest cascade from my TV antenna while perched on a
step-ladder on the roof.  Although I don't reccommend this
harvesting method for everyone, I personally find it uniquely
exhilerating.  My wife still swears that the TV doesn't bring
those channels in like it used to.

Subject: Chewing tobacco as pest control


Ed Ditto mentioned using a chewing tobacco solution for beetle control,
apparently an effective measure.  Nicotine is used widely as a pesticide
for all kinds of nasties, so it's not surprising that it works well for
beetles.


His caution about spraying vines vs. cones is somewhat understandable, if
he's not a smoker, he probably ought to avoid it, but smokers can probably
go ahead and spray everything, as they'll get far more nicotine from their
cigarettes than from their hops.


I'm curious as to the cost efficiency of steeping chewing tobacco vs. just
buying some kind of nicotine spray at the local hardware/garden shop.

How do people use their CO2 bottle for uses other than plugging

The FEDERAL limit is 100 gallons for one head of household, and
a maximum of 200 gallons per household per year.  I doubt that CA's

First, I have 2 cases of 12oz refillable beer bottles (mostly SA or same 
type) to give away to anyone who wants them (free!).  E-mail me (I live 
in Albuquerque, NM) if you need them.


Second, does anybody remember "Colorado Chillers," made by Coors in about 
1984-85?  I lived in a special test market and consumed many (yes, I 
liked them big commercial brews back then) that year.  According to an 
article in Southwest Brewing News (April/May '94), they were suddenly 
removed from the market due to the fact that they would go "skunky" when 
exposed to sunlight (foolish green bottles they were served in).  Well, 
golly, I liked it.  It had a very dry taste and a clean finish (unlike 
Zee Zima's(tm) Fresca(tm) taste).  


Anyone remember these?  If so, have you attempted a recipe to imitate 
it?  If anyone does, please post/e-mail a recipe (extract-based, 
please).

Well, that would be a different formula.  Let's start from "first
principles".  First, I'll derive my "0.004" rule of thumb:


1 "volume" of CO2 at Standard Temperature and Pressure
(STP = 0C, 1atmosphere) contains
        (44 g/mole) / (22 l/mole) = 2 g/l
Thus, 1 liter of CO2 dissolved in 1 liter of water (1 volume) is
2g/1000g = 0.2% by weight.


1 gram of "sugar" produces about 0.5 gram of CO2 when fermented.  Thus
a 1% solution of sugar produces a 0.5% solution of CO2, or 2.5
volumes when fully fermented (attenuated).


Finally, 0.004 SG difference corresponds to a 1% sugar solution, so
0.004 SG difference results in 2.5 volumes carbonation, about right
for a pilsner style, for example.  Again, this assumes 100%
attenuation, which you (should) get from corn sugar, but not from
wort.


Alternatively, to get 1 volume of CO2, you would need a .4% sugar
solution, corresponding to a SG difference of 0.0016.


Next, let's consider attenuation.  From Fix (e-mail, HBD approximately
#880), we have
    RE = .1808*OE + .8192*AE,
where
    OE = original extract (i.e., extract of finished wort in deg. Plato)
    AE = apparent extract (i.e., measured deg. Plato of finished beer).
    RE = real extract of finished beer in deg. Plato


Thus
    RA = 1 - RE / OE = .82 * (1 - AE / OE),
where RA = Real Attenuation (% sugars fermented).


Finally, let's go back to my equation and fix it up to take
attenuation into account.  I had


               V(b)*E(b) + V(w)*E(w)
        E(m) = ---------------------
                   V(b) + E(b)
rearranged to
                [E(m) - E(b)] * V(b)
        V(w) = ----------------------
                    E(w) - E(m)


This doesn't change.  But the calculation of the desired E(m) does
change.  Let VC be the number of volumes of CO2 desired in the
conditioned beer.  This requires the full attenuation of a 0.4*VC
percent sugar solution, or a (0.4*VC / RA) percent wort.  Thus, the
desired rise in final gravity is (1.6 * VC / RA) "SG points".


Thus
        E(m) - E(b) = 1.6 * VC / RA


Plugging this into the equation above, gives
                           VC * V(b)
        V(w) = -----------------------------------------
                0.51 * [1-E(b)/E(w)] * [E(w)-E(b)] - VC


Finally, an example: 1.050 wort, 5 gallons of beer, FG 1.008, desired
carbonation 1.5 volumes, we get
        E(m) - E(b) = 3.5
        V(w) = 0.45gal = 1.8 quarts


Starting with the equation for a given inital volume, where V(i) is
the initial volume, before the wort is taken for priming, we get
                        1.95 * VC * V(i)
        V(w) = ---------------------------------
                [1 - E(b)/E(w)] * [E(w) - E(b)]


The example gives V(w) = 1.7 quarts.

Subject: Special Holiday Ale


Fellow HBDers--


    There have been a few requests in HBD lately for recipes for Holiday
Brews.  I have what I think is quite a unique 8*{) recipe (more like a
meta-recipe, actually) that I would like to share with y'all.  I haven't
actually tried this one, but I think it deserves consideration.


    Special Holiday Ale:  I was buying a glass baster at a HB supply store
some time back, and commented to the guy there that my old plastic baster
smelled like turkey, so I didn't want to get it near my brews.  He said
something about cranberry sauce that got me thinking (always dangerous, but
especially so on this particular day):  Why not make a variation on the
Cock Ale described by Papazian in TNCJOHB, namely a Cranberry-Cock Ale, as
a special brew for the holidays? 8^{0 (It gets worse....)  The next day,
while commuting to work, I got to thinking again (extremely dangerous so
early in the morning).  When I first took up brewing, and started reading
HBD, someone was posting a series of articles for brewing with potatoes (you
guessed it!).  Why not make a Potato-Cranberry-Cock Ale?  Just think about
it.  This could be the perfect holiday brew.  On the one hand, if you don't
manage to get your shopping done for holiday dinner, you could just have a
few of these brews, and you wouldn't notice.  On the other hand, you could
serve this w/ traditional dinner and you and your holiday guests wouldn't
know if you were eating or drinking.


    I should make it clear to the readership that I'm still fairly new to
brewing.  This is my first serious(?) attempt at recipe formulation.  I'm
not sure what the hopping schedule should be, or what yeast use.  Any and
all comments are, of course, welcome.


    Email or post suggestions for improvements and I will collate them and
summarize to a future issue of HBD.


Cheers,

Subject:      That Oaky flavor


A couple of weeks ago I posted a note regarding an oaky flavor in one of
my recent brews. Well, looking at the bottlenecks, there is a ring around the
neck at the beer level. This is a telltale sign of an infection. Unfortunately,
it is not restricted to one bottle, each one has a ring. *SIGH*
An unrelated question, while racking my brew from primary to secondary, the
brew splashed and I'm afraid of that I aerated it. I have had no activity
since racking it (There still was some activity in the air lock on the
primary before I racked) and was wondering if aeration may cause fermentation
activity to subside or stop altogether. I have a tight seal on top, so I
don't think fermentation gasses are escaping. Any ideas, yonder homebrewers,
on aeration and the problems it causes.

Subject: SG corrections again/Anchor Porter thx & info


Dear Friends, in response to my posting of Dave Line's SG correction table
and query about whether it still holds up, I got some clear responses,
some private and a post or two.  Unfortunately Line's table is WAY off at
temperatures >110-120F.  The best correction procedure I got came from
Christopher Lyons via Domenick Venezia.  This is an equation generated
from a third-order polynomial fit to SG vs T data in the CRC Handbook (the
"Rubber Handbook") and is as follows (T in F):


Correction = 1.313454 - 0.132674*T + 2.057793e-03*T^2 - 2.62763e-06*T^3.


This is a big change from the Line approach.  As an example, consider a
wort whose gravity we measure as 1.030 at various temps (ok, so it is a
series of worts <g>).  Here are corrected gravities using the polynomial
and Line's table that I posted the other day (again, no correction at 60F):


Measured grav = 1.030

Wow!  If you believe Line and measure your gravity at high temperature,
you are going to be miles from reality.  Not much change at pitching temps
though, so for me, I have got the ABV about right for my beers but it
looks like I have been overestimating my extraction rates some by using
Line's values for T in the 120-130F range.  Bummer.  All is not rosy
for the polynomial though, because I performed my simple test of
reading the gravity of the same liquid at several temperatures  to see if
I got the same results.  A poster in yesterday's digest (sorry I didn't
write down your name) rightly pointed out that one must be careful
about influences of T distributions and the shape of the testing vessel. 
I tried to minimize these by suspending my (sanitized of course)
hydrometer in the brewkettle after a thorough stir, so that my T and grav
readings were reproducible in at least 3 readings at each T.  Results:


T, F        Measured grav        Poly adjusted        Line adjusted
176        1.024                1.052                >1.066 (Table ends at 170F)
120        1.038                1.049                1.058
92        1.044                1.049                1.049


So, we seem to be converging with the poly, but not with Line, and the
differences are smaller with the polynomial.  I conclude from this that
Dave Line's SG correction should NOT be used--the polynomial, although
apparently not perfect, is a big improvement.


Finally, thanks to the several people who got back to me about the
yeast used in Anchor Porter.  The summary is that, up until about a
year ago, they used the same yeast as in the Steam (2112?), but have
now changed to an ale yeast.  So there is nothing sinful in using 2112 to
make a Porter (data above on SG come from said Porter, BTW).

Seen lots of requests for specific recipes on the board.  Here's one I
worked up, and I thought it was sorta unusual. Perhaps someone else might
enjoy it.  It's another thing to do with that stray Alt yeast you might
have lurking around the fridge.


"Summer's Fading Light Ale"  (the light refers to the color not the strength)


8#  DWC pale malt
1#  DWC aromatic malt
1 oz. caramel malt--30lovi
2# light clover honey


2 oz. grated fresh ginger--45 min


1/4 oz. chinook--full boil
1/2 oz. cascade--25 min.
1/4 oz. cascade--steep
1/4 oz. cascade--dry hopped in secondary--16 days


alt yeast (headstart cultures) 4th pitch
3/4 c. dextrose to prime.


mash: 122f--15": 150f+ 90"
Boil: 75"  ferment temp: 70 F
Primary: 5 days; secondary: 16 days
OG: 1.055; FG: 1.009 (Honey really lowers the FG!)
has a beautiful blonde color with a rosey tinge.  Chinook and ginger really
blend with the cascade.  Slightly warm but refreshing.


Enjoy!

        Not that I'm a linguist in the end 8~).  But as many of us know,
hops are closely related to hemp, which is used to make rope and twine.  
Seems like, long before hops were put into beer, they might have been used
for a similar purpose.  Hence, bynde -> bind ->bine.
        Just an observation - I can't fall back on blaming authorities for
this possible faux-pas.

I too have used this clever gadget for years, and really like it.
Although George's comment has been correct until now, I noticed the
other day at a homebrew supplly dealer that the current models 
ARE NOW SPRING-LOADED! Very nicely done, and the spring seems to be
of good quality. I think the best bottle filler has just been made

Subject: Mash set-up costs: first-time alternatives


The recent thread on mash set-up costs has been fascinating, but I imagine
it could be daunting for a shy, wanna-bee all-grainer.  And while a
cadillac set-up often makes a superior brew, one can scrounge for
equiptment and still make excellent beer.  Then, as prosperity arrives,
upgrade each component.  This is my set-up--which has been only marginally
upgraded in the last few years.  My brew fans (wife, friends, and family)
love my brew and my kids still get new clothes each year when school
starts. ;^)


(this is definitely a five gallon set-up)
5 gal. enamelled/steel pot (got it from mom :^)
6 gal. enamelled/steel pot (got it a flea market near Maquoketa, Ia. for
$5; I'm careful with the handles.
(when my big pot doesn't hold all the wort, I just put the excess in the
other, boil, and combine in the carboy.  it's only a minor hassle.)


Listerman sparge system (my big purchase) $34.95
(this replaced my leaky old Zapap lauter)


Immersion Wort chiller (a major mash component need): 25 ft. of 3/8 copper
($18) bent into a coil; 
plastic hosing for each end(12 ft: $6) hose clamp ($1.50) replacement
coupling for faucet ($2)


mash tun: a box large enough to hold my brew pot.  The box is lined on all
sides with 1/2 inch rigid styrofoam insulation (A la Papazian).  I found
the insulation in the cellar of a house I rented.


Heat source; a four burner gas stove ( a friend gave it to us)


Total for this stuff?  About $75 bucks.  
        There is a bit of moving around in my system.  The floor always
needs mopping afterward.  The grains that don't get to my compost get
slurped up by the dog. My next move is to get one of those Phil's Phillers.
Then perhaps a nice SS 7-10 gallon pot. No...I better wait until after I
get my degree in December.

In a recent HBD, Timothy Sixberry says:

> had every problem previously mentioned and more.  Then some kind soul here

I went exactly the opposite way - first the tube on the end of the tap to
the Braukunst CPF.  Bottling from the tap produced 30% foam and lost a fair
amount of carbonation.


Here is how I use the Braukunst CPF successfully:
1.) I put a bunch of ice and water in an empty keg with a little sterilizer
    (iodine based). I use this right before I start bottling to completely
    cool the CPF. Otherwise, the first 2-3 bottles have more foaming as
    the CPF cools down. This is not unique to the Braukunst CPF, it is
    part of the reaction when a carbonated liquid is warmed up.


2.) Completely chill all the bottles (I put mine in the freezer with a cap
    loosely placed on top).


3.) Have your keg as cold as possible.


4.) The procedure:
    A.) Purge the bottle with CO2
    B.) Cover the release valve with a finger to allow the pressure to
        build up (2-3 seconds). Then shut off the gas valve.
    C.) Turn on the beer valve. Notice that since your finger is still
        covering the release valve, that no beer flows in.
    D.) Slowly let pressure out of the release valve so that the bottle
        fills slowly. You should have very little foaming. I never completely
        remove my finger from the release valve - it flows to fast then and
        causes a lot of foaming.
    E.) When the liquid level reaches the desired point in the bottle,
        completely cover the release valve again. Some foam may come
        out the release valve before the liquid is at the desired level,
        but after 3-4 bottles I don't get any foam coming through the
        pressure release valve.
    F.) Turn off the beer valve.
    G.) Keep you finger over the release valve for another 3-4 seconds.
        Slowly remove your finger from the release valve (lets the little
        pressure in the head space out).
    H.) Remove the CPF, cap.
    I.) Go back to A.)


5.) Run some more of the solution in step 1.) through the CPF and release
    valve to clean it.




> 
> So- COUNTER PRESURE BOTTLE FILLER  FOR SALE !!  Used once and never again.
> $20     If your still interested drop me a line.
> 


Part of why I bought the Braukunst CPF, was the money back if not satisfied
clause. Send it back and get your $36 refund. I think if you try my method
first, you'll end up keeping it.


For those of you who have a non-Braukunst CPF, the pin/ball valve on your CPF
where you release the CO2/air from the bottle is a pressure relief valve
(releases at about 6 PSI) on the Braukunst CPF. I simply use my finger to
control the flow / release rate from the bottle. I also have no problems
filling bottles all by myself.

Sounds like a classic British technique.  This is commonly done in 
several Peter Austin Breweries.  Funny, the Austin systems typically
use Ringwood yeast which is a high diacetyl producer anyway.  Some
folks just cant enough diacetyl.  Personnaly, I dont mind some, but
a lot of these beers push the levels way beyond what I prefer.

Subject: Legal to make homebrew in West Virginia ?




There's been a lot of discussion the last couple days about the
legality of homebrewing in West Virginia, sparked by Paul Stokely's
story of a friend who had his beer & equipment confiscated.


Everyone was quick to accuse the cop of being ignorant and
overzealous, but maybe he knew something we don't. (Did you
notice that *NOBODY* cited an actual state code or a binding
court decision???)


Lots of observations about how there are homebrew supply shops
in the state, and how there are homebrew clubs, but that doesn't
prove much. When did Georgia finally sanction homebrewing? I 
believe it was only in the past few months. Yet there have been
clubs there for years. The existence of clubs and shops doesn't
really prove anything about the status of the law.


I decided to try to find out what the situation really was. I called
AHA and they said the law is not clear, but that they would
send me some info explaining what they knew about it. (Hopefully
I'll get this soon and it might help explain things a bit---
send me email if you want to know what AHA sends me).


Paul mentioned that his friend's lawyer did not know whether or
not homebrewing was legal, so I decided to call my own lawyer.
He also did not know offhand (I guess the question doesn't come
up too often ;-). He did, of course, offer to research it for
me and is perfectly willing to find the relevant statutes....
if I agree to pay his fee. I declined for now...I'm curious,
but not curious enough to break out the checkbook!


I've also been corresponding by e-mail with Bill Henson
(awchrd2`at`peabody.sct.ucarb.com) who reports that he called
several offices in the state government, including the Attorney
General's office and the Alcoholic Beverage Commission, and
was told that they do not specifically have any law that
prohibits homebrewing, so their offices consider homebrewing
to be legal by the fact that it is not specifically prohibited.


In any case, it sounds to me like there may not be any state
law on the books that specifically allows homebrewing, but that
there's also nothing that specifically bans it. Because the
law is silent on the question (or at least real quiet) it could
be that a cop is within the bounds of reason to think that
laws applying to commercial alcohol producers (especially tax
laws) should apply to homebrew as well. If the state has a law
on the books requiring licenses and tax bonds for any brewery,
but doesn't specifically exempt home brewers, then it certainly
seems like the cop might be justified in thinking that homebrewing
is an illegal activity. Maybe not "justified", but perhaps also
not "ignorant".


In any case, before we bash this cop anymore, we ought to find
out for sure whether *HE* is the ignorant party here, or whether
*WE* are the ones who are ignorant. If anybody finds solid
proof either way, please post.

Agreed that abrasives should not be used.  Agreed that steel wool is
horrible, it will even cause rust to appear on the surface of the SS
because the steel is embedded in the SS and the steel is rusting.


However, I have to disagree about chlorine.  At least over in
rec.crafts.brewing (and I think in HBD also) John Palmer who is a
metallurgist gave an excellent explanation of use of chlorine.


Chlorinated products are safe if you use them in the concentrations
appropriate for sanitization, you do not let them sit in contact with
the SS for extended periods of time (days) and you fill the keg
completely with sanitizer solution.


The problem arises at the top of the liquid where it meets air.  Some
interaction with oxygen goes on right there and nowhere else that
causes the free cholrine concentration to go way up and it then can
indeed pit the SS.


I have been using CTSP on my kegs for a year with no ill effects.  I
use 1 TBS per gallon of hot water, completely fill the keg and leave
it to sit for 20 minutes and then thoruoghly rinse out.


John, care to correct me in any errors?  If you are not on HBD, then I
will forward back into HBD.
