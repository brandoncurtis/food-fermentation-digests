Subject: Steep vs Mash


Hello all,


Specialty grains... mash or steep?  This is about as controversial as
counterflow/immersion chillers.


I recently had the opportunity to set up a full scale experiment and
test the pros and cons of steeping VS mashing specialty grains. I set out
to make up a 10 gallon batch of beer for a block party.  I wanted something
the unenlightened masses would enjoy, so I decided on a simple amber ale.


Recipe follows:


For 10 US Gals Avers Avenue Amber Ale


12 lbs English Lager
 4 lbs Belgium Pale Ale
 6 lbs English Mild (poor crush)
 2 lbs Caramunich


NB = Northern Brewer 9.3%  1/2 oz
KG = Kent Golding 5.0%       2 oz
F  = Fuggle 3.6%             2 oz


Hop Table in ounces


MIN  NB   KG   F
60  1/2
45        1
30        1    1
15            1/2
F             1/2


SG 1.050  FG 1.010


A problem arose with the amount of grain as I do not have the capacity
in my humble homebrewery to mash this much grain at once.  I decided to
split the batch down the middle and brew two batches at once.


After dividing up the grain into both brewpots, I came to the Caramunich.  I
tossed in one pound in the first pot for the mash as usual, and held back
the second pound for the second pot for later steeping.


The first pot was brought up to conversion temperature.  When this was
mashing away, the second pot was brought up to temperature.  The second batch
was allowed to continue to mash during the sparge of the first.  This resulted
in a longer mash time than the first had received due to a longer than
expected sparge.


Once batch 1 was sparged and placed on the stove to boil, batch 2 was sparged.
Batch 1 boiled over slightly and additional bittering hops were added to
compensate for the loss.  Closer monitoring of the pots followed ;-)
During hopping of batch 1 batch 2 was brought to a boil.  The one pound of
caramunich that was reserved for batch 2 was placed in a grain bag and
steeped in 170F water.  It was then "sparged" repeatedly by dunking in hot
clean water until it drained fairly clear.  This "tea" was then added to the
boil pot with the rest of the runnings and brought to a boil.  Batch 2 was
visibly more turbid in the pot than batch 1.  Batch 2 may not have reached
as rigorous of a boil as batch 1 due to the use of a different stove.


Both brews were hopped, and chilled with an immersion chiller.  Batch 2 had
a larger volume by about 1/2 gallon than batch 1.  Specific gravity's
differed by .005.  BRF verified that 1.050 at 5 gals drops to 1.045 with the
addition of 1/2 gallon of water.


Both batches were fermented side by side at a controlled 60F. (Fridge/Airstat
combo) on the trub for 1 week.  Transfer to secondary and fermentation
continued under the same conditions for an additional week.  The beer was
fined with 1/2 tsp gelatin to each carboy for a period of 10 days.


Both batches were kegged and force carbonated.


FG for batch 1 was ~1.010, batch 2 ~1.005.  (Surprise!)  I estimated the
color difference was approximately 1 L difference, and BRF also verified
that.  The main observable difference is a slight haze in batch 2 (steeped)
batch 1 is brilliantly clear.  Flavor difference batch 2 tastes a bit thin,
almost watery, apart from that the flavor is identical.


Conclusions :
I feel that the haze may be a starch haze.  There may have been a bit of
unconverted starch in the caramunich that caused it.  The process of mashing
converted this starch in the mashed batch (batch 1) which resulted in a clear
final product.  There is the possibility that the soft boil batch 2 received
could have attributed to the haze as well by not precipitating the protien
as well as it should.  This haze however did not seem to change with chilling
or warming.


Color/body differences can be attributed to the additional sparge water needed
to steep the specialty malt and the initial difference in volume of the total
wort fermented.  Keeping this in mind, the difference in flavor/color/body was
minimal.


FWIW be it the difference in the body or maybe a better utilization of the
caramunich, I felt that batch 1 was a superior beer.


SO.... IMHO mashing does not appear to affect the contribution from the
caramunich, but may reduce the risk of starch induced haze.  I will continue
to mash the specialty grains.


This of course does not draw any conclusions for the use of black grains.

One of the interesting things I learned while researching "Bock", and 
which I included in the book, is that the folks at Weihenstephan have a 
general recommendation for lautering decoction mashes at a pretty slow 
rate, which is based on the surface area of the lauter tun (assuming a 
uniform depth and a uniform drainage).  By specifying the rate per 
square area, they are really describing a particular flow rate of fluid 
through the bed.  The rate recommended was approximately 1 gallon / (6 
minute * square foot) to start, speeding up to 1/4 as the wort thins 
out.  (I'm quoting from memory, always a dangerous thing.)  These 
figures are quoted from volume 2 of Narziss' "Die Technologie der 
Bierbereitung".  Also, Narziss indicates a shallower bed for decoction 
mashes than Hough et al in "Malting and Brewing Science" do for 
infusion mashes.

It would be interesting to know how their flow rates compare to those 
suggested by Narziss.  One might expect a mixed mash system such as 
Miller/AB/Coors employ to behave more like a straight infusion than a 
decoction, since most (90% or so) of the barley malt husks do not 
undergo boiling.

My dictionary claims that a barrel is 31 1/2 gallons, which is alarming when
you consider that a 1/2 barrel keg holds 15.5 gallons.  I think we're 
getting hosed out of a quart of beer each time we buy a keg (a pint per
1/4 barrel keg).  Is this correct?  Write your congressman.

Subject:  Decoction mashing : thickest portion? 




In references to decoction mashing both here on the net and in published
literature (namely Warner's "German Wheat Beer" and Papazian's "Home
Brewer's Companion"), I've noticed comments to the effect that the
decoction should be taken from the "thickest part of the mash."  I find
this a bit confusing given my (still extremely limited) all-grain
experience.


All of my mashes have been pretty homogenous, or have had at most an
inch of liquid on top of the grain...ie. there's no discernable 'thick'
portion.  I typically use 2.7 L mash water per kg of grain (as per Fix's
"Principles of Brewing Science").  In any case, do you draw off this
'thickest' portion via a spigot at the bottom of the mash tun?  (I use
a picnic cooler as a mash tun, so that would be no problem.)  Otherwise,
if you were just scooping out the mash for your decoction, how would you
get the thickestportion?  What's the reasoning behind using a thick
decoction?


I'm planning on trying to follow Warner's technique for an all-grain
Hefe-Weizen in the next month or so...any suggestions would be
appreciated. I'll post a summary of e-mail responses, so feel free to
reply privately...


BTW, looking up 'decoction' in my Oxford pocket dictionary, it reads:
"boiling down to extract essence; the essence produced."  This seems to
be a bit of a misnomer, doesn't it, since the object of boiling the
drawn-off mash is mainly to re-add it to the main mash and increase its
temperature.  Perhaps in the Old Days, the object of the decoction mash
was to boil it down to concentrate the liquor??


Cheers....CW

 I have been homebrewing for almost 9 months, and just recently got into

 My friend just returned from a summer trip to visit his sister in Chicago
and while there he enjoyed some brew at a few pubs.
 He heard from a owner of a Pub that Samuel Adams is releasing a vary
limited Triple BOCK, 18% STRONG and 75$ bucks a case.
 Maybe I just missed the posts about this brew as I have only be aboard
for 2 weeks.
 Any other information regarding this Triple Bock?

A solution is to remove the poppet valve body during fermentation

bentonite findings: (quickie)- I have just finished comparisons with 
bentonite as a clarifier in racking procedure, I added 1/4 cup of bentonite 
slurry to the fermented beer during racking, then racked to the corny keg 24 
hours later. the beer was an IPA, and It turned out wonderful. It was 
crystal clear as opposed to the 3 quarts of unclarified beer that was hazy 
and cloudy that it was compared against. The clarified beer was cleaner 
tasting, but a little thinner flavorwise, but _very_ delicious nonetheless. 
YMMV.


 ->Corn keg fermenters:
I split my 15 gal master batch into 3 sub batches, one was fermented in a 
corny keg, all I did was loosely cover the latched opening with the rubber 
ringed cover during primary, and then racked to another corny keg that was 
closed, and the gas input valve was held open by a gas out fitting that was 
connected to a fermentation lock. All this during one of the worst fruit fly 
conventions en masse that I have ever seen. All in my basement. All in all I 
was very happy with the results, and i'm now pondering how to use all this 
extra equipment (food grade SS fermenters disguised as dispensing units)that 
I've discovered laying around idle.

Subject: U-Brews and competitions


Though I am personally (and speaking for myself) a staunch HOMEbrewer, I'm
curious about the acceptance of "U-Brew" beers at competitions (AHA and
otherwise). -- For those unfamiliar with the term "U-Brew" stores are
commercial ventures where would-be homebrewers go to brew using on-site
equipment, with the help of on-site staff.


Some might argue that because of the way these stores operate U-Brewers
aren't actually creating their own beer (they are just adding
pre-determined ingredients and being told when to stir.) On the other hand,
is this not the case with beginners using kits? (The difference perhaps is
that U-Brew stores do quite a lot of damage control ... first time brewers
rarely end up with a bad beer ... and consequently they are less likely to
learn from mistakes.)


Can and should U-Brews be entered in competitions? Is there an "official"
line on this? What do those on the Net think?


Kind of curious,

Subject: Re: Dry Hopping/Keg Fermenting 


hollen`at`megatek.com (Dion Hollenbeck) gave some good advice on 
using soda kegs for fermentation.  Let me add a couple twists 
that work well for me.


Dion Says:
"A non-obvious trick is to use liquid dip tubes (these are the 
tubes
attached to the liquid "out" valves - the ones the beer 
actually flows
through when leaving the keg) which are shorter than
standard length so that when you rack, the trub is left 
behind."


I don't cut the dip tube.  I let the trub come throught the 
line first then pour it out once the running becomes clear.  
This avoids wasting beer if the trub level is well below where 
you cut the dip tube.  You do have to muck about more with 
what's supposed to be a closed system.


Dion Says:
"Attach a bleeder valve to the gas valve of the secondary."


I'm too cheap.  I just bleed the pressure off the keg once a 
day.


Dion Says:
"[Bleeder valves] allow one to measure the *real* pressure in a 
keg

applied, not the actual pressure at the destination)."


I'm still too cheap. I turn up the pressure at the regulator 
from zero until I hear gas start to flow.  The regulator 
reading at that point should be just above the keg pressure - 
say 1lb.  Same principle as a blood pressure cuff.

Subject: Re: when to add fruit




First of all it is important to remember that we are homebrewers and
can add fruit whenever we want.  But certainly there are points in the
brewing process that are better that others primarily for sanitation 
reasons.  A number of my friends are brewers and we have formed a
small brewing group.  We get together twice a year on a weekend and
make a planned number of brews (as many as 12 batches and as little
as 6).  Our first fuit beer was a variation of the cherry stout recipe
in Charlie Papazian's New Complete Joy of Homebrewing.  Just before
the recipe we following is a recipe called "Cherries in the Snow".
In "Cherries in the Snow" there is a brief procedure to follow for
adding fruit.  This is what we have mostly followed in all of our 
fruit beers.


> What about soaking the fruit in a mixture of alcohol and
> corn sugar before adding to the primary?  Anybody done this?
> It seems that it would create a syrup with more intense

Most of the time we have added fruit to the end of the boil.  What
I did recently with an apple ale was to chop up 10 lbs of apples and
juice half of that quantity.  I added the apple juice directly to the
boil close to the end of the boil.  I then added the apple chunks 5
minutes before the end of the boil and let it steep for 15 minutes
after boil before transferring the wort into the primary fermenter.
The results were very good.  This will work for both all-grain and
extract recipes. 


Be careful though.  The longer you cook fruit the more it will break
down and the harder it will be to rack the beer into a secondary
fermenter.  This is because the little pieces of fruit in you wort
will clog the racking tube and/or hose. 


Take a look through Papazian's book for "Cherries in the Snow".  It
is an excellent place from which to start.

Subject: Copper Boiler OK to use?


This is my first post to this illustrious group (have mercy!). 
A friend of mine and I are relatively new extract brewers.
We've brewed about 15 batches (all successful so far) since January.


To the point, we have purchased an old copper double boiler at a antique flea
market to hopefully use in our brewing. It needs alot of cleaning but it will
easily hold 5 gallons of water to brew with. It looks like it was probably
plated on the inside with nickel or tin at one time. This is mosltly worn
off.


Whats the consensus on using copper in brewing? I would think it would be ok
to use for the pre-boiling of water, what about copper coming in contact with
the wort? Any reactions when hops are added?


Private email is fine.

Brewing Belgian Beers (#6): Triples


Description:


     1.080-1.095, 7-10% ABV, 18-25 IBU, 3.5-5.5 SRM
     Light or pale color.  Low ester, malt or hop aroma ok.  Low
     hop bitterness or flavor ok.  Malt sweetness in flavor ok. 
     Low esters ok.  Medium to full body.  High carbonation.  No
     diacetyl.  Strength should be evident; alchohol flavor ok. 


Overall this is a strong, very pale beer with a relatively
neutral character.  These beers should have low esters (by
Belgian standards, anyway), and comparatively light body and
flavor for their strength.  Frequently they are somewhat sweet. 
Alchoholic strength should be evident, followed by a subtle mix
of yeast products and hop and malt flavors.  Some commercial
examples are well hopped, but most use hop bitterness sparingly. 
Some spicy (phenol) character is ok.  High carbonation levels are
the norm.




Brewing method:


Standard infusion or step mashing techniques are used, with grain
bills usually consisting only of pilsner malt (or light extract)
and blond sugar.  The comparatively light body is achieved by
substantial additions of sugar in the kettle (several pounds per
5 gallons) and high carbonation.  Hopping levels should be kept
low, with classic varieties preferred.  Some Belgian yeasts may
be too estery or aromatic for these beers, particularly as high
gravity ferments accentuate this.  


One cup of sugar should be used to prime a five gallon batch. 
It's a good idea to add some fresh yeast at bottling time to help
with carbonation; a 1-pint starter is sufficient.


As with all beers of this strength, high pitching rates and good
aeration are a must.  Low fermentation temperatures (65F or
lower) should be used to avoid creation of headache-causing
fusels.


Extract brewers should have no trouble making good triples




Common problems:


1) Solvent flavors.  Fermentation temperature too high, poor
     yeast health (under pitching) or both.


2) Body too full.  Decrease malt and increase sugar portions of
     OG.


3) Insufficient carbonation Increase priming sugar, or add a
     dose of fresh yeast at bottling.




Commerical examples:


Brugse Tripel (9.5% ABV), Affligem Tripel (9% ABV),
Grimbergen Tripel (8.13% ABV), Steenbrugge Tripel (9% ABV)




Sample recipes:


Delano Dugarm's Batch #28 Tripple (Extract recipe for 5
     gallons) ADUGARM`at`WORLDBANK.ORG


3 1.5 kg boxes of Northwest Gold liquid extract
1.5 lbs corn sugar
1.3 oz Hallertau (4%) boiled 60 minutes
0.3 oz Saaz (3%) boiled 60 minutes
0.3 oz Saaz (3%) boild 2 minutes
Wyeast Belgian yeast


OG: About 1.080

I disagree. 


Jack brought up some good points and I think he's entirely right that
the review is totally worthless. Recommendations should have been made,
and without them, the article comes off as incompetent fluff. A *GOOD*
review would have set up some sort of criteria ahead of time and
measured each mill with respect to those criteria. Bar charts could
be done showing graphically how each mill stands up against the
others. Screen tests are an easily measured result. Force needed
to crank handle might be a criterion. Durability and construction
perhaps...cost certainly. Let each mill stand up on its own merits.
I'm sure that Jack's ***MALTMILL*** would do fine in all of the
technical aspects, and the cost factor can be left up to the
buyer to decide if the better performance is worth the additional
cost. 


Bottom line: Zymurgy should be serving the READERS not the
advertisers, and we should have a right to decent reviews.
Right on, Jack!!

  New Brewpub Review (Knoxville, Tennessee)


Well, last night (Aug 17) I had the pleasure of dining at Knoxville's
newest (and only) brewpub, the Smoky Mountain Brewing 
Company. I'll try and give some descriptions, but please pardon 
my knowledge (or lack of) styles.


The brewery and restaurant is located in downtown Knoxville
on Gay Street for those of you that are familiar with the area.
You enter the main floor from the stree entrance and have 
the bar area right in front of you. Seating stretches around
the perimeter. The brewing equipment is right past the bar
toward the back of the building. They've got two copper vessels
about 10 to 12 foot tall. You can actually walk up and touch
them. I didn't talk to anyone from the brewing end of the
business, so I'll end this part right here.


Next, the beer. Last night, they had 3 beers on tap. The first
we tried was the Peach Beer. This was a fruit ale with a very
nice aroma of peach as you raised the glass. The beer itself
almost had a peachy tone to it. I enjoyed the beer, as did my
wife, but my lack of style knowledge shows up here. The 
beer was smooth with a nice head and a very nice peach 
mellow peach taste. The aroma of peach was actually stronger
than the taste.


The second beer was a wheat beer. This was the first wheat
beer I've had and I enjoyed it. Smooth, full bodied would be
how I would describe it.


The last beer was a porter. Very dark, low carbonation with
a mild bite to it. I don't have a reference to compare it
to (Knoxville is a beer wasteland) but it was a winner in
my book.


I also want to mention a bit about the food before this post gets
too long. The menu has an English bent (at least to this
American :-) with such items as "Poacher's Pie", "Toad in a Hole",
and "Lancashire Shepherd's Pie". I tried a dish entitled
"Coat of Arms Chicken" which is marinated and basted with
a Raspberry-Orange Glaze, grilled, and served with a herb
rice. As a side dish, "Welsh Country-Style Cole Slaw" was
served. Very delicious. My wife had a spinach pesto dish 
which was good, but not to different for Knoxville. 


The place is already a success. Since they opened on August
8, without any advertising, they've had dinner waits
of one to two hours. We had to wait a hour to be seated and
another hour before we had all of our food, but worth it.
For those that are interested, from newspaper and other
places, the proprieters invested something like 1.5 million
in the business including buying their building, remodeling,
brewing equipment, etc.


If you come throught Knoxville, give it a try.

Subject: Irish Moss / Straining / Filtering


Neophyte Stupid Question #42:


When using Irish Moss as a clarifying agent, should the wort be strained? Is a
kitchen strainer sufficient, or should something more fine like a juice strainer
or coffee filter?


My last batch (#3) was the first in which I tried Irish Moss. My buddy and I
figured that if we strained it out it wouldn't work, so we just dumped it into
the primary fermenter (plastic). I just racked it into the secondary (glass) and
there was a lot of clumps of hops etc. I tried to avoid sucking it up, but some
innevitably got through.


Now I am thinking of running it through a coffee filter when racking from the 
secondary to the bottling bucket. Good idea?


Comments can be sent directly to me and I will summarize as best I can.

From: gjfix`at`utamat.uta.edu (George J Fix)
Subject: Yield


I have found that the two most important operational variables affecting
yield are the mash pH and the time/temperature program used.


For infusion mashes I have found that it is highly advantageous to keep
the mash pH at 5.4 or lower. Decoction mashes appear to be more forgiving
in this regard. The negative effects of a high mash (and wort) pH are
numerous, and I plan to treat this subject in great detail in my new book.


It appears that yield (which is a measure of the extent we dissolve grain
carbs.) is strongly influenced by the lower temperatures used, while the
composition of the carbohydrates dissolved (i.e., % fermentability) is
influenced by the higher temperatures. The following batch is typical of
the results I have been getting with highly modified malt.


   Data
         brew size = 15.5 gals
         total water = 9.5 gals in mash + 9.5 gals for sparging
         grain bill : 24 lbs. D-C Pale Ale malt
                       2 lbs. D-C Caravienne
                       1 lb.  D-C Aromatic


   Temperature Program


         40C (104F) - 30 mins.- 24 lbs. base malt + 6.5 gals. water
         
         Transition 40 to 60C - add 3 gals. of boiling water - add 
             adjunct malts at the end as a brake - less than 5 mins.
             is needed


          Note - I now feel (with Narziss) that the time spent in the
             range 45-55C should be keep below 15 mins. if highly
             modified malt is used.


          60C (140F) - 30 mins.


          Transition 60 to 70C - external heat is needed and this can 
             be done in 15 mins.


          70C (158F) - 30 mins.


   Mash Data
 
          Vol = 9.5 gals.
          % extract = 22P (i.e., 22 grms extract per 100 grams mash)
          SG =1.092


   Converting to wt/vol and US units the % extract comes out to 62.24
   lbs/bbl. (~2 lbs/gal). This means that the mash has
 
          62.24*9.5/31 = 19.1 lbs. extract.


   Yield in commercial units is 


          19.1 * 100/27 = 70.7%.


   Yield in homebrew units is


          92 *9.5 /27 = 32.3 pts/(lbs/gal).


   The value of the rest at 40C can not be understated. The rise in SG
   in this mash is almost 3 times faster than what I get when this rest
   is omitted. The final mash yield is ~20 % higher. Clearly there
   is a lot of favorable activity going on including preparation of the
   enzyme systems, beta glucanase activity, and highly favorable enzymatically
   assisted grain liquefaction.


   This wort clears up very quickly (for European malts), and after ~2 gals.
   of recirculation it will change from a milkly turbidity to a moderate see
   through clarity. The 1st wort is then run into the kettle until 1 inch of
   liquid covers the grain surface. At this point sparging is started
   with the inflow and outflow rates adjusted to ~1/3 gals/min. It is of course
   very important to maintain the liquid cover of the grain bed. After ~30
   mins. the sparge water is depleted, and the outflow is increased to
    ~1 gal/min. The following is typical data at kettle full:


                   Vol = 17 gals.
                   % extract = 12.3 P
                   SG = 1.050.


    Repeating the above calculations, this means that 18.3 lbs. of extract
    was carried over to the kettle. The losses in sparging were


                   water = 19 -17 = 2 gals.
                   extract = 19.1 -18.3 =.8 lbs.


     By using a slower runoff and a higher fraction of sparge water it is
     likely one could leach most of the residual extract out of the grains.
     I choose not to do this because this is not the way I brew. The finished
     wort in the fermenter typically cames out as follows:


                   Vol = 15.5 gals. 
                   % extract = 13.3 P
                   SG =1.053
  
      This means that a final yield of 30.4 pts was obtained. With a single
      temperature mash (or 60-70 combo) this would have dropped into the
      26-28 pts/(lbs/gal) range.


      The % fermentability as determined by a liter sized forced fermentation
      at 30C usually gives an ADF near 79% (RDF = 65%). This means that
      FG limit is 1.011. The ale strain that I am using does not completely
      ferment maltotriose, so I usually wind up a 1.012 to 1.013 in this 
      context. The ADF is greatly influenced by the times spent at 60 and
      70C. E.g., 15 mins. at 60 followed by 45 mins at 70 will typically
      drop the ADF into the low 70s. The reverse will increase it into the
      mid 80s. For my ale strain spending at least 15 mins. at 60C is
      crucial for it greatly increases the maltose/maltotriose ratio.


      I strongly prefer moderately modified malt for lager beer, and I have
      found that a protein rest at 50C (122F) has numerous advantages. I have
      done test brews with a 40-50-60-70 schedule, but little is gained in 
      yield over a 50-60-70 program. I personally am going to stick with the
      latter since among other things half of the 3 gals of transition
      water can be used to go from 50 to 60, while the other half can be
      used to go from 60 to 70. Thus very little external heat need be
      applied to the mash. Another point I have noticed is that most lager
      yeast are insensitive to maltose/ maltotriose ratios. W-34/70 for
      example starts taking in maltotriose at the same time it takes in
      maltose, and metabolizes both sugars at approximately the same rate.
      Thus the rest at 60C can be used with such strains simply to adjust
      ADF.

Howdy.


Does anyone know of a good supplier of that *beautiful* slotted screen for
a lauter tun ? You know, that stainless v-wire type screen. I am looking to
upgrade from the old perforated screens.

Hey! I went to BBBU ! Is this some sort of crack ???


I suggest moving this to alt.flame.gigantic-sigs. I usually draw the line 
when a sig takes up more than one screenful. Other than that, a sig is part
of a persons net-personality. We can't like everyone we meet. Life is harsh
(particularly when you have to pay for your feed, eh?)


Moving on,
