 > For my money, the Maltmill is the best of the three I've owned, though I'm 
 annoyed at having to pay for 10-inch rollers when the hopper makes the 
 effective length only about 4 inches (I assume it would be too difficult to 
 turn the thing if the entire length was used).
 
 Your last statement is correct but the premise is a common misconception 
 about the MM and it is very simple to dis-prove.
 
 Just remove the hopper and hold it over a bucket.  Pour a pound of malt into 
 the hopper and see how long it takes to flow through the grain guides.  You 
 will find that on the current models (aprox 1 1/4 x 3/4), it flows at the 
 rate of 400 lbs per hour.  The opening only restricts the amount of grain 
 that lands on the rollers when the hopper is initially filled for the reason 
 you mentioned.  It is presumed that one will crank until the hopper is empty 
 and then stop to fill it agian.  It has no effect on the throughput up to 400 
 lbs per hour.  This is about the max rate it can crush at a reasonable RPM, 
 when it will indeed utilize the entire roller length.
 
 Just for reference, the  MM II has an opening of a 2" diameter circle and it 
 crushes at the rate of 4000 lbs per hour with a 1.5 HP motor.  With smaller 
 motors, the opening must be reduced.  It is truly amazing how fast grain can 
 flow through a small opening.

Subject: Going to Portland/Re: When to add fruit


Hello All,


I am going to Portland, OR in mid-September and was wondering if anyone had
some suggestions about brew-pubs/ micro-breweries that I should seek out.


> What about soaking the fruit in a mixture of alcohol and
> corn sugar before adding to the primary?  Anybody done this?

I bought a juice-extractor/steamer-cooker called a Mehu-Maija. It is
basically a three level device with a pan for boiling water on the bottom, a
juice collecting pan above that and a strainer on top to hold the fruit. This
device uses steam to extract the juice of the fruit. For example, when I make
a blackberry beer, I load the fruit into the Mehu-Maija and let it boil for
about a half an hour. The resulting juice is sterilized by the heat and yet
clear (getting a pectin haze has not been a problem with any fruit I have
used so far). I originally thought that the juice would just be watered down,
condensed steam, but it turns out that the juice is very fruity. You can add
this at anytime to the fermentation. The best part about it is that it is
very easy to bottle the sterile juice in a beer or champagne bottle to save
for later brewings. If you are really into fruit beers, this thing is
something that helps alot.

Subject: Comparison of Wyeast #1098 & #1968/Summary of Holiday Brew Advice


Here's the final results of my comparison between Wyeast's British Ale 
and London ESB Ale yeasts.


For those of you just tuning in, last month I cooked up a 
straight-forward pale ale (90/10 pale malt/crystal malt with Fuggles 
hops).  I split the batch in half, pitched one half with British Ale 
yeast and the other with London ESB.  I then fermented the batches under 
identical conditions -- namely, sitting side-by-side in my basement.  OG 
was 1.054.


Primary fermentation lasted 3 days at 68 degrees F.  Both batches started 
burping quickly, although the British ale batch burped at a greater rate 
than the ESB batch.  On day 2 of primary, the British batch was still 
burping strong while the ESB batch sat silent.  The ESB yeast had 
completely floc'd out of solution.  I swirled the ESB batch a few times 
during over the next day, but it remained silent.  At racking time, the 
British ale was still burping.  The British SG was 1.014, the ESB SG 
1.022.


Day 1 of secondary found the situation reversed; the ESB was now giving 
about 1 burp per minute while the British sat quiet.  The batches sat in 
the secondary for 14 days.  At bottling, both SG's were 1.008.


After three weeks in the bottle, my wife and I had a mini blind tasting.  
We poured three glasses for the other -- two of one batch, one of the 
other.  The taster only had to identify which glass was different from 
the other two.  The first round was very easy -- the ESB has a _very_ 
floral aroma.  On the second round, we didn't allow ourselves to sniff 
for aroma; we concentrated on taste.  In this round, we were again
successful in identifying the unique glass.  My wife said that the British 
batch tasted "flatter" than the ESB batch.  I felt that the ESB batch has a 
sharper taste while the British batch has a blander taste, but with a fuller 
body, more mouth feel.


I found this exercise to be very worthwhile.  It was very interesting to 
taste the differences between yeast strains.

On a different note, 
As someone mentioned in a previous digest, it is getting to be the time 
to start thinking about holiday brews.  Would some THREAD guru volunteer 
to spelunk through some past HBD's and post the summarized wisdom?  I 
would do it myself except for:  1)  I can't seem to get THREAD to read 
more than one HBD file, even when I wildcard and; 2)  I'm traveling on 
business all next week and won't even see my computer until next weekend.

receiving.  Do you think it's relevant?  What are the professors like?  Is Dr
Lewis (to take a well known example) a good lecturer?  Does he, as the common
criticism goes, focus too much on Budweiser?  What are the curricula biased
towards: practical or scientific?  How many people are in the programs?  Does
Heriot-Watt lean towards ales? or Siebel towards lagers? or is it even an
issue?  How difficult is the AME?  What percent of graduates pass it?  What
are the job prospects like?  Does becoming an Associate Member of the IOB make
a huge difference, as far as finding employment is concerned?  Do breweries
actively recruit at any of these schools?  What is life like at these
institutions?  What is the demographic makeup of the student body?


&c, &c, &c.  You get the picture.  In short, if anyone associated with Siebel,
UC Davis or Heriot-Watt can supply me with any information about what it's
like at the schools, I would be extraordinarily grateful.

     Chill haze is one form of protein haze and is the result of an
excess of undegraded proteins or permanently soluble nitrogen in the
beer. This could possibly be an indication of poor malt or it could be
as a result of your techniques. The boiling stage is the point where
proteins should be being dealt with. I boil vigorously for two hours
and also use Irish Moss which helps precipitate proteins from the wort.
Also, forced cooling after the boil helps more proteins precipitate out.
Protein hazes, in general, will not disappear over time in the way that
yeast etc. will settle out of a beer during conditioning. It is possible
to help clear protein hazes with auxilliary finings (not the same as
normal finings) but it shouldn't be neccessary if a good boil is done
and if Irish Moss is used during the boil. All ales will show protein
haze to an extent if chilled excessively - you mention chilling to 34F
which will only make the haze worse. Us Brits. are often considered
strange by people from the US because we drink our beers relatively
warm - if you're chilling your Pale Ales too much then you may never
be free of protein hazes unless you use aux. finings - not my personal
choice. Protein hazes only effect the look of the beer - they do not
effect the taste or stability. When I worked in a pub, if people made
comments about hazes on the ales, our standard reply was "What do you
want to do? Read your newspaper through it?". I know some people have
problems with beer that isn't crystal clear - I don't and actually
consider absolute clarity as being false. If I do get a slight haze
on my beers, I just explain the science to my friends and point out
that its not a problem and wont cause upset stomachs etc. They're
normally happy with this - especially after they taste it!
Cheers,
     Brian

Subject: Yeast Lab's London Ale Liquid Yeast




     Has anyone any comments on this yeast? I bought some on
Saturday afternoon and made a starter culture as per the
instructions. It says that activity should be expected at 12
hours and that it should be ready for use at 12-24 hours. On
Sunday morning when starting to brew there was absolutely no
activity in the starter bottle (18 hours after making the
starter). After making the brew and cooling the wort, there
was only a very small amount of activity (29 hours after
making the starter). I considered the activity to be just
enough to allow pitching and figured that as it had slowly
been picking up over the previous few hours that it should
be OK. It was pitched at 9pm last night and at 8am this
morning there was not much in the way of any activity in the
beer. Is this a poor quality yeast or have I just got a duff
batch? I used the same methods as for my last 8 batches of
brew which have all been successful. At this rate, I shall
go back to using dried packet yeasts - I've had no problems
with them.
Cheers,
     Brian

Thanks for the humor attempt.  I know that these types of requests are 
annoying, but as someone who succumbs to *making* them and *answering* them 
from time to time, let me answer seriously (sure).


Ideally, from my point of view, each post would say:


"I looked in the publist on sierra and found three brewpubs in Main City, 
State.  I would appreciate first-hand info on newer brewpubs not in the list 
as well as these three, since I will only have time to visit two of them.  I 
will not summarize to the Digest, but will provide summaries to those who ask 
for them, since this localized information is not of general interest."


I heartily thank all those who have given me info and mention a couple of 
reasons why a phone book and even a publist is insufficient.


1) I don't have access to a phone book from that far away (OK, one of the 
larger libraries in the area should have it, but I'm lazy).  The long-distance
operators prefer a name to "any brewpubs in the general vicinity".


2) I don't know the geography.  When I went to San Diego, I could look up the 
San Diego brewpubs, but needed local help to find out that La Jolla, Pacific 
Beach, Del Mar, and other such locations are actually part of San Diego.  


3) I may be traveling with my family or by myself and appreciate comments like
"that place has good beer, but I wouldn't take my kids" or "it's a yuppy 
hangout" (in which case my father-in-law would probably appreciate going there
with me).

1)  Coyote - boric acid will kill your plants.  As with all else, the 
dose makes the poison.  Baits are usually the best method of long-term 
ant control.  Ants generally fall into two groups, trophically speaking.
Some prefer sugars and carbos, some prefer lipids and proteins.  Yours
may be ffeding on sap (sugars) or perhaps oils from the hop plants (which
is kinda neat, in my entomological opinion - hophead ants).  Find a sugar-
based bait (Drax, etc.) or an oil-based one (Amdro, Logic, etc.) and feed 
'em their last meal.  P.S.  Any ant that eats the bait will be affected - 
don't know if you are concerned about preserving the local ant fauna...


2) Glenace - track down your local chemical or pesticide-supply outfit and
buy a set of large Viton or barrier-laminate chemical-resistant gloves.  
Put your hops in 'em, fold the glove over a few time, and clothes-pin it 
shut.  (I am assuming that you don't have TONS of hops in the freezer.)
That's the cheapest way to buy high-tech chemical-resistant materials.  You
may also be able to find larger pouches made of the stuff used for storing
respirators, emergency gear, etc, in contaminated environments (i.e. they'll
keep emergency gear in a viton bag in a compartment on cropdusters, tractors,
etc.)  Sorry I don't have a source readily at hand.


All - apologies for taking up space.  I don't have access to commercial

My fellow brewers,


      A small request from a new brewer who has benefitted immensely from this
learned group and loves to read the discussions of various technical issues.
I am  severly chemically-challenged and frequently must rely on the conclusions 
of the poster.  Sometimes there is enough noise to weigh the issue on the 
volume of support, but often not.  At the risk of inviting horn-tooting, 
perhaps highly technical posts could be prefaced by the writers credentials.  
Mind you, I don't solicit a CV, but rather a brief introduction.  This would 
help those of us who want to make better beer and become better informed,but 
have difficulty deciding who to listen more closely to.


     If this request is way off base then feel free to flame me into charcoal, 
but kindly do in my mail box (you can't overfill my box) and not on HBD.  As 
usual if there is enough spirited response i will summarize.  Any similarly 
challenged folks who concur please tell me.


Steve

I am looking into brewing an English Ale, and want to keep it within the

I don't have the frig space or equipment for cooling the fermentation,

temps) as well as Wyeast 2112.   These are both supposed to be "California
lager yeasts"?   I haven't been able to find either locally but did find
a California Lager yeast L35.  Are ALL California lager yeast warmer

Subject: Aluminum pots


Nothing like beating a dead horse, but...


        A couple years ago, back in college, one of my roommates made some
pasta sauce in an aluminum pot, we ate about half, and then let the remaning
parts "rest" in the pot for about 2 weeks.  We only noticed becaus of the 
little red dots that we kept finding in the fridge (where it was stored).
When we finally took it out to clean it (it was kinda green) we noticed about
a dozen BB sized holes (and more smaller ones) in the pot!  The tomatoes had
eaten the aluminum to the point that it had gone through the sides!
        Now I'll bet that tomato sauce is more acidic than wort, but I also 
know that wort-boiling temps are way higher than those in that fridge. The
result of this is that you can (will?) end up with aluminum in your beer. Is
it a health risk?  I'm not the person to ask, but I've SEEN the stuff 
dissolved into an acidic solution at refrigerator temps, so I'd bet it'd do 
the same (if not better) at boiling.

From: Larry Bristol <LBRISTOL`at`SYSUBMC.BMC.COM>
Subject:      Fuller's ESB Clone


In a recent HBD, Chuck Mryglot requested recipes for cloning Fuller's
ESB.  My email bounced so I decided to post my recipe publicly.


 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Fuller's ESB is by far and away my favorite (commercial) beer, and it has
always been a high priority with me to find a way to clone it.  Several
attempts have brought forth some very pleasing beers, but they never
quite matched up to the taste of the commercial variety.


Until the most recent attempt, that is!  I think I have a very close
clone on tap right now.  I keg rather than bottle, and I am comparing
this brew to the draught Fuller's that is available in the Houston area;
I would suspect (hope, anyway) that the same recipe, if bottled, would be
comparable to the bottled Fuller's ESB species.


All-grain recipe for 5 US gallons:


     12#   British pale ale malt     1oz Centennial hops (11.2% AA)
      1.5# British light carapils    1oz British fuggles (4.0% AA)
      1#   British medium crystal   0.25oz Kent Goldings (5.2% AA)


    1/3 oz Burton water salts (treatment for very soft water)
           Wyeast #1968 (London ESB)


Mash at 154F (high temp to promote dextrins) for 60 mins or until starch
test negative.  Sparge to collect 6 gallons.  Boil for 20 minutes before
hop addition.  Boil centennials for 60 mins; add fuggles when 15 mins
remain; goldings for dry hopping in secondary.  I calculate the hop
rate at 12.2 HBU.


Incidentally, I am just about 125% sure that Fuller's does *NOT* use
centennials in their ESB.  This recipe is not an attempt to duplicate
their processing or ingredients, just the flavor of the finished product.
So no flames about how this could not possibly be an authentic recipe,
please! <g>  A reasonable substitute (and probably closer to reality)
would be to use all fuggles (about 2.75 oz for equivalent bittering).


I got the following vital statistics:
     O.G. - 1.060
     R.G. - 1.018 (after 3 days in primary at 72F)
     F.G. - 1.016 (30 days in secondary at 72F)
I kegged and force carbonated at 8psi/40F, tapping after 18 days.  At
first, I was concerned that the dry hops had given it too much of a hop
character, certainly more than present on the target.  But after a few
more days, the hops had blended and softened quite a bit and seems to .
be about right.  If anything is wrong with the recipe, I think it gives
a bit more body than Fuller's, so I will probably cut back slightly (maybe
reduce the carapils from 1.5# to only 1#) next time.


I think the main reason this recipe seems to have worked as well as it
did has to be attributed to the Wyeast #1968.  According to some rumors
I have heard, this actually *IS* Fuller's yeast!  I don't know about that,
but it certainly has aromas and properties that remind me of Fuller's
during the fermentation process.  It certainly smelled like Fuller's ESB
at racking and at kegging!  I have subsequently learned that it is most
probably a derivative of their yeast, but not exactly the same thing they
use.  Another local homebrewer claims to have a source for the "real thing"
which I hope to try out on the next batch.


I would love to hear about any other recipes you get, and also about the
results you get with this or any other recipes!


HAPPY BREWING!

I just picked up 2 lbs of Lyles treacle from a specialty store that is
going out of business locally.  I generally brew IPA's and brown ales and
don't really know what to do with it, although I love most styles - I guess
I've just been in a rut......  Any extract based suggestions?


Also, I just had my first taste of Old Peculiar and Caledonia Double dark
ale, and said YUM! many times for each of these. I loved the apple note
(for lack of a better term) in the Peculiar (how can I duplicate this - DANG
it's good!) and taste of what I think is brown sugar, molassass (or is it
treacle!) in the Caledonia. Any extract based recipie suggestions for these?

I went there over the July 4th weekend.  They had a Black Cherry Kriek, a

selection frequently.  They have a sampler available (I didn't see it in the
menu) which gives you a taste of each without ordering a full mug of each. 
They are located on Hwy 321 (122 Blowing Rock Rd.-(704) 264-7111) across the
street from Appalachian State College at the northwest end of what appears to
be the main business/tourist district.  I asked if I could see their brewing

Subject: Sparge volume, bananas in weizen


 From *Jeff* Renner 
 
Lowell Hart has a problem with "leaving a lot of sugar on the grain" after 
he has sparged enough volume.  He doesn't want to throw all of that out, and 
wonders how to get more of the sugar in the first runnings.  Lowell, I think 
the solution (no pun) to your problem will become apparent if you look at it 
differently.  You have too much grain!  Your rate of extraction is very 
good, so your recipe is good for maybe six gallons of wort, not five.  Cut 
down on your grain bill (and maybe hops) until you have the amount of sparge 
you want at the appropriate gravity, making sure that your final runnings 
stay below pH 5.8 or so and are about SG 1.006 or 8. 
 
JohnNewYrk doesn't like bananas in his weizen.  Neither do I.  You've 
already suggested three good changes that should work, higher pitching rate, 
proper wort aeration and cutting your fermentation temp from the low 70s to 
the low 60s.  Your procedure has optimized bananas, as well as the higher 
alcohols (fusels), which cause headaches.  Use a good weizen yeast (single 
strain YeastLab or Wyeast), make a starter, then aerate and ferment 10 
degrees cooler.  It's worked well for me.

Subject:  dishwasher sanitation/yeast starter


Could anyone out there with experience and success in cleaning or
sanitizing bottles in a dishwasher share the technique?  While giving
this a little thought over the last few days I've pondered a couple
of questions:  Will Cascade (the soap, not the hops) and my
dishwasher set on "extra hot" do the trick?  Should I soak bottles in
a bleach solution beforehand and rinse and drip-dry in the dishwasher
afterward?  Can I use bleach in the dishwasher as a sanitizer or does
hot water eliminate the sanitizing qualities of the bleach (or is
there another sanitizing agent that works well with hot water)?  Or,
should I take my laboriously collected bottle supply (entailed
dedicated and exhaustive consumption efforts) to the recycling center
and buy a keg set-up?  I don't sense much interest out there so a
private e-mail response is fine.  


Regarding yeast starters, I used a 1-qt. starter for the first time
with my last batch and the reduced lag time over pitching just the
Wyeast packet volume has sold me on the necessity of starters.  My
question is:  Should I use the starter at high kraeusen (about 24
hrs. after I pitched) and pitch the entire 1 qt. volume into the wort
(this is what I did with my last beer) or should I wait until the
yeast has settled out of suspension, pour off the liquid and just
pitch the yeast slurry?  Will my lag times be similar with either
method?  Patiently awaiting a response. . .

could use a bit of clarification.


In HBD #1506, I said:

Note that these values are flow rate coefficients.  So, 0.18 gal/ ft^2 
min (for example) must be multiplied by your lauter tun's cross section 
to get a recommend flow rate.  If you are using a Sankey keg for a 
lauter tun, it has a diameter of 16 inches => 1.4 ft^2 of cross 
sectional area.  Therefore, an initial outflow rate should be about 1.4 
ft^2 * 0.18 gal/ft^2 min = 0.25 gal/min.  If you used this one rate for 
the entire lautering, of say 15 gallons, then it would take 15 gal / 
(0.25 gal/min) => 60 min, or 1 hour.


If you have any questions about this, please feel free to mail to me.  
Thanks, and sorry for any confusion.

Subject: Learning Tastes in Beer Follow-up


Hello, All!


I asked a question a few weeks ago about how to learn
about the tastes in beer.  I mentioned a couple of
examples, namely phenols and fusel alcohols.  I got a
reply from Spencer Thomas with suggestions for these two
tastes.  Unfortunately, his was the only reply I recieved.
It was very helpful, but I was hoping
for something that addressed many of the tastes one finds in
beer.  I looked at the BJCP study guide, but that was more
greared to refreshing one's memory.  If anyone knows of a
good way to go about learing these tastes, I would appreciate
any suggestions.

Do you think I should dry hop this batch?


Thanks in advance...   Jeff
