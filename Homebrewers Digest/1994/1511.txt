I think that is an interesting idea. The problem you might have is

There are already several local/regional homebrew competitions in the UK
and a national one. The national one (1992 in Weston-super-mare, 1993
Blackpool, 1994 Scarborough, 1995 North Wales are the recent ones) is
organised by the National Association of Wine and Beer Makers (NAWB for
short) which this year attracted around 3500 bottles of wine plus 1000
bottles of beer. As you see, the organisation is both wine and beer with a
heavy bias in numbers on the wine side, but the beer entries are not
trivial and the standard is very high. 


The bias towards wine is also reflected in the qualified judges in the UK.
The National Guild of Wine and Beer Judges (NGWBJ) has around 300 members
of which around 50 are beer judges (the others being wine judges) and
membership is by examination. Most amateur wine and beer competitions in
England are judged by members of this Guild.


Both these organisations produce quarterly newsletters which could provide
a means of reaching an audience of interested people.


There are differences between NGWBJ and BJCP. NGWBJ has no links with 
commercial or professional organisations. A pity perhaps, but when these
groups were being set up in the 60s the commercial boys weren't interested.
The beer judge exam consists of two parts, both of which must be passed to
qualify. The first is 'Handbook and Theory' where you are examined on
knowledge of beer making and on judging procedures and beer styles. It is
an oral test not written. I don't think (but can't say for certain) that 
this part is as stringent as the BJCP one, particularly as we only concern
ourselves with the beer styles usually made in England (ie no tripples,
bocks, lambics etc.). The second part, taken a month or so later, is a 
palate test and consists of judging 2 sets of nine beers in a set time. For
example you might be asked first to judge 9 bitters, then 9 dry stouts. Your
marks and remarks need to align pretty well with those agreed by a panel of
four (usually four) experienced judges who will have pre-tasted them. This is
felt by most people to be the most difficult part - a lot of emphasis is put
on this 'ability to judge' part rather than on 'book knowledge'. The NGWBJ
doesn't have different grades of judges, such as 'certified' or 'national'.


If any UK HBDers are interested in entering one of the regional competitions
then send me an email and I'll see if I can find an up-coming one in your
area (if you let me know roughly where you live).

Has anyone compiled all of the Belgian beer postings that have appeared 
recently?  My e-mail system makes it really difficult to cut and paste 
things together, so I was wondering if someone could e-mail me a copy.  
BTW, I asked the author and he's too busy at the moment.

  Greetings and carbonations,
  
  I've had a half-barrel keg with the top cut out for some time now and I'm 
  getting ready to put it into service.  I'll need an outdoor cooker for 
  brewing in this kettle which brings me to my question.  Are there any 
  cookers available upon which these converted kegs will sit safely.  I've 
  been eyeballing a few at the local hardware stores (Home Depot, Lowe's, 
  etc.) and they look like the support ring is about the same diameter as the 
  base of the keg.  Not a pleasant thought when the kettle is filled with 
  boiling wort.  If none of the commercially available units are large enough 
  to safely support these kettles, how do those of you who use them get 
  around this?  Also, will I need a special drill bit to drill this puppy 
  (stainless) and install an Easymasher?  Email is fine and I'll summarize if 
  there is any interest.
  Thanks!

OK, have scrounged up old fridge (ghastly avocado-green, w/ dent in door) 
from chain-smoking appalachian road-dog living in trailer.  (husband threw 
her head-first into door - fridge got worst of it but still works.  she
doesn't...)  Now I need a thermostat.  any recommendations?  sources?  
hints and how-tos?


also, has anyone ever tried removing the heat exchanger and relocating it 
outside of the living space to get rid of the heat?  seems foolish to be 
running the AC to counteract the fridge if I could just relocate coils
to crawlspace, replace w/ subterranean cooling coil, etc.

Subject: AHA and ignorance of homebrewing's legality






Does anyone know if the AHA is active in lobbying efforts to change state
        laws against homebrewing and in combating general ignorance of 
        homebrewing's legality (as recently exhibited in the Shepardstown WV
        incident)?  If the AHA is not currently doing this, could it be 
        recommended to the Association that it become active in this?  I,
        for one, would be willing to pay more in dues to help fellow 
        homebrewers living in `less enlightened' states.


        Just imagine, the AHA becoming a major political player a la
        the NRA.  The idea brings a smile to my face.


Also, if Charlie P. is still reading the HBD (in spite of all the idiots 
        who got their rocks off by flaming him a couple months back),
        could _Zymurgy_ investigate the Shepardstown story and try to put
        some media pressure on the Shepardstown P.D.?

Thanks to everyone who sent me info on Tumbleweed and Charlotte brewpubs.=
  I didn't make it down to Charlotte, but I did get to visit Tumbleweed.=
  I was very impressed!  Their extract-based beers blow a lot of=
 all-grain brewpub beers I've had right out of the water!  Their=
 amber was especially good.  The mixture of Centennial, Hallertauer,=
 Cascade, and Perle hops made for a nicely hoppy (although not _overly_=
 hoppy) beer with a beautiful hop nose.  Their stout was a tad sweet=
 for me, but had a nice lingering, roasty finish.  They had just=
 run out of the kriek they had been serving, but the raspberry ale=
 they replaced it with was really nice (good berry character from=
 nose to finish).


On my way down to NC, I stopped by another brewpub called Richbrau,=
 located in the Shockhoe Slip area of Richmond, VA.  They had good=
 food (really spicy red beans and rice), and their Old Nick Pale=
 Ale was nice and malty.  Their brown ale was okay and the Queen's=
 Sour (sour mash) didn't taste all that sour to me (although, I'm=
 thinking red beans and rice might not be the best food to sample=
 beer with :->  I'm hoping that I'll be able to get a tour of the=
 brewery on my next visit.

Subject: Celis White Clone and Cleaning Brushed Stainless Steel Oven tops


My wife and I just tried out first bottles of Celis White last night and we 
are in love!!!  Does anyone have an extract/specialty grain recipe which 
approximates this grand brew?  I found a couple of all-grains in the HBD 
archives, but if someone had a tried and true recipe I would love to have it.


And


Does anyone have a good method for cleaning brushed(?) steel stove top?  Ours 
has picked up an innumerable amount of stains ( maybe from brewing - who 
knows?) - both food and what appear to be black stains from heat.  I have 
tried lots of things to try and clean this top: commercial stainless steel 
cleaner, comet, steel wool, etc.  Nothing has worked at all.  Can anyone 
suggest something that will clean this stove top?


If I get a lot of responses I will post a summary.


TIA

I found the yield posting by George Fix very interesting.  However, I wonder
if someone (George?) could clarify something for me.


At the end of the post is:

    The example given in the post was a 40-60-70 schedule with a comment to 
    minimize the time in the 45-55 range.    In the above snipet the 50-60-70
    schedule is recommended.  Is there some contradiction here? and/or am
    I misunderstanding.... (won't be the first time...).  Also, if I use
    the 50-60-70 schedule, should I rest at 50 for 30 minutes (as a replacement
    for the 40 in the example)  or should I stay under 15 minutes as noted.


    Or is this the difference for highly vs moderately modified malt.

Subject: Yakimania '94, the story continues


The tours.


1) Roy Farms.
Farming is big business. Don't let people tell 
you otherwise. Maintaining 700 acres of thirsty 
and prolific hops is a job. In Yakima, the work 
force is mainly of Hispanic descent. It was very 
strange to see the faces of the workers 
watching the faces of the visitors. We were on 
holiday. They had just started the harvest the 
night before. They would be doing 12 hours on 
12 hours off in hot, noisy, and un-safe 
conditions for the next 6 weeks. We were on 
vacation.
Hop plants are grown on 18 foot trellised 
vines. The 700 acres of plants take 3 acre feet 
of water per year. (Thirsty little buggers...) 
One acre of plants will yield between 700 and 
2200 lbs of hops, depending on the variety 
grown, as well as the growing conditions. At 
harvest time, trucks drive down the lines of 
vines, with workers on elevated platforms 
cutting the string and hops at the tops of the 
trellis, and other workers cutting the vines 
about 3 feet from the ground. (This is not the 
healthiest thing for the plants, as the plant is 
still alive, and uses energy stored in the stalk 
for energy. For growers at home, the advice 
was to leave the vine attached to the ground, 
and pick off the flower cones individually. This 
process is for automated flower strippers...) 
The vines are stacked in a truck bed with tall 
sides, the bases of the vines lined up evenly at 
the front of the bed. When the truck is full, it 
drives to the stripping point. In England, 
people would stream out of the cities to hand 
pick the cones, having a working vacation in 
the country. Very labor intensive, but there 
was no machienery to do it. When machines 
were invented, they were portable devices that 
were taken to the field where the hops were. 
Now the hops are brought to the stripping 
machines that are bigger than houses (well, 
not my house, but most peoples houses), and 
noisier than day care centers. The vines are 
hung on hooks by their bases, and held 
between rapidly rotating rows of stripper 
fingers (cheesy ASCII graphics ON!)

|                        |


(Man, that looks bad...) The fingers are 
spaced, and the spacing is adjusted so that the 
optimum strip is made. The flower cones are 
what are desired, but most of the leaves are 
stripped too. Later stages in the process 
function to blow away the lighter and more 
aerodynamic leaves from the stream of cones 
leaving the stripper. A good delivered product 
contains less than 2% leaves and stems. This 
fraction is policed by the State of Washington, 
and paid for by heavy taxes on the hop 
growers just for that purpose. The leaves, the 
vines, and the twine that supported the vines 
are sent to a chopper, piled up, partially 
composted, and put back into the fields. On 
the subject of organic gardening, there is a 
minimum of herbicide used, as the hop vines 
are sufficiently tall to compete with the 
relatively short weeds that are allowed to grow 
around the plants. Drip system irrigation is 
more efficient at watering the plants than 
sprinklers. If weeds are deemed a problem, a 
tractor simply disks the little buggers under. 
For smaller operations, we talked about goats 
as weeders. They would eat the weeds and the 
lower leaves of the vines, as well as supplying 
their own fertilizer. The feds heard about this 
(Animal feces in contact with crop plants? No 
way!!!) and shut that operation down. The 
flowers are conveyered to the kilning building, 
where the cones are kept heated to 130-135 
degrees F for 8-10 hours, where the moisture 
content is driven from high (80%? A guess...) 
to around 10%. The hop processors (next 
stop) don't want the cones any dryer than that, 
as they don't store as well, and are subject to 
catching fire in the processing. The cones are 
layered flat, perhaps 40-48 inches deep when 
moist, and the height drops by a third as they 
dry. Conveyer belts do the layering 
automatically, creating a swimming pool 
effect. You can drown in a pool of  hops, and it 
has happened, but it is a death that many 
brewers contemplated that day. The dry cones 
are swept into a big chute with a big plunger. 
While not in operation that day (they didn't 
have any dry cones yet), the chute would fill 
up, and the plunger would come down. The 
chute would fill up again, and after the second 
plunger operation, the compressed cones 
would be burlaped and delivered to a storage 
warehouse. Which brings us to 


2) Hop Union.
Hop Union serves just a couple of functions. 
First, they are a hop processing and storage 
facility. Second, they serve as a middleman 
between hop growers and hop users, including 
homebrewers. However, while they are more 
concerned about their big customers, they are 
happy to make hop deals of over about 50$ for 
smaller users. HU does the analysis of acids, 
and stores the hops in warehouses for as long 
as needed. Freshness is not an issue at Hop 
Union. The hops are protected from oxidation 
by the compressed bales they are stored in, as 
well as the near-if-not-below freezing 
temperatures they are kept at. Hops from all 
over the world are sent to Yakima (a world 
center of something!) for storage and 
processing. As often as not, this processing 
involves pelletizing. The hop bales are cut and 
blade and chopped and ground and forced 
through an in-to-out extrusion device. This 
processing typically results in the reduction of 
about 0.3% bittering acid content. However, 
having had this rough treatment, these hops 
will last until the end of time. Flower hops will 
start at the same acid level, but will age more 
quickly than the pellets. There are many 
reasons why a brewer would want to use 
pellets, but I'll leave that argument for others. 
Pelletizing works for brewers of all sizes 
around the world. In fact, Hop Union supplies 
all of the hops for Brazil's major brewer, 
known cryptically from the customer name on 
the boxes of hops stored for it: C. Brahma. We 
didn't get to sample any of their brews this 
weekend.


Hop Union also cans hop oil extract. When 
big brewers use this stuff, the recipe calls for 
so many cans. They just pry off the lid and toss 
the can into the boil. Maybe that's the source 
of some breweries metallic taste.
The warehouses we saw contained every hop 
that you've heard of, and a few that you 
haven't. Cardboard signs show hop type and 
country of origin. The obvious choices are 
Great Britain, Germany and The Czech lands, 
but there were hops grown in Poland too! I 
want to make something with Polish hops. 
(For the record, they were reportedly similar 
to Saaz...)


3) Grant's Brewing.
I didn't go. Hunger overwhelmed me, and I 
skipped the tour to eat. Later, when I asked 
one of my new found brew buds what his 
favorite part of the day was, he said that it was 
talking to Bud Grant, and hearing what he had 
to say about his history of brewing. I missed 
it...

Subject: They're picking hops in the Pacific NW


The 1994 crop hop harvest has begun in both Oregon's Willamette
Valley and in Washington's Yakima Valley. So far I've heard that
Tettnangers are being picked in WA and I'm not sure what varieties
are being harvested in OR.


I live in Silverton, OR and drive by many of the big hop fields on my
way to work each morning and night. This morning I noticed the first
farm cart, full of hop vines, heading to be picked and dried. The
weather in Oregon was much better this summer than last--it should be
a good year for Oregon hops. Unfortunately, the news from Yakima is
not so good. This summer has been very hot and the growers have had
water problems. Early reports indicate that both yields and alpha
acid levels are down. Since Yakima growers account for the majority
of the hops produced in the US, prices will probably be higher and
alphas will probably be down.


Please note that this is all very preliminary and a lot can happen
between now and the time all the hops are harvested. I'll report back
when I find out more.

Subject: exciting post #1


 
St. Patrick's of Texas is run by my wife Lynne.  Over the past couple of 
years I have had less and less of a role which accounts for its continued 
growth.  Lynne peruses at least the titles of the digest daily and reads 
only those involving St. Pat's since everything else is wrong and of no 
interest to bright, good looking, patriotic Americans and Texans :-).
 
Over the past few weeks there have been a number of posts concerning St. 
Pat's.  Most were positive.  The information contained in these 
supportive posts is entirely correct although somewhat understated and 
lacking in the excitement and dynamism synonymous with St. Patrick's.  My 
experience is that simple improvements in literary style can do wonders.  
Might I suggest the use of more adjectives.  Here's a few proven 
winners.  SUPER, GREAT, WONDERFUL, EXCELLENT, UNBELIEVABLY SUPER, 
UNBELIEVABLY GREAT, REALLY REALLY WONDERFUL, MOST EXCELLENT, LOW LOW 
PRICES (not quite an adjective but exciting nonetheless) or as my kids 
say 'BAD OUT'.  So let's all get to work on rewriting those positive 
posts and get them back on the digest quickly so as to capture the 
excitement of our times which, of course, is also synonymous with St. 
Patrick's.  Digest readers lives will be enriched by reading these 
wonderful redrafts.  I know Lynne and I look forward to it.
 
There were a few negative posts written by our enemies and aliens bearing 
orings.  Nearly all of the posts dealt with the 5 gallon soda kegs.  All 
joking aside, here's a few facts to digest.
 
kegs sold (March to Present)        >1640
kegs pressure checked               >1640
kegs returned that wouldn't hold pressure   0, ZERO, ZILCH, ZIP, NONE
 
Two kegs were returned and sold within an hour to a local customer.
 
Please include these simple facts in future posts regarding St. Pat's kegs.
 
The kegs were sold to microbrewers, brewpubs, homebrew shops, and 
homebrewers from British Columbia to Florida at the same price regardless 
of the number purchased.  As is St. Pat's general policy, every customer 
receives the same treatment.
 
St. Pat's has never at any time misled anyone about any product with 
regards to condition, price and freight.  Except for the kegs.  Beginning 
in May, St. Pat's employees were instructed to UNDERSELL the kegs.  That 
is, buyers were told that all kegs were dented, all kegs were filthy, 
etc.  The fact is that the kegs were dirty but many were in beautiful 
condition.
 
There were delays of up to a 4-6 weeks in filling the backorders.  Lynne 
grossly underestimated the demand.  In early June when the second load 
arrived, Lynne had more than 700 on backorder.  You can pressure check 
about 10/hr.  The kegs were a lower priority than regular orders 
containing ingredients which are generally shipped the same day for 
orders recieved before noon.  This coupled with the oppressive 100 degree 
heat in June resulted in nearly 5 weeks before getting caught up.  Lynne 
is most appreciative of the courtesy and patience shown by virtually all 
of the >300 buyers.
 
The price was raised to 3/$45 (limit 3) sometime in July.  Since that 
time the orders have been very steady and the really nice thing is that 
she seems to get a nicer group of buyers at this higher price.  Strangely 
enough, people who pay more seem to expect less.
 
As of today the price is $20/keg, limit 3.  Lynne must slow down sales to 
stretch the inventory.

Subject: really exciting post #2


There was a post by Norm Pyle regarding the information in the St. 
Patrick's catalog concerning hops.  To be honest I'm confused.  The 
catalog seems to say almost precisely what Norm says.  St. Pat's catalog 
states explicitly that "It is the packaging that keeps it fresh, not its 
form."  St. Pat's has been warning brewers for months about hop plugs 
that are not good because they are not packaged properly.
 
That said, let me flame the hell out of St. Pat's competitors Hop Tech, 
Hop Source, and Freshhops which Norm foolishly buys from :-)
 
First Hop Tech.  Mark Garetz is a friend of Lynne and I and has downed 
more than a couple pitchers of Spaten doppelbock at the Walburg 
Mercantile with us on his visits to Austin.  The truth be known, he got 
us drunk and forced us to compose a lengthy boring book on hops:-).  All 
we got out it was an autographed copy----at the regular wholesale price.  
Worst of all he stores all his whole hops at low temperatures and 
packages them really well and actually sells them which really pisses 
Lynne off.
 
Next, Hop Source.  Glen Tinseth is a chemist which is synomous with 
genius.  We have heard nothing but good about his packaging and handling 
of whole hops.
 
Finally, Freshops.  We've never met or dealt with Dave Wills (sp?) at 
Freshhops.  But Lynne does know from a friend employed in the hop 
industry in the Northwest, that he does keep all hops refrigerated and 
properly stored.  Very good operation by all accounts.
 
I like a good argument but I honestly can't find much to fight about 
here.  Whata ya' say we replay the oring challenge?  Who wants to start? :-)

     Sorry, I can't comment about Wyeast as I haven't
tried any but you are spot on with the hop types. When
you say Kent, I presume you mean Kent Goldings. Fuggles
and Goldings are possibly the two most common hops used
in English Ales. Others include Challenger, Whitbread
Golding Varieties (W.G.V.), Styrian Goldings and many
others. One point to remember is that UK commercial
brewers consider seeded hops to be superior to un-seeded
hops which is in fact the opposite to US brewers (I am
told) - I'm not even going to begin to argue this point
as I have always used seeded hops so can't comment. Many
of these varieties are available seeded or un-seeded so
to be true to type make sure you get the seeded ones.
     On the subject of English malts, there are three
main types available here in the UK - Halcyon, Pipkin
and Marris Otter. I have used Halcyon with good results
and tasted some excellent commercial brews made from
Pipkin. I have just made a brew with some Marris Otter
but haven't tasted it yet but am told that it really is
an excellent malt.
     One final note, at the risk of telling you something
you already know, is that an infusion mash (either single
temp. or temp. stepped) is traditional for English Ales.
Good luck!

     This isn't a criticism of Larry Bristol's Fuller's ESB
recipe - I just thought this might be of use to Larry and
others who are interested in cloning ESB.
     The published information states that Fuller's use Pale
malt, Crystal malt, Flaked maize and Caramel for colour. The
hops are Challenger, Goldings and Target. Bitterness is 35
IBU. OG is 1053 and A.B.V. is 5.5%.
     I don't have any information on ratios of the ingredients
and haven't tried to clone the recipe myself so can't make
any further suggestions. The only thing I dislike about Fuller's
is that they use caramel for colour - I would substitute with a
small quantity of Chocolate malt myself but thats just because
I don't like additives in my homebrew.
     One final point just to make all you non-UK Fuller's fans
really jealous - Fuller's brewery is 15 minutes drive from where
I live and my local pub (a Fuller's house) is only 5 minutes walk.
Needless to say, the beers are always in excellent condition. Boy,
can I be cruel sometimes! :)

        A saaz hop rhizome I acquired by chance has not produced any

WILL prosper in their soil.  Don't bother putting your name on the list
unless you know it will grow for you; Saaz are very finicky.
        I will attempt to divide when the plants are dormant--probably in
November or early December--unless someone has a better idea. (late

Well, us Yanks consider you Brits to be strange people yes, but not
because of your habit of drinking warm ale.  (I'm kidding, don't get a
knot in your shorts!)  Actually, I think the trend of drinking ales a
bit warmer is becoming quite popular in the states as well.  It is
obvious that many more flavors come to the fore when the beer is allowed
to warm up a bit.  Unfortunately many barkeeps still don't have a clue.
I like to order my second beer long before I'm done with my first so the
ice on the glass has time to melt.  I have several non-brewing friends
who've discovered this as well, so its not just a homebrewer's secret.


Regarding your slow packet of London Ale yeast, don't give up Brian.  Its not
easy sometimes to get them going.  You just didn't allow enough time.
Considering the fact that the yeast had to travel overseas, I would expect
it to be in relatively rough shape.  That doesn't mean it won't go, but the
live cell count is probably down.  I recommend that you start a packet at
least 3 days in advance next time around.  Let the packet swell, pitch to a
pint starter (minimum) and let that get going before brew day.  I really
like the liquid yeasts, but they can be a bit more trouble.  Good luck.

Subject: Brewing in Louisiana


I'm an occasional extract ale brewer moving from the ideal brew climes of a
Madison WI basement to the sultry, basementless environs of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana.  Any tips on setting up simple brewing in this climate?
 
Also, my hometown of Knoxville, TN is now home to a brew pub.  Do any readers
have reviews they'd care to pass along.
 
Looking forward to Louisiana,

Subject:      Need Hop Help!


Greetings Brewers,
I've read the Hop FAQ (good job and thanks to all who participated in that
venture) and I want some more info.   I'm dissatisfied with my local suppliers
hops (read not fresh, sometimes yellow, uncertain age) and want some
recommendations of mail order suppliers so I don't have to put up with bad
hops.  There were a few mentioned in the FAQ but no addresses or phone #s.


How can one tell if oxygen barrier packaging is being used?  Is this sort of
packaging detectable by eye or does it require more subtile testing?


I live in Nebraska (read, hot summers).  Will hops exposed to the high
temperatures of a summer shipment be seriously damaged?  Or are shipping temps.
 not a concern?


Please send E-mail to me (BCHM014`at`unlvm.unl.edu) unless you feel your reply is
of general interest and warrants posting.


TIA
Todd Swanson  (bchm014`at`unlvm.unl.edu)

Subject: finings and bitter taste


Does anyone know the effect that using finings has on finished beer 
(other than settling out the grungies).  Does it affect taste, head, 
etc.?  Also, what are the pros/cons of the various types (gelatin, 
Polyclar, etc.)?


On a second issue, what causes the "biting-at-the-back-of-the-throat" 
bitter taste that is frequently present in home brewed lagers?  How 
does one prevent it?


Looking forward to your comments.
