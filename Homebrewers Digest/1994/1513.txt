Now my $0.02 worth:
My recipe for yeast starters ist simple enough, and it works well:




For 20 - 25 l (approx. 5 gallons) of wort:


Boil 500 ml (approx. 1 pint) of tap water with 2 tbsp of ordinary sugar.
Let it cool to 30 C (86 F), keeping it sterile. Transfer to a sterile
vessel (glass is best, because you can see the froth), add the package of
yeast, and stir vigorously. Keep in a warm, dark place (like an oven set to
86 F). In 30 - 120 min, the starter should be actively hissing and bubbling
 - ready for pitching. If you're not sure, one good test is to light a match
and lower it into the vessel: if the yeasts are active, the CO2 will choke
the flame.


I prepare the starter while boiling the wort, and when the boil is over,
the starter is ready.


Hope this helps!

OK, maybe some expert out there can explain it scientifically.  However, if 
you insist on seeing a krauesen, make your starter 1.040 or higher.  I used 
some canned wort for a starter recently and it had a huge krauesen.  However, 
in my previous thirty (or however many) starters, I had never seen a krauesen 
form.  


Bottom line?  I wouldn't look for a krauesen on a 1.020 starter--maybe a few 
bubbles.  You should have something usable in a day--look for yeast slurry in 
the bottom or swirl and watch the CO2 bubble out.

Subject: Question about possible contamination


Hello fellow brewmeisters!


        I have a question concerning how to tell if your beer is
contaminated.  My neighbor says that if you tilt a bottle and the beer
leaves a line on the inside neck, then the beer is contaminated.  If
you tilt the bottle and no residue is left, then the beer is fine.


        Is there any truth to this??  I bottled a batch of beer two weeks
ago, and the beer seemed to flunk the "tilt test", but I haven't tasted it
yet so I don't know if there are any off-flavors, etc.  Does anyone have
an easy, foolproof method for detecting this that even a novice like me
could follow?  Thanks...

Subject: IBU calcs in BRF and SUDSW




I've been looking at the brewing software tools : BRF and SUDSW. They both run
on a DOS PC, BRF being non-windows and SUDSW running under MSWindows.  
Anyways, they appear to be using different equations to calculate IBUs. SUDSW 
gives a higher value.  
 eg. 10 lbs of pale malt (70% efficiency) with 1 oz 7% alpha hops (60 min boil) 
     will give 32.2 IBUs in SUDSW and 31.3 in BRF. 
     Actually, the IBUs calculated by BRF change with mashing efficiency while 
     SUDSW is constant.    
Anyone know how these are calculated and why they might be different?   
Too bad they don't account for pellets vs. whole hops.
 
Also, I tried the SUDS for DOS program but was having many problems with it 
and gave up. Anyone else been having similar problems.

I just made a brown ale using Wyeast 1028. I used a starter of 1.040 OG (1 
quart water, 1/2 cup light DME). I never had a kruasen. The starter bubbled, 
 etc, but no krausen. I've been told, that to get a krausen on a starter, 
areate the #`at`!! out it and add some yeast nutrients. I've never worried 
about it.


After 1 1/2 days, I pitched the starter, at 80 F, and fermented at 68 F 
(well, maybe 62-68, we're having a bit of a cold spell). Primary 
fermentation completed last night (two days). OG was about 1.053, and I 
haven't racked to 2ndary yet (tonight). If you want more details, private 
E-mail me.


Oh yeah, shake that starter and get all the yeast up from the bottom, before 
pitching.

 There has been some Hugh Baird peat smoked malt available in some places,
 but I haven't seen it in my area (or in any of the many homebrew supply
 catalogs I have).  My solution was to make my own.  I constructed a malt
 "pouch" from heavy duty stainless steel screen with the ends and sides
 held together with staples.  I can fit up to 3 pounds of malt in there,
 and it's still small enough to fit in my propane grill.  I haven't actually
 smoked the malt yet, but I plan to get the lava rocks hot and add damp
 peat moss.  Once there is a nice smoke level without much ash particles,
 I'll put in the malt and close the lid.  I also plan to use a lightly
 kilned malt so that more of the smoke phenolics can be absorbed.

 P.S.  In my post about water a few weeks ago, I did mean temporary
 hardness.  We have much more carbonate than can be precipated out with
 the Ca and Mg ions, but preboiling the mash water really makes a
 difference in the pH of the mash water.

  Mocha Java Stout is one of my recipes and, if memory serves, I have always 
  had the same occurrence  I also notice whitish "flakes" during the ferment 
  which I have always theorized were cocoa butter from the bakers chocolate. 
  The "ring" I have noticed in my bottles seems, upon close examination, to 
  be a grouping of very small particles so I believe that it may also be 
  cocoa butter.  I have never had an off taste in this brew so I'd say this 
  is "normal" for this recipe.  The next time I brew it, I think I'll try 
  powdered, unsweetened cocoa instead of bakers chocolate to see if the 
  flake/ring phenomenon goes away.  As an aside, I have never had a head 
  retention problem with this brew in spite of using bakers chocolate and 
  apparently having cocoa butter carry over into the finished product.  By 
  the way, I'm glad you like the recipe as much as I do.

Using corn sugar should have made no difference; I've used both corn
and cane sugar for soda pop.  Remember that you don't let soda ferment
out completely, so the yeast will continue to ferment.  Some things to
consider so your next batch is successful:


1.  Only let the soda condition for a day or two at room temps, then
    refrigerate promptly.  The cold temps will drastically slow the
    fermentation.
2.  Use a smaller amount of yeast.  I use only 1 gram of dry yeast
    per gallon.  You only need enough yeast to carbonate sightly.
3.  Don't store for long periods of time, even in the fridge.  Drink
    it within a month or so, since it doesn keep fermenting, albeit
    slowly, at cold temps.
4.  Don't use lager yeast!  lager yeast will *not* stop fermenting in
    the fridge, and then you're in trouble.
5.  If you're using 2l PET bottles, you can slightly crack the cap
    and slowly bleed off pressure every so often before it gets out
    of hand.


And as long as I'm sending this to the digest, here's my preferred
method for making spiced beers:  simmer your spices in a quart of water
for 30-45 minutes, then add the whole mess (spices and all) to the
primary.  You don't need large amounts of spices, and some things I use
whole instead of ground, like cloves and cinnamon.  Try this mixture to
start:  3-4 whole cloves, 3 whole cinnamon sticks, 1/4 teaspoon ground
nutmeg, zest of 4 oranges.

Lee Bollard asks about:


>1. DeWolf & Cosyns
>2. Klages


DeWolf/Cosyns is a Belgian malting house, whereas Klages is a barley variety
grown in the US, so you see, you're comparing apples and oranges.  I don't
have all the facts on this, but the following table should give you an idea:


Varieties     Malting Houses
- ------------  -----------------------------------
Klages        Minnesota Malting (US)
Harrington    Great Western Malting (US? Canada?)
              Hugh Baird (UK)
              Maris Otter (UK)
              DeWolf/Cosyns (Belgium)
                   
This table does NOT mean to imply that Minn. Malting malts Klages and that GW
malts Harrington (although they might).  I'm just pointing out some of the
names to know.  There's another big Belgian maltster whose name escapes me,
and probably lots of others I'm forgetting, but I'm sure there's a lot of
smart guys out there who'll fix me up.  Also, I don't know the names of any
of the European barley varieties, either.  This sort of thing would be quite
good in the Malt FAQ I think (John, are you listening?).

Terry Terfinko writes about his beers drying out more than desired.  I have
had this problem from time to time, but only as the beers age for months, not
weeks.  I think this is a very low grade infection (many infections do not
cause obvious off-flavors) of bacteria.  The bacteria breaks down some of the
complex sugars and the yeast slowly ferments them out.  I believe this
mechanism is less likely to cause off-flavors than if the bacteria did the
whole job.  I'm no microbiologist, but I don't think mold is the culprit.  A
high population of mold probably indicates high populations of other buggers
that aren't published in the local news.  Also, the tricksters could be in
your water as well as your air, so keep that in mind.

The problem is that this is not a starter, but a mini beer. A starter
should NOT ferment, but grow aerobically; get rid of that air lock, in
fact get rid of that bottle as well: make your starter at the bottom of
your primary fermenter, where you will get a huge surface/volume ratio.


Splash it around regularly, and do not close the fermenter: Use a loose
plug of sterile cotton for a carboy, or a freshly boiled kitchen towel
for a bucket. That way, all the sugar is used to make more yeast, not to
make alcohol.

I have recently encountered confilicting definitions of Scotch Ale and Scottish
Ale. An old AHA style guide defines Scotch Ale as a French or Belgian Ale of
medium gravity, amber color, low hop bitterness, malt flavor predominates.
Someone else told me that Scotch Ales were closer to lagers than to ales(?).
Eckhard's Style Guide lists Scottish Ales as a sub-category or old or strong
english ales, having a smoky character from peated malt. But doesn't list a
scotch ale.


Where does this put 60/, 70/, etc. and "wee heavy?"


replies by e-mail and I'll summarize.

Be careful to use short stem into the tun, I have a 15.5 gal kettle
that I use for small beers that has one of these temp probes that
sticks in about 4 inches into the tun.  A major pain to stir fast
with a paddle since it gets knocked into all the time.  Im even
going to remove it and plug the damn hole.

Sight tubes are nice to have, but by no means a requirement.  They
are pretty easy to make, though.  What you can do is rig a T off a
ferrule, run a plastic tube/plexiglass tube up the side of the
tun.  This will provide a visual indicator of the liquid level in the
mash tun, which can be useful during lautering.  This setup is much
easier to employ with a false bottom, and if you intend to do a
RIMS someday, a false bottom may be a good investment. 


I assume you dont ever want to direct fire this thing?

I cant remember how Phil feels about this, but I think Brugse Tripel
is even *better* than Westmalle, especially since we can get it 
in the DC area. 


A comment on yields in mashing.  I have been having excellent
results using Munton & Fison Pale Ale Malt and DeWolf Cosyns
Pale Ale Malt and a 60 min rest at 152F, followed by a 10 min
rest at 170F.  Both of these base malts are wonderful to use,
give rich malty results and lauter easy.  They also seem to
yield 31-32 pts/lb/gal in my system.  


Good brewing,

Not to mess with your peace of mind Darren, but apparently some  
manufactures may use antimony, cadmium or lead to bond the enamel to  
the steel. These may be exposed if the pot gets cracked or chipped.  
Steve Prentise of the Illinois Restaurant Association (and prizing

Subject:  dishwasher/yeast starter summary


I recently posted a request for information on (1) sanitizing bottles
in an automatic dishwasher; and, (2) the preferred method for using
yeast starters, and received a deluge of suggestions (mostly about
the dishwasher).  Thanks to all those who replied. Because I received
some requests to pass along the information I've decided to post a
summary, but due to the volume of responses I'll pass on the personal
credits.  A distillation of the responses suggests the following
dishwasher method is most used:


Step (1):  Thoroughly clean bottles as soon as possible after
emptying them of beer and store for later use in a covered container
(to shelter the bottles from dust and other unwanteds). 
Step (2):  Load the clean bottles into the dishwasher and run a
heated wash and rinse cycle without any sanitizer or soap (the soap
inhibits the beer's head and may produce off-flavors) followed by a
heated dry cycle.  Apparently, it's the steam that's produced during
the dry cycle that sanitizes the bottles.  To not upset the yeast,
allow the bottles to cool before filling with beer.  Some suggested
using the dishwasher door as a bottling table (useful for catching
spills).  


There are some variations practiced out there:  A couple of
respondents did use dishwasher soap but followed up with a 2nd wash
and rinse cycle *without* soap to eliminate any residue.  Some
suggested running the dishwasher through a wash-rinse cycle *before*
loading it with bottles to thoroughly clean the interior and to
ensure no bits of food from the last dish washing cycle get sprayed
up into the bottles.  Another suggested cleaning any food scraps from
the drain screen before proceeding.  Some added 1/2 c or so of bleach
or B-brite at the beggining of the wash cycle or a few minutes into
the cycle but most added nothing.  A couple of caveats:  Don't put
bottles with labels attached into the dishwasher; the label will
disintegrate and little bits will be sprayed into the bottles.  And,
remove any drying agent from the washer (that little cylindrical
white plastic basket that my SO hangs on the top rack).    


On yeast starters, two respondents' preferred method was to pitch
just the slurry after flocculation although one had pitched both at
high krausen and after flocculation and didn't see much difference in
the end results.  Another had pitched the entire starter volume
before any visible signs of activity and had good results.  From
these responses there appears to be some latitude with starter
techniques. 


Again, thanks for the suggestions.

Subject: new brewer-bacteria


I have just finished my first brew and I think something went wrong.  At
each step throughout the brewing process I have been tasting the beer to
get a feel for the whole thing.  After it had been in the primary fermenter
for a couple of days, I couldn't believe how incredibly good the beer
tasted.  I was really amazed.  I thought the taste would not be there so
quickly.  


Then I went to a secondary fermenter and that is where I think my beer took
a turn for the worse.  Towards the end of the secondary (about 2 weeks) I
sampled the beer and this time it had taken on a very bitter taste.  I was
a bit worried but someone told me that this is normal so I continued on and
bottled the beer.  


Right now, my beer has been in the bottles for about 2 weeks.  It is fairly
clear but there has been sediment (bacteria or something?) forming on the
surface of the beer in each bottle.  I tried some of the beer a couple of
days ago. It had not carbonated yet and still had a very bitter taste.


Is my beer history?  What could I have done to cause the problem?  I was
fairly careful about sanitizing!  The only thing I can think of is the fact
that I topped up the secondary with mineral water from a bottle that was
previously opened.  Should I have boiled this water befor topping up?  I
want to try again but I really want to drink some beer insted of pouring it
down the drain.  Meanwhile, I guess I'll be going back to the beer store.


Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions - Richard.

At the suggestion of a fellow brewer, I tried my first Paulaner Salvator 
the other day.  Needless to say, I fell in love and was inspired to emulate 
it in an upcoming brew.  After researching the archives, I found this

Does anyone have any comments and/or suggestions about this recipe or other 
possible approaches to emulating Salvator?  Will this recipe get me in the 
general neighborhood?  It seems like a pretty intensive brew day with that 
long of a boil time, but I suppose that is what it will take to get that OG 
from an all-grain brew.  Could I get away with a partial mash and add a few 
pounds of Laaglander DME for body and residual sweetness?  I know this is 
bock-heresy, but I was thinking about using Wyeast 1338 European Ale yeast 
since it finishes very, very malty, and lagering is a royal pain with my 
current setup.


Any comments or ideas would be very welcome, public or private.

I was able to go to only one location in the DC area... Brickstellars.


Nice place, the decor...  looks like a brewing museum.  I spotted cans
and bottles that I remember seeing as a kid.  The menu, it lists over
500 beers, but my guess that they only have 375-400 in stock at any
one time.


What I had was:
        Celis Grand Cru - Wonderful beer.  Heavy body, light color
                                nice spicy aroma, corriander/ester
                                taste.
        Sarnac Black and Tan - Nice light dinner beer.  Medium body,
                                dark near black color, almost porter
                                like but has stout overtones.
        Sierra Nevada Porter - Exellent Dinner Porter.  Medium/med Heavy
                                body.  Dark/black color.  No burnt 
                                overtones, smooth.


Why my new friend (now looking to be a HB'er too):
        SA Honey Porter - I have had this at the Philly SA Brew Pub. Medium
                                body. Dark, Slighly sweet.  Honey after
                                taste.
        Dominion Mellenium - Heavy Doplebock.  Lactose intense odor - 
                                sour milk smell, milk sweet.  Bottle date
                                Feb 10, 1994 - near death date
        ???


Food was around $8.00 each.  The beers have a cost range on the menu from
2.95/bottle to $35.00/bottle.  They do have some of the most rarest (from
reading from you guys) beers in the world (Thomas Hardy 1988/1989).  


Here are the directions (I called to get them, the postings I have gotten
are wrong).  In DC take the RED line toward Shady Grove.  Get off at the
DuPont Circle.  Take the Q street north exit.  This will get you at 21st
street and Q street.  Take Q street up to 22nd.  Turn left, follow 22nd 
street 500 or so feet.  There it is, mid block between P & Q on 22nd street.

    I use a 1/2 bbl Sankey as a brewpot, and a 200K BTU King Kooker made
by Metal Fusion in Kenner, LA, 1-800-783-3885. There are two models of this
type, one with three cross members welded to the support ring, the other
with six. I have the one with six, and have never had a problem.
    I believe the cooker Guy refers to is a 165K BTU multi-jet model made
by Brinkman. A fellow club member checked this model out, and told me that
it's support ring is exactly the same diameter as a Sankey keg. It's easy to
imagine the disaster that would result if one happened to bump the keg or the
stand while it was full of boiling wort. He took a pass on that model.

    I've made a few attempts to clone Fuller's ESB, it's one of my favorite
commercial beers. I've found that using flaked maize as ~8% of the grain bill
produces that smooth, slightly grainy sweetness in just about the right
proportion.
    I've had no success in getting the color dark enough, despite a fair
amount of 70L crystal. I wasn't aware they used caramel. Thanks for the
tip, Brian.

Hop plugs made by Morris Hanbury, in Yakima, Wa are packaged extremely
well.  Homebrewers who want high quality imported plugs can order
direct from Morris Hanbury and avoid dealing with homebrew shops
who claim that plugs are a bad way to go.  If you dont like what a
shop claims, and you're tired of paying retail prices, buy well
packaged hops in bulk and store them in your freezer.  The mark 
up on retail hops is one of the main rip offs in the homebrew supply
industry.  Also be aware that a certain wholesale supplier is now 
advertising full page ads in BT with extremely reasonable prices on
D/C malts and whole hops.

Subject: my religeous conversion (Iodophor)




After a decade of using bleach as a sanitizer I have switched to Iodophor -
and I like it.


The trigger event was a hole in an (el cheapo) stainless steel pot.  I used to
put a bleach solution in it to sanitize airlocks and hoses for a half hour
or so - but sometimes I forgot and it turned into several hours.
Anyway.... If bleach can do this to the pot, what is it doing to my 5 corny
kegs?  So I switched to Iodophor.


What do I like about Iodophor:


        I no longer have to be careful about getting sanitizer on my clothes.


        I can leave Iodophor in unused cornelius kegs so that they are
        ready for use immediately.


        Super rinsing is no longer needed.  After sanitizing with bleach,
        I rinsed my equipment several times with sterile water in order to
        remove all traces of clorine.  Now one single rinse is all I use
        (I know you don't HAVE TO rinse Iodophor - but I insist).


        I don't worry if the sanitizing solution is strong enough or not.
        If you can see the Iodophor color in the solution, it's good enough.


The only disadvantage is that, in strong concentration, some plastic equipment
picks up the Iodophor color if you leave it for a long time (big deal).

Subject: How to pronounce Celis?


Now that I've tasted Celis White and Grand Cru, I guess it's time to pronounce
them correctly.  Is "Celis" pronounced like "say-lee" or "sell-iss" or 
"Kell-eas" or something else?


Thanks,

Subject: Peat smoked malt: Good question!


On August 22 Alan Pagliere asked the Digest if anyone knew of a source for
peat-smoked malt to use in brewing.


Good question! We, too, as lovers of smoky single-malts, have been
searching for suppliers of peat-smoked malt. In desperation, and with a
sort of comic air, we bought some local peat, smoked it, and tried to toast
malt in the oven with the "smoked peat," but as you can imagine, nothing
came of it except some smoke and some laughs. 


So if anyone has news, please post to the Digest.  Thanks!

Subject: Latest wisdom on Counterpressure Bottle Fillers


What is the latest view on who makes the best one? I think at one time we
had all agreed it was BMP. Is that still so, if so, how can I reach them?
They've not advertised in the last issues of Zymurgy and Brewing
Techinques.


Please reply via e-mail, I will summarize.
