Subject: Peat smoked malt warning


A brewer in my homebrew club bought a sack of peat smoked malt and used some
of it in an ale. It was not a pleasant experience. Too much peat smell and
taste! Over the past year that one bag of malt has been split and tried by
several members of the club. My feeling after tasting all these experiments
at varying degrees of addition of the malt is "Don't use peat smoked malt".
This stuff is intended for making scotch whiskey not beer. If you are after
smoke smells and flavors in you beer, then find or make some smoked malt.
Peat flavors and smells are not appropriate in ANY style of beer, IMHO. 


Now that said, if you are determined to put this stuff in your prized Scotch
ale, then I would suggest about 2 ozs per 5 gals. This will keep the peat
notes in the background. Of course this won't be enough smoke smell and
flavor either. There have been several micros that have dumped entire
batches of beer made with this malt, so be careful!

Subject: Yeast culturing




Thanks to all who replied to my request for information on culturing yeast
starters.  In brief, the consensus seemed to be to make a starter around
1.040 rather than 1.020, and don't expect to see any krausen.  Most
suggested heavy aeration, and a few suggested yeast nutrients or energizers.


I pitched the starter that I thought might not have taken.  About 250 ml of
"beer" went into the bottom of a 5 gallon and a 7 gallon carboy.  I then
added 1.058 wort (IPA) and in about 24 hours there were signs of very active
fermentation.


About 36 hours after pitching I had the Mother of all Primary Fermentations.
It looks like the gremlins are in there with paddle wheels.  High krausen,
globs of stuff floating up and down, and swirling currents make this look
like the inside of the triple load washer at the laundromat.  Any questions
I might have had about that strain of yeast and the starter I used are now
dispelled.


Thanks for all your replies and help.

Subject: Starters


It seems to me that many of the posts regarding starters miss an 
important point - that the object of making a starter is to get a large
quantity of desirable yeast.  It is not to make a small quantity of beer.
My guess is the best way to make yeast is probably different from the
best way to make beer and that the criteria for a good starter may well
be different from the criteria for a good beer (krausen, taste, color,
cloudiness, shelf life, etc..).  I suspect many "recipes" for starters
are based on recipes for beer.  Can some of you experts out there comment
on how to judge a good starter from easily observable parameters? 
TIA Steve Scampini

There's been a lot of discussion lately about smoking grain, and
a few suggestions (in the FWIW department).  So now you can get the 
REAL FACTS,  from the snoot of the Coyote!  :)


Supplier: I know I've seen it, I know I have.  I thought it was the
Beverage People, or Brewers Resource, so before misleading you all
I just ran and checked my catalogs.  Wrong on both accounts, unless it
was a diffferent issue.  My aluminum tainted brain is not helping!
But there was SOMEONE who offered a special of Peat Smoked grain
for making scottish ales authentic.


As for DOING IT:  The word of wisdom is:  It ain't PEAT MOSS you want to 
smoke, but PEAT WOOD.  I generally run across hickory, and a couple others
at home-yard supply stores.  


As for how to smoke grains:  There was a fancy article in an issue of
Zymurgy, but it's a bit more extravagant than most of us might go for.
The bottom line was:  Cool/moist smoke.  This can be achieved fairly
well with one of those dome smokers. (~$30)  You put charcoal in a bottom
tray, cook it up, the drop your wood (well soaked!) in after the coals are
ripe and white.  A tray of water is placed on the upper rack, and you set
you salmon, and grain on the tray.  Close up the dome, and let-'er rip.
Plan on MANY hours of slow smoking time. (you might want to avoid the fish,
and just put some cheese on, less cross-flavoring that way  :)


Personally I wouldn't suggest using a propane BBQ for proper smoking.
There is a definite quality due to the REAL fires of charcoal.  If you
don't have a smoker- go buy one, or check the salvation army, surplus stores
etc.   They are nice to have around.  But if you've got a charcoal grill
you can still manage.  Build a fire in one corner, let it overcook (past white)
        Make a screen/mesh container for the grains. You'll want to use
BIG CHUNK size wood for smoking, the chips aren't nearly as good, the burn
too quick. You want the to smolder NOT burn.  So soak them overnight in
water. Change the water a couple times to leach out some of the tannins.
When you fire is ready, place the wood on top/near the edges- spaced so they
don't snuffocate the charcoal.  It will still need air to burn.
(for a gallon's volume of charcoal use about 5 big chunks of wood???)


Make sure you have the fire pushed to one corner of the grill. Place a 
pot of water on top of the charcoal area.  Then put the grains on the grill
far away from the fire source.  You don't want to heat the grains- they'll 
burn!  Set the rack high if you can.  Close up the lid, and light up a good
pipe or cigar, and smoke along with your grain.  Grab a few homebrews and
kick back for a few hours (at least 3 I'd say).  Check the grain from time to 
time, and stir it, so you don't burn any, especially shuffle some away
from the heat source.


Add your grains to a mash as you would specialty grains. It might be
best to minimize the mash time of the smoked malt so you don't lose
the smoky character, so add halfway, or at the end.


I'd recommend 2-5 # for a standard mash regime.  You could smoke the
whole amount of the pale malt for a more powerful flavor.
After fermentation, have some of the smoked cheese and salmon handy, cuz
you'll have a strong desire for it!   :)


I have a lot of apple wood available to me and plan to use it.
Anyone have any experience with smoked applewood beers?  Perhaps I'll
have to throw in some apple cider with such a ferment!


***
Contaminants:  Come in many sizes and colors.  A ring around the surface
CAN be one type of contaminant. It can be yeast too.  If you added Zuccini
(You crazy fool!) to a brew- you may have a ring of lipids.  Does it have
a cooked vegetable smell and flavor to it?
        Haze, dryness, sour smells,  etc.....can all be signs. The Zymurgy
special issue on trouble shooting has some good tables. Several books do also.
***


Yeast Starters:  Pierre sed
>
The problem is that this is not a starter, but a mini beer. A starter
should NOT ferment, but grow aerobically; get rid of that air lock, in
fact get rid of that bottle as well: make your starter at the bottom of
your primary fermenter, where you will get a huge surface/volume ratio.


Splash it around regularly, and do not close the fermenter: Use a loose
plug of sterile cotton for a carboy, or a freshly boiled kitchen towel
for a bucket. That way, all the sugar is used to make more yeast, not to
make alcohol.


*  Um, yeah uh, er...the basic idea is sound, but you are asking for
contamination!  A yeast starter should be as pure of a pure culture as
you can come up with.  Until it has developed a nice CO2 security blanket
you are begging for trouble (at least in my fur and flea ridden household!)
by excessive air contact.  You want dissolved O2 in the starters wort.


Make your starter (be it 1.020, or 1.040- you choice!) and cool it. 
Then SWIRL the living daylights out of that puppy.  But do so in a closed,
securely confined container. If you happen to have a erlenmeyer flask and
a orbital shaker you're in business.  The swirling action will add plenty
of O2 for a yeast starter.  Pitch you yeast culture and swirl every once
in a while.  This will keep it aerated.  But KEEP IT CLOSED, don't stick
matches, fingers or baby binkies in there. They have no place in a pure
culture of yeast!


As for timing:  If you're using a liquid yeast packet, not the time it takes
to puff up fully.  Count on you starter taking as long to multiply.
My rule of thumb is overnight for the packet (unless it needs more) and
overnight for a 1 liter starter.  Then by the evening when my wort is 
racked, the starter's ready to go.  With healthy yeast, works like a charm.
If they are slower, go two days each.


Someone mentioned making a starter at the beginning of the boil, and it
being ready by the time the wort is cool.  That may work if you're talking
about REHYDRATING a dry yeast packet, but if you're working with cultures
or liquid yeast packs you need MORE time to properly multiply.


\\\\  Just my 2c for the day.  Do I know what I'm talking about?
        Just ask my KING SCRUMPY STOUT that's tumbling in turmoil in the 
        basement as we speak.  Irish Ale yeast: took off before nightfall.
        I also used the "new" Whitbread from yeast labs. It has LAGGED!
        Anyone have any experiences with it, good or bad?

Subject: Filtering/Straining Irish Moss




OK results are in such as they are. It seems that filtering/straining after
boiling the wort has little or no effect on the finished beer. Some people 
reccomended filtering the wort through a strainer and the natural hop bed that
will quickly collect there. Others just dumped everything into the primary and
let it settle out. Others were somewhere in between. Everyone thought their
method produced good beer, so it is probably a matter of personal preference.


Having tried the "dump it in" method I think the sludge in the primary is
really gross, but probably can't hurt me. Last night I tried  straining through
the hop bed, but it only took a small amout of wort to completely block the
strainer. Feeling that longer exposure to open air was probably more harmful
than stuff in the fermenter, we sort of sloshed it around until most of the
wort was through, then poured a little water over the hops collected there to
get all the good stuff out of them, and then dumped the hops into the sink,
repeating until all the wort was in the fermenter. The wort turned out
reasonably clear, but it is a dark beer, so A) it is hard to tell, and
B) it proabaly doesn't matter.


PS. The batch I added Irish Moss to is ready to bottle, but doesn't seem more
clear than other batches.


Thanks to the following respondents to my questions about filtering and 
Irish Moss.

People have been asking where to get smoked malts.  I know that Steinbarts 
in Portland, OR carries Hugh Baird peated malt.  (They advertise in Zymurgy 
and probably BT, so you can get the address and phone number there.)
     
But take care with this stuff.  I recently experimented with 1/4 pound of 
peated malt in a 5-gallon batch of ale, and it added quite an impact.  I 
couldn't taste it at all when I sampled the wort after the boil.  But after 
fermentation, the taste was more smokey than I wanted. I used my own 
made-up recipe, so that could be the problem.  But still, I don't think 
peated malt is for everyone.

Well, I'm not having a beer at lunch, but at least I can spend my
lunchtime talking about it in response to a bunch of HBD items (and a
question of my own)


First, a quick question--is James Spence accessible on the net for
competition questions, form requests, et cetera.


The responses:


PORTLAND: I requested and received (thanks) the Portland (OR) review
from CompuServe (TM) that was offered in a previous HBD. It turned out
to be simply a quick trip review and was not a comprehensive
listing/review. It's fine for what it is (although I disagreed with some
of the evaluations), but I thought I'd let people know that it's not a
comprehensive list, and perhaps save the person who offered it from the
burden of excess email from people who are really expecting something
else. It's a frequently requested topic, and I'd be willing to offer my
observations on the Portland scene for whatever they might be worth. (I
don't live there; I've visited only twice, most recently in early
August) I'm willing to post a brief write-up, but not right now. If any
of you Rose City natives (or transplants) want to say something about
it, I'd much rather hear your perspectives than hear myself talk (uh...
read myself write? oh, never mind :-) )How about it, Portland?


SMOKED MALT--I'll have to check my catalogue, but Brian North (North
Brewing Supply / Franklin, Wisconsin / sorry, don't have address right
at hand, but I bet Mitch Gelly could give it to you right away) sells a
distiller's malt. I haven't used it because the time I considered trying
some, he was sold out. Will get the rest of the information for you.
DISCLAIMER: I have no financial interest, just a satisfied customer...


SCOTCH ALE questions: Check the current AHA style guidelines.... Scotch
Ale is a high gravity style and, if memory serves, is classified with
Old Ales/Strong Ales and _not_ with Scottish Ales.


BELGIAN Ale file??? I followed the instructions to get the compilation
of the recent Belgian posts (send a blank message with SUBJ: Help) and
got back what might be considered an error message that instructed me
how to get an index of the lambic digest, but nothing about the recent
items. How do I get the file if not as instructed?


BRICKSKELLAR... No offence intended, but the post sounded like the child
who insisted on going to the ice cream place with 100 flavours...and
ordered vanilla. I have not been to the Brickskellar. I've heard that it
has a wonderful collection of breweriana and lots of bottled beer, but
it is basically a beer tourist trap. I may try it sometime despite the
warning. Personally, if I'm seeking out beer when travelling, I'd rather
go someplace where I can get the local brews fresh on tap. I don't
dispute that much of what they had was good beer, but it could have been
easily obtained elsewhere (including at home) at less-than-Brickskellar
prices. I figure if you're going to go there, you might as well get the
exotic stuff you can't get elsewhere. Again, this is just my $0.02 and
not a flame; the real test is whether you enjoyed yourself.... Keep
beerhunting!














CELIS.... To the best of my knowledge (including attending a dinner
where he spoke), it is pronounced SELL-ISS. Hope that helps when you ask
for it at your neighbourhood liquor store.  It _is_ wonderful stuff when fresh!

This is very bad advice for a number of reasons:


1. By "ordinary sugar" you probably mean sucrose, right?  Yeast can and do
eat sucrose, but it has been found that yeast that have been raised on
pure sucrose or glucose seem to later have difficulty fermenting maltose.
Starters should have a similar proportion of maltose in the wort into which
you plan to pitch.  My source for this information is from an article in
the ASBC Proceedings, whose title escapes me.


2. In 30-120 minutes, you may have activity, but you certainly won't have
grown anywhere near the proper number of cells for a 5 gallon batch.  If
you are talking about rehydrating a package of dry yeast, the yeast will
be much healthier if you rehydrate in pure, sanititized, 90-110F tapwater.
The higher osmotic pressure of wort or sugar solution makes it difficult
for the yeast to uptake the water.  This data is from the Lallemand yeast
newsletter, experiments that I've done personally and from the Yeast Special
Issue of Zymurgy.


3. If you are talking about making a starter from a puffed-up Wyeast package,
then the times you state are much too short.  The proper time to pitch is
NOT at high kraeusen as most books state, but rather after the yeast are in
the stationary phase -- well after high kraeusen.  It is at this time that
the yeasts' glycogen levels are the highest and the lag phase will be the
shortest.  Granted, you can make delicious, prize-winning beer from non-
optimal pitching (I've done it myself), but it's good to know the theory
even if you diverge from it occasionally.  References:  Practical Yeast

A bottle infection of aerobic microbiota produce a ring-around-the-collar
(RATC), but there are a great many infections from anaerobic bacteria which
would much rather sit in the very bottom of the bottle, so you won't get
RATC from them.  Based upon experiments that I've done, I am quite confident
that the most common cause for RATC is from priming solution protein and
not from infection.  Oils in the beer can also cause RATC, but this is
even less common, I feel, than infections.  The solution to the protein
in the primings (i.e. DME, wort, spiese or extract syrup used for priming)
is to either use corn sugar for priming or (if you insist on malt-based
priming) make sure you boil your priming solution well and then force 
cool it.  Do not add the hot and cold break to the green beer!

Norm writes about barley varieties and malting houses.  I'd like to make
a few small corrections.  Maris Otter is a barley, not a malting house.
Crisp Maltings makes Maris Otter Malt from Maris Otter barley.  I've heard
(no kidding) that there's a new malt on the horizon called Maris Badger,
but then perhaps it is just a joke -- you know that British wit.

I have motorized mine and am very happy with it.  I used a 1/3 HP motor,
running at (I believe) 1720 RPM, turning a 1.25" diameter pulley, which
drives a 12" pulley on the MaltMill.  Without modification to the grain
chute, I'm milling at a rate of 10 seconds per pound.  I did have to
extend the base board because the 12" pulley makes the motor have to be
further away than the standard base will allow.  If you can find a slower
motor, you could maybe use a smaller mill pulley and use the standard base.
Note that with a much smaller mill pulley, you may need more horsepower.

selection and they are adding to it all the time. The hops are vaccum
packed in oxygen barrier bags (of course), and are labeled clearly.  they

Sorry about having to quote so much, but I'm still confused.  Okay, let's
assume that the purpose of working near a lit burner is to heat the flask
so that air goes OUT of the flask.  But no matter how much you heat the neck
of the flask, as soon as you pour media from the flask, the space taken up
by the media will have to be replaced by something.  Well, as I see it, it's
going to be air.  Whether you tip the flask back and forth or if you keep it
perpendicular to the table, you will still suck air into the flask as the
media pours out.  So I'm still confused how working next to a flame will
reduce the chances of getting your plate contaminated by airborne microbiota.

As the beer ages, it seems that the cane sugar primed bottles

I have been experimenting with a couple of Dopplebocks over the last
two months and run into the same problem with both. After using Irish 
Moss and running through a counterflow chiller I get a great cold break. 
The proteins coagulate into stuff that looks like pasta. Problem is no 
matter how much I chill it I can't get the stuff to settle all the way to 
the bottom so I can rack the wort off the protein before pitching the yeast.


This has not been a problem with lighter beers. In those the hop 
material, protein etc. settles to the bottom in about a half hour and I 
am in business. With my first Dopplebock I gave up and carried the trub 
over into the fermenter. After 14 days at 45^, those protein beasties
are STILL hovering about 1 1/2" above the bottom of the fermenter.


Anybody have a solution? It it possible to filter this stuff out without 
oxegenating the beer? Thanks!

I use to think this was false, afterall look at the commerical beers like

Because of the small bubbles and long lasting head I thought it had to be

       Date:8/31/94
I called two stores in Norfolk and Hampton VA, IRT
Gregg Tennefoss' alert that Hunter Airstats may be
available in HQ stores in the VA/NC area.  Sorry to
say I had no luck.  One clerk said that they did have
a device called Cool Jack (standard disclaimer!!)
manufactured by the Ivy Group of Chicago, IL which
sells for $20 and sounds like it works on the same
principle.  (I called Ivy `at` 312-334-8265, but there
was no answer).  The unit will control a 120V A/C from
50-90 degrees F.  Has anyone seen this device and if
so do you think it's worth looking into as an
alternative?  I have not seen it in the VA/DC area. 
I also called Hunter and they recommended searching
out smaller hardware store chains such as Ace which
may still have inventory.

Subject: low alcohol brews


In HBD #1514, Clay Glenn reports on his experiments with heating beer to drive
off alcohol. He has several questions that need answering, and here are my
lucky guesses.


One question he had was how much alcohol (if any) he got rid of. I question him
back: what were the final gravity readings of the two batches? As alcohol is
less dense than water, it should be (theoretically) easy to determine the
difference in alcohol from the difference in specific gravities of the
'boiled' and 'not-boiled' beers.


Secondly, when seeking to remove alcohol, it isn't quite necessary to get the
beer heated up to alcohols boiling point. The vapor pressure of liquid (in this
case alcohol) near the boiling point should be sufficient to drive off the
liquid. In the book 'The lore of the Still', there are directions for doing
something like this. The temperature is increased gradually, and the different
molecular weights of the different alcohols cause different boiling temps,
which are arrived at gradually. Of course, in using a still, the emphasis is on
recovery of the correct alcohols, and the discarding of the others (throw away
the first and the last alcohols, save the stuff in the middle), but to discuss
this idea would seem to be condoning illegal acts. Not me...


Just a few thoughts...

Gelatin drops out yeast.  So if its a chill haze, it probably won't
help you.


>How do you use the gelatin?  TIA.


1/2 tsp dissolved in a cup of 170F water, added to the secondary.
Make sure its dissolved completely, otherwise you'll get chunks
floating around.


Keep cool, (the beer not necessarily yourself ;-) ) and allow to
sit for 7-10 days.  If you can keep it at 40F that would be great.


BTW  Because this knocks out the yeast, you may not be able to bottle
as usual and expect it to condition properly.  I force carbonated the

 I do not have a copy of my response but if you still insist that the

 I have had on the shelf, MALTMILL jr (tm) for over two years and never 
 bothered bringing it to market because of the economics involved.  This has 
 5" rollers of the same diameter as the standardard MM but the total savings 
 at the manufactuing level is less than 10%.  I chose to go the other way (MM 
 II) and let someone else chase the low end of the market.
 
 Seeing what Glatt has done, tells me I made the right choice.  They offer 4" 
 rollers, only 1 1/4" in diameter, with a severly reduced throughput and a 
 rather trivial price differential.
 
 > I don't mind over-engineering, particularly in a consumer product, but I'm 
 not aware of any benefit I am receiving with 10-inch rollers. 
 
 Try running it at 400 RPM and the benefit will immediately become obvious.  
 One other benefit that is non-tivial is that fact that Glatt has to use gears 
 to get the smaller rollers to feed properly and the MM self-feeds because of 
 the longer rollers (among other reasons).  In order to keep the cost down 
 Glatt is forced to use plastic gears and this has caused users no end of 
 grief.
