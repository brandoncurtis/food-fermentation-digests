Subject: Neophyte questions & thanks




Thanks to the guidance of a personal homebrew tutor, books by Charlie
Papazian and Dave Miller, and the HBD, I'm proud to say that I'll be
prying caps off of my first batch this weekend - an all grain Pale
Ale.  All indications at bottling and during a carbonation check
indicate that at a minimum it will be better than I ever thought beer
I made would be.  So, thanks for this great forum and the confidence
it breeds in newbies like myself.


Now a couple short questions (I read the hbd.faq, hop.faq, and
yeast.faq - very good sources of information - but couldn't find the
answer to these two.  Perhaps in the upcoming mash.faq?):


1.  Could someone who uses a Corona mill e-mail me personally the
setting that you use for milling your malt?  Based on the
aforementioned books and tutor's advice that most homebrew shops will
mill your grain, I assumed (bad thing to do) that mine would too.
They pointed to the $60 Corona on the shelf.  I declined, and spent 3
hours crushing grain by hand.  Actually got ok results for a beginner
with no mill - about 28 points/lb/gallon.  So budgetary constraints
forced the corona for now ($35 mail order), but would I like some
guidance on it's use.  I plan to brew batches 2 and 3 this weekend -
an Altbier and a Kolsch, so rapid replies are best.


2.  What is TIA at the end of peoples posts?


BTW, thanks to weird admin here, replies to the machine that sends

Your "barbaric" hop schedule is fine.  As hops boil, two things are
happening: 1) alpha-acids are being isomerized and 2) volatiles are
boiling off.  The longer you boil, the larger the percentage of AA's
will get isomerized and the larger the percentage of AA's that will
stay in solution when you cool (this is boil utilization).  Also, the
longer you boil, the more volatiles you boil off.  Anything longer than
about 5 or 10 minutes and most of the hop aroma will boil off.  Anything
longer than about 15 or 20 minutes and most of the hop flavor will boil
off.  So, you see, your bittering hops (the ones you plunk in with
90 or 60 or even 30 minutes to go contribute mostly bitterness.  Flavor
hops that you add with 15 or 20 minutes to go will add quite a bit less
bitterness, but some of their flavor will remain.  Finishing hops, added
with only 5 or 10 minutes to go will add virtually no bitterness but
will add a little hop flavor and quite a bit of hop aroma.


Last night I was reading an article entitled "An Investigation of the
Relationships Between Hopping Rate, Time of Boil, and Individual Alpha-
cid Utilization" by A.J.Irwin, et. al. from Vol. 43, No. 3 of the ASBC
Journal, in preparation for an upcoming book review I'm writing.  In
this article, the authors were trying, among other things, to minimize
the cost of adding bitterness to beer.  As I've explained above, the less
you boil the less bitterness you are going to get from the hops, but also
the more money you will spend on heat.  You could get a similar amount
of bitterness from a 30 minute boil with, say 2 ounces of hops, as you get
with a 60 minute boil with, about 1 ounce of the same hops, but with less
energy cost.  Perhaps the researchers were considering only the very low
hop rates of typical industrial lagers, where the effect of the added hop
flavor might be less, but in the case of our more highly hopped styles
it could be problematic.


Consider the case where you would use about four times the hops of a 60
minute boil, but only boiled 15 minutes.  In this case you would be making
a beer with an incredible amount of hop flavor even though the actual IBUs
would be the same as if the beer was made with a 60 minute boil and a "normal"
amount of hops.


So, the answer to your question is that yes, you could get the same amount
of bitterness from a shorter boil, but the cost of hops would be higher,
you still should boil 60 minutes for good hot break (which incidentally
is made better by the addition of hops -- so your hot break might be worse)
and the amount of hop flavor could be excessive for the style.

Perhaps you were a bit too subtile for some... I think Spencer meant
to point out that this *bull* and that the method of carbonation is
NOT going to affect the bitterness.

I agree that time is a big factor. My experience is that it does take
some time to get that fine-bubbled carbonation, but then the small-protein
content of the beer is going to determine if the head lasts or doesn't.
In other words, a thin, overcarbonated beer might have a nice head at
pouring, but the head would collapse shortly thereafter and the beer
would taste acidic and prickly, as opposed to a properly carbonated beer
with a good level of small-proteins which would have a long-lasting head
and a lot smoother palate.

That wasn't just Porter, that was Great Lakes Brewing Company's
Edmund Fitzgerald Porter!  But I agree, it had a nice, creamy
head and very fine bubbles, all in about 30 seconds.

Subject: How to prepare polyclar / philchill fittings




In my latest batch I forgot the Irish Moss and decided
to try some polyclar in the secondary.  The polyclar
came with no instructions and my literature search
(Miller, Fix, Papazian) also came up empty.  So the
question is, how does one prepare the stuff ? I thought
of boiling it in some water to sanitize, but wound up
pitching it dry.  Does anyone know the proper usage ?


Also, I noticed in the latest issue of Brewing Techniques
an ad for Philchill Fittings - basically a kit for
making a counterflow chiller.  The ad is for wholesalers
only.  Does anyone know of a retailer who has these ?


thanks,

Way back when in 7th grade science class, I constructed a solar water
heater that used 3/8" copper tubing.  My father had a hand held tube
bender, probably something a plumber would commonly have.  It was able
to make something like a 3" radius 90 degree turn, more than tight
enough for a chiller.  I would imagine you could find one at a plumbing
supply store that would fit 5/8".


Maybe warming the tubing just a little prior to bending would also help.


You could also try filling one/both of the tubes with sand or something,
but that could be tough to clean out afterwards.  In the metal
fabrication shop I worked in one summer we commonly filled small
diameter tubing with some alloy with a very low melting pt, bent the
tubes, then heated them in boiling water to drain the alloy.  Don't know
what it was, but it's probably not practical for home use anyway.

    On a more beer related note, to the fellow who related his

I am trying to find a way to reference IBUs to something other than

additional maltiness or other differences.


A while back there was a wonderful post about using various extracts and
a reference beer for learning about off flavors/odors. Would it be
possible to use hop extract and a reference beer to come up with
IBU references that are "brewer neutral"?

From: Bill Sutton <wrs`at`hpuerca.atl.hp.com>
Subject: SG calculations


I brewed a new extract based pale ale last night and, while it seems to be
well within style, it didn't match my calculations at all.


I used 4 lbs of Alexander's Pale Malt Extract Syrup, 2.9 lbs. of Alexander's
Pale Extract Kicker, and 8 oz. 40L crystal malt for the brew.
Brew procedure was:


   Boil 2.5 gallons H2O, add salts, remove from heat and cool to 150 F.
   Add Extract Syrup, add Crystal Malt (in grain bag). Steep 15 min.
   Bring wort back to boil. Remove Crystal Malt & "squeeze sparge".


Due to bad decisions ("hmm -- I'll bet loose hop pellets will be utilized
more efficiently than if they were in my hop bag..."), my siphon was really
horrible and I ended up with only 2 gallons. After topping this off to 5
gallons, I ended up with an SG of 1.043 (corrected to 60 F). Unfortunately,
I didn't measure the SG of the partial boil volume (sorry - it was midnight
and I wasn't clinking thearly...)


Based on charts and data in Mosher's _Brewer's Companion_, my estimate
for the OG was 6.9 lb * 8 pts/lb in 5 gallons = 55.2 for the malt
extract, .5 lb * 7 pts/lb in 5 gallons = 3.5 for the crystal = 58.7
(1.0587). I have never gotten this high before, so my expectation was
in the 1.050 range.


I'm not unhappy with the result, as an OG of 1.043 will work just fine.
I'm more concerned with trying to understand why my calculations didn't
jive with my results.


I am leaning toward the theory that Alexander's is more like 6 pts/lb in
5 gallons, not 8. This makes the SG from malt syrup 41.4, and when adding
the 3.5 for the crystal leaves 44.9, which is only about 10% off and
makes sense to me as loss from the leftover gunk in the brewpot.


Is this a good assumption? Is there a better reference on adjusting SG
based on ingredients (TNCJOHB gives a brief treatment but it doesn't seem to
be very accurate)? Specifically, I am looking for information on the
relationship between amount of ingredients and SG (linear? Exponential?
from the literature at hand it seems to be linear, but I also remember
reading that it isn't quite ...), a formula that gives SG for N gallons
given a constant provided for the ingredient (DME, syrup, crystal, etc),
and a table of these constants. Mosher and Papazian have tables, though
Charlie's is a little sparse and Randy's seems to be too specific (no 
ranges). Mosher doesn't treat dilution of an existing SG at all, and
I'm having problems working with Charlie's (especially since he claims
in TNCJOHB that a 50% dilution is a factor of 2.5?) I can't find a good 
treatment in Miller or Line. 


I'm interested in this because I want to understand the function of
non-mashed ingredients in adding SG points after I go to all grain.
I also want to predict my OG better so my hops utilization calculations
can have a prayer of being accurate.


Feel free to email me, I will summarize responses.

Subject: wheat beer follies




continuing my mission of trying to make a decent wheat beer, i made two 
changes to my usual (ok, three batches so far) process (which consists of 6# 
or so of 50/50 wheat/barley extract and an ounce of hallertau):  i steeped a 
pound of wheat at 180 f for 30 minutes, and rinsed with a gallon of 175 f 
(or so) afterwards, and i made up a reasonably full sized starter (750 ml) 
for the 3068 yeast (in the past i have simply dumped the contents of the 
pack after it has swelled).


slightly over 5 gallons went into my 6 gallon carboy.  since i bought the 
carboys (2 batches ago) i've used a blowoff tube, but never had any goop 
blow off.  this time, i forgot to stick the blowoff tube in a bleach 
solution, so i figured it won't matter, i'll just use an airlock (i happened 
to have one which had been sitting in a bleach solution).  i left the carboy 
in the kitchen, and didn't look at it before i went to work the next morning 
(late, you know).  when i got back last evening (about 18 hours after 
pitching) i found the airlock about 10 feet from the carboy, and some pretty 
intense foam crust around the carboy.  i made an emergency strength bleach 
solution and soaked the blowoff tube about 5 minutes, hoping for shock 
decontamination, then stuck the tube into a carboy, with the other end in a 
quart jar of water.  immediately, i got bubbles out of the blowoff at 
slightly more than one per  second.


this morning when i checked, the blowoff tube was filled with yucky stuff, 
as was the water in the jar.  when i went to bed last night (6 hours after 
inserting the blowoff tube) there was nothing visible in the tube and the 
water was clear.  i don't recall how fast it was generating bubbles this 
morning.  should i be worried about the cloudy goop generated overnight, or 
is this a normal consequence of faster fermentation resulting from pitching 
a larger quantity of yeast?  by the way, it smells great.


a second question: how long do y'all let your (german-style) wheat condition 
before putting it in the fridge?  once in the fridge, how long does it take 
for the beer to round out?  my last batch sat at room temperature for a week 
and a half  to two weeks, then went into the fridge; after three weeks in 
the fridge the flavor has improved significantly.  how does this compare 
with your experiences?  i'd hate to drink the last batch up now if it will 
improve further  :^).


thanks,

Hey, this opens up a whole new branch of brewing ...


It would not be hard to implement such an operation. One would only need
to _lower_ equipment and supplies ... naturally lager yeasts would be
required, given the ideal lagering temperatures available underground.


( Hell, I'll bet there were operations during the Prohibition that took
  advantage of this fact. Gives "underground operation" a whole new mean-
  -ing ... :-)


You'd never need to worry about your brew getting contaminated by light.
The bacteria count underground might be lower, and lack of air currents
might facilitate operations, also.


With a small underground stream at hand, you'd have no problem getting
water, and, in fact, would have a ready heatsink with which to chill your
wort, as well.


Best of all, you'll never destroy your kitchen stove, floor, counters and
cupboards again with boilovers.


Be careful climbing back up, though ...                (-:

"I am searching for an elderberry wine recipe. Either a straight wine
 or a melomel recipe would be great."




If you have recipes for wine, or melomel, why not try them - with your
elderberries substituted for a similar fruit ?


Generally, I use about 2.5 - 3.0 pounds of honey, and an equal amount
of pitted-frozen-thawed-mashed-in-bag-dumped-in-hot-wort fruit, per
each gallon of water. This is just a "rule of thumb", which I playfully
ignore with great consistency.        (-:        You should, also.


If the flavor of elderberry is a subtle thing, like strawberries tend
to be, then increase the amount of fruit.


Choose your yeast according to the characteristics you'd like :


        flat:        use white wine yeast
        bubbly:        use champagne yeast


Generally, I see brewing as a finite but unbounded ( growing ) spectrum :

If you absolutely *have* to have something that's edible, consider doing a

increase the possibility, in case of infection(s), that some of the brews
will be drinkable, still ( which will not be the case if they are all done
at the same time ).

I want to brew an American style wheat beer in the next week or two and

extract or partial mash for the first attempt and if anyone has 
recommendations on brands of wheat extract this would be most helpful.  I 
do single temp infusion all grain typically but could handle step infusion 
if the results are worth the extra time.  No decoctions, please.   One of 
my main concerns is overdosing the hops.  


David Draper - could you send me a summary from your related request on 
the Sept. 1 HBD?


The Malt Shop in Wisconsin told me that DWC roasted malts are 
de-bitterized and would have a cleaner flavor compared to domestic 
ones.  Anyone know anything about this?  Is this significant?

Got little or no help on this from the newsgroup, so maybe

hops varieties.

        I'm planning to brew something akin to Papazian's 'Holiday Cheer',
        with perhaps a minor change or two. 
 
        My questions involve yeast and hops.


        I've only used Cascade and NB hops (For pale/amber and for 
        a stout), and wyeast 1056 (American)  and 1084 (irish) 
        yeasts.


        With the following recipe, would there be any particular 
        yeast or hop varieties that would be particularly good
        to use? Or should I just go with the basic 1056 and follow
        Charlie's hop guide (Cascade for bittering, Saaz for aroma)?

There is a very simple trick to preventing kinks while bending metal tubes. 
Fill them tightly with dry sand. You may only need to do this with your

Recently there was a request for a Celis White Clone recipe. Here is a
recipe that I came up with and uploaded to Compuserve in early November.
Thanks to Steve Daniel and Steve Moore from the Home Brew University
BBS (713-923-6418) and my electronic friends on Compuserve who helped
steer me in the right direction by giving me a starting point.


                Pugsley's Pseudo Celis White #5


malt:           4.5 lbs. 6 row (or 2 row)
specialty:      4.0 lbs. Unmalted Wheat (Bulgar from Health Food Store)
                4 grams dried orange peel
                4 grams crushed corriander seeds
                1 tsp. Alpha-Amalase enzyme
                lactic acid
hops:           1 oz. Hallertauer
yeast:          1 pack Wyeast #3056 Bavarian Wheat
optional:       1 tsp. gypsum


                OG 1.041  FG 1.011


Bring 2 gallons water to boil. Add unmalted wheat and hold at 185-195
degrees for 20 minutes. Add cold water and 6 row malt to bring down to
130 degrees. Add 1 tsp. amalase and gypsum (pH 5.3). Allow protein
rest for 25 minutes. Raise temperature to 150 degrees and hold 20
minutes. Complete conversion by raising temperature to 158 degrees and
holding for 20 minutes. Mashout at 168 degrees for 5 minutes. Acidify
sparge water to pH 5.7 with lactic acid. Sparge with 4-5 gallons of
170-180 degree water. Boil wort for 90 minutes. Add hops and crushed
spices 15 minutes before end of boil. Cool wort and pitch yeast.


While this will not fool everyone into thinking that this is the real Celis
White, I was very happy with the outcome. The spices are "up front"
without being overpowering. However, some people like a wallop from the
spices and you will need to experiment with the spice amounts.


After a couple months the spices have faded a bit, so next time I will
double the spices and probably try Wyeast White beer yeast.


This recipe should give you a good starting point with which to
experiment. If anyone else has a recipe for a Celis White clone, or have
any comments or questions on my recipe, please feel free to E-mail me or
post.

                        The Elusive Wit
5# 2-row
5# wheat malt
1 oz Hallertau, 3.2% AAU, 60 minues
 .5 oz Hallertau, 3.2% AAU, 30 minutes
1 oz Saaz, 4.0 %AAU, 20 minutes
1 quart Brewer's Resource Belgian Wit ale yeast starter
3/4 cup corn sugar for priming
1/2 tsp orange peel, added to secondary
1 tsp crushed coriander, added to secondary


OG = 1.048
FG = 1.016




As you can see, this recipe calls for 50 % wheat malt.  I've also
seen recipes which call for 45% un-malted wheat.  The wheat or wheat
malt are what give's the beer it's milky appearance or
"uncorrected chill haze."  The coriander and the orange peel
make for a very interesting flavor profile.  There's also a third
spice, but PC is not willing to divulge it.


The above recipe did very well in the Minnesota Brewfest (300 entrees).
It won first place in the Belgian category (30 entrees), (Judged by John
Isenhauer) and then went on to take Best of Show (Judged by
Michael Jackson, Andy Leith and Isenhauer).

    Here is the recipe from a kit that Austin Homebrew sells.
      3 # What dried malt extract
      2 # Light dried malt extract
      0.5 oz Coriander
      2 oz Saaz Hops  AA 3.9%
      0.3 oz Curacao orange peel
       Windsor Ale yeast


       The extract and hops were added in the usual way.  The coriander
should be crushed.  (Well crushed if you like the taste. )  The orange peels
should be added for the last 10 minutes of the boil.
     The problem with this recipe is it doesn't take into account the lactic
acid sourness of White.  I guess some lactic acid could be added or a
lactobacillus.  I have never done this although I am considering it.
     Well, I have not tried this recipe.  (But I did live a half mile from
the Celis Brewery)  As I said this is what Austin sells.  You might want to
compare it to other recipes you have gotten and see what they have in common.

I too get those dreaded black stains every time I brew. My better half can't
stand it (probably because she is usually the one who finally gets rid of
them). The solution we/she have/has come up with is this:  before you go to
bed soak the stains in bleach; in the morning, scrub.  You'll find that it
requires a lot less scrubbing this way.

Try liquid/jelly paint stripper.  I once cleaned an oven in a caravan that
had been squatted in and then used by children as a wendy house.  The oven
and top had been regularly used without cleaning for several years, and
then sat uncleaned for about five years.  After several attacks of
painstripper,and the use of a high pressure hose, it changed colour.  As it
was a gas cooker, I also had to drill out the holes in the gas rings
because the paintstripper softened the gunk over them, but couldnt work its
way all the way through.  It looked and worked fine afterwards.


The cooker was an old heavy duty enamel finish.  I suggest that you first
try the method on a small spot that isnt too obvious.

    I've used something called "Bar Keepers Friend" which works
  pretty good. You could also try using something nasty like
  lye (wears gloves, eye protection, apron, plenty of ventilation...)
  Lye (sodium hydroxide) will disolve all kinds of organic material.
  This includes skin! I think Bar Keepers Friend should work, I found
  it at my local hardware store.

and he has added forced kettle ventilation to his kettle primarily so they
can increase the level that they fill the kettle to. The forced ventilation
reduces or eliminates any boil overs. This way they can fill the kettle
right up to the top. By doing this he has discovered that his hop
utilization has increase to 40%! These are varified numbers via analysis. He
would like to hear from anyone out there that has any similar experience or
could explain this effect. Sounds like some interesting research here could
be done. He says his boil temperature is 201 deg f. This is due to the
altitude of the brewery and the lower pressure induced by the fans suction.


Micah's number at the brewery is (209)736-BREW


I would think this topic would make for some interesting dialog here as well.
I would like to hear both Mark G. and Glen T. comments.

Subject: Yeast pitching-rate puzzle


Wishing to accentuate maltiness and limit yeasty flavors, I have always
followed the practice of pitching a sizeable starter (1 - 2 quarts of liquid
in active fermentation) for a 5-gallon batch.  But now (in the Zymurgy 1989
special issue on yeast) I come across what looks very much like advice to
actually UNDERPITCH, in order to achieve this purpose.   This of course
flies in the face of the common wisdom on this subject...


So I'd be very grateful if someone could set me straight on why I'm wrong to
conclude from the Zymurgy article that underpitching is a good idea.  I'll
now quote the passage I'm referring to:  


[Extract from:  Yeast Biology and Beer Fermentation, by
  Jean-Xavier Guinard, Mary Miranda and Michael J. Lewis, Ph.D.
  _Zymurgy_, 12, 4  (1989).]


Consistency of beer flavor in the fermentation stage depends on the
kinds and amounts of organic molecules excreted by the yeast; that is,
materials other than alcohol and CO2. Collectively these flavor
compounds often are secondary metabolites formed in small quantities
at different points in the main fermentation. However incidental they
may be to the yeast, they are crucially important to beer flavor. They
account for only a small proportion of the total sugars fermented, but
they comprise many different kinds of compounds in very low
concentrations, many with very low detection thresholds (i.e., easily
tasted at low concentration).  These secondary metabolites originate
in many different metabolic sequences in various parts of the cell.
They have different functions and respond in different ways to the
environment imposed by the fermentation conditions. [...]


Some 90 percent of fermented wort sugar is transformed to alcohol and CO2;
>> the remaining 10 percent is divided about equally between yeast growth and
>> production of flavor compounds. Generally speaking, anything that promotes
>> yeast growth relative to fermentation will tend to reduce the amount of
>> flavor compounds produced by directing the carbon of the fermented sugar
>> into yeast mass. Such things as highly aerated wort, low yeast inoculum,
>> ideal growth temperature, very nitrogenous wort, for example, would have
>> this moderating effect. Conversely, suppressing yeast growth relative to
>> fermentation will tend to have the opposite effect; e.g., very high or low
>> temperatures, high yeast pitching rate, high gravity wort and unaerated
>> worts will tend to promote production of yeast flavor compounds. Thus
fermentation may be viewed as a pipe through which carbon from sugar flows
on its way to alcohol and CO2; the pipe has small holes in it through which
some carbon can escape as flavor compounds. The pressure in the pipe, how
full it is and the length of time it is in use all help determine the amount
of leakage of flavor compounds into the beer.  Fermentation bouquet arises
from a host of volatile compounds among which higher alcohols and esters
feature prominently [etc.]...
