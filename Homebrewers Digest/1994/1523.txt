Subject: Hops: To dry or not?


Steve Lichtenberg asked for my opinion on the difference between dried and
fresh (undried) hops. First of all, let me say that if you're really
curious, try it on a small batch--very small I'd say-- and see if you like
the result.


Freshly picked hops are somewhere around 80% water and dried are less than
10%. In addition, the drying process (140 F for 10 or 12 hours with *lots*
of air flow) oxidizes many of the essential oil compounds present in the
green hop flowers. Bad you say? Well, yes and no. Taste panels have, on
more than one occasion, rejected beer made with undried hops, especially
when compared to a similar beer brewed with normally dried hops. It is
evident that oxidation of some of the aroma compounds is necessary before
hops really become hoppy; this is especially true for noble varieties. Thus
it isn't alpha-humulene or beta-caryophyllene that you smell in hopped
beer, but their oxidation (and fermentation) products instead.


Despite the fact that some oxidation is good, too much is disastrous for
both aroma and bittereing compounds. Don't let anyone rationalize inferior
packaging with the statement "These here noble hops need to be oxidized,
that's why we use paper bags and staples" All the oxidation hops *ever*
need occurs during the drying process. Do everything in your power to
prevent it from there on out. Get your hops from a reputable supplier you
trust, or your garden, and store them in barrier packaging in the freezer.


I'd be very interested in the results of anyone who has tried this. If you
use undried hops in your beer, are you "wet hopping?" ;^)

I have made several fruit beers, all with extract, and had very good results
(my girlfriend keeps trying to convince me to brew nothing but fruit beers). 
I've always added the fruit to the brewpot after the boil in order to sanitize
the fruit but not set the pectins.  After letting the fruit steep for 10
minutes or so, I put the brewpot in an icewater bath to cool it to pitching
temperatures with the fruit still in it.  I then dump the entire contents of my
brewpot into my primary, again with the fruit.  Primary fermentation usually
lasts 10-14 days.  When I transfer to secondary I leave the fruit behind.  I
know you said you do single stage fermentation, but I find two stage better for
fruit beers.  Leave in the secondary for a few weeks, rack and bottle.  The
beer will get better and better with age (I brewed a raspberry ale with
Wyeast's Belgian ale yeast that I started New Year's Eve.  I wish I had a way
to make it last forever, the flavor is unbelieveable at this point and I'm down
to my last 15 bottles).

Subject: Iodophor CORRECTION/Break material


In response to Tony's question about Iodophor, I posted the wrong
dilutions for BTF and BEST Iodophor.


The correct dilutions are:


12.5 ppm : 1/2 oz. in 5 gallons.


25 ppm : 1 oz in 5 gallons.




I've been using 1 oz. in 5 gallons with good results.  In response to
Mark's question:


>So if the object is not wasting money: why use 25 ppm? The rinse wastes
>water as well as the Iodophor.


It is because I will reuse the sanitizing solution quite a bit in one
brewing session (sanitize several kegs or six cases of bottles) and I
do rinse either with water or cheap beer (depending on the smell of the
water on brewing day) that unenlightened friends have left at my house.
Please note that not rinsing is only valid if you AIR DRY the item.
I sanitize just before use, so I must rinse, not having the time to
wait for air drying.

If you mean, "don't worry about the cold break," then yes, it does not
mean another transfer, however, if you are siphoning through the counterflow
into a settling vessel and then siphoning again into your fermenter after
some time, which, I believe, is what Phil originally was suggesting.
I've read a great many homebrewers are including a cold break settling step.
Remember when we had the "let the yeast eat cold break and THEN siphon off
debate" a few years ago?


Personally, I chill with an immersion chiller, pick up the kettle and pour
the cooled wort into the carboy through a funnel.  I do leave *some* of the
break at the bottom of the kettle along with any hop pellets that made it
through the hop bags, but generally, I don't worry too much about the break
in either my all-grain or my extract batches (incidentally Jim, about 50/50
over the last 6 months, thanks to better time management).  I do use a
blowoff tube for 90% of my beers and yes, some (most?) of the trub does seem
to get blown out.


Regarding the "issue of early racking prior to adequate diacetyl reduction,"
I don't think this is that important of an issue -- I believe that there
is adequate yeast in suspension.  For example, in a 1.074 Bock that I fermented
at 45F with Wyeast #2308 "Munich Lager," I racked after 2 weeks, did no
diacetyl rest and had no noticable diacetyl in the beer.  Just a datapoint.

Subject: yeast popsicles / fruit


I have used the parallel yeast propagation technique from the yeast faq 
with great success.  However, three bottles of propagated Wyeast 2565 were 
frozen when my refrigerator was inadvertantly turned down.  I assume that 
these are total wastes now (headed for that big cool, aerated wort in the 
sky, so to speak...).  Is this correct?  I would hate to pour out viable 
yeast, but it's pretty darn cheap compared to other ingredients and time.  
In the future, if the propagated bottles of yeast were not stored in my 
fridge, how long would they be good for?


This also made me think about freezing fruit before adding it to a 
secondary.  Would freezing sterilize the fruit?  I suppose that you could 
add the frozen fruit to a sanitized carboy and siphon the beer on top of it 
before it completely thawed.  Of course, it the bacteria, etc. was viable 
upon thawing, you would be hosed.

              Hi, all, this is my first post to the digest, after
            having been a lurker for a while. I have been brewing
            for about 2 years, have made the step to all grain,
            at least I do single infusion mashes for ales
            ( my favorite style anyway).


              In addition to all grain, I have cultured some yeast and
            regularly use the liquid yeast's from Wyeast, ( I cultured
            some yeast from "sierra Nevada" with success!), don't mean
            to boast, but all I did was drink the
            beer (that was easiest part)!, pour the last ounce or so
            into a starter wort and about a week later I had a pitchable
            amount of yeast that made some rather nice ale, IMHO :).


              Anyway, to finally get to the point, I made up some
            sterile wort a few months ago to make yeast starters,
            storing it in ball jars.


              I processed the wort as I would canned veggies (boiling
            the jars for at least 10 minutes). Just now I was looking at
            the boxes of pickles I canned up about a week or so ago and
            noticed that the maker of the jars suggests using them
            for freezing as well as canning, so the next thought I had
            was "Why not freeze sterile wort?"
            Anyone ever try this? Any feedback would be appreciated.
            Also I have enjoyed reading the posts for the past few weeks
            although I have not been a strong contributor.

   A lazy man's option is "Dried Orange Peel" from the spice section of
   your supermarket.  Don't be concerned with the preservative content 
   of the "store bought" product.  The preservatives will have no 
   adverse affects on your yeast in the amounts you will be using (you're

Subject: Preventing boilover




     This may be dumb; I've only been brewing for 9 months, with 22 batches
     (extract/specialty) quite literally under my capacious belt.  But my 
     method of dealing with boilover is to *stir* the two pots I boil in
     as the boilover begins.  By stirring frequently, I can get both pots
     to a roiling boil without any spillover.
     
     The drawback, of course, is that you have to be present and watching
     the pots as the boil begins.  But I don't mind sitting there having
     a beer and looking for that thick crusty foam to appear on top of the
     boil--that's the sign that boilover is imminent.

Subject: Malt house terminology




Quick question for any of you who happen to know about
malt houses.


I've been reading up on how malts are produced, and picked up
a book from the U.K. called "Steeped in Tradition" in which
they described two types of malt house: the traditional floor
malting, and the pneumatic malting. They seem to group every
type of modern, mechanized malting under the category
"pneumatic", which includes a discussion of the development
of the Saladin box.


When I read Briggs et al., "Brewing and Malting Science", they
discuss various mechanized maltings separately, i.e., there's
a section for pneumatic maltings, followed by a discussion of
the Saladin box, followed by a discussion of towers and
conveyers etc.


Soooo. Is it correct to lump all mechanized maltings under the
category "pneumatic", or is pneumatic malting really just one
of many methods for mechanically malting grain???

From: Bob Paolino
      Research Analyst
Subject: big krausen and self-flaming brewers


When I read the arrogant post from BREWS`at`Delphi.com, I figured that it
was so outrageous as to be self-flaming and didn't bother responding.
But I'm glad that that kind of stuff did get put in its place. Now that
several people have said what needed to be said, let's move the digest
back to beer and brewing....


Curtis Speaker wrote of his experience with a blown out airlock and
quickly fashioning an improvised blow-off tube. I did much the same
thing once, although I use the 3-piece airlocks and simply cleaned up
the crud-filled one, replaced it without the other two pieces and
attached a hose to the stem for my blowoff. Worked like a charm.


Now, however, I'm able to avoid that problem completely. I'm guessing
that his plastic primary was one of those taller 6-7 gallon white opaque
fermenters from a starter kit with the very tight-fitting lid. For a
primary, I now use one of those shorter, fatter 7 gallon "semi-opaque"
plastic wine fermenters. I first bought one to have an extra primary
when I started having more than one batch going at once (actually, it
was when I had a beer already going and was going to do a cider
 ...whatever). At first, I was a little annoyed that the lid was not quite
so tight-fitting and thought about sending it back. I'm glad I didn't,
and have since bought yet another one.


The lid does "kind of" seal--it doesn't just sit on top--but it's not a
_tight_ seal. When things get active, the less-than-tight fit gives the
excess CO2 a release. The airlock may not look so busy, but the slight
outward bulge of the lid shows that there is indeed activity in there.
The gas "blanket" on top of the beer keeps the nasties (that's a
technical term ;->) away, so the slightly loose fit of the lid shouldn't
be a problem. After all, some beers are done in _open_ fermenters. Just
as a precaution against something I shouldn't be worrying about anyway,
I wrap some handiwrap(tm) around the outside where the lid fits the
bucket. That keeps me from worrying about anything getting in before
respiration/reproduction/fermentation gets going.


I haven't had a need for a blowoff tube since switching. If someone
knows of any reason why that's _not_ such a good idea (aside from a
recommendation to switch to a glass primary), please reply. Otherwise,
I've been happy with the results.


P.S. Why do you make the reference to the BATF and your 14th batch? 14*5
(assuming they've all been 5 gallon batches) is way less than the 200
gallons/household limit.

When I used to use one of these, I avoided adding the extra liquid in 
the dead space between the buckets by putting in capped water-filled beer 
bottles. I filled the clean bottles totally with water and then used a 
standard bottle cap. I'd also preheat the bottles in a bucket of hot

I have used them a couple of times, particulary in mashes with large wheat
proportions. The last time I used them was in my pLambic, the grain bill
consisting of 18 lbs of barley and 14 lbs of _raw_ wheat, ground to near
flour (talk about a stuck sparge waiting to happen!). I used about 1/3 to
1/2 pound of hulls in that, and I think it was plenty. That was for 32 lbs
of grain, also (No, it was not a five gallon batch ;-> ).
 
I think a 1/4 pound would be more than enough for your typical 5 gallon
weizen batch.
 
I brewed an old ale recently, and used the Wyeast Scottish ale yeast (1728).
I had a pretty good starter of it with at least a cup of pure slurry. The
fermentation of course took right off, went like the devil and finished a day
and a half later. I racked it, and the next day had another 3/4 inch of
flocculation (which I expected), but the beer was still pretty 'milky' looking.
Two days later I racked it again, and still that milky appearance.
 
In all my batches it has only taken at most two rackings to get bright beer.
The only variable this time was the 1728 yeast, which I have not used before.
Other than that, pretty standard batch: infusion mash, saccharification
`at` 156F, mash out at 170F, sparge water never getting above 185F, plenty of
hot and cold break, etc. OG 1074, FG 1018.
 
Can there really be *that* much yeast in suspension ? And does this yeast take
that long to settle out ?
 
TIA for any advice or anecdotes,
 
Mitch

   I think you're missing the point. The primary reason the HBD exists is 
the exchange of information about homebrewing. That which you call drivel
may be of educational interest to someone else. It's not for you to 
validate the input of others.

Indeed iodophors are a whole family of compounds, but that 12.5 ppm is
valid for some of them only, as it is a measure of *total* iodine. What
counts is really the *free* iodine concentration. Iodophors should be
viewed as "iodine buffers", in which there is an equilibrium between free
iodine (which does the work) and complexed iodine (which acts as backup). 
It so happens that with most of the iodophors we commonly use, the ideal
concentration of 5 ppm of free iodine is achieved at 12.5 ppm of total
iodine. Each brand is calibrated in such a way that the recommended
working concentration will yield 5 ppm of free iodine. 


> Higher levels will give faster results, but rinsing is a good idea (as
> long as you have reasonably clean water, I use hot hot water).


Higher levels do not give faster results above the recommended
concentration (in a first approximation) because of the buffering effect: 
more iodophor means more reserve, but not higher free iodine. It is only
if considerable amounts of iodine are consumed, for instance when cleaning
the skin of a patient, that higher amounts are recommended, in order to
make up for the iodine consumed. For our purposes, the amount consumed by
clean equipment should be infinitesimal. 


Iodophors with 5 ppm free iodine will sterilize completely anything in
less than 5 minutes (except for one or two very odd spores), and kill any
common microorganism (though not their spores) in 15 seconds. 


There is a wealth of data on the subject dating from the mid-50's, at the
time when iodophors where introduced as the preferred hospital antiseptic.

        The title is the Brewers Companion, and it is a large size book

        The crux of the book are its computer-like "spreadsheets" for

Subject: Iodophors


I was recently talking to an industrial formulator of food sanitizers.  He 
told me that in many uses in the food industry it is actually illegal to
rinse after using idophor.  So if you are concerned about ingesting 
iodophor, you probably already are.  Of course the relative exposure vs. 
homebrew equipment sanitizing is undoubtedly different. 


One of the main reasons I like iodophor is the speed vs. bleach combined 
with no rinse.  If you are in a bind during a brewing/bottling process (who 
hasn't been?) and need something sanitized quick it's great to have around.
For those who aren't aware you can sanitize with iodophor in 2 minutes.


If you're happy with bleach and don't have any problems the time factor 
is the only reason I would see for using iodophor.  According to the 
formulator mentioned above iodophor is no more effective than bleach in 
killing undesirables (assuming you are using both correctly).

I had a really good professor in college.  At the time I thought he was a
raging *ssh*le, but he taught me a really useful lesson.  We should always
try to be able to identify those things we don't know.


Mr. Keegan has made at least two errors above.  I am sure he can find
the math error on his own.  The other one is subtle.


It is problematic to try to compare results reported outside your own
brewery since you do not know the conditions under which those results
were obtained.


Mr. Keegan should be pleased with his fine extraction rates.  He
seems to understand the importance of and pays attention to 1) time,
2) temperature, and 3) pH.


I, too, am please with my extraction rates.  They are higher than we
usually see reported in this forum, and higher than any we saw reported
in HBD1517.  This detail is not important.  I have used buckets in my
brewery.  I have used manifolds in my brewery.  I have mashed on the
range top.  I have mashed in the oven.  I have mashed in a cooler.  I
have infusion mashed.  I have step mashed.  I have decoction mashed.


In general, its not the equipment that dictates extraction rates.  Its
time, temperature, pH, and a few other lesser details.


For those of you considering going all grain soon, build, use, and buy
equipment with which you are comfortable.  All of the mash/lauter systems
discussed in this forum work well and all are capable of excellent
extraction rates.

Being my first week on the HBD list, I was disappointed to see a few

However I looked a little more closely and found that one particular 
fellow, not to mention names BREWS`at`Delphi.com :), is a subscriber to a

would make a suggestion to that individual to start his own interest 
group on that area and not subject others, that would like to share 
information with like-minds/interests, to his ill-minded behavior. NUF-Said.


Sorry for the Drivel!!!  I just brewed an All grain E.S.B. last Friday 
and had a little problem I had never had before. Has this happened to you.


I am familier with fermentation locks, but, after this experience I'm 
beginning to wonder:) I know that the temperature of the water/liquor in 
the lock must be close to the temp of the brew or we will get leakage 
from the lock into the primary.   


what happened,
1) I added my wort to my fermenter at about 80 degrees,
2) I pitched my bag o yeasties, I normally do a starter, but I didn't have 
time.
3) I noticed lots of bubbles in my fermenter due to my vigorous aeration.
4) I then placed my lock on the fermenter.
5) Lag time approximately, too long 28 hrs.
6) I noticed all during the lag that my lock was leaking and me being 
very worried about that, took the lock off and replaced it letting air be 
sucked into the fermenter :(.  


Is this Brew doomed?  There was probably a small amount of water that got 
into the fermenter and lots of air.


I eventually had vigorous activity for 3 full days, but I am wondering 
how things will turn out.


Drivel, well not to me?  If anyone has had this problem, please Email me 
directly, or post it, someone else may have this problem in the future.

Subject: Worthless Post about Artic Ice




Text item: Text_1


Regarding the spelling of "Artic" Ice beer, here in Oregon I think it's against 
the law to use the name of a place in your brand name, unless the place name is 
accurate.  For example, Oregon wineries can't call their wine "Chablis" or 
"Champagne" because the wines aren't from those regions.  But they can produce 
Chardonnay, because that's the name of a grape.  Likewise, breweries can't make 
"Russian Stout" because it's not from Russia.  But the Deschutes Brewery is near
the Deschutes River, so that's OK.  (This rule doesn't apply to beverages 
produced out of state, so we might still see California Chablis in the stores.)


Other states may also have such rules.  So even though this ice beer belongs in 
the arctic (buried deep), it wasn't brewed there.  Perhaps this is the reason 
for the "Artic" spelling.  It's pretty lame though, and opens up the possibility
of more misspellings such as "Belgun Ales".


P.S.  India Pale Ale doesn't seem to apply to this rule.  But even the original 
wasn't made in India, so maybe that's why.

I really can't help you with that. I radically change my brew styles
on an almost monthly basis. I can go back through my notes and see if I
can see a trend, but I don't do a complete flavor analysis on each
batch. My notes on flavor usually are how the batch deviates from what I
was attempting. Not the best method because I forget a few years later
what exactly I was attempting to brew on that occasion. This is probably
why Jim and Micah are brewing professionally and I'm not. (sigh)


As for the guy who doesn't want to see newbie stuff on the HBD, do him a
favor and unsubscribe him now. That way he won't have to see it. :-) The
HBD has been a very valuable resource for me over the years. Especially
since the ammount of information for doing small batch size brews has
been really lacking.

Subject: cracked carboy


I just have to share an experience I had last Monday. I was cleaning a
carboy, in preparation for racking my latest to the secondary. It was full
of sterilizing solution. After soaking for a while, I picked it up out of
the sink... and it just kept right on going over the top. The carboy (moving
in slow motion by the way) dropped in a lovely silent path from the counter
top to the floor. When they say "do not bump" perhaps they are referring to
a 4 ft. drop onto linoleum (sp?).


Glass, water everywhere, all in all it was a beautiful sight. Fortunately
the local Revere/Corning outlet store sells glass carboys (cheaper than
the local brew store) and they were still open, so I was able to rack to
the secondary, after cleaning up and running to the store.


The one thing I am VERY grateful for (besides the fact that all my blood
remained within the confines of my skin) was that it was full of sterilizer
(the beer gods were looking after me). After tasting the beer (bock from
extract, Hallertaurer hops and Yeast Labs Lager yeast) I was even more
glad. I could have sat down and drank it after 5 days in the primary. I
can't wait till it's done.


BTW large shards of glass with a great deal of energy behind them can
really cut up linoleum. Oh well, sometimes I am glad I rent. So if anyone
has need of about 3 lbs of broken glass I can make you a deal.

  Sorry, but I couldn't help but join in about the "useless posts".  I've
been brewing for about a year, reading HBD for about 8 months, and even 
managed to answer a few questions posted here. I have a Ph.D. in chemistry,

would be dead.  Newbies (myself included) - keep asking those questions and 
we all win.  'nuff said.

Subject: Lazy posts


Now while I believe Bruce Stevens may have been having a bad day when he made
the post re lazy posters, and used stronger language that was appropriate, I
must echo some of his sentiments.  I know from the deluge of flammage his post
drew that it is not PC to flame our brew education deficient brethren, but
I also belive that they should try to educate themselves a little before 
making asinine posts.  Not that I am bothered about the space the questions
take up - I skip such posts as I do many others, and those posters have as 
much right to post their questions as anyone else, but really, many of the
questions could be better answered by another real live breathing homebrewer
or homebrew supply retailer, or by reading.  Some people are just a little
bit too joined at the hip to computers.  It is my opinion that certain
information can be far more readily obtained by judicious phone calls, 
even if one are two are finding out where to call. 


hbd is great for trading tips, getting into pedantic arguments about wheat 
ratios, the benefit of decoctions, etc., but is a poor substitute for
the basic books, or a knowledgable homebrewer or retailer for the basics.


Some of my homebrew opinions.  Copper manifolds are much superior than holey
buckets in my experiences - less trouble with clogging, breakthrough, and
much faster clearing of wort, and greater efficiency.  However, all manifolds
are not created equal, and mine is at times a maintenance pain in the ass (so
much so that I had to use an em for my last batch and it did seem less
efficient, although otherwise performed up to the high standards of jsp 
products).


The key to wheat is decoction and a sloooow sparge (i.e. restrict flow at the
beginning - the overall time will be much less in the end than if you start
at full speed) - rice hulls are just creating channels and preventing efficient
loitering.

Mark A. Stevens <stevens`at`stsci.edu> asks about fruit additions:


I've never had a problem with fruit additions to secondary.


I usually don't add whole fruit, but juice it instead.  I then
pasturize the juice at 170F for 30 minutes.  Careful that you don't
let it boil or you'll set the pectins giving you a haze.  A little
pectinase will help should this happen.  I then add the juice to the
secondary (which is large enough to deal with a renewed fermentation)
and rack the beer on top of it.


If you want to add whole fruit (disclaimer time folks:  I ain't never
done what I'm about to say, but it makes sense) It would seem to me
that the fruit can be sanitized with a meta-bisulfite solution, rinsed,
then added.

Subject: More on Rice Hauls/Hulls


Ok, I think I need to do some clarifying.  (I had no idea!)


First of all, no, I didn't mean to say "hulls" when I said "hauls".  The
package that I bought actually said "Rice Hauls" on the side.  No brand
label (except for the store) and no ingredient list.  The look of the
"hauls" (hulls, whatever) was like straw.  Each piece about 1/2" long, and
then split on the long axis.  It made me think of the leaves or stalk of
the rice plant rather than a husk of the rice kernel itself.  I'm going
back to that store in the near future (it's the backup store, but it's
handy when I don't have an ingredient during the protien rest) and I'll
double check.


Ok, next point.  The *taste* of the wort wasn't fouled by the hauls, but
rather they were inedible.  You get this nice mouthful of grain and then
hitting the hauls was like a speed bump.  Couldn't be chewed, couldn't be
swallowed - so, spit it out.  The hauls themselves have *no taste*
whatsoever.  It was like chewing on fibers.  So, no problems with the taste
of the sweet wort and no problems with the taste of the beer.  We just had
to deal with a thinner runoff than expected due to an extremely loose mash.


Final point.  What I meant to say was that if I'd really thought about it
and hadn't been so tired, I would have recirculated *all* the runoff.  All
6 1/2 gallons of it in order to try and extract more sugars.  The grains on
the top of the bed were indeed spent, but I think that those in the center
of the mash, and at the bottom, still had sugars in them.  I'd not have
redone the entire mash, just the sparging.


So, back to the same question..  has anyone else tried these?


Thanks to Ed, Norm and John (so far ... haven't checked my mail again) for
their prompt replies and our quest for clarification continues ...
