Subject: "Nutty Ale"




Yes Bruce Stevens, so as not to be confused with a "worthless 
post from a lazy brewer" I checked TCJOHB and asked all my 
brewing buddies, so having gone through the prerequisite fire 
drill I have a question for the collective HBD knowledge.  I just 
kegged a Belgian style ale and had a little taste.  I was 
surprised to find that the beer tasted, well, uh... kinda 
"nutty?".  It had a mild sherry type of taste.  Being a rather 
strong ale, it also had an alcohol nose.  I didn't find the 
flavor to be unpleasant, although it really doesn't taste like 
beer.  For all you beer judge/sleuth types here is the grain 
bill:


For 5 gallons.
10  lbs Munton & Fison English pale malt
2   lbs Munton & Fison German Munich
1/2 lbs M & F carapils
1/2 lbs M & F crystal 


I used Wyeast London Ale yeast.  Mashed 90 minutes at 152 
degrees. Sparged at 170 degrees.


I know that somebody will suggest that the TASTER is probably 
nutty, not the beer, but I really would like to figure this out.


TIA

Subject: Hop Debate-  How Dry I Am/ LEAF hops,blowoff / Peat and Smoking


Mark stevens`at`stsci.edu talked about,
The hop debate.  or...How to cure the curing problem!


>In HBD 1519, John (the Coyote) Wyllie said this was not the best
idea because the three things that damage hops are oxygen, light,
and heat.
>I hope this didn't settle the issue for folks, because I don't think
John is 100% correct, and Richard's idea seems to have a lot of
merit.


*   What, you question the words of the Oracle!  Oh wait, that's not me!
Honestly, I hope noone ever takes what I say as law!  I get all my info
from ACME catalogs, and they are riddled with editing errors!


>In Mark Garetz's book ... spread on screens... heat ... 140 degrees F
 ...water content drops... <from> 80% to about 8%.


 ...light bulb in a vented box ... close to that temperature range. 
 ...airflow...to carry away the moisture and John's concern about oxygen 
is not right for the drying phase. The concern about light also seems wrong. 
We worry about ultraviolet light (FLUORESCENT bulbs) damaging
iso-alpha-compounds in a finished beer, but I'm not sure it's much 
of a concern in the drying phase---especially given that Richard is talking
about an INCANDESCENT bulb, which does not produce light of
the same spectra as a fluorescent bulb. Similarly, given that
commercial practice is to dry at 140 degrees, and that heat
is known to promote drying, a slight heat during the drying
stage seems completely appropriate.


*Ok.  Concerns noted.  Problems with my theories, noted.


Be aware, light IS a problem.  An incandescent bulb may not have the SAME
spectrum as a flourescent, or sunshine, there there is some overlap
(don't have a physics text handy, and if I go to the basment to get it
I'll start playing with my fermenting beers!)  Light WILL damage hops.
If you don't believe me, take some out of your freezer, and sit them under
anykind of light for a week, or a few months.  Result? Brown hops. not good.


Oxygen will oxidize lupulin glands.  They turn from a nice bright yellow
to a dingy orange. The smell changes from fresh bitter essence to bad cheese.
I admit, I don't know how quickly that can happen during drying, but my
thrust is to minimize the opportunity.  Get 'em dried, get em frozen.
Brew with them, be happy and hoppy all at the same time!  Drying is necessary
for storage, so it's the lesser of two evils.  BUT that's why I was trying
to find out if it is in anyway NECESSARY, or can one brew directly with
fresh picked, green, water filled hop cones!? Still no answer to convince me.
(FWIW:  My beer fridge had a light bulb which did not go off when the door
closed (in case anyone ever wondered!) and I had a beer go skunky from it.)


I haven't seen what M.Garetz has to say about it, but I'm glad someone has
and is willing to share it with us.  Beach and other sources also state 
that hops are heated to dry them.  BUT...they are heated with warm air
moving past the hops, not radiant heat from light bulbs.  NOW...if you
were to construct a dryer with a heating area, and push that warm air
onto the hops w/o the light itself hitting the hops...I'd be on your side!
Another option is a hair dryer, or small portable heater.  Some simple and
cheap heaters have thermostats built in which switch them on and off.
That is a good thing!  Beach describes an elaborate dryer made from an old
stylist shop's hair dryer (the kind Lucy sits under and gossips w/the ladies)


It depends on where you are.  Our desert climate here in Utah makes for quick
drying in two days just sitting on a screen in the dark of my garage or shed.
Granted, it creeps up to the nineties in there, and we have VERY low humidity.


Take home lesson:  Minimize the factors which will reduce the essentail 
essences of hops qualities.  Dry gently, quickly, and brew often!


***
Curt <css2`at`oas.psu.edu>  sed something about his airlock/blowoff


 ...attach tube onto airlock...as a blowoff...
*   It's one of my regulars. I do have a 1" blowoff also. But use both.


"I would not recommend this idea if you use leaf hops; "
                                           -------------
Aaaargh! There it is again!  You don't use the LEAVES from hops, but the 
flowers, cones, or as terminology that is acceptable WHOLE hops. Not leaf.
Flake is also an semi-acceptable term, but indicates rough handling!


Pellets can much things up even more, at least as much! Usually WHOLE hops
or pressed (not pelletized) are, or easily can be, left behind in the kettle.
Ye- 'ol copper (or stainless) scrubbie does the trick just fine!


Fruits are another potential disaster area for airlocks/blowoff.
Just ask the peach users of recent discovery!  Be warned- even adding fruit to
a secondary that has pretty well subsided can instigate a renewed SPLURGE of
activity (technical term, look it up in a dictionary!). 


Advice?  Nah, that's not what the digest it for.  BS-ing stroking egos, THAT's
what the digest is for!
    But here's some free advice ANYWAY-  leave a lot of headspace if you are 
adding fruit, and plan on it floating to the top for quite a while.
I've even gone from a glass carboy to a bucket secondary (yes- PLASTIC!)
to add fruit. Makes it easier to get into the fermenter, easiery to get out,
and less likely to OVERGLOODGE an airlock.


***
Peat Wood:  Maybe I just had a brain fart.  I thought I read that somewhere 
and hung onto it.  Perhaps it was the M.Jackson's beerhunter segment on
Smoked Beers, coming from wood fires being used to dry malt, and smoke them
all at once.  I too checked my dictionary, and also found no refernce to 
peat wood. Maybe it was Teak. So call me an idiot!  People have been known to!


I also looked up Peck, cuz it wa there and caught my eye:
    Peck1 (pek) n. Dry Measure = 8 quarts or one-quarter of a bushel. A lot,
    a peck of trouble.
    
    Peck2 v. 1. to strike or nip or pick up with the beak. 2. to make (a hole) 
    with the beak. 3. <my favorite> to kiss lighlty and hastily. PECK n. 1 a 
    stroke or nip made with the beak. 2. a light hasty kiss.  
    Peck'er  <I'll skip that!>


BUT:  I will stand by my guns that a charcoal fire is better for smoking
fish or grains than a propane BBQ.  That's not to say you CAN'T do it with
propane, or that the results would be crap, but just that it's BETTER with
the real thing!   And I ain't talkin' Coca Cola Jack!

Here comes flame # 23,912:


Let me paraphrase Bruce P. Stevens: "Bitch, moan, bitch, moan...lazy
worthless newbies...bitch,moan. I need some judges." That's awfully
ballsy to make a statement like that and then ask the HBD for help. If I
was in Maine in November and I was a certified judge (which I hope to
be some day), I certainly would not be a judge for your competition.
Moreover I hope people boycott your competition as a show for how
unpopular that statement was. I for one am grateful for all the help I
received from the HBD when I started this hobby a year ago. Don't
computers made for gods have a page down key?


I recently moved to the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids, Iowa area and am
looking for homebrew shops and homebrew clubs around here. Can
someone point me in the right direction. Private E-mail is fine as I wouldn't
want to clutter up Bruce's E-mail with worthless drivel.

Howdy, all,


Now, I'll admit right up front that I've never dried a hop in my life (even
though I am lookin' forward to it about a year from now), but why is everyone
worried about oxygen, heat, & light exposure to the hops during drying when the
little fellas have been sitting outside in the full sun all summer long?


Happy brewing,

Did someone bring up the subject of errors in Zymurgy?


I was excited when I read in the latest issue that a new brewery, the
Bandon Brewing Company, would be opening up right here in Salt Lake City,
Utah.  Unfortunately, no one around here had ever heard of it.  Well, after
a couple long distance phone calls to Zymurgy and the AOB, I was finally
able to learn that the Bandon Brewing Company would not be opening in Salt
Lake City, but instead had chosen Bandon, Oregon (or was it Washington?) as
the site for their new brewery.  Go figure.

Having read MALT PREZ's (brews`at`delphi.com) worthwhile post, I
knew he was in for flames.  So I thought I would take a look
through some back issues of HBD to see if he had in fact been
blessing the digest with his own worthwhile posts (since so many
other brewers who take the time to post are "lazy"), and
therefore might be undeserving of the heat.  I mean, let's take a
deep breath and pause before we flame, right?


I looked the most recent 320 or so digests.  MALT PREZ posted
*once* (good thing he's not lazy).  I've taken the liberty to
recapture some of the more worthwhile highlights:


> THE EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD WITH THEM IS VERY GOOD AND THE

> LOCK IT UP OR YOUR FEMALE FRIENDS WILL SCARF IT ALL ON YOU.

Oooooh, Love God!  At least in his latest worthwhile post he got

Subject: Blackberry Weizenbock Recipe/Coffee Porter Recipe/ Pumpkin Ale Question


Greetings and salutations to all!  I would first like to thank all who 
responded to my post in #1405 re:Cranberry Wheat recipe.  Well I guess I 
was a little out of season as I couldn't find any cranberries (not even 
frozen).  Insteat I decided upon blackberries, frozen blackberries from 
my local Grand Union.  The recipe I came up with (thanks to SUDS 3.0 -no 
affiliation, no flames please!) is as follows:


        0.28# 90L Crystal                        3# Light DME
        6.6# can Ireks 100% Wheat syrup                1oz 4.1% Hallertauer (Boil)
        0.5oz 3.8% Mt. Hood (Finish)                5# Frozen Blackberries
        Wyeast 3068 Wheinstephen Wheat w/1.020 starter
Steeped grains to 190degF, added extracts and boiled a la Papazian. Added 
Mt. Hood and 36oz blackberries last 5min.  Cooled and brought up to total 
volume of 5.25 gallons.  Saved 32oz wort (and 10ml yeast slurry) for 
krausen. Pitched `at` 76degF.  Primary fermentation: 5 days `at` 68-70degF.  
Racked to secondary and added 3lb frozen blackberries, 7 days `at` 
68-70degF.  16 days `at` 56-60degF.  O.G.: 1.068  F.G.: 1.017


It's been in the bottle for about 5 months now and IMOH it's fantastic.  
At first the sourness of the berries was too prominent but it has 
mellowed nicely.


Next of my wacky recipies is something I like to call Kenyan Koffee 
Porter.  It is a robust porter with 1/2lb Kenyan coffee beans steeped 
until almost boil.


        1# Black Patent                        3.3# John Bull Unhopped Dk. LME        
        3# Lt. DME                        0.75oz 4.2% Tettnanger (finish)
        0.5oz 12.4% Chinook (boil)        1/2# Kenyan coffee beans
        Wyeast ESB liquid w/1.040 starter (IMHO it's better than 1.020)
Crushed beans and black patent.  Removed black patent `at` 180degF and 
coffee `at` 200degF.  Proceed through with rest.  Pitched `at` 68degF.  Primary 
for 4 days `at` 70degF.  Racked to secondary and its been a week so far with 
signs of minimal (1 bubble/3-5min) fermentation. 


It tasted pretty good at racking time, maybe 1/4lb too much black patent 
but hey, it seem darn drinkable.


Now that I've provided some info, I'd like to receive some.  I want to 
brew a pumpkin ale to help celebrate the fall harvest season.  Anyone 
have any all extract, extract/speciality recipies they would like to 
share.  Private e-mail sounds good to me.  TIA


Have a hoppy!

Subject: Responses to SG question


The general consensus was that losing a half gallon would easily drop the
SG as experienced. For your enlightenment, I will post a couple of the 
calculations.


Another common comment was a reminder to be sure I took the sample from a
well-mixed wort, not just the lighter stuff at the top. I have taken the
liberty of editing this out, as it was present in nearly all responses.


FWIW, I mixed my wort so well that I had 2 inches of hops in the bottom of
the sample jar ...


Thanks for all your help!


********************************************************************
Contributed S.G. from ingredients = X (unknown).
Measured S.G. of 5 gallons (3 gallons water, 2 gallons wort) = 1.044.


Since loss was 20% (25% of result), then you would get X= 1 + (44*1.25)/1000
= 1.055


So, I guess maybe your original guess of 1.058 isn't too bad.


Also, depending on how you crushed your crystal and how it was steeped, you 
might get less than optimum yield from it.  Hard to say.

In HBD1517 you asked about SG formulas:


I've used the formula (I've posted this to HBD before)


                  [#DME + 0.8#LME + 0.7#GRAINS]*0.042
 O.G. = 1.000 +  ----------------------------------
                          gallons


where # means pounds.  This formula uses 1.042 for a pound of
DME (dry malt extract) in a gallon of water, about 1.034 for 
LME (liquid malt extract), and about 1.029 for speciality
grains.  


I'm not sure where I've seen the 1.042 figure (probably Charlie
P.'s book) and maybe a Zymurgy issue.  The 0.8 factor represents
an approximate average, and you'll find a variation probably
between 0.75 and 0.85 depending on the manufacturer of the LME.
The 0.7 factor is dependent on the grains, their crush, and your
sparging (straining) technique.
On the other hand, I've compared the above formula to measured
O.G. values for over a dozen extract batches and have had an
average error of about 1 point (0.1%), and a maximum of 4
points, on O.G.'s ranging from 1.026 to 1.057.


According to the formula above, you should have gotten


1.000 + (0.8*6.9 + 0.7*0.5)*0.042/5 = 1.049.


My conjecture is that the stuff that you didn't siphon (you 
mentioned you lost some stuff due to siphon problems) caused
the discrepancy.  For example if you left one quart of your
concentrated wort in the kettle your expected gravity after
topping off to 5 gallons would be only


1.000 + 2.0*.049/2.25 = 1.044


which is close to your measurement.
Here the 2.0 is the amount of concentrated wort that you siphoned
and the 2.25 is the assumed total amount of concentrated wort.

********************************************************************


    Rsponding to your query in the HBD, when you lost 0.5 gallons of liquid
you also lost one-fifth ( 0.5/2.5 ) of your fermentables.  If you were to 
figure on 55 points in five gallons, then (1/5)*55 or 11 points were left
in the boiling vessel.  That makes 55-11=44 or an OG of 1.044.  This points
up one of the rarly mentioned shortcomings of doing partial boils, if you
lose fluid there is a proporionatly greater fermentable loss.  On the other
hand you probably didn't have three pots boiling away on you stove Monday
afternoon either:-)

I have also used two burners on my electric stove.  However, I accomplish this
by a different means.  I use two smaller stainless kettles. One is 20
quarts and the
second is 15.5 quarts.


I arrived at this because I was using the 20 quart kettle for
partial boils (boil all the extract with part of the water) for partial
mashes.  Then I
was able to get the second kettle much cheaper than investing in a 40
quart stainless
kettle when I wanted to start all grain brewing.


I see my only disadvantage is I need to chill the two kettles
seperately.  I chill one,
then the other with a emersion chiller.


My other solution is an outdoor burner with a 15.5 gal keg as a kettle,
allowing 10 gal
batches.  The season will have a great deal to do with which approach I
decide to
use.

I don't claim to be an expert but this is my second harvest and
this method has worked well. I simply take a few window screens
and prop them up on boxes in the attic. I then spread the hops
1 (one) cone thick on the screens. My attic here in NJ is 
around 105F on a sunny day in Sept. I'm not very anal (my wife
thinks I am) so when the hops seem dry I pack them in freezer
bags and freeze them. Months later they are fresher than locally
purchased hops (my HB supply store doesn't store their hops well).

 >Several weeks ago I posted a query looking for information on an
 'automatic' sparge ring (described as a copper ring with holes drilled
 in the bottom and a float valve mounted in the middle, used for
 'automatically' controlling sparge water flow to a grain bed).
 
 >I had quite a few requests on forwarding any information I might obtain
 as a result of the post.  I am sorry to inform all that were interested,
 that I did not recieve any information... either on a design or where
 one might buy such a device. :-(  (Could be a market for such a
 device?.. how about it Jack? ... EasyAutomaticSpargeRing(tm)?)
 ...
 
 I didn't respond because of the necessarily obvious commercial nature of 
 whatever response I could make.
 
 The EASYSPARGER (tm) does exist but as usual, I have taken the shortest and 
 simplest route to effect the result.
 
 First of all, the ring with holes in it is totally unnecessary.  Well, let's 
 say it is about as unnecessary as whirly gig sparger made by that other 
 supplier.  As long as one maintains the liquid above the level of the grain, 
 it makes not the slightest difference how or where the water enters.  The end 
 of a hose, dribbling into the tun is more than adequate.
 
 Secondly, I have little inclination to heat up vast quantities of sparge 
 water only to use it at the rate of a controlled leak.  So my approach is to 
 continuously heat a small quantity of water only when and as needed.   This 
 being a stove top device, connected to the water tap, the flow rate is really 
 determined by the rate at which a kitchen stove can heat water.  The float 
 valve is really not required because all one needs to do is adjust the 
 out-flow from the mash tun to the inflow from the EASYSPARGER.
 
 To de-commercial this, you can make your own easy sparger by installing two 
 barb fittings on a 6 qt kettle.  One goes to a hose fitted with a fawcet 
 adapter and the other goes to  a short length of high temp hose to dribble 
 over the mash tun.   The input from the tap should be above the output level.

I use a float valve from Graingers, part number 2X524, $13.70. It doesn't
come with a float. I got a SS float surplus at a local junk store. The

right down about an inch above the mash bed. I consructed it all out of 1/2

[Also, Jeremy Bergsman astutely points out that the ring portion is
really unnecessary (no offense Uncle Bob!<g>) as water is usually an
inch above the grain bed and any flow of water that does not disturb the
grain bed will work just as well.]  Thanks again for responding!

Subject: Immersion Chiller; Spent Grains


Okay HBDers.  I have followed the threads about immersion wort chillers and
decided I had to have one.  Went to Home Depot and spent $28 on a 50' roll of
3/8" OD soft refrigeration copper tubing.  Bought 1' of 3/8" ID flexible
tubing, a female hose connector with a 3/8" OD nipple, and a couple of hose
clamps.


Now to coil it so it will fit my brew pot.  As I ambled about the house I
came upon a lone cornelius keg.  Hmmmm.  I Placed the C-keg in the brew pot .
 . .  plenty of room for tubing also.  :D  I simply unrolled the tubing (the
hallway was long enough) and, laying the C-keg on the floor, began rolling
the tubing onto it.  Worked great!
No kinks and an even coil to immerse in my wort.  Using the nifty spring type
bending tool I formed the ends and attached my other components.


Test Time!  Used water at boiling (212F) and had at it.  The temp dropped to
less than 110F in less than 5 minutes!!  I debated on which way to flow the
water through . . .  from top to bottom OR bottom to top.  I opted for top to
bottom.  (Any comments on which is more efficient?)

What do you do with your spent grains??  My friend and fellow brewer is a
frugal kind of guy - He used the grains to make some bread (his wife said he
looked like the Swedish Chef from the Muppets when he was doing this)!
 Really turned out great.  He will be writing up his recipe and it will be
available for publication later.  


Anybody else have any neat ideas to recycle the grains?


Happy Brewing!!

Seems I've worked my way into a maze and need help....


What is the difference between undercarbonation and poor head retention??  


My last 4-5 batchs of extract based ales have all suffered from what I am
guessing is poor head retention--pour out of bottle into clean glass, little
head formation, any that does form disappears almost immediately.  But the
beer does have a slight "bubbly" feel in my mouth.  First few batches I used
 a dish washer to sanitize bottle (WITH RINSE AGENT IN DISHWASHER), so last
batch I sanitized bottles w/1/2 hour soak 2 tlbspoon bleach to 5 gallon, hot
water rinse.  Caps sanitized same way.  Last batch suffered same fate.  My
questions are this:


What else might cause poor head retention??  I have heard of adding .5-1 lb
wheat malt to help.  Also the freshness of the hops ??


How does one judge carbonation and head retention??  I guess my beer is
properly carbonated--last batch used 1 cup corn sugar-- but it still doesn't
seem to be enough carbonation for me....


Thanks for responses--I'll post summary
PS-FWIW, although I thought the post from that gentleman in Maine about
newbie questions was pure trash, I can now see a glimmer of truth.  I would
be helped by having local, live,KNOWLEDGABLE resource to bring this problem

I was puzzled by the word as well. As far as I know, "haul" is not a real 
word but, from the description, it is obvious that it was "haulm", i.e. 
straw that was in that bag. Haulm is a collective word, like straw, so 
should not show up in the plural. Maybe it is a dialect word, or maybe 
someone at the printing company decided to change the "m" into an "s".


(For the linguistically inclined, "haulm" is the English cognate of the 
French "chaume", which means "thatch".)

Subject: Dealing with high ambient temperatures


I've been lurking for the past couple of months trying to learn as much 
as possible before trying my first homebrew.  I would not post this 
question if there were advice available from some other quarter, but I 
don't know of anyone else in Israel who does homebrew.  


The problem that I have is the high temperatures here.  My apartment is
usually in the the 25C-30C (77F-86F) range during the months
June-September.  Everything that I have read (Papazian, Reese, and the
stanford docs) indicates that temperature is very important and 65F-75F is
ideal.  Papazian does not deal with this at all.  Reese (Better Beer and
How to Brew It), claims that above 75F you just don't get good results. 
He suggests a method of cooling the fermentor using wet towels draped over
the sides which provide evaporative cooling.  I can live with this, but is
temperature of the fermentation after bottling also critical? 


I know that I am not the first to deal with this question.  I spent my
first 30 years in the states and remember lots of disgusting hot, humid
summers.  How do you all maintail appropriate fermentation temperatures? 
Or is it not all that important after all?  I'd hate to have to wait for
autumn to begin brewing. 


BTW, if anyone knows of a good homebrew supplier which will mail order to 
Israel, I'd appreciate an address and phone number.


Thanks,

Well, Bruce Stevens stirred up a hornets' nest alright.  At the risk 
of adding fuel to the fire, I have to come out and say that I 
basically agree with his sentiments, and suspect that many others 
might, had his message been worded a little less provocatively.  
All you Protectors of the People out there, please read on before 
you jump on my case.


I've subscribed to the HBD for about a month now, and it's 
main function, it seems to me, is to provide a forum for informed 
discussion about beer and brewing.  By "informed discussion" I don't 
mean that we should restrict ourselves to graduate-level 
biochemistry; only an insufferable prig would take that attitude and 
it's clear to me that Bruce did NOT say anything of that sort.


It's also clear to me that the HBD is not intended to provide 
absolute beginners (the wortless??) with the information they need to 
begin brewing. It's the nature of the beast.  The HBD consists of a 
random assortment of tiny bits of information about brewing.  Nobody 
could make any real sense of it without having some prior knowledge 
and/or experience.  What the beginning brewer needs is not the HBD 
but a book, in which the necessary information is laid out in a 
clear, logical fashion, that tells him/her how to produce a batch of 
beer.  If any beginners with problems are reading this, please go to 
the literature (i.e. any HB book) first before posting a question on 
the HBD.  Papazian's New Complete Joy of Home Brewing (pub. Acme, 
price $11) is probably the most accessible; I've seen it in 
regular bookstores.  Also, bear in mind that your question will be 
answered by people who have no knowledge of exactly what your set-up 
is, and  who are not themselves infallible.  I've read some 
statements made on the HBD that are just plain wrong, although these 
are usually caught by someone.  But how is the beginner to know?


OK, people, I'm ready for the righteous indignation.

ice in your drink in a third-world country is a great way to catch 
typhus.  Wee yeasties have their cell walls ripped by freezing (as I 
guess Kirk knows, from the title of his post), but this isn't true 
of many, many bacteria or other dreadful creatures.  Ever watched the 
mold grow inside a freezer that's been switched off and allowed to 
reach room temperature without even opening the door?


Frank (ding.dong`at`esbbs.com) asks "Why not freeze sterile wort"?  From 
the above, I reckon it's a bad idea because your fridge and freezer 
are about the most bacterially contaminated places in your house; the 
only reason this isn't apparent is that the low temperature really 
slows the buggers down.  You're simply increasing the chances of 
contaminating the outside of the jar, and hence of whatever 
temporarily open container you pour the starter into at the next 
stage.  I also use the canning method, and have never had a problem 
with storing the jars at room temperature; this was the whole reason 
the method was originally invented for foodstuffs (if one of your jars 
is internally contaminated, it's soon apparent, but wouldn't be were 
they frozen).  I boil up 3 gallons of ME-based lightly hopped wort at 
OG 1035 - 1040; this provides enough for 36 jars, half-filled, 12 each 
of half-pint, pint, and quart capacity, and then use the three sizes 
in sequence to get a good volume of starter from a WYeast pouch or 
bottle dregs.  For me, this is easily a year's supply (especially if 
the timing's right for carrying yeast from one brew to the next, 
obviating the need for a starter).  


Happy brewing

Usually when I want to loiter efficiently, I use cappuccino. For one
thing, it tastes better than rice hulls :-)

OK, I'm being really helpful tonight; must have something to do with 
the steady depletion of my stock that's accompanying this session.


Todd McGuiness writes "I know that the temperature of the 
water/liquor (??) in the lock must be close to the temp of the brew 
or we will get leakage from the lock into the primary".
Wrong.  You could have liquid nitrogen or boiling oil in the lock 
(although either would be difficult to arrange), and as long as the 
internal and external pressures are the same, there will be no 
movement of liquid in the lock.  3 things commonly influence the 
pressure balance:
1.  CO2 production in the fermenter
2.  Temperature variations.  Any T change inside the fermenter 
will cause a pressure differential.
3.  External pressure variations, such as when a front comes through.


Todd, if you pitched your wort at 80F (I assume ambient T was 
considerably less), then cooling during the lag probably was 
responsible for sucking air and lock liquid in (I assume this is what 
you mean when you say leaking).  Wondering how it'll turn out? Taste 
it and see.  Any damage has probably been done by now, although some 
types of bacteria also have a long lag time, i.e. the new beer is 
good, but it doesn't keep well.  ESB can be consumed pretty quickly 
if you barrel/keg it, trust me, I'm English.


Is pitching at 80F such a good idea? I used to do this, but got fed 
up with drinking phenol and esters that had a faint taste of hops.  
Since recently getting a temperature controller and second fridge, 
I've also realised just how exothermic primary fermentation is.  My 
last brew was 10F above the 68F ambient at high krausen (despite 
having been pitched at about 65F), not bad for a little 3 gallon 
bucket with a large surface area/volume ratio, but not good for 
flavour.  Admittedly this was a strong ale (OG 1085), but next time 
I'll crank the fridge down to about 55F during primary fermentation 
with an ale yeast (this one was the stuff labelled only "Nottingham 
Ale Yeast, made in Canada".  Anyone else tried monitoring ferment T 
while using this yeast?).
