Subject: HBD as a part of the Internet


Dear Friends, the brouhaha started by the "worthless post" post has taken
up a lot of space, so I'll be brief.  I think what Bruce is getting
hammered for is his choice of words, and I think he should--*for his
choice of words*.  Ulick and John ("Trust me, I'm English") Wolff have
both pointed out that it would not be bad for the HBD if new readers read
the thing for awhile, and became familiar in at least a cursory way with
some of the more common brew books, before posting something.  This is one
of the first tenets of basic Netiquette.  If one filters out the invective
from Bruce's post, I think this is the basic message, and one that I too
agree with.  BUT!  I was mightily pissed off after reading Bruce's post,
just like a lot of readers were.  The digest was almost completely
responsible for major improvements in *my* understanding of brewing, because
I did not have access to the basic info and brewed "in a vacuum" for my
first 18 months before finding the HBD.


I'm sure we have all noticed that, as the years have passed, the net has
become a weirder and more hostile place.  I submit that it is too much to
ask for the Digest to be immune to this, much as we would all prefer it to
be so.  So although I basically agree with the underlying sentiment of
Bruce's post, he has no business increasing the weirdness and hostility of
the net, and the Digest. 


Next time: beer...I promise.

Subject: Fresh Hops/Hop Drying


A couple of notes on drying hops etc:


Light damage:  incandescent light will definitely still make hops go skunky.
               source: a friend of mine whose beer is routinely skunky due
               to the fact that against my advice he persists in using a desk
               lamp to keep his fermenter warm.
O2 damage:  Probably will not be all that great but if you really wanted to
            avoid it you could buy a tank of nitrogen (N2), pass it through
            a heating coil to get it nice 'n' toasty warm and have it blow
            gently through a tube with the hops in it.  N2 is pretty cheap.


I agree with the Coyote though in that I'm not yet convinced that there's
any reason not to use fresh, turbid hop flowers.


Spent grains:  I just spread them outside for the birdies to munch.  Actually
               I spread them outside a friend of mine's window so the little
               darlings will come and chirp and wake him up in the morning.
               Ain't I a stinker :)

Hi Jack,
     your posting reminded me of the "discussion" that you and I (with one
or two others) had on r.c.b some time back about the "whirly gig" sparger.
The conclusion of the debate, on my part, was that I agreed that your
methods where quite adequate but that I would continue with my "whirly gig"
as it suited my purpose.
     As an update to that discussion, I now feel that my "whirly gig" is
pretty essential for the following reasons. Having found a supplier of
pre-crushed malt of a higher crush quality and having replaced my "twin-bin"
mash-tun with a single-bin/copper-manifold setup, I have found that my mash
process has changed drastically. I use, what seems to be, the British method
of completely draining the grain bed before sparging. I say this is a British
method as it would appear that this is frowned upon by many US brewers but I
know that many commercial British breweries do this unless there is liklihood
of a set mash. As the bed is completely drained, I must then apply the sparge
liquor in a gentle fashion, initially, in order to disturb the grain bed as
little as possible. Your argument would be that once the level of sparge liquor
had built up above the grain bed, I could then be less careful about the way
that further sparge liquor was applied due to the cushioning effect of the
covering layer of liquor. Also, the fact that the layer of liquor does cover
the whole of the bed, ensuring that the complete area of the bed is being
"rinsed", it doesn't matter where the liquor is being applied - a single point
of entry such as a tube is as good as an even spray from a "whirly gig".
     Slight problem! As a result of the better quality of crush and the
impossibility of blocking the slots in my copper manifold, the rate of
permeation of the sparge liquor through my grain bed is such that it is
virtually impossible to build up any covering layer of liquor above my grain
bed - as fast as I apply it, it soaks through. As a result, a gentle, even
application of the sparge liquor is absolutely essential - if I used a single
tube, I would need to wave it about over the grain in order to rinse the whole
area and to prevent it breaking up the grain bed. If I did not have a
"whirly gig", I would most likely make a stationary ring with holes or use what
many UK brewers use - a brass watering-can rose suspended in the centre of the
mash-tun. In saying that, however, it is likely that I would even try to make my
own design of "whirly gig" - I already knew that commercial breweries use giant
"whirly gigs" and was trying to work out how I could make a small version before
I found the one I currently own in my local HB shop. On a recent visit to a
small independent brewery, I found that their "whirly gig" was six foot long
and made out of standard 1 inch copper pipe with end-caps and compression
fittings. Unless I can find a better method of gently applying an even flow of
sparge liquor to my drained grain bed, I must adopt the opinion that my "whirly
gig" is a neccessity rather than a novelty.
     And just a point for those who may question my methods of draining the
mash completely and the obvious speed that my sparge liquor runs through it...
Using this method, I achieve a run-off/sparge time of 45-60 minutes and a mash
efficiency of between 88%-92% (31 - 33 pts).
 
>  Secondly, I have little inclination to heat up vast quantities of sparge 
> water only to use it at the rate of a controlled leak.
 
     Doesn't seem to be much of a problem to me - I use a 5.5 Imp. gallon
Electrim bin which has an electric element and a thermostat which keeps the
temp. within 1 deg. C either way of what I set it to.
 
Cheers,
     Brian

Subject: Alternatives to bottling


Greetings to you all!  Let me begin by saying what a valuable resource the
HBD has been to me over the past few years.  Despite the occasional
rantings by obnixious brewers, this forum has been a terrific asset to
me and my brewing from day 1, and has been with me all the way from
my first brew (dumping a can of malt extract into a bucket with three
pounds of domino sugar) up to my present level of skilled all-grain
brewing.  Thank you all.
        Okay, enough of the niceties.  I do not have the money or space for
a corny keg setup, and I have heard many problems from those who own
party pigs and the mini-keg system.  I recently saw what looked to be a
3 gallon plastic barrel from Edme at a nearby store...the store owner's
wife couldn't give me any further information about it.  Is this the
Edme pressure barrel?  Does anyone out there have one or know how it
works?  I am looking for a cheap, useful alternative to bottling all
of my beer.  I would be grateful for any advice.

Hello All,
        I've been monitoring the hop drying debate for around a month
and while most of the solutions posted were good ideas, none were 
practical for me. I went out & made a small investment ($25.00) by 
buying a food dehydrator figuring that if it didn't work for hops I'd
dry stuff from my garden. It works great! In about 3 hours I dried 2
quarts (2 quart sized baggies) of chinook hops. It doesn't get too hot,
there's no light involved & it's quick. For those of you who'd like a 
little more info, e mail me `at` DAY`at`a1.tch.harvard.edu & I'll be glad to
give you more details.

     I just finished my third try at the two-temperature mash that was 
     recommended for American 2-row (somewhere on HBD last winter), 
     holding mash at 55-60C for 20 minutes; then raising to 70-75C. 
     First two times, I noticed what I thought was a quick quick 
     conversion at the higher temperature, so this time I did the 
     iodine check as soon as my mash hit 70 and--lo--iodine says all 
     the conversion is over & done. So. Is this weird or what? Should 
     I hold the mash at 70-75 anyway or go straight for mashout? Is my 
     understanding of iodine tests stoopid? What's going on here? BTW, 
     I use a schmidling-esque kettle procedure, on a gas stove, and 
     get a fairly rapid (maybe 10 minutes) temperature increase from 
     60-70.
     
     On hop-drying, I'm definitely no pro, but the 140 degree drying 
     temperature sounds too high. In my handy dandy Harvest Maid 
     dryer, I tried one tray of fresh hops at a thermostat setting of 
     125 and toasted the hops overnight (I assumed they were ruined 
     and didn't try brewing with them). My second try was at a setting 
     of 90, and it seemed better. This dryer blows the hot air through 
     the hops in the trays. Of course, the thermostat in this dryer 
     may not exactly be perfectly calibrated--plus or minus 75%? I 
     have dried lots of herbs in this machine and generally believe 
     that lower temp and longer time is better and would think the 
     same true for hops. Isn't the 140 temp mostly for the commercial 
     boys who have to worry about efficiency in big volumes?
     
     To Darren, 
     For those of us who are FTP-impaired, could you give us the exact 
     name of the new grain-brewing document in the Sierra archives. 
     TIA.
     
     And while I'm occupying your cyberspace, I must have missed some 
     posts from George Fix on the geometry of fermenters. Could 
     someone direct me. My dear one is buying me an old small 
     two-burner gas stove to put in the basement and throwing me and 
     my mashing-mess out of the kitchen (and, no, I've got no way to 
     use a 10-zillion btu kajun kooker). I do have access to lots of 
     scrap stainless sheet and thought I just might weld up a couple 
     stainless boxes that would fit neatly over both burners and maybe 
     later double as fermenters (to hell with 5-gallon batches!!!). 
     Any ideas on perfect geometry for a stainless box?

Thanks to all the responses on inadvertently freezing yeast and purposely 
freezing fruit to sterilize.  The overwhelming response was to avoid both; 
the yeast may be OK, if not slower starting.  Make a starter and observe it 
before pitching.


I recently bought some Lavin KIV-1116 yeast for a future mead.  I since 
have read in a Zymurgy article that yeast names or numbers that are 
preceeded by a "K" are Killer yeasts, that in some way kill wild yeast.  Is 
this valid?  Does anyone have descriptions of Lavin and other mead/wine 
yeasts similar to the beer yeasts in the yeast faq?


I'm looking for a cheap source of Erlenmeyer flasks and glass airlocks, 
preferably in the Baltimore/Northern Maryland area, or mail order if 
necessary.  William's catalog lists 500 ML and 1000 ML flasks for $5.50 and

There are some fairly straightforward extract recipes in the Cats Meow
collection, which you can snag off anonymous FTP to sierra.stanford.edu


These include "Pumpkin Ale" by Kevin Dombroski, which was posted to
HBD on 10/7/92 and "Great Pumpkin Bitter" by Barry Cunningham which
was posted to HBD 299 on 11/9/89.


If anybody's interested, I've got an old issue of "American Brewer"
here in which Bill Owens lists his recipe for "Buffalo Bills Pumpkin
Ale". It does however, make 15 barrels, which could be a little
much for some of our home breweries ;-)  I'll post it if there's
enough interest, otherwise I'll save the bandwidth and the wear
and tear on my fingers. ;-)


There's also an all-grain pumpkin ale in Charlie Papazian's new

An acquaintance wanted to heat his fermenter because of the cold temps, and 
settled on using a lightbulb in a box.  He rigged up an aluminum foil cover 
for the lightbulb to prevent light from being a problem.  I believe it was 
just a box shape and didn't touch the lightbulb.  Could work for hop drying as
well.

Okay. This makes sense. But how do I, average Joe homebrewer, do that?
If I'm growing hops in my backyard, what I can do to keep them at their
freshest? 


I'm already drying them, putting them in zip-lock bags, and trying to
squeeze as much air out as possible (by setting an anvil on the filled
bag) before sealing, then dropping them in the freezer. Is there some
type of more effective packaging that I can do to create a better barrier??

In HBD 1524, John (the Coyote) Wyllie defended his previous comments
about light, heat and oxygen damaging hops.


Hmmm. Good points John. I think I also mis-understood your earlier
comments about light damage too. I was thinking merely of light
striking isomerized hops and forgot that any kind of plant is
going to start degrading once its picked, so your point about
light causing the hops to turn brown or excessive oxygen causing
discoloration and aroma changes is well taken. 


In any case, it seems pretty clear to me that in order to dry your
hops, you have to put up with SOME degradation in some aspect of
the hop quality. As Glenn Tinseth pointed out, some degree of
oxidation is expected in dried hops. However, you certainly want
to minimize the damage, and fortunately, it only takes a few
hours to dry hops.


I'm backing away from the idea of using the light bulb now
since I think you're right that what you really want is some
source of forced hot air. However, I'm not completely comfortable
with the idea of using a hair dryer, but it's probably a step
in the right direction.

1) someone was wondering about "cut-rate" malt extract and whether there
are cheaper alternatives to paying $7.50 for M&F. I attempted to answer
by private email and sent it to the wrong place, based on the reply I
received (the email equivalent of "sorry, wrong number") from another
hbd'er. I have since discarded that hbd. If you'd like me to resend the
note, let me know. The abbreviated version of the note, for anyone else
who might be interested, is that "Northwestern" (Briess) extracts are
commonly available for $50/ case of 10-3.3 pound bag-in-box. The
original note contains more information, but it's a little long to be of
general interest.


2) J.M. Michalski asked about cider. I would _not_ boil it unless you
are doing it for the purpose of reducing the volume to boost the
gravity. Campden tablets? I don't use them, and I've heard from at least
one other club member that he regretted doing it because it took forever
to take off. I make only a couple batches of cider per year, following
our club cider pressings. With that statement of limited experience as a
disclaimer, I will say that the ones I have enjoyed the most are the
ones that I allowed to begin fermenting "naturally" in the gallon jugs.
I let them start out on the wild yeasts and then put them in a fermenter
and pitch. I boost the gravity at that point by addinga few cans of
apple juice concentrate. Get the stuff without additives. Throw in a can
or two of the Granny Smith concetrate if you like it. I've even included
a can of grape juice concentrate (be sure it's 100%, and not "grape
juice drink"). Brown sugar is a good adjunct for ciders, but I prefer
using the juice. I like DRY ciders, and use a relatively attenuative ale
yeast. Dry yeast (Edme ale) works fine. I've had that bring a
1.050-1.060 OG down to the .990s! That may nor may not be to your taste.
I have used Champagne yeast and have not been as pleased, but others report
good results.  Good luck and enjoy.

Chris Evans asks about making hard cider.  In Zymurgy Summer 1992 Vol 15 No.2
p.25 there is an excellent article on hard cider.  I made one of the recipes
and it came out like a crystal clear dry white wine.


I will be going to Scotland soon and would like to meet any Scottish

Unfortunately, not all have had your good fortune by remaining bodily intact.
An email aquaintance recently needed 25 stitches when his glass carboy broke.
Fortunately, no major blood vessels, nerves, or tendons were affected.


It sure got me to thinking about replacing my glass carboys with Polycarbonate
or HDPE (High Density Poly Ethylene).  I know the difficulties of sanitizing
plastics but that much glass is too dangerous.  Does anyone have a good

Subject: Cranberry beers




In HBD 1524, Joseph Santos (jesantos`at`wpi.edu) asks about brewing a
cranberry stout for Thanksgiving.


Actually, cranberries might work better in a paler beer than in a
stout. Generally, when you're working with a dark beer as your
base, you need quite a bit more fruit than you'd need if you
used a light base because you're competing with the relatively
intense roasted flavors of the darker malts.
 
A pale base also has the advantage of showing off the color of
your fruit. With a light colored beer, a fair amount of redness
should be imparted from your cranberries.


A good example of what to do with cranberries can be found in the
recipe "Cranbeery Ale" which appears on page 198 of "Homebrew
Favorites" (Storey Publishing, 1994, ISBN 0-88266-613-4). The beer
was brewed by fellow net brewer Carlo Fusco, who might jump in
and provide more details of what he did with the beer. Here's his
recipe:


 Cranbeery Ale
 =============
 3.75 pounds Coopers light malt extract
 3.3 pounds Munton & Fison amber malt extract
 4 pounds split cranberries
 1-1/2 ounces Fuggles (4.2% alpha, in boil 60 minutes)
 1/2 ounce Fuggles in boil 10 minutes
 2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
 1 teaspoon pectin enzyme
 Munton & Fison dry yeast
 3/4 cup corn sugar for priming


Carlo says that he put the fruit in after the boil. He turned off
heat and then added fruit, letting it steep for 1 hour before
transferring to primary. He then fermented in primary with the
fruit for 4 days before racking off the fruit to secondary for
another 7 days, then racking again for yet another 7 days.


His tasting notes say describe the flavor as "mildly sour and
closer to a pseudo-lambic than a fruit beer". He suggests aging
the beer for 3 months and says "It was a big hit at Thanksgiving."


Cheers!

Unfortunately, Bruce (brews`at`delphi.com) chose a tone for his message which
was sure to elicit digest-clogging counter flames.  But I think he had some
good points, which I will try to restate in a manner intended more to
incite rational discussion than flames.  To wit:


The amount of bandwidth allotted to the HBD is precious indeed, and the
amount of traffic seen here often means posts (questions or replies) take
days to work their way through the backlog.  I think that the digest is an
excellent forum to discuss information that can't be found elsewhere.
However, I don't understand why so many beginners expect the more
experienced brewers to donate the time and bandwidth to answer basic
questions, just to save them the 10 bucks or so it would cost to buy a copy
of TNCJOHB or Miller.  Furthermore, their are so many questions that come
up every 3 months or so, that perhaps only 1 or 2 articles per digest
actually have any new material.  Would it be so hard for people to consult
the archives to see if their questions have already been answered?  That is
what the archives are for, after all.
In short, I feel that any question (whether it's a beginner type or an
advanced topic) is perfectly fine here, but do your own "legwork" first:
consult a basic brewing text, then the sierra archives, and then, if you
still don't find an answer, ask it here.  The result will be a much more
informative, much less backlogged, digest.

Hi All,


    After all the discussion on autosparging, I thought a post of my private
email might be of interest to others.  Also want to ask the HBD for some
sources of oxygen barrier bags.


AUTOSPARGERS
    I've only made one all grain, hope to do 2nd all grain this weekend.  I
sparge by removing the top of cooler add a quart of water at a time.  I've
thought about auto spargers also, but would require leaving top off of cooler,
or leaving it loosely on top of cooler.  I saw a Phils Sparger system (std
disclaimer) that had the the Phil's Sparger installed directly through the top
of the cooler (i.e. drill hole through cooler top and push tube out of cooler,
as ascii diagram below:
                     Hot sparge

    The Phil's Sparger is supposed to rotates as the water rains down on the
grains.  I would prefer to not permanently mutilate my gott cooler.  The only
thing I have thought of so far is to remove top and replace with a thick piece
of styrofoam and punch hole in it.  The styrofoam would then be used only
during the sparging.  I was told that the plastic bottling bucket with sparge
water and clamp on hose can be used to adjust flow so it is same rate as wort
coming out of cooler and into pot (also as seen in Charlie P.'s new book "The
Home Brewer's Companion").
    How much does an autosparger systems help?  Some of the documents in
the HBD archives talk about draining off the mash first liquids, then adding
all the sparge water, stirring, waiting, then draining 2nd runnings.  Do any
commercials breweries do this?  I understand that stuck sparges and filtering
are some of the reasons for not wanting to disturb the grainbed or letting the
liquid level get below the grainbed. Are there others?  Would there be any
reason why an infusion mash should _or_should_not_ essentially go through two
mashes, one at 150-158F for one hour, draining, add 170F sparge water, stir,
rest for 2nd hour, then 2nd draining?


OXYGEN BARRIER BAG SOURCES
     I would like to look into buying oxygen barrier bags for vacuum sealing
my home grown hops, but don't have a source for the bags.  Does anyone have a
source with phone number?  Is the material expensive?  I plan to use a vacuum
sealer machine that heat seals bags after sucking the air out.  Any experience
out there doing this with oxygen barrier bags?  Also if this works, could it
be safely used for separating and storing bulk quantity purchased hops? TIA

I've been e-mail impaired as of late and had wished to
get this message out a couple of weeks ago,
better late than never, I guess.


1994 Dixie Cup Homebrewing Competition Update


The world's first intergalactic hombrew competition is now 
planning to take on the mantle of "The King" of competitons.  
The big "E" himself, Elvis A Presley, is the mascot of this year's 
hub bub.  


The Dixie Cup will be held in Houston, TX 14-16 October.  
Entries are $6 and are due by 1 October.  
Telephone DeFalco's Home Wine and Beer stuff place at 
800-216-BREW to request an entry flier.


The Festivities Extolled:


Friday night's Fred Eckhardt Epicurean Extravagnaza will be 
"Beer and Ice Cream".  Got any fried bananas to go with that?


The line-up of speakers for the Saturday morining 
milli-conference has firmed up to be Mr. Brad Kraus, 
winner of a few GABF awards while brewer 
at Santa Fe Brewing Co., now of Rio Bravo brewpb in 
Albuquerque, and one-time Grand Wazoo of the Foam Rangers; 
Mr. Tim Herring, big man in brewing operations at the 
Anchor Brewery in San Francisco; 
and the Mr. Wizard of brewing, George Fix.


Darryl Richman, author of _Bock_, the latest tome in the Brewer's 
Publications' line of beer-style books is threatening to tag along 
with Dr. Fix, as is Martin Lodahl, one of those left coast 
pseudo-lambic and Belgian beer geeks.  
Other brewing luminaries are sure to attend.


The Saturday pub crawl will include all of the open brewpubs
 and micros in Houston (a minimum of 4 stops). 
 Afterwards, the New Orlean's Crescent City 
Homebrewers will provide their unsurpassed
 "hurt yo' sef" jambalaya.


The crowning moment of this "King" of competitions will be the 
presentation of the Best of Show award on during the 
Saturday night awards.  Along with 
allowing Tim Herring to visit our "Heartbreak Hotel", Anchor has 
graciously decided to have Tim present to the Best Of Show 
winner an award of a trip to their brewery.  
The trip includes round-trip airfare, one night's lodging, 
and a tour of the brewery.


Sunday at noon will bring the return of the "World's Fastest 
Homebrewer" 
competition at Malibu Grand Prix.


And of course, in amongst this folderol will be the judging of beers. 
 
The Dixie Cup is expected to attract over 800 entries this year, 
and all possible help will be appreciated.  
If you can come early (Thursday the 13th), call DeFlaco's and let us 
know.  We may have to crack a few beers early to get the
 thing under way.  Early judging the afternoon of Friday the 
14th is also anticipated.  
The planned 1st round will start at 6 PM on Friday.  
2nd round is noon on Saturday.


Any questions can be e-mailed to me or phoned to 
DeFalco's at the 800 no. above.

Subject: Re: Hop Utilization and Forced Ventilation


In HBD1517 Bob Jones mentioned about Micah Millspaw
increasing his hop utilization by using forced ventilation.
Since no one else posted a explanation yet, I thought I'd stick
out my neck and give it a try.


Since the slightly lower pressure induced by the fan's suction
will reduce the boiling temperature it seems as if higher temperatures
alone are not responsible for hop utilization (assuming his boil
times were not changed).  That is, the boiling temperature
dropped using forced ventilation and the hop utilization went
up.  I suppose it is possible that hop utilization 
increases with lower boiling temperatures but this seems
unlikely, unless brewers at high elevations get better
utilization than sea-level brewers.


Another possibility is the effect of the vapor bubble dynamics
in the boiling wort.  Typically, as the wort is vaporized at the
bottom of the kettle, the bubbles rise until they burst at the
surface, letting the steam escape into the air.  Perhaps, by
using forced ventilation, the wort near the surface is cooled
and as the bubbles rise into this cooler region they collapse
(since the saturation vapor pressure is lower in the cooler
region) before venting.  This may also explain why
boil-overs are prevented.  


As the bubbles collapse (most often asymmetrically with high-speed
liquid jets travelling through the bubbles and impacting their
opposite sides) the pressures and temperatures inside the bubble
can become very high.  If these bubbles are collapsing instead
of venting then the situation may be
analogous to the cavitation formed by using power ultrasound on
liquids, which been shown to greatly increase a wide variety
of chemical reactions.  I have even seen a reference to a paper
in which power ultrasound has been used as a new processing aid
in food technology, improving such areas as the extraction of
flavorings.  Perhaps the hop utilization is increased as a
result of this effect also.


Although I have been working in the field of bubble dynamics for
several years the above is only a conjecture on my part.  My
work has been primarily concerned with large scale explosion
bubbles in which chemistry reactions are ignored.  My degree
is in applied mathematics, not chemistry.  Hopefully,
other HBD'ers who know more about the chemistry, in
particular, the area of "sonochemistry" or
"sonoluminescence" (the collapsing
bubbles actually glow) may shed more light on the subject.
However, the phenomenon is not completely understood, at least
according to the talks I attended last year.   Maybe this
hop utilization application (the Millspaw effect) would make
for a good Ph.D thesis topic.


For those interested, here are two references:
Sonochemistry-a technology of the future, by T.J. Mason,
Chemistry and Industry (1993) 47-50.
Sonochemistry, by K.S. Suslick, Science (1990) Vol 247,

Yes, this is a newbie question, so Bruce feel free to ignore this....


I have been wondering what is the difference between light, amber, and dark
extracts.  Then I stumbled across the following in a thread on wortchillers
(go figure...)

Is this the only difference and are these values accurate?  Also, will adding
more of a malt make the beer darker, or just increase the amount of 
fermentables?  


The same article goes on to say:

What pale malt types could be substituted in this way, and is it safe to say
that 2 cans would be about 6lbs of extract?


E-mail is fine, I'll post the results.


Thanks for the help!

Subject: Cider Beer?


Yes, as others have mentioned, the apple season here in New England is
booming and my thoughts are turning toward that apple beer once again.


I was wondering if anyone out there has had any experience in using fresh
unpasturized, unfiltered, cider from an orchard in the boil rather than
actual fruit or an extract?  


I imagine this stuff would make an excellent hard cider. (maybe with a
dash of cinnamon :-)
