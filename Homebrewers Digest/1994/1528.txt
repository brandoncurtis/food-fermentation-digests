Subject: Cider recipe


cider


One of the great things about living in New England (VT) is the ample supply
of apple cider. I've made about 4 batches of cider now and they've all come 
out real well. Here are a few things to remember when making a cider:


 -Do not use cider that has been pastauerized or contains preservatives. You 
 can usually find the untouched cider in the grocery store when cider is in
 season. The best cider is obtained at the press. You can always go to the
 press and get your 6 gallon carboy filled up for less than $10.00


 -There is sugar in the cider itself. Usually it is between 1.035 and 1.040
 Cider must have a high alcoholic content if you intend to keep it for any 
 signifigant amount of time. Always ajust the SG  > 1.070 with honey, cane
 sugar, or maple syrup. 


 -Never boil cider. If you need to adjust its temperature you can do it when
 you add the sugar/water solution.


 -Cider blends vary by season and presses. The beginning of the season usually
 has higher acid/ low sugar content while the end of season pressings offer 
 more sugar/ less acidic juice. You can change the acidity and tartness by
 the additions of citric acid and tannin.


 -If you want dry cider use a wine or champagne yeast. Ale yeast will provide
 a higer EG and will make a sweeter end product.


 -Cider ferments like wine. Initial fermentation is about 2 weeks while 
 secondary fermentation usually is greater than 2.5 months.


 All that said, lets make cider!!


             CIDER 1                                 CIDER 2
   5gal fresh pressed cider                 5gal fresh pressed cider
   6lbs wildflower honey                    5lbs cane sugar
   1gal water (to boil honey)               1lb cane sugar
   1 tsp tannin                             1gal water (boil w/ sugars) 
   1 tsp acid blend                         Lalvin white wine yeast    
   Lalvin white wine yeast                  SG= 1.070 EG = 0.990   
   SG= 1.072  EG= .996                      Primary ferment = 2.5 weeks
   Primary ferment = 2 weeks                secondary ferment = 4.5 months
   secondary ferment = 2 months             bottle still or prime
   bottle still or prime


   Cider 1 was definatly the better of the two. I've used honey ever since.
   Cider 1 is now 1 year old and has a faint sparkle and carbonation to it.
   This happens to me whenever I use honey. If you live in New England you 
   should definatly find a local press and make a day out of watching them
   press the apples and then return home to make this wonderful beverage.

Subject: Re: Benefits of Blow off Hose


Terry asks about using a blow-off tube instead of a big carboy:


I have used blow-off hoses in the past and I currently use the 7.5 gal
glass carboy with an airlock.  Since the cold-break sits on the bottom,
none of it will go out the blow-off hose.  It will remove some of the
gunky, dark brown hop resins that come to the top but I find that they
tend to stick to the sides of the carboy anyhow.  In addition, according
to Mark Garetz' book on hops, these resins are insoluble anyhow so they
would not affect your beer if they fell back in.


My conclusion was that a blow-off tube primarily blew off about 2 qts of
what would have been good beer.  Furthermore, when brewing an ale, it
got rid of the nice, thick yeast head that forms on the top of the beer.


That's my $0.02 worth.

Subject: Drying Hops


There do seem to be problems attributable to light and air--ever see a cone 
left on the vine too long?  As soon as it starts to open/bloom, it turns brown
and is useless.


My take on this issue is that the cone shape tends to protect the lupulin 
powder--it is mostly closed to light and air, and it points down enough to 
keep sun out anyway.  This may or may not be true after picking the 
cones--handling may cause cones to open somewhat more, they may be in lots of 
different orientations, and are generally just more vulnerable.


With care, you could dry them in full sun with no problems.  But, as with so 
much brewing advice, the general advice should be to be careful--minimizing 
exposure to light and air will just help your hops stay in good shape for 
brewing.

Subject: Ofest style and G. Fix's book


 
Well,
   Seeing that Oktoberfest starts this Saturday in Meunchen and that the Ofest
beers are starting to turn up in stores near me, I have a few thoughts about
this style which I'd enjoy comment on. (I'll start to brew some once the weather
gets a little colder).
 
   In George Fix's book, all of the recipies are primarily a base 2 row malt
with small amounts of crystal.  However, in the book it briefly mentions that
Dreher mostlikely brewed entirely with Vienna malt. It also goes on to say
that current Vienna malts are made from poor quality (or some similar 
descriptor) base malts and are not appropriate for brewing this style.
 
   Does any one have any experience here brewing entirely with Vienna or
Munich malts?   If these malts will convert themselves why would they be
inappropriate for this style.... particularly when Dreher brewed this way.

Subject: Carboy breaks


        I am fortunate enough to have a 12 gallon carboy for my primary (no 
worry about blow-off!).  However, it weighs over 25 pounds empty, and I'd
hate to be near it if it broke, empty or full.
        I bought about 50 feet of clothesline rope and put a double loop
around the carboy about 1/4 of the way up, then wove a fishnet kind of
bottom attached to the double loop, and finally attached double-loop
handles. I lift the half-full carboy only once per batch, from the floor
(after being filled) to the fermenting table. Without the handles, lifting
the carboy safely would be impossible.
        This works quite well and would also be applicable to 5 or 6.5 gallon
carboys. (I instead use a milk crate for my 5-gallon carboys.)

I've used them, and my basic advice for other people that use them is:
Don't use them for holding up the full weight of the carboy.


I ended up with 5 gallons of good Cabernet Sauvignon on the floor of the
basement because the "non-slip" rubber did.  IMHO they're only good as
another method of holding on to the neck, the weight of the carboy should
be supported by a hand underneath.

Guy Mason asks about carboy carriers.


To Guy and anyone else interested:
I have one on each of my 7 gal. and 5 gal. carboys.  I have lifted,
transported, cleaned, and filled them with the carriers installed for 3 years. 
I have never (sound of knocking on wood) had an incident.  The carrier fits
better on the 7 gal than the 5, which leads me to believe that one wont fit on
a 3 gal I plan to purchase soon for mead and special batches.  I haven't tested
the 3gal. theory though so don't quote me.


Another -safer- option is to build a wheel-around wood frame carrier which
encompasses the entire carboy, as detailed in the Zymurgy Gadget issue.  These
are most convenient when there are no stairs to traverse in your procedure, 
albeit carrying the carboy in a frame (esp. if handles are installed) would
seem inherently safer than the ring.


I agree that the carboys do not look very strong in the neck region, but when I
carry them I always let them hang straight down, avoiding creating a lever arm
with the fulcrum at the carboy neck.  I lift from the bottom when tilting is
necessary.


Good luck,
jcd

I guess seeing your picture in Zymurgy bending over an open fermenter in
Belgium made me question your amature status.


Along the lines of having someone weld up a stainless box for an open
fermenter, has anyone had a SS box welded up for a boiler. I brew inside
on the stove (gas) and I like it that way. I currently use an 8 gallon
round ceramic on steel pot that covers 2 burners. It works pretty well
but I would like to jump up to 10 gallon batches. I would rather not
have to go to the garage with a rocket engine. Has anyone done this? I
have thought of drawing up some plans and going down to the local
machine shop, but if someone has already done this it might save me a
couple of design iterations. I want something that is as deep as the gas
cooktop and completely covers the two burners and it wide and tall
enough to hold at least 13 gallons perferably 15.

Hal Laurent <laurent`at`clark.net> notes :


"Even if light *is* bad when drying hops, that doesn't preclude using a 
 lightbulb as the heat source.  Just mount a sufficiently large tin can 
 over the light bulb to block the light."




Um, well, if you do this, you stand a good chance of collecting so much
heat that the solder holding the bulb to the base will probably melt.


At least, this is what I see happen in some metal desk lamps that are
left on for long periods of time ( like several days ).


Revisiting our proposed drying box - rails on each side, holding wooden
frames covered with light screen, a small incandescent bulb down in the
bottom and a few holes in the top and maybe a small computer fan either
blowing cool air over the bulb, or drawing warmed air out the top - we
can see, easily, with a little visualization, that no light will pene-
 -trate beyond the first frame or two of hops.


We could, perhaps, replace the first tray with a couple of cardboard
baffles which allowed air flow, but blocked direct light, with ease ...


It's not a big problem to overcome.

I have carboy handles on 11 of my 13 carboys (5- and 6- gallon) and plan
to get two more for my two 3-gallon carboys.  They work great and have I'm
sure they have saved many a batch of beer.  It certainly doesn't feel as
if the neck is at risk of a stress fracture even when carrying 5 gallons
of 1120 OG Imperial Stout.  I don't know about using them for 7-gallon
carboys -- I understand that the necks of these carboys are quite a bit
thinner glass.  I used to have one handle and changed it back and forth
between carboys, but I finally broke down and got the other 10.  No regrets.

Cautiously after the last flamewar, I'll still suggest that there's a
better way to start on this than a thread in HBD.  First, (a) the Mead-
Lover's Digest is probably a better place for mead discussions.  They
spill over into HBD now and then, no harm done, but if they get going much
they'll rob bandwidth from HBD beer discussions.  Then, (b), there's
already a lot of details written down about honey, yeast, techniques,
etc., in the sierra mead archives--there's a README (which should be
called a FAQ; sorry 'bout that) and a recipe collection, plus about 350
back issues of the digest.  At least give the README and the recipes a
look first.

Subject: question about pilsner enzyme


What is pilsner enzyme?  It is supposed to be added with yeast.
I was at a homebrew store the other day when someone called to ask about it.
The proprietor of the store didn't know what it was.  A quick look through
most of the books in the store lead me to believe it might be invertase
enzyme (mentioned in Randy Mosher's new book) because invertase helps yeast
out.


Does anybody know for sure what pilsner enzyme is?

Why is a whirlpool beyond your capabilities?  It's funny, I've heard
this several times, and even read it in Mark Garetz's book on hops, but
all you really need is a big spoon and some copper tubing and a very
small drill bit.  


I use a counter-flow chiller, so you may have to adapt something else to
make your system work, but it's simple: I wrapped soft copper tubing
around the kettle once, to shape it, then compressed it just a bit more
so that it would fit snugly around the *interior* perimeter of the
kettle.  There is enough left over to run straight up the kettle and
out, to be connected by tubing to my wort chiller.


The bottom of the loop has been drilled with very fine holes.  I
disremember the gauge, but I used a Moto-tool drill with a very fine
bit; I was *very* careful drilling and didn't break the bit, but spares
are a good idea.  The fine holes mean that only liquid passes through,
and only once or twice have enough of them clogged to slow the siphon.


When I reach the end of the boil, I put the loop into the kettle, and
then use a long, stainless steel spoon to start a whirlpool.  It's
possible to get a really good spin going without splashing the hot wort.
Then I put the lid back on the kettle and let it sit for about 20 min.
During this time the vortex spins all the trub into a green mountain at
the center of the kettle.  The copper loop runs *outside* the mountain,
and by gentle siphoning I can draw off virtually every drop of wort.  


This system works best with hop pellets, as there is no way of squeezing
wort out of a mound of soggy hops -- I still can use loose hops for
finishing, but tend to keep it to a minimum.


There is an article in the most recent Zymurgy that outlines a really
interesting-looking hopback, a closed unit that sounds as though it
would work very well for you also.  As I recall, it would work with an
immersion chiller.


Years ago, my brewing partner and I ran everything through an open
hopback -- the kettle had a tap in the bottom with a rough screen over
it and the hot wort ran down into the lauter tun (now doubling as
hopback) in which we threw fresh, loose hops.  These did a bang-up job
of screening out trub and obviously added lots of aroma.  Having read
George Fix on the subject of HSA in the meantime, I would generally shy
away from this.

Greetings HBD'ers,
I also do enjoy the brewing stories that are posted as well as the newbie 
questions.  This is a forum for our learninig and entertainment, 
live life a little, lighten up. Now a _quick_ brewing storie so I can
be flamed for wasting band width.   
I don't have serious storie where my carboy fall and cut me to shreds, 
but it was pretty funny when I was trying to force carbonate one of 
my kegs by shaking the hell out of it with the co2 pushing about 
30 lbs.  I made the mistake of leaving the 4 foot dispenser hose 
on the keg.  I use(d) these cheap plastic hose clamps to lock (NOT) 
the hoses and of course one let go.  And of course this was the 
one that was holding on the tap and it let go at the tap.  
Do any of you remember the "Water-Weanie"?  While beer was decorating 
the walls of my kitchen I of course was trying to grab the loose 
end of the hose.  For some reason in a panic situation your mind points
 you to the problem at hand as opposed to the source of the problem.  
After I was able to capture the beer sprinkler I realized that 
I still had to detatch it from the keg.  That was the easy part.  
Cleanup was hell, 
I still spot some beer stains on the ceiling every now and then.  
And wasn't there a beer shampoo on the market at some time ......?

Thanks to the homebrewers who sent suggestions regarding buying malt
extract in bulk.  I got eight replies in all, from John DeCarlo, Paul S.,
Larry Bristol, Sean MacLennan, Greg Heiler, "Bob" ?,  Norm npyle, and Bob
Paolino)  Basically, the key thread of most of the replies was to get a
good name brand extract such as Alexander's, Laaglander, or Northwestern
(Breiss) Malt Extract, and stick with that for awhile.  This should help
me keep at least one variable constant.  Also, the price is very good
for a case at around $50-60 for 10-12.  (This is for canned or boxed
syrups, I'm still looking for a good deal on DME.)


Everyone, of course, suggested crushing the crystal malt.  I should'a 
checked papazian or a faq.


I thought this was a  pretty good respose from the group, and I enjoyed
learning more than I asked about, and the followup "conversations."


The Wine Hobby extract turned out just fine BTW, a perfect case of support
for the RDWHAHB concept!  There were some definitely odd flavors at 18 days
that were mostly gone even at 21 days.  Now, at only about 4 weeks, the brew
is quite enjoyable, though just a tad flat.  (I've been using 2/3 cup of
corn sugar (bottling 5 gal) with good results, but will definitely go back
to using the full 3/4 cup after this.  Anyway, it's not bad enough to worry
about repriming it in any way.  I just serve it a little warm and that seems
to help.

     I use this method because it *IS* a "traditional" method as far as the
British brewing industry is concerned. Sparging was not introduced in Britain
until the mid-1800s - until then, the traditional approach had been to drain
the mash-tun completely at run-off and then to re-mash a second, and sometimes
a third, time. When sparging was introduced and sparge arms invented, I presume
that they found that it was not neccessary to change the practice of draining
the mash-tun completely, hence this method of sparging. Some British breweries
did, and still do, practice sparging during run-off in order to prevent the
grain bed from running dry - this is called "fly-mashing" in Britain. I have
tried both methods and I'm not sure that I can make a comparison as I haven't
done any fly-mashing since I upgraded various bits of equipment. I'm not sure
that I could improve much on my extraction rates but may try it again to see.
I find it unlikely as I know that a contributing factor to loss of possible
extraction is that I have to stop sparging before all of the sugars have been
rinsed out as I am unable to boil much above 20 Litres - if I increased my
boiler capacity, I am sure that my extraction rates would improve with my
method of draining the grain bed. One minor point about fly-mashing is the
need to control run-off rate and sparge liquor rate. With my system, I simply
run-off, unattended, until dry and then "drop" 15+ Litres of temperature
controlled sparge liquor, via my sparge arm, unattended, through the grain
bed.

     My reasons are mainly authenticity - I drink British Real Ale in my local
pub and I want to brew British Real Ale in my home. For this reason I like to
follow the traditional practices of commercial brewers as closely as possible.
I use an insulated mash-tun for mashing and sparging rather than mashing on a
stove and sparging in a seperate lauter-tun. Insulating the mash-tun with
blankets and things every brew day is more self-inflicted pain but its a
traditional British method that has its advantages.

     My batch sizes mean that I don't have the second problem. The first, I
don't find a problem - there are no children or animals in my house and my
SO steers well clear of the kitchen on brew days. The boiler is sited on a
secure worktop in a corner with the mash-tun in front - there is no way of
getting near to it or accidentally knocking it.
 
Cheers,
     Brian

Are you kidding?  If I had a nickel for every flask that I have broken.....
well.... maybe I could put a down-payment on another one.  These are 
expensive at any level of purchase.   Enough prattle.  


They ARE capable of being heated on a stove top but not on BLAST. 
If you are in a hurry you will over and unevenly heat. The result is a 
broken flask.  Heat slowly (on medium). Small scratches on the outside 
of the flask will exacerbate this tendancy.


Notice that they are shaped like a volcano-'nuff said.


I have found that Geordie DME has less tendancy to boil over than 
either Laaglander or M&F DME.  At least at the concentration that I use. 
The texture of the extract is different- more granular, due to a different
drying process. In any case it seems to come to a boil more smoothly,
with less foaming.  Why?  I don't know.  Perhaps the sugar or protein
composition is different.

The point, I believe, is not so much to reduce fluctuations in temperature 
(I don't think that external controllers will do that), but to be able to 
achieve the desired temperature.  For example, I generally ferment my ales 
at 60F, and my lagers at 50F.  Without my external controller, my frig

I used to without any trouble, other than physical space limitations.

I've recently come across several 100 liter HDPE (stamped HDPE 2 with the

to upgrade the home brewery to a 10 gallon/batch system using 3 of the 
barrels in a gravity feed/step sort of fashion.


I'd like to post a few questions re HDPE. First, can I boil in this stuff? 
What's the maximum temperature for HDPE? The plan is to mount a low density 
hot water heater element into one as a kettle. Second, are there any toxins 
that I can leach out by mashing or boiling in HDPE? The barrels are stamped 
with a warning "warranted for first time use only, do not reuse for food or 
drink". I'm assuming that this means the manufacturer doesn't want to accept 
the liability for subsequent use based on what was in the barrel originally, 
or is there more to this warning?  Third, what's the best way to get that 
nasty (old) malt extract smell out of the barrels.

Yep, happened to me once. I would bet your heating the flask on an electric
burner. You need a wire trivet. This little ring keeps the flask from coming
into direct contact with the electric burner. There is some sort of
molecular change that takes place in the glass when it sets on an electric
burner at high temps. I had a 1 liter flask bottom drop off, it looked like
a glass cutter had been use to remove the bottom. It was perfect. You could
buy a wire trivet or just make one out of a coat hanger. Personaly I have
went away from using the flask on a stove method of making starters, I have
moved on to pressure cooking several starters well in advance. That way they
are cool and insured to be sterile. Actually I think the flask geometry is
pretty poor for starters. The tappering neck is not what you want. You want
to maximize the surface area, to maximize the O2 exposure. After breaking a
couple of flasks I have went to a 200ml screw top flask for the first stage
(I only put 30ml in it) and a 1 gallon wine jug for the later stages of
growth. The glass wine jugs are cheap, straight sided and sanitize well.

I feel the important variables in extracting flavor from
specialty grains are the pH and temperature of this
grist/water combination.  I think you would be better off
heating your *treated* brewing water up to a temperature,
such that when your grains are added, the water/grain mixture
settles at 150-165F.


There are sources explaining why high temperature and high
pH can lead to excessive tannin extraction in normal mashes
and I feel they are applicable to your specialty grain
'mashes'.


I think your idea of steeping is a good one, but I'd do it
at a lower - 150F to 165F - temperature for 20-30 mins.


My experience with extract and specialty beers using a 155F
specialty grain steep have been positive.  I've never used
the Papazian method, but I've tasted astringent beers made 
with it.
