Subject: Whirlpool siphon, all vienna malt brews, underletting dilution


>From *Jeff* Renner


Jeff Frane's post on a copper siphon ring is perhaps the most useful thing
 (to me) I have read all year.  I am excited and am going
 to make one up this weekend.  Thanks, Jeff.  This is what makes the HBD 
great - brewers at all levels can pick up tips.


Someone (sorry, didn't note who) asked it it was possible to brew with 
all vienna or all munich, since these were evidently developed for brewing 
these styles (or actually, developed to brew with the water in those
cities, which lead to those styles).  This occured to me about two years 
ago, and I brewed up a relatively low gravity dunkels (1.042) for a 
party.  It turned out fine, if a bit low bodied.  I used Ireks munich 
malt.  Since then, I have made a vienna (using Durst vienna malt) adding 
only some 10^ crystal to help the body.  This too was relatively low 
gravity (1.044) that I brewed for drinking, not for competition.  In 
spite of that, it was well judged in the Michigan State Fair, where it 
placed.  Of course, it did need more malt to be strictly in style, but I 
like to bend my elbow more than that would allow.  I looked at the 
analysis numbers on both Durst and Ireks malts, and they looked to me to 
be of equal quality to pils malts.  I think they now use the same quality 
barley for all their malts, as do other European maltsters.


About underletting.  I have used an insulated, caulked Zapap (holey bottomed 
bucket in a bucket) lauter tub since the early 80's.  I think I will reduce 
the dead 
space under the false bottom next time I take it apart and recaulk it, by 
cutting off the lower ring(s) on the inner bucket, but I don't believe 
that the gallon or so of underlet water really dilutes the sparge.  Here's 
why:  I recycle 2 - 3 gallons anyway, so I think that that gallon is the 
equivalent to the first gallon of sparge water delivered to the top.  I 
think it is important that the whole column to the true bottom be filled 
with liquid to float the grains and to encourage a smooth flow.  
Sparging isn't straining, it's been described as "slipping the sweet wort 
out the bottom while slipping the sparge water onto the top." (Prof 
Lewis, I believe).  That dead space also allows solids to settle out.

 From *Jeff* Renner


Newbie kit brewers can take heart while graybeard all grainers liquid 
yeasters
can wonder.  At this fall's Michigan State Fair, Matt DePerno's *first ever*
brew took best of show, besting 102 other entries.  This was not a mediocre
entry in a lame competition either.  Experienced judges gave it high 
marks.  It
seems his dad gave him and his brother each a kit for Christmas.  His 
Brown Ale
recipe was  4 lb Ironmaster Imperial Pale syrup (sic), 4 lbM & F dark 
DME, 3.2
AAU Fuggles boiled 3 minutes, and the Ironmaster dry yeast that came with the
can.  He does seem to have gotten good advice on technique.  His entry for
indicated that he rehydrated his yeast in 100^F water before pitching, and
fermented in glass.  It shows good technique is perhaps the most important
ingredient.

Subject: RE: A real crack up


My guess is that you have an electric stove. Glass is not a
great conductor of heat, and an electric stove will attempt
to heat the glass at the point of contact with the burner. 
This can crack pyrex or apparently KIMAX. If you place one
of those heat spacers that you get with a glass coffee pot 
on the burner then it should work fine. You could also make 
one from a coat hanger.


I always heat my flask on the stove. But then I have a gas stove
and the heat is better distributed. When I use an electric stove
I use one of the heat spacers.


Not that I am sure about this, but I thought there were differences
between KIMAX and pyrex, with regards to the heat they could take.
But I could be wrong.

Subject:       Copper siphon loop/whirpooling


Jeff Frane described a copper loop to be used in conjunction with 
whirlpooling to remove wort from the kettle.  I'd say it's even 
easier to make than Jeff suggests; instead of drilling fine holes and 
risking bit breakage, I cut 8 crosswise slots in the underside of the 
loop with a small hacksaw.  By running water through the loop and 
looking at the spray, I then adjusted the slots (further cutting 
and/or judicious slight bending) to give a uniform flow rate at each. 
 This ensures that the cone of hops + trub from whirlpooling is not 
pulled out of shape.  Jeff notes that the whirlpool should be left to 
settle down completely before starting the siphon; this is VERY 
important.  My setup, in conjunction with a two-stage wort chiller 
(total length of 3/8" tubing about 55"; total siphon drop height 
about 4' decreasing to 2'), takes about 20-30 minutes to empty 5 - 6 
gallons from the kettle.  With the external chiller, I still get cold 
break in the fermenter, but this hasn't resulted in off flavours that 
I can detect (as far as I can tell; I've only made heavyish ales 
since building the system).


Happy brewing

Subject: Canning Starters




Fellow Brewers,


After reading several posts about earlenmeyer flasks
breaking, I thought I'd add my 2 cents worth.


I used to make starters in flasks, small pans, microwaves,
etc. until I settled on canning my starters (actually
sterile wort).  I know this is nothing new or original, but
it has saved me a lot of time and hassle.  I simply make a 5
to 6 gallon batch of extract based wort with an ounce of any
hops to act as a preservative.  I then rack the entire batch
into  12 test tubes, 12 half pints, 12 pints, and 12 quarts
(Mason canning jars).  I then process (can) according to the
instructions that came with my 8 gallon enamel on steel pot.


About 4 or 5 days before brew day, I lift a colony of yeast
off one of the petrie dishes I store my yeast on, and swish
it around in one of the test tubes, and cap lightly.  Twenty
four hours later I combine the contents of the test tube
with one of the half pints in a small earlenmeyer flask and
cap with aluminum foil.  Next day I combine this with a pint
of sterile wort in a larger flask.  Next day I do it again
with a quart in a gallon jug, fitted with an air stone.
Over the next 48 hours, I give the starter several blasts of
air from my aquarium pump through a filter and the air stone.
By this time I have nearly a half gallon of very active
starter, ready to pitch on brew day.


A couple of cautions: since I don't cool the wort before
canning, there is a fair amount of break material in the
bottom of each jar.  I avoid pouring this in as I scale up.
Make sure you aerate as much as possible at every stage.  I
have stored these "canned starters" for over a year,
unrefrigerated, on the shelf without any detectable
problems.


The result of this process has been a reduction of lag time
from 12-48 hours to 4-6 hours.  My finishing gravities have
also been reduced from 1.014-1.018 to 1.010-1.014.


Hope this is of some use.  Besides, it gives me something to
play with each night :-).


Brew on,

I have not experienced this.  Granted, I have about 10 Erlenmeyers, ranging
from 250ml to 2L and so I probably have not used any one of them more than
15 times.  Perhaps it takes more usage.


However, despite being made from Pyrex (Corning), I try to not stress them
any more than I have to.  Sure, I probably could plop a flask full of
boiling wort into an ice bath, but I don't.  I put it into a SS bowl full
of the hottest tapwater my waterheater can muster and then add ice slowly.
Perhaps this has aided the longevity of my glassware.


I second DanMcC's sentiments on Laaglander.  I think it is protein content.
My starters always used to boil over when I used Laaglander dry.  Now I've
switched to Munton & Fison for starters and that maintains a managable
amount of foam during the boil.

Excellent ideas!  I would surmise that if you cut larger holes, you 
could use this for a batch made with only whole hops too.

Well, you could easily arrange the hop back so that the wort does not
splash all over the place, increasing HSA.  Just using a cover to trap 
steam would keep the airspace full of water vapors, which may have less
tendancy to promote HSA.  I dont know, I am personnaly of the opinion
that HSA is a vastly overemphasized issue in homebrewing.  I can accept
its influence on longer term storage and shipping of packaged beers,
but I would suspect 90% plus of the homebrewers out there can improve
thier beer my looking elsewhere in the process.  That said, I see the
problem when brewing delicate lagers that may be abused in transit.


Good brewing,

   I plan to put 1/2 lb. of honey in the 5 gal. batch. I had planned on
putting 8 oz. of Dextrin Malt in as well, but after reading the description

rather than the dextose? Also, will it be overkill if I use both?

Hello,


I am fairly new to homebrewing and am having a problem with my most recent
batch.  On 9/11/94 I brewed a honey wheat beer from extract.  After 
a few days, I was getting no activity from my airlock.  A layer of 
foam a few inches thick covered the top of the beer.  I decided to
pitch a packet of dry yeast into it. (BTW, the first yeast was liquid --
Wyeast)  It is now 2 days later and still no activity, but the
foam is still there.  The beginning specific gravity was 1.059.  The 
specific gravity is now 1.020.  Is this a lost cause?  I would appreciate
any ideas you may have.


Thanks!

From: Jay Lonner <8635660`at`NESSIE.CC.WWU.EDU>
Subject: Trub removal -- summary


A few days ago I appealed to the HBD for help in keeping trub out of my
fermenter.  A lot of people suggested that I was actually seeing spent grains
as a result of poor mashing procedure -- one respondant even thought I was
referring to the grain left in the lauter tun...


But I've been doing this for a while, and I know trub from not-trub.  My recent
barleywine had a solid 8" of it, which is unprecedented in my mashing
experience, and the motivation behind my query.


Specific suggestions offered were:


- -- Don't boil the wort; just heat it and add a hop "tea" at the end.  A unique
   solution, but one that I will avoid; everything I have read convinces me
   that a rigorous boil is an essential part of any beer, especially an
   all-grain beer.
- -- Rack the wort off the settled trub the morning after brewing.  I've done
   this before with good results, but I want to find an answer that minimizes
   the amount of racking I have to do.
- -- Let the wort settle in the boiler for an hour prior to racking it to the
   fermenter.  Several respondents suggested I use aluminum foil to cover
   my lidless boiler during this period.  This a suggestion I'll follow,
   reluctantly; it adds another hour to an already-long day of brewing, but
   the payoff seems worth it.
- -- The most popular suggestion was the old faux whirpool trick, i.e. stirring
   the wort really fast and letting the spent hops and trub gather in the 
   middle. In the past this trick never worked for me, but the replies I 
   received have led me to believe that my whirlpool was not rigorous or long
   enough, so I'll try it again.  A high-tech brewer suggested coiling copper 
   tubing flush with the interior of the boiler, after having drilled lots of 
   small holes in the copper.  You then rack from this tube after stirring.  
   This is a good idea that I will not try out immediately since I'm lazy and 
   don't want to build it.
- -- Irish moss was also suggested several times.  I've used IM in the past,
   but didn't see the proteins coagulate until after the wort had been 
   transferred to the primary, resulting in clumpy trub.  But I'll start
   using it again, since it might be more effective when used in conjunction
   with the settling period and whirlpool technique.
- -- Some brewers also suggested using pellet hops for bittering, since they're
   easier to rack off of (an observation that I agree with).  But ever since
   I've been buying my hops from the The Hop Source (and no I don't own it)
   nothing less than fresh whole hops will do!  They have made a big difference
   in my beer.
- -- "Sparge the trub" by racking the wort from the boiler to the fermenter, and
   then adding water to the trub and letting it settle out even more.  I may
   try this, if the other ideas don't work out.
- -- Strain the through a grain bag while racking it to the fermenter.  This is
   another idea I was glad to receive, but will file away for use only if
   other techniques don't work.


I think that's it.  Nothing revolutionary, mostly just refinements and
clarifications of suggestions that appeared in Kinney Baughman's zymurgy
article a few issues back.  Thanks to those who wrote.

To: I1010141--IBMMAIL


From: Bob Paolino
      Research Analyst
Subject: still more on nw extracts


Joe Clayton (claytonj`at`cc.tacom.army.mil) reports having brewed thin
brews using the NW light ("gold"?) extract and wonders whether others
have had the same problem. Well, I haven't, and that's why I continue to
use it.


Post again and give us some specifics. How much do you use for your
usual pale ale or other styles where you've had the problems? What are
your original and terminal gravities? Other details? It's difficult to
speculate without knowing what and how you're brewing.


I know that you can use light extract for everything and rely entirely
on your specialty grains for the colour. It has the theoretical
advantage of giving you more control over the process than if you used
the darker extracts. You also end up using more grain than you would if
you used a darker extract. Sure, grain is cheap, but if I'm going to
brew a stout, at least one of the bags of extract will be a dark if I
have it on hand. The other might be another dark or an amber or a light,
and I will adjust my specialty grains appropriately. The DME I add will
almost certainly be light, because I don't typically keep darker ones on
hand--I just don't have that much use for them.


When I use the NW extracts, a "typical" 4.5-5 gallon batch will include
two 3.3 pound bags of the liquid extract, a pound or two of DME
depending on what I want to make, and the appropriate mix of specialty
grains totalling a pound or two, sometimes more, sometimes less. (For a
higher gravity style, I'll use three bags of liquid.) Obviously, this is
oversimplified, but it should give you an idea. If you're using less
malt, you might have a thinner beer. For what I brew, I don't often get
terminal gravities under 1.010. One suggestion that might help is to use
some carapils. I've had good results with the DeWolf Cosyns carapils,
which is described as being more of a very light crystal than a "true"
carapils. I brewed a low alcohol "swill" as an experiment (O.G. 1.024)
and got a refreshing summer brew that nonetheless had pretty decent
body, partly because I used a pound of the carapils in it. It's not the
type of beer the typical homebrewer wants to drink very often, but it
showed me that it can be done. A bag of extract, a pound of grain, a
total of an ounce of hops (Kent Goldings for bittering and Saaz at the
end of boil), and a pack of, yes, dry yeast. Two cases of beer for $8 in
ingredients. I entered it in the specialty category (anything that
didn't fit elsewhere) in the Wisconsin State Fair and took a third place
ribbon for it, to round out the first and second place ribbons I got for
other entries. Without the carapils, I'm sure I would have had a very
watery (and unbalanced, even with just an ounce of hops) brew.


I haven't done any controlled experiments to know whether the NW
extracts ferment lower than other extracts. It would be interesting to
know more about the composition of different brands of extracts to try
to answer Joe C.'s questions. I'm just adding my few data points to say
that I have had satisfying results with the stuff. Without more
information about your too thin brews, it's hard to say why, but try
some carapils and increase your other crystal malts as well.


Beer is good food,

Subject: Propane cookers and sanitation


I've been scanning digests from the archives for some time now and
I've seen lots of references about not using propane cookers inside
for safety reasons, but I haven't found a reference to sanitation
problems when you brew outside.


I've been thinking about getting a propane cooker for some time now
because I'm tired of waiting ages for my old electric stove to bring
5+ gallons to a boil.  However, I'm afraid that brewing outside would
expose my precious wort to a wide range of sanitation problems.  I'm
not worried about the time before the boil or while it's boiling, but
doesn't it get dangerous after the boil?  I use an immersion chiller,
and I have copper tubing running into and out from the kettle, so I
can't keep the lid closed.  So there's a significant period during
which the wort is below the boiling point but above pitching
temperature and the kettle is not closed.  I don't particularly want
to carry my enameled steel kettle inside when it's full of boiling
wort because I know that the handles aren't going to support all of
that weight.  How do you handle this, or is this just another "Relax,
yada yada" problem?


Thanks,

         I'm afraid that your friend has a tough row to hoe.  Duvel's wort
    is split unequally into two batches and fermented with two separate
    yeasts. One of these is removed before the two beers are blended.


         I can't help you much, but I read in the AHA convention

Subject:  long fermenting ale


salutations,


     For the malt PREZ I have referenced the several texts that reside on my 
brewing shelf and there is no club nor other fellow brewers about these parts 
to ask so:  2 weeks ago I brewed the holiday cheer recipe from TNCJOHB.  I have
recently adopted the wet towel method of cooling and this is the only new twist
to my extensive 8 batch brewing experience to date.  The problem is after 2 
fulll weeks it is still perking away at about 1 bubble every 4 seconds (in the 
air lock).  It rumbled like a volcano for 5 full days, spewing forth great 
quantities of foam from the blow off tube.  I have never had so vigorous a 
fermentation.  My last batch also had the wet towel treatment but it didn't 
last anything like this one.  Are the spices responsible or is this just a long
fermentator for some other reason.  Just wondering if it will be ready to 
bottle before christmas.
     Thanks to all the folks who have helped me  through my strugglin'
beginnings.  If someone has an idea of how someone like me, who has read quite 
a bit and is getting along rather could tackle the task of the answering the 
virgin/brewer-to-be questions.  Perhaps a group of us could share the task, 
leaving more time for the real heavy hitters to address teh bigger questions.  
I am more than willing to "pay" for the help I have received to date.  Any 
suggestions?

Subject: Full-boil extract questions...


Fellow Brewers,
 It has been a while since I have written to the HBD but I have a small
problem that I know I have read about before but I forget what the solution
was. I just completed my 3rd full boil extract brew utilizing a Sankey keg
that I purchased. I also use a King Cooker to boil the full wort. This time I
felt very relaxed doing the full boil extract. After having done 6 prior
batches doing a partial boil extract and adding cold water to get it up to 5-6
gallons I very definitely recommend that you go the full boil extract route if
you can. Granted you will have to purchase a wort chiller to get the temp down
quickly for pitching but after tasting the results there is a clear advantage
to brewing in this manner as opposed to the partial boil extract. Yes, I do
want to go to all-grain but haven't done so yet. I may make the stab at it
next Spring but am happy with my results thus far with the full boil extracts.
I am also one who likes to delve into ventures one step at a time so I think I
am going about this in the correct manner. At least now I am used to doing a
full boil and using a wort chiller. 
 This leads me to my problem. I have a dark spot at the bottom of my keg from
wort that has baked on the keg. I have tried using B-Brite to get it out but I
am having no luck. Any recommendations? Also when I do the full boil outside I
am always afraid of leaves, insect, etc falling into the wort especially
during chilling it. Is the solution to get some type of stainless steel screen
to put on top of the keg? Someone out there has had to solved this problem.
Also I would love to hear from anyone else who is doing full-boil extract
brewing to get any tips from them. Please email me directly with any
information you may have...

Subject: Questions about spicing brews with spice teas


Greetings!


Last year I requested information on methodology for determining
the correct amounts for adding various spices to brews.  The
method I settled on is to create a spice "tea" by steeping
spices in alcohol (I've been using vodka), straining the
tea, and then adding the tea at bottling to taste.


Now for some more background.  This method has worked great so far.
The beers I have spiced have been your basic Pale Ale made from
DME and usually some added crystal.  Hops have been Cascades.
Yeasts are usually farmed from Sierra Neveda PA, sometimes the
Wyeast 1968 ESB.  I use am immersion chiller.  That said, I have noticed 
a unique reaction on 2 occasions.  When I first started to make spices beers,
I experimented around with various individual spice teas of various
strengths.  I added these normally to make my beers.  Then I decided
I would start to get cute.  I was worried that I may be adding too much 
vodka to the beers, so when I went to make a spiced beer using multiple
spices, I created just 1 tea.  When this tea was added at bottling, I
created some sort of break in my bottling bucket.  Really bizarre
stuff.  Not knowing what happened, I went ahead and bottled.  The 
resulting beer was very clean and very clear.  It also had about 
1/2 inch of sediment at the bottom of the bottles!


I sort of forgot all about this until resently when I was experimenting
around with another combination for an upcoming holiday brew.  Sure
enough, the multiple, complex spice tea caused small amounts of "breaks"
to occur.  For my second batch, I went ahead with using this tea, but I 
added it to a secondary, before bottling.  Hopefully this will allow
me to bottle sans this break material.


Any ideas on what sort of reaction I am causing?  Why would this reaction
be different than adding the spices individually?


Thanks,


Kevin
