Subject: Demerara & turbinado...one last time




Spurred on by some e-mail suggesting that these two words really
mean the same thing, I did a *little* bit of research, and came 
up with the following:


'Demerara' is indeed a coarse, yellowish/golden cane sugar from
British Guiana.  AKA 'Demerara Crystals.'  Sources that go into
detail suggest that a particular process lends it distinctiveness.
(One mentions tretment with sulphuric acid.)


'Turbinado' comes up much less frequently in the sources, but
appears to be a generic term for a particular grade of refined
sugar.  It isn't raw sugar, but is considerably less refined
than the white stuff.  I would conclude that Demerara may be
a turbinado, but not all turbinados are Demerara. (I wonder if
the root of this word is the same as that of 'turbine', which
would suggest a reference to some aspect of the refining process?)


The bottom line (for me, anyway): if you don't mind using cane sugar 
in your beer, any 'true' brown sugar would be an improvement over
ultra-refined white sugar, and may even lend some character.

A few days ago I appealed to the HBD for help in keeping trub out of my


:?


(Whoops)  There was a brief discussion recently looking for ways to keep the
trub out of your fermenter . . . there was actually a fine method descibed
in a recent Zymurgy.  I don't recall the exact details, but as I remember
it involved building a very simple device for racking.  I think it called
for a copper scouring pad tied over the end of the racking cane, along with
a couple of other simple modifications.  Haven't tried it personally, but
look at back copies of Zymurgy and give it a shot!

Subject: Cold Break




Four batches ago I switched my mash temperature program from single-step
to two-step.  I start at 140F for 30 minutes and then attempt to get up
to 158F for another 60 minutes, but have only been able to get to 156F.
Anyway, in all of the last four batches I have not had any cold break
appearing in my fermenters.  I use a counterflow wort chiller.  Can
anyone suggest a reason for this and whether it is good or bad that I'm
not getting any cold break.


Thanks in advance.  Guy (Albuquerque, NM)

Subject: Force carbonation


abaucom`at`fester.swales.com was asking about kegging...


Here is my standard info on force carbonation.


Here is the sequence:


1.  Sanitize the keg, purge the air with CO2, and rack the green beer over to 
the keg.  The beer going into the keg should be CLEAR - use gelatin finings 
in a second carboy.


2.  Determine the correct pressure for the temperature and desired 
carbonation level ("volumes" of CO2) from the chart.  CO2 dissolves more 
readily at lower temps, so you might want to chill, but I carbonate at cellar 
temp, usually 64^ F., and that works fine.


3.  Pressurize the gas line before attaching to keg - THIS IS IMPORTANT!! It 
keeps the beer from flowing backwards into your gas line.


4.  Agitate the keg for 5 - 10 minutes.  A good way to do this is to sit in a 
chair, and put the keg across your lap with the gas side UP.  Alternately 
raise each knee while listening to the long version of _American_Pie_.


5.  Put the keg in the fridge to cool and settle to let the foam subside.


6.  If you have any patience, leave the beer in the fridge for a week before 
drinking - but you don't have to...


7.  A pressure gauge/bleeder valve, used in conjunction with the chart, is 
very handy to monitor and adjust keg pressure to maintain correct carbonation 
level...


(Chart from Anton Verhulst, I don't know who originated it, but thanks!)

Subject: Yeast questions


This has little to do with actual brewing so those who don't like worthless
posts can feel free to skip to the next one.


A question came up about yeasts in general.  What are the basic differences
between the different types of yeasts (baking, the stuff we use, and the
"brewers" yeast that many use as a dietary supplemen)?


Could you make bread with "brewing" yeast?  Do they all have the same the
same B vitamins as "brewers" yeast?  Inquring minds want to know.

Subject: Pumpkin Ale recipe


A couple of people have posted with questions about pumpkin ale.
Here is a basic how-to I posted to rec.crafts.brewing.--- RM --








Well, It took me alot of searching but I finally found a recipe for Pumpkin
Ale. I got it from the October '93 issue of Ale Street News. (Good thing I
save such things) Here is what the article had to say :
        10lbs 2-row malt
        1lb crystal malt
        20oz Pumpkin
        3.5 oz Herzbruker Hops
        water
        gypsum
        0.5oz cascade hops
        a healthy yeast starter solution (Wyeast 1056)


NOTE ** BE SURE THE PUMKIN YOU BUY IS PIE MAKING PUMPKIN AND
     ** NOT "COW or CARVING PUMPKIN!!! The jack-o-lantern and
     ** cow style are bitter and not that pleasent to eat.
METHOD:
 1. Peel the skin off and core 2lbs of pumpkin.
 2. Boil in 2 gallons water for 20 min. and save water for mashing.
 3. Take 20oz of pumpkin and  puree in a blender.
 4. Add the puree in alternating layers in your mash. 1 layer of grain -
    1 layer of puree then mash water (at 162). Adjust the mash temperature
    to 150 degrees and hold for 1hour or until starch is converted.
 5. sparge with enough water to collect your usual amount (5-6gal)
 6. Boil with 1 oz Hersbruker for 80min. Add 1.5oz for 30min. Add the Cascade
    for 10min. Add the remaining hops at the last minute.
 7. strain out hops and chill to 75degrees. 
 8. Pitch yeast and ferment for 3 days.
 9. Rack off to secondary for 3 weeks.
 10. Bottle anytime thereafter with 3/4 cup corn sugar.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Note: The above is not my recipe but when I brew this beer I will use Irish
       moss and my hop schedule will not have so much late addition hops. I
       don't want the hop flavor or aroma to overpower the pumpkin. Have fun!

Subject: Plastic fermentation bucket and heat


I am a novice brewer and would appreciate some wisdom from those of you who
know much more about brewing than I. So far every one of my first five brews
have tasted fantastic to my friends and me and I enjoy the process of
creating my own fine brews. 


I live in a rural setting and have my own well,the water from which is very
hard (calcium) and contains much iron. I filter the unsoftened water through
one large inline and one faucet mount carbon filters and it then tastes just
fine. I boil all the water I use for the brewing process to settle out what
remaining minerals I can. 


Recently, to speed the cooling of the wort, I have begun to boil three
gallons the day before I boil my wort so that it can cool overnight. I put
those three gallons into my sanitized (with Chempro SDP) 5 gallon plastic
fermentation bucket and put the airlock in place to prevent overnight
contamination. I worry that the boiling water temperatures could leach
harmful or bad tasting chemicals from the plastic into my water. 


Would I be better off letting the water cool in my stainless steel brew pot?
Or would that be inviting in foreign yeasts, etc? 


Should I use the water that goes through my water softener and is much
"softer" but worse tasting? 


Should I just "relax and have a homebrew?" Thanks in advance for any words of
wisdom. And thanks to whoever maintains this forum.

Subject: Lost Brewbud\Lactic Acid


I've lost track of an old brewing buddy of mine.  Name:  John Griffith.  Last
seen:  Portland, OR.  Activities:  Brewing & entering brewing competitions.
 If anyone knows the whereabouts of John, please email.


Lactic Acid:  In my attempt to brew an authentic Belgian White,  many sources
have suggested using small amounts of Lactic Acid.  Upon trying to obtain
some, I ran into a bit of trouble.  The local pharmacist can get it for me,
but at outrageous prices.  I called every pharmacy in my local calling area
and probably 5 long distance before I found one that had Lactic Acid in
stock.  Anyone know a good source for this stuff?  I can't be the only one
who has had this much trouble finding  it.  I guess the moral is: If you need
Lactic Acid for your beer, better expect to look long and hard.  (There was
suggestions to maybe try a chemical supply house for it; none available in my
area and mail order is VERY expensive for chemicals, at least in my neck of
the woods).  So, just wondering if anyone else has had this experience and if
so where they finally found it.


TIA,

Is Sam Adams outrageously expensive Triple Bock out yet?  Anyone tried it? 
Worth the money?  I know I'll buy at least one just to see, but I was
interested in any opinions anyone has.


Also, is there any consensus as to which is the best device for mashing?  A
large brewpot or modified cooler?  Are there any companies that produce a good
modified cooler type thing or a lautering tun?  My homebrew store does not.


Finally, is there any way to find out about local competitions?  I have not
been brewing long and am very impressed with my beer, but I am still curious as
to what aspects of brewing I should be working on.  Thanks for any info.

Same here! Very helpful, great catalog, and the prices are the best

I could not reach Bob either.  This is the exact type of question that should
be answered by the Yeast FAQ.  I've already sent Patrick some things on this
topic, so perhaps the next revision of the FAQ will answer this question better.


In the meantime, the bottom line is that while you can brew a good beer with
Wyeast without using a starter, you are asking for trouble.  Two things that
can happen when you underpitch are 1) infection and 2) high final gravities.


What I do is use a 1 liter starter (1.030, unhopped wort) for 5 gallon ale
batches and a 2 liter starter for 5 gallon lager or high-gravity batches.
Basically, you want to make a small batch of wort, cool it, aerate it and
then pitch your yeast into it.  The airlock on a starter is not going to be
as fast-moving as one on a 5gallon fermenter -- consider the difference in
size!  Also, with a 1.030 wort, you won't get the kind of kraeusen you would
expect with 5gallons of 1.050 wort.  Keep this starter at 70F or so till
it ferments out.  Yes, that's right, ferments out.  Pitching at high-kraeusen
as is written in many books is NOT the best time to pitch.  You can then
pour off the spent wort if you wish and pitch the yeast.  Don't wait too many
days after the yeast has fallen out of solution in the starter or they will
begin to autolyse.  I try to use the yeast within 3 or 4 days of the yeast
falling out of solution.

There have been some that suggest that it's best to start the yeast in a
media that is similar to the wort that they will be fermenting.  Personally,
I don't hop my starters.


>Also, does it matter what kind of malt extract I use:  light, medium, or

I use M&F light.  I think that it probably doesn't make much difference, but
perhaps the acidity of the starter may go up as the extract gets darker.  Still,
I don't know if this matters at all.

Not necessarily.  If the wort was high in gravity, the alcohol can cause
the yeast to mutate.  This is the exact reason that Sierra Nevada doesn't
harvest yeast from their Celebration Ale or Bigfoot Barleywine.  I seem to
recall that one of the problems they encountered was flocculation problems.
There is some stuff on this in back issues of HBD.

PVP (aka Polyclar) removes tannins, not proteins, and will help yeast
settle, but it's correct that gelatin or isinglass (watch spelling) are
better suited for fining yeast out.

I believe that Ragers formulas were based upon pellets.  I've tested beers
at Siebel that were made based upon Rager's formulas and this is what I
can say for MY setup:


pellets, 5-gallon, high-gravity boil, hop bag, a 40IBU target, using Rager's
formulas PLUS 10% (for the grain bag), non-blowoff, resulted in a beer
measured at 41.5 IBUs.


>Whatcha think?


I think I would add 10% if I were using whole hops in place of pellets, but
this is just an estimation -- I would do taste-tests to determine the right %.
Note, that although more optimistic than Rager's formulas, Randy Mosher's
formulas (specifically his Hop-Go-Round) *DO* have separate scales for pellets
and whole hops.

Howdy HBD dudes...


I have been brewing out of control for most of the year (352 L since April)
and am starting to run out of storage space for beer, even considering my
consumption rate.  So I was thinking of maybe brewing up some spiced or
fruit vinegar, to consume & give to gourmet friends etc.  So does anyone
know how vinegars (e.g. malt vinegar, balsamic vinegar) are produced?  I
assume, since wine and cider vinegars are made from grape juice and cider,
that malt vinegar is made from some beer-wort-like starting point.
Any ideas, collective wisdom?  Beerserk,

Subject: Mega blowoff!


Hi again HBDudes -


Today I experienced my first blowoff (phwoar! eh readers?!)  Both my 20L
extract-based cream stout and my 44L extract-based pale ale went absolutely
ballistic, shooting foam through my airlocks, out from under the lids and
generally all over the place.  It is my first blowoff of any sort in 14
batches.  The 44L batch is in a 60L keg, so that's a fair bit of foam!
The 20L fermenter was bulging like it was about to explode! (blocked airlock).
So I was wondering, if I give you a bit of background, if anyone can tell
me what, if anything, I have done wrong!


OK, I'm gonna let you into my deep dark spine-chilling secret.  I am a very
naughty boy.  That's right, I never boil my wort, and in fact have never done
so, even for partial mashes, extra hops, whatever.  I never felt the need
to do so, 'cause I made beer that I liked to drink without doing so.  But
when I brewed last night, I was brewing such a pair of simple kit recipes
that I decided I wasn't wasting enough time on my brewing without doing
partial mashes etc., so I thought I'd give boiling a try to see if it made
my beer appreciably better.  Well, I don't have the equipment to do a full
boil (much less chill it afterwards), so I dissolved the extracts etc. in
8L of water (my biggest pot) and started heating it up.  I added marbles
to act as boiling chips and kept stirring it as I heated it, but as I was
doing so I started to think about the friend of mine who boiled his wort
for the first time and ended up with toffee-flavoured beer, and then I
started to get real paranoid and began smelling toffee every 5 seconds, so
I lost my nerve and dumped everything into the fermenter.  Some hot break
had definitely formed, though.  And of course it ended up in the fermenter
along with everything else... (including marbles, but I fished them out with
my stirrer).  So, dudes, the questions:


1) Is getting the wort real hot but not boiling it a bad thing?  Did it
   cause the massive blowoff? (must have, 2 unbelievably huge blowoffs
   at the same time, for the first time, is too much of a coincidence).
2) What nasty effects can I expect from dumping hot break in the fermenter?
3) What's the best way to avoid wort caramelisation?  Slow heat to boil/
   fast heat to boil?  (For the record, I had the gas burner on full until
   I got the jitters).


Sorry for the all-question post [again], but I've posted a couple of answers
in the past so I hope my average isn't too bad ;)  Beerserk [blowoff],

Tom Pratt asks about adding pumpkin to secondary for a "seasonal twist":


- ---You'll probably get all kinds of different advice about pumpkin
beers, or at least I did when I thought about making one last year. Use
less hops, use more hops; use fresh, use canned; have to mash, don't
have to mash; et cetera... One thing that was never suggested to me was
the idea of adding it to secondary, and I'm not sure why you would want
to. If you're thinking of the pumpkin as a "fruit," and are thinking of
adding it to secondary because that's the way some people do fruit beers
(I don't, I steep at the end of the boil), I'd advise not to. Pumpkin
itself has rather little flavour. Pumpkin beers will have that "pumpkin
pie" taste from the spices, not really from the pumpkin. If you want to
add something to secondary, add the spices (sparingly!) and save
yourself the hassle of dealing with the pumpkin. (It can be messy and
you also lose a lot of volume, so brew more in anticipation of that.)
The pumpkin itself will add c olour and affect the mouthfeel.

A hops Question - 


Is there an easy "at home" way to determine the AA percentage of hops?


On our last morning in Yosemite (Wowona Lodge to be specific, in case anyone
should be familar with it), my wife and I aquired several ounces of fresh,
"ripe" hops from the vines growing up the porches of the lodge. We had seen
them earlier but decided not to "steal" any, thinking the owners may be
homebrewers and get upset if we took some of their hops. There were at least
fifty vines.


However, as we were packing the car to leave, the gardner was tearing them
down and cutting them off at the roots! He said they would start turning
brown soon and he just needed to get them out of the way. He told us to help
ourselves, which we did. He didn't know what kind they were.


My problem now is how to use them. If I knew what kind they were, it would
help, but I don't. To use them for bittering would be tricky unless I have
some idea of the AA. They have a great smell and they taste like they might
be relatively high in AA but I really don't know, not having eaten many hops
off the vine.


Any suggestions would be appreciated. Email is fine if you feel the info is
not of interest to the multitudes. I will, of course, name the brew after
Yosemite or Wawona or both.

The pumpkin will provide colour and a fuller mouthfeel. I've added the
pumpkin in mid-boil (finally got around to addressing the "when"
question) As for hopping, I was convinced to go with _more_ hops than
for a standard pale ale (not more than for an IPA, of course :-) )
because I felt the argument that you need the hops to balance the extra
sweetness more compelling than the argument that you should hop lightly
to let the pumpkin come through. Besides, I like hops!BTW, that pumpkin
brew took a BOS even though it was young, and the spices have rounded
out nicely for an even better brew since then. I wish I had more of it
(the volume of my 5-gallon batch went to about 3-3.5 after racking and
bottling) I don't claim expert status, this is just what worked for me,
and I'd be interested in hearing more as I prepare to brew this year's
pumpkin ale.


"Dave in Sydney" speaks out for plastic!


- --I now confess to the hbd, as I have to others face-to-face, I use
plastic and make no apology. Dave stated all the advantages and refuted
the criticisms quite well! The key is being careful about cleaning and
storing your plastic equipment. I live in an apartment, and my water
sources are the bathtub and sinks. I don't have a big basement work tub
(or a basement) to fill carboys for sanitising, and I don't feel like
redoing and undoing the hardware to be able to put a hose on the kitchen
sink. I thought about a carboy for secondary, and even bought one,
thinking that a 5 gallon one (too small for primary, but would be okay
for secondary) might fit under the bathtub faucet--no, it didn't quite
make it. (BTW, for the person who suggested taking a drinking water one
for the $6 deposit, I wonder how those who have raised the question of
keg theft-for-deposit would respond. Spare yourself the ethical dilemma
and seek out a Corning outlet store, where the 5 gallon carboys are
$9-10.) Sanitation and rinsing is easy, ( and if it's easy, it's more
likely that you'll do it thoroughly), they're easier to handle, they're
less risky, et cetera. Here's something that Dave didn't mention. It's
easier to aerate your wort simply and cheaply. You don't have to try to
shake a heavy carboy around and you don't have to come up with
elabourate gadgetry. I boil my egg whisk (the kind of hand egg beater
without the crank) to sanitise it and use it to aerate. You can't fit
one of those through the neck of a carboy. I know that "serious" brewers
turn up their noses at plastic, but I like the convenience (and safety),
and brew only ales, so the question of extended storage isn't an issue
for me.


- --On a lighter note. The reference to mead (or meade?) reminds me of
something I saw the other evening. I'm a member of the municipal band
here in Madison, and we were reading a piece that stated it was
commissioned by the Kansas Music Education Association (or was it
administrators?) District I. K-MEAD must be a honey of an organisation
:-).


Aaron Banerjee asks if there are any brewers in the DC area:


- --Before he gets flamed for making what on the surface appears to be an
obvious question of fact, let me mention my experience. When I was new












at all this and preparing to move from grad school in Minnesota to
Madison for my new job, I posted an inquiry on rec.crafts.brewing about
whether there were any homebrew clubs in Madison. I knew my phone
number-to-be and included it in the post. The first week in Madison, I
received a call from someone in the MHTG and was invited to attend their
weekly meetings. I got involved right away with our annual microbrewery
festival, and have since worked on competitions, trips, other events,
and just plain enjoying beer and sharing advice on brewing. I've
certainly learned a lot since asking my silly net question. And to
answer the literal question, yes, there are. One is my brother, and a
couple others are members of our club who have moved from Madison to
DC/NoVa. If the brewers in DC are anywhere near as friendly as they are
here, you'll hear from them soon!


Finally, Michael Teed asks about his problems with excess phenolics in
his wheat beer:


- --I don't know that I have any answers, but I do have a couple
questions. I've never tried diluting at bottling time, so I can't
respond to that. I don't have the numbers at hand and haven't used it
often enough to have it committed to memory, but is the 3068 you mention
the Wyeast Bavarian Weizen culture, or one of the other ones? After
having used it (of course), I've been told that the Bavarian Weizen can
be rather inconsistent, and the Yeast Lab culture was recommended
instead. The weizenbock I made with it (far more malt, of course, than
the weizen recipe you reported--even without the dilution) was in many
respects an excellent brew, but it did not have the intense phenolic
character expected of the style--quite the opposite "problem" from what
you report. I, too, had a room temperature fermentation, but the banana
and clove character was mostly gone by the middle of secondary
fermentation. I entered it in a couple competitions, and got a ribbon in
one, and a fairly decent score but no award in the other. (The rest, of
course, was consumed and enjoyed at club meetings and at home :-), but
five bottles and a couple of entry fees is a fairly small price to pay
to get some blind evaluation . ) In the latter competition, one judge
commented, correctly, about the low level of phenolic character (and
appropriately scored it down), yet suggested in another comment that I
should get the fermentation temperature down to the 50'sF. I made it at
the upper end of the temperature range, and he suggested the lower end.
Am I wrong, or shouldn't I expect more of the weizen(bock) character at
warmer fermentations than cooler?? What experiences have others had with
weizen cultures?? Is the Wyeast (still) as inconsistent as once
reported?? Also, is diluting at bottling time recommended, or should you
really just brew more if you want more (equipment capacity permitting)??

I'm new to kegging (using Corny kegs) and my 5lb CO2 tank is reading
empty already. (at room temp too!)  The guage started out reading about
800lbs.  When I placed the cylinder into the fridge the reading
immediately went to about 500lbs.  I assumed this was normal.


I've only dispensed one keg of beer, and used CO2 for various brewery
tasks such as flooding carboys and testing used kegs for pressure
holding ability.  I understood that a 5lb cylinder of CO2 would last
long enough to dispense *8* kegs of beer!  Is this accurate?


I noticed a couple leaks over the past few weeks, but they were very
small/slow ones and have all been fixed by tightening connections.


How long should I expect a 5lb cylinder of CO2 to last?


Now that the guage reads zero, how long will the CO2 last?  It's not
actually empty yet.  Thanks!

THERMOMETER ALERT!
Recently, at Sams's Wholesale Club (here in Kansas City), I bought
3 dial thermometers for about $11.  Seemed like a real good deal.
Each has a 1" diameter dial, and a 5" long shaft perpendicular to it.
The scale goes from 0 to 220 deg. F.  They say "Cooper" and "NSF"
on the dials and come with a red plastic holder.  The shafts are about
1/8" in diameter, making them easy to install into a mash tun or
a boiling pot wall, using a 1/8" hose barb.


BUT THERE'S A CATCH!
After checking all three against a few other thermometers at 72 deg. F,
I proceeded to infusion mash 5 lbs of grain in my 6 gal insulated
bucket.  My temperatures all were too low.  (hmmmm... suspicion mode
activated...)  I brought one to work, along with another very similar
thermometer ("Igloo" brand, blue holder).  What I found was that
in a real 150 deg. F. heat chamber, the "Cooper" read 142 deg. and
the "Igloo" read 140 deg. F.


I next tested them with boiling water and the "Cooper" was 3 deg. low,
and the "Igloo" was 5 deg. low.


WHAT TO DO?
Maybe just adjust them to be correct at 150 deg.,
It's pretty easy to twist the scale to change the calibration.
Maybe I'll find a better thermometer....
But my Belgian ale came out delicious! lots of dextrins and body,
helped no doubt by the really high conversion temperature...


Caveat emptor, cherchez la fahrenheit, your mileage may vary...

I recently harvested half a grocery bag of home grown hops. They weighed 
20 oz. fresh. After drying on a screen in my attic for two days they weighed 
4 oz. So in my case, they really were 80% water! 


Just one data point, YMMV.

Subject: Beer Chiller ?




  Is there any type of device on the market to chill beer
while it is being dispensed ? I've seen people rent kegs
for a keg party and receive a cooler with a cooling unit in
it surrounded by ice. I guess the keg comes warm. Is there
anything like this available to homebrewers who do not have
the luxury of a spare fridge ? I'm sure I could make one by
bending some copper tubing into a small wort chiller and
submerse this in a cooler of ice between the keg and the tap
but I would like to know if there's anything sold for this
purpose ?
