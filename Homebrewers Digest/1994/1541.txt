Subject: Celis Tour Recap


Last weekend I took a tour of Celis Brewery in Austin, Texas. Hanging in
the entrance to the brewery is an Official Proclamation stamped with the
seal of Hoegaarde, Belgium.  It reads: "500 years after Europeans
discovered the New World, the people of America have finally discovered the
most important germano-celtic contribution--sorry for the delay!"


According to the Institute of Brewing Studies (?--I didn't take notes)
Celis is the fastest growing craft brewery in the country.  They brew about
four times a week, but are brewing well below capacity, due to a lack of
storage tanks.


The head brewer is an American woman who studied brewing in Belgium.  She
took over about a year ago when the first brewer left amid controversy.


I tried to read the mash schedule temperature readout--and was quickly told
by the assistant brewer that the schedule was a dummy readout.  Foiled.  He
did say that the mash schedule for the White (i think?) was 114-150-170 deg
F, with a very long protein rest.  I think a more accurate mash schedule
was posted in the HBD about a year ago.


Pierre Celis oversees the brewing in Austin, TX, but is not around much.
His daughter and son-in-law pretty much run the show here in Austin.  When
he's not doing beer festival promotions (did anyone see him at the Beer
Fest in Brooklyn this year?) Pierre is busy with a new brewery in Belgium
where he is brewing more White--and it seems they really like it--because
according to the tour guide they have already sold more beer in Belgium
than they have in America.


Celis is coming out with a new beer: a raspberry/wheat ale.  They have a
little contest to name the beer.  I don't know what the winner gets.


As far as the rumored acquisition of Celis by Miller, I did not hear one
hint of that during the tour, and knowing the Legend Of Celis (he left
Belgium to get away from InterBrew (tm)--the European equivalent of
Miller), I kind of doubt it.

Subject: Carbonation Problem


I have been brewing for five years now (all-grain for the last two) and have
never had any problem with carbonation but recently I've been plagued with
the following situation:


My last four or five batches have resulted in little or no carbonation in any
of the bottles.  I am very consistant with my procedures and do not change
anything drastically from batch to batch.  The problem has occured with
different recipes using different strains of yeast.  All fermented fine in
primary and secondary (none sat more than 2-3 weeks in secondary).  I use 3/4
c. corn sugar per five gallon batch boiled and well mixed into the beer at
bottling.  All sugar was from the same bag that worked successfully in past
brews.  My last batch had the same problem.  I did shake the bottles a little
to rouse the yeast and this helped a little but it was still not carbonated
like I expect.  


Short of kegging my next attempt to fix this will be to switch from bleach to
an iodophor.  I am wondering if traces of bleach (despite thorough rinsing)
are stunning my yeast.  I typically have a hard time rinsing soap with my
hard water though after rinsing bleach sanitizing solution there is no odor.
 I am hoping the iodophor may rinse better but I'll say again I haven't had
this carbonation problem in the past.  I will also be trying a new lot of
sugar.


Has anyone had this problem or do you have any theories on the problem?

geiser`at`rb.unisys.com asked about removing labels.  The best way I have
found is to let them set in a bucket of water with a cup of laundry
detergent in it.  (some/most) of the labels will float off the bottles. 
The others will pull off very easily.  If you want to save one, just let
it dry out.  Labels and bottling.... Thats why I started kegging!

Can I use standard welding oxygen or do I need to have medical grade O2? 
If welding oxygen, do I need to put an in-line filter in?


Bob Jones showed pictures (at the AHA Nationals) of his yeast culturing

Many thanks to those who responded to my query regarding 
the top ten beer brands in the world (based on production 
volume).  In sumary, all 169 Million bbl of the top ten 
Brands produced are similar in style, the South Americans 
drink a lot of beer and no, I don't get out much.   


Here's another tidbit from the same article: the top ten 
Brewers produced 348 Million bbl in 1993.  According to 
DeClerck, in 1958 the total world production was 300 
Million hectoliters or 213 Million bbl.


Soooooo.....here's today's top ten list:


Top 10 Imported Beer Brands (US)


1    Heineken        23.0%
2    Corona Extra    10.9%
3    Molson Golden   6.3%
4    Beck's          5.9%
5    Labatt Blue     5.9%
6    Amstel Light    3.7%
7    Foster's        3.2%
8    Guinness Stout  2.9%
9    Bass            2.7%
10   Tecate          2.6%
11   Moosehead       2.6%

13   Dos Equis       1.6%
14   Molson light    1.4%
15   St Pauli Girl   1.3%


OK, top 15. At least there is some flavor here! These 
brands include 75.3% of the market share for US imports.

Subject: Re: Pumpkin Ale




I've made two pumpkin ales - the second one is in primary right now.
Last year's pumpkin ale I made with an extract beer.  I cut the
pumpkin up, let it steep for 2 hours at 180 (to cook it) and then
steeped my specialty grains in the resulting water (at 150F).  


I removed the pumpkin using a stainless steel collander.  The beer
came out OK -- the real problem I had with that is that I used ONE
OUNCE of cloves.  I didn't know just how powerful they can be.


This year I did an all-grain.  First I cut the pumpkin into five
pieces (cut off the top in a pentagon shape and then cut down the side
to the bottom -- you can rip five pieces off easily).  Then I plunged
a temperature probe into it and heated it to 200F in the microwave.  


Next I stuck it in my mash water for 90 minutes at 150F.  The result
was pumpkin mash water.  I had a nice orange color to it that I added
to my grains and got a good orange-colored beer.  The wort did not
taste bitter, and I only used 1/4 ounce of a "Pumpkin Pie Spice" from
a local store.  The wort had a really nice aroma too it.  


I have high hopes (although my yeast starter may be a source of
concern, but that's for another day if this doesn't come out too
well).

Subject: Room temp keg.


I keep my keg at room temp and run the brew thru a filter, then 
through the cooling coils of a restaurant-style pop machine (hold
glass under tap and it fills). Of course, the CO2 pressure needs
to be 25-30 psi and so I have to dispense slowly or FOAM!!


But I am interested in hearing opinions on the storage of beer at
room temp. I make 10gal at a time, and I'm usually the only one
drinking it (fine by me!), so it takes me about 2 months to kill 
a batch. Do any of you feel that my beer is suffering at room 
temp? I've thought about getting a 'fridge for my keg, but if it
won't have a drastic effect, why bother? I think that this is one
of those issues that has no "right" answer, but I'd like your 
opinion. Email or post is fine. Thanks and keep on brewing!

Hello, with fall upon us I feel inclined to use some
of our local cider for a beer experiment. I have 
a recipe in mind but would like some comments before
I start the brew.


Actually my wife thought I was crazy; I just want 
a second opinion...


 1) bring 5.5 gals of FRESH cider to boil
 2) add 1 lb of clover honey
 3) add 4 lbs of light DME
 4) after 20 minutes add 2 oz cascades
 5) after 20 minutes add 1 oz cascades
 6) after  5 minutes chill to pitching temp
 7) pitch yeast
     I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE BEST YEAST TYPE TO USE
 7) goto secondary after primary activity slows
     A) make a slurry of 2 oz cascades
          use 1 cup of primary beer
     B) add slurry to secondary
     C) add the rest of beer to secondary
 8) complete the standard brew cycle


What I am shooting for is a brew that has LOTS of
hoppy taste and aroma. 


Please send comments to jpvrpc`at`aol.com .

best ales) to the bottom of the glass.  How do they do this?  By 
dispensing through an engine.  The method of dispense, be it out 
of a bottle or carbonated keg or engine, has a great impact on the
head retention in the glass.  Take two bottles of commercial beer 
of good quality.  Pour one in a glass being very careful to not 
agitate the beer, pour slowley down the side of the glass.  Then 
pour the other one vigorously into the center of the glass.  I 
would venture to bet that 90% plus beers will have better head 
retention in the second glass. 


The same is true from a keg, pour it careful and the head will 
not last as good. 


Now, since its Oktoberfest season, anyone notice how all of the
great Ofest beers of Munich have some of the absolute worst head
retention seen in any beer.  Must be something going on in the 
malt choices used in these beers.  Also, has anyone in the US 
seen Hacker Pschorr Ofest on draught?  I hear they didnt send
any draught beer over this year......Shame if true.


Good brewing,

Subject: More Ball Valve Mania


One more thing about ball-valves:  I've been told by a plumber friend that
even the good ball valves with the nylon/teflon insert can trap liquid in
them if you're not careful.  When you close a ball-valve, there is a cylinder
of liquid trapped in the valve, which isn't a big problem in itself, assuming
the last thing you run through the valve is boiling water or sanitizer.  The
potential problem is that there are other cavities inside the valve which
might retain liquid even when you leave the valve open between brew
sessions.  Closing the valve traps wort inside the valve; opening the valve
allows most of the liquid to be flushed out, but some could be left behind in
a cavity.  My friend recommended that I flush any ball valve with sanitizer
by opening and closing it several times while the sanitizer is flowing, and
running it for a while with the valve half-open.  This is what I'll do in the
future.  I assume these problems go away if you buy a valve specifically made
for this type of application (food-grade).

If there is a small leak, as you say there always is, the beer will 
eventually go flat if pressure from the tank is not available to make up 
for pressure lost through the leak.

this is exactly what i do also.  i have a 10#er that has not been refilled
in over 18 mos.  i've dispensed 15-20 kegs with it and force-carbo'd at
least 5 of those.  still going.  what i do is blast CO2 in it up to about
20#, dispense until it is very slow, then reload w/ CO2.  the only time i
keep it on is when i have a pahty.

    In HBD 1539, Mike Teed talks about variations in the Weihanstephan 3068 
yeast.  One variable I have not seen mentioned concerning the phenolics is
the number of generations from the original wyeast package.  I tasted my
weizen last night which was fifth generation from the wyeast package.
Definitely more clove and less banana than the first batch from the wyeast
package.  I also recall talking to the brewer at the Baltimore Brewing
Company in which he said that they culture up new yeast from slants every
five batches for their weizen because of yeast mutations.  Any one else

I while ago I posted a question about water filters.  First I want to 
thank those who responded to my question (John Thrower, Stephen 
Harrington, Mark Fredrickson, Bob Wood, Barry, Barry Nisly, Chris Weight, 
and Clay?).  After reading the responses, talking to local brewing 
buddies and doing research at the local library I have decided to get an 
undersink filter with a sediment and activated charcoal filter that is 
silver impregnated.  The sediment filter (5 microns) will get rid of most 
undisolved solids.  The activated charcoal will get rid of most of the 
chlorine in the water.  The silver impregnation will help keep bacteria 
from living in the filter.  At present I have only found one filter of 
this sort and it is $185 at the local homebrew shop.  The owner of this 
store said that he tops off his caroys straight from the water tap.  With 
my local water (Louisville, Ky) this should not pose much of a problem.

Subject: Carboy crates


Sorry it took so lond to respond but I'm fighting whatever's going around
with antibiotics and decongestants and I'm not exactly sure I'm here. The
carboy crate was modeled after a commercial version that I purchased about
20 years ago from a lab supply house. So, I don't have"plans", just a
description. The outside dimensions are 13" square and 24" high. It's made
from firring(?) strips that are 1/2"X 2 1/2"X L and resembles a box kite.
There are 4-24" pieces ,8-12" pieces and 10-13" pieces. The 24" pieces are
uprights and there are 4 wood bands around the circumference with
alternating 12" and 13" pieces, one at the top and one at the bottom. And
finally, there are 2X13" pieces across the bottom( 2 1/2" up from the
floor) as a seat for the carboy, close enough together to seat the carboy
upside down. all joints are screwed and glued. The dimensions are for a
narrow mouth 5 gal. carboy. The large mouth Pyrex(TM) carboys are shorter
and larger in diam.and the crate will have to be scaled up.I hope this
makes sense and is helpful. 
I would also like to mention that most wholesalers carry  odd sugars;
demerara, treacles and such. Most also carry books on making hard cider,
but there's not a lot of retailers that can afford to stock such items. Ask
your dealer to special order these for you. G.W Kent and Crosby&Baker are
two wholesalers that carry a large inventory.( No affiliation, just trying
to be helpful.)

Could you include what temp and pressure you keep your keg at in the basement?
I'm asking how using the cooling plate affects your carbonation.

Subject: ? on liquid yeast use


Yesterday (or the day before) someone posted a note about using Wyeast<tm>
liquid yeast packs without starters.  Their point was that if you did this,
you were asking for infection problems and high final gravity beer.
The infection part makes sense to me, since there is definitely a much longer
lag time when you pitch a yeast pack directly (I've done so with my last 3
batches).  Unless your sanitation is very good, other micronasties can take
over before your yeasties get going.
But why should underpitching (which is what I'm doing) result in a beer with a
higher final gravity than if a starter is used?  It will take longer to reach
optimum yeast concentration in your wort, but once this level is reached, why
sould fermentation stop prematurely and leave me with a high F.G. beer?  Am I
missing something?  If so, what?  Private email is fine; if I get some
worthwhile info I will post it here.  Thanks

Subject: Triple Bock/Sanitation/Seattle Brewery tours


I enjoyed David Eichler's response to Gregg Carrier's query regarding Sam 
Adam's Triple Bock, and very much agree with his analysis.  I thought of 
a port with a lingering maltiness when I tried it.  But FYI, those of you 
in the San Francisco area, the Toronado (547 Haight St.) has it and sells 
a 3 1/2-4 oz portion for, I think it was $2.50.  This is a far cry from 
the $110 and probably a good idea before making your investment.  All 
standard disclaimers apply re:  Toronado.


Now for a sanitation question.  I have a couple of those 5L mini-kegs 
that friends gave me upon graduation.  I have had sanitation problems 
with them.  Needless to say, it is heartbreaking to lose 5L at a time, 
even though it's not the full 5 gallons.  I've been using bleach as my 
sanitizer, in generous proportions.  I had one keg pop out on top and had 
to dump it.  The next time, I used the same bleach method, then put my 
bottles and kegs in the oven at 200^ F for 30 minutes.  One of the kegs 
REALLY popped out on both ends and launched the plug across the yard when 
I took it outside to relieve the pressure.  My understanding is that the 
200^x30' should have taken care of any mini-critters trying to get a 
foothold.  Is my problem during the siphoning phase?  Did something find 
it's way into my keg between the oven and capping, or is my 
sterilization/sanitation procedure faulty?  Any help would be 
appreciated.  Also, anyone have experience with using a dented 
5L keg?  Should I just scrap them?  Private email at <sturdy`at`itsa.ucsf.edu>.
TIA


And a contribution to the HBD, so I don't appear to be using this forum 
strictly for I own advantage. ;-}  Went to Seattle recently and went to a 
number of the local brewpubs and a couple breweries. (Thank you everyone 
who responded to my request for info on the Northwest Ale Festival.) 


 The tour at the Redhook Brewery was informative and they let you taste a 
4 oz sample of each of the beers they have on tap at the time you tour.  The 
cost was $1 and you get to keep your nifty tasting glass.  The beers, as 
always, were wonderful.  They had a special rye beer that was very 
pleasant and enjoyable for a lighter beer, even though I'm usually 
predisposed to their ESB.  The only problem at Redhook is you have to 
wait for your friends to meet you at the pub prior to the tour, and 
depending on how early you are, you can find yourself sampling pitchers 
before you go taste the rest in 4 oz glasses.  Thank you to the folks at 
Redhook for not asking us to leave.


Rainier Brewery was fun also.  They have a 20' video on the (tongue in 
cheek) history of beer to start off the tour.  The tour itself is a 
pretty cursory, quick look at this, quick look at that, kind of affair.  
But it was intelligible and noone was real excited about standing around 
in 50^ rooms asking questions.  We got our chance toward the end of the 
tour, which brings us to the best part.  Rainier is part G. Heilleman (I 
just know I mispelled that) which means that they make more than just 
Rainier, Rainier Ale, Rainier Ice, etc.  They had 9 beers on tap, and 
allowed each person 3, 10 oz glasses.  So take 2 friends.  The tour was 
free, and the beer consisted of Emerald City Pale Ale, another Emerald 
City ale, Henry's, the Rainiers, Schmidt's, etc.  The Emerald Cities were 
pretty good, and Rainier Ale and Henry's are not at all bad when they're 
that fresh.  They also have a store off the "Mountain Room" in which one 
may buy cheap fridge magnets, bottle openers, pens, fairly cheap glasses 
and pitchers, and not-so-cheap apparel.  


How about some of you out there letting us live vicariously through your 
travels?  Lots of requests for info on brewpubs and trips to Europe.  
What was it like being there?  


Happy brewing,

From: Bob Paolino
      Research Analyst
Subject: using coconut


I received a homebrew shop ad in the mail that reminded me of a less
than successful experiment of about a year ago. The ad offered a recipe
for a coconut brew done with a bottle of flavouring rather than the real
thing. My experiment was with shredded/flaked coconut--not quite the
real thing, but closer than a bottle.


I boiled the coconut with the wort and ended up with a lot of oil
nonetheless. It tasted okay, but the oils left a ring in the neck of the
bottle (I don't believe it was an infection) and wonderful little things
floating around. (BTW, it took third place in the Chicago Beer Society's
Spooky Brew "Big Muddy" category--in honour of the Mississippi River
floods. The scoring was in negative numbers, and I scored big for good
gushing qualities and lost negative points for it being somewhat
drinkable and having a little too much clarity or something like that.)
:-)


Seeing the recipe made me think about trying a coconut brew again (not the
light-bodied one in the ad, but something), but I don't like the idea of
using flavourings. If I'm going to do a fruit beer, I want to use fruit
rather than extracts; similarly, if I'm going to do a coconut beer, I
want to use coconut.


Has anyone had any success using coconut in beer? Flakes or fresh? What
about the sugary canned stuff used for pina coladas?


How do you deal with the oils? Suggestions on when to add? I'm hesitant
about adding anything to the secondary other than more hops, but if
someone can make a good case, I'll listen.

Hi Everyone,


This is my first post (said with some trepidation fearing
a good hot flaming, but I have checked with everyone I know
and every book I own [quite a few]).


I am submitting this to both the HBD and Mead digest in the
hopes that someone out there can help me. The recipe is based
on a cider posted to HBD 14 Sept by MR_SPOCK`at`delphi.


Problem: My brew in the primary (recipe below) is SUCKING air.
        Yes, the temperature is stable since it has been 4 days
        since I sealed the primary.  Yes, I pay undue detail to
        sterilization.


4 gal fresh pressed cider (got it fresh from the Apple Barn,Fitchburg,MA
5 lbs wildflower honey     "                                            "
1 gal water (to boil honey)
1 tsp tannin
1 tsp acid blend
American Ale yeast (from a starter solution done 24 hours earlier)
        (Yeast from Yeast Labs, distributed by KENT)
SG=1.068
I did not use any campden tablets as I don't want the sulfites.


As mentioned, I made a yeast starter 24 hours ahead of time with a
fermentation lock on the jug.  Bubbling about once every 30 seconds
before I pitched it. I use a plastic primary (from any standard beer/wine
starter kit) which showed some pressure after sealing. (Lock is pushed to
the top due to the sealing action of the lid).


Sunday afternoon - sealed primary fermenter
Monday morning   - lock has settled on to the vent tube
Monday night         - lock empty of water, add more
Tuesday morning  - "                            "
Tuesday night    - lock empty. I pour water in and WATCH the fermentation 
                        lock devour the water.  I'm serious.  I repeatedly
                        poured water in and watched the lock suck it up
                        in less than a minute.  Popped the top on the 
                        fermenter.  Smelled fine and nothing leapt out at me.
                        Boiled two ounces of yeast nutrient and threw it in.
                        Also pitched, without a starter, another vial of yeast.
                        (What do I have to lose now but the yeast?). 
                        Stirred and Resealed. 


Wednesday morning
Wednesday night
Thursday morning  - My brew is still very thirsty and will drink what I give
                    it. 


Has anyone ever seen this?  Am I harboring an alien bacteria that will make
my and my friends miserable (sick)? I am by no means a master or even advanced
brewer but this has me stumped, nervous, anxious... 


Guess I'll run on home and have a homebrew (hmm, my brown ale or spring bock?)


Thanks in advance and I'll summarize any (if there are any) responses.

I have been unable to find this sort of style info (I know I 
know, SUDS has it, but not all of us use *spit* DOS or *small 
spit* windows).  


Could I put a vote in for the normal style guidelines ot be put 
in as well ...  or is this info archived on Sierra? I hope not,
or my butt will be TOAST ... thanks for the info too Rich, looks
like a great idea, I'd like a copy when it is finished.

Subject: CO2 life


Hi All


Lee Boland asks about CO2 life.


My experience using a Johnson Enterprises TapRite draft beer kit with 5 lb
cylinder for 10 years has been to get about 3 years service out of one
charge for dispensing of 1/2 barrels with both two prong and ball taps. I
have not had any problems with leaks and leave the CO2 on till keg is empty
and only turn it off when empty.


I also have the cylinder in the frig and have had no problems with
moisture however, I can see where this might be a problem if using the
cylinder out side of the frig to purge systems etc. because of
condensation. The instructions that came with the kit said to mount the
cylinder in the frig.


The colder frig does lower the pressure in the tank to apx. 500 psi`at` 40deg
F (875psi `at` 70deg F) but this should have no effect on the dispensing
pressure of <10 psi.


In order to determine apx. how much CO2 is left in your cylinder weigh it
and subtract the the tare weight (stamped on side of cylinder).


        Cheers, Dan
