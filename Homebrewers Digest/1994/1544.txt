The "point" is valid as long as the temperature of the contents of
the cylinder is below the critical temperature (87.9 F). Above that
temperature the contents are gas and the pressure gauge reading is
proportional to the quantity remaining (P = nRT/V). Keep this in mind
for hot summer days. I do _not_ recommend heating up your gas bottles
to see how much is left. Better to weigh them.

Hi - I'm looking for some pumpkin ale help.
It will be a full mash with cooked pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices.
1.  Any recommendations on the maximum pumpkin to grist ratio?
    (I will be using two row)
2.  There seem to be a few options for adding spices:
    - in the boil
    - at the end of the boil
    - In the primary / secondary
    - make a tea and add this to the keg
3.  How much spice?
4.  Cinnamon? Allspice? Nutmeg?
Any input would be appreciated.

I am building a new SS lauter tun and have been considering ways to heat 
the unit with an externally mounted electric unit.  I first thought about
mounting an element from an electric range on the bottom of the tun, but
the curved bottom of a sankey keg does not make this feasible.  What would
work better is a heat cable wrapped around the keg.  This would supply a 
more uniform heat.  I am trying to find a source for a 110 or 220v resistance
heat cable.  I was told that the heat cables for preventing freezing pipes
would not get hot enough.  I would be interested in hearing from anyone
who has tried this idea or knows if a heat cable flexible enough to wrap
around a keg is available.

I just cracked my raspberry wheat beer that I bottled about 3 weeks ago and
it is nothing less than fantastic.  One of my less beer-loving friends says
it is the best beer I have ever brewed, and while I don't necessarily agree
to that extent, it is very good.  It has a wonderful raspberry aroma, and
just enough raspberry aftertaste to put you in raspberry heaven after you've
consumed about 1/3 of the bottle, but not enough to make it taste like
cordial.  The recipe was also one of the simplest I've done - I just used:


1 can, Edme Weizen extract (and the accompanying dry yeast)
1 kg dextrose
500 mL raspberry juice (I found it in a Greek food warehouse)
15g Saaz hops (dry hop)
1/2 cup cracked crystal malt


This was, of course, a 22 L batch.  The Edme yeast fermented out very cleanly,
with no interfering flavours, the addition of the extra Saaz hops was a
bloody good idea in my opinion :) (not *my* idea though - pilfered from the
Cat's Meow) and the crystal malt probably helped the flavour profile with
its complex sugars, although it didn't affect the colour whatsoever.

I'd just like to point out that all dried yeasts are not the same.  In
fact, much like with liquid yeasts, different dry yeasts contibute their
own signature to the finished product.  Try brewing two batches with
the only difference being EDME vs Windsor.  The difference is dramatic!

Subject: "Half" batches


I've just started homebrewing, though I've been lurking here for several weeks.
I just bottled a 5-gallon wonderful smelling nut brown ale (my Very First
Batch), and I'm ready to start another batch.


However, I don't drink that much -- I'm much more interested in variety.  So
I'd like to start brewing what I think of as "half" batches (~ 3 gallons).
Does anyone have any experiences they can share with me regarding 3-gallon
batches (such as how much to cut the ingredients, whether the 6 1/2-gallon
fermenting bucket is still usable, etc.)?


Thanks!

I wanted to add some comments to Martin's reply to David Allison about
the Gold Country Brewers and their "Stout Bout".  First of all, I have
run an AHA sanctioned competition, so I am familiar with Martin's
experience regarding volunteer help.  Answering questions from brewers
while trying to check in entries is very difficult given the number of
volunteers available.


I think in this case, it seems fairly clear that David's entry was not
received, so I wouldn't assume fraud on the part of the Gold Country
Brewers.  Face it, there's not really much motivation to do this
(especially if you're not cashing their check) and I would guess that
Martin is like the rest of us and takes running a competition very
seriously. 


I would add, though, that even if I were sending *all* of the paperwork to
the AHA immediately, I would keep a copy of most of the material,
especially the list of entries and the placing finishers.  I'd want
this, not only to be able to answer questions like Davids', but also
because...well, things get lost in the mail.

I have been wondering about this so called Tripple Bock that
Jim Koch has been pushing of late.  Turns out its not a bock
at all, but merely a strong Barley Wine.  The beer is produced
with a top fermenting ALE yeast, then hit with a Champagne 
yeast to help finish the fermentation.  On top of this, it
has a sugar adjunct added, which of course is very non -
Reinheitsgebot.  Guess he wont be marketing this baby in 
Germany!   


Just goes to show, in the US you can call it whatever you want.


Good marketing,

Well I just got back from a great visit to 
Scotland, and I must say I really enjoyed 
the cask-conditioned ales.  I had a great 
tour of the Caledonian Brewery in 
Edinburgh.  I will post a description in a 
day or two, but first I need help quickly, 
and I knew without the passage of a mental 
health care bill, the HBD was the next best 
place.


1.  I plan to make a dry hard cider this 
weekend with raw cider from the mountains 
of Virginia.  I will pitch with a dry 
London Ale yeast from Canada.  Should I 
either boil or heat the cider  to 190 F 
(before pitching) to kill any bacteria or 
wild yeast or will that risk setting the 
pectin?


2.  I recently made an "authentic porter" 
using 5 lbs. of D-C Pale malt and 2.5 lbs. 
of home made brown malt by gently roasting 
some more pale malt.  "To this was added 
2.5 lbs. of D-C biscuit malt, 0.5 lbs. 
caramunich, and 0.5 lbs. black malt.  The 
O.G. was 1.050.  This was then pitched with 
 a wyeast 1028 starter, shaken, etc. and 
fermented for 4 days at approximately 68 F 
then racked  (gravity: 1.030).  The gravity 
is still 1.030 almost 1 month later so I 
decided to keg this one.  Has this truly 
fermented out and the the brown malt has 
added dextrins and nonfermentables or do I 
have a stuck fermentation?  It doesn't 
taste sweet -- just like a nice smooth 
porter.  Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Caramel in beer


In response to todays HBD, Kirk Harralson related his experiences with 
caramel.  Cooked sugar is nothing to play with.  Sugart caramelizes at 
temperatures over 300^ and like Kirk stated will stick to your skin and 
seal all of the heat undera blanket of hot sugar.  You will get very bad 
burns if not careful.  The correct technique for adding hot sugar ( 
caramelized or not0 is to temper the sugar solution with a small amount 
of cool liquid prior to adding to the entire batch.  Simply put this 
involves adding a small amount of cool liquid TO the hot sugar.  NOT the 
other way around.  This technique has several effects.  It sets the color 
of the sugar (which can also be done with the addition of a few drops of 
lemon juice) as caramel will continue to darken even when you take it off 
the heat.  It also moderates the temperature of the hot sugar and 
contains the "explosion" in a small space that is still manageable.  This 
technique is almost universal in cooking.  You always add a small amount 
of cold liquid to the hot liquid prior to adding the entire contents to 
you pot/mixer etc.  If done correctly, this will provide a safe method 
for adding HOT (over boiling temp for water) liquids to a recipe.

I really enjoyed Scott Bukofsky's "First year reflections".  You've obviously
learned quite a bit in that year, Scott.  Well, at least I think so, since I
agree pretty much with everything you said.  I *still* havent' gotten away
from "trying everything but the kitchen sink", but I'll learn one day.

Kirk Harralson, I too, experienced something similar with making caramel at
home.  I splattered a bit of the molten sugar on my hand, a small spot about
the size of a pea.  I immediately, like within half a second, sucked it off
my hand into my mouth.  It didn't burn my mouth, in fact it wasn't even very
hot, but it blistered my hand right away.


I poured the hot caramel into a container to use in tomorrow's brew session.
It is hardened, but I don't think I'll have any trouble melting it in the
kettle.  This is probably the advised method for using caramel (I'm talking
about cooling it first, NOT burning your hand first).

Hi Group, Meant to send this sooner but I have been busy. 
On Sunday, I ran more lead removal experiments. (Had to go buy more Home Test
Kits). With the 2/1 volume ratio of vinegar to H2O2, complete lead removal took
between 10 and 15 minutes. The soft buttery gold color can be used as a good
indicator that the process is complete. Preliminary results last week had
indicated less time, but with the revised 2/1 ratio, the brass can be left in
the solution longer without blackening or pitting. So, 10-15 minutes.

Our club has regularly participated in all club only events for three years 
or so.  We have always got our results from the AHA in a timely manner, 
except the time the box the entry was in got crushed on a loading dock.  
Since our membership spans the states of New Hampshire and Massachusetts we 
have on rare occasions had problems getting the entry forms to the club 
representative, James Spence has always been helpful in this regard by 
mailing a set to the party in need.


IMHO the club only competitions mirror HB competitions in general some are 
run better than others.  Entrants in any HB competition should realize 
these are run on volunteer labor.


Our club, The Brew Free or Die Homebrew Club of New Hampshire, is hosting

compensation from the AHA.  One member will be accepting 50-70 UPS packages 
at their home, probably in a 10 day span.  These entries will be 
transported to another member's home who is donatining their beer 
refridgerator space for all the entries and their home as a judging site 
too.  Other members will serve as stewards and judges some of whom will 
drive 50 or miles to volunteer.   Homebrewing is a hobby.

Juicer Rundown:  Had a couple favorable messages on use of these
steam juicers- enough so that I think I'll go for it.  


BUT: I'm not gonna bother you all with WHO posted to me, since I've
already thanked them in private!


Yes more gadgets from ACME for the Coyote's brewing efforts.
Seen one for ~$20-30.  Catalog number Bu11Shee1t.  ACME products     :)
(actually at a local cheapo store- same supplier of the Coyote Cooker!


I like the idea that the "juice comes out sterile due to the steam"
and it's "clear- no pulp"  and can be collected in "sterile hot
champagne bottle" and "stored as is until it's needed for beer or wine"
(indirect quotes...just off the top of my furry head)


***
Contest Entries never arrive.  


Hmm-  could we blame to post office?   Nah.


I support Martin's right to publicly defend himself against this attack.
It seems like the CORRECT step of contacting the AHA- didn't happen.


Plus- hey, if the check didn't get cashed- seems like SOMETHING is wrong!
I know for a fact that if a box leaks during transport- it gets dumped.
SO- if something cracked in the box en-route, that was the end of it.
One of the wonders of our great postal services is how packages can get lost
or discarded, and if there is no insurance, well they just dissapear.
No notification WHATEVER.  You just get that carefree, snide, ignorant look
from the person behind the counter saying, "I don't know anything about it
and I'm not really going to try to find out for you either, you're just SOL".


I had a computer disk and a bag of...woodruff that was supposed to come my way.
It never did.  My guesses:  1. it was lost,  2. someone opened it, found the
baggie of brown leaves, and thought it was "something else" and either
sent it to the authorities, or sampled some.  I hope that had a FIERSE headache
and a NASTY cough!  Strange thing was a bill from the city was never delivered
around the same time.  SO go figure.


There have been stories/cases of shipments/boxes mysteriously dissapearing
from airline baggage areas, and delivery trucks.  Espcially things labelled
like- Case of Beer, Valuable Delicate Fragile Commodity, Do Not Drop.


My advise- Package EXCESSIVELY.  Bubble wrap bottles, pack FIRMLY with 
packing popcorn. Use oversized boxes.  Do not let bottles touch in the box.
Securely bag up bottles- water tight!  Hell- insure the thing, claim an
excessively high value on it!  They leave that up to you.  If they lose it
you WILL collect.  Perhaps enough to cover a WHOLE new batch of brew,
or even a stainless steel pot if you really exagerate!    


Also:  Use reverse psychology.  Print in bold letters on the outside:


    Please Kick.   Throw this box against brick walls.  Drop from truck.
    Anyside but this one up.  Hit with baseball bat. Stack VERY high!
    Please open and check contents, then reclose VERY poorly.  I love you!

Articles to Zymurgy?  


Al seems to have claimed credit for the bubble theory.  I seem to remember
a long discussion about this concept some time back, and a generalized 
consensus was that the nasties will persist inside the bubble and move right
on through that little gadget.  But...maybe it was Al who came up with that
theory.  It's his now it seems.  I'm not going to check the archives to prove
it one way or another.  


My question here is:  Since this is clearly a flawed gadget concept what is
it doing getting published in a "big" magazine like zymurgy?  


What does it take to publish an article in zymurgy and what do you get for it.
Money, fame, floozy women (or men), free beer and brewing supplies?


What if I want to publish something in the magazine- just write up what could
easily be an HBD article, and send it to them instead (or as well as).
Do I have to be any more correct that I do for the HBD? (which certainly isn't
the case- had you all believing the peat wood thing didn't I-  I thought I
was right, therefore I was right - for my own little world!  But I still
think propane isn't the right heat source for a good smoke!  Anyone ever
try smoking hops?)




***
I haven't gotten any response on the carboy handle question.  So-
here it is again:


    How/Where do you attach it for a 7 Gal acid bottle? On the threaded
    portion, or lower down?


The only suggestion was to use a milk crate for carrying.  I know that one.
(thanks anyway Domenick) but it doesn't help for rinsing and general 
fondling of the carboy.  Plus some of fermometers are place too low for
that to work (ooops)


***
Finally- my old plea-  that people put their 


                    internet address at the end


of their posts.  I don't need to know where you work and don't care how
cute you can draw a mug of beer  :)  but I can't work backwards in a digest
(can you?) and for direct responses it's nice to have the e-mail add at the 
end.  I usually don't know if it's worth a response till I've read the message
by then the header is gone!    Just my personal preference.

Subject: Lagering


I am starting my first lagering job and I am not sure about a few things.


1)  What is the lowest temperature which I should lager at and does the
    temperature make any difference in the quality of the brew?  Obviously
    time does, but I am in no particular rush.


2)  Should I be lagering from day one or wait a few days before moving the
    beer to the colder area?


3)  Should I be racking the beer at some time or do all of the fermentation
    in the primary fermenter?  And if so, doesn't the racking leave behind
    the yeast (after all, it is bottom fermenting!)


Basically, should I treat it like an ale or just leave it alone?!


TIA

Hi!  Please note that I'm posting this for Karl- try to send any
replies to his address.....


thanks,
bob dougherty


Here it is:


**********************************************************************
 
In his book on continental pilsners, Dave Miller states that DMS production
takes place in hot wort (after the boil), but no longer takes place once the
wort is cooled.  Does anybody have any idea what at what rate the DMS is
produced.  For instance, if the cool down rate from boiling to 50 F is 1.5
hours versus 30 minutes could the amount of DMS go from below the taste
threshold to above the taste threshold by using the slower cool down rate?  Or
is the increase in DMS negligible?  Thank you.

Hi all.  I was wondering if someone can tell me more about the affects of

books but he doesn't seem to write much about how it affects the taste, 
body etc.  I'm planning on brewing a cranberry wheat beer from the latest

surup and was thinking about adding this to the recipe.  Any info would be

Subject: Wheat malt extract?


Does anyone out there know of a 100% wheat malt extract other than 3 kg cans of
Ireks? (I assume it's 100% because the ingredients list is: Wheat, Water.) The
homebrew shop owner said it's the only one he knows about, and only that size.


It's not that I'm looking to do a 100% wheat brew. I have the Briess weizen
extract (60-40, I believe) in my kitchen, but it's too dark for what I want to
make, and I want the 100% wheat to blend with a light (barley) extract.


I bought the stuff because that's what he had, but it's more than I need
in one brew, considering that I'll be adding other fermentables.


1) Are there other 100% wheat extracts?  Do they come in smaller sizes?


2) May I correctly assume that the Ireks will be fairly light in colour, or
   have I not really solved my problem?


3) The other ones he had were Briess (liquid and dry--I've used both) and
   M&F (haven't used).  Is the M&F (40-60) any good, and is it very light?


Private email okay, but this might be worth posting for others.  TIA.

Hey compadres,


Long time no speak. Thought I'd chime in on the bottle issue. As far 
as unmarked brown bottles go I have a hard time doin' better than 
budswillmillers etc. Steve Robinson writes in lament, "gimme 
something I can drink!"( Not a direct quote). Why drink swill? I just 
mosie on over to the local pub and buy the empties. For about a $1 I 
get a case of 12 oz. bottles in a nifty box(Good for stacking in the 
basement!) Check around at establishments in your area, its likely 
you can score some empties if you play your cards right.


For that matter, any person I've ever known that both drinks beer and 
knows I brew, eventually shows up at my door with bags of various 
bottles. "Can you use these?" they say as I graciously smile and say 
"Ahhh, sure." I take em and sort them into two piles- those I want 
and those I don't. Recycle the ones I don't and bolster my bottle 
collection with the ones I do. In fact my bottle needs rarely exceed 
my stock. Unless I get a little overzealous brewing beers of every 
different kind.


Anyhow, just a couple of ideas for the oft-maligned bottler(read not 
enough dough to keg).


Adios

Subject: Vitamin C as antioxidant


I heard from a local brewshop that one can use Vitamin C
(not the pills, but Ascorbic Acid crystals) as an 
antioxidant when mixing priming sugar in the carboy, etc.
prior to bottling.


Does anyone have any experience with this and what flavor 
changes, etc. may occur?  Also what is the recommended 
quantity to use for a 5 gal. quantity?


The reason all this comes up is that in order to get a good
mix of priming sugar, since I batch prime (too lazy to prime
each bottle or container), I heard that one should put priming
sugar in empty carboy first, so that when the new beer was 
racked into it, a good mix was established and even carbonation 
in each bottle would result.  Well, I've had good mixing action,
but it seems that the extra racking step could introduce more
air than might be desirable.  Any comments?


Thanks,
George Danz

Subject: Stout Bout:  The Last, I Hope


My apologies to David Allison for unloading on him in HBD 1532, and
to the readership of HBD for subjecting them to the blast.  David
and I have been in touch via email, and I'm now convinced that
what he intended to say was very different from my interpretation
of his message.


I did get several email messages on the subject (only one of which
was completely foolish), and a consistent question was why I didn't
retain records of the contest results, rather than send everything 
back to the AHA.  The reason is directly related to the nature of
the AHA-sponsored "Club-Only" competitions.  They are fundamentally
different from the customary AHA-sanctioned competitions.  All checks
are made out to the AHA, and the AHA announces the results.  They are
the sponsors of the contest, and the club doing the judging is acting
as a contractor to them.  The AHA reimburses such expenses as cups,
copying, postage, bread and water, and provides a list of BJCP judges 
in the area.  The club that does the work pays for pretty much anything 
else that may be needed, such as food for the judges, if you don't do the
whole thing in a single session.  If your club is thinking about doing
one of these, be advised that it will be a hit on your treasury, as
well as an, er, interesting experience.  All entry forms, etc., are 
sent to the AHA as soon after the judging as is possible, and all
questions concerning these contests should be directed to the AHA.
The only real argument for keeping a copy of everything would be
in case the mailing to the AHA were to disappear, but with Express
Mail that's a pretty rare event, and if necessary the records could
be reconstructed from the registrar's spreadsheet.  It would be the 
AHA's job, then, to try to get duplicate checks for the entry fees.


Another key to this situation is that it's sadly common for beer
to disappear in shipment.  If you're shipping via USPS and they
guess what it is, it's gone.  UPS appears to have no consistent
policy;  some locations will either return or seize any shipment
that they suspect contains alcohol.  FedEx has never failed me, but
they're _very_ expensive.


So I hope this puts the question to rest, and allows us to go on
in peace.

Subject: Stout Bout Apologies




Sorry I don't have any of those cool mail tools to cut and paste comments.


First -
My apologies to Martin and the Gold Country Brewers Assoc. for my curt 
comments regarding my Stout Bout entry (or lack of).  In trying to make my 
post short, I connected their fine club and the way AHA sponsored club 
competitions are handled.  I certainly did not mean to slander Martin or
the GCBA -- and for that misunderstanding -- I am truly sorry.  


To make a short post long, and to explain myself (perhaps I should keep my 
mind shut) -- I didn't mean to imply that the GCBA "deep-sixed" my 
paperwork/check and just drank my beer (did I say that?).  When I called 
the GCBA to find out if my beer was received/judged -- Martin told me that 
all paperwork was sent off to the AHA, because that how the AHA sponsored 
homebrew comps are handled.  Martin was polite and helpful on the phone 
as I have found him to be on the HBD.


My frustrations arise from the method in which AHA sponsored competitions 
are handled, which the GCBA followed (as required).  The only way I
could find out if my beer was received was to wait for my scoresheets to
arrive from the AHA or my check to be cashed.  From my understanding,
the AHA is notoriously slow in this process (sorry if that is slander).
I waited a few months before posting my poorly written HBD post.


I didn't have Martin's or the AHA's e-mail addresses (I do now) and should 
have written them personally regarding the final results. One purpose in
writing to the HBD was to get a dialog with other HBDers with regards
to problems in getting competition results from the AHA in a timely 
manner.  I understand that I am not the only one.  Perhaps it would be 
better if the AHA let the homebrew club deal with tabulating the results 
and sending them to the entrants.  This is what is done with AHA sanctioned
competitions.  Then the sponsoring homebrew club could send 
the final results to the AHA along with other pertainant info to the AHA.
I am sure there is a problem with this that I don't foresee, but at least 
homebrewers wouldn't have to wait months to find out if their beer had
indeed been received and judged.


I have subsequently found out that indeed the scoresheets have been sent
out and checks have been cashed.  I guess I have to dig-out my cancelled
checks to see if mine was ever cashed and that will tell me if my entry got
lost in the mail or the scoresheets were -- I suspect that my entry was
lost (drag).  I was very careful in sending it.


BTW, I have been involved (volunteered) in large competitions and do
realize the effort that is put into them.  I have also entered competitions
and have always received my scoresheets in a reasonable timeframe. Again,
I had no idea if the the AHA was just being slow -- which leads me to ...


Second... 
I have contacted the AHA _twice_ about the delay in receiving Zymurgy a 
month later than the local brew shops.  They informed me that the 
individual subscriptions go out in third class mail and the arrival of my 
magazine is up to the US Mail (Oh No!!).  Don - I am sorry to upset you 
also (I must have been having a bad mind day), but I am wondering why I 
should pay essentially the same money for Zymurgy to be sent to me a month 
later than I could get via the homebrew shop.


Are there others out there with these same issues/concerns/problems?


 - David


P.S.  I just received an email regarding the first post in the HBD.
This was never meant to be a me versus them issue -- let's keep it 
constructive.

Subject: Mashout




Over this past weekend I brewed a Northern Brown Ale
from a recipe in Miller's handbook (I don't recall the
name exactly right now), and used his suggested method
for doing a partial mash. It turned out to be a lot of
fun, and pretty low-tech. In all the excitement over
tasting the sweetness of the mash after the starch rest,
my partner and I forgot to do the mash-out step.


This was my first tinkering with all grain brewing,
and I'm curious what the effect of NOT conducting
the mashout could have on the brew. Any comments would
be appreciated.
