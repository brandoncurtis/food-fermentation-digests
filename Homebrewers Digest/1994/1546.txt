Argh!  One of my few informative posts to HBD and I skip important information!
With regards to my recipe for raspberry beer:


1 can, Edme Weizen extract (and the accompanying dry yeast)
1 kg dextrose
500 mL raspberry juice (I found it in a Greek food warehouse)
15g Saaz hops (dry hop)
1/2 cup cracked crystal malt


The hops were pellets, and were added to 500 mL of just-boiled water to
sterilise and expand them, and were then dumped into the fermenter.  The
raspberry juice was added to the hot wort immediately prior to adding cold
water to bring up the volume and cool to pitching temperature.  The
fermentation was a one-stage primary, because despite the name of the extract
the accompanying yeast is an ale yeast, and it was all over within 2 weeks.
Sorry about that dudes,

A member of our homebrew club brought in an ale that he had brewed with
maple syrup.  It was absolutely delightful!  Even more so considering
that it three (3) years old.  He said he used a grade of Vermont maple
syrup that is very dark.  It is the grade that is typically used in making
maple flavored candies.  It is not the grade that you would purchase for
using as syrup on pancakes.  I don't have his recipe, but I'd certainly
recommend trying a maple brew.

Ireks is the only 100% wheat malt extract I'm aware of and have only seen
it in 3.3 lb cans.

The lightest colored malt extracts are reported to be Alexander's.  I made
two weizens, one with Northwestern (Briess) wheat malt extract and one with
6.6 lb Ireks 100%  wheat malt extract plus 1.4 lb Alexanders light kicker.
The colors of both beers were very similar -- dark gold to amber.


Both weizens were pretty good beers.  However, in our homebrew club
competition, they only got average scores.  They were marked down, in
part, because their colors were too dark for the style and both lacked
wheat character (including the one with all the Ireks 100% wheat malt
extract!).  Moral of the story (for me at least) is that you can brew
a decent weizen with extract, but it will not be true to style.  For a
real, true to style weizen, you will need to do at least a partial mash
if not a full mash.

No, not according to my experience.

I have heard that Alexander's has the lightest color liquid malt extracts.


===> My editorial comment....


It's nice to see the civility expressed here in the Homebrew Digest.  When
David Allison made a post about a problem he had with an AHA Club Only
competition, Martin Lodahl posted a response addressing the issues raised
by David.  Offline, David and Martin corresponded and realized that they
had misinterpreted each others comments in the digest.  Both then posted
to the HBD to clarify what had happened, explaining their positions, and
interpretations.


Thank you.  It's refreshing to see two people handle a disagreement/mis-
communication on the net in such a gentlemanly manner.  We can all learn
from your example.

I have a couple of q's for those interested in answering...
I made my Xmas beer and it has turned out quite different than what I 
thought I was going to get.


Abominable Ale (Herb Ginger Beer) 
5 gallons


10.7#  British Unhp'd Light LME
3#     Light Clover Honey
1/2#   Wheat DME (60/40)

Grated peel of 4 oranges
4 oz.  Ginger, peeled, grated
1 1/2 tsp  cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
4 gr.  fresh mint leaves, chopped
1 1/2 tsp Irish Moss, rehydrated
1 pkg  Wyeast #1007 German Ale Yeast, in starter


Crystal malt in bag, to boil, turn off, add LME, WME, honey, Galena hops, half
of ginger & orange, all spices. boil 50 min.  add remainging ginger, orange
peel, hops and IM. Boil 10 min. Cool, sparge, aerate, pitch.


OG 1.107 `at` 80 deg= 1.110?
Primary for 20 days
Gravity at secondary 1.023 `at` 60 deg.


Questions......
80% attenuation?
Alchohol 8.7% (OG-FG=alchohol %)? or 11.2% (OG-FG x .129 per Williams 
catalog)??
Is this a Barleywine?
Is #1007 a real butt-kicker or what?
If its too strong to drink, can I cut it with water to weaken it?
Can I expect additional fermentation?
Will it rise out of my carboy and shape-shift into a smelly monster and 
eat me?


TIA to those kind souls who answer my silly questions.

Subject: mashout question summary




Thanks to everyone who answered my question about
the mashout. I'm posting a summary of those answers
here. The original question was:


>In all the excitement over
>tasting the sweetness of the mash after the starch rest,
>my partner and I forgot to do the mash-out step.
> 
>This was my first tinkering with all grain brewing,
>and I'm curious what the effect of NOT conducting
>the mashout could have on the brew.


There seems to be a consensus that there are two reasons
to conduct a mashout:
   1) make the mash sugars more soluble, so sparging is easier,
      and extract efficiency is greater.
   2) stop enzyme activity


Everyone said that as long as the sparge went well, the
enzyme activity will be stopped during the boil, so no "damage"
was done. It was pointed out, however, that not stopping the enzymes
at the right time could lead to over-converting, which results 
in a "thin" beer (lacking in body). Also, not controlling the time
when the enzymes stop will make the recipe less repeatable, and
"true to style".


Thanks again for all the replies,


Andy

Subject: Fuller Cask Ale/SA 3 Bock/Sankey Fermenters




On November 1, The Old Bay in New Brunswick, NJ starts Cask Conditioned
week with real Fullers cask conditioned ale served at cellar temp and pulled
from hand pump. I've heard a left coast bar will also get a delivery. The
Old Bay will have three others (Olivers, Oxford, and one more) on hand pump
the same week, but I'll be there for the Fullers.


I had a Triple Bock last weekend. The label said it was contract brewed
in California. Interesting.


For 3 years, I have been using 1/2 barrel Sankey kegs as fermenters with
great success. I put in on my King Kooker and boil to sanitize. To clean,
I used a soak of Super Washing Soda, which seemed to work. Earlier, I used
caustic and acid wash, but gave up with a small child helper in and around
the brewery. One particularly virgorous blow off left a stain on the 
underside of the top that I could feel with my fingers. That stain would
not go away. Last week, I decided to cut the top off and survey the damage.
I found what looked like rust stains above where the wort level would have
been. It was really dried krausen. With some elbow grease, I managed to
get it sparkling clean and I am doing an open ferment with a belgian strong
ale. The area in direct contact with the wort were clean, but they did have
a film of what I guess was beer stone.

Subject: small bottles / Rolling Rock offtaste / carboy vs. bottle maturing


I needed a source of small bottles for bottling my Imperial stout, but
could easily find only returnable Rolling Rock in 7 oz. bottles around
here (DC). Being a thrifty person, I've been drinking them to get the
empties instead of just dumping the beer.


Rolling Rock is not your usual bland megaswill -- it has an actively
unpleasant aftertaste. It's not easy to describe (vegetal? grassy?). Does
anyone know what causes that taste? I'd hate to have it in one of my own
beers. (It's not skunkiness. RR is in green bottles, but the cases are
well sealed against light, even the hand holds.)


Apparently no one knows anything about carboy vs. bottle maturation for
high-density beers, since no one answered my previous request except one
person who also wanted to know.

Many thanks to the people who responded to my "where can I get brown bottles
with no raised lettering" question.  The overwhelming consensus seems to be
to buy empty Bud longnecks from the local biker bar.  One person mentioned that
Anchor Steam (tm) bottles are regarded favorably by judges in spite of their
errant lettering.


Several people questioned whether the innocuous lettering around the bottom
is what this rule is all about.  The real problem seems to be trademarks and
things like Bass bottles that have lettering on the shoulder.  Can any of the
BJCP types out there comment on whether this rule is enforced to the letter
or the spirit?  I would hate to send some of my fine homebrew off to a
competition simply to have it disqualified for a bottle rule infraction.

  Hi Brew folks,


  According to Jim Busch, the new SA "Tripple Bock" is not a bock. He is
  right, however nor is it "Tripple". I have just finished (OK last night,
  I don't drink *purchased* alcohol at 9:30 am) a bottle of the stuff, and
  have mounted the most attractive bottle (JK's marketing smarts again rears
  it's ugly head)on my desk at work. It is Triple, not Tripple, a small point,
  but an important one as it reflects upon style. (Marketing vs. actual style
  of beer). With regard to the actual taste, clean, smooth, but not necessarily
  my cup of tea.


  As far as maple syrup is concerned, In all the hype for the SATB, the fact 
  that it is made with maple syrup was one of the facts I  was not aware of 
  when I purchased the bottle. I had heard the hype re: aging in JD casks,
  and 1lb of malt/bottle (sure), but nothing of the maple syrup (which I 
  believe Jim Busch made reference to by "sugar adjuncts") IMHO, this
  taste shines through very nicely and adds to the taste of this "Barley Wine"

My advice...
I found that leaving it in the glass carboy for two weeks instead of only 1
week does wonders for beer clarity and taste.  You just need to kick back, have
a homebrew and wait another week. 


 If in fact you do have a yeast infection, something is terribly wrong - I
thought 
only WOMEN can get those. Just kidding!!  Sorry, I am not sure how to solve the
yeast problem.

I've been very happy with the results I get from dry yeasts, which I use
for the same reasons you cite.  The main advantage of liquid yeasts is
variety -- you're not likely to see a dry witbier yeast any time soon,
or even a decent lager yeast.  For me, this is not a problem, because I
brew only British-style ales.  If you like brewing more exotic styles,
you may become frustrated by the limitations of dry yeast. 


The bad reputation of dry yeasts used to be well deserved.  Until a few
years ago, most dry yeasts included a substantial amount of wild yeast,
bread yeast, and bacteria.  In recent years, though, the technology for
drying yeast has improved dramatically, and there are definitely some
good dry yeasts available now.


One of the best dry yeasts these days is, oddly enough, Red Star, which
used to be the worst of the worst.  With the help of George Fix, they
selected a new strain and improved their drying process to keep out
contaminants.  The new Red Star is a very clean, reliable yeast, and
it's still dirt cheap -- about 50 cents a packet.


As for EDME, I've used it for many batches, with mostly good results. 
However, I recently brewed a batch with EDME that suddenly started a
second fermentation about 10 days after pitching (and several days after
all activity had apparently stopped).  I've heard of other cases of this
with EDME, which leads me to suspect that there may be some nasties in
the packet (wild yeast, perhaps), that take over when the main strain
finishes.

With regard to the post - I believe it was Norm - doesn't the AHA
also keep track of your BJCP experience points 'free' as long as 
you are an AHA member.  I seem to remember a note on the competition

Subject: Mashout, Carboy handles, Old Peculier, Zymurgy errors


(From *Jeff* Renner) 
Andy Patti was bad, and didn't conduct a proper mashout.  Shame!  We may 
have to revoke his brewer's certificate ;-)  Andy, don't worry.  The three 
main reasons to do a mashout are 1) to fix the ratio of different sugars at 
the end of the mash by destroying the starch converting enzymes and halting 
their action, 2) to reduce the viscosity of the sweet wort to improve lauter 
runoff, and 3) to increase the solubility of the sugars for greater 
efficiency.  Since most of your sugars in an extract and grain recipe were 
fixed by the manufacturer, #1 shouldn't be a problem, if you didn't have a 
problem with #2, you didn't have a problem, and it's too late to worry about 
#3.  Lots of fine all grain mashers can't be bothered with a mashout, and 
with the few grains in your partial mash recipe, it probably made no 
difference at all.  I'm glad you found it so much fun! 
 
Coyote (boy, did you get me with "INB*X Message!") still hasn't heard where 
to put the orange carboy handles on 7 gal. acid carboys.  I put 'em *below* 
the threads between the two ridges.  It seems much stronger there as well as 
a more secure place.  You do need to replace the bolt with a longer one (3 
in.).  I've cautiously lifted them by the handle and haven't had trouble yet 
 - maybe four years using the 7 gal. ones and handles.  Knock on wood.  The 
recent horror stories give me the willies. I often ferment my larger batches

Chuck E. Mryglot wonders about cloning Teakston's Old Peculiar (sic) and 
wonders what kind of ale it is.  Chuck, Old Peculier (note the peculiar 
spelling) is an old ale.  It reached near cult status in England during the 
70's real ale revival.  It's named after an old Church of England office.  
It could just as easily be named "Old Bishop."  Perhaps the peculiarity had 
to do with choir boys?  No, actually a Peculier was the authority over a 
district within a diocese that was not under the jurisdiction of the bishop. 
 Kind of an island, called a Peculiar.  Most folks seem to think the special 
flavor is caused by treacle, although Jackson attributes it to the mixed 
strain yeast and three sugars used.  I thought that treacle was different 
from molasses, but the new special issue Zymurgy says they're the same.  
They suggest a recipe of 12 lbs. English malt (or 9 lb. extract), 8 oz 40^ 
crystal, 8 oz. roasted barley, 2 lbs brown sugar, 2 oz. fuggles `at` 4% for 60 
minutes, 8 or 9 T lactose, 3 oz. blackstrap molasses and 1028 ale yeast for 
an OG of 1.060.  I have my doubts about this recipe.  Figuring on a modest 
30 points*gal/lb for 12.5 lbs of malt and 45 pgp for 2 lbs. of sugar 
(ignoring the lactose and molasses) would give 1.093!  That would be 
peculiar.  Their figures give only 16.8 pgp! 
 
Has anyone else noticed this kind of error in the new Zymurgy?  I've just 
skimmed it, but the article on brewing with oats has one recipe (Door County 
White) with no oats, six lbs. of grain for OG 1.060; oatmeal stout with 9 
lbs. of pale grains and an OG of 1.036 ( 20 pgp); and "Oat Sheaf Special" 
with 33 lbs. of grain for 12 gal for OG 1.050 (18 pgp).  I think the recipes 
must have been switched, but there's still way too much grain.  Somebody's 
asleep at the switch in Boulder!  When I've finished the issue, I'll write 
them.

What seems most likely to *me* is that it's a question of pressure.  If
the fermentation vessel is completely sealed, not only will you run the
risk of blowing things up, but that pressure *does* have a negative
effect on fermentation.  On the suggestion of my dad, a food scientist,
I keep the liquid level in my blow-off jar as low as possible.  He
wasn't certain, but seemed to think that a lot of water (say 2-3 quarts
in a gallon jar) might have an inhibitory effect.


What Wheeler was probably referring to when he said the fermentation
should "breathe" was that it have an opportunity to exhale.

I get to recommend ovens again!  Yes, the lab is right, and yes, you can
do it with beer bottles.  I bake them at 350F for 90 min, because I'm a
stick-in-the-mud and this was the procedure I learned.  I put tin foil
on the tops, too (gosh, I'm wonderful!) and pop the bottles back in
their cases.  Saves lots of time on bottling night.

Subject: Yeastlab and pectin "setting"


Hey all,


I recently made an extract-based blackberry pale ale according to a modified 
Papazian fruit-beer recipe.  i.e. I steeped the berries at the end of the 
boil at about 165 F for 20 minutes.  I did two-stage fermentation and bottled 
after about 3 weeks.  The bottled beer has been aging for about 3 weeks.  The 
problem is that the brew is not clarifying well at all and there seems to be 
a cloudy suspension in it.  I used Yeastlab dried Whitbread Ale yeast and 
have read that that particular variety takes an exceptionally long time to 
settle due to very fine particulates.  Does the cloudy condition sound like 
bothersome yeast or pectin "set" or worse---contamination?  The taste is 
fairly interesting, but has a very slight sulfide odor---barely perceptible--
and could use some maturing time.  Using Yeastlab was an experiment on my 
part that at present I do not plan to repeat!  Please bear with a brewer 
that is realtively new to the art.  Reply by e-mail to:

I'm trying my hand at building a roller grain mill. I've worked
out most of the construction details but still have a few
questions.  Anyone have any experience with this?


1.  I'm going to have the rollers machined at a local shop. I can
get them straight or diamond knurled, any preference?  Also what
is the optimum diameter for the rollers?  I thought I would use 
1 1/2 inch x 8 inches long.


2.  I would like to motorize the mill.  What size motor, torque
rating, rpm, etc. would work best.  I seem to remember a post
saying you need at least a 1/4 HP motor, but don't think it
mentioned required torque or rpm. 


3.  How to set the roller spacing for the best grind.  Thought
I'd use a feeler guage to get the spacing.  Anyone seen a chart
that gives settings for different grains?  What about a rule of
thumb like "set the gap 1/2 the diameter of the grain". 


Any help is greatly appreciated.  Private e-mail fine.  I'll

Subject: Specialty Malts


I have recently started brewing all-grain batches and have begun to try to
figure out what different grains can do for the finished product.  My main
questions are about carapils, caramunich, caravienna, and crystal malts.  


        1.  Are caramunich and caravienna the same as munich and                 
                vienna malts? 


        2.  I have read in different places that munich and vienna                 
                malts are crystal malts and also that they need to be mashed.  
                It was my understanding that crystal malts do not need to be 
                mashed.  Is this correct?


        3.  Does dextrin malt need to be mashed?


        4.  I have read that crystal malts can break down at mash                 
                temperatures.  Is it a good idea to put them in just before 
                the mashout?


If people feel that a general discussion about malts is not very interesting,
e-mail is fine.  However, a discussion about how to use different grains and
understand their contribution to the wort may be helpful to other beginning
all-grainers.

Subject: Glatt Mills/Chelsea, Mich.


I bought a Glatt Malt Mill last November - the yellow enamelled model - and
it crushes malt just fine.  It would not have occurred to me to grind raw
wheat in it, but then again the product literature says nothing about how to
use it.  Basically, because there was no product literature.  If there is
such a thing as a Glatt data sheet, please let me know.


By the way, this was before I was aware of the JS MaltMill, or even HBD.


I wonder if the gears are supposed to break if the load is too great
(mechanical fuse principle).  A little plastic gismo in my Penn level-wind
fishing reel breaks periodically.  I deduce this is to prevent more
expensive damage to the rest of the mechanism.


Historical note:  Chelsea, Michigan was the home of one of the
ur-microbreweries, the Real Ale Co.  They made three flavors of bottle
conditioned ale.  To me they tasted like my extract brews of that time (1982
if I remember right), except without noticeable faults.  Their costs, and
the necessity of going through distributors and retailers to provide a
fragile, unusual-tasting brew, put them out of business.


In Ann Arbor I would go the the Red Hawk bar and grill.  As I recall they
have microbrewed beer from Frankenmuth and Detroit, as well as some
interesting imports.

Subject: Brew Kettles and metal plating


Mark and Bob (forgive the omission of last names, I'm doing this from 
memory) discuss burning on the bottom of your brew kettle (about HBD 
#1540).  I have a stainless brew kettle with no other metal plating on the 
bottom.  I have to be vigilant in keeping the brew moving to prevent a 
goodly portion of my wort from caramelizing or just burning right to the 
bottom.  I have come up with a cheesy semi-solution which requires slightly 
less vigilance on my part.  I wrap the bottom of my kettle in two layers of 
aluminum foil.  It's not pretty, it's not ideal, it's probably not even a 
good idea, but I don't have to stir for >1 hour, just every 5-10 minutes.


Now the question for all you chemistry/physics folks.  Can I, at home, 
plate the bottom of my brew kettle with copper or aluminum?  I remember 
doing essentially that in an undergrad chemistry course, but the object was 
to make a battery.  Can I use a battery connected up to my brew kettle, 
sitting on a few thumb tacks in a shallow bath of, say, CuSO4 (I'm 
attempting to write copper sulfate)?  How long would it take?  Am I 
talking about using way too much of the copper/aluminum salt to make it 
feasible?  Should I own up and go buy a *more* expensive brew kettle with 
my next student loan check, risking prosecution and auditing for a 
non-educational use of government subsidized funding?  TIA.

>[wondering about wrapping resistance-wire about SS keg for lauter-tun]


Are you going to be heating in the unit, or just maintaining
temperature?  This makes a staggering difference in the amount of heat
required.


We considered hot water heater elements.  These draw about 3400-4000
watts.  But after looking at the response time of a bruheat in a plastic
bucket with 5 gallons, and a 3750 watt element, we discarded the idea as
not enough heat.  But again, we wished to bring it to a boil this way.


For maintaining heat, though, it could be enough (given a thermostat or
regulator).


However, if you have the capacity to heat the water/grain before hand,
outside of the pot (gas stove or cooker), life is easier with a cooler
anyway, either a 48 or 72 quart chest (12 & 18 gallons) or 10 gallon
Gott cylinder.  Put it in at the desired temp, and it won't loose more
than a degree or two over an hour or two.

Subject: Is it possible to OVERpitch???


Dear Friends, last night at the club tasting, one of our most experienced
and knowledgeable members related his opinion that it is possible for
homebrewers to introduce off flavors (in particular, diacetyl and/or DMS?)
into their *ales* (not lagers, now) by pitching *too much* yeast.  My
knee-jerk reaction was "you can't pitch too much", having seen many many
posts here to the effect that one of the biggest hurdles for homebrewers
to overcome is pitching *enough* yeast.  My cohort cited as an example of
overpitching using the entire yeast slurry from a secondary to repitch
into a second batch (of the same size as the first).  I'd like to solicit
opinions on this.  Can ales be overpitched on a typical homebrewing scale? 
If so, what would you expect the problems to be?  As always, I'm up for
private email + summary, but this might be of general enough interest for
public commentary. 


Quick comment re: Herr Coyote's comment on addresses at the end: the way I
get around the usual email system characteristic of being able to go only
forward through the message (in this case, the HBD), is use the "reply"
option and when it asks "copy message?", answer yes.  Then the whole issue
is read in and you can use whatever editor you have to move up & down. 
When done, just exit and DON'T send the message!!

1 oz. Fuggles hops
1/2 oz. Willamette hops


Bring a gallon of cold water to a boil.  Remove from heat and add the can
