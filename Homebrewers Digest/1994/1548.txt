    Good Morning all you brewduds, hopheads and ale allies,
    In this months Celebrator, is an ad for a Fermentap[pat pending] in
    which an inverted carboy is placed on a stand with what appears a three

    siphoning, harvest yeast, and less oxidation/wasted beer. The idea is
    a great one, but here in Quake country of CA., it seems to me to add
    to the great debate on carboy disasters. the deal includes the stand and
    and valve assembly for $26.95, No disclaimer, just curious.
    
     On my primary fermentation, to avoid water being sucked into the wort 
    during the lag, I attach a Baggie [tm] to the carboy neck with a rubber
    band until there is good gas pressure and then replace with an airlock.

     This subject has come up several times in the HBD in the last few 
     years, and I have purposely avoided getting involved.  I realize that 
     people are going to ship beer by common carrier, with little regard to 
     what is legal and what is not.  There is a big temptation to just 
     mislabel the package, as Craig suggests, and let it go through the 
     system.  We handle in excess of 22 million packages/day, so 
     enforcement is next to impossible.  Contributors to the HBD have, for 
     the most part, frowned upon other blatant illegal subjects in the 
     past, such as home distillation, using marijuana in brewing, stealing 
     breweries kegs for tun conversions, etc..  However, from the posts I 
     have read over the past few years, the majority of people seem to 
     think that shipping beer is some sort of gray area; that it is 
     "technically illegal, but...". This attitude is similar to people who 
     make illegal copies of software.  They know it is illegal, but somehow 
     they justify doing it.  I suppose each of us must decide which laws we 
     choose to obey and which laws we choose to break.
     
     It is a federal regulation that we (United Parcel Service) cannot 
     accept any alcoholic beverages in our system.  This can be confirmed 
     by calling our main information number at (800) 346-0106.

Subject: Mash Volumes/Electric Sankey Keg Boilers


Hello All,


I have a question concerning mash volumes. Does anyone know how to figure out
how much space you are going to need in the mash tun based upon the amount of
grain. I am planning on expanding my 5 gallon RIMS system to a 15 gallon set
up and I want to know how big to make my mash tun. I am planning on using a
maxium of about 35 pounds of grain for sixteen gallons of finished, boiled
wort. 


Below is my reckoning on the matter. The reason that I am posting this is
that it will be a significant investment to custom make the mash-tun and I
want to be sure that  I got the right size. Any comments or suggestions?


Displacement of malt (35 lbs * .05) = 1.75 gal. This is from Noonan, Brewing
Lager Beer, page 174
1.3 quarts per pound mash-in water (35 lbs * 1.3 = 45.5 qts/4 qts/gal) = 11.4
gal
Total volume of mash tun needed = 13.15 gallons 


I have from time to time seen posts concerning brewers using electric hot
water heater elements in a SS pot. I would be extremly grateful if one of
these users could send me instructions on how they are made and how well they
work. I have a 20 gallon boiler that I would like to convert to an electric
boiler. The idea of not having to use a jet engine to boil my wort outside
and then move the hot boiler back inside sounds very nice. 


As long as I am here, I am more or less new on this mailing list and would
like to know how to get the FAQ list. I suscribe to AOL and I'm not sure how
to go about getting it.


Thanks in advance!

In HBD 1535, David Sapsis, dbsapsis`at`nature.Berkeley.EDU, wrote:


<DS> On another note, also relating to the use of wet hops as presented in
<DS> hop.faq, hops are *not* 80% water; that is, there is not 4 times the
<DS> mass of free water as that mass leftover after drying.  Consequently,
<DS> the suggestion of using 6 times as much mass of wet hops as dry ones
<DS> is way off base.  All hops are measured for moisture using a dry
<DS> weight basis, so 100% MC indicates that hops at this level of
<DS> moisture are one-half water.  Thus, assuming  all other things equal
<DS> between wet and dry cones, one would use twice as much fresh, wet
<DS> hops as an equivelent mass of dry ones.  I suspect that some of the
<DS> reports relating to harshness from use of wet hops may be due to
<DS> using about three times the equivelent measure, and then drawing
<DS> comparisons! 


To which, Jim Ancona, Jim_Ancona.DBS`at`dbsnotes.dbsoftware.com 
responded in HBD 1537:


<JA> I recently harvested half a grocery bag of home grown hops. They 
<JA> weighed 20 oz. fresh. After drying on a screen in my attic for two
<JA> days they weighed 4 oz. So in my case, they really were 80% water!


I waited a couple days to see if David would respond, but he didnUt. 
When hops are grown normally and picked at the right time they do indeed
average 80% water wt/wt. 5 pounds of freshly picked hops will dry down
to 1 pound of hops at 0% moisture content or about 1.09 lbs at 8% 
moisture. Sorry to be blunt but DavidUs comment above is just plain wrong.


His recommendation not to use 6 times more wet hops is well taken though.
Hop oils are decreased during drying (exposure to heat and oxygen).
Not only is myrcene content decreased, so is the content of other 
compounds which are perceived as more RhoppyS than myrcene. Wet hops have
a higher oil content (on a dry basis) than dried hops--certainly not 5
times higher--but using double the wet hops vs. dry hops is a good
starting point.


Other components are reported on a dry weight basis (*and* on an as is
basis). For example, the Willamettes I just had analyzed were 5.5% alpha acids
as is and 6.0% on a dry weight basis--they were about 8.7% moisture.
Because DavidUs post was--on the whole--very interesting and credible, I
thought that this glitch should be pointed out. 


Another thing to remember is that even sitting at room temp in your
house, hops dry quickly and what was 80% water decreases 
rapidly. So weigh your freshly picked hops immediately after harvest and
use that number to guide your drying. It might be worth drying the heck out 
of a small sample and then back calculating the water content after
weighing the dried sample. Try to dry hops until the strig is brittle
and breaks when you bend it. Then leave the hops out at room temp for an
hour or so to equilibrate and cool. Then package in barrier packaging and
freeze. Brew beer and send me some 8^)

Subject: The big leap to ALL-GRAIN


Hello everyone,


I have been successfully brewing extract-based beers for about six months 
now.  At the urging of *countless* homebrewing counterparts, who insist that 
all-grain simply makes for better beer, I have decided to make the big leap 
into all-grain brewing.  Being anal about preparation, I have been 
exhaustively reading about mashing in Papazian's TNCJOHB.  I have a few 
general questions and one perplexing problem with Papazian's numbers 
concerning amounts of water to add at certain times.  So, please prepare for 
a barrage of greenhorn questions:


1.  Although the monitored-brewpot method is the cheapest way to go for a 
mash-tun, I am concerned that adequate temp control cannot be achieved.  I am 
considering the "picnic cooler" approach.  I assume there is no consensus on 
the issue, so any helpful hints or experiences by e-mail would be appreciated.


2.  I would like to do temperature controlled three-stage mashing.  Charlie 
recommends 122, 150, and 158.  What are some other viable alternatives?  
What's the best way to achieve the temperature changes if using the picnic 
cooler method?---Papazian suggests adding specific amounts of boiling 
water....which leads me to my last point.  Charlie's numbers do not seem to 
add up:


First, he says that 0.5 quarts of 200 F water per pound of grain will 
raise the temperature by 18 F.  OK.  Then, he says "it would be safe to 
assume that.." the same amount of 212 F water would raise the temp by about 
25 F.  A simple proportion shows this not to be the case:


        200/18 = 212/x                x=19


Am I missing something here?  Then in all his recipes, the amount of water he 
suggests adding would not achieve the desired temperature change according to 
the information above.  Look at an example for 8 pounds of grain:  He says to 
combine the grains with 2 gallons of 130F water for a protein rest at 122 F.  
OK, no problem.  THEN, to raise the temperature to 150 F, he says to add 4 
quarts of 200 F water (recall 0.5 quarts/pound grain = 18 F increase).  I may 
be wrong, but 122 + 18 = 140, not 150.  Am I just a total bonehead or does 
something not add up here??  If Papazian is wrong, where can I get accurate 
information on this issue.  If he is right, please enlighten me.


I apologize for taking up HBD space with such seemingly trivial questions, 
but to an all-grain toddler with high trepidation these are issues of life 
and death.  ;)  TIA for your patience and any info.

Subject: A modified RIMS system




        As a new member of HBD I have been spending *a lot* of time digging
through the archives and the docs on various RIMS setups.
        I think I may have come up with a better (different at least) way to
raise the temperature of the mash.  My idea is this -- First make an 
immersion heating coil of copper tubing (just like an immersion cooler). 
And then use the controls, pump, and electric heating element/enclosure 
of an existing RIMS setup to recirculate heated *WATER* thru the 
immersion heating coil placed in the mash tun.
        If this works properly it would NOT:
                -- Scorch the wort
                -- Oxygenate the wort  
                -- Compact the grain bed
                -- Catch on fire, if the mash stuck and the heater went 
                        dry during unattended mashing.
        it WOULD:
                -- Give good control over mash temperatures.
                -- Be easy to adapt to existing mash tuns
                        including picnic coolers.


        Has anybody tried this? Will it work? What do you think?

Subject: Yeast head reference


Dear Good People,


    For what it's worth, I have found the reference that I paraphrased
    yesterday regarding the benefits of yeast head contact the air.


    From "Overview for Designing a Brewery" by Eric Warner, Blue River
    Consulting, as it appears in "Brewery Planner" compiled by The Institute
    for Brewing Studies, published by Brewers Publications, 1991:


        "Harvesting ale yeast or removing the post-kraeusen layer on
         the surface of the green beer is easily done with an open
         fermenter.  In open fermenters ale yeast comes in contact with
         the air above the fermenter, making the yeast more virile and
         increasing the number of times it can be pitched."


        "...Finally, taste tests have shown that beers from open
         fermentations are often preferred to the control beers from
         closed fermentations."


    Perhaps I will try "open" fermentation, i.e. leaving the airlock off of
    the carboy, on my next batch.  Although I do not repitch, I would be
    curious to see the effects (if any) it has on the kraeusen and overall
    flavor of the finished beer.

 top of that, covered with more cotton.  The remaining hole ... is 'out'."




This gave me an idea.


See, when filtering air, I think the basic question is :


        Is there any possible path by which particle A can enter
        closed system B by entry point C, exit by exit point D,
        and never, ever encounter airborne contaminant counter-
        measure(s) E ( F, G, H, etc ) ?


It's a tough question. And when you look at each of the components - water
with or without sanitizing agents ... cotton ... activated charcoal - it
still seems, to me, that there are possible paths for the contaminating
particles.


 - In the water, many airborne particles could be contained in a bubble,
  and never touch the liquid sides of the bubble during its entire passage,
  from bottom, to top, of liquid.


 - I'm unclear as to the efficacy of wadded, closely-packed natural fibers
  as a filter of airborne pathogens. On the other hand, maybe I'm just
  being over-cautious, here. But I'm not convinced there are no possible
  paths for pathogens through cotton.


 - The same issues pertain to closely-packed grains of activated charcoal.
  Aquarium charcoal has never struck me as being very fine ... it is coarse,
  and rather granular. It is far worse than cotton. And, in any case, the
  charcoal needs to be wet, to work ...


But, there's nothing to stop one from grinding the charcoal finer, and, of
course, the wetting agent could also contain hydrogen peroxide ... and it
would make sense to use some cotton, on top and on bottom ... and maybe a
airstone to generate finer bubbles, to address that first issue.


( Aquariums stores sell bubble tubing, which one could coil up in the bottom
  of one's filtering jar, so that when bubbles were emitted, they were evenly
  distributed across the entire filtering medium ... it's like an airstone,
  but elongated to several inches or feet, and flexible. It can be used to
  create a 'curtain' of very fine bubbles across the back of an aquarium. )


Also, I suspect wet cotton would expand and become somewhat more filtering.


One might wish to use foam pads in place of cotton ...




Anyhow, some thoughts which I trust will prove useful.


( By the way, does anyone know what the difference is between 'activated'
  and 'unactivated' charcoal, besides the price ? I mean, what we're talking
  about here is nothing more or less than a filter made out of wetted carbon
  particles ... gardening-grade charcoal works in my aquariums, just fine,
  and it don't cost $8.00 a box, neither. )-:

I don't remember who asked the original questions but the answers from

Crystal has no enzyme level.  It is fully modified (converted) in the 
husk and then kiln dried creating a little crystal of malt sugar.  It
does NOT need to be mashed.  However, some people include it in the
mash, others add it just before mashout or sparge, and still others
steep it in the sparge water.  The issue with mashing crystal is NOT 
conversion of starch to sugar (there is no starch left) it is ease
of process and possible breakdown of dextrins during the mash, and
hence loss of some of the crystal character and contribution.

>
> Willits/Flatter answer
>
>Yes, but it might only be a one-step infusion mash.  [Read as: put the

This of course is NOT a "one-step infusion mash".  It is a steep, a tea
if you will, and will NOT convert the dextrin malt.  Dextrin malt
(carapils) do NOT have the diastatic power to convert themselves and
they need to be mashed with something that does.

Again, crystal malts do NOT need to be mashed (see above).  We can only
hope that "convert the protein to sugars" is a brain fart.

     and taste. This is after it's all done & bottled. I assume there
     can't be chlorine in the batch, since the yeasties worked fine
     during ferment and in making a nice carbonation in the bottle.


Not true.  It takes much more chlorine to kill yeast than to kill 
bacteria.  You can brew with chlorinated tap water with no preboil
with no problem.  


     This was a full-mash pale ale, and the only peculiarity I can
     identify is that I let the mash-out at the end go too high
     (answering a phone call), and I actually got some (not
     much--localized I think) boiling during mash out.


Tannins (phenols) extraction from the grain husks perhaps.


        My wife says our soft city water has had more chlorine in it
     lately (her sniffer is much better than mine), but I called the
     city water dept and they said the only change recently is
     something they've been adding to the water to treat lead pipes


You believed the City Water Department over your own wife's nose?!
Shame on you.  Don't you know that government agencies at all levels
lie by knee-jerk reaction.  I believe your wife's nose.  They upped the
chlorine levels for the hot summer months.


You don't say whether you preboiled your mash and sparge water, but I
assume you did not.  My guess is that the first batch had a double
whammy with boiling extracting phenols (tannins) from the husks and
combined with the extra chlorine courtesy of the Water Department you
got a yield on the sythesis of chlorophenols that smell a lot like
band-aids (tm).


The second batch is more muted because you didn't boil the mash.


Seattle has VERY soft water too.  I turned up my water heater (it also
helps keep the basement library warm) very high (no children), and I
run 8-9 gallons of this VERY hot water into my brew kettle the night
before a brewing session and I let it sit UNCOVERED overnight to outgas
chlorine and oxygen.  Seems to work.  The alternative is a charcoal
filtration system.  Try running 9 gallons through a Brita water filter!


Good luck.

Subject: Carboy Handle Summary/ Corrections


I'm not going to name names,  cuz everyone knows who they are.
And if you don't know who you are, please report to your local
alzheimers treatment center and tell them you brew with aluminum   :)


Here's the unskinny bop on those orange handled carboy handles, use
for the 5 galwater jug carboys, and 6.5/7 gal acid bottles (how BIG are they?)


For those who don't know:  The handles are made of FAT wire in two pieces.
They are bent to wrap around the neck of the carboy, and the other is shaped
for a handle.  THey connect via a bolt and wing nut.  Orange plastic covers
the wires- for you brewing safety and comfort.


>From all I've heard it IS safe to use these for carrying full carboys.
BUT...that doesn't mean you can't have problems.  Watch for stress lines
(those little bags under your eyes from worrying too much  aka not enuf HB!)
around the neck.  DO NOT tighten the nut down real hard.  It shouldn't sqeeze
the bottle, but should hold it snug.  You can still manage to bang the carboy
or balance it precariously on a table ledge while racking...etc...etc.
But- it seems that they are commonly used for transport.


Thing is the neck-ring needs to sit at the point on the neck where the
curve of the bottle ends.  NOT below the threads of the acid bottle top!


MODIFICATION:  to make a handle fit a 7g acid bottle.


        1. The wire which wraps around the neck needs to be adjusted.
What I did (and it worked...so I'll patent it with ACME)  is to slightly
straighten the loopy part (neck wrap) and also the eye-hole for the bolts.
What this leads to is a nice snug fit around the bottle neck,  but...


        2.  The bolt needs to be lengthened by about a 1/2".  Since bolts
are cheap I opted to buy a new one which was already longer.  Stretching
bolts is a tiresome project. The original bolt is 2" and the minimum for
the new one is 2 1/2"  3" would work ok too.  I think it's 1/4" threads.


        3. Part of what this does it to all alot more slippage space for the
handle part to slide back and forth on the bolt,  so you can cut some small
pieces of tubing to slide on the bolt and serve as spacers to hold it snug
in place.  I found this also allows you (with a little fiddling/cutting)
to tighten the nut down snug w/o it squeezing on the bottle neck. I'd even
suggest adding some for use with a 5 gallons bottle.
I used some reinforced gas line tubing- since it's pretty firm and thick.
I ended up with three pieces.  One inside the two eyelets of the handle
(very small, 1/8 in?) and one on either side (about 1/4").


I still am going to make efforts to support the carboy from below while 
transporting downstairs.  But it seems pretty sturdy.   You need to try to 
match the curve of the bottle neck with the curve of the wire.
Nice-even support.  No pinpoint-stress points!  Do not tear up the plastic
in the process cuz you don't want metal on metal.


FWIW: the handles seem reasonable prices at $4.50, but it is only a couple
pieces of wire, and a bolt, and I had to replace the bolt (gee.  .10 more!).
But- hey, someones got a patent on them.  I'm surprised they haven't come
out with the 7g model yet- those bottles are pretty popular!

And  I've been requested to state that it was NOT in zymurgy, but in BT that
that article on the air bubble gadget appeared,  so zymurgy is not publishing
faulty info/products.  Well at least not in THAT article!  So now our resident
technical editors should be put to at ease! 


But really...I don't mean to slam zymurgy.  I've been quite entertained 
looking over my special issue for the last week.

have sugar moeities attached, but thats not where we obtain our brewing
sugars.  Starches are converted to sugars.  Some protiens are broken down
to amino acids (serve as nutrients) while others serve as body and head
retention agents.  I think I had a couple other problems with your 
conclusions, but I wasn't in the editor so I'll leave it to others.

Simply put.... no way.  I used to think this was a good idea until
I spoke with Alberta Rager about a competition I'm organizing.  The
entrants pay their entry fee (I assume there is one for these club
competitions) and expect prompt and accurate judging replys.  The

Munich and Vienna are both high kilned malts, with munich being the darker
of the two.  They are in many ways similar to pale malts.  The main
difference is that they are kilned at higher temperatures, as a result they
are lower in diastic power than most pale malts and should not be used to
convert non-malt adjuncts.


Caramunich and caravienna are both "crystal malts"  they are malted and
then raised to conversion temperature for a period of time before drying.


They will all add color to beer but using these four grains interchangeably
will certianly result in different beers.  At the very least the colors
will be different, and the flavor profiles are also likely to differ.

Crystal malt is efectively mashed in the husk before being dried.  That
means, while it lacks enzymes when it reaches the brewer, it already has
undergone conversion and so doesn't need to be mashed, just infused.


Munich and vienna are high-kiled malts.  They are like pale 2-row or pale
6-row except they have been dried at higher temperatures.  As a result they
are more carmelized and darker and they have lower enzyme levels, but they
still have enough enzymes to convert their own starch unless you are
reckless with your mash conditions.


Carapils (dextrin) has no appreciable diastic enzyme activity.  Some
sources suggest that it should be mashed with a enzyme rich malt but it is
essentially a crystal malt that has been kilned at low temperatures to
avoid browning.


>>     3.  Does dextrin malt need to be mashed?
>

I wouldn't call this a mash, I would call this an infusion, like making

As I said before, crystal malts lack active enzymes but they don't need
them because they have already been mashed before kilning.  ( I assume the
comment about converting protein to sugars was just a mental lapse, mashing
converts starch,a large sugar polymer, into simpler sugars).

 >From: Ed Hitchcock <ehitchcock`at`sparc.uccb.ns.ca>
 
 >  For roller mill spacing, George Fix wrote an article in the fall
 1994 issue of Zymurgy that covers spacing.
 
 George's article provided good technical background on crush analysis and the 
 effects of a "bad" crush but wisely left avoided dogmatic statements on 
 "ideal" spacing.  It is my experience on several thousand mills both fixed 
 and adjustable, that .045" provides an excellent crush on every malt out 
 there.  It mashes efficiently, flows well and runs clear.  It is a fairly 
 course crush but not so course to effect proper wetting in the mash tun. The 
 only direction one might want to go is to a finer crush but I have yet to 
 come up with a good reason to do so on homebrew sized batches.   I have never 
 been able to measure any improvement in extract by using a finer crush on 10 
 gallon batches.
 
 After all is said and done, most users weigh all the grains out into one 
 bucket and mill them together.  This, of course means that adjusting the mill 
 for different grains is waived in favor of simplicity.
 
 >  As for knurling, I'm sure Jack would be delighted to give you the history 
 as to why he switched from longitudinal to diamond knurling.
 
 The linear knurling was used because it was similar to the groves on the 
 surplus rollers I used for the first 40 mills.  When we designed our own 
 roller, it seemed prudent to stick with what worked.  We can thank Dan 
 Listerman for the new and far more efficient knurl on the current MALTMILL.
 The first thing I noted on the Philmill I bought for evaluation was the use 
 of a diamond knurl and pondered whether this could be the cure to the 
 occasional feeding problem reported by customers.  The problem only occurred 
 on fixed mills because the adjustable could always be adjusted to find a 
 setting that would feed properly.
 
 I made up a few prototypes but opted for a much coarser knurl than the 
 Philmil uses and never looked back.  The rollers feed efficiently at much 
 closer spacing and without the need for gears or any active drive to the 
 passive roller.   I suspect that the Philmil could be improved by a coarser 
 knurl but I am sure he has the same "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" 
 attitude.  I am not sure why Glatt has gone back and forth between the two 
 but having rollers even smaller in diameter (1.25") is a self-inflicted wound 
 that makes feeding far more difficult in the first place and is no doubt one 
 of the reasons for the mandatory but infamout plastic gears.
 
 >  He will also expalain why it is cheaper to buy one of his, and if you're 
 in the states I think he's right.
 
 Well, the fact is I still can't compete with someone who has a machine shop 
 in the basement and considers it a labor of love.  One can build a mill for 
 $10 if really pressed but selling it at a profit is a different ball game.
 
 >From: npyle`at`hp7013.ecae.StorTek.COM
 
 >Are you saying your options are a "straight knurl" or a "diamond knurl"?  I
 know what diamond knurling is, but I don't understand straight knurling.
 
 That is sort of a generic term for rolling a pattern on cylinders.  This can 
 be anything from screw threads to straight lines and diamond patterns.  It 
 takes massive amounts of pressure and most people run out of gas because they 
 can not do a proper job, on a large roller, in even a large industrial lathe.  
 We send our rollers to a company that does nothing else but roll. 
 Unfortunately, getting them there and back again adds to the cost but that is 
 the price of quality.

Homebrew Competition is also part of the Midwest Homebrewer of the Year 
challenge.

10 December, with a banquet and award ceremony following.


We welcome all entries, and urge everyone interested to come judge with
us! Please pass this information along to other brewers who may be
interested. If you will be visiting us, let me know. We will
have some places to stay available.
