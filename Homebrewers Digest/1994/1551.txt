Subject: Allentown/Philadelphia Homebrewer Needed!
Message of the day:  Yow!


To anyone living in the Allentown, Pennsylvania area:  a year ago I
brewed a fine batch of mead which has been fermenting quietly in my
parent's basement.  Now I have a non-brewing friend from Philadelphia
flying out to Portland for a visit and he wants to bring the mead
along for our mutual enjoyment.


So, we need somebody with bottles and bottling equipment.  Dan (my
friend) and my parents are totally homebrewing illiterate, tho
homebrewing friendly.  We need your equipment and your cooperation to
get the job done.  What's in it for you?  A share of the spoils, of
course.  When does it have to be done?  By this weekend.  Tough call,
I know.  Is it worth it?  Well, here's the ingredients:


7 pounds light clover honey direct from the beekeeper
4 lbs lehigh valley peaches at the peak of ripeness
lots of grated ginger
a touch of yeast nutrient
champagne yeast


Is it going to be any good?  I'm 3,000 miles away and haven't seen it
for year so it is hard for me to say.  Going into the fermenter it was
the best tasting honey-fruit drink I've ever had so my expectations
are high.  If you are up to the challenge, email me at:

What am I missing?. I hear all this about the trouble with liquid yeast,

I use the 1 pouch YEAST Lab brand of liquid yeast. I pop the inner bag
about 1-2 days before pitching, it gets pregnant, I sanitize the bag 
surface, and pitch. No mess, no starter, no problem, great beer.
Am I missing something, or is you're subject matter beyond the scope of

 My apologies for the untimely posts in HBD1550.


John Keane posted about his wort chiller in the same issue.


One comment I would like to make about sanitation with the immersion type
chillers:  It;s a no brainer.  You just put the chiller in the wort for the
last 10 minutes of the boil and it's sterilized.  I know alot of you already
know this but there have been several comments/concerns.


I personaly use a counterflow, but what works for me might not work for you.


Gregg Carrier posted his concerns about his low-gravity results:


 > turned out with a low specific gravity.  It was about .015 low.  We wrote
it
 > off as improperly crushed grains (did them by hand) and brought the
gravity


Gregg, I had the same problems as did most if not all of the granola heads
(all-grainers) here.  


The Zap-pap system, while ok for partial mashes, has it's limitations as a
lauter tun.  The increased deadspace unter the first bucket, lack of
insulation and size all contribute to low yield mashes.


The best thing to do if you enjoy the all grain thing is to either invest in
an insulated tun (cooler) or insulate yours but then you have to find some
way to get the space below the mash reduced.  


Keeping the temp up (around 168), s-l-o-w sparging, and a more efficient
system raised my extract up from .022 points/lb to .032 points/lb in one try!


Before that, I just recognized my weakness and added extra grain. :)


Guess that about does it for this post, I'm using AOL for a while untill the
U's problems are cleared up.

Hello...is there anyone left out there who is actually still interested in 
what Jim-Bob Seersucker thinks about the internal policies and management 
decisions at UPS?!  I mean the HBD has become a forum for any "puke" to

not in the eyes of the wolves lurking the Internet), or spew there opinions

Subject: Edme DMS malt extract question


I'm planning to try a Papazian partial-mash recipe (Uckleduckfay
Oatmeal Stout) that calls for Edme DMS extract.  When I went to
purchase a can in the local homebrew store, I noticed that the top and
bottom of all four cans on the shelf were bulging slightly outward, as
though the contents were under pressure.  The cans were all before
their marked expiration date.


Now internal pressure in a canned product makes me a bit nervous.
Does anyone know if this is normal for Edme DMS?  Is it just a
packaging fluke, or is there a legitimate reason that the contents are
under pressure?  Am I just being excessively cautious, or does it
sound like these cans might have been spoiled?

I just thought I'd echo the post about using a tube
with holes near the end to aerate wort.


I simply drilled 4 small holes in the plastic tube about
4 inches from the end. As the wort flows from my
boiler to the fermenter it creates a suction at each
hole pulling lots of air into the stream and creating
lots of foam.


Used this method fer years, no contamination, no
HSA (the wort is already cool), just lots of aeration
and quick fermentation starts.

Hello All,


I was wondering if anyone out there has tried an EasyMasher by  Jack
Schmidling Productions. James Spence in the Summer 1994 issue of Zymurgy
seemed to give it a pretty favorable review. I was wondering what the opinion
of other brewers was. Are the comments made in the review accurate?

of grain >was visible. I was truly amazed at this efficiency.


>The straining system is so efficient it is unnecessary to be overly
concerned about >a properly set grain bed, channeling of the grain or a set
mash.


Does the EasyMasher work well enough to minimize if not eliminate the need to
recirculate the wort? What size mash-tuns do you use with it? What are the
impressions of users out there in homebrew land? Please e-mail privately, I
don't want to start a bunch of hoopla over acertain product, I am just
curious and thinking about buying one.

Subject: Did I goof?




Greetings to all on the HBD.  I'm a new brewer who has been reading the HBD
for about 2 months.  I have a question about my latest batch (my second).
Please forgive in advance if I seem a bit naive, but I'm just trying to learn 
all I can about this great hobby.  My wife and I brewed a Holiday Ale last
weekend (Wheat based, with cinnamon, orange peels, pumpkin - looks and smells
great).  We pitched with dry Edme yeast and got a lot of krausen development
within 24 hours.  I guess we filled the carboy a little too full initially, and
did not leave enough room for foam and other blowoff, because the day after we
pitched, the rubber stopper was blown clear acroos the room by the built up
pressure.  Luckily, I was home when it happened and was able to minimize (I 
think) the damage.  I poured about one to two cups of liquid off the top to 
allow more room for foam.  My problem is this:  Almost immediately after I did
that, very little additional foam was produced.  I'm concerned that when I 
dumped the beer off the top of the carboy, I dumped most of the still active
yeast along with it.  Can this happen?  I had thought that the yeast would be
mixed throughout the brew in the carboy, but it looks like that may not be the
case.  Any ideas?  Should I re-pitch more yeast?  Leave it alone, relax, not
worry, etc.?  


Any information/guidance/advice would be helpful.  Private email is fine.


TIA,

I agree that good note-taking is key, but I disagree heartily that "there are
so many sources of variability in determining actual hop utilization rates
that comparisons of *estimated* IBUs to be meaningless".  Information is
valuable; if you know how to use it, it is not meaningless.  Do you think you
could replicate a beer better knowing:


A) Used: Cascades and Willamettes, OR
B) Used: Cascades to bitter and flavor at 30 IBU (est.) and Willamettes at
         knock out.


I think I would choose B, because there is more information.  I'd take the 30
IBU as a reference point, taste the beer, and go from there.  There is value
in the estimation, especially if you know that Rager's formulae were used,
for example.  Knowing that, and knowing how well Rager's formulae do in my
brewery, I can do pretty well.  I'm not claiming the 30 IBU is correct, nor
that I can hit 30 IBU (actual) but it would get me in the ballpark.  Maybe
only 2 iterations are required rather than 3 or 4.  MHO.

That's funny, most people worry about cleaning a chiller that has the wort go
through the INside.  At least with an immersion chiller you can see the
outside.  It goes into the hot wort, sanitizing it pretty quickly.  That
said, I use a CF chiller so the wort doesn't "see" the grungy air of my
garage.  I sanitize and cap my fermenter in the kitchen (much cleaner, yes!)
and when the wort fills it, the positive pressure pushes that air out.  The
CF chiller also allows me to use a hop back when I so desire.  I use
iodophor, boiling water, and an occasional vinegar rinse to clean out my
chiller.


This gives me a chance to followup on something I discussed long ago, the
length of my CF chiller.  I recently shortened it to about 20' (from 30') and
as I suspected, it still works great.  This is with cold Colorado water,
granted, but it allows me to drain 5 gallons of wort in about 15 minutes.
Before, it took about 30 minutes with the valve wide open because of the all
the back pressure of 30' of 3/8" Cu tubing.  Now, I have more control.  I can
adjust the flow of wort as well as water to get the results I like.


Another followup from long ago:  I claimed that dumping your hot "waste"
water on the lawn wouldn't hurt a thing, saying that I've seen people dump
boiling water on weeds with little effect.  A couple of people took me to
task over this claim, so I went and proved it to myself.  I took a gallon or
so of near boiling water and dumped it on some weeds.  A week later:  yup, I
wuz wrong:  they were dead.  The original discussion had to do with using the
cooling water, which isn't usually too outrageously hot, but I'd say practice
on your weeds before using this water on your prized begonias.

Perhaps a 3rd reason is to improve clarity(which may be a result of #1). I
find that I have less chill haze problems with my beers which have been
racked to a secondary. It might reflect the fact too that by racking to
secondary I essentially bottle at least a week later than I would otherwise.

If this is important to you, then by all means volunteer to help the AHA
smooth out the beer shipping process.   The AHA is in the business of
running the National Competition, sanctioning homebrew competitions and
organizing the National Conference.  Zymurgy is in the business of printing

a couple of other branches like Brewer's Publications and the Institute of

I'll bet that back when Miller was writing his book, there were only
pretty crappy crystal malts available to the homebrewer and maybe that
is why he felt there was enough unconverted starch in crystal to bother
mashing it.  I believe that in quality crystal malts (look for a recognized
maltster, not Acme Seed Company) the unconverted starch is minimal.  So much
so that you can ignore it.  If there is some unconverted starch, then it's
all the more important to not raise the temperature too high so you don't
burst those starch granules.  Keep the temp of the steeping below 170F.

RIMS stands for Recirculating Infusion Mash System.  An infusion is a
steeping in hot water to extract water soluble compounds (dictionary
definition).


A RIMS system consists of a mash tun with a false bottom (or you could
use an EasyMasher), a pump, an electric water heater element in a
heater chamber, a temperature controller for the heater element and a
return wort manifold.


The grains and water are put in the mash tun.  The pump sucks liquid
out of the grain bed through the false bottom, pumps it past the
heater which adds heat, and the return manifold returns the liquied
back to the top of the grainbed, under the level of the liquid to
prevent hot side aeration.


The recirculation of the wort uses the grain bed as a natural filter
and produces crystal clear wort about 20 minutes into the mashing
process.


An EasyMasher (TM) is bulkhead fitting and valve with a screen
attached.  It is used like a false bottom to allow a liquid to be
drawn off the bottom of a grain bed while leaving all the grain
behind.

Subject: step mash with steam


In HBD 1550 (now there's a milestone for those of us with 10 fingers),
"Marshall.Jay" <marshall#d#jay`at`ssdgwy.mdc.com> asks about the BT article
that describes steam injection for mash heating. Having read that article
and thought about how I would do it, I'm prepared to take the heat by
answering his query.


Essentially, one must vent steam under pressure into the mash. The rest is
detail. I have a pressure cooker that has a stem on top. This is usually
where the small weight for increasing the pressure goes. For steam
injection, a hose of some sort must be clamped onto this stem. This would
channel steam through the tube to wherever you want it to exit.
Problems follow. What kind of tubing to use? Most types of tubing would
allow condensation inside of it, leading to 1) loss of heat, and 2)
burned fingers. Metal comes to mind, but seems as if that would be too
inflexible, while plastic might leach out chemical smells and taste.
There would need to be some sort of handle, so that fingers and
heat do not come into contact. The figure in the article implies that
copper tubing is used, and is not moved around during the heating
process, which kind of settles the two points I raised above. But who
could avoid wanting to use the steam output as a stirring spoon?
People with very callused hands...


I found replacement parts for my pressure cooker at a local
hardware store. A new seal for the lid and a new weight for the stem.
Considering that I bought the cooker at a local thrift store, the
replacement parts cost more than the cooker body. I find the cooker
to be very handy for pressure heating wort samples for later yeast
cultivation. However, petri dishes will melt. This is the voice
of experience talking. I had the dish in a baggie, with a rubber
band around it to keep the lid on the base, and the durn thing
just collapsed onto itself. It looked like a monkey's fist. That
can go into my list of equipment distroyed since last posting...

Subject: Gran's Cider and the Law, mostly grain brewing.


Dick Dunn and Bob Paolino talked a bit about the legal wranglings over
Grant's cider.  I thought I would throw in a little information.


The owner of the homebrew shop I frequent had heard credible rumors that
the Feds had offered Grant a few settlements over the back taxes on the
Cider.
According to the rumors, the size of the settlement was "reasonable" and he
was curious as to why Bert Grant was holding out.


Well, he was in one of Seattle's alehouses recently and saw that Bert Grant
was there so he decided to get the story from the horses mouth.


Grant said something to the effect of "I am an old man and by the time the
case makes it through court I will be dead, I don't care what happens
then!"




On to other subjects.  I would like to encourage people who are thinking of
making the step to patial mashes or all grain.  For my last few batches I
have done small partial mashes.  It didn't really save me much money on
extract but it helped me get a feel for conducting a mash while giving me
some room for error.


For this last batch I decided to go all out.  I was brewing an IPA and I
decided to go for it and planned to get more than half of my fermentables
from grain.  I spent less than $10 dollars and built a lauter tun out of a
5 gal. plasitc pail, a slotted copper pipe manifold and a spigot.  I
scrounged the bucket from a teryaki joint, the most expensive part was the
spigot (overpriced).


I mashed 7 lbs of grain in my brew kettle and kept it warm in the oven
during the conversion stage.  I only sparged until I collected about 4.5
gal. but I still got about 30 pts. per pound of grain.  My pot wasn't big
enough to boil all five gal without a boilover so I kept the overflow
simmering in a smaller pot and added it to the main kettle as wort boiled
away.  It took about an hour to get it all into the main kettle.


All in all, it worked great.  I saved at least $7 by using grain in place
of most of the extract.  I figure that I can brew a lighter beer
(1.045-1.050) using only grain with this method and save $10 on my next
batch.  I will use a few more pounds of malt and undersparge as before.  I
may not use the grain as efficiently as I could but it is still cheaper
than using extract.  It made my brewing day about 3 hours longer but it
only took about 1.5 hours extra attention, and it was fun.

I would say that the velocity of the beer through the tube caused a local
drop in pressure which caused the CO2 to come out of solution.  FWIW, I
did the primary in a plastic bucket with spigot.

Better yet is to use a script to convert the HBD to a mail folder format.

No, nobody sleepy in Boulder on this one -- sleepy in Palos Hills... me!


I must take reponsibility on this one.  It was up to me to check that all
the batch sizes/extraction values were correct and I dropped the ball.
This morning, I randomly checked the %efficiency of a handful of the 76
recipes and most were in the normal 80-90% range, however, one was way low
and one way high.  I suspect the batch sizes were incorrect or possibly,
in the case of the Oats article, that the low extraction was due to the
home-malted grain that Michael uses.  If indeed this is the case, I should
have checked this with the author and it should have been noted in the
article.


You can be sure that I will do my best to not miss checking extraction and
bittering validity on any Zymurgy recipe in the future.

Subject: re: hops for (p)lambics


In HBD 1550, Robert (Rmarsh747`at`aol.com) asks:


> I am thinking about making a lambic beer. Does anyone know of a source for

I have gotten into the habit now of buying the old hops from our local shop, 
and putting them in paper bags to age. You don't want to wait two years to 
brew a beer that will be another two years before you drink it, so.....
what some plambic brewers (myself included) have done is to bake their hops.


Yes, bake. As in spreading them out on cookie sheets and baking at a low temp
(225-275F) for an hour or so. Big caveat here: clear spouses, pets, roommates,
children, etc. out of the house before you do this. Even with old stale hops,
the ensuing aroma is nothing less than overpowering. Use serious ventilation. 
I'm not kidding. I baked half a pound of year-old Tettnang, which I thought
was pretty lifeless at the time, only to discover that there was a LOT of
aromatics left. I can only guess how rowdy fresh hops would be. I personally
love the smell of hops (hey, who here doesn't?), but it was almost too much
for me. Be sure to turn them from time to time so you do not burn any.


When done, just spread them out on newspapers and let cool. That should get
you going for your first batch. In the meantime, when you get the chance, 
buy some old hops from your local supplier and just put them in paper grocery
bags to dry out. In the summertime, you can put the grocery bags in the back
seat of your car for a wicked air-freshener. 


Cheers,


Mitch

>From the responses I have received on my post on shipping alcohol, I need to 
clear up a few things.  First, most people thought I was taking a 
holier-than-thou attitude about breaking the law.  I did not intend to do this, 
and if I came off this way, I apologize.  I honestly don't care who does what, 
as long as it does not affect me.  Secondly, I stated that we (United Parcel 
Service) were federally regulated by the DOT, which is true.  However, after 
talking with some of our contacts at the DOT, they evidently let this issue be 
dealt with on the state level.  Again, I apologize for this misinformation.  I 
talked with the BATF and the Controller's office of Alcohol and Tobacco.  I 
asked them specifically about the various "beer or wine of the month club" 
shippers, some of whom use UPS.  They told me that they were very aware of these
companies, and if they shipped to a state that required an Alcohol 
Transportation Permit (which UPS does not have), they were shipping illegally.  
They are currently looking into this for two reasons -- first they don't get tax
revenues on it; second, they aren't sure the person receiving the shipment is of
age.  The states that allow INTERstate shipments of alcohol are California, 
Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Missouri, New Mexico, Oregon and Wisconsin.  For the 
person who posted they shipped inside the state of California, that also would 
be an illegal shipment.


Researching this topic within UPS has been a real education.  We clearly do not 
speak with one voice on this issue, which frustrates me just as much, if not 
more, than it does anyone else.  The one consistent answer that I got was that 
we should not accept any alcoholic beverages.  I realize that this is not 
followed consistently in different locations.  If a driver knowingly accepts a 
shipment containing alcohol, he does not realize our limitations.  I still 
disagree with mislabeling a package to get around this issue, as was suggested 
earlier in the HBD.  (This was the issue I was originally trying to address.)


>Actually, according to the BATF (as I stated in a previous post that probably

When I spoke to the BATF about this, they said the law on home brewing 
specifically stated that it is legal for private consumption only, and should 
never be shipped out of the person's residence in the first place.  He had never
heard of a homebrew competition, and was not sure of their stance on it.  Does 
anyone know how far the specific language "private consumption only" goes?
