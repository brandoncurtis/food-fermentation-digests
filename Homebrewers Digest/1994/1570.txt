Subject: Flavoring Beer


I am relatively new to the art of home brewing, and want to brew a flavored
batch of fruit.  I know of all methods od doing this during boiling, but
had an idea I wanted to follow up on.  Is it possible to get a sufficient
amount of flavor by priming a batch with az pure fruit extract or concentrate?
If so how much should I add?  I was particularly thinking of adding 3-4
cups of pure cherry extract to my stout.  I thoght the flavor obtained
from this method might be more perky as it is added right before bottling.
Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated!


Bottoms up,

I too have wondered about dried apricots in brewing. I have not tried this 
method, but have a feeling it may work. Any constructive comments are welcomed.
I assume Pierre already has dried apricots containing sodium metabisulphite 
(SM).


First step.
Primary ferment your beer (sans apricots) as usual. Rack to secondary as usual. 
Remove a healthy portion of primary yeast cake (wash as per yeast faq if you 
want) and store in fridge.


Second Step.
Steep apricots in warm water (150F??)  to remove some SM from them. The trouble 
is you want to retain flavour whilst removing SM. As SM is readily soluble, a 
short soak (15-20 mins?) should help leach out the SM whilst keeping flavour. 
You could always soak and keep tasting the apricots until they start tasting 
like ... um... not like dried, soggy, apricots! I know some advocate treating 
fruit with SM rather than steeping in hot water, for beer making. Small 
quantities in beer are not a problem as the SO2 generated is blown off (aside: 
SO2 is a very pungent gas, generated from SM in acidic environments, like 
fermented beer.) SM is used in winemaking to stop fermentation. So presumably, 
large quantities will kill the yeast off and stop fermentation which is not 
desirable.
So if you add the cooled fruit (pour off the liquid of course) to the secondary 
after fermentation has slowed, either the yeast will tolerate it or not. If it 
does, (shown by renewed activity in the airlock), then there are no problems. 
Just wait for a couple of weeks more (to ensure all SO2 is gone), then keg or 
bottle as usual. If not, then you get sneaky.


Third Step (if you have to get sneaky).
If there is no unusual airlock activity one week after adding apricots, remove 
saved yeast from fridge (make up starter if you think it is necessary - I 
don't), and add to beer. By this stage the SO2 *should* have blown off, making 
the beer a friendly place for yeasties again. If there are any fermentables 
left, fermentation should pick up once more. Proceed as usual.
All of the above is pure conjecture, I might add.

Subject: NJ homebrew supply controversy


It seems like that HBD has been full of controversy lately and I guess
there is just going to have to be a bit more.


I am going to say  that I am not particularly fond of long posts about
geographically constrained subjects.  I don't expect every post to the HBD
to be of interest to a majority of the readers.  That said,  I think it is
pretty obvious that info on local homebrew shops is going to be of rather
limited interest.  Maybe only a few people are interested in the qualities
of peat smoked malts but there is a good chance interested parties are
spread across the country, if not the globe.  On the other hand, the people
who are interested in the NJ homebrew retail scene are likely to be limited
to the NJ area.  Same goes for TX, CA or the PNW.  Post a short pointer to
e-mail, gopher, ftp or something.


If there really are alot of people who are interested in the local/regional
homebrew scene then maybe it makes sense to set up a regional mailing list.
If you want to do this I think it is OK to post a short notice asking for
help, then take the discussion to private e-mail until you are ready to
make the annoncement that the list is on-line.  People living outside your
geographical region can sign up if they are interested, but please, leave
the rest of us blissfully ignorant of who has the best selection of bottle
caps in the tri-cities area.


As for the ubiquitous brew-pub requests, I have mixed feelings, but I think
they have more of a place.  I don't travel much myself (unfortunatly), but
I can see that brew-pub info might be of broad interest because people are
interested in a good place to eat and drink when they travel.  I think they
are considerably less interested in places to buy 50 lbs of grain, a pack
of liquid yeast and a few gross of bottles (yes, I am sure some of you
are).


That said,  I would like to once again encourage people on the edge to make
the plunge into all-grain or large partial mashes.  After brewing a 1.060
IPA from grains and 4 lb of extract I moved up to an all grain porter.  The
IPA turned out great and the porter went pretty well.  I think my
formulation may have been a bit funny but the mash worked great.  I hit my
target OG within 2 points.  I have a smallish pot so I am doing
concentrated boils and I only collect 4.5-5 gal of runnings but it is a
hell of alot cheaper than brewing from extract and I only spent another $10
to make a lauter tun out of a 5 gal bucket, a spigot, a few feet of copper
tubing and some reflective plastic bubble-wrap for insulation.

     To be simplistic, the process of malting is allowing the grains
of barley to germinate. A grain is actually a seed and, in nature,
when this seed falls to the ground, if the conditions are right, the
seed will germinate and begin its journey to becoming a plant in its
own right. During the germination process, the grain goes through
internal changes and produces the starch (complex sugars) that we, as
brewers, use to produce our fermentable solutions. Malting grain is
simply the process of providing the right conditions (temp. and moisture)
to allow it to germinate and then halting the process by drying the
grain. As a secondary process, the grain, as well as being dried, can
also be kilned at higher temperatures in order to produce the various
speciality malts (crystal, chocolate, black etc.). It is possible to
malt your own grain but whether it is worth the effort is for each
individual to decide. The only source of information about malting at
home that I have seen is "The Historical Companion to House Brewing"
by Clive La Pensee (I think) but there are, no doubt, many others.
 
Cheers,
     Brian

Subject: Wort Cooler


I am curious if an "Immersion" type wort cooler would be better than one where 
the brew runs through the copper.  The reason that im asking this is because 
im going to be making it myself.  I personaly thought that making it an 
immersion type would be better since im washing the OUTSIDE of the tubeing 
instead of the inside.  I thought it would be more sanitary since its hard to 
get a bottle brush inside 1/4 inch copper tubing :-).  Ok, so here is my plan, 
basicly running cold water though the immersion setup, while it rests in the 
beer.  I figured this would give the same effect.   


If anyone has pro's / con's of doing this, id like to hear them.

Subject: Liberty Ale Success Story


Good news from the home front, my Liberty Ale came out great!  Three weeks
ago I began an attempt at Anchor Liberty Ale (one of my all-time faves),
which was also my first foray into the partial-mash world.  It was extremely
hard work, having never mashed before, and I was getting a little worried
(apologies to Charlie) that it wouldn't come out.  I got the base recipe
off of the Cat's Meow, then consulted with some local homebrew club regulars
to come up with some grain additions.  The recipe that I used is as follows:


(5 gallons)
8 lbs Munton and Fisons light malt extract
1/2 lb 40L Crystal Malt
1/2 lb Munich Malt
1/2 lb Cara Pils Malt
1.5 oz Fuggles Hops (bittering)
3.5 oz Cascade Hops (flavor, aroma, dry-hop etc)
Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast culture


Mash the Crystal, Munich and Cara Pils malts in a couple of quarts of 150
degree (all degrees in Farenheit, sorry non-US) water for about 30 minutes.  
Raise the temperature to 158 degrees, and hold it for 15 minutes.  Raise 
the temperature to 168 degrees briefly, then sparge with another quart or two 
of 170 degree water.  Add a gallon of water to mash, then boil it with the
malt extract for 60 minutes.  At the beginning of the boil add 1.5 oz Fuggles
Hops.  At 30 minutes add 1 oz Cascades.  At 10 minutes add 1/2 oz Cascades.
At the end of the boil, turn off the burner and add 1/2 oz of Cascades.
Let this steep for 5-10 minutes.  Cool and strain (if you aren't using 
hop bags) into fermenter.  Pitch yeast and top off with cold water.  Rack
it in 1 week, and add 1.5 oz Cascades to the secondary fermenter.  Wait
one more week and bottle with 3/4 cups corn sugar.  Wait one more week
and serve very cold.  


Notes:  Medium color, about like Anchor Liberty, but not as "orange".  More
of a light red color, reminiscent of Bass Ale.  Serious hop nose!  The 
cascade smell jumps right out of the glass.  Good initial bitterness, Cascade
is very assertive on the pallate, and finishes with light orange notes
and a hint of spice.  Pleasant aftertaste, and no off flavors.  Excellent
mouth-feel, plenty of body.  No alcohol hotness at all, though the feeling
in my head tells me it's all there!  If I make this one again, and I think I 
probably will, I might use less Cascades for dry hopping.  I used nothing but 
hop pellets,  but I think next time I'll try using plugs, at least in the 
secondary.  I thought I was going to have a problem with particles in the beer 
from the hop pellets in the secondary, but they eventually sank to the bottom, 
and I just siphoned above them.  The beer is perfectly clear.  I would 
suggest this recipe for anyone trying to emulate Anchor Liberty Ale.  


Cheers!

2).  Label soaking:  On a friends advice I tried tri-sodium phosphate
(TSP) to soak bottles in an attempt to remove labels.  Only the cleanser
I purchased was TSP-F phosphate-free.  After a two day soak I removed
the labels, rinsed, and dried.  Left behind was a layer of white film
inside and outside the bottle.  Rinsing and rubbing would remove the
layer, but trace amounts left on the inside worried me.  Even a cycle
in the dishwasher with Cascade wouldn't remove it.  All 48 bottles
are now at the bottom of a recycling bin.  Future users beware; I think
I'll stick to pure water.


3).  I recently subscribed to the cider digest, and found that when
added to the mailing list, you receive an informative package of where
to go to read about the basics, a summary of the basic process, a 
sample recipe, etc.  All of which I think would be appropriate
for people joining the HBD.  I realize not all new subscribers are
beginning brewers, but something like this may prevent future
Malt Pres. flame wars.  Any comments?

There's a good article on this subject in the Zymurgy All Grain special

Amidst the flame wars, the valiant homebrewer steps onto the information
superhighway.  There, with trepidation, he makes a stop at the once-
friendly planet Homebrew Digest to ask a question...
        Seriously, folks, leave your egos at the door and let's get
back to brewing better beer.  With that said, I  have several
questions regarding all-grain brewing.  I have made about six all-grain
batches with a minimal expenditure of equipment, but I now am thinking
about a slight upgrade.  I have on my Christmas wish list a Gott cooler
that I would like to use as a mash/lauter tun.  I have read lots about
this setup, but I have a few questions (a few things have escaped my
understanding). First of all, I've read about either a PVC or a copper
manifold.  Do these devices lay by themselves in the bottom of the cooler,
or do you still need a screen above them?  Doesn't some manufacturer make
a dome-shaped plastic screen that is placed in the bottom of the cooler
but above the spigot?  I have lots of brewing catalogues, but I can't seem
to find this piece of equipment.  If anybody could steer me in the right 
direction, I'd surely appreciate it.  
        I have a Zapap setup that I'm currently using.  Dave Miller
says to gently recirculate the cloudy first-runnings to clear them up.
How long does this *really* take?  I usually lose patience after about
10 or so minutes (several quarts), and just sparge without any further
recirculation.  After cooling the boiled wort, I usually just stay

I agree in the body comment, but the lauter can be successful with the

The point I would like to reiterate on making Wits is to employ multiple
protein rests, begin around 118-122F, and rest for 15 min.  Up to 
126F and rest 15 min, then up to 129-132F and rest for 15 min.  By 
using the staged rests the lauter will work fine.  A single rest may 
not be adequate to handle the raw wheat.  You should also use a very
thin mash, double the dough in water per pound of grains.

The question was how low can you go in fermentables and still have an
okay beer From my experience with very low gravity beers, pretty low.
The key may be the _non_ fermentables you use.


Partly as an experiment and partly for a holiday party at work, I
decided to brew "Swill Light." There _are_ people at work who appreciate
homebrew and eagerly snap up some of the extra bottles. But there are
others who are swillers.


Ingredients: One 3.3 pound bag of NW extract (cost:$5), a pound of DeWC
carapils (cost:$.95), an ounce of hop pellets (EKG, I think, for
bittering and Saaz for finish; cost:$.85), and a pack of Edme ale yeast
(cost:$.70). (costs of water, electricity, labour, et cetera not
included in estimate)


O.G. was 1.024, far less than AHA guidelines for American lager, and too
much colour, hop, and flavour for a Diet/Light. T.G. was, if I remember
correctly, 1.008) I tried to rush things a bit and bottled too soon, and
it had noticeable amounts of diacetyl (very noticeable in such a light
brew) and it didn't go over too big at the party--most people wanted the
real stuff. (My labels probably didn't help, either. I called it Swill
Light and called it
the-beer-for-people-who-don't-really-like-beer-but-like-to-be-seen-with-one-in-
their-hands.


Despite the diacetyl, it was drinkable, but not something you'd drink if
something else was around. But it was young then. Time--and the yeast in
the bottle--did its work on the diacetyl. It was light bodied and low
alcohol, but it did have some body and some hop character (good balance--the ou
nce, divided between bittering and finishing, was not excessive).  It was at le

as good as your standard Canadian ale, but a lot cheaper.  With the diacetyl
problem taken care of, I entered it in the Wisconsin State Fair in the
catch-all category as a low-alcohol beer and took a third place ribbon.
The judges didn't think it was anything exciting in the context of the
universe of homebrews, but thought it reasonably well-done for the kind of
beer I was brewing.


No cheap adjuncts. More flavour with half the alcohol!


Now we know what the "Ice beer" ads mean when they say "more of what you want"
(alcohol) and "less of what you don't" (body, flavour).  Looks like I turned
that one upside down.

Subject:      Copyright and Distribution


  I don't want to fan the flames on this copyright debate any more
than they already are, but I personally don't see a whole lot of
difference between the recovery of cost for someone who is taking the
time and effort to make paper copies of the HBD for people who don't
have 'Net access (but who are interested in the topic) and the
profit-making of someone who sells commercial access to the 'Net
(eg. AOL, GEnie, etc.) through which many people now get their
access to the HBD.  In fact, I find the paper version less exploitative
and purer of motive, as far as "protecting our rights" goes.


  I run a (non-beer-related) 'Net newsletter, and we are thinking about
making paper copies which we would mail to people who are interested
in the topic areas, but who don't have 'Net access.  I think it's just
increasing the distribution for the material, and the money that may
change hands is only to offset the costs of photocopies and postage.


  When the commercial access providers start paying us authors a
royalty for the distribution of our writing, then I think it's fair
to raise the copyright question.  Until then, I think we want to
encourage the free flow of ideas, rather than getting all worked up
over actually collecting on our $.02.

Subject: Mash Yield Calculations


I have been trying to track mash yields to see if things like the sparge
temperature, maltmill settings, runoff rates etc can be optimised for my
process. Looking back over recent batches, it seems like all I have is noisy
data - from 24 to 31 pts per pound and no strong correlations.


Looking at the way I set up the calculation, knowing the grain and OG values
is straightforward. But I got to thinking about the wort volume. I had been
using the volume in the primary fermenter. But last batch, I checked how
much cold break slurry I threw out, nearly 3 quarts. So if I include this
discard in the yield calculation I am 5.75/5 or 15% better off. That gets me
into Miller territory (well almost), my 28 pts yield goes to 32 for this batch.


While I haven't been measuring this discard volume, it does vary quite a bit
batch to batch - big brews with lots of hops produce more cold break.


Since bigger yields make me feel better, I will be using the fermenter plus
discard volume in future calculations. There are probably lots of you who do
this already, but Obvious Improvements take the longest to discover.


Overall, I don't feel that bad though. Through HBD I have made a number of
changes with good results. Upgrading to the maltmill improved things by 2-4
pts, using hotter sparge water (190-195) and insulating keeps the grain bed
at about 170 (previously I was using about 175 and the bed cooled to less
than 150) and improved things another 2 pts. Finally, controlling the runoff
rate makes a big difference. Slowing the runoff gave me much more runoff (!)
and improved the yield 3 pts. The only problem with that last batch is the
sparge water neets to be hotter, or I need to cover my zap-pap setup to stop
the heat loss from the top.


Well there is always another batch to do.

You have a good handle on storage.  Key element is moisture control.  If
you keep the grain well sealed (I keep mine in their bags *and* in a
sealed plastic tub) in a relatively dry environment, you will not have t
o worry about (a) deterioration of the malt or (b) vermin.  According to
a professional presentation at Great Western Malting I attended several
years ago, keeping the moisture down below 5% (which is where it should
be when you buy it) will mean that insect pests and rodents will not be
attracted to it.  You might put some traps in, if you think there are
mousies around, and make sure there are no gaps in the lids of your tubs
for mousies to climb through (they can get through *very* small spaces).


I buy all my malt in  bulk and keep it much the way you describe.  SO
far <knock wood> no insects, no mousies, and no mold.

Subject: Uses for the HBD


Look! A dead horse! Let's flog it some more!


The scribe for our club newsletter was taken to task for incorporating some
information found in the HBD into the club newsletter. This letter is a
not for profit source of information to brewers, many who do not have access
to the HBD. OK all of you budding author wanna-bees. How do you feel about
this subject? Does my club need to pay royalties for use of the information
presented in this public discussion?


I don't see what the problem is. A majority (pick your percentage, 50%, 75%,
99%?) of what appears in this forum is of little use to the average brewer.
It seems that it is most useful for the passive-aggressive nerd-brewer who
wants to stomp on as many toes as possible. Every once in a while, a truly
golden nugget of information comes along. I save these nuggets in a file,
adding to it when a new nugget comes along. There are several writters out
there who are doing their damndest to keep the quality level high. (I thought
that I was one of them, until I started writing this post, only to realize
that in doing so, I was perpetuating the problem...) Any attempt to
translate to hard copy and sell this forum would be met with the requirement
that all of the flotsam and jetsam be removed first. But what if we take the
remainder, good, solid information from competent brewers/writers, and made
it available to other brewers? There must be 400 clubs in the US alone, and
their 400 newsletters are in constant need of 'filler' of some kind. Do we
allow this sort of copying and dissemination? I hope so.


This forum is for sharing ideas and experiences. If you get more kicks out
of flaming this and dissing that, maybe we could start another fourm for you.
Until then, I suggest we keep the BEER digest onto the subject of BEER. And
mead, cider, wine, sake, kettles, chillers, yeasts, grain, etc.


I'm here if you want to flame me. I'll try not to take it personally. I'll
even look at them before dumping to null.void. But at least those flames
will not have to appear on the digest, and I know that I'll be doing
thousands of people all around the planet the favor of keeping them from
having to read about people disagreeing with me...

Sure, we can always skip over posts we are not interested in, but keep in 
mind that the HBD is not an infinite resource: it is limited to about 1000 
lines per day. Every post that gets published means another post won't.


This is not to say that every post has to appeal to every HBD reader or even
a majority of the readers.  That is impossible. But I do think that every post 
should appeal to some reasonable percentage of us (perhaps 5-10%).
 
For example, mashing information won't appeal to extract brewers, but will
still be of interest to the large number of brewers (probably > 50%) that do 
an occasional mash. Likewise, fruit beer recipes won't appeal to the purists 
among us, but there is still a decent-sized minority (at least 20%) that brews 
them regularly. On the other hand, there is no reason to expect that posts 
about particular homebrew shops will appeal to more than 1% of all HBD readers.
This, I feel, is a waste of bandwidth.

Subject: Decoction Mash


 .... He describes various decoction regimens and what puzzles me
is that he seems to include grain with the decoctions....
 one is told to take 'a stiff decoction, bring it
up to conversion temperature, give it a conversion rest and then boil for
up to 45 minutes' ...
This implies that grain is included in the decoction.
Any experts out there who can help me out? 


*  Sounds like the trick.  You do want to boil the grain portion.
You run it thru a mini conversion, then boil to break up starch 
conglomerates and make more starch available.  The enzymes are soluble
and remain in the liquid.  If you just remove liquid for a decoction
you kill some of the enzymes, and don't make MORE starch available.
Just don't burn it.


Part of what makes a decoction work is the early COOL acid rest.
Don't mashin hot, or it won't be acidic enough. By lowering the pH
you protect the grain from losing to much tannin into the brew.
During a sparge, you don't want to get things too hot cuz you lose 
some of the buffering of the mash, and can be more likely to draw
out tannin,  but a brief boil under the right conditions does no
harm.  Noonan's book (lagering) is pretty good on this.
