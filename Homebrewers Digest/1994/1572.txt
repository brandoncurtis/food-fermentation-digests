Welcome to the mashing world!  Since you went to the work of doing a
mash, I would suggest that you drop a few pounds of extract from the
recipe and add about 3 Lbs of pale ale or US 2 row malted barley to the
mash.  All of the steps are the same, you just need a device big enough
to lauter/sparge the extra pounds of malt.  BTW, you say to add a gallon
of water to the mash, I think you meant to add a gallon of water to the
wort runnings in the kettle.  You dont want to be boiling the mash and
the extract, but Im sure this is not what you did!
 
While Im at it, Id also suggest a bit more kettle hops than the Fuggles,
Liberty has a distinct bitterness and closer to 2-2.5 oz of kettle hops
would be nice for a start.  BTW, what was the OG?  This is important to
keep track of your progress in mashing.

10 -20 minutes is quite normal.  And if you think this is a long time,
ask a brewmaster how long it takes to clarify a mash for a 25 BBL brew,
its about a hour or more.

Its not good!  Caustics do not remove true beer stone, if this is really

caustic cleaning (TSP is another good choice) still leaves a buildup, then
you need to work on the beer stone.  For your SS vessal, you might be

Exactly.  I feel the British Milds and bitters are about as low as

You completely lost me!  I have a single CO2 inline through the right

from the front of the door.  A drip pan is under, with a drain going back
inside the fridge to a collection vat in the door.  This is a very important
feature, the waste beer stays inside of the fridge for a few days and
is not as foul as an outside drain.  The hoses are long enough to open the
door and change kegs easily.   To clean, remove the lines and flush, and
use a taphandle brush to scrub the shank.  Remove the tap assembly and
clean this too.  You can also buy a inline flush system that the bars use

Answering my own post (which I thought may appear in #1570 but didn't make it) 
re: copyright and doing research.  My wife is a 2nd year law student at 
Georgetown U. and is currently in a copyright class.  I asked her what the law 
is regarding this matter.  The answer is contained in the Copyright Act of 1976

others.  It is a violation of the author's copyright to reproduce their work

Robert et all,
I built an immersion type chiller from 15' of 1/2" copper, 6' of hose, a
"connect to you drill" type self priming pump ($4 HW store), and connectors.
I dont want to discount the ease of "chilling directly to the carboy" with a
CF chiller,"BUT" I have yet to see a post where any one can chill 2-3 gallons
of wort to 80-85 deg. and add it to 2-3 gal. cold water (final 70-75 deg.) and
pitch in 5-minutes.
I fill one Kitchen sink with a bag of ice and run some tap water into it.
Pump the water out threw the chiller into the other sink. I use a var-speed
drill and vary the speed to keep the output temp. high. This method saves ice
and water. A buddy of mine and I have been making 2 batches at a time so we
use a full bag of ice and maybe 4 gallons of water total.
When I'm done I just rinse the chiller and empty the water out an I'm done.
I hope this helps.

TSP from _The Home Brewery_ in Missouri (800)321-BREW. I have never had a

When you are beginning your sparge, the cloudiness comes from two sources 
 - the
suspended particulates in the "dead space" under the false bottom, and the
particulates that are not well trapped in the matrix of the grain bed.
Recirculating washes out the second and traps them in the bed when you return
the wort, and it does help flush out the dead space.  But only a little time
will allow the dead space to completely settle out.  I recirculate 
(rather fast,
since I'm not worried at this point about extract, but not so fast as to 
compact
the bed) about 6 - 8 quarts.  This will nearly clear the runoff.  Then I 
let it
sit a few minutes and then recirculate a little more and start 
collecting.  I
doubt that the whole thing takes 15 minutes.  You can also heat the 
recirculate
if you are worried about heat loss, which takes us to:


Rick:

Don't throw out your precious wort! Filter it, reboil and cool it!  Take 
a piece
of old sheet (or tee shirt, etc.) and tie it over the mouth of a large 
bowl or
other container (I use a one gallon plastic measure).  Put your slurry in 
there
(you can try to decant in as much clear wort as possible).  Wait, maybe 
scrape
the cloth filter with a spoon.  You can even remove the cloth, gather up the
edges (don't spill it, I have), and squeeze it.  Since it's cool, you 
don't have
to worry about HSA (hot side aeration).  Reboil the clear wort, recool, 
and now
you have 3 more qts. of potential beer.


>or I need to cover my zap-pap setup to stop the heat loss from >the top.


Do it!  Just glue a circle of styrofoam sheet on the lid.  It'll make a big
difference.

I don't *think* anyone has even faint objections to this sort of fair
use.  None.  Really.  I will say that, in the past, when a club
newsletter editor wanted to use something I've written, I've gotten a
very polite request to reprint (not necessarily always, of course -- how
would I know?), and I've always cheerfully given permission.  Why not?
very flattering request.


As a former newsletter editor, I agree that the HBD has great potential
for someone willing to do a lot of work digging.  Me, I'd mine it for
contributions from people like  George Fix on HSA, Glenn Tinseth on
hops, etc....... and I'd ask for permission to reprint, since that's the
easy and polite thing to do.


Sometimes, it's easier to quote lots of little bits from an ongoing
discussion and then we've really entered into a safe fair-use area.

Subject: My Spin on Cooler mashing.


Hi Group,
Rick asked yesterday about whether false bottoms were needed in conjunction
with copper or pvc manifolds. To which I will answer with a hearty NO. I will
go further and say that you don't need those Whirly-gig sparger sprayers
either!


Mashing in a cooler is the Best method for the homebrewer IMNSHO. (Let me
qualify that and say that I am currently using three indepen'tly heated
converted kegs w/ manifolds for my brewing. But thats because I like to
experiment. I still say that if you want the best performance with the least
investment and fuss then you should use a cooler).


Now then, I recommend soft copper tubing for the manifold. Why? Because you can
bend it to the shape you want and its continuous. You can run it out-up-over
the side like a siphon if you dont want to run it out the spigot hole. Or you
can use rigid tubing with the solderable connectors (which you don't need to
solder, just slip together). Whichever, use a thin bladed hacksaw or Dremel to
cut slots in the tubing. I use the small, thin, six inch hacksaws, the wort
clears quicker with the narrower slot. Cut the slots diagonal to the length of
the tubing about one  tube diameter apart. Cut them only halfway into the tube
and face them all down so they will lay against the bottom of the cooler. Try
to cover a majority of the cooler-bottom surface area, but realize that this is
not critical in view of the obvious success of the EASYMASHER SYSTEM by JSP,
which uses a single screened tube.


I recommend pre-heating the cooler with hot water (dump it) before adding the
grist and mash water. This keeps your heat loss to the cooler at a minimum. I
have never lost more than 2 degrees during an hour long mash this way.
 
To Sparge, drain the first couple quarts of the sweet wort and recirculate it
to the top. Drain again until the fluid level just gets to top of the grain
bed, then stop. Place a plastic coffee can lid on the grainbed and pour your
sparge water onto this. From here on out, maintain an inch of water over the
grainbed bed at all times. Adjust your out-flow to maintain a steady slow flow
while maintaining the level of sparge water at one inch. Stop when you when see
a noticeable color change in the wort, indicating that you are getting mostly
sparge water out the outflow. Or use a hydrometer and stop when the gravity of
the wort drops to 1.008.


That's it, those are my opinions on mashing with a cooler. For more details on
construction, there are several files available at the various archive sites.
If you have specific questions on my methods, feel free to email me.


Hope this helps, simpler IS better,

It was my understanding that SM is an inhibitor -- ie, adding it early will
keep a ferment from starting, but once the yeast gets rolling it takes a hell
of a lot more SM to stop it.  And even then, it's not killing the yeast, but
just halting it's growth.


Any expert opinions out there?

Brian sed,
>     To be simplistic,... grain is actually a seed... will germinate
 ...internal changes and produces the starch (complex sugars)...
Malting grain is simply the process of providing the right conditions 
(temp. and moisture) to allow it to germinate and then halting the process 
by drying the grain....can also be kilned at higher temperatures in order 
to produce the various speciality malts (crystal, chocolate, black etc.). 


*   It's good not to oversimplify...but you're basically on target.


One problem:  The starch is actually produced during the development of
the grain granule.  The endosperm of the seed contains stored starch 
complexes.  What happens during germination is that enzymes (made of
proteins)  are produced (synthesized, transported) that are capable of 
breaking down the starch into the usable sugar forms for fast energy.

What malting does is to begin the germination, then halt it, and as you say
the grain can be kilned in a number of different ways to create dif. colors...
etc.  It is the enzymes, and the starches (mostly) in the malt that brewers
are after, at least for a base malt.  Some specialty malts are kilned at
high enough temperatures that enzymes are eliminated (black, roast, choco). 
Some are kilned at only slightly higher temps so the color is darker but the
enzymes are intact (vienna, munich).  But I'm not gonna list them all.
Just realize that there is an infinite array of combinations of temperature
and time in the kilning process that can lead to all dif. variations
of malt qualities.  Not to omit the fact that the duration of the germination
period has a significant impact.  The amount of modification is the key
difference between american and european pale malts.

The best reference I've seen is "The Biotechnology of Malting and Brewing"
by J.S. Bough. I found it at the university library (do you believe it! In Ut!)
If you didn't understand any of the spewage that I just threw at you -you
will probably find portions of this book even less digestible, but it's
actually written pretty goodly, nice diagrams, figures...etc.


Millers book handles malts pretty well.  The allgrain zymurgy does have 
some choice tidbits.  As for home malting- there's that article, and
then I once received about a 5 page summary of Home Malting.  Has a neat
"how to" flow chart of times/temps to make differnt types of malts.
How's this for a solitication: I'll send anyone a copy for a homebrew!   :)
Think I'll make any profit?  Depends on how good your beer is I s'pose!


Wasn't there a mashing/ or malting faq done?  The all-grain has some info.
Oh- the bottom line in the articles was that there was never a finer
pleasure than malting your own - but articles are  like that. A pitch.

I had an OG of 1.015 from the second runnings of a 1.070 pseudo Fullers clone.
I didn't check the gravity until after it was up to a boil (yes- cooled the

It finished down about he same-  below 1.010, maybe even down to 1.050.
But after it was kegged and primed- it had a nice creamy head, full hop nose-
even lots of malty "body".  Yeah it was thinner and lighter that most of my

_In response to Phil Proefrock, HBD 1570_
The way I see it:
There is a public resource, a Reservoir (internet). Public funds maintain that
reservoir and some people have set up boating launches with snack bars and
amenities to provide additional access (AOL). But the majority of users use the
public beach and restroom. (.edu, freenet) Now there are "fishing" clubs that
use the reservoir. They catch fish, but also stock fish. Some of the members
use the public facilities, some use the private. There is an understanding that
the resource and its contents belong to the public. There is a balance between
what is stocked and what is taken by the Public. The club doesn't mind public
fishing, they are supporting the sport because they like it.
Now along comes the Walnut Creek corporation. They pull up to the reservoir,
hook up a pump and fill a tanker truck with water and fish. They then take this
to another location and sell it, claiming that all they are doing is bringing
the resource to the people. Pretty soon there are less fish in the reservoir,
and other people start charging for the resource too, and the Club starts going
elsewhere where their contributions will be uncorrupted.


I will continue to support this forum and archives, I like donating my time and
words in return for what I have learned. But I will be damned if I will
stand-by while someone else sells my donation. Internet access providers are
not doing this, they are providing alternative access to the reservoir along
with other services. When Walnut Creek publishing comes along, takes what is
otherwise free and markets it for profit, then that is unethical. 


I debated about posting this to the HBD, I would like to see only brewing info
here, but I feel very strongly about this and decided that this topic will
evolve into a decision that will greatly influence the future of the HBD and
the internet archives. I will not post any more follow ups to the discussion to
the HBD, reserving those to direct email. Thank you for your time.

Subject: Decoction mashing


Yes you boil grains this isn't a problem if the mash is done in the correct 
ph range. 


Darryl Richmans recent book on Bock has a superb piece on decotion mashing, 
its easier to follow than the one published by Noonan in Brewing Lager 
Beers.


Why do a decoction:
  Improved extraction due to additional starch gelatinization.
  Flavor and aroma enhancement due to increased melanodin formation.
  Add additional heat to an unheated mash tun.


Decoctions will cause wort darkening, the longer the boil the darker.


I have used decoctions in a couple of ale batches recently using the 
mashing schedule which has been recently suggested for highly modified 
grains.  It proved an easy way of getting my main mash to the next temp 
rest.


Initial rest at 95-105F   Fix likes higher Narziss lower
infuse with boiling water to 140F
final rest at 158F


After 10 minutes at 140 I pulled 40-50% of the grain, raised it to 158F
held for 15 minutes boiled and added to the main mash my main mash setteled 
in at or near 158F.


After starch convertion, I drained a gallon of liquid and added a
gallon of water boiled and added to the main mash to mash out.

Stephen Tinsley writes


The recipe that I used is as follows:


(5 gallons)
8 lbs Munton and Fisons light malt extract
1/2 lb 40L Crystal Malt
1/2 lb Munich Malt
1/2 lb Cara Pils Malt
1.5 oz Fuggles Hops (bittering)
3.5 oz Cascade Hops (flavor, aroma, dry-hop etc)
Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast culture


Mash the Crystal, Munich and Cara Pils malts in a couple of quarts of 150
degree (all degrees in Farenheit, sorry non-US) water for about 30 minutes.
 .........[etc]




Having never done any partial mashes (jumped straight from all extract to
all grain), I wonder if mashing 1.5lbs of grain is worth all the work?  It
would seem to me that with 8 lbs of extract providing fermentables, you
could have just steeped those grains for 30 minutes as the water came to
a boil to extract some of their characteristics without needing to 
hassle with mashing.  Personally, if I'm going through all that work,
I'm going to use more than 1.5 lbs!


Thoughts?

Hey fellow brewers,


I have a friend who is traveling to the Seattle area next week.  He has 
agreed to bring me back some of the better beers of the greater Pacific 
Northwest.  My explicit interest in these beers (besides savoring and imbibing 
them) is building upon my small but growing yeast collection.  So, if anyone 
could suggest *bottle-conditioned* microbrews from that area, I would be 
greatly appreciative.  Replies by private e-mail, of course, in hopes of 
avoiding being engulfed in flames---it may already be too late for that.

Since I was the one to say they are happy to sell to individuals, I
had better correct myself.  I called my local office and asked
directly if they would and the answer was "Of course, if anyone comes
in with cash in hand, we will not refuse to sell to them."  Upon
further investigation with the salesperson I found out that the
official company policy is that they sell only to businesses.


So, I guess we here in San Diego are lucky our office does not want to
refuse business to anyone.  In your city, you will have to query your
local office.  


Sorry for any confusion I caused, but I made the assumption that since
I had walked in as an individual and purchased without hassle, it was
the company policy.

Help


I'm still new at this brewing thing, trying to read everything
I can. I got a fundemental question.


Some brew in one bucket, some use a secondary.
Why?
A secondary fermentor must add something that you just don't
get in a primary, assuming that you will keep things clean
enough to prevent contamination.
I assume I have the concept right where in single container brewing
one waits for fermentation to stop and then immediately primes and
racks to bottles.
I haven't found a good answer to this one.
Thanks in advance

It is probably a chlorophenol.  These compounds have a distinct plastic,
"band-aid" like odor.


>What can cause phenol?


Chorophenol will occur when chlorine is present during fermentation.
Common causes of chlorine are either from your water supply, or from
chlorine bleach used for sanitizing.  Pre-boiling brewing water will
eliminate chlorine from your water supply, and if you sanitize with
chlorine, you may want to rinse more thoroughly.

I had a batch with chlorophenols, it did not seem to diminish over time.
YMMV.

Yes.

Greetings and salutations!


Just wanted to thank everyone who replyed to my request on getting more 
body at bottling time and priming with molasses (Tom Zeran 
<tzeran`at`qalcomm.com>, Roger Grow <grow`at`sumatra.mcae.stortek.com> and 
Aaron <COX003`at`WCSUB.CTSTATEU.EDU>).


Here's the general concensus:


        *Add anywhere from 4 to 8oz malto-dextrine with priming sugar (MD 
        isn't fermentable so will add body)


        *Make up normal priming solution with 1c water and corn sugar, 
        find OG.  Make up solution of water and molasses to same OG. 


        *Aaron used 3c MD/6gal beer


I think I'll find a good medium (weigh out 3c MD, see if it compares and 
then extrapolate) and then prime with the molasses (to get 'da flava).  
I'll post again in a few weeks with the results (opening 1st bottle on 
thukey day).


Have a hoppy!

I also just started my first cider.  When I bought the cider, I
talked to a guy at the orchard who had been making hard cider for
around 15 years.  He recommended using champagne yeast and adding
lactose to taste at bottling time (he said he used around 2oz per 5
gallons).  Since S. cerevisiae does not ferment lactose, it does not
add to carbonation, just taste.  He also said that adding pectic
enzyme before pitching the yeast (after might be OK, too) helped to
speed up the secondary fermentation.
