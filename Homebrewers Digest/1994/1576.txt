Subject: HBD has already been published on CD ROM!!!


I *hate* to post this, because I am as sick of the copyright discussion
and flames as anyone, but I think there are a lot of us who would like
to know that a Windoze CD ROM of the HBD has *ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED!*
Nevermind some guy wanting to print it out.  The following is excerpted
from a thread currently on usenet's Rec.Crafts.Brewing.  (RCB).


Apparently, besides not even mentioning this on the HBD, the makers of this
CD didn't do a very good job.  BTW, the *Cat's Meow* is also reportedly on
the CD ROM.  Please don't flame me on this one.  I had _nothing_ to do with
the CD, just stumbled accross this on usenet. Thanks.  Hope it's not in the
HBD a dozen times today.  I hope Al doesn't give up entirely on us after
all this.  I think they are charging $29 for the cd, which also includes
a lot of homebrew catalogs, scanned into text and graphics file.  I have
not seen the CD, nor am I planning on buying it.

Maybe rather then looking at actual culturing, you wanna look at more
efficient use of the commercial cultures. Here's what I do.


Plan your brewing schedule to include beers that will use the same yeast.
I have messed successfully with the Wyeast California Lager strain, the
Anchor yeast. Pop the packet, run up a starter (I do a couple-3, big
pitches being desireable) and make the first beer. I brewed a California
Common first. Rack off the primary, and harvest the barm in the bottom. I
just swirl up the lees and pour into sanitized 22oz. tall bottles. I happened
to wind up with 3 of these this time, don't fill them, just some at the bottom.
I feed these some new wort, let them work, then cap & chill after
the bubbling slows down. It has also worked without feeding, but why
push it. This gives you healthy, happy yeast, in quantity, to use next
batch. Feed these again when you plan to use them, in a new sanitized bottle.
I then used one of these to pitch a Porter (Anchor used the steam
beer yeast on theirs, apparently until very recently), one the second runnings
 of the Porter, and the third a Cream Ale for a true bastard ale. All were
fermented at 65F and then cold aged. All came out clean and tasty, and the
non-opaque brews cleared up nicely with time. The whole process was
performed over a 3 week period from harvest to final pitch, but I have
left the refrigerated pitches as long as a month after harvesting. I
brew the paler beers for the batch harvested, as I figure a dark barm might
discolor a later lighter brew. Total yeast cost for 4 batches of beer: the
one $4 Wyeast packet. 


Here's why I think this works: I have been told that the barm off of a 
good vigorous primary is healthy and hungry, even with whatever trub
you might collect. By feeding it before storage, and before use, it
stays that way. These are big pitches compared to the original Wyeast
packet, and a big pitch has a better chance of beating out whatever
nasties you may wind up with in the bottles. The later brews seem to benefit
from having an earlier generation then if you did it serially (pitching
one after the other could lead to mutation). 


You can't get away with sloppy techniques: I sanitize bottles in iodaphor,
flame the necks with a lighter before transfer, most of the stuff in the
yeast FAQ. You still have to be anal about it, but mebbe not so much as if
you're trying to grow a big pitch out of what sticks to a loop.


As for equipment, I've said I just use 22oz. bottles, plus a little Kymax
funnel, and sanitized caps. A small stopper and S-shaped bubbler are
needed after you've fed the pitches. I even have a system for telling the
bottles apart - Rogue Brewing has fancy silkscreened labels on their
tall bottles. I just use one of each in the process, and note which label
indicates which contents. Easy, and colorful, too. I should say that 
I am experimenting with 1gal. jugs and large wine jugs with small fluid
amounts to take advantage of the fermenter geometry work George Fix 
talked about. Works well, but you can't fit as many into a sanitizing
bucket...  




>Please dont point me to the Yeast faq, I've read it, I want answers from 
>people who do this on a regular basis, cheaply and efficently, not

My degree is in music (composition), and I make REALLY GOOD BEER.
(Down, ego, down!) I look forward to hearing whatever response this post
brings.

Subject: Green Beer around the corner




I hate hearing about seasonal beers AFTER everyone's brewed them...  I've
been a little late on a few lately..  Well, I'm going to start a Christmas
Ale soon...
   But there's one I want to get a jump on...  Green Beer for St. Patrick's
Day.  I figured there was some Irish history about this stuff, and there
was some natural way to make it green, but an Irish friend said green beer
is just an American way to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.  I heard it was
made by just adding green food coloring.  Does anyone know of a way to make
green beer by adding something natural?  Green beer head would be cool.  I
thought about adding a little blue to a yellow lager, but blueberries are
probably too purple.


Thanks for the early help..

Subject: HSA and the Sierra archives


I have read a lot about HSA and was wondering about the limits of it.
I have alwas poured my hot wort (not boiling) directly into a
carboy partially filled with cold water. From this you can guess that I
use extracts. Not lazy, just satisfied with my product. At what tempreature
is HSA no longer a problem? 80C? 50C? 30C? or should i go all the way
down to pitching temp?


Also, I have tried time and again to get ANY kind of response at
sierra.stanford.edu so I can check the archives. I can login and
that works OK, but no command from that point on works, even
following the VERY SHORT help message I sent for from the list server.
If anyone that has had the same problem can help me, I sure would
appreciate it.

Subject: acronyms


Gary posted some acronyms.  Here are my comments on some of them.
>AAE       Alpha-Amylase Enzyme


Never have seen this one.


>ABC       Anchor Brewing Company


>From context, I've determined that this is usually the equivalent of
BATF (Bureau of Alcohol Tobbaco and Firearms) in some states.  That is
not to say that Anchor Brewing collects liquor taxes in some states, but
that this acronym does not usually mean Anchor Brewing Company.


>BAE       Beta-Amylase Enzyme


This too, I've never seen.


>DE        Diastatic Enzyme


No.  Usually, it means "diatomaceous earth," the skeletons of tiny marine
animals (like the stuff that the white cliffs of Dover are made of) and
commonly used for filtering, especially in filtering beer


>DMS       Dimethylsulfide


Sometimes, you can tell by context, this is used for Diastatic Malt Syrup.
If you read Edme DMS extract, you can assume this meaning.


>EE        Extraction Efficiency


A new one on me.  No, really, this, AAE and BAE are not common acronyms.


>NBJCP     National Beer Judge Certification Program


That should be just BJCP and up there with the B's.  National is just
one of the ranks: Recognized, Certified, National, Master and Grand Master.


>SM        Sodium metabisulfate


Someone just started this one, and I don't think it merits inclusion
here.  I've never heard it anywhere except in this one person's post.


You may also want to add GBBF (Great British Beer Festival).

Subject: to culture or not?




RN>I have been reading for some time now how you can culture your own yeast, 
RN>and/or culture yeast from beer (previous or other peoples).  I picked up 
RN>the YEAST faq, (before you all tell me to read it :-) ) and it seems like 
RN>a VERY complicated process.  At least in the FAQ it seems complicated.  I 


        Don't be fooled.  Culturing your own yeast is simple, inexpensive, 
        and can be done with household tools.  But, like many other things, 
        it's sometimes easier if you let an expert assemble all the equipment
        you will need. Brewer's Resource (800) 827-3983 offers several kits 
        that are very inexpensive.  The best part of their kits is the 
        pamphlet written by Dr. Maribeth Raines.  Her instructions are 
        foolproof and very easy to follow.         ANY goofball can culture yeast 
        by following her guidelines (hey, I did it!).


RN>1. Can I culture the yeast in a simpler method.  
         
         Culturing from slants is about as easy as it gets (unless you count
         tearing open a packet of Red Star).  Chololate chip cookies are
         more difficult.


RN>2. Is it worthwhile to do?  


        If your trying to save money, culturing your own is much better than
        liquid packets.  My reason for culturing yeast is that I now have 
        the ability to use a yeast that is appropriate for the style of beer 
        I'm brewing.  I also think that culturing has been the single greastest 
        factor in improving the quality / character        of my beer.


RN>3. Does yeast quality degrade when I culture it myself?  
    
    I haven't experienced any problems.


RN>4. What parts do I need EXACTLY to culture the yeast.


        You could actually get by with some baby food jars for slants, a 
        mason jar for starters, a bent piece of wire for an innoculation 
        loop, and a saucepan and canning pot for making slants.  You'll 
        also need agar and DME.         


RN>5. Is this REALLY thrifty enough to go ahead with.
 
        It depends on how thrifty you want to be.  I probably average two
        bucks a batch.  If you get serious about keeping the cost low, 
        keeping the cost under a buck shouldn't be a problem.


RN>6. How time consuming is this?  


        About ten minutes to innoculate a starter from a slant and about
        fourty minutes on another day to prepare a larger starter.  
        Also figure a couple hours for the preparation of slants and small
        starters (you'll make a whole bunch during one session).  Or 
        you can opt to buy pre-poured slants and starters.  This adds to 
        the cost somewhat, but is still much cheaper than liquid yeast.

Subject: Barleywine shelflife


Recent discussions about the durability of strong beers have indicated a
wide range of flavor changes associated with multi-year aging.  Having the
good fortune of saving a sample from each of my barleywines brewed since
1987, I assembled a panel of tasters last night to do a vertical tasting of
these eight vintages.  All beers were made all grain, with no extract
whatsoever.  The results were suprising to me, particularly for the oldest
two vintages, that I had not tasted in a number of years.
The consensus of the panel was that the very oldest (1987) was the best,
followed by (almost unilateral) 1992.


The 1987 vintage was made with EDME yeast, starting gravity of 1092, and
bottle conditioned (with the same yeast).  Very complex sherry-like nose,
full of alcohol and plum/current aromas.  The flavor was very smooth, and
the oxidized nature did not distract from from its pleasant, slighlty sweet
finish.  Some, but not much, hop bitterness reamined.  Head and conditioning
were just right.  I was really surprised that a seven plus year old beer
could still be so enjoyable.


1988 was made with a liquid culture of Whitbread B (the old stuff) obtained
from a local micro.  Starting gravity 1089, and hopped harder than any beer
I have ever made.  Last night it had a very strong sherry nose, sweet and
quite complex in fruity esters.  Unfortunately, the flavor had a distinct
astringent quality that came on in mid-to late-mouth that was a definite
problem.


1989 was made with SN yeast, and although it smelled OK, had a significant
lactic problem.  Worst of the bunch.


1990, again made with SN, was the highest gravity of the lot (1100), but was
fairly mild in its nose and flavor profile.  No hops, but again that
oxidized malt sherriness prevelent in most of the beers tasted.  However,
this was the only one that had the accompanying wet-cardboard late mouth
flavor that cloyed in the palatte.  Not very good.


1991, SN yeast again, og 1094, was quite good, and one taster picked it as
his second favorite.  Nose better than flavor in my book, as it seemed
simply too sweet.


1992, SN yeast (last time, I promise), and the first that I counter pressure
filled.  Very complex esters, with plum and berry like fruit and alcohol
dancing across the toungue.  Quite nice, and my pick as second best.
Slightly undercarbonated, but OK.  Lasting body that really stayed with you
for a satisfying late finish (kept going and going and going...).


1993, made with medocino yeast, og 1095.  Great nose, with only a trace of
sherriness.  Fairly prevalent hop nose competing with malt and alcohol.
Taste: Whoah!  Enormously bitter and complex, a little too dry.  Very
different than all the previous vintages.  Very clean, but too bitter and
dry for style.


This years (9 weeks old, drawn from a keg), made with a limited availability
ale yeast, og 1092.  Dry hopping from home grown Perle very easily
identifyable.  Nice malt and alcohol aromas slightly swamped by hop nose.
Flavor realatively subdued in hops, with sweetness dominating.  I think this
one will not lay down that well, I may even choose to add some iso-alpha to
bring up the bitterness.  Definitely a change of pace in that fresh hops in
the nose dominated, but malt and alcohol were all that were left in the late
palatte.


All the beers were quite bright, and were aged at cellar temps.
Unfortunately, the 1987 was the last bottle, but it was quite rewarding to
get a consensus opinion about its quality.  I dont know what to make of the
fact that it was the only one made with dry yeast.  Luck perhaps.  It was a
very good beer when it was young, having taken a second place in the Oregon
State Fair in 1988 (losing to Jeff Frane's best of show effort) with solid
scores in the mid 40's.  Although I'm certain that it tastes nothing like it
did then ( well, maybe a little) it was still quite fine after considerable
aging.  Take home message: try aging your strong ales, the results might
just please you.

What is the general net wisdom about the proper pressure for counter

Subject: Corny Kegs


 
In HBD-1574 Jeff Stampes suggests restaurant supply places as a
likely source of used kegs cheap. Another possibility is the local
soft drink plant or depot, like the local Pepsi place...to get Coke
kegs!
 
The way it works, a restaurant signs up with say, Coca Cola for soft
drink supplies. They pay a small deposit (like $5/keg) for their
kegs, and as they empty 'em the driver comes by and swaps in full
kegs for empties.
 
So what happens when the restaurant owner gets ticked off at Coke? Do
they call 'em up and say "Come and get yer kegs?" Nope, they just
call up Pepsi and sign up for their service, and when the Pepsi
driver shows he says "Will you take these kegs away with you?"
 
Now what're the Pepsi people gonna do with Coke kegs? They can't use
'em, they're incompatible. (and they've been contaminated) They aren't
gonna call up the Coke folks and say "We got a couple of your kegs,
want us to bring them over to you?" No, they just sit around until
someone throws them out with the scrap, or someone like you just
happens to ask "Got any kegs you can't use?"
 
Which is how I came by three kegs. My brother in law drives for
Pepsi, he thought we could scam a couple of kegs for the deposit, but
it wouldn't work. BUT in his chat with one of the other drivers, he
found out about these useless kegs, and they became ours for free.
 
Asking is free.

The first two and the last could indicate a hyper-attenuating

=======================


Anent the discussion about regional postings in the digest: some
enterprising souls in Seattle (Dave Brockington? & ?) have started a
regional list dedicated to beer and homebrewing discussion.  I gather
it's been on a while but just now gone "public".  Lots of gabble about
places to drink, etc., which one can easily delete or read.


So, perhaps this is the ideal solution for people wanting/needing to get
and disperse regional information?  Ideal, of course, assuming someone
is willing to get a list up and running.

Subject: _Imperial_? Stout...don't mean to nitpick, but....


Strangely enough, Jeff Renner sent his reply to the huge-stout/needs-hops-
and- hydrometer guy's post right after I did, and we gave similar responses.


I don't mean to nitpick, but I would disagree with Jeff saying that what
the brewer (sorry, forgot name) had was an Imperial Stout. To be certain, he
had a very high gravity beer that was brewed with the intention of it being a
stout. But I wouldn't characterise it as an Imperial for the very reason that
it doesn't have nearly the bitterness of an Imperial Stout or Barley Wine.


I know what Jeff probably had in mind when he said it, but it's important to be
more careful with language (not that I'm not guilty of a little imprecision
from time to time :-) ). We have a wonderful diversity of brewers and other
beer folk on the digest: professional brewers, biologists, chemists,
near-professionals, equipment fanatics, people like me who like to keep things
simple but still manage to brew (usually) enjoyable beers, beer travellers,
and, yes, people just getting started and learning about this wonderful
passion. A fair number of recipes of one sort or another get posted; I usually
page down past them because I prefer to formulate my own recipes, but some
people try them. If you say that the recipe shown was an Imperial, except that
it needed a little more hops, someone's gonna try it (with a marginal boost in
the hops) and either be disappointed, or enjoy the beer (whatever you might
call it) and _then_ be disappointed after entering it in a competition and have
the judges say it wasn't anywhere close to style.


It takes more than high gravity to make an Imperial, and I'm sure Jeff knows
that, but there are people who are learning about beer who might not know it
yet and we should be careful about inadvertently giving bad information.


I hope I don't need the flame-resistant suit (I don't use asbestos for health
reasons :-) ) for sounding picky.

Subject: Re: Master Judge is Stumped!


Chuck Cox refers to a recent batch of O'Fest that he brewed and lists
a *major* set of problems that he has identified with this beer: 


> - Reduced Maltiness 
> - Reduced Complexity 
> - Increased DMS 
> - Increased Oxidation 
> - Increased Haziness 


Also some side effects: 


> - Upset Stomach 
> - Increased Flatulence 
> - Reduced Sex Drive 


At first it would appear that Chuck's request to identify a single
error that would account for all of these problems is an
impossibility.  However, this is not the case.  There is, in fact, a
common element among his problems:  lack of coriander!  Chuck, could
you have inadvertantly left it out of your latest batch? 


The most recent issue of Zymurgy (Special issue, 1994) contains an
article on this wonder spice that literally lets the cat of the bag. 
It is revealed that in small amounts, coriander adds malty complexity
to Oktoberfests.  This would also account for Chuck's increased sense
of DMS - the lack of coriander obviously lowered the complex malty
aroma of his beer, leaving only a DMS nose (which is always present in
small amounts in Continental lagers). 


In addition, Chuck could have avoided both HSA oxidation and haziness
very simply.  A few coriander seeds added to the mash has been shown
to reduce HSA, slow the oxidation process of beers, and quickly clear
the final brew (again, see the Coriander article, page 44, Special
Issue 1994 Zymurgy). 


On a final note, the Coriander article states that the spice is known
to have health benefits. Coriander teas are used to both calm upset
stomachs and cure flatulence.  In addition, it has occasionally been
referred to as an aphrodisiac ("The One Thousand and One Nights", for
example). 


So Chuck, I hope that this helps you out on your next brew.  There are
other terrific tidbits of info in that Zumurgy article.  I recommend
that everyone read it carefully so that you can start using coriander
and not have the same problems that beset Chuck.

No, not in my experience.  The 35 ppg for the syrup is about right, but the
28 ppg for the Pale malt already accounts for non-100% efficiency -- depending
on the maltster, 100% efficiency would be between 30 and 34 ppg.  The problem
with your calculations is the crystal/toast and choc/bp ppgs.  If you use
32 ppg for the pale, 28 for the crystal/toast and 20 for the choc/bp, you
can then figure out your efficiency.


Your efficiency is more a factor of your lauter tun, pH and crush quality
than it is a factor of what your mash schedule is.  Sure, if you use a lot
of unmalted grains or flaked oats you will get a much easier (and therefore
more efficient) lauter if you use glucan and protein rests, but for straight
pale/crystal/color malts, the mash schedule should not alter your efficiency
more than a point.

I'll reply in reverse order.


5. Not quite -- you should have first checked the FAQs for your answers
and then posted if you still didn't understand or had additional questions.
I'll be terse with the rest of the answers since most of them are in one
FAQ or another.


4. I too prefer to avoid using bleach.  I use either One-Step (yes, it is
a sanitizer, just not govt. certified yet to be called one) or Iodophor,
depending on my mood.  Don't soak anything in either of these too long
since the One-step will leave a carbonate residue and the Iodophor will
stain plastics brown after a few days soaking.


3. Dry yeast should be rehydrated in 90-110F sanitized water.  I boil up
a cup of water in a pyrex container, let it cool to 100F, sprinkle yeast,
let sit 15 min, pitch.


2. As a beginner, it will take some time to learn the mechanics of brewing,
but it won't take too long.  Cool to about 80F before aeration with
an ice bath, sanitized-water-icecubes or a wort chiller.  Avoiding HSA is
not critical to making good brew, but IMO it is critical to making great,
as-good-as-commercial brew.


1. I use single-stage fermentation for virtually all my ales.  Using a 2ndary
will mean a little less yeast in the bottom of the bottles, but I feel that
the additional transfer is not worth the potential oxidation/infection unless
you are lagering or if you have an excessive amount of cold break (usually
not the case with most extracts).  I also use a 2ndary if I'm making a fruit
beer since I let the base beer ferment out in the primary before adding the
fruit.  Glass, IMO, is better than plastic because it is virtually
scratch-proof, is an oxygen barrier and allows you to do blowoff.

If the "chewing an aspirin" aftertaste was actually astringent -- a dry,
puckering kind of flavour, then I suspect that this may have been due to
the pH getting too high during the sparging (the second runnings).  Next
time, check the pH after you take the first runnings and if it's approaching
the higer 5's, acidify your sparge water.  The "vomit aftertaste," well,
that could be enteric bacteria, could be lactic bacteria (is it just very
sour?) or just a particularly unpleasant wild yeast strain.  Even if you
got the right yeast, you probably got something else in there too.  If you
want the Celis yeast, the Wyeast Belgian White yeast is reportedly quite close.

Subject: IRC Beer Tastings


As a semi-regular participant, I'll chime in here.


We do indeed meet weekly at 10pm EST (GMT-5) Tuesdays on the IRC
channel '#tasting'.  Each week we select two beers.  The first is
specified by brand, the second is usually "another in the same style."
Next week's tasting will be stouts.  In particular #1 is Guinness Pub
Draft (in the can), #2 is any other stout (although I've got Guinness
Extra Stout, to do a back-to-back comparison.)


The quality varies, depending on the participants.  It's a bit
strange at first, sipping beer and typing into the computer, while
watching the comments from others across the world who are doing the
same simultaneously.  But I enjoy it.


One aspect that I've found of value is that other people pick up
different flavors & aromas in a beer than I do.  Then I can go back to
my sample and see whether I find them, too.  Sometimes I do, sometimes
I don't.  Of course, then the question is whether it's sample variance
(different age beers, different storage conditions, etc.) or sensory
variance.  As an example, this week we started with Newcastle Brown.
I commented on it's nutty, malty aroma & flavor.  Another participant
asked whether we smelled any diacetyl.  I hadn't picked it up, but
upon checking, sure enough, there it was.  


Of course, you can do this in person with a group of friends, but I
can't easily go out to the "pub" of an evening (by the time the kids
are in bed, I'm pooped), and I don't have to drive home afterward.
