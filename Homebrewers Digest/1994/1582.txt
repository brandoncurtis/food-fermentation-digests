is a bit smaller than the Grolsch.  I live in Bangladesh so I am looking for

Well, I am pretty familiar with the Buffalo Brewing Co's products and I can
tell you that they are *not* bottle conditioned.  But- I have also seen the
problem you describe above.


You do know that an Octoberfest is not made with wheat right? Well I had a Pils
from the Buffalo Brewing Co. that had the exact same character you describe. I
have also had good bottles of the Pils and they are completely different.  


I guess BBC has had some problems with contamination from time to time or
something, because this is the only answer I can figure. I don't know if its
wild yeast or not, but that would probably explain all the nasty
characteristics (bottle conditioned appearance, sourness, thinness etc.).

Folks:
        I have been unofficially updating the Hops faq.  Actually I 'grew' an
interest hops this past year, two plants... and wanted to pass this as well as
the entire faq onto my local brew club.  I took the HOP faq and cleaned up the
formating (moved it into MicroSoft Word 5.1) and added a couple of appendices --
some of the controversy with Rager's & Garetz's utilization numbers, pesticides
and drying (I think).


        If this cleaned-up version is of interest to the net, I would be pleased
to post it to the archive (need a bit of help here for write access I think).  I
do not plan it email it to individuals (and seeing my schedule til the new year
may not reply to such requests...).  But, I have gained a lot of info from this
source, and would like to 'pay' back a bit if I may....

     Hi Folks,
     
     A fellow brewer without hbd access is responsible for providing the

Regarding Jim Busch's posting to HBD1581:
If you bubble pure O2 for 20-60 minutes  and only end up with 8 mg/l 
DO, what happens to the rest of the O2?  I think this is where the 
actual danger lies.  I don't think anyone ever implied that the beer 
could ever catch fire.  Caution certainly seems to be in order.

On another subject (peripheral subject of the week?):


from a Websters:


Acronym = a WORD formed from initial letters of a name or by 
combining initial letters or parts of a series of words


Abbreviation = a shortened form of a word or phrase used chiefly in 
writing to represent the full form


Though you could call DMS an acronym (free speech is a constitutional 
right in the USA), the most correct term seems to me to be 
"abbreviation."   I could pronounce the word beer "bee-ee-ee-are" 
(like "lets send the kids up to bee-ee-dee, honey") but I wouldn't 
call that normal speech.  Or, we could call A-B beer, but swill seems 
to be  a more appropriate term.  Lets use the better word if it fits.


I could also argue that DMS is not a word formed from the initial 
letters of a series of words, but is rather a shortened form of the 
word "dimethylsulfide"

I have to disagree here, Al.  My yeast supplier (owner of the Yeast
Culture Kit Company) has told me to grow my lager starters cold,
especially with certain yeasts (e.g., the "Munich" strain, as I
recall).  He claims that when the starter is grown warm, the yeast
"get used to it", and not work well at the cooler lager fermentation
temperature (or will throw more "interesting" flavors and aromas than
they should).  He said that this is one reason that the "Munich"
strain has a reputation for being "unstable" -- that most homebrewers
grow the starter warm and then expect it to work cold.

Subject: Microwaves and boiling beer


Microwaves have been found to be the only effective way to rid 
underclothes of Candida albicans, the yeast that causes yeast infections 
in women. This is not a joke.  I would assume that using a microwave to 
sterilize your bottles would be OK, even without water in them as any 
microorganisms contain water, and they would be adversely affected by 
being nuked.  If anyone knows different, please inform.
Rob wanted to know if he should reboil his wort.  DON'T!!  You will boil 
off all of your alcohol before the beer comes to a boil.  I would suggest 
taking a bottle of beer, pouring it into a larger wine bottle (sterilized 
in a  microwave!), adding either a calculated amount of calcium carbonate 
or a pinch, whichever you like ( or dissolve the pinch in some boiling 
water and add that), attatch a fermentation lock and see where that gets 
you.  You shouldn't have to repitch because there are still tons of yeast 
in the beer.  If that doesn't work, check the pH (to see if you did bring 
it up) and if it's up , then try some new yeast.  Experiment with a small 
amount before trying the whole batch.  BUT DON'T BOIL YOUR
 
BEER.  Better to serve a sweet beer to your friends at a swill party than 
throw away a whole batch.

You say SUDSW tells you there are only 6.5 IBU.  First I should say that the
human taste threshold is somewhere around 12 IBU, so I wouldn't bother
brewing anything with less than that.  Secondly, you didn't give a lot of
information, like the AA% of the hops you used, but I took some guesses.
Using the lowest values I've ever seen, I get about 15 IBU from the hops you
used.  Now, 15 IBU is still a very low bitterness beer, so that doesn't
explain things.  You don't say how you chilled and how long it took, which is
a major factor in accurate IBU estimates.  If it takes 30 minutes or more to
chill the beer, this will certainly affect the utilization, and throw off the
estimates.  I guess the bottom line is that I don't know how your beer got
too bitter either, without more information.  It is possible that another
flavor is being perceived as bitterness.  For example, Corona appears to
get more mileage out of light-struck hop compounds than they do from the hops
themselves!

Jim, I personally don't think you need to post this twice a month to the HBD.
We don't post FAQs here on a regular basis because everyone knows they can
get them from the archives.  This is FAQ-like but it probably changes
regularly, so I wouldn't suggest archiving it.  How about a pointer once in a
while to usenet, where it *is* posted regularly?

                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a nit, but the information I've been given is that Anchor Liberty is
OG 1.061 and 45 IBU, so doesn't fall into the range given here.  Some call it
an IPA, which may fit, but would that be an AIPA (American India Pale Ale)???
Come to think of it, SNPA is supposed to be about 30 IBU if memory serves.
If Liberty is 45 IBU, that's surprising, because there wasn't a drastic
difference in the bitterness of the two.  The Liberty was more bitter, but
50% more?  Makes me wonder if IBU *taste perception* is non-linear.  *That*
would be tough to quantify, eh?  ("Yes, its more bitter."  "How much more?"
"Oh, just a smidge."  "Would you say a smidge is closer to 5% or 25%????")

I recently made a batch of cider from a "sparking cider" kit.  The kit cost
over $20 and made 15 litres of brew.  I have been contmeplating making cider
directly from actual apple cider as it would cost a bit less and would probably
 have a lot more flavour.


I was going to use 15 litres of cider, one and a half cups of corn sugar and
one package of wine brewer's yeast (this sort of copies the recipe of the kit).


Does anyone have any experience with cider who can foresee the results of my
recipe?

I STRONGLY disagree with the statement that the Front Range has reached
capacity.  Northern Colorado Front Range is probably saturated, but
Southern Colorado Front Rangehas a long way to go.  There are only TWO
brewpubs in Colorado Springs, and NONE in Pueblo (yet!).  The only two pubs
in the Springs are right across the street from each other, so there
is LOTS of opportunity for a brewpub in any other area of town, especially
the north end (hint, hint).

Pueblo would probably be a much better place than Gunnison, simply
because it is a much larger city, and the market is ready!


You folks in Northern Colorado always seem to think that what is happening
up there is also happening down here.  Sorry, but we've got a LOT of
catching up to do before we even begin to reach "saturation".  Look
at LoDo Denver - there are something like 6 or 8 pubs in a 1 mile diameter.
Now, that's saturation.  Here in C. Springs, we're still starving for
brewpubs!

I had thought of this, and examined the packaging carefully before use. 
There was no indication of such treatment, only the words "sterile unless

Subject: Sanitation Question


I recently produce a batch of Cream Ale vinegar (my first infection...I wept 
<sniff>). In panic over getting another infection the following was done:.


     - Emptied the heady vinegar.
     - Power rinsed every bottle with the carboy washer.
     - Leaving the residual water in the bottom, I added about a 
       teaspoon of bleach to each.
     - For my next bottling just the other day I thoroughly rinsed
       the bottles and sanitized just about the whole kitchen with B-Brite
       and bottled.  The bleach had been in there for about 10 days.


Here's my theory, the bleach in the bottle would eliminate any nasties that 
could have survived the rinsing I gave the bottles or any build up of same 
(fuzzy colorful mess refered to recently by Rich Larsen) and the fumes from the 
bleach would maintain a clean environment within.  This is purely my fantasy 
and I have no fact or documentation to back it up.


Here's my question.  Is this a good practice?  Would there be any side effects 
to the interior and added beer because of the bottle's exposure to such a 
concentration of bleach?


I ask this to those out there who know the chemistry side of HB and those 
products used.


Thanks,

Borrowing Craig's restatement of Chris's question:
>The following reply was sent mailed to Chris_Cesar in response to a post 
>in Homebrew Digest openly wondering how it is that his beers come in 
>just under 5% and yet are full in body, while Bud comes in around the 
>same and is lacking in substance.


I think that there are three reasons that the mega-brews have little body
or flavor:


1. lots of adjuncts -- corn and rice add virtually no protein or dextrins
(which are the two things that give beer body -- mostly protein, though)
or flavour,


2. they intentionally mash in such a way that extracts lots of fermentables
and little dextrins (i.e. low-ish saccharification temperature)


3. they filter virtually all the remaining proteins and dextrins out of the
beer -- could you imagine the head on the average homebrew if it had the
typical mega-brew carbonation level?  Foam city!


I faintly recall a question about all-malt beers that are also insipid,
for example, Miller Reserve Amber Ale and Velvet Stout.  These beers may
be all malt, but I would not be surprised if the brewer added additional
enzymes to break down the dextrins and I truly believe they lose most of
their mouthfeel during filtering.


ON a related note, after the Spirit of Belgium Conference last weekend,
my wife and I went to Capitol City brewpub in D.C.  Now I know that these
beers are not the finest that the DC/VA/MD area has to offer, but the pub
was close to the touristy stuff we wanted to do.  Anyway, the beers did
have a reasonable amount of flavour, but were lacking in body and had
absolutely no head.  We did not have time to stay and ask questions, but
judging from the brilliant clarity, I'm confident that filtering was
the culprit.  There is some control in the amount of filtering that you do.
Perhaps Ed Bronson could give us a few tidbits of info that he has learned?


Incidentally, Old Dominion had a bar at Dulles Airport (hurray!) so I finally
did get to try them and these beers were far, far better than the Capitol
City brews.  Jim-- do you know what kind of filtering they do?


What about you Micah?  Do you filter?

Regarding 800 numbers for Homebrewing Supplies -- I think that twice per
month is probably too often, but that's just my opinion.

They are most likely not sterile if there were spores on/in whatever you
were trying to sterilize.  However, for making a regular starter that will
be instantly pitched and then used that week, it's probably good enough.
For making starters that you want to keep 6 months or for making plate-
pouring media for yeast selection or long-term storage, I'd get a pressure
cooker.

Yeah, yeah... let he who is without sin cast the first stone.


Yes, the first is complete rubbish and the second is highly questionable
(any ascorbic acid in coriander?  Aw, forget it...).  I try my best, but
sometimes stuff slips through.

Hi Homebrewers:


I am looking for an archive site that would have "Sudscm".  It is the
"Cats Meow" formatted for import into the "Sudsw" formulater for windows
that is available at "Sierra.Stanford.Edu".  It is mentioned by the author
(Michael C. Taylor) in the help file in "Sudsw", so I know it must exist
somewhere.  If anyone knows of a site or has a copy they could E-mail to
me I would be forever grateful.  Either post a reply here or E-mail.


Thanks and brew on,
Robert

Subject: Beer-of-the-Month Clubs


Beer of the month clubs offering an ever-changing selection of domestic 
micro and imported brews seem to be gaining in popularity throughout the 
US. My question, however, is does anyone know if a similar club or clubs 
exist in Canada? Alternately, does anyone know if any of the US clubs can 
or do extend their service to Canadian customers?


I suspect that the answer might be negative to both questions, what with 
bogus inter-provincial commerce laws that exist here north of the border 
and how the provinces here have a penchant for controlling the sale of 
such substances through provincially controlled liquor stores. And this 
doesn't even begin to take into account all the customs crap that exists 
between Canada and the US, free-trade agreement not withstanding.


Still, I could have sworn someone at work once told me about a friend 
here who was in a similar wine-of-the-month club and that it was operated 
out of the states. Hmmmm..... most curious.


Can anyone enlighten? (PS. I live in Quebec)
