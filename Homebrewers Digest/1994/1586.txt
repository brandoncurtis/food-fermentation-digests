Subject: Colour Formulas




Hello everybody,


I hope you can help me out on this one. Looking at colour formulas in my
different articles, books and programs, I realized that there seem to be at
least two different methods to estimate the colour of your brew from the
colour potential of the grains.




Dave Miller (in The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing) uses:


  potential * modifier * %grain * OG / 40


summed over all the grains,


where


  potential = colour potential of the grain, unit L
  modifier = factor giving the darkening of wort during boil, estimated as 1.25
  %grain = percent of total grain weight
  OG = original gravity of wort in points
  40 = gravity of laboratory test wort used to obtain the potentials.




Darryl Richman (in The Brewer's Worksheet, Excel spreadsheet available at
Sierra) uses:


  potential * grain_weight / total_volume


summed over all the grains,


where the potential now has the unit L * gallon / lbs.




MPM (sample excel spreadsheet found at Sierra, origin unknown) uses the
same as Darryl Richman, except for a correction if the colour estimate is
>10:


  corrected colour = 14.6713 * Log(colour_estimate) - 4.6713




Here are colour potentials for some grains from the different sources:




                Miller          Richman         MPM
                ????            L*gal/lb        L*gal/lb
- --------------------------------------------------------------------
English Pale    3               3               3
Roasted Barley  530             397             500
Chocolate       350             397             400
Munich          10-20           5.5             13
2-row           1.6             2.0             1.7


Of course, the colour potential may vary for a specific grain but Richman's
values seem to be generally lower. (Please don't show this to the people at
the mathematical statistics department - they'd beat me blue and yellow and
I'd end up competing with the Swedish flag :-{O> )


Well, sorry about the length of this. It may not be so important (the
colour is just a very rough estimate anyway) but I'd really like to get
things sorted out.


Response by private e-mail is fine - I'll post a summary.


TIA

Last month, Rick Gontarek submitted the following recipe for a clone of
Pete's Wicked Ale. He called it "Rick's Wicked Ale." I would like
to say that I used Rick's recipe with only minor variations and
at bottling time last night, it tasted GREAT! I can't wait to dig into
it. I would highly recommend Rick's recipe, which I have included below
(with credit to Rick of course). The only change I made really was to
dryhop with a little leftover cascades I had around the house.


Give it a try.

Subject: Recipes (Rick's Wicked Ale)


Hello everyone.  A few months back I asked anyone with suggestions for a 
Pete's wicked Ale clone to comtact me.  I received a few recipes, but as
usual, I adapt them according to my own intuition.  I respectfully
submit, then, my attempt to clone Pete's.  I call it...


Rick's Wicked Ale


8.5 lbs American 2-row pale malt
1 lb Crystal malt (40L)
1/2 lb Cara-pils malt
1/3 lb Chocolate malt
1/2 ounce Cascade hops (boil)
1/2 ounce Brewer's Gold hops (boil)
1/2 ounce Cascade hops (finish)
300 ml yeast starter- Wyeast 1056


Mash grains in 3.5 gallons of water at 75 degrees Celsius (brings temp
to 67 degrees C).  Hold at 67 degrees C for one hour until conversion is
complete.  Sparge with 5 gallons of water at 77 degrees C.  Boil sweet
wort for one hour with boiling hops.  Turn off heat, add finishing hops
and steep for 15 minutes.  Cool, strain into fermenter, bring volume up to
5.5 gallons.  Pitch yeast.


***Notes***
Someone suggested I use Chinook hops, but my bottle of Pete's said that
it was made with Brewer's gold hops.  The o.g. was 1.050, f.g. was 1.015.
After two months in the bottle, a side by side comparison was made, and
I proudly proclaim that my beer comes close.  The chocolate flavor was
very fresh.  Others suggested dry-hopping, but I preferred the chocolatey
aroma to the beer in this case.

CEO file contents:  
Greetings, fellow HBDers!,
 
    Following Ulick S.'s recent request for more posts to the HBD,
I thought this might be a good time to submit my first post... I
hope you'll find my question amusing, if not challenging. 
    Last week I brewed, well, a beer. Kind of a leftover thingy...
After buying an 8 Kg (about 18 pounds for the metrically
challenged) bucket of Edme light LME at the incredible price of
30$ Cdn, and brewing a bitter and a brown ale two months ago, I
found myself with about 1.5 Kg (3.25#) of leftover malt. I also
found a beer kit can (Armstrong's Pilsner) that had been lying
around my basement for about 9 months. My wife, who was getting
tired of having this mostly empty bucket taking up a lot of room
in the fridge, suggested that I combine the beer kit can with the
leftover Edme LME to use up the old malt and make room in the
fridge... "No!" I cried out in complete horror! "I can't combine
English malt with a Pilsner kit! That would ruin the style!"...
But to no avail: she convinced me (she has quite a pretty smile
and can be very persuasive ;-) ). I wanted something 'German'
tasting, and this is the recipe I came up with:
 
For 5 US gallons:
 - 1 3.75# can of Armstrong's Pilsner beer kit (well hopped)
 - 3.25# of Edme light LME
 - 3/4# of Munich malt (steep in 150F water for 30 mins)
 - 1/2 oz of Hallertauer hop plugs (bittering at -60 min)
 - 1/2 oz of Saaz hop plugs (flavour at -15 mins)
 - 1/2 oz coriander at -7 mins (yes - I fell for that coriander
  thing. I brewed the day before Al K. mentioned that the whole
  thing was somewhat of a joke)
 - 1/2 oz of Hallertauer hop plugs (aroma at -2 mins)
 - Wyeast 1338 (European Ale yeast)


OG: 1048


   Here is my problem: I have no idea what style of beer this is!
Not bitter enough, too light colored and too hoppy for an Alt.
Can't be a lager of any kind because of the yeast I used... Would
someone be kind enough to help me out? If this is nothing else but
an 'Ale', how about helping me come up with an interesting name
for it? (I don't know... Leftover Ale? Empty the Fridge Brew?)

This seems to be a religious issue among homebrewers, but I'll throw in
my two cents.  I ferment 3-gallon batches in a 5-gallon carboy, with no
blow-off.  I used to use a 3-gallon carboy with blow-off, but switched
because I thought the head retention of my beers was suffering.


I don't know whether you lose much yeast using a blow-off, but I believe
you lose a lot of the proteins responsible for head retention.  The
krausen that forms on the top of the beer during fermentation is the
same stuff that makes the head on your finished beer.  During blow-off,
you lose a lot of krausen.


I have not noticed any detrimental effect on the flavor of the beer
since I made this change.  (I brew only ales, so the beer never sits on
the trub for more than two weeks; perhaps it takes longer for the off
flavors to develop.)  And though it may be just coincidence, my beers
have had better head retention since I stopped using a blow-off.  


I know most commercial brewers use blow-offs, but I wonder where the
hose is attached to the fermenter.  I suspect at the bottom, not the
top.  If that's so, this would mean that trub would get blown off,
rather than krausen.

Subject: Low S.G.


I attempted to brew a white beer this weekend, and am afraid that my mash 
didn't go too well.
The mash contained 4.5 lbs of German Pilsner, 4.0 lbs of unmalted wheat, 
and .5 lbs of oats.
Mashed in at 120F, rested for 20 minutes, converted at 150F for 1.5 
hours, and mashed out at 176F.


The reason I let the conversion go for so long was that it didn't look 
like anything was happening.  The sparge (5.5 gallons) went very 
quickly.  After boiling, etc. my SG was only 1.028.  


I'm pretty sure that I did not get good conversion.  Does anybody have an 
explanation... Was enzyme concentration too low? This is the first time I 
used the Phil Mill to crack the grains... The husks all looked cracked, 
but could it have left the inside to whole?  Any suggestions welcome.


Thanks

I've just purchased all the equipment necessary for kegging my homebrew,

that of bringing samples to club meetings, friends, etc.  Does anyone
know of a method whereby I can condition my beer in the keg, and then
use the keg to fill a limited number of bottles?  Common sense tells
me that if I just dispense to the bottle and cap it, I'll have problems.
I'd appreciate any response - the more detailed, the better.  Thanks

Subject: Old extract / persistent bubbles


Peter at BCIT asks about old cans of extract:


I wouldn't use them for beer, particularly not for a batch I cared about. Now,
if you were going to make a batch of generic non-descript beer for a party of
non-beer types, you might use it if you were willing to risk the time and
effort that it may or may not be very good. If the people who are drinking it
usually swill down Buttwipers/Miller/Coors/Molson Light, they might think it's
great even if it isn't your best effort. That'll have to be your call, of
course.


But here is a possible use for them--yeast starters. Boil up a can of this
stuff (with some hops), diluted to give you about 1.040 or so, and can/bottle
the wort. I don't go to the bother of canning jars and that process, although
it's said to be the preferred method. When I make a batch of starter wort to
put away for future use, I half-fill (okay, 1/2 to 2/3) sanitised 22 ounce
bottles and cap them. I keep them refrigerated, but that probably isn't
absolutely necessary, particularly if you "can" them. When I'm ready to get
some yeast going, I pull out a bottle of wort (far enough in advance to let it
warm to room temperature), flame the top of the bottle,and pour the wort and
the  yeast (either from the plastic vial it's sold in or yeast previously saved
from primary fermentation) into a sanitised 1/2 gallon bottle.  After aerating
it, I cover the mouth of the bottle with a few layers of foil


As for using _old_ extract, it ought to be okay for that purpose. But
look at/smell/taste the extract or the wort you make from it. If it seems off,
get rid of it.


 - - - - - - - - - -


Bruce at Virginia asks about the airlock that won't stop:


It's hard to know what to tell you without knowing more, but here are a
few things to consider.


1) What's the fermentation temperature? Warm liquids don't hold CO2 in
solution as well as cooler ones.


2) What's the gravity? Is it still pretty high or is it in the expected
range for a finishing gravity for the style you're brewing? If it's low
enough, go bottle it.


3) Do you have an infection or a wild yeast fermenting what should be
unfermentable? Does it taste/smell okay?


Other comments: don't follow instructions on a can of extract. Brew it right
instead! Don't use corn sugar in your beer unless you have a good reason to use
it. Use two cans of extract, or supplement it with some plain dry or liquid
extract.


Don't prime by putting a spoon of sugar in the bottle. Instead dissolve the
corn sugar in boiling water (I use 1/3 to 1/2 cup for a 4-5 gallon batch. 3/4
cup is typically recommended, but I find that too carbonated. YMMV.) and put
that in your bottling bucket as you begin to rack from secondary. You'll get
more consistent results.














Hope something here solves your mystery.


Now go have a beer,

Subject: Priming, blowoff


(From *Jeff* Renner)
There have been several questions lately about long bubbling secondaries, 
high FG, over/under priming, etc.  Let me offer my ideas.  First, batch 
priming is more precise than adding sugar to each bottle.  It does carry 
some risk of varying carbonation levels due to poorly mixed priming 
solution.  I boil my priming sugar or malt in a couple of cups of water 
and let it cool (covered, in a water bath sometimes) in an oversized 
container while I set up my siphoning and bottling equipment.  Then, 
mmidway through racking from my secondary to my priming container, I stop 
and siphon a few cups beer into the priming solution, then siphon this 
into the priming container, then finish racking.  This avoids much of the 
problem of thermal and density stratification.  Then I gently stir the 
primed beer.  You don't have to worry about oxidation.  The beer is 
probably giving off CO2 from the agitation and this blankets the 
surface.  Besides, O2 will be quickly metabolized by the yeast.


As far as waiting until the bubbles completely stop, don't bother unless 
you want to age the beer anyway (and I think there are advantages to this 
 -clearer beer being one).  Once a minute can go on forever.  Two causes 
that come to mind are (1)the slowly fermenting sugars that some extracts 
have (or some mashes produce), and (2)wild yeasts that may slowly ferment 
some complex sugars.  Either way, you may want to cut down on your 
priming sugars if you expect to keep these beers a long time.  Over time, 
they will become drier and more carbonated.  Unless your bottles are 
weakened from abuse, the worst that will happen is gushing.


Adam Rich mentions a Laaglander beer that has stopped at 1020.  This is 
typ[ical of this extract.  It is good as part of a recipe for increasing 
final gravity/residual sweetness, but if used 100%, you may get an 
unbalanced beer. 


Eric Jaquay primed with a cup of blackstrap molasses and hates the 
flavor.  IMO, blackstrap tastes like what it is, the waste product of 
sugar refining.  If you have to use molasses, use one of the milder 
types, and a lot less than a cup.  Good luck with the flavor going away.  
I think you are in a better position to find out if it does than anyone 
else.
****
About blowoff.  I like it.  I think it may reduce my bittering slightly, 
but it seems to result in cleaner tasting, smoother beers.  I like to 
adjust my final volume in the primary so that I get less than a cup of 
lost beer.  Most of the brown residue sticks to the top of the carboy
or Sankey.  Soakiong in bleach removes this.  By using a one inch hose in 
the neck of a carboy, I eliminate 
any danger of clog and explosions.  Potential clogs are from whole hops.  
When I ferment in a Sankey, I attach a small hose to the stopper with a 
short piece of broken racking tube and make sure I havent siphoned any 
large hop pieces.  Cleaning a large hope can be done with a carboy brush, 
but I alway soak either size in bleach water.  They always seem clean.  
Then I boil them before reuse.

Just a nit, but while there is some trub in the bottom of the primary, 
we are a lot more interested in yeast.  Some wash the trub away using
"sterile" water or acid.

Which leads to more yeast cells and a faster healthier fermentation. It

The classic approach is to step up in 10-1 increments.  So a Wyeast pack of
50 Ml should be stepped into 500 ml.  This will result in more yeast cells
per volume of sugar, which gives quicker growth/ferment.  I dont see a big
difference in doing a 20-1 step with 50 ml.

I dont want to beat this dead horse too much, but I do want to emphasize
that you absolutely have to have a O2 regulator on your tank.  Once you
have this, it is as easy as a CO2 tank to control.  These regs do come in 
both psi scales for welding and Litres/min for flow rates.


Al asks about stoves for brewing.  This is something I have been looking
into.  Many people I have asked like the Superb, produces 35K.  I use a
burner I fabricated out of a line of burners from Solarflow in Ohio. I
have also used cajun cookers but the deflector plate is important in 
heat control as is a lot of stirring when mashing.

1994 THIRSTY Homebrew Competition Results


     On November 19th, 1994, The Honorable Iowa River Society of Talented
Yeastmasters (THIRSTY) held its first AHA sanctioned homebrew competition.
Homebrewers from 9 states entered 104 beers or meads in the 14 style
categories.  Best of Show was awarded to Dennis Davison of CBS for his
Still Sweet Cyser.  His prize was a $50 gift certificate from the Home Brew
Shop in Coralville, Iowa; a plaque; and a free entry into the first round
of the 1995 AHA national competition.  The Best of Show runner-up was Steve
Solik from San Jose, CA.  He also received a gift certificate from the Home
Brew Shop and a plaque.  Third place Best of Show was awarded to Ed Wolfe
and Carol Liguori of THIRSTY.

Since buttered toast always lands butter side down, and cats always land on 
their feet if you were sure that the toast was butter side up on top of the 
cat, you will have solved the perpetual motion question.  My guess is the cat 
and toast combination would just spin, hovering gently above the floor.  Have a

Timothy Laatsch (campus is probably getting chilly by now, isn't it?
Been away a while now...) reports uneven priming.  


To mix my priming solution, I rack from the secondary into a
bottling vessel and pour the still-hot priming solution down the
siphon tube (as you would pour down a glass rod in chem lab) in the
early stages of racking.  This limits aeration and thermal shock
while promoting thorough mixing.

No rebuttal, just a remark that an experiment I did and described about a year
ago in the HBD, supports your line of thought.  I pitched my yeast starter into
a 6 1/2 gallon batch of SG 1.041 Special Bitter, then racked into two 5 gallon
carboys, filling one to about 3 inches from the top.  Active fermentation was
visible in both batches after about 10 hours and the filled batch began blowing
off after 12 hours.  After 10 days (66F) the non-blowoff batch was finished 
with a SG of 1.011, while the blowoff batch was still at 1.020.  I bottled the
non-blowoff batch and reracked the blowoff batch and let it sit in secondary
for another 10 days, then bottled with a FG=1.013.  As far as "bad hop oils"
there was only negligable differences in the two beers - some preferred the
blowoff batch, others the non-blowoff batch, while I really couldn't tell the
difference.  Since then I have always used my 7 gallon carboy for primary and
will use a blowoff hose if I either fill it with more than 6 gallons or have a
high gravity wort.  On the other hand, I feel the risk of infection using a
blowoff is minimal, especially if your blowoff hose is soaked in a sanitizing
solution (no need to rinse).  Also, despite the longer ferment time, using a
blowoff didn't hurt the beer either.

Subject: bulging extract cans


You should never purchase bulging cans of extract syrup or other types of
bulging containers with extract syrup.  You should get them for free!  The
cause of the bulging is a wild yeast that was picked up during processing.
>From what I understand, the store owner can remove the label or other
packing information and get reimbursed from the manufacturer.  This summer
I managed to get two 6 lb packages of syrup that were bulging free. The first
I put in the refrigerator and the next morning the soft container was still
growing so I through it in the freezer that stopped the yeast cold.  I used
that pack in a stout and don't taste anything unusual.  The second package
unfortunately didn't make it to fermentation, since the carboy full of fresh
wort decided the gravitational pull was too strong and turned into a slippery
eel just before crashing on the garage floor like a giant pumpkin spewing
its sweet honey all over the floor.   It was ugly and what I missed was sticky
the next day.  Oh well, live and learn.

Subject: All grain process




Here is my all grain brewing process. I use this process for probably
80% of my brewing. Total brew time is about 3 to 3.5 hours with a break
in there for the mash. I realize there are probably lots of ways to
improve this, but with this system I can turn out very good all grain
ales or lagers quickly. I can even brew after work and be done in time
to put the kids to bed.


Materials:
5 gallon SS pot
8 gallon ceramic on steel pot
zap-pap lauter tun
long SS spoon
Thermometer
1/2 gallon glass measuring bowl
6 gallon plastic primary
5 gallon carboy
10" strainer


Add mash water to 5 gallon SS pot and bring it up to strike temperature.
This is dependent on the recipe. Add the grains and add heat if
necessary to bring it up to mash temperature. I usually mash at about
145 deg F. Wrap the ss pot in an old sleeping bag and go away and do 
something else. I start the mash sometimes before I go to bed at night 
to brew in the morning, or I come home at lunch and start the mash for 
an evenings brew session.


When I am really ready to get brewing, I put the mash back on the stove
and raise the temperature to about 150-155 and wrap back up in the
sleeping bag.


Fill the 8 gallon pot with sparge water and bring to a boil. Once the
sparge water is boiling carefully ladle the mash into the Zap-Pap and
add sparge water to cover the grain by 3-4 inches. Transfer the sparge
water to the 4 gallon pot and put the 8 gallon back on the stove. (my 8
gallon pot almost covers 2 burners). The Zap-Pap sits on a stool and the
1/2 gallon measuring bowl sits on the floor. Recirculate about 1 gallon
and then start carefully pouring into the 8 gallon pot. 


Turn on the heat once there is about 1" of wort in the pot. If you go
slow the boil should be going when the pot is about 1/2 full. Shut off
the sparge after each bowl-full until the wort is boiling again. By the
end of the sparge the wort has already boiled down about 1/2 gallon and
half your boil is already done.


Boil for an hour. During the boil is a good time to clean everything
from the mash. 


Near the end of the boil I start the sanatizing of the primary. 


At 5 minutes before the end of the boil I plop the chiller in to
sanitize. When the boil is done I run the hose from the back yard into
the kitchen and hook it to the chiller. Chill for about 25 minutes.


Put the strainer on top of the primary and pour the wort through the
strainer. This does a great job of aerating, but a lot of the break
material ends up in the primary.


pitch the yeast, clean up the boil pot,  and you are done for the day.


I transfer to the secondary after 2 days or whenever the foam falls back
into the beer.


That is my process. I realize there are lots of areas where HSA is a
risk, but I have found that if I am careful HSA is not a problem. I
have to splash a lot for HSA to be noticible. The benefits of this is it
is quick and easy, and it doesn't take any expensive equipment. With the
long mash the flavor profile is kind of a crap shoot, but I like it that
way. When I am brewing "to style" I am a lot more careful about temp
profiles and mash times.

There is a direct relationship between temperature, CO2 pressure and
volumes of dissolved CO2 in your beer.  The best discussion of this
relationship (as well as explainations of how to adjust your hose
lengths for a given pressure) that I've seen is in the 1992 AHA
National Conference Proceedings, in Dave Miller's section.  I believe
that some of this information may be in the kegging FAQ -- see the
header of HBD to find out how to get the FAQs.  You do not have to
increase and decrease your pressure if you have your hose lengths and
diameters correct for the pressure you are using.  25 psi was probably
too high a pressure for the temperature you had and the volumes of CO2
you wanted, but the foaming had to do with not enough backpressure from
the hose/faucet.  I store my ales at 54F, have a 6-foot, 3/16"ID beer
hose, ending in a Cobra tap and I believe that my regulator was set to
12psi (currently, I'm using my CO2 tank for something else and had to
change the setting).

You can use it, but I suspect that it will be quite oxidized unless it was
stored at near-freezing temps.  I regularly use old extract (stuff that has
gotten too old to sell), but just for swilling beer -- nothing that I would
serve to friends or enter in a competition.  The resulting beer is darker
than normal for that extract and has a sort of nutty/sherrylike flavour due
to the oxidation.

It sounds like either the extract you used was deficient in nutrients (corn
sugar has no nutrients), you did not aerate your cooled wort enough, you
used a very old, weak yeast or some combination of the above.  I'm assuming,
of course, that you are not trying to ferment this "ale" at 50F.  Actually,
some ale yeasts (like the popular Wyeast American Ale) get sluggish at
temperatures below 63F.  I usually bottle when the airlock rate is down to
about 1 bubble every 2 minutes, which takes about 1 to 2 weeks depending on
the yeast, OG and temperature.  It's hard to say if your batch is done (a
hydrometer measurement would help, but only if you know the expected terminal
gravity -- some extracts are not very fermentable and unfamiliar brewers
are fooled by the high FG).  If the majority of the fermentation was
done in the first week, but then there was a three-week period of slow
fermentation, then I would guess that you could bottle now (has the beer
cleared, i.e. has the yeast settled out?).  If the ferment never quite got
going, then you should probably buy a hydrometer take a reading, and send
me email.


If the ferment is stuck due to poor nutrition, then you can make up a good,
well-aerated, 2 quart starter with some dry extract, maybe a small amount of
yeast nutrient and more yeast.  Once this ferments-out, dump it into the
primary and let this yeast finish the sugars in your wort (you can pour off
the spent starter if you don't have room for it).  The only ways of knowing
which extracts are high in FAN and which are not are either experience or
there is an article in the next issue of Zymurgy which does give the FAN
for a number of popular extracts.


If the ferment is stuck due to underaeration or due to an old or lame yeast,
then use the same solution as for poor nutrition, but you can probably skip
the nutrient.

I don't recommend priming each bottle, nor should you add any more or less
priming sugar.  I recommend siphoning the finished beer into another,
sanitized container which contains all the priming sugar (1/2 to 3/4 cup
of corn sugar, boiled a few minutes in a cup or two of water) and then
siphon into bottles after stirring gently.  Incidentally, I don't believe
there is any physical benfit from using dried malt extract for priming
and corn sugar is considerably more easy to use.

Subject: New Brewer Questions


I am going to got out this weekend and buy the materials for my first 
homebrew and I have a couple of questions and would appreciate any help you 
may provide.


1)  Charlie uses a glass carboy as a fermentation vessel, yet the Brewers
Resource sells beginner kits with 5 gallon plastic buckets for 
fermentation.  Which should I use/buy?


2)  When people use the 5 gallon buckets, do they have a blow-off tube into 
a milk jug or do they just leave the fermentation foam (krausen?) in the 
bucket?  I read that it is a good idea to have this bubble out to get 
rid of some nasty off flavors.


Thanks for any help,

T>Kit,


T>Glad to hear that there actually are women brewers in our midst.  I
T>would like you to know however, not all of us Male brewing types
T>have Significant others to clean up after us...  Actually most of
T>the Brewers I know are single and they all clean up their own
T>messes.   


T>Now, I'll explain why we are single:


T>A.)  Most women don't get it when it comes to brewing males!  The
T>passion, the quest,  the reward :-).
T>B.)  We drink a lot of beer and not many women like that.  
T>C.)  We usually brew 2 times a week,  not much time for anything
T>else ( well, ok, we might make time for some things. :-))
T>D.)  We like to tinker with brewing stuff - books, tools, new stuff,
T>spigots, chillers, kegs, and the like.  So that takes another
T>        hunk of our time.




T>So, if you know any eligible female type person, I won't even
T>include the brewing thing in this one, that actually can stand to be
T>around somebody like this,  I have lots of eligible MAN friends that
T>would love to be appreciated for these noble traits!  


T>One thing we don't enjoy: is being told that our beer is too big,
T>too hoppy on occasion, and too flavorful.  By the way,  I have been
T>told this b4.  


T>We also don't want to hear: why don't you make a light beer?  A true
T>Brewer loves all styles,  from Pilsner to Imperial Stout,  and
T>will usually make beers for the season -- I know I probably just
T>insulted somebody, but hey, WE BREW THEREFOR WE ARE BREWERS ;-).


T>Well that's my 2cents.


T>Hoppy Brewing!

I wanted to post this response following the Brewsters' article. Maybe 
the HBD needs to have a personals section.

SWM 40-something homebrewer, "portly", balding, seeks SWF 
early 20's, athletic build, who likes televised sports
and washing bottles. Send picture of wort chiller.

I also wanted to say that (1)the Brewsters' article is a repost, (2)I 
did not write it, (3)and I am not female. With an androgenous name 
like "Kit" it is  a 50/50 shot in cyberspace. It does make for a lot 
of propositions from both sides of the aisle when in Chat mode.
