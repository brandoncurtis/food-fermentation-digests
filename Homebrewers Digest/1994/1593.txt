Yeah, I know 1577 was two weeks ago, I just got around to reading it. 
Anyway, I don't want a label that I have to clean off, we all know how it
hard it was to wash the commercial labels off the bottle.  And I know the
milk trick kind of thing.


What I do to label my batches is to keep a log and number the batch.   I have
some self-adhesive circles from the stationery store(I hate those mobile
stores!) bottle the brew,  and number the circles and stick it to the bottle
cap.  I can open a case and see the numbers of the batch.  Then I know that
14 is a Brown Beer, and 15 is a Stout.  I can go back to the log to see the
recipe, the date of brewing, bottling, etc.  Best of all is the cleanup;  the
label goes in the trash with the used cap.

Rich Scotty asks about brewing without wheat, rye or barley.


One of my customers has a similar problem (or rather his father-in-law 
does). He cannot consume wheat, barley, oats or rye. The new Papazian 
book talks about using spelt (an ancient wheat) but that is out as well. 


Over the past weekend I tasted the results of his first batch and it was
pretty good. He malted both quinoa and buckwheat were malted, but the
quinoa because it was deemed to have a more "malty" taste. Also mashed
were some lentils, flaked corn and flax. The end result looked very much
like a wheat beer and had a beautiful head. The balance was off, though,
because there was very little malt to back up the hops. Version two is
underway with only quinoa and corn and about an ounce of 2.7% Liberty. I
will let you know how it turns out. 


I should mention that this was all done by a guy who had *never* brewed 
before at all. Not only was his first batch all-grain -- he had to malt 
the grains as well!

Here are some reasons for all the fuss:


1. Hot break trub may interfere with fermentation (De Clerck, 1957, cites some
   examples where yeast doesn't reach its full attenuation in the presence of
   hot break, he suggests the cells starve prematurely because they get
   coated with protein).


2. Hot break trub contains most of the heavy metals dissolved from taps and
   equipment (De Clerck, 1957).


3. Many brewers experience that, especially in slowly fermenting beer, the
   break material causes harsh off-flavours that require a long period of
   'mellowing out' (if they disappear at all).


4. When a lot of cold break is present during fermentation the beer often is
   also susceptible to chill-haze formation.


Note, however, that a small amount of cold break is favourable for the
initial yeast multiplication stage (probably because there is some
dissolved nitrogenous stuff associated with it).

Well, what I do is educate them about brewing!  Ive got a 2 year old, and 
a 5 year old who comes over to visit all the time.  I dont have a kegging 
system however, Ive got fermentors and bottles and such which are just as 
easily accessable.  Id suggest just telling them its "Ickys" or could 
give them an "Owie".  That usualy does it for my kid.  You said it was in 
your living room, Im assuming you have a bar down there.  One of those 
"Kiddie Gates" in front of the bar might do it as well.  


In either case, I wouldnt worry about it too much unless your kids are 
constantly over by the fridge.  My 2 year old thinks a bubbling airlock 
is the neatest thing in the world to watch.  However, he likes to grab it 
also and try to rip it off the bucket and make it his new friend for the 
day.  Usualy just telling him no, and saying "owie" does the trick.  A 1 
year old would be more difficult, but shouldnt be able to reach a tapper 
on a fridge anyhow (Unless youre a midget and have the tapper mounted 
extremely low on your fridge).


As far as drinking it, ive found that kids dont like beer till much later 
in life, the 5 year old cant stand the smell of beer.  The 2 year old 
asks for Beers all the time, but once he smells it says "Icky" and wont 
touch it.  Id be more worried about a mess than toddlers tee todleing on 
their own.

Subject: Party Pig


My wife is looking for a good xmas gift for me, and I offhandedly 
mentioned to her that a party pig might be appropriate.  We live
in a small apartment, so I don't have room for a keg refrigerator,
but I would enjoy kegging some of my beer, since it's nice to be
able to pour a big liter glass if I feel like it, and we all know
what a pain in the ass bottling is.  I have a few specific questions
for people who have experience with the pig system, in hopes of
determining if it would be worth really asking for in earnest.


1. How much does a pig hold?  ie can I keg a couple of gallons
   and bottle the rest, so I can still give it to family and friends?


2. Does a pig fit in a standard apartment refrigerator?  Our 
   refrigerator usually has enough room for a box of cheap 
   wine and a couple of gallons of milk.


3. How does the difficulty of cleaning and filling the pig compare
   with an equivalent volume of bottles?  


4. How much do they cost?


5. Are you happy with this system, and would you reccomend it for
   an intermediate level homebrewer (partial mashes, moving toward
   all grain)?


TIA for any help you can give me.  Private email or post to the digest
is fine, but if you email me, I'll post a summary in a few days.  I 
think this could be a topic of some interest, since it's Christmas time
and all.  Hoppy brewing.

 Pierre Jelenc writes that he has had trouble working with Malta...


I have had the same problem.  I used one bottle of Malta and pitched one
packet of rehydrated Lallemand dry yeast (No time to use liquid).


The starter was weakly working in 24 hours, when I pitched it, and the lag
time for the beer was ANOTHER 24 hours.
  Another problem is that, after the beer fermented out, I had a FG of
1.016, ersus the 1.010 I usually would get with the recipe I was brewing.
I also have a slight phenolic taste to the beer, but its just finished in the
primary, so the jury is still out on that.


My guess is that the high amount of sugar (glucose, I presume) in the Malta
induced the "Crabtree effect" and caused poor attenuation.


The label on the bottle of Malta Goya that I had said nothing about
preservatives, but I have to imagine that there must be something in there
that inhibited yeast growth.


Needless to say, my experiments with Malta Goya have ended and I dont think
Ill use it again unless othere people report good results.

DISCLAIMER:  I AM NOT A CHEMIST, AND I'VE NEVER PLAYED ONE ON TV.


Having said that, here in the Northeast we are blessed with the softest water
this side of Pilsen.  No hassles with having to boil out the precipitate; no
scale buildup on our brewing equipment; being able to emulate other water styles
simply by adding stuff; plus being able to brew genuine Bohemian-style
pilseners.  Happy, happy!  Joy, joy!


One of the problems with soft water, however, is being able to sufficiently
acidify the mash to the point where the enzymes are happy doing their thing.
The protease enzymes that break long-chained proteins down into medium-chained
proteins, improving head retention, do their best work when the pH is less
than 5.2.  Soft water just does not have enough free cations to accomplish this
unassisted.  The Czechs got around this problem by adding a three hour acid
rest to their mash cycle.  Fortunately, modern science provides us with an
easier method:  Calcium!


My hand-waving understanding of the process is as follows.  Calcium (Ca+2) ions
react with phosphate ions naturally present in the mash, releasing hydrogen
ions (H+) into solution and acidifying the mash.  Calcium may be added to the
mash in the form of gypsum (calcium sulfate).  Adding 1/2 gram of gypsum per
gallon of mash water will add 31ppm calcium and 74ppm sulfate into solution.
Do this before you dough-in the grain so that the mash has a chance to acidify
prior to doing the protein rest.  If you don't have a gram scale, then one level
teaspoon may be approximately equated with 5 grams of gypsum.


On a side note, those British draught ales are not flat as a result of brewing
with soft water.  On the contrary, southern England has some of the most
carbonate drinking water in the known world.  British taste simply prefers that
the flavor come from the beer itself, not from the gas.


I must also say that the recent threads on such things as denatured foam and
wort aeration make for much more interesting reading than copyright flame wars.
Keep up the quality postings!

Has Steve Armbrust of that other Portland (the one in Oregon, or as the locals

remember a recipe, is it an inside joke, or is it something about that Oregon
water that makes so many wonderful commercial craft beers but plays havoc with
the homebrews???


Steve offered a recipe from many years ago for a Grant's Imperial Stout clone
that started with the following ingredients:


TWO 3.3 pound cans of dark extract
TWO 4 pound cans of pale extrace
3 pounds of dark DME
1 pound of clover honey


One HUGE beer, right?  Nope, O.G. said to be only 1.075.
Now 1.075 is a pretty big beer, but almost 19 pounds of fermentables in five
gallons is going to give you just a touch more than a 1.075 gravity.


I'd almost believe it with only ONE can each of the canned extracts.


Must be that special gravity reducing water, eh? :-)


Now go have a beer,

Subject: Suck-back and PET


Season's greetings;
Recent discussions on problems with fluid from airlocks being sucked into 
the beer have avoided the one failproof solution.  Blowoff! Even if you 
don't want to use blowoff, set up the system for the first day or  the 
first  few hours after putting yoiur wort into the fermenter until the 
temperature reaches proper pitching temperature (however you may do it).  
If your blowoff hose is reaching from the top of the carboy to a 
container on the floor ( or at the base  of the carboy) and that end 
immersed in an inch of sanitized solution, youi will not get suck-back.  
The distance to pull the solution up the blowoff hose is  too great for 
the negative pressures that  would be built  up in your fermenter.  When the 
temperature has colled, either leave the system in place or  replace it 
with an airlock it if you're really worried about it.  In a sense you are 
making an airlock anyway.
  With regards th PET bottles, I've been using all sorts of plastic 
bottles for the past two years or so and have never had a problem.  I've 
used and re-used bottles from commercial beers (Wellington, Connors (when 
they had them), Well's) and from commercial soft  drinks (Coke, pepsi, 
no-name, etc).  You just have  to  do one thing when you fill them-- when 
you've got 1-1.5 inches of airspace in the top, stop filling, squeeze the 
bottle until  the beer comes to the very top, hold that position and put 
the cap on.  As the beer carbonates it allows the bottle to pop back into 
position ( you can hear it) and by feeling how  hard the bottles are you 
can tell when there is full carbonation pressure.  This prevents too much 
pressure buildup in the bottle.  I sometimes bottle exclusively with 
2-litre bottles, as I only have to wash 9 or 10 bottles instead of two 
cases for a 5-gallon batch.  Also, the little bumps on the bottom of the 
bottles are great for collecting the sediment and keeping it in place 
when pouring into a jug (very little waste, itf you're concerned about 
drinking the sediment).
  Sorry about the long-windedness but we're here to discuss, aren't we?

It is too bad that Yankee Brew News reported on a version of

This is very interesting and if your stirring produced foam may have
application to proteins in beer.  So, the question is, did the stirring
produce foam?


Also, it's a great experiment to try on beer.  Run a gel on the beer to get
a MW profile before agitation, then take samples every couple hours during
agitation.  Thanks.

The main chain bonds in proteins are -C-C-N-C-C-N-, and forgive me, but
the main chain bond in polystyrene is -C-C-.  The monomer is -CH2-CH(C6H5)-.

     WHOA!  I would suggest checking with your local ACE hardware store.  My

Mike (MFOR8178`at`URIACC.URI.EDU) asks about PET (2l plastic) and champagne
bottles.  Both will work just fine for beer.


While I don't use PET bottles for beer, I do use them for homemade soda
pop, which is even more highly carbonated than beer.  They can easily
hold the pressure.  Next time you buy some pop, thwack the bottle before
you open it -- those things are rock hard.  I've even heard stories
about folks driving over them with with cars without the integrity
giving.  PET is oxygen permeable, however (anyone know by how much?), so
you might not want to use it for beers you intend to lay down for long
periods.


If you want to use champagne bottles (also nice and strong, and won't
pass O2) that will fit standard bottle caps, get American "champagne"
bottles like Totts, Cook's, etc.  Imports have a wider lip that won't
work.

 Just a note of interest.  Yesterday I was in a grocery store in a small
 rural town in AL.  As I passed through the syrup section my eye was caught
 by the word MALT on a can.  There were many 1kg cans of Premier light
 hopped malt extract!, complete with the yeast packet and the ususal
 instructions to add a few tons of sugar etc.  The point being malt extract
 on the shelves of the grocery store in a prohibition state!  I asked the
 clerk about how long those cans (~18) had been there.  He said that they
 sell about a case (24) every month.  $3.46 for a 2.2lb can didn't seem to
 bad to me.

This is a project that has been going on for some time.  As I understand
it, the taste test may involve several different brews not all of which are
custom for Jack Daniels.  The beers are being brewed at Evansville Brewing,
Evansville Indiana.  I have tried several of their brews, including one
that was reportedly done for Jack Daniels.  They were typical, mainstream,
megaswill beers with no real character except for the faint house flavor
that all Evansville beers have from their yeast.  BTW, I was told that they
use the same yeast strain for every brew, so, at best, Jack Daniels Beer
will differ only in grain bill from other Evansville products, and then
only slightly.


Regarding "small batches", the minimum effective Evansville brewlength is
375 bbls.  As to the "turn-of-the-century" bit, calling it 1986 Classic
would be closer to the truth than 1866....  On a positive note, this is a
marketing beer that may draw some of the fire away from Boston Beer Co.

          Hello all!


     Stan White asked about ideas for a beer tasting dinner a few issues

and I served only our own homebrew and one "homewine".


     Here's the menu:

an extremely enjoyable meal and evening.


     In HBD #1591, Rich asked about a non-wheat, barley, and rye beer to

in the country of Kenya in eastern Africa for a couple of weeks and had the
opportunity to try Guiness Stout (bottled). Having not yet begun my brewing
adventures at that time, I could only compare it to the Guiness I've had
here in the States. The result?.....I enjoyed it very much! It was not a
watered down version, nor were there any strange off flavors from the
original. As to whether or not it is actually brewed with sorghum, I do not
know for sure. If it is, that may be your answer to an allergy-friendly

Subject: racking to secondary


I've read here where aeration during fermenation is bad.  I forgot why it is
bad,
but I've basically avoided it.


My question is about racking to the secondary.  Is aeration at this point also
bad?  Recent articles in Brewing Techniques have described a closed system where
beer is racked under CO2 pressure so it never contacts air after fermentation
begins.  This idea implies that there is nothing bad about NOT aerating in the
secondary.  It would be easy for me to fill the secondary carboy with CO2 before
I siphon, thus keeping almost all air out.


Thanks for your opinions.

I have not used every brand of these "100% natural fruit extracts" but of
the ones that I have tried, I have been very disappointed.  Once you get
enough of the extract into the beer to impart the proper (to my taste)
amount of fruit flavor/aroma, the beer begins to taste overly bitter and
slightly medicinal.  I tried two varieties and many different concentrations.
I even tried aging it a few weeks, but that did not help.


I've read good things about these extracts from some users and bad things
from others, but I personally have not been able to make a decent fruit
beer with them.

I too have noticed this.  It took about 6 or 9 months for one batch of
real fruit (raspberry/cherry) ale to overcarbonate.  I suspect that I
got a little wild yeast or bacteria in there with the fruit.  So little
that it took a long time to become noticable.  I don't think that the
primary fermentation yeast would take so long to overcarbonate (i.e. I
don't think it's the primary yeast eating bigger sugars).  I know that
most (all?) bacteria don't produce CO2, but I theorize that they contribute
to overcarbonation because they can break bonds in dextrins that result
in smaller sugars which are subsequently eaten by the primary yeast.


*********
Someone (sorry), a few days ago, wrote some temperatures along with
their importance.  It was something on the order of "above 140F you
get the effects of Hot Side Aeration (HSA), between 140F and 95F you have
the risk of infection, etc."  I believe this person had some of the
numbers mixed up.


The only brewing-related things I can think of associated with 140F
are:


1. it is the high end of the protein rest range -- the end that favors
small protein formation over amino acid formation, and


2. the temperature above which SMM (S-methyl methionine) is converted
to DMS (dimethyl sulfide) -- so, minimizing the time spent between boil
and 140F is primarily to reduce the production of DMS that could spill-over
into the final beer.


Also, regarding HSA, the commonly accepted temperature above which it
is not recommended to introduce air/oxygen is 80F, not 140F.


********
I don't know if this is what started this recent head retention thread, but
Andy wrote:

My opinion on this (based on several experiments) is that there is no
noticable effect on head retention due to using blowoff versus not using
blowoff.

From: Martin Snow <SNOW`at`lyrae.colorado.edu>
Subject: Liquid Yeast


It is commonly said that the easiest way for a beginner to improve his or her
homebrew is to switch to liquid yeast.  It's my opinion that this is only
partially true.  Using liquid yeast cultures without making a starter will
result in beer that is about the same as that produced using a dry yeast.


My first experiment with liquid yeast was pretty disapointing.  I made a brown
ale using Wyeast European Ale culture which was supposed to leave a very
malty taste.  Like many others, I thought that using a starter was only 
for the purpose of getting fermentation started sooner.  Since I have never
had much of a problem with slow starts, I thought the starter culture could
be skipped.  I had a few bottles from a previous batch using the same recipe 
except for the Munton & Fison (dry) ale yeast on hand for comparison.  The
two were pretty similar, although the batch made with dry yeast was a little
more watery than the fresher batch, but otherwise not much different.  
I thought the gains from liquid yeast were rather overhyped.


But I wanted to make sure, so a few batches later, I made a Pale Ale using
the Wyeast American Ale culture.  This time, I thought I'd try making a
starter first.  The result was a smooth, wonderful ale.  The companion
batch made with Edme dry yeast now seemed harsh by comparison.  I was now
hooked on liquid yeast (so to speak).


Not realizing the importance of the starter, I later made a batch of Wee Heavy
from a kit sold by St. Patrick's.  Their catalog indicated that a starter
wasn't really necessary for a Wyeast foil pack, so I just poured the swolen
packet into the fermenter.  The resulting ale has lots of subtle off-flavors
which I now blame on the lack of a starter.


With that bit of history, I'm now trying to determine the relationship between
starter size and flavor.  According to Noonan's book on Scotch Ale, a larger
starter reduces the amount of esters produced by the yeast.  TNCJOH doesn't
mention anything about starter size, nor does the yeast FAQ.  I don't recall
anything in Miller's book either.  Has anyone done systematic research on
how the size of the initial yeast population affects the final product?
My own (anecdotal) evidence indicates that a 2 quart starter for a 5 gallon
batch makes a huge improvement in flavor.


So the old saying that liquid yeasts will improve your brew is only true if
you make a starter.  If you don't make a starter culture, you might as well
use a dry yeast.

Subject: carbonation revisited


Hi,


I've gotten a few private responses to my posting about
lack of carbonation in my beer and it would seem a 
little clarification is in order.  Originally I asked if the
lack of additives to condition the very soft Northwest
water might be a the problem since the water is the only
different variable I can identify between my present and
former residences.


First, my beer is flat - there is some stirring of bubbles
on the surface when the brew is poured, but no head
formation.  This has been consisent through 10 or so
batches over the two years.   I do have one exception 
 - an outrageously good and creamy Oatmeal Stout that 
forms a thin, but brief head.  Generally, I make cream 
and heavier pale ales, so don't have the advantage of 
lots of additional malts and other grains as in my Stout.
I have tried using crystal malts in greater quantities as 
well. I brew outside in a 9 gallon pot, both full grains and 
extracts, and generally use liquid Ale Yeasts.  Occasionally
I culture yeast from other brews to make specialty beers 
like Trappist or IPA's.  For cooling, I use a counterflow copper 
tube device.  I ferment the primary in plastic and 
the secondary in glass, usually bottling within 2-4 weeks,
depending on time and fermentation.  


As a few people mentioned, the storage area is on the
cool side - it probably never gets above 65 degrees
during the spring/fall/winter.  Actually, this is a
characteristic of my house in general.  I do most of 
my brewing in the fall and winter, and have to put the 
carboys near the wood stove to get warm enough
for active fermentation.


I generally carbonate with 2/3 to 3/4 cup corn sugar, 
and have also tried larger quantities of dry malt extract
1 - 1 1/2 cups.  I purchase most of my ingredients
through Williams Brewing in California, except the hops,
which are purchased locally. 


Help!
