Mark implies that beer integrity may be more a function of using a good
starter than of using liquid yeast in place of dry yeast.  I just wanted
to follow-up with a data point ... I commonly use the dregs of the primary
fermenter to ferment future batchs.  I've done this on several occasions,
using dry yeasts as the initial starter medium.  This results in a
significant yeast starter for subsequent batchs.  I always felt that the
subsequent batches where superior ... but I wasn't sure to credit it to
the large yeast starter or some type of yeast adaptation (... wondering
if the dregs of the first batch could now be considered "liquid" yeast?).

Subject:  Newbie in need help


I'm a new homebrewer and I have a question about my most recent
brew.  I bought a cherry beer (canned hopped malt extract), at
the advice of the person at my local beer supply store I used
"Kicker Malt Extract" in addition to the canned extract, and dry
yeast (that I rehydrated) that came with the canned extract.  


Everything seemed to go o.k. and the O.G. was 1.048.  This was
four days ago and I have seen no action in my "S" airlock, not
even off-placed water levels.  Yesterday I checked the gravity of
the wort and even though there has been no bubbling, the level is
down to 1.014.  Is it possible that fermentation occurred without
me realizing it?  Does a lower hydrometer reading necessarily
mean that fermentation is/has occurred?  Should I keep taking
hydrometer readings until it levels off, or should I scrap the
batch and try again?


Any suggestions or input would be most appreciated.

Hi All,


In HBD#1595, Joe McCarthy writes:

Can't comment on #2278, never used it. I have used the 2206 to brew all
those styles, with good results.  It produces a malty character in the
beer which is appropriate for those styles, so it's certainly possible
for a single yeast strain to work for all three.

May I ask at what temperature primary fermentation was conducted?? I'd
attribute fruitiness more to high primary fermentation temperatures than
high final gravities. 1.026 is not a horribly high FG for a Maibock, but
along with the fruitiness, it may be a sign that you underpitched or
under aerated.


I've brewed two batches of bock, both ~1.070 OG, used 2206 and fermented
them at 45F - 48F, no problems with fruitiness. In both cases, I grew
the starter over the course of two weeks at pitching temperatures, and
pitched several ounces of slurry. IMHO, high pitching rates and good
aeration are key to successful high gravity fermentations. It's also
important to grow starters for lagers at or near pitching temperature.


BTW, I believe 2206 is a strain recommended by Darryl Richman is his
Classic style series book on bock.

Last fall, I brewed a 1.070 bock and a 1.063 Ofest with #2124 Bohemian,
both had some fruitiness despite being fermented cold. I've used the #2124
with good success for Bohemian pilsners, and wouldn't hesitate to use it
for a pilsner. There is a big difference between a 1.048 pils and a 1.070
bock, though.


Hope this is helpful,

Subject: sparging and aeration


   A lot of recent discussion has led me to question something I've
been doing consistently over my two years of extract brewing.  I
don't understand all the chemistry involved (and frankly don't
really wish to), but would appreciate hearing some opinions on
this simple how-to question:
   I follow the typical procedure of boiling my extract and hops
in about 1.5 gallons of water, and sparging into a plastic primary
fermenter containing enough cold water to bring the final volume
to 5 gallons.  Usually I immerse the cookpot in an ice-water bath
for 5-10 minutes first, which cools the wort just enough so that
the resulting solution in the fermenter winds up to be just about
the right temperature for pitching.  Now here's the question:  I
typically just pick up the cookpot and, after drying the outside
(to prevent any of the ice water from dripping into the fermenter),
dump the wort through my (sanitized) strainer into the fermenter.
The pour is often rather violent and results in lots of splashing,
which I assumed was desirable aeration-wise even though it makes
a bit of a mess.
   My question is whether this really IS desirable, considering
that the wort, though cooled somewhat from the ice bath, is
still probably 150 degrees F. or so.  Recent discussions here
give me the impression that aeration of HOT wort is not so good.
Is this slightly-chilled wort considered "hot"?  And, if so,
does this apply to hot wort being vigorously splashed and
aerated as it meets and mixes with cold water?  What I want to
know is whether I should be trying to sparge more gently -- e.g.,
by sparging smaller quantities at a time using a saucepan rather
than dumping the entire cookpot-worth in one big whoosh -- or
whether I'm okay doing it the more violent way.
   A related question:  When I do this sparging into the fermenter,
should I be leaving behind anything in the cookpot?  That is, if
the ice bath results in "cold break," does that mean that whatever
settles out of solution in the cookpot should be left behind
rather than passed along to the fermenter?  If I've used plugs or
whole leaf hops, will their presence in the strainer effectively
strain out any undesirables?  Or should I be careful to leave a
little sediment in the bottom of the cookpot, remiscent of leaving
that little half-ounce of yeasty beer in the bottom of a bottle
when pouring?
   I've been consistently satisfied with my results, but I'm
certainly eager to improve my technique in whatever ways I can.
Thanks for the feedback.

Subject: Cranberry chunks and racking


There is a very simple solution to the problem that Curtis
(CSS2`at`OAS.PSU.EDU) mentions in HBD #1596: a so-called grain bag. 


That is a cylindrical bag with a mesh bottom (polyester it seems) sold
ostensibly to hold grain for lautering. To "prefilter" chunky beer,
sanitize the bag and slip it into the bucket or carboy; put the racking
cane inside, and siphon away. Essentially no floaters or sinkers will get
in and, because of the large surface area, there is no likelihood of
clogging the filtering surface. 


This works extremely well, even for such small particles as pelletized 
hops.

Ok...here is my chance to play the nerdy engineer  :-)


Given a driving force that tries to produce circulation in  a vessel
containing liquid (the force could be heating on the bottom, or gas
produced by yeast), nature will try to maximize the effectiveness of 
that circulation.  Geometries that are relatively short and squat are
more effective at maximizing the turnover of liquid than are tall
thin ones, ESPECIALLY when the driving forces are large (e.g. strong 
heating or rapid gas production at the base of the vessel).  Granted, you
tend to loose the phenomena described above, where you have liquid rising
in the middle, and falling at the wall...but you gain a mass of many little
circulations (called Benard cells) that is very effective at circulating
liquid up and down in the system.  As the geometry becomes taller, the
efficacy of the Benard cells decreases.  So...I guess given my undrestanding
of how fluid wants to circulate, the short squat vessel makes a lot more
sense to me than does a tall thin one...

It seems that in my attempts to be brief, I have caused confusion.  When I brew
a Czech Pils, I use my (very soft) water untreated and do the full triple
decoction.  The issue I was addressing in my previous post was more generically
how to acidify a mash with only pale malts and very soft water.  For styles like
British Pale Ales, I practically saturate the water with CaSO4.  For other
styles, like Helles Bocks and Vienna Lagers, I agree that CaCl2 is more
appropriate.  At the end of the day, regardless of the actual salt used, the
goal with many beer styles is to get the concentration of Calcium ions up into
that magic 50 - 100 ppm range.

  The reason I have gone to bottle labels (laser-printed and glued with milk)

SOL.  After a party with seven different brews and all night going "I don't

to go.
  And for those of us who are labor-impaired, you can just dump the labels in

Subject: Wort aeration/ fermenter geometry


I would like to second the excellent comments made by Maribeth in
HBD#1592. One important point that often bedevils discussions
on wort aeration is that readings from DO meters are relevant
only when equilibrium conditions are achieved. This point came
up in the recent article "Theoretical and Experimental Investigations
of a Wort Aeration System" by Reuther and Brandon which appeared in
MBAA Tech. Qr., Vol. 31, pp.5-9, 1994. They did a study of the wort
aeration system used at the Heilmann plant in La Cross, Wi. (BTW
the mathematical model they derived is both clever and very 
interesting). The "in line" DO values reported (both by calculation
and direct measurement) fell in the range 20-30 mg/l. This creates
something of a paradox because values in this range are definitely
lethal to yeast. This paradox gets resolved at the very end of the
article where it is seen that once the wort enters the fermenter
depressurization occurs and DO readings promptly drop below 10 mg/l.
This is the point Maribeth made, namely there is a definite limit to
the amount of O2 that can be completely dissolved in wort. Moreover,
this saturation limit is well below that which is harmful to yeast.
In research I have done for my new book I have found that the saturation
limit decreases sharply with increasing temperature, and it also decreases 
with increasing wort gravity. The latter in some sense is bad news, for O2
demand for most strains will increase with wort gravity. In any case I
have found that it is very easy to underaerate wort, but that it is
impossible to over oxygenate it even with direct O2 injection. 
**************************************************************
Martin Manning comments in HBD#1595 about the favorable fermentations
that occur in tall fermenters. The ones I am familiar with in commercial
use have stirring devices, something that overrides DeClerck's
height/diameter effects. When I described some worst case experiments
with fermenters having wort height/diameter ratios >5, I did not mean
to imply that such fermenters were necessarily flawed. Simply one must
be careful in selecting the yeast strain that is used in such cases. I
am aware of at least five commercial operations (fortunately none in
Texas!) who have discovered this point the hard way.

Subject: FOOP Experiment


Inspired by Jeremy Bergsman <jeremybb`at`leland.Stanford.EDU>,  I have designed
and executed my own foam-only-once-protein (FOOP) experiment (long post;
sorry!):  


Two 500 ml bottles of Wickuler Pils (an all-malt German Pilsner) were used.
The bottles are big green versions of the standard American long-neck bottle
shape. They were well-chilled, then opened and partially emptied (about 200
ml was removed).  Then the head spaces were purged with CO2 and they were
re-capped.  They were prepared one at a time, and emptied carefully and
equally using a small siphon.  The dissolved CO2 was of course ultimately
reduced by doing this, but equally so in both samples.  For the next two
hours one of them was shaken vigorously, every fifteen minutes, for a total
of eight times.  Then they were allowed to stand, refrigerated, for about 52
hours.  With the large head space, one can generate a lot of foam
(potentially denaturing a lot of proteins), and simulate the rough treatment
suffered by an impatient force-carbonator's beer.  After the rest period, the
bottles were opened and poured simultaneously into two identical glasses
(large 500 ml tumblers).  


The results of the initial pour did not show any discernible difference in
the size, quality, or longevity of the foam.  Each had 15-20 mm of foam (in
fact slightly more head formed on the shaken sample, but this was likely due
to my pouring skill), and they seemed to last equal (proportionately) times. 




Both samples were then stirred with a fork to raise a large head of about 40
mm depth. The shaken sample only produced about 3/4 of the head depth that
the un-shaken sample did.  Again, the longevity of each seemed proportional
to the initial height. This was repeated, and the results were similar. 
After these heads dissipated, both samples were essentially flat, and
additional stirring would not produce more than a few mm of foam on either
one.  


Although it was not immediately apparent, some damage seems to have ben done
by the shaking. Based on this, I will probably not force-carbonate by shaking
soda kegs any longer.  Rather, I will pressurize the keg (maybe initially
above the desired final equilibrium pressure, to speed up the process) and
let the CO2 be absorbed quietly. While shaking does get CO2 in solution
faster initially, I find that it still takes a week or so for the quality of
the foam to peak. Either method may take about the same time in the end.


A point to ponder: After the shaking was completed, and the samples were
allowed to rest for a while, an oily film was observed on the surface of the
shaken beer.  Others can speculate as to the nature of this film and its
influence on head formation and retention; all I can say is that the
equipment I used was clean, and in any case it did not appear on the unshaken
sample.  If a number of us did the experiment described here (come on; you
won't even waste any beer!), we could even get a "statistically significant"
sample of data on this one.

Subject: More Fermentor Geometry


Al Korzonas reprised Bill Szymczak from his report on a blow-off/non blow-off
experiment:


>After 10 days (66F) the non-blowoff batch was finished with a SG of >1.011,
while the blowoff batch was still at 1.020.  I bottled the
>non-blowoff batch and reracked the blowoff batch and let it sit in
>secondary for another 10 days, then bottled with a FG=1.013.


And added:


>The geometry differences do not have to be so great.  How do you >explain
the difference in FG in Bill's experiment?  All from blowoff?  I >would not
be so sure without having done the same experiment with >similar-geometry
fermentors.


The fact that the blow-off batch went much faster says something else is
going on here. If anything, the blow-off is removing yeast, and should slow
the fermentation.  I think (and I am simply guessing, don't you sometimes,
Al? ;-)) that a temperature trace for the full carboy would show a higher
peak, and is again a suspect for an unconstrained variable.  The (1-3/8
gallon) non-blow-off batch had the higher surface area/volume in this case,
and the CO2 in the space above the beer might even have contributed to
cooling the non-blow-off batch by convection.  Both of these factors would
surely drive the full carboy to a faster fermentation rate as observed, and
possibly affect the FG too.  


Also, Bill, not to cast aspersions or anything, but do you think you can
measure accurately to 0.002 in SG? Tell us about your instrument. If it's a
good one, calibrated to 0.1 P (0.0004 SG), with an internal thermometer, or a
refractometer, I'll beleive you. If it's the typical amateur type, calibrated
only to 0.002 SG (0.5 P), I'll wonder.

Subject: Fermentor geometry and temperature gradients


In HBD #1596, "P Brooks" asks brings up some points/questions about
temperature gradients and fermentor geometry.


A while back, I exchanged some e-mail with a guy on
rec.crafts.metalworking about building cylindroconal (sp?) fermentors.
I've forgotten this gentleman's name, but he gave me some great
information about sanitary welding, since he was essentially building
all his equipment from the ground-up.  I had an idea that I would try
to build a half-barrel SS fermentor at the time.  I was being
over-ambitious, but the information that he gave me was very, very
interesting nevertheless.


What he told me was that the "RIGHT WAY" to build a cylindroconal
fermentor (which is NOT the way that all the commercial manufacturers
do it) is to put the tubes that carry the coolant (glycol, usually)
all at the top of the vessel.  If you do it right, apparently, you
will set up a temperature gradient in the fermenting wort which will
cause the wort to sort of "sloosh" around on its own (i.e. fermenting
is an exothermic process, and fermenting wort at the bottom heats up,
rises, then cools and sinks).  I don't need to point out that this
would do a number of things to speed the fermentation process.


Additional, placement of the coolant tubes near the bottom will
potentially create ice crystals forming in your beer, and even
potentially frozen batches (particularly when you try to make a
half-batch).


There's my two bits on the subject.

Subject: Sanitizing with Potasium Metabisulfite




Hello to all HBD'ers


I'm looking for a better solution for sanitizing (I currently use bleach).
On several occasions on the HBD, and also in TCJOHB Potasium Metabisulfite 
(also known as Campden tablets) was not recommended for sanitizing equipment 
for beer. I think the main reason was the fact that it's operation relies on 
the acidity of the liquid (disolving it in water gives no sanitizing solution
 but rather it's interaction with acid such as the case in wine making). How 
about using it in the following way - make a weak acidic solution  using 
vinegar or citric acid, dissolve the Metabisulfite in it, use it for sanitizing
the equipment, rinse with water or simply let it dry. I assume that even if
beer yeast strains are less tolerant to it than wine yeast strains the residual
amount left on the surface of the sanitized vessel should not cause any 
problem (remeber that in wine you sanitize the wine itself using Metabisulfite,
and here I am talking of only sanitizing equipment). Any comments?
Also - what is exactly Iodophor (living in a non English speaking country 
a chemical formula will be best - international language).
Any other generic substance that can be used and easily obtained?


Another subject:
I have an old racking cane and tube I purchased when I was in the U.S. I want
to renew them. What are they made of? I found a tube in a hardware store but it
has a strong vynil smell - I do not intend to try it. Anybody tried Silicon
tubes? I know they can also withstand high temprature (up to about 200 degrees
Centigrade).

Good analysis. Kentucky Common was a turn-o-century beer, and it did die
out with Prohibition.  The Ohio River Valley, which doesn't have much in
common with Appalachia or corn squeezin's, was heavily German in heritage
and had a lot of regional breweries back in those days.


Sorry I don't have a recipe or good style description for Kentucky Common,
but Brewmaster Dave Pierce at Louisville's Bluegrass Brewing Co. (an
outstanding brewpub, usual disclaimers apply, etc.) made a Kentucky Common
as a seasonal beer last spring, using an old commercial recipe.  It sold
out fast.  Dave's a friendly feller, and would probably be happy to talk
about the beer with anyone who called him at the pub, (502) 899-7070.

There have been a couple of questions about the Czech Pils yeast from
Wyeast (#2278):


in HBD 1587 Al Kinchen writes:


> The 2124 batch has a good head. The 2278 batch has a FANTASTIC head. Best

    This was my experience as well.  Last winter I brewed two batches of
    pilsner within 2 weeks of each other.  One used the Bavarian Lager
    yeast, the other used the Czech Pils yeast.  The Czech Pils batch
    had much better head retention.  I think it had more initial head
    because I bottled it a little early but the head also lasted much
    longer.


in HBD 1595 Joe McCarthy asks about using the Czech Pils yeast for Bocks
& O'fest biers.  I have not used it for these styles but I can say that
is produced a LOT of diacetyl in a starter when fermented at 52^F.  I
ended up decanting the starter solution off of the yeast and added new
starter solution to ferment at 45^F before putting into my wort at 45^F.
There was no noticable diacetyl in these.  Thus I would make sure your
basement is well below 55^F before using this yeast for a lager.

Teddy, I recommend that you take the SS screen and roll it into a tube and

a set up like yours (although on a smaller scale) to an EM and found it
worked much better for me. I get clear run off very quickly and have the

Al K says that, contrary to my thinking that it wouldn't be a good idea to 
add a lot of fermentables to a "watery" beer that Eamon wants to "doctor," 
that he can't think why it wouldn't work.  Come to think of it, neither can 
I.  It just didn't seem like a good idea.  I shot from the hip on that one, 
and now can't justify my opinion.  It still doesn't seem right, but only 
intuitively, so I'd consider it a viable route, along with the others 
suggested. 
 
*** 
On a related note, johnm`at`giant.IntraNet.com forgot the half pound of black 
patent malt when making his porter, so he now has a brown porter, so can he 
steep the patent malt and add it now?  I say, sure, I've done this in small 
amounts for color adjustment, so why not with larger amounts.  Try not to 
aerate when you add it if fermentation has ceased. 
 
*** 
That's what Carl Etnier is worried about, aeration when doing an additional 
racking to reduce his yeast on the bottom of his bottles.  I think you don't 
have to worry at this point, Carl, because you are adding priming sugar, so 
your yeast can respire and remove the O2.  I don't think ascorbic acid is 
necessary.  Whenever I have time, I do just what you have done - rack to a 
tertiary for yeast settling.  I end up with a yeast layer no thicker than a 
coat of paint.  There is still plenty of yeast left for carbonation, even in 
what appears to be clear beer.  Of course, I always purge my new vessel with 
CO2 to eliminate oxygenation during that racking, since fermentation has 
ceased, and I'm not yet adding priming sugar. 
 
*** 
Brett Hunt wonders about a Kitchen Aid grain mill.  I think that while this 
would be convenient, it is just a burr mill, like a Corona, and will shred 
your husks.  A roller mill should give you a much superior crush.  Some one 
else asked about this six months ago or so, so maybe he has experience.  I 
tried to talk him out of it too, though. 
 
*** 
Kurt B. Wurm has two questions.  Are steel cut oats cous-cous?  No, 
cous-cous is a wheat (often semolina-from durum wheat) pasta from North 
Africa.  Steel cut oats are coarse oat grits.  They need to be gelatinized, 
although mash temperatures may do this, whereas rolled oats are already 
gelatinized.  I don't know of any reason not to use rolled oats. 
 
*** 
And Kurt gives testimony to what I have posted before - that new regulations 
require a more stable chlorine to be added to drinking water, and that this 
won't outgas with standing.  He wonders what it is.  It is monochloroamine, 
an ammonia molecule with one chlorine substitution - NH2Cl.  Besides 
filtering, another (counterintuitive) way of removing this is to add bleach. 
 This will trichlorinate the amine, and NCl3 is volatile and will outgas, as 
will any excess chlorine from the bleach.  It will take a few days, though, 
and you may chlorinate other organics, resulting in nasties.  A carbon 
filter will also remove any free ammonia (good) once reducing bacteria have 
taken residence on the filter medium.  (This info from a phone conversation 
with the water chemist at the Ann Arbor Water Treatment Plant.  I don't know 
that stuff myself).

I believe that Charlie is referring to the use of monochloroamine in the
chlorination of municipal water.  I don't know whether it is a federal
regulation or not.  But the chlorine added to water in this way cannot be
removed by boiling like chlorine added as a gas can be.  Charcoal filtering
will remove this stuff.  Many cities are moving to the use of ozone (O3) as 
a sanitizer.  For brewer's this is great since it adds no flavor and at the
levels that come out of your tap it won't hurt the yeast.
