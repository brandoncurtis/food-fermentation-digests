Tim Laatsch in LarryLand asks about Lindeman's:


Can you say expensive fruit soda? I knew ya could. (In fact, you did in your
post whether you know it or not.) Yes, lambics are supposed to have a sour
character (and lots of other things). I'm no expert, just a satisfied
imbiber,but stay away from that Lindeman's swill! If you want to get a little
more information, try subscribing to the lambic-digest. The discussion covers
Belgian brews generally, but you get some real lambic-heads there who will tell
you more than you ever imagined you'd want to know. Send subscribe request to
lambic-request`at`lance.colostate.edu


Eugene Sonn asks about priming:


I prime by starting with the boiled corn sugar and water in the bottom of the
"target" bucket and rack the beer on top of it with the hose on the bottom of
the bucket. The "swirling" action seems to be enough to mix the sugar and the
beer. Make sure your hose is long enough to lay on the bottom of the bucket and
you should have no problem getting a consistent mix without any other stirring
or splashing (which you want to avoid anyway).


Don Ulin asks about non-alcohol beer:


I don't know about _non_-alcohol beer, but I have made a decent enough
low-alcohol beer. OG was 1.024, with a pound of carapils in five gallons to
give it some body. Nothing remarkable, but good enough for a third place ribbon
at the Wisconsin State Fair among a wide range of styles (i.e., the category
for anything that didn't fit in a category). Go easy on the hops.  It was a
cheap enough experiment--two cases for $7-8: One 3.3 pound bag of NW extract, a
pound of grain, hops totalling about an ounce, and a pack of (yes) dry yeast.
Pierre Rajotte's Belgian ale book in the style series gives a recipe for a
table beer he calls "Driver's Choice." OG is 1.016.  Haven't tried it. I can
recall the published OG because I recently had the book out while giving
telephone advice to someone on tripels (how's that for a contrast in alcohol
content?) and paged by that part of the book.  Not that one shouldn't be
careful, but my understanding from recent research (only a newspaper reader's
knowledge) is that the alcohol and pregnancy thing has been overstated.
It's hard to imagine that an occasional 1.016 beer should be a problem for
a healthy person. YMMV.  I'm not a physician and I don't play one on TV.


Now go have a beer,

Subject: Beer flavor not wheel but log


The 'beer flavor wheel' is an attempt to standardize a language through which
tasters can agree on a word to flavor corelation. I don't know why it's in
the form of a wheel, but if the wheel is unraveled, it looks a lot like this.
Pay particular attention to the lack of indentation for this report. If you
use it, indent using the following standard:


Class 1
    0110
        0111
        0112


Class 2
    etc.


I hope that you find this useful in trying to communicate just what you're
tasting in your beers, meads, wines, sakes, ciders, or feathers...

Subject: Worlds Cheapest Counterpressure Filler!


I've been shopping around for parts to make a CP filler and before
purchasing anything I stopped to analyze exactly what I was doing. I want to
fill a bottle with minimum oxidation/foam/loss of carbonation.


Here's what I do. Step 1, purge the bottle with CO2, I simply connect an
empty keg to a dispensing tap and give the empty a shot. Step two, fill the
bottle with my funky-new-filler(tm). Step 3, cap, store and drink.


How to build the funky-new-filler(tm): attach about 6 inches of 3/8 tubing
to the end of the keg tap (or whatever size fits your tap well). Attach
about 10 inches of rigid plastic or SS tubing to the end of the 3/8 tubing
(again, or whatever fits). Slide a #2 bored stopper over the rigid tubing,
far enough on so that the tube extends almost to the bottom of a bottle when
the stopper is seated snugly.


Place the funky-new-filler(tm) into the bottle, and press the tap to start
the beer flowing. The bottle will fill about 1 inch before the pressure
equalizes inside the bottle to the keg pressure (I use 15 PSI to dispense).
At his point some skill is required, and can be obtained through practice.
Gently squeeze the stopper and some of the pressure will leak by, allowing
beer to flow. continue to squeeze in a pseudo-controlled fashion until the
bottle is full. I fill until beer actually leaks by, assuring me that the
bottle is void of any gas, be it air or CO2. Remove the funky-new-filler(tm)
and there will be about the right ammount of headspace to satisfy the
judges. Removing the filler will draw air into the bottle as the level
drops, but I figure no more than an expensive commercial filler.


Total cost for the filler, 45 cents.

(From *Jeff* Renner)


Okay, we've all talked about the benefits of blowoff, skimming, etc,
and danced around the *real* $64,000 question.  Just what is that waxy
brown crud on primary walls, blowoff tubes, etc.?  I've seen this argued
for twenty years (Zymurgy, Dave Line, everybody else.)  Some say it is
your precious isomerized hop acids, and that removing it will reduce your
hopping bitterness.  Others say that it is some unwanted bitter
component (hot break, cold break?) that should be removed or you will get an 
unwanted harsh bitterness (ever tasted it?  You will be tasting bitter 
for many, many minutes).  Others say that it is just collapsed kraeusen 
(foam).  I've heard lots of opinions.  Does anyone *really* know?  I 
mean, like chromatography results or something?  Documented facts?  This 
certainly has bearing on the blowoff/skimming discussion.  Please, some of you 
chemists, tell us.

A better alternative is to find a local restaurant with a champagne brunch and 
ask if you can take them.  I have about ten cases of champagne bottles (along 
with the original boxes) that came from one place.  They are much easier to 
rinse if you get to them within an hour or so.  These have several advantages --
they hold more, most have a concave bottom that traps yeast settlement and they 
are made with VERY thick glass.  I dropped a full bottle on concrete from waist 
level and it did not break.  Disadvantages include not fitting on the top rack 
of my dishwasher (this is a huge disadvantage to me), they will not fit upright 
in my refrigerator except on the top shelf and somtimes I'm in the mood to only 
have 12 ounces (very, very rare).  You can also bottle wine in these bottles, 
but the id of the neck is smaller, and you have to really force the cork in.  
Surprisingly, they aren't that bad to get out.  I have also tried using the 
plastic corks with wire wrappers for sparkling meads, but either they did not 
contain the pressure or my mead decided not to sparkle...

I thought one of the big advantages to these systems was that primary and 
secondary fermentation could be done in the same carboy by simply draining the 
break material, spent hops, etc..  Has anyone had any trouble with these 
leaking?  I have heard only positive comments about these and I am considering 
buying a couple.

Someone else wrote recently that Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic was not actually 
a lambic at all.  This is the only "lambic" I have ever tried, and I liked it 
quite a bit.  I have been looking at lambic recipes and thinking about making 
something similar to SA.  If this is not a lambic, I guess I have no idea what 
one tastes like either.  What would SA Cranberry Lambic actually be classified 
as? No matter what it is, I would still like to make something like it.

Subject: Aeration - To easy to be healthy?


  Good day Brew Crew,


  A while ago there was a thread regarding improving the performance of your
  little yeastie dudes by ensuring proper aeration. I had never really thought
  to much about this, but I took it to heart, and, after pitching, commenced
  to shaking/stirring until my need for oxygen was greater than my yeasties.
  Well, of course, like the rest of the collective wisdom here, this added the
  desired effect (a more vigorous/complete ferment)... mostly. One day while
  chilling a batch of Cranberry-Honey Porter, and sending my little yeastie
  beasties for their before dinner bath (rehydrating), I was contemplating this
  "Aeration thing" and decided to try pouring the cooled, sterile wort through
  the strainer I use for sparging, (plain old SS basket screen kitchen type
  strainer) ala' your kitchen faucet aerator. I poured about 1/3 of my 1.060
  wort in through the strainer (lotsa bubbles) sent my yeastie dudes in for  
  dinner, and poured the rest of my wort in through the strainer. (lots more
  bubbles) A very vigorous ferment started within hours and my brew was down
  to 1.010 within a week (that was when I checked it). As for an unscientific
  data point, my brother brewed a Porter the next week which he didn't do this
  to, 1.048, and we wound up bottling at 1.022 (with our fingers crossed). Two
  weeks later we brewed a Pale Ale, used this method (same yeasty family-Edme)
  and that dropped to 1.011 in a week.


  My question... what's wrong with this, it seems to easy. I am more into the
  hobby/art of brewing than the "science". I understand that pouring my cooled
  sterile wort through the air could induce nasties, but I figure if beer was
  brewed in the "old days" by people who rarely even bathed, I won't kill mine
  by pouring through a strainer. I am not really worried, I more want to know
  if I happened upon a cheap, easy way that may benefit others without worrying
  about aquarium pumps, airstones, inline oxygen injection and saturation
  points. 


  By the way, after many worries, the Cran-Honey Porter will probably be OK...
  preliminary tastings indicate the possibility that I used too much cranberry
  (4.5 lbs), The regular porter tasted GREAT at bottling, but hasn't been
   "officially" taste tested yet. The Pale Ale is in secondary, and I am 
  preparing to sacrifice more virgin (never flocculated) yeastie dudes. Maybe
  an Imperial Stout.... hmmm.

From: Domenick Venezia <venezia`at`zgi.com>
Subject: FOOP


Both Don Rudolph and Maribeth Raines mention fried eggs and the
agglutination/coagulation of albumin as an analogy for the proposed
mechanism of FOOP.  First albumin is a complete globular protein, not a
short peptide.  Second, frying/poaching/scrambling an egg at temperatures
at or above the boiling point of water is a considerably more drastic
action than shaking cold beer in a keg.  I don't think that you can use a
fried egg as an analogy for, or an example of, FOOP. 


That said, and after following the discussion, I must say that the
argument that denatured peptides will in some measure associate with each
other, i.e., agglutinate, and thereby no longer be available for foam
production has merit.  I've also been convinced that the breaking of
chemical bonds is not a factor in FOOP.  There are still a lot of "ifs". 
If FOOP is a real phenomenon.  If the hydrodynamics drives the refolding
equilibrium to the agglutination side.  If agglutination actually removes
peptides from foam production. 


Some tests come to mind.  


Just shaking beer flat beer should reduce its foam production.  This is a
qualitative test of the existence of FOOP. 


If denatured peptide agglutination is a factor then boiling beer and
rechilling should reduce foam production considerably, although I
routinely do 2 hr boils and get good breaks, my beers foam just fine. 


Also, I think I just contradicted my first paragraph.  Maybe nobody noticed.


Shaking beer should alter the molecular weight profile of the protein.  If
FOOP exists and is due to bond breakage then the profile should move to
lighter (shorter) peptides, if agglutination is a factor then the profile
should get heavier. 


I know that I can do the first test easily, just flatten some beer (gently
pour into a bowl and allow to outgas for 24 hrs) then put a measured
amount in a graduated cylinder, stopper and shake (by hand) a given
amount.  Measure and note the height of the foam.  Shake the remaining
beer on a lab shaker for 24 hrs and repeat the hand shake test.  If enough
people do it perhaps we can come to a consensus.  Send me your protocols
and your results and I'll compile them. 


The second test (boiling) can also be done using the hand shake test. 
Again send me your protocols and your results.

Subject: carboy glug-no-more


Here's a tip for users of narrow mouth glass carboys. It is
impossible to pour liquids from these carboys with a lot of
sloppy glugging as air is sucked in through the liquid stream.
A simple homemade vent will cure the problem. Use a length of
old siphon tubing a foot or so long. Bend the piece of tubing
into a U-shape. Insert one end into the carboy past the neck
of the opening. Hold the other end along the outside of the
carboy. If you are using a carboy handle, you can use the handle
to hold the outside portion of the tubing in place.


Clean pouring - no more splashing cleaning solutions - and the
carboy will drain MUCH faster than before.

This is not an advertisement for nor support of Samuel Adams.


I came across an ad that stated Boston Beer Co. <TM> was offering the
same hops that are used in Sam Adams <TM> beers (Hallertau Mittlefreuh)
for sale to the public. I remember the radio ad and the picture in Boston 
Beer Co.'s <TM> newsletter showing Jim Koch <TM> handpicking whole flower 
Noble Hops.  I thought that I would like to try these hops, at $12/pound 
and no shipping - not too bad of a deal. 2 months went by, then I finally
received a package from Boston Beer Company. I opened the package, and to my
surprise i found pellet hops. Now I use pellet hops on occasion, but I had
assumed that Sam Adams <TM> was made with whole flower hops. I still don't
have a problem with pellet hops, but why does Jim Koch <TM> go to the
trouble to say that all his hops are hand picked. I didn't know that there
was a big difference between 1 pellet or another. Oh well, enough rambling.
I need a beer.

Subject:  Pots/Temperature Control


  For those of you considering spending the money for a Sabco pot, you
may want to consider an alternative.  I purchased two 15G SS Vollrath pots
(with lids) from Something's Brewing in Vermont, 802-660-9007, for $155,
each.  Something's Brewing had the pots shipped directly from Vollrath (in
Wisconsin) to Precision Brewing Systems (PBS) in Stanton Island, 718-667-4459.
Ask for Ellen (at Something's Brewing) and mention my name if they have
questions regarding direct shipping the pots.


  PBS offers a number of modifications:  bottom drains, thermometer welds,
false bottoms, ... and they will entertain custom modifications as well.
For my sparge vessel, I had them weld a SS 0.5" fitting and SS 1" fitting
adjacent to one another, approximately 2" up from the bottom of the pot.
The 0.5" fitting accepts a thermowell and an I.C. temperature sensor and
the 1" fitting accepts a hot water heater element.  The hot water heater
element is NOT a standard 1" pipe thread.  PBS had the fitting custom
made.  If you're interested in the hot water heater element fitting, ask
for Ken, mention my name and I'm sure they'll fix you up.


  In my opinion, their workmanship is excellent.  Their false bottom is an 18
gauge SS disk with punched holes, custom-made for a (relatively) tight fit.
One of the disadvantages of this geometry, as opposed to say an EM or slotted
pipe, is the fact that a significant amount of recirculation is required to
establish the grain bed.  I had a terrible time with astringency until I
introduced a recirculating pump into the system.  Initially, I used the pump
to recirculate during mash out (10 - 15 minutes).  This seemed to adequately
clear the wort while minimizing HSA.


  With my automated system, which involves a water heater element in the
recirculating path, the wort will be recirculated through the duration of
the mash.


  In a prior append, Don (DONBREW) mentioned variations on the Rodney Morris
temperature controller circuit.  Up to this point in its development, I'm
very happy with my decision to use solid state relays (SSRs) as my main
temperature controller circuit.  Having a PC (with an I/O card) at the heart
of the system makes temperature control trivial (and in my opinion, somewhat
elegant).  The temperature is read by the PC from an I.C. temperature sensor
and used to control the state of the SSR (on or off).  I've been experimenting
with the control algorithm.  Initial measurements suggest I can hit a target
temperature with no more than 1 oF of overshoot and maintain the temperature
within +-0.5 oF.  I've only tested the algorithm against limited volumes of
sparge water.  I hope to begin testing full volumes and the recirculating
path within a week.


  For Don, who's looking for a cheap solution, I'm not sure I can help.  I
consider Bob McIlvaine an expert in this area (temperature controllers and
monitors ... not cheap ;*).  A number of his products are available through
JB Distributing, 603-465-7633, including a temperature sensor with SW which
utilizes the printer port of a PC.  Dion also has a lot of experience in this
area.  Last time I talked to Dion (HOLLEN), he was still working on perfecting
a board for a Morris-like temperature controller.  I suspect these guys will
tell you that the difficulty in integrating a PC with a Morris-like controller
is interfacing a TTL-level signal from a PC into a 110 V circuit (a problem I
solved using the SSR).

Subject:  Aeration procedures / Hop Teas


Hey HBDers,


With all this talk about aeration, a procedural question comes to mind.
After the wort is cooled and siphoned into the carboy, many authorities
suggest letting the wort sit overnight and then to rack the beer off the
cold break. What is the proper order of racking off cold break, pitching,
and aerating? At this point, I am more concerned with aerating and
pitching than I am with racking off the cold break. However, I don't have
the best temperature control (crack the window, close the window,
crack the window, etc.) and I am concerned with fusel alcohols being
formed from trub and warm fermentation temps. If I aerate and then pitch,
fermentation is almost always going after 6-8 hours after which it
becomes impossible for obvious reasons to rack off the cold break.
Should I be that concerned with fermenting with cold break and other
stuff that passes through the strainer? Or just aerate, pitch, and forget
it?


Question two about aeration: For those who use aquarium pumps, what
size do you use? 
- ---
I recently bottled a Christmas ale that wasn't bitter enough and I wanted
to add more bitterness. Has anyone ever made a hop tea and added it at
bottling time to add bitterness or even flavor/aroma? What I am looking for
is some way to quantify H oz of hops in W amount of water boiled for T
minutes to give me X IBU's when added to Y gallons of beer. Can
someone point me to a source or help me out? Will standard IBU
calculations (Rager, Garetz, etc.) work here? I am aware of bottled hop
oil but I am not sure I want to use it.


Thanks and brew on my friends,

Hi all,
Thought I would post the results of my recent roller mill project. 
First of all, thanks to all the folks who contributed valuable
insight during the initial concept formulation.


   My overall goal was to design an adjustable mill using mostly
common, easily obtained parts that is relatively easy to build. The
end result is a mill with these features: 


 - 2" diameter steel rollers, diamond knurled, supported by sealed
ball bearings.


 - Motor driven 
   
 - All major assemblies made from hardwood, masonite or particle
board.


 - Cost about $100.  Lower, if you're a good scrounger (My cost was
$57.00 including the motor!).


 For those interested, I have written a description of the project
with bill of materials and a full set (seven) of dimensioned
drawings.  Send me a private E-Mail with your snail-mail address
for a copy.

        This is one area of home brewing where I have be told that I have gone too
far, but with
success. I do not have a smoker but I have worked out a way to produce very
good smoked
malt. I use unmalted dried barley ( whole ) let it soak for several days at
50 F then sprout the
grains, let acrospire grown to about 1 inch. And then I put the green malt in
a roasting pan with
many, many small holes punched in it. This is then placed in my bar b que
over smoldering
wood chips. The chips have been soaked in water for several days prior to
prevent burning. I
usually smoke the barley this way over night. After smoking I finish dring
the malt in the oven at
the lowest temperature possible. This may seem like a lot of work but it will
result in excellent
and genuine smoked malt rather than malt that is smoked.

I tried the 2112 this fall for a Vienna which I'm very happy with. I then made 
a Dopplebock, using the yeast cake from the Vienna as a starter. I just bottled 
it last week. It tasted very good at bottling time, and I hope will get better 
with cold storage.  Both beers were fermented mostly in the 50-58 degree range 
in a root cellar (part of my basement). Both are quite malty and the Vienna has 
'lagered' nicely into a very smooth tasting brew, one of my best. I have high 
hopes for the Dopplebock as well. My 'lagering' involves storing the bottled 
beer at temps in the 40's (too high for real lagering). So I say, go for it!


As an aside, the yeast FAQ says, "highly flocculant, clear brilliantly" and 
it's not kidding. Both beers are crystal clear, and what little yeast there is 
in the bottle attaches itself to the bottom and sides of the bottle. No 
sediment when pouring this stuff, but I have to use the bottle brush on each 
bottle while rinsing to clean the yeast out!


Good luck!

Many years ago, my water heater died also.  I removed the burner, mounted 
it in a 5 gal. can, and obtained a grating for the top to set my brew pot 
on.  I spent a couple of bucks to change the orifice to the appropriate 
size for propane and voila!  I have been using this burner for years and 
love it.  It even has a pilot light.  I have no trouble getting a rolling 
boil in 5 or 6 gal. in a short period of time.

Don't scrap it; finish it off!


If the gravity has fallen, there has been fermentation.


You didn't say what type of fermenting vessel you are using:
began with a plastic bucket that came with a "beginner homebrewer
kit",  and noticed that the lid dosent fit air-tight.  Result being that
initially the airlock bubbled rapidly as large volumes of gas were
produced, but then when the fermentation settled down to a lesser
rate, the air lock didn't bubble, the gas escaped elsewhere rather
than push up the airlock's water to make bubbles.  I initially panicked,
since I had been looking forward to watching the bubbles for
several days.  The beer, however,  was fine.


Depending on the composition of the extract you used, and the fermentation
temp., fermentation may not proceed much past the 1014 you now read.


Relax, etc....

Here, I think, is an interesting data point.


I had cooled my 1.090 wee heavy down to 65 degF prior to pitching one quart
of Wyeast Scotch Ale yeast (1968?) (slurry). After aeration with an
aquarium pump, I attached the blowoff tube and a Fermometer (liquid crystal
temperature display, stick-on) to the carboy. I cover my carboys with
quilted carboy cosies to protect from light and prevent temperature
fluctuations.


I usually ferment my Scotch ales in the refrigerator at 50 degrees, but for a 
variety of reasons I decided to ferment this one in my 66 degree basement. 
After several hours I checked on the state of the ferment. The fermentation
was proceeding nicely with bubbles out of the blowoff tube about every three 
seconds.


Imagine my surprise when the Fermometer showed that the carboy was at 74 
degrees! I checked my recording thermometer and the temperature was 66
degrees, and had only varied between 66 and 68 degrees. As the fermentation 
picked up, to the point where the foam began to blow out the tube and bubbles 
were coming out almost continuously, the Fermometer temperature continued to 
rise. I don't know where it finished because it was off the scale (>78
degrees) of the Fermometer.  Once the bulk of the fermentation had finished,
the Fermometer temperature dropped back down to ambient temperature (68
degrees).


I've checked my thermometers and the Fermometer and I have every reason to 
believe that they are reasonably accurate, keeping in mind that the Fermometer 
*is* a liquid crystal and only indicates in 2 degree increments.


I think this might explain esters in a brew that were not anticipated because 
they were fermented at "cooler" temperatures.
