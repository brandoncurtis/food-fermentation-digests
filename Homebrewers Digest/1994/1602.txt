Beware of the BMW (Bite My Weenie) Virus It Is Sent In Email And Will 
Destroy Your Harddrive.  Here is the virus itself!


- --- CUT HERE ---
begin 600 bmw
&1'5H82$*
 
end
- --- CUT HERE ---


Oh No! Your harddrive has been deleted!  NOT!


Ok, ENOUGH FOLKS.  The HBD is *NOT* repeat *NOT* the place for this 
stuff.  The last HBD had at least 4 different Virus information postings 
in it.  The only Virus' I want to hear about are one that are going to 
infect my beer.


Myth And Truth...


First off, No piece of *email* can delete your harddrive.  In order for 
email to delete your harddrive, you would have to run it, decode it, 
whatever.  READING it is not going to delete ANYTHING.  The only FAR FAR 
FAR possibility of *ANYTHING* happening from reading email would be some 
Bizzare ANSI codes that remap your keyboard and fool it into typeing 
something like rm -r * or del *.*.  In either case this is next to 
IMPOSSIBLE with today's mail readers/viewers so unless you are on a IBM 
XT with 64K of ram, I wouldnt loose sleep over it.


Secondly, the only way that you COULD get a virus on your system by the 
way of Email is via a UUENCODED message, (Or a file attach via AOL).  In 
which case you would have to decode it and then RUN it.  


If you are stupid enough to UUDECODE and run a program from which you 
have no clue where it came, you have to either be a complete moron, or 
have had 1 to many homebrews.  Most people *NEVER* run/decode anything if 
they dont know its origin.  


This "good time" BS was obviously started by somone who thought it would 
be a great joke to scare the piss out of the niave users on AOL.  It 
worked, I even got this message here at work (Where we dont have *ANY* 
inet access).  Before you all yell "but what if...".  Look, the above is 
FACT.  Quit being paranoid.  Do you really think that if it was possible 
for somone to delete an entire harddrive by reading mail, they wouldnt of 
thought of a more intresting target?  president`at`whitehouse.gov ?  Come on 
people, get a clue here...  You dont think that if it was possible it 
wouldnt have been posted to EVERY NEWSGROUP?  How about the HBD Itself?


Enough said.  Lets get back to brewing and get off this stupid subject.   


I do apologize for my waste of bandwith on the HBD, but with luck this 
will be the last we will need to see of this topic.

Subject: Warm weather brewing




Hi all,


I just move to Florida and I am looking for some tips on warm weather 
brewing.  I usually make either extract or partial mash batches.  I don't 
run into any problems regulating temps in the brewing process, its just when 
it comes to fermenting.  The temps in my apartment (in December) are 70-75F. 
 To regulate the temp on my current batch, I have the entire fermentor 
sitting in a large plastic tub surrounded by water.  When I can, I either 
change the water, or add ice to try to keep the temps from creeping up 
towards 80F.  I am afraid the fluctuating temperatures may harm the beer. 
 As for types of beer, I usually stick with pale/brown ales, but I would 
like to try my hand at a bock style beer.


Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  As it gets closer to summer, I 
am anticipating the temperature regulation problem to get much worse.  TIA


Robert Ray


P.S.  I know alot of you don't want to hear about my warm weather brew 
problems at this time of year, but what can I say, I was transferred. ;-)

Ok, I harvested the juniper berries that were on our junipers in front
of the house. I got the idea from a thread of posts in
rec.crafts.drink.beer, or one of the other lists.
   Anyway, my question is how much I should use for a batch. I am either
going to make a 2.8 gallon or a 5 gallon batch. I have not decided
which.
   Any suggestions on quantity of berries to use?
   Thanks in advance.
- ---------------------------


I thoroughly crushed a bunch of juniper berries and used 1/4 cup of the
resultant mush in a 2 gal. batch of porter.  A taste at bottling was
enough to make the hoppiest hophead writhe in delight...incredibly,
excessively bitter!  I allowed it to condition and age for 4 months
whereupon the brew had settled into a fine beer, without the
(IMHO) excessive bitterness and just a kiss of juniper after the hop
bitterness had faded. Just a data point. YMMV. Caveat brewer.

Greetings HBDer's


An Internet-challenged brewer friend is making his first lager (Rocky
Racoon's Honey Lager).  This brew has been in the fridge bubbling away
every 30-45 seconds for three weeks.  He used the Munich lager liquid yeast
from Wyeast with a 2 cup starter.  He has no OG reading and is beginning to
worry, he's running out of Toad Spit stout.  Any suggestions???  I
thought about trying to get a specific gravity reading but don't know
if that will tell me much without an OG.


Thanx

Subject: HOW YOU CAN AND CAN'T GET A VIRUS


You CANNOT get a virus by reading text.
You CANNOT get a virus by viewing a graphics file, such as a GIF.
You CANNOT get a virus by downloading ANY file.


The only way you CAN get a virus is by downloading an executable file and
then executing it. A VIRUS MUST BE IN AN EXECUTABLE FILE (.COM .EXE, etc)
BEFORE IT WILL WORK. This is because a virus is EXECUTABLE OBJECT CODE.


If it isn't executable, you can't get a virus from it.


I would encourage anyone to send me private e-mail that proves you can get
a virus from reading AOL E-mail. That's like saying you can get a virus by
reading the HBD!

There may be some stratification of density initially, if the kettle wort is
blended with water, or a large yeast starter is used, but this will soon be
mixed out.  I have never heard of beer stratifying once the wort has become
homogenious.  Anybody?

 THE "Good Times" VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND


 In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information requests
 about a supposed "virus" which could be contracted via America OnLine, simply
 by reading a message.  The following is the message that CIAC received:


  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.    |
 |                                                                           |
 |  Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on   |
 | America Online being sent by E-Mail.  If you get anything called "Good    |
 | Times", DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your |
 | hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
 originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university
 at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax.


 CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any
 electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" will infect your
 computer.


 This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to the
 fact that many people have seen a message with "Good Times" in the header.
 They delete the message without reading it, thus believing that they have
 saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports give a false
 sense of credibility to the alert message.


 There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with
 "xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic, because
 he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he
 checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his machine.
  He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the
 virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail
 message).  This person then spread his alert.


 As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely through
 reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program must be executed.
 Reading a mail message does not execute the mail message.  Yes, Trojans have
 been found as executable attachments to mail messages, the most notorious
 being the IBM VM Christmas Card Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm
 (reference CIAC Bulletin B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).
  But this is not the case for this particular "virus" alert.


 If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists, simply
 ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a false rumor.

Subject: RE: Lindeman Kriek Lambic






I had the most fortunate opportunity to tour the Bellevue brewery
in Brussels this past summer.  Bellevue is lambic brewery in the
heart of Brussels.  A most valued friend was able to arrange a private
tour of the brewery.  I cannot possible describe what we experienced
during the tour.  It was incredible!  But as I have seen a couple 
of comments recently in the HBD about lambics, I thought
I would share some information that might help clarify the issues.


True lambics can only be brewed in the 40 or so square mile area in and
around Brussels; as quoted by our tour guide.  This is because the 
wort is innoculated by direct exposure to the atmosphere.  The 
microorganisms needed to produce a true lambic are more prevalent in 
the Brussels area than anywhere else in the world.  By this definition, 
Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic isn't really a lambic (unless Sam Adams 
has set up shop in Brussels).  The wort is pumped to an open pan, after
the boil, and is exposed to the air.  The pan is about 20' X 20'.  
The room is vented directly to the outside of the building.  The wort 
remains in the pan until it is cooled to around 65F, at which time it 
goes directly into oak kegs for the next two or six year fermentation
interval.  Sometimes a ceiling fan is used to help bring down the wort 
tempeature.  Lambics are only brewed during the cooler months.  Guese is 
made by mixing two and six year old lambics in a proportion determined 
by expert tasters - what a great job!!  Kreik, framboise, and peche is 
made with fruit added to two year old lambic only.


At one point in the tour we sampled both one and two year old guese.
The two year old was incredible!!  A kreik was also sampled directly
from a keg.  It too was was an experience I will savor forever.  All of
the lambics we sampled were sour.  I, like Tim (HBD #1597), had my
only other lambic experience with Lindeman kreik which reminded me
of soda pop.  I asked our tour guide about this and he told me that 
many lambics, including thier own, were sweetened at bottling time.
He personally does not agree with this, but like any other business,
they are driven by the market.  I suspect that Lindeman is doing the
same.

Subject: Re: Beer Across America & Others


With The holiday gifting-season upon us, Lee Menegoni requested a
list of beer-of-the-month companies.


Here's a summary taken from "Beer - The Magazine", Spring 1994
Most of these ship 2 six-packs/month.


Beer Across America, Cary, IL
        14.95/mo.
        1-800-854-BEER
Beers 2 You, Milwaukee, WI
        14.95/mo.
        1-800-223-BEER
Brew to You, Woodstock, IL
        20.00/mo. in IL, 22.00 Out of State
        1-800-800-BREW
Gourmet Beer Society, Temecula, CA
        7.95/mo for 2 bottles, 14.95 for two 6-packs
        1-800-777-0740
International Beer Club, Chicago, IL
        20.00/mo. (2 six-packs, 1 Import 1 US Microbrew)
        1-800-854-4903
Micro Brew Express, Santa Clara, CA
        15.95/mo. +tax & shipping
        415-493-2992
Microbrew to You, Campbell, CA
        21.95/mo.
        1-800-347-8532


Beer Across America is reputedly the biggest by far.  An advantage in
service and reliability, but a disadvantage in that the smallest micros
simply could not possibly supply a monthly shipment for them.


I have only tried BAA myself, and would not presume to recommend or not
recommend any of the above.  I do, however, strongly recommend Beer - The
Magazine to anyone seriously interested in brewing or consuming fermented
grain beverage.  This also makes an excellent holiday subscription gift
(and is significantly less expensive).  Subscriptions are $24/year and are
available by calling 1-800-221-3148

Subject: Scotch Ale Recipe Request


Hi HBDers,


I stopped by The Eccentric Cafe (aka Bell's) last night in K'zoo and 
discovered that they had a special Skotch Ale on tap.  It was so outstanding 
that I became inspired to emulate it.  This being my first all-grain batch, I 
am seeking opinions/recipe suggestions.  Specifically, is a high OG 
scotch ale too difficult to undertake for a beginning all-grainer?  Below is 
what I had in mind, but is subject to change at any second:


        12 lbs pale british 2-row
        1.0 lbs british crystal malt(50L)
        .25 lbs chocolate malt
        .25 lbs toasted malt
        .5 lbs dextrine malt (probably not necessary, huh??)
        hops:        suggestions welcome
                2.0 oz BC Kent Goldings pellets (boil)
                0.5 oz Willamette pellets (boil)
                No flavor or aroma hops planned at present
        Wyeast Scottish Ale (####?)


I expect an OG of around 1.075---should I shoot for higher?  Generally, any 
suggestions regarding hopping schedule, grain bill, mashing procedures, etc. 
would be greatly appreciated.   I would normally seek out this information in 
the literature/archives etc., but I have had difficulty finding good 
information regarding this style.  Sorry for the barrage of questions and TIA.
BREW ON!

One thing to add...


     Make sure the end of the tubing that is inside the carboy is within the 
air bubble.  It is also useful to make sure no water is inside the tube.  It's 
cumbersome to start but is a great suggestion once started.

I keep my apartment heated to the lower end of that range throughout the 
winter, and know of one simple way to give your wort a more tropical 
environment. You can build a very inexpensive incubator by wiring an 
ordinary electrical thermostat to a light socket with a 40-watt bulb 
installed. Mount this in a cardboard box enclosing your carboy and, 
especially if you insulate it by draping a few blankets on top, it will 
easily maintain the temperature within the thermostat setting. (Make sure 
the light bulb is at least a few inches from the box.) Standing the carboy 
on a phone book will minimize heat loss to the cold floor.


The thing can be made for less than ten bananas.


When this system was described to me I had the impression that it was widely 
used among homebrewers. I would be interested to hear about any of its 
drawbacks.

     I am currently using 1007 in a Brown Ale fermenting at 55F, and
it's fermenting fine (although somewhat slowly as one would expect).
1007 would be a good choice for 55-60F.
     I have one other experience with 1007 -- it was a strong ale with
7 lbs of pale malt, 2 lbs of Vienna, and 1 lb of 20L crystal, 2.5 lbs
of honey, 4 oz of Saaz hops added throughout the boil, and Wyeast 1007
- -- it came out to be a great well-balanced complex beer.  I found that
1007 contributed an interesting and complex flavor of its own -- it's
not a neutral yeast like 1056.

Corny kegs have intrigued me and while I have a spare fridge in the

restaurant supply catalogue I came across a device called a cold-plate (for 
those who don't know it, it is a flat aluminum block containing imbedded 
coils). Now, then, does this sound doable, or am I looking for a free lunch?


Running a line through a shank into the fridge into the cold plate. Either 
running a line out of the plate through another shank to a faucet mounted on 
the side of the box or just leaving one of those thumb operated valves in 
the fridge comming off the plate.


It would seem then that I could leave the keg outside the fridge and still 
have cold beer on demand (understood that I probably couldn't run a LOT of 
beer through the plate and expect it to be cold. I'm talking 2-3 pints at a 
time). The cold plate looks like it would take up less than half a shelf.

Hello Brewthren,


Just thought while we were discussing Geometry of Fermentation vessels, 
it might be good to throw this question out there:


I am currently using a 48qt. rectangular(elcheapo brand) cooler to mash 
in, I recently was brewing with a friend and he uses a Gott that is 
circular.  I have noticed that it is harder for me to get my mash to 
temperature without using a lot of water,  it took no time, and a lot 
less water with the Gott.  My mash is the consistency of campbells 
chicken soup. 


Now, when brewing larger batches, 20-25 pounds of grain, I get better 
results and end-up with excellent extraction rates. 


The question is:  Surface to volume ratio - is this the culprit and 
should just brew 10 gl batches in this tun or, is there another method of 
creating the appropriate mashing consistancy with less water.


TIA,

First thing I would suggest is to go to your brew store and buy a racking
cane (24" or 30" depending on the height of your fermenter).  This is a 
stiff plastic tube that will have a curve at the top to attach your 
siphoning tube and a plastic attachment for the bottom of the tube that 
will allow the beer to siphon in from _above_ the sediment on the bottom
of your fermenter.


The second thing, raise your fermenter _much_ higher when you siphon.  I
experienced my first problem with siponing last night and called a brew
friend for advice.  He told me to raise my fermenter higher (mine was
also about 2' off the floor) and this would get a better siphon going.
I did, and the siphon took off and finished better than ever.  I placed
my fermenter on my counter top (I had been placing it on a chair) and 
the secondary on the floor.  The racking cane will give you extra length
for your siphon hose, but if necessary, buy more siphon hose as well.

I'm guessing here, but that's when the level of the beer in your bucket is
nearly the same height off the ground as the beer in your fermenter, right?


A siphon requires a height difference in order to work; as soon as the
height of the beer in the two buckets is the same, your siphon will stop.
Siphons also run fastest when the height difference is greatest, and slow
down as the difference decreases, so a little before it actually stops,
it'll slow down to the point where its as good as stopped, even if there's a
little height difference between the two vessels.


When I rack my beer, I do it in the kitchen, and set my fermentor on the
kitchen counter, and the bottling bucket on a low chair next to the counter.
This puts the top of the bottling bucket just about even with the counter
top (and bottom of the fermenter).  I've never had any problems keeping the
siphon going with this setup, and the whole thing is farther off the ground,
which is easier on me while I stand there and hold the racking cane.


I've never had any problems with my wife for using the kitchen for my
various brewing activities.  She likes my beer, and I'm always careful to
make sure that the kitchen is cleaner when I'm done brewing than it was when
I started.  This isn't bad policy to clean everything in sight to prevent
infections ANYWAY, and the domestic-relations dividends are a real plus.

Well, other than make sure that the top of your bucket is below the bottom
of your fermentor, I can't think of anything you're doing wrong.  I use the
same technique as you do to start the siphon, and I can siphon all the way
down to the yeast and traub at the bottom of the fermentor (at which point,
I pull the racking cane out to stop the siphon).

I experience the same problem with my basement cooling too much during
the winter months. The lower temps inhibit fermentation of ale yeasts
but are not low enough to properly ferment with most lager strains.
What I did was salvage an old water bed heater complete with thermostat.
I place the heater on the cement floor, with the thermostat laying on
top. I then put a couple of carboys right on the heater. With careful
monitoring of the fermentation temp. the thermostat can be adjusted to
provide just the right amount of heating. If you can find someone who
has given up the old water bed you might get one of these very cheaply.
They probably show up at yard sales or flea markets as well.

Subject: Low/no alcohol beer / Hop oil for bittering


***** from Bruce DeBolt *****


Since my note last week on low/no alcohol I received requests for  
information so will post more details.  


I would suggest this method, or something similar to it as a starting point 
so you don't make a whole batch that isn't to your liking.  I took one 
bottle of an American Pale Ale homebrew (bitter with lots of hop aroma) and:
 - heated in a small stainless steel pot with stirring to 175-180F for about 
10 minutes to drive off most/all of the ethanol (ethanol/water azeotrope 172F)
 - cooled rapidly in a sink of cold water (swirled the contents in the pot to 
drive the cooling faster)
 - poured through a funnel into a 20 oz. PET bottle
 - screwed on the Carbonator Cap (TM) and pressured the bottle to 25 psi with 
CO2 from my keg cylinder
 - shook vigourously, placed in ice water bath
 - bottle will absorb the CO2, you can tell by it becoming "softer".  Repeat 
CO2 addition again at 25 psi and shake again


At this point its just a matter of how long you want to wait, I got good 
carbonation is less than one hour with this method.  On my second attempt I 
only heated the beer at 175-180 for five minutes, with stirrring and the 
flavor was the same as the first attempt.  It had a somewhat background 
taste to some of the mega no alcohol beers but with more hop bitterness and 
more "character".  The pregnant friend consuming it liked it much better than 
her other options.  We added a drop of hop aroma oil to the second bottle to 
improve it slightly.  


I plan to try this with some other styles (stout, brown, etc.) to see which 
ones are most pleasing and will report the subjective results.  Overall I 
didn't like the no alcohol American Ale made above very much but it was 
better than O'Doulls, etc. and I had the option of drinking the unaduterated 
version.  If you don't have access to a CO2 cylinder then try to find 
someone who does.  I got the Carbonator Cap from the local homebrew store.


What was the alcohol content?  I don't know yet.  Someone sent me a private 
note on a Vinometer which is used in wineries to determine alcohol content 
by capillary action(?) and is very cheap.  I accidentally deleted the message.
Can the person who sent this find out if a vinometer is accurate in beer in 
a low/no alocohol range?  We are looking for a gas chromatograph at work to 
do a quick check, but it may be awhile.  From the flavor of the beer made 
above it seemed that there was very little if any alcohol in it, no mental 
affects either.  


The recommendations I've seen elsewhere for a whole batch call for making 
a lower gravity brew from extract, then heating the fermented beer to 
170-180F for some period of time.  This will drive off the alcohol and kill 
all your yeast.  Also watch out that you don't inhale the ethanol you may 
be trying to avoid, one article mentioned the quick buzz that 
occurred from being too close to the pot when it starting evolving vapor.  
Keep in mind you are more subject to infection without the alcohol present, 
so cool the no alcohol concoction rapidly, and mix in  1-2 packs of rehydrated
dry yeast, and priming sugar.  Be especially careful about sanitation.  
Better stir it well before bottling to prevent gushers or worse!  I haven't 
tried this yet, and probably won't since I can make whatever volume I want 
in the PET bottles from existing beer. 


- ------------------------------------------------


Someone asked about hop bitterying teas and said they didn't want to use 
hop oil.  I found hop bittering oil to be quite satisfactory, especially if 
you are dosing individual glasses.  It can also be carried in a pocket and 
used to improve commercial beers when away from home.  Keep it refrigerated, 
it will eventually turn rancid if you don't.  I know someone who has used 
hop oil to adjust a keg and it worked fine, easy to know when to stop.  


At DeFalco's (local homebrew supply store) they call hop bittering oil the 
Shiner Bock Repair Kit, I couldn't agree more.

John, I really don't think this is anywhere near that simplistic.
"Top-fermenting" and "Bottom-fermenting" are, I believe, great
overstatements, or over-generalizations.  If I'm correct all your
analysis is moot.  I just don't think fermenter geometries can be
simplified to this level.

Yes, water.  Take a large trash can that will hold water, and put the carboy
in it.  Fill it to a level that won't make your carboy float, and leave it.
With this water jacket, you'll increase the thermal mass of the system such
that temperature swings will have a negligable affect.  If it is 5 gallons of
extra water, you've doubled the thermal mass; 10 gallons of water jacket and
you've tripled the thermal mass.  Stick a thermometer in the water and I
think you'll see that temperature swings are not an issue anymore.  This
tends to keep the temperature very close to the average, rather than varying
greatly around it.

Some friends of mine are getting together to order some malt in quantity and
I'm looking for suggestions on a good mail order house.  We'll probably end
up with a need for around 10 (55 lb.) bags of Hugh Baird pale ale malt and
we're looking for a good price.  Any suggestions?

to be one of the greatest forums in existence for learning to brew better
beer.  Sorry if you don't like it, but the protein discussion is interesting
to a lot of people.  It has application to lots of brewers who might be
wondering why their head retention isn't up to snuff.  Or, maybe it is
completely without merit, but it is certainly worth discussing.  Beats the

More on John M. Pratte's interesting post concerning Benard cells and

the fluid. Can anybody confirm or deny this assumption?
