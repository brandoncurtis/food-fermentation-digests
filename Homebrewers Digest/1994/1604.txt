        Bruce DeBolt talks about heating beer to 170-180 for ten minutes 
to drive off the alcohol, and wonders exactly what the ETOH content of 
the result is.  Answer:  What was it before you started?  Subtract zero.  
That's right folks, taking a 5% etoh solution and heating it to 180^F 
will not reduce the alcohol content.  If you want to use the boiling 
point of ethanol as a guideline, set up a nice fractionation column 
still, boil your solution, and open the vent when the temp at the outlet is 
at the boiling point of alcohol.  You will find that you have to keep the 
solution boiling for quite a while to extract all the ethanol.  Don't let 
the authorities catch you doing this by the way.  "Honest officer, I

Well after reading all the posts on both HBD and recs.crafts.brewing
about grain mills I decide I have to give my $.02.


As Brett points out about the Kitchen Aid attachment, I agree it
probably is not appropriate for and can't be adjusted to get a grain
crack correct for all grain brewing. It's really designed for flour
making only.


I happen to agree with the results of the crush off which was reported
in BT a couple of issues back. There may be manufacturing quality
differences, but the ones tested can all provide an acceptable crush for
homebrewing.


Many may disagree. As JS pointed out, the group of award winning, BJCP,
MIT engineer homebrewers who performed the test, probably don't
understand how to design a test and didn't want to offend any of the BT
advertisers. ;-)


Just as a data point, I use a motorized Corona. I routinely do 30 pound
grain bills and get close to or theoretical extraction rates with a RIMS
tower system.

Subject: How Spam can improve your beer


I recently read through an article describing the annual Spam and beer
meeting of the Boston Wort Processor homebrew club.  This may seem like
a random event to most of you, but it's no coincidence that several of the
brewers from that club who win awards in the AHA National Competition
are also Spam-lovers.  I was finally able to piece together why they
are able to brew consistently good beers.


Most of our worts, especially extract brews, are low in Free Available
Nitrogem (FAN).  There is some data on this in the Winter issue of
Zymurgy.  The FANs are essentially the amino acids and nitrogenous
compounds that are essential to yeast growth and a healthy fermentation.
Now Spam obviously has an abundance of fatty acids, and these are
also important in the early stages of fermention.  The connection to
the Boston Worts is that not only eat Spam, but they use it in their
*brewing*.  Hence they have none of our standard problems such as
stuck fermentations, long lag times, etc. and are able to produce some
outstanding beers.


Now I urge them to come clean and tell the rest of us how Spam is
used in their brewing.  There's no reason Steve Stroud and the rest
of the Boston group should selfishly keep these secrets!


Cheers,
        Scott

To clear up some questions in today's HBD:


To Manning Martin:


Please note that I did not say stratify when I was talking about 
density variation throughout the fermenter.  Stratification implies 
that there are distinct layers of sugar, water, and alcohol.  I do 
realize that they do mix.  However, this does not release them from 
gravities effects.  Unless by dissolving there are significant 
intermolecular forces to counteract gravity, the heavier elements 
will tend toward the bottom of the fermenter and the lighter toward 
the top.  An idealized version of this occurs in air, which is a 
mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.  Since the 
intermolecular forces are almost nil at atmospheric pressures, carbon 
dioxide tends toward the bottom, displacing a good deal of oxygen.  
We use this fact in brewing to protect our beer from oxygen.  In the 
fermentation tank, intermolecular forces are probably greater than 
they are in air.  However, my experience leads me to believe that 
they are not great enough.  I have gently poured liquid off the top of 
the fermenter (after two weeks), taken a hydrometer reading, siphoned 
the remainder of the beer into a bucket, and taken a second 
hydrometer reading on the liquid from the bucket.  I have found that 
the first reading can be as much as .003 less than the second 
reading, meaning that the alcohol does tend toward the top in the 
fermenter.  While I'll admit that I don't expect to find this to be 
true during the vigorous fermentation stage, it is true as the 
fermentation begins to settle down to a more quiescent stage.


Also regarding the top vs bottom fermenting, I agree that the yeast 
are doing there thing throughout the fermenter.  However, it was my 
understanding (and I'm probably wrong about this) that ale yeast tend 
toward the upper stages of the tank (i.e. there is a greater 
concentration of them there) and lager yeast tend toward the bottom
portion.  I was using this to localize the heat sources toward the 
top and bottom accordingly (A tendency we physicists have.  ex. 
"First, approximate the horse by a sphere of water....").


To Norm Pyle:


I agree Norm.  That's the point that I made at the end of my message. 
This is an extremely complicated system (multicomponent fluid, 
transient heat sources, bubble formation, etc.) and a simple analysis 
is usually incorrect.  However, that does not negate somebody else's 
comment that as long as heat is being produced in the tank, then 
cooling the sides of the tank will create convection for any amount 
of cooling.  Therefore, if you want to insure greater movement in 
your fermetation tank, cool the sides.

Howdy from Zion!


I was watching TV the other day and came across a program on CNN called
"Pinnacles".  The subject of this particular episode was a well-known
producer of the "Best Beer in America"(tm).  It was quite a good show
and showed JK doing a lot of fun guy stuff like serving beer at a
festival, sitting on a dunking tank filled with old beer, having product
meetings at work (drinking beer!), etc.  He came across as a very
affable fellow, and a good spokesman for the anti-megabrew forces.
Obviously there was no mention of lawsuits, etc.  Despite my prejudice
about his character, I was quite impressed with the guy.  An interesting
note: during the sit-down interview part, a barrel of triple-bock could
be seen in the background behind him.  Not what I expected to see in the
offices of a business.  Probably fork-lifted in for the show ;-).


On the subject of smoking grains,  I have to advise against it.  I tried it
once and coughed for 10 minutes!  Yuck!


Hoppy brewing!

Subject: Finally to All-Grain...


Dear HBDers,
 I finally did it! I finally did my first all-grain batch. I've been signing my
correspondence "Future all-grainer" now for about a year in anticipation of 
becoming an all-grainer and this past weekend it happened. I can't say 
everything went perfectly though but I guess these are the fortunes of a 
first-timer. I have done 10 extract batches prior to this all-grain venture 
and I am fairly happy with these extract brews but I always knew that I had to 
take the inevitable plunge into all-graining before I felt that I was truly 
creating my own distict brew rather than a brew from someone else's extract. 
No matter how this turns out I feel now that I have created something all my 
own.
 
 Let me give you some details of my setup. If there are other extract brewers 
interested in going to all-grain I'm sure you'll find this of interest. And to 
you current all-grainers I would like to get some advice from you. I used a 
Phil's latertun set up but I did not use the rotating sparging arm at the 
advice of a co-worker. I just used the white bucket with the false bottom for 
both sparging and for mashing. I kept this bucket in an insulated cardboard 
box during mashing and added hot water for mashout. At sparging time I just 
poured the sparge water over a spoon just keeping the water level about 1 inch 
above the grains at all times. My major problem was that at the time I put my 
mash water and grains in the pail with the false bottom I did not hold the 
false bottom down with a spoon. As a result, my sparge took 2 hours! The wort 
simply trickled into my keg that I use for boiling and I never thought I would 
collect enough wort for boiling. I acually thought that the hose had come 
loose from the false bottom but after the fact I checked and it was still 
intact. Upon lifting up the false bottom I noticed that there were mucho grains 
under it. This is what must've caused the "trickle sparge". Since I could not 
occupy my kitchen any longer with the sparging I ended up getting less wort 
than usual and had to top off with water to get 5 gallons. I really didn't like 
having to top off but I wanted to get 2 cases from 7 hours of beer-making. 


 In an effort to inprove my process and to prevent the "trickle sparge" from 
re-occurring I have been thinking about a way of weighing down the false 
bottom so that the worry of it floating upon adding the mash water and grains 
would be eliminated. Maybe some fairly heavy copper or stainless steel pieces 
put on the edges of the false bottom might do the trick. Any suggestions would 
be more than welcome. Also, since I boil outside in a converted Sankey keg, I 
was out there boiling and wort chilling last night in the dark due to the 
prolonged sparge. Another problem is that I occupied my kitchen in the middle 
of the day to the dismay of my wife. I did this so I would have daylight to 
boil and wort chill outside. A friend of mine (who also has a wife and 2 kids) 
has solved this problem by doing the whole process in his house after the kids 
go to bed. He does this by using a Bru-Heat and wort chills using his inside 
faucet. He uses the same setup as I do other than that. It seems to me that 
an investment in a Bru-Heat would solve a lot of problems for me. The main 
problem being that I am in the way when I brew beer during the day and I don't 
get the chance to spend the time with my kids if I do. I could start the mash 
around 6:00 PM and by the time the kids are ready for bed I would be ready to 
sparge. I would like to hear a little more about the Bru-Heat before I make 
the $100 investment. I have read a few postings mentioning that they may 
impart a plastic taste to the beer. Well, FWIW, I tasted my friend's Pete's 
Wocked Ale clone and I tasted no plastic. I would really like to hear more 
about the Bru-Heat from both satisfied and non-satisfied customers. It just 
seems like it would make my life a whole lot easier. Also any ideas on 
weighing down the false bottom on the Phil's latuer tun would be greatly 
appreciated. 


 I look forward to brewing my next all-grain batch with this first-time 
experience out of the way. Even though it turned out to be a lengthy process I 
feel more excited about brewing beer now than I ever had previously with 
my extract beers. After all of the problems with this first-time all-grain 
beer I can guarantee you that the final product will be superior to my extract 
brews. I will keep you posted. Please email any Bru-Heat info or false bottom 
solutions to me at bessette`at`uicc.com. TIA.

Subject:       Convection/cold ale yeast/FOOP flame


Greetings everyone.
It seems to me that the recent discussions about fermenter 
geometry and the effect of temperature distributions on convective 
vigor in the fermenter have been missing something, namely that the 
buoyant forces exerted by bubble-laden wort are far greater than 
those due to the amount of thermal expansion produced by temperature 
differences of a few degrees.  Non-uniform distribution of bubbles, 
which can arise randomly, produces "blobs" of wort more bubble-rich 
than their surroundings and hence more buoyant, so they rise as blobs. 
Loss of bubbles at the wort surface produces other bubble-deficient 
blobs which are denser than the rest of the liquid and therefore 
sink.  I'm somewhat fluid dynamically impaired so can't offer
any quantitative predictions, but suggest that these effects are most 
marked at overall high bubble concentrations, i.e. when the ferment 
is at maximum activity and the rate of gravity drop is highest.  If 
you have an open fermenter, part the foam at high krausen and watch 
the surface of the wort; it moves and seethes, looking truly alive.  
This is because blobs of wort are being dragged around by virtue of 
their transient bubble contents.  The wort is thoroughly mixed on a 
short time-scale, and the effect of any temperature gradient 
across the fermenter will be swamped.  This is not true during 
secondary fermentation, when the overall bubble contents are much 
less and bubble motions are largely decoupled from the wort, i.e. 
bubbles rise through near-stationary liquid.  In secondary, 
temperature gradients should play a more important role in governing 
convective motions in the fermenter.
- ------------------------------------------------------
Chris Goll asked about ale yeasts that might work below 60 
Fahrenheit.  I've had a pale ale fermenting with Wyeast 1028 London 
Ale for 2 weeks in an ambient temperature of 55-60 F; the only time 
the wort temperature went above 60F was during high krausen in 
primary. It's slow, of course.  Wyeast ???? Scotch Ale also comes 
recommended for low temperatures.
- ------------------------------------------------------
While I'm here, to the individual who found the protein denaturing 
thread to be absurd, useless, and the last straw, all I can say is 
that I found it fascinating and I suspect that many others did too. 
If it weren't for the human passion to know how and why things work 
the way they do, none of us would be brewing beer worth talking about 
in the first place.

Subject: virus ranting, newbie lager H2S question


Hi brewers!


I hate to start off my first post with a flame but:  enough of the "good 
times" virus stuff already!!!  Point taken: its a hoax, you can't erase 
your HD by reading mail.  On with brewtalk.


I'm working on my fourth beer, a darkish lager (Sam Adams(TM) clone? 
gasp!) from extract.  I used Wyeast American Lager strain, popped, 
started, and pitched around 75F as per packet instructions.  
Unfortunately, I lowered the temperature too quickly once fermentation 
began and shocked the yeasties into 2 days of dormancy.  Thereafter, 
fermentation proceeded normally and is about finished now, 4 days after 
it restarted.  Here's my problem:  I'd like to lager in the bottle, but 
when I opened the fermenter to take a hydrometer reading, I could smell 
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) fairly strongly.  I use plastic buckets for 
fermenting and bottling and don't want to have to add a carboy secondary 
because I plan on moving soon and don't want to cart it around.  What 
went wrong?  How can I get rid of the smelly stuff without investing in a 
carboy secondary?  Possibilities I can envision:  (1) rack off from sediment 
and other nasties into bottling bucket (having purged O2 with CO2), clean 
fermenter, rack back into fermenter (purged with CO2) and reseal, or (2) 
bubble CO2 through the stuff before bottling in hopes of carrying H2S away.  
Any suggestions?

I agree that temperature may be another unconstrained variable, and, if you'll
recall, my original contention was that there were too many variables in the
experiment to draw any conclusions.  So in effect, we agree then, that it is
difficult to tell which variables caused the difference in speed of the ferment
and difference in FG.  Finally, I'm afraid you got the data backwards... the
blowoff batch went *slower* and had a higher FG.

A week or so ago I posted a request for help stemming from the
lack of activity in my airlock.  Thanks to all those who replied.


As most of you were able to guess, my fermentor is plastic.  
Anyway things have worked out just fine.  I bottled the beer when
the gravity reading leveled off at 1.010 (by the way, the samples
tasted fine and I will continue to taste hydrometer samples in
the future).  I received many good suggestions about this batch
and things to consider for future projects as well.

Subject:      High Gravity Brewing


I was wondering if anyone could comment on the practice of high gravity brewing
 .  I know commercial brewers use the technique quite a bit because of economic
concerns, but I am wondering if it has a place in homebrewing.


    I am thinking that I would use high gravity brewing to avoid the blowoff
hassles that I often get when brewing ales (especially wheat ales) in carboys.
I figure I could leave about a 2 gallon headspace if I brew a extract or
partial mash ale and not worry about blowoff hoses, etc.


    But, the ultimate question is:  will high gravity brewing affect
the taste of the finished beer?

The half inch blow-off tube on yours makes me just a tad nervous,
anything smaller I would really worry about catastrophic failure. With
the carboy upside down, best case failure you dump the whole 5 gallons
on the floor as opposed to blowing the cork and a couple gallons out the
top. And it seems a lot more likely that you will have the worst case, a
5 gallon glass grenade.

Indeed, Lindemans is a sweetened product.  I also wanted to point out

and that tradition and loyalty take a back seat to whatever their marketing 
departments say.  If you were impressed by Bellevue, you would have been

is one of the most traditional lambik breweries and as such, may not be
your cup of beer, but in the grand scheme of things, Lindemans and Bellevue
beers have more in common than do Bellevue and Cantillon or Bellevue and Boon.

Subject: Australian Ale Yeast


Ronald Dwell asks about the Australian Ale Yeast in winter.
I believe that the Australian Ale yeast was originally cloned
from Coopers Sparkling Ale. This beer is very popular here
amongst homebrewers as you can easily go to the bottleshop
and buy your yeastbank! If the strain still behaves in the
same manner I do not think you will find that it works very 
well below 18C (65F). It is in fact, a favourite here to use in 
summer as it tolerates heat quite well.
If Ronald wants to buy a heater I find the best  is a fish-tank 
heater. These are pretty cheap and simple, and can
be set for pretty well whatever temperature you like.
Another option is to go for yeast strains that work at
the ambient temperatures at that time of year. For
example, amongst the Wyeast Ale range, 1007 (German
ale), 1728 (Scottish ale) and 2565 (Kolsch) are 
reputed to work as low as 55F.

   4# honey
   3# dark brown sugar
   2 packages red star champagne yeast
 
   Mix & pitch (no heat, no campden)
 
went from OG 1.096 to SG .993 in less than 3 weeks.  Very harsh taste when I
racked it about a month ago.  Tasted it last Saturday night with some
friends and it was already much improved, crystal clear, and a nice color
from the brown sugar.  I was expecting to bottle it around April, but it may
not need that much time (I'm lazy, it may get it anyway).

If you had done this experiment with the same yeast strain, I think we might
have something to compare.  Also, You need to make sure that you are using
the same "age" yeast, i.e. not a 1-month-old versus a 2-month-old, etc.
There are other factors (not just time-to-start) that should be considered
when deciding when is the right time to pitch a starter, for example diacetyl
production, final gravity, time-to-ferment, alcohol tolerance, just to name
a few.  The article that Mike Sharp brought to my attention, which stated
clearly that the "proper" time to pitch a starter is post-hi-kraeusen, is
titled:


 Impact of Yeast-Handling Procedures on Beer Flavor Development During

Notice that time-to-start is not directly mentioned here (it may be tied to
"yeast growth" but it's not clear how) and that the quality of the fermentation
is the main point.


The bottom line really is that these researcher's data indicates that the
most healthy ferments are achieved using high-glycogen yeast.  The yeasts'
glycogen levels are highest during the stationary phase (post high kraeusen),
but note that even 8 hours after the start of the stationary phase (at room
temperature, I believe --  I don't have the paper with me here) the glycogen
levels have begun to decrease substantially.

First of all, I'd like to commend Rich for the effort of typing in the

>0111   Spicy   OTW   Allspice, nutmeg, peppery, eugenol. See also 1003 Vanilla


eugenol is clearly a clove aroma and belongs in Category 5 along with
the other phenolics.

>        or cask.
> 
>0173   Hop oil   OT   Flavor imparted by addition of distilled hop oil.


I have a big problem with them lumping all of the different hop aromatics
into four categories.  Clearly the citrusy "grapefruit" aroma of Cascades
is nothing like the resiny aroma of East Kent Goldings or the earthy
aroma of Fuggles.  If they can tell the difference between "Dry-hop" and
"Hop oil" then I think that they should be able to differentiate hop varieties.
What I'm saying really is, that these four categories are useless and the
actual hop aroma (earthy, resiny, citrusy, etc.) should be used in stead.


>Class 5 - Phenolic


Again, no mention of clove aroma, i.e. 4-vinyl-guaiacol, or smoky, two
*pleasant*, positive pheonlic aromas.


>0505   Iodoform   OT   Iodophors, hospital-like, pharmaceutical.


I've smelled both dilute and concentrated Iodophor and do not feel that
it has any medicinal or phenolic aroma.


>0722   Mercaptan   OT   Lower mercaptans, drains, stench
 
>0724   Lightstruck   OT   Skunky, sunstruck


Note that both the compound in beer and in skunk scent is, in fact,
a mercaptan, so why should these be separate?


>0733   Cooked tomato   OT   Tomato juice (processed), tomato ketchup.


Ketchup contains vinegar and to me, acetic acid is a dominant aromatic
component in ketchup.  I don't feel it belongs here under 0733.


>0830   Leathery   OT   A later stage of staling, then often 
>        used in conjunction with 0211 Woody.


Leathery is often used to describe oak-aged beers, not surprisingly, since
leather is (or at least used to be) tanned with tannins extracted from oak.
It is not always due to staling and is a welcome component in lambiks, for
example.


I felt it important to add my opinions here just to point out that, IMO, this
table is not 100% correct and contradictions like the eugenol problem will
only confuse inexperienced readers.

Here's the scenario...


I'm scrolling the HBD, via a modem/terminal set up in my bedroom.  My 
roommate, who has a similar set-up in his room, and who shares the modem 
line with me, tries to log on.  He is denied, and a random generation of 
characters and commands begins flashing on my screen.  One of these 
commands is the reply command, and so a reply to the current message I'm 
reading is composed.  Then, this random generation of characters enters a 
"y" before an "n", of course to the "include original message in reply" 
prompt.  At about this time I realize what is happening and start 
pressing the "n" key frantically, trying to break through the random 
generation and respond to the "send message?" prompt, and it flashes on 
the screen a few times, apparently not receiving either of the answers 
that it expects.  But then, to my great dismay...the "sending message" 
line I feared.  


In retrospect, I realize that I should have flicked off the modem switch, 
but this all happened in the course of about 15-20 seconds, the first 10 
of which I spent yelling to my roommate that I'd be off in a moment.  I 
did send a message to the request address explaining what had occurred, 
but there's no way for me to know whether it was sent in time to do 
anything.  Now, if the message was caught and removed from today's

a message in today's digest, please don't flame me.  I apologize.  
Unreservedly. 


Yes, I am relatively new to the digest, and the internet for that matter,

on my part.  Sorry for any inconveniences.

If there isn't, there should be.  Sounds like you have been taken in by 
some of the sloppy terminology in Papazian's books.  Sparging refers 
EXACTLY and SPECIFICALLY to rinsing malted grains after the mash with hot 
water to extract the wort.  This word comes from the great German brewing 
tradition which some of us here in the Upper Midwest still practice...


Running your wort through a strainer AFTER the boil is NOT sparging.  It 
is a crude form of filtering.

When making oatmeal stout, get the temperature of the oatmeal to the mash 
temperature _before_ you dump it into the mash, as it has tremendous
thermal capacity and will screw up your strike temperature in a big way.
I use one pound (dry weight) for every five gallons of intended wort.
For my typical 15 gal. run, this is a _big_ family pot of gloop.  Hit your 
strike temperature with the grains and stabilize.  Then add the mess from
hell to the top of the mash and gently work it in.  My material of

     I plan to upgrade the thermostat on my hot liquor tank.  Currently the 
tank is constructed from a sankey keg and has a thermostat from a hot
water heater mounted on the side which controls the electric water 
heater element inside the tank.  This thermostat is not very accurate
and I have a hard time reaching / holding a specific temperature.  I think 
the poor conductivity of heat through stainless steel is part of the 
problem.
     I plan to install a circulation pump to get a more even temperature 
throughout the tank and would like to install a sensor in the circulation
loop to control the element.  Does anyone know were I can purchase a
thermister and control circuit to accomplish this?  I would prefer a pre 
made unit, but circuit plans would be acceptable.  If anyone is interested
in building and selling a circuit, please E-mail me.
