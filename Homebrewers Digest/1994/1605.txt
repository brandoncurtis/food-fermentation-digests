I have a strainer thingie that has an elastic hemmed in it, and it
goes over the top of your fermenting bucket like a hair net.  Works
great for dumping the wort into the fermenter.  Much more surface area
than the disk in a funnel.  I've just bought a 7 gal carboy, and when
I brew my next batch tonight, I was going to put the strainer over the
top of my funnel, plus use the disk inside for a 2 level strain.
This will also allow me to remove & de-sludge to net strainer without
risking stuff falling in.  I'll post again with results of this
experiment tomorrow.

Subject: "Sparging"




Lee Kirkpatrick wonders about the term "Sparging"
        Sparging means rinsing.  One can sparge the grains during the
lautering process, or one can sparge the hops to rinse them clean of
wort.  So you were both wrong.  Pouring wort through a strainer is not
sparging, though pouring hot water through the hops in the strainer is.
The term sparging is often synonomized with lautering, but in reality
sparging is only part of the lautering process.

Subject: Fruit and Holiday beers


        All this talk of fruit and holiday beers has me wondering in
anyone has included fruit in the mash?  One problem with adding fruit is
the pectin it contributes, especially if added at the end of the boil
(which may be done to prevent the infection that could occur if th efruit
is added to the fermenter...).  If fruit is mixed in with the mash and a
long protein rest is performed, is the pectin degraded?  (In case you have
concerns about how boiling will affect the fruit flavour, I am thinking
about cranberries which are often boiled prior to consumption.)  So, has
anyone done a fruit mash?

Becky,


        I have been using the dishwasher to sanitize bottles for years.
However, the dishwashers I have had (in apartments) during this time
would not really do a good job of cleaning bottles with caked on yeast
sediment.  You may want to try a few in yours to see if your dishwasher
works better.  Once you get them clean, the dishwasher will do a fine job
of sanitization for bottling.

<pH meter specifications snipped>


I hope you have better luck with this Oaktron model than I had.  After having
two Oaktron pHTestr 2 meters, I've come to the conclusion that if it doesn't
have a replacable electrode, it's terminal from day one.  The first one I
bought, didn't work from the get-go, so I just went back to the store and
traded it in; no big deal.  The second one worked for about 5 batches (brewed
over a 6 month period--hey, I was finishing a degree and didn't have a whole
lot of spare time) before becoming wildly inaccurate due to electrode failure.
Yes, I followed the instructions as to how to store the electrode to no avail.
I've drawn some personal conclusions about meters:


1.)  Temperature compensation is uneccessary for home brewing because it only
     takes a few seconds to drop a sample to the same temperature as the
     calibration solution using an ice bath.  Hell, where I live, I just
     use a tap-water bath.


2.)  Meters with non-replacable electrodes are useless for the long haul.
     One caveat here:  They may last a fairly long time if you disregard
     Oaktron's instructions and fill the electrode cap with some electrode
     storage solution available from Cole-Parmer.  I haven't tried this; it's
     just a guess.


3.)  Buy a meter that accepts a BNC type connector so that you can replace
     the electrode when it gets tired.  Another benefit to this is that the
     quality of a separate electrode seems to be of much higher quality than
     the built-in ones.


4.)  Keep the electrode in electrode storage solution between uses.




Here's my current system, recommended by Steve Dempsey (steved`at`longs.lance.
colostate.edu) that I'm very happy with.  I purchased it from
Cole-Parmer (800) 323-4340.  It consists of:


AY-59000-40 pH Tester, BNC (BNC is the connector for the electrode) $49.50
G-05992-20 General purpose BNC electrode with 3' lead               $46.00
           (I bought a coiled lead; a straight lead is cheaper)
G-05990-90 Probe Saver Bottle                                       $ 5.00
G-05664-00 pH storage solution (highly recommended)                 $ 9.75
G-05977-12 pH calibration capsules, pH 4.0                          $ 6.50
G-05977-14 pH calibration capsules, pH 7.0                          $ 6.50


Now, I've seen the same meter and electrode at the Beverage People.  The
meter was $10.00 higher there, but the electrode was $10.00 cheaper.  Go
figure!  I know this seems like a lot for a meter, but, trust me, anything
cheaper won't last.  This meter will last a lifetime; however, you might
have to replace the electrode down the road a few years (if you keep it
in the storage solution, it may last a LONG time).  Also, this is not a
temp-compensated meter (see above).


Also, once you dial in your water for various styles, the meter really
becomes less important (unless, of course, your water varies over the year).


Bottom line:  Buy the best meter you can find in the price range you are
              wanting to stay within.  (Meters range from ~$30.00 - hundreds)
              All in all, I've spent about $140.00 on my meter, electrode,
              and peripherals.  It's a meter that will serve my needs for
              a long time.  I realize it's a lot of money for some folks,
              but you have to pay your dues to measure the pH of the ooze.




Hope this helps,

From: "Lee A. Menegoni" <lmenegoni`at`nectech.com>
Subject: Diacetyl rests


Diacetyl rests are typically done after primary fermentation prior to the
lagering phase.  The diacetyl rest is done at the point when most of the
sugars have been fermented at that time the yeast will reduce the diacetyl
it created in the early stages of fermentation.  Since the rate of
reduction is temperature dependent 24-48 hours 5-10 F degrees above
fermentation temp will result in a dramatic reduction in diacetyl level.
One advantage to this is that it can reduce lagering time.


A good article on diacetyl creation and reduction appeared in Brewing
Techniques a year or so ago, it was by George Fix.  An interesting point
that he documented was how subsequent generations of certain yeast strains
are subject to creating more diacetyl than they can later reduce.  I have
indirectly heard from a noted author and brew pub operator that this
diminished diacetyl reduction effect may be due to under airaition
of wort.

From: Bob Paolino               Research Analyst
Subject: ring around the collar / oak chips / bottle washing


Chris Cooper asks about his ring around the collar:


It's not necessarily an infection.  Some spices, ingredients with oils, and
other additives have a tendency to float to the top and stick to the bottle at
that level.  I don't _know_ what you have, but I wonder if it might be from 
the
oak chips.


Speaking of oak chips....


Why do people use them?  From what I've read, the reason for which people use
them (in classic pale ales) has been pretty much discredited, that, yes, those
beers were aged in oak barrels, but it probably would have been considered a
defect if the beer had actually taken on very much of the flavour of the wood.
Certainly anything I've tasted/judged that had used oak chips was way overdone
for whatever character the brewer had hoped to achieve.It really isn't
pleasant, although it's possible that it could be nice if used _very_
sparingly.  Can anyone tell me/HBD about it?


Rebecca Myers asks about washing bottles in the dishwasher:


I run my empties with the dishes, but I make sure that I give them a good 
rinse
before loading them.  I certainly don't leave anything on the bottom, even if
the dishwasher _might_ be able to take care of it.  When I unload the dishes, 
I
store the bottles away where they can await being refreshed with the sacred
beverage.  Then on bottling day, the clean bottles go into the dishwasher all
by themselves for a sanitation run.  NO detergent this time, a bit of bleach
(it's probably redundant, but a nice security blanket), and the heat dry
setting.The dishwasher isn't going to relieve you from brushing out scummy
bottles (cleaning), but it is going to make bottling day (sanitising) a lot
more convenient--and effective--than soaking and rinsing bottles manually.


Now go have a beer,

something called a phTestr2) for about $65-70. Look at Great
Fermentations, LaMotte (testing equip/chemical company) 800-344-3100,
also any aquarium catalog company for possible good deals.
Admittedly, it's been a few months since I did this exercise, so my
prices may be stale and I don't know what the psTestr3 adds over the
2. It could be worth it.

Just a hint. The Wort Guard from William's brewing (lets you safely
blast CO2 wherever you desire) is no more that a "blowgun" or
"airgun" for compressed air use. I found mine at the local swap meet
for $3, with fittings. A new one can be had for $6 at Home Depot.
With the cost of fittings and hose, you should be able to have one
for <$10, not $20-$30.

Subject: extended mash questions


I have a question for the brewing chemistry gods here on the HBD. I understand
the process and the reasons for step mashing. But I would like to know the
effects of skipping a particular stage, as well as the effects of having a
particular stage continue too long. For instance, an acid rest at approx. 100F
is intended to create the optimum pH in the mash. If this rest is skipped,
perhaps the pH will be too high. If I extend this rest for too long, will the
resultant mash pH be too low? A protein rest at 122F is intended to break down
chains of soluable proteins. If I eliminate this step, I imagine that I'll get
chill haze, or evidence of protein. If this step is continued too long, do I
break down all of the proteins? I imagine this would affect mouth feel and 
head
retention. At saccharification temperatures, what would happen if the rest
went on too long? Surely the starch will be completely converted. Would more
fermentable sugars be made from the longer dextrins?


In a post from 18 August, George Fix has a tantilizing tidbit of information.
He writes:


>Note - I now feel (with Narziss) that the time spent in the

A simple translation for the Centegrade impaired shows this recommendation
to avoid long rests at 110-130F if using highly modified malt. Reading
Randy Mosher's book (and others) leads one to believe that this rest is
necessary. Perhaps it's the 'if highly modified malt is used' that is the
out. Less well modified malt requires this rest.


But back to my original question. What if I leave the mash at these temps
too long? Any takers? What other mashes are used and why?

I think this started with Charlie P.  I take sparging to mean rinsing wort
from grain.  It is a stretch, IMHO, to use it to mean rinsing wort from hops,
but a minor stretch.  I don't think you'll find concensus, but I would bet
the majority would be a little confused by "sparging" to remove hops.

I think you're mixing the idea of chemicals freely floating in a liquid with
them being bound up in the flower of the hop plant.  The mechanical action of
the boil certainly helps to a great degree to burst lupulin glands and to
"shake" the alpha acids free from the plant itself.  Beyond that I would
say that the mechanical action adds little, but kinetic energy is still added
energy, which should in theory help along a chemical reaction.

Subject: "Good Times Lambic?"


Folks:


I'm writing this as a warning to others who may have had the
misfortune of recieving the so-called "Good Times" letter.  A week or
so ago, in preparation for brewing a batch of ale, I was using a
brewer's spreadsheet on my computer to design the recipe.  While I was
doing so, the computer beeped, indicating a mail message had come in.
I switched over to my mail program and read it (ain't multi-tasking
great?). Well, you guessed it, the message was named "Good Times", and
had an AOL return address.  Without thinking, I downloaded and read
the message, which looked like gobbledeygook to me.  I switched back
to the spreadsheet and finished the recipe, which I brewed that day.


Now, this beer has behaved quite differently in the fermenter. Small,
purplish-white flecks floated to the surface. I'm always quite careful
about sanitation, but I'm beginning to think this beer might be
infected. There's definitely something in here besides the ale yeast
which I pitched.


Having caught up on a few days worth of HBD, I realize now that that
"Good Times" message was probably a virus, and I never should have
read it.  So, what I'm wondering is, could the good times virus have
gotten into my brew, since I was working on the brewer's spreadsheet
at the same time I was reading mail?  Now, I'm no computer expert, nor
a virologist, but I do watch a lot of Sci-Fi, so I think I have a
pretty good grasp of what's technically feasible and what isn't. It
seems as though this "cross-platform" infection is probably what
happened.


BTW, the brew is not half bad, in fact, I'd say it tastes "DY - NOOOOO
 - MITE!!"  It has kind of a "funky" taste I've only experienced once
before, a few years back when I brewed my "Michelangelo's Ale", in
commemoration of the late artist's birthday.  Since this brew probably
contains some non-Sacharomyces type critters, I'm thinking about
calling it a "Good Times Lambic".  What do you think?

excessive tannin extraction can occur when mash/sparge temps are too high,
or when you sparge too much, either during wort recirculation, or trying to
extract the last little bit f the sugars out of the grain.


keep you mash temps below 165, and watch your sparge temps. stop sparging
after the runoff gravity falls below 1.005 or the wort runs fairly clear (if
you are lazy like me..)


tannins are very common in wine making, and can give a pleasant woody flavor
to wine once they are aged properly. I would say that it would take you1-2
years to realize the efforts of excessive tannin extraction.the only proper
vehicle for this would be barley wine, or imperial stout, or some types of
belgian ales.


make sure you have an excessive tannin problem before you call it such.
tannin can be described as a harsh, husky or grainy flavor in beer. it
sometimes tastes just like a drink made of burnt grain husks.

make sure you keep the carboy blocked over so that no light can hit the
beer, there would be enough UV and other light wavelengths coming from a
lightbulb that long term exposure would be harmful to the beer.

uhhh, wouldnt quiet racking of relatively oxygen depleted beer already be
sufficient to displace any oxygen? its not like the gas  would magically

just be sure and displace the headspace with c02 and you should be ok..

I have to disagree.  Whether you add Cold Water to Hot Wort or Hot Wort to 
Cold
Water, You are STILL exposing Hot Wort to oxygenated water. Oxidation WILL
occur.
Yes, if you aren't splashing the effect is less; the point is you are still
doing it. And Yes, if you need to compensate for really cold water, chilling 
to
90F and then adding the water will result in minimal oxidation.


If you want to brew using the Best practice, then cool below 80 first before
adding water or pouring. If your water is too cold, then boil some first and
add that to the fermenter to bring the temp up. I routinely pitch my ale 
yeasts
at fermentation temperatures these days. 65F. As long as you have a healthy
starter you shouldnt experience any longer of a lag time.

(whoops - Jim sez something similar just after)


If using a plastic bucket to ferment in, life is simpler. Aquarium heaters are
about 1 foot long and 1" wide, encased with glass, with a rubber seal at the
top. Luckily fish like to live at the same temperature that beer does (or a 
bit
warmer, but the range includes beer temps), and aquariums are sort of the
same size as fermenters, so these heaters are perfect for us! Temperature
control is by a dial on the top. If you cut a hole to fit the rubber bit in 
the
lid of
your fermenter, the heater will naturally dip down into the beer. Seal the 
thing
with silastic, from the top (outside). Direct temperature control is then
pretty
simple. If you have 2 lids or 2 fermenters (summer and winter: one with 
heater,
one without), life is easy! I use this technique and recommend it. The glass
heater is easy to sanitise but it is a bit fragile, so be careful!
If using a carboy, you could do something as Bob suggests. I would not
like to have the whole heater inside the carboy with the beer, as the top
is not waterproof (for the temperature dial), the rubber not foodgrade,
and beer is pretty unpredictable stuff, and could easily flow over the top
of the whole thing, causing all sorts of problems! You could, I suppose,
modify your carboy's rubber stopper, but I doubt it is large enough. Also
you must ensure the part of the heater with the coil is surrounded by beer
for it to work.

Subject: First all-grain, help! + hints to others


I'll briefly describe my first all-grain mash/sparge so that, as well
as helping other all-grain wannabees, the experts can hopefully explain
what was, to me anyway, a surprise.


I used 6.5 lb Vienna, 2.25 lb 2-row, and .75 lb chocolate which the shop
crushed with an industrial strength coffee grinder where they had adjusted
the widths of opposing plates for grain crushing (supposedly no blades
involved).  I put 12.5 quarts of 166 F water in my plastic bucket
mash/lauter tun with false bottom.  I had dissolved 2/3 tsp gypsum in this
mash water.  The temperature stabilized at about 152 F after adding the
grain.  I wrapped the mash tun in a down sleeping bag and blanket and 1
1/4 hours later the temp. had dropped 1 degree or less.


My surprise came when I began the ominous sparge.  The regular
discussions about lengthy, slow, and stuck sparges had me worried.  My
question is: WHY WAS MY SPARGE SO FAST AND EASY?!  I kept the lauter
tun mostly insulated and lifted it onto my counter.  When I opened the
valve, the initial runnings jetted out.  I recirculated about 7-8
quarts and then began to collect.  Throughtout the process, the flow
never slowed--I was collecting it faster than I could add it (manually
with a 1 quart measuring cup)!  What happened to the 1-2 hour slow
trickling I've heard about?!  I used 170 F sparge water that had 2/3
tsp gypsum dissolved in it.


I stopped when I had collected approximately 5.5 gal of wort.  The
runnings were still at 1.020 at 75 F.  After boiling (in 2 kettles) I
had about 4 gal of 1.053 wort.  Does this mean I'm getting 22 pts/lb?
How could I be more effective at flushing out all the sugars that are
evidently still in the 1.020 runnings?  Maybe by slowing the sparge by
not opening the drain valve fully?


Other first-time all-grainer's experiences helped me so I'll pass along
a few of my hints.


1.  Cost is not an issue: I got my 5-gal mash/lauter tun from the local
Chinese restaurant.  I took a second one and cut out the bottom,
drilled hundreds of small holes in it, and used it as the false
bottom.  For $1.69 I bought a hose barb (they'll show you at the
hardware store if you don't know) and 2 washers.  Attach siphon tubing
and a $1.25 flow restrictor from the brew store and your mash/lauter
tun is done.  With the sleeping bag, I can't believe an expensive Gott
cooler is any better.


2.  Don't worry if you don't have a big kettle: You can either use less
grain and make smaller batches or boil in 2 kettles (which is what I
did since I got more wort than I expected).


3.  Don't need a wort chiller if you don't have one: Set the kettle in
a container of cold water, turn the hose on low, set the hose in the
water, and let the slow, constant flow (and occasional stirring) cool
the wort very effectively.


Thanks everyone for all the great info discussed on hdb!

In response to Rich's request for corrections:
Wyeast 1028 is not Youngs yeast.  It is reportedly originally from a bottle

Also, I too had heard that 1098 is the Whitbread strain, but recent

I've done have cast doubt (at least in my mind) on whether this is true (based
upon the ester and higher alcohol levels in Whitbread and beer made with
Wyeast British Ale yeast).
