 >That's right folks, taking a 5% etoh solution and heating it to 180^F
 will not reduce the alcohol content. 
 
 Perhaps I am missing something here but this seems to contradict much 
 practical evidence to the contrary.  Could be because I do not know what etoh 
 means?  I heated beer to 170F for 30 minutes and sent the samples to Cornell 
 along with a before sample and the alcohol content was roughly cut in half.
 
 How can you suggest that nothing will evaporate when a liquid is heated?  In 
 fact, if you leave the beer sit around long enough at room temp, you will 
 achieve the same results, viz., the alcohol will evaporate faster than the 
 water.

 I agree also except that the quality differences happen to be significant but 
 were ignored and this made the article worse than boring.  It was dishonest.  
 If the only difference was quality, then this should have been the emphasis, 
 not the boring sieve testing.
 
 > As JS pointed out, the group of award winning, BJCP,
 MIT engineer homebrewers who performed the test, probably don't
 understand how to design a test and didn't want to offend any of the BT
 advertisers. ;-)
 
 I don't recall pointing that out but if you had seen the original report they 
 submitted to Zymurgy you would understand how inane your attempt at humor is.
 
 The report submitted to Zymurgy by the "award winning, BJCP, MIT engineer 
 homebrewers" was the sleaziest piece of journalistic rubbish I have ever read 
 and it was rewritten, edited and re-edited several times under threat of 
 legal action from yours truly.
 
 I won't bore you (maybe I will sometime) with the whole original report but 
 here is just one example of unbiased journalism produced by MIT BJCP 
 wizzards...
 
 The following are the opening sentences of the paragraphs introducing each of 
 the three mills....
 
 
 "The Glatt Malt Mill is mostly constructed of sheet metal and formed steel 
 plates with an approximate weight of 10 pounds.  All metal parts are finished 
 with a bright yellow enamel paint"......
 
 
 "The Philmill is mostly constructed of electroless-nickel plated steel with a 
 red-oak mounting board and weighs approximately 5 lbs".....
 
 
 "The Maltmill is mostly constructed of fiber board and weighs approximately 
 16 pounds.".....
 
 Now I don't wish to be contentious but words do mean something and when 
 something that weighs 16 lbs is described as "mostly constructed of fiber 
 board" I would not expect it to contain 14 lbs of steel, aluminum and bronze.
 
 The major fiberboard part is the base which the "bright yellow enamel" mill 
 does not even provide much less make it out of steel as one would be led to 
 believe and the one made out of "red-oak" is only somewhat larger than a 
 postage stamp.
 
 There are dozens of similar examples of objective, unbiased journalism and 
 meticulous attention to details by the engineers from MIT in their report.
 
 The published version was edited enough to mitigate my wrath to the point of 
 calling off the lawyers and I settled for simply writing a letter to the 
 editor and declining continued support for the AHA.
 
 Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to clear the air.

it needs to be rinsed.  I *must* apologize for the novice/redundant

Subject: Brue-Heat and Phil's Phalse bottom...


Fellow HBDers,
 I recently posted to the HBD about my first all-grain batch and had a few 
questions about the Phil's false bottom and the Bru-Heat. To re-cap, I had a 
"trickle sparge" as I called it with my first all-grain batch due to the 
Phil's false (phalse) bottom lifting up when I doughed in my mash water and 
grains. As a result, mucho grains ended up beneath the false bottom which 
let to the "trickle sparge". I also had some questions about the Bru-Heat. I 
had heard that there was some concern that a plastic taste could be imparted 
to the beer. 
 Well, I want to thank the MANY responses I got to my questions/concerns and 
the many encouraging words about my venture to the all-grain process. First I 
would like to say that the overwhelming concensus about the Bru-Heat is that 
it DOES NOT impart any plastic taste to the beer due to the fact that the 
plastic is food grade. It was also suggested by many that using it for mashing
was not recommended but there were some who did use it for mashing. It was  
better suited for heating sparge water and for boiling. Also it was 
recommended to buy the 220V style since it will be very difficult to achieve a 
boil with the 110V. This could be a problem though because you would have to 
use a 220V outlet such as your stove or dryer. I can easily access my stove 
plug via the drawer for the pans under my stove. All in all, I heard from many 
very happy and long-time users of the Bru-Heat and I am seriously considering 
it at least for heating sparge water and for boiling indoors.


 My other issue was the Phil's false bottom lifting up and getting the grains 
underneath. It was very nice to hear that there are many others out there who 
had similar experiences. Most of the suggestions were to just hold the false 
bottom down with a spoon until the grains are holding it down. One very 
innovative idea came from jeff humphreys who had this suggestion:


>To prevent my false bottom from rising up, I use 3/8" copper
>tubing (instead of plastic tubing) to run from the false bottom to the spigot
>on my gott cooler. The rigidity prevents floating. Weights will slide around
>while stirring the mash (tried that). The copper tubing is connected to the
>false bottom with a 1" piece of siphon tubing . A standard #2 drilled rubber
>stopper fits over the copper tubing and into the back of most 1" plastic
>faucets available at homebrew shops everywhere. I also use a "gasket" made of
>siphon tubing slit down the middle that fits around the circumference of the
>false bottom to prevent grain from slipping under the f.b.
 
This solution seemed to make the best sense to me because I would not have 
to worry about the false bottom rising up as a result and could concentrate on 
the grains. 


 I just want to thank all who responded to me. I realize that I have moved 
into a new realm of the brewing world now that I have gone all-grain. I have 
no intentions of going back to the extract method and I hope by my posting to 
the net there will be others out there who will move to all-grain. Thanks 
again and I'll let everyone know how the "trickle sparge" brew comes out. BTW, 
it is bubbling away and smells wonderful. It's certainly nice to know I have 
some fermentables there...

I have not tried this myself because I have not yet started to keg, but I 
did find out something that might work.  While at my local homebrew 
store, I noticed that the threads for the CO2 cartridge holder were 
similar to the threads of a 2L soda bottle.  I asked the owner if he had 
a Carbonator (tm) I could borrow for a second.  While the threads were 
not exact, the Carbonator fit well enough that it appeared to seal.  When 
we attached the mini-keg to a CO2 tank, our little retrofit held the 
pressure without leaking.  


Is there a homebrewer who is willing to try this and report to us on the
results?

Subject: Hop Starter for bread


     My wife called my attention to a recipe for bread starter. The recipe is
from _The Complete Book of Breads_ by Bernard Clayton, Jr. Simon & Schuster, NY 
Copyright 1973. We got the book when, a looong, loong time ago when we first
were married (circa 1971) we joined the Doubleday Book Club, and it was one of
the monthly offerings. I am not sure whether it is still in publication.


     Throughout the years, my wife has produced many delicious loaves from the
directions in this book. But it was just today that she mentioned to me the
recipe for a HOPS STARTER that I sat up and took notice. I have only been
brewing since October, 1992; since then, I have been in tune with anything
relating to yeast/hops/malt/etc...


     Sure 'nuff, on page 307 of aforesaid book, there is a recipe for HOPS
STARTER. I will repeat it, no intent to defraud the original copyright
intended:


[ BTW, if you think I have violated the sacred copyright of the author, please
disregard the following post, hitting the delete key until you see the next
message...]


Quote:


Hops Starter


3 cups water
1 quart fresh hops or 1/4 cup packaged dry hops
1/2 cup cornmeal, white or yellow
2 cups mashed potato
3 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons salt


1.   In a saucepan bring water to a boil and steep hops for 30 minutes. Drain
and reserve the liquid; discard the hops. If necessary add water to make 3 full
cups of liquid.


2.   Pour 1 cup of the hops liquid in a saucepan and stir in the cornmeal.
Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. When it thickens
slightly, remove from heat.


3.   In a large mixing bowl combine cornmeal mixture, mashed potato, sugar,
salt and the remaining 2 cups of hops liquid. Cover the bowl with a length of
cheesecloth and set in a warm place (80-85 degrees F ) for 24 to 48 hours or
until well fermented and bubbly. Stir every 8 hours or so during this period.


4.   When the starter is frothy and smells pleasantly fermented, pour it into a
2 quart jar with a tight fitting lid. Store in the refrigerator until clear
liquid has risen to the top of the mixture in about 2 days. Stir down - it is
ready to use.


     To replenish when only 1 cup remains; add water, cornmeal, mashed
potatoes, sugar and salt (as to begin). Set in a warm place. It will ferment
and become active in about 8 hours. Store in refrigerator.

Comments:


     I know from reading the HBD that hops act as an inhibitor to nasty
microbes, but will allow yeast (fortunately) to propagate. 


     In the list of ingredients, "1 quart fresh hops or 1/4 cup packaged dry
hops" I can only imagine what the original author means. I kinda guess if you
used 1 quart of whole hops, you'd wind up with one helluva heavy hop load <Just
my cup of tea!>. I have yet to taste a brew that had tooo many hops in it. 


               ----<Hi, my name's Bob and I am a Hop Head.>---- 


     Para 2: D'ya think this is a lame attempt to 'mash-in' the cornmeal?


     I haven't tried this yet. I'm no longer in pursuit of the perfect loaf.
I'm in pursuit of the better batch <G>. {Don't let yer batch loaf}

Subject: HOP VARIETIES




  In HBD 1595 some one ask about Lublin and Strisselspalt hops.
  I'm slow but here it is.
  French Strisselspalt is a major aroma hop from the Alsace area near 
  Strasbourg.  AA%-3.0-5.0, Beta %-3.0-5.5, cohumulone is 20 to 25% 
  of alpha acids.  It's a well accepted aroma hop similar to 
  Hersbruck in profile.  The aroma is of medium intensity, pleasant
  and hoppy.
  Polish Lublin is a Landrace variety grown in the area of the same
  name and widely believed to be a clonal selection of Sazz.
  AA%-3.0-4.5, Beta %-2.5-3.5, co-humulone is 25 to 30% of alpha acids
  Another source of the classical noble aroma type hop with long
  and strong traditions.  The aroma is mild and typical of noble
  aroma types.


  Tip- there is a new bittering hop out called Columbus (15% AA)
  good hop not overpowering.  Ask your supplier to get some.
  Also due to a shortage of the extremely popular Centennial hop
  Hop Union has began making a blend called Centennial-Type,
  it is very close and is good on its own merits.


  The above info comes from my pals at Hop Union USA here in Yakima.

Hi all,
Anyone have any good ideas, plans, etc. for converting a 15.5
gallon SS keg to a mash tun?  I'm currently using the picnic
cooler/slotted copper manifold setup.  I think the SS keg setup
will give me a lot more flexibility with mash types, allow direct
heating, not to mention durability. Thoughts?

According to the Boston Beer Company the main brewery is in Pennsylvania 
somewhere.
This is where Jim Koch makes his brew!


The R & D brewery is in Boston where they try different modifications to 
their brew as well as new types of brew, such as a Sam Adams IPA that they 
are currently market testing!

Why does


I'm glad Kinney took the time to comment on these questions.  The HBD is at 
its best when the experts lend knowledge in their field to the rest of us.  
While we have your attention, I would like to ask a few questions about 
upside-down brewing.  Is there a clever way to dry hop or add fruit (or 
fruit flavoring), or any other additions typically made to the secondary 
without racking?  I don't see any easy way to do this, but I thought you 
may have an alternative method.  If you did have to rack, would you have to 
lift the inverted carboy, with stand, to counter top level to drain it into 
a secondary?  It seems like this would be a pain.


I assume that most people use these for ales and steam beers only; at least 
I know I would have trouble getting one set up in my refrigerator for 
lagering.  I have heard that these will not work on the 7 gallon acid 
carboys, which is what I use almost exclusively.  Is this true?  Is there 
any plans to make a BrewCap for these carboys?


With the tap on the bottom, it must simplify drawing hydrometer samples 
considerably.  Has anyone ever thought of a way to integrate a hydrometer, 
or some other device, to the carboy/BrewCap system to allow continuous 
monitoring of the specific gravity throughout the fermentation process?  I 
really have no idea how to do this, but wouldn't it be great???

I asked in a previous post if anyone had a leakage problem, and nobody 
commented.  I may be pessimistic, but this seems to be a huge risk.  I 
routinely clog airlocks, so I don't think it would take much to clog a 
siphon cane.  I think its only a matter of time before someone ends up with 
5 gallons of beer on the floor.

Subject: RE: Making a stout




   Hi All,


In HBD#1605, Peter Williams asks about making stout:


>The first deals with brewing salts.


>Miller - gypsum lowers ph, calcium carbonate raises ph
           - dark grains tend to lower mash ph, therefore, adjust ph
             with calcium carbonate.


>Papazian - all stout recipes in TNCJHB call for gypsum additions.


>Who is right?(if either)


   Adding dark grains to the mash will acidify it as Miller says. I
interpret his advice as given above as adjust pH with calcium carbonate if
necessary, i.e., if the addition of dark malts drops the mash pH below
5.2. If your mash pH is roughly in the range 5.2 - 5.5, don't add anything.
   Personally, I've found when brewing porters and stouts, I get much better
results just adding the dark malt at the beginning of mash out. When I
added them to the mash, I got harsh, metallic notes in the finished beer.
   As far as Papazian's recipes calling for gypsum, IMHO it is not good
advice to recommend the addition of brewing salts without detailed knowledge
of the water chemistry involved. Water supplies vary greatly, even within
relatively small geographic areas, so I suggest you obtain a water analysis
before adding any brewing salts at all.


>Finally - I am using the Wyeast Irish(1098?) liquid yeast.  Any
>suggestions as to  appropriate fermentation temps?


FWIW, here's the blurb I have on that yeast:


WYeast 1084 Irish Ale Yeast
  Slight residual diacetyl is great for stouts.  It is
  clean smooth, soft and full bodied.  Medium flocculation
  and apparent attenuation of 71-75%.  Optimum fermentation
  temperature: 68 deg. F (20 deg. C).  Soft, round, malty;
  the least attenuative of the Wyeast line.  Very nice for
  any cold-weather ale, at its best in stouts and Scots
  bitters.


>Basement is cool - 55F but steady.


I've seen a lot of this in the digest lately, people with cool basments
looking for different yeast strains, etc. My basement is also in the 50-55F
range this time of year. I use a large cardboard box, big enough to hold
two 6.5 gallon carboys, with a 40 watt bulb installed. I set another piece
of cardboard in front of the bulb to baffle the light, and close the lid.
It maintains a steady 65-68F inside for pennies a day, and I don't have to
lug full carboys upstairs.

A few odds and ends from HBD #1606.  (BTW, what happened to 1605?  None of the
subscribers at my site seem to have received it.)


Bob Paolino flames Jim Koch for contract brewing.  While this was certainly true
when he started, since 1989 he has been shipping product out of his brewery
(the old Haffenreffer brewery) in Boston.  In addition to doing his pilot brews
and recipe development there, he also makes most of the Boston Lager and Stock
Ale that we see in the metro Boston area.  The equipment there was purchased
from the old Newman's Brewing Co. in Albany, and he has an annual output of
10,000 barrels.  So while the rest of the country may get contract brewed
Sam Adams products, here in Boston he makes it himself.  And yes, I know that
Jim Koch is a marketing sleazeball who engages in business by prosecution, but
he still makes a damn fine pint of beer.


Peter Williams asks about water treatment for making stouts (amongst other
things).  There are two questions that need to be resolved in order to answer
this.  First, what is the mineral content of your brewing water to start with?
Second, what is the mash pH with the grains that you use for brewing stouts.
pH will be lowered by the presence of cations (primarily Ca+ and Mg+), which
react with phosphates naturally present in the mash to free up hydrogen (H+)
ions.  The presence of carbonate (CO3-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions in the
mash buffer this pH reduction by providing other negative ions for the metals
to react with.


Dark malts are naturally acidic, and will assist in the pH reduction of the
mash.  This is why dark beers were originally brewed in places with high
carbonate water.  So monitor the pH of your mash after doughing in.  Ideally
you would like to be in the range from 5.2 to 5.5.  If your water is moderately
carbonate to start with, you will probably arrive here naturally.  If the pH is
too low, you will need to raise it somehow.  Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3 - chalk)
is pretty insoluble in water, but may be added directly to the mash.  Baking
Soda (NaOH - sodium hydroxide) may also be used to raise the pH.  If your pH
is too high, then it needs to be lowered through the addition of more calcium,
probably in the form of gypsum (CaSO4) for stouts.


Finally, Dan McConnell posts the origins of the YeastLab strains.  Does this
imply that the YeastLab A02 (Chico) is the same strain as Wyeast 1056; that
Yeastlab A04 (Whitbread) is the same as Wyeast 1098; that YeastLab A05
(Guiness) is the same as Wyeast 1084; or that YeastLab L34 (A/B) is the same
as Wyeast 2007?  Also, I was encouraged to see that the YeastLab A03 is the
Whiteshield yeast, as Worthington's Whiteshield is the beer that I try and
emulate with my pale ales.

Brian Cole (Cole`at`nevism.nevis.columbia.edu) writes of eugenol, 
peppers and cloves in his beer. 
 
I brewed my Christmas ale (a loose interpretation of a triple) 
using D&C's Belgian ALE malt, some of the lighter D&C specialty 
malts, sucrose, tettnanger hops, and Wyeast Belgian (O.G. 1.070). 
Primary fermentation was two weeks at ~60F, secondary 
(conditioning) ~40F for two months. I bottled with 3/4 cup sucrose 
and a tablespoon of active yeast. The beer was fully carbonated in 
five days (due to the active yeast, I assume) and has a distinct 
peppery flavor, but no clove. 
 
I'm still new to using Belgian malts, I've never before put table 
sugar in a beer, this was my first use of Wyeast Belgian and the 
first time I added yeast at bottling. Any or all of these 
variables may have created the peppery flavor. It's an interesting 
flavor, not at all unpleasant, and rather appropriate to the 
holiday beer. I still would like to know what caused it. 
 
Any information would be most appreciated.

The biggest one I know of is Sierra Nevada.  Also Anchor.  Its not that
hard of a task, you buy huge orders from the hop brokers (Hop Union, 
Lupofresh, etc) and they store them cold for you, shipping a couple
of months worth as needed.  They need to store them cold anyway, so
it is a service to large customers.  Also, small breweries like River
City in Sac, use whole hops, and Old Dominion has started to dry hop
using whole hops because the brewmaster (and I agree) feel it imparts
a better quality of aroma.  Yes oils are burst in the pelletization
process, but Im skeptical as to if this is benefit.  Also, Anchor Libery
sits on big sacks of Cascade for about 3 weeks prior to packaging (even
though one can dry hop OK in a few days).

O.K., one more time for Al and Anthony (I'm starting to regret ever 
posting on this subject, it's beginning to eat way too much of my 
time.)


When I use the word TEND, I don't mean STRATIFY.  Please quit trying 
to put that word in my mouth.  Yes, lighter elements will diffuse 
into one another.  However, the heavier elements will have a greater 
concentration at lower levels than they will at higher levels.  Why 
is this?  (I apologize for using a little physics here, but my 
abilities have been called into question.)  In the absence of 
intermolecular forces (ex. Van Der Waals forces), the concentration 
of a gas at a height h is given by


n(h) = n(0) exp(-Mgh/kT)                where


M = mass of the molecule
g = gravitational constant
k = Boltzmann constant
T = temperature in K


If we allow the system to sit for an extended period of time and 
diffuse like Al and Anthony suggest, then T is the same for all 
molecules.  Hence, a heavier molecule like CO2 will experience a 
faster fall off in concentration than lighter ones like O2 or N2.  
This means that the ratio of CO2 to O2 at lower levels is greater 
than it is at higher levels (i.e. the CO2 tends toward the bottom, 
the O2 tends toward the top).  Does this mean that I will die from 
a lack of oxygen at the Earth's surface?  No, the oxygen is still 
there; however, the ratio of CO2 to O2 is greater here than higher up.


Does this analogy carry over to liquids?  For some liquids, yes; for 
others, no.  The mere fact that they are liquids means that there are 
intermolecular forces.  My initial statement was that if additional 
intermolecular forces do not become too great upon dissolving, then 
the less dense components (alcohol) will tend toward the top of the 
container.  For a multi-component system like beer, I would not even 
begin to try to work out the intermolecular forces to determine if 
this is true.  I only offer as evidence a difference in specific 
gravity readings made from the top of the vessel after a long period 
of quiescence and after mixing (and yes, I do believe .003 is 
significant since it has been repeated several times and because it 
would be a lowball figure since the mixed sample should have a lower 
SG than a sample from the bottom of the tank after the long period of 
quiescence).  A much better data point would be to actually measure 
the alcohol content from the top and bottom after the quiescent 
period.  Since I don't have access to equipment that will allow me to 
make this measurement, I leave this to someone else.

Subject:      Re: High Gravity Brewing


Jim Busch commented that high gravity boils are useful in homebrewing, however
high gravity fermentations may lead to negative results:


  I have been thinking that high gravity brewing may have a real role in making
a light Budmillooors type beer without needing to use adjuncts.


  Since I have quite a few friends and neighbors who greatly prefer standard
american beers over beers with stronger taste profiles, I have been looking for
a way to make homebrew that would make their tastebuds as well as mine happy.


  Ideally, Id like a beer that was  1) Malt extract based (to lure future
homebrewers with)   2) cost effective ( rice syrup costs more per pound than
malt extract..) and 3) Had a reasonable alcohol content.


   Seems to me that maybe making an American Standard clone (sans adjuncts)
might include high gravity fermentation.


   A recipe with 3 lbs. of light malt extract, 2 lbs of corn sugar, maybe
some carapils for a bit of body and low hops would probably give a beer with
a pretty good flavor profile for your average bud drinker.


   Now, considering that corn sugar will ferment out cleanly given enough
nutrient for the yeast, the way to maintain adequate yeast nutrition (from
malt extract sugars) may be to do a high gravity fermentation and than
dilute the beer by 50-75%.  This would give a desired light flavor profile
wihtout diluting the alcohol past 3% or so.  If brewed with a clean profile
yeast (lager or 1056 Wyeast), unpleasant ester formation may even be able
to be controlled for.


 Does this make sense, or am I missing something?
