I have used the combination of Wyeast 1056 and Red Star Dry Champagne Yeast for
both Barley Wines and Dry, Hard Ciders with excellent results. I let the 1056
poop out, rack, and add a good, sweet starter of the Red Star, as I like to
give the secondary fermentation a good, strong start since the gravity at this
point can be quite low. The secondary fermentation can be quite long, maybe 2
weeks minimum. The longer, the drier, at least in my opinion.

HOPPY HOLIDAYS TO Y'ALL


Like most clubs, we get newsletters. I don't know if this is copyrighted:-),but
I'm lifting it anyway from a newsletter from another region about a competition
in still another region. So here it is, excerpts from a top ten list (items
relating to particular clubs or non-public brewing personalities omitted). If
you've heard these before, direct flames, as usual, to bgates`at`microsoft.com.


TOP TEN REASONS WHY THE (deleted club) didn't win the (deleted competition)


9. Thought the wet t-shirt was supposed to go _inside_ the carboy.
8. No category for beers that suck.
6. The toilet bowl fermenter experiment was a miserable failure.
5. Judges constantly distracted by Fred Eckhardt mooning them.
4. Followed Charlie Papazian's advice to freely substitute black patent
   for pale malt.
3. The Brewing Stud was too busy "sparging the grist" (if you know what
   I mean)  (RAP's note: that wasn't in Andy Patrick's sparge definition)
1. We don't need no stinkin' (award) because we're the (club), damnit|

Well, the subject heading sounds wierd but it's true.  Now, I work at the 
Mtn. Valley Brew Pub in Suffern, NY; we just started getting a new yeast 
strain from Yeast Lab (according to brewer Jay Misson).  He told me that 
it's a new strain from England and gave me about 8-10oz to take home 
(watta guy!).


Now, to all of you biological/zymurlogical (?) graduate/postgraduate

I've wondered about this, but never had anything to back it up.  Does this mean 
that I'm wasting my time adding Cara Pils (<= 1 pound) to my mash to get more 
body?  When Papazian writes about using a "protein developing step mash", are 
these the proteins that add body, or are they used for some other reason?  I 
have made my last few batches using Fix's 40-60-70 mash schedule.  I think this 
has given me a significant improvement (over single step infusion) in the 
overall malt quality in my beers.  I have heard of people adding a vanilla bean 
in the boil to increase mouth feel and smoothness, but I have never tried it.

This stuff doesn't even deserve to be called swill.  I can't believe they are 
pricing this like a micro brew, but people around here are lining up to buy it. 
I think "red dog" is an interesting name for a beer, because it's football slang
for an all-out blitz.  Thats the term we used to use for people drinking as much
beer as they possibly could with the single purpose of getting incredibly drunk,
or blitzed. Coincidence???  I really don't think AB would do this intentionally,
but you know those marketing guys :)

Subject: Volume problems in a Cooler Mashtun


Ken B writes about too much volume for step mashes in his cooler;


I just switched from a 5 gallon Gott to a 14 gallon rectangular Coleman,
mostly because I moved to 10 gallon batches. I used to have trouble getting
the temperature up for mashout too, but really the extra volume and the
geometry of the rectangular tun allows better stirring of the thinner
grist. However, here are a couple of things to consider:


1) Why mashout? The only advantage I can see is improved consistency for
the big brewers. I doubt I've ever made two batches alike, so stopping the
enzymes on the clock seems of low importance. I used to do a 1 step (65C)
mash and it was just fine, though I use a protein rest now.


2) Use a "decoction" to get the temp up. At the end of the enzyme rest,
remove 2 quarts to a saucepan and boil it, then return it to the tun for
mashout.


Another note; I have been doing batch sparges after the suggestion (I
think) of Geo. Fix. That is, thin grist, recirculate briefly, then collect
the runnings quickly. Add sparge water to make a thin grist again, stir,
recirculate briefly and collect again at maximum flow. Repeat once more,
then sparge conventionally to the desired volume. The geometry of all (4
total) of the cooler manifolds I've seen still leaves pockets of poorly
sparged grain. It is so disheartening to spend hours collecting runnings
(terminating at 1.015) and then find you're dumping sweet grains into the
compost bin! The batch process (in a couple of tries) has been faster and
resulted in better yields for me than the slow conventional sparging. YMMV

HBDers,
 I want to correct a statement made in a recent HBD. I stated that Red Dog was 
made by Anheuser Busch. It is not. Red Wolf is made by AB. Red Dog is made by 
Plank Road Brewing which is Miller. I think the bottom line is that Red Dog is 
swill IMHO and in the opinion of everyone that emailed me. Red Wolf did not 
receive much higher reviews than Red Dog but I take it it does at least have 
some color to it. Just for the record, I did not buy the 6-pack of Red Dog. It 
was brought to my house by my brother-in-law who then, in turn, ended up 
drinking my home brew. Do you blame him?

   I'd like someone to clear up something that I run across periodically in
the HBD. People mention that a clogged blowoff tube in your carboy could
lead to glass grenades( i.e., carboy explodes). Do people wire down their
bungs like champagne bottles? Wouldn't the building CO2 pressure either blow
out the bung or whatever's plugging the tube before the carboy went boom? I
realize that the thickness of the glass in a carboy may not give an
indication of just how sturdy the carboy is, but I'm having trouble
visualizing this problem. On the other hand, I have had a fermentation lock
bubble off a carboy before.
   This may be a trivial question, but it bugs me every time someone
mentions it.

Subject: Air Pump Filter?


Hey HBDers,


Season's Greetings! I recently acquired an aquarium pump for wort 
aeration and had a few questions regarding its use.  


1.  What type of filtering device is preferable?  I am considering a 
sterilized, in-line filter of either cotton, glass wool, or a commercially 
available 0.22 um material.  I want to keep out nasties without excessive 
wear on the pump---it's a major cheapo!


2.  What is the best approach for introducing oxygen with this type of 
system?  I thought that I would begin aeration as soon as I have chilled the 
wort, but I am unsure how long to continue the aeration process before 
pitching and how long it should continue after pitching.  I recall some 
discussion on this topic in recent HBDs, but I can't recall which ones and 
I don't have an easy way of searching old ones by topic.


Any help is greatly appreciated.  Have a great holiday season!

Well, I did this last year, out of necessity, not design.  I had a barley
wine that wasn't finishing, so I finally broke down and pitched a
wine/champagne yeast (can't remember).  It helped it along to completion and
the bwine is doing fine.  BTW, I don't feel this is necessary if you pitch a
sufficiently large yeast population and aerate well - the ale yeast should do
fine.


On the subject of the bwine, it is over a year old now and it is remarkably
stable.  Overall, I have had very good luck with beer stability, but then I
don't often do the George Fix stability test (ship the beer UPS in an
uninsulated box to/from Texas in the middle of August - or something like
that!).  My beers do really well for months at a time in my basement and/or
refrigerator.  Maybe all that attention to HSA avoidance and sanitation does
have a positive effect!  The only drawback of course, is that if the beer is
bad to start, it tastes just as bad 6 months later!

I'm going to stick my long neck out here and say that this doesn't sound
right.  I believe that you are after 5 ppm of *free* iodine for sanitizing.
This 5 ppm of *free* iodine can be obtained if you have 12.5 ppm of
*titratable* iodine.  Does this sound better?  Maybe some of you chem pros
out there can verify.  Bottom line is, as Al says, follow the directions on
the bottle.

The key to the iodine test is to collect only liquid.  The husks and chunks
of grain will test positive for starch.  I've had good luck testing only the
liquid portion of the mash.

 Unfortunately, sending you the report could compromise the source who was 
 kind enough to make sure I knew what was going on there.  You will just have 
 to take my word for it or try to get a copy from someone in the club.  All I 
 can add is how nice it is to have friends in the right places.

 >Has anyone had any problems upgrading their "o" ring driven malt mill to a
 gear driven malt mill?  I have... In the upgrade, I recieved only two gears 
 with no instructions on how to install the gears. 
 
 You certainly did not get them from me or you would have received 
 instructions on how to do it.
 
 > The only way to install the gears was to cut off the shaft and bore
 the roller to fit a new longer shaft.
 
 You also would have been told that you need to exchange your roller for a 
 gear compatible one. 
 
 >  The new gear was placed on the new shaft on one side and the other gear 
 was placed on the other roller where the hand crank is attached.  What really 
 upset me was that a normal person could not upgrade their "o" ring malt mill 
 without some exstensive machine work.  I think this should be stressed to the 
 homebrewers when buying an "o" ring drive malt mill.  By the way, the gear 
 driven malt mill works much better.
 
 The Gear Drive Option (GDO) requires an extended shaft on the "passive" 
 roller.  All adjustable mills have been shipped with extended shafts for 
 oveer  two years and adding gears in the field is a trivial job.  The flyer 
 that describes the MM clearly states that the GDO is only available on the 
 adjustable mill as a standard option.  On older mills or on fixed mills, we 
 have to do a roller exchange to add the gears.  My heart bleeds for all the 
 trouble you went through and I think your dealer should be taken over your 
 knee.  They have all the info needed but if they don't read it, you are stuck 
 holding the bag.

Subject: Water Analysis Help


Can anyone create a WATER.FAQ, it would be very useful.


This is the information I have so far, for Milwaukee, WI:


Hardness        143ppm
Ph                7.5ppm
Chlorine        1.2ppm
Calcium        96ppm
Floride                1.1ppm
Chlorides        16ppm
Sodium        7ppm


Does anyone have complete information and relevant 
  analysis for Milwaukee?
Which additional measurements should I request?
What do the measurements mean to my brewing?
What adjustments should I make, how and when?


Any help would be greatly appreciated.


Thank You,

A while back, there was some traffic concerning the Scottish peated malt 
that many homebrew shops now carry.  People warned that it didn't impart 
the same flavor as smoking the grains yourself, and that a little goes a 
long way.  I complained that even 1/4 pound in a five gallon batch of pale 
ale caused an overly-strong and unpleasant flavor.
     
However, after about three months in the bottle, that same ale has mellowed 
out quite nicely.  So, if you've experimented with the peated malt and were 
disappointed, be patient and set it aside for a while.  It will definitely 
get better.

I also cursed the clogged screen on my 10 inch funnel until I figured a way
to prevent it.  I drape a nylon straining bag  (notice I didn't say sparging
bag ) :-) over the top of the funnel.  When flow through the screen slows
down, I just swoosh (another technical term) the bag a bit and flow picks up.
   Using this method, I leave most of the gooey trub in my brew pot which
makes it easy to toss out.  I reuse the nylon bag and toss it into my
sanitizing solution with the other stuff.  Works for me!

I have seen talk about Farmer's beer but couldn't remember if it was
on HBD or CBS or judgenet, so I'll post to all 3. The recipe below
comes from a book titled "Homemade Beverages by a Practical Brewer".
The book was copyrighted 1919 by Western Distributers in Calgary,
Alberta  Canada.




Farmers' Ale
- ------------


Mash potatoes with 1/10 of its weight of ground barley malt. This mixed 
with some water and exposed in a water bath to a heat of 160 F, thence 
boiled with hops, cooled and fermented into beer.
