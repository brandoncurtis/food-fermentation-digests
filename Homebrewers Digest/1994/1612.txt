Greetings!


Norm Pyle hat trouble with a line that Al K wrote about Iodophor, 
specifically wheather or not it was 12.5 ppm free Iodine or 12.5 ppm 
titratable Iodine.


In my original post about it I indicated 12.5 ppm titratable Iodine 
for a no rinse sanitization.  This equates to 1/2 oz per 5 gallons or 
3 teaspoons.


This is from Ecolab's trade literature on Mikroklene, their Iodine 
based sanitizer.

Subject: two questions: carboys and bags


I've received some very helpful replies to some questions I've
posted recently about brewing techniques, so thought I'd ask
for advice on a couple of other issues.  I've been extract-
brewing for a couple of years and have been very satisfied with
my results, but I'm looking to improve my technique in various
ways.  Here are the questions:


   (1) Until recently I've been using a simple, single-stage
process with a plastic fermenter, but I finally broke down and
bought a 5 gal. carboy to use as a secondary (for all the obvious
reasons).  How important is the fill level in the carboy when I
rack the beer to it for secondary fermentation (or just storage
until I have time to bottle)?  My understanding is that one
advantage of the carboy is that you can fill it to the bottom of
the neck (in the secondary, not the primary), thus minimizing the
air space and the surface area to reduce contact of the beer with
oxygen.  However, does this matter much, or is the important thing
just to get the beer off the layer of spent yeast and into glass?
The first batch I racked to secondary didn't fill the carboy
quite this high, and I'm wondering if I should make an adjustment
in the future to ensure that when I get to the secondary my fill
line is at the neck of the carboy.


   (2) I just discovered grain and hop bags, and it was like a
religious experience.  I've previously used adjunct grains by
slowly heating in the cookpot (or second pot) and straining them
out when the water begins to boil; to remove hops, I've poured the
concentrated wort from the cookpot through a strainer into my
primary fermenter.  The latter is a real nuisance when I use hop
pellets because they clog up the strainer.  And, in any case, this
process results in all sorts of splashing and a big mess.
So, in my last batch I put my adjunct grains in a grain
bag and used it like a tea bag, and was impressed with how convenient
this was.  I later emptied the bag and put my pelletized finishing
hops in it.  (The grain bag was a little large for this purpose,
but worked fine.)  It now seems to me that if I got some hop bags
and did all my hop additions this way, and also used a grain bag
for the adjunct grains, I wouldn't have to use a strainer later on,
which would have a number of other advantages.  I like this a lot.
My question is:  Is there anything else I need to know about the
use of grain and hop bags to use them properly?  How important is
it to run extra water through them to extract the last of the
goodies from the grain or hops?  Does a bag work as well if you're
adding finishing hops for only a minute or two, or is it important
to stir the bag around to ensure extraction of all the goodies?
Are there disadvantages to using bags that I haven't thought of?


   Thanks for your replies.  Private e-mail probably best.

Subject: RE: Mash Temperature Control


In Digest #1610, berkun`at`decwet.enet.dec.com asks about mash 
temperature control. 


>Specifically, I can't add enough hot water to get it from, say, 150

I have experienced the same problem.  I use an insulated Sankey keg 
for a mash tun with a perforated screen on the bottom.  It does a good 
job of holding a temperature, but raising the temperature after mash in is
tough.  I have tried steam infusing through the valve under the mash 
screen.  This did raise the temp.  To move from 150F to 170F it took 25 
minutes and requires stirring to avoid hot spots.  I was concerned about 
HSA with this method.  It seams like allot of bubbling is going on as the 
steam moves through the mash.


I do mostly infusion mashing at 150F +-.  I pretty much gave up on trying 
to raise the mash to 170F for mash out.  Since the main purpose of 
mash out is to get the grain bed warm enough for the 170F sparge, I just 
started sparging with 180F water to compensate.


I have considered building a RIMS setup to raise the temp at the end of 
the mash and also for the occasional step mashes.  I have hesitated to 
move on this since the only way to obtain the electronic temp controller 
is to build it from scratch.


Happy Brewing

The culture is from The National Collection of Yeast Cultures, a Yeast bank 
in England.  NCYC 1187.  I'm sorry that it doesn't' have a cute name.  Maybe 
we should have a name-that-yeast contest here on the HBD-something PC, 
obscure, that gives only the slightest hint to its true origins  ;-)  The 
culture was purchased a few months ago at the request of a micro who's 
name I don't recall at the moment.  I don't have much experience with this 
one yet,although I am doing my best to try to convince people to use it.  
Jeff Renner (among others) has, and will probably speak up.  


Here is what I know:
Max. Temp. 37.0#161#C, Min. Temp. 13.4#161#C, Optimum Temp. 32.0#161#C.
moderate attenuation, fast fermentation, high flocculation.  From my 
experience it does not produce much top crop.  The taste seems rather 
neutral, but this could be that I am comparing it in a split batch with 
Shepherd Neame and Gales cultures, both of which are far from neutral.  
1187 appears to be excellent primarily from mechanical standpoint.


Your turn.  How does it work for Mt Valley?

     I heard that Bell's beers (a micro in Kalamazoo) as well as Sierra 
     Nevada are yeast carbonated in the bottle. Can we recover good yeast 
     from a bottle? Dependably? What's the best technique?
     
     I read Dennis's comment on "batch sparging" with much interest, since 
     the amount of time for a normal sparge is one of the chief 
     shortcomings of mashing for me. Was there an original post on this 
     technique that I missed? Could I get more detail on the technique?

"Red Dog" is also a card game known for generating excessively large pots.

Subject: Chloramines in Water 


I recently sent off for a water analysis from the City Water Department. 
The staff was quite helpful and prompt. The lab tech that I talked to was 
interested to know that water chemistry was important in making Real Beer 
(not tm BBC). Most of their inquiries, I gathered, were from health nuts 
and fishkeepers. I mentioned that I also kept fish, and he replied that 
the water in my area was treated with chloramines. The use of chloramines 
is increasing all over the country, from what I understand.


Apparently chloramines are not removable by boiling. I do have chemicals 
that will convert them to something that the bacteria in the fish tank 
can eat, but I doubt that I want them in my Real Beer. Any suggestions on 
what I can do to remove them from my brewing water?  (I'm an 
extract/speciality grain brewer right now.)

Recently a local supermarket has begun carrying products
from the Anderson Valley Brewing company in Mendocino 
California.  I initially tried their Barney flats oatmeal
stout which was incredible!  Well worth the gold medal
they received last year.  I've also tried their Boont amber
American style pale ale which was equally terrific.  It had
a dominant caramel aroma and flavor with a great hop aroma
and flavor.  Their porter was also very good.  I noticed 
when drinking the porter that the beers appear to be bottle
conditioned.  I am curious if anyone has had success 
cloning these beers.  If you have been succesful, did you 
use the yeast sediment in the bottles to make a starter?
Does anyone have any other information about the hops, and
grain bill they use?  These are great beers but at $4 for a 
22 oz. bottle I would like to take a crack at brewing my own!

Someone replied to my low alcohol post and asked if I thought the results 
were transferable to higher volumes, i.e. one gallon.  From reading other 
posts on this (Jack Schmidling, Maribeth Raines) it seems there is 
tremendous variability based on how you do it.  I think you have to 
analyze the beer to know what you've got.  I put one bottle in a 2 qt. pot, 
if I had put 2-3 bottles in the same pot I don't think the reduction in 
alcohol would have been as great because the surface area to volume ratio 
would be smaller.  Based on some lab work I've done in the past on volatile 
compounds I know this ratio can have a big impact on evaporation rates.  
You will have to lose a fair amount of water to significantly lower the 
alcohol content.  That's why I included the volume loss in my post.  


Another question was did I correct for evaporation of water.  The answer is 
no correction was needed.  The GC measured concentration of alcohol of each 
sample taken right out of the pot.  What was analyzed is what I would have 
drank had I taken the solution and carbonated it.  I did not take the heated 
liquid and add water back to the original volume.  But this brings up an 
easy short cut - heat your regular beer for awhile, then dilute with water 
to lower the alcohol content further.  


I also want to re-emphasize that the absolute numbers in my post shouldn't 
be taken as is.  The original alcohol content of the pale ale was listed as 
6.1%, but I know from the gravity readings (1.043 OG, 1.006 FG) that this 
was high.  Even with 20-30% error on the high side the alcohol levels were 
clearly reduced to much lower levels than the original concentration.  If I 
had more time we could maximize the accuracy of the chromatography, but this 
was a favor in a very busy commercial lab so I don't think I'll be doing 
much more work.

Subject: Iodine Starch Test


Here is how I do the iodine starch test:


I use a clean white porcelain tile (left-over building material) and put a
few drops of the mash liquor on the tile.  Then I take the iodine and put a
few drops on the tile close to the mash liquid but not directly in it.  Tilt
the tile and let the iodine slowly run into the mash liquid.  Take your
reading from the interface of the iodine and mash liquid.


This is kinda what it looks like:  (use a mono-spaced font to see this)


    ----         ----
- --- Mash --- ||--Iodine--- 
- ----------- ||-----------
- ------------||------------
  -------       -- 


Judge the conversion by the color between the || where the liquids meet.
Remember that husk will give a dark reaction like starch.  When the idodine
doesn't darken, the conversion is complete.

I had this same question once.  No, people don't tie down their bungs.  The
answer seems to be that the krauesen dries to the bung/glass interface,
effectively glueing it in place.  It doesn't release before the glass breaks,
in some cases.  I've never seen this problem myself, thank God.

>Can anyone create a WATER.FAQ, it would be very useful.


There doesn't seem to be great interest in doing this.  I suspect it is
because nobody is much of an authority in this area, or perhaps just because
it's a boring subject.  Questions on water often go unanswered, so I'll give
it a shot:


>Hardness 143ppm


Moderate hardness, I would say.


>Ph    7.5ppm


Meaningless.  The pH of the water has no bearing on the pH of the mash or
runoff.  Buffering action of the mash ions controls the pH.  BTW, it isn't
"ppm".  pH is used like a unitless number, although it somehow stands for the
hydrogen ion concentration (a log of it, hmmm, I'm grasping at straws now...).
I _do_ know it means "power of Hygrogen".  I think.


>Chlorine 1.2ppm


Pretty normal, or at least similar to mine.


>Calcium  96ppm


Again, moderate hardness.  The difference between the 143 ppm total hardness,
and the 96 ppm calcium hardness is mostly magnesium, or so I'm told.


>Floride     1.1ppm


Also similar to mine.


>Chlorides   16ppm


?


>Sodium   7ppm


Nice and low.  It is always good to have less of something, than too much of
it, as it is easier to add ions than subtract them from water.


>Which additional measurements should I request?


I would ask for numbers on carbonates, sometimes called alkalinity, or
temporary hardness.  I'm guessing what they call "Hardness" above is only
permanent hardness.  You might also try to find out numbers on sulfates.  The
bottom line is you want as much info as possible on the ions that contribute
to permanent and temporary hardness:  calcium, magnesium, potassium, sulfates,
carbonates, and bicarbonates.


As far as adjustments, do nothing at first, and take pH measurements of the
mash and runoff.  You probably don't need to do anything to your water, since
it seems to be pretty "middle of the road".  I'm no expert in this area BTW,
not by any stretch of the imagination.  I highly recommend you read Dave
Miller's "Complete Handbook of Home Brewing".  He has a very good chapter on
water that explains things much better than I can.  And he's probably right,
to boot!

Norm

Subject: Damn that Chlorine!


Fellow brewmakers,


Admittedly, my routine for cleaning bottles has usually been to stick 
as many as I can in my plastic bucket, add water and bleach, and leave 
it overnight. Sometimes I am busy and overnight becomes next week. 
Typically I need to do this twice to clean enough bottles for one 
batch, so I'd calculate I've done this 16 times with one plastic 
bucket, which is also my primary fermenter.


My most recent batch, a nifty Christmas ale with nutmeg and raspberry, 
was first tasted on 12/17, and it seemed a little young but certainly 
on its way.


Last night, 12/21, the 2nd tasting was hopeless. Like a wheat beer gone 
bad. After much reading, I suspect CHLOROPHENOL.  I've seem to recall 
postings about chlorine leeching into the plastic of a fermenter and 
then back into a fermenting wort. If thisis true, I'm certain to 
experience it. It does seem like my last few brews have tended towards 
that phenolic taste.


Should I just get a new bucket and use the old one strictly for 
cleaning? My guess is Yes.

Subject: Better Sparger?


I use two picnic coolers in my all grain brewery.  One is used as the mash tun,
the other is my lauter tun.  I sparge by opening and closing the cooler value to
regulate flow.  The sparge water streams out and I mix as appropiate.  The
sparging process is SLOW!  It takes about 1 hour to sparge.  Does anyone have
a better way to sparge without using high temperature pumps?

I went through a similar process.  I don't know if it was chlorine or 
infection, but all of a sudden, every batch tasted the same - 
borderline drinkable, but not good.


My buckets are now strictly for cleaning and catching blowoff.  My 
primary and secondary are glass carboys.

I see that I totally butchered the name of the town where the SA ales

Jim Busch asks:


>any idea/comments on why SA dropped the FX Matt brewery
>from their contracts?


Nothing definite, but I heard speculation that it was a $$$ thing, Matt's
wanted to up the cost of doing business with the Boston (tm) Beer Company and
BBC balked.  Considering that Stroh's has quite a bit of excess capacity, it 
probably wasn't too hard to get them to cut a deal.




RE: the beers that BBC is having brewed under contract for the Oregon Ale and 
Beer Brewery, Jim Larsen is correct.  I heard an ad on the radio today which 
claimed that the beers are produced in Lake Oswego, OR, (home of Saxer).  I am 
not sure why the bottles indicate the brewery is in Portland.

Doing a full boil (the whole batch) is not necessarily bound to all-grain
brewing as many extract brewers believe.  Doing a full boil will give you
better hop utilization, better hot and cold break formation, less darkening
and less caramelization.  It does, however mean that you need to use some
kind of force chilling (wort chiller, sink full of ice, etc) or you won't
be able to pitch for hours and hours.  If you have a 8 or 10 (or larger)
gallon kettle, then I recommend you build yourself a chiller and go to
full boils.

No.  There are soluble proteins in CaraPils and since all the crystal malts
add some head retention and mouthfeel, I take this as an indication that there
are, indeed, small proteins (the good, head-retaining, body-improving ones)
in crystal malts.

  Al: 
  Both unfermentable dextrins (alpha-glucans) and proteins
  Contribute to a beer's body.  Of the two, viscosity measurements
  show that proteins are more important.  This can be directly verified 
  in small volume brewing experiments.  Try a normally mashed all malt
  beer as the control.  Then do a "diat" version with a long and extended
  low temperature mash.  The finished beer will have almost the same
  protein spectrum, but much less alpha-glucans.  It will be stronger
  in alcohol content but thinner in body.  This illustrates the effect of 
  dextrins.  Next do a third brew where, say, 15% of the malt is replaced with
  a dextrin corn starch.  The latter has no proteins and approximately the
  same carbohydrate structure as crystal malt.  Compare the three test brews
  taking their different alcohol content into account.


  A point I forgot to mention in my last message is that the main reason
  I use crystal malt is for color and for its special flavoring.  Mashing
  crystal malt is the best way I know to get both.  Other procedures that
  have been put forward --e.g.,boiling-- tend to extract husk constituents
  that I find unpleasant in finished beer.

I think that exploding carboys are a rare occurrance, but they still can be
a hazard.  No, I don't think anyone except the people using the *new*
BrewCap *imitator* are actually "wiring down" anything onto their carboys.
Note that the mess is no smaller when the blowoff hose/airlock ejects.  The
three times that my blowoff hoses have clogged, the pressure had built up
quite high before ejection: 1-to-3 gallons of highly carbonated, sticky,
partially-fermented beer all over the ceiling, walls and floor.  No, you
definately don't need the glass to break to make a big mess with a clogged
blowoff tube.

Yes, I should have wrote 12.5 ppm *titratable* iodine.  The "phor" in
iodophor stands for "carrier" and my understanding of the way that it
works is that the carrier releases *free* iodine as it is depleated.
