Subject: Carboy deposits


Out of sheer laziness I left a bleach and water solution in one of my
carboys for an extended period of time (greater than a month).  When
recently going back to get the carboy ready for brewing I noticed what
looked like pitting in the bottom and sides of the carboy.  Further
investigation revealed that it was not pitting but rather very small
deposits which look like sugar or salt crystals clinging to the glass
surface.  Problem is they are clinging rather strongly and I'm having
trouble getting them off.


I've tried bleach, B-brite, and hot water and none of these will disolve
it off.  The only thing I've found that works so far is using a wood
dowel with one of those Scotch Brite pads attached to it and applying
lots of elbow grease.


Anybody have any idea was this crud is?  Is there an easy way to get rid
of it?  Since the wood dowel mechanical method will not get everything
will this stuff hurt my beer if I brew with it in the carboy?


Happy New Year!

Subject:      Excessive bitterness


I have recently brewed a cream ale and a Pete's Clone and have a discouraging
(not worrying) problem: although I used two different types of hops in the
brews - Brewer's Gold in the "Wicked" and Cascade in the "Cream" - they both
came out with an excessive, sharp, and unpleasant bitterness. This is not a
hoppy bitternes, and each brew's sharp biternes has the same taste. I just
bottled the Cream Ale last night, so I can't do a ring check to look for
signs of an infection. The "Wicked" has no ring around its bottles' necks.
What, besides an infection, may cause a brew to have such excessive bitterness
(assuming the brewer addds the desired amount of hops)? I think I have an infec
tion, and thought it may be from my wire-mesh strainer. He has since been boile
d. Would light interacting with hops cause this bitterness?. Can anyone help me
on this?
Also, when is the best time to add ascorbic acid to a brew?
Private email is fine, and if anyone wants a summary, I will oblige.
Thanks much.

I had to move my vigorously fermenting brew the other day and was wondering 


if agitation is a problem at this point.  I am making a California Common
with a liquid ale yeast culture and fermenting it at 70 degrees.  It got
agitated quite a bit when I moved it and the bubbling through the airlock
seemed to slow down after it initially speeded up.  It is still bubbling at
the rate of 1 per 20 sec. or so.  Anyone know of a problem here?  Thanks for
taking the time to respond!

"... her waitress said that it was named to commemorate their recent,
 and fourth, victory over the Boston Brewing Company in court.


"My question is:  What is the problem?  Why have they gone to court
 with the BBC four times?"




Good question.


Based on my knowledge of legal research ( gathered, rather painfully,
over the past two years ), here's how to find out the answer.


( I can't do this 'cuz I'm 3000 bloody miles away, mate. I have my reasons
  to go to the East Coast, and Massachusetts in particular, (-:, but doing
  legal research for the HBD ain't one of them. :-)


You need to be in or near Boston for this to work, since you need to go
to the Massachusetts state courthouse, in Boston. ( This is a consequence
of Boston being in a certain county ; that county being served by a certain
courthouse ; the probability that any charges that were filed, were filed
in state court ; and the probability that BBC filed in the county which
Boston is located within. )


( You can save some time by calling both BBC and BBW and asking them which
  court(s) the case(s) were filed in. It may turn out that both state and
  federal courts are involved. )


Assuming it's a state court ... simply go to the court clerk's office, for
the state ( superior ? ) court, and ask how you can conduct a search of the
files for the name of a specific plaintiff and/or defendant.


Here in California, in all the clerk's offices I've been in, there were one
or more computer terminals that one could use to query various lists ... the
criminal cases list, the civil cases list, the small claims cases list, maybe
one or two others. Like the phone book and the dictionary, experimenting and
exploring often reveal fascinating and educational results. ( You, too, can
read the grimy details of your friends' divorces. )


I don't know if this technology extends to the Federal court, but suspect so.
Certainly the basic algorithm applies. ( You'll need to go to a different
courthouse, though. )


Once you have the files in your sweaty little hands ( you'll probably have to
read them in a special room ), take careful notes of case numbers and grimy
details ... and then post 'em. It's a matter of public record. If you're shy,
perhaps someone else will post them for you ... like me.


Inquiring minds want to know. And it's sure to give Sam(tm) Adams(tm) a real
fizz.                (-:

Subject: Honey, I'm home!




          Eric brings up a good point when asking about adding honey to 
          remedy his low OG problem.  Honey will definitely not add a lot 
          of body to the beer, but it will add some (which is better than 
          none).  But if it's a question of adding honey vs. sugar, by all 
          means use honey.  With honey you don't have the risk of the off-
          flavors generated by plain sugar.  I checked some recipes and 
          found that those with honey generally call for about 2 lbs 
          (boiled w/1 gl water).  While I've never done this, you could use 
          1 gallon of your unfermented brew as a substitute for the water, 
          boil for 15 minutes, cool, then add back to your fermenter.  If 
          this is not a good idea, I'm sure someone will enlighten us.   
          Also, Papazian says use a lighter honey or the flavors may 
          overwhelm the malt.  Keep us posted on how this works out.

I must have been a very good boy this year since Santa left me with a
14g stainless steel pot and a bottle tree.


I immediately ran out and purchased a "cajun cooker" propane burner (my
wife had grown tired of my consistant scorching and warping of the burners
on her range).  This one puts out 160k BTU's and I can get 7 gallons of
wort boiling in 15 minutes.  This has decreased my (all grain) brewing time
by at *least* 1.5 hours.


I have a covered porch outside where I use my burner.  I would NOT recommend
using propane in the house or any area that doesn't get sufficient air flow.
There's a slight propane smell outside but I works great even in the 15
degree weather we had yesterday.  It even kept the porch warm!

You can probably modify the thermostat to do what you want (I did).  To do
it, I removed the front knob and also the front plate of the thermostat.  The
front plate has a stop molded into it and the the knob shaft has a cam on it.
Well, not a cam, it is a protrusion on the side of the shaft which hits the
stop.  This is a safety measure so you can't turn you thermostat up hot enough
to do any real damage.  Guess what?  You can defeat this easily, but turning
the knob past the stop and then reinstalling the plate and knob.  Now, your
lowest setting is higher than the previous highest setting.  Another option
is to grind off the stop on the plate or the protrusion on the shaft.  That
gives you the entire range of temperatures.  The main point is that the
thermostat allows more than one turn of control, and you can use it to your
advantage.

For absolute bitterness (so many mg/l of isomerized alpha acids) this is true,
but the quality of the bitterness will vary.  George Fix wrote an interesting
HBD article about this last year, and followed it up in a talk at the
Brewstorm 94 Conference.  I suspect this subject will be well covered in his
upcoming book.  The bottom line is that at reasonably high IBU levels, some
hops give a nicer bitterness than others.


>Now my question.  Has anyone ever thought of blending whole hops and a

I suspect the oxygen added would be detrimental to the hops, but I don't know
for sure.  Maybe you could purge the blender with CO2 before blending.  OTOH,
I don't think you'd gain anything an extra 10 minutes of boiling wouldn't
solve, and the setup and blending would take longer than that.


**


Now my question:  does anyone know where I can get some hop bags of good
quality that will hold two ounces of loose hops comfortably?  Since I've gone
to 10 gallon batches I find I need to use more hops (duh) and my bags end up
pretty crowded.  I'm sure this will affect my utilization and not in a
predictable way.  I know I could just use more of the smaller bags, but
larger bags would make things simpler.


**


Another question:  Mark Garetz contends that the hop resins that get pushed
to the top of the krauesen during fermentation become oxidized and insoluble,
so that even if they fall back in the wort they are lost in terms of
their bitterness contribution.  I don't quite understand this, as it seems
that by the time high krauesen occurs, the environment in the top of the
fermenter should be quite oxygen-free.  Any comments?

Norm

Well, good for BBW!  Ben goes on to ask what the deal is with these two.
Well Ben, in Jim Koch's litigious manner, he seems to feel the need to sue
anybody and everybody he meets.  I don't think he's out to win friends and
influence people.  BBW was sued because of their name.  Koch felt that the
word "Boston" in the beer business was his and his alone.  BBW, and most
right-minded Americans, did not.  I don't know the details of the four
different suits/victories, but it is based on this.  He's gone on to try and
copyright virtually every historical figure's name and a bunch of other stuff
in the hopes that someday he'll want to use them.  Good beer or not, these
antics, make him a scoundrel around these parts.

Maybe so, but my old fridge ($50 at a garage sale) has a hard time staying
ABOVE 40 F.  In fact, I run it at the setting just above OFF to get it to
40-45F.  Go figure.

I posted this information some time ago in the Digest, but I will repeat
myself.  The tube of Dow Corning 100% Silicone Sealant distributed by DAP
states that it is safe for food contact.


 "SAFE FOR FOOD CONTACT:  When cured and washed, ingredients which remain
  or which could migrate to food are listed in FDA Regulation No. 21 CFR
  177.2600. 


  Contact supplier for Material Safety Data Sheet which contains detailed

Both the "Clear" and "White" sealants that I looked at had the above
statements.  I might could locate the MSDS, but it should be available
wherever you buy the sealant.  I think the building supply place
called DAP and they faxed the sheet to the store.


Happy sealing.
