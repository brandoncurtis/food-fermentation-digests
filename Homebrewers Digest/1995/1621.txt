Subject: prematurely attenuating cider




I had high hopes for a cider which I began last week, but now I'm 
beginning to worry.  The cider contains 10 liters of apple juice (no 
preservatives) from concentrate plus 1 kg brown sugar.  OG 1.082.   My 
starter contained about 0.5 liter of 2X strength apple juice to which I 
added 1/4 pkg Red Star Cote des Blancs wine yeast.  The starter grew 
fine, and by 24 hours after adding to the large batch, there was 
tremendous activity in the blowout hose.  So far, just like previous 
batches.  But previous batches were not as ambitious alcohol-wise.  I 
bought the wine yeast because I wanted a high alcohol content and 
champagne yeast happened to be sold out at the time.  I reasoned that any 
wine yeast should be able to get to 11% alcohol with no problem, right?  
Well, after 6 days SG was 1.045 and the bubbling has slowed down 
considerably.  This means 5% alcohol, 6% to go.  I expected the 
fermentation to be vigorous until at least 80-90% of the sugar was gone, 
not 50%.  Is this destined to be a very, very sweet 5-6% alcohol cider?  
Is there any reason why champagne yeast should be better than cote des 
blancs wine yeast?


Thanks,

Subject: holiday barleywine


I had the oppurtunity to finaly tap into my 94 holiday beer. This home brew
was
so incredible that I thought that I should share the recipe. 5 gallons of
this went
 to the SAAZ homebrew club X-mas party and was consumed rapidly.  Also it
is a exercise in high gravity / first runnings brewing. BTW the beer is a
vanilla
barleywine.
As follows for a 15 gallon ( net ) batch :
50# pale malt
25# wheat malt
5# carastan
2# light brown sugar ( last 15 min. of boil )
centennial hops 8.0 oz `at` 8.1% alpha - 75 min
centennial hops 1.0 oz       "        "     - dry in primary after 3 days
yeast wort was racked onto the lees of a pale ale batch ( mcbc yeast )
OG 25 P or 1.100


grist was spilt into two equal mashes ( so what follows for mashing
 was done twice)
9 gallons `at` 175 F for mash in - mash temp averaged 152 F- 45 min mash
3.5 gallons `at` 180 F for mash out - 15 min
collect first runnings


runnoff  from first mash was boiling during the second mash. When combined
combined and brought to a boil hops were added.
Note: one gallon of mash runnoff was collected and reserved ( frozen ) to be
used
for krausen later.


Fermented 10 days at 70 F, racked to secondary with krausen and 1 pint
vanilla
extract, 2 tbs nutmeg, 2 tbs ginger. Secondary temp 60 -45 for one month,
racked
to soda kegs.

Subject: help me with some translation


Perhaps the collective wisdom of the Digest can help me figure out what I 
have. I just received an old piece of etched glass with a picture of a fellow
standing in front of a few kegs of beer sampling a glass of brew.


On this object (which appears from its size-3 1/2 feet by 5 feet-to have been
a window) are the following words: Brouwerij De Hertog. Written on the kegs
are Dubbel Gersten, Extra Gersten and Gersten. The etcher was/is Philbert
Gaillac.


I am wondering if this is something from Belguim or Holland. . .Any ideas?


Private e-mail is fine, or you can post to the digest. TIA

Subject:       Refrigerators... how cold are they?


I've been reading the HBD for the last few issues and the issue of 
refrigerators has come up.  Once again something I feel I must add my 
$0.02  to :).


Domestic refrigerators are made to operate in the 35-45 degree range 
with typical temps in the high 30's.  


The problem with using a reforigeratoe for beer is twofold:  One, the 
temperature is too low for most fermentations.  Two, the differential 
on the thermostat is around 14 degrees.  This is to prevent the 
compressor from short cycling as the door is opened and closed.


The Hunter Airstat (which someone has posted is available again 
somewhere) combatted both of these by reducing the differential to 4 
degrees (or is it 6?) and allowing a higher range of settings.  It 
will not go down below 40 deg however.  There is a text file in the 
archives I think that details modifications to the airstat to allow 
temps of a steady 35 degrees.


Hope this clears things up for some.

Subject:  5 liter Mini Kegs


I just purchased a mini-kegging setup this weekend, and put it to use right
away kegging a Guinness-style stout that was sitting in the carboy
awaiting bottle washing.


My question is, that in my usual do-it-first-read-instructions-later-style, 
I may have over-primed.  I used about 5/8 c corn sugar for priming, 
which I lamely reasoned, was a reduction in my usual 3/4 to 1c.  I bottled
half of the five gallon batch as usual.  After finishing up and sitting back to
read the keg directions, I was dismayed to find that the mfr. recommends
about 1/3 c.


Have I got little 5-liter grenades ticking away?  Should I tuck them
somewhere out of the way in anticipation of the burst, or will they be all
right? I have heard horror stories about these cans swelling or bursting if
overprimed.  Can I maybe release the pressure if the start to distend?
One consolation is that fermentation was good and over when I primed.
The beer was dead flat, and had been in secondary about two weeks, so
there was no residual carbonation from fermentation.


Maybe one other solution would be to let it carbonate about a week and
then refrigerate the kegs to slow down further yeast activity and
carbonation?  'Course, stouts don't generally last too long around me
anyway, so it might not be a problem :)  Also, if I use 1/3 c as
recommended, will my  bottles that I fill from the same batch carbonate
adequately, or am, I going to have to prime the kegged protion, and then
prime more for the bottled portion?


Thanks for any thoughts, and please post here; there has been a dearth
of info about mini-kegs (yes I do know about the FAQ) and I would like to
disseminate as much info about them here as possible.

A recent pale ale batch, still in secondary, doesn't seem to have cleared as
well as usual, or as desired.  It seems too cloudy for its 1.042 OG, though
there is some 90-L and 10-L in the mix.


My question is, has anyone used isinglass to clear a brew?  Does it work
well, and does it take out flavor?


I used Irish moss and sparkolloid in the boil, FWIW.

Well, I brew in my kitchen, not my wife's.  I was actually 
blessed to find a house that had TWO kitchens.  One is my
brewery, one is her kitchen.  All the advantages you claim,
plus all the advantages of a kitchen, ie sinks, drains,
cabinets, stove for decoctions, etc.  This has definitely 
created more harmony in my marriage.  


Now for my problem.  My stove recently decided not to work
any more.  Had something to do with the bubble gum acting
like solder and electrical tape.  So my question is; for all
the reasons previously stated, I do not want to use propane
in my kitchen.  I would like to find a large electric cooker
that would be more efficient than a stove.  I have checked 
two restaurant supply stores with no luck. 220V is fine.
Anyone have any ideas ?

Message:
My brewbuddy and I were sitting around over the holidays, having a few 
brews when the conversation turned to scuba diving.  We were 
discussing good dive sites (i.e. something to see in the water and 
someplace to go for a beer and food after) when Darryl went to the 
fridge to top up his mug.  He seemed to stop in deep thought as his 
eye caught sight of the corny keg sitting in the fridge.  "Hmmmmm" was 
all I heared as he disappeared into his garage and returned with a 
measuring tape.  Several short measurements later I heared: "Thought 
so!" and an idea was born.  BREWBA DIVING!!!
 
As it turns out, the corny keg and Darryl's scuba tank have exactly 
the same diameter.  Therefore, if you want to take your favourite 
beverage with you, beneath the waves, just replace one of the scuyba 
tanks with the corny keg, connect the gas-in fitting to the scuba tank 
and the liquid-out to a selector valve on the regulator.  When thirsty 
while diving, select brew and enjoy.
 
Seriously though DONT TRY THIS.
 
Merrily yours

Subject: Water pH adjustments


My water is pH 7.3 so I am following Miller's advice on treating the
sparge water with Lactic acid.  I'm using Lactic instead of gypsum
because my total alkalinity is high (168). Is this valid logic?  
I mixed 88% lactic at 1tsp/1.5 cups, then added this to my sparge 
water at 4tsp/gallon. The pH reading didn't change much at all!  
Why?  Miller says this concentration of lactic changes his water 
from pH 9.5 to pH 5.7!  I need to understand whether I should treat my
water, at what rate, and with what substance to make the best pale
ales.  I really don't care about matching styles, and I know I should be
checking the pH of the runnings (around 5.7). 


Some locals have said NOT to treat the water, but some of those folks
also told me NOT to make STARTERS for my liquid yeast... so I'm
asking here.  How should I treat my water for PALE ALES?


I don't understand everything in Miller's water chapter, so please tell
me if I'm off-base in my assumptions :-)


My water:
- ---------
Carbonate: ?
Bicarbonate: ?
Total Alkalinity: 168
Total Hardness: 173
Calcium: 45
Magnesium: 14
Sulfate: 14

Subject: Irish Moss


I began using Irish Moss and have a question.  After boiling and cooling,
my wort contains no large coagulated proteins, just some fine sediment
at the kettle bottom.
The next day I see lots of pieces of stuff flying around in the carboy.
The pieces look like rice krispy treats floating in there.  They were
not present until I started using Irish Moss.  No problem I guess.


It seems that others have reported the proteins were present in the KETTLE 
and not in the primary.(?)  Or am I confusing hot break with cold break
with trub (?)  I don't see any large pieces of ANYTHING in the kettle, 
just in the primary, but I do use hops bags in the kettle.


I'm not worried, just curious.  I'm using Irish Moss at 0.5 TBL per 5
gallons, rehydrated, and for most of the 60 min boil.

It might be mineral deposits.  If so, some product like Lime Away or white
vinegar (something acidic) should help remove them especially if they are
carbonates.

I would agree with your assessment about the likelihood of hop resins
in the krauesen becoming oxidized.  I would also expect that most of
the air (and consequently the oxygen it contains) would have been
expelled by the carbon dioxide given off by the fermentation process.

Hi all,


Dan Walker asked about brewpubs in St. Louis. I was there 7 weeks ago and
visited 2 breweries (not AB!). The Tap room is located near Union Station
a few blocks north of Market Street (near 21st Street?). Nice place, they
offered about 6-8 brew selections, the two I sampled were good. Over in
Fairview Heights, Illinois, J.D. Nicks is located at 1711 West Hwy 50. I
sampled 3 of 5 brews and they were all very good, I think someone said
they were just getting a new brew master in mid-November. They have a full
menu and are generally open from 8am to 9 or 10 pm.


Even though I hate to embarrass myself like this, does any one have a
good (?) recipe for a Busch Beer clone? (I hate the stuff, but my father-
in-law lives near St Louis and loves the stuff). Thanks in advance.
