 Saw Lee Bussy's comment on the Taylor thermostat and thought I would comment on
  my experience with it. There was a modification that was going around the HBD
 on how to shift the scaling of the thermometer. I did not care for the amount
 of offset that the original modification offered, so I did my own version.
 The thermistor used for the sensor has a negative temp coefficient, so that
 makes modification easy for what homebrewers need. All you have to do is
 connect a 91 kohm resistor across the terminals where the external thermistor
 connects to the circuit board. I would advise you to add a switch to disconnect
 the resistor when using the unit over 40 degrees, as the resistor makes the
 thermometer readout incorrectly at warmer temperatures.


 So with this modification the readout is offset by 10 degrees, making lagering
 easy to do. The temperature will also read down to 30 degrees ( 40 less 10 degr
 ee offset ).


 If you are looking for a Taylor unit, I have a few that I picked up on
 clearance that I wont be needing. Email me for more info.

Hi all,        
     I read this question about Cote Des Blancs yeast and thought that I may
be able to reply with something usefull (one man's opinion...).  
     Anyway, I've been using this yeast for all of my meads.  I find it to be
a rather slow fermenter, and one that typically leaves some residual sugar.
My last batch started off at 1.100 and ended at 1.034, after a few *months*.
It also took 2nd place at a local competition.  I've also found this yeast to 
start off pretty strong and very slowly taper off, just as was mentioned here.
     The Mead Lover's Digest has a fair amount of info. on wine/mead yeasts.
E-mail me if you want the stuff that I've filed away.  I know alot of beer 
brewers also make mead (myself included), but since this is a beer forum I 
won't post the info. here unless there is alot of interest.
     In short, if you want a dry cider, use a champagne yeast.  The Cote Des
Blancs will most likely leave some sugar and ferment slower but you'll still
end up with something that is pretty good.  Relax and don't worry...
              


                                        Regards,

The refrigerator I use is an old General Electric, the rounded shoulders type
with the freezer inside on the top. Probably about 10 cubic feet.
Anyhow, this works great. It holds 47 F quite steadily and will drop down to
33 F or so for lagering.
I only wish it was larger!

        Well we got our first one, and it looks as though it is now about 2
months away before Seattle, WA will be enjoying its' first batch of U-Brew
Seattle... ales, wines, and lagers!  The Canadian trend moving into the
states.  Batches of 12.5 gallons `at` $80-100 dollars.  Using beautiful Brass
and all the other Micro-brewery equipment any homebrewer would *die* for!
This sounds "ok" to me :-)


        My hope is for discussion by you'all on the typical pro's and *any*
con's that there might be with these alternatives to Homebrewing.  I think
keeping this topic on the Digest for a while would be fun and educational
at the least.  As far as I know... Canada and California are the only areas
fortunate enough to have experienced the U-Brew heaven??  Now the state of
Washington joins in on the fun.


        For a busy person, such as myself... I must say this alternative
may put some serious dust on my carboys, if you catch my drift :-)

Subject:  Roller Mill Corrections and pH Ref Solutions


Hi all,


I got a digital pH meter for Christmas and the instructions 
talk about calibrating the meter with 4.01 pH reference solution.
Various homebrew shops sell this but it seems rather pricey to
me.  Can this stuff be made with deionized water and a known
amount of x% acid?  Or should I just bite the bullet and buy the
stuff?


I wanted to pass on a couple of clarifications to the mill plans
that were brought to my attention.  Thanks to all who provided
feedback and suggestions for mill improvement,  keep it coming.


Drawing 1.  The pulley on the top and front views should have
been drawn on the left side versus the right.  The side view
would then show the oval slot and bolt head instead of the
pulley.  


Drawing 2.  The rabbets on the top view should be 3/4" wide by
7/16" deep.  The 3/4" inch dimension allows the front and back of
the mill body to seat flush with the sides.  The 7/16" dimension
when mated with the 9" wide front and back sections makes the
interior of the mill body 8 1/8" wide.  


A couple more clarifications; the rollers are 8 inches long. 
Also, the rear roller is the powered roller and stays stationary
in relation to the motor so the belt tension stays constant. 


Sorry for any confusion that may have occurred, hope this clears
things up a bit.

=>And where are you guys finding "food grade sealant", i havn't seen tube 1 !!


I posted this information some time ago in the Digest, but I will repeat
myself.  The tube of Dow Corning 100% Silicone Sealant distributed by DAP
states that it is safe for food contact.


 "SAFE FOR FOOD CONTACT:  When cured and washed, ingredients which remain
  or which could migrate to food are listed in FDA Regulation No. 21 CFR
  177.2600. 


  Contact supplier for Material Safety Data Sheet which contains detailed
  use and health information."


Both the "Clear" and "White" sealants that I looked at had the above
statements.  I might could locate the MSDS, but it should be available
wherever you buy the sealant.  I think the building supply place
called DAP and they faxed the sheet to the store.




***************************************


        The above sealants can be found at Home Depot in the paint 
department.  I have used the clear 30 year in a mash tun for above
1 1/2 years (submerged in 155 F. mashes).  Just let it cure good (absence
of vinegar smell).  If you've got some thickness (more than an 1/4") to
seal, do it in steps, letting each step cure before applying the next.

     Susie Fleck recently inquired about the origins of a
window with Brouwerij De Hertog inscribed on it.
     I am not sure if this is the same, but in Michael Jackson's
New World Guide to Beer there is a mention about Hertog Jan,
which is as follows:
       
       The Belgian giant Artois has the Dommels brewery, in
       Valkenswaard [Netherlands]... Dommels produces the 
       bottom-fermenting beers in the range of the distributor
       Hertog Jan ("Duke John"). The top-fermenting Hertog
       Jan beers are produced by Arcen, in Limburg.


     Of course, it could just be another brewery that uses the
word Hertog (Duke) in it's name. In any case it sounds like
you have an interesting find.

Subject: FOOP's Revisited


Warning... lengthy post on FOOP's!!


I followed the discussion of "foam only once proteins" with interest. For me,
the whole issue boils down to one question. When I shake a keg to force
carbonate the beer, does the head formation/retention suffer? After all, one of
the reasons I do all grain brews is the superior head retention and mouthfeel
that results. I was never happy with those characteristics of my extract brews.


I set out to answer the above question for myself and now have the results to
share. I did not attempt to make this experiment very scientific and I don't 
think it was necessary to do so. 


As the discussion continued on the HBD, I had a beer in the secondary just 
waiting to be kegged. I also had two empty corny kegs so I decided to split
the batch (6 gal.US) between the two. Both kegs were carbonated using the
widely available carbonation chart of temp./pressure for desired volumes of
CO2. I aimed for 2 volumes in this beer which I believe required 7 lbs. at
40 F. (I often chill prior to kegging). One keg was shaken vigorously to
obtain the desired carbonation while the other was left under pressure in
the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.


Since each keg was only partially filled (3 gal.) the potential for producing
foam in the shaken keg was greater than usual. I did not time the duration of
the shaking session since the length of time required should be reasonably
constant from batch to batch. After a couple of weeks I drew beer from each
keg until I had similar flow from each with similar carbonation and pressure.
Now that I am drinking from both kegs I frequently draw a glass from each and
compare the head formation and retention side by side. In every case I have 
seen no discernible difference between the two. I get a thick creamy head which
drops after a few minutes to a level which is sustained for the duration. An
impressive formation of lace follows the level of the beer as it progresses to
the bottom of the glass. 


My conclusion is that, for my brewing, FOOP is a non-issue. If agitation spoils
the foaming potential of proteins, my brews have more than enough available and
I won't worry about shaking a keg to get the beer to the glass more quickly.
If the eye of the most important judge of MY homebrew (ME) cannot detect a
difference then there is no need to worry. 


It should be noted that I do not use a pump or other apparatus for wort
aeration but rely on a 3 foot drop from the chiller to the primary and some
vigorous stirring/splashing which also produces a fair amount of foam but I
would guess that it is not nearly as much as a pump would generate. It should
also be noted that this was an all grain brew which should contain significantly
more proteins than an extract batch. There was mention of this in the latest
Zymurgy. It would be interesting to have an extract brew compared in the same
manner since FOOP's might have more impact. Sort of like brain cells and having
a beer. If you kill a few out of millions who will notice, if you only have 12
left, the effect could be more dramatic!


I hope some of you find the results of my "experiment" useful.

Subject: Low alpha acid


        Boy did I goof!  On Nov. 26 I brewed a Vienna style larger.  The 
recipe called for 1 oz. Hallertauer (10%) hops.  Last night after 
checking the specific gravity in the secondary, I tasted the beer and 
discovered it had no bitterness to it at all.  After checking my bag of 
Hoplets, I discovered the alpha acid is only 2.9%,  7.1% less then the 
recipe called for.
        I need to know if I can boil, lets say 1/2 gallon of water, with 
3/4 oz. of Hallertauer (10%) hop pellets for 45 min.  Cool the water/hops 
and add it to my secondary.  This should bring my IBU's into the ball 
park.  Any suggestions, comments will be greatly appreciated.

This is an understatement!  I know the message was meant in jest,
and I know this isn't about brewing, but I just wanted to enforce
the message the drinking while scuba diving is *bad* news.  The
further down you go, the more the effects of alcohol will be.  One
beer turns into 6 real quick.  Normally not a bad idea, but with
a limited oxygen supply and several atmospheres of pressure on you. . .

Lately I brewed my first batch of beer. I bottled the brew with 3/4 of a cup
of corn sugar to the five gallons. The bottles were left at room temperature
in covered containers for two weeks. The bottles have good carbonation at room
temperature and if quick cooled in the freezer for 20-30 minutes. If the bottles
are left in the freezer for 40+ minutes or left in the refrigerator overnight
the beer is totally flat. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated. Send to
personal e-mail or post on the HBD.

Another method is to use baking soda.  Fill the bottom of your pot
with about an inch of water and then place baking soda on top of your
burned on spots.  Boil for a couple of minutes and then let sit for a
bit.  You can usually just scrape off the black at this point with a
plastic spatula (or other appropriate non-scratch utensil).


I find that I need to use a flashlight to illuminate the bottom of the
enamel pot to see the burned on spots.  Having had to volunteer my
large pots for the holiday season, I have had to do this to save them
for the intended use. :)

Howdy, y'all---


I finally, after a 3 month absence, got to brew a batch of beer on Saturday.
Usually, I use liquid yeast, following the manufacturer's instructions & popped
the yeast the day before.  Unfortunately, that was Thursday, being as that I
thought I would get to brew on Friday.  Well, I thought that this was the
perfect opportunity to do a proper starter.  So, following my local homebrew
shop propietor's suggestions, I boiled up a pint of H2O with a couple of
tablespoons of priming malt in the microwave, put a clean lid on it, & after
it cooled, I added the already puffed up package of WYeast British Ale (sorry,
don't recall the number).  This foamed up nicely, & I pitched it in the wort
on the actual brewing day, Saturday.  The bill (for 5 gallons):


3/4# American Crystal malt
1/2# Aromatic grains
7# Alexander's pale malt extract
1/2# malto-dextrin
1/4# turbinado
2 tbsp Irish moss
hops galore (pellets)
the yeast


It's supposed to be a pale ale.  Anyway, the problem is that it started to
ferment rather nicely, but the head never got more than 3/4 of an inch thick.
The fermentation has been very active (it slowed down on Monday night some),
& the yeast on top looks healthy, but it's just not thick.  I did use a filter
on the funnel when I put the wort into the carboy, & I had to top it off with
about a gallon of preboiled water.  I'm not worried about it, but I am
curious as to what's going on.  Usually I get this head that's 2 inches thick
& looks alive.  The temp has been sitting at 68, BTW.


A couple of observations unrelated to the above:


Sam Adams Triple Bock tastes good on vanilla ice cream.


Baptists don't believe in drinking because most of them drink real cheap beer.

Everything I know about this stuff I learned from Miller (not really, but he
sort of refreshed my memory from Chem I, oh so many years ago), but I'll give
it a try.  Your water pH of 7.3 doesn't mean much at all; the buffering effect
of the ions in solution controls the pH.  "Alkalinity", at 168 ppm, I believe
indicates the total carbonates and bicarbonates, and it is pretty high.  These
would pull the pH up.  The hardness is equally high, at 173 ppm, so the pH
remains close to neutral.  This solution is heavily buffered by all these
ions, which is why the acid addition didn't affect the pH much.  I don't
remember exactly but I suspect Miller's water is much softer than yours.
You said it yourself, you should be checking the pH of the runnings, not the
sparge water, so go do it.  This hard water, unadjusted, is probably fine for
pale ales, BTW.  Oh, and reread the Miller water chapter until it makes
sense.  I need to go back and read it myself.

Norm

That's a good question. I too have 2 mini-kegs with a first attempt Bock

I hope this works. The beer was kegged about 6 days ago and so far no problems.
I'll post again if this changes or in a week to ten days when I tap the first
one.

Hi to All!


I have recently decided to start brewing lagers and, after having read
Greg Noonan's Brewing Lager Beers and Dave Miller's Continetal Pilsner,
have some questions for the experts:


Background:


   Apparently there are some traditional methods and modern methods (Greg
   Noonan seems to be traditional, while Dave Miller mentions modern 
   methods.) Given that the modern methods shorten the time frames 
   considerably, I would prefer to use the modern methods.


1) What are the pros and cons of removing hot break and then cold break 
   separately vs. at the same time? 


2) Has anyone devised a fast way to cool wort from 212 to "slushy" as
   Greg Noonan recommends, or to below 40 as Dave Miller suggests? My 
   immersion chiller will take me down to 60 on a cold winter day and 
   about 65 during the summer. What is a good way to get down the next
   20 or 30 degrees? If I racked it into a cornelius, displaced the O2
   with CO2 could I let it chill in my freezer overnite with no adverse
   reaction?


3) What is the best temperature for diacytel rest? I have read 53, 58 and
   recently 60. I am using the Bohemian Yeast from Wyeast.




thanks!

Jon Olsen asked about TNCJOHB Who's in the Garden Cru...my experience
with it has been limited to modifying it to make fruit beers...I've
found that leaving out the coriander and orange peels and adding
fruit to the primary makes an AMAZING fruit beer (if that's your thing).
So I would imagine that the reicipe as published is pretty good...I
don't know if it's true to a 'real' Grand Cru or not though.


*************


Dan Roman is concerned about the deposits that developed on his
carboy when he left bleach in it for an extended period of time.
My take on it is RDWHAHB.  I've had some pretty ugly crud on my
carbiys at times, and I've alweays figured as long as it's 
sanitized, don't worry about it....scrape off what you can and leave
the rest.  (Ok, not very scientific...)


*************


In the past, I have always brewed a slightly modified version of
Papazian's Rocky Racoon Honey Ginger Lager for the summertime
beverage of choice (if you up the ginger to about 4-6 oz. it 
becomes the driest, snappiest, most refreshing beer I've ever
has IMHO).  It's that time of year again, but this time, I want
to make a double batch in my 40L carboy I have.  (I used it 
once before, so I know I can move it when it's full)  Now that
I'm kegging, i thought it would be terrific to have 2 kegs to take
to the Telluride Bluegrass Festival (Bill Bird, watch out!).  So
my question is this:  I want to make it as an all-grain as opposed
to the extract recipe I have been making, and need help making the
conversion.  Any advice?  I don't have it in fron of me, but I
recall the recipe to be along the lines of 6 lbs. of light extract 
and 2 lbs. honey.....something along those lines.  TIA!

I have just been mashing in my 33 qt. enamel-on-steel pot for some

most temperature rests without any serious fluctuations.)  But I

handle most of my needs.  My question:  will this hold up to the

stories of coolers melting.  This is the cooler we use when we go
camping for weeks on end, and if I melt the bugger down, my SO 
will never forgive me.  Any stories/info appreciated.  Thanks!

I'm asking the help of all you chemists out there.  I have the 
opportunity to get any type of chemistry supplies free of charge.  
(Stoppers, thermometers, etc).  I already have the necessary equipment 
for brewing, but am looking for 'helpful/timesaving items' or backups.


I've already got 10 stoppers, an extra thermometer, and 2 buckets.  Can 
anyone think of anything else?  The catalogs aren't allowed to leave the 
lab, and I'm not allowed to enter.  So I have to give my 'supplier' a list.


One thing he DID offer me was paint cans (of sorts)!  They'll one gallon 
each, metal (stainless steel), the lids are airtight, and are drillable for 
the airlocks.  Since they're used for transporting samples of plastics 
(in liquid form), they're coated with something.  Should I risk using 
these instead of bottles?  My  friend has assured me that the coating is 
equivalent to using a food grade bucket, but I'm sceptical.


Any similar experiences or advice, or additions to what I can order?

Subject: Bad hsa effects with all Munich malt lagers


(From *Jeff* Renner)


I have now made two all Munich malt and one all Vienna (plus ~10% 
crystal) lagers, and all three suddenly developed strong, wet 
cardboard/caramel flavors and aromas indicative of hsa.  In 20+ years 
of brewing with perhaps 150 brews, these are the only three to have 
suffered this, and are the only three I have brewed from these dark 
malts, both Ireks earlier and Durst most recently.  The most recent was a 
1.044 dunkle with 9# Durst Munich, 1# Baird 50^ crystal for 7-1/2 gal., 
decotion mashed, 2 week ferment, 6 week lager.  It was great on tap for 
six weeks (half consumed at one party).  Then I transferred it from the 
Sankey to a completely CO2 filled Cornelius and moved it to a 50^F cellar 
to save fridge space (it had been at 42^F).  I don't know if the 
agitation hastened the crash; I suspect that the higher temp did.  This 
was a sudden crash.  From no signs to full disaster when I next tasted 
it 10 days later.  I strongly suspect that these dark malts are extra 
susceptible to hsa.  These are only three data points, but they are 
distinct.  I'd welcome any comment.

very well made and they have a nice cask conditioned ale hand pumped up from
the cellar in the true British style (I guess!).  I think the basic recipes
were developed by the original brewmaster (did I read somewhere that it was
brewing author Dave Miller??) who left last summer to brew in Louisiana.  The
beer I drank was being made by a woman ( the assistant to the original
brewmaster?) who was doing a splendid job!  They also have superb pub food
