Subject: Temporary & permanent hardness


Dear Friends, in #1624 Al K. commented on what constitutes temporary and
permanent hardness, and averred that permanent hardness has more to do
with Ca and Mg than whether things are carbonates or sulphates.  Well, yes
and no.  All I know is that alkaline-earth bicarbonates will form
(carbonate) precipitates upon boiling and sulphates will not.  So if your
analysis shows, for example, the bulk of your Ca as carbonate, you will
eliminate that proportion by preboiling and racking off the residue.  If
the bulk of the Ca is as sulphate, you're stuck with it unless you resort
to much more involved procedures.  So although I do not dispute Al's
remarks about the role of Mg and Ca in ale brewing waters, I think it
should be pointed out that carbonates are removable and sulphates ain't. 
Do any of you brew historians know when and/or by whom the terms
"temporary" and "permanent" were first applied?  Is there a thesis lurking
in this topic? :-}


Cheers, and happy new year everyone, Dave in Sydney

Subject: Mashing/sparging in a Gott cooler


Hello Everyone!  I was very pleased that Santa brought me a 10 gallon
Gott cooler for Xmas, and I even got a Phil's Phalse bottom to go with it.
Last Monday I used the system for the first time, and now I have a few
questions for the collective brew wisdom of my fellow brewthren.
        I made a brown ale using about 8.5 lbs of pale malt, about 1 lb
of dark crystal, and a little bit o' chocolate malt.  I did a one step
infusion using the cooler as a mash tun.  I was pleased that the temp
held extremely steady.  I mashed for one hour, and iodine test revealed
conversion.
        I then sprinkled 75degC water on top, and opened the outflow tube.
I sparged with a total of about 4 gallons, and it took me about 25 minutes
or so.  The sparge trickled to a near stop, then I tilted the cooler to get
a little bit more out.  I then boiled, added hops, etc, and used my new
wort chiller to chill the wort to yeast pitching temp (I loved the wort 
chiller very much!!). To my surprise (and disappointed), after measuring the
o.g., I calculated a rather low extraction rate (about 22pts/lb/gallon).
Boy, was I bummed!! I got at least 26 with my uninsulated two-buckets
tun system, and the reason I wanted a cooler was so that I could improve
my efficiency.  What was I doing wrong?  Should I have mashed longer
(like for two hours)?  Did I sparge too quickly?  I would appreciate
any advice from experienced users of the Gott-tun system.  BTW, the grain
was crushed with a Phil Mill.  
        I am not attempting to hit the Dave Miller 33 pt/lb/gallon
efficiency, but I'd like to get a little more sugar out of my grain!
I'd appreciate all advice (private email is fine, unless it's of general
interest).


        Thanks so much for the help.  You have all helped me tremendously
over the last few years.

Subject: pH 4.01 buffer solution


Christoper Sack is correct, I dropped a decimal point in my posting.


A pH 4.01 buffer solution is a 0.05M solution of KHP (potassium hydrogen 
phthalate).  I had calculated that as 10.21g/liter of solution which does 
indeed mean that 500g of KHP will yield ~50 l of 4.01 buffer solution.

I brew with extracts and specialty grains, and I have never paid much
attention to water chemistry.  Based on what Al says here, I wonder if I
need to be more concerned.  I have made a couple of stouts that had an
extremely unpleasant sourness.  In both cases, I steeped a fair amount
of roasted barley before adding the extract.  Could the sourness of
these batches be caused by steeping the roasted barley in untreated
water?  I live near Boston, and while I don't know the carbonate content
of the water, I suspect it is low, as our water is extremely soft.


Assuming this is the problem, I suppose that before I steep the roasted
barley, I should add calcium carbonate (chalk, right?) to the water. 
Any ideas how much?  


Thanks,

Subject: light exposure


Thanks to all who responded to my lament regarding HSA.


There is, I suddenly remember, another possible cause of this nasty beer.
I have just started using  an unplugged refrigerator to keep the temp
constant.  In order to  get it up around 65 degrees I ran in a 15 watt
bulb.  For the first four days I left the carboy uncovered, exposed to this
light.  After I realized my error I covered it with a towel.  Could a 15
watt bulb damage the beer?  As I said earlier, when I discribe the taste as
wet cardboard, that is only a shot in the dark.  The flavor is off, though
not sour, astringent, or cidery.   There is no fill-line ring in the
bottles.  That's the best diagnosis I can make.


Thanks in advance for any follow up comments.

6% ale for $80 or so.  That people will pay more for the same *and*

to learn how to use fancy equipment, or a pub wants to experiment with

Hello,

How can one scrub/clean any residue out of the keg?  With a soda keg you just
reach in there and scrub, but I can't get my hand in the little hole on a 
sankey keg.  Is there some cleaning solution that I should be using? and if
so where does one acquire it?


In a related note: How often and how does one go about cleaning the beer lines
that go from the keg to the tap?  Also, sources would be apreciated too.

I recently used Papazian's "Vagabond Gingered Ale" (TNCJOHB) recipe, but
modified it with honey.  I used about 5 oz. ginger at the beginning of
the boil and added ~ 1.5 pounds of honey with 10 minutes left to the
boil.  Since I wanted some of the honey aroma, I added it later in the
boil.  I should have added it with about 5 min. to go.  It boosted the
OG and, consequently, the alcohol, like I wanted.  I really can't help
with the priming issue, since I've only used sugar.  I would think,
tho', that you'd have to boil it first to avoid contamination.


btw, the brew turned out *great*!  It's got a strong ginger aroma and a
moderate ginger flavor.  I would have liked a stronger honey aroma.  The
OG was 1.062, FG 1.018.  Carbonation was a little weak, tho' I'm not
sure why.

mash, but the additional time required has always turned me off.


   Now, having just read 'Bock", I'm all enthused about decoction mashing

   I'd like to hear from anyone who mashes both ways...in particular to the
differences in flavor profile.  eg, If brewing the same recipe with infusion 
and then with decoction mash, how different might the flavor profile be....
is it apt to be subtle or will it jump out at me.

Subject: Soft water/head retention


Anyone have any advice concerning head retention
being adversely affected by soft water? I have a
a bitter made with Wyeast ESB (pale, crystal, biscuit, 
carapils, a little roast) to which I forgot
to add a little gypsum in the mash--water in eastern Long
Island, NY is incredibly soft/sweet.  Beer is nicely carbonated
but does not raise much of a head at all--just a small necklace
of rather thin-looking bubbles.
I should add this is the first batch
in quite a time which wasn't Belgian or Scotch, 
brewed without an addition of some kind of sugar in the boil, 
so maybe my appreciation of it is being a little provincial in 
its memory. 
The Wyeast ESB, by the way, fermented in a much more 
leisurely fashion, compared to other batches using yeast 
cultured from Fullers ESB).
Thanks. Victor

recent marriage!) *Fulltime Employment*! He thought he would be losing his
internet access (or his employer is currently driving him hard enough that he
doesn't have time to offer his wit and wisdom for our enjoyment). I was hoping
that he'd have time to 'sign-off' if he really is gone. Of course he might
have just retreated to 'lurker' status. (And of course if he has I appologize

Subject:       MAKE OR BUY




I am crunching some numbers for a friend who dreams of owning a 
 microbrewery. No question about the quality of his all grain brew. 
He has received many complements and a few awards. Unfortunately, 
the price of commercial all grain brewery is out of reach at this time. 
Contract brew looks like a possibility. Can anybody estimate a cost 
for contract brewed and bottled beer. What type of volume would be
required to start.?


I would expect to be able to buy good beer for less than what it would 
cost me to brew it in 7 to 10 Bbl. batches. Can someone describe the 
economics of  brewing and bottling in house compared to buying a 
contract brew.     
 
Most products on the supermarket shelf sell less  than 1 case per week. 
Anybody got an estimate for the weekly case sales of a popular  22 oz.
 microbrew in a large supermarket?

Subject: Extraction from rice?


The local brewery here in Madison WI (Capitol Brewery) has recently put
out a beer called "Wild Rice."  I'm not particularly fond of the beer
myself, but a few of my friends like it, and I think it would be a good
exercise to try to duplicate it.  


My question for the HBDer's is how does one go about extracting the sugars
from rice? I've looked through both of my books (Papazian and Miller) and
neither seem to mention how to treat rice as a grain.


I know this seems sinful, but I'd like to learn how to extract from rice,
and corn just for the sake of increasing my knowledge base in the brewing
area.


Anybody know a good source for this info, or have a good method on line?

Subject: Killer Microwave


This is directed to P. Molloy  Kalamazoo MI. "Newcomer
to the Net" but I'm posting to the Digest because I
think others can benefit from the following, too:


  >>   I had heard recently that a microwave oven will
  >>   kill bacteria in womans underpants who have
  >>   yeast infections....


I specifically remember seeing an article in the
newspaper in 1988 that detailed a doctor's procedure
for sterilizing womens skivvies of the dreaded
scamper-yeast. The procedure mentiones that the
skivvies should be taken from the washing machine,
rolled up, and put into the microwave:


The microwave oven heats by inducing the water
molecules to vibrate at a higher rate, creating
friction which raises their temperature. This creates
steam, BTW, and heat. The heat is what sterilizes. I
could be wrong, but I suspect that _not that many_
microbes are zapped from the microwaves but from the
heat created by the waves juicing up the water. 


So to prevent over-heating of your utensils in a
microwave oven, put them in a bowl of water; the heat
of boiling will kill the nasties, but keep the utensil
around 212 degrees F.


I personally soak my gear in bleachwater, and rinse in
boiling or hot water (whatever the item will best
tolerate) as this seems to work for me. I don't feel
that a microwave does the job any better. I could be
wrong. 


Metallic objects aren't to good to put in the cavity,
or a dry oven (or what is in the cavity isn't too
microwave-absorbing) could lead to a shorter life for
the magnetron (the thingy that generates the
microwaves).

Subject: Hallertauer hops w/ > 5% AA


Norm Pyle says he would be surprised to see any hop with more than 5%
alpha acid with "Hallertau" in the name.  Well, I have some Hallertau
Northern Brewer at 7.6% alpha acid.  This name means that the hops are
Northern Brewer type hops that were grown in the Hallertau region of
Germany.  There is a Hallertau type of hop and that generally is less
than 5% alpha acid as Norm said.


In general, hop names can be rather confusing and I have found Mark
Garetz' book, "Using Hops" very helpful.

According to the local water chemist, total hardness is the addition of 
temporary and permanent hardness. The temporary hardness (bicarbonate, HCO3)
is comprised of the calcium and magnesium ions in the water and can be boiled
off if enough of these ions are present. Permanent hardness (carbonate, CO3)
is comprised of the chloride and sulfate ions present and cannot be boiled off.
So I think Jim's post is closer to reality.
Another measurement of interest is the total alkinity (CaCO3), measured in ppm
or mg/l. This number gives an indication of the buffering power of your water,
i.e. its ability to resist ph changes from mineral/acid additions. In a recent
post, a brewer was complaining that a specific phosphoric acid addition to his
sparge water did not lower the ph. My guess is that his water has a high total
alkilinity and thus a high buffering capability. The ph of the water has little
bearing on how much acid must be added to reduce sparge water to below ph 6.
example: my water has a ph of 9.4, yet only a tablespoon of 10:1 phosphoric acid
brings it down below 6. Of course the total alkilinity of my water is low, only
60 ppm. 
Hope that helps,
cheers,

Subject: Grain Brewing


Since taking up all-grain brewing 1-1/2 yrs ago, I have (thanks to the
contributors to HBD) developed a brewing system which is about as easy as its
going to get doing all grain. Because many of the refinements to my system
was from the HBD, I feel obligated to contribute my system as a starting
point/opinion/guide for anyone thinking of converting to all grain.
This is a three bucket set up to gravity feed with the top bucket a "Bruheat"
which I use to heat water for mashing, sparging and for the boiling of wort.
My "Bruheat" has served me well, a few tips the make this gadget work better
 - insulate the outside of the bucket. Any closed cell foam at least 1/2"
thick will do. A backpacking sleeping pad seemed to be a favorite among the
HBD'ers. #2 - it is important to keep the element clean. This sucker does get
hot causing the sugars in the wort to caramalize on the element. This coating
really kills the units heat time. The best way I found to clean it is good
old Brillo pads. I realize this is probably not the recommended cleaning
method, but I've been doing mine this way for 1-1/2 years with no ill
effects.
The 2nd level is a mash/lauder tun. This is a 6 gallon bucket with a spigot,
that's another thing, try and find the brand of spigot used in the "Bruheat".
Those $3.95 bottling spigots just don't hold up to heat. Anyway - the 6
gallon bucket is insulated (see "Bruheat", insulation) and fitted with a
"Zap-Pap" bucket, shorten to about 3". I used the bottom of a 5 gal. soy
sauce bucket peppered with 3/32" dia. holes. I drilled 4 - 1" dia holes in
the 3" sides (to help pull it out) and just let it wedge inside at the bottom
of the 6 gal. bucket.(ala false bottom)
The bottom level is a 5 gallon bucket fitted with a spigot (see spigot note
above) used for collection and transport. (Make sure you have a lid for this
guy)
To mash I heat up about 3 gallons of water to 185 deg. Drain this into the
mash/lauder bucket. This should settle out at about 170 which is the strike
temp. I use for 10-12 lbs. of grain. Dump in the grains, dough in making sure
all the grain is wet, check of temp. Should be about 153-155. Cover and stir
every 15 min. for 1 hour. 
Mean while back at the "Bruheat", heat about 4-1/2 gallons of water to 185
for sparging. After 1 hour of mashing top off the mash/lauder tun bucket with
185 deg water. To prevent "channeling" in the grain, drop a dinner plate
(Corelle is my choice) on top of the grain to deflect the sparge water. Crack
the spigot on the mash/launder tun bucket and drain into the bottom bucket.
After collecting the first gallon, recirculate this first gallon back into
the mash/launder bucket. By this time the grains have formed a filter bed, so
do everything possible not to disturb this. The sparging should take about
45-60 min.(Adjust the spigot accordingly). As soon as I accumulated about two
gallons of run off, I dump it into the "Bruheat" and start heating it up to
boiling point. 
After collecting all the wort (save any extra to make yeast starters) boil,
hop, etc. as per recipe. After the boil, turn the "Bruheat" off and let the
wort sit for 20-30 min. to let the hot break settle to the bottom. Drain the
"Bruheat" slowly as not to disturb the hot break, into the 5 gal. bucket.
>From here I cover the bucket and move the show the kitchen sink for the
"cooling of the wort" ritual. My chosen cooling system is 20' of copper tube
(3/8" dia.) with tygon tubing from the bucket to coil and from the coil to
carboy. The cooling media is two 3 lbs. blocks of ice in a sink filled with
water and the coil. I regulate the discharge with a hose pinch clamp based on
the exiting temp. of the wort. (forget trying to use the bucket spigot to
regulate flow. You'll spend the next hour standing next to the bucket,
dicking with the knob, thinking "this is it")
That's pretty much it. Any comments, questions, or suggestions for
improvement gladly accepted.

Subject: Keg Crimes (Reprise)




Many Moons ago, the thread on Keg ownership was hotly debated with one
Louis Bonham making some good arguments on the side of keeping kegs for
the deposit. I was (potentialy) professionaly curious but with no funds
to consult lawers myself on the subject. Being somewhat resourceful I posed
the debate to one T. Jake Leinenkugel (mostly) owner and Heir of 
Leinenkugel's brewery near here in Chippewa Falls, Wi. Jake thought the 
arguments very good also and so kicked the debate upstairs (they are now owned
by Miller Brewing Co.) Today I received a letter from one Kristin A Kaplan,
Senoir Counsel at Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee. She Writes thusly:


"This letter is in response to mail regarding beer keg crimes sent by
Louis L Bonham. According to Mr. Bonham, the entire point of the
inquiry is whether "the transaction [is] a rental of the keg or a
purchase/repurchase contract with a liquidated damages clause?"


Mr. Bonham articulately sets forth a standard hypothetical, based on
UCC 2-403, that depicts a situation where a jewelry store clerk,
either mistakenly or deliberately, sells a watch that was left at the
store for repair. The question posed, is who owns the watch, and the
answer is, that because the jeweler has apparent authority to the
purchasing consumer to pass legal title to the watch, the purchasing
customer gets to keep it. The example accuratly describes the law in 
the hypothetical situation, however the hypo is not analogous to the
situation at hand.


When a home brewer maintains possession of a keg, merely forfeiting
the deposit, the brewer is not a "good faith purchaser," as was the
watch customer in the above hypothetical. Subsection (1) of UCC 2-403,
is intended to protect a purchaser in good faith. A home brewer
is not a good faith purchaser because a reasonable home brewer is 
aware that the keg is property of the brewer, and that the value of a
keg is far greater than the deposit he/she has placed. The cost that a
home brewer would incur should he/she purchase a keg at market,
and the manufacturer's "property of" insignia on the keg ensure that
the home brewer does not purchase in good faith.


Second, a beer retailer is not a merchant who deals in kegs and 
therefore cannot transfer title to the property. Where a person
entrusts possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that
kind (a jeweler entrusted with the repair of a watch for example),
power is given to the merchant to transfer all rights of the entruster
to a buyer in the ordinary course of business. A retailer is licensed to
sell beer,  it is not their intention to deal in beer distribution hardware.
When a brewer transfers possession of the keg to the retailer, only the
power to pass title to the beer within the keg is transferred because
that is the kind of goods in which the merchant deals.


Finally, Mr. Bonham's argument blithly ignores the fact that the
stamp on a keg manifests the owner's intention to remain the rightful
owner of the property."

        3) Brew Wizard from ANTROM Associates in MD for $59.00+FREE P&H<<<<


I've tried the demo version of Brewer's Calculator and found it to be quite
extensive and informative.  Unfortunately I could not enter my own data
(easily, that is!) so it was hard to compare it's resulting calculations with
other programs.  I think I got it off AOL but I can't remember.  Try calling
them direct for a demo copy.  I have also tried Suds (both v3.0 and v3.1) but
have not yet decided to register and use it (it is shareware) because I am
not convinced that the hop calculations are accurate in the latest 3.1
version.  They are vastly different from v.3.0.  The author is quite helpful
and responsive when contacted via email however.  Very easy to use, albeit a
bit clumsy (not really buggy but close!) in it's Windows implementation.  BRF
(Beer Recipe Formulator) is a DOS only shareware program that does a pretty
good job as well but the latest version does not determine approx. alcohol
levels or let you save a recipe to file!! It's user interface is pretty
non-intuitive too, even considering it is a DOS program, not Windows.   And
all three programs that I've tried come up with different IBU calculations
for the same exact hops used although they all pretty much agree on OG and
SRM when given the same grains and extract amounts.  I use Byron Burch's book
and a Brewing Techniques magazine article on hops as a basis for IBU
calculations as they pretty much agree with each other and seem to echo my
experience with my own brews.
If anyone else has tried one of these or any other another program and can
recommend one I would be interested in hearing about your experiences as
well.
