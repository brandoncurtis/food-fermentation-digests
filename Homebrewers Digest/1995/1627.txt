Tim Laatsch asks about a foul smell from his 1728:


I have used this strain for some of my scotch ales and have noticed a 
tendency towards phenolics when fermented warm (>70 deg F).  These 
could be described as smokey perhaps. 


Maybe you could decant the fermented starter and allow it to settle 
in the fridge for a few days and see if the flavor/odor subsides.  It 
may be just a part of the fermentation.

Tom, you will probably need to use a bench style capper for the

will work with a twin-lever type (there may be some).  


Also, some european bottles will not accept a regular cap.  I think

Well HBR's I did it and it wasn't all bad either.  For those newbies out 
there who are still entertaining the idea to convert to All Grain, go 
ahead and take the plunge, it is not as bad as what you may read or 
hear.  I did my frist All Grain yesterday and to my amazement, it was 
actually quite easy and interesting.  Sure the allotted time is abit 
more, but you could use that time to really appreciate your past 
pleasure in the extract or partial grain world  and put them to rest, 
respectfully, ( I did it with C.P. Rocky Road Honey Lager) and take 
pleasure knowing that "Change is Good", in order to develop, one must 
grow.  So....  I made a German Bock from a Grain Kit that my supplier 
"The Brew Shack" out of Tampa Fl put together for me ( no affliation) 
and just went at it.  Total time of process, from heating the H20 
through cool down took just over 4hrs, but the process was worth it, the 
pleasure in watching the conversions taking place and using Wyeast 
cultures are interesting as well (if it takes, that will be even more 
interesting!).  Gravity was at 1.064 at the end of the process prior to 
going into the primary, and the auxillary refrigerator was set at 58 
degrees, so now it is a waiting game.

Bad ness for you Tom, in general it won't work.


What *will* work though is a good old bench capper.  Having been fortunate to
been given an old work horse of this type a number of years ago I can tell
you I have yet to find a cappable bottle that I cannot cap with it.


Your problem is not new.  I believ (from everything I have seen written on
the issue) that the neck of most champagne bottles are to thick or tall
between the top of the bottle and where the grippers in your level model
grab the bottle to squeeze the cap on tight.


As for what champagne bottles to use, if the top looks like it will take a
cap, chances are it will.  Korbel bottles work great!

 We are holding our second annual Beer Tasting in late April at the Puck
 Building in New York City.  I will post information on attending as it
 becomes available.
 
 Meanwhile, we are looking for just a few homebrewers (maybe 3 or 4) to
 bring a couple of gallons each to supplement the standard fare of
 microbrewery products.
 
 Anyone interested?  You can reach me at volfie`at`echonyc.com for further

I have 3 Cornelius (brand) kegs with leaky poppets.  These are
standard kegs with the black handle (not the "full" rubber top).  They
are ball-lock, Pepsi-style kegs.


I bought replacement poppets for these kegs, but after installing them my
sockets would "bottom-out" before locking in place.  It felt like the sockets
needed to travel 1/16" farther onto the shell for the locking ring to pop into
the locked position.  Wrong poppets?  


I hear that there is only one poppet style for Cornelius brand kegs.  If 
this is true, what course of action should I take to resolve this problem?

Permanent hardness is the calcium and magnesium that remains in solution
with the sulfate ion. If the calcium and magnesium precipitates out with
the bicarbonates after boiling, the hardness is temporary. Here's what
Noonan has to say on this subject, "Brewing Lager Beer", p. 47:


"That part of the calcium and magnesium in solution that precipitates out
with the bicarbonates during boiling cannot be calculated to support
yeast activity. This is know as temporary or carbonate hardness of water.
   After boiling, the calcium and magnesium ions that remain in solution
with the sulfate ion form permanent or noncarbonate hardness."


>My
>understanding is also that carbonates have a very strong ability to lower
>the pH 


Actually, carbonates provide a strong alkalinity buffer that *resists* drops
in pH. This is one reason why many dark beer styles originated in cities
with highly carbonate water, such as Dublin and Munich. The carbonate
buffers the mash, and prevents over acidification from dark malts.


>>Here I must disagree. My first few attempts at pale ales using this type of

Yes, I'm quite sure. My first few attempts at brewing all-grain pale ale were
not exactly stunning successes. I had a lot of trouble getting the mash pH
right, and the beers had a harsh bitterness that rendered them nearly
undrinkable. Pre-boiling the mash and sparge water and allowing the
bicarbonate to precipitate out overnight solved both problems.
While it's true that Guinness is highly hopped, and it's bitterness is not
harsh, I'm not sure it's a valid counterexample. It's a stout, the grain bill
has a high percentage of roasted barley and dark roasted malts, whereas a 
pale ale has neither.
My personal experience aside, the undesirable effects of brewing pale, highly
hopped beers with high carbonate water is fairly well documented.


Noonan, "Brewing Lager Beer", p. 52:


"It contributes a harsh, bitter flavor overwhelming in delicate lagers, and
carbonate in excess of 200 ppm (which my water has - Jim) is tolerable only
when a dark roasted malt is used to buffer its excessive acidity.
Preferably, carbonate should be less than 50 ppm when pale malt or infusion
mashing is used."


Darryl Richman, "Bock", p. 39:


"The bitter character of even the finest noble hops rapidly becomes harsh
in very carbonate water."
"Also, a high hopping rate would be exaggerated by the carbonate induced
harshness,"


Darryl Richman, "Bock", p. 68:


"Carbonate waters have been called 'hop savers', but in fact, they emphasize
the strong bitterness of the hops, and tend to hide the finer flavors. High
alpha acid hops are particularly affected by this, and yield very rough,
coarse flavors that quickly become unpleasant."


>>The hardness in the water at Burton-on-Trent, home
>>of the pale ale style, is due to high *sulfate* content. The sulfate content
>>of the water emphasizes hop bitterness and flavor in a clean, pleasant manner.


>Hmmm?  Again, I'm not sure I agree.  The hardness in the water of Burton-
>on-Trent is due to the calcium and, since this apparently comes from
>Gypsum in the ground, the sulphate levels are correspondingly high.


This was a rather ugly mis-statement on my part, though it's also somewhat
out of context. The original poster cited a figure of only 14 ppm sulfate
in his water, the point I was trying to make was the high level of sulfate in
the water at Burton-on-Trent (over 500 ppm if memory serves, don't quote me)
and the effect this has on hop bitterness and flavor. I then recommended the
addition of 1/2 teaspoon of gypsum directly to the kettle at the start of
the boil to boost the sulfate content. I don't think it's necessarily
desirable to emulate specific water profiles, and it may not even be possible,
but I do think a little judicious tinkering can help.

use a water and TSP solution.  this will work very well.  basically, mix up
a TSP solution concentrate, put it in the keg, then fill the keg to the top.
shake it up and let it sit for 2-3 days.  then, rinse it.  becareful using
TSP, it is nasty stuff.  also, be sure to get non-cloronated TSP.

Hey folks,


I have a question for all you beer sleuths out there.   I've been brewing
for a while, quite happily, without any problems so far, but my latest
batch has been languishing in the primary fermentor, completely inactive
after nearly a week.   I've repitched it but still nothing.   It's a dark
beer (s.g. 1.065) and I used unsulphured blackstrap molasses in it.   I
initially pitched it with Edme dry yeast and then again with Manchester dry
yeast.   Every time I have used Edme, it has been a very vigorous yeast and
that is what I was hoping for this time.   The only thing that is different
was my sanitation procedure.   When I first started brewing, I used a
diluted bleach solution and never had any infection problems but then I
changed to iodine which is generally fine but lately when I brew a heavier
brew, there has been a slight trace of infection which actually mellows
nicely if you leave it in cool storage for a long time but I wanted to make
sure this brew wouldn't get infected, so I decided to switch back to
bleach.   The only thing that I can think of is maybe my bleach was not
diluted enough and now nothing will grow in my wort.   This seems a little
hard for me to believe because it doesn't reek of bleach and I used the
same strength I always did. Well, that's about all I can think of.  Any
suggestions.   Personal email would be preferable.
TIA for your help.   And I have enjoyed reading the digest, when I can find
the time.   I've gotten lots of helpful hints in the past.   Take it easy,
Chuck

Subject: BrewSacks


Doland Cheung asked about BrewSacks,


I had a friend who had the unfortunate experience of spending 6 months (over
both Thanksgiving and Christmas) in a very small tent camp in Antarctica
without any beer. Even in the "big" base at McMurto (sp?) the beer they had was
5 year old Bud that had been frozen a few times.


I sent my friend 2 brewSacks to help relieve his situation. From a review of
the BrewSack I knew they have some sugar in them and produce a beer that is a
bit thin and bland for the average homebrewer. Thus I also sent along some
specialty grains and some hop extract. Apparrently, the beer turned out pretty
well and my friend was the most popular guy in camp for a while.


Bottom Line: When heating the water to add to the sack, steep a pound of
crystal malt in it. Remove the malt when the water starts to boil. Then add
an ounce or so of hops to the water and boil them for an hour. (make sure you
use enough water to have the proper volume after the hour boil). You can use
hop extract to eliminate the hour boil if you are trying to keep it simple.


I think BrewSacks are an excellent way to make homebrew if you don't have any
equipment for fermenting/bottling/dispensing, such as when you are in the
middle of Antarctica. They are also nice to give to someone to start them out
homebrewing. Unfortunately, they are too expensive to continue to use and you 
need to add specialty malts and hops to make really good beer with them.


Also if you clean them well after use, you can reuse them with your own malt
extract recipe.


Hope I have been of some help,

A quick question on hard cider follows.  I know it's not beer 
related, but I've seen cider discussed previously here.  I 
usually brew beer, but this weekend I got the urge to try cider.  
A major dilemma quickly ensued - no fresh cider!  Having missed 
the fresh cider season in the fall, I discovered that all of the 
"fresh" cider as stores contained a preservative, spicifically 
"less than 1/10 of one percent potassium sorbate for freshness".


My gut instinct told me that if this was enough to do in 
bacteria, then ale yeast likely would not stand a chance.  Does 
anyon[Ce know what this stuff is?  Has anyone had experience with 
it?  Any and all suggestions, techniques (recipes also) are 
welcome!  Private e-mail is fine, but I believe others would be 
interested, so please post public if possible.

It is possible that you can super heat water in the microwave.
I have experienced this myself.  You can heat water so much that it
will just about explode when something is added to it to give
a nucleation point for steam bubbles to form.


I don't know if the water is actually hotter than 212 (I can't
see how that's possible, but I'm no physicist) but it will violently
boil over when the vessel is disturbed.


I've tried putting a themometer in the water right after the
microwave is turned off, but the themometer cooled off the water, so
I didn't get a good reading.  Next time, I'll have the themometer in
boiling water ready to dunk in the 'nuked water and see if the temp
goes up.  I don't have the guts to put the thermometer IN the microwave
while heating.


BTW I routinely use the microwave to sanitize objects as well as bottles.

    -     man, only finished my second ferment and this bottling is
    for the birds!  what's the current concensus on using 2 liter pop
    bottles for beer that will be consumed with 1 month of bottling?
    Procedures?  Caveats?


    -     I plan on making a medium flavored/medium bodied Ale with
    some kind of hot-pepper adjunct for 'tweaking' the flavor.  I
    don't want to overpower the drinker with the pepper flavor
    (probably a mix of jalepeno and haberno peppers) - I am leaning
    towards making a pepper 'tea' and adding the liquid just prior to
    bottling.  I am assuming that adding the peppers to the boil would
    impart too much pepper heat to the brew - correct me if I am wrong
    and inundate me with hints.


    -     well, now that I have started I must say that brewing is fun
    (and I haven't even had one of my beers yet!) and that a major
    part of it is the company a home brewer must keep - you netfolk,

Subject: oven use/yeast test/private posting


     Ian asked about baked beer. I found the oven useless for raising mash 
     temperature--no good way to tell where to set the oven thermostat to 
     increase the temperature in the kettle (and also verrrry slow). What 
     the oven works well for is maintaining the mash temp. I kettle mash, 
     raising the temperature to where I want it on a burner. Then, I stick 
     the kettle in the pre-heated oven (usually at my oven's lowest 
     setting, 170 f) and hold it there for however long I want. Then I pull 
     the kettle, put it back on the burner, to increase mash temp again. I 
     usually use the low/high temp mash procedure for American 2-row, and 
     this oven-holding method works super.
     
     Another subject: A crude little yeast experiment, to see what worked 
     at my basement's winter temperature (about 52 to 62 degrees, depending 
     on the outside weather). I splurged and bought brand new: American Ale 
     yeast from both Wyeast and Yeast Lab, London Ale from both Wyeast and 
     Yeast Lab, and California lager, from Yeast Lab. Made identical 
     starters, then pitched in 5 one-gallon jugs of identical wort (a 
     pale-ale type), side-by-side in my normal basement brewspot. The clear 
     winner: both London Ales. Started faster, went to full kreusen faster, 
     fermented out much faster (4 days). The California lager was next, 
     slower, but okay. Both versions of American Ale are still fermenting 
     after 18 days in the jug, and a sniff test shows some peculiar 
     "fruity" smell in both. It'll be a while before I can do serious taste 
     test, but I'm going to be using mostly London Ale yeast for winter ale 
     brewing. (The Yeast Lab # is A04, but I can't remember the Wyeast #. I 
     think it was called "London (Whitbread)" or something weird like 
     that.)
     
     On the subject of posting to the HBD or doing individual e-mail, I 
     much prefer posts to the net, PROVIDING people put in reasonable

Dec 24th I put together 5lbs 2 row, 1lb 10l crystal, 1lb carapils and 6.6lbs
NW Gold LME, Eroica and homegrown Tettnang. No I didn't get Sg, hydro fell
and broke. Primary until 31 Dec, racked to secondary, attached blowoff hose
till 4 Jan, attached airlock. Beer has been in garage covered with brown
paper to ward off sunlight. The temp in the garage has never been above 40F
and for the last 10 days has been between 25-35F.  I am still getting about
6-8 bubbles a minute from the airlock and the beer has not frozen, even
though the water bucket has. I used a quart starter of Wyeast Pilsen cultured
from a previous lager made in Sept. Is this kind of yeast activity normal for
these temps? I'm not worried, just amazed everytime I check the airlock
activity. I've seen posts about diacetal(sp) rest temps, need I concern
myself? The Pilsen yeast produced a putrid sulphur smell in primary in both
beers, but the lager, IMHO, has turned into an excellent all grain beer.

David is correct in saying that carbonates will precipitate and that
sulphates will not.  I think this is the origin of temporary and
permanent hardness.  It is not correct to say "if your analysis
shows, for example, the bulk of your Ca as carbonate"  -- your analysis
simply shows concentrations of ions, not of salts.  The solubility of
Calcium Carbonate is quite low and if you boil your water and drive off
all the CO2, the carbonates will go and latch on to the magnesium and
calcium ions and whatever is over the solubility of the resulting CaCO3
and MgCO3 will fall out of solution.  The solubility of MgCO3 is quite
a bit higher than that of CaCO3, so if you have a lot of magnesium in
your water, you cannot remove as much CO3 (HCO3 or H2CO3) as you could
if you had low magnesium.


The solubility of Calcium Sulphate is also quite high, which is why you
can't precipitate out CaSO4.  Analysis will often say "as CO3" or, for
example, "acidity as lactic acid."  This does not neccessarily mean that
there is any lactic acid, but rather the acidity is "as if there were
X ppm of lactic acid in solution."


Also, boiling your water will not help if you don't have enough Ca to
form CaCO3.  In this case, you would have to add Ca (most will add it
as CaSO4, gypsum, but as I've said before, it's better to use Ca2Cl if
you can, unless you are making a Burton Ale) and then boil to precipitate
the CaCO3.


This much I think I have straight (correct me if I'm wrong) but the part
that I don't understand, despite having read that part of George Fix's
book at least ten times, is how the balance of the CO3 <-> HCO3 <-> H2CO3
works.  I know it has to do with the pH and that when the CO2 comes out
of solution during the boil (which means, effectively, that the carbonic
acid that *is* CO2 dissolved in water, turns to water) the pH of the water
rises.  What I'm missing is how the pH creates this balance of different
types of ions.  If someone could explain this, I think I could put all the
pieces of this puzzle together.  TIA.

Let's not forget that this is the Homebrew Digest and not the Law Digest.
Debating this issue should be done elsewhere.  I'd just like to point out
what, to me, appears to be the bottom line on this issue:


Ask yourself, "Is it 'right' to forfeit $15 and keep a $100+ keg?"


To heck with all the "well, it's used and beat up..." arguments, in the
end, I think that the answer for every honest person is "no."  Personally,
I despise what Miller and A-B and Coors have done to the average American
beer drinker's taste and would love to punish them for that, but stealing
from them is against my nature.  I plan to continue to "punish" them by
spending my commercial beer dollars on products from Sierra Nevada, Anchor,
Rogue, Moortgat, Cantillon, Goose Island, Kalamazoo, Fullers, Dominion,
Youngs... and by spreading the word about "good" beer.


This post has reminded me that I have a keg at home that I never returned
and planned, initially, to use for homebrewing.  Next time I'm going past
the store from which the keg was *borrowed*, I will return it.


If you need a keg, buy a legal one from BCI or SABCO.

Subject:  Yet another water question 


Fellow brewers,


While we are on the subject of water analysis/treatment I have a simple
question (sorry Lee! :-)). I have checked many books on the subject and
can't find the answer. Exactly what compounds go into the stuff
homebrew shops sell and simply call Burton Water Salts and, more
importantly, *what are the proportions of each*? I use deionized, reverse
osmosis, and everything-else-you-can-do-to-get-the-crud-out water and
am only concerned about putting things INTO my water and not worried
about taking them OUT.


Now that I think about it, I do have a pointer to give (redeeming myself,
Lee! :-)). If you have a receiving tube/hose on the spigot of whatever
kind of lauter tun you have, make sure the damn thing is secure. Mine
popped off yesterday and my lauter tun delivered about a pint of wort
onto the dining room carpet!


TIA and brew on my friends,

Either you didnt convert the malt carbohydrates very well, and/or you
had a poor lauter.  Depending on the type of malt and your water chemistry,
a rest in the 140s may help to ensure adequate maltose production prior
to the saccharification in the 150s.  Some stirring during these rests
can help, but I dont do a lot of this, but then I mash a lot more at a 
time.  If all of your past experience had acceptable yields, then certainly
the lauter process is the place to look.  25 minutes is a very, very fast 
lauter.  I would look to be sure you recirculate for reasonable clarity,
then aim for a 45-60 minute lauter.  Knife'ing the lauter bed may be 
in order too, this is what rakes do in the big tuns.  Basically, you
need to optimize the even flow of the sparge liquor through the tun,
avoiding any channeling that can occur. 


Kevin asks about Milwaukee water:


<I brew ales for the most part (everything from Weiss to Stout=),
<however, I will be brewing Lagers soon.  My beer is mainly extract with some
<grain added.


For extract brewing, forget about the water analysis, it wont matter that
much.  For lagers, I would try the water without any additions, the key
factor is calcium and at 96 ppm you've got plenty of that.  If you are 
starting to go all grain, try a simple ale first, it is a lot more forgiving.
