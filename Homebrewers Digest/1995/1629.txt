Actually, I changed my mind in the middle of this sentence and thus I 
hosed it up.  What I meant to say was:


>My understanding is also that carbonates have a very strong ability to
>prevent the lowering of the pH.


Regarding the harsh bitterness that Jim spoke about, I'm willing to concede
that excessive carbonates will help cause that.  My experience with high-
carbonate water has been strictly voluntary: having added chalk to several
dark recipes to imitate Dublin or London water.  The reason I said "Are you
sure, Jim?" was because I had read somewhere that the carbonates "smooth out"
beers and make them less harsh.  Perhaps the source I'm thinking of was
writing only about dark beers.  I also know that a lot of brewers with high-
carbonate water have overdone gypsum additions trying to get their pH down
which subsequently intensified their hop bitterness, although I'm not saying
that was necessarily the situation in your case, Jim.  I'm well aware of the
connection of dark grains and high-carbonate water -- look at Munich, Dublin
and London carbonate levels and consider that Dunkel, Stout and Porter came
to be associated with these towns, respectively.


Jim quotes Noonan:
>"It contributes a harsh, bitter flavor overwhelming in delicate lagers, and
>carbonate in excess of 200 ppm (which my water has - Jim) is tolerable only
>when a dark roasted malt is used to buffer its excessive acidity.
>Preferably, carbonate should be less than 50 ppm when pale malt or infusion
>mashing is used."


As you well know, no book is error-free and if indeed this is not a typo, 
it should have read: "only when a roasted malt is used to balance its
excessive alkalinity."  Also, I don't agree that infusion mashing does not
lend itself to high-carbonate water -- surely London's Porter and Dublin's
Stout are infusion mashed.

If they will be consumed withing 1 month, I'd say no problem.  Those
bottles are not oxygen-barrier and despite the high pressure of CO2
inside, O2 will still permiate in oxidizing the alcohols and creating
unpleasant aldehydes.

     after 18 days in the jug, and a sniff test shows some peculiar 
     "fruity" smell in both. It'll be a while before I can do serious taste 


Your experiment would have fairer to the yeasts if it had been done at ale
temperatures.  I don't know if the YeastLab American is the same as the
Wyeast American Ale, but I know that the Wyeast version is very unhappy
below 63F or so.  It tends to slow down and flocculate too early.  Finally,
I belive that you should judge the beer on its final flavour and not
necessarily on how fast it works.  Also, don't criticize ale yeasts for
making fruity aromas -- it's their life's work!


On how to achieve ale temperatures, I had the same problem.  My fermentation
room was far too cold.  "Damn," I said, "my fermentation room is 60F and the
furnace room next door is 75F!"  Then I noticed a wooden "door" about 1-foot-
square in the wall between the rooms.  I slid the door open, but a small fan
in the "doorway" and the temperature in the fermentation room rose to 65F.
When it's very cold outside, the furnace runs more and subsequently the
fermentation room gets more of the heat it then needs.  If you don't have
this option, you may want to consider something called, I believe, a "Brew
Belt."  It slips around your carboy or pail and heats it up to something like
70F.

Subject: Lager! Is it? Do you have to Lager?




  Can I start by saying that I appreciate all the response to 
"Microwave", but lets talk about Lager.


  I have not used Lager yeast yet because I do not have a fridge
to lager with. I have read that Lager yeast is acceptable to use
at room temperatures, and that the flavor of the beer will be
different. What I mean is (same ingredients Ale vs Lager yeast)


  My question is this, if I do not lager the beer can it truly be
called a Lager? Example, don't call wheat beer a Weizen if your
only using one pound of wheat malt. Follow tradition.

Subject: carbonates and hardness


in HBD # 1627, Al Korzonas asks:




>> [...] the part that I don't understand, despite having read that part
of George Fix's book at least ten times, is how the balance of the CO3 <->
HCO3 <-> H2CO3 works.  I know it has to do with the pH and that when the
CO2 comes out of solution during the boil (which means, effectively, that
the carbonic acid that *is* CO2 dissolved in water, turns to water) the pH
of the water rises.  What I'm missing is how the pH creates this balance
of different types of ions.  If someone could explain this, I think I
could put all the pieces of this puzzle together. <<


I think that the problem arose from the confusion between carbonates and 
bicarbonates. As was mentionned before, _hardness_ results from the 
amount of Ca and Mg ions that are present in solution at any given time. 


Let us concentrate on the fate of calcium, as magnesium is typically much 
less important, and anyway its salts are more soluble.


In normal tap/spring water, calcium and carbonic acid are present as the 
Ca++ cation, the CO3-- carbonate anion, the HCO3- bicarbonate anion, 
H2CO3 (carbonic acid), and dissolved CO2. This whole mixture forms a 
complicated equilibrium, that is described depending on the pH as being 
"calcium bicarbonate" or "calcium carbonate".


Now, calcium bicarbonate is fairly soluble, while calcium carbonate 
isn't. Let us examine the various pH ranges:


Acidic: the CO2 is present as H2CO3 and CO2, both of which are driven off
by heating (H2CO3 = CO2 + H2O). The calcium stays in solution. Permanent 
hardness, which may be very high.


Very alkaline: The CO2 is entirely as CO3--, which means that all the Ca++
is already in the form of calcium carbonate. Since calcium carbonate is
rather insoluble, there is very little dissolved calcium to start with,
but whatever is there stays there. Permanent, but low hardness.


Moderately alkaline: The CO2 is mostly as HCO3-, and therefore there may
be high concentrations of dissolved calcium (soluble calcium bicarbonate).
Heating such a solution causes the dissolved CO2 to be driven off (gases
become less soluble as temperature increases), causing displacement of the
equilibrium between bicarbonate and CO2: 


2 HCO3- --> CO2 + CO3-- + H2O


Continued heating drives the equilibrium all the way, such that half of
the original HCO3- becomes CO3-- and half becomes CO2 (driven off by the
boiling). Since we are left with carbonate where we once had bicarbonate,
calcium will precipitate as CaCO3. Thus (possibly high) temporary hardness
turns to low permanent hardness. 


This phenomenon, incidentally, is what accounts for the formation of
stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves. Rain water (high in
dissolved CO2) percolates through limestone (CaCO3) and dissolves some of
the calcium carbonate as calcium bicarbonate: 


CO2 + H2O + CaCO3 --> Ca(HCO3)2


In the cave, CO2 is lost by exchange with the air and some water 
evaporates, and a minute amount of the Ca is deposited as CaCO3. A few 
millenia later, voila`.

Subject: Ronald's yeast experiment


Ronald Dwelle posted the results of a yeast comparaison experiment in
HBD 1627.


First off: Well done! From what you posted, it sounds like you performed
a simple, to the point controlled experiment. Yeast performance is important
to me (and many others I would assume), because at $5.50 (CDN) + tax each,
I don't want to be doing alot of trial and error work. I really appreciate
it when people post how various yeasts perform, and a now you've done a
nice bit of research that gives even clearer evidence of differences between
various strains. ie.without many of the ambiguities involved in comparing
different beers fermented for different lengths of time, at different
temperatures, by different brewers, etc...


Second off (and the main reason for my taking up BW): Please be sure to post
how they all turn out! F.G., taste, etc.
I look forward to hearing more

Howdy All,
        I was wondering if there is anyone out there in Minnesota around the 
Twin Cities area that is into all grain brewing.  I am interested in making 
the move to all grain and would like to see a setup before I build one myself.  
        I am considering either a bru-heat (sp?) or a propane kooker and keg 
set-up.  Anyone around here have either?  I have read all the FAQ's and 
posts and I think I know what to do but I would like to see one in person first.
        TIA for anyone who can help me out!!!

From: John Glaser <glaser`at`widlar.ece.arizona.edu>
Subject: Kegging questions and misc.


OK, I've broken down, and I have several questions about kegging in  
soda kegs. I don't expect answers to them all, and yes, I have read  
the FAQ. It helped me get started, but I sure would like some more  
info. If I get enough answers, I'll try to get it added to the FAQ,  
or release it in some form or other. I mostly would like to stimulate  
some discussion. Nearly all of my questions have to do with  
carbonation, pressures, line lengths, tubing diameters, and so on.  
Exciting stuff, I know!


1) Beer line length:
Or, to put it another way, how much pressure drop should there be  
across the beer line? Should it be about equal to the dispensing  
pressure, or should the pressure drop be minimal? Throw out your  
theories, please! Good related info would concern pressure drops for  
various line lengths i.e. 0.25lbs/ft for 3/8" line, 0.85lbs/ft. for  
1/4" line. What about 3/16" line?


2) Dispensing pressure vs. storage/carbonating pressure:
Do you dispense beer at the same pressure that you store and/or  
carbonate it? I know this depends on beer line length, diameter,  
temperature, etc. Obviously, it would be most convenient to use the  
same pressure for both, so you don't have to bleed the pressure,  
adjust the regulator, etc., every time you want to draw a few beers.


3) Beer serving temperature:
Do you really store and serve your ales at 55F? I tried this and  
according to the CO2 volumes vs. temp chart, I needed nearly 20lbs.  
(I don't recall exactly, but it was close).


What I have now: This is my first kegged batch, and I finally got it  
to give me glasses of beer. I use about 15lbs. of CO2 for storage and  
dispensing of a standard American ale stored at 45F. I have the  
spigot on a convenient bracket thathooks at the top of the keg. I use  
6' of 3/16" I.D. beer line. It seems to work OK.


What I started with: 4' of 1/4" beer line, pressure of 20 lbs., 55F  
storage temp. I got foam and no beer. I tried reducing dispensing  
pressure (no, I didn't forget to bleed the pressure), nothing worked. 




On another note:


Don't give up the search for cheap brewing equipment. If you are  
willing to scrounge, and have little shame about asking, you'd be  
amazed at what you can get. Most of my equipment I got free for the  
asking, hauling away, and cleaning (OK, so cleaning sucks, and time =  
$$$, blah, blah, blah). If you search long enough, you may find what  
you need. For instance, I just got a 15 gallon Vollrath Stainless pot  
with lid and aluminum clad bottom for trading an old Brother word  
processor plus $30 at a local junkshop (Asking price was $60). Don't  
overlook flea markets and swap meets. I've seen $10 Corona mills, $10  
antique functional bench cappers, scales, balances, thermostats,  
heating elements, king kookers, and much, much more.

In #1620 (I'm still catching up) Phil Miller asks: 


"Also, when is the best time to add ascorbic acid to a brew?"


At the risk of being flippant - NEVER!


Some people, myself included, have vitamin C tolerance problems (it
literally tears up my guts causing bleeding).  I don't know how much you
are contemplating using, but if you are attempting to prevent or reverse
oxidation then it will probably be quite a bit, and at the very least
people should be warned about the vitamin C content of your beer.  It is
not uncommon for someone to drink 6-8 pints over the course of an
afternoon or evening.  At the rate of 2g/gallon I could ingest over 1g
(1000mg) of vitamin C about 4 times what it takes to cause me problems. 


Anyway, it's something to consider. 


Also, ascobic acid is pretty bitter and can be tasted at some level. 
Lastly, good procedure should obviate the need for an antioxidant.

Subject: Keg Crimes -- to be or not to be?


When this thread was in bloom last summer, I received literally
dozens of e-mail messages from HBD'rs expressing interest in the
topic, and generally indicating that the thread was worthwhile and
germane to the HBD.  Since posting my recent reply to Miller
Brewing's rather tardy coda, I've received more expressions of
interest and interesting antecdotes on the subject, which I had
intended to summarize and post in a manner to minimize bandwidth
use (and repetition).  


However, in HBD #1627 we read Mr. Demers' crafted expression of
wonderfully inciteful prose: 


>Please, lets not resurrect this keg crimes thread.  It was already
>beaten to death by all of the lawyer wannabe types already.  Take it
>to alt.useless.legal.debates. Were here to talk about BREWING BEER!
>Thank you.    
                            
and Mr. Korzonas admonition that we should:
                            
>. . . not forget that this is the Homebrew Digest and not the Law
>Digest. Debating this issue should be done elsewhere.


I (and it seems many others as well) believe this issue is very
relevant to the HBD, both for homebrewers and actual or aspiring
craft brewers.  Indeed, many HBD readers have written me to express
their thanks for bringing some legal expertise to the discussion (I
guess a few folks think my license to practice makes me a bit more
than a "lawyer wannabe type"), much in the same way as I have
thanked specialists such as John Palmer for his expert thoughts on
stainless steel (another "nonbrewing" topic that seems to be well
accepted here). 


However, if the HBD readers are tired of the thread, so be it.


If you want to see more on the subject, let me know *by e-mail* at
lkbonham`at`beerlaw.win.net.  If you're so opposed to seeing more
that you just have to say something, feel free to let me know,
preferably by e-mail. If there's a sufficient favorable response,
I'll continue the thread; if not, consider it ended.

Subject: Moving Carboys / Yeast Starters


Hi HBDer's


     I'd like to pose a few questions to the collective wisdom
out there.


     My brewing buddy and I have been brewing double batches and
sometimes we don't finish until 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.  We pitch when
the temperature is right.  The carboys will set by the front door
until later that day and then they get moved to a 62 degree frig. 
The brew may sit for 10 to 12 hours.  When it is time to move
them to the frig., there is a 1/2 to 1 inch of kraeusen.  At this
point is it a bad idea to move the carboys?  They are agitated
pretty well as I carry them down the stairs as well as with the
car ride to the frig.--it stirs up the break material on the
bottom.  When does agitation become detrimental? 


Yeast Starters:
When bottling wort for starters, is it important not to aerate
it?  Should I leave no head space in the bottle?  After bottling the wort, 
should I store the bottles at 62 F or should the temp be lower?  I am 
considering buying a yeast starter kit from Brewers Resource.  Anyone out 
there with experience with these kits?  Would it be a good idea to buy the 
simple kit for $16.00 or buy the $50.00 kit with the extras?


Any responses here or private are appreciated.
TIA

 When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it  reacts with water to form carbonic 
acid. Carbonic acid quickly dissociates to form bicarbonate, which itself 
dissociates to form carbonate.
                  H20        (bicarb)            (Carbonate)
CO2 <---> H2CO3 <-----> H+ and HCO3- <-----> H+ and CO3--
                  pK=6.4             pK=10.4




Each of these species is in an equilibrium with one another that depends on the 
pH of the solution. That is to say the the relative amounts of each species 
depends on the pH. The reason why pH affects the relative amounts of each is 
because carbonic acid and bicarbonate are weak acids, that is only a portion of 
them will  lose an H+. The concentration of H+ in solution determines the amount
of molecules that dissociate. If there is lots of H+ in solution (low pH) then 
there will be almost no dissociation of bicarbonate to form carbonate, and a 
little dissociation of carbonic acid to form bicarbonate. At pH 6.4 the 
inorganic carbon in solution is exactly half bicarbonate and half carbonic 
acid/CO2 with essentially no carbonate. pH 6.4 is called the pK of carbonic 
acid, because it is the point where half the molecules have dissociated. At pH 
10.4 (the pK of bicarbonate) there is half bicarbonate and half carbonate ions 
with essentially no free CO2/carbonic acid.
   A good way to figure this out is to look again at the reaction above. If 
there is lots of carbonate and  bicarbonate around, (say pH =10.4), and you add 
acid (H+) to the  solution, the equation will go backwards in that you will form
bicarbonate, and then carbonic acid. If you added enough acid to get to pH = 6.4
the the solution will come to a new equilibrium with half carbonic acid and half
bicarbonate. Keep adding acid and there will be only carbonic acid/CO2.
     One point to remember is that the pH determines the relative amounts of 
bicarbonate and carbonate in solution, not the absolute amount. Thus two water 
supplies can have the same pH, but the one with higher bicarbonate will have 
higher alkalinity, and be more troublesome to mash with pale malt.

Subject: Mexicali Rogue


Since there seems to be quite a few folks delurking these days I thought I
might join the masses with this post.  


I want to attempt to brew something in the style of Rogue's Mexicali Rogue
Ale.  According to the blurb on the side of the bottle they use chipolte
(smoked jalapeno) peppers to give it it's smokey character.  I was planning
on using a pale ale as the base but I'm not sure how to proceed with the
chipolte.  


So my question is how much chipolte to use and should I:  
a.)  Add to the mash (or specialty grain steep).  
b.)  Add to the boil and if so how long.  
c.)  Make a chipolte tea... Mmmm
d.)  Dry hop (or dry pepper in this case).  


Any information or comments will be appreciated.
Thanks,

Sassafras grows wild in Maryland, so I've made simple teas from it all my 
life. You use the bark from the root. Scrub the roots well, nip off any 
rootlets, then shave the bark from the roots with a knife. These shavings 
go into the pot near the end of the boil (about 5 minutes). You can discard 
the rootlets and wood.


One of my early brewing experiments was with sassafras. I think I used the 
bark from about 5 roots, 4 to 6 inches long each. I didn't know about 
tannins at the time, so I boiled it about 15 minutes. The sassafras (root
beer) flavor came through, but so did the wood. I dumped out about half,
then had a change of heart and saved about 18 bottles. With time the wood
flavor subsided and a rather interesting beer emerged. Limiting your boil
to 5 minutes should avoid drawing the tannins out of the wood, so you wont 
have to wait!


The only other advice I can give is the standard for herb/spice beers: 
start with light malt and noble hops, then adjust to taste in your next 
batch. Maybe you should try one gallon batches. BTW, you can leave any 
unused roots in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator). Sassafras keeps
for several months. Of course, the sooner you use it, the better it will be.


Good luck,
     Rob

I purchased a Cole Pharmer (actually, I believe it is Cole Palmer) for around

store it properly. It comes in a heavy duty carrying case that includes vials

I got it on a special deal through work, but I know where you can get one for

Subject: Capping and Stoppering Champagne Bottles


I also have run across problems capping champagne bottles.  As previously 
stated by many, champagne bottles are quite variable, some work perfectly 
with a normal capper and most do not.


I purchased a "Super Colonna" Vertical Capping Machine (apparently made 
in Italy, possibly by Brev?).  It is a rugged, mainly plastic contraption 
which has worked well for over a year (I went through one of the std two 
lever cappers in about a year).  On the box is some interesting information:
"The capper is supplied with tongs for 28mm crown caps. At request (extra 
$) tongs for 30mm crown caps (Champagne bottle type) can also be supplied."
 
I have called a bunch of homebrew supply stores and one distributor but 
no one seems to carry the larger "tongs" (crimper).  One place said that 
they probably could order it and 30mm caps, but I would have to get caps 
by the case (probably close to a lifetime supply!).  Does anyone know 
where I could get the larger crimper (tongs) and a reasonably small 
number of 30mm caps. (private email fine)
 
Since I didn't manage to solve this supplier issue myself, I went to a 
store that also sells wine supplies.  They suggested using plastic 
champagne "corks" and metal cages.  I have used these on 5-10 bottles now 
without a problem.  The "corks" and cages are reusable if your careful 
and they were pretty cheap (5-10 cents apiece).

From: Bob Paolino               Research Analyst
Subject: Bottle "crimes" ....a request from a regional


Back when I got started, I built up a bottle collection by buying cases of
returnables for the $1.20 deposit per case. Lots of us probably
have done/still do that. Of course, I'm in one of those uncivilised states
that doesn't have a bottle deposit law, so empty bottles from fine micros
(except the ones that come in those damn screw-offs) get their labels soaked
off and I refill what the commercial guys don't. Competitions are also a good
source for empties. If you're attending a competition and you need bottles,
PLEASE don't hesitate to ask the organiser during a less busy period after the
show. Trust me, s/he'll be happy for you to take the empties (and probably some
of the extra full ones, too) away.  I imagine that a friendly neighbourhood
pubkeeper would also (in non-deposit states) be happy to have you cart a couple
cases of empties away every now and then.


In short, there are plenty of ways for a homebrewer to get empties.


I wouldn't call keeping (or buying) deposit bottles a crime, but one of the
local regional breweries, Huber (Monroe, WI), has asked that we pass the word
that we encourage our members NOT to use cases of empty Huber bottles for
homebrewing.  It seems that they're getting a fairly low return rate, such
that it's beginning to become a problem for them.


I should note for those of you outside this area that Huber bottles are very
popular among homebrewers because the labels just beg to float off the bottles
after a rather brief soak in hot water.  They should get credit for using more
"environmentally friendly" paper labels (rather than foil on paper) and water
soluble glues (which probably makes the "de-labelling" part of their washing
process simpler as well), but it's also made the bottles, it seems, all too
popular among homebrewers.


But whether you're in WI/MN/IL/IA or elsewhere, you should keep in mind the
well-bring of your small regional brewers, even the ones that aren't "micros."


Now go have a beer,

I'm not interested in legalities, just what seems right or wrong.
I buy Upper Canada beer because it's good beer, but more importantly
because i like their dark brown pry top bottles. I would feel bad
if I thought I were ripping them off. So I asked the tour guide at 
their brewery, and they said that the bottles cost them less than
the 10 cent deposit. But he insisted that keeping the bottles cost
them money, because their stock of bottles was getting low so they'd
have to buy some more. This makes no sense.


This is a BREWING digest, and bottles are a part of brewing (or kegs).
I don't care about some stupid law that isn't enforced, I do care about
what is right or wrong. Can anyone tell me why buying their bottles 
for more than they're worth might cost them money?

From: k-jones`at`ee.utah.edu (Kelly Jones)
Subject: low alcohol brews


I thought I would try to shed some light on techniques for making low
alcohol beers, speaking from a knowledge of the physics behind it, rather
than from practical experience. I am using the term "low alcohol" as a
substitute for "non-alcoholic", as we all know "non-alcoholic" beers
contain up to  0.5% alcohol.


The real crux of the issue is determining what needs to be done to assure
that a certain amount of alcohol has been removed.  Let me begin by
explaining some of the physics of distillation.


When an alcohol-water mixture is heated (and even when it is not) a vapor
will exist above the liquid phase of the mixture. Because alcohol is more
volatile, as we all know, this vapor will contain a higher proportion of
alcohol than that which is present in the liquid phase.  That is to say, if
the liquid phase is 5% EtOH, the vapor present above the liquid will be
perhaps 37% EtOH.  If this vapor is removed, we have thus reduced the
concentration of EtOH in the liquid.  This is the basis of distillation.
If the temperature is increased high enough, the liquid mixture will begin
to boil.  While it will boil at a lower temperature than pure water
(roughly 95C for a 5% abw mixture), this phase relationship will still
hold:  The vapor boiling off will be a mixture of both alcohol and water.
In fact, more water (63%) than alcohol (37%) is being removed!


Hopefully, this information dispels some misconceptions:  First, the
alcohol does not selectively boil off when the solution reaches the boiling
point of alcohol (about 78C).  At any temperature, including temperatures
below the boiling point, both water and alcohol are being evaporated.
There is no "magic temperature" at which the alcohol will be removed.
Finally, there is no "magic time" at which one can assume that the alcohol
is gone:  How long it takes to remove a given volume of alcohol is
dependent upon the net rate of vapor removal, which is in turn dependent
upon temperature, rate of heat input, evaporator geometry, etc.


In order to produce a low-alcohol beer, one has to evaporate away enough of
the high-concentration EtOH vapor to result in a mixture that is
substantially lower in alcohol. In other words, what we are looking for is
a net volume loss. I believe this explains some of the enigmatic data which
were presented at various times by Jack Schmidling, Maribeth Raines, and
Bruce DeBolt.


If one knew the exact relationship between the EtOH concentration in beer
versus the EtOH concentration in the vapor phase, one could predict exactly
how much volume loss would be required to reduce a beer of any initial
alcohol concentration to some lower value, say 0.5% (the normal definition
of non-alcoholic beer).  I do not posess this data for beer, although I
have seen figures for simple alcohol-water mixtures.  Using this data, I
have derived formulas which indicate that, for most mixtures that start out
with 3% - 7% abw, reduction to 0.5% alcohol is achieved when 20 - 25% of
the mixture is removed.  To create a non-alcoholic beer from 5 gal of 5%
beer,  one should boil it down to 4 gallons, then top up with water to get
back to 5 gal.    Note that the temperature is not important, you could
achieve this evaporation at virtually any temperature; obviously though, it
will happen much faster if boiling is achieved.  Of course, this may have
deleterious organoleptic consequences.  As other posters have explained,
carbonation could be achieved by force carbonating, or by adding fresh
yeast and the normal amount of priming sugar.


BTW, the concept of an azeotrope has nothing to do with this issue.  The
EtOH-water azeotrope is formed at _high_ EtOH concentration, like 96% EtOH.
This comes into play if you are trying to remove _water_ from _alcohol_, to
form pure EtOH. We are working at the opposite end of the spectrum.


BTW, does anyone know whether the 0.5% "definintion" of non-alcoholic is
abw or abv?


Hope this helps a little,
