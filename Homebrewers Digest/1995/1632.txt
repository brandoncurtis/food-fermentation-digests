Subject: Decoction mashing


Jim asks about decoction mashing and its relevance to soft
Pilzen water.  One of the often overlooked properties of
malt carbohydrates (starch) is that it is composed of trace
elements of Calcium, magnesium and silica.  Decoction mashing
helps to explode any leftover starches, liberating these
trace elements.  Decoction mashing also tends to increase the
phosphate levels.  Pilzen brewers additionally employ long
low temperature rests that favor natural acidulation of the
mash, through the reactions of calcium and phosphates from
the malt and enzymatic activity of phytase.  Calcium reactions
with proteins also help to force the pH down.  Decoction
mashing also coagulates proteins during the boil of the mash.
 
Lee writes:


<In another post someone posted about why decoction mash and what effects it 
<has on a brew.
<As a regular user of this technique, even in ales,  let me comment:


Im sure Lee understands the tradeoffs involved in mashing and
malt choices, but I wanted to point out that if ales are being
made using English (or DeWolf) pale ale malt ,a decoction mash is 
the last thing one wants to do.  Pale ale malts have already been
proteolytically reduced and the equivelent of a maltose rest
has already been performed by the malting process, the
last thing one wants to do is further the protein reduction
via decoction mashing.  That said, I like to make some ales
using Pils and Munich malt, but for this I opt for a 60C dough
in/protein rest/brief maltose rest followed by saccharification
at 66C and a mash off at 77C.  The resulting beer has a greater
apparent degree of attenuation (ADA) than Pale ale malt mashed
at 66C, and tastes fuller to me.  This is with recent versions
of the DeWolf Cosyns malts.


I was chattin with some of my pro brewer friends the other day
about partial decoction mashes.  In this method, the main mash
of pale/pils malts is performed separate from the specialties until
conversion is complete.  Concurrently, a small decoction mash is
done with say 50-100 Lbs of base malt and 50-100 Lbs of specialties,
usually Munich and caramel malts.  The mashes are combined and lautered
as usual.  Im curious about applying this technique in our smaller
breweries and am wondering if anyone has any results to share. For me,
it doesnt make much sense since I make ales, and I only decoct weizens,
and this obviously would not apply to that.  I would think this is
something for lager homebrewers to try, it would combine the advantages
of a decoction mash, but make the volumes much easier to handle and
the time required would be shortened from standard decoctions.  It would
also increase the melanoiden concentrations competely separate from the
main base malt choices.

From: John Glaser <glaser`at`widlar.ece.arizona.edu>
Subject: KEG beer line length answers


     OK, I got my replies, so here's how to do it (but only if you  
like convenience and minimal work). Several people sent me replies  
about my kegging beer line questions.


     You can indeed dispense and carbonate at the same pressure. This  
is the way to go, since you don't have to bleed pressure and mess  
with the regulator every time you want some beer out of your keg. To  
do so, read on.


For kegger's who don't like theory:


     In short, in order to get minimal foaming at the tap, you want  
to have a pressure drop across the beer line and tap that equals the  
pressure at the keg. I have gleaned the following approximate  
pressure drop figures for immediate use:


3/8" I.D. hose           0.25 psi/ft.
1/4" I.D. hose           0.85 psi/ft.
3/16" I.D. hose          2.2 to 3 psi/ft.
standard spigot          1-2 psi
check valve              2 psi (CO2 side only)
vertical rise            1 psi/ft. (avg. measured from keg center)


     So, let's say we have our beer carbonated at 15 psi, and now  
wish to serve it at the same pressure. If you have a CO2 check valve,  
you will have to set theregulator about 2 psi higher to account for  
the drop across the check valve (so I've been told). Then the  
pressure at the keg will be 15 psi. 


     Let the tap height be at about the center of the keg, so we  
don't have to worry about the vertical rise. Subtract 2 psi for the  
spigot, leaving 13 psi to drop across the beer line. If we use 3/16"  
beer line, and assume 2.2 psi/ft. pressure drop, then 13psi /  
2.2psi/ft. = 5.9 ft., so use 6ft. of 3/16" line. If you do this, you  
can keep the beer at 15 psi while tapping with minimal foaming.
     If your spigot is mounted above the keg beer, you get an  
additional 1lb./ft. drop due to gravity for each foot above the beer  
level, so you can shorten your hose accordingly (I wouldn't worry  
about this unless your tap is a couple of feet above the keg height,  
since the beer level in the keg will change anyway.).


        If you really want simple, figure about 1 ft. of 3/16" beer  
line per 3 lbs. pressure (as stated in the kegging FAQ).


        If you *foolishly insist* on using 1/4" line, it would take  
about 13/0.85 = 15.3 ft. for the same result.


HINT: to fit 3/16" line on 1/4" hose barbs, stick the end of the tube  
in boiling water to soften it up first.


For those who like a little theory:


     The actual pressure drops in the beer line, spigot, etc. depend  
on the fluid (beer) velocity, with the pressure drops increasing as  
velocity increases. I suspect this is probably nearly-linear for slow  
flow rates with minimal fluid turbulence, and you don't want a lot of  
turbulence unless you like foam more than beer (feel free to call me  
on this if I'm wrong). Hence, the above pressures are valid at a  
specific flow rate. I was given a rate of about 0.5 to 1 oz./sec. for  
the pressure drop quoted for 3/16" line, and assume the other figures  
are probably for a similar flow rate.
     In fact, no matter what kind of line you use, nearly all the keg  
pressure must appear across the beer line and spigot, since the tap  
opens to the atmosphere. With too-short and/or too-wide lines, the  
total resistance to fluid flow becomes too small and the beer  
velocity increases, causing additional turbulence in the line and at  
the tap, which in turn causes the sudden release of CO2 in the form  
of foam (the latter is conjecture on my part).
     The flow rate of 0.5 to 1 oz./sec is probably a good compromise  
between too much foam and waiting forever to get a glass of beer.


     Sorry about the long post, I'm just practicing for my  
dissertation (which sadly has nothing to do with beer :( ). Thanks to  
all those who sent me info. Also, thanks to the people at the  
Beverage Company. When I placed my order, they told me to get the  
3/16" line, although they didn't have any explanation other than they  
thought it would work better. Well, I got it, and you know the rest.  
(no affiliation, blah, blah, blah).

Subject:       PET Bottles


Someone asked for hard evidence of the permeability of PET bottles.


I attended a conference and one of the invited speakers was from a 
company which had developed a process to apply a thin(nano-meter)
glass coating to a plastic surface.  The surfaces of interest were:


1) plastic food wrap
2) PET bottles


The purpose of the coating was to reduce gas transfer.  He mentioned 
that the shelf life of pop in a PET is limited(sorry, I can't recall 
the time), but that by coating the bottles it was significantly extended.
Coating the food wrap was also done to extend the shelf life of 
products.


I have used PET's myself and was pleased with them.  I did find that 
I had to add a bit more priming sugar than I do in glass to 
compensate for the volume increase of the container.


I now use glass - primarily for aesthetic reasons.  I do find that 
filling one PET allows me to monitor the bottle conditioning quite 
nicely however.

Subject: ESB comparisons/Licorice/Oatmeal Stout/Foam/Mulch!


>From HBD 1630:
"Evil Scientist" Michael Lloyd purports that after refining his
Trolleyman ESB, it "cannot be told from Redhook ESB ib a blind taste
test".  Although I do not question the quality of the beer, I would
argue on scientific grounds that statement is non-attainable. 
Presumably, Michael has experimentally failed to reject the null 
hypothesis of no difference (in taste between his Trolleyman and RH) in
controlled blind tastings; hence his statement should read: "...has not
been told from ...".  A minor semantic and or epistomoligical issue, but
any (even an evil one) scientist recognizes that experiments never prove
anything, they only can only give inference.
******
Tim Lawson inquires about using Licorice in Stouts.  I have used brewers
licorice (comes in a stick) in a Russian Stout once.  I used 1/2 half
stick, and the flavor was subtle, but nicely perceptable.  Be warned, I
believe that this stuff is manufactured from licorice root and not
anise, and consequently has a distinctive (not totally licorice-y)
flavor.  I would suspect that a similar dose used in a lower gravity
beer (mine was around 1090) would yield significantly greater
perceptability -- hence proceed with caution.
*********
Glen Wagnecz gives a detailed recipe for his Sand Pit Speacial Oatmeal
Stout.  One thing struck me though: Hop bittering is stated to come from
solely  one addition of 14 grams of Nugget at 13% alpha, for a 15 gallon
batch.  Even assuming excellent utilization rates, that would only yield
about 10-12 IBU -- i.e., barely at the threshold of perception.  Is this
correct, and if so, is the beer very low in bitterness on purpose?  I
know that Oatmeal stouts can tend to be sweet, but this seems way out of
range.
Comments, Glen? Anyone?
*********
Following up on the now lost FOOP thread, I was surprised that no one
made mention of the effect that dispensing practice has on foam
*production*.  Having been an admirerer and consumer of good foam for
many years, and having attempted many efforts at duplicating a draft
Guinness type of beer, I was struck by how the Guinness tap mechanism
worked.  Upon investigation, I discovered that in addition to pushing the
beer with a high Nitrogen composition gas (usually 70%N2 and 30%CO2),
the beer exits out a small disk called a sparkler.  Now, this disk
simply has 5 very small holes in it, thus causing the beer to be forced
or "spritzed" through these holes, initiating considerable foaming. 
Forgetting momentarily that the high N content is much closer to the
partial pressure of the gasses in the atmosphere, I though, why not
simply "spritz" from the soda keg.  Turns out, in lieu of a
Guinness/Nitrogen setup, it works great.  All you have to do is put
sufficient top pressure on the keg to allow the beer to froth out when
*barely* squeezing the tap. I have found that 14-18 psi works real well,
and when done right should make a dramatic ssssssssssssss-sound.  If you
do not want to add additional carbonation to the beer, be sure to bleed
off the pressure after dispensing.  You may have to tweak with the
pressure and dispensing routine to match your desires, but if you are
having trouble getting acceptable foam from your keg beer, give it a
try.  I employed this method for years to good avail, but have since
aquired a Nitrogen can and Guinness tap for the real thing.  Now I'm
working on refining the (draft dry stout) recipe.   
 *********
Finally, one reminder to all you home hopgrowers out there: Mulch!  They
simply love it, both for thermal protection and nutrient flux.  If you
use a high carbon source of mulch, like straw, remember to give a good
dose of fertilizer -- you want to keep the C:N ratio relatively low,
particulrly during the first three months after emergence.  I go with
reccommended dosing of organic chickewn manure in late Feb., early
April, and Late May, then dose with bone meal (phosphorus) at the
intitiation of flowering.
The mulch does many thing for the soil environment, including regulate
nutrient availability, hold moisture, promote good infiltration, and
provide a medium for new rhizome development and vegetal cloning (i.e.,
rhizome thinning).  Heres to the '95 harvest!

Richard, your on the right track. I have a modified program. Place the beer
in a 5 gallon cornelius place that outside. After a few hours shake the keg.
If it sounds like ice crystals forming just rack under CO2 to another
cornelius. Do it until you get about 1/5 the volume removed in the form of
ice.


If you take a SG reading you will probably see very little change. Your
increasing the dextrine per volume while increasing the alcohol. Thus the
gravity will read close to the same. For the % alcohol you'll  have to
calculate what the original gravity would have been if it had whatever
volume of water you removed.


I've had fun with eisbocks, hope you will also.

Tim Lawsen asked about using licorice in a stout. I just used a stick of
brewers licorice in a extract porter. Following instructions from one of
the beer books I own (can't remember which) it said "Just throw the
licorice into the boiling wort." Well, this didn't work. The brewers
licorice did not dissolve at all. No licorice taste at all!


I brew on an electric stove, so maybe one of the jet burners will
actually dissolve the stuff.


Sorry I can't help on how to do it right, but at least don't try what I
did! Next time I think I'll try grinding up the licorice first.

I am sort of new at homebrewing and I am already tired of bottles
but don't want to commit to tapping a keg when I sample a batch.
I recently saw a mini-keg system at the local brew store that

Has anyone heard of or use such a thing?  It seems like a pretty

Dear Jim,  We AOLers are getting a bad reputation for quickly looking at an

found elsewhere, but not in this newsgroup.  I think I saw something called a

In HB1630, <CGPCS07.WING`at`WING.SAFB.AF.MIL> James Linscheid asked about 
culturing wild yeast.


Last year I cultured yeast off of locally made spontaneously 
fermenting cider. I just plated it out and took one of the small 
circular colonies that looked like yeast. I grew it in 10cc 
1030 wort and plated it again to make sure it was yeast. I grew 10cc 
again and stepped up to 500cc. This went into a 1050 wheat beer to 
make a lambic. It tasted "lambicy" even before adding brettanomyces 
and pediococcus.


It was fruity, slightly cidery, and very attenuative. As a gueuze it 
scored 38-42 in local competitions. Most judges thought it was too 
dry, though.


It was interesting, but I would use a Belgian wit yeast next time. 
They have similar flavor characteristics, but don't attenutate so 
much.


If you are going to culture wild yeast, use what you find on fruit, 
not old socks.

Hello all (from "Don" Put):


Thanks for bringing this up, Spencer.  It just so happens that I stumbled 
across something pertaining to this in the De Clerck book and it's been 
on my mind ever since.  In describing the differences between lager (bottom 
dwelling) and ale (top dwelling) yeast strains, he makes the following 
statement:


        "Difference in temperature is not, however, really a distinctive
        characteristic between the two systems because top yeasts can be
        acclimatized to the low temperature of bottom fermenting brewing."


Now, I'm sure there are some low temperature tolerant ale strains out there,
but I'm not sure that they are included in the pure yeast strains 
available to the homebrewer (from Wyeast, Brewtek, etc.).  Has anybody had
any experience with acclimatizing an ale yeast strain to ferment at a lower 
temperature?  It seems that it could be done if the temperature was lowered
gradually over the course of several successive starters.  Perhaps one of
our resident microbiological experts could comment (Maribeth Raines, are 
you out there?).  I realize that we could just use one of the higher 
temperature lager strains available, but I think it would be an interesting 
experiment because ale strains would still give a different flavor profile.

Sorry, John, but I have to disagree.  A chipotle (pronounced she-POAT-lay)
is a smoked, dried jalapeno pepper.  They are traditionally dried in 
this manner because they are too fleshy to air dry - they just rot.  (See
DeWitt, David and Nancy Gerlack, The Whole Chile Pepper Book, Little,
Brown (Boston, 1990), pp. 25, 55).  Thinner walled chiles such as cayennes
or serranos will air dry nicely.  They are a great addition to meatless
dishes such as beans and rice.

Joe, even though there is plenty of pressure in the bottle, the

oxygen, the bottle is in a vacuum because there is no O2 in there.  
Osmotic pressures force O2 into the bottle untill the pressures are

Subject: HSA with Vienna and Munich malts - correction and summary


(From *Jeff* Renner)


I recently posted that two dunkels made from 90+% Munich malt and a 
Vienna made with a similar amount of Vienna malt had all "crashed and 
burned," i.e., over a period of 1-2 weeks (at ~3 months age) had become 
extremely "wet cardboardy."  I strongly suspected that this was from hot 
side aeration, even though my techniques were the same as for other beers 
with good stability.


In reviewing my notes, I find that this was the case only with the
dunkels, NOT the Viennas.  In fact, I just had the last of a year old
Vienna that was in perfect condition.  I also opened a 2-1/2 year old
dunkel and 1-1/2 year old bock (BOS) that were made with mostly pilsner
malt and some crystal and home roast "almost chocolate" that were also in 
perfect condition.  It seems that the Munich malt is the one thing the two 
oxidized beers have in common.


Lee Menegoni and I have had an off-line discussion on this.  His 
experience is that all-Vienna beers are extremely stable.  At his 
suggestion, I reread the Fixes' "Vienna" and Darryl Richman's "Bock," 
both of which emphasize the importance of delivering the melanoidins to 
the wort in the reduced state rather than the oxidized state.  Oxidized 
melanoidins lead to several reaction chains that can result in later 
flavor instability, whereas reduced ones will actually protect beer from 
later staling reactions.  Fix didn't use Vienna malts in his recipes, 
apparently because at the time he wrote them, Vienna and Munich malts 
seemed to be of poor quality.  He has stated elsewhere (BT?) and here, I 
believe, that this is no longer the case, and Richman does use Munich 
predominantly in his dark bock recipes.  I still haven't figured out why 
my two dunkels made with nearly all Munich oxidized, whereas all my other 
decotion lagers (and all other beers, period) have not.  I don't think 
I'll make any more all Munichs until I do.

clean then very well.  Residual root beer flavor does not go well with
beer.

    Even a hose clamp does not resolve this problem too well.
    Has anyone come up with a solution for this problem?
  
 
 The hose clamp will actually aggravate the problem by squeezing it off.
 
 The choice of spigot was a tough call and I decided that this issue was less 
 of a problem than others created by other available cocks.  The one with a 
 hose barb, for example, does not have a hex on the outside to get a wrench on 
 to and I wanted to make it as easy to install as possible.
 
 I think the more one worries about the "problem" and tries to solve it, the 
 worse it gets.  If you just wet the end of the hose with a little sweet wort, 
 it will dry to a hard glue within a few minutes.  In three years, the only 
 time I had a hose fall off while sparging was when I used a hose clamp.
 
 I never bothered doing this, but I assume that if you rough up the end of the 
 bibb with a file or sand paper, it would never slide off.

It's not obvious, but actually there are two ways for a gas to enter the
container: convection (bulk flow) and diffusion.  The pressure difference
between the inside of the bottle and the surrounding air will, in fact,
prevent _flow_ (or convection) of oxygen into the beer.  However, diffusion
is driven by the difference in _concentration_ of oxygen in the beer and
air. Since there is, hopefully, very little oxygen in the beer to start with
there is a relatively strong driving force for diffusion of oxygen through
the plastic.  Also, the consumption of oxygen by reaction with the beer
(oxidation) ensures that the concentration of O2 inside the bottle will
remain low.  So, the relevant question is whether PET provides a barrier
for oxygen transport.  Since PET is used to keep CO2 _in_, and since
CO2 is a bigger molecule than O2, I would say it is very likely that O2
is free to diffuse through the plastic.  The conventional wisdom and the
tongues of talented tasters such as Lee Bussy seem to support this
conclusion.

I suspect that CO2 and O2 are not very permeable thru PET since, as has
been pointed out, soda retains its pressure over a long period of time.
One thing that does not enter into the physics of O2 diffusion, however,
is the pressure of the CO2 in the bottle.  While this may seem
counter-intuitive, even if the plastic were permeable to both gases, the
CO2 pressure inside would not affect O2 diffusion against this CO2
pressure gradient.  The atmospheric O2 would diffuse into the bottle and
come into equilibrium with the O2 in solution in the liquid in the bottle.
The presence of one solute does not affect the solubility or diffusion
rate of another.

Subject: O2 in PETs/Color conversion/Max efficiency


Dear Friends, comments on a few things in today's digest.  Dr. J. makes
the intuitive conclusion (as many before him have) that the positive
pressure of CO2 inside a bottle will keep any O2 out.  The amazing truth
is that the pressure will *not* prevent oxidation.  The process by which
O2 gets inside the bottles is diffusion, and diffusion typically takes
place in response to a gradient in chemical potential.  The chemical
potential for this instance is largely composition-dependent--that is,
because there is so much more oxygen outside the bottle than inside, there
is a "driving force" for oxygen to want to get inside.  This happens with
glass as well as plastic, but the amount of time it takes for oxygen to
diffuse through a glass bottle is many orders of magnitude longer than
that for plastic (because of vessel thickness and composition--plastic vs.
glass).


Dirk asks how to convert from srm color units to EBC.  Yes, for our
purposes, srm = Lovibond.  There is a conversion equation, but it is not
generally well-regarded by the pros, according to George Fix.  The
equation is: degrees Lovibond = 0.377 * EBC rating + 0.45.  Dr. George
says that this is reasonably applicable only for beers whose colors are
in the vicinity of about 4 srm--only the palest beers.  See Dr. George's
excellent article on color that he posted here last year (email me if you
want a copy, I've got it sitting in my email directory) for the Whole
Story.  A very similarly-worded account also appears in George and Laurie
Fix's book, Vienna.


Steve the Outlaw asks how to figure out the maximum extract from a given
grain bill.  You need access to some data for specific grain types for
starters.  Let's take a simple example: an ale made from 9 lb pale malt, 2
lb Munich, 1/4 lb crystal malt, and 1/2 lb gr wheat malt for heading.  The
data I have for these kinds of grain go like this: mashing 1 lb of these
grains in 1 gallon of water would give 36 gravity points for the pale
malt, 33 for the Munich, 29 for the crystal, and 39 for the wheat malt.
These are the basis for obtaining a calculated pts/lb/gallon efficiency.
What you do is just take a weighted average to get the max possible from
this grain bill. First, determine the fraction of the total bill made up
by each grain. The total amount of grain is 11.75 lb, so pale malt is
9/11.75 = 76.6% of the total.  Similarly, the Munich is 17.0%, the crystal
2.1%, and the wheat 4.3%.  Now multiply these fractions by the data values
above.  From the pale malt, you can get a max of 36 * .766 = 27.6 pts per
lb per gallon.  For the Munich, you can get max 5.6 ppg, from the crystal
0.6 ppg, and from the wheat 1.7.  Finally add these up: 27.6 + 5.6 + 0.6 +
1.7 = 35.5 pts/lb/gal is the theoretical 100% extraction.  After you
sparge, you compare your actual ppg with this to get % efficiency: if you
got 30 ppg, this would be about 85% efficiency.  The data on each grain are
contained in several of the brewing software programs, and I expect will
be in the forthcoming Grain FAQ that Jim Busch and Johh Palmer are
amassing.  Presumably some of the brewing books have this too.

Hi Folks.


The talk lately about using honey in beer caused me to notice
the bee in the logo of 'Boddington's Pub Draught Ale'. So I tried
it. Comes in cans and is imported into Canada (and probably the US)
from England.


The can includes an internal pressurized vessel that 'explodes' when
the can is opened, similar to the Guinness draught cans we get.
When you pop the top, the gas (nitrogen, I think) is released into
the beer, giving it the beautiful creamy head that the Brits are
famous for.


The ale has a subtle and delicious hint of honey along with the
requisite hop bitterness. Anyone have a suggestion for the honey
and hop treatment? I'd like to give it a try. 


Many thanks.

Subject:       Sam Adams joke
