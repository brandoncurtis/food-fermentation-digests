Wyeast Scottish (#1728 I believe) ferments actively at very low temperatures 
without any conditioning, as long as a large enough starter is pitched (lager 
levels). By very low I mean that I have used this yeast to ferment as low as
40 degF with very little flocculation or cessation of activity.


As I noted in an earlier post, this yeast is an extremely vigourous fermenter
at ale temperatures, producing prodigeous quantities of heat. At these 
temperatures, it also produces esters reminiscent of concord grapes.

Peter Williams comments on carbonating beer in PETs:


"I had to add a bit more priming sugar than I do in glass to compensate
for the volume increase of the container."


Huh?


I assume you're comparing a 12 ounce bottle to a 2l PET, and that the
difference doesn't have anything to do with the packaging material (..."to
compensate for the volume increase in the container."). But _MORE_ priming
sugar?? I think you ooopsed on the keyboard, because you would typically want
_less_ concentrated priming sugar in solution when using a larger package. You
certainly don't want to prime a kegged brew at the same rate as a bottled one.
Now if you're saying that you have to prime it more because of some property
of the PET compared to glass, then please clarify for us. Thanks.


I've noticed that commercial beers in PET bottles are somewhat more common in
Canada than south of the border (i.e., some are there; none here). I don't
know what you have there on the Atlantic, but on the other coast (the other
coast on the east-west dimension, anyway), I put aesthetic considerations aside
once and brought home a bottle of Nelson (BC) Brewery Traditional Ale in a 1l
PET and was greatly rewarded by a wonderful brew. Don't know what shelf life
would be, though--I shared it at a meeting within a couple weeks of returning
from that trip :-)

 ...And so have we, at least the ones who have been present on the occasions on
which Dennis has wandered across the room filling people's glasses from a 2l
PET of his eisbock :-) (Hi, Dennis!)

I'd like any information available on extract based brewpubs - names,

Texas has had the brewpub law for a little over one year now.  Some 
restaurants are curios about it, but don't have much room or capital for a 
classic all grain set-up.  I thought an extract system might be a good 
alternative.

Subject: RE: Mini-kegs


I have been using these for almost a year and a half now and they work 
great.  First of all, addressing the tapper issue with leaking CO2 
cartridges, it was mentioned that a customer had to screw it in with
a lot of muscle.  This in fact is what causes the problem.  You need to
only screw it in gently until the major CO2 blast subsides.  If you try
to "tighten" it further, you will chew up the plastic washer that holds
the cartridge in place.  Once this washer is damaged you will have the
CO2 leaks mentioned.  


Second, as to exploding kegs, does this mean that the bung is being shot
out or that the keg itself is damaged.  If the bung just popped out, they
have to make sure that it is pushed in all the way.  It is easy to leave
the bung just above the the lip where it needs to connected.  This often
requires light pounding with a hammer or a different brand of bung 
which will fit in more easily.  If this isn't what is meant by exploding
kegs, overpriming is the cause.  One half the priming sugar is required,
1/3 to 3/8 corn sugar for a 5 gallon batch.  The customers who stated that
they didn't overprime, either miscalculated or didn't understand.  I suppose
if the CO2 tap was left on all the time this could cause some problems.  
There has been some misconception about the use of the tap and that it
should be left open all the time.


If you are conservative with your CO2, just using short blasts, one
cartridge could last you one to one and a half kegs.  If you are more 
liberal with it in order to produce a good head as you get near the 
bottom of the keg, you might get less usage.  Hope this helps

  Good day Brewfolks


   Just a quick plug for the locals. If any of you folks get up here into the
   New England area, and more specifically, Western Mass, there is a relatively
   (under 6 months) new brewery called the Berkshire Brewery, located in S.Deer-
   field. It was my pleasure to try their first bottled offering (that I've 
   seen) Steel Rail Pale Ale. Scored a solid VTS (Very Tasty Stuff) on the 
   Rickstr(tm) Scale. Standard disclaimers, not affiliated, blah, blah, blah.
   (But if one of the principals reads this and wants to put me on his "Free
    Samples" list, I'll be happy to change the disclaimer)

I tried SA 3bock last week and was truly disgusted.  Some of the tasters
found "meaty" or "soy sauce" like flavors that competed effectively
with the "nice" flavors.  Is this an unusual bottle or a flavor found
in all of the stuff?  I'm asking because I have a few other bottles that
I will give away if I can expect the other bottles to taste the same.
I would be interested in tasting notes from others. ThanX

Subject: 5 litre mini-kegs


I would like to offer a datapoint or two to this thread. I got my setup
for Christmas. It is the Frische (sp?) metal tap setup. I kegged up 2
on 12/28 of a Bock that i had ready. Upon advice from my local HB store
I primed with 3/4 cup of corn sugar. I did this since I also bottled
24 bottles from the same batch. The kegs sat in my pantry until I chilled
one last Saturday. The other is still in the pantry. I have seen no
distortion of the kegs.


The chilled keg was tapped Sunday for the Cowboy game. I agree that it
took a pretty hefty twist to get the cartridge seated and punctured. My
tap has a valve on it to control the CO2 flow. I initially allowed the 
beer to flow under natural pressure. When needed I opened the tap handle
and then rotated the pressure valve to get the flow I wanted. This
seems to work but I have a lot of practicing to do! The keg was killed during
the course of the game. I found that it took about 1 full cartridge and
part of another to move all the beer. This amounts to two since there 
doesn't sem to be a way to use just part of a cartridge.


At two cartridges/keg over the course of 3 hours I am not thrilled. This
gets pretty expensive! It also makes me wonder about what happens if a 
keg is tapped and then it is consumed over the course of several days!


It is possible I have a leak at the cartridge connection point also. Someone
in the archives mentions using Vaseline or similar lubricant to try and
get a better seal. I may try this when I tap the next one. 


I like the convenience but I am not crazy about the cost in CO2. My 
local HB store gets $15.95/10 cartridges which is steep! Does anyone know
if there are other sources of the cartridges that are compatible?


I post again when I gain some more knowledge!

Subject: Fermentap problem/Refrigerator construction


        The Fermentap gizmo has been getting a bit of attention here 
     lately, and I thought my recent experience might be helpful to 
     any new users/potential buyers.
     
        Santa left me one of these thingywhompers for Christmas, and I 
     was looking forward to giving it a try.  I rapidly discovered 
     that an element critical to the assembly was, much like 
     batteries, not included.  The piece-part in question was a 
     standard 3/8 inch OD plastic racking cane.  "No problem," I 
     thought.  "Just pick one up at the ol' homebrew supply."  Well, I 
     did just that, but when I attempted final assembly of the device, 
     the tube didn't fit through the designated hole.  A quick call to 
     the distributor/manufacturer revealed that at least one other 
     person had called with a similar problem.  The gentleman I spoke 
     with suggested that my brand new racking cane might be out of 
     specification.  I checked, and found that my new racking cane was 
     actually somewhere between 3/8 and 7/16 inch OD (limit of 
     precision on my yardstick).  By this time, the homebrew supply 
     store was closed...but not Home Depot!  I found a 30 inch 3/8 OD 
     wash basin standpipe rated for potable water service for 97 
     cents, which fit my Fermentap just right.  Even came with its own 
     Teflon compression fitting.  So, the moral of the story is: Take 
     your Fermentap valve body with you when you go out to buy your 
     racking cane.
        Can't report yet on how the thing performs under the stress of 
     actual fermentation...If some useful info arises from my 
     experience, I'll pass it on.
     ----------------------------
     There has also been some discussion of late about refrigerators, 
     freezers, and temperature control.  I recently learned something 
     about how standard upright refrigerators (with the freezer on 
     top) are constructed that might help those who are trying to 
     control refrigerator compartment temperature with (or without) an 
     aftermarket expanded range temperature controller.
     
     Most of these refrigerators have what appear to be two 
     temperature control dials; one for the fridge, and one for the 
     freezer.  My refrigerator (and as I understand it, most typical 
     uprights) really only has one temperature control.  The dial for 
     "Freezer" sets the temperature range for the freezer compartment. 
      The "Fridge" control regulates how much cold air from the 
     freezer compartment is allowed into the refrigerator compartment 
     to keep it cool in there.  You may have noticed that if you crank 
     down the temperature for your freezer, things in the refrigerator 
     section will freeze even though you've made no changes to the 
     other dial setting.  Changing one setting impacts the temperature 
     in both compartments, and the only way to really control the 
     system is by placing reasonably accurate thermometers in each 
     compartment, and making adjustments to only one "control" at a 
     time, then allowing several hours to assess the effect.

Subject: 5 liter mini-kegs


Yes,


Use only the large German made CO2 canisters with the German made taps.
Get some and carefully compare the ends of these "precision made" german
ones with the crappy grey ones sold by brew shops which don't know any
better.


The thing you'll immediately notice is that there is no consistency
relating the "depth" of the seal on the crappy ones.  As a result, the
cylinder does not mate with the rubber seal in the tap as the screw cap is
being closed "before" the metal seal in the cylinder is breached.  On the
quality cylinders, the metal seal is always recessed the proper amount to
allow the rubber seal in the tap to maintain a seal while the tap breaches
the metal seal in the cylinder.  Now someone with a lot of mechanical 
skill could fabricate a washer which would add enough depth to seal even
the sloppy cylinders prior to breaching the metal seal, but I have to 
ask the silly question, WHY?  The 16oz "quality" cylinders cost exactly
twice as much as the crappy 8oz. ones.  You get twice as much gas with 
half as much hassle for the same price per oz., so why screw with the
crappy 8oz cylinders?


Now that's the rest of the story.

Subject:       ppm vs. mg/l


Teddy Winstead asks about converting mg/l to ppm.  The answer is that 
the two are functionally equivalent.  1 litre of pure water weighs 1 
kilogram at standard temperature and pressure (25C, 1 atm. pressure).  
Thus, 1 milligram of any substance dissolved in 1 litre gives a 
concentration of 1 part per million by weight.  For brewing purposes, 
variations in liquid density due to temperature fluctuations and 
presence of fermentables can be ignored.

        3/4 C. Freshly Brewed Espresso
        EDME dry ale yeast
        3/4 C. corn sugar for priming


        Living in a region with poor public water supply has 
unfortunately -or- fortunately forced me to use bottled water. For this I 
used distilled water with 1 Tbsp. water crystals added. Steep specialty 
grains then remove. Add vanilla,espresso,and extracts. Boil for an hour 
and cool. Rack to primary and pitch yeast. Within minutes activity was 
observed. Within 12 hours active fermentation, *WARNING* after this stage 
you WILL need to use a blow off rig. The activity subsided after 2 1/2 
days then racked to secondary for 12 days to ensure no bottle bombs!
Bottled with corn sugar and aged `at`room temp for 8 days. It is now 3 weeks 
in the basement and better than ever.
Taste: It has a smooth, chocolaty, warm fuzzy flavor perfect for sitting 
        in front of the fireplace.
Q: anyone who gets the O.G., F.G., and % alchohol please send.
        Enjoy,

The recent discussion regarding just how an acid rest acidifies the mash
prompted me to go look up the reactions involved.  This is from Noonan's 
BREWING LAGER BEER, p. 107:


     Ca5Mg(C6H12O24P6*3H2O)2
            Phytin
              +
             7H2O
              |
           Phytase
              |
             \ /
      releases into solution:


       C6H6[OPO (OH)2]6
         Phytic Acid


           C6H12O6
         Myo-Inositol


       and precipitates:


         5CaHPO4*2H2O
     Calcium Phosphate (Secondary)


         MgHPO4*3H2O
     Magnesium Phosphate (Secondary)


The pH of the mash is decreased by the phytic acid, the mineral content of the
liquid extract is increased, and the myo-inositol is a B-vitamin which
contributes to yeast growth.

Actually, my usual procedure is to primary ferment ales at 60-65, followed by
a couple of weeks conditioning at 50-55.  I pitch a healthy yeast starter and
aerate my wort well, and have never experienced a stuck, slow fermentation at
these temperatures.  As I recently posted, I have a porter in progress now which
inadvertantly underwent primary fermentation at 50-55.  The resulting
fermentation was slow (behaving more lager-like), but never became stuck even
at these low temperatures.


One of the things I've learned over the past year of reading the HBD is that
things I assumed were conventional wisdom ain't necessarily so.  This post thus
caused me to go back to my library and see what others have to say about ale
fermentation temperatures.  So, a couple of references that support my practice:


>From Terry Foster's PORTER, "The most important consideration in the primary
fermentation is that of temperature, with 60 to 68 degrees F (15.5 to 20 degrees
C) being the optimum range. . .Basically, secondary fermentation is best carried
out at 50 to 55 degrees F (10 to 13 degrees C), which is quite typical for an
English cellar."


And from Noonan's SCOTCH ALE, "At this period [the 1830s], when the usual
Scottish pitching temperature was 50 degrees F (10 degrees C), a typical English
brew began at 65 degrees F (18 degrees C).  The flavor impact of the increased
esters produced at the higher temperature distinctly separates English ales
from those of Scotland."

By now, I'm sure your mailbox is full of messages pointing out that mg/L and
ppm are one and the same thing.  In SI units, concentration (just like density)
is measured in g/mL.  So:


     1 mg/L * 1L/1000mL * 1g/1000mg = 1/1*10^6 g/mL = 1 ppm

Subject: question about CO2 and equilibrium


Joe Santos resently made a point that I had not considered in the
talks about O2 & CO2 diffusion in plastic bottles


 Because the concentration of O2 
is close to nil O2 WILLpermeate the plastic until equilibrium is
attained 
between the concentration in the beer and the atmospheric
concentration 
surrounding the bottle.
        I have learned my chemistry lesson of the day!


BTW, If I understand this correctly the pressure in the plastic
bottle 
would increase due to the excess O2 pressure. Could this be a
cause for 
concern?




Even though the laws of diffusion say that there is a force to
equilibrate the concentration of each individual compound across
a barrier,  the force created internally by the fermentation
reaction is greater.  I would be surprised if the force due to
diffusion was great enough to burst or deform a container of
reasonable strength, so if CO2 Can't get out, but O2 can get in,
I would bet that true equilibrium would never be reached due to
the pressure constraint.  Furthermore, if the O2 diffusion is
slow,  the CO2 pressure will build up in a matter of days so that
the ability to uptake other gases would be greatly reduced in a
very short time, assuming of course that all seals are adaquate.

Subject: Licorice-y?/Dry Stout/Compost


Spencer and Pierre both took me to task for describing something as unlike
itself, and guess what? they're right.  I believe most people got my drift,
its just unfortunate that my hands didn't follow what my brain was saying.
What I meant was that brewers licorice tastes very different than licorice
candy, which as Pierre pointed out, is made largely from anise.  Apologies
to those that were confused.  Also, like Pierre, I feel that licorice has a
much softer flavor, and is thus better suited to beers.  I have also used it
quite successfully in a mead.
******
A number of people requested information in regard to my attempts at dry
stout recipes ala Guinness, so I thought I'd post it to the digest:


Grain Bill (for 15 US gallons):
16 lbs Hugh Baird 2 row
5 lbs Flaked Barley (I use the stuff available at a Korean grocery store)
2 lbs Hugh Baird Roast (550 L)
Water treatment: 12 g CaCO3 (in grist)


When using UK pale malt, I forego any rest in the mash. The high protien
count in the flaked not only yields a creamy texture, it also contributes
to foam positive protiens that can be degraded by excessively long mashing
routines.  If you do use dometic pale, I reccomend using the cereal grain as
the heating agent to up the mash to sach temperatures.  Simply cook the
flaked in a pot with sufficient (read: lots) water to account for swelling
- -- 5 pounds of cooked flaked yields a volume of about 16 liters!
Presumably, many of you will be scaling the recipe down, so this should be
less of a problem.  Please note however, that flaked does not require a
cereal cooking to gelatinize.  Barley gelatinizes between 145-148F, thus at
normal sach temepratures takes care of itself.  Typically, I mash at 154F for
one hour, Luater for 40 minutes at 168F.  Target gravity of this beer is
1038-1040 (9.5-10 Plato).  This is very important.  If you want to have that
dry finish, you must restrain yourself.  You may not have to though, given
the fact that in some lauter setups the high percentage of flaked causes
problems with extraction, but I have not found this to neccesarily hold.
I also reccomend grinding the roast separately with the mill spacing set
closer.  This is to assure greater color saturation of the wort.  It also
should be noted that if you use the lower lovibond roast widely available
you will not get the beer dark enough.


Hops should only be used for bittering, no flavor or aroma hops are present
in draft Guinness, hence none here.  But it is a quite bitter beer, targeted
for 40-50 IBU.  I favor the use of low and mid-alpha hops even for
bittering, and have found Willamettes to be a good choice.  In my current
recipe, that calls for 160 g of 5 alpha hops.  Again, my previous posts
about the vagaries of utilization rates apply: YMMV.  However, this beer
certainly can be overhopped, and when in doubt, I reccomend erring on the
light side (believe me I have done both and you can simply swamp the
creaminess with too much bittering).


Amazingly, of all the styles of beer I have made, this is the most
yeast-insensitive.   I have made good examples with Sierra, Mendocino, 1084,
1969, Fullers, 1098 and even 2036 fermented at 62F.  The grain bill and
hopping are what I have had to tinker with, and the reputed Guinness yeast
(Wyeast 1084) does not seem to impart anything extraordinary.  This is quite
surprising given the dramatic influence I have found yeast strain to impart
in other styles when experimeted with in A/B fermentations.  Sometimes I
add a small amount of 88% Lactic Acid (<10 ml) to the fermented beer to give
a slight sourness as evident in Guinness Draft, but often the beer comes out
with a faint tartness of its own, thus elimiating that need.


Obviously, having a Nitrogen setup really help to develop the legendary
head.  In lieu of that, go for very low carbonation (<1.5 vols. CO2) and do
what you have to to mix in air bubbles (in the glass!).  All other
proceedures are relatively standard.  Good Luck.
********
One private poster reccomended to me that compost makes for great mulch, and
that spent hops and grains etc. make great material for the hop yard.  While
this is true for fully composted materials (and that is where my spents end
up) if you  put your spent grains and other highly reduced organic materials
directly on your hop mounds you are asking for trouble.  the reason is
temperature.  Compost piles regularly reach in excess of 160F, and thats
plently to kill live plant tissues.  You can get by putting spent hops
directly on your hops though, because what little substrate they offer for
decomposition is washed quickly into the soil profile.  Make a separate
compost pile for grains and kitchen wastes and use that for building topsoil
in your garden after fully composted.  Compost, having a very high content
of humus (mostly humic and fulvic acids) really helps assure regulated and
sustainable soil productivity.

I've had these little powerhouse peppers.  My brewing partner has chile
pequins growing wild all over his yard.  We've thought about using them in a
brew, but they may be a bit too hot.

Here in Austin, we can get fresh chipotles.  I think I am going to try these
instead of the canned.  This way I won't be adding anything extra that may
be in the sauce (vinegar?).

I wish to thank everyone who responded either in private or in public to my
