I have cultured yeast by creating agar slants following a publication that I
had bough specifically for the subject (I can't think of the name right off -
something like, "Yeast Culturing For The Homebrewer").  Anyway, the book is not
very big - only about 40 pages.  This description might jar someone elses
memory on this HBD.  Anyway, I have propagated yeast from pure cultures (the
expensive ones you talk about - $3-$4 each) using the methods in the book.  As
far as I can tell from my experience doing this is that you can 'see' the yeast
growing on the culture medium (which is the malt, yeast nutrient, and agar mix
 - agar is a type of gelatin).  If you store these slants for several months you
will notice that some of them may grow mold or other things.  They will not
look creamy white like they are supposed to.  I doubt very much that if you
propagated yeast in a starter solution that you could see this contamination. 
The only way you could tell if you had a yeast culture that had gone astray
would be either a microscope or by tasting the culture (not an exact science by
any means).
You should consider how many batches of beer you will make in a year as well. 
If you use more than, say, 5 different yeasts throughout the year and you are
thinking of propagating the pure yeast cultures, you will end up with 10 slants
per pure culture.  That's 50 slants + in your refridgerator.  Granted not all
of them will be 'good' but that is a lot of beer per year if you use one slant
per starter per 5 gallon batch.
I occasionally culture yeast but for the most part I just reuse what is in the
fermenter from the previous batch.  After siphoning the beer out of the
fermenter and kegging, I put the next batch of wort right on top of the
yeast sediment (and some trub) on the bottom.  Thus, handling of the yeast
slurry in the bottom of the fermenter is kept to a minimum (you don't have to
dump it out into a container and then repitch).  This has worked well for me. 
There is still some beer left in the fermenter so the new stuff I dump in will
mix with it but this has never been a problem and I have never had
contamination from doing this.  I repeat this scenario with about 4 batches and
then dump the slurry and start over.  This works well if you are into seasonal
brewing (ales in spring and fall, lager in winter, wheat beer in summer).


I hope it helps.

Subject: 5 liter minikegs


After asking several questions and getting some excellent advice I now have
somthing I think I can contribute regarding the minikegs.  I've been using
them for about a year and have had both good and bad experiences.  I've put
plisners, wheat, bock and a somewhat ill defined light and very hoppy beer
into them.  My biggest complaint is the amount of foam you get from them.
 This, I find, is somewhat dependent upon style of beer.  Heavier beers
foamed more in my experience.


I don't put an entire 5 gallon batch into the kegs.  I always split into 2
kegs and the rest bottles.  I use 1/3 cup of corn sugar for priming the
entire batch and then fill the 2 kegs.  I then add a bit more sugar before
filling the bottles.  The following chart was provided to me when I boughtthe
kegs:


# kegs filled                                          sugar for rest of
batch
      4                                                             none
      3                                                         1.5
tablespoons
      2                                                          3
tablespoons
      1                                                          5
tablespoons


I've never had any sweeling, leaking or other physical type problems.


I usually tap without a CO2 cartridge and use the natural carbonation until
it runs out.  To eliminate foaming, I depress the handle all the way down.
 You gotta be quick or you lose most of the beer to foam.  Generally, I draw
into a pitcher and let the foam settle somewhat.  Makes me feel like a real
pub owner ;-) When I can't get any more beer from the keg I put in one of the
CO2 cartridges.  I only goose it up enough to pour a beer with a reasonable
head, then turn it back down.  If I run out of beer in the keg and still have
CO2 in the cartridge I just take the tap off and put it into the next keg.
 If you're careful you can remove the gizmo without relaessing the gas.  Just
be sure to turn it off at the valve.  I've used one cartridge for two full
kegs!!!


All in all I like my system.  I don't have an extra fridge for the larger
kegs and this allows me to keep some "draft" beer around to impress my
firends.


Hope this helps someone out there.


Happy brewing

Subject: 5-litre mini kegs




Thanks all for the replies I've been getting regarding the leaking CO2 
tap and the "exploded" kegs. I fear I have lead some astray in using the 
word "exploded". I have used it liberally as the opposite to imploded. 
However, as some have experienced, the symptom was really a matter of 
severe bulging at both ends. One of the cans bulged so much that it could 
not stand up. I should  also mention that this can blew its rubber seal 
(cork) spewing the contents all over the owner's walls. (Brew-art?)
This supposedly could cause serious injury if one happened to be in the way.


In any case, I will provide a summary of comments in the near future from 
the replies I have received. Just a note in passing, one reply mentioned 
using the 16g. CO2 cylinders rather than the smaller ones. It is the 16g. 
cylinders that are being used in this case. I'm also quite amazed about 
the number of people who are also experiencing leaking cylinders/taps. 
Perhaps we should send the collected comments to Fass Frisch in Germany 
so they can perfect the problem?

I went to the brew store last night and replaced two leaky poppets.  
The store recommended that I apply some vaseline to the poppets to get

Hi,


I am sorry I don't know your name, but I will provide you a simple answer to
your question; Acidity.


During the brewing/fermenting process, the pH of the beer just keeps on
lowering and lowering. I think it bottoms out around 4 (I'm not an expert I
just pretend to be one).   Anyhow, There are no *known* pathogens that can
survive in a medium of this acidity level. In fact, there are few organisms
period that can live in such a hellish environment. 


The alcohol that is produced during fermentation is another factor in limiting
the growth of organisms - esp. pathogens.


Perhaps one of you more microbiologically minded individuals can correct me?

Subject: Wortus Interruptus / PET caps /low-temp starters


     Disaster yesterday. I was most of the way through the sparge and had 
     the first several gallons of the runnings in the brewpot on the stove, 
     just starting toward a boil. Long story unrelated to brewing, but I 
     ended up in the emergency room with my son and his friend and a couple 
     smashed fingers and didn't get back til late at night. Had about four 
     gallons of sparged wort in a carboy, about three gallons of wort that 
     had been heated to maybe 150 and then turned off to cool down at its 
     own rate. No way could I finish the process--I'll complete everything 
     tonight when I get home from work.
     
     Question (for future reference, since I've already done what I 
     did)--what's the best thing to do when you've got no choice but to 
     stop when you're only half way toward the climax of your process? My 
     choices were: 1) put it all in the brewpot and stick it in the oven at 
     some temperature (180? 200? 210?) and leave it for about 18 hours. 2) 
     leave it all at room temperature. 3) cool it down to refrigerator 
     temperatures (this time of year, just stick it out on the porch). More 
     general question is how to minimize harm to the final beer by treating 
     the stranded wort the best way.
     
     Another Q--Never done PET bottles but would like to try a few for 
     portability. Do you just re-use the original plastic caps or do you 
     get new ones somewhere? Where?
     
     While I'm on--when I asked awhile ago about which ale yeast was best 
     for low temperatures, I had several off-list replies to the effect 
     that if I used a starter at the low temperature, the pitched yeast 
     would work better at the low temperature. True?

Hello,


I saw your HBD message on pathogens and thought I would put in my
two cents worth.


As far as pathogens are concerned I am not sure. Although, here is
what I have to say about carcinogens.


Trihalomethanes (THM's) are disinfection byproducts that are formed
when chlorine reacts with naturally-occurring organic substances in
water. The major THM that is formed is the potential carcinogen,
chloroform. The amount of THM's formed depends on the chlorine
level, amount of Total Organic Carbon in the water, contact time,
temperature and pH. 


Chlorine in the form of liquid sodium hypochlorite (laundry bleach)
or calcium hypochlorite (chlorine pellets), is a very common
chemical in domestic water treatment. It is used to disinfect,
remove iron, control iron bacteria, and oxidize hydrogen sulfide. 
For homebrewers the only concern would be using water treated with
high levels of chlorine, which is sometimes the case in certain
cities. The THM's could be formed during the fermentation process
when the chlorine in the water reacts with the sediment. Although,
if chlorine levels are that high the water would have a definite
taste and smell which would make it undesirable for brewing.


Currently, Canadian Drinking Water Quality Guidelines recommend a
maximum concentration of 0.350 mg/L (ppm). Alberta (Canada) is
considering lowering that level to 0.100 mg/L.


Methods to remove THM's include Activated Carbon Filters (removal
efficiency decreases with age).


NOTE:


     It is important to keep things in perspective. Most
     homebrewers maintain sanitary conditions. This includes the
     rinsing of the bleach cleaning solution. Therefore, the 
     chance of THM's causing cancer in the homebrewing process
     is extremely low. In most cases the level of chlorine required
     to cause cancer would make the beer taste horrible. 


     I just added this article to make the homebrewer aware of his/
     her hobby. You can never know enough!

G'day all,


I am in the process of scaling up a bit, from 10 gal to 1 bbl

I recall a few folks conversing about fermentation in the 1/2 bbl's.


>From my past experiences with carboy fermentation, and an examination
of the Sankeys, it seems like it would be impossible to clean the

Subject: foop; carcinogens


Hi folks--
 The FOOP discussions prompted me to do something I've never done 
before-- I bottled my krausen.  I brewed a stout that blew off over a 
litre of beer.  This blowoff was collected in a 1 gallon jug with a 
two-holed stopper-- one for the blowoff, one for the airlock.  When 
fermentation stoppped, I bottled it.  Results-- slightly overbittered for 
a stout ( which aren't all that bittered anyway) but not overpowering.  
It was a fine drink.  The main result that I was interested in was the 
head.  As this beer originated as foam, I wanted to see how the 
head turned  out.  It had the best head of any beer I've brewed to date.  
Thick as cream, lacing right to the bottom.  Take this information any 
which way you will.  
  Somebody asked aboiut carcinogens in beer.  Pathogens-- you would have 
to analyze youir brew for pathogenic microbes, but as far as I know yoiu 
brew sterile stuff, and any infections are on purpose ( you infect wort 
with yeast) unless you are not sanitizing everything prop[erly.  However, 
beer is full of carcinogens.  Alcohol is a carcinogen, yeast has 
carcinogens, as do hops, malt, and tap water.  The air we breathe 
contains carcinogens.  You can't escape them-- but yoiu have to 
understand that the amounts can be so infinitely small they have no real 
effect.  ie. smoke 40 cigarettes; breathe L.A. smog for a year-- you'll 
get the same amounts of carcinogens.  Chlorination of drinking water 
results in chloroform formation-- a carcinogen.  Hop oils and 
preservative properties of hops are that way because they can resist 
microbes-- its a chemical defence-- these chemicals are carcinogens.  Go 
to the library, pick up a book on pharmacology or on toxins and read on.  
Best thing-- relax, don't worry, give the insurance guy a homebrew.

I bought the same unit (pH Checker) made in Mauritania and have had

handheld pH meters, and noticed they all sold units in the $35-$40 range
and that the specs for these units were identical.  This skimpy data
suggests there is a single OEM for the pH Checker, which is sold under
various names.


I've had sporadic readings from my meter, too, even after a given
reading appeared to have stabilized.  In talking to the techs at these
various suppliers, I was told it's critical to ensure the probe is kept as
far away from the sample container as possible--and one indicated
that too small a container will render the readings unreliable.
Something about some normalized "cell size" which apparently
determines an ion gradient occuring in liquids in containers.
Believe me, I'm reading a lot between the lines on this one.


In any case, tonight I plan to conduct some experiments with tap water
to see how readings are driven by sample size, planetary alignment,
etc.

The statement 
under discussion is usually rendered as "no known pathogens survive in beer".
Reasons commonly given are the low pH and alcohol content of beer.


Questions:


1. When we say "survival in beer" what are the limits in terms of 
time & fermentation characteristics?  Is a weak disordered fermentation just
as hostile as a strong normal type?


2. Is there something mutally exclusive about the characteristics
of the microbes that can survive in beer and human pathogens?


3. If the anser to (2) is no, are there any genera of pathogens that stand 
any chance of mutating such that they survive in beer?

You are correct, the recipe is for 5 gal. I started in a 6.5 gal primary 
and lost 3-4 quarts in blowoff and a little more in racking. The 
secondary was completed in a 5 gal. carboy. Both primary and secondary 
are glass. As I stated this was an experiment and in retrospect I would 
have started with less water to minimize loss. The blowoff tube went into 
a 5 gal. bucket of water and after finishing I think th S.G. of the

>Has anybody had any experience with acclimatizing an

I haven't attempted to acclimate (acclimatize indeed!) thru culturing; 
however, we used Wyeast #1728 (Scottish Ale) at about 55F and achieved what 
we were
looking for--a somewhat relaxed ferment and production of a 3:1 gravity drop
per the book _Scotch Ale_ (Noonan?) from AOB.  I don't  know the specs on
1728, but it certainly had no trouble at 55F--except we had to hot start it 
(70F).


My impression from the _Scotch Ale_ book is that for the traditional 
Scottish
ales, one tries to do everything to make life miserable for the yeast, with 
the
objective of much unfermented fermentables in the final product (malty).
 -----------------------


Here's a question regarding our plan form clarifying a brown ale batch
using isinglass..


We currently have a 5gal and a 6 gal carboy each finishing up a ferment
from a single 11 gal brown ale batch.  Our plan is to rack these both into
a single 1/2 bbl keg with the recommended charge of liquid isinglass.
We then propose to put an airlock on the keg (just in case) and cool
from the current 64F to maybe 45F and hold there for about a week.


Then, we propose to rack again into our dispensing keg and force
carbonate there preparatory to...well, drinking.  The thinking here is as
follows: cool to assist in precipitating out the junk, and rack again to
avoid having so much sediment in our dispensing keg.


Q1: Does this plan sound okay?


 We 'think' we detect a slight sulfur smell emanating from the
carboy airlocks--and I suspect autolysis->diacetyl, yet we're still
getting bubbles (at least) 1 per min.  This really rankles my butt.  We're
already at about 64F, so a diacetyl rest seems out of the question.
This leads me to ask:


Q2: How can the amateur actually detect diacetyl content with
accuracy (my taste buds and nose are useless)--everyone talks about
 it but I've never seen any mention of how pro brewers actually MEASURE it.

        I tried this method a number of times with different yeasts with

dead. I know you can't use a frost-free fridge ... mine is an upright freezer

a laboratory grade freezer (-70 deg F?) for this method to work.
        I now use an "original starter" method for keeping yeast up to about
6 months. When I get a new yeast pack/tube/culture, I make a starter right 
away (32 oz jar fitted with stopper/airlock), build up the culture, then feed
it again and put it away in my beer fridge at 35 deg. The yeast (even ale yeast)
stays happy as long as there is food and it stays active. When I want to use 
a stored yeast, I make a new starter and innoculate it with some of the stored  
culture. I feed the "original starter" and put it back in the fridge until the  
next use. The new starter is active in 24 hours and ready to pitch in 48 hours. 
There are exceptions, of course. I like to build up the starters for lagers and
higher gravity beers. Just one more way a frugal (read : cheap) homebrewer

        Of course we know that good ol' Clorox is a great sanitizer, but I

using it was simple- I'm a male and therefore sloppy. Spilling bleach and
bleach/water from a chugging carboy as you empty it is the norm, and I
didn't want to worry about ruining the clothes I had on. With B-Brite, I
wouldn't have to worry, because, like Clorox 2, it's color safe!
        So I'm back to bleach for now, but what's the deal? Is B-Brite an

Hello all,


How does one cap 2L PET bottles?  Do you just crank down on the original 
cap?


Happy brewing!

When considering the permiability of a material to a particular gas,
you must consider the area and the thickness.  Comparing the rubber
O-ring of a soda keg to a PET bottle, consider that the area of the
O-ring is probably less than 4% of the 2-liter PET bottle and that the
thickness of the O-ring is probably 20 times that of the PET bottle.
Therefore, even if the rubber O-ring was 10 times more permiable
than the PET bottle, the rate of diffusion would still be 50 times 
lower with the soda keg.

Our mailer croaked a couple of days ago and a post of mine was probably
lost into the ether.  I don't recall most of the things that I mentioned,
but I do recall one.  Jim Busch correctly explained the mechanism of the
acid rest, namely the enzyme phytase, at about 95F, will convert phytin
into phytic acid.  This is the first rest in the classic, Bohemian triple-
decoction.  However, he did not mention that you don't *have* to do a
decoction mash to use an acid rest.  Although you do not get the other
benefits of decoction mashing (i.e. higher extract efficiency from
undermodified malt and increased malt flavours), you can still make use
of the acid rest to acidify your mash even if you use a stovetop-type
mash.  Simply mash-in your temperature-controlled mash so the temp
settles at 95F and then go up from there.  It's probably not a good
idea to use an acid rest if you are doing a true step-infusion (raising
the temps strictly by adding boiling water) since the volume of mash liquor,
by the time you get to mashout, will be exceedingly large.
