Indeed this is one version of "efficiency" and is the one used by commercial
brewers (also called "extract"). Unfortunately home brewers often talk about 
"efficiency" meaning what proportion of the theoretical maximum extract yield 
they get from their mash. ie. Given pale malt can possibly yield 35 
pts/lb/gallon
and a homebrewer gets 30, his "efficiency" can be described as 30/35=86%
(homebrewers' efficiency), or 30/46=65% (extract). This can be very confusing
and I am not sure when or why homebrewers first started using this measure.
(I admit my guilt in using this definition also!)
I certainly know that with the SUDS software (available from the archive site
via FTP), the "efficiency" square actually refers to homebrewers' efficiency,
and not "extract".
"Homebrewers' efficiency" is a pretty sloppy sort of quantity. What we really
mean by this is "how efficient our mash technique is compared with Dave
Miller's", since the numbers he gives (eg. 35 pts/lb/gallon for pale malt)
are the actual numbers he achieves in his brewery. In theory these numbers
should vary all over the place, depending upon the exact grain you use
(eg. protein content of pale malt), but in practice everyone seems to use
35 (or 36) pts/lb/gallon pretty universally! Even so, once you know the
"homebrewers' efficiency" of your setup, you can plug this number into
SUDS and get a pretty good estimation of the starting gravity of the next
batch you are planning to brew.
I hope this clarifies people's worts!

Nigel Townsend comments on the use of vaseline to seal kegs.
I would recommend glycerol (available from supermarkets). This
seals well and is less messy. Some also use this to help prevent
damaging yeast when freezing, so it is a "brew-friendly" product.

Subject: UK-oriented Homebrewing Newsgroup - Request for feedback.




20th Jan. 1995


     This has been posted to The HomeBrew Digest and to
the Usenet Newsgroup rec.crafts.brewing.


     This is a request for feedback on the subject of
setting up a UK-oriented Newsgroup under the uk.* prefix
of Newsgroups.


     As a UK Homebrewer I have found both HBD and r.c.b
to be invaluable and enjoyable aids to improving my
Brew and in meeting new Net-friends on both sides of the
Great Pond. In saying that, however, I and other UK
Homebrewers feel that the orientation of both HBD and r.c.b
tends toward that of US brewing and it is sometimes
difficult for us to find answers to questions that are
heavily oriented toward UK matters.


     There can be no mistake that there are many differences
in the history, styles, methods, ingredients etc. between
UK and US brewing and there is a feeling that a UK-specific
Newsgroup would be useful to UK Homebrewers as well as
non-UK Homebrewers that are interested in UK-specific
brewing matters.


     For this purpose I have been investigating the subject
of creating such a Newsgroup under the uk.* prefix. This
is not an official Usenet prefix but is carried by many
UK News servers and MAY be available outside of the UK but
this is not clear to me at present.


     The uk.* Newsgroups work, to an extent, like the alt.*
Newsgroups in that they are created and maintained in a
less formal way. There is no need for voting as such but
a formal proposal must be submitted and discussed before
the group can be created and it is for this reason that I
am asking for feedback on the subject.


     I am asking anybody who has any opinions on this
subject to EMAIL ME DIRECTLY at...


     B.Gowland`at`rhbnc.ac.uk


 ...and let me know what you think of the idea. I am proposing
that the name should be uk.rec.crafts.brewing but would like
to hear other ideas. There is already a uk.rec.* prefix and
the name would also indicate its parallel to r.c.b.


     I will attempt to post this request a few more times over
the next couple of weeks in order that I can get the attention
of as many people as possible - apologies for the bandwidth
used - I promise to restrict it to a minimum number of postings.


Thanks for your time,


Cheers,

Several Replies Today, just one post to save bandwith... :-)


For those of you intrested in BT (Brews Technologies), Ill give my short 
expierence with it.  I emailed them on the 19th, about 4am, and by 5am, 
had a response that they were sending me an issue, and billing me.  How 
nice of them eh?  So for those of you Credit Card impared, email them. 
btcirc`at`aol.com.  No affiliation, just satisfied.

Next somone mentioned in a "p.s." that they were worried that they spend 
too much time worrying about what they need to buy building their 
homebrew equipment, vs. actualy brewing beer.  Hey, it happens to 
everyone I think!  I dont know one person that has "everything" there is 
to brew beer. Somone always wants a cooker, PH tester, kegging setup, or 
god knows what else.  I know im that way all the time, my wife never 
hears the constant saying "When I get a few extra bucks, im going to go 
buy a...".  My rule of thumb is, lacking equipment or not, if I run out 
of beer, i brew more. :-).
- ---


Now, my questions...


First off, there seems to be only a few brewclubs in the chicagoland 
area.  None of which seem very local to me.  I have been thinking over 
the idea for a while of getting some people together, and starting our 
own club.  Has anyone here started thier own brewclub?  Whats involved?  
Is it a good idea to have somone thats a "Brew God" in the club?  I 
consider myself a rather advanced all grain brewer, but *FAR* from 
knowing all there is to know about beer brewing...  Can anyone help me 
with this?


Secondly, im just now conisdering entering my beers into competition.  I 
never really wanted to before, simply because I found it more fun to brew 
something I like to drink, rather than "To Style".  Anyhow, U BREW 
Midwest BBS has a list of upcomming events and some are "AHA Club Only 
Events".  Obviously I know what AHA stands for, but what I dont know, is 
there a AHA "club" that you nationaly join?  If so, can somone send me 
info on it?


Lastly, ive been consindering the use of "Mesquete" wood chips in beer.  
Not smoking, but putting them in a hop bag in the boil.  When Im grilling 
during the summer, I have to soak the woodchips in water before putting 
them on the hot coals.  The water becomes very "aromatic" so Im thinking 
that in the boil, the aromatic sent and mesquete flavor will pass off 
into the boiling wort.  Ive never tasted the water after the wood chips 
have soaked in it, so I dont know what sort of flavor is passed on... Has 
anyone tried this?  Ive considered smoking grains, but after I found out 
whats involved, Ive decided that I want no part of it :-).  So  Will this 
work?
 
Welp, thats my 2 beers for today.  
Hoppy Brewing.

Subject: Freezing yeast




        Someone commented in today's hbd that they had trouble freezing 
yeast.  Yes, having a -70 freezer helps, but it can be done at home.  One 
trick is freezing the beasties quickly.  Most of us don't have access to 
liquid nitrogen for snap freezing, but try this:  place a bottle of 
alcohol (alcool, white lightning, strong vdka, whatever) in the freezer a 
few days ahead of time.  When you want to freeze the yeast, pour a little 
of the -18C alcohol into a small pan (also pre-chilled in the freezer), 
and immerse the vial of yeast-glycerine in the alcohol.  This will freeze 
the culture much more quickly than just placing it in the freezer to be 
air-cooled.  Fast freezing creates smaller ice crystals, which cause less 
damage to the yeast cells.  Some intrepid homebrewers might try dropping 
some dry ice pellets into iced 95% ethanol to cool it down even further, 
which will more closely approximate the freezing capacity of a -70 
freezer.  Once it's frozen storage at -18C shouldn't be a problem.

Subject: RE: Bottle Sources, PET and O2, Labels


BOTTLES
A friends father brews beer, and says a good source of returnable bar bottles
is the American Legion.  He claims they will sell you cases of them in the
heavy duty cardboard cases for the deposit value ($2.00 in Virginia).  I've
never actually tried this, though.  Another source would be local restaurants. 
Talk to the manager about non-twist top non-returnable bottles they through
out.  I would guess that an offer of a six pack of homebrew would help :). 
**********
PET AND O2
An experiment that could be done on PET bottles and permeability of O2 which
could answer some 'inquiring minds.'  Some volunteer with a "carbonator" or
such device, who has access to bottled O2 could fill a PET with O2 and let it
sit for a few months.  Might also require a pressure gauge, or a precision
scale, and basic knowledge of atmospheric gasses to determine if O2 has
diffused.  Just a thought.
**********
LABELS
I recently bought some AVERY Multi-Purpose Labels (standard disclaimer).  They
are 1/2" X 3/4", and fit nicely on bottle caps (no removal required besides
opening the bottle :).  I can create a 'beer label' table using my word
processor software, and by adjusting the font size, table spacing, and line
spacing create printed bottle labels that have the style, date bottled, grain
vs extract, ale vs lager, etc.  I simply peel them off and stick on the cap. 
The beer cap labels don't come off if they get wet (in a cooler for an outing,
etc.).  The only difficult part is creating the first table, and messing
around with font size, line spacing, etc.  Once completed, just use the search
and replace function to change the style, bottling date, etc.  I print the
table on a sheet of paper, use double sided stick tape and position and attach
the blank labels over the previous print, and re-feed the paper back through
my dot printer.  This may not be the best method, but I figure I have years to
brew :) and play around till I figure the 'perfect' method for me.

I have a solution to Harry's problem with splashing bleach.


Don't pour it.  I am similar to Harry in that I am an accident prone male 
who can spill any liquid I put in my hands (and I am a trained laboratory
scientist).  My way around the problem is to siphon the bleach solution 
out of the carboy.  This way, I let physics work for me, and I sanitize my

Subject: Harvesting Irish Moss




          This is in reply to Kevin Fons' question as to whether
          anyone grows their own Irish Moss.  I have been "harvesting"
          my own Irish Moss for several years now since it grows quite
          abundantly on the rocky coastline of New England.  Irish
          Moss ( or Chondrus crispus) is a "red" marine algae or
          seaweed that is found from New Jersey to Nova Scotia
          attached to rocks, shells, or wooden structures along the
          shoreline.  It probably grows along the Pacific NW too, but
          I'm not sure.  In appearance it is reddish-brown to purple
          in color and grows in dense, matted clumps.


          Individual tufts are about the size of a tennis ball or
          smaller.  You can pick it fresh or collect what washes up on
          the shore if it's in good condition.  I carefully clean,
          rinse, then air dry the plants before storing in a plastic
          container. I grin in a coffee mill before use.


          Given the price locally, I think I save about a dollar a
          batch!


          Hope this is useful.

TSP, and caustics are the cleaners of choice.  You need to make or buy
a dental mirror, so you can see inside the kegs.  Or, just cut the 
damn top off and make it an open fermenter.  You can use a wok lid as
a cover, or nothing at all.  I think you may want to consider something
more suited to a 1 BBl ferment than sankeys.  Depending on your lauter
tun design, it may be capable of doubling as a fermenter, provided
you have a SS tun.  Food grade trash cans are the cheapest solution.
You might consider having a simple cylinder made to ferment in.  Something
in the 2 feet diameter, 2 feet high, or slightly wider works well.  If
you have something made, think about a kegging port on the side, just 
up from the yeast.

This stage will pass!  Making a 1 BBl brewery is a big challenge and
sometimes a hassel, but its worth it when you are "done".  Of course,
breweries are never "done", you gotta tweek em all the time!  Good luck.


"Fleming, Kirk R., Capt" <FLEMINGKR`at`afmcfafb.fafb.af.mil> says:


<Here's a question regarding our plan form clarifying a brown ale batch
using isinglass..


<We currently have a 5gal and a 6 gal carboy each finishing up a ferment
<from a single 11 gal brown ale batch.  Our plan is to rack these both into
<a single 1/2 bbl keg with the recommended charge of liquid isinglass.
<We then propose to put an airlock on the keg (just in case) and cool
<from the current 64F to maybe 45F and hold there for about a week.


<Then, we propose to rack again into our dispensing keg and force
<carbonate there preparatory to...well, drinking.  The thinking here is as
<follows: cool to assist in precipitating out the junk, and rack again to
<avoid having so much sediment in our dispensing keg.


I think you are missing a few things.  First of all, a brown ale might
not need finings unless you plan on cask conditioning it, or just priming
in the keg.  If your plans are to rack to a secondary, then to a keg,
then force carbonate, why bother using isinglass at all?  If you have
a real sticky yeast that refuses to flocculate at all, maybe.  Also,
why the airlock in a unprimed keg?  The keg can withstand 60 PSI, and
i doubt you will make this much pressure in a secondary without priming.
Also, an airlock on a vessal that is reducing temp will cause the fluid
in the airlock to be sucked into the keg, not good!  My advise is to 
rack into a secondary if desired, add isinglass here if you have to, 
then rack into the dispensing kegs and force carb.  A better idea is 
to go stright from the primary to the corny kegs, add sugar and isinglass
and let it finish the secondary fermentation in the cask, ala cask 
conditioned ale!  To do this right, you need to cut 1/2" off the bottom
of the liquid dip tube, so the isinglass stays in the keg. Also, prime
with 1/2 the normal sugar amount.  


<We 'think' we detect a slight sulfur smell emanating from the
carboy airlocks--and I suspect autolysis->diacetyl


Why do you think this?  Sulpher is H2S.  If its still fermenting, I 
doubt you have an autolysis issue, this takes time.  Some yeasts 
throw a lot of sulphur.

Skip the kits.  Buy some domestic wheat extract, use it 1/2 and 1/2 
with Alexanders pale extract, 1/2 oz hallertau hops and the classic
liquid Weihenstephan Weizen yeast.  The yeast is a must, Wyeast and

This is quite true, but should not be followed blindly.  You must
first consider exactly the characteristics of your base malt, it is getting
near impossible to locate "undermodified malt" these days.  By doughing
in at this low temp, then adding heat to raise the mash temps, you will
spend a considerable amount of time in the optimum range for proteolytic
enzyme activity.  This is certainly beneficial for protein reduction, 
but protein reduction can be overdone, resulting in a beer with a poor
foam stand/head retention.  With some malts, it is better to adjust your
water using salts, lactic acid aor phosphoric acids, then dough in 
closer to 130 or 140F.  It all depends on what you are after, and the 
raw ingredients you use.  I believe that when Fix suggests using such
low temp rests, he is using a very thick dough in followed by boiling
water infusions to rapidly jump temps, minimizing the enzymatic activities
at certain temps so he can control the beers finished body.  I hope George
will correct me if Ive misstated his procedure.  It would seem that a 
combined method of using a thick dough in, boiling water infusions to
minimize the time spent in the proteolytic enzyme range, followed by
heat additions to rest in the beta amylase and alpha amylase zones would
be the best of both worlds.

My yeast microbiologist friends all tell me that an ordinary freezer
(-20C/0F) is worse than a simple slant in the fridge. Only a low temp
freezer will work, and that works extremely well, of course.


However, you do not need a deep freeze! A slant will keep yeast alive
for at least a year (Saccharomyces; I did lose a Schizosaccharomyces
pombe in a couple of weeks). I have some slants that are 2 1/2 years old
and are perfectly fine in the vegetable cooler of my fridge. One thing
that I have noticed repeatedly is that people seem to streak their yeast
on the surface of the agar slant. That's not the way to do it: *stab*
the agar with the inoculating needle, so that the inoculum grows inside
the agar plug. It's as simple as that; slants are even commonly called
"stabs" in bacteriology labs.

B-Brite is sodium "percarbonate", an oxygen bleach, and it is indeed an
excellent sanitizer and a reasonably good cleaner, especially to loosen
organic crud (the oxygen bubbles act as mini-scrubbers inside the crud).

Subject: 5l keg foaming problems


I just read a post which recommended that one should quickly push the 
handle down completely to get rid of the foam.  My experience has been to 
do the opposite.  This is my method for minimal foam (less than a glass)


1.  Make sure the keg has chilled for 24 hours or more.
2.  The initial tap should use the natural CO2 pressure in the keg.
3.  Tilt the glass as you pour into it.
4.  Most important, push the handle down until there is a tiny trickle into
    the glass.  What your are doing here, is gently reducing excess CO2 
    pressure.  This first glass might take a half minute to pour, but it
    is worth it.  It usually results in 1/3 foam, 2/3 beer, or a healthy
    head
5.  The next glass or two may or may not need the trickle beginnings.  You
    get so you can anticipate when it is safe to open the tap fully.
6.  This method has been very successful for me, and I can always fully 
    enjoy the FIRST glass out of the keg.


Hope this helps.

Hi,


Just a couple of questions for the experts...


1. I'm almost embarrassed to ask this, but... when sparging, do you want 
the water to be 170 F, or do you want the temp of the grist raised to 
170F ? I'm planning my first all-grain batch soon, and it seems like I'm 
more confused than ever! How important is it to have the correct PH 
sparge water?


2. Do I have to worry about my beer getting "lightstruck" while its 
sitting in the secondary waiting to be bottled? I keep reading how beer 
can be skunked "in a matter of seconds".


3. Do you guys actually chew on cardboard to see what it tastes like?! 
Also, does wet cardboard taste different than dry cardboard??! :*)

Subject: RIMS and Steam Injection


 Over the last few months I've been gathering concepts and materials to put 
 together my own RIMS system. The one concern I have with the design route 
 most people seem to take is the use of an electric heater in a chamber in 
 the recirculation path. The primary complaint with this method is 
 scorching of the mash. Even with a fairly high recirculation rate (which 
 could cause other problems like disturbing the grain bed and HSA) it seems 
 to me that a certain degree of scorching is inevitable anyways - 
 especially if the pump were to plug up.
 
 I've read about using direct steam injection for mash heating (the article 
 in Brewing Techniques). Has anyone had any experience using steam 
 injection, especially with a RIMS system? Does anyone see any apparent 
 reason that any one point in the recirculation path should be any better 
 (or worse) than another for the injection point (i.e. above the grain bed, 
 below the grain bed, in the grain bed, in the recirculation path)? Also, 
 any pointers on the use of steam in general would be appreciated?
 
 I plan to use a solenoid valve to regulate the steam flow for temperature 
 regulation and stepping.

Subject: Lucifer, cider, 2l bottle caps


Jon Mendrick asks about Lucifer and cider.


* Lucifer is a Belgian strong ale, a knock-off of Duvel, a world-classic
beer.  Lucifer and other beers of that sort are quite popular with
college kids in Brussels.  Most of these beers have names related to
Hades, since Duvel means "devil" (in Flemish, I think), and they tend to
be cheaper and of lower quality than Duvel.  I don't think I would brag
about Lucifer; I'd have a Duvel instead.


In any case, a Duvel-type recipe would certainly put you in the
ballpark.  I don't have any recipes off hand, but you want a strong pale
ale, using pale malt or extract with very little if any dark malt, OG of
1.065 give or take, continental noble hops like Saaz, and a relatively
neutral yeast (I'd try WYeast European).  Check out the Simon & Schuster
"Pocket Guide to Beer" for more specifics on Duvel.


* As for making cider, it's even easier than beer, although it takes longer:


1.  Buy unfiltered, no-preservative apple juice.  Preservatives will
    inhibit yeast growth.  If you have fresh-off-the-tree unpasteurized
    juice, you may want to add campden tablets (1-2 per gallon) to the
    juice and wait 24 hrs; this will eliminate any existing nasties.


2.  (Optional) Add sugar (doesn't matter what kind) to raise the gravity
    to 1.065-1.070.  The additional alcohol subsequently produced will
    help the keeping properties of the cider, although it will make it
    stronger and a bit dryer tasting.


3.  Pitch your favorite yeast.  Champagne or wine yeast will give you a
    dryer, more wine-like final product; ale yeast will give you a
    fuitier, sweeter final drink.  Experiment!


4.  Wait.  Although the fermentation may finish in just a few weeks,
    cider takes longer than beer to age and mellow.  I'd go a minimum of
    a month, and I've gone as long as 5 or 6 months.  You'll get a
    clearer cider if you rack off the sediment a time or two.


5.  Bottle.  Either bottle as-is for still cider, or add same amount of
    priming sugar as you would for beer if you want sparkling cider.


* 2l (PET) bottle caps:  just sanitize the white plastic caps that came
on the bottles and use them as-is.  Works fine.

I have been sanitizing my bottles by baking at about 250(F)

room temp before removing from the oven to bottle. I use only
12 oz returnable longnecks.


I have experienced several bottle failures in the first two
weeks after bottling as the pressure slowly increases. In no 
case has the beer been overprimed or under excess pressure. I 
have been using this method for 15-20 batches and have
experienced this problem only recently. Perhaps as bottles 
are treated repeatedly in this manner over time they become 
increasingly brittle.

Subject: Hefe weisse


I got back last week from spending 25 days roaming Europe and a friend
directed me to this fine mail-list.


At an inn in Schwangau (at the foot of Neuschwanstein castle) I was served a
Hefe weisse beer in a remarkably tall and well filled glass and it was some of
the finest [usual high endorsment].  I didn't pick up any name, or for perhaps
obvious reasons can't remember :)  However, a day later in Munchen (the monks)
I visited a brewpub/restaurant, a rather large one, named Augustiner and tried
their hefe weisse which had a really-not-quite-done raw flavor I've associated
with walking past the Anheiser-Busch brewery in Columbus, OH.  The better of
the two had a fairly mild rich flavor, white/yellow in color, and pretty well
clouded with yeast(?).


So impressed was I by this I've scampered into our local brew supply and
latched onto a rather larger than usual can of wort for a "weizen bier".
The proprietor informed me he believed a particular Bavarian yeast is required,
which should arrive this week.  Inspection of the recommended process suggests
a cup of wort is removed and stored (in the fridge) until 2-3 weeks after
fermentation begins, that is, just before bottling.  Adding the cup of wort
back into the fermenter.  Also involved is a process of skimming and transfering
between fermenters to remove sediments.  This seems to fit in with what someone
called "Strictest Standards of the German Purity Law for Beer".


I'm puzzled a bit by this because I've delved into the archive to find what I
could on this and discussion seems to revolve around an addition of yeast,
rather than wort, prior to bottling.  If anyone has any experience whatsoever
in the making of hefe weisse, I'd appreciate any pointers before I get into
this, I'd like to start brewing in a week or so, but am a little confused.


Thanks in advance,

Subject: Yeast culturing/PET caps


Dear Friends, we've had some less than enthusiastic descriptions of yeast
culturing around here lately, so I'll chime in--I think culturing yeast is
very easy, has lots of benefits, and takes virtually no extra time.  I
have a 10 K bit of text on the (gory) details of how I proceed for anyone
who is interested--email me for a copy.  There's no new info there; what I
know I learned by reading the yeast.faq, this digest, and some
rec.crafts.brewing postings.  In a nutshell, it is dead simple to make
slants, store them in your fridge till you wish to inoculate them, and
then store them there once they have a starter's worth of yeast cells.  It
is not absolutely necessary to be as totally antiseptic as the
formidable-sounding procedures outlined in the faq either, provided one is
content to work with pure cultures and is not isolating strains, for
example, from bottle-conditioned beer. In my experience it is totally
obvious when a slant "goes off", and if so, big deal--there are billions
more yeast cells where they came from.  I keep 6 strains at the moment,
and brew on average 3 or 4 times per month, so am quite content to keep my
slants for only 3 months before re-inoculating onto fresh culture medium
(new slants).  I reckon all this adds at most 45-90 minutes per month to
my brewing duties, and that is a drop in the ocean compared to the time
involved in making 3 or 4 batches. 


PET bottle caps: I use the same ones over and over.  Just soak them in the
same bleach solution used to sanitize the bottles and rinse.  Then just
screw it on firmly.  Note however that I use just one PET per batch to
monitor carbonation and clarity, and usually open it up soon after the
batch comes "on line", so can't add any first-hand experience to the
question of how long the beer will keep in them--but it is my bias that
they will last for a few months at least.
