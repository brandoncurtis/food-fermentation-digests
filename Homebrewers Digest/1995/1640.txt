Hi fellow HBD'ers (even those of us who are internet-challenged). 
Coming to you through my
brew buddy / dive buddy/  interpreter, here's a question:  Can anyone 
out there come up with a
good all-grain recipe for a true Czech Pilzener (i.e. Urquell) . Many 
recipes claim to be " just like "
the real thing but seem to be missing the very fine technical details 
that make it authentic.


Other than Papazian (got em both) or Miller is there a reference 
source for lager specialized
techniques ? I'm looking for details on decoction mashing, which malts 
require it, or if step-mash
is good enough, pro's con's etc.


Any help appreciated, (IMHO, YMMV, No affiliations, etc etc)

Subject: Rakes and iodophors


I forgot to answer the rakes question last week.


Rake'ing (or knifing) the lauter is merely using a long thin
device to cut verticle channels through the grain bed in the 
lauter tun.  I use the handle end of a long SS spoon.  I like
to cut in a pie shape pattern, be sure not to cut deep to the
filter bed, stay a few inches above this.  Lauter tuns have
rakes installed in the better breweries to do this, it helps
to remove the spent grains, lift overly compacted grain beds,
and keep hard to lauter beds from becoming stuck.

Interesting, Ive been using this stuff for a while now.  I do rinse.  It
is meant for sanitation of food prep surfaces.  I guess means little
as to FDA approved, but if you ask me, it had the same chemical 
composition as what is used in my local micro.  Id say use it.

<rest, or fining be a detriment to head retention?


A rest at 128F using pale ale malt will certainly make a clearer beer,
one that will not taste too good, either.  Finings like Isinglass, are
actually *foam positive*, ie, they increase the foam stand on a beer, 
really!  Polyclar will latch on to large proteins and settle them out,
if your beer has enough medium proteins, your foam will still be OK.
Have you tried real cold conditioning, for 2 weeks at 31F?  THis will
drop many beers clear.  BTW, isinglass drops yeast by a electrostatic
charge effect, followed by mass accretion, which causes sedimentation.
Polyclar drops proteins.  If you have a real vigorous boil and are 
careful in leaving the hot trub in the kettle, then protein haze using
pale ale malts is not a normal problem.


<I am wondering if my recirculation is not effective because of my shallow
grain bed depth in my lauter tun.  I use a ten gal. stainless pot w/ false
bottom.  My grain depth is about 6 inches for 10 lbs of grain.  What is the
optimal bed depth and what is the minimum?


This sounds OK, but it is shallow.  Should work fine.  You can always
mash more malt, making a barley wine and see if it works better.

Actually, pH is more important than temperature when it comes to minimizing
tannin extraction from the husks.  I've wondered about your first question
for quite some time.  Commonly, homebrewers usually use 170F sparge water
and ignore the temperature of the grain bed itself.  Then there's the radicals
like Jack Schmidling who question all perfectly good procedures.  Jack uses
boiling water and has measured his grain bed as being somewere just below
170F, if memory serves.  I still question if this is a good idea since all
the pros who I've asked, use 170F water.  When it comes to measureing pH,
you don't want to measure the pH of the sparge water (unless you are curious),
but rather the pH of the runnings and the mash.  You want to keep the mash
pH below 6.0 or so.  The mash pH will slowly rise if you keep adding water
(even distilled water), because you are draining away the stuff that brought
the pH down into the 5.2-5.7 range during the mash.  Check your mash pH
periodically during the sparge and acidify your sparge water if the pH begins
to approach 6.0.

Yes, you do have to keep it out of bright sunlight and/or fluorescent light.
It will take more than a few seconds, but depending on the strength of the
light, it could be a short as a few minutes.


>3. Do you guys actually chew on cardboard to see what it tastes like?! 
>Also, does wet cardboard taste different than dry cardboard??! :*)


Most of flavour is in the aroma.  We only taste sweet, salty, sour and bitter,
but coupled with the hundreds (thousands?) of aromas we can distinguish, we
can perceive many, many flavours.  The aroma of wet cardboard is quite familiar
and is indeed quite close to the smell of oxidized beer.  When I was teaching
my cousin how to judge beer, before I taught him the "wet cardboard" moniker,
he called it "the back of a liquor store" aroma.

$120 for CO2 tank, gauge, connectors, hoses and faucet (What most people,
incorrectly call a "tap" is actually a "faucet."  A "tap" is the connector
that plugs into a Sankey, Golden Gate or Hoff-Stevens keg.) is probably a
used CO2 tank already.  A new 5-pound CO2 tank will set you back at least
$80-90.  Plastic connectors are usually $4-6 each, hose is about $1/foot,
the faucet is about $4-6.  Stainless steel connectors will run about $10-12
each, if you would rather use them instead of the plastic ones.  A regulator
is about $30-40 new and I recommend going with a new one -- it's the most
important part of the system.  You can find used CO2 tanks occasionally at
fire extinguisher places, but make sure it has a recent certification (CO2
tanks must be certified (hydrotested) every 5 years or the refillers won't
touch them).  Finally, the one place you can save money in a kegging system
is to stick to a single-gauge regulator in place of a two-gauge one.  The
high pressure gauge will show between 700 and 800 psi (depending on the
temperature) until all the liquid CO2 in the tank turns to gas.  Then you've
only got maybe a dozen or so pints left before the tank runs out.  No,
weighing the tank is the way to tell how much is left.  A 5-pound tank will
last between 5 and 20 batches, depending on how much CO2 you use for
non-dispensing tasks like purging carboys, and will weigh *5 pounds* more
when it is full than when it is empty.  So, although you might be able to
get all the equipment for $100 if you shop around, you probably will only
save $10 once you add shipping and if something fails, it's probably better
if you bought it locally.

Rob,


I'm just starting Homebrewing and don't know what  Brew Clubs are in
the Chicagoland area. I'm in the Chicagoland area (N.W. Suburbs) and I
have a few friends that have been brewing for only a couple of years.
So none of us are "Brew gods" either. But I and they might be interested

Chicagoland subscribers of the HBD) about those clubs? And if you start
one about yours?

Subject: White Goobers in Suspension




Yesterday we brewed an English Ordinary (see p. 47, Victory Beer Recipes)
in which we used the recommended amt of Irish moss.  After pitching the
Wyeast 1028 (?) London ale yeast we pumped the beer into the fermenter.
After witnessing the incredible spectacle of huge flocs precipitating out to
form a 2" thick layer of sponge on the bottom, the beer appeared to be
quite free of suspended material.


Today, my associate called to report the beer is now a suspension of
"millions" of little stringy, gooey looking snow-white particles (we have
labeled them "goobers", for now), in a highly turgid state.  He says gas
emanating from the airlocks (two carboys) smells wonderfully like beer.


Given we used about 1/2 lb of wheat malt, the 1028 yeast, and the Irish
moss, does this bizarre phenomenon seem normal.  Are we getting rope?
We've brewed many times and imbibed much, but have yet to see this or
read about it..  Have we angered the Beer Gods?

Subject: Irish Moss Scientific Name


Jim Cave <CAVE`at`PASC.ORG> asks about the scientific name for Irish Moss used
in brewing.  


     The brown alga (Division Phaeophyta) typically used for homebrewing is
Chondrus crispus, a sessile form which attaches to rocks and other
substrates, generally in the intertidal zone (or below) by means of a
holdfast.  It is photosynthetic (chlorophylls a and c), and produces a
number of polysaccharides, among them carageenan which is used not only in
brewing but as an emuslifier in paint, processed ice cream, and in some pie
fillings (along with modified starches!).  The properties of the carrageenan
in solution assist in clarifying the beer by attracting and binding proteins
(and perhaps other haze causing molecules in solution/suspension), and
precipitating them with the hot/cold break.


    Other brown algae (and some red algae) are commonly used as food in many
oriental cultures (i.e 'nori'; one of my standard "in class" field trips
includes my bringing a bowl of hot and sour soup to class and picking out the
algae and eating it...  students never forget when they see the warped
professor doing this kind of thing..... Guess what subject gets brought up
when I talk about fungi and yeasts.....!! [unfortuately, no samples of this
in class!]).

Subject: Brew Problems -- infection?


Here's the problem.  Last two beers, one a Bass look-a-like, one
a Steam.  Both tasted OK going into the secondary.  Bass was
London Ale Yeast, steam was California Lager.  By bottling time,
both had pronounced diacetyl aroma and flavor.  Bass has been in
the bottle for around a month and a half and has mellowed a
little, but still has lots of butter, and some new problems,
including bubble-gum/fruity aromas, and a horrible bitterness
when aerated in the mouth.  Much to my surprise and dismay, the
Steam (bottled two days ago) had a very similar flavor profile,
although it is (as yet) less pronounced.  Both were fermented
around 68. Temp may have strayed into the low 70s, but I have a
tough time believing it was ever over 75.  Procedure was sound --
cooled wort quickly, lag time only 12-15 hours for both.


What's going on?! Infection?  I understand Pediococus (sp?) is
one of the only diacetyl producing infectors, but it is a lactic
acid bacteria, no?  I don't have any sourness that I would
associate with lactic acid.  The fact that Ped. kicks in late in
fermentations does fit my problem, however (both tasted good
originally).


Any thoughts?  If it is an infection, should I switch santizers (I've been 
using household bleach to date)?  What's good at erradicating Ped. (if 
that's what it is)?


Thanks,
John

The Sigma catalog lists several forms of carrageenan, the cheapest being
made from "various seaweeds" One family name listed is Gigartina sp. ,
which is used to make the lambda form. The iota form comes from Eucheuma
spinosa.


Give it a go with the local variety, Jim!


BTW, this might be the first time that Sigma prices come out inexpensive:
1 kg of (cat # C10130 Type1 carrageenan) is $72.60, or about $2.75 an ounce.


Oh, Sigma products are clearly labelled "Not for household use".

Subject: Re: Chipotle beer


Last year I made a truly amazing smoked beer from peated malt.  I split the
batch into three parts.  One of the three was allowed to ferment down from
the OG of about 1060 and made a nice smoky pale bock.  (Very smoky.)  The
second part I diluted before fermentation to an OG of 1042 to make an
ordinary smoked beer -- not too great.  The third part I also diluted
before fermentation -- I don't have my notes handy but I think the OG was
about 45 -- and added several dried chipotles to the secondary.  Wow!  The
smoke from the peated malt and the smoke from the chipotles complement each
other very well.  It's a little hotter than I like a chile beer to be (I
like them mild -- your mileage may vary), but not at all undrinkable by
itself.  Of course, like all chile beers, it's wonderful with hamburgers.
The detailed recipe should be in my brewing notes; if there is any demand
for it I can post it.

Living in Asia one finds mail order is the only way to go sometimes. A 
good place to get chipotle chile pods and many other chiles and spices
is PENDERY'S 1-800-533-1870 or 1221 Manufacturing, Dallas TX 75207.
A 4 oz. package costs $4.35 and is over 50 pods so one package will
go a long ways.  Since I can't brew beer here, against the law, I only
use them for cooking. As the catalog states "Whole jalapeno, snoke dried 
with heavenly aroma and marvelous flavor. Add warmth to chiles, stews 
and in cream soups". Chop one up and add it to a pot of rice and even
people that say they don't like rice will ask for seconds.
Give Pendery's a call and get their catalog, reading it is an education
about chiles and spices.

I have done several upward infusions using the Lewis American malt "Lo-Hi"
sacchrification rests with great success.  In result, not in convenience.  I
add a 120F protein rest since I typically use 1lb of wheat malt in at 10lb
grain bill.  I use a Gott 48 w/copper manifold mash/lauter tun.  Upward
infusion is tough since even with a thick starter mash (0.75qt/lb) you wind
up with a huge volume of liquid.  Regardless of the chemical implication of
the thinness of the final step the thermal intertia of this volume makes
getting to mash-out or even to the final sugar rest a pain.  Increasing
volumes of boiling water are required.  Cold air temps complicate things
further. I brewed outdoors yesterday with 34F ambient and I ran out of
cooler volume and had to transfer everything to the kettle and apply heat to
get to the final rest and mash-out.


Conclusions:   Limit upward infusions to situations with 60F+ air temps.
Avoid more than two steps, in any case.  I plan to build one of them thar'
pressure cooker steam generator to allow heat application inside my Gott cooler.

Subject: Acquiring Irish Moss


I've been reading the recent thread on Irish Moss (growing your own, 
harvesting your own, harvesting a substitute species) and am surprised at 
some of the reported prices being paid for this stuff.  For example, 
Kendall Coolidge writes (#1637):


> Given the price locally, I think I save about a dollar a

and Jim Cave writes (#1638):


> ... At $4 an ounce, it may be economically viable!


Assuming that Kendall brews five gallon batches, and that Jim isn't 
confusing Irish Moss with something illicit, I'd have to say that these 
prices are rather steep.


Here's something that might help.  I've been purchasing Irish Moss from 
William's Brewing for a while now and their price is currently set at 
$3.50 per 4 oz. bag (price good through February 28, 1995).  Call 
800-759-6025 for orders and catalog requests.

Subject: Bitter is not better


I seem to remember reading about a problem with unusually bitter brew here a
while ago, but didn't think much about it at the time 'cuz I had never
experienced it myself.  Well guess what!  I just tried my first all grain
batch after 2 weeks in the bottle and there is an *extremely* bitter-like
taste that I have not experienced before.  No real flavor to the bitterness -
just extreme harshness that lingered (or rather latched!) on long after I
threw away the remaining contents of my glass.  I was making a steam-type
(California Common) *ale* with Kolsch yeast (#2565) that started out at 1.043
and finished at 1.011.  A total of 1.75 oz. of Northern Brewer was spread
throughout the 60 min. boil with 1 oz. of Cascade tossed in for the final 5
min.  Also the head is pretty thin and big-bubbly.


Now I really don't know what flavor profile is referred to by the common
references to *wet cardboard* but could this be it?  Anybody else experience
this problem or is it simply part of the initiation rites for the first-time
all-grain brewer?


Now if I could only find a piece of cardboard . . .

Well, it will get warm sitting in the hose for a long time, plus look at 
all that WASTED beer!  Unless you are using VERY THIN hose, you are going

Im curious what the insurance companies actualy would think.  Considering 
that there is really no crime or stipulation in most insurance policies 
for modification of hosehold items.  I would imagine that this would come 
down to whether or not you were negligant.  IMHO the insurance companies 
would have a hard time proving this if you were that advanced enough of a 
brewer to be using these techniques.  However, given that you should have 
enough brains to keep accidents like that from happening anyhow.

I have found in my experience that Chicago Indoor is overpriced in alot 
of things.  The Brewers Coop in naperville has better prices on alot of 
hardware, were as CIGS has cheaper prices on grain, yeast, etc. . .  I 
shop at both stores.  Heres  A small price comparason on a few things.

Zeek, let me know who it was that told you that as my brewing buddy

Mikroklene was designed for food service applications, and is FDA

at 12.5 ppm.  


>From trade literature:


"When used as directed, MIKROKLENE complies with FDA Food Additive

rinsed from food contact surfaces."


and:


EPA Reg. No. 1677-22


I did find out why the phosphoric acid (which is food grade).  Also 
from trade lit:


"MIKROKLENE is stable in storage.  It is buffered against alkaline 
water supplies.  At a concentration of 12.5 ppm titratable iodine, 
MIKROKLENE has been tested and shown to be an efective sanitizer up

Also for those who wonder if they can re-use the solution:


"MICROKLENE has a built in germicidal indicator; germicidal 
effectiveness remains as long as the amber color of the solution is 
present."

Howdy,


I'm a relatively new homebrewer 
(I've shared in production of about a dozen batches)
and I have a general sanitizing question.
I've always used sulphites of sodium for sanitizing
everything (because the person that I brewed with
used it). It smells really toxic, but rinses right away.
Lots of books/posts/... say bleach is
a popular choice. However, I find that the bleach smell
is really hard to get rid of, and I don't want my beer 
smelling or tasting like the neighborhood swimming
pool. Should continue to use sulphites (which are 
certainly more expensive, but not prohibitively so)
or am I worrying about nothing? Is there any difference
in their effectiveness? We have never had any problems
with spoiling (except of course when my partner left the beer
in an unsealed primary fermenter for 6 weeks....)

Kirk asks:


<What is the distinction (for American amateurs) between
cask conditioning and priming in the keg?  The terms seem
to be synonymous as I've seen them used.


Mostly in the degree of carbonation/volumes of CO2 in solution.
Most homebrewers who keg prime use about 1/2-3/4 cup of some
type of fermentables to achieve the 2-2.5 volumes of gas that
many like in a fizzy ale.  In cask ales, the numbers are closer 
to 1.3-1.5 volumes, and I use about 1/4 cup of ordinary table
sugar.  Another distinction is the use of cask hops.  I like to
add between 1/4 and 1 oz of hops to the cask at kegging time,
along with the sugar and a dose of isinglass.  The isinglass 
ensures a clear pint.  Another major difference between cask
ales is that most traditional cask ales are quite low in alcohol
compared to our ales.  Ordinary bitter is only 3-4% ABV.  This,
when combined with a real beer engine results in a poundable
session beer.  It is important to vent the cask prior to dispense,
since beer engines push the ale through a sparkler, and if too
much CO2 is dissolved, all you get is foam.  


Its great to see that more brewpubs are istalling engines!

Subject:       RE: Yeast question??


In HOMEBREW Digest #1639, Todd S. Taylor asked about adverse effects 
of drastic temperature changes to yeast and also if there is a 
formula for mixing two different temperatures of water and predicting 
the final temp.


To the first question:  If you activate the yeast in a cup at 100F 
and then dump them in a the primary fermentor at 55F, I think two 
adverse things could happen.  One, the drastic temp. change will 
shock the yeast.  Two, the final temp. of 55F is too cold.  Even for 
lager yeast which ferments at about 55F, you want to start it out at 
about 65F to get the yeast started well.  Remember, one of your best 
defenses against baceria infecting your beer (second only to 
sanitation) is to give the yeast a huge head start.  I would try to 
activate my yeast at about 80 to 90F and pitch them into a wort which 
is about 75 to 80F, then let this cool down to the proper temp.  
Shocking your yeast and then starting them at 55F gives other 
organisms an extra edge on the yeast.


To the second question:  It is simply a matter of simple algebra (for 
a good estimation).  If you mix A gallons of wort at X temp. with B 
gallons of water at Y temp. then the resultant temp will be 
(approximately)  (AX+BY) / (A+B).  For example, say you boil 3 
gallons of wort that your going to mix with 2 gallons of tap water at 
a known 50F and you want to pitch the yeast in the final 5 gallons at 
80F.  What do you need to cool your wort down to?


(3X+2(50)) / 5 = 80   so X=100F


While this is an estimation (the difference in the density of wort to 
tap water changes things a little) it is a good one.

Subject: Sourdough, beer and lambic


(From *Jeff* Renner)


A note on brewing and sourdough, from a brewer and baker.


A week ago or so, Dave Sanderson said:


>I have a wild yeast that was captured in Alaska 100 years <snip> has
>anyone tried a wild "sourdough" yeast for brewing? 


Actually, Dave, what you have is not *a* wild yeast but a mixed culture of
yeasts and bacteria, especially Lactobacillus spp. and Acetobacter spp. 
Almost certainly it is not the same mix as Sourdough Jack was given years
back, or even what you got 15 years ago.  Every time you add flour, you
are also adding a huge innoculum of yeast and bacteria spores that are
present in the flour. Furthermore, the resident microflora in your locale
also develop. Back in the 70's, I read two seminal dissertations on San
Francisco sour dough (written at UC Davis).  In one of them, a new
bacteria was described, Lactobacillus sanfrancisco, as being present in SF
sour dough, as well as a wild yeast and other critters.  These were
synergistic.  A commercial aim of the research was to propagate this for
use in other areas, but it was discovered that local microflora always
displaced the SF in a short time. Three years ago or so, another local
baker friend of mine visited Poilane in Paris (see Jan.,1995 Smithsonian
Magazine cover article) and brought back their starter, which he shared
with me.  The first batch or two was absolutely Parisian, but this
changed.  It is still the best starter I've ever had, but it is now "Ann
Arbor sour dough."  It is still typically French in that it is not very
sour, as opposed to SF. 


Back to the original question.  Sour dough beer would probably be a
pseudo-lambic of sorts.  To turn things around, how about bread from a
lambic? Dan McConnell sent several sterile wort samples with a friend who
was visiting Brussels last winter.  He exposed these to the night air and
brought them back. Dan grew them up and plated them out, and has shared
them with some brewers who have made p-lambics from them.  One of them,
Eric Urquhart at Simon Fraser University in BC, also baked with this
starter.  The dough took a long time to rise, however, so in e-mail
correspondence I suggested to him that he use dechlorinated water.  This
doubled the dough activity.  It has been my experience that when I share
my starter with students on city (chlorinated) water, the starter poops
out in several generations.  This may have ramifications for p-lambic
brewers, and perhaps brewers in general. 


As a sour dough starter works out, it separates, and the old timers called
the sour, alcoholic liquid on top "hooch," often the only alcohol, however
nasty, they had out in the desert.  A favorite story of mine, which I
always tell my bread students during the sour dough session: 


It seems a weary traveler across the Great American Desert a hundred years
ago spotted a campfire at dusk, and, eager for human companionship, headed
for it, reaching it just at dark.  It was an old sour dough prospector,
who likewise welcomed the company.  He invited the traveler for dinner,
saying he'd just stir some more flour into the biscuit dough.  After
supper, the prospector got out his starter and poured off the hooch into
an old, battered tin cup.  He passed it across to the traveler, saying,
"Have a snort."  The traveler declined, whereupon the sour dough pulled
out his Winchester, cocked it and said, "When I offer a man a drink, he
dang well takes a drink!"  The traveler choked down the vile liquid, and
the prospector uncocked the rifle, slid it butt first over to the
traveler, and said, "Now you hold the rifle on me and make me take a
drink!"

Subject: Hydrometers, oven sterilizing bottles, HSA during boil?


>From *Jeff* Renner


About calibrating hydrometers.  The accuracy of many of these is
abominable, but they are generally precise.  I imagine the problem is
getting the paper scale placed accurately in the glass tube.  The last
time I bought one (I break them about every two years), I took my sampling
tube and thermometer and tested a bunch with 60^F tap water.  (Tap water
is low enough in dissolved solids to be sufficiently close to 1.000, I
checked when I got home).  One read 1.008!  Many read in the 1.003 - 5
range.  Strangely, out of about ten, only one read low - .998.  It took
about ten until I found one that read 1.000.  I spoke to the importer, and
he said that getting ones that were more accurate cost more than it was
worth.  I imagine that they just absorb the cost of returned ones.  So
test and return, or add the correction.  If the paper scale is correct,
the correction factor should apply across the range. 


***
About oven sterilizing bottles.  If they are cooled too quickly, they will
be weakened.  The trick is to let them cool over many hours, as is done in
the manufacturing process.  This is easy for me - I have a commercial
pizza oven with four inches of insulation on the walls and bottom and
eight on the top, and with a two inch thick stone hearth.  It will easily
hold three cases of 16 oz. longnecks.  I heat it to ~250^F (someone posted
that they use 350^ - this is unnecessarily hot) and turn it off to cool
overnight.  They are still warm the next morning.  This could be done in a
home oven by reducing the temp every hour or so.  Overnight is probably
overkill. 


***
Jerry Nelson asks why HSA isn't a problem during vigorous boil.  The
rising bubbles, I assume you know, are steam, not air, and even though the
wort is constantly being exposed to the space above the wort surface, this

Is there an archive site on the net where I can find the latest release
of Suds for Windows or is it only available through Compuserve?  Also, has 
anyone used any brewing packages they like better than Suds?


E-mail is fine, and I'd be happy to post a summary.


Many thanks

Nope.  Points * Gals / lbs: 52 * 10 / 17 = 30.6


Why is it the same number?  Because of your factor of 100: 100 / 10 = 10.

But the answer is NOT in percent, it's in "point-gallons/lb"


Just for the fun of it, let me justify my equation.  The "points" in
your SG says that you have a certain amount of sugar dissolved *per
volume* of liquid.  Multiplying by the volume (10 gallons) gives the
total amount of dissolved sugar.  Dividing by the weight of grains
gives the amount of sugar you've extracted from each pound of grain.
