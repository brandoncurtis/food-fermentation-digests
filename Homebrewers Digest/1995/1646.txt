In HBD#1643, Kevin complains that his Original Gravities are coming 
out lower than what the recipie calls for, despite the use of extra 
malt grains.


The first thing I would check for is a poorly calibrated hydrometer.  
>From other comments I have read in HBD, I get the feeling that there 
are more incorrectly calibrated hydrometers than there are good ones.
Put your hydromoter in tap water (or DDI if you can get it) and 
measure.  After adjusting for temp., it should read 1.000.  If it 
reads 0.090 then you need to add 0.010 to all future reading of your 
wort.


Something else you might try is rinsing (sparging) your grain bag and 
putting the rinsate in the wort kettle.  If you are simply throwing 
away the grain bag without rinsing it first, you are throwing away a 
lot of fermentables.

There are several shops in the city, "Home Sweet Homebrew" is one I've 
heard about.  For those of us who don't go into the city limits very 
often, I recommend Keystone Homebrew in Montgomeryville.  Their number 
is 641-4677, they do a lot of business so stock turns over fairly 
quickly, have good prices, and nice people.  Usual disclaimer, I don't 
work for them, etc., although they do get a lot of my money.


I would strongly recommend against Ambler Woodstove.  Details if anyone 
is interested via email.

I am curious as to what other answers will come from this, but here is what I
suspect would happen:


The Yeast will still ferment (They just might not be able to completely
out-compete the other organism. At worst this would add nasty off flavors.
However, as alcohol is produced, the dangerous organism would be killed off due
to the increase in acidity. End of problem.  I don't think there is any
pediococcus that could out compete a reasonable culture of yeast to the point
that know alcohol would get made...


Also note, many pediococci kill themselves off!  They reproduce for a while,
lowereing the pH of the media at the same time, and eventually die due to the
acidity they produce!

I would like to find some iodine concentration test strips which will
measure in range of 30ppm on down to 0ppm.  I will be testing Iodophor
solution for total dissolved iodine to determine what storage methods
will prolong its life.  In talking with a representative of EcoLab who
makes sanitizers, he mentioned that neither iodophor nor quatenary
sanitizers can be evaluated for their effectiveness based on the color
of the solution.  Bet most of you, too, were under the false
assumption that if it was still orange, it would sanitize, well I have
learned that is false information and I want to find out what is
accurate information.

Flame me if I'm wrong, but...


I believe the reason homebrewers first started using this measure is that it
makes more sense. Theoretical extract is NOT a measure of efficiency. It is a
measure of...theoretical extract. The "homebrewer's" definition of efficiency
is just that: it is the efficiency of the mashing/lautering process, or the
percentage of theoretical extract in the mash that can be extracted using
a particular mashing/lautering system. This efficiency is valid regardless of 
the grain bill, and can be used to estimate OG with a fairly high degree of 
accuracy. Actual extract is only useful when comparing two batches of beer 
made with the same grain bill.


For example, if you make a beer with only Belgian Pale Malt in it, you will
get a very high extract in terms of Pts*gal/lb. This number is then useless
if you try to duplicate the gravity of the beer but only have U.S. 2-row on
hand. But you can use the "homebrewer's" efficiency of the process to 
calculate the required amount of grain. Of course, there are other 
considerations like color, etc. but when trying different recipes or using
recipes out of the Cat's Meow it is much more valuable to know the efficiency
of your process than to know how many Pt*gal/lb you got out of your last
batch.


If commercial brewers use the term efficiency to describe extract, I'm not
sure what they are describing the efficiency of. How would you use that in a
sentence? "British Pale malt is much more efficient than Chocolate malt..." ?

Pierre Rajotte strongly suggested doing this for all high-gravity
ales, in his talk at the Spirit of Belgium.  The reason is that in
order to carbonate high-gravity beers, it is best to pitch fresh yeast
(of the same strain as the fermentation yeast) at bottling time
(called "repitching" in the Belgian brewing lexicon).  If you add
priming sugar to an incompletely fermented beer and then add fresh
yeast, you've got a formula for overconditioning, and potential bottle
bombs.  


If you do a FFT, then you will know how much fermentable sugar is
still left in the "finished" beer at bottling time.  Roughly, the %
sugar is [FG(beer) - FG(FFT)] / 4.  In an earlier post, I derived the
approximate relation 
        Vol(CO2) = % sugar * 2.5
or
        Vol(CO2) = (FG diff) / 1.6


Say you want 2 volumes of CO2 in your finished beer, then if your FG
difference is more than 3.2, you've already got more than enough sugar
to fully carbonate your beer (and you might want to consider waiting a
bit longer before botting!)  If the FG difference is less than that,
you should add sugar as appropriate to make it up, at the rate of 
2.5 grams/liter (1/3 oz per US gallon) per SG point.

     I'd like to offer a comment on Scott Howe's missive about A-B's
     bottles.  I've had a relatively good experience using A-B returnable
     "bar" bottles.  They're relatively heavy (usually with lots of
     abrasions on the outside from being refilled numerous times) and
     stand up well to capping.  In fact, I've only had one neck snap
     during capping, and I've never had one blow out.  I suspect the
     breakage may have resulted in part from the use of a hand capper
     with excessive downward pressure on my part.  I also like "bar"
     bottles because they come in those great heavy cardboard flip-top
     cases.  They're not easy to find; I've had the best luck in large
     liquor stores.

Mashing with Oats - Special considerations?
Kirk Harralson was asking if oatmeal will cause a stuck sparge. I just brewed
an oatmeal stout,
grain bill:


11 lbs of 2 row
 .25 lbs roasted barley
 .50 chocolate malt
1 lbs crystal malt
1 lbs Cara-Pils malt
and threw in 1 lbs of rolled Quaker Oats and mashed an sparged as usual.
No problems!!  Never knew it was there.
I used 1-1/2 oz of fuggles for bittering and 1/2 oz fuggles for finish
Trying for Samual Smiths but fell a little short. Needed more body, so next
time I'll add more Oatmeal (I'd guess 1/2 lb. or so) and more
finishing/flavor hopping.(lacked in flavor)

In HBD #1644 Pat Babcock (aka Brewbeerd) talks about building a jockey box
with the following equipment:


>To cool your beer without a fridge, get the following:

>6' x 1/4" ID food grade vinyl hose
>1 Cornelius Outlet fitting

>4 small diameter hose clamps
>Extra 5 gal bucket


I was thinking about building one in a small lunch cooler with copper tubing,
 but the guy at one of the HB supply stores (FH Steinbart in Portland OR)
said not to use copper with finished beer, I'm guessing due to the acidity of
the finished product. He said to use SS or plastic.  I'm curious if this info
is correct or not.  The stainless tubing would run in the neighborhood of
$35-$40 alone (a little more than I want to spent)  Plastic tubing seems to
be to much of an insulator to work very well for this purpose.  So, do you
all have any thoughts?

  I have just recently set up a CO2/Corny keg system and I
bought some 1/4" light blue/clear/reinforced tubing at
Home Depot. The tubing has a pretty strong plastic smell.
Can this influence the smell and or taste of my kegged
beer ? I have not dispensed anything yet but I will be
ready this weekend. I am only using this tubing for the
CO2 lines.

Here's another datapoint:  


My Glatt mill is now powered by a 30 in-lb gear motor that turns at 156 RPM. 
Power transfer from the gear motor PTO to the mill is through a split
coupling.  A direct drive arrangement such as this is very compact, and
avoids the hazard of a belt and pulleys.  


It will start from zero-speed with no hesitation, even if the hopper is full
of malted barley or the slightly-more-taxing malted wheat.  I suspect,
however, that the capacitor start-capacitor run induction motor I have is
capable of starting torques greater than its 30 in-lb continuous rating.  I
have not tried un-malted wheat, but my ol' KitchenAid Flour mill is just made
for that.  I also know of a Listermann Philmill which has been motorized
using the same gear motor and direct drive.  


Now, 150 rpm is not all that fast, but it's still more than twice what I
would call a normal sustained hand-crank pace.  The through-put of my Glatt
depends somewhat on the gap setting, and is typically 1.2 to 1.5 pounds per
minute.  Interestingly, measurements taken at slow speeds, cranked by hand,
would have predicted as much as 1.8 lb/min at 156 RPM, so there is a
noticable reduction of through-put with increased cranking speed.

The beer is a standard ale recipe which was supposed to produce 5 gallons.
When I racked it to my secondary I screwed up a bit on the siphoning and
lost a few quarts.  When I bottled it I slightly lowered the amount of
priming sugar (from 3/4 cup to 5/8 cup) to compensate for the decrease in
volume.  Did I lower the priming level too much?

Subject: OG influences preferred fermentation temp?


Greetings, All:


This is my first post to the HBD, so please be gentle.  I'm a bit
puzzled about a batch I just bottled, perhaps someone can shed some
light on the situation.  My OG was 1.072, and at bottling time my brew
had only reached 1.032 (5.2% ABV, 54% apparent attenuation).  Here are
the relevant details:


    7 lb Laaglander DME
    1 lb honey
    1/4 lb Crystal 80
    Wyeast 1007, pitched from a 1.050 starter and aerated vigorously
    5 days in the primary at 60-64F, visible ferm. slowed at day 4
    5 days in secondary, 55-57F (no visible fermentation)


My understanding was that Wyeast 1007 had an optimal fermentation temp.
of 62F. There were no extreme temperature fluctuations during the
primary, and I had only a 9 hour lag time with a good vigorous
fermentation for 3 days, followed by a sudden dropoff.  I discussed
this with the supply shop where I bought my ingredients, and was told
that most labs test their yeast strains at around 1.048, and that
higher gravity worts require higher temperatures (65-70F).  Does anyone
else's experience confirm this?  They also felt that I didn't allow
enough contact time with the yeast in the primary: 7-10 days was
recommended, so that may be a contributing factor.


I've also seen a few posts on r.c.b. mentioning that Laaglander had a
high percentage of unfermentables.  I've done a previous batch with this
extract, and not been too happy with it, either.  Is this a brand not
generally held in high regard, or are my problems from another source?
Any clues are much appreciated.


Until next time,
Phil

I think that your assumptions about RIMS are basically true.  However,
I think that you might not have such a good background in control
theory.  Briefly, there are several ways to do something like
temperature control, among them are (this is not comprehensive, nor am
I an expert on control theory) -- 


* "Bang-bang" control -- actual temperature is below desired
temperature, so turn on heating element until actual temperature
reaches desired temperature.  In a RIMS system, this can have dire
consequences, since there's a pretty substantial lag time between the
time the heated fluid re-enters the mash-tun, and the time that the
runoff from the mash reaches the desired temperature.  This will
likely cause some amount over temperature overshoot.


*  PD/PID control -- I would suggest that you read up on PD
(Proportional Derivative) and PID (Proportional Integral/Derivative)
control methods and try to implement either system for your class.
Basically, these kinds of controllers try to "learn" some data about
how the system reacts to the efforts at control.  It does this by
modelling a function of something like [length of time that element is
on] by [actual temperature change realized].  In this way, it almost
completely avoids overshoot.


*  AI techniques -- you can take PD/PID control one step further and
try to use established Artificial Intelligence techniques to learn
exactly what changes will occur in the system given a certain action.
Reading any decent AI textbook (Luger and Stubblefield is my favorite)
will give you some ideas.

Subject: MALT gelatinization?




Regarding the recent discussion of the need for a protein rest <140F when 
barley MALT doesn't gelatinize until 149F. Malted grains do not require 
gelatinization. The malting processing eliminates this need. Unmalted 
grains require gelatinization. Performing a protein rest on a grist 
containing unmalted grain is perhaps of marginal benefit. The standard 
practice for handling unmalted grains is to cook (gelatinize) them 
separate, then add them to the main grist. (This is, in effect, what you 
do when you use rolled (cooked, gelatinized) oats.)


A protein rest of malted barley can increase extract efficiency and beer 
clarity. Gelatinization is not relevant to malted grain.

Good question Greg.  The kit will produce a relatively low hop

of bitterness may be just right for say a Pete's like American Brown.


If you add a half an ounce at 10-15 minutes, you will get some more

and boil time) so that might be that way to go.

     I decided to try the yeast propogation method described in Charlie

     Two broke on the spot. Three others developed cracks which seeped the

     to keep things sterile. So, what is a good method of doing this?
     
     Charlie also has some nice pictures of flaming the lips of the bottles

<Malt at 122 deg is not gelatinized so I don't see how the protein

<in the mash


You are missing a fundamental distinction in mashing, the difference
between protein rests and saccharification rests.  Protein rests are
accomplished by the action of proteolytic enzymes whereas sacch. is
dependent on the action of beta and alpha amylases on starch.  For
starch to convert, it must first be gelatinized.  This is not required
for proteolytic action in the mash.  With respect to the degree of
protein modification in the malting and mashing process, DeClerck
states that the ratio of protein modification is roughly 1:1, 
malting:mashing.  In highly modified UK malts, it tilts to 1:.06 in 
favor of the malting stage.

First, thanks to A.J. deLange for a good explanation of just what is going

Second, my low-tech solution to two of the problems pointed out by AJ:
Temperature, and dangerous electrolytes.  I made a small sample cell by
soldering an end cap onto a 2" section of 1/2" diameter copper tube.  When
I go to measure pH, I scoop out a sample of wort with the copper sampler,
and immerse it in a coffee cup full of ice-water for about 5-10 seconds.
This quickly cools it to room temp, and I can take an accurate pH reading
without worrying about any temperature corrections for, or damage to, the
meter (although you still may need to subtract a few tenths of a point if
you want the wort pH _at mash temp_, as AJ points out).  I then discard the
sample, so I don't worry about contaminating the mash.

Subject: FermTemp


I've got a brew fridge which I keep in my garage for fermenting and
keeping kegs cold.  Since I live in Minnesota (Land of the Lost
Ice Ages), I actually need to HEAT the fridge for some 5-6 months
out of the year.  I heat the fridge using a 20 watt light bulb wrapped
in aluminum foil.


I used to use a Hunter temperature controller.  When the weather turned
cold, I simply ran the light bulb all the time and let the Hunter
control the fridge to bring the temperature down to the proper setting.
I didn't like this set-up because it's energy wasteful.  (I would
shudder every time I'd hear the compressor kick on to cool the fridge
to 45 F even though the ambient temperature in the garage was -10 F...)


I considered buying a heating/cooling remote bulb thermostat.
W. W. Grainger, Inc has one in their catalog (Item 4E047) made by Penn,
Model A19ABC-24.  It's advertised as a SPDT unit rated for 16A at 120V,
with an 8 ft capillary length.  Temperature range = -30 - 100 with and
adjustable differential between 3-12 F (the measure of how sensative
the unit is to a change in temperature).  Grainger price = $44.65.
The only downside is that you'd have to wire the unit yourself, but
this is really very simple to do.


The reason I didn't buy this is that with the unit, you really can't
plug both the heater and the fridge in at the same time.  I spoke to
an electrician and from what he said, one side of the control loop
will be closed at all times.  That means that either the fridge or
the light bulb will be running at all times.  The unit will control
the temperature like it's supposed to, but the fridge and the light
bulb end up fighting each other so they will be constantly cycling.


Now the way around this is to unplug fridge during the winter and
the heater during the summer.  The only problem I saw was during the
spring and fall when sometimes the ambient would be warmer than
thermostat setting and sometimes cooler.  During those times, you'ld
have to watch the ambient temperature closely and plug in the appropriate
device.  This was more hassle than I wanted.


Around this time, the Ferm Temp was offered by the Brewer's Resource.
The Ferm Temp is a nice little controller with a digital read out to
set and display the temperature.  Also, it has two outlets marked heat
and cool to plug in your light bulb (heat source) and fridge respectively.
The price was about double the Penn unit though.  I called up the BR
and asked them specifically if both the heater and fridge could be
plugged in at the same time.  The guy on the phone assured me that they
could.  He was quite clear on this.  "Just plug the light bulb in the
outlet marked HEAT, the fridge in the outlet marked COOL, set the desired
temperature and never worry about it again."


Based on this recommendation, I ordered one.  After waiting several
months, I finally got one.  Well, the instructions tell a different story.
According to the printed instructions, you can't plug both the heater
and the fridge in at the same time cuz they will cycle endlessly and
fight against each other.


Needless to say, I was more than annoyed.


Moral of the story:  If you don't need the fancy digital display, can
accept a differential of 3F (I think the Ferm Temp is 1F), and aren't
afraid of a very simple wiring job, buy the Penn unit from Grainger
and save yourself $40.


Grainger is located every state as far as I can tell.  You can
reach them toll free at 1-800-323-0620.


Disclaimer:  I've got no interest in Grainger; I'm not even a satisfied
customer since I bought the damn Ferm Temp instead of the Penn.  I don't
know nuthin' 'bout 'lectronics, and maybe the Penn unit don't do what I
think it do.

     The connection on the "water in" side of my immersion chiller is 
     simply a hose clamp that tightens and, in a perfect world, seals the

     run the water at more than a trickle, it leaks.  I have tightened the 
     clamp with no success.  The flow through the chiller coils (standard

     could be.  It looked really hoky, but it isn't exactly my field of

I use the percolation method, and would recommend it for two reasons.  First,
the heat transfer is much more efficient bubbling steam into the mash than it
would be with heat transfer through the copper pipe.  You want the steam to
actually condense in the mash to give up its vaporization energy.  Second, I
would be concerned about the safety aspects of having an open steam pipe
venting into my kitchen while I brew.

Hello,


I am about to introduce a friend to the wonders of brewing.  Leaving the
what to brew decision up to him, he decided he likes Weizen beers.  I
was wondering if any of you out there had a good weizen recipe.  I would
like to keep it mostly extract (if possible) to keep it simple for my
friend, but also something to keep me interested. Get the picture? Any
input is appreciated.


Thanks
 -John
