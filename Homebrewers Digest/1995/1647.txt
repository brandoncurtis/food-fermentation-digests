Subject: Tumbleweed is alive and well


Greetings one and all,


First off, I miss not contributing as much to the HBD as I have in the
past.  It seems all I have time to do is skim the discussions for new
information.  The HBD remains the single most important venue for
discussing brewing related matters and we should all be proud of it.


I guess I couldn't help notice mention of Tumblweed and my part in that
rather interesting play.  So here's a short follow-up.


Tumbleweed is doing well.  We are now producing around 6 bbls of beer per
week, up from barely 1 bbl. when I took over.  No.  We're not getting rich
but we are making money.  And the publicity for the restaurant has been
nothing short of overwhelming for a small 80 seat restaurant in a town of
12000 people.  We've been on TV twice, had articles written on us in two
regional slick magazines, the good folks at Southern Drafts did us the
honor of a cover story as did the Johnson City Press (in their Sunday
edition, no less!) and the Winston-Salem journal featured us in a big story
on brewpubs in NC.  That story hit the AP wire and was reprinted in over a
dozen newspapers in the Southeast.


Not bad.


As I mentioned about a year ago, we traded Scott Wisler of HBD fame for a
new 6 bbl. brewpot and it's been working famously.  I shudder to think
where we would be if we were still brewing in the old 1 1/2 bbl. pot.


Yes.  We're an extract based brewery but I'm not so foolish as to believe
that extracts alone are enough to produce quality beers.  We use plain malt
extract as our fermentable base and infuse grains in the brewing water to
make the different styles we serve.  Had it not been so widely publicized
here that we use extracts hardly anyone would be able to tell from drinking 
our beer.


We've brewed around 27 different kinds of beer in the last 2 years.  We've
introduced this small mountain town to IPA's, fruit beers, wheat beers, 
spiced beers, coffee stouts, and this year our several Belgian style beers
have been a big hit.  I had discovered that homebrewed beer that has sat in
kegs at home for a couple of years develop a very "nice" pediococcus bug that
impart a pleasant tartness to a beer, reminiscent of the Belgian Flemish
browns.  We did a controlled introduction of these little bugs into a
couple of our beers and the response was predictable--people either loved
or hated them.  Enough have loved them that we have kept some style or
other on line most of the year.


So it *is* possible to get into commercial brewing without mortgaging your
first born son.  We've borrowed no money, built our own equipment, and have
turned on Northwestern NC onto beer styles that were unheard of before we
put some of these brews on tap.


Would I recommend that other people follow our lead?  Yes and no.  We brew
under conditions that, while sufficient, are less than ideal.  I've had to
draw on every ounce of my 14 year brewing experience to pull this off.  The
biggest skill I've learned is how to reverse engineer beers.  For just like
homebrewing, every beer doesn't turn out the way you want it.  But
unlike homebrewing, you can't afford to pour them down the drain.  So far
we've been very fortunate.  I only jerked 30 gallons from the serving line
last year.  And I took those home to drink myself.  It's not that they were
"bad".  I just didn't want to stake the brewery's reputation on them.


Cam Hedrick, our former brewery operations manager resigned just before
Christmas to pursue other business interests.  Our new brewery operations
manager is Brian Lee and he's working out fine.  I *almost* posted here for
the new job but in the meantime I ran across Brian.


Gotta go.  Keep up the good work here and come see us.

Subject: More on PU brewing


A.J DeLange commented on brewing a PU clone,   I must admit that doing the 
double decoction is a slight cutting of corners and that a triple is 
better.   His point about differences in DC Pils malt is consistant  with 
Fixes empirical evidence that the DC Pils malt had changed since first 
introduced to the market.   My own observation of the grains acrospire 
(sp?) indicated the Ireks was less developed than the DC Pils.  I found 
that the new Wyeast Chech Pils yeast produces diacetyl and even with a rest 
there is some in the beer when done lagering, again I must own up to 
cautting a corner with the diacetyl rest.


Ideally one would do a triple decoction, a mid 40F ferment and a long cold 
lager.  I am guessing but I feel I save an hour in the brew day and about a 
month in the lager by doing only 2 decotions and a diacetyl rest.

We coming to the finish line on the secondary ferment
of an English Ordinary.  So far it appears to have the
color of Coors Extra Gold (!), and we'd like to add the
isinglass when we go into the keg; however, we'd also
like to prime in the keg.


The question is: can one do both of these and expect
it all to work?  Specifically, does the isinglass precipitate
the yeast as well as the proteins, and if so, is there any
reasonable way to clarify with isinglass and yet not
have to force carbonate?

Subject: Wort aeration, Bottles etc.


Greetings all--
I found a few neat things out in the world and thought some of you might 
find them useful.


I was at the aquarium store the other day buying some fish and just 
looking around.  I found a package of DISPOSABLE air stones.  These are 
just little pieces of porous plastic with a connector that allows them to 
be attached to the end of a piece of tubing.  Those of you that use 
aquarium pumps for aeration might be able to make use of something like 
this.  I figured that if they are made for fish tank use, they probably 
not going to contain anything harmful (tropical fish are much more 
sensitive to contaminants than people are) and if I sanitize with boiling 
water there would be no problems with using this in my beer.  Heck, if I 
can only use them once each, it is not too big a deal.  They cost $1.99 
for 6 of them.  I am willing to add an additional $.33 to my brewing 
session...


Secondly, for those of you in the Washington, DC area, Frederick Brewing 
Company, makers of Blue Ridge products, has switched to a plastic label 
that is about the easiest thing I have ever seen to remove from the 
bottle.  They just pull right off with no tearing and almost no glue 
residue on the bottle.  I have seen these labels on the ESB and on the 
Porter.  I can not speak for any of the other beers as I haven't tried 
them recently.  I do know that the Cranberry Christmas beer they put out 
this year still had the paper labels though.


Hope this helps someone..

Decoction mashing is more than just a way to raise temperature.  What you
describe ("using hot make-up water") is infusion mashing... i.e. adding
"infusions" of hot water to raise the temperature of the mash.  Decoction
mashing is where you remove 30-50% of the *grain* of the mash and just
enough liquid to prevent scorching, raise this up to saccharification temps
for 20-30 minutes, then boil it.  When you add this *decoction* back into
the main mash, you raise the temperature.  Note that in the final decoction
(from saccharification to mashout) you do not take any grain, only liquid.
This has been the source of much confusion when reading Noonan's book,
Brewing Lager Beer, in which he says "the thickest part of the mash" and
"the thinnest part of the mash."  What he means is "grain" and "liquid"
respectively.


Furthermore, Kirk writes:

It should be the other way around, but probably only in the very bottom
1-2" of the mash.  When you are recirculating the turbid runoff at the
beginning of the lauter, you are removing the small particles from the
bottom of the grain bed and depositing them on the top where they will
(hopefully) get trapped in the grain bed.  So, once the grain bed has
been established, the very bottom is large husk particles, followed by
smaller husk particles, etc.

Lactose is a sugar that is unfermentable by yeast.  It is commonly used
for making sweet stouts.  It is far less sweet than glucose or sucrose
or maltose, so you need to use quite a bit for a sweet beer.  I've used
between 1/2 and 1 pound per 5 gallons for a lightly sweet beer.  Really
sweet beers like the Caribbean Stouts (e.g. Dragon Stout) or beers like 
Mackeson's XXX Stout would need far more than 1 pound per 5 gallons.


You can add the lactose either in the boil or as late as bottling time,
but be sure to sanitize it by boiling it in some water.  If you add it
at bottling time, you can add it more "to taste."


One thing additional note of when using lactose: be extra careful with
sanitation.  Lactose *is* fermentable by lactobacillus and other bacteria!

Correction... unless Jeff has joined the order of Trappist Monks, he's
making Abbey, not Trappist, ales.  You might ask Jeff, next time you see
him, why did he add an extra "p" in "tripel?"

Aubrey writes:

I think you should reconsider your source of hopping knowledge.  Mark
Garetz knows far less about brewing than he thinks he does.  He is confident
in his presentation, but that is all the more disturbing when he gives out
misinformation.  At least he should be honest when he is speculating.


*************
Patrick writes:

To call Mark Garetz's work with hops "research" is a grave mistake.
It may sound as if I have a personal vendetta against Mark and perhaps
I do.  Let me explain.  I am passionate about beer and homebrewing and
am deeply angered by the misinformation that Mark has been introducing
among homebrewers.   Mark appeared on the homebrewing scene about two
years ago, writing articles, posting to HBD, writing a book...  as if he
was some kind of hop expert.  In fact, he has been brewing less than
*3 years* now and wrote his book after less than two years experience.
Much of what he has written, including his book, is loosely based upon
his reading (and mis-reading) technical literature and then fabricating
formulas based upon nothing more than speculation.


To quote Dave in Sydney, who is quoting someone else:
>1. Garetz's *idea* that various flocculation characteristics affect
>utilization is sound; but his *number* to quantify it appears to be
>basically pulled out of the air.  There simply are no data to support it.


This is true of virtually all the formulas in his book "Using Hops."


So, yes, I am very strongly against what Garetz is spouting.  My intentions,
on the other hand, are purely for the betterment of homebrewing.  Despite the
fact that I do own a homebrew supply store, I do not do mailorder so I am not
in competition with HopTech... just in case you thought that might be my
motivation.


Thanks, by the way, to Dave for compiling all that information on utilization
numbers.  I've been very busy lately and subsequently had fallen behind in
my reading HBD.  I would have sent my own results if it hadn't been too late.
In any event, my research, albeit only a few datapoints for an article on
a completely different subject, appear to validate Jackie Rager's utilization
numbers (+10% which I added to compensate for hop bags) as long as you don't
use the blowoff method.


Fredrik writes:

As I said above, my research, although not nearly as extensive as Glenn
Tinseth's, proves that Rager's numbers are much closer to estimating
*scientifically measured IBUs* than Garetz's numbers (see my review of
Garetz's book in Zymurgy) which are *way off*.  In other words, Rager's
formulas are not a bad estimation of *real* IBUs.  Forget Garetz's formulas
 -- they will only brew overhopped beer!

I assure you that George Fix is a firm believer in protein breakdown in
the mash!  My personal experience is that the temperature and length of
the protein rest can have a significant effect on both the head retention,
and more importantly, the body of the resulting beer.  In highly modified
malts, as virtually all malts are these days (yes, even German malts) it is
true that there is far less protein breakdown than in undermodified malts.


At the Spirit of Belgium conference, there was a brewmaster (who used to
brew in Belgium, but now brews in Germany) who spoke about modification
and mashing schedules.  He said that the German brewers are having big
problems with the grain they are currently getting from their maltsters.
It is far too well modified to work with the traditional mashing schedules
they have used for hundreds of years.  As a result, they are shortening
and altering the temperatures of their protein rests to compensate for the
overmodified malts.

Okay, I have never thought of myself as an imbecile, and I
consider computers my friends.


But I CANNOT get a copy of Suds 3.1 from the archive site
that will boot up and run!  I have tried FTP, WWW, ftpmail, etc.
Yes, I got the executable version.  It just won't run.


Would anyone like to help me get a good copy of this program?
Specific procedural help about getting a copy via the 'net
would be fine, or I'll pay for postage and diskettes or whatever.
In light of recent posts, it sounds like 3.0c is the preferred version.


Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help ease my frustration.

Subject: 10 gallon batches


Ed asks about convenient ways to do 10 gallon batches;


I have used this approach for the past 6 batches, each 10 gallons.


I use a 15 gal keg with a 14 inch opening cut out to fit a skillet lid, and
a 3/4 in ball valve just above the weld near the bottom. I also use Hop
pellets. I boil on a 18 inch high stand in my basement.


1)      Collect 11 gallons wort, boil 60-90 minutes, leaving about 10.5 gals.
2)      Insert immersion cooler. Place lid in the last 5 minutes of boil.
3)      Chill with cold tap water (ca 40 minutes). Remove chiller.
4)      Pitch with 2 quarts starter *directly into the boiling keg*.
        Leave lid in place.


Next day (day 2) (for the curious) Peek into the keg to see if Krausen is up.


On day 3 or 4, open ball valve and collect 10 gallons into two sanitized
Cornelius kegs. Tilt boiling keg to collect the last 1/2 gallon, avoiding
the well-settled trub and hops debris. Place lid and pressurize a tiny bit
to make good seal.


For a few days, bleed a little pressure each day. I have a gauge connected
to a gas-in line that I use to check to see how much needs to be bled.


That's it. The yeast is well settled by about day 8, though there is some
crap in the first pint or so. I bleed this off in the basement before
connecting the keg to my whole-house beer line. ;=)


That's it. I'm never going back to carboys.


Oh, I'm sure we'll hear from folks who will say that the break will inhibit
yeast growth or some such, but I have met 1x10^13 little buddies who
disagree. As far as the sanity (double meaning intended) of open
fermentation, I'm sure it is more sanitary than when I siphoned into two
carboys. These batches have been by far my best tasting too.


just one man's perspective....

Well, after a number of very helpful replies I feel that my computer controlled
RIMS might actually get built. Boy is my prof going to flip. I'll have to
invite him over for a brew session!


Many questions:
Firstly: experience. I have heard a number of good ideas about how to do
this, but who has actually built/own a computer controlled RIMS? Is it
really worth it? How automated can it get before it gets boring? How can
one computer control a valve to open/close without buyinng something truly
costly? Has anyone got a digital specific gravity meter? Where can I see
real RIMS?


I live in Toronto. Anyone know of suppliers/good junkyards(toronto has lots
of junkyards, but they can't all be good!). Basically I'd have to buy 
everything.


Anyone know how much a refractometer costs?


What about heat sources? I'd like to keep this inside, so any gas burning
setups could be dangerous. How else can this be done?


Cost will be a big factor. Any/all suggestion as to keeping costs down
would be greatly appreciated.


The more I think about this project, the giddier I get. I am loving this, 
even if my bank account doesn't!

Subject: Wyeast 1968 / Request for tubing info / Gott info


Two questions and some input:


I've used Wyeast 1968 (the ESB) in 3 batches in the last 2 months with mixed
results. While I really like the flavor profile I get with it, I've been
less than impressed with its fermentability.  Batch 1 fermented from about
1.036 to 1.015.  I was a little short on beer at the time so I bottled it
anyway.  OK, but kind of sweet.  Batch 2 started at around 1.040, got stuck
around 1.022 and hasn't moved much since.  I've tried racking, rousing,
shaking - no luck.  It's been about a month now and I'll either aerate it or
dump it; I'm not sure if it's worth the bother.  Batch 3 had better luck.  I
aerated the wort for 30 minutes before and after pitching.  Beer started at
1.050 and after 1 week is
down to 1.014.  In each case I pitched about 2 ounces of yeast slurry (which
works fine for all my other beers, even the lagers) and in each case I had
no visible signs of fermentation for 24-36 hours (usual lag time <12 hours),
even with the batch I aerated. 


Question:  what are other people doing to get this beer to ferment out -
should I be pitching *more* yeast?  Nutrients?   


BTW, I've read here and elsewhere that this yeast is very flocculent and I'm
convinced.  In each batch the yeast cake was the consistency of tofu.  Also,
from what I've observed this yeast seems to do better in the high 60's.
Batch 2, the stuck batch, dropped to around 60F and that's about when the
gravity stopped falling.


Tubing:  I posted here before looking for sources for food grade plastic
tubing that can stand high (boiling) temps but my post seemed to fall
through the cracks.  I'm asking again - any pointers?  TIA.


Gott cooler mas/lauter tun input:   My most recent batch was done in my new
Gott setup.  Basically I have the 10gallon Gott cooler with a Phil's Phalse
Bottom (PPB).  I connected the PPB to the Gott thusly:  a) Remove spigot
assembly from Gott.  b) Place #3 drilled stopper into hole where spigot was.
3) Cut 8" piece of copper tubing and place it through hole in stopper.  4)
Connect copper tubing to hose barb on PPB with 2" vinyl tubing  5)  Place
more vinyl tubing on other end of copper tubing, use hose clamp to control
flow.   Notes: the only real problem I had with this was that some grains
got stuck under the PPB.  After recirculating a few quarts, the wort ran
free and clear.  The mash temperature lost only 4 degrees F over an hour (I
can probably improve this by not checking the temp. so often).  So far, I'm
satisfied.

Subject: Mosher Hop Utilization Numbers






David Draper gave a nice summary of hops utilization in HBD #1645.


He pointed out that his Mosher numbers were received second hand.  I
did a sanity check with Mosher's _Brewer's Companion_ and came up with
some slightly different numbers.


Mosher charts boiling time vs. wort gravity to estimate alpha acid
utilization.  He does this for both whole and pellet hops, with greater
utilization shown for pellets.  I believe the Rager numbers are also
based on pellets, at a specific gravity of 1.050.


The following are my attempts to read the values off of Mosher's charts
for SG 1.050.  Any errors are my own.


Time (min)   Pellets   Whole
   15          11.5     8.5
   30          16.5    12.3
   45          20.0    15.0
   60          23.0    17.0
   90          27.0    20.3


As you can see, the pellet data show a higher utilization at the low
end than any of the other approximations.  Like the whole hops data,
Mosher's pellet data shows very little of the 45 minute elbow seen in
the other approximations.

I filled my fermentaion lock halfway with a B-Brite water solution.


I had the ale at 60 F then was told that ale should be fermented at 72 F


so i moved the wort to my bathroom with the temp around 70 F.


I thought that that that was too low so i filled my tub up with hot water 
around 80 F and am currently letting the fermentation bucket sit in there.

 I can probably improve the carbonates and the pH by boiling the water which

there any reasonable method for removing this?  Do I need to remove this?  Is

Subject: Water analysis for Koelsch: German degree of hardness


  
For those of you interested in the previously posted water analysis for Koeln
(Cologne):
  
The total hardness includes alkaline earth cations (Ca, Mg) and carbonates. The
definition is not internationally normed and is based on the weight of a
standard substance which would be added to give a solution of equivalent
hardness. This can also be expressed in  milliequivalents of ions for a clearer
comparison.
  
German deg. of hardness   1 dH = 10   mg CaO/liter   = 0.357 mequ/liter
French deg. of hardness   1 fH = 10   mg CaCO3/liter = 0.200 mequ/liter
English deg. of hardness  1 eH = 14.3 mg CaCO3/liter = 0.286 mequ/liter
American deg. of hardness 1 aH = 10   mg CaCO3/liter = 0.200 mequ/liter
  
The hardness due to carbonates is the sum of bicarbonate and carbonate anions.

that there are so many to choose from."

        That light that you see at the water station is not IR but 
is UV. I have been told that UV has more energy than IR and kills 
most of the nasties the lurk around.
        About your leaking wort chiller, you could try compression 
fittings. I don't know what your system looks like so you are going to 
have to make the call, but those things hardly ever leak. The draw back 
to them is that they are permanent. If you have to slide something over 
the end of the tube to take it apart then you can't use them.

        If your bottles break from the boiling wort, try preheating 
them in the oven before you fill them. Preheating will reduce the 
thermal stress that the glass has to handle. That is the same reason 
that you have cold water in the carboy before dumping the hot wort in.
Try about 180 degrees F, and you also get the bonus of killing anything 
that might be still alive in your bottles.

way you heat your fridge, a bulb wraped in foil, but the bulb would only
last about a month before it burned out. What I have now is a ceramic 
heater that screws into a light socket but does not give off any light. 
I have had mine on for a year now and it is still going. The only thing 
that could be wrong with it for your setup is that I have never seen them 
smaller that 100 watts. I think that you said that you use 20 watts. 
Maybe you could hook it up to a dimmer switch to cool it down a little.

"Wallinger, W. A." <WAWA`at`chevron.com> writes:
>has anyone devised equations for any of the hop utilization data tables
>     hop utilization =3D f(time, malt concentration)?


=46irstly, a correction: the utilization is a function of time only (or is
regarded as such by most homebrewers, I think). The correction for gravity
appears in the IBU calculation. This seems to be the most common formula:


IBU =3D 7490 * AAU * Utilization / Volume / (1 + Adjustment)


where
  AAU =3D %Alpha in decimals * Ounces
  Volume =3D boil volume of wort in US gallons
  Adjustment =3D 0 if SG (of boiled wort) < 1.050 , else (SG - 1.050) * 5


=46or metric units (AAU in %*grams, Volume in liters) use 1000 instead of 74=
90.


Now to the answer of the question. I have made nonlinear fits with
Mathematica (tm) to some of the common utilization tables:


Rager:


0.186906 + 0.150222 * Tanh(0.0484772 * (boiltime - 32.3893))


Garetz, slow yeast:


0.0840962 + 0.0905326 * Tanh(0.0680408 * (boiltime - 28.5246))


Garetz, average yeast:


0.104635 + 0.112329 * Tanh(0.0684079 * (boiltime - 28.8976))


Garetz, fast yeast:


0.124048 + 0.132366 * Tanh(0.0712121 * (boiltime - 28.6739))


Tinseth:


0.152829 + 0.116953 * Tanh(0.0610702 * (boiltime - 27.0089))


(Boiltime in minutes, utilization in decimals.)


You can, of course, drop some significant figures. The formulas are rough
approximations anyway and I deliberately used some weights to make the
graphs fit better.


One thing to remember is that the utilization is approximately 10% larger
if you use pellets instead of whole hops and 10% less if you use a hop bag.
Rager's numbers seem to be for pellets and all the others for whole hops.


I was not aware of Tinseth's figures until I read the post from Dave Draper
yesterday. Seems I had an older version of the hop faq. (Thanks, Dave!) I
now use Tinseth's numbers, as they seem to fit well with my experience.
YMMV.


Hope this helps!

I've been using the same gallon jug for well over a year now.  It sits at

Subject: RE: Adding hops hopped kits/carbonation/carbonation of Hefeweizen


Greg Hawley asked about adding hops to hopped kits:


I have been doing all-grain for about a year now and probably won't go 
back to extracts.  However, if I were to, I would use unhopped extracts.  
It seems to me that the product is more similar to the wort we get from 
the great sparging, except it has water removed.  You can schedule hops 
and other grains the same way as you could if you were all-grain 
brewing.  You would have more control over the final product.  Don't get 
me wrong, I have brewed extract beers from hopped kits and had great 
results.  I am just giving you some of my thoughts.


Kevin Staub asked about carbonation levels:


Carbonation after one week may be a bit on the low side, especially 
during the winter months when the house is generally 10 degrees cooler or 
so.  Usually I give my beers two weeks before I decide there is a 
problem.  Also, if those babies were put in the refrigerator or kept in 
low temperatures (below 60F or so), they will not carbonate quickly and 
make take many weeks.  Make sure they are at room temperature for a week 
or two before chilling.  (You probably are doing this already, but 
thought I would throw it in).


I ask today:


I know part of the Hefeweizen style is to have relatively high 
carbonation, does the yeast enhance carbonation levels?  After four weeks 
in the bottles, the carbonation level is far too high.  I was fairly 
certain that fermentation was complete and I didn't over prime.  There is 
no infection because the beer in my mini-kegs is some of the best beer I 
have ever brewed.  Any ideas?
