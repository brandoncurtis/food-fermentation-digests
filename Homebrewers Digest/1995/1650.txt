I have been given the basic recipe for a commercial

in numbers I do not comprehend. I am assuming that
they are in Plato (?).


They are:
                O.G.    11.5 - 12
                F.G.    2.5 - 3


Can anyone translate this for me?


Also if the recipe calls for Belgian 2 Row is this
equivalent to either Belgian Pilsner or Belgian Pale Malt>

Subject: RE: Halogens and Stainless


Gunther suggested that Iodine, being a Halogen like Chlorine, would be equally
damaging to stainless steel.  He recommended the use of Metabisulfite for
sanitizing stainless steel kegs.


Well, I can't find any data. The one data point I did find in the ASM Handbook
of Corrosion Data, read as follows:


For 304 Stainless Steel,


Conditions:
Soap Processing; field or plant test; no aeration;  |
rapid agitation. Plus 11% isopropyl alcohol,        | Probably comparable
2% hydrochloric acid, remainder nonionic detergent. | to Iodophor


Concentration = 10% (vol)         | More severe than our conc. of Iodophor.
Temperature = 22C/72F
Duration of Test = 90 days        |
Corrosion Rate = .0071 inch/year  | ie. Minimal


In addition, given the fact that Iodophor was originally manufactured for use
in the Food Services Industry, which predominately uses 300 series stainless
steel utensils and containers, I imagine that corrosion as a result of its
primary application is not a problem.  Furthermore, the fact that I searched
several volumes of the Metals Handbook and could find no mention of Iodine,
except with respect to elevated temperature attack on Tantalum, leads me to
conclude that there is no problem with its use re. stainless.


Re: Metabisulfite, I believe I have read that it is effective for killing wild
yeasts in wines, but not effective at sanitizing containers. Metallurgically, I
could not find any data on it.

This is a response to Rich Lenihan's use of Wyeast 1968 ESB.
 
The last batch of brew I made used this yeast with what I thought was pretty
good success.  I too was getting worried after about a day with no signs of
fermentation.  Like you described the visible signs of fermentation took ~36
hours.  This is the procedure I used.  After racking the wort into the primary
I pitched about 2 ounces of yeast slurry and aerated the wort about 5 minutes
each hour for 4 hours.  The beer started at 1.048 and fermented out to 1.015
after 6 days; temp was approx. 68 deg. throughout fermentation.
 
There's my 2 cents.

I defer to John Palmer on the first point, but want to point out that
that should have been metabisulphite and that neither of these are
sanitizers -- they merely inhibit yeast (and bacterial ?) activity
when added to an acidic solution (like wine must).  I've read where
beer is not quite acidic enought for it to work so it is recommended
to be used only for sanitizing wine must or fruit juices.  Putting
bisulphites (aka Campden tablets) in water DOES NOT make sanitizing
solution.

Yes.  Of course.  This is how the British brewers do it -- they add the
isinglass and primings at the same time (when it's put in the cask).  The
job of the isinglass is *primarily* to fine the yeast out of suspension,
but that does not mean that it removes the yeast from being active in the
cask.  As long as you don't fine, *then transfer* and prime, you should
have no problems.  Just remember that the carbonation level of a Bitter is
far lower than the level of virtually any other style.

On the contrary... your yeast should like the trub -- they can actually
use it for nutrition during respiration.  Regarding your sanity, er...
sanitation, the two-quart starter reduces your risk of noticable infection
to virtually nil and indeed, as you say, going from kettle to keg without
the carboy in the interim also reduces sanitation worries.  The one thing
that you may want to pay attention to is higher alcohols.  It has been
reported that fermenting on the break can increase the production of
higher alcohols.  However, there are even some commercial breweries that
ferment on the break, so if you are happy with the beer, there's no need
to change anything.

HDPE tubing (that milky, water-line tubing at the hardware store) gets a
little soft and spongy at boiling temps, but if it does not have to hold
pressure, you should be okay.  More expensive choices are (from the
Cole-Parmer catalog): PharMed (275F), Norprene Food Grade (275F), Tygon
Food Grade (180F) and Silicone (500F, but mind you, Silicone's oxygen
permiability is 300 times that of the others -- keep that in mind if
you plan to use this for dispensing finished beer with it also).  There's
also polypropylene (275F) tubing available also, and some PP is food grade,
but it's quite stiff and thus hard to work with.  Here's something...
Bev-A-Line V (200F)... it's FDA, USDA and USP aproved.  Thay also have
Teflon PTFE (500F) tubing here also, which is FDA approved, but it's
over $50 for 12 feet of 3/8" OD and more for the bigger stuff.
Cole-Parmer is in Chicago and can be reached at 800-323-4340 (708-647-7600).
In general, their prices are about 200% of sources like hardware stores
for similar items.

Yes and Yes... you are missing pH *and* worrying too much.  As long as your
pH is in the low 5's, you need not worry about extracting tannins during
the decoctions.

Eamonn, I was wondering if a solenoid valve from a forced hot water
furnace would do the trick for you.  (This may not be priced low
enough for you though. You might check with a heating supply place.)
Of course, you'll need to use something like a relay to step up the
voltage to whatever the solenoid needs.   For a heat source, how
about the heating element(s) out of a discarded electric water heater?
Again, you'll need a relay, since these (mine) use 240 VAC.
     
Hope these ideas help.   - Barry

Subject: hop utilization and IBUs


The point about utilization varying depending on whether
you use whole hops or pellets is a good one.  Especially if
Garetz doesn't report what kind he is presenting data for.


Garetz does present a good method of estimating IBUs in
your homebrew.  This may be a good check for his formula
for calculating IBUs.  My homebrew club ran this experiment
and it worked quite well.


Let's say you make a pale ale with (according to Garetz
formula) 40IBUs of bitterness.  Get a reference beer with
a known amount of IBUs, like Budweiser.  Jackson's and
Eckhardt's books give actual IBUs of various commercial
beers.  Garetz describes the process in detail, but you
add a known amount of hop oil to your reference beer until
the bitterness tastes the same as the bitterness in your
pale ale.  You can then calculate the bitterness of your 
reference by adding the IBUs that Bud started with to 
the number of IBUs that you added.


Now you can estimate the IBUs in your pale ale using both
Garetz formula and Rager's formula (or whoever's).  See
which one matches the IBUs in the reference beer above.


I'll try this with my next beer and report back.

For some reason, my last two mini-kegs have lost carbonation.  I'm using the

making a low hissing sound (obvious loss of carbonation).  Has anyone else 
experienced this?  If so, what was the problem and how was it fixed?  I hate 
to throw the beer away because it's flat.  Could the bungs be getting old

Try using a percentage of 6-row in your mash. The extraction rate is less
(use 10% more). The size of the kernel will greatly reduce the possibilities
of a stuck mash.

Subject: Bottle Washing, Cant we get this straight?


Ok folks, I dont know why I dont just make this a faq, but here goes.


Ive been using bottles now for quite some time.  Usualy I deal with the 
grolsh kind, however, I do use some non-grolsh style.  In either case, 
heres the lowdown on how to wash your bottles, and still be anal about 
sterilization.


First of you should have the following equipment on hand.
A "Jet" style bottle washer.
A Bottle Brush
A Dishwasher
Dishwasher Detergent
TSP, Chempro, or other sanatizing agent.


Procedure.
Rinse bottles with bottle washer, use bottle brush if needed.  Place 
bottles on only 1 rack of dishwasher.  On most dishwasher, the top rack 
gets about 1/3 the amount of washing power, and it does not seem to do as 
good of a job.
After dishwasher is filled with bottles, use your Chempro, TSP, etc. in 
your SECONDARY washer cups.  This is *usualy* the ones you fill first, 
then flip/move the detergent door.  Then fill the primary with Dishwasher 
detergent.  Run a complete dishwasher cycle includeing heat dry.


Let it also be known, that you should *NOT* fill your secondary cups with 
Chempro, tsp, etc.  I use about 1 tsp for a whole dishwasher load, I use 
Chempro.


Cautions/Concerns/Questions
Q: What type of detergent should I use?
A: Ive used, about 6 different kinds, I usualy just buy whats on sale, 
   I have no used a "Liquid" type, only the dry stuff. 


Q: What about the washers on grolsh style bottles, do they warp?
A: I thought they would, but they seem to hold up fine.  If you are 
   paranoid about it, then take em off, but it doesnt seem necessary.


Q: Why use Chempro, TSP, etc, in the secondary cups?
A: Ive found that this rinses off any residue that the detergent soap 
   leaves behind.  Ive never noticed *ANY* off flavors, head retention
   problems, what not from using the Chempro in the secondary cycle.  I
   *DID* however notice an off flavor when using the one cycle method, 
   this *MAY* have been due to a particular detergent.


Q: Why wash them first?
A: This gets rid of the sediment and other junk that manages to dry up or
   stay in your bottle.  Washing them first cleans the "Junk" out, the 
   purpose of the dishwasher is to clean them with detergent inside and
   out, and also to sterilize them better than you can do by hand.  If you
   leave stuff in your bottles and it makes it to the DRY cycle, imagine
   how much harder its going to be to get off your bottle once its been
   baked on.


Q: Do I have to use Chempro, Tsp, etc?
A: No, you can just leave the secondary cups empty, however you do run a 
   better chance of leaving some detergent there.  You can use just about
   any "Clean Rinsing" sanatizing agent.  Ive not tried iodine, but I 
   cant see any reason not to either.


That about covers it.  Sorry for the long post, I hope this clears it
up for everyone.

Subject: How should I use DRY chiles?


A friend gets large containers of dry chile peppers from her family in 
California. She loves hot, spicy foods and has asked me to make a chile 
beer for her. I realize that fresh peppers are more appropriate, but we'd 
rather not turn up our noses at a lifetime supply of FREE dry peppers. 
Any help, especially successful recipes, would be greatly appreciated!
Adjustments for working with dry fruit would also be very helpful. 


BTW, she calls them "chinese" chiles. They are red and look roughly like 
a long, large jalepeno. They are quite hot. My friend is Mexican, brought 
up in the Mexican tradition (i.e., super-hot food; she drinks Tabasco 
Sauce right out of the bottle). Even she finds the peppers to be hot.

Subject: Motorized mills


Dion Hollenbeck warns of potential grain mill damage from a direct drive
system like I am using on my Glatt.  Actually, the mill-half of the split
coupling I am using is only clamped to the mill's drive shaft, with a
(longitudinally) split bushing.  The coupling's set screw squeezes the split
bushing together on the mill's power input shaft (there is no key or flat on
the shaft), and this connection will slip if over loaded.  


Concerning foreign objects jammed in the rollers, this might not pose a
hazzard to the mill's drive gears, depending on the object.   If in such an
event the rollers are locked together rigidly by the object, a rock, say, the
load path will be through the mill's drive shaft, rollers, the foreign
object, and ultimately into the mill's frame through its bearings (not
through the gears).  If the mill can digest the object (or objects, like hard
wheat berries), there may be loads which attempt to force the rollers out of
sync, and gear damage could occur.  Since these forces are reacted between
the components of the mill, shaft input torque may not even be an adequate
safety valve.  I think I'll stay away from unmalted wheat, based on the
reports of others.


My preference for the direct drive system stems mainly from its compactness. 
A 12" pulley on the mill's shaft would extend forward in close proximity to
the grist chute, and below the mill's bottom mounting surface.  My mill and
motor are mounted to a 6" x 18" flat plate with rubber feet on the bottom. 
The mill/motor combination can therefore be placed on the edge of any flat
surface, such as a table, with a bucket placed below the grist chute.

Nothing will clog an EM faster than using IM.  I even tried propping my kettle 
at an angle while chilling to try to get all the break material on one side, but
that didn't do it either.  I have also tried attaching a piece of siphon hose to
the spigot and blowing air through the EM to clear it, but it quickly clogged 
back up.  I ended up picking up the kettle and pouring it through a clean but 
unsanitized funnel to get it into the carboy.  Of course, it ended up infected. 
My only solution, so far, is to either not use IM, or remove the screen part of 
the EM between the sparge and the boil,  drain everything from the kettle into 
the carboy, and rack to a second carboy as soon as possible.


Some people use a racking cane with a copper scrungee attached -- this may be 
the easiest solution.  I have also heard of people using a slotted copper ring 
that just fits the inner circumference of their kettle and siphons out the top 
in the usual manner.  The wort is "whirlpooled" so that all break material 
gathers in the middle (I still don't know how to do this if you use an immersion
chiller...).  It shouldn't be too hard to connect a similar ring to the spigot 
part of the EM once the screen was removed.

Sorry, Norm, but I really gotta disagree with you on this one.  While
in principle I agree that being involved in the brewing process is a
good thing, in practice this is very dangerous in a RIMS system.
Before I got my proportional temp controller built, I had the pump and
heater all done and wanted to use my system (read, play with the new
toy).  So instead of a temp controller, I hooked up a simple on/off
switch.  Really involved and simple.  Just watch the temp readout and
when you come within so many degrees (by trial and error) turn off the
heat and the thermal mass catching up will slide gently up to the
temperature.  All fine in theory unless you get to talking with a
guest brewer and forget that you just turned *off* the switch, see the
temp sliding up to the setpoint real fast and *turn off the switch*
(remember, it was already off, so now you just turned it *ON*).  Since
there is a very large thermal mass, the fact that the heater has gone
back on will not register until much later, in fact until it is too
late to turn off the switch and prevent the many degree overshoot
which will happen.


All of this is not theory, but my own tragic experience.  I came
within a hair's breadth of killing the enzymes in the first 10 minutes
of the mash cycle.  From that time on, I was hunched over the switch,
muttering to myself "is it on or off, which way is it really????"  The
rest of my mash was tense and unpleasant.  I don't know about anyone
else, but I built a RIMS system so I could *RELAX* during the mashing
process.  All I have to do is be able to correctly read my watch and
turn a dial to the correct temperature at the correct time.  I am
involved in the brewing process, usually explaining it to new brewers.
If I had to be on the switch to control the temperature, I would never
again have anyone over who would possible distract me, and the joy of
spreading the word of homebrewing by teaching it while watching it
happen would be lost in my brewhouse.


You might argue that you could use some sort of dimmer switch on the
heater, but I do not know of any reasonably priced dimmer switch that
will handle 12 amps (remember, the RIMS is using a 4500 220V heater
element run on 110V at 1250 watts - 11.3 amps).  My proportional temp
controller is *much* less expensive than a dimmer which will handle
that kind of current.  Which leaves us back at an on/off switch,
unless you have some other alternative.  Besides, the temp controller
is not that hard to build.  You can buy for $185 if you are really
elecro-phobic.

Subject: Motorizing Malt Mills


Just another note on motorizing malt mills. I've been through 2 revisions of
motorizing a "Malt Mill". The power source was a 1/10th HP gearmotor with a
30 RPM output and torque rating of 113 in/lbs. The reason for this motor
selection? Easy - it was free! The 113 in/lbs seems like enough (in my seat
of the pants engineering judgement), the 30 RPM a little slow, (based on hand
cranking speed) but the price was right. The first design was mounted behind
the "Malt Mill" and driven via a 1/2" timing belt. This was OK but always had
problems with belt tension and skipping teeth (slipping) under load. I also
didn't like the idea of side loading the driven roll, my fear was the bronze
bushing would die a premature death. But it did work, (although slowly)
providing a good crush. The 2nd revision I pulled out all the stops,
remounting the mill on an elevated platform hold both the motor and mill,
allowing the collection bucket to slide in and out without lifting the mill
and motor,(as in revision 1) and replaced the belt drive with an in-line jaw
type coupling. This has been in service at my local homebrew shop for the
past 9 months with no problems.

Please excuse me for needing so much hand-holding--but let
me verify I understand.  Are you saying that a 3 week
secondary fermentation/conditioning in your pressure
vessels is sufficient to both clarify and carbonate to
your taste?  Is your 3 week minimum condxing period
at ~room temperature?


BTW, when we used isinglass for the first and only time
I added it incrementally as we pumped our chilled wort
from the fermenter into the keg, then tried as best we
could to agitate without sloshing too much.  I noticed
absolutely no indication of clarification--the beer
is still fairly opaque (it's a brown ale) after three
weeks in the cooler, and is definitely not "bright".  I
have no point, I'm just relaying results and trolling

          Greetings everyone!
               The other day my father and I were downing a few
          homebrewed stouts, and the talk turned to brewing equipment.
          We were discussing ways to reduce the risk of a scorched
          mash when direct heating is used. ( I mash in a converted
          keg, BTW)  My father suggested employing a double-boiler
          type setup to eliminate direct contact with the flame, and
          still allow the use of a Cajun cooker as a heat source.
          This seems plausible, the only drawbacks I can see are a
          possibly longer period of time to reach the temp. rests, and
          less precise temp. control.
               Has anyone used this arrangement, and if so, would you

Greetings!


I have been away from my cherished hobby for almost 6 months now (bought a new

will have on my brewing.  I have done one all-grain up to now, and want to

I've noticed that a number of the contributors to HBD identify their
brewing operations as "The So-and-so Picobrewery".  Now I've been
labeling under the proud name of "Schwartzenkeane's *Nano*brewery" (a
concatenation of my wife's surname with my own; our motto: "Fine Beers
Since Sometime in April").  Just to pick a nit or two, if the
definition of a microbrewery (10**-6 brewery) given in the
rec.food.drink FAQ is correct:


2-8. What are the categories of brewers/breweries?
     According to the Institute of Brewing there are four categories as
     follows:


     Large Brewers -  Production in excess of 500,000 barrels/year
     Regional Brewers - Production between 15,000 and 500,000 bbl/yr
>>   Microbrewers - Production less than 15,000 bbl/yr <<
     Brewpubs - Production for onsite consumption only


     In addition you may see/hear the term pico-brewer which is used to
     describe brewers so small that distribution is limited to pubs and
     bars in their immediate area.


then a nanobrewery (10**-9 brewery) should have production of less
than 15 bbl/year, and a picobrewery (10**-12 brewery) should have a
production of less than .015 bbl/year, or roughly half a gallon or so!
Surely y'all are doing better than that!

Subject: Washing Bottles with a Dishwasher




A couple of months ago I asked whether or not using
a dishwasher really got bottles clean enough to not
require further arduous treatment. These are the 
responses I got.


Tom Cannon: We put clean bottles in the dishwasher 
with B-Brite instead of dishwashing soap and run 
through a full sanitizing cycle.  It works great,
but I would be worried about putting dirty bottles 
in.  This method only gets around the Bleach 
Soak/Rinse part.


M. Demers: Just put bleach in where the detergent 
normally goes. Also, rinse the bottles out that 
have sludge in the bottom before you put them in 
the washer and you should be golden.


John DeCarlo: I wash all my bottles in the dishwasher, 
immediately after emptying them.  It seems to do fine 
with bottles on the bottom rack.  Those on the top rack
aren't as reliably cleaned. So at sanitation time I make 
sure they are all clean. Different dishwasher geometries 
may affect this.  I would try a test with flour at the 
bottom of a dozen bottles and see which ones get cleaned.


Rick Larsen: I'd recommend you staying with your four-step 
method [soak, rinse, bleach, rinse]. I haven't used a 
dishwasher but many friends have with poor results. I think 
bottle washing is not much fun but I wouldn't want it to 
screw up my beer. 


Steve Chandler: I EXCLUSIVELY use my diswasher with no 
detergent prior to bottling my beer. I used it for the 
last 6 batches and have no problems or complaints. My washer 
has a 'heat dry' cycle which kicks the temperature up to a 
point where I have to wait a couple of hours for the bottles 
to cool before I handle them. Of course I leave the washer 
buttoned up during this entire period. I also use the
washer door as a platform to bottle, which makes cleanup a 
lot easier.


After all this sage advice, I myself decided to stay with the
hand method. It's the only way to be sure.

I've been doing process control software for nearly twenty years and I do
know something about it.  And not to be too blunt, Winstead is pretty much
right, and Pyle is pretty much wrong.  The question, after all, was how to
build an automatic controller for a RIMS system, not whether automatic
control is morally right.


I don't have a RIMS, and I control my mashes manually.  But if you have a
RIMS, it makes some sense to want to control it automatically.  A simple
thermostatic control is "bang-bang" rather than proportional, and will tend
to overshoot -- maybe a lot.  To avoid overshoot, you need a control system
that adjusts the heat continuously, hopefully with some reference to the
actual temperature and its rate of change.  Which, after all, is what you
do manually.


If you want a decent automatic controller, a PID or fuzzy-logic (Winstead's
"AI") control algorithm is likely to be best.  You can get such a thing off
the shelf, though they are expensive.  Don't try to do a PID controller at
home.  Though the theory is quite simple, the devil is in the details, and
there are a lot of them.  A fuzzy controller might be easier.


It doesn't matter whether you know control theory or not -- it still
applies.  Overshoot is nearly unavoidable in all feedback control systems,
whether manual or automatic.  Oscillation and chaos, which can be worse
than overshoot, are also hard to avoid.  This is particularly true in
processes with large transport or "dead" times, like controlling the
temperature of a RIMS, or of your bathroom shower, for that matter.
Explaining this would take a lot more bandwidth than I want to use here.


I suspect no one on this forum, including Pyle, really thinks that
ignorance is desirable -- his flame was a cheap shot and quite out of
place.

be conducted on March 26, in Oakland. All beers will be judged by  
experienced judges, including local professional brewers and 
Dr. Michael Lewis of UC Davis.  Ribbons and prizes will be awarded 
to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers in each category, and to Best of  
Show.  
 
After judging, we invite you to a party at the nearby Barclays  
Pub and Restaurant to celebrate all efforts and award the winners.   
This will be an excellent opportunity to share homebrew and interact 
with the professional and amateur brewers who are reviving  
quality brewing in the Bay Area.
