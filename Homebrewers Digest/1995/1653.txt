Brewsters Who Run With The Wolves
Part 2.1
by Madame Marie Mains


        Salutations, cheers and greetings to all you brewers who put 
up with last month's revelations about brewster secrets in the brewing 
process. For those who missed it last month, a brewer is the male who 
brews and and brewster is the female version. This month, as promised 
I return to the womanly world of brewing and begin with the 
fermentation process as filtered through the brewsters' pantyhose.
        Right there- that word- ferMENtation. Such a misnomer for a 
process so basically female as it is. Once the cooled wort is poured 
off into the primary tank, we impregnate it with a yeast culture of 
choice. Now granted, the act of pouring in the yeast might be a manly 
task (Onan notwithstanding) but what happens next? Those yeasties 
begin to multiply faster than Patty Frustaci on fertility pills. Not 
only that, but that primary (and secondary if you use one) has to be 
coddled, nurtured, MOTHERED so as to remain at the proper temperature. 
If it is a ale, it has to be placed just so. I favor wrapping my ales 
in a heavy swaddling towel affixed with four clothes pins to both 
darken its surroundings and to keep outside temperature fluctuations 
less traumatic. If that doesn't make a sight to melt any womanly 
brewster's heart right next to the toilet in my upstairs bathroom 
(which is dark and quiet, except for occaisional guests and my 
husband's sorties if our other throne is already claimed by me), I 
don't know what does. Of course, I have to ponder my one or two bad 
batches of ale as possibly being contaminated- what with, I might 
venture to guess bad aim on my masculine guests' parts. It is also a 
sure fire conversation starter for you brewsters who entertain. Just 
tell the neophytes that it's your kid's science fair experiment; some 
sort of cloud chamber testing the methane levels pre- and post-
depositional in the average household.
        Lagers raise the maternal brewster's instincts to new heights. 
Since a lager requires a cold basement (not an option in SoCal, 
usually) or some king of controlled temperature chamber, I have made 
use of a small chest freezer with attached controller to raise my 
yeast babies properly. I might be accused of being Dahmerish in my 
attention to a chest freezer, but it's just those Mommy Dearest 
instincts at work. Daily I gently raise the lid and check the progress 
of my infant brew, not unlike a concerned mom checking to see if the 
kid's still breathing. I don't swaddle this lager baby but(t) I do 
make sure its chilly crib has been thoroughly wiped down with enough 
bleach to take care of a 1,000 diaper pails. Not even J.E. could 
possibly use more bleach than I do in this endeavor.
        When things have quieted down in the nursery tank, it's time 
to transfer to a secondary. This feat is accomplished with a piece of 
siphon hose and timing more precise than a well cued actor. Which 
brinds me to another major difference between brewers and brewsters. 
It's that hose, guys. We brewsters are infinitely more adept at both 
starting and stopping the hose than any of you brewers. It's all that 
practice from high shcool with our boyfriends. We can put that 
siphoning serpent into action faster than any of you can blink and 
stop it even faster. That latter action is best accomplished with a 
smart kink to the end. Like I said- we learned it all back there at 
ol' Brewster High.
        There are some of us (I number one of them) that forgo the 
secondary tank. On the subject of tanks I find that plastic works just 
fine for me, rather than glass carboys. Some brewers have probably 
figures out that my preference for plastic fermentation tanks has 
something to do with my Tupperware fixation, but hey- that cute aqua 
snap lid just gives me shivers, not to mention the taget circle that 
when pressed down, just squooshes out the air. Now if I could just 
find a siphon hose to match...
        Since contact with air isn't desirable at this point of 
transfer to a secondary, we brewsters have more to contend with than 
you brewers. First of all, bad hair days figure into the equation. On 
bad hair days, we brewsters suffer from PMS of the follicles. No 
amount of hairspray, mousse or gel is going to make our hair go the 
way we want it to. And if the hair isn't behaving, half our attention 
isn't on the hose handling. Furthermore, on bad hair days the risk of 
having loose hais fall into the brew increases. Now you might wonder 
how hair can find its way into that little hole on top of the 
fermenter lid. Where is our head, guys? Most likely bent over, 
concentrating on the hose (follow me on this, just follow me). Puts 
our hair a little closer to the hole, doesn't it? And we have been 
spraying glopping and creaming into our hair to make it behave. Those 
gels and mousses add weight to the hair shafts and you don't have to 
be Newton to figure out the direction the falling hair takes as it 
abandons our scalps. Right throught the hole and into our brew. And 
you judges out there say we brewsters can't brew brew beer with body--
HAH! Wait for my Nexxus dark ale at the '95 Ren Faire.

Subject: sour mashing


Hi.
Thanks to Bill Vaughan for posting on his sour mash technique.
I have tried a few of these too and have the following comments:


 - forget Papazian's technique in TNCJHB. It is very uncontrolled,
and you'll more than likely end up with rancid beer. Many BJCP
judges have commented on this character in beers made with this
technique. I'm not saying it won't work, but you can do the souring
in a more controlled fashion. Bill said he found the method
of adding lactobacillus by adding a handful of grains to the mash
unsatisfactory. I suspect it is because you are adding a whole host
of other bacteria and moulds as well. By adding a "sourdough"
culture (or yoghurt) to the mash instead, you are adding a more
consistent group of "nasties", so you'll get more predictable 
results. Presumably the yoghurt culture has only the lactobacillus
bug. But then, heh, what do I know?


 - Greg Noonan wrote an article for Zymurgy on sour mashing that
was very interesting (sorry, this is really slack, but I do not have
the issue at hand. Anybody who wants to know which one it was in,
email me and I'll find out for you). I have based my method on his
technique, so I'll try and summarise for you.
 - sour mash 10-15% of the grain bill for the batch, 2 days before
brewing. eg. If you are aiming for a 1.050 beer (say 4kg of grain)
then sour mash 500g (1 pound or so) 2 days beforehand. This
would apply for extract recipes too. Only sour mash the normal
pale grain.
 - Infusion mash your grain (eg. 1 pound) as normal with (say) 1 litre
(1 quart) of water. I do not think the amount is critical at this stage
(ie. it is thicker than normal, but it fits into my thermos!). After conversion,
let the temperature fall to 50C, then add a handful of grain.
I know, this sounds uncontrolled (after my previous sermon), but
the trick is, you keep the sour mash at 50C, in a sealed container,
for two days. (Note: it should not be airtight, to allow gas to escape,
but it should not have a significant amount of airspace on top). The 
idea is to provide an environment optimum for lactobacillus
fermentation, but one that other bacteria and moulds are not fond
of. Apparently, 50C inhibits most bacteria, but is fine for lactobacillus.
Anyway, I just put the whole thing in my 1.5l stainless steel thermos,
and loosely stopper it. After 2 days the pH falls to 3.5-4, and the
temperature by 4C or so. I have also tried doing larger amounts
in my oven, also with good results. I am no microbiologist, but if
my memory serves me well, this is basically as Greg Noonan
described.


After 2 days, you have quite a strong-smelling brew. It is obviously
lactic, but if anybody ever wondered what DMS smells like, then
try this technique, as you generate heaps of the stuff! I then just
add this to my normal mash (at mash-in) and proceed in the usual way.
You might like to take into account the extra acidity of your mash
before adding water treatments etc.. It should not adversely affect
any part of your mashing process (only an hour or two), and of course
when you boil the wort you kill off any bugs. If you are paranoid you
could add the sourmash at the end of the mash, but this is not the
way I have done it before.


So far I have tried this on the following beers:
 - porter
 - stout
 - Wit
 - pilsener


What? Pilsener you cry? Yeah, well I thought that too, but Greg
Noonan reckons a lactic, DMS character is essential in continental
lagers. If you say so, Greg. The technique worked very well in all
*but* the pilsener, in my situation. I found it added a nice complexity
to the overall flavour, but it did take at least 2-3 months to round
out properly. The sourness in the pilsener was a little overbearing.
Perhaps 1/2 that amount of sour-mashed grain is better for this
style (personally I won't try it again!). 
I hope some find this of interest,


Andy W.

Subject: EM problem




I did my second mash yesterday using the Easy Masher *tm, and was very
dissapointed when it came time to drain the cooled wort. The screen was
so clogged up it wouldn't drain. I even tried to scrape the trub off the
screen while the tap was open and it still would not flow. I finally had
to put my syphon hose into the kettle and drain it that way. Needless to
say I was pretty upset.I used pellet hops, as I did the last time, but
this mash also had 1/2 # wheat malt, and I had alot of cold break
material in the kettle.I figure that this is what was clogging up the
screen. Anybody else have this problem? Any suggestions? I can hear JS
now telling me not to use wheat or perhaps pellets, but I want to use
these ingredients in my brewing. I'll probably have to go back to the
copper manifold if this keeps happening. On another note, count me as
another who has given up his AHA membership.

Subject:       Hop Utilization (yet more...)


I would like to point out that there is a serious error in Jackie Rager's 
Hop Utilization article.  For gravities under 1.050, it's fine, but the 
Gravity Adjustment formula was either printed incorrectly or Jackie made a 
mistake.  I quote from the article


            GB - .050
    GA =    ----------   Where GB is the gravity of the boiling wort.
              0.20
              
This should be:


            GB - 1.050
       GA = ----------
              0.20
              


Otherwise, a pale ale with a gravity of 1.055, 5 gallon batch, 6.7% alpha 
hops, target IBU of 30 and a 30% utilization factor, will tell you to add 6 
ounces of hops when run through the other formula.  6 ounces!!!  (Bzzzt!
Thank you for playing.)  Thats when I examined the GA formula and 
discovered the mistake. Corrected, it calls for about 1 1/4 ounces.  This 
I can believe more than the other answer!


Remember these formulas that Mark and Jackie have given us are merely 
estimates and should not be used when trying to hit a precise target. Far 
more experimentation and a spectrophotometer are called for!  Maybe in my 
second lifetime I'll have time to do the research...


Beers to you!

From: Bob_McIlvaine`at`keyfile.com
Subject: RIMS comments


I've been reading the RIMS posts from Dion, Teddy, et. al. and have not
chimed in as yet. I'll remedy this now with a few comments.


 - I agree that the human brain is a great feedback controller, but, as Dion
has pointed out, not very good at external multi-processing.


 - It is definitely important to limit the outlet temps to below about 158F to
avoid denaturing your enzymes.


 - Using a lower wattage element will cause long lags between temperature
steps and will probably allow extended enzyme activities at undesirable
temperature points for some (maybe many) recipes.


 - We don't use the RIM heating element to get to mashout temps, we just get the
hot liquor tank up to a temperature that allows the initial infusion of sparge
water to raise the mash to about 170F. (Actually, a lot of the time we don't
even worry about it, just make sure the sparge water is up there, it's
pH is OK and just start spargin' )


 - We have temperature monitor points at the inlet and outlet of the heating
chamber and in the mash tun. This allows us to keep an eye out for any
thermal pockets in the mash and keep an extra check on what the heating
element is doing to the wort.


 - Simple on-off control of the element is undesirable. The point of the
proportional control is limit the energy output of the element (and therefore
the energy input to the passing wort) as the wort approachs the set point.


 - There was a very informative article in Steve Ciarcia's publication, Circuit
Cellar Ink, several issues back about closed loop temp control. They
used a hot tub for the example. You ask, what's that got to do with this?
Well, isn't a RIMS mash tun just a hot tub for enzymes? This article talks
about the considerations required when implementing proportional control,
thermal mass, overshoot, etc.

Subject:       Repitching yeast before bottling


Hello homebrewers!  


I've got a question concerning the hows and whys of 
repitching yeast before I bottle.  I've been brewing for only a year 
now and have started brewing some lagers.  In my last batch, I left 
the secondary carboy in the fridge at about 35F for over 6 weeks, 
plus I added polyclar.  I did not intend to leave it in this long, but 
schedules did not permit otherwise.  I ended up with a VERY clear
beer. Beautiful!  But I'm wondering how viable the yeast is for 
priming the bottles.  Has extended time in the secondary 
'inactivated' and/or mutated most of the yeast? or have the low 
tempuratures 'saved' the yeast?  It's been a week now 
since I bottled and I am seeing sediment, so I guess I'm worried more
about mutated yeast and also wondering for future reference.  Should 
I repitch yeast prior to bottling in this type of situation?  If so, 
how much? Should a make up another starter of liquid, or just 
activate and pitch some dry yeast (I use liquid in the primary)?  Or 
should I pitch from the sediment of the primary or secondary, and how?


TIA for any / all help!

Subject: Malted Wheat Color and Aging


Craig Amundsen asks about the color contribution of malted wheat. I just
happened to have a spec sheet sitting here that includes info from the 
following maltsters;


Hugh Baird UK                > 1.5 - 3.0 L
Briess USA                > 4 L
Gambrinus CAN                > 2.0 - 2.5 L
De Wolf-Cosyns Belgium        > 1.6 - 2.0 L


So, as always it depends on who made it.


Tom Puskar asks for opinions on aging beer. My humble opinion is that for
all but a few higher strength styles, most homebrew is at it's peak of
perfection very early while still fresh. This is particularly true of British
style ales. In my experience even lagers are best relatively soon after
bottling but should undergo as long a cold lagering as possible in bulk prior
to bottling. This is not to say that homebrew cannot be stored for long
periods, I have experience with a 1.040's brew that I did not start to 
drink for over 18 months but for the vast majority of my beers I like them
real fresh.

Lately my extract/partial grain brews have been coming out with good flavor but

Thanks for the many responses regarding software programs

was hoping for is for FREE software or shareware that can be 
stored in the archives.  The real utility will be seen when 
curious brewers can be directed to a readily available source 
that is universal.  A single source that is free will allow usage 
and review by a large group of brewers, thereby allowing the 
*group* to direct questions to a single proven resource .  This 
also eliminates arguments about which program is best and/or most 
accurate.  Maybe the spreadsheet program Don Put was talking 
about can be put in circulation?  I guess it depends on weather 
it was copyrighted or not.

Subject: Fat Tire recipe


For those of you interested in the Fat Tire ale recipes posted earlier,
I bumped into Jeff Lebesch of New Belgium the other night and asked him
about the use of wheat in Fat Tire.  He said he used maybe one-half to
one percent wheat in the grain bill (probably for adding some head
retention, in my guess), but no more.  So if you find a strong wheat
flavor in Fat Tire, you're either hypersensitive or hyperimaginative.
Unfortunately, I could not wheedle the rest of the recipe out of him, so
you'll have to reproduce it on your own :-).

I guess I should have said "Trappist-style" ales.  I didn't remember to
ask him about "trippel" vs "tripel", but I've always seen it spelled
with two p's.  Anyone have a definitive word on the "speling"?


ObBrewingHint:  
If you mash in a kettle on the stove, a quick and easy way to insulate
the pot during rests is to wrap a large beach towel around it after you
remove it from the burner.  Just tuck the towel under itself, as if you
were wrapping it around your waist, and it will stay on easily.  You
could also use this trick if you have to siphon your sweet wort into a
temporary holding vessel like a plastic bucket; insulating the bucket
will help to minimize temperature loss until you can get the wort into
the boiling kettle.

 Certainly not!  OK, I think I've used the same type of peppers in the 
 past.  If so, I boiled the dry peppers in just enough water to cover them 
 ( to get rid of any bugs) and added varying amounts of peppers to each 
 bottle.  The ideal (for me) was about 1 1/2 peppers per bottle.  It added a 
 beautiful deep red color to the beer, and  looked neat in the clear 
 bottles I used. It was plenty HOT!, but it sounds like this is what 
 you're after.  Hope this helps.

I recommend the "brewing campaign" method!  Generally, I brew between 
6-8 batches between January and March...I try very hard to let them ALL
age until the summertime (Late June)...Then you have batches of varying ages
from 3-6 months...with proper planning, I have always been able to make those 
brews last until September...a whole summer of homebrew, with no obligation
to brew more!  And I have always found that 6 months is a break point for
most of my beers (exceptions: Barley Wines, Spruce Beers, EXTREMELY Special
Bitters, etc...)


Back to the Water Chemistry issue...I really would like to see a FAQ on
this stuff...something simple: A list of beer styles and their appripriate
water composition, along with a brief list of what quantities of which
additives to use to make adjustments.  I don't have any experience in
the Chemistry field, but I will offer my time as a compiler of data.
So if you have particular knowledge that would be useful, e-mail it to me
and I'll do my best to compile it into a useful format.

Subject: Chimay Yeast/AHA-HWBTA


     I have cultured yeast from Chimay Grand Reserve and gotten decent
results. It took a few days for it to get going, and fermentation was not
what I would call real vigorous, but my resulting brew was great. What you
may want to do in the future is let the dregs & yeast come up closer to your
starter temp. The way I did mine was to pour the beer into a pitcher and
cover the bottle with a piece of plastic wrap. I then enjoyed the beer with
my wife, had a fine dinner, and then pitched my starter into the Chimay
bottle. Once that got going, I  added more starter every couple of days,
moving into bigger containers as necessary. I'm doing the same thing now with
a bottle of Chimay Red, which I pitched into a 500 ml Erhlenmeyer flask. I
started it on Saturday, and it really didn't do anything until sometime
yesterday. Once again, it didn't really develop a lot of krausen, but when
swirled, it came up nicely. I should really toss some more starter into it
now, but may not because I was just practicing my technique. Practice does
make perfect...
     Now, onto the AHA. I read the postings about the AHA pulling out of the
BJCP program. So what's it all mean? For starters, I can see more confusion
about just who is a bonafide judge, and confusion about who is sanctioning
any particular contest. I get the feeling that the AHA has people all lined
up to "take up" the slack come April. They'd better - the contest scene will
see a lot of screaming if they don't. Personally, I really don't enjoy formal
competitions. It can make you lose sight of what I feel is what we got into
brewing for in the first place - is my beer any good? Do you like it? Want
another?
I've seen judges trash people's brews, then a month later, have the same brew
and praise it to the high heavens. What's the point?
Once brewing organizations become too big, the quest for personal power
contaminates what was once a bunch of people who just enjoyed good beer. What
was once a hobby becomes a competitive business where there are no winners,
just combatants. Let'em all fight it out. I'll sit on the sidelines and have
a beer.

Subject: Stockpot Mash-Tun/Wyeast 1968 ESB


I just picked up a 30-quart (7.5 gallons for the conversion-challenged) 
stainless steel stockpot at a restaurant auction.  I was thinking about 
drilling it for an EasyMasher and graduating to all-grain recipes.


I know a lot of folks are using 10-gallon Gotts as mash-tuns, which 
leads me to a question.  Before I put bit to steel, is a 30-quart pot a 
big enough mash-tun for a 3-gallon batch?  How 'bout a 5-gallon batch?


If it helps, I typically brew pale ales and lagers -- no barley wines, etc.


===========
In HBD #1650, James Russ responded to Rich Lenihan's questions about 
Wyeast 1968 London Special ESB:
<snip>
:fermentation.  Like you described the visible signs of fermentation took ~36
:hours. This is the procedure I used.  After racking the wort into the primary
:I pitched about 2 ounces of yeast slurry and aerated the wort about 5 
:minutes each hour for 4 hours.  The beer started at 1.048 and fermented 
:out to 1.015 after 6 days; temp was approx. 68 deg. throughout fermentation.


Back in July, I posted a series of notes regarding my comparison of 
Wyeast 1968 with 1098 -- British Ale in a bare-bones pale ale recipe.  
Batch OG was 1.054.  I split the batch into 2 carboys.  They both kicked 
off right away.  24 hours later, the British was still burping away, but 
the ESB had quit.  The ESB had also completely floc'd out while the 
British yeast was still in solution.


The next day I racked both batches to secondary in an attempt to wake the 
ESB up.  SG at racking -- ESB - 1.022; British - 1.014.  The racking 
worked on the ESB; it re-started burping by the next day.  The British 
was quiet, though.


Fourteen days after brewing, I bottled, and to my surprise, both batches 
had the same FG -- 1.008.  To Norm Pyle's point on fermentation 
temperature in HBD #1651, my cellar was running around 68F (and in 
July -- isn't Michigan great for brewing?).


More importantly, in a blind tasting, both my wife and I were easily able 
to differentiate between the British and ESB ales.  The ESB had a more 
floral aroma and a sharper taste.  The British has more mouthfeel; a 
rounder, but less distinctive taste.

fermenter?  Or what?

Subject: HWBTA Nationals


     A friend of mine asked me to float this to y'all. He entered brews in
the HWBTA Nationals that took place Feb 3 - 5. Has anybody got the results?
Post it if ya got it, or private e-mail is fine.
     I don't know if the other post I sent today will make it the same time
as this, but I still have no interest whatsoever in competitions. 


     TIA for your help in aiding my computer illiterate (and proud of it...)
friend find out how he fared.

===> Ed Hitchcock comments about the odor of ozone:

Actually, ozone does have an odor.  It is the odor that one smells around
an electrical discharge.  That odor is not due ot other compounds produced
in the arc.  As you point out, ozone is also very hazardous.
