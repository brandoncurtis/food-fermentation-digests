 >I did my second mash yesterday using the Easy Masher *tm, and was very
 dissapointed when it came time to drain the cooled wort. The screen was
 so clogged up it wouldn't drain.... I can hear JS now telling me not to use 
 wheat or perhaps pellets, but I want to use these ingredients in my brewing. 
 
 Funny, I don't hear him saying anything like that.  More likely, I would say 
 do whatever works.  However, I can not imagine what wheat could have to do 
 with a clogging screen at that stage and I routinely use pellet hops, whole 
 hops and plugs with no problem.  The only problem I have ever had was with 
 Irish Moss and posted my experience at the time.
 
 Most folks have no problems using the EM after the boil but enough do to make 
 one wonder why and after much experience and feedback, I conclude that it has 
 more to do with technique than with any limitation on the product.
 
 The biggest problem is a lack of understanding of the way the EM works.  It 
 is NOT a strainer and any attempt to use it as one will end in failure.  The 
 EM simply prevents large particles from glogging the line and the spigot.  
 The filtering/straining is done by the grain bed or in the case of post boil, 
 by a similar situation set up by the hops and trub.
 
 The wort must be allowed to settle and never disturbed while draining.  
 Stirring or scraping will lead to the problems you reported.  Everyone has 
 their own technique but I have found the following  worked well for me:
 
 After the boil, I would drop in the chiller and let it air cool for about 30 
 mins, then turn on the water and by the time the wort was chilled, I could 
 draw it off through the EM without problems.  My wort chiller is now 
 installed in the lid of my boiler so my procedure is a bit different but the 
 above never failed me.

etc.  Has anyone tried overpriming with sugar, and then simply boiling to

I use an enamel on stell canning pot for kettle mashing/lautering. I believe 
its capacity is 22 quarts. I can just barely get 10 pounds of grain in it with 
1.5 quarts/gallon of mash water. I then collect the sweet wort in a 32 quart 
enamel on steel pot for boiling. I believe you would have no problem mashing up 
to 12 or so pounds in a 30 quart pot. At 80% efficiency, that gets you a 
gravity up around 1.070 for a 5 gallon batch. No (all-grain) barleywines or 
dopplebocks, but almost anything else.


If you want to use the same pot for mashing and boiling, you must use an 
intermediate container to store the sweet wort during the sparge.

In HBD1653 rnantel`at`ibm.net asks for improvements to a Guinness Stout 
recipie to better achieve the authentic "sour" taste.


I vaguely remember reading somewhere that this sour taste is 
achieved, not in the brewing process, but by actually blending the 
stout beer with a little bit of "bad" / contaminated beer.  Other 
than this, I don't remember any details.  Does this sound familiar to 
anyone else? Or am I completely confused?  I'll try to find where I

<...how about a 5 gal batch?


For 13 gal batches we've used about 8 gal worth of a 15 gal
tub, and assuming you went 2.5-3 gal of mash liquor with the
balance in sparge liquor, you shuld have plenty of working
room for the 5 gal batches--there's no boiling involved here
so you can go to the limit on the actual mash tun capacity.
Even with a substantially raised false bottom I'd say this is
a roomy pot.

Actually, I think it makes more sense in this form, which is in the Hops FAQ:


ADJUSTMENT = 1 + ((BOIL_GRAVITY - 1.050) / 0.2)


I think I'll work on this area in the next revision, to clear it up a bit.
BTW, didn't Zymurgy print a correction to that article?  I think I have

I tend to agree with you Randy, with a couple of caviats:  1) if the yeast
has been given a proper chance (i.e. large pitching rate, oxygen, etc.), and
2) if the recipe is fairly simple.  I've found some beers that I underpitched
took some time to "finish", to dry out, so they improved over time.  I've
also found that some very complex recipes improve dramatically with age as
the flavors meld.  I had an old ale go from "a bunch of interesting, and
isolated flavors" to "a complex flavor sensation wherein any one flavor was
nearly indistinguishable".  This beer had unmalted wheat, molasses, corn
starch, caramel from cane sugar, pale malt, special B, crystal, and ???.  The
transition was remarkable as all of this stuff came together as one.  This
beer sort of straddled the line between "higher strength" and "normal"
gravities, at around 1.060.


**


Julie, red beers *are* the latest fad, that's all.  Its a positive sign
though, since for most people beer is yellow, so maybe there is hope.  Make
a nice amber ale with a quality crystal malt and a bit of Belgian Special B
and you'll have a good copper colored beer, much better than any of the fad
beers.

Jeff Hewit asks about dry hopping.  All I can say Jeff, is you have to try it
yourself.  Start with a style that suits it, like a pale ale / bitter / amber
ale, and a recipe you've done before.  I've found that 1/2 ounce of Cascades
in a 5 gallon batch is plenty of aroma, but that EKGoldings for example, can
be used at well over 1 ounce per 5 gallons without being "too much".  Use
whole hops and throw them loose into the secondary fermenter (I use a funnel
to get them in the neck of a carboy).  You could reduce your finishing hops,
yes, if you like, but it's not a requirement.  You could also split the batch
and dry hop half (I've done this) to compare the two.  Try it, you'll like
it!

I found it interesting in the NHC proceedings that Jeff was apologizing for
using the name "Abbey" on this beer (that is the full name of this beer).
Apparently even the word "abbey", not just "trappist", is some sort of
protected or otherwise special name in Belgium.

The difference between 1/2" and 3/8" tubing will 
obviously be the change in the amount of Wort in 
contact with the tubing wall.  I used 3/8" with 
mine, mainly because of the bending issue, and it 
works fine.  The legnth of the tubing is actually 
more  important for efficiancy.  You want to be 
sure that there is enough contact time given in the 
wort to allow the exit temperature of the water to 
approach the wort temp (of course you could just use 
a lot of water). 


If you are really concerned about efficiency, then a 
counterflow is the only way to go!  I am currently 
building mine, I just need to get the plastic welded.

I think this is valuable to all, so I am also copying to the Digest.
If you are a beginning brewer, you should go out in your area and talk
to supply shops about how to get started, what equipment would be
right for you, and any other questions you can ask.  When you find one
you feel comfortable with and *trust*, validate what they have told
you in TNCJHB and here in HBD.  If they have been straight with you,
buy your initial equipment and ingredients from them.  You now have
someone local to call and get an answer *right now* during your first
brew.  Don't take unfair advantage of this, read a lot and be prepared
on your own.  But a person on the other end of the phone line can
often be a lot more helpful than several back and forths to the
digest, and frankly Email is too slow when you have a problem on brew
day.  Also, brew at a time when the shop is open!!


Once you know what you are doing, then begin to look for mail order
suppliers and bargains and items which your local supplier does not
carry.  I still go to my local supplier for my grain, but frankly,
when he charges $40 for a soda keg, I can't pass up $5 kegs from a
scrap yard.  Or when he does not carry the yeast I want to use, I have
to go elsewhere.  A good relationship with a local supplier is very
valuable, so keep it fresh by buying there regularly.

The higher the surface area to cross sectional volume ratio, the
better, which suggests 3/8".  Actually 1/4" would be better, but
people have posted that they have trouble with getting enough flow
through it.  What I found with the 3/8" chiller I have is that the
cooling speeded up drastically when the wort is stirred continuously
or the chiller is jiggled continuously.  My arms get tired of doing
this, so I made a 160RPM gearmotor driven paddle which goes through
the lid of my pot.  I put the paddle in the boiling wort at the same
time as the chiller to sanitize both of them.

Subject: Guinness recipes/ Red Ales/ Dry Hops


In HBD #1653:


Richard Nantel asked about Guinness recipe improvements. I
wish you'd asked a week ago - I just tried and extract
version last night. I was inspired by the sour mashing
discussion, so I followed Charlie Papazzian's notation in
TNCJOHB that Guinness adds 3% soured beer to their stouts.
The day night before brew-night I made up 20 oz of 1.040
wort using dark British DME and a little roast barley. When
this cooled to 90 F I threw in a tablespoon of yoghurt. It
was just getting sour when I brewed 24 hours later - I wish
I'd waited 48 hours. I added the soured mash to the brew
kettle in a 5 gallon batch. Any thoughts on this approach?


Miller's recipe calls for "15 AAUs hops (high alpha)". I
have two different sources (Dave Line and Fred Eckhardt)
that Guinness uses Bullion hops for bittering (the classic
hop for stouts). Line also suggests some Northern Brewer for
the full boil while Eckhardt suggested some Goldings for
"aroma" (I think he means flavor). 


**********


Julie Espy asks about red brews. You're right on both
counts, Julie. In some beers it makes a difference, while in
others it's only marketing. Red Dog isn't even red. You can
add some red color to your favorite brew by adding an ounce
or two of roasted barley. You can also use a small amount of
chocolate or black patent malt. Steep the grains in 150 degF
water for 20 minutes to 1/2 hour before adding them to the
kettle. The small amount of roasted barley will add a lovely
red hue and a tiny amount of roast flavor to the beer. 


**********


Jeff Hewit asks about dry hopping. When you add aroma hops
at the end of the boil you end up driving off much of the
aroma in the primary fermentation - the delicate volatiles
are carried off with the large volume of CO2 produced. As a
starting point you might try taking half your aroma hops and
adding them to the secondary. Experiment a little. I usually
use both; in fact, I often use 4 or 5 different hop
additions in my ales including dry hopping to add
complexity. The result is a much more "rounded" hop flavor
and aroma. Good luck!


Cheers,


Gary

Well, I think this is of general interest, so here goes:


I leave my beer in the secondary for anywhere from 4 weeks to 6 months.  My 
basement doesn't get above 60 and stays around 50 in the winter.  Carboys are 
covered and the airlocks levels kept at the right levels (dry basement could 
let all the water evaporate if not checked).


I have never added more yeast, and natural bottle carbonation has never been a
problem.  One week at regular room temps is enough, always.  Bottles then go 
back to the cold basement.


As another data point, I made a sparkling mead that finished active 
fermentation in a month or so, then stayed in carboys for the next 13 months, 
clearing.  Again, no extra yeast was needed at bottling time (I added one cup 
of honey, heated up, which was probably too much) and bottles were carbonated 
in a week at room temp (around 70F).


Now I have no experience lagering at 35F, so I can't say how the yeast will be
affected.  Also, rapid temperature changes can affect yeast flocculation as 
well.  But, in general, my experience has been that extended aging in a 
secondary is no reason to add more yeast.

Howdy
  Lately, actually, since I moved, I've been experiencing 'soda-pop' 
heads on some of my brews.  You know, the kind of head where the head 
subsides immediately to the surface and you are left with the wee dancing 
bubbles on the surface of the beer.  Not all bottles are like this, but 
most of them are.  Its NOT the glass as i have been using my favourite 
beer glasses for years, and I do know how to properly wash them.. I think 
that it may be something with the water in the new town, as it is the 
only difference from old brews.  Any thoughts out there?
  A late note on coffee beers-- when I want some I put an ounce of fresh 
espresso in the bottom of my 16 ounce bottles before I fill them.  That 
way I can make as many coffee beers as I like to ( they can get to be a 
bit over indulgent at times ).
  Thanks

Subject: Carbonates in Burton water/Down-Under




While responding to Jeff Stampes kind offer of compiling water chemistry
information I realized that I was missing an important parameter in my
quest for a Fuller's ESB clone.  The Ca++, SO4--, Mg++, Na+, and Cl-
concentrations are well known and published, but I have never seen values
published for carbonates.  Since the brewing water of Burton-upon-trent
comes not from the Trent River but from wells in what I think is a
limestone region one would expect that the carbonate levels are pretty
high.  In fact the carbonate levels of the municipaility of
Burton-upon-trent (which is not river water - so I assume it's ground
water) is: 
                                                                          
                                   Min   Mean   Max
    Alkalinity     (as CaCO3)       82   95.7   108
    Total hardness (as CaCO3)      196  211.6   225
    Perm hardness  (as CaCO3)       99  115.9   132


Other values such as Ca++ and SO4-- are not:


                                   Min   Mean  Max
    Calcium                         52   58.3   63
    Sulphate (as SO4)               95   97.4   99


If anyone knows whether these carbonate values are valid or knows the 
actual values for the likes of Fuller's, Bass, or other Burton style 
ales, please respond by private email.




Also, let me publically thank Dave and Cheryl Draper, Ken and Eva Willing
who welcomed me into their home, Andy Walsh, and Chris Pittock for 
giving me a very enjoyable dinner and evening of beer and beer talk.  
Dinner a la Willing, Beef Bourignon over rice, garden salad, and 
potatoes(?) was wonderful, as was the Chocolate stout cake a la Pittock 
(who drove 4 hours from Melbourne).  The beers were good and a 
welcome relief from the likes of Fosters, Victoria Bitters, and XXXX.  
Collectively these four men have an enviable wealth of brewing knowledge 
and experience and I would not be surprised if one or more ended up at 
the forefront of craft brewing down under.  Thanks again and I will be 
returning.

Sorry about the following extensive use of bandwidth, but I haven't been able
to brew in SEVERAL months, and am now REAL ORNERY!


IN HDB #1653...


 -=> Mike Spinelli asks about using 3/8" or 1/2" tubing for his chiller...


I used 3/8" for mine. I felt the smaller cross section would be more easily
cooled than the larger one. Also, by using the smaller diameter, a greater
volume of water can flow outside of the tubing. Allows you to use a smaller
diameter outer hose, too.


I have bent 1/2" tubing into coils with no kinking problems - Get a section of
PVC pipe of the desired diameter, punch a hole in the side, put the end of
your tube in the hole, then roll the pipe (or bucket, or whatever) along the
length of your tubing to coil it up. Works like a charm! Did this from a post
on *P*.


OK. No more Mr. Niceguy!


 -=> Schmidling's insecurity?


How many have bought a Jack Schmidling product, only to find it _PACKED_ with
advertisements impugning his competition? I just got a MaltMill (from those
wonderful people at Maltose Express <free plug>) and found _two_ sheets
extolling the virtues of the MM, and telling me how horrible, useless, and
ill-conceived the Glatt and Philmill are! C'mon, Jack! I already bought the
damned thing! Get a life! (And GROW UP!!!)


 -=> Regarding the recent hullabaloo in the organized brewing world, I feel it
    necessary to suck up bandwidth with this excerpt (edited) from an e-mail
    to a fellow brewer after he unwittingly suggested I look to the AOB for
    some information (or so I had thought)...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Now, for your reading pleasure, I'm going to unload; ranting and raving about
the current state of affairs in the brewing world... >:-()}


AOB, AHA, etc. want far too much of my hard-earned dollars for their books,
and I usually find them to be less than what I would have expected - little
more than just one more person's surmissions and opinions with little or no
empirical data (Oh, yeah - with recipes included...). And even less basis in
fact. Hell, I just spent $21.50 for _four_ Brewing Techniques back issues to
get the rest of that series they're doing on yeast (guess there's one more
coming...). A little rich for magazines. The yeast series is good, but there
is plenty of assinine BS in the mag as well. Hardly worth the new and improved
$6.00 cover price. (and I _LIKE_ BT. Oughta hear what I have to say about the
AHA's means of shoving advertisements down our throats - Zymurgy...)


Another case in point: Garetz's 'Using Hops'. When it first came out, it was
considered God's gift to hop-heads. Now, not enough can be said about how
poorly Garetz researched his material, and how <Expletive deleted> up he is.
Turns out it was just his opinion; and now someone else's (Rager's) opinion is
(back) en vogue. Sorry. I'm a little too technically oriented to accept that
kind of crap from a set of demi-professional organizations. These are the same
organizations that want to judge the appropriateness of our choice of brewing
ingredients and techniques to a set of stylistic parameters - which now appear
to be unknowns. Apparently, they don't know their <Expletive deleted> from
holes in the ground if these ongoing arguments are any indication. Starting to
remind me too much of this place (work).


And, the industry's expensive paperback books are, IMHO, inexcusable. Hell,
even that stupid little book entitled "How To Build A Home Brewery" (about 40
pages) is $7.00 to $9.95. And it is (also IMHO) worthless information. Those
who have bought it (and I'm guilty. Bought it in a moment of weakness with no
review. Regretted it ever since...) found very little useable information, and
a recipe for 'ten day beer'. Worthless.


I can understand raising money for 'furthering the cause', but you don't do it
by making the information too expensive for most people to acquire. And you
don't attract membership by continuously contradicting yourself, either.

it impales no-one, will not be reprinted here.)

Subject: dryhopping / rosemary


Howdy,


In HBD 1653, Jeff Hewit asks about dryhopping, a subject near & dear to my
heart.  When I dryhop, I use it in addition to all the other hoppings in my
beer, but then again, I want a hoppy beer when I dryhop.  I usually use an
ounce of pellets at about 4.4% a.a., mostly East Kent Goldings.  The last
pale ale I dryhopped had 1/4 oz EKG, 1/4 oz Liberty, & 1/4 oz Williamette
in a 4 gallon batch, which gave it a grassy type of hop aroma.  I think if
I mix hops again, I'll lean more to the Liberty & less on the Williamette.
But I really like EKG.


So, some of you are probably wondering, "Why did he just do 4 gallons?"
Well, since you asked, it was a 5 gallon batch, but I seperated out a gallon
when racking into the secondary & "dry-rosemaried" it.  I got the idea from
Pike Place, which has an oregano beer.  However, my wife squenched her nose
& said "Do rosemary instead."  I pulled some oregano & rosemary out of the
cabinet, grabbed a reserve bag of hops out of the freezer, & did a sniff
test, & sure enough, the rosemary was much nicer than the oregano when sniffed
with hops.  So, I put in fresh rosemary leaves from a six-inch twig in the
one gallon secondary & let it sit for a week.  It came out nice, but the
rosemary may be a little too subtle, being overbalanced by the hops.  However,
the two aromas & flavors blend well together, & I'm looking forward to trying
it again, perhaps with an 8 inch twig.


I named it "Rosemary's Baby".

                      2-row or not 2-row?
On a recent visit to my local homebrew store, the owner told me that he had
received, by mistake, a bag of Munton and Fison 6-row lager malt. He had no
need for this and couldn't return it, so he offered to sell it for U$25. I
figured I could live with the hastles of mashing 6-row for that kind of
price. However, this stuff *looks* identical to the 2-row Briess I have, and
nowhere on the bag does it say "6-row", so I'm wondering if it is, in fact,
2-row. Is there a great difference in the size of the kernels or some obvious
way to tell 2- from 6-row? The bag was merely labelled "whole/lager batch 862
3217 BBE Aug 94 176707".  I'd appreciate any help I can get in figuring this
out.


Also, someone (can't remember the name - sorry) recently expressed concern
about the incompatability of a plastic false bottom with a steam injection
system. I haven't mashed with mine yet, but last night I tested my it by
heating three gallons of water from RT (55F) to 170F. It took a little less
than an hour and, since no grains were holding the false bottom down, it
floated up to directly contact the copper tube. No problems whatsoever. I'm
very excited about this weekend's batch, and will let ya'll in on the
results.


Gosh,  de-lurking was even easier than the jump to all-grain. I wonder why I
waited  so long?

I have not used polyclar in any lagers, but I had no problems with carbonation
in a recent ale I fined with polyclar, nor did I have any problems with
carbonation in a lager that sat in the primary (at 45F) for 2 weeks and
the secondary (also at 45F) for 8 or 9 weeks.  In neither of these beers
did I add more yeast at bottling time (what the Belgian brewers call
"repitching").  Note that these beers were 1040 OG and 1075 OG respectively,
and that for much-higher gravity beers, pitching more yeast at bottling time
might be a good idea (since the primary fermentation yeast may be sluggish
due to high alcohol).


If it will help you relax, you can add more yeast, but if you do, I recommend
that you pitch the same strain you used for the main fermentation.  If you
happen to pitch a more attenuative yeast, you may have overcarbonation.

Traditionally, Tripels are brewed using pale Candi Sugar, which I've read is
almost entirely sucrose.  In my opinion, I would say that white table sugar
would be the closest.  When it comes to dark Candi Sugar, that's a tougher
problem, but from tasting it, I would say it is not much more than caramelized
sucrose... NOT brown sugar!  So, carefully heating a sucrose solution till it
turns to colour of pancake syrup would be the closest approximation, IMO.

From: "Thomas Aylesworth" <t_aylesworth`at`lfs.loral.com>
Subject: First All-Grain


Sorry - I know these questions have been asked before, but I can't find
a Mashing FAQ anywhere and my attempt to search the HBD archives using
the keyword "mash" produced more than I could get through in a lifetime.


Anyway, I did my first all-grain brew this past week-end, after doing a
years worth of partial mashes.  It went pretty well - much better than
my first partial mash did.  I made an Oatmeal Porter and was shooting
for an og of 1.050.  The grist consisted of 77.5% Klages, 10% Oats, 5%
Crystal, 5% Carapils, and 2.5% Black Malt.  I did my mash on the stove
in a 5 gallon pot using 13 quarts of water.  I did a protein rest with 
a strike temperature of 126F, which went right to 122F as Miller predicted.
The protein rest lasted half an hour, after which I slowly brought it up
to 155F (slowly because my thermometer doesn't react quickly and I wanted
to make sure I didn't overshoot).  I checked it and stirred it every 15
minutes, keeping the temperature between 150-155F, for an hour.  In the
meantime I heated 4.5 gallons of sparge water.  I didn't bother checking
for starch conversion, and after an hour, brought the mash up to 168F
and did a 5 minute mash-out.  I used Phil's Lautering System, so after
the mash-out, I carefully transferred the mash to the lauter bucket.
Unfortunately, I didn't do it carefully enough, and the hose came out
from under the false bottom, so I had to transfer it back to the pot and
then back to the bucket.  This certainly caused the temperature to drop
somewhat, and, I guess, could lead to some oxidation of the wort, but
wasn't a complete disaster.  The next problem came from the fact that
during all of this, I let the sparge water get almost to the boiling
point.  I let it cool a little while I was recirculating the wort in
the lauter tun, but it still was over 180F when I started to sparge.
Also, I didn't acidify the sparge water as Miller recommended (I meant
to, but forgot).  I sparged into a 6 gallon bucket with a spigot, which
wasn't quite large enough, so I had to put the last runnings into a
pot.  The reason for sparging into the bucket rather than the boiler,
is that I don't have a pot that big.  Rather than replace my 5 gallon
boiler with an 8 gallon boiler, I just bought another 5 gallon pot to
do this.  8 gallon stainless steel pots are very expensive, and I'm not
sure my gas stove could bring 7 gallons of wort to a good boil anyway.
So, I sparged into the bucket, stirred it well to mix the heavy first
runnings with the thin later runnings, and then used the spigot to
divide the wort into my two boilers (3.5 gallons per boiler).  I was
able to get an excellent boil from both of them, and boiled for 90 
minutes.  Because I started the second boil about 15 minutes after the
first one, I was able to chill the first one while the second finished.
Thanks to the 20F outside temperature, and the fact that I was only
chilling 2.5 gallons at a time, I was able to bring each of them down
to below 75F in under 15 minutes.  I then pitched a quart starter of
Wyeast 1056 that I had started just 2 days earlier and shook it like the 
dickens to aerate it.  It started bubbling immediately, and has been
going slow but steady in my 60F basement ever since then.


Anyway, my questions are:


 - Water treatment:  I merely boiled all the water (10 gallons) the
  night before.  I guess this is one of the next areas I should work
  on.  Can someone point me to a good book or article(s) that describe
  this?  Miller goes into this somewhat, but not a great deal.


 - Protein rest:  From what I have read (mostly books and articles by
  Miller), the protein rest is necessary if using "high-protein" grains,
  such as wheat and oats.  It should not be done if using British Pale
  Ale Malt.  Beyond that, he seems to waver, seeming to say that it is
  a good idea anyway, but not necessary.  Does this sound right?  Also,
  what, exactly, is meant by "high-protein".  My homebrew shop labels
  the protein content of all the grains they sell on the bag - what
  numbers should I be looking for to tell me that I should do a protein
  rest.  I am planning on doing a basic pale ale next, using mostly
  Klages and some Crystal malt.  Should I bother doing a protein rest?


 - Sparge water:  From a few posts here, it doesn't sound like the fact
  that my sparge water was a little hotter than it should have been is
  necessarily bad.  True or not?  Also, how big a problem is it that I
  didn't acidify the sparge water?  Miller claims that both of these
  problems can lead to extracting unwanted tannins from the grain husks -
  I guess I should not be surprised if I have some harsh flavors in my
  beer.


 - Sparge:  My sparge only lasted about 25 minutes.  Numbers I've seen
  here before seem to be much longer than this.  Should I slow down the
  rate, or does it not matter?


 - Boilers:  Has anyone else tried using two boilers before?  It seems
  like such an obvious idea, I'm surprised I haven't seen it mentioned
  here before.  The only problem I can see is that I move it from my
  bucket into the boilers via a spigot - which could cause oxidation
  of the hot wort.  How big a problem is that at this stage?  If it is
  a potential problem, I could ladle the wort into the boiler.


 - Yeast starter:  My starter didn't really have a big krausen on it
  when pitched.  This isn't related to all-grain brewing, obviously, but
  I was wondering what the accepted wisdom is here.  In the past, I have
  started my liquid yeasts earlier in the week so that they were done
  fermenting by time I pitched.  Which is better, and why?


 - Efficiency:  At what point exactly is this measured?  After the boil,
  I had slightly more than 5 gallons of wort with a gravity of 1.060 -
  much higher than I expected.  Plugging this into the formula I have
  seen here gives me 5*60/10 = 30 pt/lb/gallon.  Actually, it was very
  slightly higher than this, since I had a little more than 5 gallons
  and the gravity was actually 1.061 after adjusting for temperature.
  Anyway, does this sound right?  I am a little surprised I got such a
  good extraction considering it was my first time.  BTW - the wort
  volume (5 gallons) was the volume before racking off the hop sludge
  and break material.  I ended up losing about a quart, so I only had
  about 4.75 gallons in my fermenter, which I didn't bother to top up.


Well, sorry for such a long post and for rehashing questions that have
probably been asked a billion times.  I find this to be an excellent 
forum, and appreciate any help I get!

   First of all, I don't think there are screw lids available for plastic
   fermenters, the lids that come with the fermenters fit lousy and leak,
   so, go to a large paint store, and buy a 5 gal bucket for about $2, the
  lid that comes with the bucket has a nice screw bung for access and lock
  tabs that seal eiser and better than fermenter lids, AND, they're food
  grade.
  Bud/coors clone, take a 3 lb. light DME, do a 5 gal batch with just the 3
  lbs. of DME, use only a few hop pellets, add a drop of dish soap at 
  bottling to insure you get a quality NO-Head brew, and if that is still to
  heavy, add 4 gals of water to thin the brew to the water like state of
  the mega swill.
   Pardon my waste of bandwith, now for my 20 bandwidth sig. sign off!!
