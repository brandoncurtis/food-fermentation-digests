 -=> There is an on-going discussion about IBUs and hop utilizations...


A point I feel is being missed in the current discussion regarding whose hop
utilization formulas should be golden on what day, I think we are missing the
point of having them at all. The benefit, IMHO, is that having a consistent
method of determining IBUs will assist in duplicating the results of a
recipe's author when attempting to do so. Miller's method, in his TCHBOHB, of
saying to use xx IBUs of XXXX hops is a good start as samples of any one
specific hop variety taken from different sources (be that 'source'
geographical, conditional, or temporal) are not created equal. Perhaps the
nextlogical step on this path would be to add the author of the equation used
to determine the IBUs of the resulting brew.


Calibrating your pallet; or using your own utilization equation or method are
irrelevant when brewing an unfamiliar beer style from a written source. Having
hops quoted per expected contribution to the overall bitterness, given the
calculation used, will.


Just my opinion.


 -=> In HBD 1660, Art McGregor asks about his contaminated starters.


The acidity of your beer aids in combating infection. Your starter worts, on
the other hand, do not have that capability. More than likely you will
experience no problems using your sanitation methods for bottling your beer
(as you reportedly haven't had any problems to date). I do, however, boil my
caps a little longer than that. Usually around 15 minutes. It may be brewers
superstition, but somewhere I came up with a rule of thumb that, if it has to
be boiled, it has to be boiled at least 15 minutes.


Adding hops is said to help. Refrigeration, in this case, would just delay the
action of the offending beasties. They'd still be there, just colder.


I use canning methods to prepare my starters using a 15 minute pressure canner
boil at 15 psi. You can do the same with a longer boil in a water-bath canner
(ie: your brewpot). Just make sure the water boils, that it does so for about
a half an hour, and that the mason jars are under at least two inches of
water. I've never experienced an infection in one of these rascals...


 -=> In HBD 1661 Algis Korzonas comments on the CO2 keg to Beer Keg gravity tap
    method...


Is my face red... Algis, you are quite correct. ;-) The post did read very
'blue sky'. And the CO2 will eventually diffuse with the incoming air.
However, this is really no different than the preventative methods we use to
avoid oxidation while racking (following a CO2 purge); unless, of course, you
are using a totally closed system. More 'containment' than prevention.


To further thoughts on this subject, my 'CO2 keg' is equipped with a pressure
relief valve which remained open only for dispensing beer, and for
're-purging' with CO2 in effect, enriching the CO2 environment contained
inside - this contributed greatly to my success with this method.


I apologize to anyone who may have read more into the method than was intended
(and I nod to A.K.). The laws of statistical physics, regrettably, still
apply.


 -=> Matt K asks about B-Brite...


In its less costly form, B-Brite is known as Arm & Hammer Super Washing Form.
Sodium Carbonate, for the most part.


 -=> Tom Gehrmann asks whether to buy a ss or an enamel pot...


My vote goes to the ss. Easier to clean, and won't rust if you chip it.

Subject: Dual kettle IBU calculation


 Hello everyone,
  I've got a question I've been pondering for some time now. It envolves 
 calculating IBU when boiling in 2 different kettles. I don't have the
 cash to invest in a 7.5gal kettle so I have to use my existing 16 and
 20 quart brew-pots to brew my all-grain batches. My method now consists
 of filling both pots up and boiling the wort down so that the entire batch
 will fit into the 20 quart pot. Once done, I take a hydrometer reading so
 I can calculate an accurate IBU reading. Because the batch will equal 5.5
 gallons in the end I use that as my volume amount. This seems to work
 very well as my beers all come out balanced. My question is this:


  If I hop the two batches separatly, but together, how do I calculate the
 IBU for the total batch when the SG of the two kettles are different. Can
 I take two hydrometer readings and plug them into the equation using
 5.5 gallons as the total? Would the total IBU then be equal to the sum of
 both batches?

Hi all!


I went into lurking mode for the last several months due to the unexpected
time demands of opening my homebrew supply store.  But now that everything 
is underway, and I am down to a resonable 70 hours a week, I seem to have 
a little time to become more active in the digest :-)  


Several people wrote to me for info about opening a store while I was 
trying to get everything up and running.  However, in the transfer of
computer equipment I lost all my old mail.  So, if you asked me some 
questions and I rudely ignored you please ask again. 


First my question,
I am confused about the Great Western Malt.  I know (?) that it is 50% 
klages. However, I have seen Klages refered to as both a pale and a lager
malt.  I know that Klages is a barley strain not a malt variety.  However, 
is it made into both Pale and Lager malts?  I have ordered it as both and
I seem to get the same bags of malt from Great Western so I am a little
confused.

How does this relate to the Party Pig?  Have people noticed their beer
getting stale during storage in a Pig?

B-Brite is a santizer/cleanser which cleans with active oxygen.  It also 
contains sodium carbonate and sodium silicate.


It is a product of Crosby and Baker whom your supplier should know about.


If your supplier carries one-step cleanser this can be used as a substitute
as they are nearly identical in my understanding.

This is really interesting.  "Brew Your own Real Ale at Home"
was written at the same time Graham's book "Home Brewing, the Camra Guide" 
was updated.  If fact, they were published at the same time.  In "Home
Brewing", Graham writes:


"The dropping system is an alternative to the single vessel fermentation 
system.  With this system, when the beer has fermented a day or two, it
is "dropped" into a secondary fermentation vessel leaving the dirty primary
yeast head, mutant yeast cells, trub, and other debris behind....The
advantages of the dropping system are that the dirty primary yeast head 
and the debris on the bottom of the vessel gets left behind, and the yeast
gets thoroughly roused.  However, a good many active yeast cells are also
left behind on the bottom of the vessel, and some highly flocculant yeast 
strains *require* re-aeration to encourage the yeast to multiply and restore
the yeast count to resonable levels [emphasis mine]. It is this re-aeration 
that is the stumbling block for many home brewers due to the fear of airborne
infection.  It is true that re-aeration goes against the normal rules of 
sound home-brewed beer, but it is my view that the advantages of the dropping 
system outweigh its risk......[the dropping should be done after the yeast 
has gone anaerobic, about 36 hours after pitching. Or when roughly half the 
fermentable material has been used]...It is safe to run the beer from the 
primary vessel to the secondary vessel via the tap because aeration is 
required.....Alternatively, the beer can be siphoned from one vessel to 
another and re-aeration performed [by pouring the wort from one fermentation
bin to another a few times, generating plenty of violent, mechanical, 
sloshing action.]"


So either Graham simply forgot to update this section of "Home Brewing" 
or he simply didn't feel that "Brew Your Own Real Ale..." was the proper
book to introduce such a controversial topic.  He does spend much more time
discussing "dropping" in "Home Brewing" than in "Brew Your ..." so I would
tend to belive that he simply didn't want to make "Brew Your..." too
confusing.+


If and when I have the time I will try a split batch to explore the 
advantages or dissadvantages of dropping with aeration and without.
It would seem that it would only be advantageous for highly flocculant 
yeast.  Graham does mention that "It is probably true that the performance
of some yeast strains is improved by dropping whereas other yeast strains
object to it.  I have always used the dropping system and have never had 
difficulty."


Well, sorry about such a long post.  I seem to have been more anxious to 
rejoin the fold than I thought.

Subject: Dropping = Racking?! / My new Web Page


Hi Group,
I was just reading Saturdays HBD and saw Jim Caves post on Wheeler.
Do you mean to tell me that we have been getting excited about racking to a
secondary fermenter for Ales!?  No wonder it greatly improves the beer! I
have been using a secondary since my second batch and havent looked back.
We have had discussions of Single vs Two Stage Fermentation before with
pros on both sides, but I have always thought I got a smoother clearer beer
out of Two Stage.


Here I was wondering if Dropping was something new. Did everybody else
realize this? Am I the last one again? At least I didnt fall for the
Coriander thread.
**
By the Way, I have hit the 90% mark on my new Web page located at:
www.primenet.com/~johnj/
It is the Palmer House Brewery and Smithy and contains my How to Brew file,
will contain my other writings on zymurgical metallurgy, has my winning
Chili recipe, and my How to make Chainmail Armor files (if you are
interested). Parts of it are still under construction and I am running out
of weekend.

I encountered the same problem when trying to come up with a formula on a
post several months ago.  I found that everyone is using different
utilization percentages.  A book I read by (Englishman) Graham Wheeler stated
that most homebrewers get a maximum of only ~20% utilization.  This seemed to
work for me based on previous batches.  (I adjust for gravity, time).


What percentage rates were used for the different ibu's given in your post?
 Also, I have read several places that there is no significant increase in
utilization after a 60 minute boil.  Have you found otherwise?

        The text from "Brew Your Own Real Ale At Home" has, to a great extent,
been condensed from Graham Wheeler's first book "Home Brewing - The CAMRA
Guide" which I consider to be more complete. Here's what he has to say in
this book....


        "The advantages of the dropping system are that the dirty primary
yeast head and the debris on the bottom of the vessel gets left behind, and
the yeast gets thoroughly roused. However, a good many active yeast cells
are also left behind on the bottom of the vessel, and some highly flocculant
yeast strains require re-aeration to encourage the yeast to multiply and
restore the yeast count to reasonable levels. It is this re-aeration that
is the stumbling block for many home brewers due to the fear of airborne
infection. It is true that re-aeration goes against the normal rules of
sound home-brewed beer, but it is my view that the advantages of the
dropping system outweigh its risks".


        Having read this for the first time in many months, I can see that
the wording is "....some highly flocculant yeast strains require re-aeration..."
and not that it should be done as a matter of course as I have been suggesting
in the past. This was a mis-interpretation by myself when I originally read
the section many months ago and resulted in me re-aerating everytime. In saying
that though, I have discovered that the British ale strains that I use, tend to
cope with re-aeration well and so I will continue to re-aerate as a matter of
course. What is interesting is that my two favourite strains so far (Wyeast
and Yeast Lab's British Ale strains) are supposedly only medium-flocculant
according to Zymurgy Summer 1994 and that the only yeast that I have had
trouble with (Wyeast #1007 German Ale) is supposedly highly-flocculant as
detailed in the same article - go figure!


Cheers,
        Brian

Extending your mash times will not neccesarrily increase your
extract.  If your using well modified malt and you're treating your
water properly(Beta-amylase works best when the water is slightly
acidic)in addition to a relatively thin mash(1:3.5 or so), then the

Subject:       Re: BJCP Judge Rank Questions


Jim Powell asks about the BJCP:


Good questions Jim.  As some of you know, alot of these are subject 
to change but here's what's current (to tyhe best of my knowlege):


> What is the BJCP?


The BJCP is the Beer Judgce Certification Program started jointly by 
the AHA and the HWBTA as a means of providing quality judging and 
helpfull feedback to brewers entering their efforts into 
sanctioned/recognized competition.


> How does one become a judge?


Practice, practice, practice! ;)  Alot of studying up on the worlds 
beer styles, sampling commercial examples and experience are the best 
ways.  Most start judging local contests and stewarding at larger 
ones to gain experience/knowlege and to prepare for the examination.


The current certification examination is a gruelling 3 hour essay 
test with 4 tastings thrown in for good measure.  The test is 
formidable but it does help to ensure that the feedback ou receive 
from your entries into a competition is helpfull and hopefully 
correct (we're human too).


> How does a judge go about obtaining the next highest rank?


You must score a certain level on the exam to be eligible to rise to 
the next level and have the appropriate level of experience points 
which are awarded by judging at, stewarding at or organizing 
competitions.


> Are there classes to take; fees to pay?


Many clubs hold preparation classes but the bulk of the knowlege you 
must get on your own through personal study and experience.  


The fee for 1st time takers of the exam is currently $50 and $30 for 
re-takes.  There are currently no yearly dues or maintenance fees.
> Is there an anual membership fee for a judge to maintain his present rank?


Again, not currently.  All that is required is that you continue to 
judge competitions that present themselves.  There is no "magic 
number" of competitions that you need attend to maintain your status.


> Does a judge have to take future classes/exams to maintain his present rank?


No, but the better ones will try to maintain proficciency and 
increase their knowlege of individual styles.


> What type of power is invested into each judge at each given rank?


The only power is to be able to help brewers with their beers.  A 
higher level is really a thing for the judges themselves.  There are 
many good judges out there that aren't even members of the program.


> What can these judges do with their certificates?


Buy a beer at a local tavern for $2.50? :)     The certificate is really 
a donation to the brewers in his or her community.  The judge donates 
his time to competitions to better the craft.


> Can the obtained skills and knowledge of a judge be used to offer a service
> to breweries?


Yes and no.  The program is volunteer only but it is the only 
nationally recognized accreditation program in the US.  I suppose if 
you were to solicit your services then it would add some credibility 
to your efforts.


Hope that clears some things up for you.  I'm sure others will add 
their oopinions to mine and you will be painted a better picture of 
the program as a whole.

Hello all!


I've recently joined a local Brewing Club and the president is 
requesting help in writing the news letter.  I thought a short 
article on all of the great Internet resources for the homebrewer 
might make for an interesting article.  One problem, though, is that 
I'm new to this Internet stuff and I also (temporarily?) only have 
access to e-mail so all I get is this Digest.  So my request is 
this...  I would like my fellow homebrewers out there to send me info 
on any Brewing/Beer related internet mailing groups, Usegroups, WWW

of the site, what can be found there, and any relavent/specific 
instructions for accessing would be greatly appreciated.  I will also be 
glad to forward the compiled info to anyone who requests it.  TIA!!!

Ick!  I made a batch of all-grain honey ginger lager on Sunday, and while
most everything appeared to go quite well, My extraction rate...well...it
stunk!  I'll briefly summarize my procedures (so as to not create another 
100 line description of my brewday...)...


Grain Bill: 9 lbs. German 2-Row Pils, .5 lb. Dextrine, .5 Lb Wheat Malt
            .25 Lb Crystal Malt - 20L (Oh I wish they had the 10L :)


Mashed in grains with 11 qts. boiling H20 in coleman cooler.  Mash stablized
at about 155F...After 75 minutes, temp was down to 151F, so an additional 3 qts
boiling H2O was added to bring the temp to 159F...45 minutes and temp was
down to 156F.  Transferred mash to Phalse Bottom lauter-tun, and sparged with
4 gallons 170F H2O.  Boiled 60 minutes with hops, 4 oz. grated ginger root and
2 lbs. honey.  FDinish hopped, cooled, pitched, etc.  (I could tell you a REALLY
funny story about a 1/4 full carboy getting knocked onto it's side and
rolling down a flight of wooden steps into our front yard, without cracking
or losing a drop!  But I'll save that for an aeration antecdote).  Anyway,
when it was all said and done, I ended up with a OG of 1.047.  At LEAST
15points lower than I had wanted...I figure this is about a 47% yield?
What am I doing wrong?  What water chem,otry affects yield?  Oh collective

It's alive, it's alive.........


The 'cursed' SNPA starter has been raised from the dead.  After about 4 days
of looking at the dead starter, I had pretty much written it off (until I read
a post from someone who said that it took them a long time to culture the
yeast from a Chimay).  I have long sinced brewed, so I guess I will use this
one for my next batch (I plan on doing the same thing but experimenting with
mash schedule to see how it impacts extraction/clarity, etc.).   My question
is, how can I tell if the starter is any good?  It has led a troubled life and
I really do not trust it.  Is it as simple as smelling it, or should I take a
taste of the 'beer' and see if it is bad?

I've been trying to figure out ways to use the left-over wort.  Kraustening

more to thicken it, then froze it in the freezer.  Is there any reason why I

Subject: Garetz's Book


Thanks to David for pointing out my mistakes.  Indeed, I should not have
let my zeal interfere with the facts.  I should have brought in my copy of
his book to check the text before commenting.


However, regarding my referring to "Garetz's *Laws* of Hop Utilization,"
what I had feared *DID* in fact occur.   Many, many unsuspecting homebrewers
have bought the book and have brewed with the formulas that Garetz published
and they have brewed overhopped beer with them.  Even experts among us were
forced to dump batches as a result of these formulas.  How many copies of
beer calculation software have been distributed with these formulas?  See
what I mean?  All the disclaimers in the world did not protect these brewers
from the waste of ingredients and time.


No, David, I did not check my copy before engaging my keyboard, but the fact
remains that the formulas are so far off from reality, that even the
disclaimer, in my opinion, was not strong enough.  In my opinion, it should
have read like this:


"I've done a few isolated tests on a few beers, but most of these formulas are
guesses.  The beer brewed with these formulas could have as much as twice the
expected IBUs.  I'm sorry that I could not be more accurate and did not have
the time to test all the formulas, but I have been advertizing this book in
numerous magazines for over six months and this book is already late, so I
despite the fact that I'm presenting untested formulas, I'll just try my luck,
hope nobody sues me, and maybe get the formulas right in the second edition.
This way, you're sure the buy the second edition, right?"

Subject: Klages, water


     Just now catching up on about a week's worth of digests:
     
     Seems as if there is a difference of opinion on how best to mash 
     domestic 2-row.  I was always under the impression that domestic 2-row 
     did not need a protein rest. I have had chill haze problems with 
     single step mashes, but didn't make the link to less body and/or 
     mouthfeel.  Haze is not a priority with me, but body definitely is.  I 
     have always relied on the temperature ranges in TNCJOHB for the 
     different rests (protein, sacc., etc.).  The quotes attributed to Dr. 
     Lewis would seem to indicate these ranges to be different for Klages.  
     Is this correct?  Has he (or anyone else) ever quantified the benefits 
     of using various step programs for Klages?  After reading this post, I 
     dug out the Sept/Oct 1994 issue of Brewing Techniques in which Dave 
     Miller discusses the pros and cons of step vs. single infusion for 
     domestic 2-row malts.  The article left me with the impression that 
     either method would produce good beer.  I have used the 40-60-70 mash 
     described by George Fix, and liked the results, even though it extends 
     an already long brew day.  I have thought about trying Papazian's 
     schedule (something like 122F for 30 min, 146-152F for 60 min, 168F 
     for 10 min...).  Would this be better for domestic 2-row?
     
     We had a representative from the local water company at one of our 
     brew club meetings (Northern Maryland).  He said that our water supply 
     is very shallow and affected greatly by run-off, if I remember 
     correctly.  A water analysis done today would be completely different 
     from one done next week, and was therefore meaningless.  I used to 
     follow water treatment as written in recipes until I realized the end 
     result would of course be dependent on the water I started with.  I 
     see a lot of beginning brewers doing the same thing.  I wonder why 
     recipes often give amounts of gypsum, etc. to add without stating the 
     targeted concentrations.  The one area I know I could improve on is ph 
     monitoring.  Not having a ph meter, I have to rely on papers that 
     range all the way from a tan, semi-medium brown to a brownish 
     semi-medium-dark tan.  Needless to say, when checking mash runoff that 
     contains dark malts, I don't have a lot of faith in my numbers.

Subject: overpitching/poor body/pale ale


Hey HBDers,


Yesterday I brewed an all-grain Munich (OG 1.052) and poured the chilled wort 
directly onto the dregs of the primary from my last Munich.  This may have 
been a bit of a no-no given the amount of break material and hop residue on 
the yeast-cake.  Regardless, it's been done.  I aerated 30 minutes following 
"pitching" and noticed the airlock bubbling almost immediately after being 
placed on the carboy (6-gal).  I moved the beer to my lager fermentation room 
(50 F) and checked it 4 hours later just out of curiosity.  It had a huge head 
and the airlock was bubbling at about 60/min!  I was astounded.  This morning 
(15 hours after pitching) the airlock was bubbling so fast I could hardly count 
the bubbles coming out, but I estimate the rate to have been somewhere around 
120 bubbles/min.  And this is lager yeast!  I'm concerned that the large 
amount of yeast may have resulted in overpitching this batch, which can lead 
to oxygen depletion, autolysis, and sulfury odors in the beer (or so I've 
read).  I plan to rack to secondary as soon as the head starts to recede.  
Will this avoid the above-listed problems?  What other problems could result 
from this very rapid burst of activity?  Am I just worrying too much?
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
POOR BODY:
Many of my extract beers were lacking body and seemed a little watery despite 
using the appropriate volumes of water and no dilution.  This is one of the 
big reasons I switched to all-grain----I was hoping for better body and more 
maltiness.  Now, some of my all-grain batches are suffering the same 
problem.  I've stopped doing protein rests, tried adding cara-pils, and mash 
in the high-body end of the spectrum (158 F).  I'm at a loss and REALLY 
want to correct this situation.  I realize the above-info is sketchy, but can 
anyone suggest anything---I can give more details by private mail if necessary.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PALE ALE:
In hopes of correcting the above problem with poor body, I plan to do a 
series of pale ales to refine my mashing/sparging techniques.  Below is the 
basic recipe I plan to use:


        8.0 lbs briess 2-row pale malt
        1.0 lbs 20L crystal malt
        0.5 lbs cara-pils


        BC Kent Golding hops (24 IBU according to the LATEST v. of SUDSW)
           ---bittering, finishing, and dry-hopping


I thought that I might start with a standard single-infusion mash and 
experiment from there (working towards the 40/60/70 schedule).  
Any suggestions on mashing programs or recipe modifications would be 
appreciated.  


Thanks in advance for any help.

After you've been brewing for 3 years or so, those ads get very tiring.  How

I do the same thing, but I also appreciate the need for organized judgings
and such.  I also wonder how the AHA can make such rash decisions (like
withdrawing support of BJCP) without even a discussion from the hundreds
(thousands?) of members affected by these decisions.


I don't think the AHA supports experienced brewers like they do the
beginners.  One might argue that more experienced brewers don't need as much
help, which may be true, but we all pay the same fees, right?  Each year when
renewal comes around we have to decide for ourselves whether we are getting
our money's worth from the organization.

Regarding renewal, I'm not sure I will; I'm riding the fence.  The current
issue of Zymurgy is a quality issue, probably the best I've seen in over a
year.  This makes the $33 a little more bearable.

Bingo!  If you are buying your hops from a local homebrew store, I'd ask a
LOT of questions:  Who do you buy your hops from?  Do you separate them
yourselves into 1 oz. packages?  How is this done?  Do you use O2 barrier
packaging?  Does your supplier?  How are they stored?  etc. etc. etc.


If you buy hops from The Hop Source (now owned by Just Hops) or HopUnion, or
HopTech, then I think the alpha acid is probably pretty accurate.  Once I
discussed with Glenn Tinseth the issue of rechecking alpha acid late in the
hop season (many months after harvest).  He indicated that if the hops are
stored properly (barrier packaging, purged, low temp) then the %AA will not
have changed much from the original value, and can be used as is.  The good
hop outlets will store properly, but I've seen very few retail stores who do
it right.


One other issue that comes to mind is weighing the hops.  I've seen a dozen
different scales used to weigh hops (mostly small food scales), and most of
them won't give you a guaranteed accuracy.  They are probably all "pretty
close" but you don't really know how much error you are adding at this simple
step.  Using a laboratory-grade scale is a different story, but many of us
haven't invested in one.  I for now, have taken the tack of aiming for
precision, rather than accuracy.  If I have as a foundation the ability to
duplicate a certain bitterness within acceptable limits, I can take it one

basically the same argument as Rich Webb's.  Another thing to think about.

(I still think having Fort Collins, or Seattle, or San Francisco in your
 .signature constitutes "rubbing it in", but I can live with that!!!)
