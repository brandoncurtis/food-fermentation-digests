     In a year of reading the digest I have not seen a discussion of the 
proper/best way to store hops.  I have taken to using brown jars (ovaltine 
works nicely), purging w/co2 and freezing.  Seemed to be a reasonable 
alternative to the cost of buying a heat sealer, o2 impermeable bags and some 
nitrogen.  I do know that the last hops I bought were scooped out of a regular 
plastic bag that was retrieved from the refrigerator and closed with a
twist-tie.  The store owner told that he had just gotten his hops a few days
ago and so I figger'd that there couldn't have been too much decrement yet.  
Anyway it would be nice to see/hear how other keep their hops.

Dear HBDers:


        A friend of mine, without HBD access, recently brewed and kegged a batch
of ale using his left-over hops.  Apparently, the hops were no good, as the
resultant beer has neither hop aroma nor bitterness.  Is there any way to hop
finished beer and save this batch?  Private e-mail is o.k.

Not quite. I believe B-Brite is mostly sodium percarbonate, which releases 
oxygen when dissolved in water. So it sanitizes, as well as cleans. Sodium 
Carbonate (Washing Soda) is a good cleaner, but not a sanitizer.

 Papazian <and I don't quote> tells about yeast serviving temperature changes 
ok but not pressure or loss of very well. I am wondering about the Wyeast
as it has much pressure inside the package at the time it is ready to use.
Could their be any ill effect on the the yeast from this? I am also 
wondering if K. Flemings yeasties exploded due to the change in pressure.
I just pitched some Wyeast Sunday that did not go full term in the package
and it seemed to perform better than other times when the package was
buldging.


PS. The yeast went in my Amber ale, thanks for everyones input on Amber.

Subject: moosebrew and IBU




       Les Wood asks for info on Moosehead beer. I am going to assume you 
     are asking about their lager since they don't export Ale (IMHO their 
     best product). I would recommend a mash using Harrington( 2-Row) from 
     Canadian Malting(try 70-75%) and the remaining 25-30% Corn(flaked 
     maize). Use German Hops(Low Alpha,noble)for bittering (try for 13-15 
     IBU) and same for aroma/flavour. For yeast that is a different story, 
     I have used the above with Yeast Lab's Canadian Ale (Labbatt's ?) with 
     excellent results.
     
        I would like to comment on hop utilization, I have analyzed approx. 
     one dozen beer for BU's(done by a brewery) and they are quite varied 
     from the expected formula. I believe that it is not possible to have a 
     formula that will work for everyone in all cases. An example if one 
     looks at the second edition of Malting and Brewing Science, Table 9.10 
     (p288)shows the "effects of "standing" infusion mash...and derived 
     beers". This table shows that the bitterness can vary from 30 to 
     22(mg/l). The temperatures varied from 57 to 65.5 C. The explanation 
     was "At lower temperatures the alteration in the Lundin fraction 
     showed that proteolysis was more complete. This was also reflected by 
     a higher hop utilization, probably due to the reduced break caused by 
     the presence of lesser quantities of complex nitrogenous substances to 
     bring down the bittering substances".
        This type of trend is also shown in Table 9.14(p298). The 
     bitterness of the beer varied from 23-24(mg/l for 100% Malt) to 28-30 
     (mg/l for 50% Malt, 50% adjuncts(Wheat flour, Maize, Rice flakes).

Subject: Counter flow chiller question




  I see a general agreement in the Digest that chiller tubing (copper) should 
  be 3/8".  My question is, 3/8" i.d. or o.d.?  I'm specifically interested 
  in which one is needed for the Phillchill Phittings as I ordered a set of 
  these last week.  It says that 25' of 3/8" copper tubing is needed but, 
  again, doesn't specify inner or outer diameter.  I was in Home Depot over 
  the weekend with the intention of buying the tubing but they carried both 
  and I passed.  My gut tells me I need 3/8" o.d. but I wasn't sure enough to 
  make the purchase.
  
  Also, I have a half-barrel converted keg brew kettle I bought from BCI that 
  I would like to put a spigot of some sort on like the Sabco kettle.  I know 
  that theirs has a welded nipple but I wondered if one couldn't attach a 
  1/2" brass ball valve simply using a fiber washer (or no washer) like on 
  the Easymasher.  Perhaps the stainless steel is too rigid to allow for a 
  good seal in this fashion?  Any input would be appreciated - email is fine.

Subject: Beer quality - homebrew vs. commercial


Several questions for those of you out there with much more homebrewing
experience than I.


1) How does the "best" homebrew compare with the the "best" commercial beer?
"Best" is difficult to determine, but can any generalizations be made with
respect to the beer produced by homebrewers versus commercial brewers, once
a reasonably high level of competence is attained?


2) How do the raw materials used by commercial brewers differ from those
used by commercial (micro) brewers? I would imagine that the malt is quite
similar, the yeast more varied, and have no idea about the hops.


3) Finally, how much of largescale brewing is art vs. engineering, or asked 
another way, could many other micro breweries produce a copy of, say an 
Anchor Liberty Ale or a SN Celebration Ale, if it were in their business 
model to produce such a product? If money was no object, and a brewery wanted 
to produce a five star beer, using the best ingredients and state of the art 
equipment, could most brewers pull it off or are there still lots of 
intangibles left which translate into a disparity of results.


Thanks for any insights into these questions.

>I ended up with an OG of 1.047...at LEAST 15 pts lower than I wanted


You didn't say how much wort you produced, but from your msg I figured
you used a total of about 7.5 gal then boiled for an hour.  So, just to
get an idea of how 'bad' you did, I used 6 gal as your final yield.  That
figure, along with a back of the envelope yield rate of 30 pts*gal/lb
gave me:


   (30 pts*gal/lb)*(9 lb/6 gal) = 45 pts


If you reduced to 5 gal then computed yield would be 54.  In all it
looks pretty predictable to me.  The figure of 30 pts*gal/lb is just a
number I find to be what folks actually GET when they brew this way,
and it often provides a good estimate.


My point here is: *take good notes*.  It just doesn't matter what anyone
else gets with their brewing, except as a goal to shoot for.  What I
*think* you care about is knowing ahead of time what to expect--you can
only do that with careful notetaking.


There are other factors here as well (many), one of which is your
thermometer--for example, we have a digital handheld unit that MAY be
off by as much as 4F too high--don't know yet.  If you are using one
that's off by that much, percent of fermentables in the final product
may be a big surprise (in either direction, depending on the thermometer
error).  Again, it's not yield per se, but repeatability that I think
you're after.


Wow--I guest that was about $.08 worth.

Dear HBDers,
    This is my first time using the HBD, and I must give kudos to
everyone.  This is indeed one of the most helpful resources for
homebrewers, especially novices such as myself.
    Anyway, I'm interested in brewing an extract beer along the lines
of Celis White in the near future.  I know I could never achieve a beer
that complex or good using extracts, but I'd like to give it a try.
I have obtained a couple of "Celis-alike" recipes from friends, but I
thought I would ask for any suggestions from you veterans out there.
There is a Belgian White recipe in the latest issue of ZYMURGY, but
it is a mash or partial mash recipe.  If anyone has any suggestions
about possible extract substitutions in that recipe, I would also be
interested.  Please e-mail me.  Anything helps!  Thanks in advance to
everybody and keep up the good conversation.

PHIL'S PHILLER
I just used my new Phil's Philler for the phirst (sorry, I had
to do that once) time, and I think it's great.  It's made of
brass, and fills bottles faster than my plastic filler.  I
didn't bother with a time trial, but I know it's faster.  It's
also easy to set the level in the bottle without spilling as
much as before.  They cost about $14 (won't make the Frugal
Brewer FAQ), and are in many homebrew catalogs.


SIPHONING
There's been a lot of talk lately, here and especially on RCB,
about siphoning.  There're various methods for filling tubes,
and for blowing and sucking.  One thing I've thought of, but
haven't seen, is flexible bulb that would be somewhere in the
tube between the carboy and the bottling bucket, much like the
siphoning tubes available at automotive stores.  I hesitate to
use an item designed for gas on my beer, but I haven't seen one
any where else.  Has anyone seen such a beast, suitable for
transferring beer?  If so, where?


YEAST NUTRIENT
I recently saw an add for yeast nutrient for use in making
beer.  (I am aware that its use in making mead is standard,
although I have not yet made mead.)  The add pointed out the
positive results of using nutrient, and the quick and healthy
ferments one could expect.  So far, my ferments have seemed
fine, but I guess they could always be better.  Anyway, has
anyone used yeast nutirent in making beer?  


As always, TIA for any advice.

Subject: Playing with Grolsch bottles


I bottled a stout a week ago, and used 2 party pigs, and 2 grolsch bottles.


Now the question:  Can I open the grolsch bottles, pour some off to taste, 
and then re-cap them?  Logically (in my mind), it would work, but be a 
little flat.  Opinions?


Why?  The stout is going to take longer than my regular ales, but I'm 
impatient, and have never tried this (the re-capping thing).  Usually, my 
beer goes all at once, and the bottles are drained before I can even try 
this method.  But not many of my friends like stouts ('I can't SEE 
through it!' whining abound), so I want to start drinking as soon as 
possible.  I figured I can use the bottles as 'testers.'

I think you've got something there, Norm. Rather than deal with the student

consistent with their autocratic method of management (benevolent

I wouldn't use these right out of the freezer. I'd boil them to both reduce

In a previous quest to do as you are doing, I was told that the texturing of
the rollers helps to graw the grain in between. Cross-hatch patterns were

I have a few questions I would like to direct to the collective. 
(I feel like Loqutious of the Borg when I say that ;-) )


1)  I have the opportunity of getting a soda fountain despensor for 
fairly cheap.  I have never seen the inner workings of one of these 
things, so I don't know exactly how they work and what equipment is 
included.  My question is, is there any body out there that knows if 
one of these things would be compatible with a cornelius kegging 
system (or other type of kegging system) and what other equipment 
would I need to complete the setup?  Also, do you forsee any 
potential problems.  Finally, this is at an auction and I have no 
idea what the item might be worth new so as to estimate what to 
offer.  I was thinking maybe $50 - $100.


2) I'm toying with the idea of going full-grain (actually, I know I 
want to, it's just a matter of money).  I saw a Gott 5gallon cooler 
for about $25 yesterday.  Right now I'm only doing 5gal batches, but 
might go to 10gal when I go all-grain.  Is a 5gal Gott big enough for 
mashing/lautering or should I go bigger?


3) On the subject of going all-grain, my local brew supply store has 
a gas cooker rated at 200,000Btu for $45.  This sounds like a fair 
price, but I haven't shopped around much.  Does anyone know of a 
better deal?


Unless you feel it to be of general interest, private e-mail is fine.

Subject:       cheap counter-flow chiller


Maybe someone has already figured this out, but I haven't seen a post 
on it lately.  I think I have built possibly the cheapest counter 
flow chiller yet (sounds like a challenge to me ;-| ).


Ingredients                         Quantity            Cost each
garden hose (25' x 1/2")              2                  $3.47
Y-garden hose adapter-plastic      2                  $0.97
plastic hose coupling (male)        1                  $1.17      
plastic hose coupling (female)     1                  $1.17  
copper tubing (20' x 1/4")           1                  $7.20
                                          TOTAL              $18.42


First insert the 20' of copper tubing in the 25' garden hose (I used 
mineral oil as a lubricant) through the male end of the hose, leaving 
about 6" to 8" sticking out.  Feel the hose to find the other end of 
the copper tubing and cut it, again leaving about 6" to 8" of Cu tube 
sticking out.  Now put the male coupling on this end of the hose 
(hose should now be male on both ends).  Attach the Y-hose 
adapters to each end, carefully threading the copper tubing out one 
side of the Y-adapter so as not to crimp the tubing.  Seal the gap 
between the Cu tubing and the adapter with Silicon glue.  Coil the 
whole thing up to your liking, careful not to crimp the tubing 
inside.  Now cut the male end of the _other_ hose off and replace it 
with the female coupling, making it all female.  This hose is the 
"water in" connector to your chiller.  Use the scrap of hose left 
over from the first hose as the "water out" draining hose.  That's all 
there is to it.  You will probably need some other adapters, such as 
some inexpensive compression fittings, for the ends of the copper 
tubing, but that might me specific to your setup, so I'll leave the 
rest to you.


Happy Brewing

From: Mark Ohlstrom <mohlstr`at`CATI.CSUFresno.EDU>
Subject: IBU's/Gott/Judging $.02


As a new subscriber to the HBD, I have read with interest (and 
occasional amusement) the topics available to we, the homebrewers.


I must enter the fray of IBU discussion with my observations, and more 
particularly, questions about the process.


Currently, I am an all-grain brewer that mashes in a 5 gallon Gott 
cooler, and I boil in a converted straight-sided keg. I practice infusion, 
have found a practical grain limit of 13-14 lbs in the tun, and mash-out 
to an initial volume of 7-8 gallons. Once in the pot, I boil down to 6-7 
gallons, and yield 4.5-6 gallons to the fermenter, depending on the 
amount of trub/hot break. My gravities range from 1.040 to 1.060; I 
attribute that in part to the sparge volumes and the boil times.


None of the texts I've read on calculating IBU's make a point of 
discussing *initial* boil volumes and how/if this should play into the 
calculations. Is there any significance to the initial volume?


Using some hypotheticals (and please bear with my Excel calcs), if I 
use the *kettle* volume (6.5) in the Rager formula, 1 oz of 10 % AU, a 
60 minute boil with 30% utilization, an O.G. of 1.050, I come up with 
34.44 IBU's. If I use my final fermenter volume (5.5), then I get 40.71.


Perhaps it is common sense, but none of the texts I have read has 
made a distinction about the *proper* volume to use. Most of us would 
be inclined to say *fermenter*, correct? I would argue that the final 
kettle volume is the right one, since a gallon of unusable wort is still 
one gallon of wort. Some brewers may not lose a gallon in the 
process, as I do, but accurate calculations must have accurate 
measurements.


Since I am a late comer to the IBU debate, I presume that the 
disparaging of Garetz's approach to IBU calculation is with utilization 
rates, not the formula itself. I say this because the formula in 
Papazian's book works out pretty darn close to Garetz's if you use the 
same utilization rates. I would concur that the Garetz 
formula/utilization understates the IBU's: some of my own brews hit the 
perceived high-end of the style, supported by the Rager %, yet fall in 
the midpoint under the Garetz. Naturally then, the high end of the 
Garetz calculation will make your brew out of style. That said, I recall 
one writer in the HBD recently to say 20% is tops.


Practically speaking, I have determined (for now) to take the average 
of the two to be consistent.


I've not yet explored other IBU formulas/theories, and would 
appreciate further insight. If anyone would care to send me the text of 
an alternate formula/utilization schedule, please do so!


On efficiency and the Gott cooler: as I stated, my *best* all-grain 
gravity has been a 1.060 with infusion. Due to my setup, I have 
resigned to sparge out to as much as 8 gallons to hit the 5-5.5 gallon 
target. Perhaps the 1.060-ish gravity is all that can be Gott.


Lastly, on judging: it is a necessary evil. How can one explain the 
variations, except for subjectivity? I saw not one but *two* 50's 
awarded in the Pale Ale category during the AHA regional last year! 
More than anything, a judges personal preferences play into a score. 
Can you really expect a judge who doesn't like Pale Ale to be 
unbiased? How many good brews have fallen due to a certain panel's 
composition?


Now that my opinions are exposed and fair game to all, I trust you will 
be kind (?) if not persuaded! 


I brew when you yeast expect it.

In short, I'm looking for a good scale to weigh leaf hops, preferably
for under $40.


I've started buying hops in bulk from Just Hops (no affiliation, just
a delighted customer), and I'm finding it hard to gauge how much of
a 1 lb bag to use.


Most of the "diet" scales I've seen have granularity of an ounce
or less, and their accuracy is questionable.  On the other hand, I'm
not ready to jump to a triple-beam.  Anyone know of a simple balance,
good electronic scale, anything in between?  TIA

About a year ago I got a VIP tour of the Anheusier-Busch (sp?) plant as
part of the quarterly MBAA (Master Brewers Assoc of America) meeting.


They have developed equipment to mix hot air with the hot wort as soon
as it leaves the kettle.  This is done in an ~3 story tall tower maybe 15' in
diameter.  In this tank the uncooled wort is dropped from the top
(I imagine some kind of large assembly for distributing it evenly over the
 diameter of the tank) against an upward air flow of something in excess of
at least 100F, I believe 160F was the number buut this was a while ago.
The bottom of this tower collects the hot wort and channels it to the
necessary chilling equipment.


This step caught me by supprise so I asked specific questions to make sure
I didn't misunderstand.  The person answering was a very knowledgable plant
foreman with something between 15 and 20 years of experience so this was
not the case of a confused tour guide.


In the past HSA has been described to me as a bit of a religious issue.
There are two obvious sides and you're in one camp or the other.  All the
data produced by one camp will never convince the other and vice versa.


I realize this doesn't really explain to you why anyone would do one thing
over another.  I'm really not interested in starting a relgious war so I'm
going to avoid that all together.  However, I think that it is important 
to point out that there are two equally valid sides to this issue.


(aside: you should have seen the look on the foreman's face when he witnessed my
 giving two tubes of brewery contaminants to someone I was meeting there
 _after_ we had toured every nook and cranny of the brewery.  Well, I reassured
 him that they where only hop tollerant strains of Pediococcus and
 Brettanomyces  8-)   I was a good meeting. )

Subject: testing a yeast starter


Keith Royster cited advice from his local supply store regarding how to
tell if a yeast starter is active:


"They instructed me to take a pinch of sugar (table sugar is fine) and drop
it into the starter bottle.  If the yeast are active in sufficient
quantities, they will attack the sugar agressively, almost consuming it all
before it hits the bottom of the bottle.  The result will be a column of
CO2 bubbles rising quickly to the surface of the wort.  It is actually
quite amazing to watch!"


That sounds like too rapid a response to be attributable to the yeast, and
there is an alternative explanation.  If the solution is supersaturated in
CO2 (as a yeast starter is likely to be after the yeast have digested the
available sugars), then adding sugar or any other finely divided solid
causes CO2 to bubble out of solution.  The solid provides  "condensation
nuclei", around which the gas bubbles form.  Try adding a pinch of sugar or
salt or sand to nearly-flat soda or pasteurized commercial beer.  You
should see a column of CO2 bubbles rising quickly to the surface, even
though no yeast are present.


The test itself may still be useful, but I think it is telling you that
yeast were previously active in the starter.  This is a good sign, but it
is not quite a guarantee that the yeast are still healthy.

Subject: Re: Beer line pressure drop


Pressure drop per foot of hose is not simply a number that you 
cann assign to a type of hose. Pressure drop per foot depends 
strongly upon the flow rate through the hose. At zero flow, there
is no pressure drop, and the pressure drop per foot increses as 
flow rate increases. The type of flow also makes a big diference.
In laminar flow, the roughness of the hose is not nearly as 
important as it is in turbulent flow. See any basic text on 
fluid dynamics.

Subject: skimming & dropping




I've enjoyed the recent thread on "dropping," especially various
postings by Brian Gowland, Jim Busch, and Jim Cave (Hi, all!).  I
recommend Graham Wheeler's "CAMRA Homebrewing Guide"
and Wheeler and Protz's "Brew Your Own Real Ale at Home" for
their insights into the British brewing practice, which is
somewhat different than the US one.  I'd like to try to put the
discussion of dropping into some context.  My understanding of
this is based on reading the above plus touring a couple British
breweries.


Brewers in Britain use ale yeasts, some of which are strong top
croppers.  The process of "skimming" consists of the following:
As fermentation takes off, the yeast develop a head, or berm.  At
ale fermentation temperatures, fermentation can be quite vigorous
and the head quite pronounced.  A couple days in to the ferment,
the head discolors with some brown material. This brown material
is, variously, cold and hot break, hop by-products, spent yeast,
trub.  There are purported deleterious flavors from this material,
and purported flavor benefits in the finished beer from removing
this material.  The brewer would use a spoon to skim the head and
remove some of the trub and yeast.  The beer nonetheless retains a
strong top crop of yeast.  The problem with skimming is that one
has to intermittently skim the yeast and trub from the beer.  To the
extent one doesn't, then as fermentation winds down, the head
and yeast fall through the beer, mixing all the originally lifted
material that hasn't been removed back into the beer.  A
homebrewer can easily put skimming into practice by conducting
open fermentation, as has been well described by Jim Busch.  The
blowoff method can also be seen as a variant of this method.
Rather than skimming, the brewer relies on an active fermentation
plus some hosing to blow the trub off of the beer.  One other
point:  The Burton Union system employed for so long by Bass
and still to this day by Marston can be seen as a variant of this
method.


Given the problem with removing yeast and trub from beer,
someone had the bright idea to instead remove the beer from the
yeast and trub.  This is the "dropping" method.  Dropping refers
to dropping the beer out of a vessel into a vessel below (a vertical
arrangement naturally suggests itself).  Pre- and post- dropping,
the beer is still in primary fermentation.  The trub is left behind,
while active yeast are carried along with the dropped beer.  This
evidently is common practice in commercial British brewing.
Brian Gowland suggests an ersatz dropping method consisting of
racking the beer a couple days into primary fermentation, leaving
the stuff on top in the first vessel.


I don't know whether deliberate aeration at this point is necessary
or desirable.  There are so-called "Northern yeasts" that seemingly
require splashing and aeration in order to do the job.  The
sustained mouthfeel and smooth buttery flavor of Samuel Smith's
is the result.  The Yorkshire Stone square system is the
fermentation system used for this type of yeast.


I suggest that on the homebrew level we can do a lot of
experimentation.  Relatively recently, there has been a virtual
explosion in the availability of true British yeast.  Contact Dan
McConnell at Yeast Culture Kit Company and ask him what he
has available "behind the scenes."  Or, take a look at the Brewers
Resource catalog for a half-dozen or so interesting British yeast.

Clear the decks and empty your carboys, there's plans abrewin!
My first homebrew club, The Impaling Alers of Kent, WA, has got something
special planned for National Homebrewing day the first Saturday in May.
I'd heard about the Great Northern Brewer's Homebrewing Club in Alaska
and their setting the homebrewing record of 450 gallons made in a single day. 
I thought that we could give it a try, or at least die in the attempt!
At the very least, and if you can, plan on coming to Larry's Brewing supply 
on May 6 and watching us make batch after batch of homebrew. We'll be doing all
grain, all extract, combinations, maybe even a mead or two! What we need is
quantity for the record, but quality will be nice too! We've got the 50 gallon
pilot brewery that can go a long ways towards filling a lot of carboys. We also
need you to bring your empty carboys and fermentation buckets down that day to
collect X gallons of chilled wort, suitable for yeast pitching. So here's the
deal. You can make your own brew if you're in the club, or buy some of the club
wort, or both! This is gonna be great!


I can brew twice that day in my own system, and fill up maybe 4 or 5 carboys 
with those two different batches, and I can help brew in the 50 gallon tank, 
and claim two or more carboys of wort from that batch. I can fill every
fermentation container I have, plus more, if only they are ready (empty) on May
6. Friday night I can have no brew going, and Sunday morning comes, I won't be
able to sleep for all of the carboy bubbling going on! Start planning for this
now. Plan on having all of your available fermentation containers empty come
May. And plan on setting up a lot of yeast starters suitable for pitching on
May 6. And bring plenty of coffee, 'cause it's going to be a long day!

Subject: Modified Malt and Balling


Over the weekend I brewed with D-C Pils malt for the first 
time in over a year, having been using MF Pale Ale most 
recently.  The interesting thing I noticed was that when 
using the modified Pils I had no problem with balling 
during the mash-in, but when I switched to the highly 
modified Pale Ale malt, balling became a serious problem.  
At the time I thought it was due to the level of modification, 
but it occured to me this weekend that with the Pale Ale 
my strike temp was generally about 158 F, but would be 
in the range of 128 F with the Pils.


So, which is it, temp, modification, or both?  I imagine 
someone who uses a single step mash with Pils malt 
has the answer for me.  Would this balling test be a good
 test for when you buy the occassional generic bag of "malt"?




Norm Pyle's response to Jeff Hewit brought up a subject 
near and dear to all of our hearts:


<After you've been brewing for 3 years or so, those ads 
<get very tiring.   How many times do I need to sift 
<through the same ads for Charlie  P slogans and 
<sayings?  After you've seen them 10 or 20 times you 
<start  to wonder if the magazine couldn't fill that 
<space with something a little more useful.




Not that I disagree with you, Norm, but how 
could we support the globe-trotting staff without 
all the advertising revenue (Note: no emoticon here)?  
Which probably gets to the heart of my concerns over 
the AHA; absolutely no accountability over the funds 
collected from the "members" of the non-profit org.  




Not that I plan on entering the great IBU math debate, but
 Al K. is such a great straight man that I couldn't resist.


Many, many unsuspecting homebrewers have bought 
the book and have brewed with the formulas that 
Garetz published and they have brewed overhopped 
beer with them.




Overhopped beer?  You must be kidding, never had one!    :-)




Almost forgot... 
Bruce DeBolt was asking about substituting 1 lb. of 
Aromatic for an equal quantity of Munich,  My 
experience with both D-C malts is that the Aromatic 
adds an incredible malty aroma and a strong malt 
character.  I would guess that 1 lb. would probably 
be too intense, though I once put a pound and a half 
in an Octoberfest and the judges comments were 
WOW, w.r.t. the malt character.  Since that time I've 
never used more than 8 ounces (in 5 gal.) and get 
very strong malt character from that.  All I can say 
is to experiment, but be prepared for an intense 
malt character.

They are meant to represent the IBU ranges typically found in commercial
beers.  Some of them are way off, but they have been getting closer and
closer each year.  Actually, I'm pretty happy with the 1995 guidelines
compared with those terrible 1994 guidelines (check out the "sweet maltiness"
in the Dry Stout subcategory).  Alts are finally beginning to get into
the proper range to represent the *Dusseldorf* Alt they have been pretending
to be!  There is still much work to be done, but I think that if you
compare the 1995 guidelines with, say, the 1990 ones, you would notice
BIG differences.


So, in fact, getting an accuate formula that estimates the IBUs you get
from your system is rather important.

There were two posts yesterday that said that B-Brite is Sodium Carbonate.
I assure you that there's more oxygen there than you think.  No, it's
Sodium PERcarbonate, which, when added to water, basically makes something
similar to Sodium Carbonate in Hydrogen Peroxide.  That's why it sanitizes.
Sodium Carbonate does not sanitize.

Great Western may be like Schreier, i.e. they just make one and deliver that
when you request either lager or pale ale malt.  Schreier calls theirs
2-row Brewer's Malt.

Sorry, I just deleted the question about whether dropping is the same
as racking, so I don't have the posters name.  Actually, if you look again
at the timing of the transfer, dropping is quite specific.  You'll note
that, when you make a beer, about a day or two into the fermenation, there
is a dirty head that rides up on top of a white foam.  The concept of dropping
(which, incidentally could be done via racking, it doesn't requite a spigot)
is based upon the idea that you remove the beer before this dirty head has
a chance to fall back into the beer, so you leave it in the primary.
