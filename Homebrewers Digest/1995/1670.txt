Subject: Ultimate Fermenters/Cold Break/$1 CP Bottle Fillers


Will Self raises some interesting ideas about fermenters. My original idea 
for a "bottomless" fermenter in the early 80's had many of the features 
Will describes.  Plain old economics reared its ugly head when I took my 
original design to a plastics manufacturer.  So back to the drawing board 
where the next go 'round in the prototype "lab" resulted in the BrewCap.  
As I explained to Will offline, the BrewCap isn't the perfect solution.  
But it *is* a $13.95 solution!!  And with a little attention to detail, 
satisfies the essential requirements of harvesting yeast and eliminating 
racking from the fermentation process. 


>I have tried the inverted carboy method using the brewcap, and the fatal

>the brewcap system is a lot of danged trouble.


As much as I'd rather let this comment pass, I just can't let people think 
the BrewCap is fatally flawed because of Will's experience.  I agree that 
the carboy shape is not ideal when it comes to the settling of the yeast.  
If I had any influence over the Mexican carboy manufacturers, I'd have had 
them remold their product years ago!!  But the BrewCap works in spite of it 
still.  The key is to twist the carboy back and forth *every* day.  (The 
instructions emphasize this, BTW.)  You can't wait until the yeast drops 
out of solution at the secondary stage.  If you do, stuff collects on the 
carboy shoulders, sticks, and interferes (though hardly obstructs) the 
desired settling of the yeast.  By following this technique, the yeast 
falls quite easily into the carboy neck where it falls into the yeast 
collection hose and is easily removed. 


I guess you can say the BrewCap is "a lot of danged trouble".  But, to me, 
the convenience of harvesting yeast directly from the fermenter, the 
elimination of racking to secondaries and priming tanks and the resultant 
cleaning of those vessels makes it worth it turning upside down once or 
twice (depending on whether you bottle or keg). 


>I would like to have a valve at the bottom of the fermenter and attach

>the valve open at pitching time and that any trub that I have got into
>my fermenter would settle into the collecting jar during the lag phase
>and could be removed.  


I'll get on my soapbox on this one so please forgive me.  (And this has 
nothing to do with the BrewCap).  Of all the things to worry about in the 
making of beer, I don't understand why some brewers get so bent out of 
shape over their beer resting on a little cold break in the fermenter?  
I'm the first to admit one shouldn't take hot break over into the 
fermenter.  (See my Zymurgy article of a couple of years ago for all the 
gory details.)  But the jury is out as to whether cold break has any 
deleterious effect on the flavor of beer.  My reading of the literature 
indicates it has no effect whatsoever on the more robust flavored beers.  
Period.  As for more delicate beers,  there "seems to be more possibility 
of having unacceptable sulphury aroma and taste" in beers where cold trub 
had not been removed "during the course of successive fermentations".  
(_Malting and Brewing Science, pp. 523-524).  


OK.  I admit the phrase "during the course of successive fermentations" is 
vague.  But I've always presumed they were referring to breweries where 
beers are being repitched successively.  If so, for those of us who tend to 
use fresh cultures each time, then the effects of cold trub on the flavor 
of beer is insignificant. 


In the same paragraph the authors state:  "The overall impression from 
other studies is that the presence of cold trub may stimulate the rate of 
fermentation, possibly by providing nuclei for carbon dioxide release..."
This is good.  This is not something to avoid.


As the years have gone by, I've tried to eliminate unnecessary steps from 
my brewing process.  Though I may be wrong and surely welcome debate to the 
contrary, I fall down on the side of the fence that says letting cold break 
settle and racking to the "real" fermenter 12 or so hours later is a waste 
of time.  In fact, it's asking for trouble.


Guess that ought to get a rise out of a few people!  :-)


Getting back to the matter at hand...


>You can see that one of my big aims is to totally eliminate racking.  I
>would want to send the beer straight from the fermenter into soda kegs.


I've been doing that for 11 years, Will!   :-)


On a less proprietary note:


Roger reposted Darren's $1 counter pressure filler idea.  A great gadget.  
We've used it at Tumbleweed for over a year now.  Just one *very* important 
point that wasn't mentioned in the original post.  It's imperative you 
prefill the bottles with CO2 before filling them with beer else you'll have 
oxidized beer in a month or so.  Even still, I wouldn't want them to sit 
around for several months if they've been bottled using this device.  I 
think it's better to go the bottle conditioning route if you plan on 
"laying a bottle down" for a while.

        Fellow Brewers,


        I have just started an Oktoberfest using Wyeast #1007 (German ale 
yeast). I have never used this yeast before and have a few questions. I 
have noticed a slight sulphery odor in the fermenting blowoff. I have 
heard this is common with some lager yeasts but I have never heard of it 
in an ale yeast. Also, there seems to be high flocculation in the 
primary. I am interested to know if these are the normal characteristics 
of Wyeast 1007 and what the final characteristics will be in the brew 
(due to the yeast only). 
*****************************
        I have another product related question. In the process of 
gathering ingredients for this recipe I came across a new product (at 
least at the supply shop I frequent). It's called "Morgan's Blend Malt 
Extract" it is a pre blended extract of specialty grains. It comes in a 
2.2# can. Has anyone had any experience using this.
        TIA

Subject: Boiling clorox


Pier Dutcher mentioned boiling clorox in his post about "cheep pumps".


This reminds me of a question I've been wanting to ask.  I'm almost 
positive that boiling clorox ruins its sterilization properties.  I've 
heard that this causes it to degenerate into some kind of harmless salt.


I'm no chemist so my question goes out to those who are.  I mentioned this 
to a friend in the past and he asked why, then, do people use clorox in hot 
water in their washing machines?


Second.  Assuming hot water does destroy clorox, how much contact time does 
the trick?  I ask this because a couple of times I've had problems with 
clorophenols at the Tumbleweed brewery.  I've eliminated it by doing 30 
minute to 1 hour boiling water soaks in our fermenters.  (We use HD 
polyethelene drums.  Why?  Economics.)  


Bringing 4 bbls. of water to a boil on brew day in the brewing kettle is 
a big pain so we are in the process of changing our sterilization program. 
I intend on using perasetic acid once a month to ensure absolute
sterilization of our barrels.  Then I plan on following that with a routine
iodophor soak the rest of the month to maintain sterility.  Both of these
solutions rinse well with smaller amounts of boiling water. 


But I still wonder whether how much into the overkill zone I've been with 
the 30 minute boiling water soaks on the old plan.


Wow!  Two posts in two days.  Just like the old days!!


Cheers!

You can use 6 row lager malt, but US 2 row works too.  I prefer to 
use continental Pils malt, though.


<I was planning on a 60-90 minute 125F protein rest
<a 60 minute rest at 152F
<a 30 minute rest at 158F
<a 170F mash-out


You might want to read Warners Wheat book, available from the AoB.
When using this much wheat, a decoction is pretty much mandatory.  Even
when using a 50/50% mix, this is one of the few styles that really
benefits from a dough in around 105-110F.  This temp will help adjust
the pH, reduce gums and beta glucans through the action of beta glucanase
and also liberate ferrulic acid bound to pentosans.  Warner lists the
optimum for this is 111F and 5.7 pH (pg 72, German Wheat Beer).  The
importance of liberating ferrulic acid is that this has been shown to
be a key precursor to the 4-vinyl guaiacol, which is responsible for
the characteristic phenols in weizens. 


60-90 minutes at protein temp is kinda overkill.  Id suggest a dough
in at 105F, rest for 10-15 minutes, then add heat to pass through to
122F. Hold there for 30 min, then raise to 152F for 60 min, then 
170 to mash off.  This would be an example of the upward step mash. If
you want to do a low temp and high temp rest, Id say rest 15 mins at
145 to maximize beta amylase activity, then push it to 158F to maximize
alpha amylase activity.  


For a decoction:  Id suggest a dough in at 105F, rest for 10-15 minutes, 
then add heat to pass through to 122F. Hold there for 20 min, pull 1/3rd
thick decoction.  Raise this to saacharification, hold 15-30 mins, then
boil it for 20 mins.  Combine the two mashes and hold at saacharification
until conversion is complete.  Then mash off.


A beta glucan rest (and decoction mashing) will make lautering weizens 
easier.


<For hops, I was planning a 60 minute boil with Tettnang, and using some
<Saaz at the end for nose.


Traditional weizens have no finish hops, nothing less than 20 minutes
to the end of the boil.


< For fermentation, I was planning on 14 days at 45F in primary,


You better do this at 60F or higher, or risk sluggish ferment and/or 
low ester and phenol production.

     Eamonn make a remark about the brown scum on the wall. Well I hate to 
     admit it but my wife is right, it is from the beer. Now I don't know 
     what it is! I don't think it is sugar, a rule of thumb for steam 
     distillation is greater than 1mm vapour pressure at 100C. I could not 
     find the vapour pressure for glucose(C6H12O6) but glycerol(C3H8O3) is 
     1mm at 125C and the relationship is nonlinear. In addition if it was 
     sugar and purified by steam distillation it would light in colour. I 
     would guess the material is the volatile components in the hops and 
     malt, maybe materials such as furfural and other compounds that can 
     polymerize to form the scum you are talking about. Anyone with other 
     ideas?

Subject: Dry Hopping


In HBD #1668 Rob Becker asks about forgotten hops;


Rob,
        It has been my experience that dry hopping produces good results,
but is a pain in the tush. What I have started doing is adding a "hop tea"
with my priming sugar instead.
        Put the hops in a mesh bag, and add to boiling water (2 cups?) for
the same amount of time you should have boiled them with the wort, then
add them to your bottling vessel with your priming sugar(boiled seperately).
        The first few times I tried this, I boiled my hops (in a bag) WITH
my priming sugar. Bad idea. The hops and the gause bag absorbed some of the
priming solution and wouldnt give it back (greedy buggers). I prime lightly
anyway, so I had a couple (slightly) under carbonated batches. I guess you
could add your priming sugar to the hop tea AFTER you have removed the hops,
just dont boil it too much longer, or you could loose some aroma (havent
tried this one, YMMV).
        This procedure also works good to pep up a beer that you decide is
under hopped at bottling time.


Hope this helps,
        Roger

I've had this argument for years with members of my family about 
low-acid foods, and for me it gets down to this:  Pressure canning 
kills almost everything, hot water bath doesn't.  Sure, pressure 
canning takes a lot longer (waiting for the pressure in the canner to 
go down), and requires special equipment.  (A pressure canner big 
enough for 5 quart jars costs about $70 in the DC area.)  On the other 
hand, one of the best ways to get botulism is from home-canned, 
low-acid food.  "Putting Foods By," another good book on canning, has 
interesting statistics from the CDC Mortality and Morbidity Reports on 
this issue.  Plus, exploding mason jars lead to big clean up problems 
and anger from spouses.   


I pressure can my starters because I can easily borrow the pressure 
canner and it's worth the extra time for my peace of mind. Your 
Morbidity May Vary, of course.

I recently received a catalog from a thermometer/hydrometer manufacturer
and all their hydrometers, precision, ASTM and certified included, are of
the paper-in-glass type.  I don't know *for a fact*, but I would expect
distilled water from the market at 60F would measure 1.000 to within the
limits of resolution of your hydrometer.  I wouldn't make any assumptions
about the density of any other material, unless it were a lab reagent.


In addition, based on a third-order polynomial to correct SG for 
temperature,
I concluded corrections for temperatures in the 50-80F range are not
significant. But, we recently acquired a replacement glass hydrometer jar
that is so close to the size of the hydrometer itself that, with high
viscosity worts, I feel it is seriously dampening the hyrdrometer motion and
reduces my trust that the thing is indeed floating.  I noticed one 
commercial
brewer using a large (1 1/4" OD) piece of copper tubing mounted on a base
for its hyrdometer jar--it allows plenty of room for the instrument,
transfers heat well to get the sample down as quickly as possible, doesn't
break, and looks very industrial.  You have to be careful about parallax.

Never heard of the Cat's Meow CDROM--really don't think it exists; please
correct me tho.  Anyway, Cat's Meow III at http://alpha.rollanet.org has
at least two recipes which claim to emulate Fuller's, and each contains
some additional information regarding what is known/not known about this
beer's incorporation of specific hops.  See Jim Busch's as an example.
CM III has about six or so bitters recipes--under Pale Ale category (?).
BTW, your system manager must just go insane with those usernames! :-)

The 1994 Guidelines at The Brewery (http://alpha.rollanet.org) contains
the OG ranges for all the beers, but also contains a hotlink to a table
of the same information--this is a hotlink to a single file that can of
course be downloaded to your local client.  I am in the process of doing
the update to the 1995 Guidelines and will be done this weekend.  The
file should be posted real soon now, along with the 1995 Guidelines
themselves.


One thing that I noticed about the 1994-to-1995 delta is that in nearly
every style the recommended diacetyl levels have been reduced--phrase
changes from "Low diacetyl OK" have in most cases changed to "No diacetyl".
Experienced beer canoyziers please comment on why.  This seems like a
unilateral *definition* of beer styles, rather than a reflection of actual
beer styles as defined by commercial practice--OR, do the 1995 Guidelines
simply reflect more accurately what is actually tasted in real products?

The vinyl tubing you can buy at any hardware store (crystal clear) is rated 
to 140F, but we've used it with a pump to move 180F wort.  It's cheap and
would work fine for your gravity feed setup.  I don't like it because at
operating temperature it has no mechanical strength, it stains, and it does
not get along well with long exposure to chlorine bleach solution.  Its
redeeming quality is availability and cost.  I have not verified that it
contributes taste.

Yes, there are specific gravity ranges, etc. in the 1995 style guide.  Due to
the size of the tables, I have had difficulty figuring out how to put them on a
relativly narrow 80-column screen.  I hope to post a 100-column version by the
end of the week, but it won't be pretty if you can't get it onto a wide screen

"Drip dry" means that you let all the drops fall out, as much as 
possible. It does *not* mean that the surface should be dry. Any residual 
iodine will react instantaneously with organic components of the wort and 
will be gone by the time the yeast is pitched.


Incidentally, the word is spelled "iodOphor". It is the same connecting 
"o" as in "a Sino-Japanese venture" or "Anglo-Indian" or "Bromo-Seltzer".

Subject: Mash Yield/Fermentability Experiments


I have conducted some experiments on mash extract yield and fermentability
as a followup to some work Dr. Fix reported on in Aug. 94 in HBD.  I thank 
Dr. Fix for inspiration for this work and also for technical assistance 
in setting up the experiments and interpreting my results.  I ran the 
experiments to determine the effects of the 40/60/70C mash program on yield
and fermentability in my homebrewery.  While I don't consider the results 
definitive in the realm of mashing grains, I do think they provide useful 
data on the effects of low temperature (40C/105F) mash rests and 
manipulating fermentability via 140F/158F mash rests.
  
  
**  Mash Yield Experiment  **
  
The following experimental mashes were conducted to determine the effects 
on extract efficiency in an infusion mash with the following options:
a) 30 minute rest at 105F 'beta-glucanase/liquification of amylases' 
b) 15 minute rest at 165-170F 'Mash-out'
   
The following conditions were used for all experiments:
   
o Softened carbonate well water boiled 20 min. with 1.5 tsp. CaSO4 / 5 gal. 
  to reduce carbonate/bicarbonate hardness. Used for mash and sparge.
o HDM Belgian Pale Ale malt - 2# grist per mash crushed w/ fixed roller 
  JSP grain mill 
o Total mash water = 1.25qts./lb. grist
o Sparge water = 165-170F / 1.4-1.5qts./lb. grist
o Total sweet wort runoff = 5-6qts. (2.5-3.0 qts./lb.) 
o Sparge time = 10 min. to gather 5-6qts. runoff
o Lautering/Sparging conducted in 5gal. Gott cooler w/ false bottom
o Mash pH 5.3 - 5.5 
  
  
1)Mash-in `at` 155F - hold for 60 min.
  'One-Step Infusion' extract efficiency = 55% = 1.024 s.g./lb. in 1 gal.  
  
2)Mash-in `at` 155F - hold for 60 min - boost to 165-170 F - hold 15 min.
  grist doughed in at mash water rate of 1.25 qts./lb. grist - external 
  heat boost to 165-170F
  'Step Infusion_MO'  extract efficiency = 64% = 1.028 s.g./lb. in 1 gal. 
  
3)Mash-in `at` 105F (0.75 qts. water/lb. grist) - hold 30 min. - boiling 
  water boost (0.5 qt./lb. grist) + external heat to 155F - hold 60 min.
  'Step Infusion_BG'   extract efficiency = 68% = 1.030 s.g./lb. in 1 gal.  
  
4)Mash-in `at` 105F (0.75 qts. water/lb. grist) - hold 30 min. - boiling 
  water boost (0.5 qt./lb. grist) + external heat to 155F - hold 60 min.
  external heat infusion to 165-170F - hold 15 min.
  'Step Infusion_BG_MO' extract efficiency = 71% = 1.031 s.g./lb. in 1 gal.
                          
  
Conclusions:
 o In this experiment, a 30 min. rest at 105F was more effective in 
   increasing yield than a 15 min. 165-170F mashout rest.
 o In this experiment, when a 30 min. rest at 105F was employed, only 
   a minor increase in yield was obtained with a 15 min. 165-170F mashout
   rest.  
  
  
**  Fermentability Experiment  **
  
Several experimental mashes were conducted to evaluate the effects on 
fermentability of 140F/40C rests of 0 min, 15 min., and 30 min. using 
a 40/60/70/75 mash program.
  
Details of this experiment are as follows:
o Mash conditions from Extract Efficiency experiment were used
o A large amount of M&F dried yeast (2 grams /qt.) was pitched to insure 
  complete fermentation
o 20 oz. experimental worts were fermented for 3 days at 66-68F in 
  Korbel (squat) champagne bottles.
  
Worts from the following three mashes were fermented:
  
Mash Rest Temp.105F/40C        140F/60C        158F/70C        167F/75C
Fermentability
High                30 min.        30 min.                30 min.                15 min.
Medium                30 min.        15 min.                45 min.                15 min
Low                30 min.        -                50 min.                15 min
  
Fermentation results are summarized below:
  
Fementability        Original Gravity        Final Gravity        Apparent Attenuation
High                1.052                        1.017                67%
Medium                1.054                        1.019                65%
Low                1.050                        1.019                62%
  
  
Conclusions: Fermentability Experiment
  
o Apparent attenuation trend matched expectations. 
o Apparent attenuation could be further increased by a 45-60 min. rest at 
  140F prior to the boost to 158F.
o Apparent attenuation can be decreased through the addition of specialty 
  malts such as dextrin or crystal malt.

You're correct about the "per" in a chemical name.  Essentially,
peroxides are similar to hydrogen peroxide.  Sodium carbonate doesn't
give off oxygen so sodium percarbonate would have to give off more.
Actually, I would expect sodium percarbonate to be more a stable
peroxide (give off oxygen less readily) than hydrogen peroxide.


Hydrogen peroxide and other peroxides can decompose to give off oxygen
gas.  This is often catalyzed by transition metals such as iron.
However, this is not the mechanism (forming oxygen gas) by which they
exert their sanitizing effects.  Like chlorine in chlorine bleach
(sodium hypochlorite), oxygen in peroxides is in an chemically
unstable, oxidized state.  As such, bleach and peroxides are oxidizing
agent.  Peroxides can, in principle, cause the same kinds of reactions
with organic materials as chlorine bleach does and similarly interfere
with and stop metabolic processes.


Unlike peroxides, bleach doesn't readily undergo decomposition to give
off chlorine gas.  Hope this helps.

This spread sheet was designed using Excel 4.0 for the Mac, but it can
be used by both Mac and Dos based machines since Excel saves its

uploaded two versions, a binhex file for Mac users and a zip file for
Dos users. See the readme.txt file for more info on the spreadsheet.


Right now, you can find it in:

Stephen will probably move them in the next day or two and I am sure he
will post to tell everyone where they have been moved to.

Subject: Differences between bottles and minikegs


Recently, I was at a friend's house, trying his new brown ale from a
minikeg. He was eager for the assemblage to taste the brew, as he had
already tasted the brew from bottles and thought it tasted pretty good.
Imagine his (and our) surprise when we cracked open the keg and found it
to be extremely cidery. What's more, when we tasted the bottled portion of
the batch, it didn't have the same cideryness to it. 


The two containers were brewed at the same time; only the storage methods 
were different. Does anyone know if the method of storage can affect the 
final flavor of a brew?


Here are some more points:
  * the minikeg was a 5 liter job (I don't know more specifics)
  * we had problems with the CO2 cartridge to begin with, and the first
    few glasses came out foam only
  * The recipe he used included some corn sugar (I have suggested he use
    all malt in the future), and only 4 lbs of malt


Any help would be welcome!

unique for the style, and extremely favorable.


River Otter Porter:
        A dark, rich, full bodied ale.  Chocolate malt flavor dominates
this complex ale.  Very soft and qu affable :)


Pale Ale:
        A light golden ale, with significant maltiness, dry hopped with Mt.
Hood hops.


Flashing Amber Ale:
        Rich copper color, full bodied malt flavor with a balanced
bitterness, slight fruitiness and a *GREAT* Cascade hop finish :)


Seasonal/Specialty-Stout:
        Creamy body with a blended taste of coffee and toffee(balanced).
Clinging head throughout.


LongBoat Lager:
        A deep gold Czech style pilsner.  Four week lagering.  Reminded me
of a lot of the *great* Canadian Pilsners at some of the micro-breweries in
Vancouver, BC.


Scottish Ale:
        Complex, malty, full bodied ale.  Six malts and three hops.  Dry
hopped with Chinook.  If I may, this one reminded me of one of my personal
favorites in the Seattle, WA area named as ESB, by Redhook Brewing Co. :)

Subject: Spirit of Free Beer Homebrew Competition


The Washington, DC area is hosting a major regional homebrew
competition on May 20, 1995.  The Third Annual Nation's Capital 
"Spirit of Free Beer" Homebrew Competition is sanctioned by the 
HWBTA/BJCP program.  The contest includes 67 beer styles grouped 
into twelve major classes.  Last year's competition drew 243 entries.


As the competition organizer for the Brewers United for Real Potables
(BURP) homebrew club, I am encouraging brewers of all skill levels to
enter their homebrews in this competition.  The Potomac River Brewing
Company has agreed to accommodate cold storage needs and judging will
take place on-site in closed session to avoid mistreatment of
entries.  This competition is an excellent opportunity to have beers
judged in comparison to beers from a wide geographic region and get
quality feedback.  Scoresheets will be *promptly* returned following
judging.  


Although the primary objective of the homebrew competition is to
provide constructive comments on the entries, we are currently in the
process of assembling a full range of prizes to be sponsored by
regional microbreweries, homebrew supply shops, bars, restaurants,
and others.  More than $2000 worth of prizes ($50-$100 gift
certificates for mail order homebrew supplies, sacks of British malt,
a 3l bottle of Corsendonk Pale Ale, etc.) were awarded at last year's
competition. (1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in each class, plus 1st, 2nd,
3rd place best of show)


The Nation's Capital "Spirit of Free Beer" Homebrew Competition
provides an excellent opportunity for judges participating in the
Beer Judge Certification Program to earn some experience points.  We
expect to exceed the number of entries received at last year's
competition .  We have volunteers willing to provide lodging for
judges staying overnight.  Anyone interested in judging can contact
the Judging Coordinator, Rick Garvin, at rgarvin`at`btg.com.  


Get those fermentation locks bubbling and send us your entries.  If
you would like to recieve an information packet on the Nation's
Capital "Spirit of Free Beer" Homebrew Competition (including full
rules and entry forms), please send private e-mail to me at

I have always wondered how one would scale up say a 5 gal. batch to 100 gal.
Is it just a matter of a 1 to 1 ratio or after some point (x gal.) the ratio

If I am correct, what you are referring to is a post I did a while back on
corrosion of steel as a result of bleach water drying. In that case, when the
water evaporates, the chlorides are concentrated at that spot causing eventual
pinhole corrosion of the steel after repeated wettings. 
I dont know what CABA is, but I like to rinse my chlorine sanitized bottles
with boiled water to prevent chlorophenol tastes in the beer. "Nasty tasting
chlorine compounds crystalizing out" is not accurate. Chlorophenols are formed
after bottling by reactions with the free chlorides and the beer (I think
that's right). Detectable levels of Chlorophenols should not be a problem for
not rinsing, depending on the original concentration, but I do it anyway. I
believe 1 tablespoon per gallon (4 ml/l) is the standard sanitizing
concentration and won't produce detectable levels if the bottles are well
drained.

Hi all,


Okay, I'm going to take a shot at building a RIMS.  I've got most
of the details worked out but I'm not real strong in the
electronics department.  Can anyone give me alternatives to
building the Rodney Morris speed and temperature controllers from
scratch?  I don't mind populating a pre-etched circuit board if
these can be obtained anywhere.  I could even etch my own
given the artwork.  I would also like input on how other folks
built thier heat chambers.  Any help much appreciated.


Thanks, Chris

I emailed for this right after reading the HBD, and got the verbose
description from the mailbot, but then, a few hours later, I got a
very nice chart w/ OG,FG,%alc,IBUs and color from Shawn`at`aob.org.  If
you did not get this, you might want to try again.

Here's one for the HBD chemistry/metallurgy thought center:


Will TSP (trisodium phosphate) react with Cu? In either case (yes or no), is
there a safe soaking time? If so, how long? Overnight?


TIA!
