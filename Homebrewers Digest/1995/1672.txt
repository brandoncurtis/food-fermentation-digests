Subject: Kettle Sight Glass and Fitt


  REGARDING           Kettle Sight Glass and Fittings...


I have yet another way to set up a sight glass in a brewing vessel. If you
haven't already welded or had welded a SS coupling at the bottom of your
vessel or better yet your coupling is removable, drill & tap the top of the
side of the coupling for 1/8" pipe threads. Buy a compression fitting that is
1/8" male pipe thread on one end to 1/4" compression on the other. My source
is on the west coast for SS; Duhig (San Diego, CA 619-549-7805). Buy  how ever
many feet of 1/4" Pyrex tubing you need; Nasco Farm & Ranch (Modesto, CA
209-529-6957, I think they have it.) And lastly, get some 3/4" OD x 1/16" wall
acrylic Plexiglas tubing for a gage shield; My source: Plastics 2000.


Screw the compression fitting into the hole in the coupling, remove the
ferrule from the compression side of the fitting, find an Oring to fit the
1/4" glass tubing, put the Oring on the glass tube, insert the glass tube into
the compression fitting, leave the ferule drive washer in the compression nut
to drive the Oring into the taper seat to make the seal when you carefully
tighten the nut.


Slide the Plexiglas tubing over the Pyrex glass tubing for a gage shield. I
had to file grooves on the inside of the Plexiglas to mate with the
compression nut corners. Find a way to secure the Plexiglas tube to the top of
the vessel rim. Add water, 1 gal at a time to calibrate the Pyrex tube with a
mark.


In my case because of the height of the compression fitting and the curvature
of the bottom of the vessel you won't start to see a level until ~2 gallons.
You might get around this by putting the pipe threads under the coupling and
using two fittings to form a U shape which would lower the margin of the
glass/SS nut lower with respect to the tank bottom.

        I would say that a fair amount of the "good" part of the yeast head
does get included during dropping (or at least the way I do it). I use a long
plastic tube that reaches to the bottom of my fermenter which has a blocked
end and a couple of holes about 3/4 inch from the bottom - this connects to
my syphon. As the level of the fermenting wort goes down and the head reaches
the holes, I would say that a deal of the good yeast head from the underside of
the dirty head will get transferred. All thats left at the end really is the
dirty brown head that is usually fairly solid and pretty impossible to syphon
out.

Subject: Dryhopping/Belgian Malts


Al K. was responding to David's question (sorry I missed it) 
about dryhopping.


<but I only use whole hops or plugs.  I used pellets once 
<and talked to a brewer last Sunday about all the problems
<he had racking a beer dryhopped with pellets (although his 
<beer did smell great!) and I feel that it is much easier to 
<dryhop with whole/plug hops since they float for the 
<most part. 


The clippings(?) left by dryhoppping with pellets are a 
big problem.  What I have discovered to work best is 
to tie one of those small muslin grain bags around the 
end of my racking cane.  I boil up the bag and a rubber 
band (to sanitize) and then attached it to the end.  I keep 
the bag loosely attached so that all the extra folds in the 
bag give a more tortuous route for the clippings to get 
through.  I've found that this works great for me.  


Al's comment that "his [friend's] beer did smell great" 
upon dryhopping with pellets leads me to ask if you have 
found other hop forms, particularly plugs, offer a poorer 
quality?  I will admit to having tried dryhopping with plugs 
and not caring for the _flavor_ (don't recall aroma problems).  
It seemed to add a slight resiny character.  It was not a 
flaw with the beer to start with, honest!  I don't believe it 
to have been the hop variety either.  I did talk to one other 
person who felt that they noticed this same effect.  Has 
anyone else noticed this effect?




Kevin Emery passes along his experiences with biscuit malt


<My advice...  Don't use biscuit, or if you do.... Do so sparingly!


Using it sparingly is good advice for any specialty malt.  I 
have had good success with biscuit malt.  Including a 
recipe with 1 lb. biscuit in a 7 lb. grain bill (i.e. about 15%), 
I wouldn't want to go much higher though.  


m.marshburn (/D202`at`cgsmtp.comdt.uscg.mil) was asking 
about D-C Pils malt, which used to be my malt of choice.  
I always used a protein rest with it.  I prefer 20 min `at` 120F 
and 20 min `at`130F and get no haze problems.  Others may 
have schedules with equally good results.  I believe it was 
the first issue of Brewing Techniques in which there was 
an article on these malts.  As I recall, it suggested a protein 
for both the pale ale and pils, based upon the nitrogen content.


Speaking of Belgian Malts, I purchased some Special B 
over the weekend.  It was malted by HDM (or maybe HGM).  
It's been awhile since I've bought any, but my last purchase 
was DeWolf-Cosyns Special B.  I seem to remember it having 
a kernel of caramelized sugar in it.  The stuff from HDM does 
not, it appears to just be a roasted malt.  Anyone have any 
info on the differences between these two products?

Subject: Re: diacetyl rest (Q) (summary)


Previously, I requested info on fermenting a Pilsner, especially I wanted
someone to explain to me the diacetyl rest.  I recieved a flurry of very
nice and helpful replies and also a few queries so I thought I'd summarize.


Basically, most recommend doing the entire ferment from primary to lager at
low temp, preferably below 50 F.  I should be able to accommodate that.
During the ferment, diacetyl will be produced to some extent.  Eventually,
the yeast will process the diacetyl out, but to hurry this up, one can
temporarily increase the temp to the low 50's for a couple of days.  A
couple people recommended that the best time for this is after the primary
ferment is done and preferably when the S. G. has fallen by about 2/3 of
it's original value.  After the rest, you return to the colder temps to
finish the lagering.


As a couple of people pointed out, the diacetyl rest is not an absolute
necessity, but does hurry the process.


Thanks again to those who replied.

Subject: frementation problems with Weissen


I am a beginner still using brewkits (only two batches) and have had a 
problem with fermentation.  I brewed an Edme Weisen and substituted a 3.5 
lb. can of Alexanders light extract for brewers sugar.  After cooling and 
transferring to a carboy I pitched the yeast and attached by blowoff tube.  
The yeast began to work almost immediately and blew off gasses hard for 24 
hours.  After it slowed I removed the blowoff and attached the airlock late 
that evening.  The next morning the bubbles were already at one per minute.  
What caused this sudden reduction in activity?  I checked the temperature 
and it was at 75, I dropped the temp to around 70 but no activity resumed.  
What can I do now?  Can it be saved, should I just let it sit and see if it 
resumes, can I jump start it?  HELP!  E-mail would save band width.  TIA

I wouldn't be too worried about whatever compounds crystalize out upon
drying actually tainting your beer so long as you rinse the bottles good,
preferably with a jet bottle washer prior to filling.  Papazian does say to
rinse.  I think these salts are likely to be pretty soluble and should
rinse almost instantaneously.


Whether this provides adequate sanitation might be more arguable. I imagine
that the dry surface, coated with chlorine salts, is pretty inhospitable to
most buggers, but I'm no expert there.  I have used this technique though
and I haven't noticed any problem with infection or taste.  I do rinse the
bottles thoroughly before use and my tap water is ~145 F so for all I know
the latter step is doing the real sanitizing.  However, you cannot beat the
'let it soak in mild bleach solution' for doing all your cleaning work.
You just drop 'em in and few days later, pull them out.  Labels, sediment,
glue, everything completely disintegrates or falls off.  I keep a 5 gal
bucket next to my bottle stash that I do this with.  Couldn't be much
simpler.


Now, on the other hand, it is generally a bad idea to let bleach solution
dry like this on any metal surfaces as the bleach will attack it and
eventually pit and wear it down.  This is no big deal for a quick dip &
then a good rinse, but no sense leaving bleach on metal surfaces for a
prolonged time.  I think most plastics could care less about bleach, but
I'm not positive.


I'm sure one of our resident chemists will jump in now with tons of
corrections and clarifications.  :-)

This is not April 1st, so...
Do we have any additional information on this?  I can't understand what Celis'
motivation to sell to MB.  Is Pierre's plan to obtain wider distribution only
or should we expect a Genuine Draft Grand Cru in the next few months.  With
Miller's only apparent motivation being obtaining a chunk of the u-brewery

Hello,


I am brewing an imperial stout recipe that I found in the last issue of
Zymurgy.  At bottling time, the recipe calls for adding lactose and molasses
(the exact amounts for this 3 gallon batch escape me at the moment).  My
question is how should I add them to the beer?
 Do I boil the two ingredients together with a little water?
 Should I still add priming (corn) sugar (I kinda doubt it as the molasses is a
 fermentable sugar unlike the lactose)?


Thanks,

1) I have buiolt storage compartments and livewells for my boat out of 
fiberglass.  Even in our warm temps, and despite the amount of water that
runs through it when operating, my livewell always reeks of resin when I 
open the lid after it's been sitting for a day or two.  Trust me, you 
don't want to make beer in fiberglass anything.  By way of perhaps more
accessible example, go check out newly poured "cultured marble" sink tops
at your local kitchen-and-bath shop.  Many of them are made of the same 
resins.  That distinctive odor is, you guessed it, fiberglass.  Don't ask
what part of it smells - I'm an entomologist; if I'd been smart enough to

    I'm afraid I missed this when it was posted a month ago.  I've 
brewed lagers with the same setup as Phil's with the Hunter temperature 
controller for the garage fridge and a 15-watt light bulb for heat.  It 
worked well, with the fridge turning on for about 5 minutes every 2-3 
hours.  Eventually, however, I came to the same conclusion as Phil:  I 
shouldn't have to run the refrigerator at all when the garage is cold.  
The simplest and cheapest answer to this problem was to build an 
inverter for the Hunter.  This consists of 2 lightweight extension 
cords, a relay, and a small project box.  The relay and project box came 
from Radio Shack, and the extension cords can be obtained inexpensively 
at many places.  My total cost was $12.  By wiring the relay in the 
normally closed configuration, I turned the Hunter from a refrigerator 
controller to a heater (light bulb) controller.  The bulb then cycles on 
and off to maintain the temperature.


    This does not, however, address the main part of Phil's post.  In 
the winter, heating-only is fine, but when springtime comes, you need to 
be able to have both heating and cooling available.  In order to control 
both heating and cooling cycles, you really need two controllers, set at 
slightly different temperatures.  The FermTemp and similar controllers 
simply have a relay in them as described above, so one of two devices 
(heat/cool) is on at any given time.  This means that they will tend to 
fight each other.  Now, I purchased a second Hunter ($25) so that I 
could have the refrigerator go on at 51 deg and the light bulb go off at 
49 degrees.  This should eliminate most of the cycling.  Total cost for 
two controller setup and inverter was $62.  If Phil still owns both a 
FermTemp and a Hunter, he could use the FermTemp as the heating 
controller, and create a similar setup, without spending any more money.

The poppets in all 9 of my kegs are three-legged, interference-fit. Temove
the fiiting from the keg and stand it, bottom down, on a thick piece of
cardboard (the cardboard is to protect your work surface and the poppet
legs). Use  a thin, round tool (I use an allyn wrench) to push down on the
center of the poppet (from the top) until it pops out. 


To put it back in, use a nut-driver into which the poppet shaft will fit
(ID), but which is small enough to fit within the the interference legs (OD).
Drop the poppet back into the barrel of the fitting, and press it in place
with the nut driver.

I'm no expert, but a couple of months ago I looked into this for my first
doppelbock.  As I understand it, the primary should be cooled down 10-15F
from its ferm. temp. before racking to secondary.  Then the *secondary* is bro
ught back up to the diacetyl rest temperature for a couple of days.  This
apparently helps the yeast chew up diacetyl quicker and also purges out any
air that might have snuck in during the racking.  Then you ramp down to your
lager temp at about 2F per day.  Sorry about the vagueness but my notes are
at home.  The lager temp schedule I used was derived from an article in the
Zymurgy issue on Traditional Brewing Methods in England, Germany, and USA.
(Special Issue 1993???  I should just keep my notes here at work.)  My
doppelbock is still lagering so I don't have any idea if what I did worked.

It is important to note that Boiling does not "destroy" the clorox, it 
just drives the Chlorine into the air (be sure you open a window, and 
protect any stainless in your kitchen :>)  Essentially you are distilling 
the Chlorox out of the water.  


In a washing machine, you have an essentially closed system, which keeps 
most of the Chlorine in the machine.  NOTE how aggressive the clorox is to 
your clothes.


Over time, due to the vapor pressure of chlorine, a cold chlorox solution 
will lose its disinfecting power (don't leave the cap off of your bottle).


I'm not sure why you are boiling the clorox, but I wouldn't reccomend it.

Subject: ESB with a lemony taste


Help! What did I do? I have an ESB that tastes, well, lemony. Here's what
I did:
4# Alexander's pale malt syrup
3# Laaglander light DME
10 oz. 60 lovibond crush crystal
6 oz malto-dextrine
1 3/4 Willamette hops (boil)
1 oz Tettnang (finish)
1 oz Tettnang (dry hop)
1 Tsp. Irish Moss
2 tsp. Gypsum
Wyeast #1098 (British)
3/4 c. corn sugar (priming)


I did the usual steeping of crystals in 160 degree water for 30
minutes and boiled the rest of the stuff for 60 minutes. I pitched the
yeast at 72 degrees and let primary (plastic, closed fermenter) go. The
temp. for primary fermentation hovered between 68 and 70 degrees.
I transferred to secondary (glass) and dry hopped.


I am fairly sure of my sanitation procedures, although I worry about 
fermenting in plastic. It has been bottled for a few weeks and it seems
thin and tastes lemony. Could the temp. of the primary fermentation
have contributed to the lemony flavor? Could I have caused problems in
sloshing the primary into the secondary?
 
Any comments would be helpful. I don't really want another five gallons
of lemon-flavored ESB.

Subject: RE: Boiling Clorox


Kinney Baughman asked a few questions regarding Clorox.  Here
are my two cents.  Clorox is a solution containing a compound
that, when it decomposes to salt, releases Chlorine gas.  I'm
under the impression that it is the chlorine gas which does 
the sterilizing.  So in regards to the boiling of Clorox, the 
boiling causes the compound to decompose quicker than it would
for example in your pool.  The result is the unactive salt and
an environment that has been vigorously bombarded by chlorine
gas.  This makes anything that might have been subjected to the
boiled clorox steril but would also leave the clorox `spent.`
I would think that boiling Clorox would be dangers as chlorine
gas is deadly.  In regards to using Clorox in the hot cycle of 
the washing machine, the temperature there is below boiling.
Your water heater might be set anywhere from 140 to 170 deg.
The rate of chlorine gas liberation would seemingly be less in
your washer than in the boil.  Of course I could be off the
mark on this so if some else knows better about this please
chime in.

I got my quarterly SA ad in the mail yesterday, and the front page article
seeks to set people straight on the difference between ales and lagers.


"Even in today's enlightened age, there are quite a few taste-impaired beer
drinkers for whom the _lager_ and _ale_ styles are synonymous--one generic
foamy gulp.


"Most of the rest of us know the general characteristics of each style....


"The differences begin at brew time.  ...is defined by the yeast used in the
brew and the temperature of fermentation....


You get the idea.


BUT THE PHOTO FOR THIS SAME ARTICLE shows four tasty-looking pints.  The
cutline explains that "The Samuel Adams family of beer includes both lagers
and ales in abundant variety.  The year-round brews include, from left:
Cream Stout, a malty, chocolatey lager....
                                 |||||


I'm glad they know their styles so well :-)  It does explain, though, why their
"stout" is so uninteresting.  I suppose to be true to style, they'd have to use
the word "bitter" and that wouldn't make good ad copy.  But why "chocolatey"
instead of "roasty" or "coffeelike" if they wanted to describe a stout (albeit
not _their_ stout)?


If I'm going to drink a SA beer, give me a "Boston Ale" or maybe a doppelbock.
Forget about the others.

Subject: trub-sitting/brown stains/coyote


     Four items:
     
     1. Regarding Kinney's post on trub-sitting--my local fellow brewers 
     frequently identify a "house-taste" in my homebrew. The most sensitive 
     nose/mouth fellow among them identifies it as a "waxy" taste. The 
     taste is pretty much hidden in the heavier stuff (porters/stouts) and 
     most noticeable (but not really objectionable) in the lightest ales 
     I've made. I can tell that this peculiar taste is there and I actually 
     like the taste, so I don't worry about it much. But in trying to 
     trouble-shoot it, I've mostly wondered if the "house-taste" doesn't 
     come from the fact that I always always brew in the primary fermenter 
     only. I haven't racked to a secondary in the last 40 batches. So the 
     "sitting on the trub" is the ONLY common element I've been able to 
     find to account for this taste.  Am I way off, here?
     
     2. Last fall, I asked about avoiding brown stains/scorches on my gas 
     stove top and got lots of suggestions and tried most. One was to use 
     the old boy-scout open campfire trick of soaping up the kettle, only 
     soaping up the stove top. It worked okay with "Dawn"--good enough that 
     it was my "standard" practice for a few brewdays. But then, I was out 
     of Dawn, so I used some "Soft-Scrub With Bleach." Amazingly good! 500% 
     better than Dawn. Don't know why. And it's not from "scrubbing" with 
     the grit in Soft-Scrub--I just wipe it on before starting the mash (I 
     use a Schmidling-esque kettle method) and wipe it off after the boil. 
     TRY IT!
     
     3. Someone asked about brown stains on the ceiling. I'm afraid it's 
     from boiling wort. I always get the brown stains and they run down the 
     plastered ceiling of the stairway to my basement, which opens off the 
     kitchen right next to the stove. Depending on the humidity of the day 
     and the length of my boil, I can predict how bad the brown stains will 
     be. Fortunately, we have a wood-burner in the basement so I can say to 
     my dear one, "Gee, the wood-burner seems to be smoking a lot," and so 
     far she hasn't thrown me out of the kitchen.
     
     4. Where's the Coyote?

My guess is that it is wort (sugar, hops and all).  As the wort boils,
small amounts are cast adrift in the air of your kitchen.  I don't know if
you've seen ultra-slow motion films of bubbles bursting but they break into
_very_ small droplets and these droplets can be propelled off at high
velocities.  They are so small that they can drift pretty far on just
normal air currents. Most of them get sucked up your oven hood but some
escape.  When they hit your kitchen wall, they stick.  Over time they build
up to a noticeable amount.  A similar phenomenom occurs when you cook with
oil or grease.  Of course, this is all just speculation (I haven't done any
ultra-slow motion tracking of boiling wort and drifting droplets) but it
seems to make intuitive sense.

Subject: Superb burners


Michael G. Lloyd inquired about Superb gas burners in HBD 1663.
I have been using one for about 18 months and am very satisfied.
I hooked it up to the natural gas line in my basement and installed
a cheap range hood from the floor (ceiling) joists to vent the 
steam out the laundry vent. I make sure that I have adequate cross 
ventilation.


It is true (if I recall the specs that came with the stove) that
it generates "only" 35,000 BTUs, but I find it to be more than
adequate for doing 8-10 gallon boils. 


I have not used a "Cajun cooker" or similar stoves but understand
that they work something like a torch or a jet engine. The Superb
has dozens of small holes and is really a large diameter version
of a typical gas range. The flame is easy to control and evenly
distributed. In fact, I use it to stir fry, something  which really 
is not possible in the true sense of the term on a conventional 
household range. Since I use natural gas rather than propane, I 
readily monitor its efficiency since I also use gas for
the furnace (not insignificant usage in these parts), hot water,
and dryer.


They are distributed by at least two homebrew suppliers here in the
Minneapolis/St. Paul area and I am told that they have been selling
well to satisfied customers.
