Subject: cheap water pump


Two quick things: First, the best source for a cheap water pump (free, in 
my case) is old dishwasher pumps. They are stone simple pumps, designed 
to handle all sort of particulate garbage, and come complete with motor 
controller and bypass/dump solenoid if you are so inclined. I used one 
mounted under a small "table" affair with an inverted plastic carboy with 
the bottom removed to make a super immersion chiller. The carboy is the 
reservoir, ice is added (I have two brew fridges so I have excess freezer 
capacity. I freeze bricks of ice in tupperware and use it all on brewday 
to cool wort.) along with water, the pump shots it through hose to 1/2" 
copper tubing immersed in hot wort and the return water, now warm, is 
shunted aside for the first few minutes, then later water is 
recirculated, chilled by ice, and so on. The cheap pump is the heart; all 
this wouldn't be worth it if cost was high. This pump is designed to chew 
up food, so ice chips don't phase it. Frankly, I can't find any 
drawbacks-just use a GFI to safety yourself, and don't pump any fluid 
that will ever be consumed by humans-these pumps come really fouled with 
years of spooge!


Second, I also made a counterflow chiller (wanted to use a hopback, so 
immersion was out) of hose, male adapters, and non-valved "Y" fittings. I 
forgot who mentioned this earlier, but great and beery minds must move 
together, because this system works cheaply and well. One thing I did 
find out was that you can use plastic washer nozzles (just a cheap cone 
of plastic sold for washing walks and so forth and available in the lawn 
and garden section of the hardware) as the thimbles (?) for the 3/8" 
copper where it exits from the "Y". Drill the nozzle out almost to size, 
use a tapered reamer to slowly remove plastic until copper is a tight 
slip fit through nozzle. Slide nozzle over tubing, screw onto "Y" and all 
done. I didn't even have to silicone it. No leaks.


This counterflow chiller is being hooked up to the recirculating ice 
water pump system above. I have put another "Y" in line with the water 
line from the pump through the chiller. This "Y" has valves and the other 
side flows back to the water resrvoir. The result is that I can determine 
the flow rate of ice water through chiller using a shunt bypass rather 
than a motor speed control. The pump is never overloaded and with a 
thermometer probe inline with the chilled wort I can "dial-in" the exact 
temp I want the wort chilled to prior to pitching.


Enough BW... Happy Brews to you!

Jeff Hewit (jhewit`at`freenet.vcu.edu) comments on Flag Porter and
Norvig Ale and asks:


>Does anyone know more about these beers?  How much is true, and
>how much is pure marketing BS?  BTW, neither appears to have
>any yeast sediment to use as a starter for "Jurassic" Homebrew.


I went to a beer dinner last November at the Brickskeller in DC 
where Alan Eames, the beer historian/anthropologist, was speaking 
about these beers.  He has something (although I'm not sure exactly 
what) to do with their now being available commercially.  The 
stories as you posted them are the same stories he told, and I have 
no reason to doubt their truth.


The yeast for the Flag Porter came from a bottle that was found in
a ship recovered from the English Channel.  The bottle was taken
to a lab, and they discovered it was beer which still contained
viable yeast.  They managed to culture it.  Eames also claimed that
the beer used a "traditional 1850" porter recipe - but really 
didn't go into much detail on how he got this.  He did claim that
his research had convinced him that the original porter was made
with beans as part of the grist - this was the only part of his
story that I found highly dubious, although I suppose it is possible.
He did say that the Flag Porter did not contain beans.


As for the Norvig Ale, that story also is as you say, and Michael
Jackson's influence has been documented by MJ in a letter to the
Barleycorn.  The Norwegian beer making tradition apparently involves
passing down "beer totems" from generation to generation.  These
totems are used to stir the fermenting beer, thus picking up yeast
(and numerous bacteria) that is added to the next batch when it is
stirred.  Michael Jackson managed to come into possession of a totem
that had been passed down for many generations, had a lab culture
the yeast, and, again, a beer was made using it.  I don't know what
the recipe is based on, but it is not very hoppy, and definitely
contains what we would now call "off-flavors", although I suppose
that they could also be described as "a rare taste of the ancient
Scandinavian ales of legend" - depending on your perspective.


It was an interesting speech, and I always enjoy reading and
listening to Mr. Eames, although I do always try to keep a healthy
dose of skepticism.  Still, he has done more research on traditional
brewing methods than anyone of whom I am aware.


As for the beers, I agree completely with your assessment of the
Flag Porter - interesting, but not exceptional and certainly not
worth the price I've seen in stores.  The Norvig Ale was complete
swill, IMO, and only interesting for the story behind it.  Now that
I have heard the stories, I don't feel the need to buy either of
these products!  :-)

Subject: Hop family tree/ CP's OG calculations


In HBD #1673:


Don posted a family tree for hops. This is a great idea, and looks 
interesting. I'm particularly interested in the Fuggles line. Don states 
that Fuggles or Hallertauer are the root of all hops. I was under the 
impression Cluster was the oldest hop variety and was perhaps the 
ancient ancestor. I'm also wondering where all the older bittering 
varieties such as Bullion and Northern Brewer fit into this scheme.


*****
Ralph is understandably confused about Charlie's calculations of the 
contribution of successive pounds of DME to wort OG. I, too, am starting 
to wonder if Charlie is from the Delta Quadrant. Look at the table on 
Page 268 and you will find that 1 lb/gal. gives 40 points, a second 
pound adds another 30 points, the third pound adds another 40 points, a 
fourth pound adds only 20 points, and a fifth pound adds 20 points. What 
kind of strange polynomial equation predicts this kind of relationship?


DME contributes about 42 points per pound per gallon. Thus if you add 10 
pounds of DME to 5 gallons you get 42 X 10 / 5 = 84 points, giving you 
an OG of 1.084. This is what Suds calculates. Adding your 1/2 lb of 
Crystal (24 points/lb/gal) and 1/4 lb of Chocolate (20 pts/lb/gal) would 
give you 84 + 2.4 + 1 = 87.4 points (1.087). No rocket science.

Hello:


***Warning - slightly off Homebrew Topic ***
 -but still related-


Our used refrigerator, circa 1975, finally died.  I would like to have a
spare refrigerator for lagering and storage of my brew.


1. Is it worth a service call to find out what is wrong, or should I just
junk the thing ?


2. Is there anything that I could check to service the thing myself ?


3. Is there a better forum/listserv that someone knows about to find out the
answers to these questions ?

I will be in St. Louis for 5 days (Union Station Area) starting March 12, and
would be interested in brew pubs, breweries, homebrew shops,  and beer
related activities in the area.  Please reply by e-mail to save bandwidth.


Kinney Baumann  mentioned that he would hate to leave hot break in the
fermenter but that cold break was no problem.  Please correct me if I am
mistaken, but I was under the impression that hot and cold break were
basically the same thing-- coagulated proteins--, and it was just a matter of
degree or amount of break material that precipitates out with temperature
changes.


Dan McC posted a method for using a spectrophotometer for estimating hop
bitterness using isooctane and octyl alcohol.  Is it really as simple as it
sounds, and is it reproducible with worts of different colr and densities?

Subject: Wort Pump




 I've been seeing allot of questions regarding Wort Pumps with most 
people pursuing Aquarium solutions.


 May I suggest a boat bilge pump. They're small, portable, plastic, 
submersible, cheap and move plenty of volume. They'll push from 450 GPH 
to over 1000 GPH depending on model. A 450 GPH version will cost around 
$20. Some are available with a built in float switch that will turn them 
on and off in the presence of fluid.


 They run on 12 VDC, use very little current and can be powered from 
battery or power supply. Could be the perfect solution.

David asks:


<I noted with interest Jim B's comments about a low-temp rest increasing 
<the content of precursors of 4-vinyl-guaicol.  Jim, does this mean that 
<these precursors are there, but can only be made into bona fide phenols

Note that I specifically quoted Warner on this, this is where I first 
heard of it, but Im quite certain that Eric knows of what he speaks.  I
feel there are two issues going one here, the first is providing the 
required precursor, ferrulic acid, in the wort.  The second is providing
a yeast strin that can consume this and decarboxylize this into 4-vinyl
guaiacol.  This second part is the key to your question, as you noted.
Certainly, using a yeast like Wyeast 1056 in an american wheat ale (yuck!)
will not result in a phenol beer.  So, go ahead and do a low temp rest to
handle all those gums in wheat but use a clean yeast.

I did mean the cylinder part.  I dont like the idea of going to the 
effort of welding a cone onto a keg.  I guess it can be done, especially
if you are a welder or know a cheap, good one.  Just buying and rolling a
cone is not cheap. I think it is a lot better to weld to a more sturdy
and thicker sidewall than a keg.  If you use 304 SS, 12-14 guage it will
be plenty strong enough.  I just think you need to carefully consider all
the costs and then make a tradeoff decision.  Maybe if you get the welding
done cheap enough, and find a cheap way to get a cone, you might get it 
done for $200.  Id be suprised if it can be done for $100, assuming you
are paying for a welder.  Also, dont neglect to include the work required
to polish the interior welds to a sanitary finish.  If you dont do this, 
its not worth doing.  Dont get me wrong, the keg may be a great way to
go, but you might end up paying 75% of the cost of something that will 
be a better fermenter.  Also, consider a simple open fermenter made from
a cylinder, you can still harvest yeast from the top or the bottom after
you rack/keg the beer.


<I interpreted Will's suggestion (HBD #1667) to mean he wanted to have a 
<bottle in place into which the yeast/trub would collect on a *continuous*

I dont see the advantage of this over just opening and closing a valve when

    Some Questions on Making Soda Pop at home with Home Brewing
                            Equipment


    -   for Christmas my wife ordered me a home brewing kit being
    sold at a discount through the Damark mail order catalog.  This
    kit inlcuded the equipment needed to brew app. 3.5 gallons of
    beer - plastic fermentor, caps, capper and some canned extract
    with dry generic 'beer yeast'.  It also included a bottle of
    root beer 'extract', a package of dry Red Star yeast and
    instructions on making the root beer.  I made the root beer
    according to the instructions - basically: mix up warm water
    with sugar, add extract, prepare Red Start yeast with some warm
    water then add to mix - then bottle right away and store in the
    dark at app. 65 degrees F.  Worked great.  Now I have gone and
    purchased from a local homebrew supplier some more soda extracts
    and tried one batch, using the extract instructions (same as the
    ones with my kit) and the homebrew store guy sold me Nottingham
    dried ale yeast to use.  Well, what is happening is the ale
    yeast is 'top fermenting' in the bottles and leaving a nasty
    ring and residue at the top of the soda as well as dropping to
    the bottom of the bottles.  I have given the bottles over 6
    weeks now, some warm and some cold and the scum on the top of
    the bottles just sits there.  My original batch with the Red
    Star yeast (didn't say anything more than that on the label)
    did not have this problem - all the yeast residue ended up on
    the bottom of the bottle and I don't remember seeing anything
    at the top of the bottle during the process.  From watching my
    own ales ferment I realize this scum at the top is what shows
    up with the beer, which leads me to the question (I know - long
    winded!):


    -   should I be using something other than ale yeast (like 
    whatever that Red Star strain was)?


    -   should I be letting it do its thing in the fermenter for a
    day or two then siphon into bottles to avoid the scum?  (would
    this produce some alcohol?)


    Thanx for any and all information!!!

I have used the TEEL 1/25 HP magnetic drive pump listed in the Grainger
catalog to pump 200 degree F wort into my CF wort chiller for about 15
five gallon batches.  My guess is that my application is a bit more
demanding than the one Mr. Put described in his HBD article.  This pump
has performed flawlessly in every single use.  I open the pump head
(after I have rinsed it by pumping fresh water through the system)
following each use to dry it off and inspect the pump.  The pump still
shows no sign of wear.  I have no reason to think that this pump will
not serve me for fifty years.

Absolutely *not* an issue.  That table has an error or two in it.
And one of those errors is in the "Beer" row.  Think about it.  What
is in beer?  Water, sugar, ethyl alcohol, some organic acids, and a
several other compounds in incredibly small amounts.  What does the
table say about water and polypropylene?  No effect.  Sugar solutions?
No effect.  Ethyl (or methyl, propyl, isopropyl, and hexyl for that
matter) alcohol?  No effect.  What about acids?  Check out acetic,
carbonic, lactic, phosphoric, sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric
acids.  No effect.


Check out the "Whiskey and Wines" row in that table.  No effect on
polypropylene.  Kind of makes one wonder just what was in that "beer"
that had a "Severe effect - Not Recommended (satisfactory up to 72F)"
on polypropylene.  Must have been Miller Lite.  :-)  In any event, it
isn't anything that *brewers* need to be concerned with.


The fact is that glass reinforced ("glass-filled") polypropylene is
pretty tough stuff until you put it into some seriously nasty organic
solvents, none of which are going to get anywhere near your beer.


Some other useful properties of glass reinforced polypropylene (from a 
Special issue of a Materials Engineering peridical that I keep around):


        Water Absorption (24hr):        0.02% - 0.05%
        Heat Deflection Temp:           275F  - 310F `at` 66  psi
                                        250F  - 300F `at` 264 psi
        Continuous Use Temp:            250F


The heat deflection temperature is the temperature/pressure combination
required to cause a permanent deformation of the material.  The 264 psi
pressure value is applicable in this application since the pump impeller
does experience quite a bit of pressure.  The moisture absorption
*might* be an issue if you were planning to use the pump continuously.
In this case there is the possibility of slightly increased pump head
wear over *years* of use.  In any event, few homebrewers (or microbrewers
for that matter) need be concerned with continuous use of their pumps.


The temperature specification on the magnetic drive pumps in the 
Grainger catalog is not there for the materials in the pump head,
but for the cooling characteristics of the *motor* used to drive
the pump.  All of those motors in the pumps are fan cooled.  Fan
cooling looses its effectiveness when you have a hot fluid flowing
past the motor housing.


Not to worry, however, the motors used to drive these pumps have
built in thermal protection.  The worst that will happen is the pump
will shut off if it gets too hot, just like your hair dryer.  Not that
this matters in Mr. Put's application since he expects to pump cooled
wort.


The pump I use is rated for use with fluids up to 180F.  I use it to
pump 200F wort for about 15 minutes when I brew.  The pump is only
starting to grow warm by the time I am finished using it.  Remember,
these specifications are written by engineers, and, for a variety of
good reasons, engineers write incredibly conservative specifications.
I should know.  I'm an engineer.


I am planning to move to a 10 gallon brew length soon.  I plan to use
this same pump in the same fashion for the larger brew length.  I have
no reason to think that it will not be able perform its job for many
years to come in this even more demanding application.


Hope this information helps someone.

Reminded me about streaking walls.  This is due to the humidity produced 
when boiling the wort.  The brown/colored streaks are due to dripping 
moisture.  The solution?  Wash the walls occasionally.  (no jab at anyone's 
cleanliness)


Ronald also says he has a wood burning stove.  The dirt on his walls is 
probably soot from the stove.  Smokers will also notice a marked increase in 
this phenomenom.

ummm... if you are planning on running the hot output from the chiller over 
the ice and recirculating it through the chiller in a "closed" system you 
are going to melt all your ice in the first few minutes.  The initial output 
from a immersion chiller actually steams.


I suggest you slow your water flow down a bit and stir the wort constantly 
during the chilling.  Granted I have a 50 foot coil of 3/8 copper tube, but 
I chill 7 gallons of boiling liquid down to pitching temperature in around 5 
minutes using this method.

I'm probably opening myself up as flame bait with this one, but a similar

I'm hoping that Miller will help Celis distribute more of his good product 
to more areas that he couldn't reach before, thus helping to educate the 
unninitiated just that much more.


Now if AB had bought him out... that would be a different story.

Subject: "Free" carboys/Freezing yeasts


Somewhere over the past week or so I read that both photo processing shops
and metal finishing shops get various chemicals and reagents in glass carboys
and often pitch them out after using the chemicals.  I can't find the
original post/article to respond to the poster.  Does anyone have any info on
this?  Can we really get "free" carboys?  I don't know what chemicals might
be delivered in these things but would be concerned about cleaning.  Anything
that phjot developers use probably won't do a homebrew much good.
Frugal Brewer are you out there?  Any comments?


I've just been given a yeast sample that has been described as
"irreplaceable" and would like to store it for posterity.  I'm afraid that it
might mutate is kept only on slants or plates and was thinking about freezing
it in glycerol.  Like my home autoclave, my liquid nitrogen tank is on the
fritz <g> so I was going to just freeze it in the better halfs freezer--if I
can find room amongst the hops!  ;-)  Can anyone tell me if normal household
glycerol is acceptable.  Does it have to be treated, read sanitized, in any
way before adding the yeasties?  Should I just scrape as much off a slant or
plate as I can and mix real well or can I take some slurry from the bottom of
a starter and mix it about 2:1 (in favor glycerol) and freeze that.  Any
comments would be appreciated.  Apologies to Dominick Venezia--I know you
commented on this once before, but that was when I was just getting started
and I can't find your post.


Finally, what category does ouatmeal stout fall into for the AHA style based
competitions?  Is it in the classic dry category or can it vary by sponsor
definition?

I've had several packages of extremely bad plugs, but they
were few and far between.  The distributor did not hesitate
to replace them.  Their quality was obviously bad upon opening.
In stead of the wonderful, familiar hop aroma they smelled
cheezy or like hay.


Well-packaged hops of all types (pellets, plugs, whole) all
have fine aromatic properties.  Actually, pellets seem to have
the most intense aroma.  This is not surprising since the lupulin
glands have been broken open during the pelletizing.  No, actually,
what I meant was, that despite all the troubles my friend had
bottling (he had put the pellets into his keg and they clogged
the diptube), the beer had a great aroma.  The one time I used
pellets was in the primary and I think that I may have put them
in too early.  Shortly after I added the pellets, they sank and
then were covered up by settling yeast.  The resulting beer had
a rather faint hop nose, far weaker than a similar beer made with
whole hops.

"Resiny" is a term I use to describe the nose on several varieties
of hops, most notably East Kent Goldings, British Columbian Goldings,
Styrian Goldings and Nugget.  Did you use one of these hops?  Also,
flavour and aroma are rather intimately linked.  Without our noses,
we can only sense four flavours, the ones we call "tastes."  Combined
with our sense of smell, the four tastes linked with the hundreds of
aromas we can distinguish are what we term as "flavours."

Wait a week for the yeast to settle and bottle.  It's just about done.  At
75F it is not uncommon for a batch of beer to completely ferment in two to
three days.  This is the most common question I answer from beginners.  They
are surprised that beer can be done in a few days.  Often they miss the
fermentation completely.  They pitch the yeast and then come back to look at
the airlock two days later and there is no activity.  Yes, but... there is
almost always a brown ring of crud in the fermenter, just above the level of
the beer.  This ring is what I ask the brewers to look for (I'm usually
answering these questions on the phone) and inevitably it's there.  I tell
them that they simply missed the main part of the action and that the ale
should be ready to bottle in about a week or so.

Don writes about the Hop Family Tree.


In some cases it does help to know the genetic relationships of hops,
but in most cases, it does not.  Cascades, for example, were an attempt,
if memory serves correctly, to be a Fuggle replacement.  You can smell
that as a Fuggle replacement it was a catastrophic failure, but I personally
love the grapefruity aroma of Cascades and am glad that the the experiment
went astray.  Also, consider that Fuggles and Styrian Goldings are related,
but in my opinion, Styrian Goldings have a resiny aroma that has more in
common with East Kent Goldings than the woody, earthy Fuggles.  If indeed
Chinook is related to EKG, then that was another experiment that took an
unexpected turn -- the two hops couldn't smell more different.

>Has anyone had trouble with Wyeast California Lager producing DMS?


I have not.  Some yeasts have a tendancy to produce sulphury aromas,
but none that produce DMS.  DMS can be produced by bacteria, however.
You may have gotten a bacterial infection that took till conditioning
time to reach sensory threshold.

That has happened to me.  I finally thought ot look at the cap and

boiling) and therefore hadn't seated properly.  I just soak caps in
bleach now.

This is possible.  I usually put the priming solution in the bottom
of the bottling vessel just as I start racking into it from the
fermenter.  The beer jet from the siphon mixes it all quite nicely.

It's possible that was too much bleach, but if most of the batch was
fine, I doubt this is your problem.
