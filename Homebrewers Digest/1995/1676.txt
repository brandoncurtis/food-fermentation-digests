Joseph_Fleming_at_GSA-2P__2`at`ccgate1.gsa.gov asks about using sugar
to prime.  Someone else will have to comment on priming with gyle,
but I usually use DME.  However, I've used corn sugar in the past
and cane sugar when I've run out of DME.  I can't taste the
difference.  Malt seems to take a little longer to carbonate.


However, I have a friend who's stongly allergic to corn.  Allergies
are probably the only strong argument I can conceive for avoiding
any particular sugar.


Think about it: you're priming with 1/4 pound of sugar after you
ferment with 6-10 # of malt.

Just a brief note to reming you all that the deadline for the 1st annual 
World Cup of Beer is fast approaching (it is March 15th, finals are the 
26th).


All is shaping up for an excellent fun competition, with great judging 
(many local judges, professional brewers, and the like (including Michael 
Lewis from Davis)). We are also expecting a great party which will 
provide a chance to share homebrew, and chat with the judges and other 
participants.


If you never got the origninal information (or lost it) email me

This is one of my favorite topics.  Malt extract contains protein and corn
sugar does not.  If you do use DME to prime, I suggest you boil it well
and force-chill it (just like a small batch of beer) to settle the cold
break.  Pour off the priming solution, but don't add the break.  After
several experiments, I've convinced myself that the "ring around the collar"
in my DME-primed bottles was actually protein and NOT an infection.  Switching
back to corn sugar eliminated the ring along with the need to force-chill the
primings.  1/3- to 1-cup of corn sugar is not going to alter the flavour of
a 5 gallon batch of beer.  There's just not enough there to make a difference.
Some have reported that priming with extract gives finer bubbles.  I have
not noticed a difference personally, but Dave Miller claims that it takes
some time for the produced CO2 to dissolve in the beer (or something like
that).  Perhaps it's the fact that it takes longer for DME-primed beers to
carbonate that makes the DME-primed beers appear to have finer carbonation.

Sure.  The second to last issue of Zyumurgy had an article on this.  They
actually tested something like 20 different extracts.  I believe it was
the Winter `95 issue.


****
There were two posts about flat or inconsistent carbonation.


My question is: Did you boil the bottlecaps to sanitize?  This could be
the problem.  Smartcaps (PureSeal) bottlecaps lose their ability to
absorb oxygen if you boil them, but boiling *regular* caps can damage the
plastic liners which can lead to leaking.  If you did not boil the caps,
perhaps your capper is not adjusted correctly and is not crimping the
caps on far enough.  Finally, were these plastic-lined or cork-lined caps?
If they were cork-lined, I would be surprised if they *didn't* leak.

Subject: Yeast Washing


 PGILLMAN`at`POMONA.EDU asks about references on washing yeast.


Hough, Briggs, Stevens and Young, "Malting and Brewing Science", Chapman
and Hall, London,1982 discuss this on p767 of Vol II, They state that the
pH should never fall below 2.8.


Broderic, H.M. ,Ed. "The Practical Brewer", Master Brewers Association of
America, Madison, WI 1977 covers washing on p216-217. pHs from 2.2 - 2.8
are mentioned with contact times reduced at lower pH. A warning is given
that  chemical washing "..represents a drastic measure which may affect the
yeast and its brewing performance."


DeClerk, J "A Textbook of Brewing", Chapman and Hall, London, 1957 briefly
mentions washing with a 1:1000 solution of phosphoric acid to kill lactic
infection (Vol I, p 405).


Hardwick, W.A., Ed. "Handbook of Brewing", Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York,
1995 has the most thorough treatment of the four references and also
mentions a range of pHs from 2 - 2.8 with contact times varying. See pp
193-194. They mention that there is debate as to whether washing is a good
idea or not but feel that it is OK if properly carried out.

Subject: Yeast in Septic/Celis/Mead






Charles Deaton asked about the impact of yeast on his septic tank.
        Years ago when a septic tank was "slow", people would 
drop a cake of bakers yeast in to get the action going again.  
The brewers yeast you are dumping down your drain should be doing
the same.  Most ot the chemicals that go down the drain are 
harmful to the bacteria at work in the septic tank (detergents etc
The yeast dumping practice is probally beneficial. And no, your
septic tank will not explode because of it.


Someone (not sure who) posed the question why would Pierre sell-
out to Miller.  Answer:$$$  He sold out to Interbrew didn't he?


Question: Does anyone have the address to "The Mead Lovers Digest"?
I know its out there but I don't know where.  TIA

        Greetings!


         I was wondering about the extraction rates of malted
wheat. Can I expect to get the same amount of sugars from
wheat as I would from malted barley? Does any one know how
many points/ pound/ gallon that I should expect from using
malted wheat?
        Any information on the above will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: More on Extract Yield and Mash Out


I looked up a reference on my earlier statement on mash extract and
temperature.  The following is from Malting & Brewing Science, Vol I. Pg.
328


        "The sparge temperature is often as high as can be achieved without
        extracting any unconvertd starch from the goods, usually around 77C
        (170F). This means that the temperature of goods, which falls slightly
        during the stand period, gradually rises to above 74C (165F) by the end
        of the sparge.  The efficiency of extraction is enhanced by the increase
        in temperature because both viscosity of the wort is reduced and the
        rate of diffusion of dissolved substances from within the grist
        particles is enhanced."

Subject: Maple and Dry-hopping


Hello HBDers,


You all deserve a pat on the back for the stimulating discussion lately.  I 
only wish I could contribute something equally interesting, but instead I 
have a couple questions.  


Maple:  'Tis the season in Michigan for collecting the sweet runnings....from 
the Maple trees.  My questions are:  1. How should the direct sap be processed 
for use in brewing (I've never made maple syrup) and 2. How much should be used?


Dry-hopping:  I want to dry-hop a pale ale in the secondary for additional 
aroma.  I only have pelleted hops in my arsenal.  Previously I've microwaved 
the hop pellets briefly to sanitize and just added them free to the 
secondary.  The resulting aroma was very nice, but the hops were a bit 
problematic when racking.  This time I thought I would use a weighted muslin 
bag, but I would like to pick the collective brain regarding sanitation.  
Does microwaving sanitize effectively and does it drive off desirable oils?  
I want to avoid boiling if at all possible---would pasteurizing (as with fruit)
sanitize without driving off aromatics?  Am I paranoid and should I just drop 
them in with reckless abandon?  


Thanks for any info!  Brew on, brethren (and brewsters).

The PVC type is less efficient due to the flow over a bulk of tubing as

Two things I can say about AHA publications is that they are all very

9.95 for the Home brewers Companion through the AHA, yet I also had to pay
$3.00 postage. That comes to $12.95. My local homebrew shops had it for
$11.00 (the list price) and one had it for $9.00.

Don't buy a "cheap Mill" get a Schmidlings malt mill ($135.00).
You can make an immersion chiller for under $30.00 or a counter flow for

This argument doesn't really make sense.  The wort prepared for brewing
is fermented almost immediately, unlike the canned wort.  During
fermentation, several things happen to make the environment inhospitable
to botulism:  alcohol is produced, the amount of sugar decreases, and
the pH drops.  Since these things start happening almost immediately,
there's no opportunity for botulism to take hold.  In a can of
unfermented wort, none of these things happen, so botulism can survive
and grow.  I wouldn't risk it.

Subject: Mini-Kegs & CO2


I received a 5L mini-keg system (Fass-Frish) from my brother for an X-Mas
present.  I finally got around to tapping my first one last weekend.  I
experienced the same problem that many folks on the HBD have spoke of; when
using the 8g CO2 cartridges, about half of the gas leaked out before I could
get the cartridge holder on tight enough to stop it.  Having to use 3 carts
for one keg did not make me happy :-(  So a I called GW Kent in Ann Arbor, MI
to discuss this problem with them. They informed me that the Party Star Deluxe
system that I have (and all of the Party Star taps, I think - except the hand
pump) are designed for use with the 16g CO2 carts.  They told me that 8g carts
should only be used as a last resort (my system came with a box of 8g carts.!)
There is apparently a significant difference in the tip of the cart. between
the 16g versus 8g; the 8g being much more prone to leaks.
I took the oppertunity to mention that the PA-based homebrew stores (those in
the Philly area anyway) charge an arm-and-a-leg for the 16g carts. ($13-14 for
a box of ten versus $4.95 for a box of ten 8g carts.)
They gave me that name of a couple of shops in Minnesota that sell the 16g
carts at a reasonable price (I ordered two boxes yesterday at $8.98/10).
If anyone is interested, drop me a note and I'll share the names of those
stores with you.

Jeff:  I tasted both of these recently - actually had to buy them
because the tasting at the local beer store ran out of them.  I did not
really care for the taste of either, but I would encourage you to
try the Norvig Ale for yourself.  However; taste aside, I really
like the story behind each - hype or not!  Bought 'em both based
on that alone - one bottle each.  I imagine I will buy at least one
more of the Flag Porter at some point to revisit it and give it a fair
shot.

Subject: Well chlorination


Robin Hanson asks about well chlorination.


Here's the routine:
Dump 2 or 3 gallons of Chlorox type down the well.
If the well cap is above ground, just take the top off and dump it in. If the
well cap is not above ground, you should find a vent pipe along side where
the waterline comes in . This vent is often about 1/4 inch diameter or so.
Tape a small funnel onto this and turn on a faucet or two and let them run.
Once the pump kicks on and begins pumping water out of the well, air will get
sucked into the vent line. This is when you pour the Chlorox into the funnel-
so it gets sucked into the well. Take it slowly, this is an easy way to
bleach your clothes (insert voice of experience).
Once the chlorox is in the well, turn on every cold water faucet and let run.
When you smell chlorine at a faucet turn it off(do this at each ). This gets
the chlorine throughout the distribution system. Leave for at least 12 hours,
then run water out of each faucet until the chlorine smell disappears.


If the well was put in properly, you shouldn't have to do this again unless
the casing is cracked and lets surface water run in. Here in New York State,
the recommendation is tohave your well water TESTED every year. This is
bacteria, not chemical.
Your odor problem is mostlikely from something else. Around here, some people
have a nasty sulfur smell in their water. This developed in my mother's well
after 25 years of nice fresh smelling water.
Your local cooperative extension should have some well info so you can learn
about what you have.

Subject:       Dry Hopping: pellets Vs whole


In HBD#1674 Alan Van Dyke points out the problems with using a hop 
tea instead of putting the hops in the (secondary) fermenter.


>The problem with the hop tea is the boiling.  The boiling water will 
>drive off the very thing you're trying to put into the beer- the 
>volatile aroma.


Alan also mentioned in the preceeding paragraph that he uses pellets 
instead of whole hops because of conveniences.


>..because they are easier to get into the carboy.  No fuss, no muss.


Since Alan is very correct that the point of dry hopping is to put 
the aromatics into the beer, I would suggest trying whole hops or 
plugs.  Have you ever compared the smell of plug hops to pellets?  
The plugs smell WONDERFUL!  It is my understanding that, while 
pellets are fine for their bittering properties, they loose some of 
their aroma due to the volitile nature of these aromatics.  I'm not 
suggesting that you can't use them for flavoring at all, just that 
whole hops might be better, conveniece aside.  


I am currently waiting for a batch to finish in my primary.  I 
plan on transfering it into the secondary with 1 oz. of Cascade 
plugs weighted down in a muslin grain bag.

 -shake vigorously for 15 minutes.
 -centrifuge to separate the phases.
 -read organic phase at 275 nm (1 cm cell) vs blank (20 mL isooctane, 
     50 uL octyl alcohol).
Notes: 
1) isooctane should have an Abs`at`275 <0.005.
2) readings should be done ASAP due to decomposiotin by UV light

 -place 5.000 +/- .001 gr pulverized hops in an extraction bottle and add 
     100 mL toluene
 -shake for 30 min with vigorous agitation
 -let stand until clear or centrifuge (preferred)


Dilution A
 -dilute 5.0 ml of this extract to 100 mL with methanol.


Dilution B. 
 -dilute an aliquot of the dilution A with alkaline methanol (0.2 mL 6M 
     NaOH per 100 mL MeOH) so that the Abs at 325 and 355 falls within 
     the most accurate range of the instrument. 


 -Immediatly read diluion B (1 cm) at 275, 325 and 355 vs a toluene blank 
     that was prepared and diluted in EXACTLY the same manner. 


Calculations:


dilution factor, d=  (volume dil A x volume dil B)/ (500  x aliq extract 
     A x aliq dil A)


% alpha acids= d x (-51.56 A355+ 73.79 A325-19.07 A275)
% beta acids= d x (55.57 A355-47.59 A325 + 5.10 A275)


Example: 
5 gr hops extracted with 10 mL toluene

3 mL Dilution A diluted to 50 mL with alkaline methanol
A355=0.615
A325= 0.596
A275=0.132


d = (100 x 50) / (500 x 5 x 3) = 0.667
alpha = 0.667 x [ -(51.56 x 0.615) + (73.79 x 0.596) - (19.07 x 0.132) = 6.5
beta = 0.667 x [ (55.57 x 0.615) - (47.59 x 0.596) + (5.10 x 0.132) = 4.3

Subject: Community College Homebrewing Classes


In the past I have seen many questions on the HBD regarding homebrewing
classes. I just received a catalog from Arapahoe Community College (ACC) in
South Denver, they now offer two classes in homebrewing. I have no
affiliation with ACC. For those outside of Denver perhaps you could have
your local community college contact ACC for details. In a nutshell, the
first class is Beginning Home Brewing. This class is hands-on and you brew
three beers. Looks like a good overview. The class runs on Tuesdays from
7 - 9 PM for 6 weeks and begins on April 4. The cost is $57. The second class
is Advanced Brewing. In the description this one looks like all-grain, pure
yeast culturing, and brewing equipment type of course. It is also extensive
hands-on. The class runs on Wednesday from 6:30 - 10 PM for 7 weeks and
begins April 26. The cost is $61.


The phone number to register for either of these classes is (303) 797-5722.

Subject: Canning wort & botulism


Here's a definitive word on canning & botulism.  I took this from the
rec.food.preserving FAQ:


"Botulism poisoning is due to ingesting a toxin produced by the anerobic
bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_.  Botulism toxin is colorless,
odorless, and tasteless, but a highly potent neurotoxin.  ...Symptoms of
botulism toxin poisoning usually occur within 12-36 hrs after ingestion.
They include muscle weakness, slurred speech, blurred vision (all fine
muscle movements); followed by an inability to hold up the head.  Death
occurs by respiratory failure.  ...Survival depends on the amount of
toxin ingested, and how quickly the victim got treatment.  Recovery is
quite slow, taking months.


"Deadly problems can occur in situations where you attempt to preserve
food by creating an *anerobic* state; namely, when you create a vacuum
seal using heat and a 2-piece lid...


"Remember, that despite the bacterium's fearsome reputation, _C.
botulinum_ is still a microbe, and can be killed using a little basic
microbiology.  Preserving recipes utilize at least one of these 5 micro-
biological facts, good recipes often use several.


        1.  _C. botulinum_ bacterium dies at 212 F/ 100 C.
        2.  _C. botulinum_ spores die at 240 F/ 116 C.
        3.  Botulism toxin denatures at 185 F/ 85 C.
**(All temperatures must be maintained for least 15 minutes, and
the heat must be consistent throughout the food, fluid, and jar.)**
        4.  _C. botulinum_ spores cannot hatch in strong acid
solutions of pH 4.6 or below. (Some sources claim pH 4.7.)
        5.  _C. botulinum_ cannot grow, develop, or multiply
in food with a water content of less than 35%.


"Since the toxin is denatured at 185 F/85 C, if you are concerned
about a canned good the usual procedure is as described in the
above section (to hard boil the contents for 15 minutes)."


Sorry this post is a little long, but this is a serious subject.  The
mortality rate for botulism poisoning is quite high, and as the saying
goes, "In Heaven there is no beer..."  The second quoted paragraph
should answer Kirk Harralson's question; wort starts off an aerobic
medium, prohibiting the growth of C.  botulinum bacteria.  Yeast may
then consume the O2, but by then the yeast population, increased
acidity, and increased alcohol prevent growth of deadlies.


One more point:  even with pressure-canned low-acid foods, sources
recommend you boil the product 15 minutes before using it.  So if you
are going to have to re-boil your canned wort anyway, why not just make
it up fresh?


If you really want to can your wort and still have questions, you can
always call your local county extension office.

Subject: CORONA recipe found


A week or so ago I posted requesting help brewing a CORONA beer.  Many thanks
to all that responded with advice, particularly Chris Pragman, who gave me the
advice that made even my first meager attempt taste almost just like a CORONA!


Again, here is the recipe I used:


 - WYEAST #2308 Munich lager liquid yeast
 - 1 lb. 20 lovabond 6row caramel crystal malt(steeped 30 min. in boil)
 - 44 oz. Dutch Light Dry Malt
 - 1 3.3 lb. packet of light malt extract
 - 1 3.3 lb. packet of rice extract
 - 1 tsp. irish moss
 - 1 oz. 4.9 Alpha Tettenang Bittering hops pellets (2/3 at start of boil, 
        1/3 15 minutes from end)
 - 1 oz. 3.9 Alpha Saaz Finishing Hops pellets (5 minutes from end of boil)
 - 1 oz.fining gelatin (added in secondary fermentation stage)
 - 3/4 cup corn sugar (for priming)


This produced a beer that had the following problems:


1) had a slightly odd, almost sour taste ( but not enough to make it a bad
    beer).


CAMPING MAN suggested that the sour taste might be because I steeped the crystal
malt in greater than the intended 150-158 degree water, thus "leached all the 
nasty sour/bitter tannins out of the malt".  Some of my friends do this with
heavier beers with no ill side-effects, but I believe this was the problem in
my lighter beer.


2) was not as carbonated as I would have liked.  


Next time I'll try 1 cup of corn sugar.  Several people told me that almost
all adjuncts call for greater quantities of priming sugar.


3) and finally, and most importantly, it lacked general flavor/did not have 
   that unique characteristic and aroma of a CORONA.


This is where Chris Pargman told me that the charactistic/aroma I was missing
might something called "skunkiness", typically associated with CORONAs and
HEINEKINs.  Any beer can be "skunked" by leaving it in direct sunlight in a
clear container for ~1 hour.  THIS FLOORS ME (forgive me but as I mentioned in
my first post, I am a new home brewer and this sounded really far-fetched), but
this made even my beer taste and smell almost exactly like a CORONA!!!  So 
there you have it, a recipe for a CORONA beer - just make an adjunct beer with
very little taste, then skunk it!


Many thanks to all who responded!

Will. But given human nature, I doubt a simple request will do it. Anyways,
with all due respect to Rodney Morris (I'll take your word for it that he
is in fact the true inventor), the name RIMS has already stuck. And acronyms
aren't all that bad a thing. IMHO.


*********************
On the topic of RIMS (sorry Will), do people get stuck sparges very often
using these things? I like wheat beers, and even after a 45 min protein rest
my bucket with a zillion holes in the bottom lauter tun requires a very
slow runoff. Sucking wort out with a pump at 6 gal/min or faster sounds 
like a recipe for disaster. I take it that a vent tube would be a necessity
here?
        Looking forward to "March in Montreal",

It has come to my attention that a professional brewing position is open at
Pike Place Brewery, a small micro in Seattle.  Because it's not every day
that a brewing position becomes available, I thought I'd post the relevant
details in case anyone is interested.  Standard disclaimers apply.


Wanted: Experienced Brewer/Chemist


1+ years professional brewing experience (and lab experience a plus).  Hire
by March 24th, start April 3rd.  Send resume to Pike Place Brewery, 1432
Western Ave., Seattle, WA 98101, or fax resume to 206/622-6648.


Other than the fact that the head brewer has written for the magazine (and
that's how I happened to find out about this), I have no connection to the
Pike Place Brewery.  They did give me permission to make this post.  Please
contact them directly.

Subject: Quick note on Stainless


Hi Group,
Quick clarification on Stainless Magnicity?? 
The 400 series Stainless Steels (ie knifeblades) are ferro-magnetic.
The 300 series Stainless Steels (ie. brew pots, tubing) are not.
Marine hardware is usually 300 series because it is more corrosion resistant
than the stronger, harder 400 series.
Want more info? Didnt think so. (sigh)

True.  Thanks, also, for the references on yeast metabolism.  
The reason I use the method outlined above is that by waiting 
for the yeast to fall (AFTER high krausen), I have hopefully 
built up large glycogen reserves in the yeast population.  I 
then decant the spent wort, pitch a pint of fresh wort, aerate, and 
pitch at high krausen.  This has the benefit of maximizing 
yeast glycogen reserves, and pithing during the exponential 
growth phase, which reduces lag times AND produces a healthy 
and vigourous ferment.  This is the same technique I used in the 
bio-tech lab for yeast and E. Coli cultures in my previous life as a 
gene cloner.  It works.
