These methods require some degree of skill to achieve 
reproducible results, but just like yeast culturing, once 
you've done it a time or two you realize that it really is 
simple.  The trick is obtaining ultrapure (low UV) isooctane.  
The spec methods are less accurate and precise than the HPLC 
methods, but quite acceptable for most needs. 


>and is it reproducible with worts of different colr and densities?


I have started a little side project measuring BU in various 
beers, dark, light, big and little to explore this question.  My 
gut feeling is that color and density should not matter.  The 
assay method was validated for use in beer and no limitations
regarding the type of beer are specified in the documentation.

Your best bet is to plate it then grow it in some sterile media 
(yes, sterile not merely sanitized).  Wort is ok, but YM broth is 
better.  Add an equal volume of sterile 30% glycerol (normal 
drugstore variety that has been diluted then sterilized).  If this 
is frozen and kept as cold as possible you should be ok.  Avoid 
frost-free freezers, or bury it deep between the frozen waffles so 
the temperature fluctuations are minimized.   Some folks have good 
luck surrounding the vials with ice-in-a-bag products.


Sterility is also simple.  All you need is a pressure cooker.


You might be able to strike a deal with one of the friendly 
yeast ranchers that has access to LN2 or a -80 freezer to 
bank this "irreplaceable" stock for you.

   Are you at all handy?  I have found that the most common fault in a frost
free ref. is the defrost timer ( about $5 + $50 labor) it lives down in the
bottom by the compressor. Either on the back panel or somewhere under a panel
in the back you should find a schematic. Most people don't know that a
frost-free ref. actually turns off for an hour or so each day, this is done
with this timer.
   That said, find it, bypass it, listen for (good) sounds indicating
compressor and fan operation.  If the compressor is dead, forget the thing.
 If it needs freon, it can be recharged at a (high) cost until 1996 (thanx to
the ozone hole people).
    Basically, armed with a VOM (or a continuity checker), some jumper wires,
a few TOOLs (if you have a wife beware here), and the schematic (and the
ability to read it, no HB needed) you can probably fix it for $20.  Also you
might check the t-stat(s) and the circulation fans. You didn't define
"broken" so that's my he'p.  They rarely leak freon!


   In regard to wort pumps RIMS or otherwise my advice is get the TEEL not
the Little Giant, I got the L.G. only because I had a time limited
dispensation to spend (I do have a wife) and they would not have the TEEL for
2 days.

I am an extract brewer preparing for the jump to  all grain space.
I currently get the grains I use pre-crushed from Williams Brewing.
These grains appeared to me to be crushed very well, no shreaded
husks. I called them and asked what grain mill they use and was 
told they use a large version of the corona grain mill.
Any comments on this ?
Also on dry hopping. Whenever I try ths in the secondary I never
get the wonderful aroma ,I get a grassy or herbal flavor.
Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong ?

Subject: free water analysis


Thought I'd pass this along.


As I was browsing thru the water filter section of Sears
the other day I found that they have a free water 
analysis service.  They provide a few vials (2 for free
analysis and a third for extra, chargable tests for things
like lead content) and an envelope (postage paid)
to mail it off to a lab (in the Chicago area if I remember).
So I filled the two vials with my tap water and mailed it 
off. They said I should receive results in about 3 or 4 weeks.
I'm not sure what to expect, but the price was right. I'll
post results when I get them..... perhaps someone has
already done this?


Cheers
ChuckM


ps. I only sent in the 2 free vials and kept the third...
The vials look perfect for yeast samples.

Subject: Wort Chilling


In Digest #1673 I noticed two references to recirculating immersion chiller.
Because my cesspool is old and cranky, I had a real problem with the amount
of water used with a counterflow chiller. So I started playing with a
recirculating system. Here is the system I have been using successfully for
several months.
I started with the standard 3/8" dia. 25' coil of soft copper tubing, bend it
into a coil to fit in your brewing vessel and use tygon and hose clamps on
the two ends. The cooling source is a 5 gal plastic bucket with a spigot
(bottling bucket) filling with 6 - 1 qt ice cubes. (I use Tupperware).. Put
the ice in the bucket and fill half-way with water. For a pump I'm using an
old heating system circulating pump. Hook the spigot of the bucket to the
input of the pump, the pump discharge to one end of the coil and stick the
other end of the coil in the top of the bucket. Start the pump and 15 minutes
later, ice gone, wort chilled, all with less than 5 gal. of water.

Subject: Re: sugar vs. DME


When I made my very first batch of homebrew, with a friend of mine, we 
primed half of it with corn sugar and half of it with dried malt extract. 
The beer was made with only a can of syrup, with no additional 
ingredients, and was therefore relatively weak by itself. In this 
instance the difference between the sugar and DME primed beer was very 
noticable, with the sugar primed beer having a watery taste, and the DME 
primed beer having more body and flavor. For beer with more body there 
probably will be no real difference in what you use to prime, but based 
on my initial experiment (and my natural German tendency towards anal 
adherence to such things as the Reinheitsgebot) I have never gone back to 
corn sugar. I have primed with gyle on occasion and was very impressed 
with the results, but the priming took almost twice as long (in fact I 
thought that the beer would be forever flat).

        A recent newspaper announcement stated that the Spring Street
Brewing Company of New York City is offering 2.7 million shares of its
common stock directly to the public, minimum purchase 150 shares at $1.85
per share ($277.50 investment). 


        Founder Andrew Klein, former corporate lawyer, plans to raise up
to $5 million to expand the microbrewery's marketing efforts and finance
the development of new beers.  "We aim to become a leading producer of
specialty beers," he says.  


        The company introduced Belgian Wit beer in 1993, and has recently
introduced Belgian "Amber Wit" -- whatever that is.


        Future plans include developing an abbey style ale, a black lager,
and a peach wheat beer.  


        I don't have stock in this company, nor am I an agent or broker
representing it.  In fact, I had never heard of this company, until I saw
this newspaper announcement. 


        I can contact the company and read their prospectus and/or annual
report myself, but what I am asking is for knowledgeable HBD readers to
tell me about this company's *beer*.  How it tastes, its reputation, who
makes it, etc.  Without informed opinions regarding the product, I'd be
reluctant to invest.

Dave writes that he is reluctant to use sugars to prime
because of food allergies.


Most commercially available sugars are thoroughly refined.  
These include table sugar (sucrose) and "corn" sugar 
(dextrose or glucose).  Sucrose comes from sugar cane and 
other vegetables (eg sugar beets).  Corn is just one source 
for the highly refined form of glucose.  It is impossible 
for anyone to be allergic to pure glucose.  Glucose is the 
primary energy source for all aerobic animals, including 
humans.  Some of the glucose we buy from homebrew shops 
under the label of "corn" sugar may have come from other 
vegetable or fruit sources.  Check with your supplier about 
the purity and source for your priming sugar.


The use of flaked maize in a homebrew (or commercial brew 
for that matter) should raise concern about allergies.  I 
would definitely avoid serving a beer made with this to a 
person with a corn allergy.  


Last year someone described a friend who had a "hop" 
allergy.  I can't imagine omitting this ingredient in any of 
my beers.  Even Zima is made with hops.  A fine homemade 
mead or cider may be this poor soul's only hope.

I would appreciate any insights into the differences, if any, between
Dried Malt Extract and Syrup.  Seems to me that everything I have seen
says to use either - that they are "interchangeable" if you will.
However, most of the recipes i have seen use both - usually more syrup
than DME.  I am assuming that each brings a different character to
the wort, and I'd like to get a better handle on this.

A missing point in this discussion is :
What do you do with your canned wort? Do you open it up and drink it??
No, you pitch yeast into it and ferment it into "beer", at which time
there will no longer be ANY human pathogens alive. An infected starter wort
will make a bad beer but nobody is going to DIE. I taste my starters after
they're fermented and BEFORE brewing. 
I prefer to pressure can starter wort but have used regular canning methods
before I had a pressure cooker. Use what you've got ...

The city streets are divided by the Willamette river (East/West) 
and Burnside Ave (North/South).


The Bridgeport BrewPub is nice. They always have a couple of cask-

The Portland Brewing co has a real fancy place with lots of copper
in the NW industrial area. Their McTarnihans' Scottish Ale took first 
place one year at the GABF. The address is: 2730 NW 31st Street.


Widmer Brewing serves their beers at the Heathman's B.Molch Bakery on 
SW Salmon Street (Behind the Heathman Hotel and across Park Ave).


The Horse Brass is an English-style Pub with good pub grub and many

Subject: Maple Sap Beer


Timothy Laatsch asked: "'Tis the season in Michigan for collecting the sweet
runnings....from the Maple trees.  My questions are:  1. How should the
direct sap be
processed 
for use in brewing (I've never made maple syrup) and 2. How much should be
used?"


Last year I brewed some Pale Maple Ale from 5 or so gallons of maple sap
instead of water.  I got the syrup for free from a guy at work who makes
Maple Syrup as a hobby.  2 other HBers made brews using some (free) low
quality syrup that didn't meet Dan's quality specs.  As I remember it, the lat
e runnings of sap are less pure, containing more minerals and bacteria and
less sugar.  This makes for darker, more mapley-tasting syrup.(It's a strange
thing about the maple syrup industry that the higher grades taste less like
maple and more like sugar and water.)   This also means more boiling, more
chopping wood, and more filtering losses.


Anyways I'm pretty sure I adapted my ale from a CatsMeow extract recipe that
used a quart of syrup.  If anyone is interested, private email me for the
recipe.  Since it takes between 30 and 50 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of
syrup, I figure I was using the equiv of a pint of syrup.  This provided just
a hint of maple flavor and aroma.  If you didn't know it was there you might
miss it.  It tasted a little harsh at first, but it was a somewhat strong
brew that aged well.  I just had the last one last week and it had a nice
rich mouthfeel and a creamy head.


The sap should be stored cold and used ASAP so the resident bacteria don't
spoil it.  I don't know what would happen if you mashed with sap, but I have
a bad feeling about using something with sg around 1.010 as sparge liquor.


All this talk about maple makes me think it's time to make another batch.

Subject: IBU Calculation - summary


Greetings!


In the process of un-confusing myself about calculating IBU's,
I re-stated the formula, and summarized what I've read.  Here 'tis:


- --------------------------------cut here------------------------------------
CALCULATING INTERNATIONAL BITTERING UNITS (IBU'S)




        (%Utilization) x (%Alpha Acid) x (Weight of Hops in Ounces) x .75
 IBU =  -----------------------------------------------------------------
              (Volume of Wort in gallons) x (Gravity Adjustment) )




example:


   (30 percent util.) x (5.5 percent alpha) x (1 ounce) x .75
   ----------------------------------------------------------  = 24.75 IBU
                     (5 gallons) x (1.0)




Percent Utilization comes from one of the following tables (your choice):


Length of Boil    Hop Utilization (percent)     Hop Utilization (percent)
 (in minutes)     from Jackie Rager's table     from Mark Garetz's table


      < 5    - - - - - -    5.0   - - - - - - - - - -    0.0
    6 - 10   - - - - - -    6.0   - - - - - - - - - -    0.0
   11 - 15   - - - - - -    8.0   - - - - - - - - - -    1.0
   16 - 20   - - - - - -   10.1   - - - - - - - - - -    4.0
   21 - 25   - - - - - -   12.1   - - - - - - - - - -    6.0
   26 - 30   - - - - - -   15.3   - - - - - - - - - -   11.0
   31 - 35   - - - - - -   18.8   - - - - - - - - - -   13.0
   36 - 40   - - - - - -   22.8   - - - - - - - - - -   19.0
   41 - 45   - - - - - -   26.0   - - - - - - - - - -   23.0
   46 - 50   - - - - - -   28.1   - - - - - - - - - -   24.0
   51 - 60   - - - - - -   30.0   - - - - - - - - - -   25.0


Gravity Adjustment = 1 + ((gravity of boiling wort - 1.050) / 0.2)
For example, a gravity of 1.080 would give an Gravity Adjustment of 1.15
However, if the gravity is less than 1.050, then Gravity Adjustment = 1.0


Notes:


    1. The value for 41-45 minutes was 26.9 in Rager's table, but I reduced
       it to 26.0 to better fit the curve calculated by Alan Edwards, as
       described in the notes for his program "IBU".


    2. This formula was originally stated using the Mass of Hops in Grams,
       and the Volume of Wort in Liters.  Since one ounce = 28.4 grams, and
       1 gallon = 3.78 liters, I re-stated the formula in ounces and
       gallons, using the .75 factor.


    3. In a message dated 7 Jul 94, Algis R. Korzonas recommends:
         "As for calculating approximate IBUs, I use Rager's formulas,
         but add 10% if I use a hop bag (which is always) and 10% more
         if I'm using whole hops or plugs in place of pellets."


    4. There is some belief that boiling for longer than 60 minutes
       will actually decrease the hop bitterness.

Subject: The Carbonater Evaluation


Yo! Everyone...


Have I got a piece of equipment for you!


I think it would be safe to say that there is a little bit of gadgeteer in
most homebrewers.  That's the first thing that came to mind when I saw "THE
CARBONATER"  Oh Boy! I thought sarcastically, I really need another gadget!


That was until I started to use it in my mini brewery.  This is no gadget,
THIS... is a piece of equipment!


Since getting this little marvel of homebrewing genius, I have forced
carbonated everything from grape juice to chocolate milk... Did I mention
you can also force carbonate your homebrew?


This little piece of equipment will expand your whole liquid horizon even
if your not a homebrewer.  With "THE CARBONATER", your CO2 equipment
and a clean 2 liter plastic PETE bottle, you can force carbonate any liquid.


You can carbonate a bottle at room temperature or chill one down to
42F.  It still comes out the same...  Your favorite liquid refreshment with
that little bit of sparkling bite, most of us all want in our homebrew and
yet... none of the uncertainty of priming.  It solves the problem of "Did I
use too much sugar or what?"


Since my accident, I have switched everything... from my fermenter to my
method of storing... to plastic.  Normally, with Ales, I go from primary
fermenter to storage and seed the bottle with an once of sugar solution in
a 2 liter PETE bottle..  With "THE CARBONATER" it's just one more step
eliminated. Using "THE CARBONATER," I can go from fermenter to tummy
in less than an hour.


If you are a kegger, you can fill a few 2 liter bottles from your keg...
re-charge them with "THE CARBONATER"... and bring a couple of gallons to
a party or picnic without lugging all your CO2 equipment along.  It will be
as fresh at the party or picnic as it was when you poured from your keg!


I wish I had an 800 number for you to call, but all there is on the package
is the name "LIQUID BREAD, INC. 2450 Absher Road, Narcoossee, FL - 34771.
The phone # is (407) 957-4472. Their Fax is (407) 273-0137.


Using "THE CARBONATER" makes forced carbonation, in a 2 liter plastic PETE
bottle, as pleasant as slipping a cold one on a hot summer day.


It Works For Me!


The usual disclaimer...  I have no financial interest in the company, just
a satisfied user of their product.


If you have CO2 gear... Or know someone who does...  You'll want to try
"THE CARBONATER"

Apologies in advance for a not-quite-brewing related question...


WHat I'm looking for is some input from homebrew competition organizers out

you host a festival? If a judge were to get in a car and hit a telephone 
pole after 2 rounds of American Pale Ale and a BOS judging...I know this 
isn't going to happen, but if it did, the festival organizers would be 
the responsible party and could easily find themselves being sued for 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of hoppiness. We've been looking into it 
for a competition coming up soon and one day insurance coverage is around 
$500 bucks! We'd have to charge $20 an entry to cover that! I'm curious 
as to what other fest organizers have done in the past, if anything.

   I don't have any prolems in this regard, and I don't bother with a vent
tube at all.  BTW 6 gpm is awfully darn fast for 5 gallons brewlength, more
like 2 gpm or as fast as you can go without sticking.  I usually have to blow
into the return once to unstick the mash, after 145F or so everything loosens
up remarkably.  I have never experienced a stuck sparge in my RIMS, I reroute
the output to my boiler and run the pump at the minimum it usually takes
45-60 min. to sparge out 8-9 galllons.  I have also found that more like 1.5

Certainly, as long as you have the room to spare.

None really. Just bear in mind that the tank side pressure gauge will
read fairly low (around 600 lbs) because the liquid CO2 is cold.

10 - 12 psig will give 2 - 2.25 volumes which should be OK.

A few days.

No.


Another way to prime, and one that is commonly used in lager brewing, is to
add some kraeusen beer to the finished beer. This not only provides fermen-
tables but an actively fermenting culture.


Yet another way to prime is to keg the beer as the fermentation approaches
terminal gravity, seal the keg and place it in the refrigerator thus
carbonating with the naturally produced gas. This has lots of appeal to
the purists. Be sure to check the pressure from time to time and/or use
an automatic pressure relief device to keep the pressure around 10 psig.

Softness implies that the water is low in ions which means it behaves
pretty much like pure water so that the dissociation products of added
acids make a major change in the pH. I'm guessing that your half
teaspoonful of the blend amounted to about a gram of each acid. In
4 gallons of distilled water that would bring the pH to about 3. You
got 4 because while your water is reasonably low in calcium/magnesium
you must have some alkalinity. This resultts in some buffering (see below).


>For brewing pale beers could we use this acid to lower the pH of
>our *mash* as well vs using gypsum?


Yes, with caution concerning perceptible flavors from the citrate
and tartarate. They can be tasted in high enough concentrations. Some
use phosphoric and lactic acids for this purpose. These also can be
tasted in the final product if enough is used.

Bear in mind that the a pH in the range 5.2 - 5.6 AT THE MASH TEMPERATURE
is quite acceptable. This translates to 5.4 - 5.8 in samples cooled before
measuring. I gather that the comparative pH measurements were not made at
the same temperature?


>We didn't want to add more, thinking our grain
>bill was not providing the needed ions to lower the pH.


You were adding Calcium in the hopes that it would react with phytate
to produce acid. The mash, in distinction to the water, is a stiff buffer
system which will try to hold its pH at a particular value dependent on
many factors. What is probable is that you had enough calcium in your
water to convert all the phytate that was going to convert and the
additional, therefore, had no effect (assuming that you really got no
pH change).


I'm personally leary of gypsum because it adds sulphate as well as calcium
and sulphate renders hop bitterness harsh. This is fine in a Burton ale
but a disaster in a Pils.

Courtesy of a friend who wanted to watch me brew (got another one hooked! :-)
) I tried two dark beers this weekend and wonder if anyone has any

from the Oregon Brewing Company.  I really liked this beer and would be
interested in trying to duplicate it.  I recently made an ouatmeal stout
which was close to this one but mine has a bit of a bight to it which was lack
ing in the Shakespeare Stout.


The other was Iron Horse Aew from Lone Tree Brewery.  While it wasn't as full
bodied as the Stout, it was quite enjoyable.


I'm just starting to appreciate the impact of yeasts on various beer styles
and wonder what yeasts are used for these stouts and dark ales.  I've been

As long as the cool water has been deoxified (i.e. by boiling and then 
cooling) then this is not a bad idea. On the other hand, on my brew kettle I 
use an Easymasher (tm) which filters the hot break and spent hops and routes 
the wort directly into my wort chiller. Once the wort is below 80 degrees F 
or so, adding O2 (in the extra water) to the wort only helps the fermentation. 


It's been a long beer filled night and this may make no sense, I hope that 
this is not the case.

Subject: Acid in your mash


Kirk R Fleming recently posted questions about ph adjustments using acid or
gypsum to mash adjust mash water ph. He commented about the strong change in
ph reading from the use of "acid blend" versus the small change caused by
gypsum. This is an easy one. An acid will change the ph of any solution,
regardless of it's contents...however gypsum will only lower ph when it's
combined in solution with grain. Why ? The phytase enzyme which is a
component of malted barley reacts with  gypsum to acidify the mash by
creating phytic acid.  
Recently my water supply was changed and it caused me no end of problems. My
lovely, handcrafted, and coddled wort would not fully ferment.  Temperature?
Not a problem. Everything pointed to ph.
Solution: Lactic Acid ... Mash water adjusted to 7.0 ph -- Sparge water
adjusted to 6.0 ph.
Results: Complete fermentation, clear finished beer
Lactic acid is not cheap-24.00 per pint, but I only use ~50 drops per 10
gallon brew length.


I hope this helps,

When someone in K'zoo posted a request for information on beer in Oregon, I
was going to keep quiet, figuring that enough people would send private email.
But (no flame please) having seen Matthew Stickler's post, I thought I'd add a
few comments.


Bridgeport:  yeah, picky, picky, but I think it's a converted cordage factory
rather than a warehouse.  Yes, get the pizza.  Skip the Coho Pacific.  Drink
the Pintail, Stout, and "Traditional"


Portland Brewing: I haven't been to the new one, but don't forget the original
(NW Flanders sounds familiar, but look it up)  Smaller place, music on weekends
and, yes, that wonderful "Mac's."


Widmer/B.Moldoch: fun place, house beers vary considerably in quality and
"trueness" to style, but they also serve other micros.  Widmer's Kolsch and
Hefeweizen are probably your best bets for the house beers, at least among
those I've tried.


Pilsener Room: Gets real crowded at night, so I stayed away, but would like
to try during the day.  Looks like a yuppie place rather than a serious beer
place, but many have recommended it.  Some day....


Nor'wester brew pub.  Just over the bridge from SW.  Not bad.  Not much food,
so eat first.


Good pubs not to miss--both in Northeast: Laurelthirst Tavern (low 3000's on
NE Glisan) and Captain Coyote's (high 2000's of Sandy--just a couple blocks
from the Laurelthirst)


Beer to look for: Hair of the Dog!  High gravity beer from small micro,
brewed by a couple of Oregon Brew Crew types


You'll have plenty of these _and more_ just in Portland, but if you want to
wander slightly farther, try Mount Hood brewpub in Government Camp, then
continue on to the mountain....   Kalama, WA (Hey, K'zoo dude, I don't think
they have an animal park in Kalama :-) ) is home to Pyramid, and only about 30
minutes from Portland.


Seek and you will find!


Now go have a beer,
