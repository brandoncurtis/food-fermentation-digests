Subject: Flat beer summary


        Thanks to all the folks that took the time and effort to answer my
question about flat beer.  To refresh everyone's memory, my second batch of
beer had come out well except that about 20-25% of the bottles were flat,
and some of the others were super-foamy.  I received 16 responses.


        By far the most prevalent theory was that I needed to get and use a
bottling bucket.  By racking to the bottling bucket with breboiled priming
sugar solution inside, the sugar distrbutes well throughout the beer.  The
theory is that my priming sugar did not distribute well.


        Several votes were also received indicating that the capping might
have been a problem.  These folks indicated that they had seen this problem
before, and found that the cap seals were messed up on the flat ones.  See
below for a few more comments.


        One person also mentioned that I was using bleach for my sanitizer,
and perhaps I didn't get some of the bottles rinsed well enough.  The bleach
then killed the yeast in the bottle, so there was none to eat the priming
sugar and create the CO2.


        A few other comments from folks that I found interesting, and so
some others might as well: (Sorry I can't credit them...I wrote them down
and deleted the mail before I realized that I should have credited them)


"I use the same capper, (when I bottle) and in my quest to solve the flat


beer dilemma I took to sealing the cap, rotating the bottle 90 degrees and


re-sealing."


"Conventional wisdom calls for boiling the priming sugar and racking the
beer on top of the boiled priming solution.  The swirling action is supposed
to adequately distribute the sugar.  I questioned this and resorted to
gently stirring with a sanitized  spoon and *BINGO* my flat beer problem was
fixed, YMMV.  I now put a blanket of co2 over the beer in the bottling
bucket before stirring to avoid dreaded aeration."


"If you're afraid of the aeration that comes from the extra transfer, try
putting CO2 in the bucket first.  I just use a bb gun cartrige and a
dispenser that came from the local head shop for less noble pursuits. It's
an extra  $.50 per batch."




"I have had great luck sanitizing with the HEAT DRY cycle in my dishwasher.
A dishwasher wont CLEAN the inside of bottles, but the heat dry cycle will
kill (pasturise) anything that could harm your beer (or you). Dont use soap
in the dishwasher, just the last rinse and heat dry."


"I finally thought to look at the cap and saw that the seal had come loose
from the metal (probably during boiling) and therefore hadn't seated
properly.  I just soak caps in bleach now."


"In your effort to keep from disturbing the yeast on the bottom of your
carboy, you probably had most of your priming sugar solution fall straight
to the bottom and sit there (makes sense because the S.G. of the sugar
solution  would be greater than the finished beer, and it would sink!)."




"While bottling, re-stir the beer after every 6-8 bottles.  Otherwise, the
sugar increases the density and can stratify, causing the last few beers to
be less carbonated (or so the theory goes)."


Thanks,                                   Larry

Subject: Cheap hop scale


For the new brewer.


You can make a very inexpensive (free) hop-weighing scale, which
will be perfectly fine for the occasional brewer.  It is similar
to ones that were much used in the 60's to weigh a certain
botanical relative of the hop.  It is made from corrugated cardboard
and a small paper sack, and some paper clips and nails.

                         (nails pointing up)


Cut this piece out of corrugated cardboard with the corrugations
running vertically.  The actual distance from corner C to hole B
should be about 8 or 9 inches.


The curve running from Corner C to the nails should be an arc of
a circle centered at Hole A.


Make holes A and B.  A paper punch will do nicely.  With a small
saw, like a coping saw, cut off two 3/16 inch pieces from the end
of a cheap ballpoint pen and glue these pieces into the holes (as
little bushings) to reinforce them.  Put some glue on 4 12-penny
nails and push them into the corrugations of the cardboard, as
shown.


Tack a small nail into a wall.  You will hang hole A on the small
nail.  Punch a hole near the top of a lunch-size paper bag, after
first reinforcing the bag with tape, inside and out, where the hole
will be.  Hand the bag from hole B with light wire or a chain
of paper clips.


You will be marking a scale on the arc that runs from corner
C down to the nails.  This will be 0 near corner C and about
4 ounces down near the nails.  You may want to glue some white
paper along there before marking the scale.


You will need one mark on the wall to line up with the marks on
your scale.  This is shown by the arrow near corner C.  Friction
against the wall can be reduced by putting a couple of small
washers (of cardboard or anything) behind hole A.


You can use the following to calibrate:


1/4 ounce = 1 nickel and 1 dime (U.S. coins)
1/2 ounce = 2 nickels and 2 dimes
3/4 ounce = 1 nickel and 2 dimes and 4 pennies
1 ounce   = 2 nickels and 3 dimes and 4 pennies


To go higher, use multiples of the one-ounce equivalent, which
you will find to be quite accurate.  Be sure to have the sack in
place when you calibrate.

Subject: Looking for articles on Belgian beers


Brewers,


Late last year, in preparation for the Spirit of Belgium competition, several
articles were posted that amounted to an FAQ on brewing Belgian beers.  I've
just had a look in the Stanford archives but could not find these documents
there.  Are they available somewhere via anonymous FTP, and if so would some
kind soul direct me toward them?  I'm gearing up to brew a Wit and would like
to read up on the subject.


TIA,


Jay.

Boiling Chlorox - The Nightmare Continues (and Beer Bread)


Bruce DeBolt (keithfrank`at`dow.com) wrote re: dishwasher detergents. Just
for clarification sodium silicate (my CRC tells me this is sand) is used
as a flow assist/anti-caking agent. Its that debris that is left in all
your plastic cups and saucers that toppled over during the last
dishwasher run. I doubt that machine parts derive any benefit, unless
abrasive cleaning is beneficial.


Anyway since the topic is open, I soak my bottles 1/2 cup of Cascade
(not a plug...wink, wink, nod, nod) PLUS a 1/4 cup of CHLOROX per gallon
of hot (130-150F) water. A 15 minute soak followed by a jet rinse covers
everything. I contacted P&G about the advisability of adding bleach to
their product. Of course they said it wasn't required, however no
problem. Just add the bleach last (detergent + water + you know), and
work in a "well-ventilated" area ;-)


But it doesn't end there...as any micro major knows, wet bottles are a
potential source for bacterial residence, so I heat kill all my bottles
at 350F for 4 hours (generally I run this overnight...I knew that the
Time Bake feature had a purpose). One caveat...be sure to remove the
Grolsch type tops BEFORE heating. Seems they switched to plastic and I
missed it, Whew what a mess, and at 3 am too.


Arthur_S_Ward.henr801h%xerox.com`at`vmsmail:SMTP was asking about beer
bread. I have a killer recipe but hold misgivings about cooking with
beer... anyway here it is


1.25 cups of your favorite (hiccup)
2.25 cups of BREAD flour
0.75 cups of whole wheat flour
1 tsp salt (NaCl)
1.5 tbl butter
0.67 cups of molasses
0.33 cups of cornmeal

Subject: SUDS 4.0 release announcement


Dear Friends, here is the announcement for the long-awaited new release 
of SUDS by Michael Taylor.  I am posting it here simply to get the word 
out asap.  All you IBUmeisters out there, take particular note...
Cheers, Dave in Sydney


[begin included file]


Hi SUDS users! Just a note to announce release SUDSW 4.0 for Windows.


As always, this is a free upgrade to all registered users of SUDSW
provided you obtain the program yourself. The program is currently 
available on:


Compuserve in Wine/Beer forum (GO WINE) in General Homebrewing area
as SUDW40.EXE


America Online as SUDW40.EXE in Windows file area


The Power BBS (610)740-9196 in Distribution Headquarters library
as SUDW40.ARJ (ARJ decompression program needed to decompress)


Within the next few weeks, SUDSW 4.0 will be available on:


Internet: ftp from sierra.stanford.edu (or wherever they move
it to!!!), probably also from WWW.


Ziffnet as SUDW40.ZIP


                     SUDSW 4.0 changes


   o Added robust water temperature and usage calculations to the
     recipe formulator.
   o Fixed problems in page alignment when printing.
   o Added spin buttons to date fields for easier data entry.
   o Added user-editable hop utilization tables allowing customization
     of IBU calculation methods in SUDSW.
   o Removed label routine from program
   o Updated AHA style guidelines for 1995.


You will notice that hop ibu calculations default to Jackie Rager 
1990 Zymurgy figures.  The formulator will now show higher values
closer to release 3.0 of SUDS.  If you prefer the figures used in
SUDSW 3.1, run the GARETZ.BAT file to utilize Mark Garetz figures.
If you prefer the figures of Glenn Tinseth, run the TINSETH.BAT
file to install those ibu tables.  You can also refer to online
documentation on how to edit the IBU tables yourself.


If you cannot get the program from the above sources, I will gladly
send you a disk for a $7 handling charge with release 4.0 of SUDSW.
Send a request to:

In HBD 1667 AJ asked about my sig:
  
>"Hopfen und Malz gehoeren in den Halz" which I'd make "Hops and Malt belong
>in the neck". Is that right. Does it mean down the throat?
  
The accusative form "in den" connotes a motion into or down the throat. In the
throat would be "in dem Halz", using the dative form.
  
Sorry about the bandwidth, now a question for you extract brewers.
  
Has anyone tried the Brewferm kits for Belgen Beers? The assortment of flavors
such as Kriek, Trappist, Wit and Belgen Dark, sounds very interesting. I saw
these at a shop in Belgium last weekend. Price, ca. $12 for 10 liters of beer.
How's the quality?

Subject: Burton Water Salts / Beer styles-contests




I have been trying to perfect a english style old ale (all grain) this 
year and have made some very good tasting beers. But in comparrison to 
some classic commercial versions, my english ales lack the complexity of 
the finer commercial brews. I decided to bite the $$ bullet and have my 
well water analyzed. My water turns out to be moderately soft and low in 
mineral content. To get to the point, I want to add burton salts 
which lists CaSO4, MgSO4, and NaCl as the ingredients. My question is, 
can anyone tell me at what percentage of each of these salts are in 
burton salts? I've seen calculations for each one of these salts listed 
seperately (PPM/GRAM), but not burton salts as a whole.


I'd like to start this comment/question out by saying that homebrew 
contests and the results we receive from the judges are valuable to all 
homebrewers who are interested in improving their beer. Where beer styles 
are concerned, I have some mixed emotions about a delicious beer that 
does not quite fit into the style in which it was entered and suffers 
terribly in the final results because of it. To make matters worse, mixed 
signals are being sent out through the publications we homebrewers read. 
In the Winter 1994 Zymurgy, the recipe for the "silver" medal winner in 
last years AHA contest for Kolsch has the first judges comment as "Lacks 
Kolsch fruitiness". Then in the same issue, the descriptions for styles 
for AHA national competion for Kolsch says; No fruitiness, or esters. I 
have a Kolsch (maybe) that fits all the descriptions, except I do have 
some fruitiness. Can I possibly look forward to good scores or another 
"not true to style" entry on the results sheet?

Subject: Grolsch gaskets




  In HBD #1678, Brian Pickerill asks how many times one can use Grolsch 
  gaskets before replacing them.  I have between 50 and 60 Grolsch bottles 
  that I have used for over 4 years now without EVER replacing the gaskets.  
  I have never had an infection or carbonation problem with them to date.  I 
  typically use them to bottle stouts (my favorite style) and Christmas brews 
  (typically spiced stouts in my case - see a pattern here?!) though I did 
  bottle a Blueberry Melomel in them as well.  One of the Christmas brews 
  that I put in these bottles is from my recipe in the Cat's Meow called 
  "Christmas in Ireland".  A friend and I drank the last bottle of that this 
  past Christmas - it was over 3 years old and absolutely superb!  My 
  procedure is not to replace them until they are visibly deformed or 
  dry-rotted.  Incidentally, I sanitize these in the dishwasher without soap 
  and with the gaskets in place.  Just one man's experience.

Subject: Carbonater Info


Bob Christopher gives a reave review of the Carbonater cap.  I have to agree
completely that this is one of the handiest gadgets that I have.


He asks if you can fill from a keg and "re-charge" them - the answer Bob is yes
 - I do it all the time and no longer have to haul a keg and tank around.  Just
cut a piece of tubing a little longer than the bottle is tall and insert it in
your keg tap.  Hold the tubing firmly to avoid a brew shower and quietly fill
the bottle from the bottom.  Attach the cap and hit it with about 30 PSI of
CO2.  I also use this on the small 16 oz Coke / Pepsi bottles so I can give
away brews without the hassle of traditional bottling.


I did have trouble with one cap which the Liquid Bread people _IMMEDIATELY_
took care of by replacing the defective cap.  I have heard a rumor that they
are using a new manufacturing process to produce these caps much more cost
effectively and that the price should drop soon.

I know this is somehow embedded in the homebrew literature (at least the
older stuff), but it is definitely not true. Studies I've seen always show
that bitterness continues to increase, even out to 3 hours of boiling. You
do, however, get the most bang for your buck in the first 45 minutes of
boiling.

Even if the botulin organism is dead, if it *has grown* and produced
the toxin, the toxin will still be present.  The ONLY way to be sure
of not getting botulin poisoning is to can under conditions where it
will not grow (pressure can, or pH < 4.6), or to reboil the canned
goods after decanting them (and BEFORE tasting them).


I heard from one correspondant who said that his starter wort had a pH
about 4.6.  YMMV.

Two quick questions:


I've managed to justify installing a water filter to without 
mentioning the "brew" word.  You can either install one of these 
things under the sink or in the basement.  If the filter is installed 
in the basement where the water enters the house all the water sitting 
in the pipes (and the hot water tank) will not be clorinated.  Could 
this cause a problem?  


Also we will be in Toronto this weekend.  Any info re. good

Subject: 1098 and Carbonation


Well after scanning the archives I haven't found any wisdom so I will see
what the collective has to say. I brewed a 1064 OG ale using 1098. I
followed my normal pattern which is 1 week in the primary at 68F, 2 weeks in
the secondary at 68F, bottle/minikeg  with 3/4 cup corn sugar. Age 2 weeks,
chill and drink. Well I chilled 2 bottles and 1 minikeg. The bottles were
flat. Just a couple of CO2 bubbles. A real shocker! This is my 13th batch.
Follwed my normal routine for bottle. Soak ina 25 ppm Iodophor solution,
rinse in very hot water and a hot dry cycle in the dishwasher.


Any ideas? I did tap the keg. Sorta chickened out. I saw where plenty of
folks commented on rapid ferments (saw that) and poor flocculation (didn't
see that). In fact I thought mine flock'd nicely. Storage temp has been in
the 72F range. Worked for other batches. So any ideas? Should I tap the
minikeg and take my chances?


TIA,

Subject: Simple CP Bottle Filler Endorsement


Hey Friends,


I wanted to tell you that I made the simple CP bottle filler based on the HBD
re-post of a week or more ago made with a 3/8 raking cane and a #2 stopper. 
It works SO well it isnt even funny! Cripes! 
When I think of the three messy hours I spent spilling beer trying to fill from
the keg thru the tap compared to the 5 minutes to fill 3 bottles with no
foaming or spillage and no foaming over while trying to put caps on, Geez!
 EVERYONE should have one!
I used a standard liquid side pinlock fitting w/ 2ft of 3/16 ID hose attached
by brass hose barbs to a brass needle valve to a hosebarb to hosebarb adapter
(3/16 to 5/16 ID tubing). The 5/16 ID tubing was softened by hot water and
slipped over a piece of 3/8 plastic racking cane with a #2 stopper on it.
That's it! I spent 20 buck on parts because I was in a hurry and didn't want to
drive to another hardware store. Otherwise the biggest ticket items are the
pinlock fitting and the needle valve at about 6 bucks each. Total combined
tubing length is 3 feet.


To use it: 
1. Slide the stopper to the appropriate height and insert the tube and stopper
into the bottle. A super tight seal is not necessary or desired. But as the
original post said, keep your thumb over it so it doesn't shoot out.
2. Open the needle valve, there will be considerable foaming at first, but
after the pressure starts to build it will quickly stop.
3. As the bottle fills and the pressure equalizes it may be necessary to vent
the bottle, by wiggling the stopper a bit, a couple times to keep it filling,
especially as the beer gets into the neck. Fill it almost to the base of the
stopper. There will be less than a quarter inch of foam on top.
4. Close the valve, pause a few seconds, and then vent the bottle and draw out
the tube. I experienced no rush of foam at this point. Very stable and no mess.


5. Cap that puppie.


The only caveat, as Kinney noted in an earlier post, is that you either need to
flush the bottle with CO2 or consume it soon, otherwise the compressed air
during filling results in oxidation after a couple weeks. Of course if you are
just filling some bottles to take to a meeting or short time storage, this is
not a concern. 
Its the best device since the Egg McMuffin.

Subject:        BENEFITS OF GYLE FOR A PRIMER


I make 15 gal. batches and use gyle, some of the reason are:


My fermenter capacity is 16.5 gal. I make just under 16.5 gal.
of wort, take out just under 1.5 gal. of wort just before pitching
my yeast and store it in a sterile mason jar in my frig.
while my batch ferments out.
This brings the level of my batch back down to 15 gal. allowing
me over 15% expansion in my fermenter which is needed so I don't
blow thru my blow-off tube.
after my batch reaches a bottling gravity, I tranfering to my bottling
bucket (16.5 gal. cap.) I then add the unfermented gyle to my batch
in the bottling bucket bring the level back just under 16.5 gal. then bottle.
The biggest Benefit is that I can make more beer with my current fermenter
then I could if I used sugar. (just under 1.5 gal. more) VS. the 3 cups
of priming suger plus 3 cups of water. Whats that, something around 1.5
quart? Plus thats one less ingedient I have to buy and store in a cool place
ect... maybe you can taste the differents and maybe you can't.
I just tell everybody I can and they nod and say I think your right as
they enjoy the free hame-brew.
The formula for figuring gyle is:


Quarts of gyle (unfermenter wort) =     12 X gallons of wort
                                    ----------------------------
                                    (specific gravity -1) X 1000


PS. I find that using 25% more then the formula calls for does nicely.


good luck and enjoy.

It works and it makes fine beer, but I still contend that it may not
be the ideal pitching timing.  When you waited for the yeast to fall,
you did in fact get them to a pretty high glycogen level.  However,
by adding fresh wort, you are restarting their cycle and the first
thing that yeast do when they discover fresh food is to reproduce.
I believe that for the first two (check this) hours of respiration,
the yeast do not eat the new sugar that is in their environment, but
rather use their glycogen reserves up.  They then begin eating the
sugar in their environment.  When this environmental sugar begins to
be depleated, they start to replenish their glycogen stores.  By adding
the new wort and waiting for high kraeusen, you are pitching the yeast
at their lowest glycogen levels despite the fact that they were at
high levels *before* you added the second feeding to the starter.

Subject: Wit, the offering


Steven asks about the Spring St brewing co offering that appeared on 
Internet newsgroups and other places.  Here is what I posted to alt.beer
last week about this offering.  Disclaimer: make your own decisions, this
may turn out to be a great chance or........


I saw with interest the Internet offering of Wit!, the beer.  I
guess the first thing that got my attention was using the Internet to
solicit funds for a brewery.  Since Ive just invested in a small 
microbrewery/pub, Ive been actively researching the subject.  So,
I emailed and received an offering package.  


To summarize:


Wit! is run by a young (34) Harvard Law lawyer.  Shades of Jim Koch
already come to mind.


Wit! was developed by hiring the brewmaster from Raaf, Netherlands.
This part really suprised me, since Raaf in Amsterdam is a damn fine
wit bier, damn better than Wit! contract brewed in Minnesota.  I guess 
the brewmaster wanted a lot more money to give em a really good beer!


Wit!'s brewing is supervised by Dr. Owades , the same guy who was 
involved in the creation of light beer.  


This is already sounding like Sam Adams II, dressed in Belgian 
clothing.


As one reads further, it becomes more and more apparent that this
contract brewer is very interested in marketing, much more so over
beer.  In fact, he has already sold shares of the company to a marketing
firm to produce point of sale materials.  This is a trend that the 
company has followed for some time, trade shares of equity for services
rendered.  Not that this is bad, but I see a trend here, and dilution of
the corporate equity is inevitible.  The offering is targeting $5 million
of capital raised.  By far the bulk of this capital is to be spent on
marketing and associated sales force.  The company has already lost close
to a million dollars and is only present in a few major markets.


Wit! is brewed by the same folks who make Petes Wicked.


The stocks are essentially penny stocks that sell for under $2.  The
way you make moeny on this is through the *chance* that eventually this
company will be the next Sam Adams and have stocks that are worth a lot
more than the original few cents.  No dividends, no plans to be traded, 
etc...


I guess the thing that bothers me about this kind of company is that
they like to maintain the appearence of being a high quality microbrewery,
and even refer to themselves as a microbrewery, when in fact they are
a group of lawyers and marketing executives.  If thats what you want
running your company, by all means go ahead and invest.  For my money, Ill
stick to smaller operations that have beer as the essence of the operation
in all aspects, not merely a means to an end.  After all, the best micros
in america have grown from the bottom up, Sierra, Anchor, even Red Hook.
Marketing is important but the beer must come first.

DME is about 3-6% water and syrups are about 20-25% water.  Therefore
there are quite a few more "points" in DME than in syrup.  If you substitute
one for the other you need to add about 15% more syrup (or about 15% less DME).
With time (several months), syrup tends to get darker and take on oxidized
flavours.  I have not noticed any degredation with DME, so perhaps it is more
stable?

Perhaps it does activate them but at boiling temperatures maybe their oxygen
absorption ability fizzles out before they can be put to use... I don't
know.  What I *do* know, from my conversation with the lead engineer that
designed PureSeal (aka SmartCaps) bottlecaps is that they are no better
than regular bottlecaps if you boil them.  He said to sanitize them in
200ppm Chlorine Bleach solution.  I should call him back and ask about
iodophor because I now use bleach only for bottlecaps and cleaning the
gunk off the ceiling of the carboy and use iodophor or OneStep for all my
other sanitizing needs.

*** Warning, very regional post ***
Hello all,
The ways of life will have me relocating to Houston Tx.  I would
appreciate any info on home  brew stores or brew pubs in the Houston
area.  I'd also be interested in any info on places in the South
Houston to Galvaston area since I will hopefully be living in Clear
Lake.
Private Replies are ok, or post to the digest
Thanks in advance

The initial offering was in nov or dec 1994 and sold out in about a month,
alot of beer drinkers willing to jump in and own a part of a brewery, better
luck next time. I also missed the boat.
 -Spring street brewery of new york is actually a contract brewery that brews
its beer at a St. Paul minn. brewery.
 -As for the taste try a bottle, I found it at the first beer store that I
looked in, Its a belgian style beer. I'm not a belgian beer drinker so I will
leave the description out. It's good though.


Keep an eye on Sam Adams, Sierra Nevada, Anchor Steam, Full Sail, Widmer's
and Petes Wicked. All are privately owned but could go public in the
future.(ale street news feb/march 95)

Subject: Fermenters & U-brews


I would appreciate any information and especially experience which any one
has had with either of two fermenters I have recently heard about.
One is a 6 gal. glass carboy by Symbio (distributed by Wine & Beer Club,
Gatineau. Que.). It has a hole drilled near the base and has a tap installed.
The other is a Lexan polycarbonate resin 7.5 gal. fermenter sold under the
name "Mr. Beer".
Each of these items seems interesting but I wonder how they actually work
I would also like to hear from brewers who have used a u-brew. One has just
opened in my area. I do not want to spend the money or the time making a
large batch of beer without the benefit of other people's experience.
