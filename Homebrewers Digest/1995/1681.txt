Subject:  Cheap Pots and Ramblings


 I was in Dollar General yesterday and they have 34 Qt enamel on steel pots for
 $15.00.  This is a great deal for you folks that don't yet do full boils.  One
 side note... My "canning" brewing pot covers 2 burners, and still takes a
 good while to boil.  This pot is taller, and covers only 1.
 
 I received my king cooker yesterday... Rated at 200,000 BTU.  How long can
 I expect it to take to bring 10 gallons to a full boil????
 
 I converted a 1/2 barrel keg into a brew pot....  I have a compression fitting
 welded on the inside, and plan to hook some copper tubing with holes in it to
 loop once on the inside to act as a hop back.  I used a circular saw to
 cut the top off the keg, filed it down and its great (no handles, but I
 don't plan to lift it anyway).  For a lid, I found a large pizza pan, put a
 handle on it, two holes for the chiller to run into/out of, and can't wait
 to try this new set up. 
  
 Standard Disclaimers.

Subject: floating Phalse bottom


I thought I would pass along a suggestion for users of the Phil's Phalse
Bottom (tm) for all-grain brewing.


I have been using a Phil's Phalse bottom (tm) during sparging of my all grain
brews for quite some time, and have continually fought the problem of the
Phalse bottom floating up, which could (and has) resulted in a stuck run-off.


I recently solved the problem very simply an cheaply by buying a section
of 1/2" O.D. copper pipe, bending it in a circle, and laying it around
the outer edge of the Phalse Bottom. The pipe fills with water and weighs 
down the Phalse bottom so it will not float. It does not cover a lot
of the holes in the Phalse bottom, so it doesn't impede the sparging
process. I tried other solutions such as using racking hose as a gasket,
and using a section of copper pipe in between the fitting on the P.B. and
the drain hose, but nothing worked as well as using the copper pipe as a simple
weight around the outside of the P.B.


For what it's worth...

Subject: Extract degradation


In HBD #1680, Allan Rubinoff  <rubinoff`at`bbn.com> asks:


> Also, does anybody know *why* syrup degrades and DME doesn't?


The degradation in question is the Maillard reaction, also known as the
browning reaction. Sugars (mostly the carbonyl groups) react with proteins
(mostly the amino groups) to form colored, complex, heterocyclic compounds
whenever they are left in contact long enough (can of syrup) or at high
enough temperature (steak on a grill). 


Like all chemical reactions, it proceeds more easily if the reactants can
move around to find each other. That is why syrups will darken faster than
DME; but the latter will darken as well, given time or heat, albeit at a
much lower rate.

prefer the idea of 1.5" triclovers on top, but this is because I 
wouldnt clean through it, except for a recirc'ing spray ball CIP.


I guess my question is: why not use it right side up?  If you are
using a 4" top port, this can be put at the former sankey fitting.
Then you can use a smaller and cheaper bottom port. Cool idea, though.

Ive had beer off of Bob's pseudo beer engine and it was very good and
very similar to real cask ales.  The sparkler, in conjunction with 
extremely low CO2 levels is what makes a real ale.  Some traditionalists
would argue that gravity feed is the only true real ale, and in this
case, the sparkler is non existent.  The pump is a means to a end, not 
the required component of real ale.  Pumps are convienent, I love mine,
but they are quite costly.  Bob invented a practical cheap method of 
making a very similar product, if you can drill small enough holes in
the end.


Good brewing,

     As a fairly new homebrewer, I've been following this thread with keen 
     interest.  I've always tried to pitch at high krauesen - because that 
     is what I found to be the "std wisdom".  If I follow the above logic 
     correctly, it suggests the optimum time to pitch is after the yeast 
     has fallen.  It would also seem to suggest that it is not such a good 
     idea to add fresh wort to a starter (to activate the yeast) before 
     pitching.  If I've missed the boat on Jim's argument, please jump in 
     and correct me.
     
     Would the original gravity of the wort have any bearing on this 
     argument?  I've got a starter going for a trippel, and I'd like to try 
     this out...oh-I suppose the argument holds for building starters too?

Forgive my naivety, I only have 5 batches under my belt, but how can a
partial/extract brewer use the above formula to determine the % utilization 
of the syrup used?   Should I even try?  Do we assume that their 
(the manufacturers) extract efficiency is "x"% by default?   
Would any utilization percentage of the specialty grains come into play and 
how can I determine that?




***********
On with another question...


I recently brewed Tony Babinec's Sierra Nevada Pale Ale clone from the 
Cat's Meow (vers. 2).  Tony helped me convert the recipe to a partial 
extract formulation.  Here it is:


6.6# light unhopped malt extract
1/2# Cara-pils
1/2# caramel
1 oz. Perles (boil) 8.5 alpha
1/2 oz. Cascade 4.6(?) alpha (15 min. remaining)
1/2 oz. Cascade 4.6(?) alpha (5 min.) 
Specialties steeped 1 hour at 155-160 deg. F (68-71 deg. C)
1 hour boil
Wyeast 1056


The %AA of the Perles is higher than Tony's recipe.  His calls for 6.5%
The %AA of the Cascades were lower (his, 6.3%)


0.G. - 1.048
F. G - 1.010
Primary: 8 days
now in secondary (12 days and counting)


A taste of the primary at racking was rather bitter.  Is this the style of 
an American ale of this type?  How long might it be before some of this 
extra bitterness subsides?  I like a hoppy brew but not extremely bitter.  
Tony suggests that the bitterness might be due to the very late addition 
of the Cascades.  


Thanks Tony, for all your help!


Sorry for all the questions, just think of me as a young child wanting to 
learn more about something that fascinates him.

Subject: Septic and Bleach/ Canadian Mail Order?


On Mar 14, freigang`at`tcpcs2.dnet.etn.com asks about the impact of sanitizing
solutions on the bacterial activity of a septic tank.  
Two factors come into play when dumping materials into your septic tank. 
The first is the concentration of the bleach solution.  The second is the
volume of liquid.  The higher the concentration of the disinfectant or the
larger the volume of waste has an impact on the bacterial flora and the
agitation of materials in the tank.  You are probably safe with Chlorine
concentrations less than 100 ppm and volumes of less than 30 gallons.  You
could check with your local Health Dept. (or who else might inspect or
consult on septic systems).  Failures are most ofter related to higher
flows than the system was designed for, rather than kill off of the little
beasties.  Relax and have a home brew.
Now...........my question to the esteemed members!
Anyone know of a relieable, cheap etc. mailorder supply house in Canada
that has a catalogue etc.  Local shops (rural Nova Scotia) do not have
fresh, reliable or cheap supplies (other than syrup kits)


Thanks in advance.

Subject: San Diego update


I spent nine days in San Diego recently and I thought I would update
the list (and the pub database) on what I found beer-wise.


Hops! Bistro and Brewery:
    Visited four times since they were only a few blocks from my
    hotel.  Helpful to note that they are located on the west side of
    the UTC shopping center at SE corner of Gensee and La Jolla Village Dr.


    Food was outstanding three of the four times---just good on one
    visit.  Brew was average at best.  They had a Scottish Ale that was
    better than average and their Raspberry Ale was an outstanding
    fruit beer.  Well balanced with excellent raspberry nose and
    finish.  They claim to use 230 pounds of fresh, whole,
    locally-grown red raspberries per batch.


Kitayama Cafe - Sorrento Valley
    Turns out this is now called the Karl Strauss Brewery Gardens.
    Nice location in the San Diego Tech Center.  I went at night so I
    did not get to enjoy the gardens, but it looked wonderfully
    landscaped.  Exact same menu and brew as the Old Columbia Brewery
    downtown but in a better location.


    Brew varied from good to better than average.  Way too many lighter
    beers on the menu---the stout was good, but lacked any strong
    roasted flavor.  Food was average.


    Comments from Tom Baier <BAIER_T`at`SALT.PLU.EDU>: "The gardens are (5
    acres?) of japanese gardens with waterfalls, koi ponds, etc. with a
    brewery.  Best Pils and Lagers I have had outside of Germany, and a
    great place.  Closed to the public on Saturdays.  On Sundays, they
    sometimes have live music outside.  Enthusiastically recommended."


Old Columbia Brewery and Grill
    Helpful to note this place is downtown on Columbia.  The map I had
    did not show Columbia St going all the way downtown so I wasted a
    bit of time way too far north.


    As noted above, exact same menu and brew Brewery Gardens.  The
    specific items I had on the menu here (reuben sandwich and roasted
    pablano chiles) were both really good.  Beer here was the same as
    the Brewery Gardens: average to really good.


    Comments from Frank J. Leers <fjl`at`dpci.sannet.gov>: "Always has a
    good selection of excellent beer, good menu, somewhat pricey."


    Comments from Steve Dempsey <steved`at`ptdcs2.intel.com>: "Second only
    to Sudwerk in Davis for lagers."


St. James Bar
    Changed names and is now known as Triangles.  TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,
    beer wise.  Remove it from the list. :-)  They had Builleoors and a
    single random micro.  Food was expensive by my standards---$18+ per
    person.  Nice wine selection; $5+/glass.


Pizza Nova; I don't have address or phone, but they are on the SW
corner of Gensee and La Jolla Village Dr directly across the street
from Hops!
    I visited here twice, mostly because it was fast and they had good
    food and brew.  Three micros on tap (all very fresh) and excellent
    wood-fired pizza.  Good service during my visits.


Pacific Beach Brewhouse
    Lucked out and ended up there on $1 beer night.  All of their beer
    was very good to outstanding.  Their Belgian Strong was outstanding
    and I fell in love---much too deeply :-)---with their Red.  The Red
    had lots of character, a wonderful blend of crystal malts and
    Cascade hop flavor/nose.  Double yummy.  Thankfully I was not
    driving. :-)  Stout is pushed with nitrogen.

Subject: all malt priming




I primed my last several batches with DME instead of sugar. These have 
varied between belgian style ales to pils, w/ alcohol contents anywhere 
between 4 and 6% (right where they're supposed to be), and one was a whole 
grain deal. However in comparison to sugar primed bottles, it has been 
taking much longer to carbonate, is less carbonated, and the beer is 
slightly sweeter even after four months of conditioning. Someone is sleeping 
on the job!  BTW- The primary fermentations have all been very clean and 
complete.  The question is... I also use polyclar.  Could the polyclar be 
settling the yeast out of action? permanently?

Subject: Long Ferments


I have a ferment that's been going on for three weeks now.  The bubbles are 
about once every 10 - 15 seconds.  I'm using the same recipe I normally use 
with 1 lb less of grain.  About 5.07lbs of Klages, 2.5 lbs of British and 1 
lb of 60lb Crystal malt.  I'm using a london ale yeast.  Normally my 
ferments are completed in about 10 days.

Well Mike your are right about people being "confused" about what a beer
engine is. A true beer engine is indeed a hand pump, but its only function
is to move the beer from the keg to the tap and on into the glass. It must
do this with enough pressure to not only move the beer but with enough
velocity to create or generate the head via the sparkler on the end of the
faucet.


The pseudo beer engine "achives" the same thing. In this case it is the CO2
that replaces the pump. If the gas pressure is kept low enough there won't
be any noticable uptake in carbonation. The upside to this gadget is you are
left with about $300-400 more money. If you are looking for the cool look of
a real english beer engine, by all means open you pocket book and let'er rip.

From: flemingk`at`usa.net (Kirk R Fleming)
Subject: Bizarre RIMS Concepts


I've been toying with the following idea for indirectly heating and 
controlling RIMS mash temperatures...feedback is hereby solicited:


Design Goals:


1.  Provide a completely controlled heating system with enough reserve 
reserve capacity to both maintain mash temperature at a given setting, 
AND to perform the temperature step boosts as rapidly as possible.


2.  Isolate the mash from any heating elements to allow use of elements 
having high energy density and/or less-than-ideal element materials 
(non-stainless, coated, etc.).


Operational Concept:


Pump the wort through a heat exchanger--imagine a coil in a can of glycol.  
Heat the glycol directly with the electric element of your choice.  
Monitor both the mash temperature going into and leaving the heat 
exchanger, AND monitor the glycol temperature as well.  Write the control 
law for the system to guarantee glycol temp never gets boosted high enough 
to overshoot on mash temp, but so it CAN be taken above desired mash 
temperature minimize the time required to make mash temperature boosts.


IOW, "superheat" the glycol to the maximum degree possible without the 
outlet mash temp going over the target temp, and shut the heating unit 
down early enough so the remaining cool wort will take sufficient energy 
out of the glycol to lower its temperature to mash target temp.  


[NOTE: By "superheating" I don't mean heating the glycol above its normal 
 BP..I mean heating the glycol above the target *mash* temp.]  
 
This last idea could require the control system know how much wort was
left in the tun at what temperature in order to know when to shut down 
the heating element.  But...I *think* the control only needs to know the 
1st and 2nd time derivatives of the incoming wort temp.  (People who 
actually *know* something about controls, please help out)


But, even if this operational mode were not allowed and the glycol 
was never permitted to get above target mash temp, the heat xchnger
concept still has some potential advantages:


1) it prevents direct contact between the wort and the heating element, 
   guaranteeing no-scorch, no leaks at the element, and allowing use of
   high heat density low-cost elements to get steep gradients


2) may provide a more stable temperature (the thermal mass of the glycol) 
   requiring fewer control inputs (advantage: manual control of the heater 
   may be feasible as a backup mode of operation)


If "superheating" of the glycol (or other working fluid) IS workable, then 
the real advantage would be the use of two heaters in the glycol--a 
big primary heater for fast temperature boosts, and a 2ndary control heater 
for constant-temperature maintenance.  No need to manually add auxilliary
direct-fire heat or to endure long temperature boosts.  Also, given a good
exchanger design with lots of capacity, a greater volume of wort could be
elevated in a given time, it seems.


Disadvantages are pretty easy to find...anyone see any advantages at all?
Any big holes?  This is brainstorming now, so compliance with conservation
laws is not all that mandatory...and poorly thought-out challenges are as
welcome as any. :)

Subject: Hops: which method works?


Hello everybody,


This might be an easy question for the experienced brewers on this
list.  I'm only on my third batch, so I can plead ignorance.


Question:


If I want to get a stronger hop flavor (I'm using whole hops) would
boiling the bittering hops (Northern Brewer in this case) for a longer
period of time do it?  Or would using more hops but brewing for the
same time be the best way to do it?  Could it be a combination of
both?  I really like the Pale Ale I made recently and would like to
improve upon it by getting an even bigger hop bite in it.


Any advice you might have would be appreciated.  Please respond to
the list as other novices might benefit from this type of message.
Thank you all in advance....


Andrew
