Subject: Using mineral salts in extract beers


Dear Friends, there have been a few posts lately about using mineral 
salts (e.g. gypsum) in making extract beers.  It has always been my 
impression that the reason salts are added is for their effect on the 
*mashing* process, which makes using them in an extract beer a useless 
exercise.  I realize that under certain circumstances particular salt 
contents can affect hop utilization and flavor (e.g. sulphates in soft 
water for pils beers), and this might be useful if using extracts.  Other 
than that, I can't see why extract beers need mineral additions.  
Comments?


Well here I was all set to make some jokes about Jeff Renner getting his 
own name on his "From:" line, and he goes and makes them all before I can 
get to it.  Sheesh, some people. :-}!

     After lurking for a few months and reaping the
benefit of all the great knowledge out there(and my Muntons

there was a post from someone looking for an off-line

Subject: gypsum and extracts


a recent note mentioned a case where a fellow made Toadspit stout and ended
up with battery acid after adding oads of gypsum.  I wondered...


Wouldn't the source of an extract affect the amount of minerals in it? If
it was produced in England, say, might it be "harder" than one made where
the water was softer...after all it is most;ly water -- local water.  Or
are they neutralized before hand?


I personally find gypsum to "dry out" my beers too much -- even though I
have relatively soft water on tap.  I like 'em smooth....

Patrick Humphrey ask about the initial bitterness in his SN Pale Ale clone
and wonders if it's due to the late Cascade addition.  I made a Cal. Common
with 1 oz of Cascade (5.5%) added for the last 5 minutes and the first bottle
(after only 2 weeks in the bottle aging) was so bitter I actually poured the
second half of it down the drain!  (I can drink the FIRST half of ANYTHING!)
 After 4 weeks it was drinkable however, and after 6 weeks it is right fine
indeed!  
So Patrick, as a stranger in a strange land once said, "Waiting is."


Also Pat, "%Utilization" in the Hop formula refers to *hop* utilization
(largely a function of boil time with a correction for Original Gravity) not
*extract* utilization. BTW, what was the SRM or Lovibond (color) rating on
the Caramel malt?  Let me know how it turns out.
And no need to apologize for the questions, that's the point of the HBD.  But
long fancy German signoffs just waste bandwidth!
>>>>>>>>>>
Bryan B. asks for a good starter kit.  I would suggest getting whatever kit
your local homebrew store has available and adding to it as you gain
experience.  If they don't have a ready-made kit they still should be able to
put one together for you from stuff in the store.  The more you support your
local store the more they can support you in return.  Besides, most starter
kits will cost you about $70 - $85 no matter where you get it and you'll save
on freight by buying locally.  Just my opinion.

Jeff Renner writes:" So here's what I
do.  I keep carbonation a little high for style, then use a syringe (no
needle) and suck up ~10 cc of beer, then shoot it back with a quick push
of the plunger.  I keep the tip above the surface of the beer, thereby
introducing some air, too.  Some authorities believe that dissolved air
is responsible for some of the qualities of real ale.  This produces the
same swirling, milky mass of tiny bubbles as a beer engine.  They soon
settle into a creamy, long lasting head and a creamy mothfeel, due to
the low carbonation."


This reminds me of something Guinness marketed briefly around 1980.  With
your 6-pack you rec'd a small syringe (it's been awhile but I would say <2cc)
with a restricted end that you used to generate the head.  I don't remember
if you were supposed to inject air or beer.  It was better than what you got
from pouring from the bottle but not as good as the current Pub Draft cans.
 They also were difficult to keep clean.  Pack rat that I am, I should see if
I still have one floating around.  BTW another source for a syringe is
kitchen gadget stores.  They're sold as food injectors that you use for
injecting fruit juices (or other liquids ;^)) into meats before roasting for
added flavor.  They probably cost quite a bit more than the oral syringes
since they are a gourmet cooking item. (The old "It can't be any good unless
it costs a lot" syndrome).  I hadn't thought of it until I saw Jeff's post,
but I think I'll try it on some Stout when I get home.

Subject: Gypsum use in Extract Brewing




Hi All,


In HBD#1681, Dan Burke writes about gypsum use:


>I recently tried the "Toad Spit Stout" recipe from
>TNCJOHB, and I'm kinda curious if anyone else has
>had experience in using Gypsum as a water additive in

It *is* a lot. IMHO, this is just one of a number of examples of heinous
advice that appear in Papazian's books. According to the information I
have, 1 teaspoon of gypsum added to 5 gallons of water contributes ~60
ppm of calcium and ~140 ppm of sulfate. Multiply by 8, and it's a whopping
~480 ppm of calcium and ~1,120 ppm of sulfate that's being added. This is
clearly a radical water treatment, the fact that it is included in a recipe
without any prior knowledge of the water chemistry involved is what
qualifies this as particularly ugly advice.


>After tasting the gravity sample in about a week, he's
>right.  It is bitter-harsh-chemical-tasting nasty!


Very, very sulfury, I would imagine.


>This isn't bitter like an ESB, it's bitter like battery
>acid!  Hop rate was only about 15-18 HBU, not out of
>line for a dry stout IMHO.


I've never used HBUs, as I recall the conversion to IBUs is either 3.75 or
4 to 1, depending on what utilization number you use. So, I make 15-18 HBUs 
as ~56-67 IBUs using the lower conversion factor of 3.75. (I think - I'm
working from memory here, if someone else knows better, please correct me).
That's a little on the high side, Guinness is hopped at 50 IBUs. Also, the
high sulfate content will put a long, dry finish on the beer and tend to
accentuate hop bitterness. So, I think the extreme bitterness you are 
tasting is a result of slight overhopping in conjunction with very high
sulfate content.


All that said, I used to brew the Toad Spit Stout recipe frequently in
my extract brewing days. I think it's a decent extract/specialty grain recipe
for dry stout, if one omits the gypsum. Dan, you might want to try again.
Since you are starting with R.O. water, 1 teaspoon of gypsum would probably
be OK. Reduce your hop rate slightly, and steep (don't boil for 5 minutes -
another horrible piece of advice) the specialty grains, and you should get
good results.

Others, CAMRA included, might say that the contact with the air is another
essential component.  When using a beer engine, as you know, air is allowed 
to enter the cask and react to the beer.  This does change the flavor profile.
In fact, in my understanding, a cask conditioned ale is only authentic (in 
CAMRA's eyes) if dispensed with either a hand pump, gravity, or electric air
pump.  No CO2 systems are allowed.

Basically true.  However, I am looking into doing truly cask conditioned ales 
in 1--2 gallon wooden casks.  Due to insanity, I would like to allow the air
to difuse into the cask to keep it truly authentic.  Moreover, some day I would
love to have this setup on a bar and keep the cask below in a cooled environment
thus neccesitating the pump.  One can buy a Guiness tap which essentially does 
what Bob's pseudo engine does but is prettier and more expensive (around $90); 
however, for my "needs" a pump system is desired.


Many will argue that the air will only lead to deterioration of the beer.  
This could easily become a religious war which we should avoid.  Suffice it
to say that using air is the traditional method and I am looking to produce
ales in this method.


Also, If anyone knows where one could get pourous and non-pourous spiles and 
the other various cask parts needed to cask condition I would be truly grateful
to hear from them.

We recently brewed a 5 gal, 92 OG Scotch Ale (it was an error), and pitched
with an enormous amount of Wyeast #1728 on the evening of 7 Mar.  As of
today (17 Mar), fermentation is still going strong (quite strong).  We 
racked
ot Saturday, 11 Mar to clean up the fermenter.


We're getting about 4 BPM (bubbles per minute) with your standard 
inverted-cup
airlock (not the dual-chamber style).  This seems unusually active for a 
10-day
ferment, and we're wondering if it's due to: a) the high OG, b) the nearly 
1/2 L of
yeast solids we pitched with, or c) the #1728.  We've never used this much
starter, have never brewed to this high an OG, but have used 1728 before--
have never had such an active ferment out at 10 days.  Sound normal?

I noticed the opposite of this the other day.  I have a Maibock (all grain,
single decoction, recipe from Darryl Richman's book) in a corny keg
that has been lagering for about four weeks now.  After about three
weeks, I bottled some in a litre plastic bottle and carbonated it with
a carbonator cap.  (The keg has been sealed, so it was slightly
carbonated to begin with.)  


The beer was quite good, clean, but more bitter than malty.  That is,
it was a good beer but a lousy bock.  Anyway, I sampled some more
out of the keg yesterday, and it had a different, much harsher
bitterness.  This sample was colder and flatter than the first sample.
The beer had cleared a bit in the week between tastings.


Any comments on this?  I hadn't noticed a change in bitterness like
this before.  I'll try it again tonight; maybe the glass was dirty or
something like that.  I used the new Wyeast pilsner yeast.

I've had a water analysis done on 2 samples of water.  One sample was
from a counter-top filter and the other was store-bought distilled water.
The results came back but there was a slight problem in one of the
readings.


One of the measurements was "conductivity".  The guy that did the analysis
said that the government requires that cities either test for "conductivity"
or "Total Dissolved Solids".  I needs the reading in "Total Dissolved
Solids".  He said there was a formula or a way to convert the conuctivity
reading to TDS but he didn't know what it was.

There it is.


BTW, I've noticed a few talked about paying bucks to get this done.  If
you live in a city....IT'S FREE!!!!  That's right, it is free everyday
of the week.  Your actually paying for it in every months water bill and
and with your tax dollars.  The water dept guy said they'll do it
if it's requested, but they don't advertise it.


I can just see now, city water depts across the nation on Monday morning:
long lines of homebrewers holding 2 plastic milk jugs full of water!

Allan Rubinoff <rubinoff`at`BBN.COM> asks in HBD #1680


> does anybody know *why* syrup degrades and DME doesn't?


I'm sure someone does but here's something that may apply.
(see p 464 of Vol 2 of Malting and Brewing Science).
The degradation is presumably due to Maillard reactions. These
start with an  aldose (e.g. glucose) condensing with an amine to
form an aldosylamine. These in turn quickly undergo Amadori
rearrangement to ketosamines. Now here'e the key. The ketosamines
are "comparatively stable especially in the absence of water."
DME with low water content is therefore probably more stable
than syrup with a higher water content. Going further down
the path with ketosamines we wind up with furfurals which
are definietly perceived as "oxidized" or "stale".


DBURKE`at`smtpgate.tnrcc.texas.gov wondered (#1682) about 8 tsp
gypsum in Toad Spit Stout:


I had to go check the book because
I figured he must have misread it but no, 8 tsp is what it says.
Assuming 3 gram per tsp that's 24 grams in 19 litres or 1.26
grams/litre. The molecular weight of gypsum is 172 so that gives
7.34 millimoles/litre. The "molecular "weight of calcium is
40 for 40x7.34 = 293 milligrams/litre. The molecular weight of
sulphate is 96 for 96*7.34 = 704 mg/litre. The numbers for
Burton water are nominally 268 calcium and 638 sulphate so CP
is pretty close (assuming the 3 grams/tsp is right on my part).
Nevertheless, it sounds pretrty unappetizing!


" Patrick G. Babcock" <usfmchql`at`ibmmail.com> asks:
>What difference does it make whether they gobble
>their glycogens in a flask, or in your wort?


The current OPINION among the pros seems to be that the
yeast use their internal glycogen stores as a source of
ATP and carbon skeletons for sterol formation during the
cell buildup phase. Lots of glycogen thus means healthy cells.
