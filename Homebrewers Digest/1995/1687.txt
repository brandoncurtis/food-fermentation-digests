Subject: Stuck Mead Fermentation


I know, I know, the meadlovers digest is where I should be posting this, but
it won't come out for another day or two, and well, I'm impatient!  I brewed
my first mead about 3 weeks ago, and I think I've got a stuck fermentation.
It started off great, with lots of head, and the gravity falling from an 
OG of about 1.090 to 1.050 in 4 or 5 days.  I racked it to the secondary
after a week, and after another week, gravity fell to around 1.040.  After
another week, I checked it, and the mead has completely cleared.  You can 
read the paper through the carboy, it's so clear.  Well, I was naturally
encouraged by this, since everyone I talk to says that when the mead clears,
it's ready to bottle.  So last night I took a sample, and it's only down
to 1.035, and you can really taste that honey sweetness!  I used about
2 lbs of honey per gallon of water (3.5 gallon batch), and added a couple
of teaspoons of both yeast nutrient and acid blend.  My sources tell me
that this type of mead should start out around 1.100, and end up around
1.000 or less.  This, of course, tells me that there's still plenty of sugar
left.  So, what do I do?  Should I leave it, or should I try pitching new
yeast with some yeast hulls?  (I used Red Star Champagne yeast, so it ought
to hold up to the alcohol)  I just hope it's not going to be another 7 months
in the secondary, I'd like to brew something else!  Private email responses
would be fine, thanks in advance!

Subject: Yeast hulls


     I've heard about the usage of yeast hulls as a nutrient. And while at my
local homebrew shop, someone mentioned that a good use for that dried yeast
you'd bought as a backup (and since forgotten about) was to toss it into the
boil, killing the yeast and leaving the hulls. I tried this with some starter
and a couple of Trappist ale cultures, a Yeastlab and one from a bottle of
Chimay. Its been almost three days and the yeasts have remained highly
inactive. Was the introduction of dead, dried yeast a no-no? I used about 6 -
7 grams of  old Whitbread Ale in about 6 cups of starter, but about half of
that didn't make it into the starter bottles. Any ideas?

Subject: Re: Dry Hop siphoning difficulties


In HBD #1686, James Drago described difficulties siphoning a batch of IPA
containing pelletized hops.  He used the usual technique of wrapping a
filter (nylon) around the input end of his siphon hose and had the common
problem of the siphon clogging repeatedly.


I've had some success putting the filter at the *output* end of the siphon
when racking between vessels.  I keep a coarse filter (like a copper
scrubbie) at the input end just to keep big stuff away from the end of the
racking cane and use a piece of finer material (say a clean patch of old
BVDs) formed into a small bag held onto the output end of the racking hose.
The bag traps small bits that pass the coarse filter.


I still catch all the cruft but don't need to repeatedly restart the siphon
because the input filter is clogged.  I've found it to work really well
with fruit.  As always, the output end of the siphon must be below the
level of the racked liquid to eliminate chances for aeration.  YMMV.

* Unmalted wheat makes a difference in the flavor & color.  It's worth
  the trouble (IMHO).  Do a long protein rest (45 minutes).  A 40C
  mash-in is probably helpful, too.  Use pilsner malt for diastatic
  power and to keep the color as low as possible.


* Check your mash pH.  Due to the large quantity of unmalted wheat, it
  won't drop as far as with a more normal grain bill.  I had to acidify
  the mash & sparge water.


* Bitter orange peel is available from The Frozen Wort, PO Box 947,
  Greenfield, MA 01302, (413) 773-5920.  4 oz is enough for close to a
  dozen batches.


* The Wyeast "White" yeast is very temperature sensitive, and will not
  work well below about 70F (Pierre Celis says of his yeast, "she goes
  to sleep".)


* At the SOB, Celis said his beer has (for spices) bitter orange peel,
  coriander, and sweet orange peel.  Nothing else!  This is apparently
  the most definite he'd ever been on the topic.  He refused to
  elaborate on the souring, saying something like "that's the tricky
  part."  (I'm definitely paraphrasing here.)

You still only need one false bottom.  I mash in a separate vessal than
the lauter tun and I only use one bottom.  I also use this as a hop
back in the kettle, added before the first hopping.  A smaller mash
tun than kettle will work up to a point.  You cannot brew full volume
high gravity batches, but normal 5% beers could be done.  You need 
two ball valves anyway.  It is always better to over size and over 
engineer a brewery, IMO.


<The most expensive and troublesome aspect of building a three-keg system
<for me was: getting fittings for the keg and getting them welded to the
<keg, cutting open the keg, and getting good false bottoms.  Recommendation
<here is: hold out for a single 1/2 bbl keg for use as a mash/lauter unit.


Easy, get two 1/2 BBls.  Get a cheapo aluminum hot liquor vessal/stock
pot.  Use one 1/2 BBl for mash & lauter, the other for kettle.  Fittings
should be 3/8"-3/4" SS ferrule with NPT for the ball valves.  SS ball 
valves are good, but I use brass.  False bottoms are sold in many shops
now.  Be sure to get perf sheet SS.  If you dont mind transferring the
mash, it is more flexible to use separate mash and lauter tuns.

<a longer, more voluminous sparge.


You *never* want to cover the actual boil.  You need to vent off the
volatiles.  A chimny vent of some kind works fine.  As long as it
is a vented/open flue, it will work fine.  It is better to have a 
longer more vigorous boil over a smaller reduction in volume.  Lots
of important kettle reactions going on.  Be sure to get a big enough
fire source to keep the boil high enough to boil off at least 10% per
hour.

Subject: Wheat for Wits


Bob Ledden pointed this out already, but I thought I'd reiterate for
those who missed his aside.  Lots of people complain that unmalted wheat
is difficult to grind and mash, which causes headaches when trying to
brew an authentic wit beer.


Rather than use straight wheat, try using flaked wheat from your local
health-food store or wherever you buy bulk foods.  Using the flaked
wheat takes care of two things.  One, there is no need to grind it at
all.  Two, it's already partly gelatinized from the flaking process, so
the starch is more readily available for conversion.  You don't have to
do any other processing; just dump it into the mash.


My brewing partner has used large percentages of flaked hard red wheat
in several wit beers with excellent results.  (And I must say, he keeps
his wits about him :-).

I have used flaked wheat. This resembles oatmeal, and is available in
health/natural food stores. It may be added directly to the mash
without any further processing. It is sticky and lumpy like oatmeal,
and therefore could potentially cause sparging problems, but is much
less of a PITA than I imagine whole grain wheat would be.

OK, I'm sure everyone here is familiar with the fact that hops and cannabis
are very closely related.  And I'm also sure that it has occured to some of
you that it might be possible to substitute one for the other.  I'm also
curious about the possibility and would appreciate any help from people who
have tried it.  I have read that Micheal Jackson has tried a homebrew with
pot in it, so I know it's been done before.  My questions specifically are:
(1) how much to use in a 5 gallon batch; and (2) should it be used in the
boil, or as a dry-hop.  I've heard that the THC will not be extracted in the
boil, but that it is alcohol soluable, so that would indicated use in the
secondary.  What are your experiences.  It would be a fairly expensive
experiment, so I would prefer getting it right the first time. Thanks for any
and all help, and (obviously) private e'mail is fine.  I'll create a FAQ from
the responses and provide it to any who request it.

  I have a question on a related point. Several years ago when I first
started brewing, Czech Saaz typically ran 4% - 5.5% AA, closer to what the
US versions are now. For the last two years, every batch of Czech Saaz I've
bought has been ~3%, I even had some last year that was 2.6%. I'm curious
as to why the AA rating of this hop has dropped so drastically in the last
two years, mostly because brewing a nice, hoppy pilsner requires nearly
twice as much hops as it did a few years ago. Any hop gurus care to field
this one??

  I have no experience with the Wyeast Pilsen yeast, but I'm inclined to
think the beer is done. You had active fermentation in 36 hours, 14 days
in primary at 48F, diacetyl rest, then lagered for a total of 48 days, that
should do it. 1.013 looks like a reasonable FG for a pilsner to me. The
fact that it dropped only .001 in 6 days is a further sign that fermentation
is complete, the .001 is even within the range of measurement error. As to
the increased airlock activity when the fermenter is moved out of the fridge,
I'd say that CO2 is coming out of solution as the beer warms up. FWIW, I
think it's ready to bottle.

I keep hearing that cracking wheat is a real pain in a mill/grinder. I don't
see why crack it at all. Boil the stuff for 20 minutes, and the grain expands,
and gelatinizes, and is ready to be mashed. I thought that wheat had so
little enzymatic content, that de-naturing whatever proteins it does contain
is not going to make a significant difference. Is their a major flavour
inpact when boiling wheat? Tannin extraction? Maybe this is only acceptable
for certain styles? Please enlighten me O great "common wisdon out there".

***Great Success in Recreating Classic American Pilsner, a Shamefully
Neglected Style!***


Now that I have your attention, I hope you'll read this long article.  I
think it will be worth it.


 *Soapbox mounted*


Last fall I asked for help in recreating the taste of the beers I grew
up having tastes of in Cincinnati in the fifties.  Part of the flavor I
remembered was certainly just the pungency of beer to a child's
sensitive palate.  But part was certainly the greater hopping levels,
some DMS from the corn that was expected, especially by mid-western
palates, and just the greater flavor profile produced by brewing without
techniques designed to reduce flavors (N2 wort scrubbing, neutral
yeasts, minimal wort caramelization, etc.).  


Starting with the Brewing Techniques's article on Pre-prohibition Lagers
by George Fix (May/June,'94) and the one on Bushwick Pilsners by Ben
Jankowski (Jan./Feb.'94), I formulated a 1.048 OG, 1.016 FG. 80%
six-row, 20% flaked maize, 25 IBU target beer fermented with New Ulm
yeast from Yeast Culture Kit Co.  A good bit of the body/sweetness
profile was produced by the short, 15 minute rest at 60C with 45 minutes
at 70C, giving an apparent attenuation of 67%.  If these times were
reversed, it would probably result in an apparent attenuation of close
to 80%, giving a drier, snappier, less satiating beer.  This is not what
I wanted.


Because I was mostly brewing for historical curiosity, I brewed only
five gallons.  I now wish I'd brewed my usual 1/4 barrel, because it
succeeded beyond my wildest expectations!  Not only did I brew a
successful historical reproduction, THIS IS A GREAT STYLE BY ABSOLUTE,
WORLD-CLASS STANDARDS.  American mega-breweries have to answer not only
for the sin of what they are producing today, but for having killed off
a great beer style.  Steam beer is not our only indigenous beer style,
only our best known.


This isn't a continental pilsner, but it yields nothing to that style in
absolute terms.  Fix and Jankowski were too stinting in their praise of
this style.  I guess I thought of it as a pretty good job that American
brewers did making do with the materials available.  It is far more.
This extinct beer is a WORLD CLASS STYLE.  I'm not saying that my beer
is a world class beer, but it's pretty damn good.  It has a beautiful,
full golden color with a long lasting, thick creamy head, full flavor
with modest maltiness bolstered by the subtle corny sweetness, balanced
by a clean hops bitterness and yeast character, with a long, clean
bitter finish.    


We as homebrewers have helped revive other extinct styles (such as
porter), and I propose to this group that this should be next one.  This
isn't lawnmower beer.  This is the beer that our grandfathers paid a
nickel for and got a free lunch with.  This is the beer that German
immigrants created when they arrived in the US, and that swept out the
ales in the lager revolution by its demonstrably better quality.  This
is the beer of American steelworkers and shipbuilders.  This is the beer
that built America!  This is the bee....  Oops.  Sorry.  I got so
excited that I fell off my soapbox.


Now I know we are all fond of ales and despise American megaswill
lagers.  We lament that ales were forced out of America by lagers.  But
we are comparing today's commercial lagers with the ales we make or
microbrews.  That switch would have been a tragedy, but a classic
American Pilsner is a different beer entirely, and ales of 150 years ago
were probably pretty rough.


We've always heard that corn and rice are nothing more than malt
stretchers.  American six-row barley malt is too high in protein to make
stable beers, so corn was first used to dilute the protein.  Cost
cutting was a bonus that got out of hand.  But 20% corn is a delightful
flavor addition.  Unfortunately, I know of no commercial examples that
still exist with that corn and malt expression, especially with decent
hopping levels.   


The AHA guidelines are limiting on this.  They allow a premium American
lager to have a maximum of 23 IBU, and say nothing about corny DMS -
this generally is considered a defect.  (As a matter of fact, Fix
relates judges who liked his beer but found it "far out of category.")
But this flavor was expected, especially in mid-western beers.  At the
Ann Arbor Brewers' Guild meeting last week, this beer got rave reviews
from all, including a number of highly ranked judges.


************


So here is the recipe for five gallons of "YOUR FATHER'S MUSTACHE," a
Classic American Pilsner.


Water:
        9 gallons moderately (temp.) hard well water boiled to soften
and                 eliminate bicarbonate alkalinity, racked, treated
with 2 t.                 CaCl2(2H2O), target 60 ppm Ca.


Grain bill:
        7 lbs. American six row malt (80%)
        1.75 lbs. flaked maize       (20%)


Mash schedule:
        Doughed in 8.5 qts. 58C water to get -->        
        50C protein rest, 30 min., (pH 5.5), then infused w/ 3 qts.
boiling water to -->
        60C sac. rest for 15 minutes, then boosted w/ burner to -->
        70C sac. rest for 40 minutes, then boosted w/ burner to -->
        76C mashoff for 10 min.


Lautered in insulated Zapap, collected 7 gal. `at` 1.041 for 32.8 p/p/g.
        Note - Beautifully clear wort with minimum recirculation, easy
sparge.  This six-row is beautiful to work with.


Boil - 1 hr, beautiful hot break, like egg drop soup


        Hopped to 25 IBU target:
                25 g. Cluster hops pellets `at`7.5% - 1hr boil
                1/4 oz. Styrian Goldings `at`5.2% - 10 min. boil plus
settling                         steep - 15 min.
                1/4 oz. Styrian Goldings `at`5.2% - 15 min. settling
steep.


Counter current cooled to 64F, 4.75 gallons collected at 1.055, then
diluted to 5.5 gallons at 1.048 in 7 gallon carboy, force chilled in
snowbank to 50F.  Pitched New Ulm yeast from bottom of 3 liter starter.
Fermented `at` 50F - 52F 12 days, racked, lagered seven weeks `at` 33F,
kegged, conditioned with 10 psi `at` 38F, then dispensed at 42F-44F.  The
flavor showed best at mid 40sF and when drawn to give a good head and
reduced carbonation.  (Most beer shows best like this).


I hope I have encouraged some of you lager brewers to try this style.
It is naked brewing, as Dan McConnell commented.  There isn't any place
to hide, so watch your techniques.  Please let me know your results, and
lobby for this to be a recognized style.  I propose two divisions:
Pre-prohibition, OG 1.150 - 1.060, 25 - 40 IBU; post prohibition, OG
1.044-1.049. 20 - 20 IBU.  I suppose we could recognize rice rather than
corn, but rice really is a flavor/body diluent.  Fix says that modern
American lagers grew out of pre-prohibition "Western Lager," a lower
gravity, lower hopped, rice adjunct beer that was held in "low esteem"
by Easterners.


Thanks to Martin Manning, Ed Westemeier and Lowell Hart for their ideas
on what made the beer I remembered from the 50's, and George Fix and Ben
Jankowski for their Brewing Techniques articles.

From: Carl Etnier <m9258`at`abc.se>
Subject: aerating wort/minimizing yeast in bottles


Frank Longmore's apparatus for aerating his wort with welding oxygen 
reminded me of a discussion I read in December in back issues from 
last April. In that discussion, a number of people claimed that one 
cannot get water/wort more than 20% saturated with oxygen by bubbling 
air in it, because air is only 20% oxygen.


This was not rebutted by anyone at the time, that I saw, but it is 
not true. Time to get some correct information on that out there. It 
is in fact possible and easy to saturate water with O2 by bubbling in 
air. We do it all the time in our aquaria and our ecological sewage 
treatment plant. It stands to reason, also. Saturation for O2 in 
water at around room temperature is on the order of 10 ppm. The 
concentration of O2 in air is about 200,000 ppm. No wonder O2 moves 
from air into water until the water is saturated!


Speed is another question. It possible to very quickly saturate even 
low O2/high BOD (biological oxygen demand) water with O2, given 
vigorous aeration, as we do in our sewage treatment plant. But I have 
never experimented with the time it takes one aquarium pump with an 
oxygen stone to aerate a 5 gallon or (here) 25 liter batch of wort 
that begins with little or no dissolved O2.


One other clue to understanding this process. This one I don't have a 
good written reference for or my own measurements, but it comes from 
a colleague who has worked with aquaria and fish culture for some 20 
years. Unless you have very specialized equipment that produces very 
small bubbles, most of the aeration from bubbling comes from the 
movement of the water on the surface, not from diffusion from the 
bubbles. They are too large and in the water too short a time for 
much O2 to diffuse out. So bubble vigorously!


Actually, I do extract brews with about 10 l boiled water and 15 
liters cold tap water. I just splash a lot when I throw in the cold 
water and hope for the best. Fermentation almost always starts very 
quickly. But it would be nice to remove that "almost"--I may start 
aerating. If so, I'll come back with some measurements on time 
needed.
- -----------------------------
In December I asked if I could reduce the yeast layer on the bottom 
of my bottles by racking to a tertiary shortly before bottling. I 
wondered 1) whether it would it work and 2) whether it would work too 
well and not give me enough yeast left for carbonation in the 
bottles. I got responses that varied from "Yes, I do it and it works 
great" to "Don't bother; just put your carboy in a cold place several 
days before bottling and most of the suspended yeast will precipitate 
out."


I tried the tertiary (the carboy was already at about 10 C) and sent 
letters of thanks to my benefactors with a report that it had worked. 
Shortly after bottling, there was much less yeast on the bottom than 
usual that long after bottling, and the beginnings of normal 
carbonation. Since then I have been travelling and away from my 
Internet account and HBD. Now that I am back, I can report that the 
Rocky Raccoon's Crystal Honey Lager I tried this on has the normal 
amount of yeast on the bottom. In the long run, the tertiary didn't 
seem to make much difference. 


On the other hand, this yeast sediment has almost no flavor--the last 
cm I leave in the bottle tastes almost exactly the same as what I 
pour in the glass--but I wonder whether this is due to the yeast 
strain (forgot to record it, but probably Cooper's) and recipe, and 
not the tertiary. 


Could others who have experience with yeast and a tertiary report 1) 
how much you have reduced your yeast layer in bottles and 2) whether 
the yeast tastes any different/less than otherwise? If you email to 
me, I can summarize the results and post them (more quickly this 
time; I'm not going anywhere). TIA!

  disregard,   While attempting fishing during our last mini hurricane, I 
  discovered a small dump sight at one of the coastal lagoons, I found a keg
  bar that looks to hold 4-5 kegs, with two dispensing holes in the top, the
  top is all SS with a center drain, the refrigeration unit has been removed,
  and the side has a small dent, all in all this looks like the cats critter
  for a deluxe home kegging system.  Any one interested can E-mail me for
  location.
  John Montgomery, your lager sounds fine, the bubbles releasing during       
  movement of you fermenter is normal, and sounds like you have one delicious 
  batch of lager to deal with, need help?

Subject: Victoria Bitter


Tony McCauley has a friend named Pat who actually
likes Victoria Bitter. I wonder if Tony has ever
tried this stuff himself? I think Pat would find the
cost of importing a case prohibitive. He would also
have difficulty in finding a courier that accepts
alcohol shipments. His best bet is to ring around
freight consignment companies, or to have friends
returning from Australia willing to bring back a
case. Does he have any friends working for 
international airlines that travel to Australia?
I believe Qantas may even serve this beer on their
flights, but do not know how easy (or legal) it
would be to get any off them.


A brief history on Victoria Bitter (or VB as it tends
to be called here). The president of our homebrew club
saw a chemical analysis of Carlton United Breweries'
(CUB-brewers of VB in Melbourne, also in the top 10
by volume in the world's breweries) 3 major beers,
VB, Fosters and Crown lager (their so-called "premium"
beer). All were almost identical except for the IBU
rating. He became a bit suspicious, and as he was also
doing a university course in brewing he asked around
what the story was (many professional brewers also do
this course). It turns out that all 3 beers are the same!
They actually brew one beer to meet Crown's specs.
Any that do not meet these specs are bottled as Fosters
or VB. They *do* add extra liquid hop bittering extract
(I've forgotten what you call it - we can't buy it
as homebrewers here) at bottling time to provide
slight variation between labels. So my suggestion is
to buy a can of Fosters, some bittering extract from
your homebrew shop, and add a bit to the can. Instant
VB! I do not know the exact IBU ratings of each
(my friend Dave says VB is 28 IBU), but I would
guess Crown and Fosters are each 20-24 IBU.


Or Pat or Tony could try their hands at making some.
This is how CUB do it (scaled down to 5 US gallons
brew size, but makes about 9 gallons as the beer
is high gravity brewed)


malt: 2 x 1.7kg cans Australian Cooper's light extract
(or if you insist on mashing, try for OG 1.055 in 5
gallons, with US 2 row lager malt - this is similar
to Australian malt)
cane sugar: 3 pounds cane sugar (yes you read this right)
hops: Pride of Ringwood, 28 IBU bittering only (ie.
no flavour or aroma)
yeast: Wyeyeast Danish lager (I believe the CUB
yeast is derived from the Carlsburg strain)


OG=1.077 - 1.082 in 5 gallons
ferment at 18C (65F) until fermented out (fermentation
should be very quick, and gravity should be down to
around 1.018)
transfer to secondary and add finings.
Do not lager! It is OK to drop the temperature to around
2C (36F), but *only* to drop the yeast out of suspension.
On *no* account let it stay at such low temperatures for
longer than a few days. We're not making German lager here,
we're making VB!
Add about 4 gallons dechlorinated water and bottle.
%alc about 4.7 by volume.


Result: don't blame me if it tastes like swill! I believe 
this is a reasonably accurate rendition of common 
Australian commercial "lager" techniques gleaned over
the years through conversations with various professional
brewers. (I've added the fining bit for homebrewers as they
generally do not have access to filtering systems).


Do yourself a favour and stick to commonly published techniques
and ingredients, and forget VB.

Subject: Very Long Fermentation Period


I'm starting to get worried now.  My last batch of beer has been fermenting 
for nearly 4 weeks (normally it's done in about 8 days).  It's still 
bubbling in the airlock about 4 times a minute.  I normally bottle at 1-2 
times per minute.  Could there be something wrong with this batch that's 
causing it to ferment longer than normal.  I even used 1lb less of grain 
this time.  I'm using a London Ale yeast (which is what I normally use).  Or 
should I just open a homebrew and quit worrying (this is my 36th batch and 
the only one that's gone past 8 days).

Subject: Cooler spigot


Dan Sherman asks how to fit a spigot to a straight sided, insulated,
double-walled Rubbermaid cooler. Really simple and really easy, Dan.  Using a
1-3/8" hole saw on a hand drill, drill through the outer shell about an inch
or so off the bottom and keep drilling through the insulation until the bit
just pokes through a flat section of the inner wall.  But do not remove the
foam insulation and do not cut a hole through the wall yet!  Now replace the
1-3/8" hole saw with a 1-1/8" hole saw.  Using the drill hole from the first
drilling as a guide, drill through the insulation and through the inner wall.
Remove the plastic burrs and the remaining foam insulation in the hole.  Now
mount a plastic spigot with a 1" OD threaded end to the single inner wall
only.  I used a "Drum Tap" ($6.25) by Waddington and Duval, Ltd. (London).
 It has a 1-1/4" stop collar that slips by the outer wall and snugs up
against the inner wall.  It has a dial-type shutoff knob and will work if the
side of your cooler is 1" thick or less.  It's hard to adjust once it heats
up with hot runnings however, and if you use a hose clamp to secure a 1/2" ID
hose to the nozzle, the nozzle will deform!  You don't need the clamp anyway.
 I'm going to replace my Drum Tap with a "Quick Serve" ($4.95) lever-action
tap made by the same company for the next batch.  It looks like it may not
*stick* as much. Hope this helps - it worked for me and the cooler only cost
$1 at my recycling center :-)
