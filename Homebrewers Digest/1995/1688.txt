HBDers


I'm a year into homebrewing and I have an embarassingly simple problem.
Stuck fermentation.  I have been at 1020 for the last week and a half, and
am nearing the end of my rope.


Details:  Pale ale, OG around 1050.  Pitched a second generation Chico Ale
(worked the first time) and had a good two day's worth of fermentation.
Oh, wort was 6 or so lbs dry malt extract, 1 lb crystal malt.  After two
weeks, I repitched with rehydrated dry ale yeast and shook pretty vigously
in a lame attempt to reaerate (although I know adding air at this point
isn't a great idea).  After minimal bubbling for a week, there has been no
real change.  The beer has been at about 70F the whole time.


Theories:


1)   Both yeasts were bad.  Unlikely.
2)   Lots of unfermentables in wort, so 1020 is right FG.  Can't believe
that.  I used M&F light.
3)   Not enough air in wort.  This seems reasonably likely, since I get
impatient with shaking carboys.  But it hasn't happened before.  I know
liquid yeasts need a lot of oxygen (and second generations even more so) so
this is my suspicion.


But enough theories.  What should I do?  Thinking that I had cured the
problem, I dry hopped the beer after introducing the dry yeast.  And I don't
mind the taste of it (flat and warm).  So should I just keg?  Or rerack, add
yeast nutrients, more yeast and wait some more?  (And if I do option 2,
should I try to aerate through sloppy racking and a little carboy shaking?


E-mailed opinions will be great.  I will do whatever gets the most votes,
and report the results if I get more than 10 opinions.


Thanks.

P.S. -- Has anyone tried Blue Ridge Lager by micro Rainbow Ridge Brewing Co.
 Slick blue bottles, no adjuncts, employee ownership and a '93 GABF gold.  I
have never tasted a better Bud/Coors/Miller clone, and certainly not as
expensive.  Maybe it's too subtle for my hops-driven palate, but I won't
spend another $6 on that again.

Subject: ON the air, WHEAT


 
 Our move to the country is now complete and the first trial run of the new 
 brewery is in the "lagering room".  The MM factory is back on line in its new 
 3000 sq ft home.
 
 The brewery is in its own 500 sq ft mini barn and it really is fun to have 
 everything in its place instead of having to set things up each time I brew.  
 The EASYSPARGER is now history because of water complications and I have the 
 sparge water heater in the loft and it is gravity fed to the mash tun right 
 below.  The mash tun is gravity fed to the boiler and the chilled wort from 
 the boiler is pumped to the fermenter in the fridge.
 
 I had a few unplanned problems with either too much or not enough hot water 
 on the first run but I think I have it figured out for the next.  The good 
 news is that the well water seems to make fine beer.  I still have not been 
 able to locate my pH meter but the mash proceeded as normal with the usual 
 extract yield of 33 pts and the beer tastes normal.  The water is very hard 
 and has a strong sulphur smell but it dissipates within an hour if just left 
 out and immediately upon boiling.
 
 I got 60 lbs of wheat for $5 from a farmer down the road and 25 lbs of corn 
 from another for a beer so it's tough to stick to the Reinhightsgbot 
 tradition with that kind of stuff around.  The last batch had two lbs of corn 
 and I am going to try wheat in the next, which brings me to.....
 
 >From: kr_roberson`at`ccmail.pnl.gov
 
 >I have a MaltMill (tm, etc, etc) that I use for grinding, and I wanted
 to relate my experience with raw wheat so far. I've made two white
 beers with 50% raw wheat, the first with hard red and the second
 with soft white. Boys and girls when they say hard as in "hard red"
 they are not kidding. I was grinding with a drill motor and the ol
 MM would seize up if ANY backed up in the rollers. No loading up the
 hopper on this stuff. I had to unload the hopper several times before
 I was done. Major pain. Pouring it in slowly in a very thin stream
 did the trick......
 
 I have done a bit of experimenting on wheat and pretty much agree with your 
 comments.  The MM was designed to crush malt and what ever you can do with 
 raw grain should be considered a bonus.  Even the MMII with a 1 hp motor can 
 only take wheat at about 10% of the rate for malt.  Here is one place where 
 an adjustable mill can speed things up as you can run the wheat through wide 
 open much faster and a second pass at the nominal setting full tilt.  I 
 milled 15 lbs that way and then ran it through the Corona to make flour and 
 it worked very well.  Just for reference, the Corona is no picknic either on 
 wheat and it has to be run through several times to get good flour (for 
 bread).
 
 Question?  Does raw wheat need to be pre-boiled like corn to gelatinize it?
 
 If not, why not?

Subject: Growing Hops and determining AA


I'm thinking of growing my own hops but was wondering how I would determine
alpha acid content.  I saw the recent posts regarding spectrophotometric
analysis, but like my liquid nitrogen tank and autoclave, my UV-Vis spec is
out for repairs.<G>  Many of you guys out there are associated with
universities and commercial labs and have easy access to analytical
capabilities.  How 'bout us *really* homebrewers who have to make due with
classic kitchen chemistry.  How can we determine AA?  Is there a lab
somewhere where I could send dried hop flowers and have AA determined?  How
stable will the content be if stored properly (in freezer?).  Has anyone out
there in Central NJ (Monmouth, Ocean cty) tried growing their own hops?  Does
our soil, ran, etc support hop growing?

Subject: Re: Internet Brewing Resources...






In HBD 1687, Patrick Babcock (usfmchql`at`ibmmail.com) asked for
a compilation of network resources dealing with brewing.


There are some of these compilations available through the world
wide web. The most exhaustive is probably the World Wide Web
Virtual Library: Beer and Brewing page, maintained by John Locke.
John's done an excellent job of exhaustively searching out 
brewing resources on the net and creating a usable index of
them. The URL is:
   http://www.mindspring.com/~jlock/wwwbeer.html


Spencer Thomas also has a quite exhaustive list on his beer page.
The URL is:
   http://guraldi.itn.med.umich.edu/Beer/


On the Brewery site (of which I am one of several maintainers), there
is a list of Online resources that we feel are very close to the
subject of homebrewing. We're not as exhaustive as John or Spencer
because we limit our links to only those resources that deal with
homebrewing as opposed to beer appreciation in general, and we
limit it to sites offering useful information that doesn't duplicate
what we, or Spencer, or other sites already provide. Our URL is:
   http://alpha.rollanet.org/Online.html


Hope this helps.

I'm having trouble attaining the appropriate final gravities since I switched
to using Cornelious kegs as fermenters. For example, my pale ales (1.045-1.055
O.G.) finish in the 1.020-1.022 range. My latest brew was a stout (1.078 O.G.)
that finished at 1.034! Yeast used in my pale ales were Wyeast 1968 Special
London and Wyeast 1056 American Ale. The stout was fermented with Wyeast 1084
Irish Ale. Yes, I made starters, pitching one to two quarts. These are
all-grain brews; aeration with a venturi tube during racking from the boiling
kettle to soda keg. I've read here in the past that the geometry of these kegs
aren't really optimum. Do I need to do something more elaborate with aeration?
I really like the convenience of using these 5 gallon kegs as fermenters. Can
anyone out there help me with my poor attenuation problem?

**********  from Bruce DeBolt ***************


1.  Dry Hopping


There have been a few more notes about siphoning problems 
from a dry hopped secondary using pellets.  I've encountered 
no problems by using a nylon grain bag (from any homebrew 
store), tied off at the end of the racking cane with a 
plastic twist tie.  The whole thing is sanitized in iodophor 
solution and shaken before plunging in the secondary.  This 
gives you lots of surface area and "folds".  While it flows 
a little slower than the cane alone, it hasn't come close to 
clogging yet.   May work better than the nylon hose 
technique which I haven't tried yet. 


I just made my first "grassy" flavored beer from dry 
hopping.  It was a Redhook ESB clone posted by Michael Lloyd 
on Jan. 11, which called for 1 oz. of Tettnanger dry hopped 
in the secondary.  I've used Tettnanger in a brown ale 
before without this problem, also Cascade and Liberty in 
other styles with no problems.   It's been in the bottle for 
one month, and the grassiness seems to be fading slightly.   
The hops were pellets, a '93 U.S. crop which had been in my 
freezer in a polypropylene screw top container (St. Pat's) 
for about 6-7 months.


I checked Miller, Papazian, De Clerk, and Garetz for 
insight.  The Garetz book was the only one with any information on this 
problem.  He states that grassiness will fade with 
time.  I know from experience this is true with bitterness and aroma.  
Someone on the digest, I think Al Korzonas, stated recently  
that certain hops are known for giving a grassy flavor.  
Forgive my inability to search past digests as I only have access 
through Keith Frank's good graces and don't want to burden 
him too much.   My questions:


1.  Is "grassiness" due to hop variety, age, amount, or a combination of 
factors?
2.  Will this tend to fade with time?
3.  Any direct experiences with U.S. Tettnanger?
4.  Garetz states, on page 192, that if you dry hop you should also use 
finishing hops (late boil addition) and while it is OK to use finishing hops 
without dry hopping, it generally is not OK the other way around.  Any 
comments on this?  I've not noticed any problems dry hopping without 
finishing hops.


2.  Phenolic Flavor Lovers


Dave Draper's post not too long ago about making American 
Wheat Beers (he doesn't like phenolics) and Jim Busch's 
reply (yuk!) made me wonder where these preferences come 
from.  I'm in Dave's camp, can't stand the phenolics.  


When I was in elementary school back in the sixties we used 
to get a certain brand of paste in plastic tubs with a stiff 
brush in the middle of it.  Some kids used to eat the paste, 
others didn't. The classes were clearly divided along these 
lines.  I've been told it had phenol in it, it certainly 
smelled like it if memory serves me correctly.  I was one of 
the non-eaters.  So - are the phenolic flavor lovers former 
paste eaters?


3.  M&F Malt - The quality of this malt has been mentioned 
many times but I can't find it for sale locally or in 
Zymurgy or Brewing Techniques, maybe I've missed something 
in an ad.  Where can I buy the grain?


TIA,
Bruce DeBolt

Subject: Flaked Wheat/ Racking from kettle


I've seen a  number of people suggest substituting flaked wheat for unmalted
wheat.  Is this a pound for pound substitution?


Someone was asking about expereinces racking from the kettle.  I have been
doing it with a copper scrubby over the racking cane.  I use a short length of
tubing leading to the funnel with strainer on top of the carboy.  This catches
some additional junk as well as provides some aeration as the wort drops
throught the screen.

1.  I haven't seen a post on this yet, but for all Georgians, the 
brewpub law PASSED.  After the governor signs the law (Zell should), 
brewpubs will be legal come July 1.  Thank goodness we'll have them 
in time for the Olympics.  


2.  For Stephen Tinsley: I'm not sure what's wrong with your mead, 
but don't bet on it being finished in just a month (like Papazian 
says).  I've only made one batch (SG 1.087), but it took over 4 
months to complete fermentation.  That seems to be in line with the 
experience of others I've talked to about it.


3.  For Hunter:  There were several post on the Artic misspelling 
several months back.  The reason for it is so that they can't be sued 
in some states for misadvertising (The beer is not brewed in the 
Arctic nor is there a style of beer called Arctic.).  It may be 
cynical to say so, but in the future, we will probably just start 
spelling it that way (Note how many people spell light "lite" after 
Miller came out with their beer.).

As far as I know, this is not true.  Do you have real evidence to back
up this statement?  The color of an orange depends on the temperature
at which it matures.  The colder it is (within limits :-), the oranger
the orange, the thicker its skin, and the more sour it tastes.
(Obviously, variation between varieties affects these factors, too.)
Oranges grown in very hot climates never turn orange.  Oranges grown
in colder places (e.g., California) do.

          To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the excise 
          tax treatment of hard apple cider.
            Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
          United States of America in Congress assembled,
          SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF TAX TREATMENT OF HARD APPLE CIDER.
            (a) Hard Apple Cider Containing Not More Than 7 Percent Alcohol
          Taxed as Beer: Subsection (a) of section 5052 of the Internal
          Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to definitions) is amended to read 
          as follows:
            `(a) Beer: For purposes of this chapter (except when used with
          reference to distilling or distilling material)--
                `(1) In general: The term `beer' means beer, ale, porter,
              stout, and other similar fermented beverages (including sake or
              similar products) of any name or description containing 
              one-half of 1 percent or more of alcohol by volume brewed or
              produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute
              therefor.
                `(2) Hard apple cider: The term `beer' includes a beverage--
                    `(A) derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added
                  alcohol) from apples containing at least one-half of 1
                  percent and not more than 7 percent of alcohol by volume, and
                    `(B) produced by a person who produces more than 100,000
                  wine gallons of such beverage during the calendar year.'.
            (b) Conforming Amendment: Subsection (a) of section 5041 of the
          Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to imposition and rate of
          tax) is amended by striking `wine)' and inserting `wine, but not
          including hard apple cider described in section 5052(a)(2))'.

Subject: Pressure brewing


I had a brewing science fiction idea while in bottle washing Zen last night:


This idea came from two sources:  First, the "brew in a bag" concept where
the wort (mixture, whatever) ferments in a sealed bag and thus carbonates
itself in primary.  Second, Charlie's entry in his Companion book about the
brewer in Arizona who submerged his fermenter in his pool to keep it cool.


Wouldn't the submerged beer be partially carbonated at ground (sea) level?
 What if we fermented beer at a depth of ninety feet (which is a pressure
level of 3 atmospheres)?  As long as there was an air (water?) lock to
equalize pressure within the fermenter, wouldn't the result be fermented,
carbonated beer?


Anybody know how many psi one atmosphere is?  What psi is carbonated beer?

Subject: Re:  The Fermentap Review




I too bought a Fermentap and am overall satisfied with it.  However, 
I do offer a few criticisms...


In HBD 1680, Bob Christopher <oldfogy`at`svpal.org> wrote:

|>
Correct.  But you do NOT need 2 Fermentaps to do this.


Try this method.  During active fermentation (in the primary w/ the
Fermentap), sanitize your secondary carboy.  Then take the exhaust hose
(the one connected to the racking cane) and put it in the secondary
carboy "filling" it with CO2.  When filled (an hour maybe?), pop an
air lock on it and keep it around for the next week when you rack to
it.  Then remove the Fermentap from the primary, clean it, put it in
the secondary, invert, etc.  I would guesstimate that this method is 
over 95% O2 free and about $30 cheaper than buying 2 Fermentaps.


I really don't have a problem if someone wants to do the 2 Fermentap
method.  I just didn't appreciate the salesperson on the phone who
kept trying to goad me into buying the 2nd Fermentap.  He was convinced
I would _need_ it.

Correct.  But hard plastic in contact with my glass carboy or my formica
countertop makes for very slick contact surfaces.  A rubberized coating
would have been safer.


(Actually, the stand is one reason I was willing to pay 2x the price
for a Fermentap over a Brewcap.  It does look aestically pleasing.)


My last problem with using the Fermentap is temperature control.  Here
in California, I use a water bath to keep the carboy cool at least
6 months of the year.  I could put the whole inverted caroby w/ stand
in a water bath still, but lifting out every other day to drain trubage
and yeast would become a pain.  Not to mention disturbing the sediment.


Anyone else have a good method for keeping it cool?

In my previous post on proposed American Classic Pilsner styles, I said:


> I propose two divisions:  Pre-prohibition, OG 1.150 - 1.060, 25 - 40 IBU;
> post prohibition, OG 1.044-1.049. 20 - 20 IBU. 
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^
I meant, 20 - 30 IBU.


So how does a new style get adopted, anyway?  Especially now, with the 
AHA/HWBTA split?

Oh, dear...
I've always assumed that covering the kettle to minimize heat input was
just dandy since, no matter how much heat you put into it, the wort temp
never exceeds 212F.  Jim, (or anyone who shares this opinion) could you be
more specific?  What types of kettle reactions are going on here, what
sorts of volatiles need to be vented?  Why did no one tell me this earlier?
(It seems counter-intuitive, but I'm always willing to learn).  Private
post is fine (unless you think there's general interest in this topic).
I'll post a summary to the digest.   TIA

Don't know if it's possible.  Do know that, at a minimum, you will require
_vast_ amounts of water.  Even the Willamette valley is not always wet
enough for these thirsty buggers (and that's saying a lot).  In the Valley
of the Sun you may have to drag a hose out to the vines and keep it running
constantly ;-).


Consider trying to grow them outside the traditional growing season by
refrigerating the rhizomes, then planting in the 'winter' (never tried it,
but it's a thought).  Your County Extension agent may know about techniques
for growing temperate-climate plants in hostile (relatively and
herbaceously speaking) environments.


Good luck and let us know how you do.


>>>>>>>>>>
On an un-related topic.  I've heard that adding very small amounts (grams
per batch) of roasted barley (black) will benefit any style of beer.  Once
source says that it reduces oxidation, another (Charlie P.) says that it
improves flavor by reducing polyphenols.  Neither source cites any study.
Can anyone verify/contradict these statements?  Is this the new magic
ingredient to replace coriander?  TIA

5 minutes after reading the recent post regarding the Fermtap equipment I was
on the phone with them to get information.


I now have the brochure and have some questions for anyone who uses it or
has used it but decided against it.


1) It obviously negates the idea of doing blow-off during the primary (since
   it's only a 3/8" tube).  (At least, that neagtes it in my book...)


   This being the case, what size primary do you use?


2) How well does the filter filter In areas of yeast capturing and trub
removal?


3) Yeah it's cool & all that, has it really saved you any time & effort?


4) What, based on your use, do you see as the negatives about using it?




Here's a more general question for all:


Does anyone use copper or brass for a racking tube?

Subject: Brewing Study in Belgium


Last October, while web-surfing, I found the page for the K.U. Leuven.  I
checked it today and it is now considerably cruder, but it still includes
a Master of Malting and Brewing Sciences program.  I assume the program is
in English, since a score of 550 on TOEFL is required.  The other
prerequisite is a Bachelor/Masters in Ag.  Sciences.  The course lasts a
year full-time, but half-time study is available.


This information can be found in the KU Leuven Gopher under the
International Study heading.


As a general complaint I note that European Ag schools (where brewing seems
to live) are the last people to put their info. on the web.

If you have access to a the World Wide Web and a Web browser (Mosaic, Air
Mosaic, Netscape), there are a number of resources.  Probably the best
starting point is The Brewery home page at http://alpha.rollanet.org/.
It has a reference to Spencer's Beer Page which is another good information
source.

Subject: Cooler Mashout


Most recently I was having a discussion with a friend of mine concerning 
"Cooler" tun method sparge tempratures.  Im curious what the HBD 
collective has to say about it.  


Typicaly, *I* thought that the sparge temprature was to be 170.  
Meaning that you want to sustain 170F for the duration of the sparge.  
Using the cooler method, in order for you to sparge at that temprature 
you either have add a signficant amount of boiling water to raise the 
temprature to 170, then continue to add 170F water for the sparge, or 
perform a decoction and use that to raise the temprature to 170.


Since alot of people dont perform decoctions, or dont want to, typicaly 
Id scratch off that method.  Adding extra water to bring the temp up to 
170 leaves you with a very watery mash and really no need to add any 
sparge water...


So, *MY* alternative when I mash was to sparge with boiling water.  That 
effectivly rinses my grains and brings it up to 170 fairly quickly since 
im removing ~156F water, and adding ~212F water.  


This is where I was told that I should *NOT* add boiling water, and just 
add 170F water.  Now, am I off base here?  Discussion of extracted 
tannins and such from the mash was the main concerns for using boiling 
water.  Ive been using this method now for some time with really no 
adverse effects in taste.  


Does anyone care to share thier experience on sparging with the cooler 
method?


TIA

Subject: Racking


Whenever I rack beer from one carboy to another I run into the
same problem.Right where the hose meets the racking cane, I get
a diminished flow rate. Sometimes just a trickle. It seems like
reason for this is the difference in inside diameter between
the cane and the hose. Does anyone out there know of any racking
tubes for sale that are 1 piece? Or maybe someone has a system
that works well for them that they wouldn't mind sharing. If you
can help me with this drop me a line at dsgje`at`acad2.alaska.edu
                    Thanks,
                  Gregory Egle
