To the cauldron on brewing knowledge,


   Just for those of you who are interested, here is a little more info
on the recent passage of the Georgia Brewpub bill.
  -it passed 42 - 9, those nine votes against coming from old-time
   conservative anti-alcohol men
  -there was much political wrangling over the measure; Miller and the
   other big guys required that a line be inserted that the brewpubs
   must offer beers other than their own in bottles or cans; the
   Senator in control of the bill's fate in the last few days of the
   session essentially blackmailed the bill's sponsor into voting for
   his bill in order to get the brewpub bill out of committee - the
   brewpub bill's sponsor opposed the other bill, but voted for it
   anyway to assure passage of the brewpub law, and I thank her for it.
  -as for plans on new brewpubs, the law goes into effect July 1,
   assuming the governor signs it, and I know of at least one company
   in Athens, GA (home of the Bulldogs), that is prepared to open on
   August 1.  There is another company in Athens that is also looking
   to open up.  As for Atlanta, I don't know.  The first Athens brewpub
   (Athens Brewing Company) is planning on offering a wheat, a porter,
   a pilsner, and an ale year-round, plus 2 or 3 seasonal brews.


I'm glad to finally see Georgia leaving the stone-age . . . .

Subject: Lactic Acid Souring of Wits


Re: the current thread on Wit brewing and lactic acid additions;


I have a batch of Wit in primary now.  My local homebrew supply buddy threw
in a jar of lactic acid to my last order without any instruction.  I'd like
to bring up the acidity in the finished beer, and the recent thread seems to
advocate adding 10-15 ml of lactic acid at bottling time.  This raises three
questions.


1. Can I do this without shocking the yeast remaining in the beer for
carbonation?  I'd think a sudden change in the pH wouldn't make the fellows
happy.  Is the net change in pH small enough that this doesn't happen?  Does
the beer buffer the pH, but allow the *flavor* of the lactic acid addition to
come through?


2.  The jar of lactic acid isn't labelled.  Can I assume that its the 88% conc
entration that seems to be the standard?  If not, what should I assume?


3. I read in the latest Zymurgy that I should expect a 1-2 month lag for the
(paraphrasing) acid flavor to blend into the beer.  Feedback/experience?


Orange you glad I asked these important questions? TIA

Subject: RE: $0.30 Beer Engine


In HBD #1682 Jeff Renner suggested using an oral syringe as a pseudo-beer 
engine. I have a few laying around the house (one child), so last night I 
gave it a shot on a lightly carbonated pale ale (homebrew). WOW!!! It 
worked very well. Gobs of tiny bubbles from a beer that produced little
or no head when I poured it. The effect was very similar to the draughts
I had on two trips to England (Portsmouth and London). My first attempt
with the syringe was with a little too much beer. I was drinking 12 
ounces of beer from a pint mug, so nothing spilled over. My brother used 
less beer in the syringe, but pushed the plunger too hard...froth 
everywhere! By the time it settled down his mug was overflowing with froth,
but contained only a few ounces of liquid. The rest made a trail from my 
dishwasher, across the kitchen floor, and into the sink. If you use this 
method, remember that a little beer and pressure go a long way!

I've had the same experience to some extent. The two beers I've brewed with
the DC Pale Ale malt were cloudy.  One cleared OK in the secondary, but
became cloudy again after dry-hopping.  The second was cloudy from the
get-go.  My procedures didn't differ from other beers, so I'm puzzled too.
It's not a chill haze, as it occurs at room temp.  I haven't tried fining
the second one (it's still in secondary) but I may.

Subject: Valley Mill / Bernoulli vs. Venturi


I'm considering buying the new Valley roller mill.  Has anyone tried it and
if so, how does it look?


- -----------


Many of us use a tube with small holes in it to aerate our chilled wort.
The fast moving wort creates a lower pressure that draws the air in.  Isn't
this the Bernoulli effect rather than the Venturi effect as many have
referred to it on the digest?  A small point but if this is an error I
would hate to see it repeated over and over.

Jim Busch says:
>< Saturation for O2 in water at around room temperature is 
><on the order of 10 ppm.


>This is higher than the empirically determined values by Dr. Fix.
>It will be in his next book, from what I hear.


The saturation curve for water is empirically determined and well 
known. Fix has determined points on the saturation curve for _wort_ 
and found it to be significantly lower than for water. The higher the 
SG, the lower the saturation value. Don Put was kind enough to send 
me what appears to be a HBD posting from Fix about this, dated last 
June 9.


In any case, it doesn't really affect my main point, that saturation 
can be achieved in water (or an aqueous solution) with bubbled air. 
Pure 02 is not required.

Hunter8439 (?) asks about dry-hemping. Chuck Cox wrote the most 
thorough treatment I have seen of this, in last year's HBD. His was 
called "Special Hops" and dated Feb. 2. Seems to me I have seen 
another recipe somewhere on line--perhaps in Cat's Meow?

Subject: Boiling answers


Many thanks to the 5 respondants to my post last week re:boiling terms and
practices.  Here is the consensus of the responses:


Q. How much do you start boiling to end up with 5 gallons?
A. Muliply by 1.2 for extract and 1.3 for all-grain (60 minute boils).
Multiply by 1.55 for 90 minute boils (all-grain assumed).  The numbers all
account for evaporation and break being left behind.


Q. What does the term "Boil Volume" really refer to?
A. Amount of liquid in pot *prior* to start of boil, i.e. initial volume.


Q. Do you boil vigorously, gently, or?
A. Vigorously, for maximum extraction of alpha acids from hops and greatest
formation of hot break.


Q. Do you cover or uncover the brewpot?
A. Ah, some controversy at last!  Three respondants keep it partially covered
in order to reduce evaporation and maintain a vigorous boil.  The other two
completely uncover the pot(s) after reaching boil.  Now if I (without asking)
add Jim Busch's posted preference to boil uncovered (thanks Jim!), we have a
50/50 split.  I believe the use of puny electric stovetop burners is a big
factor in needing to keep the pots partially covered in order to keep a boil.
 But are the negative consequences (not evaporating undesireable volatiles,
etc) significant enough that I should buy a 150,000bu propane-fired burner?
(I only need *one* more justification! ;-)


So. Anyone care to pick up the needle and start sewing this thread?

I recently attempted to clone Pyramid Apricot Ale.  Recipe specifics:
        4 lbs. Alexander wheat extract
        1.4 lbs. Alexander wheat kicker
        4 oz. malto-dextrin
        14 IBU domestic Hallertauer (60 minute boil)
        Wyeast # 1056 liquid yeast
        3/4 cup corn sugar
        4 oz. apricot essence added to bottling bucket


OG of 1038 and FG of 1010.  It was bottled on 2/27/95.


I just sampled my first bottle.  I was disappointed at the relative lack 
of apricot character.  By the way, I used the 'standard' apricot essence 
that I bought from HopTech but is readily available from a number of 
different vendors.


I tried a side by side comparison with a bottle of Pyramid and noted that 
the commercial ale had a more pronounced apricot character.  Now, I am 
not looking to make apricot nectar, but I would have hoped for more 
apricot flavor.


Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  Although the recommended 
amount of apricot essence is four oz/five gallons, perhaps more is 
indicated.  Does anyone have any ideas about this?  If so, please post to 
the group.  Thanks.

Subject: honey brews


After a long time of lurking in the shadows, not having time (or at least,
not taking time) to brew, etc., I'm back.....  :-)


It's getting to be that time of the year again---summer is, for all
practical purposes, here, and it's time for nice clean, refreshing brews
to take the place of the darker, more full-bodied brews that I love so
much in the winter.  One of the many store-bought brews that I've found
lately is JW Dundee's Honey Brown lager.  Now, it isn't brown, by any
stretch of the imagination, but it has a wonderful honey flavor.


I've brewed several honey brews before, and they've all been among my
favorites, but this one has something that I've never gotten---the flavor
of honey as it tastes *BEFORE* the sugar ferments away.  Does anyone know
what they're doing to get that flavor to remain?  I'd guess that they're
adding a lot of honey at bottling, but since the bottles don't explode,
that doesn't seem too likely.


I'm not looking to clone this beer, as such, but rather to add that flavor
to my own honey brews.  If anyone has any suggestions along this line, I'd
love to hear them.


Thanks,

Dry Hopping
************
I just finished bottling my first batch of dry hopped beer.  I
used pellets, and dropped them directly into the secondary,
without a bag.  I bottled after 3 weeks, and all the hops
appear to have settled to the bottom.  I had no problems
racking into my bottling bucket, and the brew was very clear.
And, it tasted pretty good flat.  I can't wait to try it after
it's carbonated.


Mittelfrueh Hops
****************
Last week I received 400 grams (about 14 oz) of Mittlefrueh
Hops from the fine folks at Boston Beer Company.  This is the
variety used in Sam Adam's Boston Lager.  It's supposed to be
very rare, and very good.  I've not seen it in any of the
catalogs I have.  I've also not seen any recipes that call for
it.  I plan to use it for flavor/arome/dry hopping.  Does
anyone have any particular experience with Mittlefrueh that
would be worth sharing with the group?
