Subject:       Venturi vs. Bernoulli


For Geoff Scott:


I'm sorry that I missed the first part of this discussion, but from 
what you describe, it sounds more like the Bernoulli effect than 
Venturi.  A Venturi tube is one in which flow cavitates (i.e. the 
liquid turns back into vapor because of a reduction of pressure) 
because of changes in the tubes diameter.  If this is what is 
happening in your tube, then no aeration is taking place since the 
bubbles in the fluid are simply the fluid in a vapor state.  However, 
if you are getting aeration by having air sucked in through a small 
hole, then a good explanation would be that the reduced pressure due 
to the moving fluid (Bernoulli effect) is causing it.  I hope this 
helps.

1) You can also buy cracked wheat at many grocery or health food stores.  Save
your mill!


2) As many have said, the recipe does not call for cooking the raw wheat ahead
of time.  Presumably the extended protein rests does what you want instead.

I've got one (1st owner I believe!).  It's a 2 roller, adjustable mill.  The
rollers
are 9" long x 1" diameter knurled stainless steel with a direct drive handle
(i.e. no gears or pulleys).  The hopper is large a is quickly attached to (or
dettached from) the mill with plastic/nylon screws.  I've only used it nce
so far
so my report is brief - went quick, worked flawlessly, good crush.

     I tried Honey Brown on draft for the first time at T.G.I. Fridays.  I 
     don't think its an outstanding beer by any means, but I agree with Jim 
     that it has an incredible honey character.  The honey aroma of this 
     beer was as pronounced (or more so) than any mead I have ever had.  I 
     have also used honey several times in different beers, but I have 
     never had a *honey* character as a result, especially one this strong. 
     I'm not sure I would want this character in a beer, but I'm also very 
     curious how they did it.

Okay east coast brew historians... what can you tell me about Evans Ale?
My sisters hubby came up with this brown beer bottle at an antique store
(really cool, sort of tapered in towards the bottom) that is embossed with
the words "Evans Ale" and around the other side "Hudson New York" or Hudson
Brewing company."  Does this ring a bell with anyone? Seems umusual because
of the lack of ale brewing in this country (except for the recent boom in
the NW microbrew industry).  Perhaps it is one of those cream ales like Red

I read this in Charlie's new book (he suggests it for reduction of chill haze), 
and gave it a shot.  I only added a couple of ounces in the mash out, but 
the beer turned out slightly darker than I thought it should have.  I saw 
no difference in chill haze, but there are too many factors involved to 
isolate a definitive cause and effect.  The beer tasted great, so it 
certainly didn't hurt.


The *LAST* thing I want to do is drag up the coriander thread, but I am 
curious as to how it started.  I read a few tongue-in-cheek posts in the 
HBD, but I think they referenced other sources that I must have missed.  
Can someone send me private mail on how all this got started?  Just the 
facts, Mam :-)

Subject: Watered Down Taste






I've been having problems in the way may beer tastes. I have brew 6 
batches of beer all of them seem to have this funny watered down 
taste to them. In my last batch I attempted to go all out on this amber 
ale by adding 6lbs. of alexanders malt and 3lbs. of the pale DME.  Then I 
used 2 oz. of Willamette for my starting and 1/2 oz. of Columbus (alpha 
13.0) in my finishing hops. I had no problems with head retention, 
clarity, carbonation, or aroma. In fact, I was very happy with them, but 
when I drank it, I got a lot of hops and a bit of malt with a watered 
down flavor. All of my previous batches have had a similar watery after 
taste and all used different malts and hops.  I also boil 3 gallons of 
water and then add water to make five gallons before pitching my yeast. 
All of my yeasts were Wyeast packages except for the first and second 
batches and all were ale yeasts except my second batch which was a steam 
beer.  Any ideas on how to cure this problem?


Thanks,
        Eric

I generally start with 8.5 gallons, boil vigorously and uncovered for 90
minutes and get about 5 gallons.  This is 1.7x.  I use one of those
100,000+ BTU Cajun Cookers and when I boil I really rock!  Throwing some
used caps into the boil to act as boiling stones will increase and even
out your boil vigor.  Also being able to use a high starting volume like
8.5 gal increases your sparge efficiency.

Especially if you use an immersion chiller (or a snow bank) it is 
important to  boil vigorously and probably uncovered to get rid of the 
DMS precursors.


Well Pat here it is, BUY THE MONSTER!  They're cheap (get a ring burner, not
the rocket tube), they boil wort and water very quickly, but DON'T use 
them on unshielded linoleum (it melts).  The burner and the 10 gal stainless
Volrath pot are my two items that most contribute to ease of brewing.  One
more suggestion, get 2 20lb propane bottles.  If one is always full, then
you never need worry if you have enough propane to finish the batch.

Starch haze?  Unconverted starch being leached from the mash.  Perhaps
your sparge water is too hot.  Perhaps your grain should be crushed a bit
finer to encourage complete conversion.  


OTOH Scott said that one beer was clear until dry-hopping and to me this
implies tannins (polyphenols) from the hops agglutinating with the protein
in the wort to create an insoluble haze.  Try a protein rest or Irish 
Moss in the boil.

No! We need to go back to our first year chemistry textbooks. Henry's law
states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is proportional to its
partial pressure in the vapor phase. Henry's law holds for dilute
solutions; oxygen or air at one atmosphere in wort or water is definitely a
dilute solution. Thus as air is 20.9% oxygen, a wort this is completely
aerated (i.e., in equilibrium) with air will contain 4.8 times less oxygen
that one that is in equilibrium with a 100% oxygen environment.


For water the solubility of oxygen is well known, at 25C (77F) it 40.89 ppm
(w/w), and due to the fact that air is 20.9% oxygen, completely aerated
water will contain 8.55 ppm oxygen.


Apparently, the presence of wort sugars effects oxygen solubility causing
it to decrease with increasing SG.

The Brimstone Brewery from Baltimore has a Honey Red Ale which has this same
honey characteristic. I spoke with Marc the brewmaster/owner last Friday at
the Camden Yards beer fest. He said that they add 60+ lbs (per 60bbl batch)
of autoclaved honey after fermentation is complete and the beer has been
filtered to remove the yeast. The beer is then carbonated and sent on its way.
I don't know if this level of filtration is available at the homebrewer's level
but that seems to be the key to keeping the honey from fermenting.
Has anyone out there who filters their homebrews ever tried something like this?

P.S. Just returned from another wonderful visit to the Great Lakes Brewing Co.
in Cleveland this weekend. Good beers, good food... Got a peek at the new 30bbl
system in the adjacent building, very pretty. Six 3000 gal tanks just dying to
be filled with good beer, plus many other smaller (relatively) fermenters.
Hopefully, the quality will stay and the beers will make it to the east coast
so i don't have to smuggle it back in my suit case anymore...

Subject: Grain bills


Hi -
  I have a question about adjusting the grain bill of a recipe in order to
reach the desired OG. I recently switched over to all grain brewing and am 
now refining my technique to improve my extraction efficiency. This past 
weekend I brewed up a stout. In order to get the gravity I wanted, I had to 
increase the amount of pale malt by a certain amount, based on my previous 
mashing events. I did not increase the amount of specialty grains, specifically
the roasted barley because it seemed, at the time, that I might
end up with too much flavor from the roasted barley. Finally, my question: 
when scaling up a recipe to hit the called for OG, should all the grains be 
increased by the same factor? Or to put it another way: is the contribution
to the flavor of the beer from specialty grains proportional to extraction of
sugar from the malt? I ask this because my stout doesn't look too stout and
if I had used more dark grain, it would have been darker.


  On another topic, I was browsing CMIII and noticed that many of the extract
based oatmeal stout recipes feature a "steep the oatmeal" step. I was under

Subject: Zima, What is it?


     I'm sure this question has been asked before, so please forgive the 
     waste of bandwidth, but, WHAT THE HELL IS ZIMA (nasty stuff).  Is it 
     grain alcohol added to artificially citrus-flavored carbonated water?
     
     OK, perhaps a more intelligent question...
     
     I recently brewed a dark bitter using a half pound of black patent 
     malt, and roasted barley in addition to DME.  It came out wonderful, 
     however, I taste Chocolate!!  I added no chocolate malt, and since I 
     am still relatively new to brewing (this was my 5th batch), I wonder 
     if this is to be expected, or does it come from the patent malt (my 
     first time using specialty grains other than crystal malt).
     
     Keep up the good work.  As for brewing; I, for one, am having a ball 
     with this!

Maybe they DO add a lot of honey at bottling, right after they filter out
or kill the yeast.  That's the only thing I could think of.  I guess I
kinda like a sweet beer sometimes.  Some folks I know hate the sweetness
of Dundee's.  My recent Roccy Racoon (TNCJOHB) started out kinda sweet
but has gotten quite dry.  I liked it then and I like it now, but this
is one beer (RR honey lager) that I think has not improved with age as much
as most.  It's changed a LOT, but most of my beers get more malty while 
the RR has seemingly lost a lot of it's early character to higher alcohol
content.  It's got quite a kick now, one month after bottling.  Perhaps it's
mostly that I am more accustomed to ales that pretty much stop fermenting
after I refrigerate them, but my theory is that it's mostly the honey.  I
guess I will figure it out because I plan to make good use of my brew fridge
this summer.  I brewed RR with Wyeast Bavarian Lager yeast, and then I used
the yeast cake from the primary for a batch of "Dr. Bock." (My 3rd batch
from TNCJOHB)

Subject: Cold box ANSWER!




  I got a lot of replies and a lot of requests for the answers I received on 
  my question about the cold box article.  There was some confusion over what 
  I wanted to do as several people thought I intended to turn my upright 
  freezer on its back and make it a chest freezer.  What I actually wanted to 
  do was remove the door, build an insulated plywood box and attach it to the 
  front of the freezer, and attach the door to that.  That would give me an 
  area to chill kegs and/or carboys in the box while using the shelves in the 
  original freezer part for bottles, etc.  Many thanks to all respondents but 
  especially to Stan Gregory and Jeff Nielsen who pointed me to the exact 
  issue and page number of Zymurgy where Byron Burch's article appears.  It 
  is called "Stalking the Wild Cold Box" and is in the 1992 Special issue of 
  Zymurgy, volume 15, No. 4 on page 22.  Byron actually bought his unit, a 
  refrigerator with a box added to the front, from a customer.  I intend to 
  turn my freezer sideways and attach the door to the side of the plywood box 
  to allow easier access to the shelves in the freezer compartment (the one 
  thing that Byron said he would change if he built one of his own - the unit 
  he bought has the door on the front).  Anyway, this will allow me to chill 
  up to 18 kegs in the plywood box portion of the cold box and I would lay 
  another 6 to 8 on their sides inside the freezer itself.  More than 
  adequate space for me!  I also intend to ferment in it as well.  Now, time 
  to buy that temperature controller...

 Howdy,


I've been following the thread on Celis White & orange peels.  I've been out
to the brewery a few times, & have only heard mention of bitter (or Curacao)
peels, but never sweet peels.  So, if you want to make a Celis White clone,
use those.  However, if you're trying to make your own Wit, do what you want.
I know that Pierre Celis revived the style, but I don't know what other
brewers of the past used before him.


BTW, P. Celis originally used a small amount of raw oats when he was brewing
Hoegaarden Wit.  Has anyone tried this when making their own homebrew?

My brother-in-law and I took the Celis tour this past Saturday and posed 
the question of sweet or bitter orange peel usage in Celis White.  While 
this stumped our cheery young tour guide, a brewer was also present and he 
told us they use *bitter* orange peel.  Also, they have no immediate

Eric, if I'm not mistaken, far from beating a dead horse, yours is 
only the second post I've seen in response to the Fermentap review--
the horse isn't even comatose!
I'm beginning to think that the inverted carboy method is one I need to 
adopt, since after a year-and-a-half of struggle I remain 
siphon-impaired.  Though it seems the big drawbacks might be the 
inability to use those convenient hop pellets in either the boil or in 
dry-hopping, I still think the minimal exposure of wort to air makes this 
practice one best suited for me.  I'd be interested in more specific 
information--as may your fellow BrewCap users--about the stand you guys 
built and how it incorporates the Lazy Susan bearings.

I knew there was something I forgot to cover (hunh, huh) last week....


Pat asks:


<Q. Do you cover or uncover the brewpot?
<A. Ah, some controversy at last!  Three respondants keep it partially covered
<in order to reduce evaporation and maintain a vigorous boil.  The other two
<completely uncover the pot(s) after reaching boil.  Now if I (without asking)
<add Jim Busch's posted preference to boil uncovered (thanks Jim!), we have a

<factor in needing to keep the pots partially covered in order to keep a boil.
< But are the negative consequences (not evaporating undesireable volatiles,
< etc) significant enough that I should buy a 150,000bu propane-fired burner?
< (I only need *one* more justification! ;-)


A partially covered pot is OK.  I would try to situate it so that any
condensate will not end up back in the kettle, if possible.  A partially
covered pot will still allow the desirable venting of the boiled off
volatiles.  In the large copper onion dome kettles, there is a special
device in the chimney flue.  This device traps the condensed vapors and
channels it into a drain, thereby preventing the vapors from returning
to the kettle.  This is very desirable.  My own advice is that if you have
to cover the pot to keep it boiling, then invest in a gas or propane brewing
stove.  Probably the most versatile is the Superb, but the cheapest $/BTU
is likely the cajun cooker.

Fellow Brewers,


I was in Milwaukee yesterday, and had lunch at the Water Street Brewery.
The food was good, but the Weiss Beer I ordered tasted "yeasty".  I don't
mean a little yeasty... the predominant flavor was yeast!  When he 
brought it to the table, the aroma of yeast was obvious (even to my wife
who only has an occasional homebrew).  It was not very clear either.


I decided to try a "professional" wheat beer to see if I liked it enough to 
try a batch.  My question:  is that what wheat beer is supposed to taste 
like, or did I happen to go there on a "bad brew day"?  


BTW, even though my wife offered to drive home, I decided NOT to have another

Subject: Terminal Gravity Calculation


I've been all-grain brewing for over a year now, and I'm progressively
straying farther and farther from published recipes, and more and more into
developing my own.  I'm now pretty consistent with my OG calculations, but
I'm still uncertain about how to calculate terminal gravities, specifically
with regards to the mix in the grain bill.


Yes, obviously there are a whole bunch of variables that will affect
attenuation - mash temp., yeast selection, fermentation management, etc. etc.
 What I have not seen discussed anywhere is the effect on terminal gravity of
the grain bill.  I would expect, for instance, that crystal malts would
exhibit a lower attenuation than 2-row pale malts, ie, lead to a higher
terminal gravity.  But how much?  Are there better rules of thumb than 75%
attenuation?  What's the contribution of darker and roasted malts?  How about
adjuncts?  I would guess that corn sugar would attenuate by nearly 100%.  On
the other side of the ledger, I would guess that dextrin powder would
attenuate somewhere around 0%.


I've tried deducing the answer from a wide range of recipes with published OG
& TGs, but haven't found anything like a consistent computation - not
surprising given all of the other variables.


I'm new to the Net so if this has been discussed elsewhere, please point me
there by private mail.  Otherwise, let's have at it!

On 3-26-95 Michael Lloyd asks for ideas on apricot beer, trying to

I don't have an answer but am thinking about making an apricot beer later 
this year using this rough recipe:  6 lb 2-row, 1-2 lb malted wheat, 
0.5-1 lb Carapils, 0.5-0.7 oz. medium alpha hop.  For the fruit I was 
planning on rehydrating non-sulfured dried apricots, mixing in a blender, 
pasteurizing the mess, then adding directly to the secondary fermenter.   I 
also plan to do the same thing using frozen cranberries and split the 
batches with Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) and 1333 (Alt) yeast.  My question 
is how much dried apricot to use for 2.5 gallons?   


I haven't been satisfied with the flavor of the fruit extracts.  
I've tried peach, pear, and cranberry.  The cranberry was the most passable 
but the rest didn't taste quite right.  I'd be curios about the apricot.

Okay here it is, I am fairly new to homebrewing, and found a recipie for 
Bruce and Kays Black Honey Spruce Lager.  The recipie sounds great, but when 
talking to my supplier, he said I should just use Ale yeast instad of Lager. 
 The recipie is as follows:


3.3 lbs John Bull plain dark malt extract syrup
2 lbs plain dried amber malt extract
2 lbs light honey
3/4 lbs crystal malt
1/3 lbs black patent malt
1&1/2 oz Cascade hops (Boiling)
1/2 oz Hallertauer Hops (finishing)
1 oz Spruce Essence
1 to 2 Packages lager yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (Bottling)


So my situation.  The instructions are kind of vague from there, and I need 
to know what to do.  How long to ferment initially, at what temp, does it 
need secondary fermenter, how long there?
And of course the original question, Ale vs. Lager.  I can put it an a 
fridge I have handy I think, but I have no idea how to regulate the temp.
Anyway, I know this is alot, but any help would be appreciated.
Thanks, jeff

Subject: DeWolf-Cosyns Pale Ale Malt


Steve Zabarinck in HBD#1689 and Scott Barrett in HBD#1690 mention
clearing problems with the D-C Pale Ale malt. My recent experience
with this malt has been limited, so the following should be seen as
tentative.


It is abundantly clear from the malt analysis sheets that both the
D-C Pils and Pale Ale malts are quite different items than the
ones originally distributed by Siebels. The data and analysis in 
my BT article are relevant only to the latter. I mentioned the attributes
of the new Pils malt in an earlier HBD post, and for the reasons cited
there I am no longer using this malt. Anecdotal evidence exits that
suggest the problems Steve and Scott cite with the Pale Ale malt
are not uncommon. I have heard of slow and turbid lautering, beers which
are very hard to filter, and related problems. Intuitively this
would seem to point to elevated wort beta-glucan levels, however
I have not seen data to support this. My recommendation is to change
malts. There is simply too much good malt out there, and thus no need to  
suffer potential defects lightly.


The speciality of DeWolf-Cosyns has always been their color malts. These
IMHO are still the gems they always have been.


I have also had some e-mail from people complaining about the beer flavor
obtained from malt produced from Maris Otter barley. This comes as a
complete surprise for it has the reputation for being the UK's finest
(which is some feat!). I have not brewed with this malt for a couple of
years, and I would be interested to hear of some recent experiences.
Are these deficiences with the brewing material or is it "operator
error"?

Subject: Movie recommendation for stout lovers


I was going to brew a stout today anyway, but I was further inspired by
a movie my wife and I rented this weekend, and thought I'd recommend it
to HBD, since stout was featured prominently.  It's called "The
Snapper."  It is a refreshing, low budget Irish comedy, set in a working
class neighborhood in Ireland.  It is about a 20 year old young women
who lives with her parents and five siblings in a small council flat.
She becomes pregnant and refuses to tell who the father is.  The title
refers the "little snapper" she is carrying.  There are many scenes in
the corner pub, and lots of stout with THICK heads.  In one scene, a
freshly drawn stout is set before the father, and the anticipation he
shows waiting for it to settle so he can drink it is wonderful. The
language is authentically coarse, the kids get swatted around a little,
and there are a couple of mild sex scenes, so it isn't appropriate in
that respect for preteens (it's an "R").  Otherwise, it's endearingly
wholesome.  We really enjoyed it.


Now back to beer.

I want to second with details what Dave Sapsis posted here a few months
ago about American roasted barley.  He cautioned that it is too light in
color to give authentic color to a dry stout.  He recommended Baird.
I've done some checking.  All the brewing books say that roast barley
has a color in the 500's.  Our local stores carry Briess, and comparing
it to black patent malt (550L) and chocolate (350L) shows it to be much
closer to the chocolate.  I've used it in stout `at` 15% and didn't get the
appropriate opaque blackness or the smokey roasty stout flavor.  I
requested a British one, and the store got M&F, which I brewed with `at`
10% today, with appropriate results.  It is at least as dark as patent,
and should compare with Baird.
