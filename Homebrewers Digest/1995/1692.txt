Subject: Temperature-Controlled Fermenter




Thanks to Jeff Renner (previously known as "From *Jeff* Renner) I am now
also *previously* known as "From *Don* Put."  Thanks again for the prompt,
Jeff.


The digest seems to run a bit short these days, so I thought an update on
the temperature-controlled fermenter I'm working on wouldn't be too 
intrusive.


As some of you may remember, I bought a surplus cooling unit from a place
called Surplus Center (see below for info).  It was originally designed as a 
desktop soda dispenser.  It's a nice little unit and there's quite a few 
usable parts on it.  For instance, there's a carbonation chamber with a SS 
relief valve rated 90psi, a small 24 volt mixer assembly complete with 
transformer (I plan on using this for a wort stirrer during my chill phase--
this idea courtesy of Bob Jones--a small pump (I believe it had 
something to do with the carbonation chamber or product movement), a
nice circuit board and connectors that have to do with temp, pump, and
carbonation control (but I have NO idea how to use this without a schematic),
and the actual cooling system itself.  This consists of a compressor, a 
small condenser with fan, and a jacketed product tank.  The cooling band 
wraps around the product tank (which is plastic and too small for our needs 
as a coolant reservoir) and is made out of some very flexible metal that 
has ribbed evaporator bands molded into it.  This cooling jacket measures
about 6"-8" wide by about 33" long.  It could be easily mounted to another
reservoir of just about any shape as long as its mounted right above
the compressor assembly.  Given the small size of the condenser, I'm not
sure how much cooling this unit is capable of, but I'd be willing to bet
it could keep the temperature rise associated with fermentation under
control with no trouble at all.  


Here's the way I'm planning to use it right now:


I'm going to wrap 50' of 3/8" copper line tightly around my new fermenter 
spacing each coil about 1/2" apart.  I plan on putting the copper tubing 
through some rollers to flatten it out a bit so that the temperature 
transfer is a bit better.  Before I wrap the fermenter, I'm going to 
coat the SS with some sealant so that any condensate that forms will not
provide an electolyte for reactions between the SS and the copper (thanks
to John Palmer for this advice).  I will also put a coating of sealant
over the copper pipe once the wrapping is complete.  All of this will be
covered with a SS jacket that will be spaced away from the coils about 
1.5".  This area will then be filled with spray foam insulation, which
should help prevent any condensation buildup.


BTW, I recently toured the Blind Pig brewery in Temecula (the brewmaster
is Vinnie Cilurzo; a real nice guy) and their primary fermenters had 
flexible *rubber* cooling bands that had ribs wherein the coolant 
circulated.  Vinnie said they came with the fermenters and didn't know 
where to get more.  Does anyone have a guess where I could find these
bands?


A new coolant reservoir that will hold glycol coolant for the coil and a 
more in reserve will be fabricated out of SS to fit my needs both
with regard to storage capacity and space (I plan on mounting the glycol
unit right under the fermenter to make a neat little package).  The flexible
cooling band will be wrapped around the coolant storage tank, which will
then be surrounded by a SS jacket with insulation blown into the cavity  
just like on the fermenter.  This whole assembly will be connected to the 
fermenter by using tubing and quick disconnects so that the fermenter can 
easily be moved outside for cleaning without the cooler assembly attached.  
A small pump will circulate the coolant through the second stage, as it 
were.  


I also kicked around using the conventional SS jacket setup, but decided
the coils will work better with less hassle for my purposes.  


I'll use a remote bulb type thermostat and make a "bulb" well out of some 
thin-walled SS tubing that will be welded into the side of the fermenter to 
sense the actual wort/beer temperature.  I'll also weld in a thermometer
well so that the temperature can be monitored carefully (after all, that's
the point, isn't it ;-)  The thermostat will trigger the whole unit, i.e.,
the cooling system and circulation pump.  Because the amount of coolant will
be relatively small (about 4 gallons) and in a well-insulated container, I
don't think I'll need to keep the coolant a constant temperature.  Those of
you in warmer climates might need to add another thermostat to keep the 
coolant cold, with the unit "idling," as it were.    


I hope to have the whole unit complete in about two weeks.  Of course, that
depends on how fast I can get my welder friend to put all the pieces I cut
out together.  I believe a keg of Vienna might make him move a bit faster ;-)

The cooling unit is in catalog #267 on page 145.  The way it's pictured you
can't really see the reservoir above the compressor.  Also, there are a LOT
of parts that aren't shown in the picture.  One caveat:  they claim it's
new, but mine had obviously been used a bit because there was some dust
in the condenser fins.  It's VERY CLOSE to new, however, and everything
on my unit works.  It costs ~47.00 plus shipping.


Any feedback on any of the above will be appreciated.

PS - Of course, as Bob Jones and I talked about over a few beers
a while back, you could always just use a pump, a thermostat, and a coolant 
reservoir that sits in a sparge frigerator or freezer compartment to 
circulate coolant through the jacket.  But that's too easy, and I don't have 
any extra refrigerator space at this point!

It was this sort of reasoning that led me to make my original post 
on this subject, where I said that air works as well as O2 to 
saturate water or an aqueous solution with O2, and we achieve 
saturation regularly in aquaria and wastewater. Unfortunately, the 
previous posters had not been as clear in their comments as 
Steve is, so I did not see where the common ground lay.


I see now that we have been using the term "saturation" in 
different ways. In the limnological contexts I am used to seeing 
it, saturation of water with O2 clearly refers to it holding as 
much as it can in real-life situations, i.e. with exposure to 
atmospheric oxygen. I am at a conference and do not have my tables 
with me, but 8.55 ppm sounds like exactly the standard figures 
given and that we have achieved for saturation at 25 C. (Actually, 
we usually work closer to 20 C and around 10 ppm for saturation.)


That "saturation" means, in chemistry circles, the total amount of 
O2 water can hold under the best possible circumstances, i.e. in 
equilibrium with pure gaseous oxygen, is of course reasonable. (I 
knew that once.) I did not think of that use of the word when I 
wrote my post. I never work in a pure O2 environment and have 
heard anyone claim to brew in pure O2. But upon further 
reflection, I suppose this is what users of O2 do--they bubble O2 
through their wort in a vessel that is closed enough so a pillow 
of O2 forms over the water, allowing higher levels of DO. Is this 
right, you O2 users out there?


Since these two uses of "saturation" are both used in different 
scientific circles, then it is important to specify when one is 
talking about _chemical_ saturation. It may seem obvious to 
chemists out there, but it is not to anyone whose advanced studies 
have been limnological. 


Another good rule for commucation is to talk about ppm whenever 
possible. That also makes sense biologically--yeast "feel" the ppm 
of O2 in the water, not the % saturation. The critical question 
is, what biological effect on the little critters does one get at 
different ppm?


I look at George Fix's experiments again with new eyes. He bubbled 
in O2 to test the "saturation limit" of wort at different 
temperatures and SGs. I assume he means chemical saturation here, 
then. If so, wort holds _dramatically_ less O2 than water. He 
found, for example, that the limit was 5.6 ppm DO at 20C and 
1.060. Since 20C water in _air_ can hold around 10 ppm, that means 
that it can hold close to 50 ppm O2 in an O2 environment. (Are you 
near your tables, Steve?) The saturation limit for 1.060 wort at 
20C is, then, little more than 10% of what it is for water. Wow!


I will drop a line to Fix to see whether this interpretation is 
correct. And it sounds like it is time to take the O2 electrode 
from the aquaculture to the brewing cabin, to check out DO levels 
in my splash-aerated wort.

Subject: Glass lined fermenters?


While visiting a friend in Idaho last week the subject of pico breweries 
came up.  He's put most of the parts together (including a commercial 
zoned building), but doesn't want to buy 50-100 gallon stainless fermenters.


We talked and sampled some of his test batches.  In the fullness of time 
(and bladder) I wandered back to the bathroom and noticed the glass lined 
hot water heater next to the toilet.


I don't recall this particular solution coming up before, but it seems to 
me (on the face of it) to be a reasonable solution to his problem.


Given that there may be some difficulty in removing the top (for 
cleaning), are there other good reasons that this would not be a good 
thing to do?


TIA for any advice/guidance.

Subject: Re: Dry Hopping, and Hop Plants


Hi All,


   Just a comment on dry hopping.  I use a nylon hop bag that has a draw
string sewn into the top of the bag.  I use pellets, and the bag keeps most of
the hops out of the final beer, but not the hop nose :).  At first it was a
real pain to fish the hop filled bag out of the carboy before transferring to
the bottling bucket.  I tied a length of dental floss (unflavored, unwaxed) to
the end of the draw string, and now have no problem pulling the bag of hops
out.  I just tie the hop bag closed, and push it into the carboy, where the
bag floats at the top of the beer, and leave part of the dental floss hanging
out of the neck.  The fermentation lock and stopper easily seal the opening
from the outside.


   My hop plants seem to have made it through the winter, and have seen small
shoots poking through the mulch.  This year I plan to spray with Liquid Sevin
to keep the Japanese Beetles off.  They really tore them up last year.  Liquid
Sevin seems to be safe for a large number of fruits and vegetables, so I
believe it should be safe for hops.  Does anyone know if there is an
insecticide made specifically for hops?

Subject: Free Water Analysis  - my results


Well,


   A few weeks ago I wrote about free water analysis offered
by Sears.  I sent in a sample of my water and received the
analysis in the mail yesterday. It is by no means extensive
but it is free. Here's what I got:


   Hardness            measured in gpg as CaCO3
   Iron                measured in PPM as Iron
   PH
   Dissolved Solids    measured in GPG as CaCO3
   Stability Index


           (gpg = Grain per Gallon = 17.1 PPM)


   And, of course, along with the analysis is a recommended
Sears water filter that I should install.


   So, what I found out is: 
 
           1. I have soft water
           2. My Water PH is 7.5




    Now a Question:


           When I mash in with this water, will the Mash PH
           be 7.5 or will the combination (grist and water)
           have  lower PH?   Anyone know how I might calculate this?

Subject: Wheat Beer and Cloudiness/Clarity


Well,
  I made a Wit beer, but apparently overdid the protein rest or something. 
This is 45% raw wheat, 45% pils malt, and 10% oats.
  I poured some at a friend's house into a tall, thin pilsener glass.  Man, 
this beer was crystal clear and lighter than straw.  And I didn't want a clear
beer.  Anyway, I used no finings or anything--all I can figure is that I must 
have spent too much time at the lower, protein rest temps (122-128F).
  So, you who want really clear beer may want to try this yourself.  I was 
supposed to spend 10 minutes at 122, 124, and 126 by my recipe.  I must have 
spent much longer, though, probably heating too slowly to leave the range or 
something.

Sorry, but this is a mis-interpretation of Henry's law.  Henry's law is for
the equilbrium relationship of a non-critical gas, but the critical
temperature for oxygen is 154.6 K (about -180 F), so you can't really use
Henry's law as defined (the limit of the ratio of liquid phase fugacity to
mole fraction as mole fraction goes to zero) for this case.  (This sort of
problem is a classic "trick question" from graduate Chem Eng Thermo courses
 - and no, I didn't get it right when I took the course).  Also, the concept
of "dilute" refers to mole fraction in the solution (pure oxygen is not
dilute under any pressure or temperature) - mole fraction of oxygen in air
is 20.9% and the dilute region for equilibrium calculations is rarely
considered to be above 5-10%.


Of more importance is that there is no reason that air can't be used to
reach saturation if the gas is sufficiently soluble - this level of
saturation (40.89 ppm) doesn't care how you get there.  The data I've seen
posted on r.c.b. and in the digest tend to support that you don't need pure
oxygen.  It would take longer using air because the concentration
difference (the driving force for oxygen transfer into the liquid) is less,
but the same equilibrium could be reached.  It is reasonable to expect a
decreased solubility in a wort relative to water and I think I recall
George Fix posting some data to support this (am I correct?).


I can't wait to assign this to my Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics
students  next quarter!

Just curious -


        I saw an ad for Keystone claiming to be the "least bitter beer"
made.  I noticed in the fine print that this was "based on bittering
units".


        Does anybody know what IBU level Keystone has?  Is it actually
greater than zero?  Can it really have lezz than Zima?


        I'm not losing any sleep over this, but was wondering.

The dissolved oxygen level of water saturated with 100% oxygen at 20C is
44.6 ppm. For air saturation at 20C this would correspond to 9.3 ppm oxygen
in solution. Indeed, if George Fix's experiments are for 100% oxygen, the

  Gathered Brewers,


  My first post...I'm so proud!  Here's my situation:  My last two batches
  (an ESB and Barleywine) I made using Northwestern LME.  The ESB, with
  6# NW'n LME and 1# NW'n DME; the Barleywine with 12# NW'n LME and 1#
  honey.  Per SUDS 3.1, the ESBs OG should have been 1.054 and the
  Barleywines should have been 1.098, both, I feel, reasonable values.
  Upon brewing the ESB, the OG I measured was appx. 1.035.  Figuring that
  I just measured wrong, I brewed the Barleywine and the OG measured at
  appx. 1.055!  I don't think so!!  My question:  does anyone have any
  experience with Northwestern LMEs yielding low OGs.  I mean, I know
  how to use the hydrometer, checked the temperature, no bubbles, etc.
  The ESB is kegged and should be ready in about a week at which time I
  will conduct an alcohol content measurement of a more personal nature!
  I'm just kinda perplexed...any insight, e-mail or posted, will be
  appreciated.  And please, don't say "go all-grain" 'cause, well, I'm
  afraid!  So much more equipment and 'tuns' of new terms!!  Seriously tho,

You're using an all-extract recipe, Eric.  You should *always* steep some 
kind of grain in the brewing water as it comes to a boil when using 
extracts.  There are 10 lovibond crystal malts on the market to use for the 
lighter colored beers, darker lovibond crystals for amber and dark beers.  
Adding these grains will impart a much needed grain character and mouth 
feel to extract based beers.

I recently brewed an attempt at a Bavarian style wheat beer, with 100% malted
wheat, a long protein rest, and gelatin.  The stuff was "krystal" clear.  It
was absolutely delicious and the lack of haze didn't bother me at all.  (I 
brewed a pilsener around the same time which was much hazier.)  Anyway, the 
stuff was so good it was all I could do to save 2 bottles for a competetion,
which I found out wanted three.  I thought about calling around to see if any
of my friends had a bottle left (I'm a sharing guy) and then I just drank one.
No regrets here.  (The stuff was too light in body to win anyway.)


What was I saying?  Oh, yeah, go ahead and put some in.  I think 40% raw wheat
might not clear all the way, but I'd like to hear what happens.

I've had in bottles on three different occasions.  All three times I didn't 
notice much of any honey character, thought it was a bit cloying, and more 
than a bit stale.  This could be related more to the retailers than the 
producers.

I missed the coriander thread entirely.  Please send me some faxts, too.  
For one beer, I recently cilantro instead of coriander.  Oddly enough, after 
a couple months, it tasted just like coriander.  I thought that was cool.
I didn't notice any magical effects, though.

Probably.  However, 1 lb of most specialty grains imparts a very similar 
flavor as 1.25 lbs of the same grain.  Homebrewing is inexact enough that
you're likely to get more variations in flavor due to other factors, and 
you should concentrate more on upping your extraction than high precision
on your grain bill.

I tried to send this to Jeff by private e-mail, but it bounced.
Anyway, it may be useful to some other "fairly new" brewers, as
Jeff describes himself.  This is in reference to whether he should
use an ale or lager yeast in his honey ale:

I would highly recommend that beginning brewers stick to ale yeasts,
especially if they are using dried yeasts.  I've never used dried lager
yeasts myself, but I've heard many complaints about off-flavors from
them.  YMMV.  However, whether you can find a good dry lager yeast or
not, an ale yeast will be more forgiving as far as temperature and
off-flavors go.  Also, the ale yeast will ferment out faster, meaning
you can drink your beer sooner!
 
So, if you take my advice and use the ale yeast, then the other answers
are easy.  I would ferment an ale between 60 and 70F.  I use my basement,
which stays right around 60F year round, but in the past I've used 
apartment kitchens or whatever was available where I was living with
no big problems.  The higher the temperature, the more "ale" flavors
(like esters and fusel alcohols) will develop, however, a decent dry ale
yeast should go up to 70F without giving you many undesirable flavors.
As for how long to ferment, I use Dave Miller's rule that fermentation
is almost complete when the bubbling through the air lock is down to
one per minute.  Depending on the yeast you use and the temperature at
which it is fermented (higher temperature will ferment faster), it will
take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks to get down to this level (with dry
yeast packets at 65F, it will be closer to 3 days).  At that point, you 
can, if you want, use a secondary, but it isn't necessary.  I've decided 
that for most ales, there is little advantage to using a secondary, 
unless you are dry hopping (which your recipe doesn't call for).  If you 
use a secondary, leave it in there for a week or so.  If you don't, leave 
it in the primary for another 2-3 days after the air lock is down to 1 
bubble per minute.


Summary (for easy and good tasting):
yeast: ale (Edme is a good dry ale yeast)
temp:  55-70F (60-65 ideal)
time:  wait until bubble down to 1 per minute, then wait 3 more days
       (total time will probably be around 6-8 days)
secondary: no

I did essentially that (mine were sulfured; I washed them extensively but 
still got a lot of sulfurous smells coming out). I used 2 lbs (dry 
weight) for 2.5 gallons, and had a pretty orange ale with *no* apricot 
aroma or flavor whatsoever.


I have no idea where it went. The residual pulp was thoroughly tasteless, 
so either the apricot aromatics are very unstable, or they got scrubbed 
away by the CO2.

I think it's worth the small waste of BW to respond to Jeff (not Nancy)

Irish Stout. I myself have recently had a couple of opportunities to 
watch movies in which Guinness is (supposedly) supped. In "The Secret of 
Roan Inish", a wonderful Irish production, some fine, velvety pints of 
Guinness are tipped early in the movie. On the other hand, in "Blown 
Away", one of the most (black?) patently stupid movies I have ever seen, 
two characters toast each other with "Mother's Milk" in a Boston bar. 
The liquid in their glasses has zero head, less body, and is clearly 
either coffee, tea or Boston Harbour water. Maybe there is some strange 
law about showing actual alcoholic beverages in American movies, but at 
least they could have put some whipped cream on the glasses of coffee.

Subject:  Brewcap


 I am signing off of the HBD but want to thank the readership and online
experts (too numerous to mention) for taking me from worst brewer in the
world to best brewer in the world (IMHO).  I am taking early retirement
from .mil thanks to Bill C. so will have much time to devote to growing
hops and brewing beer.  I know it's a tough life but someone has to do it.
I hope to be able to monitor the HBD through r.c.b. (thanks Dion for posting).


Since the Brewcap and Fermentap have come up in discussion recently, I'll
add my .02 cents worth.  I am a long time user of the Brewcap because for
me it's cleaner and easier - no racking/ yeast collection/ minimal chance
for infection.  For a stand I use an old bar stool with a hole in it.  A
bearing is not needed, it takes little effort to rotate the carboy per
directions.  Some yeasts are more accomodating than others for this setup.
I like Wyeast 1968 because it won't blow off even with little headspace in
the carboy, it drops like a rock when it's done and doesn't stick to the
glass, plus it's a quick starter and I like the flavor profile. 
Here's a tip:  When fermentation is near complete, attach a HEAVY grade
balloon to your blowoff hose. Collect enough CO2 for bottling or racking.

I'll let Eric handle the stand idea of his.  Quickly, though, the easiest
to make stand for the BrewCap is made by cutting a 3" hole in the bottom of
two buckets or milk crates, then packing/duct taping the two buckets/milk
crates bottom to bottom and inserting the BrewCapped carboy upside down in
the top bucket.  The whole rig goes on a counter. (Actually, the buckets
are placed on top of the upright carboy before tipping over and
upside-down.)


And I agree that the biggest drawback to inverted brewing is the inability
to dry-hop.  But the solution lies in the use of a hop back.  I'm happy
with the results of the hop back so far as imparting hop aroma to my beers.
For more information on how to make one for the homebrewery, see the
article I wrote several years ago in the Special Gadget issue of Zymurgy.


Is a hop back better than dry hopping?  That always starts a religious
war!!  But I'll add this data point to the debate.  We've recently
discovered at Tumbleweed that yeast strain can make as significant an
impact on hop character as the way one handles hops.  I don't know why I've
been so late discovering this but we've been playing with various
combinations of yeast/hopback/dry-hopped beers lately and, for the moment,
I'm impressed more with the difference the yeast makes than anything else. 
Let me clarify that.  I'm saying that given that one either dry hops or
uses a hop back, the yeast strain has a significant impact on the flavor
profile.  I'm not saying it can make up for *not* using either dry hops or
a hop back. 


Back to work.

I had the Water Street wheat beer a few years ago, and suggest that if
you want a "real" wheat beer you make an effort to find a Bavarian
version.  You ought to be able to find bottled versions of Paulaner,
Spaten, or Ayinger weizenbier (probably a number of others, as well) in
your area, and perhaps even on draught.  If memory serves, the Water
Street pub is using a true weizenbier yeast strain but their brewing
technique isn't what's necessary to make a true wheat beer.


As for what you experienced, there are a couple of possibilities:  first
of all, a true wheat beer yeast strain is quite different from what
you're accustomed to, and it takes some getting used to.  The yeast, in
conjunction with the wheat, creates a lot of unusual flavors (vanilla,
clove, banana, etc.).  Frankly, I find a well-made weizenbier completely
addictive although the first sip is still a little jolt.


Secondly, Americans who've discovered wheat beers think that they should
be opaque and brewers tend to respond to that by overdoing the volume of
yeast in the beer. Here in Portland, Widmer's "hefeweizen" is extremely
popular and consumers like the yeast so much that the brewery had to
change the physical brewing plant so that yeast that had already
flocculated out was sucked back into suspension during kegging.  The
beer is a sea of autolysing yeast but, hey, who am I to argue with the
2nd most poured beer in Oregon (after Bud!).  I just don't drink it.


For a real fund of information about wheat beers, pick up Eric Warner's
book, from the Association of Brewers.  And drink some of the good stuff
first.

I wanted to add my impressions on the Pyramid Apricot Ale.  When I tasted
this beer recently, both in bottle and draught form, there was a very 
recognizable, if not dominant DMS character in the beer.  I'd suggest using
Klages or Lager malt, as opposed to Pale Ale for the base malt to clone this
beer.

I thought this might be generally useful, so I'm sending it to the list:


Mark,


Drape a towel over the top of your carboy, and far enough down the sides to
cover most of your beer.  Put a pail of water on top of that, and use strips 
of cloth (rags, old washcloths, whatever) to wick the water out of the bucket
and onto the towel.  With the fermentap and stand, this should be particularly
practical, because the upside-down bottom of the carboy on the Fermentap stand
sounds nearly ideal for this sort of rig.


Adjust the number or size of the wicks in the bucket to match the evaporation 
rate from the towel, and keep water in the bucket.  In the dry area out there, 
the evaporation should drop the temperature of the towel (and therefore the
carboy and its contents) noticeably.  If that doesn't give you enough of
a cool-down, aim an electric fan at the whole thing - together the wet towel
and the fan should give you about 10 degrees F of cooling.
